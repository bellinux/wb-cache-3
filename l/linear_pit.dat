40|$|The {{intention}} of this work's author was {{an interpretation of}} two almost identical items (pits) found during an extensive archeological {{research in the area}} of the former barracks Jiřího z Poděbrad, náměstí Republiky, Prague New Town. Items distant from each other 50 meters were unearthed within one year between 2004 and 2005. The items were represented by the pits sunk in the subsoil oriented west-east. A construction fragments were found on their bottoms. The first of the items was to a large degree disturbed with interferences in the 17 th century. Only one half of it has remained until today. The other item, unearthed in the náměstí Republiky area (nearly next to the st. Joseph church entrance) was not destroyed by younger interferences. This was a <b>linear</b> <b>pit</b> 4, 4 meters long, maximum width 1, 8 meters (in the central part), 1, 2 meters deep. There was a heating channel in its center made of two lines of diabase rocks (0, 63 - 1, 35 meters long). These rocks were commonly used in the fire using items the middle ages in the Prague area because of their heat accumulation capacity. Joints between individual rocks as well as their surface areas were filled with fired clay (puddle). On top of this construction a clay ring was placed (5 - 20 cm wide; 0, 65 - 0, 85 inner diameter). Both items were filled with mostly with [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The late Bronze Age {{settlement}} in Březnice near Bechyně (South Bohemia) was investigated during 2005 - 2009. As well as commonly found features, many ditches {{were also found}} (about 1 / 3). These ditches are <b>linear</b> <b>pits</b> oriented in a north-south direction and the length (usually 4 - 7 m) is four times the width. The results of macro-remains analysis of the late Bronze Age {{settlement in}} Březnice represent extraordinarily rich collections of archaeobotanical finds. Extracted macro-remains bear attributes of waste origin where Chenopodium album, Polygonum aviculare, Fallopia convolvulus are the most frequent. In the analyzed samples the main cereals were millet (Panicum miliaceum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare). Less frequent were species of wheat: bread wheat (Triticum aestivum), spelt (T. spelta), emmer (T. dicoccum) and einkorn (T. monococcum). Other macroremains found were legumes: lentil (Lens esculenta), pea (Pisum sativum) and broad bean (Vicia faba). Poppy seeds (Papaver sp.) were rare...|$|R
40|$|For machine {{components}} like gears and bearings, working life calculation {{is one of}} the complex issues to deal with. This is because the mechanics of their operation is dependent on many parameters, like loading, friction and lubrication etc. Also the influence of these parameters on the component failure modes cannot be perfectly idealized. But in this regard, standards like AGMA (American Gear Manufacturers Association); ISO (International Standard Organization) and BS (British Standards) are quite useful on the basis of which theoretical working life for {{machine components}} under a specific failure mode can be predicted. In this paper with <b>linear</b> <b>pitting</b> failure mode assumptions, theoretical working life calculation has been made for a helical gear. BS-ISO 6336 - 2 standard is used for the gear theoretical life calculations. Furthermore, a wear debris analysis based experiment has been performed for the validation of theoretical calculation. A back to back gear testing rig has been used for the experimental validation. The experimental results show that the theoretical life calculation {{made on the basis of}} BS-ISO 6336 - 2 standards is fairly accurate...|$|R
40|$|Original article can {{be found}} at: [URL] Copyright Blackwell Publishing. DOI: 10. 1111 /j. 1475 - 1305. 2008. 00457. xLack of {{representative}} theoretical models for gear wear causes difficulties in their useful lifetime prediction. Critical operating parameters, such as loading and lubrication, affect the wear process in a very complex manner and lead the theoretical modelling to an imperfect zone of assumptions. Complexities in gear wear mathematical modelling allow the researchers to use approximations for useful lifetime calculations. On the basis of modelling approximations and assumptions, organizations, such as American Gear Manufacturers' Association (AGMA) and British Standards (BS), provide gear useful lifetime formulations. In these formulations, the useful lifetime values are estimated by means of experimentation that is controlled with known gear operating conditions and physical dimensions. However, for useful lifetime estimation and validation, these standards have not considered any experimental approach that represents the actual gear wear. In this paper, an effort is made to validate the competency of standard's gear useful lifetime formulation. For this purpose, an approach that is able to provide an idea about actual gear wear is used. During the effort, BS-ISO 6336 - 2 standard formulation is used for helical gear useful lifetime estimation under <b>linear</b> <b>pitting</b> fatigue conditions. The used formulation is validated by using wear quantitative feature analysis that is able to provide actual gear wear quantitative trends. The obtained wear quantitative trends fairly validate the lifetime estimation of BS-ISO 6336 - 2 standard...|$|R

40|$|We {{report the}} {{discovery}} of grooves in Galileo high-resolution images of Gaspra. These features, previously seen only on Mars' satellite Phobos, are most likely related to severe impacts. Grooves on Gaspra occur as <b>linear</b> and <b>pitted</b> depressions, typically 100 - 200 m wide, 0. 8 to 2. 5 km long, and 10 - 20 m deep. Most occur in two major groups, one of which trends approximately parallel to the asteroid's long axis, but is offset by some 15 deg.; the other is approximately perpendicular to this trends. The first of extensive flat facets identified by Thomas et al., Icarus 107. The occurence of grooves on Gaspra is inconsistent with other indications (irregular shape, cratering record) that this asteroid has evolved through a violent collisional history. The bodywide congruence of major groove directions and other structural elements suggests that the present- day Gaspra is a globally coherent body...|$|R

40|$|NoDental Enamel Hypoplasia {{has long}} {{been used as a}} common nonspecific stress {{indicator}} in teeth from archaeological samples. Most researchers report relatively minor <b>linear</b> and <b>pitted</b> hypoplastic defects on tooth crown surfaces. In this work we report a high prevalence and early age of onset of extensive enamel defects in deciduous and permanent molars in the subadults from the post-medieval cemetery of Broadgate, east central London. Analysis of the dentition of all 45 subadults from the cemetery, using both macroscopic and microscopic methods, reveals disturbed cusp patterns and pitted, abnormal and arrested enamel formation. Forty-one individuals from this group (93. 2 %) showed some evidence of enamel hypoplasia, 28 of them showing moderate or extensive lesions of molars, deciduous or permanent (63. 6 % of the sample). Scanning Electron Microscope images reveal many molars with grossly deformed cuspal architecture, multiple extra cusps and large areas of exposed Tomes' process pits, where the ameloblasts have abruptly ceased matrix production, well before normal completion. This indented, rough and poorly mineralized surface facilitates both bacterial adhesion and tooth wear, and when such teeth erupt fully into the mouth they are likely to wear and decay rapidly. We suggest that this complex combination of pitted and plane-form lesions, combined with disruption of cusp pattern and the formation of multiple small cusps, should henceforth be identified as Cuspal Enamel Hypoplasia...|$|R

The objective of this study was to discuss the selection of the applicable probe type, scanning method, scanning times and procedure of magnetic memory method in response to different high pressure manifolds types. And according to the inspection instances, it was certified that the stress concentration degree can be detected and assessed by the magnetic memory method, and thereby the service life of the high pressure manifolds can be forecasted. Furthermore, the common defects of the high pressure manifolds, such as transverse and longitudinal <b>linear</b> defects, etch <b>pits</b> and wall thickness reduction, can also be detected by magnetic memory method. And the inspection results won’t be influenced if the stress were released. Key words:Magnetic memory method; High pressure manifolds; Stress concentratio...|$|R
40|$|The martian Residual South Polar Cap (RSPC) is a 1 - 10 m thick {{deposit of}} {{permanent}} CO_ 2 ice {{perched on the}} much larger H_ 2 O ice cap. The CO_ 2 ice is dissected into mesas by erosional landforms that can be broadly classified as (i) quasi-circular pits, (ii) heart-shaped <b>pits,</b> (iii) <b>linear</b> troughs, and (iv) moats. We use HiRISE (25 - 50 cm/px) images taken at a cadence of days to months to track meter-scale changes in the RSPC in order to investigate the mechanisms {{that lead to the}} development of these four distinct morphologies. For the first time, we report the development of dark fans {{on the sides of the}} CO_ 2 mesas and the fracturing and deterioration of the initially smooth upper surface of CO_ 2 mesas. We interpret these features as indicating the sublimation and subsequent escape of CO_ 2 from the interiors of mesas, which undermines structural support of mesa tops, causing them to collapse. The collapse of mesa tops, along with uneven deposition of CO_ 2 ice, creates steep scarps that erode during the summer due to preferential sunlight absorption. During the winter, CO_ 2 deposition acts to smooth topography, creating gently sloping ramps. We propose that the interplay between the steep scarps and gentle slopes leads to either quasi-circular <b>pits,</b> heart-shaped <b>pits,</b> <b>linear</b> troughs, or moats, depending on local conditions...|$|R
40|$|Similarities in the {{inhibition}} of crevice corrosion and pitting {{can be explained}} {{on the basis of}} competitive adsorption between inhibitive and aggressive ions. A mathematical model has been developed which takes into account competitive adsorption between aggressive ions (C 1) and inhibitive ions (CrO 4 =), with each ion adsorbing according to a Temkin iso-therm. In the case of crevice corrosion of iron, this model explains the linear relationship which has been observed be-tween the logarithm of the chloride ion activity and the logarithm of the minimum chromate activity required for protec-tion against crevice corrosion. In the case of pitting, this same model describes the <b>linear</b> decrease in <b>pitting</b> potential with the logarithm of the C 1 - activity at constant CrO 4 = concentration. The mathematical model, in conjunction with electro-chemical data and adsorption isotherms, allows calculation of a critical ratio, Ocrit, of surface coverages of aggressive to in-hibitive ion necessary to initiate localized corrosion. This critical ratio was computed to be approximately the same value (1. 9) for the crevice corrosion and pitting of iron in chromate/chloride solutions. Nominal confirmation for this computed value of Ocrit was provided by surface analyses using XPS. It is well established (1) that the various forms of local-ized corrosion share certain common features due to the limited exchange of local and bulk electrolytes. In crevic...|$|R
40|$|Background: Juniperus virginiana L., {{commonly}} known as ′red cedar′ in English is a well-known evergreen tree belonging to the family Cupressaceae. The leaves and young aerial shoots are used for preparation of medicine in Homoeopathy. Objective: Standardization is the quintessential aspect which ensures purity and quality of drugs. Hence, the pharmacognostic and physico-chemical studies are carried out to facilitate the use of authentic and correct species of raw drug plant material with established parametric standards for manufacturing the drug. Materials and Methods: Pharmacognostic studies on leaves and young aerial parts of authentic samples of J. virginiana L. have been carried out; physico-chemical parameters of raw drug viz., extractive values, ash values, formulation, besides weight per mL, total solids, alcohol content along with High Performance Thin Layer Chromatography (HPTLC) and ultraviolet visible studies have been worked out for mother tincture. Results: The leaves are needles, narrow and sharp at tips; stems are round with greyish white to brown bark possessing small lenticels and covered by imbricate leaves. Epidermal cells in the surface have polygonal <b>linear</b> sides with <b>pitted</b> walls containing crystals and starch. Stomata exclusively occur on the adaxial surface in linear rows. Hypodermis of leaf in T. S. is marked with 1 - 2 layered lignified sclerenchyma. 2 - 4 secretory canals are present with one conspicuously beneath midvein bundle. The young terminal axis is sheathed by two closely surrounding leaves while the mature stem possess four leaf bases attached. Vascular tissue of stem possesses predominant xylem surrounded by phloem containing sphaeraphides, prismatic crystals and starch grains. Uniseriate rays occur in the xylem. Mature stem possess shrivelled cork, followed by the cortex. Physicochemical properties and HPTLC values of the drug are standardized and presented. Conclusion: The powder microscopic features and organoleptic characters along with anatomical and physicochemical studies are diagnostic to establish the standards for the drug...|$|R
40|$|We {{have applied}} {{the theory of}} crystal size {{distributions}} {{to the evolution of}} etch pit size distributions (PSD's) on dissolv-ing minerals. Population-balance equations are derived based on nucleation, growth and annihilation of etch pits. PSD plots of log n (number of pits per size per area) vs. W (etch pit width) are used to compare tch pit populations. We have used PSD analysis to study the development of etch pits on calcite dissolved in a rotating disk experiment (far from equilibrium, 25 ° C, initial pH = 8. 6, 0. 7 M KCI). A maximum is present on the PSD plot {{in the early stages of}} dissolution and appears to result from nucleation of pits at all available sites on the initial cleaved surface over a finite time interval. As pits grow larger, become flat-bottomed and annihilate, the peak moves to larger sizes and decreases in magnitude to become insignificant after 17. 5 hr. After 0. 5 hr, the PSD plots become <b>linear</b> at small <b>pit</b> widths marking a population balance as new pits nucleate within fiat pits, grow larger, become fiat-bottomed and finally annihilate. This population of short-lived, small (< 100 /tm) etch pits possibly results from nucleation at point-defect or impurity clusters. A linear PSD for long-lived, larger pits appears at 17. 5 hr, possibly reflecting etch pits at dislocations. The overall PSD plot at 17. 5 hr is kinked due to these two populations. Calcite dissolution rates calculated from the coefficients of the PSD are within a factor of two of the dissolution rate measured from solution chemistry. Such estimates will be more accurate if the duration of dissolution does not greatly exceed the mean lifetime of etch pits. PSD plots for hornblende and microcline grains from a loess soil that has weathered for 12, 500 yr show similarities t...|$|R
40|$|IMPs {{exhibit a}} perplexing {{combination}} of characteristics {{that are consistent}} with either an approximately 100 Ma or 3 Ga formation. Dozens of small-area IMPs have crisp morphologies and crater size-frequency distributions (SFDs) that denote relatively recent geologic activity (less than 100 Ma); however, the apparently well-developed regolith on portions of the IMPs are in conflict with such a young age [1]. To test possible formation hypotheses (e. g., [1 - 5]), which range from ancient volcanism to contemporary outgassing, we examined IMP morphology at the meter-scale with LROC NAC images and derived elevation models. We focused on the largest IMPs (Ina, Sosigenes, Cauchy, Maskelyne, and Nubium), where contacts between deposits are best developed. Most of our observations are consistent with multiple generations of inflation and breakouts (or squeeze-ups) of basaltic lavas that were affected by local slopes. Some of the extrusions coalesced into larger mounds or filled pre-existing craters. We did not observe evidence of large-scale void space (e. g., fissures, fractures, <b>linear</b> depressions, or <b>pits)</b> within or beneath the mounds or rougher deposits (e. g., [5]). But, small-scale voids may be signified by isolated pitted textures. We also did not detect evidence of the cooling fractures or lava plates expected in young lava flows and observed in lunar impact melt deposits. The smooth texture of the mounds is enigmatic. Block-less craters suggest at least 5 m of friable or poorly-cohesive material (such as regolith), yet mound margins exhibit slopes greater than 30 deg requiring significant material strength. Blocks are not common on the mounds, but are sometimes excavated by impacts (usually excavated from beneath the mounds). The uneven deposits are equally enigmatic and texturally varied (blocky, pitted, and crenulated). They are deficient in superposed craters compared to the mounds. If the mounds are indeed of similar age to the rougher units, then their different superposed crater morphologies and SFDs need to be explained by factors other than their ages. Any mounds originally composed of friable surface materials would evolve differently from more coherent deposits (e. g., [6 - 7]) ...|$|R
