50|$|During the {{investigation}} of the fire, investigators learned that unreported fires had also occurred in 1985, caused by a deep-fryer, and again just days before the 15 March 1988 fire, caused by a broken <b>lubricating</b> <b>pipe.</b>|$|E
30|$|A new {{correlation}} was proposed {{to relate the}} hydrodynamic roughness produced by a viscous wall to {{the thickness of the}} coating layer. The correlation will be a critical component of any advance model of <b>lubricated</b> <b>pipe</b> flow with wall fouling.|$|R
40|$|At 1850 on 07 December 2011, a fire {{broke out}} in the engine room, on the No 2 {{auxiliary}} engine turbocharger. The fire alarm sounded and the ship's crew assembled and quickly extinguished the fire. The source of the fire was a leaking <b>lubricating</b> oil <b>pipe</b> gasket which leaked oil onto the turbocharger casing. Limited adjacent fixtures were damaged. Repairs were made, the leak fixed and the engine made operational and back in service...|$|R
40|$|Heavy {{duty and}} aeroderivative gas {{turbines}} for power generation and mechanical drive are installed inside an enclosure that is thermally and acoustically insulated and {{is equipped with}} fire extinguishing systems. The enclosure is bolted on the gas turbine basement and is made of a steel frame that supports removable side panels, doors and roof sections. All the fire extinguishing systems, <b>lubricating</b> oil <b>pipes</b> and electrical systems are fitted inside the enclosure and release, together with the gas turbine, {{a large amount of}} heat that has to be dissipated to avoid overheating of the gas turbine itself and its auxiliaries. Overheating of the enclosures {{is one of the main}} reasons for gas turbine unplanned stops. For avoiding high internal temperatures, the enclosure is equipped with a cooling system consisting of pipes and fans, that extracts heat from the enclosure and limits the internal temperature increase. This paper presents a calculation model developed for the study of the enclosure cooling system. Results are compared with experimental data measured on an aeroderivative gas turbine used as mechanical drive for a natural gas compression station, and acceptable correspondence is achieved...|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, it is {{tried in}} this paper to study the effect of two {{nanoparticles}} in water-base drilling-typical fluid. Specifically, {{the effect of this}} matter on the yield point (YP) and consistency index (k) and flow behavior index (n) was examined to improve cement-contaminated cement during drilling operation. Decreasing the flow behavior index by adding nanofumed silica in base fluid is among the results of the test. Cementing operation was of drilling steps employed several times to strengthen casing pipes. So, cement contaminations are avoidable in drilling. Silica (silicate mud) is a drilling fluid that matter used for specific purposes including being economic, lower biocontamination, better thermal and pressure stability, <b>lubricating</b> drilling <b>pipes</b> and shale prevention. Regarding each typical drilling costs of each foot and importance of time in the operation, it is possible to replace technically and economically the ordinary addition (here, the widely used sodium hydroxide) with fumed silica nanoparticles in drilling fluid to improve cement-contaminated drilling fluid. One of the nano-TiO 2 matter advantages is possessing suitable thermal transition qualities in drilling fluid. In drilling mud composition, there are a series of solid particles making electrochemical bounds with other liquid-phase matters. The resistance the matters show against cut is called yield point the unit; on the other hand, the point expresses viscosity and electrostatic forces between particles. In laminar flow, lines are parallel; mud moves in separate parallel layers with different velocities and passes through ring spaces or pipes. With the increase, flow velocities get closer in different layers. Displacement of mud is more difficult with slow flow because drilling particles tend to layers with low velocity and move in the layers and cause low velocity in the layers, their displacement gets harder. One way to avoid the problem is to increase the yield point.|$|R
40|$|Pipe jacking, {{has seen}} a rise in popularity, {{particularly}} in urban areas where infrastructure does not permit cut-and-cover methods. As pipe jacking has becomes more commonplace, engineers are pushing {{the limits of the}} technology more and more by designing longer drives in more difficult ground conditions. Lubrication is essential to reduce the frictional resistance generated at the pipe-soil interface. Even though lubrication is widely utilized, there is not a clear understanding of the conditions required to obtain the full benefit of lubrication. This dissertation focuses on bentonite slurry characteristics and interface behavior under different lubricating conditions with the goal to further the understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the large friction reductions observed in the field. An interface shear device capable of measuring interface behavior on pipe surfaces was used to perform tests under two <b>lubricating</b> conditions. <b>Pipes</b> were sheared against a mixture of sand and slurry and the effect of the slurry was quantified. In another series of tests, slurry was injected at the pipe-soil interface. An axisymmetric interface shear device was developed to further investigate the lubrication mechanism associated with injection of slurry into sand. The device was designed to inject slurry through injection ports built into a shaft displaced within a sealed sand-filled chamber. A series of tests were performed on dry sand as well as sand where water or slurry was injected during shearing. The effect of sand type and viscosity are also investigated. Findings from the experimental studies are related back to full-scale behavior with the objective of assessing the lubrication methods and their effectiveness. A rational procedure for predicting non-lubricated and lubricated jacking forces is proposed to optimize design and serve as a framework for evaluating jacking forces in the field. Ph. D.
