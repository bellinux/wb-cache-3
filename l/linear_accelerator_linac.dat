25|$|The {{acceleration}} {{occurs in}} a number of stages. The first stage is the 750 keV Cockcroft-Walton pre-accelerator, which ionizes hydrogen gas and accelerates the negative ions created using a positive voltage. The ions then pass into the 150 meter long <b>linear</b> <b>accelerator</b> (<b>linac)</b> which uses oscillating electrical fields to accelerate the ions to 400 MeV. The ions then pass through a carbon foil, to remove the electrons, and the charged protons then move into the Booster.|$|E
25|$|As of 2014, {{the first}} stage in the {{acceleration}} process (pre-accelerator injector) takes place in two ion sources which turn hydrogen gas into H− ions. The gas is introduced into a container lined with molybdenum electrodes, each a matchbox-sized, oval-shaped cathode and a surrounding anode, separated by 1mm and {{held in place by}} glass ceramic insulators. A magnetron generates a plasma to form the ions near the metal surface. The ions are accelerated by the source to 35keV and matched by low energy beam transport (LEBT) into the radio-frequency quadrupole (RFQ) which applies a 750keV electrostatic field giving the ions their second acceleration. At the exit of RFQ, the beam is matched by medium energy beam transport (MEBT) into the entrance of the <b>linear</b> <b>accelerator</b> (<b>linac).</b>|$|E

25|$|The LHC physics {{programme}} {{is mainly}} based on proton–proton collisions. However, shorter running periods, typically one month per year, with heavy-ion collisions {{are included in}} the programme. While lighter ions are considered as well, the baseline scheme deals with lead ions (see A Large Ion Collider Experiment). The lead ions are first accelerated by the <b>linear</b> <b>accelerator</b> <b>LINAC</b> 3, and the Low Energy Ion Ring (LEIR) is used as an ion storage and cooler unit. The ions are then further accelerated by the PS and SPS before being injected into LHC ring, where they reached an energy of 2.3 TeV per nucleon (or 522 TeV per ion), higher than the energies reached by the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. The aim of the heavy-ion programme is to investigate quark–gluon plasma, which existed in the early universe.|$|E
2500|$|A {{particle}} {{passes through}} several stages of s {{before it reaches}} the RHIC storage ring. The first stage for ions is the electron beam ion source (EBIS), while for protons, the [...] <b>linear</b> <b>accelerator</b> (<b>Linac)</b> is used. As an example, gold nuclei leaving the EBIS have a kinetic energy of [...] per nucleon and have an electric charge Q=+32 (32 of 79 electrons stripped from the gold atom). The particles are then accelerated by the Booster Synchrotron to [...] per nucleon, which injects the projectile now with Q=+77 into the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS), before they finally reach [...] per nucleon and are injected in a Q=+79 state (no electrons left) into the RHIC storage ring over the AGS-to-RHIC Transfer Line (AtR).|$|E
2500|$|A <b>linear</b> <b>accelerator</b> (<b>linac)</b> {{produces}} x-rays {{from the}} impact of accelerated electrons striking a high z target (usually tungsten). [...] A Linac therefore can generate x-rays of any energy, though usually 6MV photons are used. [...] With a Linac the gantry moves in space to change the delivery angle. Linear accelerator equipment can also move the patient lying on the treatment couch to change the delivery point. [...] These treatments involve using a stereotactic frame to restrict the patient's movement. The Novalis Shaped Beam Radiosurgery system and Tx Radiosurgery platform, from Brainlab, implement a frameless, non-invasive technique with X-ray imaging that {{has proven to be}} both comfortable for the patient and accurate. The Trilogy from Varian, or CyberKnife from Accuray, can also be used with non-invasive immobilization devices coupled with real-time imaging to detect any patient motion during a treatment.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the larger ones, there are also several smaller particle accelerators which serve mostly as pre-accelerators for PETRA and HERA. Among these are the <b>linear</b> <b>accelerators</b> <b>LINAC</b> I (operated from 1964 to 1991 for electrons), LINAC II (operated since 1969 for positrons) and LINAC III (operated since 1988 as a pre-accelerator for protons for HERA).|$|R
50|$|In the {{circular}} accelerator, particles {{move in a}} circle until they reach sufficient energy. The particle track is typically bent into a circle using electromagnets. The advantage of circular <b>accelerators</b> over <b>linear</b> <b>accelerators</b> (<b>linacs)</b> is that the ring topology allows continuous acceleration, as the particle can transit indefinitely. Another advantage is that a circular accelerator is smaller than a <b>linear</b> <b>accelerator</b> of comparable power (i.e. a linac {{would have to be}} extremely long to have the equivalent power of a circular accelerator).|$|R

The 80-foot electron accelerator tube was to create energy six times that of the betatron. The cost of the $1,750,000 facility was split between NRC and the University, with the NRC meeting the cost of the equipment and the University assuming the costs of the new building required to house the machine.|$|E

Brookhaven's <b>linear</b> <b>accelerator</b> (<b>LINAC)</b> provides 200 million electron volt (MeV) protons to the AGS Booster, and the Electron Beam Ion Source (EBIS) and Tandem Van de Graaff accelerators provide other ions to the AGS Booster.

50|$|Electrons {{generate}} the synchrotron radiation {{that is used}} at the end stations of beamlines. The electrons are first produced by a 100 KeV triode electron gun. These electrons then proceed through a <b>linear</b> <b>accelerator</b> (<b>linac),</b> which gets them up to 120 MeV. Next, the electrons enter a booster ring, where their energy is increased to 750 MeV, and are then injected into either the VUV ring or the X-ray ring. In the VUV ring, the electrons are further ramped up to 825 MeV and electrons in the X-ray ring are ramped to 2,800 MeV.|$|E

In addition to the storage ring, a synchrotron light source usually contains a <b>linear</b> <b>accelerator</b> (<b>linac)</b> and another synchrotron which is sometimes called booster in this context. The linac and the booster are used to successively accelerate the electrons to their final energy before they are magnetically [...] "kicked" [...] into the storage ring.

The effort on SC cavities has, in fact, pushed the cavities performances close to the theoretical field limits. A non-negligible part of this brilliant result is due to the attention paid to the integration of the cavities with their ancillaries and in particular with the interfaces. Among them a primary role is undoubtedly played by the power couplers. The importance of the integration of the power coupler in the cavity will be illustrated. A description of the different phases needed to ensure the required high performances will be given with particular attention to the technology associated with the RF windows and their multipactor suppressing coating...|$|R
