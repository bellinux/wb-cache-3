25|$|A local {{vector field}} on M is a <b>local</b> <b>section</b> of the tangent bundle.

25|$|Often {{one would}} like to define {{sections}} only locally (especially when global sections do not exist). A <b>local</b> <b>section</b> of a fiber bundle is a continuous map f : U → E where U is an open set in B and π(f(x))=x for all x in U. If (U, φ) is a local trivialization chart then local sections always exist over U. Such sections are in 1-1 correspondence with continuous maps U → F. Sections form a sheaf.|$|E

25|$|The workers now {{decided to}} open up the factory to outsiders, {{including}} journalists. This made them more popular. At first, Jacques Chérêque, the national leader of the CFDT metallurgist section, was wary of the Action Committee. At request of the striking workers, he sent a representative, Fredo Coutet, a metal worker, to discuss the strike with the <b>local</b> <b>section</b> of the CFTC. After a week, Coutet was convinced by his experience, but Chérêque remained wary. At that time, the workers were still skeptical about trying self-management, and requested an employer. Led by François Chérêque, the CFDT now tried to find an employer to buy the firm.|$|E
25|$|On April 1 and 2, 1939, the Union of Communist Students {{held its}} first, constitutive, {{national}} congress. It then boasted 1,000 members and groups {{in all of}} France, in particular in Paris, Toulouse, Grenoble and Strasbourg (where the <b>local</b> <b>section</b> was headed by Maurice Kriegel-Valrimont). Their main struggle was then anti-fascism, carried out in a difficult context because of the Munich Agreement. The UEC then gathered mainly university students, but also high school students. At {{the beginning of the}} war, the UEC became the UELC (Union des étudiants et lycéens communistes, Union of Communist Students and Lycéens - lycéens being high school students). The Congrès des lycéens anti-fascistes (Congress of Antifascist Lycéens) merged into it.|$|E

Rocker became a member and founded a <b>local</b> <b>section</b> in Mainz, mostly active in distributing anarchist literature smuggled in from Belgium or the Netherlands in the city. He was a regular speaker at labor union meetings. On December 18, 1892, he spoke {{at a meeting of}} unemployed workers. Impressed by Rocker's speech, the speaker that followed Rocker, who was not from Mainz and therefore did not know at what point the police would intervene, advised the unemployed to take from the rich, rather to starve. The meeting was then dissolved by the police. The speaker was arrested, while Rocker barely escaped. He decided to flee Germany to Paris via Frankfurt. He had, however, already been toying with the idea of leaving the country, in order to learn new languages, get to know anarchist groups abroad, and, above all, to escape conscription.|$|E

500|$|The 25th Battalion {{arrived in}} Mombasa on 4 May, and was {{immediately}} dispatched to Kajiado to defend the <b>local</b> <b>section</b> of the Uganda Railway from German raiding parties. Being a strategic rail line, it had been subject to frequent guerrilla-style attacks since the declaration of war. In June, Dartnell {{took part in the}} attack on the German fort and wireless station at Bukoba; the base for German raids on the Ugandian frontier. The assault party, numbering approximately 400, had had to sail across Lake Victoria and scale a [...] "cliff-like incline" [...] before they reached the outskirts of Bukoba to commence their attack on 21 June. The British and German forces wrested for control of the town for two days before the raiding party was able to seize the wireless station and town hall. In the final assault, Dartnell had been the first to enter the German-held town hall, and had hauled down the German flag to replace it with the Union Jack. Dartnell's actions were later recognised with a mention in despatches. He was also reportedly recommended for the Distinguished Service Order for his performance in the battle, but this was not awarded. He was, however, promoted to temporary lieutenant on 25 July.|$|E
