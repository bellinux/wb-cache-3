40|$|<b>Level</b> <b>set</b> {{methods have}} been widely used in image {{processing}} and computer vision. In conventional <b>level</b> <b>set</b> formulations, the <b>level</b> <b>set</b> function typically develops irregularities during its evolution, which may cause numerical errors and eventually destroy the stability of the evolution.
