2500|$|After its mixed {{reception}} on release, Straight Up {{has come}} to be recognised by critics as Badfinger's best album. Reviewing the 1993 CD release, Q magazine described Straight Up as [...] "brimming with mature melodies and bracing verse/chorus interplay", and [...] "More complete than their other long-play selections and resplendent with previously unheard gems". The NME deemed it [...] " [...] stone cold beauty of an album" [...] and advised: [...] "Love it <b>like</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> â€¦" [...] In a five-star review for the album, William Hanson of MusicHound opined that while No Dice [...] "established Ham as a versatile rock vocalist and imaginative songwriter", Straight Up [...] "assured [...] a spot in pop history" [...] thanks to its [...] "unforgettable" [...] singles.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>like</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> very much, because--because--" [...] And Isabel {{found herself}} {{attempting}} to assign {{a reason for}} her affection for Mrs. Touchett.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, then, {{and give}} me a kiss in return. Do you love me? Very well, then, treat me <b>like</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother.</b> Never mind 'my lady' this time. Give me a good hug!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're quite {{at liberty}} to go," [...] said the earl. [...] "You were never very ceremonious with regard to me; pray don't begin to be so now. Pray go--to-night if you <b>like.</b> <b>Your</b> <b>mother's</b> heart will be broken, that's all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Spoken <b>like</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> daughter, girl, {{and in a}} way to do {{credit to}} the Cap family. Now, I've hit upon a {{traverse}} that will just suit all parties; and, {{as soon as we get}} back from this little expedition down the lake among them there Thousand Islands, and I am ready to return, it is my intention to propose it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have learned}} to talk <b>like</b> <b>your</b> dear <b>mother,</b> Flo," [...] said McLeod, rising; [...] "we will {{continue}} this subject another time. At present I must away {{to work with the}} boys." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know you}} didn't, Rosie, but I {{want you to}} know how you can make me suffer by doing wrong--but there, there! don't cry any more. If you are good and kind and true <b>like</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> was you'll outgrow this trouble. Now run away and help get supper." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Joyce {{leaned over}} and spoke in his ear. [...] "It is only through devoted beings <b>like</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> that the {{bereaved}} are assured of life everlasting. She doesn't tell me that my son is living beyond the veil; she brings him to me. I hear his voice and touch his hand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "An' I {{guess the}} {{government}} owes {{it to us}} for what our fathers an' mothers done. I tell you, Saxon, when a woman walks across the plains <b>like</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> done, an' a man an' wife gets massacred by the Indians like my grandfather an' mother done, the government does owe them something." ...|$|E
50|$|The little park {{in which}} Margaret's statue is erected is officially named Margaret Place. Ithas often been stated {{that this is}} the first public {{monument}} erected to a woman in the United States. It is the statue of a woman, sitting in a low chair or the era, with her arms around a child, who leans against her. Margaret wears thick shoes, a simple gingham dress, with her perennial shawl draped around her shoulders, and a bonnet; she is stout and short, and her face is a square-chinned Irish face; but her eyes look at you <b>like</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Longdon's assent was mute. [...] "Ah {{she was not}} the worst! I {{mean that}} what made it so bad," [...] he continued, [...] "was that they all really <b>liked</b> me. <b>Your</b> <b>mother,</b> I think--as to THAT, the dreadful consolatory 'liking'--even more than the others." ...|$|R
60|$|LUCREZIA. Ah, I should <b>like</b> to see <b>your</b> <b>mother.</b> I should <b>like</b> {{to ask her}} to give me some hints on how {{to bring}} up children.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Joyce laughed. [...] "Yes, I've read Doctor Boyden's books. What does he {{know about}} it? Did he ever study a {{wonderful}} psychic <b>like</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother?</b> Has he candidly examined these phenomena? Never in his life! I know all {{about that kind of}} investigator. He is basing his conclusions on somebody's else's conjectures or prejudices." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's a pity, now, Josh," [...] said Raffles, {{affecting}} to scratch {{his head and}} wrinkle his brows upward {{as if he were}} nonplussed. [...] "I'm very fond of you; by Jove, I am! There's nothing I like better than plaguing you--you're so <b>like</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother,</b> and I must do without it. But the brandy and the sovereign's a bargain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When Arnold {{brought you}} to Bourne End," [...] Fenella continued, [...] "for one moment I looked at you and I wondered. You seemed, even then, {{to remind me of}} some one who had existed in the past. I know now who it was. You have {{something}} of Andrea's air, but you are very <b>like</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother,</b> Ruth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank God {{for that}} news, Ruth. I hoped after that {{poaching}} business {{you would see}} it in that light, and that he wasn't fit for a mate for one <b>like</b> you. <b>Your</b> <b>mother</b> will be glad, child. She ain't like the same woman as she was, is she?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{guessed that}} he had heard the news and stayed away through jealousy of his sister, and by and by she said, with a faint smile, [...] "I have a present for you, laddie." [...] In the great world without, she used few Thrums words now; you would have known she was Scotch by her accent only, but when she and Tommy were {{together}} in that room, with the door shut, she always spoke as if her window still looked out on the bonny Marywellbrae. It is not really bonny, it is gey an' mean an' bleak, and you must not come to see it. It is just a steep wind-swept street, old and wrinkled, <b>like</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> face.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{controversial}} article, New York Times Gadgetwise writer Paul Boutin said [...] "Turn off Vista's overly protective User Account Control. Those pop-ups are <b>like</b> having <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> hover over <b>your</b> shoulder while you work." [...] Computerworld journalist Preston Gralla described the NYT article as [...] "...one {{of the worst}} pieces of technical advice ever issued." ...|$|R
6000|$|And so, at last, {{passed away}} the little story of Lillie's life. But {{in the home}} which she has left now grows another Lillie, fairer and sweeter than she,--the tender confidant, the trusted friend of her father. And often, when he lays {{his hand on her}} golden head, he says, [...] "Dear child, how <b>like</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> you look!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{this is my}} nephew?" [...] he went on, {{turning to}} Dick, and holding out both his hands to him. [...] "You are taller than I expected--well nigh as tall as I am. You are <b>like</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> and my mother; and you are bold and active and strong, she writes me. My boys are longing to see you, {{and you will be}} most welcome at Tripataly.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's aboot all, son," [...] {{concluded}} the rancher. [...] "You understand now why I feel they're goin' to kill me. I feel it heah." [...] With solemn gesture {{he placed his}} broad hand over his heart. [...] "An', Jean, strange whispers come to me at night. It seems <b>like</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> was callin' or tryin' to warn me. I cain't explain these queer whispers. But I know what I know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She's {{up to get}} herself some dresses, I suppose? I've {{seen nothing}} of you for a long time. When are you coming to dine with me? I heard at Epsom that you'd sold your horse. What made you do that? What's your father {{telegraphing}} to me like this for? It's not <b>like</b> him. <b>Your</b> <b>mother's</b> not ill, is she?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well now, {{this is how}} {{the land}} lies," [...] said the old seaman, resting his elbows on the table and {{clasping}} his hands before him. [...] "As Mr Moor and I, with the stooard and men, are quite sufficient to manage the affairs o' the brig, and as we shall certainly be here for a considerable time to come, I've made up my mind to give you a holiday. You're young, you see, an' foolish, and your mind needs improvin'. In short, you want a good deal o' the poetry knocked out o' you, for it's not <b>like</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> poetry by any means, so you needn't flatter yourself--not built on the same lines by a long way. Well--where was I?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was greatly}} tickled {{at the notion}} o' the likes o' me bein' axed to {{recommend}} a lawyer. It was so <b>like</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> innocence and trustfulness. Howsever, she'd {{come to the right}} shop, as it happened, for I did know a honest lawyer! Yes, Betty, from the way the world speaks, an' what's often putt in books, you'd fancy there warn't such'n a thing to be found on 'arth. But that's all bam, Betty. Leastwise I know'd one honest firm. `Yes, Mrs Buxley,' says I, `there's a firm o' the name o' Truefoot, Tickle, and Badger in the City, who can do a'most anything that's possible to man. But you'll have to look sharp, for if Edwin comes home an' diskivers what's doin', it's all up with the fortin an' Betty.' ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{grabbed me}} and hugged me tight; and then gripped me by {{both hands and}} shook and shook; and the tears come in her eyes, and run down over; and she couldn't seem to hug and shake enough, and kept saying, [...] "You don't look as much <b>like</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> as I {{reckoned}} you would; but law sakes, I don't care for that, I'm {{so glad to see}} you! Dear, dear, it does seem like I could eat you up! Children, it's your cousin Tom!--tell him howdy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen, {{and let me}} {{give you}} this hope, for I {{sincerely}} do believe it. Since I came here, I have read many books, thought much, and talked often with Dr. Shirley about this sad affliction. He thinks you and Harry may escape it, if you will. You are <b>like</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> in temperament and temper; you have self-control, strong wills, good nerves, and cheerful spirits. Poor Harry is willfully spoiling all his chances now; but you may save him, and, in the endeavor, save yourself." ...|$|E
60|$|General Hoskyns, {{there is}} no further news, your Excellency, that I am aware of. But it may {{interest}} {{you to know that}} Mr. Christian held his twenty-fifth birthday yesterday--a quarter of a living century old; think of it, drink of it, innocent youth!--and asked down Lloyd and Daplyn to a feast at one o'clock, and Daplyn went at seven, and got nothing to eat at all. Whether they had anything to drink, I know not--no, not I; but it's to be hoped so. Also, your uncle Lloyd has stopped smoking, and he doesn't like it much. Also, that your mother is most beautifully gotten up to-day, in a pink gown with a topaz stone in front of it; and is really looking like an angel, only that she isn't like an angel at all--only <b>like</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> herself.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's it," [...] he said: [...] "I {{ask you to}} do {{a simple}} thing for your own good--and--you've got an engagement. It's always <b>like</b> that, and <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> backs you up. Bee, go and play me something." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, you {{impatient}} creature! I have {{nobody here}} but my good old uncle, a missionary for a generation, and now retired from service--nobody but {{him and his}} wife. I would so dearly <b>like</b> it if <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> and <b>your</b> Aunt Susan--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My darling child,' cried Cleopatra, languidly, 'you are not nervous? Don't tell me, my dear Edith, that you, so enviably self-possessed, are {{beginning}} to be a martyr too, <b>like</b> <b>your</b> unfortunately constituted <b>mother!</b> Withers, someone at the door.' ...|$|R
60|$|CARMODY. It's {{the dead}} spit and image of your sister Eileen you are, with your nose {{always in a}} book; and you're <b>like</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother,</b> too, God rest her soul. (He crosses himself with pious unction and Mary also does so.) It's Nora and Tom has the high spirits in them like their father; and Billy, too,--if he is a lazy, shiftless divil--has the fightin' Carmody blood like me. You're a Cullen like your mother's people. They always was dreamin' their lives out. (He lights his pipe {{and shakes his head}} with {{ponderous}} gravity.) There's no good in too many books, I'll tell you. It's out rompin' and playin' with your brother and sister you ought to be at your age, not carin' a fig for books. (With a glance at the clock.) Is that auld fool of a doctor stayin' the night? If he had his wits about him he'd know in a jiffy 'tis only a cold has taken Eileen, and give her the medicine. Run out in the hall, Mary, and see if you hear him. He may have sneaked away by the front door.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should not}} trouble about it. Your face will get manly enough in time, {{you may be}} sure; and I like you all the better for it, my boy, because you are {{certainly}} very <b>like</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother.</b> And now, Ralph, I want you to enjoy yourself {{as much as you}} can while you are here. The house itself is dull, but I suppose you will be a good deal out of doors. I have hired a pony, which will be here to-day from Poole, and I have arranged with Watson, a fisherman at Swanage, that you can go out with him in his fishing-boat whenever you are disposed. It is three miles from here, but you can ride over on your pony and leave it at the little inn there till you come back. I am sorry to say I do not know any boys about here; but Mabel Withers, the daughter of my neighbor and friend the clergyman of Bilston, the village just outside the lodge, has a pony, and is a capital rider, and I am sure she will show you over the country. I suppose you have not had much to do with girls?" [...] he added with a smile at seeing a slight expression of dismay on Ralph's face, which had expressed unmixed satisfaction at the first items of the programme.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{has looked}} upon as fair even as Edith,' said Mr. Millbank, rising {{suddenly}} from his seat, and pacing the room, 'and did that melt his heart? The experience of your own lot should have guarded you from the perils that you have so rashly meditated encountering, and the misery which you have been preparing for others besides yourself. Is my daughter to be treated <b>like</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother?</b> And by the same hand? Your mother's family were not Lord Monmouth's foes. They were simple and innocent people, free from all the bad passions of our nature, and ignorant of the world's ways. But {{because they were not}} noble, because they could trace no mystified descent from a foreign invader, or the sacrilegious minion of some spoliating despot, their daughter was hunted from the family which should have exulted to receive her, and the land of which she was the native ornament. Why should a happier lot await you than fell to your parents? You are in the same position as your father; you meditate the same act. The only difference being aggravating circumstances in your case, which, even if I were a member of the same order as my Lord Monmouth, would prevent the possibility of a prosperous union. Marry Edith, and you blast all the prospects of your life, and entail on her a sense of unceasing humiliation. Would you do this? Should I permit you to do this?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{when one}} {{gets to be}} sixty, my Romola," [...] said Brigida, {{relapsing}} a little; [...] "but I'm only fifty-five, and Monna Berta, and everybody--but it's no use: I will be good, <b>like</b> you. <b>Your</b> <b>mother,</b> if she'd been alive, would have been as old as I am; we were cousins together. One must either die or get old. But it doesn't matter about being old, if one's a Piagnone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't let Lady Southdown come again, Pitt," [...] {{said the}} old lady. [...] "She is stupid and pompous, <b>like</b> all <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> family, whom I never could endure. But bring that nice good-natured little Jane as often as ever you please." [...] Pitt promised {{that he would do}} so. He did not tell the Countess of Southdown what opinion his aunt had formed of her Ladyship, who, on the contrary, thought that she had made a most {{delightful}} and majestic impression on Miss Crawley.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Like himself!' {{repeated}} Gabriel, {{affecting to}} grumble, but evidently {{delighted with the}} part he had taken, and with her praise. 'Very <b>like</b> himself--so <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> said. However, he mingled with the crowd, and prettily worried and badgered he was, I warrant you, with people squeaking, [...] "Don't you know me?" [...] and [...] "I've found you out," [...] {{and all that kind}} of nonsense in his ears. He might have wandered on till now, but in a little room there was a young lady who had taken off her mask, on account of the place being very warm, and was sitting there alone.' ...|$|R
