5|$|King Nechtan son of Der-Ile abdicated {{to enter}} a monastery in 724 and was imprisoned by his {{successor}} Drest in 726. In 728 and 729, four kings competed for power in Pictland: Drest; Nechtan; Alpín, of whom little is known; and <b>lastly</b> Óengus, who was a partisan of Nechtan, and perhaps his acknowledged heir.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lastly,</b> Asch {{suggested}} that group influence can change how people perceive stimuli (See Asch, 1940 for an example). This {{is the most}} obscure of Asch's major ideas, {{in large part because}} it has not been cited frequently (Levine, 1999), but is none-the-less important because it speaks to the power of group influence.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lastly,</b> British {{efforts to}} downplay and {{disguise}} {{the nature and}} impact of the revolutionary movement at this time also resulted in a policy designed to strengthen the moderate movement in India, which ultimately saw Gandhi's rise in the Indian movement.|$|E

5|$|Once the British {{were aware}} of the leak, they were {{concerned}} that Cicero had leaked information that might help crack the British cipher, but that did not occur. <b>Lastly,</b> the intelligence might have made the Germans believe that there was no danger of attack in the Balkans, which may have been the most potentially damaging information gleaned by Cicero for the Germans.|$|E
5|$|The {{classical}} elements {{change into}} one another by a process of condensation and rarefaction. Fire first becomes solidified into air; then air into water; and <b>lastly,</b> water into earth.

5|$|The forced {{conversions}} of Muslims in Spain were enacted {{through a}} series of edicts outlawing Islam in the lands of Spain. This effort was overseen by three Spanish monarchies during the early 16th century: the Crown of Castile in 1500–1502, followed by Navarre in 1515–1516, and <b>lastly</b> the Crown of Aragon in 1523–1526.|$|E
5|$|There were three, {{relatively}} independent, research {{areas in}} the 1960s and 1970s {{that lead to the}} field of augmentative and alternative communication.

The second was the development of communication and language boards, and <b>lastly</b> there was the research on ordinary (without disability) child language development.|$|E
5|$|Bevelle, {{the spiritual}} {{center of the}} Yevon religion, lies on a thin strip of land {{slightly}} north of Macalania. The city is built {{as a series of}} layers, with the headquarters of Yevon located at the top. The Via Purifico, located beneath Bevelle, serves as an oubliette for outcasts. Further north are the Calm Lands, a series of plains that have been the site of numerous battles in Spira's history; the Cavern of the Stolen Fayth, an equally historical area; and Mt. Gagazet, home of the Ronsos. <b>Lastly,</b> the sacred city of Zanarkand is on the northern tip of the Spiran mainland, reduced to ruins by Sin one thousand years before the events of Final Fantasy X.|$|E
5|$|East of Massena, NY3 {{followed}} {{a series of}} local roads that parallel the modern divided highway section of NY37 to Rooseveltown, at which point it rejoined current NY37. The highway remained on today's NY37 up to CR51 northwest of Malone, where NY3 continued south on CR51 to modern US11 (then NY2) west of the village. After briefly overlapping NY2 (current US11) into Malone, NY3 turned south onto what is now NY30, following the route to Paul Smiths. Past Paul Smiths, NY3 continued east {{along the length of}} modern NY86 to Jay, overlapping then-NY10 from Harrietstown to Saranac Lake in between. <b>Lastly,</b> from Jay to Plattsburgh, NY3 overlapped then-NY6 along what is now NY9N and US9.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his release}} from the {{hospital}} and as a prisoner of war—the exact date is unknown—Schnaufer took over the family wine business. He had never planned to run the family winery as his ambition had always been to pursue an officer's career in the Luftwaffe. However, {{in the immediate aftermath}} of World War II the business had virtually ceased to exist and Schnaufer was given the task of rebuilding it from scratch. He had to re-establish business links to suppliers and customers and to consolidate them. Then he had to make new contacts in order to facilitate expansion and growth of the business. <b>Lastly,</b> he had to create an infrastructure which supported the growth of the business.|$|E
5|$|For {{the female}} lead of Cliff's girlfriend Jenny, Sherilyn Fenn, Kelly Preston, Diane Lane and Elizabeth McGovern were {{considered}} before Jennifer Connelly was eventually cast. Campbell and Connelly's working relationship {{eventually led to}} a romantic coupling, which Johnston {{found to be a}} technique for method acting that helped with their on-screen chemistry. For Secord's sidekick, Peevy, Dave Stevens hoped that Lloyd Bridges would play the part, but Bridges turned it down and Alan Arkin was cast. The part of Neville Sinclair was offered to Jeremy Irons and Charles Dance before Timothy Dalton accepted the role. <b>Lastly,</b> the part of Eddie Valentine was written with Joe Pesci in mind, but he turned down the part, which went to Paul Sorvino.|$|E

5|$|Globally, pelican {{populations are}} {{adversely}} affected by four main factors: declining supplies of fish through overfishing or water pollution, destruction of habitat, direct effects of human activity such as disturbance at nesting colonies, hunting and culling, entanglement in fishing lines and hooks, and <b>lastly</b> the presence of pollutants such as DDT and endrin. Most species' populations {{are more or less}} stable, although three are classified by the IUCN as being at risk. All species breed readily in zoos, which is potentially useful for conservation management.|$|E
5|$|Irving Isadore Gottesman (December 29, 1930 – June 29, 2016) was an American {{professor}} of psychology who devoted {{most of his career}} {{to the study of the}} genetics of schizophrenia. He wrote 17 books and more than 290 other publications, mostly on schizophrenia and behavioral genetics, and created the first academic program on behavioral genetics in the United States. He won awards such as the Hofheimer Prize for Research, the highest award from the American Psychiatric Association for psychiatric research. <b>Lastly,</b> Gottesman was a professor in the psychology department at the University of Minnesota, where he received his Ph.D.|$|E
5|$|Labour {{comprised}} skilled volunteers, engineers, {{designers and}} supervisors, who were paid and treated well, second came volunteer workers, often skilled technicians, such as carpenters, plumbers, electricians and metal workers, again these workers were paid, took holidays and were well treated. Next came unskilled forced labour, paid very little and treated quite harshly, <b>lastly</b> came effective slave labour, paid so little, badly fed and treated very harshly. The OT ran training courses to improve labour skills.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lastly,</b> Tai Loong had argued, {{even if the}} KD II was {{a fishing}} vessel under the statute, the interplay between two {{sections}} of the SFPA and its implementing regulations rendered them unconstitutionally vague, {{making it impossible for}} it to easily determine whether the statute applied to the KD II. It argued that this failure of the government to thus provide adequate notice that the law would be enforced against such vessels was a violation of their right to due process.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lastly,</b> {{he played}} {{at least some}} part in the {{establishment}} of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, passing the cipher manuscripts from which it was founded to his friend William Wynn Westcott shortly before his death. He had already made a strong case that the mystic and philosophical elements which allowed Freemasonry to evolve from a purely operative to a speculative society were likely to have been imported from some aspects of the Hermeticism practised during the Renaissance.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lastly,</b> of course, are the city's {{abundant}} and ample indoor recreational facilities, which often include basketball and racquetball courts, weight and fitness training rooms, and swimming pools.

The Bayside facility, for example, offers classes in yoga and pilates, as well as various types and styles of dance, not to mention seasonal offerings for young children and senior citizens.|$|E
5|$|Most of the series' main cast {{returned}} {{for the third}} season.

Lance Reddick starred as FBI agent Phillip Broyles, and Jasika Nicole played junior FBI agent/Walter's lab assistant Astrid Farnsworth. <b>Lastly,</b> Blair Brown returned as Massive Dynamic executive Nina Sharp.|$|E
5|$|Note, while column {{triplets}} {{are used}} to construct and identify the equivalence classes, the class members themselves are the valid Band1 permutations: class size (Sb.z) reflects column triplet permutations compatible with the One Rule solution requirements. Counting symmetry is a completion property and applies only to a partial grid (band or stack). Solution symmetry for preserving solutions {{can be applied to}} either partial grids (bands, stacks) or full grid solutions. <b>Lastly</b> note, counting symmetry is more restrictive than simple numeric completion count equality: two (distinct) bands belong to the same counting symmetry equivalence class only if they impose equivalent completion constraints.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1794, Thomson {{spoke with}} a ship that was sailing for Botany Bay. The ship had {{encountered}} a French privateer, of 14 guns, which the British ship managed to drive off after an engagement that lasted almost two hours. Reportedly, Prince of Wales went on to recapture a British brig that a French 74-gun ship of the line had captured. Prince of Wales sent the brig into Oporto. However, {{this may have been}} Best. <b>Lastly,</b> in early 1974, Prince of Wales captured and brought in Flugen, of Malmö, which had been carrying wine, brandy, and bale goods from Bordeaux to Saint-Domingue.|$|E
5|$|Several other SeeD members assist Squall's party. Dr. Kadowaki is the Balamb Garden {{doctor who}} tends to Squall's wounds after his fight with Seifer {{in the opening}} sequence. She also helps Headmaster Cid after his {{confrontation}} with NORG. Nida (another Star Wars reference, along with Biggs and Wedge) is a student at Balamb Garden who passes the SeeD exam along with Squall. He pilots Balamb Garden after it becomes a mobile base. <b>Lastly,</b> Xu is a high-ranking SeeD who helps Squall during the Dollet mission and the Garden civil war between NORG and Cid. She is friends with Quistis {{and a member of}} Squall's staff once he becomes the leader of Balamb Garden.|$|E

Raven busted his lip but no stitches were required. Jeff Jarrett suffered a bad cut to his forehead during the main event. <b>Lastly,</b> James Storm {{was diagnosed with a}} neck stinger.|$|E
5|$|Shoshone National Forest borders Yellowstone National Park and Bridger-Teton National Forest to the west. The Continental Divide demarks the {{boundary}} between Shoshone and Bridger-Teton National Forests. Along the Montana border, Shoshone National Forest borders Custer National Forest to the north. Private property, property belonging {{to the state of}} Wyoming and lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management form the eastern boundaries. <b>Lastly,</b> the Wind River Indian Reservation also borders on the east, and bisects a smaller southern section which includes the Popo Agie Wilderness and the Washakie Ranger District.|$|E
5|$|Social Worker: Every {{patient is}} {{assigned}} {{a social worker}} who visits {{at the time of}} admission to hospice. The social worker function can vary from providing superficial support to patients and families to intensive crisis-oriented counseling. Additionally, with a terminal illness often comes more complicated financial stressors; the social worker can be instrumental in connecting the patient and family with community resources including services such as Meals on Wheels. <b>Lastly,</b> if a patient is unable to be cared for at home, the social worker will work to find a safer place for the patient to receive hospice care.|$|E
