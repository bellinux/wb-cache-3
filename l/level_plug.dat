40|$|Even {{though for}} most {{hydraulic}} and geotechnical structures clear guidelines are available, those for flexible dolphins are still missing. Consequently, whether a design is safe is usually subject of debate. Economical dolphin piles are large diameter tubular piles, susceptible to local buckling. After installation the embedded {{part of these}} piles remains predominantly filled with soil. The aim {{of this research is}} to provide understanding of the effects concerning local buckling and therewith to contribute to the discussion whether a dolphin design is safe. The main research question is: Does the soil in dolphin piles contribute to the local buckling resistance and can this be used in the design of these piles? Gresnigt (1986) prescribes a strain based method to check a pile on local buckling. This method is incorporated in EN 1993 - 4 - 3 (2009). The resistance against local buckling depends on the slenderness ratio De/(tε 2). Also, ovalisation influences the resistance. The presence of a soil plug reduces the ovalisation, enhancing the local buckling resistance. An analytical method is proposed in which beam theory is used to determine the dolphin pile deformation and loads on the pile. Literature provides equations to calculate the ovalisation that can be applied in three distinct parts: above the bed level, between the bed <b>level</b> and <b>plug</b> <b>level</b> and below the <b>plug</b> <b>level.</b> The provided equations however, show inconsistencies at the transitions. It is proposed to apply beam theory on the pile wall, modelled as a linear beam with springs providing resistance against ovalisation. Above the <b>plug</b> <b>level,</b> the resistance is provided by the ring behaviour of the shell. Below the <b>plug</b> <b>level,</b> the stiffness is increased with the stiffness of the soil plug. The model overcomes the inconsistencies in ovalisation. The method assumes the stiffness of the plug in the pile can be approximated. However, it is concluded that the suggested stiffness in CUR 211 E (2013) is not able to determine the plug stiffness for semi-filled piles. Key parameters that affect the local buckling resistance are identified. These are the <b>plug</b> packing, <b>plug</b> <b>level,</b> slenderness ratio and the soil packing. The influence of these key parameters are studied with the finite element program Abaqus. The parametric study proves that the soil in dolphin piles contributes to the local buckling resistance. A denser packing of the plug improves the capacities of the bending moment and lateral load. Most of all, the dolphin can dissipate more energy. The <b>plug</b> <b>level</b> influences the level at which local buckling is observed, as well as whether an inward or outward buckle occur. The contribution of the inner soil on the local buckling resistance can be compensated by designing a more slender dolphin pile. A more slender cross-section reduces the capacities of the pile. The packing of the outer soil also influences the buckling level and shape. Furthermore, a looser soil packing improves the energy capacity of the dolphin pile. To obtain a dolphin pile that optimises the improvements on the local buckling resistance by the inner and surrounding soil, an installation method is used that does not compact the soil and plug packing and after installation, the plug packing is compacted. With the Abaqus analyses the stiffness of the soil plug is studied. It reveals that the plug is stiffer at deeper levels. For a pile with a diameter comparable to 914 mm, when the predicted ovalisation for that pile without a soil plug is less than 8 mm, a plug stiffness of 30, 000 kN/m 2 can be assumed in the proposed analytical method, regardless of the plug packing. The stiffness is independent of the slenderness ratio. The Port of Rotterdam facilitated a full scale field test with eight piles. The Abaqus model shows reasonable comparison with the field test. The observed local buckling behaviour piles that were not modelled can well be explained with the results of the parametric study.

40|$|The Lower Paleozoic {{rocks of}} North Wales are {{penetrated}} by numerous bodies of dolerite and intermediate-acid material which are {{closely associated with}} pillow basalts, acid and basic tuffs and ignimbrites. Igneous activity occurred throughout the Ordovician although in Snowdonia and Lleyn it reached a climax during the Caradoc stage. The present study has considered the granitoids of Snowdonia and Lleyn which are intruded as stocks, laccoliths and high <b>level</b> <b>plugs</b> (< 5 km 2) into clastic and volcaniclastic sediments. A substantial body of new chemical data has been obtained for over thirty intrusions. Twenty-four major and trace elements were determined on each sample by X-ray fluorescence techniques and the rare earth abundances of forty-five selected samples were measured using a radiochemical neutron activation procedure. Three distinctly different types of granitic material are recognised and their possible evolutionary mechanisms are discussed in detail. On {{the basis of the}} geochemistries of the various sampled intrusions it is concluded that they were all ultimately derived from the mantle by partial melting. One group originated from the remobilisation of calc-alkaline plutons formed by hydrous melting of the mantle wedge above a destructive plate margin. The other two groups, it is argued, evolved from tholeiitic basaltic magma by low-pressure fractional crystallisation. The goochemical affinity between some Caradocian andesitic material from Lleyn and the tonalitic-granitic intrusions of the same area has provided good evidence against a view that the latter were emplaced late in the Caledonian cycle (Silurian-Devonian). A paleo-tectonic reconstruction of the North Wales region is presented and it is claimed that the area evolved as a volcano-tectonic rift zone, a precursor of a back-arc basin. ...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Osteochondral {{autologous}} transplantation {{is used for}} the treatment of full-thickness articular cartilage lesions of a joint. Press-fit stability is an important factor for good survival of the transplanted plugs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 36 plugs of three different lengths were transplanted in fresh-frozen human knees. On one condyle, 3 plugs were exactly matched to the depth of the recipient site ("bottomed" plugs) and on the opposite condyle 3 plugs were 5 mm shorter than the depth of the recipient site ("unbottomed" plugs). Plugs were left protruding and then pushed in until flush, and then to 2 mm below flush level, using a loading apparatus. RESULTS: Longer plugs needed higher forces to begin displacement. At flush <b>level,</b> bottomed <b>plugs</b> needed significantly higher forces than unbottomed plugs to become displaced below flush level (mean forces of 404 N and 131 N, respectively). Shorter bottomed plugs required higher forces than longer bottomed ones. INTERPRETATION: Bottomed plugs generally provide much more stability than unbottomed ones. Short bottomed plugs are more stable than long bottomed plugs. Thus, in clinical practice it is advisable to use short bottomed plugs.

Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is bilateral and symmetrical, usually affecting the higher frequencies (3 k, 4 k or 6 k Hz) and then spreading to the lower frequencies (0. 5 k, 1 k or 2 k Hz). Other major health effects are lack of concentration, irritation, fatigue, headache, sleep disturbances, etc. The major industries responsible for excessive noise and exposing workers to hazardous levels of noise are textile, printing, saw mills, mining, etc. Hearing protectors should be used when engineering controls and work practices are not feasible for reducing noise exposure to safe <b>levels.</b> Earmuffs, ear <b>plugs</b> and ear canal caps are the main types of hearing protectors.

Results There were 66 patients in the study (35 TruFit and 31 Mosaicplasty) : 44 males and 22 females {{with a mean age}} of 37. 3 years (SD 12. 6). The mean BMI was 26. 8. Thirty-six articular cartilage lesions were due to trauma, twenty-six due to osteochondritis dissecans and three due to non-specific degenerative change or unknown. There was no difference between the two groups age (n. s.), sex (n. s.), BMI (n. s.), defect location (n. s.) or aetiology (n. s.). The median follow-up was 22 months for the TruFit cohort and 30 months for the mosaicplasty group. There was no significant difference in the requirement for re-operation (n. s). Patients undergoing autologous mosaicplasty had a higher rate of returning to sport (p = 0. 006), lower EQ- 5 D pain scores (p = 0. 048) and higher KOOS activities of daily living (p = 0. 029) scores.

The Fast Breeder Test Reactor (FBTR) at Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research (IGCAR), Kalpakkam, is a loop type, sodium cooled fast reactor. Its main aim is to provide experience in fast reactor operation, large scale sodium handling and to serve as a test bed for irradiation of fast reactor fuels & materials. FBTR was built on the lines of the French Rapsodie-Fortissimo reactor, with modifications to make it a generating plant. FBTR went critical on 18 th Oct 1985 with a small core of 22 fuel subassemblies of a unique, high Pu carbide fuel. The core was rated for 10. 5 MWt. The TG was rolled and synchronized to the grid in July 1997. Reactor power was progressively increased by enlarging the core, to reach 18. 6 MWt. Several challenges in reactor operation came on the way, which were successfully overcome. A large number of modifications were carried out to improve the plant performance. The reactor coolant used (Sodium) is highly reactive when exposed to atmosphere and also becomes highly active on exposure to neutron radiation. These properties of sodium make it essential to handle it carefully and safely within a leak tight containment. During course of operation of the reactor, a number of sodium laden components viz. pumps, valves, cold traps, Rupture discs, <b>level</b> probes, shielding <b>plugs,</b> control rod drive mechanisms, experimental assemblies, piping etc. are required to be removed for various maintenance, modification and replacement jobs.

STUDY DESIGN: Fetuses from time-dated pregnant ewes underwent at 94 days (term= 145 days) in-utero tracheal occlusion. In study animals an endoluminal, detachable balloon was placed by tracheoscopy. For that purpose a 1. 2 mm fibre-optic, semi-rigid endoscope and a medically graded latex balloon were used. In group I (n= 9) lambs were delivered after 2 weeks. In group II (n= 8) the tracheal occlusion was released after 2 weeks, to allow in-utero recovery until term. In positive control animals (group III; n= 5) the trachea was clipped at 98 days and fetuses were harvested near term by cesarean section. A total of 17 contralateral littermates in multiple pregnancies served as negative controls. After macroscopic inspection of the trachea, sections were evaluated by light microscopy. Alterations were scored with an empirical interval score for each of the different anatomical elements in the fetal trachea (epithelium, submucosa, cartilage, pars membranacea). RESULTS: For the animal experiments in group I, all balloons were found in place and according to the pulmonary response they were obstructive. Tracheas were macroscopically dilated by the plug mainly due to elongation of the pars membranacea. The total histologic score was correlated to the increase in circumference (mean increase: 3. 0 mm). In nearly all cases, the tracheal epithelium at the <b>level</b> of the <b>plug</b> had lost its typical folding pattern. In 44 % of cases, local epithelial defects were observed and in 33 % of cases there was squamous metaplasia. A chronic inflammatory response was present in over half of the cases, sometimes with giant cell reaction. In group II (the in-utero recovery group) the total score was significantly lower than in group I, with much less prominent unfolding and absence of epithelial defects. Squamous metaplastia was still present in half of the cases; whereas inflammatory responses were less frequent. In group III the trachea expanded normally after removal of the clip. The epithelium had compacted folds, and cilia were well preserved. In two animals however, intraluminal synechia were observed. Below the level of occlusion animals of groups I and II all showed areas of unfolding, but without metaplasia or epithelial defects. CONCLUSION: Tracheal obstruction by means of endoluminal plugging has been suggested as an alternative in-utero treatment for congenital diagphragmatic hernia. The balloon causes mild epithelial changes, such as unfolding, limited epithelial defects (< 25 % of the exposure surface) and local inflammatory changes. These changes disappear nearly completely following in-utero unplugging during the rest of gestation. Unfolding of the epithelium is also seen in the trachea under the plug. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Demand {{response}} encourages end {{consumers to}} voluntarily alter their electricity consumption based on fluctuating supply. In {{order to facilitate}} the participation of residential consumers in demand response programs, home smart energy management mechanisms that enable understandable and effective semi-automated control of appliance usage and consumption have been widely proposed. In general, there are two broad home energy management systems techniques. The first technique aims to provide automatic control for appliances inside the house. The second technique aims to learn the energy consumption patterns and provide feedback to the users. This feedback facilitates the users' better understanding of their energy consumption and leads users to take energy efficiency actions such as scheduling the laundry washing job during the off peak period. These techniques can be implemented in three different <b>levels</b> namely smart <b>plug</b> (appliance), smart meter (home) and provider. The state-of-the-art techniques for understanding appliance consumption patterns have focused on sensor based analysis through two different main approaches: having the sensors constantly attached to the appliance, known as an intrusive approach; and predicting appliance usage from a house's total electricity consumption, known as a non-intrusive approach. In an intrusive environment, the appliance usage model is developed based on data coming from sensors that constantly provide usage information for each appliance inside a house. In a non-intrusive environment, the absence of data coming from appliance level sensors imply that {{the focus is on}} disaggregating the total electricity load consumption to recognise the contributing appliances. Given the setup/installation cost of home energy management systems, it is realistic to expect that {{there will always be a}} large number of houses where only total/aggregate consumption from smart meters will be available. However, unlike custom hardware that record very high frequency (10 kHz to 100 kHz) electricity features, smart meters only retrieve macro features such as real power and reactive power in a low sampling frequency (1 Hz or less). Consequently, disaggregation accuracy of current non-intrusive approaches that use low sampling frequency data collected from smart meters is low. Thus, having a disaggregation technique of low frequency data that can provide accurate and detailed insight into appliance electricity consumption patterns as well as how and when an appliance contributes to overall consumption in houses is highly desirable. In this thesis, we proposed and developed non-intrusive techniques on low frequency data that provide a fine-grained understanding of home appliance usage. Firstly, we proposed and developed Wattzup, a computationally efficient disaggregation technique. Wattzup enables accurate prediction of the appliance usage from low frequency appliance data. Wattzup works accurately on up to one reading in every 30 minutes of data. Unlike state-of-the-art load disaggregation techniques that use computationally expensive algorithms for inferring appliance states, Wattzup uses a simple classification method that is computationally efficient yet accurate. This enables Wattzup to be implemented on demand side devices such as home gateways. Secondly, we proposed and developed Wattseal, an unsupervised appliance state modelling technique. Current appliance state modelling techniques rely on a predefined number of operational states per appliance and focuses on detecting the energy usage level per state. Such a coarse-grained view of appliance states may not be able to capture variations due to the presence of substates within a predefined state. Wattseal clusters appliance level data without a predetermined number of operational states and prior assumption of appliance consumption ranges. Thus, it allows accurate detection of distinct appliance states and substates. The experiments show that factoring distinct states and substates and their consumption level modelling both improves disaggregation accuracy and provides customers with a finer understanding of their appliance usage. Thirdly, we proposed and developed iWattseal, a novel technique for incrementally learning appliance states. iWattseal is designed to be computationally efficient for embedded resource constrained devices such as smart plugs. Unlike other appliance state modelling techniques, iWattseal incrementally recognises appliance states when the sensor is attached to the appliance during the training period. While incrementally recognising the appliance state, iWattseal automatically determines the training duration. With this capability, iWattseal can develop a similar appliance model to Wattseal's appliance model with the automatically determined training duration. In addition, iWattseal also maintains disaggregation accuracy while having a shorter training period. The efficient novel data stream clustering algorithm used in the incremental learning enables iWattseal to be embedded into small devices like smart plugs. The combination of these computationally efficient techniques provides detailed appliance states model and improves the accuracy of the load disaggregation technique. Detailed understanding of home appliance usage positively impacts users, by assisting them to control their electricity usage and reduce their electricity cost. It also positively impacts electricity providers, by balancing the energy demand and preempting costly installation of new power generators and transmitters, and society at large, by enabling and promoting sustainable behaviours...|$|R
