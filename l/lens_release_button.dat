50|$|The {{original}} {{generation of}} FD lenses featured a silver colored locking ring at the base. Only the locking ring turns {{to lock the}} lens to the camera body; the lens body remains stationary. The later New FD lenses have a black mount which includes a <b>lens</b> <b>release</b> <b>button.</b>|$|E
50|$|Major controls, {{including}} shutter <b>release</b> <b>button,</b> surrounding off/mode switch, film-speed/exposure-compensation dial and {{shutter speed}} dial {{are located on}} the right-hand side of the top plate, as seen from the rear, as is the LCD displaying he current frame count. The viewfinder is located on the upper left-hand side of the camera. The manual rewind <b>button,</b> <b>release</b> catch for the camera back and cable release socket are on the left-hand side of the camera. The <b>lens</b> mount <b>release</b> and frameline preview lever are located {{on the front of the}} camera. The bottom plate has the cover for the batteries and a tripod socket.|$|R
5000|$|The {{exposure}} meter's {{mechanical arm}} is retracted by depressing the shutter <b>release</b> <b>button.</b> As a result, the exposure meter will {{not produce a}} usable reading if the shutter <b>release</b> <b>button</b> is under any pressure.|$|R
50|$|AI Servo AF {{was used}} for moving objects. The lens would {{continuously}} refocus on the object in {{the centre of the}} viewfinder whilst the shutter <b>release</b> <b>button</b> was pressed half-way. Once the shutter <b>release</b> <b>button</b> was fully pressed, the exposure was calculated then the shutter released.|$|R

25|$|The 2010, 2012, and 2013 models lacked an {{interior}} trunk release mechanism. The trunk was only accessible using the key fob (Remote Keyless Entry) or a touch sensor between the trunk lid and the license plate. The 2011 year model added a remote <b>release</b> <b>button</b> {{at the left}} of the steering wheel on the instrument panel. The 2014 model refresh returned the trunk <b>release</b> <b>button</b> to LaCrosse but placed it on the driver door.|$|R

5000|$|Its match-needle meter {{instrument}} {{scale is}} visible in the viewfinder {{as well as on}} the top plate. The camera was originally equipped with the same coupled selenium meter as the Reflex S, but after 1962 a larger one was fitted, again made by Gossen. The Reflex III features the same [...] "setting wheel" [...] and interlocking aperture/shutter rings as the Reflex S. As it was fashion in the early 1960s the shutter <b>release</b> <b>button</b> on top was replaced by a shutter release shifter beside the lens mount. The film advance <b>release</b> <b>button</b> was eliminated, that function being incorporated in the frame reset slider, which was moved to the bottom plate along with the (still) manually reset frame counter. The ASA setting button was moved from the ASA dial to the spot vacated by the <b>release</b> <b>button.</b>|$|R

50|$|At {{interlockings}} {{where the}} Data Radio (BCM) is either not installed or not functioning, the train will {{determine if a}} positive stop is necessary via the cab signaling system. If {{it is necessary to}} pass a signal at Stop after receiving authorization from the dispatcher, ACSES will limit the train to 15 mph within the interlocking limits after use of the Stop <b>Release</b> <b>button.</b> The ACSES system also supports direct dispatcher authorization of passing a Stop signal instead of the use of the use of a Stop <b>Release</b> <b>button.</b>|$|R
50|$|To aid the {{versatility}} of the Px4, {{a number}} of parts were designed to be removable and interchangeable. These parts include the backstrap, the magazine <b>release</b> <b>button,</b> the slide catch and the hammer unit mechanism. The backstrap is available in three sizes: slim, standard and oversized. The magazine <b>release</b> <b>button</b> can be mounted {{on either side of}} the weapon and replaced by one of three types: standard, large or combat (extended). The standard slide catch can be replaced with a slimmer version to avoid snagging when the weapon is drawn quickly from a holster.|$|R

50|$|The FNP series {{weapons are}} hammer fired weapons {{utilizing}} a Browning cam system with an external extractor. The trigger module is housed inside the polymer frame {{as an individual}} unit connected to the hammer. The magazine <b>release</b> <b>button</b> is {{held in place by}} a retention pin which can be removed to allow the magazine <b>release</b> <b>button</b> to be reversed. The trigger pull for the FNP-9 variant is generally 8 pounds while in double action and 3-4 pounds while in single action. While the lower frame is made of high-strength polymer, the slide is made of stainless steel.|$|R
50|$|The cloth {{focal-plane shutter}} {{provides}} speeds from 1/30 to 1/1000 sec. and B. The shutter <b>release</b> <b>button</b> is {{situated on the}} right-hand camera front externally threaded for Leica cable release. The shutter control is the small milled knob on the top with numerals from 30 to 1000 and B engraved around it. It serves dual purposes, for winding the shutter in a single anti-clockwise motion until a catch arrests it, and thence as a lift and turn type shutter speed selector. A standard coaxial flash synchronising socket is situated {{at the front of}} the camera, below the shutter <b>release</b> <b>button.</b>|$|R
50|$|Nikon {{announced}} the lens on 9 February 2009. It {{is the first}} prime <b>lens</b> <b>released</b> by Nikon specifically designed for Nikon DX format DSLR cameras that is both rectilinear and supports autofocus on the Nikon D40, Nikon D40X, Nikon D60, Nikon D3000, Nikon D3100, Nikon D3200, Nikon D3300, Nikon D3400, Nikon D5000, Nikon D5100, Nikon D5200 and Nikon D5300. The first prime <b>lens</b> <b>released</b> for the DX format was the AF DX Fisheye-Nikkor 10.5mm 2.8G ED.|$|R

5000|$|When set to bulb, {{generally}} on the [...] "M" [...] or manual {{setting of}} the camera, the shutter will stay open {{as long as the}} shutter <b>release</b> <b>button</b> (or shutter <b>release</b> cable or remote) remains depressed.|$|R
5000|$|While the Ashani is {{externally}} {{similar to}} the Browning 1910, its internal mechanism {{is based on the}} Colt 1903. The pistol can be cosmetically modified by changing its magazine, barrel, grip, barrel and magazine <b>release</b> <b>button.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Lastly, the 9xi {{lacked a}} real {{vertical}} grip, only having a [...] "battery grip" [...] extending the handgrip slightly while adding support for AA batteries. This grip completely lacked controls of any kind, even a shutter <b>release</b> <b>button.</b>|$|R
50|$|For reasons unknown, {{it did not}} {{activate}} the self-timer: the timer had a separate <b>release</b> <b>button</b> that became available when the self-timer arm was cocked. Even with the self-timer ready, the camera {{could be used in}} the normal mode.|$|R
50|$|The <b>release</b> <b>button</b> {{was placed}} in an {{uncommon}} spot, halfway {{down the front of}} the camera. If the user used the middle finger for the shutter release, it was possible to have an unusually solid grip on the housing.|$|R
5000|$|A battery {{checking}} feature uses a LED {{inside the}} viewfinder; {{if there is}} sufficient power this illuminates whenever the shutter <b>release</b> <b>button</b> is lightly depressed. Another viewfinder LED illuminates whenever the camera's chosen shutter speed is below [...] s.|$|R
5000|$|Connected to {{the release}} socket of the camera body, this one-meter long switch lets you release the shutter without {{touching}} the shutter <b>release</b> <b>button,</b> especially useful in preventing camera shake and vibration during extended-time exposures using its lock mechanism.|$|R
