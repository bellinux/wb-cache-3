40|$|Platelet-activating factor (PAF) {{has been}} shown to affect sperm {{motility}} and acrosomal function, thereby altering fertility. PAF acetylhydrolase 1 b (PAFAH 1 B) hydrolyzes PAF and is composed of three subunits [the lissencephaly (LIS 1) protein and α 1 and α 2 subunits] and structurally resembles a GTP-hydrolyzing protein. Besides the brain, transcripts for Lis 1, α 1, and α 2 are localized to meiotic and early haploid germ cells. Here, we report disruptions of the α 2 (Pafah 1 b 2) and α 1 (Pafah 1 b 3) genes in mice. Male mice homozygous null for α 2 (α 2 -/-) are infertile, and spermatogenesis is disrupted at mid- or late pachytene stages of meiosis or early spermiogenesis. Whereas mice homozygous mutant for α 1 (α 1 -/-) have normal fertility and normal spermatogenesis, those with disruptions of both α 1 and α 2 (α 1 -/-α 2 -/-) manifest an earlier disturbance of spermatogenesis with an onset at preleptotene or <b>leptotene</b> <b>stages</b> of meiosis. Testicular Lis 1 protein levels are up-regulated in the α 2 -/- and α 1 -/-α 2 -/- mice. Lowering Lis 1 levels by inactivating one allele of Lis 1 in α 2 null or α 1 /α 2 null genetic backgrounds (i. e., α 2 -/-Lis 1 +/- or α 1 -/-α 2 -/-Lis 1 +/- mice) restored spermatogenesis and male fertility.

40|$|SummaryPrior to the pairing and {{recombination}} between {{homologous chromosomes}} during meiosis, telomeres {{attach to the}} nuclear envelope and form a transient cluster. However, the protein factors mediating meiotic telomere attachment to the nuclear envelope and the requirement of this attachment for homolog pairing and synapsis have not been determined in animals.

Disruption of Sun 1 in mice prevents telomere attachment to the nuclear envelope, efficient homolog pairing, and synapsis formation in meiosis. Massive apoptotic events are induced in the mutant gonads, leading to the abolishment of both spermatogenesis and oogenesis.

They proliferate until around 13. 5 dpc, then enter into meiosis in the female or become mitotically arrested in the male gonads. In this study, meiotic transition of mouse PGCs was examined in vitro. Female PGCs obtained from UGRs or genital ridges at 10. 5 – 11. 5 dpc began to express meiosis-specific genes, Scp 3 and Dmc 1, after dissociation and cultivation on feeder cells for several days. Meiotic transition into the <b>leptotene</b> <b>stage</b> was confirmed by the formation of axial cores. Male PGCs at 10. 5 – 11. 5 dpc and migratory PGCs obtained from mesenteries at 10. 5 dpc also expressed Scp 3 and formed axial cores after several days of culture, supporting the hypothesis that PGCs are capable of entering meiosis before arriving at the UGR. gp 130 -mediated signaling, known to promote survival/growth of PGCs and also to inhibit the differentiation of embryonic stem cells, suppressed the expression of Scp 3 in PGCs and inhibited the following formation of axial cores in vitro.

Three meiosis-specific cohesin subunits {{have been reported in}} mammals, REC 8, STAG 3 and SMC 1 beta; their expression in mouse spermatocytes has also been described. Here we studied the localization of different meiotic and mitotic cohesin components during prophase I in human and murine female germ cells. In normal and atretic human fetal oocytes, from <b>leptotene</b> to diplotene <b>stages,</b> REC 8 and STAG 3 colocalize in fibers. In murine oocytes, SMC 1 beta, SMC 3 and STAG 3 are localized along fibers that correspond first to the chromosome axis and then to the synaptonemal complex in pachytene. Mitotic cohesin subunit RAD 21 is also found in fibers that decorate the SC during prophase I in mouse oocytes, suggesting a role for this cohesin in mammalian sister chromatid cohesion in female meiosis. We observed that, unlike human oocytes, murine synaptonemal complex protein SYCP 3 localizes to nucleoli throughout prophase I stages, and centromeres cluster in discrete locations from leptotene to dictyate. At difference from meiosis in male mice, the cohesin axis is progressively lost during the first week after birth in females with a parallel destruction of the axial elements at dictyate arrest, demonstrating sexual dimorphism in sister chromatid cohesion in meiosis...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a protocol for the identification of aberrant chromosome behavior during human male meiosis up to metaphase of the secondary spermatocyte. Histological evaluation by the Johnsen score of a testicular biopsy was combined with immunofluorescence of first meiotic prophase spermatocytes, using antibodies against synaptonemal complex protein 3 (SYCP 3) and {{the product of the}} ataxia telangiectasia and rad 3 -related gene (ATR). This combination enables accurate meiotic prophase substaging and the identification of pachytene spermatocytes with asynapsis. Furthermore, we also investigated the competence of late pachytene primary spermatocytes to complete the first meiotic division up to metaphase and of secondary spermatocytes to transform into metaphase by an in vitro challenge with okadaic acid (OA). We tested this protocol on five males with normal Johnsen scores that presented with obstructive azoospermia, five males with low Johnsen scores and non-obstructive azoospermia and six vasectomized control males of proven fertility and normal Johnsen scores. In all azoospermics, the profiling of meiotic prophase stages by immunofluorescence increases the resolving power of the Johnsen score. In both obstructive and non-obstructive azoospermic patients, relatively more <b>leptotene</b> meiotic prophase <b>stages</b> were counted compared to the controls. In non-obstructive azoospermics, a marked heterogeneity in spermatogenesis was found, after combining the results of all three approaches, pointing at functional mosaicism of the germinal epithelium. Asynaptic pachytene spermatocytes were rarely encountered. Also, when first meiotic metaphase could be induced by OA, chiasma counts were normal. In none of the non-obstructive azoospermic males did the pattern of spermatogenesis resemble that of knock-out mouse azoospermics. We conclude that this combined histological and cytological approach enables a detailed phenotypic classification of infertile males, at a level comparable to that applied for male-sterile knock-out mice with a meiotic defect.

40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a {{class of}} endogenous, non-coding RNAs that mediate post-transcriptional gene {{silencing}} by inhibiting mRNA translation and promoting mRNA decay. DICER 1, an RNase III endonuclease encoded by Dicer 1, is required for processing short 21 - 22 nucleotide miRNAs from longer double-stranded RNA precursors. Here, we investigate the loss of Dicer 1 in mouse postnatal male germ cells to determine how disruptions in the miRNA biogenesis pathway may contribute to infertility. Reduced levels of Dicer 1 transcripts and DICER 1 were confirmed in germ cell knock-out (GCKO) testes by postnatal day 18 (P 18). Compared to wild-type (WT) at 8 weeks, GCKO males had no change in body weight; yet showed significant reductions in testis mass and sperm number. Histology and fertility tests confirmed spermatogenic failure in GCKO males. Array analyses at P 18 showed that in comparison to WT testes, 75 % of miRNA genes and 37 % of protein coding genes were differentially expressed in GCKO testes. Among these, 96 % of miRNA genes were significantly down-regulated, while 4 % miRNA genes were overexpressed. Interestingly, we observed preferential overexpression of genes encoded on the sex chromosomes in GCKO testes, including more than 80 % of previously identified targets of meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI). Compared to WT, GCKO mice showed higher percentages of germ cells at early meiotic <b>stages</b> (<b>leptotene</b> and zygotene) but lower percentages at later stages (pachytene, diplotene and metaphase I) providing evidence that deletion of Dicer 1 leads to disruptions in meiotic progression.

40|$|ABSTRACT The testes {{of fully}} mature bullfrogs, Rana catesbeiana, were studied by light microscope. The germ {{cells in the}} {{developing}} testis can be classified into 12 stages based on nuclear characteristics. Primary(type A) and secondary(type B) spermatogonia are the earliest germ cells, with the former showing large and completely euchromatic nuclei with prominent nucleoli and the latter with small blocks of heterochromatin distributed along the nuclear envelope. Spermatocytes consist of five stages; namely, leptotene, zygotene, pachytene, diplotene and diakinesis metaphase spermatocytes. Succeeding stages show increasing condensation of chromatin: from the coarse fibers, that are evenly distributed throughout the nucleus in <b>leptotene</b> <b>stage</b> to the highly condensed blocks of heterochromatin in pachytene and diplotene stages. Nucleoli are not detected in any stages. Secondary spermatocytes have blocks of completely condensed heterochromatin attaching to the nuclear envelopes. There are three stages of spermatids: the early stage shows coarse chromatin granules occurs evenly over the nucleus, the middle stage has increased chromatin condensation over the entire oval nucleus while the nuclear size decreases. The late stage exhibits completely condensed chromatin in an elongated nucleus, and its cytoplasm becomes highly vacuolized and starts to degenerate. In fully mature spermatozoa, the nucleus becomes highly elongated and chromatin completely condensed. During development of the testis, sex cords i...|$|E

Later at the zygotene stage, when sPDs and CCs were actively formed, strong pectinase {{activity was}} observed not only in the SER cisternae and their derived vesicles but also in the cell wall, especially in the vicinity of or within both simple and branched plasmodesmata, notably along the middle lamellae, which also characterized the sites of CCs being formed.

In combination with cellulase, pectinase also promotes the secondary formation of plasmodesmata and CCs by specifically digesting the pectin in middle lamella.

40|$|A {{critical}} step of spermatogenesis is {{the entry of}} mitotic spermatogonia into meiosis. Progresses on these topics are hampered {{by the lack of}} an in vitro culture system allowing mouse spermatogonia differentiation and entry into meiosis. Previous studies have shown that mouse pachytene spermatocytes cultured in simulated microgravity (SM) undergo a spontaneous meiotic progression. Here we report that mouse mitotic spermatogonia cultured under SM with a rotary cell culture system (RCCS) enter into meiosis {{in the absence of any}} added exogenous factor or contact with somatic cells.

40|$|Background: Telomeres have crucial meiosis-specific {{roles in}} the orderly {{reduction}} of chromosome numbers and in ensuring {{the integrity of the}} genome during meiosis. One such role is the attachment of telomeres to trans-nuclear envelope protein complexes that connect telomeres to motor proteins in the cytoplasm. These trans-nuclear envelope connections between telomeres and cytoplasmic motor proteins permit the active movement of telomeres and chromosomes during the first meiotic prophase. Movements of chromosomes/telomeres facilitate the meiotic recombination process, and allow high fidelity pairing of homologous chromosomes. Pairing of homologous chromosomes is a prerequisite for their correct segregation during the first meiotic division. Although inner-nuclear envelope proteins, such as SUN 1 and potentially SUN 2, are known to bind and recruit meiotic telomeres, these proteins are not meiosis-specific, therefore cannot solely account for telomere-nuclear envelope attachment and/or for other meiosis-specific characteristics of telomeres in mammals. Results: We identify CCDC 79, alternatively named TERB 1, as a meiosis-specific protein that localizes to telomeres from <b>leptotene</b> to diplotene <b>stages</b> of the first meiotic prophase. CCDC 79 and SUN 1 associate with telomeres almost concurrently at the onset of prophase, indicating a possible role for CCDC 79 in telomere-nuclear envelope interactions and/or telomere movements. Consistent with this scenario, CCDC 79 is missing from most telomeres that fail to connect to SUN 1 protein in spermatocytes lacking the meiosis-specific cohesin SMC 1 B. SMC 1 B-deficient spermatocytes display both reduced efficiency in telomere-nuclear envelope attachment and reduced stability of telomeres specifically during meiotic prophase. Importantly, CCDC 79 associates with telomeres in SUN 1 -deficient spermatocytes, which strongly indicates that localization of CCDC 79 to telomeres does not require telomere-nuclear envelope attachment. Conclusion: CCDC 79 is a meiosis-specific telomere associated protein. Based on our findings we propose that CCDC 79 plays a role in meiosis-specific telomere functions. In particular, we favour the possibility that CCDC 79 is involved in telomere-nuclear envelope attachment and/or the stabilization of meiotic telomeres. These conclusions are consistent with the findings of an independently initiated study that analysed CCDC 79 /TERB 1 functions...|$|R
40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} of parental genomes has attracted much interest because intranuclear chromosome distribution can modulate the transcriptome of cells and influence the efficacy of meiotic homologue pairing. Pairing of parental chromosomes is imperative to sexual reproduction as it translates into homologue segregation and genome haploidization to counteract the genome doubling at fertilization. Differential FISH tagging of parental pericentromeric genome portions and specific painting of euchromatic chromosome arms in Mus musculus (MMU) x Mus spretus (MSP) hybrid spermatogenesis disclosed a phase of homotypic non-homologous pericentromere clustering that led to parental pericentric genome separation from the pre-leptoteneup to zygotene stages. Preferential clustering of MMU pericentromeres correlated with particular enrichment of epigenetic marks (H 3 K 9 me 3), HP 1 -gamma and structural maintenance of chromosomes SMC 6 complex proteins at the MMU major satellite DNA repeats. In contrast to the separation of heterochromatic pericentric genome portions, the euchromatic arms of homeologous chromosomes showed considerable presynaptic pairing already during <b>leptotene</b> <b>stage</b> of all mice investigated. Pericentric genome separation was eventually disbanded by telomere clustering that concentrated both parental pericentric genome portions in a limited nuclear sector of the bouquet nucleus. Our data disclose the differential behavior of pericentromeric heterochromatin and the euchromatic portions of the parental genomes during homologue search. Homotypic pericentromere clustering early in prophase I {{may contribute to the}} exclusion of large repetitive DNA domains from homology search, while the telomere bouquet congregates and registers spatially separated portions of the genome to fuel synapsis initiation and high levels of homologue pairing, thus contributing to the fidelity of meiosis and reproduction...|$|E
30|$|The {{centromere}} is a multi-protein {{complex and}} recruits the kinetochore to form attachments to the microtubules of the mitotic and meiotic spindles. CENP J and CENP F are two {{components of the}} centromere. Using yeast two-hybrid screening, we discovered the surprising finding that the SYCP 2 NTR associates well with the centromere. It was reported that the C-terminal region of mSYCP 2 {{was found to be}} responsible for the association of SYCP 3 and SYCP 1 for SC formation. Consistent with the localization of the SC and the centromere to male MI chromosomes, SYCP 2 and SYCP 3, as the lateral elements, begin to localize to the chromosome core during the <b>leptotene</b> <b>stage</b> and continue to localize until the diakinesis stage when all but the crossover sites and the centromeres are broken down (Bisig et al., 2012). Therefore, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that SYCP 2 may act as a bridge that brings the SC and centromere together. SYCP 1 has no detectable immunofluorescence signals during the late diplotene stage before the nuclear envelop breaks down; also, parts of SYCP 3 begin to gradually disappear during the diplotene stage, whereas the remnants are maintained at the centromere as microtubules for assembly until anaphase I (Bisig et al., 2012). These results indicate that SYCP 1 and SYCP 3 are less likely to be responsible for the association of the SC with the centromere. Of course, we cannot exclude the possibility that other unidentified proteins may contribute to their association. Thus, we proposed a model in which mSYCP 2 bridges the SC with the centromere (Fig.  2 F).|$|E
40|$|Homologous pairing during meiosis is an {{important}} process for the fidelity of recombination and chromosome segregation. The activity of homologous pairing {{has been linked to}} events that occur during the early stages of recombination, namely double strand break formation and single end invasion. The exact activities that regulate the genetic network of homologous pairing are not completely understood. The first chapter of this dissertation provides a review of research regarding homologous pairing. To understand more about the activity, a forward genetics approach was used to identify two mutants of maize, segII and dsyCS. Cytological characterization of these mutants and mapping the genetic lesion underlying each of their phenotypes comprise the second and third chapters. Combining FISH and immunolocalization studies, the segII mutant displays abnormalities beginning at the <b>leptotene</b> <b>stage</b> of meiosis, which result in reduced installation of DSB repair proteins, non-homologous pairing, reduced chiasmata, and crossovers between non-homologous chromosomes. Application of cisplatin to segII mutants to induce double strand breaks at leptotene partially rescues repair protein installation, suggesting that a lack of DSBs underlies the abnormal meiotic phenotype of segII. Analysis of the segII mutant also indicates that maize displays crossover homeostasis through its reduced single end invasion events. The number of chiasmata is disproportionally reduced when compared to the number of SEI: 26 % versus 2 % respectively. The dsyCS mutant was also analyzed using FISH and immunolocazliation studies. It displays a similar repair protein abnormality to segII, a more severe pairing phenotype than segII and, most notably, a high rate of anaphase bridges. A FISH probe to the telomeres reveals interchromosomal connections at diakinesis, which suggests that improper telomere repair is at least partially responsible for the bridges. dsyCS displays non-homologous crossovers, and together with segII and the previously characterized zmRad 51 mutant, suggests that maize has at least three genetic paths to create nonhomologous chiasmata...|$|E

The testis and ovaries of matured worms were extracted from live adult worms and there were stained with 45 % aceto-orcein solution for chromosome observations. The {{results of the study}} are briefly presented as follows. 1. Ten bivalent chromosomes can be seen in both primary spermatocytes and oocytes, which signifies the diploid number of chromosomes to be 20 (2 n= 20). 2. A spermatocyte is divided into four spertides after binary division. 3. The spermatozac after being transformed into the same number of spermatides, pass through vas deferens and wanter out to the seminal vesicle, and after copulation there, they are ejected into the uterus. 4. When the ovum has moved to the center of ovary, it reaches the <b>leptotene</b> <b>stage</b> and is inseminated. 5. The cocyte after insemination enters into egg-shell at ootype and then migranting towards the uterus, under goes two mitotis (meitotic) division and is transformed to prenucleus. 6. Sperms are gradually enlarged within the oocyte and forming the nucleus, now are transformed to sexual pronucleus. Oocytes that have formed sexual pronucleus in the center of uterus undergo karyogamy near she periphery of uterus, and after the first cleavage of ovum, there are formed two cells of a large and a small one each having 2 n= 20 chromosomes. Subsequently, they undergo the second cleavage to form one large cell and three small cells. At the time of spawning the ovum is composed of the primary and secondary polocytes and a cell at the fourth cleavage as well as a vitelline cell just before disintegration...|$|E
