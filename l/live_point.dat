50|$|<b>Live</b> <b>Point</b> Foundation is {{a service}} {{supplying}} foreign and Arabic channels with economic, {{social and political}} news and current events in the Arab region. Services include producing and broadcasting news reports, various news and studio and live windows services, as well as drama and film production, different TV shows, dubbing, subtitling and distribution. The headquarters of the foundation is in Dubai - United Arab Emirates and has affiliates in both Jordon and Istanbul.|$|E

40|$|Big Data {{has begun}} to create {{significant}} impacts in urban and transport planning. This paper covers the explosion in data-driven research on cycling, most of which {{has occurred in the}} last ten years. We review the techniques, objectives and findings {{of a growing number of}} studies we have classified into three groups according to the nature of the data they are based on: GPS data (spatio-temporal data collected using the global positioning system (GPS)), <b>live</b> <b>point</b> data and journey data. We discuss the movement from small-scale GPS studies to the ‘Big GPS’ data sets held by fitness and leisure apps or specific cycling initiatives, the impact of Bike Share Programmes (BSP) on the availability of timely point data and the potential of historical journey data for trend analysis and pattern recognition. We conclude by pointing towards the possible new insights through combining these data sets with each other – and with more conventional health, socio-demographic or transport data...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{an application of}} the MultiNest algorithm to gravitational wave data analysis. MultiNest is a multimodal nested sampling algorithm designed to efficiently evaluate the Bayesian evidence and return posterior probability densities for likelihood surfaces containing multiple secondary modes. The algorithm employs a set of live points which are updated by partitioning the set into multiple overlapping ellipsoids and sampling uniformly from within them. This set of live points climbs up the likelihood surface through nested iso-likelihood contours and the evidence and posterior distributions can be recovered from the point set evolution. The algorithm is model-independent {{in the sense that}} the specific problem being tackled enters only through the likelihood computation, and does not change how the <b>live</b> <b>point</b> set is updated. In this paper, we consider the use of the algorithm for gravitational wave data analysis by searching a simulated LISA data set containing two non-spinning supermassive black hole binary signals. The algorithm is able to rapidly identify all the modes of the solution and recover the true parameters of the sources to high precision. Comment: 18 pages, 4 figures, submitted to Class.

40|$|Contact no: 7890220622 ABSTRACT- The {{steady state}} {{operating}} mode {{of a power}} system is balanced 3 phase ac. However, due to sudden external or internal changes in the system, this condition is disrupted. When the insulation of the system fails at one or more points or a conducting object comes in contact with a <b>live</b> <b>point,</b> then short circuit or fault occurs. As power lines are heavily interconnected to the systems. So fault analysis {{is very important for}} stability analysis. The one section faults will cause serious effects to other sections also. This idea has been analysis through this paper. In first case we have take a sample IEEE 14 bus system and creates the fault in one locations and which detects by the protection devices and clears but this fault is also creates the instability of voltages in nearby system(in bus [...] ). As we know that relay circuit has detects the faults and give the tripping signals to the circuit breakers and circuit breakers open the faulty line from healthy lines but sometimes it requires delay that system will balanced by itself, but here we see that within delay timing this fault will effects other lines also and voltage will decrease from there rated conditions. So we must need t...|$|E
