40|$|Worldwide, {{groundwater}} {{represents the}} largest and most important source of potable water. Usually, urbanisation affects shallow urban aquifers in two ways: by radically changing patterns and rates of aquifer recharge, and by adversely affecting the quality of groundwater. The overall objective of this thesis is to illuminate multiple subsurface environmental problems in urban areas. The urban environment, first described generally, is thereafter treated from three angles: (1) <b>leakage</b> <b>water</b> from stockpile storage of reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) as a source of groundwater contamination; (2) urban shallow groundwater quality, exemplified by the conditions in Göteborg; and (3) corrosion of soil-buried structures as an effect of the composition of the soil, soil water and groundwater. In the asphalt investigation both field and laboratory works were included. Several semi-volatile compounds were identified frequently in the <b>leakage</b> <b>water</b> from the field stockpiles. The laboratory column test differs in that the concentrations of the compounds were much lower, and the compounds were fewer and to some extent different. The main reason was the much higher ratio of liquid to solid in the column tests than in the field. The most common semi-volatile compounds found in the <b>leakage</b> <b>water</b> from RAP were also observed in shallow urban groundwater, the quality of which was investigated in eighteen observation wells; it was shown that the quality differs greatly from that of rural areas, normally by greater ion strength and a much higher alkalinity. Although the composition of the filling material caused the high alkalinity, the natural geological material also had an influence. The soil analysis from the field corrosion investigation showed large differences between samples taken from places as close to each other as half a metre, which highlights the heterogeneity of the filling material. Results showed that the heterogeneity of the filling material stimulated the corrosion process of soil-buried panels of carbon steel and zinc; however, the high alkalinity of the soil water and the groundwater and the high total hardness of the filling material both retard the corrosion rate...|$|E

The <b>leakage</b> <b>water</b> {{is characterized by a}} high concentration of nitrogen and the system is based on biological removing of the nitrogen in the water, by nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria. Four different problems are found in the system: 1. High level of nitrogen concentration in the outgoing water of the system. It should be {{due to the lack of}} phosphate in the water, that do not let the bacteria to grow. 2. Low temperature during the most part of the year. Nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria are temperature-dependent, that are very slow at low temperatures. 3. High oxygen concentration in one of the anoxic pond, where the denitrification process take place. This oxygen concentration is too high for denitrifying bacteria to work. 4. The nitrification and denitrification bacteria need to be “old” to work efficiently. They need a surface to attach, because if not they flow with the water and they leave the system. And four possible solutions for the system are presented: 1. Phosphate should be added to the system to let bacteria growth. 2. Store the water at a store pond during the winter months and transport it to the system when the temperature is optimum for the bacteria to work. 3. Add carbon matter to improve the carbon oxidation and to low down the oxygen levels at the anoxic ponds. 4. Two options are presented to improve the system, the first one is based on the construction of a dark wavy bottom in the channel system, which will give a surface for bacteria to attaché, it will produce oxygenation in the water, and it will also improve the water temperature; and the second one is based on the addition of panels made of black material, which will give to bacteria a surface to attach, and improve the water temperature...|$|E

40|$|The {{antifouling}} paint Fabi 3959 is {{painted on the}} hulls of vessels to avoid fouling caused by marine organisms attached to surfaces. The paint is registered for use on pleasure boats and other vessels weighing over 200 kg which are mainly running on the Swedish west coast (www. kemi. se). Fabi 3959 contains copper as its active component, which is highly toxic to marine organisms and thus classified as a biocide. Fabi {{antifouling paint}} was tested under laboratory conditions on the red macro alga Ceramium tenuicorne, in natural brackish water taken from the Baltic Sea. The Ceramium growth inhibition-test was performed using cloned algae exposed to <b>leakage</b> <b>water</b> with and without sediment. The samples containing only water held concentrations {{in the range of}} 0. 11 % of volume- 18 % of volume per liter, while the samples using sediment held doses measuring between 0. 11 % of volume- 36 % of volume <b>leakage</b> <b>water</b> per liter. The study showed a growth inhibiting effect on the Ceramium in both water and sediment samples down to the lowest concentration used in the test. There was a difference between the water series and the sediment series in the EC 50 values of the <b>leakage</b> <b>water.</b> The mean EC 50 value was almost 10 times lower within the sediment series compared to the water series (0. 114 ± 0. 10 and 1. 024 ± 0. 75, respectively). This indicates that the sediment series are more toxic to Ceramium than the water series. However, if the mean values of EC 50 are expressed as copper-concentration, there is no clear difference between the two series (0. 59 ± 0. 13 µg/l for the sediment series and 0. 62 ± 0. 12 µg/l for the water series). Apparently, the test did not indicate that the sediment was absorbing the copper. Instead it cannot be excluded that another substance involved could have a growth inhibiting impact on Ceramium.    Båtbottenfärgen Fabi 3959 målas på fartygsskrov för att undvika påväxt av marina organismer. Färgen är registrerad att användas på fritidsbåtar och andra fartyg med en egenvikt på över 200 kg och med huvudsaklig fart på Västkusten (www. kemi. se). Den aktiva komponenten i Fabi 3959 är koppar, vilket är mycket giftigt för marina organismer och därför klassificeras den som en biocid. Fabi båtbottenfärg testades i laborativ miljö, på den röda makroalgen Ceramium tenuicorne i naturligt brackvatten från Östersjön. Ett tillväxthämningstest utfördes på Ceramium-kloner vilka exponerades för lakvatten i bägare med och utan sediment. Proverna endast innehållande vatten bestod av koncentrationer i intervallen 0, 11 - 18 volym% per liter medan proverna med sedimentvatten hade koncentrationer på 0, 11 - 36 volym% per liter. Studien visade på en signifikant tillväxthämningseffekt på Ceramium i både vatten och sediment, ner till den lägsta använda koncentrationen. Det förelåg en tydlig skillnad mellan vattenserierna och sedimentserierna med avseende på resultaten av EC 50 -värdena på lakvattnet; EC 50 -värdena av den toxiska nivån för lakvattnet visade sig ligga tio gånger lägre i sedimentserierna än i vattenserierna (0, 114 ± 0, 10 i sediment och 1, 024 ± 0, 75 i vatten). Medelvärdena av EC 50 för koppar visar inte någon påtaglig skillnad mellan serierna (0, 59 ± 0, 13 µg/l för sediment 0, 62 ± 0, 12 µg/l för vatten). Testet indikerade därmed inte att sedimentet absorberade koppar. Istället föreligger en möjlighet att en annan substans orsakade tillväxthämning på Ceramium. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Modeling Leakage rate {{in water}} supply {{networks}} is important due to some problems namely: quality of service, {{the cost of}} system expansion and wasting energy resources. Monitoring the pressure {{in certain parts of}} network and then finding a relation between pressure changes and leakage rate is a quick way for detecting leakage. This relation is nonlinear and complex for modeling and there exist some problems related to mathematically modeling of it by hydraulic fundamentals. Thus, regarding to the abilities of soft-computing methods for modeling nonlinear processes, it seems they are very useful to apply in this field. Consequently, in this study, a procedure for developing fuzzy models is introduced that employs Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) for optimizing them in terms of accuracy and complexity. Two water supply networks located in Kerman Province (Iran) are considered as case studies in order to illustrate the efficiency of our modeling procedure. Simulation results apparently show, applying proposed method results in achieving compact and accurate fuzzy models for estimating leakage rate.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, water stress has been {{imminent}} in most municipalities around the world. The problem of water losses from pipelines {{is a major concern}} due to the increasing demands. Leakage is normally responsible for a large percentage of water losses in distribution systems and results in enormous wastage of valuable resources and energy. Leaks may be developed in many forms and locations in the system and active leak detections are required to find and repair damaged pipes. Few studies have been done on the soil-leak interaction in real pipeline systems. Recent research have shown that the high velocity water jets entering the surrounding soil causes a fluidisation zone outside leaks. The fluidised zone of soil and water is responsible for dissipating most of the energy of the water jet from the pipe leak and thus, limiting the leak's ability to reach soil surface. In municipalities where active leak detections are not implemented, it is easier for municipalities to detect leaks if they appear on the surface and thus, it is crucial to understand the routes of water leaks and the factors causing them to appear above the ground. This study investigated the soil-leak interaction focusing mainly on factors affecting leakage flow paths in water distribution systems. An experimental set up was designed and built to study the different factors in a controlled environment. A series of experiments were performed where water jets from manufactured circular leaks were released in different trench set ups. Three main variables were investigated namely flow rate, leak orientation and in-situ soil to start understanding the movement of the leak flow as a preliminary study. The volumetric moisture content were measured using EC- 5 moisture sensors at different locations in the tank to analyse the movement of <b>leakage</b> <b>water</b> and iPERLS smart water meters were used to measure the flow of water through the walls of the trench. The results of the experiments showed how much <b>leakage</b> <b>water</b> is actually lost through the side and bottom walls. The volumetric moisture content readings indicated the movement of the leak in the tank. The results of the study indicated that leak orientation has the greatest influence on the paths of the leaks. Also, the flow rate had to be increased to a very high value so that the leak appears above the sand surface. The permeability of the in-situ soil was found to have the least effect on the leakage flow paths...|$|E
