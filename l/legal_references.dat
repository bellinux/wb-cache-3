50|$|Mound Station was {{established}} as a post office in 1860; the Village of Mound Station incorporated December 23, 1901. In 1903, the post office name changed to Timewell, to avoid confusion with the town of Mounds, Illinois. The Timewell name has supplanted the original name of Mound Station in local use, but the legal village name has never changed. Thus <b>legal</b> <b>references</b> in U.S. Census Bureau products as well as lists from the Illinois Secretary of State's Office continue to show Mound Station, while the local Post Office continues as Timewell.|$|E

The author provides clear commentary explaining the "hows and whys" of good <b>legal</b> <b>referencing</b> and writing. There is a highly valued chapter of examples and exercises which show students how to identify and avoid plagiarism in legal or other writing. The author also discusses referencing in compliance with the Australian Guide to Legal Citation, now in its third edition. Referencing to social media such as Twitter, Facebook, e-books and apps is discussed and 'how to' examples provided. Ancillary exercises including solutions will further support learning.

50|$|Apart {{from the}} annual {{meetings}} of the General Assembly the GSLA organises or takes part in meetings and conferences relating to its field of interest in varying intervals.

Due to the great geographical distance between South Africa and Germany a focal point for this is formed by the association's web site. It contains an extensive collection of legal links on South Africa as well as links with information on German law in English. An emphasis is placed on a collection of <b>legal</b> <b>references</b> as well as information on academic and professional matters.|$|E
5000|$|For {{research}} and statistical data [...] "marijuana" [...] generally {{refers to the}} dried leaves and flowering tops (herbal cannabis), with by-products such as hashish or hash oil being uniquely defined. Many <b>legal</b> <b>references</b> prefer the term [...] "cannabis", for instance in the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. However, many laws and regulations often use the term [...] "marihuana" [...] or [...] "marijuana", for instance the Controlled Substances Act in the United States and the Marihuana for Medical Purposes Regulations in Canada. Cannabis reform organizations, such as the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws and Marijuana Policy Project, alongside political organizations like Help End Marijuana Prohibition Party of Australia and the Marijuana Party of Canada, also use this term.|$|E

5000|$|In the U.S., {{financial}} assistance for food purchasing for low- and no-income people is provided through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), {{formerly known as}} the Food Stamp Program. This federal aid program is administered by the Food and Nutrition Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, but benefits are distributed by the individual U.S. states. It is historically and commonly known as the Food Stamp Program, though all <b>legal</b> <b>references</b> to [...] "stamp" [...] and [...] "coupon" [...] have been replaced by [...] "EBT" [...] and [...] "card," [...] referring to the refillable, plastic Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) cards that replaced the paper [...] "food stamp" [...] coupons. To be eligible for SNAP benefits, the recipients must have incomes below 130 percent of the poverty line, and also own few assets. Since the economic downturn began in 2008, the use of food stamps has increased.|$|E
5000|$|Drew became Queen's Serjeant in 1596, and {{was much}} {{employed}} {{about this time}} by the Privy Council in the examination of political prisoners and in various <b>legal</b> <b>references.</b> The Devon historian Tristram Risdon (d.1640), writing some fifteen years after Drew's death, stated that his [...] "knowledge and counsel won him a general love". His death on 22 April 1598 {{appears to have been}} sudden, and is ascribed by John Chamberlain, in a letter dated 4 May 1598, to gaol fever caught while riding the northern circuit with Mr. Justice Beaumont, who also died on the same day. His will was signed, probably in extremis, on 25 April 1598, and was proved in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury on 16 May 1598. Drew sold his paternal seat of Sharpham for £2,250 and erected a mansion at Killerton in the parish of Broadclyst, Devon, on the site of monastic buildings. Here he lived, and was buried in the parish church of St John, in which a sumptuous monument remains in the south aisle, erected to his and his wife's memory in 1622, with a Latin inscription in prose and verse.|$|E
5000|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} consists partly of {{the ruined}} remains of institutions, and in finds of inscriptions {{and the long}} cyst burials that are characteristic of post-Roman Christian Britons. These long cyst burials occur in the southern Scottish lowlands, Wales, and the West Country of England. The grave is lined with stones, there are no grave goods, they often have an east-west orientation, and they date from a time before churches were commonly attached to cemeteries. They contrast with Anglo-Saxon burials, which followed a different inhumation custom. [...] The records of transactions and <b>legal</b> <b>references</b> provide information {{on the status of}} the clergy and its institutions. Landed proprietorship was the basis of support and income for all clerical communities, exploiting agriculture (crops), herding (sheep, pigs, goats), infrastructure (barns, threshing floors), and employing stewards to supervise the labour. Lands that were not adjacent to the communities provided income in the form of (in effect) a business of landlordship. Lands under clerical proprietorship were exempt from the fiscal demands of kings and secular lords. They had the power of nawdd (protection, as from legal process) and were noddfa (a [...] "nawdd place" [...] or sanctuary). Clerical power was moral and spiritual, and this was sufficient to enforce recognition of their status and to demand compensation for any infringement on their rights and privileges.|$|E
