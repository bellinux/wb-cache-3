50|$|The {{original}} lighthouse had its <b>lantern</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on top of}} the lightkeeper's brick house. This {{was destroyed}} in 1897. It was replaced in 1900 with a metal skeletal tower. The light station was deactivated in 1913.|$|R
50|$|The first North Head Lighthouse on the {{northern}} side of the Saldanha Bay entrance, in South Africa, was a 300mm AGA acetylene gas <b>lantern</b> <b>mounted</b> on a square concrete pillar, installed on December 7, 1939. It had a small diaphone fog signal.|$|R
5000|$|Alternatively, floating/barge <b>mounted</b> <b>pumps</b> can be {{installed}} along with associated piping on the reservoir bed to pump water from the reservoir's dead storage into left and right bank canals and the approach channel of the existing pump house of Hyderabad water supply scheme during drought years. During the good monsoon years, when the reservoir water level is above the dead storage level, the same barge <b>mounted</b> <b>pumps</b> can be used regularly to pump water into the existing high level (flood flow) canal (near [...] ) located on the left bank of the reservoir in Nalgonda district. Similarly, during the good monsoon years, a lift irrigation scheme can be taken up {{with the help of}} the same barge <b>mounted</b> <b>pumps</b> to lift water from the reservoir (near [...] ) by 45 m height for irrigating nearly 200,000 acres of uplands situated adjacent to the reservoir in Guntur district. Thus all the installed barge <b>mounted</b> mobile <b>pump</b> houses can be used for regular pumping needs to maximise the water use from the reservoir every year.|$|R

40|$|Lecturepg. 69 Under extreme conditions, pumps may be {{required}} to withstand severe nozzle loads, which often exceed the API 610 specified values. To meet these requirements, pump mechanical behavior versus nozzle loads must be examined in detail. Others have discussed shaft end displacement of centerline <b>mounted</b> <b>pumps</b> under nozzle loads. However, the subject of stresses on the pedestal bolts and casing is a critical area that must also be analyzed. An in-depth study was made on the deformation and stress analysis of centerline <b>mounted</b> end suction <b>pumps,</b> whose stiffness were relatively low and were frequently required to withstand rather high nozzle loads. The nozzle load analysis consisted of deformation and stress measurements, combined with finite element calculation. The analysis resulted in a versatile empirical formula for end suction, centerline <b>mounted</b> <b>pumps</b> {{that can be used to}} estimate the shaft end displacement, pedestal bolt stress and casing stress for arbitrary nozzle loads. This allows the determination of whether or not specified nozzle loading conditions can be tolerated by a given pump and pump support design...|$|R

5000|$|The complex {{consists}} of twin 29-storey (92 m) triangular brick towers, with a broad, terraced podium at their bases. One {{level of the}} podium contains an indoor mall. The Crossways was designed in the Brutalist style by architects Webb Zerafa MenkÃ¨s Housden Partnership and built by Consolidated Building Corporation. It was completed in 1974 as a 111,480-square-metre (1.2 million square feet) mixed-use project. The mall's interior was a cohesive series of spaces characterized by strong 1970s design features such as walls clad in brick from floor to ceiling, brown brick floor tiles, lacquered and evenly spaced wood slat ceilings, and massive globe-light <b>lanterns</b> <b>mounted</b> onto the walls.

50|$|On the road, {{the easiest}} {{approach}} to a flat tire, should a spare inner tube be available, is to replace the tube. The wheel is removed, the tire levered from the rim and inspected for causes of damage, and the inner tube replaced and wheel inflated.

The CO2 cartridge is generally a single use item only while the pump can be used to inflate many flat tires. The inner tube may then be repaired at a later date.|$|R
50|$|Only {{eight out}} of the twelve lamps on each face are used in normal operation. They are rated at 30 volts 200 watts, but run at 25 volts 150 watts to provide {{increased}} service life. The other four lamps are 6 volts 28.5 watts and are used only as emergency lamps. Such emergencies may be loss of mains electric power or, far less likely, the complete failure of the main lamp banks. The four lamps {{in each of the}} two main banks are connected in series, which gives each unit the same intensity; however, if one lamp fails, all four in that bank go out. The four emergency lamps on each face are also connected in series in sets of two. Power is provided by emergency batteries.
