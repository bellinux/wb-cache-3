50|$|Lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) is a rodent-borne viral {{infectious}} disease that presents as aseptic meningitis, encephalitis or meningoencephalitis. Its causative agent is the <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> <b>virus</b> (LCMV), {{a member of}} the family Arenaviridae. The name was coined by Charles Armstrong in 1934.|$|E

The generation of lethal reassortants from nonlethal parent viruses likely has implications for understanding the outbreaks of unanticipated virulent disease within a viral family...|$|R
50|$|The first arenavirus, <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> <b>virus</b> (LCMV), was {{isolated}} in 1933 by Charles Armstrong during {{a study of}} an epidemic in St. Louis. Although {{not the cause of}} the outbreak, LCMV was found to be a cause of nonbacterial or aseptic meningitis.|$|E
50|$|Pet rodents are {{not known}} to be natural {{reservoirs}} for <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> <b>virus.</b> However, pets can become vectors if {{they are exposed to}} wild house mice in a breeding facility, pet store, or home. Such infections are rare. To date, documented infections in humans have occurred only after introduction to infected mice, guinea pigs, and hamsters, with the majority of cases transmitted by mice. LCMV infection in other animals, including zoo animals, may be possible.|$|E
5000|$|During the 1930s, {{he studied}} on a {{fellowship}} at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in Princeton, New Jersey mentored by Richard Shope, performing research on vaccines and viruses, including pseudorabies virus and <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> <b>virus</b> (LCM). [...] During his {{stay in the}} United States, Traub {{and his wife were}} listed as members of the German American Bund, a pro-Nazi German-American club thirty miles west of Plum Island in Yaphank, Long Island, from 1934 to 1935.|$|E
40|$|Transgenic mice {{have been}} {{constructed}} expressing high (CD 45 RABC) and low (CD 45 R 0) molecular weight CD 45 isoforms on a CD 45 / background. Phenotypic analysis and in vivo challenge of these mice with influenza and <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> <b>viruses</b> shows that T cell differentiation and peripheral T cell function {{are related to the}} level of CD 45 expression but not to which CD 45 isoform is expressed. In contrast, B cell differentiation is not restored, irrespective of the level of expression of a single isoform. All CD 45 trangenic mice have T cells with an activated phenotype and increased T cell turnover. These effects are more prominent in CD 8 than CD 4 cells. The transgenic mice share several properties with humans expressing variant CD 45 alleles and provide a model to understand immune function in variant individuals...|$|R
50|$|Arenaviruses can {{be divided}} into two serogroups, which differ genetically and by {{geographical}} distribution:When the virus is classified “Old World” this means it was found in the Eastern Hemisphere in places such as Europe, Asia, and Africa. When it is found in the Western Hemisphere, in places such as Argentina, Bolivia, Venezuela, Brazil, and the United States, it is classified “New World”. <b>Lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> (LCM) <b>virus</b> is the only Arenavirus to exist in both areas but is classified as an Old World virus.|$|R
40|$|<b>Lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> (LCM) <b>virus,</b> Traub strain, was {{purified}} from BHK- 21 {{tissue culture}} medium. The virus was then analyzed by equilibrium centrifugation and rate zonal centrifugation in sucrose gradients. A buoyant density in sucrose of 1. 18 g/ml was found and the S 20, w value {{was estimated to}} be about 470 to 500 S. Furthermore, the 3 H-uridine-labeled ribonucleic acid (RNA) from virus was extracted from LCM virus and analyzed by rate zonal centrifugation. Two major and one minor single-stranded RNA components were found with sedimentation coefficients of 28, 22, and 18 S...|$|R
50|$|IL-21 {{may be a}} {{critical}} factor in the control of persistent viral infections. IL-21 (or IL-21R) knock-out mice infected with chronic LCMV (<b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> <b>virus)</b> were not able to overcome chronic infection compared to normal mice. Besides, these mice with impaired IL-21 signaling had more dramatic exhaustion of LCMV-specific CD8+ T cells, suggesting that IL-21 produced by CD4+ T cells is required for sustained CD8+ T cell effector activity and then, for maintaining immunity to resolve persistent viral infection. Thus, IL-21 may contribute to the mechanism by which CD4+ T helper cells orchestrate the immune system response to viral infections.|$|E
50|$|Arenaviruses are enveloped, single-stranded, bisegmented RNA viruses with {{antisense}} genomes. Based {{on their}} antigenic properties, arenaviruses have been classified into two major groups: the Old World arena viruses, and the New World arenaviruses. Old World arena viruses include <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> <b>virus,</b> and Lassa virus. New world arena viruses are further {{broken down into}} three clades, A, B, and C. The Guanarito arena virus belongs to clade B and {{is the cause of}} VHF. On the biosafety level scale of one to four, with four causing the most risk, the viruses causing hemorrhagic fevers have been assigned a four by the CDC.|$|E
50|$|Unlike most enveloped viruses {{which use}} clathrin coated pits for {{cellular}} entry and bind to their receptors in a pH dependent fashion, Lassa and <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> <b>virus</b> instead use an endocytotic pathway independent of clathrin, caveolin, dynamin and actin. Once within the cell the viruses are rapidly delivered to endosomes via vesicular trafficking albeit {{one that is}} largely independent of the small GTPases Rab5 and Rab7. On contact with the endosome pH-dependent membrane fusion occurs mediated by the envelope glycoprotein, which at the lower pH of the endosome binds the lysosome protein LAMP1 which results in membrane fusion and escape from the endosome.|$|E
40|$|<b>Lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> (LCM) <b>virus</b> was {{observed}} by electron microscopy in thin sections of infected tissue cultures. The particles were pleomorphic and varied greatly in size. The smaller particles (50 to 200 nm) {{appeared to be}} spherical, whereas the largest (over 200 nm) were often cup-shaped. All particles contained one to eight or more electron-dense granules which were removed by ribonuclease. The particles were formed by budding from the plasma membrane and appeared to have spikes. The morphological evidence suggests that LCM {{should be considered as}} belonging to the presently unclassified group of lipoprotein-enveloped ribonucleic acid viruses...|$|R
50|$|Viruses are {{the most}} common cause of aseptic {{meningitis}}. Most cases of viral meningitis are caused by enteroviruses (common stomach viruses). However, other viruses can also cause viral meningitis. For instance, West Nile virus, mumps, measles, herpes simplex types I and II, varicella, and <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> (LCM) <b>virus.</b> Based on clinical symptoms, viral meningitis cannot be reliably differentiated from bacterial meningitis, although viral meningitis typically follows a more benign clinical course. Viral meningitis has no evidence of bacteria present in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). Therefore, lumbar puncture with CSF analysis is often needed to identify the disease.|$|R
40|$|Three {{patients}} who received visceral-organ transplants from a single donor {{on the same day}} died of a febrile illness 4 to 6 weeks after transplantation. Culture, polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) and serologic assays, and oligonucleotide microarray analysis {{for a wide range of}} infectious agents were not informative. We evaluated RNA obtained from the liver and kidney transplant recipients. Unbiased high-throughput sequencing was used to identify microbial sequences not found by means of other methods. The specificity of sequences for a new candidate pathogen was confirmed by means of culture and by means of PCR, immunohistochemical, and serologic analyses. High-throughput sequencing yielded 103, 632 sequences, of which 14 represented an Old World arenavirus. Additional sequence analysis showed that this new arenavirus was related to <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> <b>viruses.</b> Specific PCR assays based on a unique sequence confirmed the presence of the virus in the kidneys, liver, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid of the recipients. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed arenavirus antigen in the liver and kidney transplants in the recipients. IgM and IgG antiviral antibodies were detected in the serum of the donor. Seroconversion was evident in serum specimens obtained from one recipient at two time points...|$|R
5000|$|ADAR1 {{is known}} to be proviral in other circumstances. ADAR1’s A to I editing has been found in many viruses {{including}} measles virus, influenza virus, <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> <b>virus,</b> polyomavirus, hepatitis delta virus, and hepatitis C virus. [...] Although ADAR1 has been seen in other viruses, it has only been studied extensively in a few; one of those is measles virus (MV). Research done on MV has shown that ADAR1 enhances viral replication. This is done through two different mechanisms: RNA editing and inhibition of dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR). [...] Specifically, viruses are thought to use ADAR1 as a positive replication factor by selectively suppressing dsRNA-dependent and antiviral pathways.|$|E
50|$|An arenavirus is a virus {{which is}} a member of the family Arenaviridae. These viruses infect rodents and {{occasionally}} humans; arenaviruses have also been discovered which infect snakes. At least eight arenaviruses are known to cause human disease. The diseases derived from arenaviruses range in severity. Aseptic meningitis, a severe human disease that causes inflammation covering the brain and spinal cord, can arise from the <b>Lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> <b>virus</b> (LCMV) infection. Hemorrhagic fever syndromes are derived from infections such as Guanarito virus (GTOV), Junin virus (JUNV), Lassa virus (LASV), Lujo virus (LUJV), Machupo virus (MACV), Sabia virus (SABV), or Whitewater Arroyo virus (WWAV). Arenaviruses are divided into two groups: the Old World and the New World viruses. The differences between these groups are distinguished geographically and genetically. Because of the epidemiological association with rodents, some arenaviruses and bunyaviruses are designated as roboviruses.|$|E
50|$|For {{infants with}} {{suspected}} congenital Zika virus disease, the CDC recommends testing with both serologic and molecular assays such as RT-PCR, IgM ELISA and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). RT-PCR of the infants serum and urine {{should be performed}} {{in the first two}} days of life. Newborns with a mother who was potentially exposed and who have positive blood tests, microcephaly or intracranial calcifications should have further testing including a thorough physical investigation for neurologic abnormalities, dysmorphic features, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and rash or other skin lesions. Other recommended tests are cranial ultrasound, hearing evaluation, and eye examination. Testing should be done for any abnormalities encountered as well as for other congenital infections such as syphilis, toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus infection, <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> <b>virus</b> infection, and herpes simplex virus. Some tests should be repeated up to 6 months later as there can be delayed effects, particularly with hearing.|$|E
40|$|In some {{apparently}} healthy mice the <b>virus</b> of <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> persisted for {{a considerable}} period of time after recovery, in the blood, urine, and nasal secretions, while in other mice it soon became undemonstrable. It {{is possible that the}} persistence of the virus is due to lesions in the lungs, liver, and kidneys. The immunity to <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> in mice does not seem to depend upon the presence of virus in the blood and the organs tested. No antivirus was detected in sera from several solidly immune mice, which fact suggests that circulating antivirus plays no important part in their immunity. Leucocytes also seem to be no essential factor in this immunity, which probably is closely linked with the tissues. The urine of guinea pigs which had recovered from severe attacks of <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> contained <b>virus</b> for a few weeks after recovery, while that from mild cases contained no virus. Virus was never demonstrated in the blood of immune guinea pigs. Antivirus was readily detected in it...|$|R
40|$|Persistent infections were {{established}} in suspension cultures of BHK 21 / 13 S cells with both Parana and <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> <b>viruses.</b> Four generations after infection with either virus, more than 90 % of the cells scored as infective centers, with concomitant peaks in extracellular virus yields. In both cultures the synthesis of detectable plaque-forming units (PFU) ceased about the 50 th generation postinfection, and this condition was maintained until the 350 th cell generation when the cultures were discontinued. The generation time of each culture was identical to that of uninfected parent controls, and at no time were cytopathic effects evident. In spite {{of the absence of}} infectivity, over 90 % of the cells sampled at various times contained viral antigen demonstrable by immunofluorescence. When either of these persistently infected cell lines was substituted for normal cells in the standard plaque assay, very low efficiencies of plating were observed for homotypic and heterotypic viruses. Plaque formation by several heterologous viruses was virtually unaffected. The mechanism of homotypic plaque exclusion in both cell lines was shown to occur beyond the virion adsorption stage. The original infecting virus genome persisted in both cell lines after standard virus was no longer detectable. This was shown with the <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> virus-infected cells after storage in liquid nitrogen. After thawing, such cells were found to synthesize standard virus for a brief period. Although the Parana virus-infected cells did not behave this way, the growth medium from these cells would initiate PFU synthesis in normal cells within 36 hr after infection...|$|R
40|$|Infection of BHK- 21 {{cells with}} <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> (LCM) <b>virus</b> {{resulted}} {{in the production of}} significant titers of complement-fixing (CF) antigen. The antigen was spontaneously released from the cells, but the highest titer of 1 : 16 was recovered by disruption of the infected cells by freeze-thawing in tryptose phosphate broth. The antigen could be partially separated from infectious virus by centrifugation. Furthermore, it was possible to detect LCM virus infection of cell cultures by the production of the CF antigen, but this method proved less sensitive than titration by intracerebral inoculation of mice. The CF antigen from cell cultures was at least as sensitive and specific as the reference antigen prepared from infected guinea pig spleen...|$|R
50|$|In 2010 {{scientists}} at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich showed that LAG3 was an exhaustion marker for CD8+ T cells specific for <b>Lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> <b>virus,</b> but alone {{did not significantly}} contribute to T-cell exhaustion. Scientists the University Hospital Brno showed that LAG3 is a prognostic indicator of poor treatment outcomes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. A team at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute showed that CD8+ Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes that were specific for NY-ESO-1 were negatively regulated by LAG-3 and PD-1 in ovarian cancer. The St. Jude Children's Research Hospital group reported that most LAG3 was housed intracellularly in multiple domains before rapid translocation to the cell surface potentially facilitated by the microtubule organizing center and recycling endosomes during T-cell activation. Scientists at the Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori in Milan, collaborating with the Triebel group, showed that LAG3 defines a potent regulatory T cell subset that shows up more frequently in cancer patients and is expanded at tumor sites. Geneticists working at the National Cancer Institute reported that SNPs in the LAG3 gene were associated with higher risk of multiple myeloma.|$|E
50|$|The Lassa virus gains {{entry into}} the host cell {{by means of the}} cell-surface {{receptor}} the alpha-dystroglycan (alpha-DG),a versatile receptor for proteins of the extracellular matrix. It shares this receptor with the prototypic Old World arenavirus <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> <b>virus.</b> Receptor recognition depends on a specific sugar modification of alpha-dystroglycan by a group of glycosyltransferases known as the LARGE proteins. Specific variants of the genes encoding these proteins appear to be under positive selection in West Africa where Lassa is endemic. Alpha-dystroglycan is also used as a receptor by viruses of the New World clade C arenaviruses (Oliveros and Latino viruses). In contrast, the New World arenaviruses of clades A and B, which include the important viruses Machupo, Guanarito, Junin, and Sabia in addition to the non pathogenic Amapari virus, use the transferrin receptor 1. A small aliphatic amino acid at the GP1 glycoprotein amino acid position 260 is required for high-affinity binding to alpha-DG. In addition, GP1 amino acid position 259 also appears to be important, since all arenaviruses showing high-affinity alpha-DG binding possess a bulky aromatic amino acid (tyrosine or phenylalanine) at this position.|$|E
40|$|Two {{epizootics}} of <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> <b>virus</b> in mice {{occurred within}} two months in one research facility consisting of several widely separated rooms. These outbreaks developed despite intensive institutional monitoring policies designed to prevent introduction and spread of <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> <b>virus.</b> Evidence derived from serological and virological assays and interviews with the concerned investigators suggested that a single transplantable tumor carried in mice may {{have been responsible for}} spread of the virus. However, the tumor was not contaminated with <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> <b>virus</b> {{at the time of its}} introduction into the mouse facility. The origin of the virus responsible for the outbreaks was not definitively established although data supported an hypothesis that the virus was introduced into the research facility by a wild or feral mouse. Virus spread from infected mice to humans did not occur, as measured by serological tests. However, a large and valuable animal facility was depopulated for safety reasons. Absorption of sera with <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> <b>virus</b> antigen proved a necessary and reliable method for confirming specificity of <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> <b>virus</b> fluorescence-positive reactions...|$|E
40|$|Infection of H- 2 -identical mice {{with either}} <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> (LCM) <b>virus,</b> vaccinia virus, or paramyxo (Sendai) virus {{resulted}} in the generation of specifically sensitized cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). CTL generated in vitro against 2, 4, 6 -trinitrophenyl (TNP) -conjugated syngeneic stimulator cells were specifically cytotoxic for TNP-conjugated H- 2 K(D) region identical targets. Both LCM and vaccinia-induced CTL, however, {{were found to be}} strongly cytotoxic towards TNP-conjugated, H- 2 K(D) region-identical target cells. In contrast, Sendai virus-induced CTL did not lyse TNP-conjugated, syngeneic target cells. Inhibition experiments using cold targets suggested that shared antigenic determinants can be detected on either LCM virus-infected and TNP-conjugated targets, which are not present on the cell surface 6 f normal target cells. ...|$|R
40|$|The anti-viral {{activity}} of secondary effector cells generated in vitro against ectromelia virus infection was investigated. Depending upon {{the order of}} administration of cells and virus, 2 X 10 (6) cells significantly reduce virus titres in recipient mice. Mice injected with <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> (LCM) <b>virus</b> are not protected by secondary effector cells against ectromelia virus infection and vice versa. The cells conferring anti-viral activity are sensitive to anti-theta and complement treatment, and must share H- 2 K or H- 2 D region genes with the recipients in order for significant reduction of virus titres to occur. The possibility of exploiting this approach in clinical medicine by using T cell-mediated mechanisms against certain viral infections is briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|Spleen {{cells from}} CBA/H mice pre-primed {{intravenously}} at various intervals with <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> (LCM) <b>virus</b> were tested for {{their capacity to}} respond and generate cytotoxic effector T cells on secondary stimulation both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro secondary stimulation was performed by culturing preprimed spleen cells with infected, syngeneic, peritoneal `stimulator' cells for periods of up to 7 days at 37 °. Controls were incubated with uninfected `stimulators'. In vivo secondary stimulation was obtained by intravenous transfer of pre-primed spleen cells into irradiated, heavily infected CBA/H recipients at various times prior to assay of recipients' spleens.

40|$|<b>Lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> <b>virus</b> is a rodent-borne arenavirus {{that can}} cause {{congenital}} infection affecting the developing cen-tral nervous system. When the infection occurs during pregnancy, the virus targets the fetal brain and retina, potentially causing ventriculomegaly, hydrocephalus, chorioretinitis, and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. It has been previously suggested that <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> <b>virus</b> {{be added to the}} list of congenital infections currently included in the TORCH acronym (tox-oplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes, and syphilis). We present 2 neonates with antenatally known ventriculomegaly that were diagnosed with congenital <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> <b>virus</b> infection after birth. In addition to ventriculomegaly, one had nonimmune hydrops fetalis and the other had intracranial hemorrhage. In view of the seroprevalence of lymphocytic choriome-ningitis virus (4. 7 %- 10 %), our findings suggest that screening for congenital <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> <b>virus</b> infection should be considered in fetuses and newborns with ventriculomegaly as well as other abnormal neuroimaging findings such as intracranial hemorrhage...|$|E

40|$|By {{means of}} the {{indirect}} fluorescent-antibody test, cross serological reactivity was demonstrated between <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>choriomeningitis</b> (LCM) <b>virus</b> and the viruses of the Tacaribe complex. Antisera to {{all members of the}} Tacaribe complex reacted with LCM virus; LCM antisera gave significant staining of Amapari virus, but minimal or inconsistent reactions with Tacaribe virus, and no reaction with two other viruses of the Tacaribe complex. A low level cross-reaction was observed in complement fixation tests of Machupo and Pichinde antisera against LCM antigen. Immunization with Tacaribe and Amapari viruses did not protect mice against challenge with LCM virus. Because of the identical appearance of the virions, the sharing of antigens, and the many biological similarities between LCM and the Tacaribe complex viruses, it is proposed that they be considered as constituting a new taxonomic group of viruses...|$|R
