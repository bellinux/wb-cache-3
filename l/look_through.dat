5|$|It is {{possible}} to <b>look</b> <b>through</b> the history of biology from the ancient Greeks onwards and discover anticipations of almost all of Charles Darwin's key ideas. For example, Loren Eiseley has found isolated passages written by Buffon suggesting he was almost ready to piece together a theory of natural selection, but states that such anticipations {{should not be taken}} out of the full context of the writings or of cultural values of the time which made Darwinian ideas of evolution unthinkable.|$|E
5|$|On 20 August 1839 Meyerbeer, whilst {{relaxing}} at Boulogne in {{the company}} of Moscheles, {{met for the first time}} with Richard Wagner, who was en route to Paris. Their ensuing relationship (see below) was to have major repercussions for the careers and reputations of both. At this meeting Wagner read to Meyerbeer from the libretto of Rienzi, and Meyerbeer agreed to <b>look</b> <b>through</b> the score, which indeed he subsequently recommended for performance at Dresden.|$|E
5|$|Stealth {{is based}} on {{limiting}} the player character's visibility; hiding behind objects and buildings, avoiding the enemies' cone of vision, and avoiding lighted areas aid in reducing detection. When hiding behind an object, the player can lean around the sides to see the immediate area and eavesdrop, {{and as long as}} Corvo remains hidden, his enemies will not see him. The player can also <b>look</b> <b>through</b> keyholes to gain insight into closed rooms. Sneaking up behind enemies allows the player to silently subdue them, and unconscious or dead bodies can be moved and hidden.|$|E

5|$|Suriname-born Milton Kam, who {{had shot}} 10 feature films {{and more than}} 50 short films, {{was chosen as the}} {{director}} of photography. Since Domalpalli's experience was limited to short video films with a different aspect ratio, he was shocked to <b>look</b> <b>through</b> the Super 16mm lens the day they commenced the shoot. However, Kam helped him to stay composed during the production.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of terns cannot {{accommodate}} under water, so {{they rely}} on accurate sighting from the air before they plunge-dive. Like other seabirds that feed at the surface or dive for food, terns have red oil droplets in the cones of their retinas; birds that have to <b>look</b> <b>through</b> an air/water interface have more deeply coloured carotenoid pigments in the oil drops than other species. The pigment also improves visual contrast and sharpens distance vision, especially in hazy conditions, and helps terns to locate shoals of fish, although it is uncertain whether they are sighting the phytoplankton on which the fish feed, or other feeding birds. The red colouring reduces ultraviolet sensitivity, which in any case is an adaptation more suited to terrestrial feeders like the gulls, and this protects the eye from UV damage.|$|E
5|$|Enemy {{detection}} {{works on}} line-of-sight, with players {{being able to}} use cover or high areas out of enemies' cones of vision to stay undetected. Darkness can aid the player in staying hidden, {{but it is only}} effective at a distance. Enemy alert meters and musical cues let the player know if they've been spotted. Noise will cause enemies to go to investigate, including noise made by broken bottles or the player striking a sword against the wall; this may be used deliberately to lure guards into traps or disrupt their patrol route. Players can <b>look</b> <b>through</b> keyholes to help them survey a room before entering, and can lean to look from cover without fully exposing themselves. The player is now able to be detected if they peer out from behind a wall for too long, a feature not seen in Dishonored. To avoid detection, the player may choke people out or have their throat slit. Bodies can be carried away and concealed. Alarms can be disabled to assure that enemies are not alerted to the player's presence. Walls of Light, barriers powered by wind or whale oil, are subject to have their power turned off or be rewired so that only enemies are killed by going through them. Whale oil canisters explode on harsh impact, and can be thrown at enemies to that end.|$|E

5|$|When making observations, {{scientists}} <b>look</b> <b>through</b> telescopes, study {{images on}} electronic screens, record meter readings, and so on. Generally, on a basic level, they {{can agree on}} what they see, e.g., the thermometer shows 37.9 degrees C. But, if these scientists have different ideas about the theories {{that have been developed}} to explain these basic observations, they may disagree about what they are observing. For example, before Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, observers would have likely interpreted the image at left as five different objects in space. In light of that theory, however, astronomers will tell you that there are actually only two objects, one in the center and four different images of a second object around the sides. Alternatively, if other scientists suspect that something is wrong with the telescope and only one object is actually being observed, they are operating under yet another theory. Observations that cannot be separated from theoretical interpretation are said to be theory-laden.|$|E
25|$|The {{full range}} of {{techniques}} that are available has been summarized in a tree diagram by William Bassett. The ability to utilize any {{and all of these}} techniques hinges on being able to <b>look</b> <b>through</b> the diamonds which was first demonstrated by visual observations.|$|E

25|$|The {{decision}} in Shankar was examined {{in detail in}} an article by Lionel Leo and Chen Siyuan. The authors question how accurately the reasonable suspicion test reflects the public's perspective, given that the test requires the court to <b>look</b> <b>through</b> {{the eyes of a}} reasonable observer in court who is familiar with the relevant facts, whereas most members of the public hear things from secondary sources.|$|E
25|$|In {{his last}} film, The Sacrifice, Tarkovsky worked with cinematographer Sven Nykvist, {{who had worked}} closely with {{director}} Ingmar Bergman on many of Ingmar Bergman's films – multiple people who worked with Bergman worked on the production, notably lead actor Erland Josephson, who had acted for Tarkovsky in Nostalghia. Nykvist complained that Tarkovsky would frequently <b>look</b> <b>through</b> the camera and even direct actors through it.|$|E

25|$|Once in orbit, the {{spacecraft}} could be rotated in three directions: along its longitudinal axis (roll), {{left to right}} from the astronaut's point of view (yaw), and up or down (pitch). Movement was created by rocket-propelled thrusters which used hydrogen peroxide as a fuel. For orientation, the pilot could <b>look</b> <b>through</b> the window {{in front of him}} or from a screen connected to a periscope which could be turned 360°.|$|E

25|$|Stock Rotation is the {{practice}} of changing the way inventory is displayed on a regular basis. This is most commonly used in hospitality and retail - particularity where food products are sold. For example, {{in the case of}} supermarkets that a customer frequents on a regular basis, the customer may know exactly what they want and where it is. This results in many customers going straight to the product they seek and do not look at other items on sale. To discourage this practice, stores will rotate the location of stock to encourage customers to <b>look</b> <b>through</b> the entire store. This is in hopes the customer will pick up items they would not normally see.|$|E
25|$|The nose-gear light {{indicators}} {{were designed}} to be fail safe by having two separate light bulbs. This proved to be inadequate, as {{it was impossible to}} <b>look</b> <b>through</b> the cover to check whether one of the bulbs had been compromised, meaning that a failure of one bulb would not be detected until both bulbs malfunctioned. The first bulb was thus presumed to have gone inoperative some time before the day of the flight, while the second bulb broke during Flight 933. The NTSB therefore advised the Federal Aviation Administration to articulate means to avoid similar compromised fail-safe designs in the future. Both pilots had minimum-descent altitude light warnings, which were presumed to have given a visual warning, but because of the work overload, neither pilot directed his attention to these alerts.|$|E
25|$|Cora Lansquenet was {{an artist}} and {{collector}} of paintings from local sales. Niece Susan Banks, heir to Cora's property, goes to her cottage to clear up the possessions and prepare them for auction, {{on the day of}} the inquest into Cora's murder. Miss Gilchrist claims that Cora always painted from life, yet Susan finds one quite recent painting featuring a pier that was destroyed in the war, a view that has been published on picture postcards. The next day, after Cora's funeral, art critic Alexander Guthrie, arrives to <b>look</b> <b>through</b> Mrs Lansquenet's recent purchases as previously scheduled. He finds nothing of any value there. That evening, Miss Gilchrist is poisoned by arsenic in a slice of wedding cake apparently sent to her through the post. She ate just a small portion of it, which saved her. Inspector Morton investigates the Lansquenet murder along with Poirot.|$|E
