5000|$|One of the {{earliest}} serious and large scale attempts at an ICF driver design was the Shiva laser, a 20-beam neodymium doped glass laser system built at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) that started operation in 1978. Shiva was a [...] "proof of concept" [...] design intended to demonstrate compression of fusion fuel capsules to many times the <b>liquid</b> <b>density</b> of hydrogen. In this, Shiva succeeded and compressed its pellets to 100 times the <b>liquid</b> <b>density</b> of deuterium. However, due to the laser's strong coupling with hot electrons, premature heating of the dense plasma (ions) was problematic and fusion yields were low. This failure by Shiva to efficiently heat the compressed plasma pointed {{to the use of}} optical frequency multipliers as a solution which would frequency triple the infrared light from the laser into the ultraviolet at 351 nm. Newly discovered schemes to efficiently frequency triple high intensity laser light discovered at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics in 1980 enabled this method of target irradiation to be experimented with in the 24 beam OMEGA laser and the NOVETTE laser, which was followed by the Nova laser design with 10 times the energy of Shiva, the first design with the specific goal of reaching ignition conditions.|$|E

One common method of obtaining liquid hydrogen involves a compressor resembling a jet engine in both appearance and principle. Liquid hydrogen is typically used as a concentrated form of hydrogen storage. As in any gas, storing it as liquid takes less space than storing it as a gas at normal temperature and pressure.

50|$|Capillary action through {{synthetic}} mesh is {{the result}} of the intermolecular attraction between moisture and semi-synthetic polymers, causing a current of thermionic energy through a specific pathway within a mesh material. The combination of the adhesive forces and the surface tension that arises from cohesion produces the characteristic upward curve in a fluid, such as water. Capillarity {{is the result}} of cohesion of water molecules and adhesion of those molecules to the solid material forming the void. As the edges of the material are brought closer together, such as in a very narrow path, the interaction causes the liquid to be drawn away from the original source. The more narrow the pathway, the greater the rise of the liquid. Greater surface tension and increased ratio of adhesion to cohesion also result in greater rise.
