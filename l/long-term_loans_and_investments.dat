40|$|We {{study the}} effect of bank loans on Chinese {{publicly}} listed firms' investment decisions based on the underinvestment and overinvestment theories of leverage. Evidence from China is of particular importance because China is the world's largest emerging and transitional economy. At first we {{show that there is}} a negative relationship between bank <b>loan</b> ratios <b>and</b> <b>investment</b> for Chinese publicly listed firms. And this negative relationship is much stronger for firms with low growth than firms with high growth. Secondly, we find that both short-term <b>and</b> <b>long-term</b> <b>loan</b> ratios are negatively correlated with investment. However, the higher the <b>long-term</b> <b>loan</b> ratios are, the weaker the negative relationship between <b>long-term</b> <b>loan</b> ratios <b>and</b> <b>investment</b> is. Thirdly, firm ownership only matters to {{the effect of}} short-term bank loans on investment in our sample. That is, the negative relationship between short-term <b>loan</b> ratios <b>and</b> <b>investment</b> is weaker for SOEs than for non-SOEs. Lastly, we show that the reform of China's banking system in 2003 has not strengthened the negative relationship between bank <b>loans</b> <b>and</b> <b>investment.</b> Our findings suggest that although Chinese state-owned banks are severely intervened by government policies, they still have a disciplining role on firms' investment, especially in firms with low growth...|$|R

Regression analysis and Pearson`s correlation have been used in SPSS 16 software, in order to test the research assumptions.
