2500|$|This {{may occur}} in compact {{fluorescent}} lamps with integral electrical ballasts or in linear lamps. Ballast electronics failure is a somewhat random process that follows the standard failure profile for any electronic device. There is an initial small peak of early failures, followed by a drop and steady increase over lamp life. Life of electronics is heavily dependent on operating temperature—it typically halves for each 10nbsp&°C temperature rise. The quoted average <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lamp</b> is usually at [...] ambient (this may vary by country). The average life of the electronics at this temperature is normally greater than this, so at this temperature, not many lamps will fail due to failure of the electronics. In some fittings, the ambient temperature could be well above this, in which case failure of the electronics may become the predominant failure mechanism. Similarly, running a compact fluorescent lamp base-up will result in hotter electronics, which can cause shorter average life (particularly with higher power rated ones). Electronic ballasts should be designed {{to shut down the}} tube when the emission mix runs out as described above. In the case of integral electronic ballasts, since they never have to work again, this is sometimes done by having them deliberately burn out some component to permanently cease operation.|$|E

Department of Energy (DOE), to {{quantify}} the impacts of LED lamps, incandescent lamps and fluorescent benchmark lamps over a product lifecycle – i. e. to develop a sustainable design and manufacturing strategy that addresses product manufacturing, use, recycling and disposal scenarios for LED-based lighting. Based on the knowledge gained from extensive product tear-down studies of fluorescent and screw-in lighting products, lifecycle assessment tools, and accelerated lifecycle testing protocols, an interactive Sustainable LED Design Guide has been developed to aid architectural and lighting designers and engineers in making design decisions that consider three important environmental impacts (greenhouse gas emissions, energy use and mercury emission) across all phases {{of the life of}} an LED lighting product. Critical information developed for the lifecycle analysis and product feature comparisons is the useful life of the lighting product as well as its performance. The Design Guide is available at www. ncms. org, and was developed based on operational and durability testing of a variety of lighting products including power consumption, light output, and useful <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lamp</b> in order to allow a more realistic comparison of lamp designs. This report describes the main project tasks, results and innovative features of the lifecycle assessment (LCA) -based design tools, and the key considerations driving the sustainable design of LED lighting systems. The Design Guide incorporates the following three novel features for efficiently evaluating LED lighting features in value-chains: • Bill-of-Materials (BOM) Builder – Designers may import process data for each component and supply functional data for the product, including power, consumption, lumen output and expected useful life. • Environmental Impact Review – Designs are comparable across lifecycle phases, subsystems, and environmental impact category, and can be normalized to a userdefined functional unit. • Drill-down Review – These provide an indepth look at individual lamp designs with the ability to review across subsystem or lifecycle phase...|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} {{provides a}} voltage regulation circuit of illuminating lights, which {{is suitable for}} an illumination system which is serially composed <b>of</b> <b>a</b> main power source and an illumination load. The single-phase illumination system comprises the main power source which outputs sine alternating current voltage, and the illumination load. The voltage regulation circuit of illuminating lights is in series connection in a loop which is formed by the main power source and the illumination load, and comprises a voltage regulation circuit and an auxiliary power source. The voltage regulation circuit is used for generating auxiliary voltage to regulate amplitude of the sine alternating current voltage which is loaded on the illumination load. Power consumption of the voltage regulation circuit of illuminating lights is small, harmonic wave loaded on the illumination load is also small, so that the alternating current voltage loaded on the illumination load is still of sine curve. The normal voltage requirement loaded by the illumination system is satisfied, in particular when being inputted with sine curved voltage, twinkling <b>of</b> <b>an</b> HID <b>lamp</b> or <b>a</b> fluorescent <b>lamp</b> is reduced, the power factor is enhanced, and the service <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> illuminating <b>lamp</b> is extended. In addition, the method is also suitable for other illuminating lamps inputted with the sine curved voltage. 本发明提供一种照明灯光的电压调控电路，适用于由主电源和照明负载串接组成的照明系统中，该单相照明系统包括输出正弦交流电压的主电源和照明负载；照明灯光的电压调控电路串接在主电源和与照明负载形成的回路中，其包括调压电路和辅助电源，调压电路用以产生辅助电压，以调控加载于照明负载上的正弦交流电压的幅值。本发明的照明灯光的电压调控电路功耗较小，且在加载在照明负载的谐波也非常小，使加载在照明负载上的交流电压仍然是正弦曲线，满足照明系统负载的正常电压需求，尤其对于HID灯或荧光灯，输入正弦曲线电压减少了闪烁，提高了功率因数，延长了照明灯具的使用寿命。此外，该方法也适用于正弦曲线电压输入的其它照明灯具。Department of Electrical EngineeringInventor name used in this publication: 郑家伟, Zheng JiaweiInventor name used in this publication: 蔡伟锋, Cai WeifengInventor name used in this publication: 张自强, Zhang ZiqiangTitle in Traditional Chinese: 照明燈光的電壓調控電路Chin...|$|R
40|$|It is well {{established}} that heat transfer and convection characteristics can substantially affect the light quality as well as <b>life</b> expectancy <b>of</b> <b>a</b> discharge <b>lamp.</b> However, the present level of understanding of these processes is not adequate to guide engineering design due to the combined physical and geometrical complexities involved. Efforts have been made both experimentally and theoretically in the present work to identify the roles of different heat transfer mechanisms between the arctube and the jacket <b>of</b> <b>a</b> modern discharge <b>lamp.</b> By solving the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations and a simplified radiation model in curvilinear coordinates, good agreement between measurements and predictions {{in terms of the}} wall temperature profiles have been obtained.

2500|$|One {{measure of}} the quality <b>of</b> <b>a</b> leading edge dimmer is the [...] "rise time". The rise time {{in this context is}} the amount of time it takes for the cut part of the {{waveform}} to get from zero to the instantaneous output voltage. In the waveform above it is <b>a</b> measure <b>of</b> the slope of the almost vertical edge of the red trace. Typically it is measured in tens to hundreds <b>of</b> microseconds. <b>A</b> longer rise time reduces the noise of the dimmer and the lamp as well as extending the <b>life</b> <b>of</b> the <b>lamp.</b> <b>A</b> longer rise time also reduces the electromagnetic interference produced by the dimmer. Unsurprisingly, a longer rise time is more expensive to implement than a short one, this is because the size of choke has to be increased. Newer dimming methods can help minimize such problems.|$|R

40|$|AbstractBy {{trying to}} {{increase}} the luminosity or the <b>life</b> expectancy <b>of</b> <b>an</b> incandescent <b>lamp,</b> <b>an</b> idea consists <b>of</b> <b>a</b> series <b>of</b> successive rolling up of the tungsten filament. This gives geometrical configurations of filaments named simple, twin, or triple helical spring, etc… In this paper, we will limit only to the cases of the simple and twin helical spring filaments. Under the combined effects of the high temperature and the stresses induced by its own weight, the filament creeps by becoming plastically deformed in a permanent and a continuously manner, until the rupture. The theoretical study of the behaviour of these filaments needs the knowledge of internal efforts distribution, deformations modes, and their evolutions. The present work consists on an elastic structural analysis which must be the first step. Since the objective is also to study {{the influence of the}} filament self-weight solicitation, the orientation (or position) with respect to gravitational direction should be taken into account. Numerical results are obtained by finite element method. They showed <b>a</b> negligible influence <b>of</b> the solicitations due to the variation of the temperature with respect to those of the self-weight, and a relative sensitivity to the position changes for the twin helical spring filament. For this later, we have developed an analytical method which is only valid in the case <b>of</b> <b>a</b> vertical position. Because of some difficulties, the comparison between the numerical and analytical results could not be carried out directly. However, the analytical approach proved to be qualitatively useful for the analysis of numerical results...|$|R
