25|$|Between 1978 and 1981, {{when the}} United States and Puerto Rican economies were {{suffering}} from high inflation rates, local banks were facing losses {{due to an}} increasing number in bankruptcies and unemployment rates, and some were forced to either close, merge, or sell portions of their assets. To counter these economic conditions, Westernbank applied conservative policies and banking practices that included tightening its credit lending criteria, assuming stricter <b>loan</b> <b>to</b> <b>value</b> ratios, favoring collateralized loans, and restructuring its assets and liabilities. In 1988, facing an impending recession in the US and Puerto Rico, Westernbank began applying the same conservative measures, to reduce inherent risks and protect the bank’s capital position. During the following years, between 1989 and 1990, private and public savings banks on the island, {{with the exception of}} Westernbank, faced losses, restated their financial statements, and saw significant decreases in their stock prices.|$|E
2500|$|Securities collateralized by {{home equity}} loans (HELs) are {{currently}} the largest asset class within the ABS market. [...] Investors typically refer to HELs as any nonagency loans {{that do not}} fit into either the jumbo or alt-A loan categories. [...] While early HELs were mostly second lien subprime mortgages, first-lien loans now make {{up the majority of}} issuance. [...] Subprime mortgage borrowers have a less than perfect credit history and are required to pay interest rates higher than what would be available to a typical agency borrower. [...] In addition to first and second-lien loans, other HE loans can consist of high <b>loan</b> <b>to</b> <b>value</b> (LTV) loans, re-performing loans, scratch and dent loans, or open-ended home equity lines of credit (HELOC),which homeowners use as a method to consolidate debt.|$|E

50|$|The {{comparative}} {{analysis of the}} collateral is known as <b>loan</b> <b>to</b> <b>value</b> (LTV). <b>Loan</b> <b>to</b> <b>value</b> is a ratio of the loan amount {{to the value of}} the property. In addition, the combined <b>loan</b> <b>to</b> <b>value</b> (CLTV) is the sum of all liens against the property divided by the value. For example if the home is valued at $200,000 and the first mortgage is $100,000 with second mortgage of $50,000, the LTV is 50% while the CLTV is 75%. Naturally, the higher LTV and CLTVs increase the risk of loan. Furthermore, borrowers who contribute significant down payment (lowering the LTV) statistically have lower incidents of foreclosure.|$|E

50|$|The {{flagship}} product is a mortgage, called the 'Family Mortgage'. There are two requirements {{that need to}} be satisfied to obtain the mortgage. Firstly, the applicant must {{be able to make a}} 5 percent deposit and, secondly, this must be backed up by their relatives who must have put enough money in their accounts to cover at least 25% of the purchase price and the family's deposits act as security for the loan. Because the purpose of the deposits is to be security for the mortgage, the protection afforded by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme does not apply. Family is the first UK building society to include a payment waiver product, offered in conjunction with CUNA Mutual Group, where the mortgage repayments are met for up to six months if the mortgagor lose their job through no fault of their own. <b>To</b> enable high <b>loans</b> <b>to</b> <b>value</b> mortgages <b>to</b> be provided, Family will offer mortgage insurance products from Genworth Financial.|$|R
30|$|The <b>loan</b> <b>to</b> {{appraisal}} <b>value</b> {{ratio is}} a very important ratio since banking regulation imposes penalties in terms of weighted assets to mortgages with LTV above 80  % and even more penalties for ratios above 100  %. The ownership of appraisal firms by banks derived in perverse incentives that adjusted the appraisal <b>values</b> <b>to</b> the bank incentives, instead of reflecting the real value of the properties. This mechanism is very dangerous since delinquency rates increase exponentially with higher loan principals and, in Spain given that loans are with full recourse, households defaulting on loans will obtain lower prices than the appraisals ones (even without a burst of real estate prices).|$|R

50|$|Upon {{making a}} {{mortgage}} loan {{for the purchase}} of a property, lenders usually require that the borrower make a down payment; that is, contribute a portion {{of the cost of the}} property. This down payment may be expressed as a portion of the value of the property (see below for a definition of this term). The <b>loan</b> <b>to</b> <b>value</b> ratio (or LTV) is the size of the loan against the value of the property. Therefore, a mortgage loan in which the purchaser has made a down payment of 20% has a <b>loan</b> <b>to</b> <b>value</b> ratio of 80%. For loans made against properties that the borrower already owns, the <b>loan</b> <b>to</b> <b>value</b> ratio will be imputed against the estimated value of the property.|$|E

50|$|The loan-to-value (LTV) {{ratio is}} a {{financial}} term used by lenders {{to express the}} ratio of a <b>loan</b> <b>to</b> the <b>value</b> of an asset purchased. The term is commonly used by banks and building societies to represent {{the ratio of the}} first mortgage line {{as a percentage of the}} total appraised value of real property. For instance, if someone borrows $130,000 to purchase a house worth $150,000, the LTV ratio is $130,000 to $150,000 or $130,000/$150,000, or 87%. The remaining 13% represent the lender's haircut, adding up to 100% and being covered from the borrower's equity. The higher the LTV ratio, the riskier the loan is for a lender.|$|R

Secondly, the Government supported British banks in their plan to increase their market capitalisation through the newly formed Bank Recapitalisation Fund, by £25 billion {{in the first instance}} with a further £25 billion to be called upon if needed. Thirdly, the Government temporarily underwrote any eligible lending between British banks, giving a loan guarantee of around £250 billion. However, only £400 billion of this was 'fresh money', as there was already in place a system for short term <b>loans</b> <b>to</b> the <b>value</b> of £100 billion.|$|R

50|$|The {{tendency}} towards cov-lite loans ended abruptly {{with the}} 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis. Some commentators subsequently sought to attribute {{the credit crunch}} arising from crisis <b>to</b> cov-lite <b>loans,</b> although the LBO market is almost entirely unconnected with the sub-prime mortgage market in terms of exposure. However, in the credit crunch which ensued, cov-lite loans significantly hampered the ability of banks {{to step in and}} both seek to rectify positions which were going bad, and to limit their exposure once matters had gone bad.

Using Stratified Random Sampling method, this study picked 150 customers of PT. BPR Bali Dayaupaya Mandiri. Of which, 75 customers belong to those who have no arrear in their loan repayment (good credit standing) and the other 75 customers are in the categories of repayment in arrears (bad credit standing). Data comprises of age, level of education, number of dependent in the family, cash flows, the ratio of total installment to total cash inflows, total loan, the ratio of total <b>loan</b> <b>to</b> the total assets owned, the status of the ownership of the collateral, the ratio of total <b>loan</b> <b>to</b> the total <b>value</b> of the collateral, and the industrial sector are considered to be the independent variables.

40|$|MBA - WBSHome Equity Release Products (“ERPs”) are {{innovative}} financial {{products that}} enable elderly, retired {{people to use}} their unencumbered houses {{as a source of}} income/funding whilst they continue to reside in them. ERPs are typically non-recourse loans and the client is not required <b>to</b> service the <b>loan</b> or <b>to</b> repay the capital. The loan and outstanding amounts are normally settled through the sale of the property, either on death or when the client voluntarily vacates. This research is an exploration of the demand and supply issues which affect the suppliers of ERPs (both internationally and locally). Interviews were held with established suppliers in the United Kingdom (where the market is more advanced) as well as with a handful of financial services companies in South Africa. The ERP industry has grown slowly over the last decade. Factors such as increased life expectancy, decreased savings rates and changing attitudes towards debt {{are just some of the}} driving forces of demand. However, the growth of the ERP industry has consistently fallen short of analysts’ predictions, highlighting some of the difficulties facing the market - not least of which, is to be accepted by both the market and government as a mainstream option for the elderly who are often asset-rich but income-poor. There are a number of impediments to market growth that are explored in detail within this research. In terms of the market for ERPs in South Africa, it was found that there should be demand for such products as South Africa is facing similar macro-trends as the United Kingdom and other developed economies. However, South African firms face unique challenges. It appears likely that demand would probably be limited, at this stage, to certain wealth groupings.
