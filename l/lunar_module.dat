5|$|Shepard and Slayton put Shepard down {{to command}} the next {{available}} moon mission, which was Apollo 13 in 1970. Under normal circumstances, this assignment {{would have gone to}} Cooper, as the backup commander of Apollo 10, but Cooper was swept aside. A rookie, Stuart Roosa, was designated the Command Module Pilot. Shepard asked for Jim McDivitt as his <b>Lunar</b> <b>Module</b> Pilot, but McDivitt, who had already commanded the Apollo 9 mission, balked at the prospect, arguing that Shepard did not have sufficient Apollo training to command a Moon mission. A rookie, Edgar Mitchell, was designated the <b>Lunar</b> <b>Module</b> Pilot instead.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Lunar</b> <b>Module</b> (LM) was {{designed}} to descend from lunar orbit to land two astronauts on the Moon and take them back to orbit to rendezvous with the Command Module. Not designed to fly through the Earth's atmosphere or return to Earth, its fuselage {{was designed}} totally without aerodynamic considerations, and was of an extremely lightweight construction. It consisted of separate descent and ascent stages, {{each with its own}} engine. The descent stage contained storage for the descent propellant, surface stay consumables, and surface exploration equipment. The ascent stage contained the crew cabin, ascent propellant, and a reaction control system. The initial LM model weighed approximately , and allowed surface stays up to around 34 hours. An Extended <b>Lunar</b> <b>Module</b> weighed over , and allowed surface stays of over 3 days. The contract for design and construction of the <b>Lunar</b> <b>Module</b> was awarded to Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation, and the project was overseen by Thomas J. Kelly.|$|E

5|$|The manned flight hiatus allowed work {{to catch}} up on the Saturn V and <b>Lunar</b> <b>Module,</b> which were encountering their own delays. Apollo 4 flew in November 1967. Apollo 1's (AS-204) Saturn IB rocket was taken down from Launch Complex 34, later {{reassembled}} at Launch complex 37B and used to launch Apollo 5, an unmanned Earth orbital test flight of the first <b>Lunar</b> <b>Module</b> LM-1, in January 1968. A second unmanned Saturn V AS-502 flew as Apollo 6 in April 1968, and Grissom's backup crew of Wally Schirra, Don Eisele, and Walter Cunningham, finally flew the orbital test mission as Apollo 7 (AS-205), in a Block II CSM in October 1968.|$|E
5|$|After Armstrong {{served as}} backup {{commander}} for Apollo 8, Slayton offered him {{the post of}} commander of Apollo11 on December 23, 1968, as Apollo 8 orbited the Moon. In a meeting that was not made public until the publication of Armstrong's biography in 2005, Slayton told him that although the planned crew was Armstrong as commander, <b>lunar</b> <b>module</b> pilot Buzz Aldrin and command module pilot Michael Collins, he was offering the chance to replace Aldrin with Jim Lovell. After thinking it over for a day, Armstrong told Slayton he would stick with Aldrin, as he had no difficulty working with him and thought Lovell deserved his own command. Replacing Aldrin with Lovell would have made Lovell the <b>Lunar</b> <b>Module</b> Pilot, unofficially the lowest ranked member, and Armstrong could not justify placing Lovell, the commander of Gemini 12, in the number3 position of the crew.|$|E
5|$|Cernan {{turned down}} the {{opportunity}} {{to walk on the}} Moon as <b>Lunar</b> <b>Module</b> Pilot of Apollo 16, preferring to risk missing a flight altogether for the opportunity to command his own mission. After the cancellation of Apollo 18, NASA decided to send a scientist, Harrison Schmitt, to the Moon. This decision meant the original <b>Lunar</b> <b>Module</b> (LM) pilot, Joe Engle, never had the opportunity to walk on the Moon. Cernan fought to keep his crew together; however, public pressure from the scientific community cemented Schmitt's position on the crew. Even though Cernan wanted to keep his crew together, he had a positive evaluation of Schmitt's abilities. For example, he believed Schmitt was an outstanding LM pilot and that Engle was merely an adequate one.|$|E

5|$|He {{traveled}} {{into space}} three times: as Pilot of Gemini 9A in June 1966, as <b>Lunar</b> <b>Module</b> Pilot of Apollo 10 in May 1969, and as Commander of Apollo 17 in December 1972, the final Apollo lunar landing. Cernan {{was also a}} backup crew member for the Gemini 12, Apollo 7 and Apollo 14 space missions.|$|E
5|$|Looking {{beyond the}} manned lunar landings, NASA {{investigated}} several post-lunar applications for Apollo hardware. The Apollo Extension Series (Apollo X,) proposed up to 30 flights to Earth orbit, using {{the space in}} the Spacecraft <b>Lunar</b> <b>Module</b> Adapter (SLA) to house a small orbital laboratory (workshop). Astronauts would continue to use the CSM as a ferry to the station. This study was followed by design of a larger orbital workshop {{to be built in}} orbit from an empty S-IVB Saturn upper stage, and grew into the Apollo Applications Program (AAP). The workshop was to be supplemented by the Apollo Telescope Mount, which could be attached to the ascent stage of the <b>lunar</b> <b>module</b> via a rack. The most ambitious plan called for using an empty S-IVB as an interplanetary spacecraft for a Venus fly-by mission.|$|E

5|$|The Gemini Lunar Surface Rescue Spacecraft was {{intended}} to fly a direct ascent mission, launched by a Saturn V. Descent stages, built from either the descent stage of the Apollo <b>Lunar</b> <b>Module,</b> or from the Apollo Service Module, would have reduced the spacecraft's velocity as it approached the Moon. One configuration used two Service Modules and one LEM descent stage, with the LEM descent stage performing the final landing, and then being reused for ascent from the Lunar surface and trans-Earth injection. The other configuration used three LEM descent stages, with the second being used for landing and the third for ascent and TEI. The LSRS would have landed close to the Apollo <b>Lunar</b> <b>Module</b> on the Moon, and the Apollo crew would have transferred to it by EVA.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy's {{goal was}} {{accomplished}} on the Apollo 11 mission when astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed their <b>Lunar</b> <b>Module</b> (LM) on July 20, 1969, and {{walked on the}} lunar surface, while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the Command/Service Module (CSM), and all three landed safely on Earth on July 24. Five subsequent Apollo missions also landed astronauts on the Moon, the last in December 1972. In these six spaceflights, twelve men walked on the Moon.|$|E
50|$|In 1972, Simone was {{employed}} at Grumman Aerospace Industries {{and contributed to}} the assembly of the later versions of the Apollo <b>lunar</b> <b>modules</b> that landed on the moon surface. He operated an Electron Beam Welding machine, which was then an innovative method of fusing two metals with dissimilar properties. This system uses a beam of high-velocity electrons to weld alloys of high strength and melting points, such as titanium and molybdenum, materials that comprised the framework of the <b>lunar</b> <b>modules.</b>|$|R

2500|$|The Saturn V rocket, {{which sent}} astronauts to the Moon, used {{inertial}} guidance, a self-contained system that guided the rocket's trajectory. [...] The rocket booster had a guidance system separate from {{those on the}} command and <b>lunar</b> <b>modules.</b> [...] It was contained in an instrument unit like this one, a ring located between the rocket's third stage and the command and <b>lunar</b> <b>modules.</b> [...] The ring contained the basic guidance system components—a stable platform, accelerometers, a digital computer, and control electronics—as well as radar, telemetry, and other units.|$|R
5|$|Manned Apollo {{flights were}} {{suspended}} for 20 months while the Command Module's hazards were addressed. However, {{the development and}} unmanned testing of the <b>Lunar</b> <b>Module</b> (LM) and Saturn V Moon rocket continued. The Saturn IB launch vehicle for Apollo 1, AS-204, {{was used for the}} first LM test flight, Apollo 5. The first successful manned Apollo mission was flown by Apollo 1's backup crew on Apollo 7 in October 1968.|$|E
5|$|Shepard {{made his}} second space flight as Commander of Apollo 14 from January 31 to February 9, 1971. It was America's third {{successful}} lunar landing mission. Shepard piloted the <b>lunar</b> <b>module</b> Antares {{to the most}} accurate landing of the entire Apollo program. He became the fifth and, {{at the age of}} 47, the oldest man to walk on the moon, and {{the only one of the}} Mercury Seven astronauts to do so.|$|E
5|$|The CSM {{for this}} flight, number 012 built by North American Aviation (NAA), was a Block I version {{designed}} before the lunar orbit rendezvous landing strategy was chosen; therefore it lacked capability of docking with the <b>Lunar</b> <b>Module.</b> This {{was incorporated into}} the Block II CSM design, along with lessons learned in Block I. Block II would be test-flown with the LM when the latter was ready, and would be used on the Moon landing flights.|$|E
5|$|In September 2007, the X PRIZE Foundation and Google {{announced}} the Google Lunar X Prize, {{to be awarded}} for a robotic lunar landing mission which transmits close-up images of the Apollo <b>Lunar</b> <b>Modules</b> and other artificial objects on the surface.|$|R

5|$|In 2009, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) imaged {{the various}} Apollo landing {{sites on the}} surface of the Moon, for the first time with {{sufficient}} resolution to see the descent stages of the <b>lunar</b> <b>modules,</b> scientific instruments, and foot trails made by the astronauts.|$|R
5|$|The {{launch of}} Apollo 16 was delayed one month from March 17 to April 16. This {{was the first}} launch delay in the Apollo program due to a {{technical}} problem. During the delay, the space suits, a spacecraft separation mechanism and batteries in the <b>Lunar</b> <b>Module</b> (LM) were modified and tested. There were concerns that the explosive mechanism designed to separate the docking ring from the Command Module (CM) would not create enough pressure to completely sever the ring. This, along with a dexterity issue in Young's space suit and fluctuations in {{the capacity of the}} <b>Lunar</b> <b>Module</b> batteries, required investigation and trouble-shooting. In January 1972, three months before the planned April launch date, a fuel tank in the Command Module was accidentally damaged during a routine test. The rocket was returned to the Vertical Assembly Building (VAB) and the fuel tank replaced, and the rocket returned to the launch pad in February in time for the scheduled launch.|$|E
5|$|While moving {{within the}} cabin, Aldrin accidentally damaged the circuit breaker that would arm the main engine for lift {{off from the}} Moon. There was concern this would prevent firing the engine, {{stranding}} them on the Moon. Fortunately, a felt-tip pen was sufficient to activate the switch. Had this not worked, the <b>Lunar</b> <b>Module</b> circuitry could have been reconfigured to allow firing the ascent engine.|$|E
5|$|Armstrong's {{second and}} last spaceflight was as {{commander}} of Apollo 11, the first manned Moon landing mission in July 1969. Armstrong and <b>Lunar</b> <b>Module</b> pilot Buzz Aldrin descended to {{the lunar surface}} and spent {{two and a half}} hours outside the spacecraft, while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the Command/Service Module. Along with Collins and Aldrin, Armstrong was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Richard Nixon. President Jimmy Carter presented Armstrong the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 1978. Armstrong and his former crewmates received the Congressional Gold Medal in 2009.|$|E
50|$|The U.S. manned Apollo <b>Lunar</b> <b>Modules</b> (since 1969) with rovers (since 1971) and Soviet {{unmanned}} late big landers (since 1969), Lunokhods (since 1970) {{and sample}} return missions (since 1970) used a rocket descent engine for a soft landing of astronauts and lunar rovers on the Moon.|$|R
50|$|In the end, NASA {{employed}} the Lunar Orbit Rendezvous for the Apollo Program: a Saturn V would simultaneously lift both the Apollo Command and <b>Lunar</b> <b>Modules</b> into low Earth orbit, {{and then the}} Saturn V third stage would fire again (Trans-lunar injection) to send both spacecraft to the Moon.|$|R
25|$|As Swigert and Haise {{watch the}} Moon pass beneath them, Lovell laments his lost chance of walking on its surface, then turns their {{attention}} to the business of getting home. With Aquarius running on minimal electrical power, the crew suffers freezing conditions, and Haise contracts a urinary infection and a fever. Swigert suspects Mission Control is withholding their inability to get them home; Haise angrily blames Swigert's inexperience for the accident; and Lovell quickly squelches the argument. When carbon dioxide approaches dangerous levels, ground control must quickly invent a way to make the Command Module's square filters work in the <b>Lunar</b> <b>Module's</b> round receptacles. With the guidance systems on Aquarius shut down, the crew must make a difficult but vital course correction by manually igniting the <b>Lunar</b> <b>Module's</b> engine.|$|R
