The boy died from his injuries. O.D. Hopkins Associates, Inc., the manufacturer of the ride, inspected it and found it was in proper working order. It was Camp Snoopy's first fatal accident.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} rides that are {{permanent}} fixtures at the fair. The most popular {{of these is}} the Giant Slide, on which fairgoers ride down a large fiberglass slide on burlap sacks. The Skyride is an aerial lift ride that carried fairgoers across the grounds in a gondola. [...] The Space Tower is a gyro tower that rotates as it lifts people over 300 feet in the air, giving spectacular views of the entire Minneapolis/St. Paul area. [...] The Haunted House, located on Judson Ave. is another favorite of fairgoers. Further down the block is a water raft ride. The <b>log</b> <b>chute</b> is another popular thrill ride. The fair's oldest ride, Ye Old Mill (opened in 1915), is located near the food building. It is a tunnel of love style ride that caters to all ages.|$|E

50|$|Jumping Cariboo Lake {{played an}} {{important}} role in the logging industry from the early 1900s until the late 1920s. The first cabins on the lake were logging cabins located on what is now called Byers Bay off the old Ferguson Highway (now realigned and part of Highway 11). These cabins were part of the logging camp. Similar logging also occurred at Cassels Lake. An extensive network of dams and <b>log</b> <b>chutes</b> were constructed in the area - Allowing the old growth timber harvested to be sent downstream to the saw mills in Sturgeon Falls.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Log</b> <b>Chute</b> {{flume ride}} (formerly known as 'Paul Bunyan's Log Chute') at the Nickelodeon Universe Park (formerly Knott's Camp Snoopy) at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, {{features}} large animatronic Paul Bunyan and Babe statues, {{as well as}} associated characters from the legends.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Log</b> <b>Chute,</b> {{formerly}} known as Paul Bunyan's <b>Log</b> <b>Chute,</b> is a log flume attraction sponsored by Xcel Energy (formerly sponsored by Brawny) at Mall of America's Nickelodeon Universe in Bloomington, Minnesota. It opened on August 11, 1992 {{and is one of}} the mall's oldest surviving acquisitions from Knott's Camp Snoopy. The ride is based on the tall tale of Paul Bunyan and is set in a mountain lumber mill featuring two lift hills and two drops as passengers experience singing animatronics, including Paul Bunyan (modeled after the Brawny mascot) and Babe the Blue Ox. [...] The ride is also the site of Harmon Killebrew's 520-foot home run record at the former Metropolitan Stadium and is marked by one of the stadium's original chairs located on the wall above the ride.|$|E
40|$|The {{work was}} carried out in Caprarola (Viterbo, Central Italy), in an aged Quercus cerris L. coppice {{positioned}} in hill zones, with 45 % average slope. Harvesting was conducted according to the shortwood system (SWS). Felling and processing were done by chainsaw, while the bunching was performed with three different systems: in Plot 1 with mules, in Plot 2 with a tractor-mounted winch, in Plot 3 with poliethylene <b>chutes.</b> <b>Logs</b> were then forwarded to the roadside landing with a farm tractor, equipped with front and rear container bins. Finally, transportation from the landing to the company depot was performed with a truck and trailer unit. In order to speed up loading, a tractor equipped with a loader was used during this stage. On the basis of time consumption, product output and energy consumption, the authors estimated both the productivity and the energy balance obtained with each system. The best extraction productivity (PSH 0) was achieved in Plot 2 (winching, 0. 8 td. w. h– 1 worker– 1), while the lowest one was achieved in Plot 1 (mules, 0. 5 td. w. h– 1 worker– 1). The energetic efficiency was high in all the plots (on average, 97. 6 ± 0. 3 %). No correlation between time consumption and energy efficiency was observed. For Plot 3, high productivity, low time consumption and high system efficiency suggest that chutes are the most efficient bunching method from the energetic viewpoint. As the site was in a Nature Reserve and chutes are known to minimize damage to soil and seedlings, this system is to be recommended from both the energetic and environmental point of view, provided that wood can be extracted downhill...|$|R

[...] Paul Bunyan's <b>Log</b> <b>Chute,</b> an {{amusement}} park ride inside Bloomington, Minnesota's Mall of America, also houses large statues of Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox. The Paul Bunyan Logging Camp Museum at Carson Park (Eau Claire, Wisconsin) has statues of Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox.|$|E

5000|$|Maelstrom was a log flume dark ride {{attraction}} {{located in}} the Epcot theme park at Walt Disney World Resort in Florida. Designed by Walt Disney Imagineering, the ride opened on July 5, 1988, in the Norway Pavilion of the park's World Showcase section. It was a mix between a <b>log</b> <b>chute</b> and a traditional film attraction. Visitors rode boats patterned after longships that passed through various scenes that featured audio-animatronic figures. The attraction was originally supposed to be called SeaVenture, with the entrance sign during construction even displaying it as such. But sometime between March 1988 and the ride's opening, it was changed to Maelstrom.|$|E
