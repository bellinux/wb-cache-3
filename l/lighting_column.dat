40|$|The {{environmental}} performance of consumer products {{is a major}} concern for many companies. In this work, an attributional Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) study was performed to identify the Best Practicable Environmental Option of three lighting columns made in alternative materials. These are a glass fibre reinforced polymer composite, and two traditional materials, steel and aluminium. Analysis of an alternative composite <b>lighting</b> <b>column</b> with the same matrix, but reinforced with natural fibres (jute) was also performed. The results showed that the <b>lighting</b> <b>column</b> made of steel has the worst overall environmental profile, although steel production is less energy intensive. The composite <b>lighting</b> <b>column</b> is environmentally preferable due to its extended lifespan and lack of maintenance. The production of the raw material is responsible for most of the impacts in all three cases. The glass fibre production is the main contributor for the overall environmental burden of the composite column. In this case, the results also show that there are environmental advantages in replacing glass fibre for jute fibre. Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologi...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThere {{are many}} severe and fatal crashes {{that result from}} {{vehicles}} colliding with street <b>columns</b> such as <b>lighting</b> <b>columns.</b> These cause extremely high impact forces and deformation on the frontal area of the car. The objective {{of the study is}} to demonstrate the frontal crash simulation of vehicle against <b>lighting</b> <b>columns</b> to examine injury risk and potential of safety. In particular, various FE models are used to perform contact–impact nonlinear dynamic analysis of <b>lighting</b> <b>columns</b> with vehicle. In this paper Abaqus explicit code is used to numerically simulate the crash of the vehicle with present <b>columns</b> and other <b>lighting</b> <b>columns</b> fabricated from a new suggested material. The acceleration, contact force and deformed energy at the frontal region of the vehicle are traced. It is found that the <b>lighting</b> <b>columns</b> with new suggested material have impact properties to decelerate the vehicle and absorb higher energy during impact...|$|R

However, the significant role of the galvanised coating in the failure process is also highlighted. The experimental results are compared with those from a detailed 3 D finite element model.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a low-cycle fatigue test on a galvanised steel <b>lighting</b> <b>column.</b> The aim of the test was to simulate the behaviour of the column undergoing large amplitude resonant vibration caused by wind. A metallurgical study of the failure revealed the significant role of the galvanised coating in the failure process. Results from a detailed 3 D finite element model are also used to explain the failure mechanism. The swage joint in the column was confirmed as a failure location by both experiment and finite element analysis. This in itself is not surprising and the position of the fatigue failure is consistent with those observed in the field. Of more importance {{is the fact that the}} experiment shows that galvanizing can lead to premature failure of such columns. This is a highly significant conclusion as it implies that improving the weld detail in an effort to improve fatigue life may be ineffective for lighting columns coated in this manner. Given the detrimental effect of galvanizing on fatigue performance and the fact that the most severe corrosion will be on the outside of columns, then the fatigue life of such structures may benefit if the inner surface was not galvanised in high stress regions. An alternative improvement would be the use of a galvanizing coating with higher toughness and less susceptibility to cracking and damage. Attention is drawn to the need for a better understanding of the fatigue performance of galvanised steel columns resulting from large amplitude wind induced resonant vibration. The approach adopted so far for <b>lighting</b> <b>column</b> resonant vibration, has been to try and avoid it. While this is a laudable objective, clearly this has not always been possible, as designs push the limits permitted by Codes of Practice...|$|E

40|$|In the {{majority}} of the investigated accidents, the motorcyclist is still riding his bike while hitting the barrier. A substantial part of the accidents take place on straight roads. In the most severe fatal accidents, the motorcyclist is caught by the barrier. Most common are of course injuries to legs and feet, but severe head, chest and body injuries are found in the fatal accident cases too. The barrier posts are of great influence in most accidents. Based on the observed accidents, Sweden ought to reduce the use of barriers where parts of the posts face the traffic in front of the longitudinal cross railing member of the barrier, regardless of what is stipulated in EN 1317 - 2 and draft EN 1317 - 8. By the same judgment, posts protruding above the horizontal cross railing member or otherwise exposing sharp top edges ought to be, from a crash safety point of view, banned. Any MPS fulfilling the requirements of the draft EN 1317 - 8, soon to be on "CEN technical enquiry", would most certainly not alter the outcome of any of the investigated accidents. In total 15 accidents are reported, of those 7 fatal. Concerning wire rope barriers we have detected 7 accidents, 2 of them fatal. On beam barriers 5 accidents are recorded, of them 3 fatal. Or 2 fatalities, if another disease is allowed to be removed from the overall counting.

40|$|Landing on {{lighting}} columns like nature’s birds is {{a desirable}} capability {{which can only}} extend the uses of unmanned aerial systems. This thesis investigates what the most effective form of perching on existing street furniture with a VTOL UAV and how the perch site can be recognised using low cost off the shelf sensors. Additionally to this, the UAV in question will have to execute the perch without relying on GPS data. The work conducted here covers an extensive design review which selects a bird claw like gripper to sustain the perch. In order for the UAV to {{know where it is}} in relation to the perch site without relying on GPS data, a Raspberry Pi and PiCamera were used to detect common features which are found on top of a <b>lighting</b> <b>column.</b> Using a search and perch algorithm which was developed specifically for the task of perching on lamp post projection brackets, the on-board microprocessor controlled the UAV over the perch site and gradually descended into the perch position. The perched position and approach was also tested to ensure the perching element could cope with various weather conditions. The testing was conducted in a wind tunnel with the UAV mounted in various perched positions and the moment the UAV would slip, the wind speed were measured and analysed which highlighted an interesting prediction method. During the perching development the addition of a gantry style test-rig was also developed to ease the algorithm development with minimal incidents. The final result is a search and perch algorithm which is initiated when the VTOL UAV is within the vicinity of a lamp post at which point the on-board vision processing and control system takes over, removing the burden from the UAV operator to ensure a collision free perch...|$|E
40|$|Purpose Life cycle {{assessment}} (LCA) studies allow understanding {{all relevant}} processes and environmental impacts {{involved in the}} life cycle of products. However, in order to fully assess their sustainability, these studies should be complemented by economic (LCC) and societal analyses. In this context, the present work aims at assessing all costs (internal and external) and the environmental performance associated to the full life cycle of specific engineering products. These products are lighting columns for roadway illumination made with three different materials: a glass fibre reinforced polymer composite, steel and aluminium. Methods The LCA/LCC integrated methodology used was based in a “cradle-to-grave” assessment which considers the raw materials production, manufacture, on-site installation, use and maintenance, dismantlement and end-of-life (EoL) of the lighting columns. The fossil fuels environmental impact category was selected as the key environmental impact indicator to perform the integrated environmental and cost analysis. Results The potential total costs obtained for the full life cycle of the lighting columns demonstrated that the one made in steel performs globally worse than those made in composite or aluminium. Although the three systems present very similar internal costs, the steel column has higher external costs in the use phase that contribute for its higher total cost. This column has very high costs associated to safety features, since it constitutes a significant risk to the life of individuals. The raw material and column production stages are the main contributors for the total internal life cycle costs. The EoL treatment is a revenue source in all systems because it generates energy (in the case of the composite incineration) or materials (in the case of metal recycling). The composite and aluminium lighting columns present similar “cradle-to-grave” life cycle total cost. However, until the dismantlement phase, the aluminium column presents the highest environmental impact, whereas in the EoL treatment phase this scenario is reversed. The “cradle-to-grave” life cycle potential total cost and the environmental impact (fossil fuels) indicator of the steel <b>lighting</b> <b>column</b> are higher than those of the other columns. Conclusions Even though the uncertainties in the LCC are larger if external costs are included, their consideration when modelling the economic performance of engineering products increases the probability of developing a more sustainable solution from a societal perspective.
