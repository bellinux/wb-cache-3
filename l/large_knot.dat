5|$|In one of {{earliest}} Vaikuntha Chaturmurti images {{dating from}} the Gupta era - c. 6th century (now housed in Mathura Museum), {{the positions of the}} boar and lion heads are reversed, though this is a rare aberration. The central front face may be smiling. Sometimes, the back face may be omitted. The fourth head may be replaced by a horse (Hayagriva, another avatar of Vishnu) or a Chakrapurusha (the personified Sudarshana Chakra - the discus weapon of Vishnu). The kapila head may have a moustache, bulging large eyes, a third eye, grinning teeth, fangs, a short chin, broad eyebrows and a ferocious, grim or sad expression. His hair are generally tied up in a <b>large</b> <b>knot</b> - a jata (matted hair) like a sage; rarely he may wear a crown.|$|E
2500|$|... 5 feet 6 or 8 inches [...] high, weighs between 150 and 160 pounds , rather [...] "bright" [...] complexion, {{but not a}} mulatto, broad shoulders, larger flat nose, large eyes, broad flat feet, rather knockneed, walks brisk and active, hair {{on the top of}} {{the head}} very thin, no beard, except on the upper lip and the top of the chin, a scar on one of his temples, also one on the back of his neck, a <b>large</b> <b>knot</b> on one of the bones of his right arm, near the wrist, {{produced}} by a blow.|$|E
60|$|Knots at End of Rope.--To make a <b>large</b> <b>knot</b> {{at the end}} of a {{piece of}} string, to prevent it from pulling through a hole, turn the end of the string back upon itself, so as to make it double, and then tie a common knot. The string may be quadrupled instead of doubled, if required.|$|E
30|$|Finger joint: a {{manufacturer}} {{might make a}} finger joint when a <b>knot</b> <b>larger</b> than visual quality (VQ) restraint was found, or some serious defects/drying problem should be removed. In this study, knot was focused. Hence, {{if there is a}} <b>larger</b> <b>knot</b> than predefined knot restraint, the portion of the knot in a lamina was removed and finger-jointed.|$|R
5000|$|... “The figurehead was ‘a {{man from}} the waist up, in old sailor's costume, a blue jacket with yellow buttons, the jacket open in the front, no waistcoat, loose shirt, and a <b>large</b> <b>knotted</b> {{handkerchief}} round the neck.’” ...|$|R
50|$|The Windsor knot is {{especially}} suited for a spread or cutaway collar that can properly accommodate a <b>larger</b> <b>knot.</b> For correct wear, the tie {{used for a}} Windsor knot should be about 4 cm longer than a conventional tie.|$|R
60|$|This {{precious}} discovery he kept to himself. The {{yellow hair}} was absolutely beyond his power, his own tousled wig being potato-brown; but something {{might be done}} toward the blue sash. He tied a <b>large</b> <b>knot</b> in his mosquito-curtains in order to remember to consult Patsie on their next meeting. She was the only child he had ever spoken to, and almost {{the only one that}} he had ever seen. The little memory and the very large and ragged knot held good.|$|E
60|$|In this apartment, among a {{great many}} other curious things, are shown the devilish {{instruments}} of torture which the Spaniards were bringing to England in their Armada; and, {{at the end of}} the room, sits Queen Elizabeth on horseback, in her high ruff and faded finery. Very likely none of these clothes were ever on her actual person. Here, too, we saw a headsman's block,--not that on which Raleigh was beheaded, which I would have given gold to see, but the one which was used for the Scotch Lords Kilmarnock, Lovat, and others, executed on account of the Rebellion of 1745. It is a block of oak, about two feet high, with a <b>large</b> <b>knot</b> in it, so that it would not easily be split by a blow of the axe; hewn and smoothed in a very workmanlike way, and with a hollow to accommodate the head and shoulders on each side. There were two or three very strong marks of the axe in the part over which the neck lay, and several smaller cuts; as if the first stroke nearly severed the head, and then the chopping off was finished by smaller blows, as we see a butcher cutting meat with his cleaver. A headsman's axe was likewise shown us,--its date unknown.|$|E
60|$|Not unbewildered, {{again he}} gazed off for his boat. But it was {{temporarily}} hidden by a rocky {{spur of the}} isle. As with some eagerness he bent forward, watching for the first shooting view of its beak, the balustrade gave way before him like charcoal. Had he not clutched an outreaching rope he would have fallen into the sea. The crash, though feeble, and the fall, though hollow, of the rotten fragments, must have been overheard. He glanced up. With sober curiosity peering down upon him {{was one of the}} old oakum-pickers, slipped from his perch to an outside boom; while below the old negro, and, invisible to him, reconnoitering from a port-hole like a fox from the mouth of its den, crouched the Spanish sailor again. From something suddenly suggested by the man's air, the mad idea now darted into Captain Delano's mind, that Don Benito's plea of indisposition, in withdrawing below, was but a pretense: that he was engaged there maturing his plot, of which the sailor, by some means gaining an inkling, had a mind to warn the stranger against; incited, it may be, by gratitude for a kind word on first boarding the ship. Was it from foreseeing some possible interference like this, that Don Benito had, beforehand, given such a bad character of his sailors, while praising the negroes; though, indeed, the former seemed as docile as the latter the contrary? The whites, too, by nature, were the shrewder race. A man with some evil design, would he not be likely to speak well of that stupidity which was blind to his depravity, and malign that intelligence from which it might not be hidden? Not unlikely, perhaps. But if the whites had dark secrets concerning Don Benito, could then Don Benito be any way in complicity with the blacks? But they were too stupid. Besides, who ever heard of a white so far a renegade as to apostatize from his very species almost, by leaguing in against it with negroes? These difficulties recalled former ones. Lost in their mazes, Captain Delano, who had now regained the deck, was uneasily advancing along it, when he observed a new face; an aged sailor seated cross-legged near the main hatchway. His skin was shrunk up with wrinkles like a pelican's empty pouch; his hair frosted; his countenance grave and composed. His hands were full of ropes, which he was working into a <b>large</b> <b>knot.</b> Some blacks were about him obligingly dipping the strands for him, here and there, as the exigencies of the operation demanded.|$|E
5000|$|Logs are {{converted}} into timber by being sawn, hewn, or split. Sawing with a rip saw {{is the most}} common method, because sawing allows logs of lower quality, with irregular grain and <b>large</b> <b>knots,</b> to be used and is more economical. There are various types of sawing: ...|$|R
40|$|One {{hundred and}} ninety-two pieces of matched 2 x 6 {{southern}} yellow pine (SYP) lumber were dried {{in two separate}} charges according to an elevated temperature (ET) and a high-temperature (HT) schedule. Wood properties including juvenile wood content, density, ring count, <b>largest</b> <b>knot</b> area, presence of pith, moisture content, and warp (crook, bow, and twist) were measured for each board. It was found that boards dried with the ET schedule had significantly higher crook than those from the HT schedule. Bow and twist from the ET schedule were also higher, but no {{significant difference was found}} between the two schedules. Crook was shown to co-vary with the <b>largest</b> <b>knot</b> area. Twist co-varied significantly with specific gravity, juvenile wood content, and number of rings per inch for the test lumber...|$|R
30|$|Tensile {{strength}} of lamina element having a bigger knot than 0.4 KAR {{was replaced with}} tensile {{strength of}} finger joint in the same grade. The KARs of extracted knot section from lamina for controlling the visual quality level were measured. The finger-joint worker instinctively cut a knot section which have <b>larger</b> <b>knot</b> than third of lamina width.|$|R
50|$|A <b>large</b> <b>knot</b> can {{distract}} {{attention away}} from the wearer's face; therefore, a Windsor best complements a strong square or round face, or those sporting facial hair.|$|E
5000|$|A hole is {{drilled in}} a large, hard conker using a nail, gimlet, small screwdriver, or {{electric}} drill. A piece of string (often a shoelace is used), about 20 cm (8 inches) long, is threaded through it. A <b>large</b> <b>knot</b> at {{one or both}} ends of the string secures the conker.|$|E
50|$|The knot is symmetrical, well-balanced, and self-releasing (i.e., it can {{be undone}} entirely by pulling the tie's narrow end up through the knot). It is a <b>large</b> <b>knot,</b> which amply {{displays}} the fabric and design of the tie when wearing a closed jacket or coat, and helps keep the throat area warm during the colder winter months.|$|E
60|$|Swivel.--The woodcut {{shows how}} a {{makeshift}} swivel can be fitted to a tether rope. Without one, the rope will be twisted almost up to a knot by the horse walking {{round and round}} his picket peg; with one, the rope will turn freely in the hole, through which its <b>large</b> <b>knotted</b> head prevents it from being drawn.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{somewhat}} unlike other sandpipers in appearance, {{which has led}} to the suggestion that it should be placed into a monotypic genus Crocethia. A more recent review (Thomas et al., 2004) indicates, however, that the sanderling is a fairly typical [...] "stint" [...] or small sandpiper and should be separated from the <b>large</b> <b>knots</b> with its closest relatives in a distinct genus.|$|R
5000|$|While {{studying}} at the University of Pittsburgh, {{she met her}} future husband, artist William Itter, who encouraged her to experiment with hand-tied knots. [...] Itter used fine threads, small knots, and bright colors, whereas most fiber artists working {{at the time were}} producing large sculptural works from undyed fibers tied into <b>large</b> <b>knots.</b> Itter was inspired by historical textiles from Peru, Japan, and Africa.|$|R
50|$|Blossom {{trees are}} also used to {{randomly}} generate <b>large</b> <b>knot</b> diagrams. Knots can be represented by 4-regular planar graphs where each node is marked as an overcrossing or undercrossings. Blossom trees {{can be used to}} generate random 4-regular planar graphs. However, these do not always give knot diagrams as there may be more than one component. This can be checked in cubic time.|$|E
50|$|The Khamti tie {{their hair}} into a <b>large</b> <b>knot,</b> which is {{supported}} by a white turban (Fa-ho). The chiefs wear a long coat made of silk. The hair is drawn up from the back and sides in one massive roll, measuring four to five inches in length. An embroidered band, the fringed and tasseled ends of which hang down behind, encircles the roll.|$|E
50|$|Oleson {{sees the}} rider in the {{tympanum}} fresco as Bellerophon. According to Holloway the Etruscan artist did not copy the Greek iconography of Bellerophon and the Chimaera, but adapted {{it to an}} Etruscan setting. He identifies the rider as Troilus because he wears a Phrygian cap and has a <b>large</b> <b>knot</b> of hair. The scene signifies his voyage to the underworld after his sacrificial death.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to find the optimum lamina size from red pine (Pinus densiflora) and Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) logs for the cross {{laminated}} timber (CLT) production. From visual inspection of the logs from two species, red pine log showed a <b>larger</b> <b>knot</b> and warp compared to the Japanese cedar.

40|$|A Dehn {{surgery on}} a knot $K$ in $S^ 3 $ is {{exceptional}} if {{it produces a}} reducible, toroidal or Seifert fibred manifold. It is known that a <b>large</b> arborescent <b>knot</b> admits no such surgery unless it is a type II arborescent knot. The main theorem of this paper shows that up to isotopy there are exactly three <b>large</b> arborescent <b>knots</b> admitting exceptional surgery, each of which admits exactly one exceptional surgery, producing a toroidal manifold...|$|R

50|$|In their brutal July bout, the Associated Press gave Morgan {{eight of}} the fifteen rounds, and Martin only four, with three even. The {{fighting}} was close throughout the contest. Morgan received a gash from a head butt in the first round, while Morgan cut Martin's right cheek in the third. In the tenth, Martin's right eyebrow was cut deeply. Morgan also had a <b>large</b> <b>knot</b> above his right eye, a bloodly nose, and a cut behind his right ear.|$|E
50|$|In this Detour, teams chose between Connaissance (Knowledge) and Patience. In Connaissance, teams {{needed to}} choose {{from a variety of}} items {{representing}} Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay, and correctly give five of each to the correct representatives of each country. However, a bank note from Panama and a map from Chile are included to trick teams. In Patience, teams needed to untangle a <b>large</b> <b>knot</b> of ropes to release their next clue from within. For the Roadblock, one team member had to rappel 55 m down Cânion Iguaçu.|$|E
40|$|We perform {{theoretical}} {{studies of}} stretching of 20 proteins with knots within a coarse grained model. The knot's ends {{are found to}} jump to well defined sequential locations {{that are associated with}} sharp turns whereas in homopolymers they diffuse around and eventually slide off. The waiting times of the jumps are increasingly stochastic as the temperature is raised. <b>Larger</b> <b>knots</b> do not return to their native locations when a protein is released after stretching.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{numerical}} {{study of the}} effect of knotting on the ejection of flexible and semiflexible polymers from a spherical, virus-like capsid. The polymer ejection rate is primarily controlled by the knot, which moves to the hole in the capsid and then acts as a ratchet. Polymers with more complex knots eject more slowly and, for <b>large</b> <b>knots,</b> the knot type, and not the flexibility of the polymer, determines the rate of ejection. We discuss the relation of our results to the ejection of DNA from viral capsids and conjecture that this process has the biological advantage of unknotting the DNA before it enters a cell.

5000|$|The oysterman's stopper...It is a <b>larger</b> <b>knot</b> {{than the}} figure-eight, which has but one part around the stem. The oysterman's stopper knot has three rim parts, {{and these are}} quite {{symmetrical}} when viewed from the underside. From this view it closely resembles a three-strand wall knot. The end is nipped by a single top part. It is easy to tie and practical to use when the hole {{that is to be}} filled is too large for the figure-eight. The Ashley Book of Knots ...|$|R
