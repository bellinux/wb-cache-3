5000|$|Within {{three years}} from the launch of Project [...] "Jupiter", the BA {{mainline}} operation more than doubled the number of long haul aircraft at Gatwick and {{increased the number of}} short haul aircraft at the airport by more than half. In addition, the airline's franchisees, notably CityFlyer Express and GB Airways, increased their Gatwick-based fleets as well. During that period the number of BA passengers passing through Gatwick also doubled. The role BA had assigned its franchisees generally and CityFlyer in particular to make Project [...] "Jupiter" [...] work was to provide feeder services that were expected to be profitable in their own right and enable transfer passengers to connect at ease with BA's <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> <b>services</b> at Gatwick, thereby improving those services' load factors and increasing their profitability. Unlike some of the North American commuter carriers that operate under franchise agreements on the same routes as their mainline partners using smaller aircraft at less busy times, BA's franchisees only operated on routes the company's mainline short haul operation could not serve profitably from Gatwick itself due to its higher cost base.|$|E

50|$|The most fitting {{description}} for {{the resulting}} network of domestic, European and intercontinental <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> scheduled <b>services</b> from Gatwick was a motley collection of routes resembling a rag bag. This {{made it difficult}} to develop profitable streams of transfer traffic using Gatwick as a hub. For this reason it was {{always going to be a}} challenge to persuade people to fly to Gatwick from relatively minor places like Genoa or Jersey in order to make an onward connection at the airport to what many people would consider secondary places in Africa or South America, and an even greater challenge to do this profitably.|$|R
5000|$|Eddington {{attributed}} {{this loss}} to Gatwick's failure to attract sufficient high-yield traffic. He furthermore stated that Gatwick's loss was entirely {{accounted for by}} its mainline short haul operation whose schedules were primarily designed to feed BA's <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> <b>services</b> at the airport. Eddington was {{of the opinion that}} this was the wrong way around because there were not enough early morning departures and late-evening arrivals that could have attracted a greater number of locally based business and leisure passengers requiring same-day-return facilities. Also, the long haul route network BA operated from Gatwick at the time strangely resembled the long haul route structure British Caledonian had inherited from British United {{at the time of its}} inception three decades earlier. Moreover, in his opinion, the physical constraints imposed on BA's Gatwick operation by the airport's single runway and two terminals meant that the airline could not offer truly competitive schedules, in terms of frequencies and conveniently timed connections. In addition, Eddington also felt that Gatwick's operation was far too fragmented, in terms of what he called the airport's [...] "bewildering array" [...] of operators and their equipment, which substantially increased costs. At the time, in addition to BA's mainline operation, which accounted for the bulk of the airline's scheduled services at Gatwick, all of its UK-based franchisees (with the exception of British Mediterranean and Loganair) as well as the company's subsidiaries and partners provided scheduled services at the airport as well, in some cases with a single aircraft on one route only, operating all aircraft types in their combined inventory except Concorde and some of the smaller commuter planes.|$|E
50|$|CityFlyer and its {{predecessor}} Connectair had a {{proven track record}} of operating a network of regional domestic and European scheduled services from Gatwick profitably. This was {{in stark contrast to}} BA's mainline short haul operation at Gatwick, which had racked up huge losses ever since BA had established a major presence at Gatwick {{as a result of the}} British Caledonian and Dan-Air takeovers. The losses BA's mainline short haul services generated at Gatwick were at the heart of the unsatisfactory financial performance of the entire Gatwick operation. After the failed attempt to use the acquisition of Dan-Air, which was on the verge of bankruptcy at the end of October 1992, to form a new low-cost, short haul unit within BA's mainline short haul operation at Gatwick, franchising seemed to offer the best solution for providing the level of feeder services BA needed to protect its long-haul loads and profits at Gatwick, without re-creating the complex organisation and fleet mix, and without duplicating the costly overheads of the BA mainline short haul operation at Heathrow, which did not suit the revenue environment at Gatwick. Apart from the additional transfer traffic this generated for BA's <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> <b>services</b> at Gatwick, the main benefit of this arrangement for BA was that CityFlyer was to remain completely independent of the BA mainline operation. The feeder services CityFlyer provided for BA at Gatwick under the franchise agreement did not impact the direct operating costs of BA's mainline operation. CityFlyer also had very low costs as a result of a flat organisational structure and a simple fleet. This suited Gatwick's revenue environment and was the main reason BA decided to make the franchise agreement with CityFlyer Express a central plank of its strategy to achieve sustained, overall profitability at Gatwick.|$|E
50|$|BA {{therefore}} {{decided to}} move all predominantly business-orientated <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> routes (other than those that had to stay at Gatwick due to bilateral constraints, such as its non-stop services to Atlanta, Dallas and Houston) back to Heathrow. The airline also decided to withdraw all loss-making services from the airport and to simplify its Gatwick-based fleet by {{reducing the number of}} aircraft stationed there and operating only two different aircraft types from the airport. Henceforth, all short to medium <b>haul</b> <b>services</b> from Gatwick were to be exclusively operated with Boeing 737s, while Boeing 777s were to be the only aircraft to ply the <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> routes from the airport.|$|R
50|$|The longest lived fork {{from the}} 2.10 code {{started in the}} American Midwest, when Hue White (aka Hue, Jr.) ported the code to MS-DOS and called it Citadel-86 ("C-86"). His board, Citadel-86 Test System, served {{not only as a}} {{discussion}} board and distribution center for the software, but also was the focal point for a lively Citadel-86 community in the 612 area code (the Twin Cities), which at their peak numbered roughly forty systems, and probably more than 100 over the years. Numerous suggestions from sysops and users, both local and national, guided the growth of Citadel-86, including the addition of a network capability as well as enhancements to the command set. Hue's contributions were substantial enough that several other porting projects used Citadel-86 as source material, such as Asgard-86 (MS-DOS), Macadel (Macintosh), STadel (Atari ST, fnordadel), Citadel-68K (Amiga), and Citadel:K2NE (MS-DOS), and many of these contributed back to Hue Jr's project. Most of these ports were compatible with the growing Citadel-86 network (C86Net). Local systems would network with each other on a demand basis (due to the work of David Parsons), while the <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> network was <b>serviced</b> late at night.|$|R
