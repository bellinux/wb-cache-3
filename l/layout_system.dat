It is {{believed}} that housing designs and <b>layout</b> <b>systems</b> for crime prevention have either positive or negative implications on the actual prevention of crime. Therefore this research explores the exact implications that housing designs and <b>layout</b> <b>systems</b> have in relation to crime especially in neighborhoods of Durban. In this regard, the concepts, assumptions surrounding work on the field, including defensible space principles, crime prevention through environmental design and the housing design principles are thoroughly discussed. Various principles especially defensible space principles are emphasized in this study: Surveillance, territoriality, access control, image and milieu. Hence other supporting paradimes like housing design principles including housing structures, support activities and gated communities are highly elaborated. These analytical criteria were used to examine two neighboring residential areas characterized by different planning and design systems {{in the area of}} Woodlands in terms safety. The assessment is mainly a comparison of the gated residential neighbourhood and the non-gated residential neighbourhood. Procedurally the evaluation entails analyzing both areas in terms of layout and housing design, observing both areas in terms of behavior and reaction of residents within their areas and analyzing the views and perceptions of people living in both areas. The findings indicate that in comparing the two areas in terms of safety the gated residential neighbourhoods displays high level of safety as compared to the non-gated community. Overall housing design and <b>layout</b> <b>systems</b> for crime prevention have positive implications on crime reduction in residential areas. However different recommendations are made in an attempt to improve crime free housing designs in offering both real and perceived safety...|$|R

50|$|WPF exposes a {{property}} system for objects which inherit from , that {{is aware of}} the dependencies between the consumers of the property, and can trigger actions based on changes in properties. Properties can be either hard coded values or expressions, which are specific expressions that evaluate to a result. In the initial release, however, the set of expressions supported is closed. The value of the properties can be inherited from parent objects as well. WPF properties support change notifications, which invoke bound behaviors whenever some property of some element is changed. Custom behaviors can be used to propagate {{a property}} change notification across a set of WPF objects. This is used by the <b>layout</b> <b>system</b> to trigger a recalculation of the layout on property-changes, thus exposing a declarative programming style for WPF, whereby almost everything, from setting colors and positions to animating elements can be achieved by setting properties. This allows WPF applications to be written in XAML, which is a declarative mark-up language, by binding the keywords and attributes directly to WPF classes and properties.|$|E

50|$|Originally part of Katsina, a Hausa state, {{it became}} {{independent}} in the 19th century. From the early 19th century, Maradi {{was home to}} one of several Hausa traditional rump states, formed by rulers and nobility who fled the rise of the Sokoto Caliphate. Elements of the Katsina ruling class continued to claim the area as the seat of a Katsina exile state ruled by the Sarkin Katsina Maradi. Maradi was constrained by the more powerful Gobir exile state to the west, the Sultanate of Damagaram based at Zinder to the east, and Sokoto to the south. The arrival of the French in 1899 saw first the bloody destruction of the town by the Voulet-Chanoine Mission, but later saw the town recover as an important regional centre of commerce by the 1950s. The expansion of the city {{in the first half of}} the 20th century was dynamic, albeit modest, with the population nearly doubling between 1911 and 1950. Up until 1945, the ancient city of Maradi was located in the valley bordering the Goulbin Maradi, a seasonal waterway with source in Nigeria. The agglomeration, roughly circular in shape, was protected by a mud wall with four doors. The ancient city was flooded by Goulbin at the end of the rainy season of 1945. To avoid future inundation, the colonial administration decided then to adjust the urban layout. In the process, the city lost its traditional, irregular layout in favour of a grid-iron street <b>layout</b> <b>system.</b> The colonial administration sought to create an exploitative cash-crop agriculture, mostly groundnuts, which increasingly made the city an important regional commercial centre. Aided by the economic growth after the 1950s, the city of Maradi experienced a demographic boom, with the population increasing from 8,661 in 1950 to 80,000 by 1983. By the time of Niger's independence in 1960, Maradi was a centre of Hausa culture, vying with the larger traditional Hausa centre of Zinder to the east.|$|E
