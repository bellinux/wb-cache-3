5|$|Like other pterosaurs, Pteranodon {{probably}} {{took off}} from a standing, quadrupedal position. Using their long forelimbs for leverage, they would have vaulted themselves into the air in a rapid leap. Almost all of the energy would have been generated by the forelimbs. The upstroke of the wings would have occurred when the animal cleared the ground followed by a rapid down-stroke to generate additional lift and complete the <b>launch</b> <b>into</b> the air.|$|E
5|$|Guitar Hero 5 allows {{players to}} start in a Band Lobby from where they can then <b>launch</b> <b>into</b> any of the game's modes, add other local and remote players to a party, and switch between the game modes without having to leave the party or lobby, a {{significant}} change in response to the difficulties players found in World Tour. The game supports a Career mode (described below), a Quickplay mode, where players can create a set list of numerous songs and play through them. All songs on disc and through downloadable content are immediately available to play in this mode. The game also carries over the competitive modes from previous Guitar Hero games.|$|E
5|$|These {{moves are}} {{designed}} to be used in flurry combinations. For instance, the player can Seismic Slam an opponent, which pulls in enemies, and progress into a Rising Uppercut, which tosses the opponent into the air. During that toss, the player can charge the Rocket Punch and release as the opponent returns to the ground. Alternatively, the player can <b>launch</b> <b>into</b> the air, pick an opponent to slam, and punch them at close range. The character is built for aggressive playstyles and advanced players.|$|E

5|$|A {{week later}} with the skies clearing, birds began to appear, {{signalling}} a proximity to land. On 28 May, the Great Barrier Reef was sighted; Bligh found a navigable gap and sailed the <b>launch</b> <b>into</b> a calm lagoon. Late that afternoon, he ran the boat ashore on a small island which he named Restoration Island, where the men found oysters and berries in plentiful supply {{and were able to}} eat ravenously. Over the next four days, the party island-hopped northward within the lagoon, aware that their movements were being closely monitored by natives on the mainland. Strains were showing within the party; following a heated disagreement with Purcell, Bligh grabbed a cutlass and challenged the carpenter to fight. Fryer told Cole to arrest their captain, but backed down after Bligh threatened to kill him if he interfered.|$|E
5|$|The {{very first}} Commando raid– Operation Collar on 23 June 1940– was not {{actually}} carried out by a Commando unit, but by one of their predecessors: No.11 Independent Company. The mission, led by Major Ronnie Tod, was an offensive reconnaissance carried out on the French coast south of Boulogne-sur-Mer and Le Touquet. The operation was a limited success; at least two German soldiers were killed whilst the only British injury was a flesh wound suffered by Lieutenant Colonel Dudley Clarke, who had accompanied the raiders as an observer. A second and similarly inconsequential raid, Operation Ambassador, was made on the German occupied island of Guernsey {{on the night of}} 14 July 1940 by men from H Troop of No. 3 Commando and No. 11 Independent Company. One unit landed on the wrong island and another group disembarked from its <b>launch</b> <b>into</b> water so deep that it came over their heads. Intelligence had indicated that there was a large German barracks on the island but the Commandos found only empty buildings. When they returned to the beach heavy seas had forced their launch offshore, and they were forced to swim out to sea to be picked up.|$|E

25|$|It {{has also}} been {{proposed}} that space-telescopes that focus light using zone plates instead of mirrors would provide higher-contrast imaging, and be cheaper to <b>launch</b> <b>into</b> space due {{to being able to}} fold up the lightweight foil zone plate.|$|E

5000|$|Earth-observing {{satellites}} {{may also}} be <b>launched</b> <b>into</b> a sun-synchronous orbit, which is slightly retrograde.

25|$|Until Ulysses, the Sun {{was only}} {{observed}} from low solar latitudes. The Earth's orbit defines the ecliptic plane, which {{differs from the}} Sun's equatorial plane by only 7.25 degrees. Even spacecraft directly orbiting the Sun do so in planes close to the ecliptic because a direct <b>launch</b> <b>into</b> a high-inclination solar orbit would require a prohibitively large launch vehicle.|$|E

25|$|In {{the closing}} {{days of the}} program, Apollo 17 LMP Harrison Schmitt aggressively lobbied for a manned landing {{on the far side}} of the Moon, {{targeting}} the far side Tsiolkovskiy crater.

NASA administrators rejected these plans based on lack of funding and added risk.|$|E

25|$|Through flashbacks, {{imaginary}} {{stories and}} time travel, Superman comics in the Silver Age examined the implicit themes of Superman's origin as an orphan from another planet, while also providing explanations for many key story elements. In 1961, Superman #146 told {{the most complete}} version of the origin story to date, this time inserting references to {{other elements of the}} expanding Superman mythos, including Jor-El's warning to his brother Zor-El, father of Supergirl, about Krypton's fate and Krypto's <b>launch</b> <b>into</b> space.|$|E

Firstmac stipulated a unique clause in their contract that they could pay for 250 tickets to be distributed to WOW Sight & Sound staff that lost their jobs. Firstmac has since launched a Firstmac Broncos home loan in conjunction with their new sponsorship agreement.|$|E
