500|$|Bulgaria {{adopted the}} Kyoto Protocol and {{achieved}} the protocol's objectives by reducing {{carbon dioxide emissions}} from 1990 to 2009 by 30 percent. However, pollution from factories and metallurgy works and severe deforestation continue to cause major problems {{to the health and}} welfare of the population. In 2013, air pollution in Bulgaria was more severe than any other European country. Urban areas are particularly affected by energy production from coal-based powerplants and automobile traffic, while pesticide usage in the agriculture and antiquated industrial sewage systems produce extensive soil and water pollution with chemicals and detergents. Bulgaria is home to Maritsa Iztok-2, a <b>lignite-fired</b> <b>power</b> <b>station</b> causing the highest damage costs to health and the environment in the entire European Union according to the European Environment Agency. It is the only EU member which does not recycle municipal waste, although an electronic waste recycling plant opened in June 2010. The situation has improved in recent years, and several government-funded programs have been put into place in an attempt to reduce pollution levels. According to Yale University's 2012 Environmental Performance Index, Bulgaria is a [...] "modest performer" [...] in protecting the environment. Over 75% of surface rivers meet the standards for good quality. An improvement of water quality began in 1998 and has maintained a sustainable trend of moderate improvement.|$|E

40|$|The {{contribution}} of lignite {{to the total}} electric power output of Greece exceeds 75 %. Most greek lignite deposits {{are located in the}} Florina-Ptolemais- Kozani basin, a large intensively exploited area, in northern Greece. This area is exploited by opencast mining and feeds nearby <b>lignite-fired</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations.</b> The elongated intermontaine Florina-Ptolemais-Kozani basin is a NNW-SSE trending graben system, that extends over a distance of 250 km from Bitola, in the Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia to Servia, southeast of Kozani, Greece. The basement consists of metamorphic schists in the west and crystalline limestone in the east. The Amynteo basin is part of this graben, that opened in the late Miocene and was divided into sub-basins in the Pleistocene, and consists of rythmic alternations of lignite beds and lacustrine and fluvial sediments. Sampling represents the vertical and lateral differentiation of lignite beds in Amynteo field (Chapter 1). Coal petrological investigation along with proximate and elemental analyses were undertaken (Chapter 2) {{in order to determine the}} petrographic characteristics of the Amynteo lignites and their depositional environment. Thirty-eight samples (representing different lignite beds of the Amynteo deposit) were collected from a borehole. The Amynteo lignites have an euulminite B reflectance of Rr= 0. 21 %, and in terms of lithotype belong to matrix soft brown coals. Huminite is the most abundant maceral group, and consists mostly of humodetrinite. Inertinite has relatively low percentages whereas liptinite concentrations are rather high. Ternary plots and facies indices were employed in order to reconstruct the palaeoenvironment. The depositional environment of the Amynteo-Apofysis lignites is not definitely ascribed to a forest swamp or a reed marsh environment. The high ash content of the analysed samples is a clear indication of a topogenous setting. Low TPI and high GI values are observed. High alkalinity and strongly reducing conditions may be inferred from the presence of syngenetic (framboidal) pyrite, the low TPI values which indicate high bacterial activity, and thus high pH conditions, and the preservation of gastropod shells and chlorophyllinite. High GI values indicates a constant influx of calcium rich waters into the coal swamp. The Apofysis lignite deposit may be interpreted to be autochthonous to hypoautochthonous. The peat accumulation was governed by a high groundwater level (wet telmatic to limno-telmatic facies) and a moderate subsidence rate. The high liptinite content of the samples makes them suitable for liquefaction and gasification and may also be useful in chemical industry due to the high extract yields. ...|$|R

40|$|Coal- and <b>lignite-fired</b> <b>power</b> plants produce {{significant}} amounts of fly ash, which in many cases contains high concentrations of naturally occurring radionuclides such as 238 U. This is of importance from the radio-environmental point of view since {{a small portion of}} the fly ash escapes from the power plant filtering system and disperses in the surrounding atmosphere. In addition, coal- and lignite-fired plants related activities such as fuel mining and ash deposition contribute to the suspended matter in the air with particles containing naturally occurring radionuclides. In this study, rainwater samples were collected in the Megalopolis lignite field basin of the Arcadia prefecture in Greece, where <b>lignite-fired</b> <b>power</b> plants are in operation and related activities are fully developed. The samples were preconcentrated and analyzed with alpha spectrometry and kinetic phosphorescence analysis in order to determine the levels of uranium isotope concentrations in precipitation in the Megalopolis basin. A control rainwater sample was also collected in the Athens area to account for reference purposes. Concentrations determined via the two techniques were found to be in statistical agreement. The concentration of 238 U in the samples collected at the Megalopolis basin varies from 2. 2 ± 0. 6 to 90 ± 14 mBq/L, and is 5 - 40 times higher than the concentration of 238 U in the sample collected in Athens.

40|$|In {{the current}} study, the {{evolution}} of the composition of fly ash (FA), since the beginning of operation of the <b>lignite-fired</b> <b>power</b> <b>station</b> of Amynteon-Filotas [Steam Electric Station (SES) Amynteon-Filotas] in Greece, is presented. The respective evolution of the feedcoal-composition is also showed. This power station began to operate in 1987. Before that, it was predicted that lignite fly ash would turn from strongly calcareous to barely pozzolanic. Moreover, the variation of sulphur (%) (both total and volatile) in feedcoal had revealed that fly ash would not often meat the specifications {{to be used in the}} production process of concrete, due to the excessive percentage presence of SO 3. These predictions were eventually confirmed in the 23 years of operation of the power station. During these years SO 3 (%) kept alternating, rendering-in some cases-fly ash suitable for use in cement industry applications. The periodical changes of the SO 3 concentration in fly ash were attributed to the free (volatile) sulphur of feedcoal as well as to the excess of FeS 2, which had also a serious effect on the daily power production process (severe erosion of the metallic surfaces of boiler). A number of solutions for tackling this phenomenon are suggested in this study: discard of specific FA grain fractions, intense monitoring of the material and its effective mixture-homogenization and selective mining of lignite. © Springer Science+Business Media B.

40|$|The {{environmental}} and socio-economic impacts of biomass utilization by co-firing with brown coal in an existing thermoelectric unit in Greece or through its pure combustion {{in a new}} plant were studied and evaluated in this work. The 125 MW, <b>lignite-fired</b> <b>power</b> plant in Ptolemais <b>Power</b> <b>Station</b> (Western Macedonia) was used as reference system. The environmental benefits of the alternative biomass exploitation options were quantified based on the life cycle assessment methodology, as established by SETAC, while the BIOSEM technique was used to carry out socio-economic calculations. The obtained results showed clear environmental benefits of both biomass utilization alternatives {{in comparison with the}} reference system. In addition, co-firing biomass with lignite in an existing unit outperforms the combustion of biomass exclusively in a new plant, since it exhibits a better environmental performance and it is a low risk investment with immediate benefits. A biomass combustion unit requires a considerably higher capital investment and its benefits are more evident in the long run. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Coal- and <b>lignite-fired</b> <b>power</b> plants produce {{significant}} amounts of ashes, which are quite often being used as additives in cement and other building materials. In many cases, coal and lignite present high concentrations of naturally occurring radionuclides, such as U- 238, Ra- 226, Pb- 210, Th- 232 and K- 40. During the combustion process, the produced ashes are enriched in the above radionuclides. The different enrichment of the various radionuclides within a radioactive series, {{such as that of}} 238 U, results in the disturbance of radioactive secular equilibrium. An extensive research project for the determination of the natural radioactivity of lignite and ashes from Greek <b>lignite-fired</b> <b>power</b> plants is in progress in the Nuclear Engineering Department of the National Technical University of Athens (NED-NTUA) since 1983. This paper presents detailed results for the natural radioactivity, the secular radioactive equilibrium disturbance and the radon exhalation rate of the fly-ash collected at the different stages along the emission control system of a <b>lignite-fired</b> <b>power</b> plant {{as well as of the}} bottom-ash. From the results obtained so far, it may be concluded that Ra- 226 radioactivity of fly-ash in some cases exceeds 1 kBq kg(- 1), which is much higher than the mean Ra- 226 radioactivity of surface soils in Greece (25 Bq kg(- 1)). Furthermore, the radioactivity of Pb- 210 in fly-ash may reach 4 kBq kg(- 1). These results are interpreted in relation to the physical properties of the investigated nuclides, the temperature in the flue-gas pathway, as well as the fly-ash grain size distribution. It is concluded that towards the coldest parts of the emission control system of the power plant, the radioactivity of some natural nuclides is gradually enhanced, secular radioactive equilibrium is significantly disturbed and the radon exhalation rate tends to increase.
