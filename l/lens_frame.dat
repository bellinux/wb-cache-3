30|$|A {{prototype}} of the progressive multifocal lens was made as shown in Fig. 8, the aperture of the prototype lens is 30  mm and the structure includes two kinds of PDMS membranes are bonded together after being treated by the oxygen plasma, the PMMA plate is as the substrate and connect with PDMS via an adhesive film, three parts of edge clamped as the constraint and the pinhole is used to input and output the liquid for the lens. In the experiment, the lens is fixed by an adjustable <b>lens</b> <b>frame</b> and placed on the XY-axis manual adjustment frame. Furthermore, a syringe is used to pressurize the liquid into the cavity of the lens via a capillary tube and the micro laser displacement sensor is {{used to measure the}} deformation value of the lens surface.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{develop a}} {{magnetic}} resonance (MR) -compatible, versatile, easy-to-use, and low-cost device for refractive correction. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the application and practicability of the refractive correction in 110 subjects who {{had participated in}} various functional MR imaging (fMRI) studies with complex visual stimulation paradigms since the introduction of the MR-compatible <b>lens</b> <b>frame</b> at our site. The subjects consisted of 31 patients with Parkinson''s disease (age range, 40 - 85; mean age, 63. 2 years) and 79 healthy volunteers (age range, 18 - 79; mean age, 46. 7 years). Results: In volunteers, experimentally induced myopia caused a substantial (> 20 %) reduction of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response to a flickering dartboard. Conclusion: Refractive errors (and the resulting optical blur) may play a nonnegligible role as a possible interfering factor in fMRI experiments with visual stimuli. The MR-compatible frame (fitted with appropriate lenses) used in this study affords full refractive correction at reasonable cost and preparation tim...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{widespread}} {{availability of}} portable computing power and inexpensive digital cameras is opening up new possibilities for retailers. One example is in optical shops, where {{a number of}} systems exist that facilitate eyeglasses selection. These systems are now more necessary as the market is saturated with an increasingly complex array of <b>lenses,</b> <b>frames,</b> coatings, tints, photochromic and polarizing treatments, etc. Research challenges encompass Computer Vision, Multimedia and Human-Computer Interaction. Cost factors are also of importance for widespread product acceptance. This paper describes a low-cost system that allows the user to visualize different spectacle models in live video. The user can also move the spectacles to adjust its position on the face. Experiments show {{the potential of the}} system. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{reports the}} {{fabrication}} and characterization of inter-digitated piezoelectric actuation mechanism for application in micro-optics. The device consists of eight piezoelectric actuators symmetrically attaching the rigid <b>lens</b> holder <b>frame</b> to the bulk Si.

Each actuator is driven by a set of inter-digitated Pt(0. 13 μm) /Ti(0. 05 μm) top electrodes of dimensions 10 μm width and 5 μm spacing on 800 μm length of PZT film.

50|$|Because {{they lack}} frames, rimless glasses can sustain damage {{more easily than}} other {{eyeglasses}} designs; eyeglass labs throughout the United States report that consumers are two to ten {{times more likely to}} require new <b>lenses</b> in three-piece <b>frames</b> than any other eyeglass design. This is nominally a result of the material used to produce the lenses: Although relatively durable inside of frames, CR-39 lacks impact resistance and cannot absorb the wear and tear of constant stress to the lenses caused by putting on, wearing, and removing glasses. Rimways fare much better with CR-39 because the arches absorb shock and stress. The implementation of polycarbonate—the material used to make bullet proof glass—in addition to making rimless glasses even lighter, reduces the glasses' fragility as polycarbonate can endure a great amount of stress and is highly impact resistant. To ensure both the longevity of the glasses and as a safety precaution, more optical labs are refusing to mount CR-39 <b>lenses</b> in rimless <b>frames,</b> and British optical labs have uniformly adopted a policy of only processing polycarbonate <b>lenses</b> for rimless <b>frames.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Political {{socialization}} is the [...] "process {{by which}} individuals learn and frequently internalize a political <b>lens</b> <b>framing</b> {{their perceptions of}} how power is arranged and how {{the world around them}} is (and should be) organized; those perceptions, in turn, shape and define individuals' definitions of who they are and how they should behave in the political and economic institutions in which they live." [...] Political socialization also encompasses the way in which people acquire values and opinions that shape their political stance and ideology: it is a [...] "study of the developmental processes by which people of all ages and adolescents acquire political cognition, attitudes, and behaviors." [...] It refers to a learning process by which norms and behaviors acceptable to a well running political system are transmitted from one generation to another. It is through the performance of this function that individuals are inducted into the political culture and their orientations towards political objects are formed. Schools, media, and the state have a major influence in this process.|$|R
