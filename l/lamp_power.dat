25|$|<b>Lamp</b> <b>power</b> also {{influences}} colour in tungsten lamps. As the <b>lamp</b> <b>power</b> is decreased, the {{tungsten filament}} in a bulb {{will tend to}} produce increasing percentages of orange light, {{as compared to the}} nearly white light emitted at full power. This is known as amber drift or amber shift. Thus a 1000-watt instrument at 50 percent power will emit a higher percentage of orange light than a 500-watt instrument operating at full power.|$|E
25|$|Intensity is {{measured}} in lux, lumens and foot-candles. The intensity of a luminaire (lighting instrument or fixture) depends {{on a number of}} factors including its <b>lamp</b> <b>power,</b> the design of the instrument (and its efficiency), optical obstructions such as colour gels or mechanical filters, the distance to the area to be lit and the beam or field angle of the fixture, the colour and material to be lit, and the relative contrasts to other regions of illumination.|$|E
25|$|Sizing of a UV {{system is}} {{affected}} by three variables: flow rate, <b>lamp</b> <b>power,</b> and UV transmittance in the water. Manufacturers typically developed sophisticated Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models validated with bioassay testing. This involves testing the UV reactor's disinfection performance with either MS2 or T1 bacteriophages at various flow rates, UV transmittance, and power levels {{in order to develop}} a regression model for system sizing. For example, this is a requirement for all drinking water systems in the United States per the EPA UV Guidance Manual.|$|E

50|$|South Foreland was {{the first}} {{lighthouse}} to use an electric light. This was in 1859. By 1875 the lighthouse was using carbon arc <b>lamps</b> <b>powered</b> by a steam-driven magneto.|$|R
50|$|The initial light system {{produced}} a constant red light, using <b>lamps</b> <b>powered</b> by olive oil. This was replaced in 1896 by a rotating optic system {{supplied by the}} Chance Brothers of Smethwick, which used a rotating table coupled with a Fresnel lens to produce an alternating red and white flash every thirty seconds. The apparatus was powered by a weight slowly descending from the lantern room, which drove a clockwork mechanism turning the table at a set rotation. It was lit using <b>lamps</b> <b>powered</b> by paraffin, which was stored in a copper tank with ornate brass fittings.|$|R
25|$|The {{efficacy}} of fluorescent tubes ranges from about 16 {{lumens per watt}} for a 4 watt tube with an ordinary ballast to over 100 lumens per watt with a modern electronic ballast, commonly averaging 50 to 67lm/W overall. Most compact fluorescents above 13 watts with integral electronic ballasts achieve about 60lm/W. Lamps are rated by lumens after 100 hours of operation. For a given fluorescent tube, a high-frequency electronic ballast gives about a 10% efficacy improvement over an inductive ballast. It is necessary to include the ballast loss when evaluating the {{efficacy of}} a fluorescent lamp system; this can be about 25% of the <b>lamp</b> <b>power</b> with magnetic ballasts, and around 10% with electronic ballasts.|$|E
2500|$|Electronic {{starters}} only {{attempt to}} start a lamp {{for a short time}} when power is initially applied, and do not repeatedly attempt to restrike a lamp that is dead and unable to sustain an arc; some automatically shut down a failed lamp. This eliminates the re-striking of a lamp and the continuous flickering of a failing lamp with a glow starter. Electronic starters are not subject to wear and do not need replacing periodically, although they may fail like any other electronic circuit. Manufacturers typically quote lives of 20 years, or as long as the light fitting. Starters are inexpensive, typically less than 50¢ for the short-lived glow type (depending upon <b>lamp</b> <b>power),</b> and perhaps ten times more for the electronic type [...]|$|E

50|$|Incandescent and Halogen lamps {{naturally}} have a {{power factor}} of 1, but Compact fluorescent and LED lamps use input rectifiers and this causes lower power factors. Low power factors {{can result in}} surcharges for commercial energy users; CFL and LED lamps are available with driver circuits to provide any desired power factor, or site-wide power factor correction can be performed. EU standards requires a power factor better than 0.5 for <b>lamp</b> <b>powers</b> up to 25 Watt and above 0.9 for higher <b>power</b> <b>lamps.</b>|$|R
50|$|Miniger {{entered the}} {{automotive}} industry in 1911. At the time, automobile headlamps were carbide <b>lamps</b> <b>powered</b> by acetylene gas. Two men in Indiana had patented an electric headlamp which Miniger believed would replace gas-powered lamps on automobilies. Mininger purchased the patent rights to this new electric headlight in 1911. Moving back to Toledo, he formed the Auto-liter Company.|$|R

50|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{was equipped}} with a third-order dioptoric beacon with a 500 mm focal length, moved by clockwork turntable, serving a 28 mi range. The lighthouse became operational on 28 January 1925, utilizing a <b>lamp</b> <b>powered</b> by diesel generator, which was later converted to incandescent light in 1938, allowing the beacon extend its range to 35 mi. In 1938, a plane crashed {{in the vicinity of}} the lighthouse.|$|R

5000|$|An {{amalgam of}} {{metallic}} sodium and mercury {{lies at the}} coolest part of the lamp and provides the sodium and mercury vapor {{that is needed to}} draw an arc. The temperature of the amalgam is determined to a great extent by <b>lamp</b> <b>power.</b> The higher the <b>lamp</b> <b>power,</b> the higher will be the amalgam temperature. The higher the temperature of the amalgam, the higher will be the mercury and sodium vapor pressures in the lamp and the higher will be the terminal voltage. As the temperature rises, the constant current and increasing voltage consumes increasing energy until the operating level of power is reached. For a given voltage, there are generally three modes of operation: ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{superplastic forming}} {{is used in}} {{aeronautics}} in order to manufacture titanium parts with complex shapes. Regarding to others forming processes, {{it is important to}} save costs of superplastic forming. Using Infra-Red lamps to heat directly the blank is an economic way to raise the temperature as the heating time is cut to a few minutes instead of 24 hours. The tool core is not completely heated anymore, leading to greater efficiencies. Radiative flux model was developed and complex thermomechanical simulations have been used as a predicting tool of the infra-red <b>lamps</b> <b>power.</b> The <b>lamps</b> <b>power</b> is adjusted throughout the forming step in order to obtain an optimized flux and thus to ensure a homogeneous temperature of the blank during the superplastic forming. Through these simulations, several TA 6 V sheets with a size of 500 x 500 mm 2 were successfully formed by using this technology. The microstructure is not affected by the quick heating phase. Secondly, an aircraft part with a size of 1500 x 1000 mm 2 were likewise formed which demonstrates the efficiency of the IR heating for the industrial superplastic forming...|$|R

Other interior options included rear seat vents (in the five-seater), rear center rear armrest, and eight-way power seats {{for both the}} driver and passenger, as well as personal reading <b>lamps.</b> <b>Power</b> windows and central door locks were standard on all Concordes, as were dual airbags. Other options included remote keyless system and a choice of several Infinity sound systems with CD, cassette with up to eight speakers and an equalizer.|$|R
50|$|Until 2000 the new {{lighthouse}} was operated {{with electricity}} through a 50KV cable {{from the country}} and also had a backup of acetylene and an exterior facade lighting. Racon was also installed. When the lighthouse was converted to solar cell operation in 2000, the <b>lamp</b> <b>power</b> was amended to 20 W {{and the range of}} visibility dropped to half of before.|$|E
50|$|Colours {{were created}} using the same, radial DICHRO*TUNE {{mechanism}} {{that had been}} developed for the VL5. As with the VL5, {{there was also a}} set of diffuser vanes to alter the beam width. A further set of black metal vanes were used to control intensity, as the luminaire employed a 500W discharge lamp as a light source, driven by an internal <b>lamp</b> <b>power</b> supply.|$|E
50|$|The VL7 spot {{luminaire}} {{marked a}} return to a much larger design. As a Series 300 luminaire, it could be controlled by either Series 200 data from an Artisan console, or DMX512 data from a third party lighting console, via a VLSR unit.
