40|$|This {{essay is}} devoted to the Czech avant-garde stage-adapter from the 1930 's and 1940 's, Emil František Burian and his theatre D 34 (also called “Dečko”). Burian adapted the output of the romantic poet, Karel Hynek Mácha, for the stage, using it to explore and express his {{conception}} of avant-garde theatre. In the words of Burian, Mácha was the “Czech Shakespeare”, far from any realism, so the meaning of his output, staged in the traditional, realistic theatre, was distorted. Trying to find the right way of staging Mácha, Burian finds his own idea of the new theatre, inspired by the conceptions of the Russian stageadapters Vakhtangov and Tairov. The most important categories in the Burian’s theatre were: motion, light and music. Burian was {{looking for a way to}} translate the <b>language</b> <b>of</b> unrealistic, romantic literature into the modern <b>language</b> <b>of</b> theatre. In <b>cooperation</b> with M.

It provides background information on the current migration flows between Latvia, Estonia, Finland and Sweden {{as well as information}} on the national labour markets and current labour demand in each of the countries. This report is the final report of the INTERREG IVA project "CentralBaltic JobFerry". Based on statistical data and stakeholder interviews conducted in the Latvia, Estonia, South West Finland and Östergötland/Sweden, the report notes that countries in the Central Baltic region are facing labour shortage in the health care, social services, ICT and construction sectors. There is an increased need for specialised and skilled labour force in those sectors. The EU has identified cross-border labour mobility as a way to increase the matching of labour demand and supply. However the actual intra-EU cross-border labour mobility remains low. The report identifies the main obstacles to labour mobility based on stakeholder interviews and policy reviews. Lack <b>of</b> <b>language</b> skills, lack <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> between relevant labour market actors and authorities, lack of easily available information as well as problems with the portability of pension rights and social benefits are the main factors that impede the mobility of workers in the Central Baltic region. To tackle these issues, increased cooperation is needed both within countries and regions and across borders. The CentralBaltic JobFerry project has published a separate policy brief presenting several policy recommendations targeted at regional, national and EU level actors.

At the second level the paper focuses on the differences between the principle <b>of</b> loyal <b>cooperation,</b> the way commitments are met in international public law, and the mechanisms of ensuring loyalty in countries with a federal structure.

An empirical examination on the effect relationships {{from the point of}} view of 164 SME managers provides tentative proof of the effect relationships postulated, namely in a comparison <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> activities with and without capital investment.
