[...] "I think this is an attempt to improve the image of the current government, a little, before the Sochi Olympics — particularly for the Western Europeans. But I don't consider this humane or merciful. This is a lie." [...] Tolokonnikova also said, [...] "Whether one <b>likes</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> going to the Olympics in Russia is an acceptance of the internal political situation in Russia, an acceptance of the course taken by a person who is interested in the Olympics above all else — Vladimir Putin." ...|$|E
500|$|Many social facts, however, have no {{material}} form. Even the most [...] "individualistic" [...] or [...] "subjective" [...] phenomena, such as love, freedom or suicide, would be regarded by Durkheim as objective social facts. Individuals composing society do not directly cause suicide: suicide, {{as a social}} fact, exists independently in society, and is caused by other social facts (such as rules governing behavior and group attachment), whether an individual <b>likes</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> Whether a person [...] "leaves" [...] a society does not alter {{the fact that this}} society will still contain suicides. Suicide, like other immaterial social facts, exists independently of the will of an individual, cannot be eliminated, and is as influential – coercive – as physical laws such as gravity. Sociology's task thus consists of discovering the qualities and characteristics of such social facts, which can be discovered through a quantitative or experimental approach (Durkheim extensively relied on statistics).|$|E
500|$|Angelou soon {{discovers that}} her fellow Black expatriates [...] "share similar delusions" [...] {{and that their}} {{feelings}} towards Ghana and its people are not reciprocated. [...] Lupton states, [...] "Angelou's alliance with the African-American community often focuses on their indignation over the Ghanaians' refusal to fully welcome them". [...] Angelou uses the parallel demonstration to King's 1963 March on Washington to demonstrate both her and her fellow expatriates' tenuous relationship with Africa and her desire for full citizenship and assimilation, an [...] "unattainable goal that falls outside of her desire for assimilation" [...] and something she can never acquire in Ghana. [...] Not only is Angelou a Black American, whether she <b>likes</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> [...] "she is a Black American in exile". [...] Houston A. Baker, Jr., in his review of Traveling Shoes, states that Angelou is unable to experience a connection with what Angelou calls the [...] "soul" [...] of Africa, and that Angelou speculates that only the American Black, forcibly displaced and taken from the home of her ancestors, can truly understand [...] "that home {{is the place where}} one is created".|$|E

500|$|Several days later, still humming Lurleen's song, Homer {{drives to}} her mobile home {{to ask for}} a copy. Lurleen tells him she has not {{recorded}} the song, so Homer insists that she come to a recording company to record a CD. Homer grants the recording company clerk permission to play the song on the radio, and Lurleen's songs are an instant hit all over Springfield. At home, Marge asks Homer about Lurleen; he claims that she is just a waitress who is turning into a music superstar. Marge does not approve that he is seeing her, as she fears that something more will come of the relationship. Homer becomes Lurleen's manager, and to fit with the role, she buys him an expensive white cowboy suit which he wears at home. Marge is annoyed, and asks if he is having an affair. He denies it, and says whether Marge <b>likes</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> he is going to help Lurleen become a country music star. The whole family gathers at the recording studio with Lurleen to record more of her songs. Her new single, a suggestive love metaphor called [...] "Bagged Me a Homer", leads Marge to lose her temper.|$|E

[...] When asked if that could change Barger replied [...] "Anything can change, I can't predict the future". Tobie Levingston who formed the black motorcycle club East Bay Dragons MC wrote in his book that he and Sonny Barger have a long-lasting friendship and that the Hells Angels and Dragons have a mutual friendship and hang out and ride together.|$|E

2500|$|To {{cure the}} disease, it is {{necessary}} to produce a spout of smoke by burning off thirty-six charms, and instruct the patient to inhale and to swallow up its fumes, whether he <b>likes</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> By the time all charms are used up, the smoke should also be dispersed. It may be difficult for the patient to bear the odour of the smoke at first, but once he gets used to such a smell, it does not really matter. Whenever the patient feels that there is phlegm in his throat, he is advised to cough and spit it out. If the patient is greatly affected by the symptoms, it will be good if his spittle is thick and if he can spit it out. When the patient is less affected by the wicked ch'i, he does not have much phlegm to eject, but if he is deeply affected, he tends to vomit and to expectorate heavily until everything is cleared up, and then his illness is cured. When the wicked element is rooted out, it {{does not need to be}} fumigated any more [...]|$|E
2500|$|He survives by his wiles and self-belief, and {{exploits}} everyone, especially Terry. He {{is always}} {{trying to make a}} quick few quid and his schemes usually backfire and leave him either in debt to local underworld figures, or with his activities coming under the scrutiny of the police (or often a combination of both) - with Terry ultimately being left to sort out the mess and get him out of trouble. Arthur thinks of himself as an [...] "entrepreneur", but his tailored three-piece suits, Jaguar and social affectations do not disguise his working class accent and origins. Arthur tests Terry's patience with dishonest and doomed schemes to make money ("nice little earners"), then uses his cunning to persuade Terry to stay with him. In the same way, Arthur manipulates friends such as Dave, the barman (and part owner with Arthur) of the private, if downmarket, [...] "Winchester Club". Arthur refers to his wife, who never appeared, as [...] "'er indoors"; the implication that she is a fierce and formidable woman is reinforced by the appearance of actress Claire Davenport (famous for such roles) as her sister. Arthur is not above bending the law and sometimes attracts the keen attention of the local police. Despite being the one who we know has served time (Arthur having served time as well but this is only mentioned in one episode (Series 3, episode 13, [...] "In") and no further reference is made) it is Terry who serves as the show’s moral conscience, keeping Arthur from straying too far outside the law and persuading him {{to do the right thing}} whether Arthur <b>likes</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> The name Arthur Daley has become synonymous with a dishonest salesman or small-time crook.|$|E
2500|$|... "…Man has an {{unprecedented}} {{control over the}} world and everything in it. And so, whether he <b>likes</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> what happens next is very largely up to him." [...] He notes that when he spoke those words he could have had no idea that man might have unleashed forces that are now altering the Earth's climate. The naturalist highlights several meteorological and climatological catastrophes: Hurricane Katrina, the collapse of glaciers in Greenland, drought in the Amazon River, forest fires in Australia, and one of Europe's hottest summers (that caused 27,000 deaths). He wonders if, somehow, there is a connection between these events. Scientists {{all over the world are}} linking the changes in the Earth's weather to a global rise in temperatures. The actual figure is just 0.6°C since 1900, but this is only an average. For example, the Arctic has warmed by up to 3°C, and this threatens its whole ecosystem. A team has been surveying polar bears in the region for the last 25 years, and over that time, the animals have declined in number by a quarter. Each year the Arctic ice is also now melting three weeks earlier. The overall rate of glacier melt is accelerating: in southern Greenland, the amount of ice flowing into the sea has doubled in a decade, resulting in a rise of sea levels. This is exacerbated by the increase in temperatures, which causes oceans to expand. When Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, the sea temperatures of the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean were the highest ever recorded. In addition, the 2005 hurricane season was the worst ever. Scientists who have studied such severe weather warn that from now on hurricanes in the area will be more intense, more destructive and possibly more frequent. Also in 2005, the Amazon region suffered its worse drought in 60 years, decimating local fish populations. Six months later, trees have still not recovered. The abnormally warm seas in the Atlantic had disrupted the rainfall in the forest and for similar reasons, coral reefs are also at risk, leading to the phenomenon of coral bleaching.|$|E
