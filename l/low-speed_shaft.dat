50|$|The {{simplest}} transmissions, {{often called}} gearboxes to reflect their simplicity (although complex systems are also called gearboxes in the vernacular), provide gear reduction (or, more rarely, {{an increase in}} speed), sometimes {{in conjunction with a}} right-angle change in direction of the shaft (typically in helicopters, see picture). These are often used on PTO-powered agricultural equipment, since the axial PTO shaft is at odds with the usual need for the driven shaft, which is either vertical (as with rotary mowers), or horizontally extending {{from one side of the}} implement to another (as with manure spreaders, flail mowers, and forage wagons). More complex equipment, such as silage choppers and snowblowers, have drives with outputs in more than one direction.The gearbox in a wind turbine converts the slow, high-torque rotation of the turbine into much faster rotation of the electrical generator. These are much larger and more complicated than the PTO gearboxes in farm equipment. They weigh several tons and typically contain three stages to achieve an overall gear ratio from 40:1 to over 100:1, depending on the size of the turbine. (For aerodynamic and structural reasons, larger turbines have to turn more slowly, but the generators all have to rotate at similar speeds of several thousand rpm.) The first stage of the gearbox is usually a planetary gear, for compactness, and to distribute the enormous torque of the turbine over more teeth of the <b>low-speed</b> <b>shaft.</b> Durability of these gearboxes has been a serious problem for a long time.|$|E
40|$|An {{instability}} {{associated with}} an intershaft squeeze film damper is described. The squeeze film is located between the intershaft bearing outer race and the <b>low-speed</b> <b>shaft</b> of a five-bearing, two-spool test rig. The instability is dominated by response of the third system mode to destabilizing excitation of the type described by Hibner, et al. Installing a spring cage {{in place of the}} intershaft damper removes the instability and produces satisfactory performance throughout the operating range...|$|E
30|$|Despite major {{technological}} {{improvements that}} have been achieved, the intermittent nature of wind power generation remains a hindrance in the adoption of technology. This error is because of many parameters that happen to be at wind turbine rotor and generator. Variation in voltage fluctuation or variation in speed between high-speed shaft and <b>low-speed</b> <b>shaft</b> varies the rotation of wind turbines. Other parameters such as encoder failure, sensor failure and software failure also affect the performance of WTGs.|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} basic {{types of}} gear reduction concepts were studied as being feasible power train systems for a low-bypass-ratio, single-spool, geared turbofan engine for general aircraft use: (1) single-stage external-internal reduction, (2) gears (offset shafting), (3) multiple compound idler gear system (concentric shafting), and (4) star gear planetary system with internal ring gear final output member (concentric shafting-counterrotation). In addition, studies {{were made of}} taking the accessories drive power off both the high-speed and <b>low-speed</b> <b>shafting,</b> using either face gears or spiral bevel gears. Both antifriction and sleeve-type bearings were considered for the external-internal and star-planet reduction concepts...|$|R
40|$|Conventional accelerometers {{installed}} on housing often give out less accurate diagnostic results for planetary gearbox because the mesh excitation of planet gears change with carrier movement. Recent significant advancements in low-power and low-cost Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technologies {{make it possible}} and easier to mount MEMS accelerometers directly on the rotating shaft, enabling more accurate dynamic characteristics of the rotating machine to be acquired and used for condition monitoring. In this paper, two tiny MEMS accelerometers are installed diametrically opposite {{each other on the}} lowspeed input shaft of a planetary gearbox to measure the acceleration signals. The acceleration signals sensed by each MEMS will contain both the tangential acceleration and gravitational acceleration, but the latter can be removed by summing the acceleration signals from both sensors in order to characterise the rotor dynamics precisely. The experimental results show that the tangential acceleration measured on the <b>low-speed</b> input <b>shaft</b> of a planetary gearbox can clearly indicate faults, thus providing a reliable and lowcost method for planetary gearbox condition monitoring...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} analytical, simulation, {{and practical}} analyses of a variable speed magnetic gearbox (MG) that uses contra-rotating (CR) input shafts. The CR turbine comprises {{two sets of}} rotors one behind the other: one rotor rotates in a clockwise direction while the other rotor rotates in an anticlockwise direction. Our magnetic gear magnetically combines the two CR input shafts into a single variable speed output shaft, and consists of three rotating parts: two contra-rotating <b>low-speed</b> input <b>shafts</b> and a single high-speed output shaft. Theoretical analysis is presented to show how to control {{the speed of the}} output shaft via control of the speeds of the two input shafts. This analysis is then supported by simulation and experimentation. The paper discusses the MG torque transmission capability by presenting pull-out torque test results and efficiency information when being driven through the different load torque shafts. The effective ratio of the MG is explained in terms of its torque curve result. A prototype gearbox was built, having been designed with an electromagnetic finite-element software package, and evaluated using a practical test rig...|$|R
40|$|The overall dynamic {{behaviour}} and hence {{performance of a}} grid-connected constant speed honzontal-axis wind turbine {{is due to a}} combination of the structural dynamics, the drive-train and generator dynamics and. when appropriate, the control system dynamics. A dynamically well-behaved machine requires that the drive-train dynamics complement in some sense the other wind turbine dynamics. In this, the first part of a two part paper, the dynamics of the drive-train are investigated. Although a composite of many dynamic modes of the tower, blades, hub, <b>low-speed</b> <b>shaft,</b> gearbox, gear-train, high-speed shaft and generator rotor. the drive-train dynamics can be represented by a simple model. The simple model approximates very closely to the drive-train dynamics for almost all constant speed wind turbines...|$|E
40|$|The Long-term Inflow and Structural Test (LIST) {{program is}} {{collecting}} long-term inflow and structural response data {{to characterize the}} spectrum of loads on wind turbines. In one of the measurement campaigns being conducted under this program, the 42 -m diameter, 600 -kW NWTC Advanced Research Turbine (ART) was monitored. The inflow was monitored with a planar array of five high-resolution sonic anemometers and supporting meteorological instrumentation located 1. 5 diameters upwind of the turbine. The structural response of the turbine was measured using strain gauges circuits and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). The former was used to monitor root bending moments and the <b>low-speed</b> <b>shaft</b> torque, while the latter were used to monitor {{the motion of the}} tower and the nacelle. Auxiliary gauges measured blade pitch, rotor teeter, nacelle yaw and generator power. A total of 3299 10 -minute records were collected for analysis. From this set, 1044 records are used to examine the influence of various inflow parameters on fatigue loads. Long-term fatigue loads and extreme loads are also examined...|$|E
40|$|Simulation {{models of}} a variable-speed, {{fixed-pitch}} wind turbine were investigated {{to evaluate the}} feasibility of constraining rotor speed and power output {{without the benefit of}} active aerodynamic control devices. A strategy was postulated to control rotational speed by specifying the demanded generator torque. By controlling rotor speed in relation to wind speed, the aerodynamic power extracted by the blades from the wind was manipulated. Specifically, the blades were caused to stall in high winds. In low and moderate winds, the demanded generator torque and the resulting rotor speed were controlled to cause the wind turbine to operate near maximum efficiency. Using the developed models, simulations were conducted of operation in turbulent winds. Results indicated that rotor speed and power output were well regulated. Preliminary investigations of system dynamics showed that, compared to fixed-speed operation, variable-speed operation caused cyclic loading amplitude to be reduced for the turbine blades and <b>low-speed</b> <b>shaft</b> and slightly increased for the tower loads. This result suggests a favorable impact on fatigue life from implementation of the proposed control strategy...|$|E
40|$|International audience—The paper {{presents}} a nonlinear approach, using a two-mass model and a wind speed estimator, for variable-speed wind turbine (WT) control. The {{use of a}} two-mass model is motivated {{by the need to}} deal with flexible modes induced by the <b>low-speed</b> <b>shaft</b> stiffness. The main objective of the proposed controllers is the wind power capture optimization while limiting transient loads on the drive-train components. This paper starts by an adaptation of some existing control strategies. However, their performance are weak, as the dynamics aspects of the wind and aeroturbine are not taken into consideration. In order to bring some improvements, nonlinear static and dynamic state feedback controllers, with a wind speed estimator, are then proposed. Concerning the wind speed estimator, the idea behind this is to exploit the WT dynamics by itself as a measurement device. All these methods have been first tested and validated using an aeroelastic WT simulator. A comparative study between the proposed controllers is performed. The results show better performance for the non-linear dynamic controller with estimator in comparison with the adapted existing methods.

40|$|A {{major goal}} of the federal Wind Energy Program is the rapid {{development}} and validation of structural models to determine loads and response {{for a wide variety}} of different wind turbine configurations operating under extreme conditions. Such codes are crucial to the successful design of future advanced wind turbines. In previous papers the authors described steps they took to develop a model of a two-bladed teetering-hub downwind wind turbine using ADAMS{reg_sign} (Automatic Dynamic Analysis of Mechanical Systems), as well as comparison of model predictions to test data. In this paper they show the use of this analytical model to study the influence of various turbine parameters on predicted system loads. They concentrate their study on turbine response in the frequency range of six to ten times the rotor rotational frequency (6 P to 10 P). Their goal is to identify the most important parameters which influence the response of this type of machine in this frequency range and give turbine designers some general design guidelines for designing two-bladed teetering-hub machines to be less susceptible to vibration. They study the effects of such parameters as blade edgewise and flapwise stiffness, tower top stiffness, blade tip-brake mass, <b>low-speed</b> <b>shaft</b> stiffness, nacelle mass momenta of inertia, and rotor speed. They show which parameters can be varied in order to make the turbine less responsive to such atmospheric inputs as wind shear and tower shadow. They then give designers a set of design guidelines in order to show how these machines can be designed to be less responsive to these inputs...|$|E
40|$|Electric {{machines}} are indispensable part in modern industry {{and they are}} widely used in many applications such as power generation, vehicles, elevator, robot, and so on. Owing to {{the diversity of the}} application occasions, different requirements have been proposed. In the applications, such as wind power generation, low-speed, high-torque and high-efficiency electric {{machines are}} required to match with the low-speed load. Currently, this problem is handled by either adopting a speed-boost mechanical gear, or using low-speed machine design. The former one causes mechanical wear and tear, audible noise and low efficiency, whereas the latter one increases the generator size and weight as well as raw material cost. In recent years, another option, namely integrating a coaxial magnetic gear into a permanent-magnet (PM) machine has been proposed. This option allows for directly mounting the outer, <b>low-speed</b> <b>shaft</b> with the load while enables the electric machine coupled with the high-speed inner gear to operate at high speeds. However, this magnetic-geared electric machine desires a complex structure, involving two rotating bodies and three air-gaps, which increases manufacture difficulty and cost. The research work of this thesis attempts to solve the speed-matching problem by developing a new electric machine. The incorporation of vernier concept with PM machine gives birth to the permanent-magnet verier (PMV) machine. Different from traditional synchronous machine, the rotor of the PMV machine rotates at a definite fraction of the synchronous speed, as if it were geared down from the high rotating field set up by the stator. The PMV machine, therefore, can be regarded as a combination of a gear with fixed gear ratio and an electric machine. This kind of machine is attractive in applications which require low speed and high torque, and mechanical gearing is undesirable. The main objective of this thesis is to present the design, analysis and control of the proposed PMV machine. After the introduction on mechanical gears, magnetic gears, and low-speed machines, the design details of the proposed outer-rotor PMV machine are provided. Moreover, the working principle, stable torque generation mechanism and structural features are presented. Due to the introduced vernier effect, it is important to perform the finite element analysis (FEA) for the proposed PMV machine. The electric circuit equation and the motion equation are coupled with the Maxwell’s equation to calculate the key parameters of the proposed machine. The analysis results of the magnetic field distributions, air-gap flux density distributions, flux linkages, winding inductances, back electromotive forces (EMFs), cogging torque and static torque are presented in detail. The performances of PMV machine are compared with other machines to show its advantages and disadvantages. The control strategy of the PMV machine as a brushless DC machine is also presented. The conventional 120 -degree conducting, dual-closed-loop control strategy is used for speed and torque control and the experimental setup are given. The results are obtained and compared with the simulation results, thus verify the validity of the design. Finally, the potential applications for the proposed PMV machine are suggested. published_or_final_versionElectrical and Electronic EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
