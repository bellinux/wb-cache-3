5|$|Specific {{genes that}} have been linked with MS include {{differences}} in the human <b>leukocyte</b> antigen (HLA) system—a group of genes on chromosome 6 {{that serves as the}} major histocompatibility complex (MHC). That changes in the HLA region are related to susceptibility has been known since the 1980s, and additionally this same region has been implicated in the development of other autoimmune diseases such as diabetes type I and systemic lupus erythematosus. The most consistent finding is the association between multiple sclerosis and alleles of the MHC defined as DR15 and DQ6. Other loci have shown a protective effect, such as HLA-C554 and HLA-DRB1*11. Overall, {{it has been estimated that}} HLA changes account for between 20 and 60% of the genetic predisposition. Modern genetic methods (genome-wide association studies) have discovered at least twelve other genes outside the HLA locus that modestly increase the probability of MS.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{has been}} shown to have at least three {{additional}} modes of action. It uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in cartilaginous (and hepatic) mitochondria, by diffusing from the inner membrane space as a proton carrier back into the mitochondrial matrix, where it ionizes once again to release protons. Aspirin buffers and transports the protons. When high doses are given, it may actually cause fever, owing to the heat released from the electron transport chain, as opposed to the antipyretic action of aspirin seen with lower doses. In addition, aspirin induces the formation of NO-radicals in the body, which have been shown in mice to have an independent mechanism of reducing inflammation. This reduced <b>leukocyte</b> adhesion is an important step in the immune response to infection; however, evidence is insufficient to show aspirin helps to fight infection. More recent data also suggest salicylic acid and its derivatives modulate signaling through NF-κB. NF-κB, a transcription factor complex, plays a central role in many biological processes, including inflammation.|$|E
40|$|Phagocytosis {{and killing}} by {{polymorphonuclear}} and mononuclear <b>leukocytes</b> are important host resistance factors against invading microorganisms. Evidence showing that killing is rapidly followed by degradation of bacterial components is limited. Therefore, we studied {{the fate of}} Escherichia coli DNA following phagocytosis of E. coli by polymorphonuclear and mononuclear <b>leukocytes.</b> [3 H]thymidine-labeled, unencapsulated E. coli PC 2166 and E. coli 048 K 1 were incubated in serum, washed, and added to <b>leukocytes.</b> Uptake and killing of the bacteria and degradation of DNA were measured. Although phagocytosis and killing by mononuclear <b>leukocytes</b> was less efficient than that by polymorphonuclear <b>leukocytes,</b> only mononuclear <b>leukocytes</b> were able to degrade E. coli PC 2166 DNA. Within 2 h, 60 % of the radioactivity added to mononuclear <b>leukocytes</b> was released into the supernate, of which 40 % was acid soluble. DNA of E. coli 048 K 1 was not degraded. To further analyze the capacity of mononuclear <b>leukocytes</b> to degrade E. coli DNA, chromosomal and plasmid DNA was isolated from ingested bacteria and subjected to agarose gel-electrophoresis. Only chromosomal DNA was degraded after phagocytosis. Plasmid DNA of E. coli carrying a gene coding for ampicillin resistance remained intact for a 2 -h period after ingestion, and {{was still able to}} transform recipient E. coli cells after this period. Although we observed no DNA degradation during phagocytosis by polymorphonuclear <b>leukocytes,</b> lysates of both polymorphonuclear and mononuclear <b>leukocytes</b> contained acid-DNase activity with a pH optimum of 4. 9.

5|$|The {{mechanism}} that {{is thought to}} have a significant influence on delayed effects involves formed blood cells and chemical mediators, which cause brain lipid peroxidation (degradation of unsaturated fatty acids). Carbon monoxide causes endothelial cell and platelet release of nitric oxide, and the formation of oxygen free radicals including peroxynitrite. In the brain this causes further mitochondrial dysfunction, capillary leakage, <b>leukocyte</b> sequestration, and apoptosis. The result of these effects is lipid peroxidation, which causes delayed reversible demyelinization of white matter in the central nervous system known as Grinker myelinopathy, which can lead to edema and necrosis within the brain. This brain damage occurs mainly during the recovery period. This may result in cognitive defects, especially affecting memory and learning, and movement disorders. These disorders are typically related to damage to the cerebral white matter and basal ganglia. Hallmark pathological changes following poisoning are bilateral necrosis of the white matter, globus pallidus, cerebellum, hippocampus and the cerebral cortex.|$|E
25|$|<b>Leukocyte</b> {{adhesion}} deficiency (LAD) is {{a genetic}} disease {{associated with a}} defect in the <b>leukocyte</b> extravasation process, caused by a defective integrin β2 chain (found in LFA-1 and Mac-1).

40|$|Introduction: Renal ischemia-reperfusion (IR) induces organ {{damage in}} remote organs such as liver, brain and lung. The {{aim of this}} study was to assess the role of <b>leukocytes</b> in the {{induction}} of liver damage after renal IR injury. Methods: Inbred mice were subjected to either sham operation or bilateral renal IR injury (60 min ischemia followed by 3 h reperfusion). Mice were then anesthetized for collection of <b>leukocytes</b> by heart puncture. Isolated <b>leukocytes</b> were transferred to two other groups: intact recipient mice that received <b>leukocytes</b> from IR mice and intact recipient mice that received <b>leukocytes</b> from sham-operated control mice. After 24 h, recipient mice were anesthetized and blood and hepatic samples were collected. Results: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) increased significantly in intact recipient mice that received <b>leukocytes</b> from IR mice in comparison to intact recipient mice receiving <b>leukocytes</b> from sham-operated control mice. In addition, loss of normal liver architecture, cytoplasmic vacuolization and focal infiltration of <b>leukocytes</b> were observed. Conclusion: These results suggest that <b>leukocytes</b> are one of the possible factors that contribute to liver damage after renal IR injury and this damage is partly due to the induction of oxidative stress...|$|R

DNA-carcinogen adducts in <b>leukocytes</b> and {{putative}} {{target tissues}} (liver and urinary bladder) of C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were measured by 32 P-postlabeling and HPLC analysis after controlled {{exposure to the}} arylamine carcinogen 2 -aminofluorene (2 -AF). After an acute exposure via ip injection, adducts were detected at 3 hr in <b>leukocytes,</b> liver, and bladder. The disappearance of DNA-carcinogen adducts in liver and <b>leukocytes</b> were parallel over the 24 -hr period studied. Following a 7 -day continuous exposure to 2 -AF via drinking water, adduct levels in <b>leukocytes</b> and target tissues were responsive to dose at 30, 100, and 300 ppm. Adduct levels at the highest dose reached 17, 000 fmol/mg DNA in <b>leukocytes,</b> 1900 fmol/mg in liver, and 2300 fmol/mg in bladder. Although adduct levels after 7 days were highest in <b>leukocytes,</b> adducts were not detectable in <b>leukocytes</b> 7 days after discontinuing exposure.
