5|$|All of the localities that Eolambia were {{discovered}} in belong to the Mussentuchit Member of the Cedar Mountain Formation. Predominant rocks in the Mussentuchit consist of interleaved light gray to gray <b>layers</b> of muddy sandstone and mudstone. Deposits representing two separate river channel systems are also present in the Mussentuchit. The lower of these systems consists of four <b>layers,</b> respectively of muddy sandstone, fine-grained sandstone, silty mudstone, and fine-grained sandstone, with the latter two <b>layers</b> bearing plant debris. The Cifelli #2 Quarry is associated with this system. The upper system consists of greenish fine-grained sandstone. Three <b>layers</b> of bentonite clay <b>layers,</b> representing volcanic ash deposits, are also present in the Mussentuchit, being respectively whitish-gray, yellow, and tan in color. The middle of these <b>layers</b> cuts through the Cifelli #2 Quarry. Bentonite is also present within the sandstone itself throughout the Mussentuchit. In the Cifelli #2 quarry, the bones themselves are blackened, having been replaced by calcite, quartz, pyrite, and carbonate-hydroxyapatite.|$|E

40|$|<b>Layered</b> {{materials}} have been extensively studied and {{have found a}} wide range of applications predominately in the form of intercalated <b>layered</b> hybrids, or as exfoliated single <b>layer</b> nanosheets. Previous investigations in <b>layered</b> materials mainly focused on the preparation of <b>layered</b> intercalation compounds and obtaining single <b>layer</b> nanosheets. The preparation of <b>layered</b> intercalation compounds and exfoliation to obtain single <b>layer</b> nanosheets typically consists of two steps, where a <b>layered</b> material is first synthesized and subsequently intercalated/exfoliated through different approaches. However, the two step process is time consuming and inefficient. Moreover, the desired intercalation and exfoliation may not proceed as planned. Thus, it is highly desirable to explore new methodologies for facile synthesis of <b>layered</b> intercalation compounds and single <b>layer</b> nanosheets. This dissertation reports a novel approach to directly synthesize <b>layered</b> intercalation compounds and single <b>layer</b> nanosheets via a one-step process. Two model <b>layered</b> compounds: α-zirconium phosphate (α-ZrP) with negative <b>layer</b> charge and <b>layered</b> double hydroxide (LDH) with positive <b>layer</b> charge were selected for the one-step direct synthesis of <b>layered</b> intercalation compounds and single <b>layer</b> nanosheets, respectively. The introduction of a <b>layer</b> growth coordinator and inhibitor was proposed to guide or inhibit the growth of <b>layered</b> materials in the third dimension for the formation of <b>layered</b> intercalation compounds and single <b>layer</b> nanosheets, respectively. Our results have proved that the proposed one-step direct synthesis process to obtain <b>layered</b> intercalation compounds and single <b>layer</b> nanosheets is feasible. Detailed reaction mechanisms and the factors that influence the direct synthesis of <b>layered</b> intercalation compounds and single <b>layer</b> nanosheets were studied in detail. Based on the aforementioned fundamental investigation, another strategy involving both a complexing agent and a <b>layer</b> growth coordinator was further designed to promote the growth of <b>layered</b> compounds in the Z direction to form hexagonal prisms. Applications of the α-ZrP based intercalation compounds and LDH single <b>layer</b> nanosheets prepared through the developed methods were also studied. The Biginelli reactions catalyzed by the heterogeneous α-ZrP/BMIMCl intercalation compound were explored where the yield was maintained at 93 % even after 4 times of recycle. A dip coating method was adopted to align LDH single <b>layer</b> nanosheets on polymer film substrates to enhance their barrier properties, where both the oxygen and water vapor barrier properties were significantly improved...|$|R
