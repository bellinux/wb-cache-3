50|$|With the {{invention}} of the laser in the 1960s the company quickly established itself in the electro-optics arena. From the early 1970s it was delivering the Laser Rangefinder and Marked Target Seeker (LRMTS) for the Jaguar and Harrier fleets, and later for Tornado. It supplied the world's first man-portable laser rangefinder/designator (<b>Laser</b> <b>Target</b> <b>Marker,</b> or LTM) to the British Army in 1974, and had notable successes in the US market, establishing Ferranti Electro-optics Inc in Huntington Beach, California. Its TIALD Pod (Thermal Imaging Airborne Laser Designator) has been in almost constant combat operation on the Tornado since it was rushed into service during the first Gulf War.|$|E

The expanding plasma altered the electric field in the switch, resulting in switch closure. Aluminum, graphite and tungsten were chosen as <b>laser</b> <b>target</b> materials based on several criteria including the results of measuring the liberated charge as a function of laser energy in a vacuum. Triggering was performed on the Tiger pulsed power machine which pulse charged a LTGS containing a <b>laser</b> <b>target</b> to between 185 kV and 330 kV. The LTGS was triggered by directing a laser pulse from a Nd:YAG laser onto the <b>laser</b> <b>target.</b> Experiments varied <b>laser</b> energy, spot size on the <b>laser</b> <b>target</b> surface, <b>target</b> material and <b>laser</b> wavelength. The project successfully demonstrated reliable triggering with less than 1 mJ of laser energy with both 1064 and 266 nm wavelength laser pulses. Findings will be used in the design of switches for LTD-based pulsed power accelerators...|$|R

30|$|Lastly, we {{consider}} possible {{confirmation of the}} alignment between the transmitting and receiving telescopes in orbit. Hayabusa 2 drops five “target markers”, which are 10 -cm spheres covered with recursively reflective sheet, for touchdown onto the asteroid. The <b>target</b> <b>markers</b> {{can be used to}} estimate the common area of the transmitting and receiving fields of view. When a laser transmitted by LIDAR hits a <b>target</b> <b>marker,</b> the intensity of the return pulse will increase by a factor of 2 even from a 20  km altitude. The common area between the transmitting and receiving telescope fields of view can be constrained by detecting the enhancement of return pulses as a <b>target</b> <b>marker</b> moves into the field of view because of the rotation of the asteroid. It may also be possible to actively scan the spacecraft so that the laser can fire at <b>target</b> <b>markers.</b> The chances of such observations, however, are strongly dependent upon the direction of the rotation axis of the asteroid, {{as well as on the}} attitude control operation of the spacecraft. Because our a priori knowledge regarding those conditions is limited, quantitative discussion of these considerations is difficult before the spacecraft arrives at the asteroid.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Accurate {{measurement}} of soil deformation {{is fundamental to}} the success of geotechnical modelling. Current practice is to track the movement of a grid of <b>target</b> <b>markers</b> embedded in an exposed plane of soil through a sequence of video images. A new system of deformation measurement is presented which provides improved precision and reliability whilst removing the need for intrusive <b>target</b> <b>markers.</b> Image capture using an inexpensive 2 -megapixel digital camera provides a significant increase in resolution and image stability compared to video. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is a velocity-measuring technique in which patches of texture are tracked through an image sequence. Image processing algorithms have been written to apply the PIV principle to images of soil. The resulting software has a precision of 1 / 15 th of a pixel when tracking the movement of natural sand or textured clay. This system allows displacements to be measured to a precision greater than has been previously achieved, without recourse to <b>target</b> <b>markers.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|The latest {{techniques}} for the fabrication of high power <b>laser</b> <b>targets,</b> using processes {{developed for the}} manufacture of Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) devices are discussed. These <b>laser</b> <b>targets</b> are {{designed to meet the}} needs of the increased shot numbers that are available in the latest design of laser facilities. Traditionally <b>laser</b> <b>targets</b> have been fabricated using conventional machining or coarse etching processes and have been produced in quantities of 10 s to low 100 s. Such targets can be used for high complexity experiments such as Inertial Fusion Energy (IFE) studies and can have many complex components that need assembling and characterisation with high precision. Using the techniques that are common to MEMS devices and integrating these with an existing target fabrication capability we are able to manufacture and deliver targets to these systems. It also enables us to manufacture novel targets that have not been possible using other techniques. In addition, developments in the positioning systems that are required to deliver these <b>targets</b> to the <b>laser</b> focus are also required and a system to deliver the target to a focus of an F 2 beam at 0. 1 Hz is discussed...|$|R
