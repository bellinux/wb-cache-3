5000|$|Oleoresin {{may also}} be {{extracted}} from shredded pine stumps, roots, and slash using the <b>light</b> <b>end</b> of the heavy naphtha fraction (boiling between [...] ) from a crude oil refinery. Multi-stage counter-current extraction is commonly used so fresh naphtha first contacts wood leached in previous stages and naphtha laden with turpentine from previous stages contacts fresh wood before vacuum distillation to recover naphtha from the turpentine. Leached wood is steamed for additional naphtha recovery prior to burning for energy recovery.|$|E
50|$|A thermo{{hydrometer}} is a hydrometer {{that has}} a thermometer enclosed in the float section. For measuring the density of petroleum products, such as fuel oils, the specimen is usually heated in a temperature jacket with a thermometer placed behind it since density is dependent on temperature. Light oils are placed in cooling jackets, typically at 15 °C.Very light oils with many volatile components are measured in a variable volume container using a floating piston sampling device to minimize <b>light</b> <b>end</b> losses.|$|E
5000|$|Because the {{turpentine}} {{and pine}} oil from destructive distillation [...] "become somewhat contaminated with other distillation products", solvent processes are commonly used. In this process, stumps and roots are chipped and soaked in the <b>light</b> <b>end</b> {{of the heavy}} naphtha fraction (boiling between 90 °C and 115 °C) from a crude oil refinery. Multi-stage counter-current extraction is commonly used so fresh naphtha first contacts wood leached in intermediate stages and naphtha laden with rosin from intermediate stages contacts unleached wood before vacuum distillation to recover naphtha from the rosin, fatty acids, turpentine, and other constituents later separated through steam distillation. Leached wood is steamed for additional naphtha recovery prior to burning for energy recovery. After the solvent has been recovered, [...] "the terpene oils are separated by fractional distillation and recovered mainly as refined turpentine, dipentene, and pine oil. The nonvolatitle residue from the extract is wood rosin of rather dark color. Upgrading of the rosin is carried out by clarification methods that generally may include bed-filtering or furfural-treatment of rosin-solvent solution." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{basic concept}} is rather unconventional: {{the car is}} driven by a central [...] "power module", {{also known as a}} [...] "powerpack" [...] or a [...] "drive container", powered on both axles. Two <b>light</b> <b>end</b> modules, each with a bogie, rest on the power module, which {{produces}} useful traction weight on the driving axles. The end modules also use the space very effectively, although the railcar is divided into two halves by the power module. Most units have a path through the drive container for passenger access. The end modules can be delivered with standard pulling devices or buffer gears, or with central buffer couplings. They are built with a low-floor design except above the bogies and at the supported ends (more than 65% of the railcar is low-floor). All of the usual comforts to be expected in a modern local network railcar are provided, such as air conditioning, a multi-purpose room, vacuum toilets (in a washroom suitable for the disabled) and a passenger information system. The GTWs can be Diesel-electric or electric-powered (via overhead wires or third rail).|$|E
5000|$|In {{a review}} of the album Under My Skin, David Browne of Entertainment Weekly said [...] "Lavigne herself sounds more burdened; ... the sk8erboi of the first album {{has turned out to be}} a selfish, nasty creep who leaves when she won't go to bed with him" [...] in {{reference}} to Don't Tell Me. Blender Music wrote that unlike Sk8er Boi the up-with-abstinence single “Don’t Tell Me” finds her kicking him out of bed. The Guardian was mixed: [...] "Current single Don't Tell Me at least has some relevant advice to impart to her pubescent female fans: it depicts a confused and angry Lavigne fending off an over-eager boyfriend." [...] PopMatters was favorable: [...] "The first single, [...] "Don't Tell Me", is probably the best song on the album, with the kind of wonderfully effusive movement that makes the best pop so damn irresistible. It starts slow and quiet, building to the first chorus, ebbs back, builds to another chorus, drops down into a bridge before coming back with a skull-crunching third chorus that leaves the riff firmly implanted in your skull. One or two reprises and we're out like a <b>light,</b> <b>end</b> of song. At that point you're either convinced or not." [...] Rolling Stone was positive: [...] "The lead single, [...] "Don't Tell Me," [...] might be her most Avril-ish song yet, a petulant kiss-off to a horny boy. As the guitars get revved up behind her, she asks, [...] "Did I not tell you that I'm not like that girl/The one who gives it all away, yeah/Did you think that I was going to give it up to you?" [...] The syntax may be tortured, but the singer sounds just fine: a righteous prude, confidently fending off the creeps." [...] Yahoo Music! liked the song but was angry because there are spelling mistakes in booklet: [...] "we now have a stronger, more confident Avril - forthright in her determination not to lose her cherry on [...] "Don’t Tell Me", which coyly spells ‘ass’ with an ‘a’ and two asterixes on the CD booklet, bitterly writing songs about doomed relationships." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Examination {{of the digital}} image of Monterey Bay, California area indicates more resolution in all MSS bands than found in the film imagery. This inability to delineate subtle density variations may be similar to those difficulties encountered by some investigators at the <b>light</b> <b>end</b> of the spectrum. Because the digital image is large and only {{certain areas of the}} total image are enhanced at one time, the digital technique of presenting MSS imagery is complimentary with the supplied film imagery. Examination of selected film imagery of the Monterey Bay and Santa Barbara Channel areas raises more questions than can be answered at this time. Density variations over water areas could be of an oceanic or atmospheric origin, or both. The ground truth acquisition phase of this project will clear up some of the apparent ambiguities, but probably not completely. A more thorough examination of meteorological parameters is recommended...|$|E

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of steam reforming of the aqueous species in bio-oils produced from the fast pyrolysis of biomass is examined. A fractionating condenser system {{was used to}} collect a set of fractions of fast pyrolysis liquids with different chemical characteristics. The water-soluble components from the different fractions were steam-reformed using a nickel-based commercial catalyst in a fixed-bed reactor system. When reforming at 500 Â°C, an overall positive effect in hydrogen yields was observed for the fractions with higher concentrations of lower molecular-weight oxygenates, such as acetic acid and acetol, while the heavier compounds, such as the carbohydrates, showed an opposite effect. In general, higher selectivity toward hydrogen correlated to a lower tendency toward carbon deposits. Overall, the bio-oil fraction corresponding to the <b>light</b> <b>end</b> performed the best with the highest activity toward hydrogen. A range of steam/carbon ratios was examined. Carbon accumulation in the reactor was clearly a main issue during steam reforming {{of all of the}} bio-oil fractions studied. Chemical changes caused by aging of aqueous bio-oil were found to have a detrimental effect on hydrogen production...|$|E
30|$|The {{molecular}} {{composition and}} biomarker distribution of various occurrences {{of organic matter}} in argillaceous source rocks developed in fresh and saline lacustrine environments were revealed by successive treatments of solvent extraction followed by acid hydrolysis using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. The free fraction obtained by solvent extraction provided abundant geochemical information concerning the sedimentary environment, thermal maturity and biogenic origin, and obvious differences existed between fresh and saline lacustrine source rock samples. Our research {{results indicate that the}} carbonate-mineral-bound (CM-bound) fraction released by successive acid hydrolysis could also serve as a significant biogenic indicator, as the bicyclic sesquiterpenoids, indicative of Botryococcus braunii origin, were specifically detected in quite high abundance in the acid-soluble fraction. In addition, the <b>light</b> <b>end</b> hydrocarbons were much better preserved in the acid-soluble fraction, and elemental sulfur was only detected in the CM-bound fraction, suggesting a relatively confined environment for the CM-bound fraction, which thus could preserve additional geochemical information compared to that of the free fraction. The CM-bound fraction also exhibited discernable differences between fresh and saline lacustrine samples. Therefore, it can be concluded that comprehensive analysis of free and CM-bound fractions in the argillaceous source rocks can provide a more authentic and objective interpretation of geologic conditions.|$|E
