Thus, the main aim of this work was modeling the fuel consumption of forest road transportation by truck. We collected data about time, driving distance, average speed, fuel consumption and the load carried by the vehicle for loaded trips, unloaded trips, and the total cycle of forest transport in regions between the municipality of Campo do Tenente (forest site) and Piên (factory) located in Paraná state, Brazil. The Pearson’s correlation was used to determine the relationship between variables, while the Stepwise procedure was used to generate regression equations to estimate fuel consumption. The highest correlations were found between fuel consumption and driving distance, average speed and <b>liquid</b> <b>weight</b> of the load; also, there was a significant correlation between driving distance and average speed.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2013. Major: Kinesiology. Advisor: Thomas A. Stoffregen. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); iv, 41 pages. Perception of object length arising from manual wielding is powerfully {{influenced by the}} inertia tensor of wielded objects (e. g., Solomon & Turvey, 1988). In solid objects the inertia tensor is a fixed quantity which can be computed, and whose responses to torques are stable. By contrast, when I lift a glass to drink, I am wielding (in addition to the glass) a liquid, whose dynamics (including the inertia tensor) vary {{as a function of}} movement. In this study I asked whether judgments of object length during manual wielding would be influenced by the presence of liquid mass in the wielded object. In Experiment 1, the type of <b>weight</b> was manipulated (<b>liquid</b> and solid <b>weights).</b> In Experiment 2, I manipulated the type of weight and movement of liquid by orienting the cylindrical weight horizontally or vertically. In both experiments, judgments of length were strongly correlated with the weight position, and changing dynamics of <b>liquid</b> <b>weights</b> did not reduce the accuracy of length perception. On the basis of these results I argue that the inertia tensor is not likely single unique mechanical information to be detected for the haptic length perception...|$|R

Finally, the method of an assessment of the liquid sloshing impact on ship transverse stability is worked out.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to compare the conservation abilities between eighty hearing-impaired students and eighty hearing students ages 9 to 12 in Taiwan, the Republic of China. The hearing-impaired subjects were prelin-gually and profoundly deaf without any other significant handicaps. They had hearing parents.

A significant difference in conservation ability was found between hearing-impaired and hearing students at all age levels, in support of hearing students. Within the hearing-impaired group, there was no significant differ-ence in conservation ability between any two age levels. Therefore, for hearing-impaired students, age is not a function of conservation ability during the years of 9 to 12.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Although in {{the public}} {{literature}} there are several studies that describe models of alkaline delignification, they were originally developed for the paper industry, and {{do not include the}} effects of important operating variables such as temperature, hydroxide-ion concentration, solid to <b>liquid</b> <b>weight</b> ratio, particle size, biomass composition (hemicellulose, lignin fraction) and mixing. This lack of detailed models of the pretreatment stages prompted the current study that describes a model which includes the variables listed above and provides an important tool for predicting the degree of lignin removal in lignocellulosic materials such as sugarcane bagasse (Saccharum officinarum L). The model considers kinetic expressions available in the literature. The kinetic parameters were determined by fitting the model to experimental data obtained for that purpose in our lab. The experimental matrix considered eighteen, 24 -h isothermal experiments in which bulk and residual delignification stages were observed to occur in a parallel manner. Carbohydrate removal and hydroxide consumption were related to lignin removal by effective stoichiometric coefficients that were calculated by fitting the experimental data.

40|$|We {{study the}} buoyancy-driven {{spreading}} of a thin viscous film over a thin elastic membrane. Neglecting {{the effects of}} membrane bending and the membrane weight, we study the case of constant fluid injection and obtain a system of coupled partial differential equations to describe {{the shape of the}} air-liquid interface, and the deformation and radial tension of the stretched membrane. We obtain self-similar solutions to describe the dynamics. In particular, in the early-time period, the dynamics is dominated by buoyancy-driven spreading of the liquid film, and membrane stretching is a response to the buoyancy-controlled distribution of liquid weight; the location of the liquid front obeys the power-law form. However, in the late-time period, the system is quasi-steady, the air-liquid interface is flat, and membrane stretching, due to the <b>liquid</b> <b>weight,</b> causes the spreading of the liquid front; the location of the front obeys a different power-law form before the edge effects of the membrane become significant. In addition, we report laboratory experiments for constant fluid injection using different viscous liquids and thin elastic membranes. Very good agreement is obtained between the theoretical predictions and experimental observations...|$|R
40|$|The {{loading of}} foams with <b>liquid</b> <b>weight,</b> contributed {{primarily}} by the Plateau borders, results in an external force which may often be important to structure and drainage, especially in foams of a higher liquid content; loading induces deformations in structures. A Plateau border in a three-dimensional foam is supported by three films, which are assumed to sag under loading, initially with linear elasticity in these numerical simulations. The weight of a Plateau border is allowed to vary along its length, {{in accordance with the}} foam drainage equation for a single channel (balancing gravity and capillarity for a given channel size and orientation). The surface area of the deformed structure is subsequently minimized in the Surface Evolver, and it is found that only for sufficiently dry borders, the films have linear elasticity. For wet foams, the true distortion due to loading is larger than the linear model predicts; an iterative approach, based on the solution of the drainage equation and a direct application of gravitational forces in the Surface Evolver, is developed for wetter Plateau borders. The implications for forced-drainage experiments and continuum-level drainage models are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to provide insight into the {{mechanism}} by which bariatric surgical procedures led to weight loss and improvement or resolution of diabetes. Global biochemical profiling was used to evaluate changes occurring in nondiabetic and type 2 diabetic (T 2 D) patients experiencing either less extreme sleeve gastrectomy or a full gastric bypass. We were able to identify changes in metabolism that were affected by standard preoperation <b>liquid</b> <b>weight</b> loss diet as well as by bariatric surgery itself. Preoperation weight-loss diet was associated with a strong lipid metabolism signature largely related to the consumption of adipose reserves for energy production. Glucose usage shift away from glycolytic pyruvate production toward pentose phosphate pathway, via glucose- 6 -phosphate, appeared to be shared across all patients regardless of T 2 D status or bariatric surgery procedure. Our results suggested that bariatric surgery might promote antioxidant defense and insulin sensitivity through both increased heme synthesis and HO activity or expression. Changes in histidine and its metabolites following surgery might be an indication of altered gut microbiome ecology or liver function. This initial study provided broad understanding of how metabolism changed globally in morbidly obese nondiabetic and T 2 D patients following weight-loss surgery...|$|R

40|$|Liquid {{sloshing}} {{phenomenon is}} a result of partly filled tank motions. As a tank moves, it supplies energy to induce and sustain a fluid motion. Both the liquid motion and its effects are called sloshing. The interaction between ship’s tank structure and water sloshing inside the tank consists in the constant transmission of energy. As the ship rolls, the walls of a partly filled tank induce the movement of water. Liquid sloshing phenomenon occurring in partly filled ships tanks directly affects the stability of the vessel. However, only static calculations are carried out onboard ships nowadays and static transfer of <b>liquid</b> <b>weight</b> is taken into account in the course of routine stability calculation and assessment. Since previous researches reveal the necessity of dynamic approach towards liquid movement onboard ships, the investigation is focused on problems related to time dependent wave-type phenomena. This aspect is omitted in the course of standard ship stability calculations. The set of numerical simulations of liquid sloshing taking place in moving tanks is carried out. Among many obtained characteristics, the heeling moment due to sloshing is emphasized and thoroughly investigated. The realistic range of possible metacentric heights and rolling periods is examined. The influence of ship’s rolling period on the heeling moment due to liquid sloshing is analyzed for one exemplary seagoing vessel as a case study.
