5|$|One {{of these}} {{proposals}} was the Gemini Lunar Orbit Rescue Vehicle, {{which was designed}} to retrieve the crew of an Apollo spacecraft stranded in orbit around the Moon. It was to have used a stretched reentry module to accommodate the three astronauts who would have been aboard the Apollo. This would have been attached to a modified Equipment Module. The Equipment Module contained engines which would be used for Lunar orbit insertion and trans-Earth injection, as well as <b>life</b> <b>support</b> <b>equipment</b> to keep the crew alive until they returned to Earth. Launch and trans-Lunar injection would have been performed by a Saturn V. Once the spacecraft was in Lunar orbit, the Apollo crew would have boarded it by means of an EVA.|$|E
5|$|The {{ejection}} seat is {{a version of}} the ACES II (Advanced Concept Ejection Seat) commonly used in USAF aircraft, with a center-mounted ejection control. The F-22 has a complex life support system, which includes the on-board oxygen generation system (OBOGS), protective pilot garments, and a breathing regulator/anti-g (BRAG) valve controlling flow and pressure to the pilot's mask and garments. The pilot garments were developed under the Advanced Technology Anti-G Suit (ATAGS) project and are to protect against chemical/biological hazards and cold-water immersion, counter g-forces and low pressure at high altitudes, and provide thermal relief. Suspicions regarding the performance of the OBOGS and <b>life</b> <b>support</b> <b>equipment</b> have been raised by several mishaps, including a fatal crash.|$|E

30|$|Transfer {{requests}} are {{initiated by}} the referring hospitals or by the patients’ families. A medical report is sent from the referring hospital detailing the medical condition and justification for the transfer. The report is then reviewed by an administrative committee to determine the eligibility of the patient for hospital admission. The concerned services and the ICU team assess eligible patients using the data in the medical report and by phone conversation with the referring physician if required, for potential benefit from the transfer and the stability for the transfer. Once the patient is accepted, the transfer process is initiated. Patients are transferred only if the clinical condition is deemed stable enough as judged by the respiratory, cardiovascular, and other clinical parameters. Transfers occur by fixed-wing airplanes, helicopters, or by ground ambulances depending on {{the distance from the}} referring hospitals. The transportation team normally consists of an intensivist or anaesthetist physician and a critical care nurse. The ambulance, helicopter, and fixed-wing airplane are equipped with <b>life</b> <b>support</b> <b>equipments.</b>|$|R
25|$|Safe solo divers must be self-sufficient, well trained, {{prepared}} and practised. They {{should have a}} completely redundant set of all <b>life</b> <b>support</b> <b>equipment</b> (e.g. a complete, self-contained backup breathing gas supply). In addition, the responsible solo divers adhere to a very conservative dive profile, both in depth and level of difficulty. Unlike the buddy system, which encourages divers to rely on others {{in the event of}} an emergency, solo diving encourages divers to prepare themselves to overcome emergencies by their own means. The divers who engage in solo diving are typically those who are experienced and equipped enough to handle problems themselves. Solo divers must feel totally comfortable and relaxed in doing this sort of diving, and nobody should ever think of doing diving solo if they are not both competent and comfortable in doing so.|$|E
25|$|The {{open circuit}} scuba set is usually stored and often transported as {{separate}} major components - harness, cylinder(s) and regulator(s), and usually buoyancy compensator, and assembled shortly before use. The scuba set is <b>life</b> <b>support</b> <b>equipment</b> and correct assembly and function {{is critical to}} the success of the dive, and in some cases to the survival of the user. The equipment is robust and reliable, is easily tested for correct function, and assembly is simple enough for the user after basic instruction and some practice. Some service providers will assemble scuba sets for their clients, particularly if it is rental equipment, but all certification agencies require the diver to be competent to assemble their own set. Scuba assembly generally entails mounting the cylinder(s) on the harness, connecting the regulator(s) to the cylinder valves, ensuring an uncontaminated and pressure-tight seal, and connecting the low pressure hose to the buoyancy compensator inflation valve. These operations usually require no tools, or at most a wrench, used to bolt twin cylinders to a backplate. Validating the function of the regulator and inflation valve is usually considered part of scuba assembly, but may also be considered part of pre-dive checks, and if there is a significant interval between assembly and use, is commonly done twice.|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally, {{both the}} legal and medical {{communities}} determined death through the permanent end of certain bodily functions in clinical death, especially respiration and heartbeat. [...] With the increasing ability of the medical community to resuscitate people with no respiration, heartbeat, or other external signs of life, the need for another definition of death occurred, raising questions of legal death. This gained greater urgency with {{the widespread use of}} <b>life</b> <b>support</b> <b>equipment,</b> as well as rising capabilities and demand for organ transplantation.|$|E

2500|$|Brain {{death is}} used as an {{indicator}} of legal death in many jurisdictions, but it is defined inconsistently. Various parts of the brain may keep functioning when others do not anymore, and the term [...] "brain death" [...] has been used to refer to various combinations. For example, although a major medical dictionary says that [...] "brain death" [...] is synonymous with [...] "cerebral death" [...] (death of the cerebrum), the US National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) system defines brain death as including the brainstem. The distinctions can be important because, for example, in someone with a dead cerebrum but a living brainstem, the heartbeat and ventilation can continue unaided, whereas in whole-brain death (which includes brain stem death), only <b>life</b> <b>support</b> <b>equipment</b> would keep those functions going. Patients classified as brain-dead can have their organs surgically removed for organ donation.|$|E
2500|$|An ad hoc {{committee}} at Harvard Medical School {{published a}} pivotal 1968 report to define irreversible coma. The Harvard criteria gradually gained consensus toward what {{is now known as}} brain death. In the wake of the 1976 Karen Ann Quinlan case, state legislatures in the United States moved to accept brain death as an acceptable indication of death. In 1981 a Presidential commission issued a landmark report – Defining Death: Medical, Legal, and Ethical Issues in the Determination of Death [...] – that rejected the [...] "higher brain" [...] approach to death in favor of a [...] "whole brain" [...] definition. This report was the basis for the Uniform Determination of Death Act, which has been enacted in 39 states of the United States. The Uniform Determination of Death Act in the United States attempts to standardize criteria. Today, both the legal and medical communities in the US use [...] "brain death" [...] as a legal definition of death, allowing a person to be declared legally dead even if <b>life</b> <b>support</b> <b>equipment</b> keeps the body's metabolic processes working.|$|E
2500|$|The {{buddy system}} is {{expected}} to provide a level of redundancy within the pair of divers, as a safety backup in case of any equipment failure. Within the overall buddy pair almost all equipment {{can be seen as}} part of a combined [...] "redundant system": two tanks, two depth gauges/ dive computers, two lights, two knives or line-cutters, – even two brains. During the dive the measurement instruments (gauges, dive computers, compass etc.) are available to cross check one another, a second set of <b>life</b> <b>support</b> <b>equipment</b> (i.e. gas supply) is there as a backup in case of a failure in one of the divers' systems. [...] Sometimes a single special-purpose but non-critical piece of equipment is shared by the buddy team, like a single deployable surface marker buoy on which to ascend and mark the team’s position or a single underwater metal detector. [...] The one key thing however, that a buddy team always shares together is a dive plan - and the responsibilities of executing it. [...] A key principle drummed into scuba divers is “plan the dive and dive the plan”. [...] Before a dive a buddy team agree on a plan, which aside from the basic parameters of the dive itself – e.g. [...] depth, course, time, who leads and who follows, - [...] also includes the objectives of the dive: is it general sightseeing, is it the way the divers intend to view a wreck, is it photography, is it hunting a type of game. In technical diving these objectives often become much more complex and very specific – penetration of a particular part of a cave to a particular point. Many diving objectives require allocation of specific roles and responsibilities. [...] For example, in lobster hunting on the west coast of America, buddy teams often split into the assigned roles of hunter and game-catcher, and stower and catchbag-carrier, and the overall dive success is highly dependent on the teamwork of the buddies carrying out their assigned roles.|$|E

40|$|Self {{contained}} {{closed circuit}} rebreathers are <b>life</b> <b>supporting</b> breathing systems, where the exhaled gas is recycled by filtering CO 2 and replacing metabolized O- 2. For the O- 2 injection control galvanic O- 2 sensors are {{used to measure the}} partial pressure of O- 2. A malfunction of the sensors can lead to a gas mixture beyond <b>life</b> <b>supporting</b> limits which is life threatening. Galvanic O- 2 sensors are often used in anaesthetic machines in hospitals. Also in this case, a malfunction of the sensors can cause severe injury to a person. It is obvious that such sensors are key elements in <b>life</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>equipment</b> and as such must be designed in order to achieve high functional safety. However these sensors are consuming sensors, and with that, will fail at a certain time. Failure modes include current limitation, non linearity, electrolyte evaporation or leakage, etc. Within this paper a novel low cost read out electronic circuit for galvanic O- 2 sensors is presented, which allows not only digital readout, digital temperature compensation, on board storage of calibration and manufacturing data, but also can be used for performing voltammetry cycles to test the Pb anode for exhaustion. First measurements are presented and compared to data from a Solartron SI 1287 impedance analyzer, which is state-of-the-art in electrochemical sensor characterization...|$|R
2500|$|In Hong Kong, all air {{ambulance}} service {{is provided by}} the Government Flying Service; a joint service providing aviation support to all departments of the government.
