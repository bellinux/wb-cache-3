5|$|The {{transformation}} of Hungary into a Christian state {{was one of}} Stephen's principal concerns throughout his reign. Although the Hungarians' conversion had already begun in his father's reign, it was only Stephen who systematically forced his subjects {{to give up their}} pagan rituals. His <b>legislative</b> <b>activity</b> was closely connected with Christianity. For example, his First Book of Laws from the first years of his reign includes several provisions prescribing the observance of feast days and the confession before death. His other laws protected property rights and the interests of widows and orphans, or regulated the status of serfs.|$|E

25|$|Sixth, {{critics have}} argued that the Beck Court misapplied its duty of fair {{representation}} doctrine. One legal commentator has concluded that the Supreme Court's duty of fair representation decisions do not lead to the conclusion that agency fees can be restricted solely to collective bargaining purposes. Another has argued that the modern labor unions can only meet their duty to fairly represent workers if they engage in lobbying and <b>legislative</b> <b>activity,</b> a conclusion which undercuts the Beck court's decision as well.|$|E
25|$|The Lex Frisionum of the duchy of Frisia {{consists}} of a medley of documents of the most heterogeneous character. Some of its enactments are purely pagan, thus one paragraph allows the mother to kill her new-born child, and another prescribes the immolation to the gods of the defiler of their temple; others are purely Christian, {{such as those that}} prohibit incestuous marriages and working on Sunday. The law abounds in contradictions and repetitions, and the compositions are calculated in different moneys. From this it appears the documents were merely materials collected from various sources and possibly with a view to the compilation of a homogeneous law. These materials were apparently brought together {{at the beginning of the}} 9th century, at a time of intense <b>legislative</b> <b>activity</b> at the court of Charlemagne.|$|E

25|$|Much of the <b>legislative</b> <b>activity</b> has {{stemmed from}} Purdue Pharma’s {{decision}} in 2011 {{to begin a}} modification of Oxycontin’s composition {{to make it more}} difficult to crush for snorting or injecting. The new formulation, OxyNeo, is intended to be preventative in this regard and retain its effectiveness as a painkiller. Since introducing its Narcotics Safety and Awareness Act, Ontario has committed to focusing on drug addiction, particularly in the monitoring and identification of problem opioid prescriptions, as well as the education of patients, doctors, and pharmacists. This Act, introduced in 2010, commits to the establishment of a unified database to fulfil this intention. Both the public and medical community have received the legislation positively, though concerns about the ramifications of legal changes have been expressed. Because laws are largely provincially regulated, many speculate a national strategy is needed to prevent smuggling across provincial borders from jurisdictions with looser restrictions.|$|E
500|$|The {{middle years}} of Edward's reign were {{a period of}} {{significant}} <b>legislative</b> <b>activity.</b> Perhaps the best-known piece of legislation was the Statute of Labourers of 1351, which addressed the labour shortage problem caused by the Black Death. The statute fixed wages at their pre-plague level and checked peasant mobility by asserting that lords had first claim on their men's services. In spite of concerted efforts to uphold the statute, it eventually failed due to competition among landowners for labour. The law {{has been described as}} an attempt [...] "to legislate against the law of supply and demand", which made it doomed to fail. Nevertheless, the labour shortage had created a community of interest between the smaller landowners of the House of Commons and the greater landowners of the House of Lords. The resulting measures angered the peasants, leading to the Peasants' Revolt of 1381.|$|E
500|$|Historians differ widely {{regarding}} Æthelstan's legislation.

[...] In his view, [...] "The <b>legislative</b> <b>activity</b> of Æthelstan's reign has rightly been dubbed 'feverish'...But the extant results are, frankly, a mess." [...] In {{the view of}} Simon Keynes, however, [...] "Without any doubt the most impressive aspect of King Æthelstan's government is the vitality of his law-making", which shows him driving his officials to do their duties and insisting on respect for the law, but also demonstrates the difficulty he had in controlling a troublesome people. Keynes sees the Grately code as [...] "an impressive piece of legislation" [...] showing the king's determination to maintain social order. David Pratt describes his legislation as [...] "a deep and far-reaching reform of legal structures, no less important than developments under King Alfred two generations earlier".|$|E

500|$|It {{is unclear}} {{if there were}} laws dealing with epikleroi prior to Solon's <b>legislative</b> <b>activity</b> around 594 BCE. According to the 1st century CE writer Plutarch, Solon {{authored}} legislation covering the epikleros. Solon's laws attempted to prevent the combination of estates by the marriage of heiresses. Modern historians have seen this {{as part of an}} effort by Solon to maintain a stable number of households. According to Plutarch, Solon also legislated that the husband of an epikleros must have sexual intercourse with her at least three times a month in order to provide her with children to inherit her father's property, but by the time of Pericles (d. 429 BCE) this law is definitely attested. It is unclear whether or not the nearest relative had the power to dissolve an epikleros' [...] previous marriage in order to marry her himself in all cases. The historian Sarah Pomeroy states that most scholars lean towards the opinion that the nearest relative could only dissolve the previous marriage if the heiress had not yet given birth to a son, but Pomeroy also states that this opinion has not yet been definitely proven. Roger Just disagrees and has argued that even if the epikleros had a son she could still be forced to marry her nearest relative. Athenian law also required that if the next of kin did not marry the heiress, he had to provide her with a dowry. It may have been Solon who legislated that if the new spouse was unable to fulfill his thrice monthly duties to his wife, she was entitled to have sex with his next of kin so that she could produce an heir to her father's property. Alternatively, she might have been required to divorce and marry the next nearest relative.|$|E

2500|$|After {{a series}} of filibusters in the 1960s over civil rights legislation, the Senate put a [...] "two-track system" [...] into place in 1970 under the {{leadership}} of Majority Leader Mike Mansfield and Majority Whip Robert Byrd. Before this system was introduced, a filibuster would stop the Senate from moving on to any other <b>legislative</b> <b>activity.</b> Tracking allows the majority leader—with unanimous consent or the agreement of the minority leader—to have more than one bill pending on the floor as unfinished business. Under the two-track system, the Senate can have two or more pieces of legislation pending on the floor simultaneously by designating specific periods during the day when each one will be considered.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, McCaskill reintroduced her {{legislation}} in the Senate (S. 760) to have the Liberty Memorial designated the National World War I Memorial. Bond reintroduced his {{legislation in}} the Senate (S. 761) to establish a centennial commission. Both bills died in committee. [...] Companion {{legislation in the}} House (H.R. 1849), introduced once more by Cleaver, combined the two bills. The Cleaver bill passed the House, but was never {{taken up by the}} Senate. Separately, Senator John Thune (R-South Dakota) introduced legislation in the Senate (S. 2097) to allow Fountain's World War I Memorial Foundation to take over the D.C. War Memorial and re-establish it as the National World War I Memorial. Efforts to rename the D.C. War Memorial gain support when the D.C. Council voted in 2009 to support the Thune bill. Hearings were held on Thune's bill, at which Frank Buckles (now 108 years old) testified. Representatives from the National Park Service also testified in favor of the bill, noting that there was no longer any room on the National Mall for a major memorial. But it, too, died in committee. Poe introduced companion legislation in the House (H.R. 482), but it also died in committee, ending <b>legislative</b> <b>activity</b> for the 111th Congress.|$|E
2500|$|The table {{shows that}} the richest two {{property}} classes combined, the equites (knights, including the six centuriae probably reserved for patricians), together with the 1st property class, were allocated an absolute majority of the votes (98 of 193 centuriae), despite being {{a small minority of}} the population. Their precise proportion is unknown, but was most likely under 5% of the citizen-body. These classes supplied a legion's cavalry, just 6.6% of the unit's total effectives (300 of 4,500), which is probably greater than their proportionate share, as the lowest class was excluded from legionary service. Overall, votes were allocated in inverse proportion to population. Thus the lowest social echelon (the proletarii, under 400 drachmae), was allocated just 1 of the 193 centuriae, despite being probably the largest. As Livy himself puts it: [...] "Thus every citizen was given the illusion of wielding power through the right to vote, but in reality the aristocracy remained in full control. For the centuriae of knights were summoned first to vote, and then the centuriae of the First Property Class. In the rare event of a majority not being attained, the Second Class was called, but it was hardly ever necessary to consult the lowest classes." [...] Also in its legislative capacity, the popular assembly offered little scope for democratic action. For this purpose, the comitia could only meet when summoned by a Magistrate. Participants could only vote (by centuria) for or against propositions (rogationes) put before them by the convening Magistrate. No amendments or motions from the floor were admissible. In modern terms, the <b>legislative</b> <b>activity</b> of the comitia amounted to no more than a series of referenda, and in no sense resembled the role of a parliament.|$|E
