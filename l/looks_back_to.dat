5|$|Despite early {{interest}} in the theatre, Joyce published only one play, Exiles, begun shortly after {{the outbreak of the}} First World War in 1914 and published in 1918. A study of a husband and wife relationship, the play <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> The Dead (the final story in Dubliners) and forward to Ulysses, which Joyce began {{around the time of the}} play's composition.|$|E
5|$|The {{park was}} the {{backdrop}} for the classic historical film Anne of the Thousand Days (1969), with Richard Burton and Geneviève Bujold, which <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> what is now Richmond in the 16th century. The film {{tells the story of}} King Henry VIII's courtship of Anne Boleyn and their brief marriage.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{working up}} the text for {{publication}} in the seventies, Rough for Theatre II clearly <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Waiting for Godot and Endgame rather than forward to the later plays. Had Beckett actually written the play later it would have borne a greater resemblance to That Time, Eh Joe or Ghost Trio, Morvan and Bertrand’s characters being reduced to disembodied voices.|$|E

25|$|In his {{characteristic}} fashion, Hazlitt <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{an earlier}} subject of these essays and compares Mackintosh with Coleridge. While the latter's genius often strays from reality, his imagination creates something new. Mackintosh, {{on the other}} hand, with a similarly impressive command of his subject matter, mechanically presents the thinking of others. There is no integration of his learning with his own thinking, no passion, nothing fused {{in the heat of}} imagination.|$|E
25|$|In philosophy, Leibniz is most {{noted for}} his optimism, i.e. his {{conclusion}} that our Universe is, in a restricted sense, {{the best possible}} one that God could have created, an idea that was often lampooned by others such as Voltaire. Leibniz, along with René Descartes and Baruch Spinoza, {{was one of the}} three great 17th-century advocates of rationalism. The work of Leibniz anticipated modern logic and analytic philosophy, but his philosophy also <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the scholastic tradition, in which conclusions are produced by applying reason to first principles or prior definitions rather than to empirical evidence.|$|E
25|$|Roots rock is {{rock music}} that <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> rock's origins in folk, blues and country music. It is {{particularly}} {{associated with the}} creation of hybrid subgenres from the later 1960s including country rock and Southern rock, which have been seen as responses to the perceived excesses of dominant psychedelic and developing progressive rock. Because roots music (Americana) is often used to mean folk and world musical forms, roots rock is sometimes used in a broad sense to describe any rock music that incorporates elements of this music. In the 1980s, roots rock enjoyed a revival in response to trends in punk rock, new wave and heavy metal music.|$|E

25|$|To {{accommodate}} {{the needs of}} the congregation, Wright divided the community space from the temple space through a low, middle loggia that could be approached from either side. This was an efficient use of space and kept down on noise between the two main gathering areas: those coming for religious services would be separated via the loggia from those coming for community events. The plan of the design <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the bipartite design of his own studio built several blocks away in 1898: with two portions of the building similar in composition and separated by a lower passageway, and one section being larger than the other. The Guggenheim Museum in New York City is another bipartite design. Also for the Temple's architecture, Wright borrowed several attributes from his previous creation, the Larkin Administration Building. Key features derived were use of stained glass windows as well as geometric figure. But, unlike the Larkin Building, the Temple's plan produced a perfect square, as opposed to the double-square rectangle of the Larkin.|$|E
25|$|His term as rector was brief, though, for on June 9, 1982, he was {{appointed}} coadjutor bishop to the then controversial and prophetic Bishop Francisco Claver, of Diocese of Malaybalay, Bukidnon. In this moment of difficulty, Rosales recalled that a stampita (holy picture) dropped from his breviary (liturgy of the hours). It was from Mother (now Blessed) Teresa of Calcutta. When he picked it up, he saw the writing at the back. It read: “Allow God to use you without first consulting you.” These words brought peace to his soul. On September 14, 1984, Rosales succeeded the Bishop of Malaybalay taking complete authority over the diocese. He started his ministry in Malaybalay by forming with his people, especially the priest and religious there, {{a vision of the}} diocese: that of the total development of every person and all persons, brought about by Jesus Christ. In that difficult assignment, he was able to bring about the unity of the clergy as they struggled especially for justice, peace and environmental protection. He often <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> his days there as the golden moments of his ministry.|$|E

500|$|Furthermore, in 2013 Michael Cragg of The Guardian {{pointed out}} that [...] "two decades after its release, the Icelandic artist's first album has never sounded more relevant." [...] He argued that Debut [...] "reconstructed pop music", also writing that [...] "while pop in 2013 <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the early 90s for inspiration, Björk's ability on Debut to {{innovate}} by using disparate genres without losing a sense of her own identity should be the blueprint for any new artist with desires to break the mould." [...] In the album's entry in their list of [...] "The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time" [...] —where the album was included at number 46—, NME claimed that [...] "Debut achieved the remarkable feat of turning an idiosyncratic vocalist from a feted cult band into a significant global pop star, without losing one iota of the experimental mindset and creative cool that made her so special." [...] In 2005, Björk stated that she thought the album wasn't as strong as her later efforts: [...] "It's hard to judge yourself but I don't think [...] my best. Debut was the album that went the highest up there {{in terms of what}} is 'Bjork music'. But I think that the persona I created, which was entirely accidental, is better captured on the later albums".|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Spears {{telling a story}} about a very famous Hollywood actress named Lucky. Lucky is seen wearing a pink nightgown behind the curtains, {{standing}} on her billboard with fluffy white cotton balls attached to the edges, inside her mansion and shots of her out on the balcony. As beautiful and rich as she is, on set she sits on the star-shape in the sky, as she is acting, she is looking quite distressed. After the first chorus, she goes to the hotel mansion to the flowers, then she leaves and sits down and gets a mirror. Next, Lucky opens the door to reveal a handsome man, who then takes her in his arms, as the director yells [...] "Cut! We've got it". Lucky then walks off-set into the studio, replying to the director: [...] "Finally! We've done it fifty-million times!" [...] She then goes to have her hair and makeup done; with Spears standing unnoticed and very worried looking by her side. Lucky is then seen in a shiny gray evening gown at the Academy Awards accepting her award for Best Actress. Lucky looks happy as she accepts it and smiles at her fans but is soon revealed that this is not true happiness. She makes her way away from her screaming fans and back into her limo, where she unexpectedly finds an ornate hand mirror that was used on the film set. She <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the crowd to see who has left it and sees Spears leaning forward in the crowd. The limo drives away, leaving Spears behind on the red carpet. The video ends with Lucky crying herself to sleep, her make-up already stained on her face. The curtains close, ending the video.|$|E

2500|$|In Cántico, {{there were}} many poems about {{awakening}} and how wonderful it is to return into consciousness. [...] In Clamor, dawn brings a desire to sink back into sleep and find oblivion.

[...] In the earlier poem, death was somewhere in the future and life was to be enjoyed. [...] In the later poem, the poet <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> his past where the good memories are. [...] He then clings to the present but cannot avoid the sense of a future that is shrinking every day.|$|E
2500|$|The early titles {{produced}} at Ōkura Eiga {{indicate that the}} films from Ōkura's new studio continued the themes pioneered at Shintōhō.

Kobayashi also directed ghost stories {{in the style of}} the films of Shintōhō's Nobuo Nakagawa, with titles like [...] (1962), [...] (1963), and [...] (1964). Kobayashi continued to occasionally make films in this style for Ōkura as late as 1995 with [...] starring actresses Nao Saejima and Yumi Yoshiyuki, who would become a prominent pink film director herself, releasing mainly through Ōkura.|$|E
