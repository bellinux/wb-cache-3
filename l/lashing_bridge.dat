Raising the accommodation block and wheelhouse {{and increasing the}} height of <b>lashing</b> <b>bridges</b> to take an extra tier of containers {{is part of the}} strategy to double the lifetime of the 10-year-old ships, and could be viewed as a statement from Maersk on maximum vessel size intent. Remedial work was needed on the Odense-built ships after the Emma Maersk was fortunate not to sink at the northern entrance to the Suez Canal in early 2013 after the hull was fractured by a failed stern thruster. After the incident, Maersk prohibited the use of stern thrusters on its Emma-class ships until modifications could be made to the fleet. The upgrading, which also includes fitting a new bulbous bow to cope with slower speeds and a new propeller, is being carried out at Chinaâ€™s CSIC Qingdao Beihai Shipyard, which has undertaken the majority of previous Maersk Line ship upgrades. It is understood that the first E-class vessel converted was the Eugen Maersk, which has now rejoined the 2M AE1/Shogun Asia-North Europe loop.|$|R

The two gunboats were transported to Tonkin <b>lashed</b> to the <b>bridge</b> of the troopship Bien Hoa, and re-floating them on their arrival at Haiphong was a {{technical}} task of considerable complexity.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{possible causes}} of {{failure of the}} rotating footbridge over the Ustka port channel. In July, 2015, strange behaviour of this object was observed {{in the form of}} excessive vibrations of bridge platform suspension rods, with the accompanying acoustic effects. A preliminary geotechnical analysis has revealed that this destructive effect was caused by the nearby construction works, namely construction of a fishing basin and communication routes in the area close to the bridge, which affected the <b>bridge</b> <b>lashing</b> rod foundation settings. Ground vibrations generated by certain construction activities were likely to have direct impact on decreasing the bearing capacity of these rods and increasing the susceptibility od the piles to extraction. After detecting the above problems in bridge operation, its geodetic monitoring was started. The data recorded during this monitoring, along with the results of force measurements in the rods, have made the basis for a series of numerical simulations, performed in the Finite Element Method (FEM) formalism. The bridge structure was analysed in the conditions defined as the emergency state. Extreme efforts of bridge elements and its dynamic characteristics were examined. A possible source of strange behaviour of the footbridge during its operation which was recognised during these simulations was the coincidence of the global natural frequency of the entire bridge structure with local vibrations of suspension rods, at the frequency approximately equal to 1 Hz. This situation was likely to lead to the appearance of the so-called internal resonance phenomenon. As a final conclusion of the research, recommendations were formulated on possible object oriented corrective actions...|$|R
