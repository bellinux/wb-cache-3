2500|$|The Der Dessauer was a {{monoplane}} {{with a thick}} section, two-part, high wing, {{connected to}} the fuselage by a single, short, steep, tubular Dural lift strut from the upper fuselage longeron to the single wing spar on each side at about 15% of the span. [...] These struts were unusual in incorporating rubber shock absorbers which allowed a compression of [...] at landings, when the downward inertial forces were greatest. [...] They were rigid under <b>lifting</b> <b>loads.</b> Forward of the spar the wing was plywood skinned around the leading edge, forming a torsion resistant D-box, and behind it the wing was fabric-covered with wire defining the trailing edge. A rectangular plan centre section filled about half the span; outboard, the leading edge was slightly swept, leading to straight, oblique wing tips. [...] The trailing edges of these outer panels carried obliquely mounted differential ailerons which broadened to the tips.|$|E
2500|$|The Type D was {{the third}} and last of Handley Page's early single-seat monoplanes (the Type B being a biplane). [...] It was a close {{relative}} of the Type A, which crashed on its first turn, and the [...] Type C which did not fly at all. [...] Like them the Type D used the wing patented by José Weiss that promised, but failed to deliver, automatic lateral stability. [...] Its structure {{was based on a}} rigid inner section, built with four spars and standard ribs with a flexible outer section carried on ribs attached fanwise {{from the end of the}} spars in a bird-like fashion. The wing was braced by wires from a tall, narrow inverted V kingpost, <b>lifting</b> <b>loads</b> being carried by symmetrical bracing to a matching V post under the fuselage. [...] This latter structure also carried the two-wheel single axle undercarriage and a long central skid to prevent nosing over and to hold the tail clear of the ground. After the Type A crash, Handley Page had added wing warping for lateral control to the Type C. [...] The Type D also used this system, with a steering wheel pulling on wires to the mid-wing via the kingpost. [...] The horizontal tail was an approximately 60° delta with rounded tips; most of the surface moved to form the single-piece elevator and carried the rudder post and split (above and below the elevator) rudder, so that all the control surfaces moved together as a cruciform piece. The elevator was operated by pushing or pulling the lever-mounted steering wheel and the rudder by a [...] "foot tiller". There was no fixed fin.|$|E

50|$|An Auxiliary Lifting Attachment (ALA) - a davit with a {{winch rope}} roller - fitted {{to the inside}} of the {{earthmoving}} bucket was used for <b>lifting</b> <b>loads</b> of up to 4tonnes. Loads such as Medium Girder Bridge pallets could be lifted vertically to a height of 1.8m. This then allowed a cargo vehicle to back under the suspended load, the CET could not travel or turn with a suspended load on the ALA due to lateral weakness of the ALA and the proximity of the load to the earthmoving bucket. Use of the ALA was discontinued in the 1990s due to difficulties in annual testing of the safe working load, and a reduced requirement for its use.|$|E

50|$|The Manuel Primary was {{a wooden}} {{aircraft}} built around an open, vertical, tapered girder with a horizontal upper member {{and a lower}} one shaped at the front into a shallow keel. The girder was strengthened {{with a series of}} vertical and diagonal cross-pieces. The keel projected forward of the foremost vertical member and carried the pilot's seat on its upper edge. The thick-profile wing was attached to {{the upper part of the}} girder and was straight edged with constant chord apart from the angled tips of the ailerons. Extensions of two of the forward girder cross-pieces formed a triangular structure over the wing which acted as a king post for a pair of landing wires. Flying wires from the keel and the upper member about half way to the rear of the girder carried the <b>lifting</b> <b>loads</b> on the wing. There were also bracing wires from wing to the rear of the aircraft to restrain horizontal bending of the girder. The rectangular tailplane was likewise fixed to the top of the girder and carried elevators with a cut-out in which the all-moving rectangular rudder, which extended to the lower girder, could operate.|$|E

5000|$|The {{specifications}} {{drawn up}} in 1924 by the Committee for the Safety of Airships had based weight estimates on the then existing rules for airframe strengths. However, the Air Ministry Inspectorate {{introduced a new}} set of rules for airship safety standards in late 1924 and compliance with these as-yet unformulated rules had been explicitly mentioned in the individual specifications for each airship. [...] These new rules called for all <b>lifting</b> <b>loads</b> to be transmitted directly to the transverse frames rather than being taken via the longitudinal girders. The intention behind this ruling was to enable the stressing of the framework to be fully calculated, rather than relying on empirically accumulated data, as was contemporary practice at the Zeppelin design office. Apart from the implications for the airframe weight, one effect of these regulations was to force both teams to contrive a new system of harnessing the gasbags. R101's patented [...] "parachute" [...] gasbag harnessing, designed by Michael Rope, proved less than satisfactory, permitting the gas bags to surge unduly, particularly in rough weather. [...] This caused the gasbags to chafe against the structure, causing holes in the fabric. Another effect was that both R100 and R101 had {{a relatively small number of}} longitudinal girders in order to simplify the stressing calculations.|$|E

50|$|How {{a system}} {{extracts}} {{energy from the}} wind and transfers energy to useful purposes helps to define types of crosswind kite power systems. One typing parameter regards {{the position of the}} generator or pump or tasking line or device. Another typing parameter regards how the tethers of the tether set of the kite system are utilized; the tethers holding the kiting wing elements aloft may be used in various ways to form types; tethers may simply hold working wings aloft, or they may be pulling loads on the ground, or multitasking by sending aloft-gained electricity to ground receivers or by pulling loads or by being the tasking device itself as when used for pulling people or things or cutting or grinding things. Some types are distinguished by fast motion transfer or slow motion transfer. Typing of crosswind kite power system also occurs {{by the nature of the}} wing set where count of wings and types of wings matter to designers and users; a wing set might be in a train arrangement, stack configuration, arch complex, dome mesh, coordinating family of wings, or just be a simple single-wing with single tether. Types of crosswind kite power devices are also distinguished by scale, purpose, intended life, and cost level. Typing by economic success occurs; is the system effective in the energy or task market or not? Some CWKPS are a type called lifters; they are purposed just for <b>lifting</b> <b>loads,</b> perhaps humans; the type is frequented by the use of autorotating blades that appear then to look like helicopters. A single crosswind kite power system (CWKPS) may be a hybrid complex performing aloft energy generation while also performing ground-based work through tether pulling of loads. The crosswind kite power systems that involve fluttering elements are being explored in several research centers; flutter is mined for energy conversion in a few ways. Researchers are showing types of CWKPS that are difficult to classify or type.|$|E
50|$|Racing engines {{often fail}} at high {{rotational}} speeds because mechanical springs {{are unable to}} retract the valves quickly enough to provide clearance for the piston. Renault's pneumatic valve technology replaced steel springs with light weight compressed air bellows. These could retract valves more quickly and reduce the possibility of piston-valve interference, as long as pressure could be maintained. Additionally, the amount of seat tension required to keep a coil sprung valve under control results in greater peak <b>lift</b> <b>loading,</b> with added stress to the entire valvetrain as a result. Pneumatic systems, sharing a common reservoir of pressure retain a more static level of force, controlling the valve effectively, without any attendant peak <b>lift</b> <b>load</b> increase.|$|R

40|$|Background and Purpose. Manual lifting is a {{frequent}} cause of back injury, {{and there is no}} evidence as to which training mode can provide the best training effect for lifting performance and muscle force. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the effects of a squat lift training and a free weight muscle training program on the maximum <b>lifting</b> <b>load</b> and isokinetic peak torque in subjects without known neuromuscular or musculoskeletal impairments. Subjects. Thirty-six adults (20 male, 16 female) without known neuromuscular or musculoskeletal impairments participated. The subjects' mean age was 21. 25 years (SD= 1. 16, range= 20 - 24). Methods. Subjects were divided into 3 groups. Subjects in group 1 (n= 12) performed squat lift training. Subjects in group 2 (n= 12) participated in free weight resistance training of their shoulder abductors, elbow flexors, knee extensors and trunk extensors. Subjects in group 3 (n= 12) served as controls. The maximum <b>lifting</b> <b>load</b> and isokinetic peak torques of the trunk extensors, knee extensors, elbow flexors, and shoulder abductors of each subject were measured before and after the study. Training was conducted on alternate days for 4 weeks, with an initial load of 80 % of each subject's maximum capacity and with the load increased by 5 % weekly. Results. All groups were comparable for all measured variables before the study. After 4 weeks, subjects in groups 1 and 2 demonstrated more improvement in maximum <b>lifting</b> <b>load</b> and isokinetic peak torque of the back extensors compared with the subjects in group 3, but the 2 training groups were not different. Conclusion and Discussion. The findings demonstrate that both squat lift and free weight resistance training are equally effective in improving the <b>lifting</b> <b>load</b> and isokinetic back extension performance of individuals without impairments.
