500|$|Towards {{the end of}} his life, Holmes {{noted that}} he had outlived most of his friends, {{including}} Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, James Russell Lowell, and Nathaniel Hawthorne. As he said, [...] "I feel <b>like</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> survivor... We were on deck together as we began the voyage of life... Then the craft which held us began going to pieces." [...] His last public appearance was at a reception for the National Education Association in Boston on February 23, 1893, where he presented the poem [...] "To the Teachers of America". A month later, Holmes wrote to Harvard president Charles William Eliot that the university should consider adopting the honorary doctor of letters degree and offer one to Samuel Francis Smith, though one was never issued.|$|E
500|$|Also in 2000, she {{appeared}} in Waking the Dead, a film based on the 1986 novel of the same name, playing Sarah Williams, an activist killed by a car bomb in Minneapolis while she was driving Chilean refugees (Strangely, Sarah Williams was also the name of Connelly's character in Labyrinth). Initially, director Keith Gordon was reluctant to cast Connelly in this role as he did not consider her a serious actress. Her agent Risa Shapiro persuaded him to watch Connelly's performance in Far Harbor. Gordon later said: [...] "There was a subtlety and depth even to her gaze that captured more of the relationship than I ever could have hoped for." [...] About her role, Connelly said, [...] "Waking the Dead was the first film I worked on where whatever I did felt <b>like</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> thing. I was really trying {{to make something of}} the part and threw myself into it, so that meant a lot to me". The New York Times described her performance, [...] "As Sarah, Ms. Connelly captures a burning ethereality and willfulness that are very much of the period. And she and Mr. Crudup connect powerfully in love scenes that convey the fierce tenderness of a relationship whose passion carries a tinge of religious fervor." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brandy also names her father, vocal coach Willie Norwood, as {{instrumental}} to her {{discovery and}} {{development as a}} musician. She exclaims that her dad “taught me everything that I know ”. About her dad, Brandy states: “I grew up singing in church with my dad, {{where he was the}} musical director and we sang gospel songs in acapella almost exclusively. He bought me my first 4-track tape recorder. At first, I didn’t <b>like</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> voice, but he encouraged me to embrace the unique qualities of my voice.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Regarding the album's lyrical {{inspiration}}, Robyn told Pete Lewis of Blues & Soul in March 2008: [...] "I {{think the}} biggest lyrical inspiration for this album {{was going back to}} when I was like 15 and on the subway listening to hip hop. Back then—because I didn't know many people in Sweden who knew about rap, it was <b>like</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> music world—where the lyrics were very direct. So I tried to return to that age when you're so strong and self-confident, while acknowledging there's also a part of being a teenager when you're sometimes very insecure and feel very fragile." ...|$|E
2500|$|The group {{developed}} a reputation for exciting and polished live performances that enabled them to work even {{without the benefit of}} best-selling records. Choreographer Atkins designed [...] "fast-stepping" [...] dance routines that became a signature of the Pips' stage presentation; Atkins later described his working and personal relationship with the group in his autobiography, Class Act: The Jazz Life of Choreographer Cholly Atkins: [...] "The one thing that I was pleased about was a stipulation in my contract that allowed me to keep working with Gladys Knight & the Pips as personal clients even though I would be an employee of Motown Records. To tell the truth, Gordy wasn't too happy about it at first, but this is something that I would not compromise under any circumstances. By that time, Gladys and the guys were <b>like</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> children!" [...] The group was a touring standout during this period with Knight's contralto lead vocals and the Pips' impeccable choreography and characteristic background vocals becoming highlights.|$|E

6000|$|He {{drew his}} hand gropingly over his face, half rose, and again seated himself. 'Whatever it may be,' he said, 'the whole thing reminds me, you know--it is {{in a way}} so curiously <b>like</b> <b>my</b> own--my <b>own</b> case.' ...|$|R
6000|$|You {{said nothing}} about my subject for a poem. Don't you <b>like</b> it? <b>My</b> <b>own</b> fishy eye has been fixed on it for prose, but I believe it could be thrown out finely in verse, and hence I resign and pass the hand. Twig the compliment?--Yours affectionately, ...|$|R
