The cases were also grouped into congenital, juvenile and senile types for broader comparison. The results showed significant variations for all the 4 main <b>line</b> <b>terminations</b> (D, C, B and A) in senile and cortical cataracts, while among other types of cataract, congenital cases differed significantly in D and A line, zonular in C and A line and nuclear in B and A <b>line</b> <b>terminations</b> compared with controls. A comparison of familial and isolated cases revealed significant differences for D and A <b>line</b> <b>terminations</b> only in cases of senile cataract. The main <b>line</b> <b>terminations</b> also indicated considerable sex-dependent heterogeneity among the diseased and control subjects. The significance of the results obtained are discussed in terms of pleiotropic mechanisms leading to the formation of cataract...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The next digital {{subscriber}} line (DSL) generation, called G. fast, extends the frequency band up to 212 MHz and achieves Gigabit data-rates. Vectoring technology cancels the performance-limiting crosstalk among DSL lines on a signal level, but requires co-located <b>line</b> <b>termination.</b> Differently, dynamic spectrum management level 2 (DSM-L 2) coordinates the transmit power spectra among interferers and thus, does not require all <b>line</b> <b>termination</b> units to be co-located. In this work we analyze the data-rates of G. fast under full vectoring, partial vectoring restricted to groups of users, and non-vectoring scenarios. We also propose interference alignment (IA) as an alternative method to DSM-L 2 {{for dealing with the}} interference in G. fast and show that IA is superior to DSM-L 2 in non-vectoring scenarios. Furthermore, we also propose time division multiple access (TDMA) for coordination of multiple vectoring groups in partial vectoring scenarios. I...|$|R
