5|$|Cebu {{was one of}} {{the worst}} {{impacted}} cities. At the local airport, an anemometer recorded sustained winds of 160km/h (100mph) early on December10, which remains a record for the city. Rainfall peaked at 195.3mm (7.69in); at the time this made the typhoon the wettest tropical cyclone in Cebu history. All buildings made of light construction materials were at least partially damaged, with many large structures sustaining roof or other damage. At least 29people were killed in the city, including the drownings of three due to the resultant flooding. The typhoon's effects caused the cessation of the city's power supply. Damage in Cebu totaled 560million Philippine pesos. At <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> other people in Cebu City were displaced. Offshore, 28ships capsized due to winds caused by Amy, including 7 inter-island vessels. This set a new record for vessels sunk by a typhoon in Cebu, and held until Typhoon Mike sunk 88ships in 1990.|$|E

With the aircraft refuelled and loaded with bombs, he—in company with the rest of the squadron—then led his flight on a total of four sorties against the enemy insurgents. No.45 Squadron succeeded in destroying with its bombs a pontoon bridge, a boat, and a trench filled with soldiers, before inflicting at <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> casualties with machine gun fire. Heavy rain washed other bridges away and by 18 June the stranded Austrian forces on the Allied bank of the river were routed by a counterattack.|$|E

The dense occupation of the north sector, which included elite activity, continued for at <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> years after the abandonment of the rest of Tikal and is perhaps linked to the nearby water supply and to continued ritual activity at Temple III. While the northern portion of the Mundo Perdido continued in use, the rest of the complex was partially abandoned.

In response, Goebbels {{arranged}} for inflammatory antisemitic material to be released by the press, {{and the result was}} the start of a pogrom. Jews were attacked and synagogues destroyed all over Germany. The situation was further inflamed by a speech Goebbels gave at a party meeting on the night of 8 November, where he obliquely called for party members to incite further violence against Jews while making it appear to be a spontaneous series of acts by the German people. At <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> Jews were killed, several hundred synagogues were damaged or destroyed, and thousands of Jewish shops were vandalized in an event called Kristallnacht (Night of Broken Glass). Around 30,000 Jewish men were sent to concentration camps.

40|$|Most {{research}} on Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) assumes ephemeral, lightly loaded deployments. Each node has {{a lifetime of}} a few hours and initiates a lookup once every few seconds or minutes. However, in giant internet data centers, each node has a lifetime of weeks or months and initiates {{hundreds or thousands of}} lookups every second. In such an environment, one-hop DHTs are superior to multi-hop DHTs. They use lookup bandwidth more efficiently. We qualify conflicting research to show that a single onehop DHT can indeed scale to at <b>least</b> <b>a</b> few <b>hundred</b> thousand nodes in stable, high-capacity enterprise networks. Two new designs are presented: One Hop Sites (1 HS), a high-capacity DHT tailored for site redundancy; and the One Hop Federation (1 HF), a global, hierarchic DHT that resolves an open latency problem. For both, the analysis a) confirms linear scalability to at <b>least</b> <b>a</b> few <b>hundred</b> thousand nodes and b) identifies the most sensitive design parameters...|$|R

25|$|Partly in {{consideration}} of Le Sage's theory, Pierre-Simon Laplace undertook to determine the necessary speed of gravity {{in order to be}} consistent with astronomical observations. He calculated that the speed must be “at <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> millions of times greater than that of light”, in order to avoid unacceptably large inequalities due to aberration effects in the lunar motion. This was taken by most researchers, including Laplace, as support for the Newtonian concept of instantaneous action at a distance, and to indicate the implausibility of any model such as Le Sage's. Laplace also argued that to maintain mass-proportionality the upper limit for earth's molecular surface area is at the most the ten-millionth of earth surface. To Le Sage's disappointment, Laplace never directly mentioned Le Sage's theory in his works.|$|E

On August 30, three hundred Mohave warriors attacked the emigrants but were repelled, with one member of the party killed in battle and eleven wounded. Another family who were not with the main party during the attack were killed in an event that has often been blamed on the Mohave, but which in Colonel William Hoffman's opinion was more likely carried out by a band of Walapai, along with seven renegade Mohave. The emigrants killed seventeen Mohave warriors. The incident was widely publicized in the media and labeled [...] "a massacre", scaring many white Californians who feared being cut off from the eastern US by hostile natives, and it motivated the War Department to quickly subjugate the tribe.|$|E

It is intermediate in size between the smaller wood stork and the larger jabiru, the two other stork species with which the maguari stork exists in sympatry {{in some parts of}} its range. Much of the adult plumage is white, with black flight feathers and a forked blacked tail. This forked tail is shorter than the stiff white undertail coverts, so that these protrude from underneath the tail and may function aerodynamically in flight. The forked tail clearly distinguishes the maguari stork from the white stork, [...] and is easily seen in flight through the white undertail coverts by an observer from the ground. During flight, this stork offers an impressive sight. It soars at <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>hundred</b> metres above the ground with an outstretched neck and extended legs, intermittently beating its broad wings to gain momentum for long glides.

Poyang Lake was situated on a strategic location [...] connecting the Yangtze with other river basins and in the early 1360s Zhu Yuanzhang held key garrisons on the lake, which he administered from Nanjing 560 kilometers downriver.

Chen's force consisted of [...] "tower ships" [...] designed for depositing soldiers on riverside city walls rather than waterborne combat, and the purpose of these ships was to capture the city of Nanchang, which guarded Lake Poyang from the south. This proved futile as the city defenders simply moved the walls back, and Chen was forced to personally lead an assault on the city gates, which was met with a counterattack with huochong (early Ming guns), and they were driven back. After this failure, Chen set up a blockade, determined to starve out the defenders, but a small fishing boat managed to slip out and reached Nanjing in time to warn Zhu Yuanzhang.|$|E
