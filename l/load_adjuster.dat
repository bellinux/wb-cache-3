The system performance is investigated by using four types of fuels in each adjusting mode. The relation between the fuel type and <b>load</b> <b>adjusting</b> mode is obtained for users and designers to select the appropriate fuel for reasonable operation modes. Results show that the hybrid system of 182. 4 kW has a high electric efficiency of 60. 78 % by using wood chip gas (WCG). If cotton wood gas (CWG) and corn stalk gas (CSG) are used, both boundary values of steam to carbon ratio (S/Cbv) and system power are higher, but system efficiencies decrease to 57. 36 % and 57. 87 % respectively. In the designed three <b>load</b> <b>adjusting</b> modes, the system can reach maximum efficiency over 59 % with four types of biomass gases. If high efficiency and a wide range of load adjustment are required, users can select Case B to use fuels like WCG and GSG. When higher efficiency and low load is expected, Case A is more desirable.

40|$|The {{variable}} and intermittent nature of many {{renewable energy sources}} makes integrating them into the electric grid challenging and limits their penetration. The current grid requires expensive, largescale energy storage and peaker plants to match such supplies to conventional loads. We present an alternative solution, in which supply-following <b>loads</b> <b>adjust</b> their power consumption to match the available renewable energy supply. We show Internet data centers running batched, data analytic workloads are well suited to be such supply-following loads. They are large energy consumers, highly instrumented, agile, and contain much scheduling slack in their workloads. We explore the problem of scheduling the workload to align with the time-varying available wind power. Using simulations driven by real life batch workloads and wind power traces, we demonstrate that simple, supply-following job schedulers yield 40 - 60 % better renewable energy penetration than supply-oblivious schedulers. ...|$|R

Moreover, a distributed iterative algorithm is proposed based on the subgradient method considering the dynamic search direction.

The model is supported with a new operational semantics that is based on a new concept, the event of states concept. A type system to guarantee type safety of ConNet programs is proposed in this paper as well. Mathematical formalization for the correctness of the type system is stated in the paper.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{parametric}} bi-cubic {{model for the}} joint probability distribution of wind aerodynamic pressures and structural responses. This non-Gaussian model is a bivariate extension of the well-known Hermite polynomial transformation. It offers {{a new way to}} determine Equivalent Static Wind Loads, with the embedded feature to –at least partly– capture the non-Gaussianity of the aerodynamic pressures and responses. In a second step, based on the observation that this model as well as the usual LRC method or the conditional sampling technique, fail in reproducing structural responses that do not overestimate the extreme values resulting from a complete structural analysis, we propose a two-step adjustment procedure that restores the non-overestimation condition and the recovery of the considered structural response. With the example of a boundary layer flow around a duo-pitched roof, it is demonstrated that the Equivalent Static Wind <b>Loads,</b> <b>adjusted</b> or not, obtained with the proposed model of non-Gaussian joint probability density function reconstruct the envelope of structural response more efficiently than with the other two techniques.

Furthermore, air conditioning systems can often be adjusted to improve efficiency while continuing to meet cooling <b>loads</b> (<b>adjusting</b> system pressures, decreasing superheat setpoints). This study presents the design of a low cost device that can non-invasively measure system operating conditions, diagnose faults, estimate potential energy savings, and provide recommendations on how the system should be adjusted or repaired.

Steady state temperatures are compared to threshold values obtained from literature and HVAC manufacturers to detect and determine the severity of faults and subsequent reductions in coefficient of performance.

A statistical model for this client-server system, {{in the presence of}} other clients, is proposed. Our contribution is that we explicitly account for the interfering clients, namely the load. Once the load on the system is understood, accurate client-server predictions are possible with an accuracy of 12. 4 % <b>load</b> <b>adjusted</b> normalized mean absolute error. We continue by showing that performance measurement is a challenging sub-problem in this scenario. Using the correct measure of prediction performance is crucial. Performance measurement is miss-leading, leading to potential over-confidence in the results, if the effect of the load is ignored. We show that previous predictors have over (and under) estimated the quality of their prediction performance by up to 50 % in some cases, due to the use of an inappropriate measure. These predictors are not performing as well as stated for about 60 % of the service levels predicted. In summary we achieve predictions which are ≈ 50 % more accurate than previous work using just ≈ 2 % of the data to achieve this performance gain –a significant reduction in computational complexity results.   Qc 20160212 EOLA...|$|R
