Concerning the theory of Khazar ancestry in Ashkenazi Jews, the authors found no direct evidence. Although they did find genetic similarities between Jews, especially Ashkenazi Jews, and the Adyghe people, a group from the Caucasus, whose region was formerly occupied by the Khazars, the Adyghe, <b>living</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of geographical Europe, are more genetically related to Middle Easterners, including Palestinians, Bedouin, and non-Ashkenazi Jews, than to Europeans.|$|E

60|$|A tale of boy {{life in the}} old Lincolnshire Fens, {{when the}} first {{attempts}} were made to reclaim them and turn the reedy swamps, and wild-fowl and fish haunted pools into dry land. Dick o' the Fens and Tom o' Grimsey are the sons of a squire and a farmer <b>living</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of one of the vast wastes, and their adventures are of unusual interest. Sketches of shooting and fishing experiences are introduced in a manner which should stimulate the faculty of observation and give a healthy love for country life; while the record of the fen-men's stealthy resistance to the great draining scheme is full of the keenest interest. The ambushes and shots in the mist and dark, the incendiary fires, the bursting of the sea-wall, and the long-baffled attempts to trace the lurking foe, are described with Mr. Manville Fenn's wonted skill in the management of mystery.|$|E

Indeed, most of the characters do not show an awareness of their disenfranchisement that would prompt them to action in order to change their oppressive situation. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> contrary, in some cases we see them acting as oppressors themselves, subjugating others even less fortunate.
