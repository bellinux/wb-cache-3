5|$|Ambulances {{often have}} two manufacturers. The first is {{frequently}} {{a manufacturer of}} <b>light</b> <b>trucks</b> or full-size vans (or previously, cars) such as Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Toyota, or Ford. The second manufacturer (known as second stage manufacturer) purchases the vehicle (which is sometimes purchased incomplete, having no body or interior behind the driver's seat) and turns it into an ambulance by adding bodywork, emergency vehicle equipment, and interior fittings. This is done by one of two methods – either coachbuilding, where the modifications are started from scratch and built on to the vehicle, or using a modular system, where a pre-built 'box' is put on to the empty chassis of the ambulance, and then finished off.|$|E
5|$|Flexible fuel {{vehicles}} were 22% {{of the new}} car sales in 2004, 73% in 2005, 87.6% in July 2008, and reached a record 94% in August 2009. The production of flex-fuel cars and light commercial vehicles since 2003 reached 10million vehicles in March 2010, and 15million in January 2012. Registrations of flex-fuel cars and <b>light</b> <b>trucks</b> represented 87.0% of all passenger and light duty vehicles sold {{in the country in}} 2012. Production passed the 20million-unit mark in June 2013. By the end of 2014, flex-fuel cars represented 54% of the Brazilian registered stock of light-duty vehicles, while gasoline only vehicles represented 34.3%. , flex-fuel light-duty vehicle sales totaled 25.5million units.|$|E
5|$|After {{extensive}} research {{that began in}} the 90s, a second push took place in March 2003, when the Brazilian subsidiary of Volkswagen launched to the market the first full flexible-fuel car, the Gol 1.6 Total Flex. Several months later was followed by other Brazilian automakers, and by 2010 General Motors, Fiat, Ford, Peugeot, Renault, Volkswagen, Honda, Mitsubishi, Toyota, Citroën, Nissan and Kia Motors were producing popular models of flex cars and <b>light</b> <b>trucks.</b> The adoption of ethanol flex fuel vehicles was so successful, that production of flex cars went from almost 40 thousand in 2003 to 1.7 million in 2007. This rapid adoption of the flex technology was facilitated by the fuel distribution infrastructure already in place, as around 27,000 filling stations countrywide were available by 1997 with at least one ethanol pump, a heritage of the Pró-Álcool program.|$|E

2500|$|Japanese {{manufacturers}} initially {{found they}} could export [...] "cab-chassis" [...] configurations (which included the entire <b>light</b> <b>truck,</b> less the cargo box or truck bed) {{with only a}} 4% tariff. A truck bed would subsequently {{be attached to the}} chassis in the United States and the vehicle could be sold as a <b>light</b> <b>truck.</b> Examples included the Chevrolet LUV and Ford Courier. The [...] "cab-chassis" [...] loophole was closed in 1980.

25|$|Building on {{his first}} {{guardrail}} designs, Sicking developed the first guardrail system capable of safely accommodating <b>light</b> <b>trucks</b> and SUV’s. As {{the center of gravity}} and bumper heights of SUV’s and <b>light</b> <b>trucks</b> increased, pre-1990 guardrails that based their designs on low bumper height vehicles were no longer sufficient. Larger vehicles began to exhibit a tendency to rollover, vault, or rupture guardrails. Sicking led his team to develop a guardrail system that addressed the needs of all vehicle, increasing the rail mounting height, moving rail splices from the posts to the midspan, and increasing blockout depth by four inches. To date, 27 states have adopted this guardrail design, 10 more are currently adopting it, and the remaining 13 have adopted or are evaluating slight variation of this system.|$|E

25|$|The average motor vehicle, {{including}} <b>light</b> <b>trucks,</b> in the US had a {{fuel economy}} rating of 17.1 MPG or 13.8 liters per 100 kilometers. The {{average fuel economy}} for passenger vehicles in the United States has remained stagnant throughout the 1990s and 2000s, peaking in 2001 and 2004. The 90s saw the slowest increase in fuel economy since 1960, with fuel economy increasing from 16.4 MPG in 1990 to 16.9 MPG in 2001. This {{is in contrast to}} the 1980s when the average fuel economy improved somewhat more significantly from 13.3 MPG in 1980 to 16.4 MPG in 1990. The increase in fuel economy during the 1990s is largely due to the rising popularity of Sport utility vehicles (SUV), whose status as <b>light</b> <b>trucks</b> gains them exception from the fuel economy restrictions placed on sedans and other cars.|$|E
