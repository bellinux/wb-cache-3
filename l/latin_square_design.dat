40|$|Assuming a <b>Latin</b> <b>square</b> <b>design</b> {{model with}} unknown and {{possibly}} unequal normal error variances, the interest {{is to develop}} a one-stage sampling procedure to test the null hypothesis of equal treatment eects. The sampling procedure is to split up each single sample in a cell combination into two portions; the rst portion of observations is used for initial estimation and the second one is then combined with the rst one for overall use in order to dene a weighted sample mean, which is used to serve as a basis for a test statistic for the <b>Latin</b> <b>square</b> <b>design</b> model. It is found that the distribution of the test statistic based on the weighted sample means is completely independent of the unknown variances. The <b>Latin</b> <b>square</b> <b>design</b> model can be expressed by a general linear model which is easy in practical calculations using matrix. A 33 standard <b>Latin</b> <b>square</b> <b>design</b> model is used to illustrate their relationship. The one-stage sampling procedure can supplement the two-stage sampling procedure when the later can not complete its required experiment...|$|E

In this experiment there are three blocking factors (soil pH, soil slopes, and corn varieties) and two variable concomitant (quantity of corn plant and quantity of baby corn).

40|$|Abstract [...] - The Sudoku puzzle {{typically}} {{consists of}} a nineby-nine grid, in which some of the spaces contain numbers; most of the spaces are blank. The goal is {{to fill in the}} blanks with digits from 1 to 9 so that each row, each column, and each of the nine three-by-three blocks making up the grid contains just one of each of the nine digits. Recently Subramani and Ponnuswamy (2009) have considered the Sudoku puzzle as an experimental design and introduced the concept of Sudoku designs. The Sudoku designs are similar to that of <b>latin</b> <b>square</b> <b>designs</b> but accommodate some additional factors. The method of constructing the Sudoku <b>square</b> <b>designs,</b> analysis and applications are also given by Subramani and Ponnuswamy (2009).

40|$|Researchers {{have known}} for many years that it takes more feed to produce live weight gain in {{ruminants}} than in nonruminants.

40|$|Statisticians {{have made}} use of <b>Latin</b> <b>Squares</b> for {{randomized}} trials {{in the design of}} comparative experiments since the 1920 s. Through cross-disciplinary use of Group theory, Statistics and Computing Science the author looks at the applications of the <b>Latin</b> <b>Square</b> as row-column <b>design</b> for scientific comparative experiments. The writer presents his argument, based on likelihood theory, for an F-test on <b>Latin</b> <b>Square</b> <b>designs.</b> A distinction between the combinatorial object and the row-column design known as the <b>Latin</b> <b>Square</b> is explicitly presented for the first time. Using statistical properties together with the tools of group actions on sets of block designs, the author brings new evidence to bear on well known issues such as (i) non-existence of two mutually orthogonal <b>Latin</b> <b>Squares</b> of size six and (ii) enumeration and classification of combinatorial layouts obtainable from superimposing two and three symbols on <b>Latin</b> <b>Squares</b> of size six. The possibility for devising non-parametric computer-intensive permutation tests in statistical experiments designed under 2 or 3 blocking constraints seems to have been explored by the author over the candidate's research period - See Appendix V: Part 2 - for the first time. The discovery that a projective plane does not determine all FIZ-inequivalent complete sets of Mutually Orthogonal <b>Latin</b> <b>Squares</b> is proved by fully enumerating the possibilities for those of size p < 7.
