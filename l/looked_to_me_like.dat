2500|$|For example, in a {{surviving}} recorded radio {{interview from}} June 25, Arnold described them as looking [...] "something like a pie plate that {{was cut in}} half {{with a sort of}} a convex triangle in the rear." [...] His motion descriptions were: [...] "I noticed to the left of me a chain which <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> the tail of a Chinese kite, kind of weaving... they seemed to flip and flash in the sun, just like a mirror... they seemed to kind of weave in and out right above the mountaintops..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Penalties {{played a}} huge {{role in the}} game. [...] New England had 10 penalties, while the Raiders had 11. [...] "That {{was one of the}} worst-called games I have ever seen in my life," [...] said an angry Patriots DE Julius Adams. [...] "I just hope they were right", Patriots coach Chuck Fairbanks said about the {{roughing}} the passer call against Ray Hamilton on Oakland's game-winning drive. [...] "It <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> Ray Hamilton hit the ball first. If he did deflect the ball, it was an incorrect call." [...] Later on, he added [...] "I’m proud of my team and the way we played today. We’re going home knowing we played our hearts out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fischer makes several {{atmospheric}} {{observations about}} his opponent's habits and {{reaction to his}} moves. In the opening game he writes that [...] "Sherwin slid the rook with his pinky, as if to emphasize the cunning of this mysterious move." [...] In another game he recalls that [...] "Petrosian and Tal both happened to stroll by the board at this point. Petrosian made a wry face which <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> 'Can Black do this and live?'." [...] "Poker-faced as always Keres made this move {{as though it was}} the most natural one on the board" [...] (Game 37). [...] "From the glint in his eye I could see that he had come prepared for my King's Indian" [...] (on the game against Botvinnik).|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, at his rival's stable, {{throughout}} Preakness week(as late as Friday, the {{day before}} the race), Easy Goer's front feet were being soaked in a tub of Epsom salts due to small scratches or cracks on both heels. An ultrasound was also performed on his ankles and knees. Some wondered if these ailments could compromise the chances of both horses. Easy Goer had [...] "problematic, puffy" [...] ankles that he dealt with throughout his career. Trainer Thad Ackel (trained Breeders' Cup Turf winner Great Communicator) stated, [...] "Easy Goer has got a couple of osselets (enlargements of the fetlock joints usually caused by excess fluid), and it <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> there's come calcification there. I was surprised that such a good horse could have ankles like that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} just like old Kit to take the law into his own hands," [...] the ranger {{admitted}} to himself. [...] "And the writing in that letter <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> Mrs. Abe Kitsong's." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{was struck}} dumb. Mr. Murthwaite {{went on with}} his cheroot. Mr. Franklin, after what <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a little private veering about between the {{different}} sides of his character, broke the silence as follows: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look Jacques! Look at that full-rigged {{ship that}} has just come out from behind that island. She <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a frigate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a swindle," [...] Teddy replied, bluntly. [...] "The {{things you}} sold were not worth half {{what you got}} for them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They don't <b>look</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> horses' footprints," [...] Tom said to Jerry {{when they}} had passed a spot where the marks were unusually clear.|$|R
60|$|I was {{slightly}} staggered at this, more especially as I saw {{the hands of}} some of the men steal down to their sides, where hung on each what <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a large and heavy knife.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{what should}} you say if I {{told you that you}} <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a boy that was made {{especially}} to help run a candy counter at a circus, and if I offered the place to you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{had heard}} {{about some of these}} things before, but not all of them. Jim knowed all kinds of signs. He said he knowed most everything. I said it <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> all the signs was about bad luck, and so I asked him if there warn't any good-luck signs. He says: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see {{something}} ahead," [...] said Giant, {{who was standing}} in the bow. [...] "It <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a signboard. Let us row up to it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who--I, my lady? {{what could}} I know? Only he do <b>look</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> the same man, and so I thought {{it right to}} say to your ladyship." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I don’t think so, lad. <b>Looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> it {{had been}} in the water some days. I reckon it’s from the Emma Brower, or some other craft.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very likely, {{and perhaps}} {{spends more than}} he makes. A good deal of it <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> make-believe. There's {{no doubt about the}} claret, but the {{champagne}} was execrable. A man is a criminal to have such stuff handed round to his guests. And there isn't the ring of real gold about the house." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{began to}} try {{to climb out of}} my hole, but as it was nine feet deep and bottle-shaped, which the light flowing in from the neck showed, I found this impossible. Just as I was giving up the attempt, a yellow face {{appeared}} in that neck, which <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> the face of Hans, and an arm was projected downwards.|$|E
60|$|I do {{not believe}} that it is suited for elephants. It lacks energy, it lacks force of character, it lacks bitterness. These things all show in the meekness and {{resignation}} of its expression. It would not attack an elephant, I am sure of it. It might not run if it saw one coming, but it <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a dog that would sit down and pray.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Luke,' says I, 'as office deputy {{and from}} a law standpoint, it don't <b>look</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> this place is {{properly}} and legally in the jurisdiction of Mojada County, Texas.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "My {{goodness}} me!" [...] cried Monica, the smaller, the drier, and {{the more}} wizened of the pair. [...] "What do you call that, Bertha? It <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> four batter puddings." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shore, Beldin'," [...] began Ladd, [...] "that {{was funny}} about Diablo catchin' Blanco Sol. Funny ain't the word. I nearly laughed myself to death. Well, I rode in Sol's tracks {{all the way}} to Casita. Never seen a rebel or a raider till I got to town. Figgered Nell made the trip in five hours. I went {{straight}} to the camp of the cavalrymen, an' found them just coolin' off an' dressin' down their hosses after what <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a big ride. I got there too late for the fireworks.|$|E
6000|$|The child suited me very well, and I {{agreed to}} take it for as many days as I might happen to want it, but to pay by the week, in advance. It was a boy, with a {{suggestion}} of orange-red bloom all over its head, and what <b>looked,</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>like</b> freckles on its cheeks; while its little nose turned up, even more than those of babies generally turn--above a very long upper lip. His eyes were blue and twinkling, {{and he had the}} very mouth [...] "fer a leetle poipe," [...] as Mrs. Hogan admiringly remarked.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{was a pause}} {{then for}} about ten minutes, as if the person were waiting {{to see whether the}} noise had awakened me. Then I heard a gentle {{creaking}} as the window was very slowly opened. I could stand it no longer, for my nerves are not what they used to be. I sprang out of bed and flung open the shutters. A man was crouching at the window. I could see little of him, for he was gone like a flash. He was wrapped in some sort of cloak which came across the lower part of his face. One thing only I am sure of, and that is that he had some weapon in his hand. It <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a long knife. I distinctly saw the gleam of it as he turned to run." ...|$|E
5000|$|Alex Salmond, the First Minister of Scotland, commented: [...] "The law {{essentially}} {{is a practical}} thing. It <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> the English law, English injunctions, look increasingly impractical in the modern world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Better go slow," [...] urged {{one of his}} friends. [...] "That chap <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> {{one of the old}} guard. He {{may have}} {{something}} to say about your doings with his daughter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{worst of}} it," [...] said Sam, {{as they walked}} slowly {{together}} to the town, [...] "is the drinkin’. Arter I’ve ’ad five or six pints, everybody <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> Cap’n Gething." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{were about}} {{half a dozen of}} us {{standing}} there," [...] he continued, [...] "and, of course, I am not experienced. The thing started suddenly, and that jerked me backwards. I fell against a stout gentleman, just behind me. He could not have been standing very firmly himself, and he, in his turn, fell back against a boy who was carrying a trumpet in a green baize case. They never smiled, neither the man nor the boy with the trumpet; they just stood there and looked sulky. I was going to say I was sorry, but before I could get the words out the tram eased up, for some reason or other, and that, of course, shot me forward again, and I butted into a white-haired old chap, who <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a professor. Well, he never smiled, never moved a muscle." ...|$|E
60|$|The Robinsons {{were allowed}} time to breakfast at that {{cavernous}} hotel--which <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> {{a scheme to}} save {{the expense of the}} passengers' meal on board the ship--and then they were off. I shook hands with him heartily as I parted with him at the quay, and wished him well through all his troubles. A man who takes a wife and five young children out into a colony, and that with his pockets but indifferently lined, certainly has his troubles before him. So he has at home, no doubt; but, judging for myself, I should always prefer sticking to the old ship {{as long as there is}} a bag of biscuits in the locker. Poor Robinson! I have never heard a word of him or his since that day, and sincerely trust that the baby was none the worse for the little accident in the box.|$|E
6000|$|We {{entered this}} haven through a wicket-gate, and were disgorged by an {{introductory}} passage into a melancholy little square that <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a flat burying-ground. I {{thought it had}} the most dismal trees in it, and the most dismal sparrows, and the most dismal cats, and the most dismal houses (in number half a dozen or so), that I had ever seen. I thought {{the windows of the}} sets of chambers into which those houses were divided were in every stage of dilapidated blind and curtain, crippled flower-pot, cracked glass, dusty decay, and miserable makeshift; while To Let, To Let, To Let, glared at me from empty rooms, as if no new wretches ever came there, and the vengeance of the soul of Barnard were being slowly appeased by the gradual suicide of the present occupants and their unholy interment under the gravel. A frowzy mourning of soot and smoke attired this forlorn creation of Barnard, and it had strewn ashes on its head, and was undergoing penance and humiliation as a mere dust-hole. Thus far my sense of sight; while dry rot and wet rot and all the silent rots that rot in neglected roof and cellar,--rot of rat and mouse and bug and coaching-stables near at hand besides--addressed themselves faintly to my sense of smell, and moaned, [...] "Try Barnard's Mixture." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a giveaway; [...] But here I am, {{and here}} I'll stay. [...] The country's pink, but we'll all be blue [...] When Trot goes home {{as she says}} she'll do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I dunno what t' {{say to you}} folks, 'cause I'm up in the air. This money may be genooine, but it <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a counterfeit," [...] and {{he held up a}} new ten-dollar bill.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm just as glad to {{have some}} of 'em off my hands, and this <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a nasty one. I don't like those Mercer people. The last farmer they ran over there raised hell." ...|$|R
