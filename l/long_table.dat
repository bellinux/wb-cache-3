5|$|This {{structure}} {{was built in}} the mid-15th century. At the southern end is a shallow raised dais on which the Lytes and favoured guests would have sat at a <b>long</b> <b>table,</b> facing the rest of the hall where the servants would have dined. The roof has arch-braced-collar trusses, with double purlins, and cusped curved windbraces. Typical of West Country design, these carved windbraces are both decorative and practical. Beneath is a cornice of pierced quatrefoils, and at the base of each main rafter is a carved wooden angel with a shield with the Lyte arms. The fireplace is 15th century, while the windows and the stained glass in them date from the early 16th century. The hall is entered from the east front porch via the screens passage, which would have divided the Hall from the kitchen and servants quarters' which would have lain {{to the left of the}} hall. The screen and gallery are not original, having been inserted by Sir Walter Jenner in 1907. He based the decoration on that of the arch from the Great Hall through to the Oriel Room. At the time of Jenner's arrival in 1907 the Great Hall was being used as a cider store.|$|E

500|$|The gatefold's inner left panel, {{opposite}} the album's production credits, showed Harrison {{and his fellow}} musicians – Starr, Horn, Voormann, Hopkins, Keltner and Wright – at a <b>long</b> <b>table,</b> laden with food and wine. A deliberate parody of da Vinci's The Last Supper, the picture was taken in California at the mock-Tudor home of entertainment lawyer Abe Somers, by Hollywood glamour photographer Ken Marcus. As with the US coinage used on the back cover, various details in the photo represent what Harrison termed the [...] "gross" [...] aspects {{of life in the}} material world. Clayson has speculated about the symbolism and hidden messages within the photo: whether the nurse with a pram, set back from and {{to the left of the}} table, was a reference to Boyd's inability to conceive a child; and the empty, distant wheelchair in memory of Harrison's late mother. Theologian Dale Allison observes the anti-Catholic sentiment within this inner-gatefold photo, following on from Harrison's lyrics to his 1970 song [...] "Awaiting on You All". Harrison is dressed as a priest, all in black, sporting an Old West six-shooter – [...] "a slam at the perceived materialism and violence of the Roman church", Allison writes.|$|E

When the security guards refuse to grant him access, he begins to scream for Spears. As the music starts, Spears, readying herself for the party in one of the castle's towers, is dancing with a group of women. The scene shifts to a castle courtyard, where Spears and a man are sit at opposite ends of a <b>long</b> <b>table.</b> Following this, Spears walks around a pool, in which she sees a man (Justin Bruening) swimming. As they begin to interact with each other, Pharrell is at the bar with a woman. Spears walks over to him and they begin to talk. Following this, Spears dances with a group of people, including Mike Myers as Austin Powers. Actors Jason Priestley, Justin Bruening and Taye Diggs also make cameo appearances in the video. Its choreography was favorably likened to Janet Jackson. The video was nominated at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards for Best Video from a Film, but lost to Eminem's [...] "Lose Yourself." ...|$|E
500|$|The Long Branch Saloon Shootout, {{involving}} Levi Richardson, {{a buffalo}} hunter, and [...] "Cockeyed Frank" [...] Loving, a professional gambler, happened on April 5, 1879. Richardson had developed some affection for Loving's wife Mattie, {{and the two}} began to argue about her. In the saloon, Frank sat down at a <b>long</b> <b>table,</b> Richardson turned around and took {{a seat at the}} same table. The two were then heard speaking in low voices. After the conversation, Richardson drew his pistol, and Loving drew his in response. The Long Branch Saloon was then filled with smoke. Dodge City Marshal Charlie Bassett, who was in Beatty & Kelley's Saloon, heard the shots and came running. Both men were still standing, although Richardson had fired five shots from his gun and Loving's Remington No. 44 was empty. Deputy Sheriff Duffey threw Richardson down in a chair and took his gun, while Bassett disarmed Loving. Richardson then got up and started toward the billiard table, when he fell to the floor with a fatal gunshot in the chest, as well as a shot through the side and another through the right arm. Frank Loving, who had only a slight scratch on the hand, was immediately taken to jail. Two days later, the coroner's inquest ruled that the killing had been in self-defense and Loving was immediately released.|$|E

"Before {{descending}} {{into the}} bowels of the ship, we had passed from the deck into a long narrow apartment, not unlike a gigantic hearse with windows in the sides; having at the upper end a melancholy stove at which three or four chilly stewards were warming their hands; while on either side, extending down its whole dreary length, was a long, <b>long</b> <b>table</b> over which a rack, fixed to the low roof and stuck full of drinking-glasses and cruet-stands, hinted dismally at rolling seas and heavy weather." ...|$|E

[...] As that room was not available, the club held its first meeting, on 11 March 1876, in rooms above the Folly Theatre in King William IV Street. [...] Two features of the club were, and are, that all members and guests sit together at a single <b>long</b> <b>table,</b> and that by tradition the club steward and the waiters are all addressed as [...] "Charles".|$|E
