5|$|Goalkeeper Tim Howard {{started his}} first {{competitive}} match for Manchester United, replacing Fabien Barthez, while Quinton Fortune was selected at left-back ahead of John O'Shea. They <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a 4–4–1–1 formation, with forward Ole Gunnar Solskjær positioned {{on the right}} wing and Paul Scholes playing just off the main striker, Ruud van Nistelrooy. For Arsenal, Jens Lehmann made his first competitive appearance. The team <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a 4–4–2 formation. Kolo Touré was paired with defender Sol Campbell at centre-back {{in the absence of}} Martin Keown.|$|E
5|$|Paul Merson {{returned}} to the Arsenal squad, after his much-publicised cocaine, alcohol and drug addiction. The England international, who was admitted to a rehabilitation clinic for treatment during his absence, started on the substitutes' bench. Arsenal <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a 4–4–2 formation, with Ian Wright paired alongside John Hartson upfront and Kevin Campbell shifted {{on the right of}} midfield. Milan <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a similar formation, with Marcel Desailly and Demetrio Albertini anchoring the midfield.|$|E
5|$|Before the match, the {{decision}} was taken to close the roof on the Millennium Stadium, {{the first time this}} had happened in the United Kingdom. Liverpool <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a 4–4–2 formation, with new signing John Arne Riise included in the team, while midfielder Steven Gerrard was absent with an ankle injury. There was also no place for striker Robbie Fowler, who was expected to captain the side. Manchester United <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a 4–4–1–1 formation, with Paul Scholes playing just off the main striker, Ruud van Nistelrooy, who made his debut for the club.

5|$|Arsenal {{employed}} a traditional 4–4–2 formation: a four-man defence (comprising two centre-backs and {{left and right}} full-backs), four midfielders (two in the centre, and one on each wing) and two centre-forwards. Manchester United organised themselves slightly differently, with Paul Scholes playing ahead of the midfield in a supporting role behind the main striker, Andy Cole. The team <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a 4–4–1–1 formation.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a 4–4–2 formation; Eddie McGoldrick was {{included}} in the matchday squad, while Kevin Campbell partnered Ian Wright up front. Ferguson deployed a 4–2–4 formation, with Paul Ince partnering debutant Keane in the midfield two. Andrei Kanchelskis was picked in favour of Lee Sharpe on the left wing.|$|E
5|$|United {{were without}} first-choice central midfielders Keane and Scholes, as both were {{suspended}} {{after receiving a}} second yellow card in the competition. Ferguson reorganised the team, with Blomqvist and Butt replacing Keane and Scholes, Beckham moving from right-wing to centre-midfield and Giggs moving from the left to the right wing. United <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> their normal 4–4–2 formation. This was the final match for Peter Schmeichel, who captained the team.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal {{was without}} injured trio Robert Pirès, Freddie Ljungberg and Giovanni van Bronckhorst and <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> their {{traditional}} 4–4–2 formation; striker Sylvain Wiltord was accommodated {{to the left}} wing, with Bergkamp playing off main striker Thierry Henry. After a lengthy illness, Liverpool defender Markus Babbel returned to the squad and was named as a substitute. Houllier deployed a 4–3–1–2 formation with Steven Gerrard, John Arne Riise and Dietmar Hamann as a midfield three and new signing, El Hadji Diouf positioned in a free role to begin with and as the game went on, moved to the right wing to stretch Arsenal's defence.|$|E
5|$|Both clubs <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a {{traditional}} 4–4–2 formation: a four-man defence (comprising two centre-backs and {{left and right}} full-backs), four midfielders (two in the centre, and one on each wing) and two centre-forwards. Wenger opted to pair Gilles Grimandi with Vieira in midfield and Wiltord up front with Henry, leaving Bergkamp on the substitutes' bench. Ashley Cole played in defence, ahead of Sylvinho, who did not feature in the matchday squad. For Liverpool, Houllier named Owen in the starting line-up, and chose Šmicer and Murphy to play in midfield. Gary McAllister, Patrik Berger and Fowler began the final as substitutes.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea fielded a full-strength team, which <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a 4–3–3 formation; an attacking {{three of}} Didier Drogba, Damien Duff and Arjen Robben. Asier Del Horno was named as left back, which meant William Gallas moved to central defence. Wright-Phillips began the match on the {{substitute}} bench. Arsenal's line up by contrast was relatively inexperienced in midfield – Gilberto Silva {{was on the}} bench and Mathieu Flamini partnered Cesc Fàbregas in the centre. Up front Dennis Bergkamp started alongside striker Thierry Henry. The team played in a 4–4–2 formation.|$|E

5|$|Chelsea <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a 4-3-3 {{formation}} while Liverpool, who {{kicked off}} the match, <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a 4-4-2. Within nine minutes Liverpool had taken the lead. Defender John Arne Riise ran with the ball from his own half and hit a shot from , which beat Chelsea goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini. Chelsea midfielder Ballack received the first booking of the match in the 7th minute after he kicked Liverpool midfielder Momo Sissoko, and his partner Frank Lampard was given a yellow card eight minutes later for kicking Boudewijn Zenden. Liverpool almost extended their lead in the 22nd minute, when Paulo Ferreira's pass to Cudicini caught him unaware, however the ball went wide of the Chelsea goal and out for a corner. Chelsea made the first substitution of the match in the 26th minute when debutant Salomon Kalou replaced the injured Ballack. Cudicini kept the score at 1–0 in the 42nd minute, when he made saves to deny González and then a subsequent Peter Crouch shot. Chelsea scored two minutes later when Lampard passed the ball cross-field to striker Shevchenko who controlled the ball {{on his chest and}} shot past Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina to level the score at 1–1.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea {{set up in}} a 4–1–3–2 {{formation}} with Terry partnering Ricardo Carvalho in defence. Claude Makélélé played {{behind a}} midfield three made up of Lampard, Ballack and Essien. By contrast Arsenal <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a 4–4–2 formation; Abou Diaby and Theo Walcott were positioned either side of central midfielders Cesc Fàbregas and Denílson and provided width. Arsenal's starting line up – averaging 21 years – was the youngest to play in a major English cup final. Before the match commenced, the national anthem was sung by Juliette Pochin.|$|E
5|$|For Arsenal, defender Tony Adams {{was ruled}} out with injury, as was Dennis Bergkamp, Marc Overmars, and goalkeeper David Seaman. Anelka did not partake, given his {{transfer}} to Real Madrid {{was on the}} verge of being completed. New signings Oleh Luzhny and Sylvinho were both named in the squad, but whereas Sylvinho started the game, Luzhny was selected as a substitute. Arsenal, like United, <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a 4–4–2 formation. Up front, Fredrik Ljungberg was paired with the club's only available recognised striker, Nwankwo Kanu.|$|E
5|$|The {{offensive}} team must <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a legal formation {{before they}} can snap the ball. An offensive formation is considered illegal if {{there are more than}} four players in the backfield or fewer than five players numbered 50–79 on the offensive line. Players can temporarily <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a position whose eligibility is different from what their number permits as long as they immediately report the change to the referee, who then informs the defensive team of the change. Neither team's players, {{with the exception of the}} snapper, are allowed to <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> or cross the neutral zone until the ball is snapped. Interior offensive linemen are not allowed to move until the snap of the ball.|$|R

5|$|In 1973, {{the naval}} museum curator Robert F. Sumrall (following Kerr) {{suggested}} a {{mechanism by which}} dazzle camouflage may have sown the kind of confusion that Wilkinson had intended for it. Coincidence rangefinders used for naval artillery had an optical mechanism, operated by a human to compute the range. The operator adjusted the mechanism until the two half-images of the target <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a complete picture. Dazzle, Sumrall argued, was intended to make that hard, as clashing patterns looked abnormal even when the two halves were aligned, something that became more important when submarine periscopes included such rangefinders. Patterns sometimes also included a false bow wave to {{make it difficult for}} an enemy to estimate the ship's speed.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} {{for an attack}} on the Hindenburg Line at Bullecourt, the 1st Australian Brigade—of which the 1st Battalion was part—was attached to the 2nd Australian Division. The attack commenced in the morning of 3 May 1917, with the 2nd Division <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> conjunction with thirteen other divisions. Despite some progress made early in the attack, the Australian forces were soon held up by strong opposition, and in the evening the 1st Battalion was entrenched in the old German line known as 'OG1'. Three of the battalion's companies occupied the line, while a fourth was placed in reserve. Their position was such that they occupied a wedge into the German line, while two flanks were in German held territory.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool fielded a 4–4–1–1 formation, {{with the}} {{surprise}} {{inclusion in the}} squad being Harry Kewell, who played just behind Milan Baroš, who himself had been picked ahead of Djibril Cissé. The inclusion of Kewell meant Dietmar Hamann was left on the substitutes' bench and Xabi Alonso and Steven Gerrard started in the centre of midfield. Milan fielded a 4–4–2 diamond formation, with Hernán Crespo preferred to Jon Dahl Tomasson and Filippo Inzaghi, who {{was not included in}} the match day squad. Liverpool <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> their red home kit, whilst Milan wore a changed strip of all white. Liverpool won the toss and kicked off.|$|E

5|$|West Ham {{kicked the}} match off, as both teams <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a 4–4–2 formation. West Ham {{committed}} the first foul {{of the match}} in the first minute as Paul Konchesky brought down Steven Gerrard, but Liverpool were unable to capitalise on the resulting free kick. A few minutes later, West Ham midfielder Yossi Benayoun advanced down the right hand side of the pitch and passed {{the ball into the}} penalty area, but Liverpool defender Sami Hyypiä was able to intercept the ball before Ashton or Harewood received it. Harewood had the first shot on goal for West Ham in the 12th minute, but it was deflected out for a corner.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the start}} of the match, a minute's silence was held, in memory of Rafa Benítez's father Francesco who died of heart failure on the Wednesday before the final. Both teams took the pitch wearing black armbands as a mark of respect. The match was delayed further when a fan invaded the pitch, he headed for one of the goals and got stuck in the goal before being caught. São Paulo <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a 3–5–2 formation, while Liverpool opted for a 4–4–1–1 formation. Liverpool had the first chance of the match inside the opening 79 seconds. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard's cross into the penalty area was met by Fernando Morientes, but the striker headed wide of the goal. Liverpool created more chances with Luis García missing the goal twice from headers. São Paulo had only created one chance, a shot from striker Amoroso, but they began to grow in confidence. They pressed forward after Amoroso's shot and defender Cicinho nearly scored with a lob from the halfway line which just went over the crossbar.|$|E
5|$|Both teams' {{defenses}} {{controlled the}} third quarter, allowing no points to be scored. Navy's McKee completed three more pass plays before his first incompletion, which came on his fourteenth attempt. Washington's offense had little {{success in the}} third quarter, being held to {{only a few yards}} gained and turning the ball over once. In the fourth quarter, after several unsuccessful drives by each team, Navy made a major error. After being stopped on their own 26-yard line, Navy improperly <b>lined</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a punt formation, and the center snapped the ball over the punter's head. The ball was recovered by Washington on the Navy ten-yard line. Washington lost two yards in three plays, and faced a fourth down from the Navy 12-yard line. Washington stacked their offensive line, allowing their left guard, James Bryan, to become an eligible receiver. Fred Abel passed the ball to Bryan, who caught it just short of the goal line and walked into the end zone for the touchdown. Washington's kicker then converted the extra point, tying the game at 14.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea were {{expected}} to <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a 4–4–2 formation, with Essien in central defence. They had doubts about the fitness of captain John Terry going into the final. He appeared to have damaged his ankle ligaments during {{the first leg of}} Chelsea's Champions League tie with Porto, though passed a fitness test just days after. Arsenal {{were expected}} to <b>line</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a similar formation, with Baptista and Aliadière up front.|$|R
