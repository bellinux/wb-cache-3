40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} {{the contents of}} green- and blue-sensitive cone photoreceptors in laminated rabbit retinal transplants. METHODS: Eleven rabbits each received a sheet of embryonic neuroretina into the subretinal space in one eye. Vitrectomy {{was used in the}} procedure and properly polarized flat transplants were placed on the host pigment epithelium. After 17 - 309 days the transplants were examined immunohistochemically with specific antibodies against COS- 1 (green-sensitive cones) and OS- 2 (blue-sensitive cones). RESULTS: All grafts displayed normal lamination with well developed photoreceptor outer segments apposed to the host retinal pigment epithelium. Occasionally, rosettes were found at the transplant edges. Both COS- 1 positive and OS- 2 positive cones were detected. In the <b>laminated</b> <b>part</b> of the grafts, COS- 1 positive cones were more numerous than OS- 2 positive ones. In the rosetted parts of the transplants the relationship between the cones was reversed. CONCLUSION: Full-thickness embryonic rabbit retinal transplants develop into laminated retinas with well-developed photoreceptor outer segment. Both green- and blue-sensitive cone photoreceptors are present and the ratio between the two cone types is the same as in the normal adult rabbit retina...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{deals with}} the {{characterisation}} of electric alloys used {{in the building of}} electrical rotating machines. Firstly, it is shown that classical devices are not suitable. They are unable to predict the behaviour of magnetic sheets under their real working conditions:the distribution of the flux density through the section of the sheets is wrong and the anisotropy of magnetic permeability is not correctly taken into account[l][2]. Then, the results are useless to compute and design electrical machines. Then, we describe a new measurement device to enable us to test either circular smooth or slotted samples, {{with the use of a}} suitable electromagnetic travelling wave. analogous to that of the airgap of the real electrical machine[2]. Finally, we give the first results obtained with the first device realized in our Laboratory. They show clearly the possibility to take into account the physical phenomenon and translate them with respect to geometrical building parameters of rotating machines. 1.

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{has been}} devised for designing cure cycles {{to be used}} in the fabrication of matrix/fiber composite <b>parts</b> (including <b>laminated</b> <b>parts).</b> As used here, cure cycles signifies schedules of elevated temperature and pressure as functions of time, chosen to obtain desired rates of chemical conversion of initially chemically reactive matrix materials and to consolidate the matrix and fiber materials into dense solids. Heretofore, cure cycles have been designed following an empirical, trial-and-error approach, which cannot be relied upon to yield optimum results. In contrast, the present methodology makes it possible to design an optimum or nearly optimum cure cycle for a specific application. Proper design of a cure cycle is critical for achieving consolidation of a reactive matrix/fiber layup into a void-free laminate. A cure cycle for a composite containing a reactive resin matrix usually consists of a two-stage ramp-and-hold temperature profile. The temperature and the duration of the hold for each stage are unique for a given composite material. The first, lower-temperature ramp-and hold stage is called the B stage in composite- fabrication terminology. At this stage, pressure is not applied, and volatiles (solvents and reaction by-products) are free to escape. The second, higher-temperature stage is for final forced consolidation...|$|R

40|$|Carbon fiber-reinforced {{plastics}} (CFRP) {{have seen}} {{a significant increase in}} use over the years thanks to their specific properties. Despite continuous improvements in the production methods of <b>laminated</b> <b>parts,</b> a trimming operation is still necessary to achieve the functional dimensions required by engineering specifications. Laminates made of carbon fibers are very abrasive and cause rapid tool wear, and require high cutting temperatures. This creates damage to the epoxy matrix, whose glass-transition temperature is often recognized to be about 180 °C. This study aims to highlight the influence of the cutting temperature generated by tool wear on the surface finish and mechanical properties obtained from tensile tests. Trimming operations were performed on a quasi-isotropic 24 -ply carbon/epoxy laminate, of 3. 6 mm thickness, with a 6 flutes diamond-coated (CVD) cutter. The test specimens of 6 mm and 12 mm wide were obtained by trimming. The reduced width of the coupons allowed amplification of the effect of defects on the measured properties by increasing the proportion of coupon cross-section occupied by the defects. A new tool and a tool in an advanced state of wear were used to generate different cutting temperatures. Results showed a cutting temperature of 300 °C for the new tool and 475 °C for the worn tool. The analysis revealed that the specimens machined with the new tool have no thermal damage and the cut is clean. The plies oriented at − 45 ° presented the worst surface finish according to the failure mode of the fiber. For the worn tool, the surface was degraded and the matrix was carbonized. After cutting, observations showed a degraded resin spread on the machined surface, which reduced the surface roughness and hid the cutting defects. In support of these observations, the tensile tests showed no variation of the mechanical properties for the 12 mm-wide specimens, but did show a 10 % loss in mechanical properties for the 6 mm-wide specimens. These results suggest that the thermal defects caused by tool wear affect tensile properties, but only from a certain coupon width below which the machining defects increase their influence on the properties...|$|R
