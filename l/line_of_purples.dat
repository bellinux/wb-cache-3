25|$|The diagram {{represents}} {{all of the}} chromaticities {{visible to}} the average person. These are shown in color and this region is called the gamut of human vision. The gamut of all visible chromaticities on the CIE plot is the tongue-shaped or horseshoe-shaped figure shown in color. The curved edge of the gamut is called the spectral locus and corresponds to monochromatic light (each point representing a pure hue of a single wavelength), with wavelengths listed in nanometers. The straight edge on {{the lower part of}} the gamut is called the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>purples.</b> These colors, although they are on the border of the gamut, have no counterpart in monochromatic light. Less saturated colors appear in the interior of the figure with white at the center.|$|E
50|$|In color theory, purple {{colors are}} any {{colors on the}} <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>purples</b> on the CIE {{chromaticity}} diagram (or colors that {{can be derived from}} colors on the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>purples),</b> i.e., any color between red and violet, not including either red or violet themselves.|$|E
50|$|In color theory, the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>purples</b> or {{the purple}} {{boundary}} is the locus {{on the edge}} of the chromaticity diagram between extreme spectral red and violet. Except for the endpoints, colors on the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>purples</b> are not spectral. Line-of-purples colors and spectral colors are the only ones which are considered fully saturated in the sense that for any given point on the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>purples</b> there exists no color involving a mixture of red and violet that is more saturated than it. There is no monochromatic light source able to generate a purple color. Instead, every color on the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>purples</b> is produced by mixing a unique ratio of fully saturated red and fully saturated violet, at the extreme points of visibility on the spectrum of pure hues.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>purples,</b> a {{theoretical}} boundary of chromaticity, {{should not be}} confused with [...] "purples", a more general color term which also refers to less than fully saturated colors (see variations of purple and variations of pink for possible examples) which form an interior of a triangle between white and the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>purples</b> in the CIE chromaticity diagram.|$|E
5000|$|On a {{chromaticity}} diagram, {{the straight}} line connecting the extreme spectral colors (red and violet) {{is known as}} the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>purples</b> (or 'purple boundary'); it represents one limit of human color perception. The color magenta used in the CMYK printing process is {{near the center of the}} <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>purples,</b> but most people associate the term [...] "purple" [...] with a somewhat bluer tone, such as is displayed by the color [...] "electric purple" [...] (a color also directly on the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>purples),</b> shown below. Some common confusion exists concerning the color names [...] "purple" [...] and [...] "violet". Purple is a mixture of red and blue light, whereas violet is a spectral color.|$|E

5000|$|In 3-dimensional color spaces the [...] "line", if present, {{becomes a}} 2-dimensional shape. For example, in CIE XYZ it is a planar sector bounded by black-red and black-violet rays. In systems focused on pigment colors, such as Munsell and Pantone, {{boundary}} purples might be absent, because maximally possible lightness of a pigment vanishes when its chromaticity approaches the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>purples,</b> such that near-boundary purple pigments become indistinguishable from black.|$|E
5000|$|Violet colors {{composed}} by mixing {{blue and red}} light are within the purple colors (the word [...] "purple" [...] {{is used in the}} common sense for any color between blue and red). In color theory, a purple is a color along the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>purples</b> on the CIE chromaticity diagram and excludes violet. Violet light from the rainbow, which can be referred as spectral violet, has only short wavelengths.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{spectral}} colors (which may be implemented, for example, {{by nearly}} monochromatic light of laser, with precision much finer than human chromaticity resolution), {{colors on the}} <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>purples</b> {{are more difficult to}} implement practically. The sensitivity of cones to both of the spectral colors at the opposite extremes of what the human eye can see is quite low (see luminosity function), so commonly observed purple colors do not achieve a high level of brightness.|$|E

The gills and rhinophores are purple and the large lateral {{papillae}} are white with brown bands. The oral tentacles and adjacent part of the head are blue.

50|$|Illuminant {{and white}} point are {{separate}} concepts. For a given illuminant, its white point is uniquely defined. A given white point, {{on the other}} hand, generally does not uniquely correspond to only one illuminant. From the commonly used CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram, {{it can be seen}} that almost all non-spectral colors (all except those on the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>purples),</b> including colors described as white, can be produced by infinitely many combinations of spectral colors, and therefore by infinitely many different illuminant spectra.|$|E

The soldiers were already crowding down into the boats, and all were so busy over their own affairs that they paid no heed to the little group of refugees who gathered round the stricken man.

5000|$|While the two colors look similar, {{from the}} point of view of optics there are {{important}} differences. Violet is a spectral color - it occupies its own place at the end of the spectrum of light first identified by Newton in 1672, and it has its own wavelength (approximately 380-420 nm) - whereas purple is a combination of two spectral colors, red and blue. There is no such thing as the [...] "wavelength of purple light"; it only exists as a combination. [...] See <b>Line</b> <b>of</b> <b>purples.</b>|$|E
50|$|RGB color model, {{although}} theoretically capable to {{get very}} close to the purple boundary due to its additive nature, does not usually do it practically due to light source limitations. The boundary of sRGB (pictured) goes roughly parallel to the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>purples,</b> connecting primaries red and (color wheel) blue and hence the gamut of sRGB lacks all near-boundary purples. Magenta ink, a CMYK's primary, is also rather distant from the line for the reason explained above. Wide-gamut RGB color space approximates boundary purples better, but corresponding devices are expensive.|$|E
50|$|Red-violet is a {{rich color}} of high medium {{saturation}} about 3/4 of the way between red and magenta, closer to magenta than to red. It is classified in color theory {{as one of the}} purple colorsâ€”a non-spectral color between red and violet that is a deep version of a color on the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>purples</b> on the CIE chromaticity diagram. Both its saturation and brightness falling short of 100%, red-violet is not a pure chroma. There is a color of similar hue that, however, comes close to being a pure chroma: process magenta. The pure chroma color composed of equal parts of magenta and red is called rose.|$|E
