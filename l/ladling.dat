It can be carved, with considerable difficulty; the Roman Lycurgus Cup is all but unique. [...] Hot casting can be done by <b>ladling</b> molten glass into molds that have been created by pressing shapes into sand, carved graphite or detailed plaster/silica molds. Kiln casting glass involves heating chunks of glass in a kiln until they are liquid and flow into a waiting mold below it in the kiln. Glass can also be blown and/or hot sculpted with hand tools either as a solid mass or as part of a blown object.|$|E

On the basis of turnover number calculation model of single cast steel <b>ladle,</b> the relationship between cast number and the turnover number and turnover times and last turnover number are further analyzed. The simulation of steel <b>ladle</b> turnover rules was taken on the 2 continuous casters with Gantt chart. After that, the relationships between turnover number and last turnover number and non-turnover number are researched deeply. Combining with the Gantt chart, the expressions of start casting time and empty <b>ladle</b> ending time and heavy <b>ladle</b> starting time were put forward. The precondition of steel <b>ladle</b> interaction is obtained, which means the exchange <b>ladle</b> should not undertaking transport task in first stop continuous caster, and the empty <b>ladle</b> end time of exchange <b>ladle</b> of first stop continuous caster should early than the heavy <b>ladle</b> start time of last stop continuous caster. After applying the model to practice, 3 steel <b>ladles</b> of No. 2 continuous caster can be reduced.

40|$|Abstract. Nowadays {{steelworks}} exists unmatched {{phenomenon of}} production rhythm between {{basic oxygen furnace}} and continuous caster, which need to saving <b>ladle</b> to ensure the caster casting, therefore the scientific-reasonable saving <b>ladle</b> control model of steel <b>ladle</b> could achieve energy saving significance. Based on the steel <b>ladles</b> of H steelworks as the research object, this article analyzes its operation process and time, matching model of basic oxygen furnace and caster. Through analyzing {{the relationship between the}} time of saving <b>ladle</b> and heats, the control model of saving <b>ladle</b> is constructed, which could calculate the reasonable time value of saving <b>ladle,</b> full <b>ladle</b> operation time and turnover cycle. Through applying Gantt chart to analysis and study the turnover rule of steel <b>ladle,</b> the turnover number control model of steel <b>ladle</b> is constructed.

5000|$|Medium {{and large}} <b>ladles</b> which are {{suspended}} from a crane have a bail which holds the <b>ladle</b> on shafts, called trunnions.

Powered rotation also allows the <b>ladle</b> to have a number of rotation speeds which may be beneficial to the overall casting process.
