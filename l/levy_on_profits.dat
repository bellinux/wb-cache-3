Corporate taxes and labor income taxes can affect both the firm owner's and the employee's incentives to commit to innovative tasks, when the former compensates the latter (a manager, technical or R&D employee) by means of variable pay tied to measures of the company's success. Results point to a complementary role between 'patent box' tax incentives and reductions in the tax rate <b>levied</b> <b>on</b> <b>profit</b> sharing schemes. This complementarity holds, albeit with different relative importance for the two tax incentives, also with non-deductible labor costs, with a stochastic innovation value coupled with a risk-averse agent, and with multiple principals competing for talented agents...|$|R

40|$|Statistical offices do {{not provide}} {{sufficiently}} disaggregated tax statistics for calculating the relative tax burden of SMEs. We estimate the respective average and median tax burden of small, medium-sized and big corporations in Germany for the period 1998 to 2007 using enterprises micro panel data by applying OLS and quantile regression techniques. We find that the average tax burden <b>levied</b> <b>on</b> <b>profit</b> over the ten years was about 24 %, and thus lower than forward-looking techniques suggest. The majority of small corporations did bear a significantly lower burden than the residual bigger corporations. We also provide evidence that medium-sized corporations faced a significantly higher median tax burden than big corporation. This implies an inverse U-shaped trajectory of median tax burden with respect to size of enterprise. Presumably big corporations are internationally operating and hence have more opportunities to manipulate the tax base. Hence, medium-sized corporations {{seem to have been}} disadvantaged to big corporations within the German corporation tax. Finally, the size of tax relief provided by the “Tax Reform 2000 ” was correlated positively with size of enterprise. This size-dependent tax burden identifies a so far neglected type of tax distortion. Future tax reforms hence also have to address size neutrality. ...|$|R

5000|$|Critics, {{such as the}} Cato Institute, {{argue that}} a {{dividend}} tax amounts to unfair [...] "double taxation". Double taxation refers to cases where tax is <b>levied</b> twice <b>on</b> the same income or gain, for example when a company incorporated in Country A has a branch in Country B, and both countries <b>levy</b> tax <b>on</b> the <b>profits</b> of the branch. This is often mitigated by tax treaties. The same can apply if an individual resident in Country A works in Country B, and both countries tax the employee's wages. But even within the same jurisdiction, profits can be taxed twice as when dividends, which are distributed corporate profits, are taxed {{in the hands of}} the shareholder, and the company has already paid a corporate tax <b>on</b> these same <b>profits.</b> This means that the shareholders, as owners of the profits, have already been taxed.|$|R
25|$|Extending {{the earlier}} {{conscription}} of whites into the Confederate States Army, Congress now allowed impressment of slaves as military laborers. Army quartermaster and commissary officers were authorized to seize private property for army use, compensated at below market prices with depreciated currency. Not {{only did the}} Confederate States Congress anticipate the U.S. initiating a draft to conscript a mass army, it began an income tax fifty years before the U.S. Government, both monetary and in kind. A graduated income tax spanned one percent for monetary incomes under $500, to 15 percent for those over $1500, a 10 percent tax was <b>levied</b> <b>on</b> all <b>profit</b> from sale of foodstuffs, clothing and iron, and all agriculture and livestock were taxed 10 percent of everything grown or slaughtered. Congress authorized $500 million in bonds {{in an effort to}} stem inflation. But in a wartime economy, inflation went from 300 percent for a gold dollar to 2000 percent from January 1863 to January 1864, an inflation rate of over 600 percent in one year. The inflation rate discouraged investment in bonds, and only $21 million was retired from circulation.|$|R
50|$|In 1919 Pearce was {{appointed}} to chair the Select Committee of the House of Commons <b>on</b> War <b>Profits.</b> Its remit was to inquire into the practicability of a tax on wartime increases in wealth and it heard evidence into 1920. Despite Pearce's chairmanship being praised for its tact and ability, the committee was deadlocked and could not agree what the level of taxation should be - if any. It continued to meet but its members only seemed able to agree that any worthwhile <b>levy</b> <b>on</b> war <b>profits</b> was not practical politics. Eventually a compromise position was reached which was endorsed by {{all the members of}} the committee and a report, drafted by Pearce, was adopted unanimously. The committee did not recommend a war profits levy, merely advising that a levy could be imposed with the support of the government and Parliament but it did recommend that if the tax were levied it should be at the most modest level put before the committee by the Board of Inland Revenue affecting no more than 75,000 taxpayers. This scheme was reckoned to bring in about £500 million pounds for the government. However, there was strong opposition in the business community and this was reflected in Cabinet discussions. Eventually it was decided not to introduce the scheme but simply to stick to the existing excess profits duties.|$|R
40|$|The {{paper on}} IRAP (i. e., the Italian {{regional}} tax on productive activities) {{to be published}} in the no. 4 / 2014 of the REM aims at in-depth analysing and checking the SVIMEZ proposal on the abolition of IRAP on manufacturing firms. This paper is a continuation of SVIMEZ papers on the same issue published since 2012 - the note by Moro and Pica published in November 2012 and, lastly, two Journals (no. 39 and 42) published, respectively, in 2012 and 2014. The underlying issue is the object of IRAP. It is a tax whose tax base is the value added. As in the case of VAT - which, ultimately, the tax is measured to and that constitutes its «reason» - it is, however, different from the tax base of it: in the case of VAT, undisputedly its object consists in consumption expenditure; through a completely analogous reasoning, we conclude that the object of IRAP is the sum of consumption, investment, exports, net of imports and depreciation. However, such conclusion for both taxes {{is based on the assumption}} that the levy is transferred forward, along the chain of production and distribution of goods: this assumption is accepted, more or less undisputedly, for the VAT, but it should be specifically demonstrated for the IRAP. In this respect, the paper by Pica, Pierini, Villani highlights serious indications, but not conclusive evidence. The analysis, carried out by region and by sector, with reference to the prices of investment goods, shows changes in both directions, which can be connected to changes in the IRAP system. There is, however, a serious shortage of available data, which prevents us from considering the evidence shown in this paper as a definitive proof. IRAP issues are particularly serious for companies operating in the so-called «Skunk Regions» of the South (so named by Luca Antonini) : they shall be liable to high rates of IRAP, which lead to, or can lead to higher price variations regarding consumption, investment goods and exports, thus seriously compromising the economic development of the territories. It has been shown, among other things, that higher IRAP rates lead to a greater benefit of the State, with regard to the tax <b>on</b> <b>profits,</b> to the detriment of southern firms: the State makes money as the tax base of taxes <b>levied</b> <b>on</b> <b>profits</b> includes the same IRAP (that is, a tax on a tax is applied, even if the profit, net of IRAP, is negative). Despite various requests, the Constitutional Court has decided not to resolve such apparent anomaly...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the neutrality features of an ACE tax reform proposal suggested {{for the company}} tax reform in Germany. As a pure ACE tax system is not feasible in practice, certain elements have been changed in the proposal: the traditional income tax of non-corporations remains progressive; there is a flat tax rate for corporations, {{but there is also}} a tax <b>levied</b> <b>on</b> distributed <b>profits.</b> Similar to S-corporations in the USA, both non-corporations and corporations (if feasible) have the option to be either taxed at the personal level of the owners within the income tax or at the company level within the profit tax (so far corporate tax). In both cases, the companies have a claim on a operating expenditure for equity cost (ACE). To analyze the proposal we extend the neoclassical model by allowing for financial assets of companies. The proposal causes that investors distinguish two rates of discounting. Therefore, as we want to determine the optimal level of investment endogenously, we cannot maximize the market value of the company. The problem can be solved by maximizing the end value of the investments. We show that the proposed tax system guarantees financial, investment, legal form, and depreciation neutrality. Intertemporal or growth neutrality, however, is only generated financing investments by retaining profits. ...|$|R

40|$|An energy-focused {{integrated}} CGE microsimulation {{approach is}} {{used to assess the}} implications of differential government policy responses in South Africa, to increases in international oil prices. The first scenario assumes that increases in world oil and petroleum products are passed through to end users with no changes in government tax/subsidy instruments. The second scenario assumes that the world price increases are nullified by a full price subsidy by government in one scenario, while, in the third scenario, revenues generated from a 50 percent tax <b>on</b> the windfall <b>profit</b> of the synthetic petroleum industry, help to minimize the loss in government revenue. Overall output falls by between 2. 2 and 2. 5 percent, while the government deficit varies from a worsening of 12 to 22 percent under the three scenarios. Synthetic petroleum, coal, and electricity benefit under the floating price scenario, while none expands its output when a 50 percent tax is <b>levied</b> <b>on</b> the <b>profit</b> of the synthetic petroleum industry. Unemployment increases among medium and low-skilled workers, while skilled workers witness a substantial fall in their remuneration, particularly in rural areas. In both rural and urban areas, women are adversely affected relative to men. The poverty headcount ratio and inequality increase slightly more in the price-setting scenarios relative to the floating-price scenario. Thus, allowing the prices to be passed through to end users probably has a less adverse impact at a macroeconomic level, although there may be adverse distributional consequences. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{extend the}} basic Classical growth model by {{introducing}} a productive and redistributive {{role for the}} public sector in an economy populated by two classes, workers (who supply labor, consume, and do not save) and capitalists (who own capital stock, consume and save).

In both cases, the analysis of taxation and government spending composition between public goods and transfers requires to specify the government's preferences. In the endogenous growth model, the government's choice fixes long-run growth and income distribution.

The ‘Deepwater Golden Triangle’ of the North American Gulf of Mexico, Brazil and West Africa has been leading the most exploration, development and investment activities in the world, and their experience on fiscal system during different development stages has great reference value other than advanced technologies. Under the assumptions of uncertain oil price and producing cost, this paper analyzed China fiscal system for deepwater oil and gas development, modeled the free natural resource tax, uplifting the threshold of special oil levy, and other scenarios, and compared their results on contractor’s net presented value, internal return rate and present index.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{question}} of taxation and capital structure choice in Germany. Germany represents an excellent case study for investigating {{the question of}} whether and to what extent taxes influence the debt-equity decision of firms, because the relative tax burdens on debt and equity vary greatly across communities. German communities <b>levy</b> local taxes <b>on</b> <b>profits</b> and long-term debt payments in addition to personal and corporate taxes on the federal level. A stylized model is presented incorporating these taxes. The model shows that local taxes create substantial incentives for firms to use debt financing. Furthermore, the paper empirically investigates the effect of local business taxes on the share of debt used to finance incremental investments by German firms. I find that local taxes significantly influence the capital structure choice of firms, controlling for a large number of other factors.

This paper attempts first to show why existing legal and extra-legal modes {{for the protection of}} privacy online are failing to protect consumers and promote consumer trust. In particular it critiques the European regime of mandatory data protection laws as outdated and inappropriate to a world of multinational corporatism and ubiquitous transnational data flows via cyberspace. In the second part lessons are drawn from the crisis currently faced by intellectual property in cyberspace, particularly in reference to MP 3 music files and peer-to-peer downloading and useful parallels are drawn from the solution devised by William Fisher of the Berkman Centre, Harvard, {{in the form of an}} alternative payment scheme for copyright holders. Finally, the insights drawn from Fisher's work are combined with original proposals drawn from a comparison of the consumer–data collector relationship in cyberspace with the roles played by truster, trustee and beneficiary in the institution of common law trust. The resulting ‘modest proposal' suggests that a ‘privacy tax' be <b>levied</b> <b>on</b> the <b>profits</b> made by data collectors and data processors.

In 2009, Japan and the United Kingdom switched from a worldwide system to a territorial system for the taxation of repatriated foreign earnings, effectively reducing the tax liabilities of most multinational firms when repatriating earnings.
