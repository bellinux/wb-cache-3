The average length of a single SnO 2 nanowire in the arrays can be controlled by adjusting the reaction time. It should be noted that the SnO 2 nanowire will bend if their lengths exceeded ca. 100 μm due to the force of their own gravity. Additionally, it was found that no nanowire grew on a blank silicon substrate (without Pt catalyst). This feature makes the in situ-grown method meaningful because the emitter patterns can be well controlled and designed by selective sputtering of the Pt catalyst using traditional <b>lithography</b> <b>mask</b> technology.|$|E

Conventional OPC is often designed for a set of nominal imaging parameters without giving sufficient attention to the process variations caused by aspherical wavefront leaving the exit pupil of the lithography system. As a result, the mask designed may deliver poor performance with process variations. In this paper, we first describe how a general point spread function (PSF) with wave aberration can degrade the output pattern quality, and then show how the wave aberration function can be incorporated into an inverse imaging framework for robust input mask pattern design against aberrations. A level-set-based time-dependent model can then be applied to solve it with appropriate finite difference schemes.

No discernable nickel etching was observed for room temperature helium exposures at 16 and 30 keV in the dose range of 1 x 10 (15) - 1 x 10 (18) He+/cm(2); however, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed subsurface damage to the underlying Mo-Si multilayer EUV mirror. Subsequently, neon beam induced etching at 30 keV was investigated over a similar dose range and successfully removed the entire 50 nm nickel top absorber film at a dose of similar to 3 x 10 (17) Ne+/cm(2). Similarly, TEM revealed subsurface damage in the underlying Mo-Si multilayer. To further understand the helium and neon damage, the authors simulated the ion-solid interactions with our EnvizION Monte-Carlo model, which reasonably correlated the observed damage and bubble formation to the nuclear energy loss and the implanted inert gas concentration, respectively.

40|$|Abstract − Scatterometry is a non-imaging {{indirect}} optical {{method in}} wafer metrology to characterize periodic surface structures with dimensions in the micro- and nanometer range. It {{is also important}} to <b>lithography</b> <b>masks</b> designed for extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL), where light with wavelengths in the range of 13 nm is applied. The solution of the inverse problem, i. e. the determination of periodic surface structures with respect to their critical dimensions (CD) and other profile properties from light diffraction patterns, is incomplete without knowledge of the uncertainties associated with the reconstructed parameters. With decreasing feature sizes of <b>lithography</b> <b>masks,</b> increasing demands on metrology techniques and their uncertainties arise. The numerical simulation of the diffraction process for periodic 2 D structures can be realized by the finite element solution of the two-dimensional Helmholtz equation. The inverse problem can be formulated as a non-linear operator equation. The operator maps the sought mask parameters to the efficiencies of diffracted plane wave modes. The operator equation can be solved by optimization, i. e., minimizing the deviation of the calculated efficiency or phase shift values from the measured ones. Clearly, the uncertainties of the reconstructed profile parameters essentially depend on the uncertainties of the input data and can be estimated by various methods. A Monte Carlo procedure and an approximate covariance method is applied to evaluate the reconstruction algorithm. Particularly, we analyze the impact of uncertainties in the model parameters by the Monte Carlo method. Reconstruction results and their uncertainties are presented for the measurements of typical EUV masks.
