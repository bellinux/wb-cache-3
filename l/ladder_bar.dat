5000|$|Back-halved - a bodied drag {{racing car}} {{that has had}} its stock rear {{suspension}} removed and replaced with a four-link or <b>ladder</b> <b>bar</b> rear suspension, and narrowed rear axle. This arrangement allows for larger tires and better adjustability.|$|E
5000|$|An {{upgraded}} Ford E4OD {{automatic transmission}} {{was the only}} available transmission. An aluminum driveshaft connected it to 4.10:1 rear limited slip gears. The suspension had front and rear anti-rollbars and a special leaf, in the rear, tipped with a rubber snubber, that acted as a <b>ladder</b> <b>bar</b> and controlled rear wheel hop during hard acceleration. Special 17" [...] aluminum wheels with Firestone Firehawk tires, Lightning badging, a front air dam with fog lamps, a 120 mi/h km/h speedometer and a special intake manifold all differentiated the Lightning from normal F-150s. Bucket seats with electrically-adjustable side bolsters and lumbar supports {{were part of the}} package. Suspension modifications provided a 1 in front and 2.5 in rear drop in ride height.|$|E
40|$|A lateral-flow, enzyme-based, bar-code assay for {{creatinine}} {{employing the}} concept of combination of diffusion and kinetics controlled has been developed. Unlike the traditional bar-code version of immunochromatographic assay, which depends on the stepwise capture of colorimetric tracer-labeled antibody-antigen complex by the immobilized antibody on each successive line, the principle of our proposed assay {{is based on the}} delay in TMB release and its diffusion in combination with horseradish peroxidase kinetics. Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) produced from enzymatic reactions acts as a limiting factor, which controls the rate of conversion of TMB to blue color complex. The assay takes advantage of giving <b>ladder</b> <b>bar</b> result therefore without the need of any reading device. Depending on the amount of enzymes used, the assay can be one (9 min) or two steps (19 min). The strip assay semiquantitatively measures creatinine concentrations ranging from 0 to 400 mu M. Thirty urine samples and thirty serum samples were tested, and the assay showed 90. 0 % and 86. 7 % agreement compared with conventional Jaffe method, respectively. This assay provides a tool for quick identification of creatinine for patients without the requirement of any instrument...|$|E

There was synergy between Nash, MacEwan, and the Fairlane, including the addition of <b>ladder</b> <b>bars</b> and a new intake manifold, and Nash achieved significant success, moving up to C/Gas.|$|R
50|$|With form being {{dictated}} by function, their appearance is often very top heavy and ungainly, {{largely due to}} front ends being raised higher than stock, {{to assist in the}} weight transfer during rapid acceleration (racing). Having their exhaust pipes exit through the front fender well is a common characteristic of gassers , as is having bodies painted in flamboyant metalflakes, pearls, and candy finishes complemented by lettering in wild fonts..

40|$|Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) {{has been}} used for many years now in the {{semiconductor}} industry to provide through-pitch focus and dose matching across an entire mask field. By adding sub-resolution features, lines with large duty ratios can be made to have similar imaging properties as dense line patterns, reducing CD variation and increasing the flexibility of the design space. The subresolution features subtract zero-order diffraction energy which is the dominating determinate of how features are imaged in the resist. A binary chrome photomask with sub-resolution OPC features was designed at the Rochester Institute of Technology and fabricated by Photronics Inc. Austin, TX. The main features of mask are 1200 nm (240 nm on the wafer) with OPC features ranging from 300 nm to 1200 nm. Different scatter bar (parallel to main feature) configurations were implemented {{to gain a better understanding}} of when sub-resolution features start to print. <b>Ladder</b> <b>bar</b> (perpendicular to main feature) size and pitch was varied to observe the effect that the proximity of OPC features perpendicular to main features has on line edge roughness. The mask was printed on 6 ” wafers using a 248 nm exposure tool (NAO. 5, a”O. 5). Shipley UVIII photoresist was coated to a thickness of 5000 A and developed with CD 26 developer. Printability data was collected through observation under a light microscope. To evaluate the effect of OPC features on minimizing CD variation, feature CDs were measured using a CDSEM. The CDSEM was also utilized to quantify the line edge roughness associated with ladder bars...|$|E

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{associated}} {{high concentrations of}} lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a) ] with atherosclerosis. We developed a rapid, one-step competitive immunochromatographic assay to measure Lp(a) in plasma. The assay is per-formed on a nitrocellulose membrane strip {{and the result is}} determined by a visual readout of rust-colored colloidal selenium. The assay is based on the principle that Lp(a) in the sample will compete with Lp(a) -coated colloidal selenium for binding to the anti-Lp(a) monoclonal anti-body immobilized on the assay strip in the format of four <b>ladder</b> <b>bars.</b> The number of capture bars that appear {{as a result of the}} formation of colloidal selenium color is proportional to the concentration of the Lp(a) protein in the samples. The strip assay semiquantitatively measures Lp(a) concentrations ranging from 0 to 180 mg/L of Lp(a...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} playground activity levels {{of children in}} grades K- 4 and compared levels of use of traditional and creative playground apparatus. The traditional playground area consisted of climbing <b>bars,</b> slides, <b>ladders,</b> chin <b>bars,</b> swings, see sews, and a merry-go-round. The creative playground contained tire hurdles, tire walk, tire climb, metal tunnels, fire poles, ladders, sand boxes, turning bars, balance beams, a slide, and two observation tower platforms. Movement activity was determined by observing {{the number of students}} on or engaged with playground apparatus. Analysis of observations revealed that the creative playground equipment was consistently more popular than the traditional with every age group, with significantly higher use of the creative play apparatus by the third and fourth grade groups- (JD) * Reproductions supplied by EDRS are the best that can be made * * from the original document. ...|$|R

It housed three gyms, two dance studios, a Finnish sauna, a medical unit, two massage rooms, lockers, showers and an office. Taking classes barefoot was a requirement. Equipment, painted in bright colors, was designed after curbs, boulders, fences, railroad tracks, and walls of a less mechanized day. Chinning bars were built in every doorway. Every child used the 42 stairs between basement and top floor for conditioning, discipline and special muscle building.

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{dynamics}} of the agricultural ladder for black farmers in the U. S. South using individual-level data from a retrospective survey conducted in 1938 in Jefferson County, Arkansas. We develop and test hypotheses to explain the time spent as a tenant, sharecropper, and wage laborer. The most striking result of our analysis is the importance of individual characteristics in career mobility. In all periods pre World War I; the war years, and subsequent boom; the 1920 s; and the Great Depression years some farmers moved up the agricultural ladder quite rapidly while others remained stuck on a rung. Movement from rung to rung has been predominantly in the direction of descent rather than ascent. There is an increasing tendency for the rungs of the <b>ladder</b> to become <b>bars</b> forcing imprisonment in a fixed social status from which it is increasingly difficult to escape.

500|$|Slang {{terms for}} {{alprazolam}} vary {{from place to}} place. Some of the more common terms are shortened versions of the trade name [...] "Xanax", such as Xannies (or Xanies) and the phonetic equivalent of Zannies; references to their drug classes, such as benzos or downers; or remark upon their shape or color (most commonly a straight, perforated tablet or an oval-shaped pill): <b>bars,</b> <b>ladders,</b> Xanbars, Z-bars, footballs, planks, poles, blues, or blue footballs. While prices for a black market substance vary wildly in time and geography, this author's personal research of {{the past fifteen years}} throughout California bears out $2.00 prices for 1mg pills (often referred to as footballs or even more anecdotally, //ones//) and $4.00 for 2mg pills (often referred to as <b>bars,</b> spinners, and <b>ladders).</b> More recently (Summer, 2017) prices for 1mg and 2mg have risen to $3-$4 and $5-$8 respectively. This is an economic result of a prescription shortage created by an FDA crackdown on opioids that alprazolam was caught up in as well.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{there is}} a growing number of cars that use a torsion bar rear set-up with a {{coil-over}} front set-up. This means the rear of the car has a torsion bar system that is identical to the 4 bar set-up, while the front-end uses shocks with coil springs. Mini-sprints use a solid, live rear axle that is positioned in the chassis by a Jacobs <b>Ladder</b> or panard <b>bar.</b> Unlike the midget or the sprint car, the final drive on a mini-sprint is a roller chain. This is {{one of the keys to}} keeping the cost of this form of racing down. A chain drive system might cost around $300, whereas a quick-change rear end like those used on sprints and midgets cost upwards of $2,000. Gearing on a mini-sprint is determined by changing either the front or rear sprocket or a combination of both. Mini-sprints make use of 13-inch wheels and tires that are identical to those found on midgets. Most mini-sprints make use of a steering box, but a few manufacturers use steering racks. Mini sprints carry their fuel in the rear of the car in tanks that vary from 5 to 19 US gallons. They have roll cages that are constructed of at least -inch, [...]095 wall Chromoly tubing. Many organizations are now requiring thicker tubing. The cars can reach upwards of 100 miles per hour which is why the tubing is needed to be thicker.|$|R
5000|$|Benson {{sees them}} {{coming through the}} {{binoculars}} and then wonders where Skips is. Skips is climbing a <b>bar</b> <b>ladder</b> attached to the dome, probably {{trying to reach the}} door. Fives points this out, and Muscle Man, who is having trouble breathing, tells him he's using all the air. Muscle Man then says to brace for impact, and all four of the cart occupants scream. Skips has then reached the moon door, which is sucking out a lot of dirt and tree parts. The four fly in, as Pops, Benson, and Wileen try to hold on to a tree all in a chain, so they do not get sucked out. After, Skips closes the door, and Fives yells [...] "Pull up!" [...] twice; they seem about to crash. They skid along the ground and finally come to a stop, and are soon ejected out. Skips, Eileen, Pops, and Benson all run over to them. Benson asks if they got a signal, and Mordecai says only for a second, making everyone else sigh. Eileen remarks the Earth is so far away now, and Skips says they have to take this one day at a time. A shadow is suddenly cast across the park, and Rigby says that it is the sun setting, saying that they made it through a day, making everyone else but Eileen cheer. She realizes that it's not a sunset, but a ship blocking the sun. As it nears, Rigby holds up the phone, the message [...] "Trust No One" [...] still on it. He and Mordecai share a worried look.|$|R
40|$|Improving {{the home}} cages of {{laboratory}} mice by environmental enrichment {{has been widely}} used to reduce cage stereotypies and anxiety-related behaviour in behavioural tests. However, enrichment studies differ substantially in type, complexity and variation of enrichments. Therefore, {{it is unclear whether}} success depends on specific enrichment items, environmental complexity, or novelty associated with enrichment. The aim of this study was therefore to dissociate the effects of environmental complexity and novelty on stereotypy development and compare these effects with the provision of nesting material alone. Thus, 54 freshly weaned male ICR (CD- 1) mice were pairwise allocated to standard laboratory cages enriched in three different ways (n = 18 per group). Treatment 1 consisted of cotton wool as nesting material. Treatments 2 and 3 were structurally more complex, including a shelter and a climbing structure as additional resources. To render complexity and novelty independent of the specific enrichment items, three shelters (cardboard house, plastic tunnel, red plastic house) and three climbing structures (<b>ladder,</b> rope, wooden <b>bars)</b> were used to create nine different combinations of enrichment. In treatment 2 (complexity), each pair of mice was assigned to a different combination that remained constant throughout 9 weeks, whereas in treatment 3 (novelty), each pair of mice was exposed to all 9 combinations in turn by changing them weekly in a pseudorandom order. After 9 weeks, stereotypic behaviour in the home cage was assessed from video recordings, and anxiety-related behaviour was assessed in two behavioural tests (elevated zero-maze, open-field). However, no significant differences in stereotypy scores and no consistent differences in anxiety-related behaviours were found between the three groups. These findings indicate that within standard laboratory cages neither complexity nor novelty of simple enrichments have additional effects on stereotypic and anxiety-related behaviour beyond those of adequate nesting material.
