40|$|The basic goal of {{this paper}} is to {{identify}} the underlying lean supply chain performance components and related measures with a special focus on small and medium enterprises in Iran's automotive industry. An initial <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> chain performance measures was compiled and then modified by six experts in order to extract the appropriate lean supply chain performance measures. Following this, a questionnaire was designed and sent to 580 supply chain practitioners working at small and medium enterprises in Iran's automotive industry in order to score the measures. Principal component analysis was applied to identify and group the lean supply chain performance components and related measures. From the initial <b>list,</b> a total <b>of</b> 28 performance measures were chosen by the experts and considered essential to monitor the leanness <b>of</b> a <b>supply</b> chain. Four underlying components were identified (quality, cost, flexibility, and delivery and reliability) and the 28 related measures were subsequently grouped under these performance components. By identifying and validating a multidimensional <b>list</b> <b>of</b> lean <b>supply</b> chain performance components and related measures for small and medium enterprises, the research can be useful for practitioners or academics that are going to evaluate the leanness <b>of</b> a <b>supply</b> chain...|$|R

For optimal isolation of Shigella, two different selective media should be used: a general purpose plating medium of low selectivity, such as MacConkey agar (MAC), and a more selective agar medium, such as xylose lysine desoxycholate (XLD) agar. Desoxycholate citrate agar (DCA) and Hektoen enteric (HE) agar are suitable alternatives to XLD agar as media of moderate to high selectivity...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{presents}} the results and recommendations stemming from a baseline survey {{on the nature of}} marketing farm supplies in Totu Division, Nyori District. The survey was conducted among retail traders in the Division early this year. It was concerned with determining the degree to which crucial farm inputs were available in Division, especially deep within the rural areas. It focussed particularly upon the availability and distribution of those inputs necessary for effective hybrid maize husbandry as an example, paying special attention to the need for repackaging these inputs in smaller quantities and for relabeling them with more meaningful terminology. Other issues investigated include determining the accuracy with which stockists estimate the seasonal purchasing needs of their clients {{and the degree to which}} main supplies are engaged in delivering inputs to stockists. Since the present study is a concomitant of the parent study, the Totu Extension Pilot Project, recommendations are cast in the light of this parent study. Thus, the study concludes that the problem of farm supplies in Totu Division may be summarized as undersupply in some areas part of the time, and non-supply in other areas most of the time. This problem is made worse by packaging of some supplies which is too bulky for the needs of many farmers arid package labelling which is product rather than use oriented. One way of overcoming these problems is by extending loans from commercial banking sources to farm supply stockists to enable them to carry a comprehensive and adequate shopping <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>supplies.</b> To ensure a steady market and increase predictability of demand, however, the programme should be closely connected with the Totu Extension Pilot Project which is currently experimenting with extending farm input loans to trainee farmers. These loans could be extended as vouchers redeemable in farm supplies from stockists and repayments made into a revolving fund which, in time, might well evolve into a farmer’s credit union...|$|E

40|$|Purpose of this paper: To identify, {{describe}} and categorise supply chain needs on secondary packaging for ambient milk products in developing countries. Design/methodology/approach: The research {{approach is qualitative}} and includes an embedded single case study <b>of</b> ambient milk <b>supply</b> chains in developing countries. Data collection {{is based on the}} review of internal company documents and semi-structured interviews with industrial experts. Findings: The paper shows that secondary packaging is a vital supply chain component in developing countries and that there are extensive interactions between packaging and the supply chain. The findings also constitute a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> chain needs on secondary packaging broken down into six categories. Research limitations/implications: In the investigated supply chains, {{the focus is on the}} actors from the filling point at manufacturers to the point of sale at retail stores in the ambient milk sector. Furthermore, the focus is on aseptic carton packages as primary and regular slotted cartons as secondary packaging. Practical implications: The proposed <b>list</b> <b>of</b> packaging <b>supply</b> chains needs can serve as input to the package design process in order to improve the effectiveness of packages in the supply chain in developing countries. What is original/value of paper: This study complements previous research in the area <b>of</b> packaging and <b>supply</b> chain by exploring supply chain needs on packaging systems in developing countries as a less studied part of a globalised economy...|$|R
