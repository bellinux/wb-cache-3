40|$|In a {{multiloop}} {{feedback control}} system, stability margin improvement by singular value shaping {{can be achieved}} by a noise adjustment procedure. A direct method for shaping singular value spectrum using constrained optimization technique is described. The design algorithm minimizes a standard LQG performance index while trying to satisfy minimum singular value constraints at the plant input, or output, or at both. Selected parameters of a stabilizing control law are used as the design variables. The capabilities of this method are demonstrated using a two input two output system representing a drone aircraft and its <b>lateral</b> <b>attitude</b> control system...|$|E
40|$|A {{stability}} margin evaluation method {{in terms of}} simultaneous gain and phase changes in all loops of a multiloop system is presented. A universal gain-phase margin evaluation diagram is constructed by generalizing an existing method using matrix singular value properties. Using this diagram and computing the minimum singular value of the system return difference matrix over the operating frequency range, regions of guaranteed {{stability margin}}s can be obtained. Singular values are computed for a wing flutter suppression and a drone <b>lateral</b> <b>attitude</b> control problem. The numerical results indicate that this method predicts quite conservative stability margins. In the second example if the eigenvalue magnitude is used instead of the singular value, {{as a measure of}} nearness to singularity, more realistic stability margins are obtained. However, this relaxed measure generally cannot guarantee global stability...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the investigation of the directional phenomena occurring when the limit of adhesion of tires to the ground is reached or overcome. To this purpose, an original mathematical model assuming the car as a system with six degrees of freedom was first developed. The mathematical model includes a model simulating the tire-ground mechanism through which the tangential forces are developed also when the limit of adhesion is exceeded. In the mean time, an original test car was designed and built in order to compare the actual behavior of the car on the road with that of the model. Much of the research time was devoted to checking and setting up the mathematical model for a correct simulation of the behavior of the car on the road. Thereafter, the mathematical model was used alone to determine time histories of important variable of the motion and parameters as <b>lateral</b> <b>attitude,</b> ground-wheel forces, over-steer-under-steer degree etc., describing the directional behavior of the car during exceptional situation as, for instance, the "tête à queue...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development and}} implementation of a single tilting rotor multirotor helicopter. A single tilting rotor multirotor helicopter is proposed that allows for decoupled <b>lateral</b> acceleration and <b>attitude</b> states. A dynamics model of the proposed multirotor helicopter is established to enable control system development. A control system architecture and daisy chaining-based control allocation scheme is developed and implemented. The control architecture facilitates the control of decoupled <b>lateral</b> accelerations and <b>attitudes.</b> Further, a computational and experimental analysis is undertaken and offers evidence that the proposed multirotor helicopter and control system architecture enables the multirotor helicopter to achieve lateral accelerations without requiring attitude actuation...|$|R
30|$|The TPB was {{originally}} designed to predict and explain human behavior in specific contexts. In this research paper, a stratified adaptation of the TPB {{was used in the}} context of apprenticeship conation. The adapted model presented relations among beliefs, attitudes, and intentions for the purpose of modeling and explaining the variance of attitude and apprenticeship choice in a <b>lateral</b> process. <b>Attitude</b> (personal evaluation of behavior) had been a theoretically relevant and important concept in the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen [1991], p 199).|$|R
40|$|A large post-glacial {{deep-seated}} {{mass movement}} is described {{from the area}} east of Vipiteno-Sterzing (Alto Adige-South Tyrol, Eastern Alps), mainly devloping in calcschists of the ophiolitic Glockner nappe (southen antiform of SW Tauren window). A close relationship exists between differential slope evolution, structural setting, and slope <b>attitude.</b> <b>Lateral</b> spread develops {{in an area where}} the dominant schistosity is subvertical and parallel to the slope, and is facilitated by dissolution of evaporite-bearing bodies. Sackung develops in an area with low-angle schistosity and NNE-SSW high angle faults, parallel to the ridge segment. A huge rock-fall was set off the intersection of the steep N-Dipping schistosity with E-W and N-S to NNE-SSW fault and joints. As a whole, the deep-seated gravitational slope deformation (DSGSD) is an outstanding example of how the mechanics of large mass movements and their potential evolution are controlled by the structural framework, which is the ultimate result of a complex tectonic history...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{focuses on}} the {{prediction}} of the safe autorotation landing operations of a helicopter following engine failure. The autorotation landing procedure is formulated as a nonlinear optimal control problem based on an augmented six-degree-of-freedom rigid-body flight dynamic model. First, the cost function and constraints are properly selected. The direct transcription approach is then employed to solve the optimal control problem. For a UH- 60 helicopter, the optimal solutions with the rigid-body model are compared with those obtained using a two-dimensional point-mass model. It is found that the optimal solutions using the two different models show reasonably good agreement, and furthermore the optimal solutions using the rigid-body model involve the time histories of angular rates and <b>attitudes,</b> <b>lateral</b> velocity and position, as well as pitch controls. Finally the optimal control formulations with different cost functions are proposed for taking account of 1 -s time delay and minimum touchdown speed. The calculated control strategies and trajectories are realistic...|$|R
40|$|The CPCP is an interdisciplinary, multi-institutional coring project {{designed}} {{to decipher the}} biotic, climatic, and tectonic evolution of the first 100 million years of the Mesozoic Earth System (Triassic and Jurassic, ~ 250 – 145 Ma) as expressed in the epicontinental basins of the Colorado Plateau and its environs. This community-driven science and coring project derives from an international workshop (November, 2007) involving broad segments of the Earth science community. Motivating the CPCP {{is the need to}} understand the links between major events in the history of life, climate change, and Earth System crises during the Early Mesozoic, particularly the two major and two subsidiary mass extinction events, the ascent of the dinosaurs, and the origin of the modern biota. While Colorado Plateau outcrops comprises a unique field laboratory with a long history of research, a scientific coring program is essential because the most continuous sections in outcrop are either inaccessible in vertical cliffs or are intensely weathered and geochemically altered, making geological observations and sampling at the appropriate level of detail practically impossible. Furthermore, the shallow bedding <b>attitudes,</b> <b>lateral</b> facies changes, and covered intervals compromise unambiguous superposition in surface sections over long geographic traverses that so far have inhibited the assembly of a comprehensive chronostratigraphi...|$|R
40|$|Communication is {{the corner}} {{stone of the}} {{relationship}} with the patient in all medical settings with the main aims of creating a good inter-personal relationship, exchanging information, and making treatment-related decisions. In a rapidly changing cultural and social context, the paternalistic approach of doctors knowing the best and deciding what should be done for a patient {{has been replaced by a}} shared decision-making approach, with patients being advised to educate themselves, ask questions and influence the course of the discussion with their doctors. Thus, a need for an improvement in the communication skills of physicians is extremely important for patients affected by serious physical illness (e. g. cancer, HIV infection, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic <b>lateral</b> sclerosis). Certain <b>attitudes,</b> behaviour and skills (e. g. capacity to impart confidence, being empathetic, providing a ‘human touch', relating on a personal level, being forthright, being respectful, and being thorough) are part of effective communication. However, some specific aspects influencing doctor-patient communication and relationships, such as personality variables, coping and attachment styles, as well as cultural factors, should also be taken in to account. The development of training curricula to help doctors acquire proper skills in communication is mandatory, since research has shown that training in communication may facilitate the effectiveness of a doctor-patient relationship and the patient's satisfaction with care and give a general sense of humanity, which is easily lost in a biotechnologically oriented medicine...|$|R
