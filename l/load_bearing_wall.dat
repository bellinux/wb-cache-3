Building 2 was structurally connected to the adjoining 22-story Building 1, which caused it to pull Building 1 laterally eastward during its collapse. This extreme lateral shift caused the failure of enough support columns to result in the collapse of Building 1.

50|$|The {{infill wall}} is the {{supported}} wall that closes {{the perimeter of}} a building constructed with a three-dimensional framework structure (generally made of steel or reinforced concrete). Therefore, the structural frame ensures the bearing function, whereas the infill wall serves to separate inner and outer space, filling up the boxes of the outer frames. The infill wall has the unique static function to bear its own weight. The infill wall is an external vertical opaque type of closure. With respect to other categories of wall, the infill wall differs from the partition that serves to separate two interior spaces, yet also non-load bearing, and from the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>wall.</b> The latter performs the same functions of the infill wall, hygro-thermically and acoustically, but performs static functions too.|$|E
5000|$|Truss uplift or truss lift is {{when the}} wood in wooden trusses shrinks, or cures, and the bottom most piece bows upwards, most notably near the middle. Truss lift is an issue in wood frame {{construction}} where non-load bearing drywall walls meet drywall ceilings, as the truss lifts it pulls the ceiling drywall up. This in turn pulls the angle tape {{out of the corner}} and can damage the spray texture. One solution is to not fasten the ceiling drywall within two feet of a non <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>wall,</b> and rather use the drywall on the wall as support. This technique will allow the ceiling board to bow down and stay tight to the angle over time as the truss lifts.|$|E

A composite LSF wall panel system was developed recently, where a thin insulation was sandwiched between two plasterboards to improve the fire performance of LSF walls. Many experimental and numerical studies have been undertaken to investigate the fire performance of non-load <b>bearing</b> LSF <b>wall</b> under standard conditions.

The PSSDB system is as an alternative construction technique on <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>wall</b> panel that offers cost savings synonymously with the rapid progress {{of science and technology}} which leads to the shift from traditional utilization of construction materials to newer construction techniques. A finite element analysis was carried out to determine the effect of screw spacing on the PSSDB wall panel.

Bricks are normally used as infill materials in framed structures in conventional design and construction of buildings.

The aspect ratio (h/ 1) and the slenderness ratio (h/t) of both samples are 1. 2 and 12. 82 respectively. The strength of concrete infill inside the PSSDBWPA and PSSDBWPB are 20. 8 N/mm 2 and 32. 5 N/mm 2 respectively determined by Schmidt rebound hammer test. These wall panels are tested under direct axial lone load to monitor structural performance of the wall.

The increment of concrete infill from grade 20 to grade 30 decreased deflection CIPSSDBWP by 43. 33 % but increased 58 % ultimate strength capacity. Generally similar crack patterns were observed in both samples, it was observed that increasing on the strength of concrete infill inside the wall panel also increased the first cracking load and the number of crack but the ratio of first crack load over ultimate load remain close to CI-PSSDBWPA.

40|$|Fire {{safety of}} {{light gauge steel}} frame (LSF) stud walls is {{important}} in the design of buildings. Currently LSF walls are increasingly used in the building industry, and are usually made of cold-formed and thin-walled steel studs that are fire-protected by two layers of plasterboard on both sides. Many experimental and numerical studies have been undertaken to investigate the fire performance of <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> LSF <b>walls</b> under standard fire conditions. However, the standard time-temperature curve does not represent the fire load present in typical residential and commercial buildings that include considerable amount of thermoplastic materials. Real building fires are unlikely to follow a standard time-temperature curve. However, only limited research has been undertaken to investigate the fire performance of <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> LSF <b>walls</b> under realistic design fire conditions. Therefore in this research, finite element thermal models of the traditional LSF wall panels without cavity insulation and the new LSF composite wall panels were developed to simulate their fire performance under recently developed realistic design fire curves. Suitable thermal properties were proposed for plasterboards and insulations based on laboratory tests and literature review. The developed models were then validated by comparing their thermal performance results with available results from realistic design fire tests, and were later used in parametric studies. This paper presents the details of the developed finite element thermal models of <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> LSF <b>wall</b> panels under realistic design fire time-temperature curves and the re-sults. It shows that finite element thermal models can be used to predict the fire performance of <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> LSF <b>walls</b> with varying configurations of insulations and plasterboards under realistic design fires. Failure times of <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> LSF <b>walls</b> were also predicted based on the results from finite element thermal analyses...|$|R
