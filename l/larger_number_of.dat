5|$|In 1922, {{the number}} of {{supporters}} had surpassed 20,000 and by lending money to the club, Barça was able to build the larger Camp de Les Corts, which had an initial capacity of 20,000 spectators. After the Spanish Civil War the club started attracting more members and a <b>larger</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> spectators at matches. This led to several expansion projects: the grandstand in 1944, the southern stand in 1946, and finally the northern stand in 1950. After the last expansion, Les Corts could hold 60,000 spectators.|$|E

5|$|Loveless is {{the second}} studio album by Irish rock band My Bloody Valentine, {{released}} on 4 November 1991 by Creation Records. The album was recorded {{over a two-year period}} between 1989 and 1991. Vocalist and guitarist Kevin Shields dominated the arduous recording process; intent on achieving a particular sound, he experimented with texturised guitar tremolo techniques and tuning systems, unorthodox production methods, obscured vocals, and sampled percussion and feedback. The group cycled through nineteen studios and a <b>larger</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> engineers during the album's two-year creation, with total recording costs rumoured to have reached £250,000.|$|E

In studying such objects, the interest for mathematical statisticians {{lies in the fact that}} most of the frequencies are small and, therefore, difficult to deal with. It is not immediately clear how one should be able to derive consistent and reliable inference from a <b>large</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> such frequencies. In this thesis we study the diversity of questionnaires with multiple answers. It has been demonstrated that this is a particular model of LNRE theory. In our analysis, the theories of large deviation, contiguity and Edgeworth expansion were employed, and limit theorems have been established...|$|R

After much discussion, it was decided via a vote that those bodies should instead be classified as dwarf planets.|$|E

5|$|D'Eyncourt {{probably}} avoided proposing any {{design with}} 16-inch guns {{when he saw}} the political situation.

Author David Topliss attributes this to political necessity, as he believed the Minister of the Navy could not validate purchasing a seemingly less-powerful dreadnought than the Minas Geraes class: with larger guns ruled out, the only remaining choice was a <b>larger</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> guns.|$|E

El Salvador was placed in the four team group Honduras, the Netherlands Antilles, and Nicaragua, which they topped with two wins and one draw. In the decisive round they finished in second place behind Costa Rica, who won their seventh CCCF Championship. Afterward the tournament was dissolved and replaced with the CONCACAF Championship.|$|E
5|$|Epidemiological {{studies of}} {{serotonin}} syndrome are difficult as many physicians {{are unaware of}} the diagnosis or they may miss the syndrome due to its variable manifestations. In 1998 a survey conducted in England found that 85% of the general practitioners that had prescribed the antidepressant nefazodone were unaware of serotonin syndrome. The incidence may be increasing as a <b>larger</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> pro-serotonergic drugs (drugs which increase serotonin levels) are now being used in clinical practice. One postmarketing surveillance study identified an incidence of 0.4 cases per 1000 patient-months for patients who were taking nefazodone. Additionally, around 14 to 16 percent of persons who overdose on SSRIs are thought to develop serotonin syndrome.|$|E

Some hi-fi aficionados solved the problem by using reel-to-reel tape players which were capable of delivering accurate, naturally deep bass from acoustic sources, or synthetic bass not found in nature. With the popular introduction of the compact cassette and the CD, it became possible to add more low frequency content to recordings, and satisfy a <b>larger</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> consumers.
