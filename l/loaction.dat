40|$|In this paper, {{a hybrid}} {{algorithm}} for precise eyes localization in color facial region is presented In practice, most eye detection {{suffer from the}} influence of illumination and face pose. Multiple techniques are integrated in this algorithm to overcome these limitations, such as color space mapping, illumination correction, mouth detecion, dynamic threshold and so on. The scheme consists of two stage: eye region extraction and fine eye <b>loaction.</b> Firstly, with aids of clustering information of eyes in color image and gray-level image, we highlight possible eye regions. Through binarization and morphological operation, we can reserve major blocks and remove most of tiny blocks. For accurate extraction to the best, the threshold of binarization is adjusted appropriately according to heuristic rules test feedback. Heuristic rules are established in terms of priori knowedge about geometrical relationship among facial components. Thereby, we can filter out most of non-eye candidates and allow more possible candidates to be selected as eyes. In the stage of fine eye location, we employ twice extraction to find eye center via projection function and verify validation of <b>loaction</b> by similarty matching finally. With regard to variable lighting, we have adopted an effective local illumination correction to reduce interference. some other experiments are carried out to investigate method capability on variations of pose, facial expressions, partial occlusions and lighting conditions on face images. Experiment results indicate our algorithm can achieves promising performance under certain illumination and various face poses conditionsShanghai Univ Elect Power, IEEE, Springer, APNNA, NSF...|$|E
40|$|The {{accurate}} {{estimation of}} ultrasonic Time-of-flight (TOF) {{is essential in}} ultrasonic object <b>loaction</b> system. In this study, a new method for TOF estimation through envelope is proposed. Firstly, the Hilbert Transform (HT) is used in ultrasonic signal processing in order to extract the envelope of the echo and to reduce the computational burden. Then, the wavelet denoising technique {{is applied to the}} extracted noisy envelope to improve the estimation accuracy. Finally, the echo parameters are estimated by using a Modified Gauss Newton (MGN) based nonlinear Least Squares (LS) estimation method. Numerical simulation has been carried out to show the performances of the proposed method in estimating TOF of ultrasonic signal...|$|E

In the 1970 s and 1980 s, {{the power of the}} technique was extended from one dimension to two and even three dimensions, opening up exciting applkications in both chemistry and biochemistry. the success of one dimensional. high-resolution NMR stems from the unique insights that it can provide about molecular structure. The chemical shift of a nucleus gives invaluable information abut the chemical environment in which that nucleus is located, Coupling interactions between hydorgen nuclei, as revealed by characteristic splitting patterns inthe 1 H-NMR spectrum, provide informaton about the <b>loaction</b> of one group of hydorgen atoms relative to others inthe molecule. And the nuclearf Overhauser effect (nOe) can shed light on molecular stereochemistry...|$|E
40|$|An {{approach}} is presented which provides the tune change <b>loactions</b> within {{a set of}} Irish traditional turnes. Also provided are semantic labels for each part of each tune within the set. A set in Irish traditional music is a number of individual tunes played segue. Each of the tunes in the set {{are made up of}} structural segments called parts. Musical variation is a prominent characteristic of this genre. However, a certain set of notes known as "set accented tones" are considered impervious to musical variation. Chroma information is extracted at "set accented tone" locations within the music. The resulting chroma vectors are grouped to represent the parts of the music. The parts are then compared with one another to form a part similarity matrix. Unit kernels which represent the possible structures of an Irish traditional tuens are matched with the part similarity matrix to determine the tune change locations and semantic part labels...|$|R
40|$|Using unique panel {{data from}} the Young Lives study on child poverty {{in the state of}} Andhra Pradhesh (before its {{division}} into Andhra Pradesh and Telangana), this paper seeks to explore the factors affecting the completion of secondary education. Logistic regression analysis reveals that there are a multitude of factors, cutting across the household, individual, educational and socio-demographic domains. The paper highlights the significance of children acquiring reading and writing skills in the early primary grades, having high selfefficacy and not participating in paid work before the age of 12. Gender continues to work as a barrier to secondary school completion for girls, and the findings suggest that educational policy must ensure that children, particularly girls and those living in rural <b>loactions,</b> are provided with a good-quality education right from pre-school, and through primary schooling and beyond. It is also important that children in primary school are not drawn into paid work, since this has a detrimental effect on long-term schooling – in this case secondary education completion...|$|R

Through the assistance of cooperators in diverse <b>loactions</b> throughout the semi-arid tropics the IPMDRTP aims to identify sources of disease resistance that is stable across pathogen population and environments. The iPMSN was initinated in 1977 with the participation of cooperators in Senegal, Nigeria, and India and five promising lines were identified. In 1978 the IPMSN was sent to cooperators at 12 locations in 7 countries and the results were received from 6 locations in 4 countries. Ten of the 34 entries were identified promising with across locations mean smut severity of not more than 10 percent. In 1979 the 37 entry IPMSN was sent to cooperators at 6 locations in 5 countries and the were identified as highly resistant with across IPMSN was sent to cooperators at 8 locations in 4 countries and results received from 6 locations in 3 countries are presented in this repor...|$|R
40|$|AbstractExtrusion {{process has}} proved its {{potential}} in bulk metal forming process since the industrial development. The better product quality, mechanical {{property and the}} strength of the extruded products are the advantages in extrusion process. Multi-hole extrusion is used where pressure required for extrusion is in excess of press capacity. It is used for the production of small and precise products such as parts used in automobiles, health-care and aviation industries. The different process parameters affect the extrusion process and quality of the extruded products. In the present investigation, finite element analysis is carried out to study the effect of <b>loaction</b> of holes on the die, die pockets and the extrusion speed on the extrusion load, efective strain and the extruded product length. Extrusion load is found to increase with increase in extrusion speed. The die pockets help in reducing the extrusion load. The effective strain, which provides the information about the work hardening of the material during the extrusion process is dependentof the above said process parameters. The extruded product lengths become more uniform when die pockets are made. The selection of process parameter is based upon the required quality of the product...|$|E
40|$|The hedonic {{literature}} has established that public water bodies provide external bene 8 ̆ 5 ts that are reected {{in the value}} of nearby residential real estate. The {{literature has}} employed several approaches to quantify these nonmarket services. With a residential hedonic model, this paper tests whether model speci cation a¤ects resource valuation using an actively managed reservoir in Indiana and a passively managed lake in Connecticut. The results indicate that valuation is quite sensitive to model speci 8 ̆ 5 cation, and that omitting either the waterview or waterfront variables from the hedonic function likely results in a misspeci ced model. The 8 ̆ 5 ndings from this study are important for researchers and public agencies charged with managing water resources to bear in mind as the external bene 8 ̆ 5 ts from existing or proposed man-made lakes and reservoirs are estimated. Therefore, while it requires considerably more e¤ort to determine which properties are in waterfront <b>loactions</b> and which properties have a view, the potential misspeci 8 ̆ 5 cation of "distance-only " models likely justi 8 ̆ 5 es these extra research costs. Further, the 8 ̆ 5 ndings in this analysis call into question results from "distance-only " models in the literature...|$|R
