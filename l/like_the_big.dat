5|$|The {{river was}} {{formerly}} a food source with yabbies, mussels and small fish, however {{the reduction in}} water quality, changing of the river's habitat, and introduction of European fish species {{has led to a}} reduction in fauna quantity and diversity. Exotic pest species such as the European carp, redfin perch and trout have greatly reduced native fish populations <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> headed gudgeon (Philypnodon grandiceps) but native waterfowl are common along the river with Pacific black ducks, Australian wood ducks, black swans, ibis, egrets and herons amongst the more than 100 species seen. The number of exotic waterfowl species such as mallards has reduced in recent years. In places the steep banks of the river are an ideal habitat for long-necked tortoises.|$|E
5|$|The former British colonies include Trinidad and Tobago, whose calypso {{style is}} an {{especially}} potent part of {{the music of the}} other former British colonies, which also share traditions <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Drum dance. The French islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe share the popular zouk style and have also had extensive musical contact with the music of Haiti, itself once a French colony though not part of the Lesser Antilles. The Dutch colonies of Curaçao, Bonaire and Aruba share the combined rhythm popular style. The islands also share a passion for kaseko, a genre of Surinamese music; Suriname and its neighbors Guyana and French Guiana share folk and popular styles that are connected enough to the Antilles and other Caribbean islands that both countries are studied in the broader context of Antillean or Caribbean music.|$|E

500|$|ITV {{describe}} Betty as a [...] "linchpin" [...] of {{the soap}} opera, stating that: [...] "She’s {{as much a}} part of Coronation Street as the cobble stones." [...] Former executive producer, Brian Park, suggested in 1997 that characters such as Betty [...] "are essential ingredients. They're <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> clock on the mantelpiece." [...] Park elaborated on his opinion of Betty when he left the serial as producer in 1998, saying, [...] "I don't mean it disrespectfully but [...] people like Betty Driver, who plays Betty Williams [...] are what I call the mantelpiece ornaments. She'll probably never hold down a major storyline but she's part of the weave." ...|$|E
500|$|When The Band {{began work}} on their debut album, Music from Big Pink, in a New York studio in January 1968, they {{employed}} a recording technique {{similar to the one}} they had become familiar with during The Basement Tapes sessions. As Robertson described it, [...] "We used the same kind of mike on everything. A bit of an anti-studio approach. And we realized what was comfortable to us was turning wherever we were into a studio. <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Pink technique." [...] That technique influenced groups including The Beatles, writes Griffin, who calls their Twickenham Get Back sessions in early 1969 an effort to record [...] "in the honest, live, no frills, no overdubs, down home way that The Hawks/Band did for The Basement Tapes".|$|E
500|$|... "Behind the Crooked Cross" [...] {{is rarely}} played live as Hanneman hates the track, though King has {{always wanted to}} play it [...] "because it's got a cool intro" [...] despite it not being his {{favorite}} song. King said [...] "that's fine" [...] when speaking of the situation, noting [...] "there are songs {{that he wants to}} play that I always shoot down". [...] "Ghosts of War" [...] isn't King's favorite song either, which he attests [...] "everybody always wants to hear" [...] performed live. He confessed; [...] "I like the ending, you know, I <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> heavy part and I always say, 'Let's put the heavy ending at the end of [...] "Chemical Warfare" [...] and just do the last half.' But I could never make that fly." ...|$|E

500|$|Known as {{an outspoken}} player, Hull earned a {{reputation}} {{on and off the}} ice for speaking bluntly and without regard for whom it might offend. [...] He chastised his own fans in 1992 – later backtracking – when they booed Adam Oates following Oates' trade request, calling them [...] "losers" [...] and stating he wanted to rip one particular fan's head off. Hull was a consistent critic of the NHL's defensive, [...] "clutch and grab" [...] era of the late 1990s, raising the ire of commissioner Gary Bettman in 1998 when he said [...] "I wouldn't pay to watch. It's boring. The whole style of the game is terrible. There's no flow. When a guy like [...] Lemieux leaves the game and tells you why he's leaving, and you don't address it, that's stupid. But the players don't say crap. That's why I always look <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> mouth." ...|$|E
500|$|Newsarama's Richard Gray {{gave the}} second part of [...] "Trinity War", Justice League of America #6, a 7 out of 10. Gray felt this issue was [...] "the {{difficult}} middle chapter {{of the first half of}} this crossover" [...] and that [...] "the issue works successfully in building up the pieces of the broader puzzle, but it may leave readers attached to the core members of the team out in the cold." [...] He noted that the issue was more reflective in tone, opposed to pitched battles on every page. Gray criticized that the issue felt more like a Justice League issue, with the Justice League of America members all taking a back seat to the issue's events. He added that Doug Mahnke's pencils grounded the story in Geoff John's universe, but felt the battle sequences were not as good as Ivan Reis' in Justice League 22. Jesse Schedeen of IGN, who gave the issue an 8.1 out of 10, was wary that the [...] "heavy emphasis on The Outsider and his schemes made [...] "Trinity War" [...] feel less <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> event DC has been building towards since the start of the New 52 and more like another stepping stone on the road to Forever Evil," [...] but was surprised at Johns' ability to not dwell on The Outsider that much in this issue, and give each member a moral ambiguity, questioning their role in the conflict. Schedeen, however, was disappointed at how little the Trinity of Sin appeared in the issue. He also felt that the Justice League of America series got its strongest contender for art in Mahnke, but noted that it was not his best effort. Comic Book Resources gave the issue 3.5 stars out of 5, with Doug Zawisza saying he was not impressed with the issue, with a lot going on, and nothing really moving forward. He felt that Mahnke's art excelled in certain characters, especially Hawkman, Martian Manhunter and Frankenstein.|$|E

2500|$|Film critic Carl Mazek {{makes the}} case that the [...] "Machiavellian attitude" [...] of John Baron links the picture with the brutal films noir of the 1950s <b>like</b> <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> Night (1951) and Kiss Me Deadly (1955). Moreover, the themes of violence, sense of {{claustrophobia}} and despair mark the film as completely amoral, and, as such, Suddenly is quite opposite of non-noir films like The Desperate Hours (1955).|$|E
2500|$|For {{the first}} two years of his career, Jackson had some trouble {{adjusting}} to life with the Athletics; reports conflict as to whether he just did not <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> city, or if he was bothered by hazing from teammates. Consequently, he spent a great portion of that time in the minor leagues. Between 1908 and 1909, Jackson appeared in just 10 games.

2500|$|The hamburger's {{international}} popularity {{demonstrates the}} larger globalization {{of food that}} also includes the rise in global popularity of other national dishes, including the Italian pizza, and Japanese sushi. The hamburger has spread from continent to continent perhaps because it matches familiar elements in different culinary cultures. This global culinary culture has been produced, in part, by the concept of selling processed food, first launched in the 1920s by the White Castle restaurant chain and its visionary Edgar Waldo [...] "Billy" [...] Ingram and then refined by McDonald's in the 1940s. This global expansion provides economic points of comparison <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Mac Index, by which one can compare the purchasing power of different countries where the Big Mac hamburger is sold.|$|E

2500|$|In his {{liberation of}} Paris speech, de Gaulle argued [...] "It {{will not be}} enough that, with the help of our dear and admirable Allies, we have got rid of him [...] from our home for us to be {{satisfied}} after what happened. We want to enter his territory as it should be, as victors", clearly showing his ambition that France be considered one of the World War II victors just <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Three. This perspective was not shared by the western Allies, as was demonstrated in the German Instrument of Surrender's First Act. The French occupation zones in Germany and in West Berlin cemented this ambition, leading to some frustration on the part of other European nations, which became part of the deeper Western betrayal sentiment. This sentiment was felt by other European Allies, especially Poland, whose proposition that they be part of the occupation of Germany was rejected by the Soviets; the latter taking the view that they had liberated the Poles from the Nazis which thus put them {{under the influence of the}} USSR.|$|E
