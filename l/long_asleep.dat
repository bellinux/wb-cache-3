60|$|Being disgusted {{as well as}} {{surprised}} that their leader {{was not going to}} fish, Jim Greely, being also exhausted by long watching, went below and turned in to have a sleep.

60|$|As {{he opened}} the door and dashed into the darkened cabin (for both Matt and Molly were <b>long</b> ago <b>asleep</b> in bed) there was a flash of light, and even as he slammed to the door behind him there was an instant peal of thunder, heavy as though a great weight had been dropped upon the roof of the sky, so that the doors and windows of the cabin rattled.|$|R

60|$|It was {{the lot of}} the voyagers, one night, to encamp at one {{of these}} buffalo landing places, and exactly on the trail. They had not been <b>long</b> <b>asleep,</b> when they were awakened by a great bellowing, and tramping, and the rush, and splash, and {{snorting}} of animals in the river. They had just time to ascertain that a buffalo army was entering the river on the opposite side, and making toward the landing place. With all haste they moved their boat and shifted their camp, by which time the head of the column had reached the shore, and came pressing up the bank.|$|E

60|$|As {{the evening}} went on, the wine grew more to my taste; the spirits proved {{better than the}} wine; the company was genial. This was the highest water mark of popular favour on the whole cruise. After all, being in a Judge's house, was there not {{something}} semi- official in the tribute? And so, remembering what a great country France is, we did full justice to our entertainment. Landrecies had been a <b>long</b> while <b>asleep</b> before {{we returned to the}} hotel; and the sentries on the ramparts were already looking for daybreak.|$|R
60|$|It was now wearing late. Old Janet {{got into}} some kind of kennel behind the hallan; Davie had been <b>long</b> <b>asleep</b> and snoring between Ban and Buscar. These dogs had {{followed}} him to the hut after the mansion-house was deserted, and there constantly resided; and their ferocity, with the old woman's reputation of being a witch, contributed a good deal to keep visitors from the glen. With this view, Bailie Macwheeble provided Janet underhand with meal for their maintenance, and also with little articles of luxury for his patron's use, in supplying which much precaution was necessarily used. After some compliments, the Baron occupied his usual couch, and Waverley reclined in an easy chair of tattered velvet, which had once garnished the state bed-room of Tully-Veolan (for the furniture of this mansion was now scattered through all the cottages in the vicinity), and went to sleep as comfortably {{as if he had been}} in a bed of down.|$|E
6000|$|Three months before, such direct {{intervention}} {{on the part}} of Germany would have passed almost without protest; but the hour was now gone by. Becker's conduct, equally timid and rash, equally inconclusive and offensive, had forced the other nations into a strong feeling of common interest with Mataafa. Even had the German demands been moderate, de Coetlogon could not have forgotten the night of the taumualua, nor how Mataafa had relinquished, at his request, the attack upon the German quarter. Blacklock, with his driver of a captain at his elbow, was not likely to lag behind. And Mataafa having communicated Knappe's letter, the example of the Germans was on all hands exactly followed; the consuls hastened on board their respective war-ships, and these began to get up steam. About midnight, in a pouring rain, Pelly communicated to Fritze his intention to follow him and protect British interests; and Knappe replied that he would come on board the Lizard and see de Coetlogon personally. It was deep in the small hours, and de Coetlogon had been <b>long</b> <b>asleep,</b> when he was wakened to receive his colleague; but he started up with an old soldier's readiness. The conference was long. De Coetlogon protested, as he did afterwards in writing, against Knappe's claim: the Samoans were in a state of war; they had territorial rights; it was monstrous to prevent them from entering one of their own villages because a German trader kept the store; and in case property suffered, a claim for compensation was the proper remedy. Knappe argued that this was a question between Germans and Samoans, in which de Coetlogon had nothing to see; and that he must protect German property according to his instructions. To which de Coetlogon replied that he was himself in the same attitude to the property of the British; that he understood Knappe to be intending hostilities against Laulii; that Laulii was mortgaged to the MacArthurs; that its crops were accordingly British property; and that, while he was ever willing to recognise the territorial rights of the Samoans, he must prevent that property from being molested [...] "by any other nation." [...] "But if a German man-of-war does it?" [...] asked Knappe.--"We shall prevent it {{to the best of our}} ability," [...] replied the colonel. It is to the credit of both men that this trying interview should have been conducted and concluded without heat; but Knappe must have returned to the Adler with darker anticipations.|$|E
60|$|Rock Ferry, August 29th.--Yesterday we {{all took}} a walk into the country. It was a fine afternoon, with clouds, of course, in {{different}} parts of the sky, but a clear atmosphere, bright sunshine, and altogether a Septembrish feeling. The ramble was very pleasant, along the hedge-lined roads in which there were flowers blooming, and the varnished holly, certainly one of the most beautiful shrubs in the world, so far as foliage goes. We saw one cottage which I suppose was several hundred years old. It was of stone, filled into a wooden frame, the black-oak of which was visible like an external skeleton; it had a thatched roof, and was whitewashed. We passed through a village,--higher Bebbington, I believe,--with narrow streets and mean houses all of brick or stone, and not standing wide apart from each other as in American country villages, but conjoined. There was an immense almshouse in the midst; at least, I took it to be so. In the centre of the village, too, we saw a moderate-sized brick house, built in imitation of a castle with a tower and turret, in which an upper and an under row of small cannon were mounted,--now green with moss. There were also battlements along the roof of the house, which looked as if it might have been built eighty or a hundred years ago. In the centre of it there was the dial of a clock, but the inner machinery had been removed, and the hands, hanging listlessly, moved to and fro in the wind. It was quite a novel symbol of decay and neglect. On the wall, close to the street, there were certain eccentric inscriptions cut into slabs of stone, but I could make no sense of them. At the end of the house opposite the turret, we peeped through the bars of an iron gate and beheld a little paved court-yard, and at the farther side of it a small piazza, beneath which seemed to stand the figure of a man. He appeared well advanced in years, and was dressed in a blue coat and buff breeches, with a white or straw hat on his head. Behold, too, in a kennel beside the porch, a large dog sitting on his hind legs, chained! Also, close beside the gateway, another man, seated in a kind of arbor! All these were wooden images; and the whole castellated, small, village-dwelling, with the inscriptions and the queer statuary, was probably the whim of some half-crazy person, who has now, no doubt, been <b>long</b> <b>asleep</b> in Bebbington churchyard.|$|E

My heart is touched now, by many remembrances that had <b>long</b> fallen <b>asleep,</b> of my pretty young mother (and I so old!), and by many {{associations}} of the days when what we call the World was not so real with me, and my faults were not confirmed in me." ...|$|R
60|$|All was pitch dark {{inside the}} cabin. The women had {{water and food}} at hand. Jean kept a sharp lookout from his window while he ate his supper of meat, bread, and milk.

50|$|Gromth is {{the brainchild}} of Grimd, which small ideas came to his head back in the early ninetees. He joined Khold in 2003 and played a lot of concerts during a quite busy period for the band. In mid 2000 he decided to write music for this <b>long</b> <b>asleep</b> project named Gromth in a more serious matter, and he {{contacted}} vocalist Ole and drummer Tjodalv to help him out with matters he couldn’t fix himself. Ole quickly surprised everyone with his original grim throath, {{as a matter of fact}} he had never been in a band as a vocalist before. Tjodalv started Dimmu Borgir together with Silenoz and Shagrath back in the early ninetees. In 1999 he left Dimmu Borgir and started Susperia with Cyrus. Beside Gromth he also perform the battery in Black Comedy. In Gromth a lot of material and recording was created during the years 2006-2008, but unfortunately a computer crash in Grimds homestudio deleted much material. After a small break he decided to start anew with new music equipment and totally new song material. In spring 2010 he decided to share the composing process with keyboarder Andre, and soon Gromth had enough material for the long awaited first full-length album.|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Archibald {{retired to}} her cabin, {{but she did}} not feel in the least like going to bed. Her husband had <b>long</b> been <b>asleep</b> in his cot, and she still sat {{by the side of the}} little window looking out upon the moon-lighted scene; but the beauty of the night, if she noticed it at all, gave her no pleasure. Her mind was harassed and troubled by many things, chief among which was her husband's {{unfinished}} sentence in which he had said that he would try to avoid any unpleasantness, but at the same time had intimated that if the unpleasant thing were forced upon him he was ready to meet it.|$|R
60|$|It was Paul who {{uttered the}} remark.

60|$|So, {{as he had}} {{declared}} to himself his intention, that night, when little Pansie had <b>long</b> been <b>asleep,</b> and his small household was in bed, {{and most of the}} quiet, old-fashioned townsfolk likewise, this good apothecary went into his laboratory, and took out of a cupboard in the wall a certain ancient-looking bottle, which was cased over with a net-work of what seemed to be woven silver, like the wicker-woven bottles of our days. He had previously provided a goblet of pure water. Before opening the bottle, however, he seemed to hesitate, and pondered and babbled to himself; having long since come to that period of life when the bodily frame, having lost much of its value, is more tenderly cared for than when it was a perfect and inestimable machine.|$|R
60|$|Hotel de l'Europe, June 1st.--I {{remember}} nothing {{very special}} to record about Marseilles; {{though it was}} really like passing from death into life, to find ourselves in busy, cheerful, effervescing France, after living so <b>long</b> between <b>asleep</b> and awake in sluggish Italy. Marseilles {{is a very interesting}} and entertaining town, with its bold surrounding heights, its wide streets,--so they seemed to us after the Roman alleys,--its squares, shady with trees, its diversified population of sailors, citizens, Orientals, and what not; but I have no spirit for description any longer; being tired of seeing things, and still more of telling myself about them. Only a young traveller can have patience to write his travels. The newest things, nowadays, have a familiarity to my eyes; whereas in their lost sense of novelty lies the charm and power of description.|$|R
60|$|Tuesday {{passed without}} event. Tuesday night Josie {{was at her}} post again, her {{eyes fixed on the}} dim light that shone from Mr. Cragg's room. Had she been able to see through the walls of the cottage she would have found the old man seated in his private {{apartment}} opposite his daughter. Could she have heard their conversation--the low, continuous hum of Old Swallowtail's voice, broken only by an occasional question from Nan--she would surely have been astonished. Nan was not much astonished, save at the fact that her father had at last voluntarily confided to her the strange story of his life, a life hitherto unknown to her. She was not easily surprised, but she was greatly impressed, and when he finally rose from his chair and went out into the night Nan sat in meditation for some time before she followed him. Ingua had <b>long</b> been <b>asleep.</b>|$|R
60|$|Zella {{was both}} {{astonished}} and grieved by the disrespectful {{words of the}} goat, for she had quite enjoyed Rinkitink's singing and had been taught a proper respect for Kings and those high in authority. But as it was now getting late they {{decided to go to}} sleep, that they might rise early the following morning, so they all reclined upon the bottom of the big boat and covered themselves with blankets which they found stored underneath the seats for just such occasions. They were not <b>long</b> in falling <b>asleep</b> and did not waken until daybreak.|$|R

60|$|There was scarce a {{score of}} persons in the Cathedral beside the Dean {{and some of his}} clergy, and the choristers, young and old, that {{performed}} the beautiful evening prayer. But Mr. Tusher was one of the officiants, and read from the eagle in an authoritative voice, and a great black periwig; and in the stalls, still in her black widow's hood, sat Esmond's dear mistress, her son by her side, very much grown, and indeed a noble-looking youth, with his mother's eyes, and his father's curling brown hair, that fell over his point de Venise--a pretty picture such as Van Dyck might have painted. Mons. Rigaud's portrait of my Lord Viscount, done at Paris afterwards, gives but a French version of his manly, frank, English face. When he looked up there were two sapphire beams out of his eyes such as no painter's palette has the color to match, I think. On this day there was not much chance of seeing that particular beauty of my young lord's countenance; for the truth is, he kept his eyes shut for the most part, and, the anthem being rather <b>long,</b> was <b>asleep.</b>|$|R
6000|$|The nobleman {{who held}} this office chanced to be {{particularly}} connected with Sir George Staunton, {{and it was in}} his train that he ventured to tread the High Street of Edinburgh {{for the first time since}} the fatal night of Porteous's execution. Walking at the right hand of the representative of Sovereignty, covered with lace and embroidery, and with all the paraphernalia of wealth and rank, the handsome though wasted figure of the English stranger attracted all eyes. Who could have recognised in a form so aristocratic the plebeian convict, that, disguised in the rags of Madge Wildfire, had led the formidable rioters to their destined revenge? There was no possibility that this could happen, even if any of his ancient acquaintances, a race of men whose lives are so brief, had happened to survive the span commonly allotted to evil-doers. Besides, the whole affair had <b>long</b> fallen <b>asleep,</b> with the angry passions in which it originated. Nothing is more certain than that persons known to have had a share in that formidable riot, and to have fled from Scotland on that account, had made money abroad, returned to enjoy it in their native country, and lived and died undisturbed by the law.* ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} associations between time use in daily activities and sociodemographic and clinical factors in order to identify individuals with persistent mental illness at risk of having an imbalance in daily activities, as reflected in their time use and daily rhythm. Participants (n= 103) were selected from a psychiatric outpatient unit using a randomized stratified selection procedure. The main findings indicated that time spent in daily activities increased with age, and that older individuals more often had a beneficial daily rhythm. Women and individuals living with children spent more time on self-care/self-maintenance than men and individuals living without children. Individuals with a diagnosis of psychosis spent less total time in daily activities than individuals with non-psychosis. In conclusion, general psychiatric symptoms, such as self-blame, anxiety, and difficulties in cooperating with others, explained most of the risk of spending little time in work/education as well as the risk of spending <b>long</b> periods <b>asleep</b> and having an adverse daily rhythm. A diagnosis of psychosis and high levels of general symptoms together explained most of the risk of having low total time use in activity. Factors such as age and living with children or not seemed to be important factors in relation to time use and daily rhythm...|$|R
60|$|Rachel made no answer, for she {{saw that}} talking was useless in such a case. Only she took Noie's hand and pressed it in silent sympathy, until at length the poor girl, utterly outworn with agony and the fatigue of her <b>long</b> flight, fell <b>asleep,</b> there in the sunshine. Rachel let her sleep, knowing that she would take no harm in that warmth. Quietly she sat at her side for hour after hour while the fierce sun, from which she {{protected}} her head with seaweed, dried her garments. At length the shadows told her that midday was past, and the sea water which began to trickle over the surrounding rocks that the tide was approaching its full.

60|$|Deeming the {{impending}} action no affair of his, as {{indeed it was}} not, and indifferent to the activity with which Bridgewater was that night agog, Mr. Blood closed his ears {{to the sounds of}} it, and went early to bed. He was peacefully <b>asleep</b> <b>long</b> before eleven o'clock, at which hour, as you know, Monmouth rode but with his rebel host along the Bristol Road, circuitously to avoid the marshland that lay directly between himself and the Royal Army. You also know that his numerical advantage--possibly counter-balanced by the greater steadiness of the regular troops on the other side--and the advantages he derived from falling by surprise upon an army that was more or less asleep, were all lost to him by blundering and bad leadership before ever he was at grips with Feversham.|$|R

He is confronted by Tim who forces him into a portable toilet, locks him in, then tips it over, leaving him trapped there {{in the heat of}} a Florida summer day to die. With no way to get help, Curtis must figure out how to escape or die. Eventually, after a <b>long</b> night <b>asleep</b> in the Port-O-San, Curtis discovers he can crawl through the toilet and into the tank where he can unscrew the bolts using Betsy's old dog tag. After a brief struggle, he gets out and makes his way to the house of Tim, who is lounging in his hot tub. Curtis surprises Tim by throwing an old, unplugged hair dryer into the tub. He then jumps into the hot tub with him, letting him know that, not only is he alive, but if Tim ever tells anyone, Curtis will simply tell them Tim tried to kill him first. Two days later Curtis hears a gunshot from Tim's house and figures Tim killed himself, but he continues to work. He then tells his maid he is thinking of getting a new dog.|$|R
