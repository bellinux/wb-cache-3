5000|$|During World War I, Britain and the Netherlands {{controlled}} 98% of the {{raw materials}} necessary {{for the production of}} rubber. In 1922, the Rubber Restriction Act was passed in Britain, increasing the cost of rubber. Then, in 1926, Mr. Harvey S. Firestone (a tyre company owner) obtained a 99-year lease for 4% of the country’s territory in exchange for a $5 million loan. This ensured the nation's rapid growth in the world natural rubber market in World War II. The 12,000 Liberian employees were paid low wages, because the Liberian government felt that [...] "men with money in their pockets would eventually have demanded the ballot". [...] Firestone gave Charles Taylor, the warlord who caused the deaths of 300,000 <b>Liberians,</b> millions of <b>dollars</b> to secure the future of the firm's plantations, but production was still stopped for 6 years from 1990.|$|R

50|$|The {{national}} currency, the <b>Liberian</b> <b>dollar,</b> {{collapsed in}} 1907. The country was later forced {{to adopt the}} United States Dollar. The Liberian government was constantly dependent on foreign loans at high rates of exchange, which endangered the country's independence.|$|E

Liberia changed to the U.S. dollar in 1943. Togo and Cameroon adopted the West African currency in 1914 and 1916 respectively, when British and French troops took over those colonies from Germany as part of World War I.|$|E

GDP per capita peaked in 1980 at US$496, when it was comparable to Egypt's (at the time). In 2011, the country's nominal GDP was US$1.154 billion, while nominal GDP per capita stood at US$297, the third-lowest in the world. Historically, the Liberian economy has depended heavily on foreign aid, foreign direct investment and exports of natural resources such as iron ore, rubber and timber.|$|E

In 1938 he became general manager of the Bank of Monrovia in Liberia, during which time he was responsible for changing the country's currency from the British West African pound (pegged to the Pound Sterling) to the <b>Liberian</b> <b>dollar</b> (pegged to the US dollar). [...] The Smithsonian Institution's 1940 National Zoological Park expedition to Monrovia met with Blowers and he presented his household pets, a red forest duiker, a civet cat and a linsang, to them for use as zoo exhibits. [...] British Foreign Office staff writing to Anthony Eden in March 1942 noted that Blowers adhered strictly to the American policy of neutrality, opposing attempts to enforce British control of capital in Liberia. [...] Blowers, who could speak German, was known to have transferred German funds through Liberia to the United States.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} on exchange rate regime choice {{in developing countries}} has revealed that a range of factors, from weak fiscal institutions to the inability to borrow in their own currencies, limits the range of options available to them. This paper uses the case of Liberia to illustrate that new states in Africa during the gold standard era faced similar limitations, {{even in the absence}} of formal colonial rule. The rapid depreciation of the <b>Liberian</b> <b>dollar</b> in the nineteenth century led to the adoption of sterling as a medium of exchange and store of value. This initially made it easier for Liberia to service its sterling-denominated debt and for Liberians to purchase imports from Britain. However, as economic relations with the United States deepened during the twentieth century, instability in the pound-dollar exchange rate created serious dislocations in the Liberian economy, ultimately leading the official adoption of the U. S. dollar in 1943. The story of Liberia illustrates the long-standing challenges of globalization for peripheral economies and suggests the need for a reassessment of the origins and impact of colonial monetary regimes...|$|E
