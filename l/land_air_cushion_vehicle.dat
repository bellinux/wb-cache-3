40|$|Thesis: With {{the current}} {{emphasis}} on reducing defense budgets {{and a smaller}} military force improved through enhancements and selected modernizations, perhaps the Department of the Navy should pursue <b>Landing</b> Craft <b>Air</b> <b>Cushion</b> (LCAC) <b>vehicle</b> retirement and Landing Craft Utility (LCU) enhancement. Discussion: In 1992, the Department of the Navy shifted its strategic focus away from a global threat to the challenges and opportunities posed by regional events. The new strategy emphasized power projection and employment of naval forces from the sea into the littoral regions of the world. It was later updated to expand the role of naval forces further across the spectrum of conflict to include peacetime operations, crisis response, and regional conflicts. This expansion coincided with an era of declining defense budgets resulting in a smaller, restructured force frilly prepared for {{the challenges of the}} new era. The concepts of stealth, mobility, and over-the-horizon warfare transitioned from the era of "blue-water " naval warfare to a new era of "brown-water " naval warfare. Additionally, the Marine Corps warfighting philosophy of maneuver warfare now emphasizes those concepts in "Operational Maneuver From the Sea (OMFTS) " and "ship-to-objective " maneuver, but at what cost? The traditional ship-to-shore maneuver with conventional landing craft has served as doctrine fo...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedMore than 80 percent of recent, real world, naval operations {{have taken place}} in the littoral; over half have employed amphibious units. However, up till now, no simulation developed at the Naval Postgraduate School had the capability to exercise any type of naval amphibious operation. Previous simulations lacked the necessary amphibious ship and landing craft models. Second, a method for nesting mounted entities did not exist. The approach taken was to develop a general algorithm for dynamically mounting, unmounting and nesting entities. Secondly, amphibious ship and landing craft models were developed incorporating a simple hydrodynamic models for use with the LPD- 17 and <b>Landing</b> Craft <b>Air</b> <b>Cushion</b> (LCAC) <b>vehicles.</b> Finally, real time collision detection was implemented to ensure realistic interaction between all entities. The result is a stand alone, 3 -D, virtual environment (VE) which simulates landing craft embarkation operations between a mother ship (LPD- 17 class) and an LCAC, and allows embarked entities to walk through the 50, 000 polygon LPD model in real time (7 - 15 frames per second). The simulation is further enhanced by realistic wave response, based on the Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum, by all ocean borne vehicles. Lastly, the use of the high level EasyScene 3. 0 API allowed the application to be written in approximately 30 percent few lines of code than otherwise possible[URL] United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} our {{investigation}} {{was to determine if}} personality testing and a five-factor model could improve the selection of <b>Landing</b> Craft <b>Air</b> <b>Cushion</b> (LCAC) <b>vehicle</b> operators. Vehicle operators for the LCAC are currently {{selected on the basis of}} their performance on a computer-based psychomotor selection system. The various psychomotor tests in the selection system have demonstrated predictive validity in LCAC crew training. Certain personality characteristics may also be involved in the LCAC vehicle operator training success. In fact, various researchers have found that personality testing may improve the selection of Navy/Marine Corps aviators. There is increasing evidence that a five-factor model may be useful in describing the personality characteristics involved in training success. We believe that a five-factor model may improve the selection system used for LCAC vehicle operators. A principal component analysis with varimax rotation was conducted to determine the underlying structure of the Adult Personality Inventory (API) with 168 LCAC crew candidates. The resulting factor scores were then entered into a series of hierarchical multiple regression analyses to determine the relation of the personality factor scores and the performance-based test to an underway grade in training criterion. The results indicated that one personality factor, openness, significantly improved predictions of the criterion (p < 0. 05). Based on these results, we believe that personality testing may improve the selection of LCAC vehicle operators...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a current}} {{need for the}} {{development}} of new computational tools to model the seakeeping performance of <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> <b>vehicles</b> in support of the US Navy’s <b>Landing</b> Craft <b>Air</b> <b>Cushion</b> (LCAC) Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) and possibly {{the development of a new}} connector as part of the Joint Maritime Assault Connector (JMAC) program. Much of the existing simulation capability for <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> <b>vehicles</b> was developed in the 1960 ’s, 1970 ’s and 1980 ’s to support the design of the LCAC and are coefficient-based models derived from small-scale experiments. The general utility of these simulations is limited in the design of new <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> <b>vehicles,</b> especially for innovative concepts or new components for increased performance capability. Advances in computing power and algorithms for free surface flows have made possible the development of new simulation tools to quantitatively assess design modifications and complement model tests of <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> <b>vehicles.</b> In this paper we describe the formulation, implementation and verification of a new computational model, called ACVSIM, to simulate the dynamics of <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> <b>vehicles</b> operating in waves. The primary components of ACVSIM include a high-order Rankine panel method for the hydrodynamic solution, an immersed boundary model for the solution of the <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> dynamics, and a structural dynamics model of the bag-and-finger skirt system.
