50|$|Most fishes bend as a simple, {{homogenous}} beam during swimming via contractions of longitudinal red {{muscle fibers}} and obliquely oriented white muscle fibers within the segmented axial musculature. The fiber strain (εf) {{experienced by the}} longitudinal red muscle fibers {{is equivalent to the}} longitudinal strain (εx). The deeper white muscle fibers fishes show diversity in arrangement. These fibers are organized into cone-shaped structures and attach to connective tissue sheets known as myosepta; each fiber shows a characteristic dorsoventral (α) and mediolateral (φ) trajectory. The segmented architecture theory predicts that, εx > εf. This phenomenon results in an architectural gear ratio, determined as longitudinal strain divided by fiber strain (εx / εf), greater than one and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>velocity</b> amplification; furthermore, this emergent velocity amplification may be augmented by variable architectural gearing via mesolateral and dorsoventral shape changes, a pattern seen in pennate muscle contractions. A red-to-white gearing ratio (red εf / white εf) captures the combined effect of the longitudinal red muscle fiber and oblique white muscle fiber strains.|$|E
50|$|At {{the next}} level of approximation, as the {{particle}} orbits and moves along the field line, along which the field changes slowly, the radius of the orbit changes so as to keep the magnetic flux enclosed by the orbit constant. Since the Lorentz force is strictly perpendicular to the velocity, it cannot change the energy of a charged particle moving in it. Thus the particle's kinetic energy remains constant. Then so also must its speed be constant. Then it can be shown that the particle's velocity parallel to the local field must decrease if the field is increasing along its z motion, and increase if the field decreases, while the components of the velocity transverse to the field increase or decrease so as to keep the magnitude of the total velocity constant. Conservation of energy prevents the transverse velocity from increasing without limit, and eventually the longitudinal component of the velocity becomes zero, while the pitch angle, of the particle with respect to the field line, becomes 90°. Then the longitudinal motion is stopped and reversed, and the particle is reflected back towards regions of weaker field, the guiding center now retracing its previous motion along the field line, with the particle's transverse velocity decreasing and its <b>longitudinal</b> <b>velocity</b> increasing.|$|E

The longitudinal slip of a tyre is often determined using three independent measurements namely the rotational velocity, tyre rolling radius and vehicle speed.

During annealing, the ultrasound velocity behaves in a peculiar way, first decreasing and then increasing {{to a final}} value. The recrystallized fraction evaluated by metallography indicates that recrystallization occurs during both the decrease {{and the increase in}} <b>longitudinal</b> <b>velocity.</b> Texture evaluated using laser ultrasonics suggests that the peculiar behavior of the velocity might be due to two different regimes of texture evolution. Internal friction, investigated through ultrasound absorption measurements, is also revealed to be very sensitive to the annealing process.
