40|$|An {{integrated}} graph-theoretic and geometric {{approach to}} the analysis of aqueous solvation of atomic ions is presented. This analysis makes use of a novel data-mining tool, moleculaRnetworks, to process data from molecular dynamics simulations. The workings and structure of this tool are discussed, along with the development and testing of its PageRank algorithm-based rapid solvation polyhedra classifier. The ability to classify instantaneous solvation polyhedra enables a finely detailed understanding of shell structure-behavior relationships, as water molecules simultaneously rearrange about ions, exchange with the bulk, and rearrange their hydrogen-bond network. The application of the tool to cation systems, including lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, and lanthanum, yields new insight into the mechanisms of water exchange about these ions. It is shown that in order for exchange events to occur, the solvation shell must "preorganize" to admit or expel a molecule of water: this preorganization is reflected in the mechanistic preference for each ion. The application of the tool to anion systems, including fluoride, chloride, and bromide, reveals that these ions have an extended effect on the reorientation ability of water molecules beyond their first solvation shell. Finally, when both ions are present, as in the potential of mean force simulation between <b>lanthanum</b> and <b>chloride,</b> structural rearrangements {{can be seen as the}} ions break through the barrier to form the contact ion pair.

40|$|Human corneal endothelial cells (HCEC) {{maintain}} appropriate tissue hydration {{and transparency}} by eliciting net ion transport coupled to fluid egress from the stroma into the anterior chamber. Such activity offsets tissue swelling caused by stromal imbibition of fluid. As corneal endothelial (HCE) transport function is modulated by temperature changes, we probed for thermosensitive transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM 8) functional activity in immortalized human corneal endothelial cells (HCEC- 12) and freshly isolated human corneal endothelial cells (HCEC) as a control. This channel is either activated upon lowering to 28  °C or by menthol, eucalyptol and icilin. RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) verified TRPM 8 gene expression. Ca(2 +) transients induced by either menthol (500  μmol/l), eucalyptol (3  mmol/l), or icilin (2 - 60  μmol/l) were identified using cell fluorescence imaging.

The results suggest that, for a period of at least up to 48 h after passive avoidance training, the activation of memory retrieval by a reminder stimulus may lead to processes which are sensitive to inhibition by the calcium channel antagonist <b>lanthanum</b> <b>chloride.</b> These results extend previously reported findings implicating the involvement of glutamate-sensitive channels in a transient memory process that is also activated as a result of a reminder stimulus, but that is no longer present 48 h after training.

Because mercury (II) ions form strong complexes with phosphor compounds, the formation of metallic mercury vapor requires the presence of <b>lanthanum</b> <b>chloride</b> as a release agent. Thiourea increases the amount of mercury that is extracted from the solid sample to the liquid phase of the slurry. The method is established using two steps.
