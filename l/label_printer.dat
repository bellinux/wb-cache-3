50|$|A <b>label</b> <b>printer</b> is a {{computer}} printer that prints on self-adhesive label material and/or card-stock (tags). A <b>label</b> <b>printer</b> with built-in keyboard and display for stand-alone use (not connected to a separate computer) is often called a label maker. Label printers are different from ordinary printers because {{they need to have}} special feed mechanisms to handle rolled stock, or tear sheet (fanfold) stock. Common connectivity for label printers include RS-232 serial, Universal Serial Bus (USB), parallel, Ethernet and various kinds of wireless. Label printers have a wide variety of applications, including supply chain management, retail price marking, packaging labels, blood and laboratory specimen marking, and fixed assets management.|$|E
50|$|RFID {{readers are}} {{specialized}} <b>label</b> <b>printers</b> that print and encode {{at the same}} time on RFID transponders (tags) enclosed in paper or printable synthetic materials.

5000|$|Later, the Zebra Basic Interpreter (ZBI) was {{integrated}} into printer software, which {{is seen as}} an advancement to ZPL II by the producer and is ANSI BASIC oriented. Primarily, it is intended to avoid a refactoring of code when changing the printer, if the old printer software was written by a <b>label</b> <b>printer</b> of a competitor. With ZBI, it should be possible that the Zebra printer gets an [...] "alien" [...] data format and converts it to the requested ZPL II format automatically.|$|E
50|$|Labels may be {{supplied}} separately or {{on a roll}} or sheet. Many labels are pre-printed by the manufacturer. Others have printing applied manually or automatically {{at the time of}} application. Specialized high speed <b>label</b> <b>printer</b> applicators may be used to apply labels to packages; these and other methods may be subject to recognized standards. Some labels have protective overcoats, laminates, or tape to cover them after the final print is applied. This is sometimes before application and sometimes after. Labels are often difficult to peel and apply. A label dispenser can speed up this task.|$|E
5000|$|Thermal {{transfer}} {{for applications}} that cannot use thermal (thermal direct) label material because of heat source proximity or short label life, a more widely used material is the thermal transfer <b>label</b> <b>printer.</b> This material {{has the advantage}} of a much longer readable life and does not fade with time or heat. Most major manufacturers of thermal printers can be used for either thermal transfer (TT) or thermal (DT) labels. A thermal transfer ribbon will be required to print the labels. The cost of the ribbons + TT labels {{is similar to that of}} the DT labels on their own; ...|$|E

40|$|Our {{improved}} automated disc kiosks {{are designed}} with two purposes in mind: to improve the inventory management and agility of current automated media rental services and to simplify and consolidate the storage and distribution of installation media in an IT environment. The kiosks combine the ability to store and dispense optical discs (CDs, DVDs, Blu-Ray Discs, etc.) {{with the ability to}} burn newer content pushed out via a network connection from a company’s servers. Designed and built with commonly available components to minimize costs, the prototype consists of a Digilent Zybo FPGA board powered by a Xilinx processor. A tablet is used simply as a touchscreen monitor connected to the Zybo. A CD drive with burning capabilities, a <b>label</b> <b>printer,</b> and an external hard drive are all connected via USB. Finally, the internal mechanisms, including the various servos, are connected directly to the Zybo’s I/O ports. Rental companies can benefit from these kiosks by reducing or even eliminating the number of workers and vehicles needed to restock machines and redistribute existing inventory. Each kiosk can report its current inventory to a management system, through which licenses for new media may be purchased or re-assigned and a disc containing the content can be created by the kiosk. This means an end to running out of a certain movie or game. Demand and predictive algorithms will determine where media is distributed. Finally, older titles can be overwritten to make space for newer content, all without the need for a person to service each kiosk. IT departments throughout various industries still rely on disc media to install major systems and applications; our kiosks provide an easy way to maintain a catalog of software which is easily accessible and compatible with existing technologies. Employees no longer need to keep huge binders full of CDs, with duplicates between many. A central kiosk can store those discs and burn new ones from images, all in a single hassle-free device.

5000|$|Embossing tape is a {{labelling}} medium usually of hard plastic. Embossing tape is {{used with}} embossing machines, often handheld. The company name and trademark [...] "Dymo" [...] is {{often associated with}} this sort of label as their CEO Rudolph Hurwich first introduced it as a consumer product in 1958. Embossing tape have largely been replaced with thermal transfer printing tape used by <b>label</b> <b>printers.</b>|$|R
50|$|When {{printing}} on continuous label stock, {{there is}} a tendency for the print location to shift slightly from label to label. To ensure registration of the print area with the target media, many <b>label</b> <b>printers</b> use a sensor that detects a gap, notch, line or perforation between labels. This allows the printer to adjust the intake of label stock so that the print aligns correctly with the media.|$|R
2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the {{commercial}} popularity of typewriters in the 1970s, a number of hybrid designs combining features of printers were introduced. [...] These often incorporated keyboards from existing models of typewriters and printing mechanisms of dot-matrix printers. The generation of teleprinters with impact pin-based printing engines was not adequate for the demanding quality required for typed output, and alternative thermal transfer technologies used in thermal <b>label</b> <b>printers</b> had become technically feasible for typewriters.|$|R
