5|$|After its {{victory in}} the Seven Years' War (1756–1763), the British Empire was deeply in debt. <b>Looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>new</b> sources of revenue, the British Parliament sought, for the first time, to {{directly}} tax the colonies, beginning with the Sugar Act of 1764. The earlier Molasses Act of 1733, a tax on shipments from the West Indies, had produced hardly any revenue because it was widely bypassed by smuggling, which {{was seen as a}} victimless crime.|$|E

United. Kevin Payne, former President of Soccer USA Partners and current CEO of D.C. United, was instrumental in organizing this ownership group. By 1998 the group was <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>new</b> investors, and on February 15, 2001, it agreed to sell the team to Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG), founded by Colorado billionaire Philip Anschutz, with AEG exercising its option to become the sole investor-operator on January 8, 2002. AEG, who also own Major League Soccer's Los Angeles Galaxy and Houston Dynamo, ran the team until 2007.|$|E
5|$|In 1895 Bain first played {{competitive}} {{ice hockey}} when he answered a classified ad {{placed in a}} newspaper by the Winnipeg Victorias, who were <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>new</b> players. Though he played with a broken stick held together by wire, Bain made the team only five minutes into the tryout. Bain quickly became a star centre and leader for the Victorias. This was proven during a February 14, 1896 game against the Montreal Victorias for the Stanley Cup, the trophy for the national hockey championship in Canada. It was a 2–0 victory for Winnipeg that gave them the Cup. This victory {{marked the first time}} a team outside of Quebec had won the trophy. The team was greeted by a huge crowd at the Canadian Pacific Railway station when their train, decorated with hockey sticks and the Union Jack, returned to Winnipeg. They were led to a feast in their honour in a parade of open sleighs, where fans gathered to celebrate the championship.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, {{science fiction}} (sf) {{magazines}} {{had been published}} successfully in North America for over twenty years, but little progress {{had been made in}} establishing British equivalents. The bulk of British sf was published as paperback books, rather than magazines; a situation opposite of that in the US. Several short-lived magazines had come and gone, {{both before and after the}} war. John Spencer launched four very poor quality juvenile magazines in 1950, which continued into the mid-1950s, while one magazine, New Worlds, had survived since 1946. Since 1939, Atlas, a British publisher, had been producing a reprint edition of Astounding Science Fiction, one of the most well-regarded American sf magazines. During the war the contents had often been cut severely, and the schedule had not been regular, but it was reputed to sell 40,000 copies a month. This was enough to attract the attention of Hamilton & Co., a British publisher <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>new</b> markets.|$|E

5|$|The {{captaincy}} {{was given}} to Vic Richardson, Bradman's predecessor as South Australian captain. Cricket author Chris Harte's {{analysis of the situation}} is that a prior (unspecified) commercial agreement forced Bradman to remain in Australia. Harte attributed an ulterior motive to his relocation: the off-field behaviour of Richardson and other South Australian players had displeased the South Australia Cricket Association (SACA), which was <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>new</b> leadership. To help improve discipline, Bradman became a committeeman of the SACA, and a selector of the South Australian and Australian teams. He took his adopted state to its first Sheffield Shield title for 10years, Bradman weighing in with personal contributions of 233 against Queensland and 357 against Victoria. He finished the season with 369 (in 233minutes), a South Australian record, made against Tasmania. The bowler who dismissed him, Reginald Townley, would later become leader of the Tasmanian Liberal Party.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{served as}} {{chairman}} from 1955 to 1961; under him were three other selectors, who varied throughout his period as chairman, and the serving England captain. Among Allen's priorities were to promote attacking batsmanship, good fielding, and for the team to bowl overs more quickly. While <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>new</b> batting talent, Allen often promoted young amateur batsmen; several emerged in this period, including Ted Dexter and Colin Cowdrey, who had successful careers and {{were part of a}} strong English batting line-up. At least one member of the England team, Jim Laker, resented the preference of amateurs, whom he believed were paid more for playing than the professionals. Many professional cricketers thought that Allen was a snob who preferred to keep them in their place; critics believed that he deliberately restricted the career of Les Jackson for reasons of class. Allen also played the role of disciplinarian. Several of the England players enjoyed a hectic social life; it was often left to Allen to issue warnings when they transgressed. He played an active role in home Test matches, generally attending at least three of the five days of every game, discussing tactics with the captain, and speaking to the press. In his first season, Allen was involved in the appointment of a new captain; Len Hutton, the serving captain, retired from the team with injury. In his place, the selectors appointed May, who served until 1959 and again in 1961; he and Allen established a good working relationship. When May was absent from the team with illness during parts of 1960 and 1961, Cowdrey replaced him.|$|E
