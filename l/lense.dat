40|$|Gravitational <b>lensing</b> of photons in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) can be {{described}} by an integrated potential {{along the line of}} sight, the CMB <b>lensing</b> potential. Covariances in maps of the CMB are generated by the <b>lensing</b> effect, and are used to reconstruct the <b>lensing</b> potential itself, which is a useful probe of the matter distribution. The CMB <b>lensing</b> potential has been measured to high significance with CMB temperature data. However, signal to noise for <b>lensing</b> reconstruction from CMB polarization data is expected to be much better due to the presence of the <b>lensing</b> B-mode. Upcoming data from ground based CMB polarization instruments will provide high resolution maps over small patches of the sky. This will provide much better <b>lensing</b> reconstruction, but also presents data analysis challenges. This thesis begins with an introduction to the field of CMB <b>lensing</b> and CMB <b>lensing</b> reconstruction. The second chapter details the biases present in reconstructing the <b>lensing</b> potential from CMB polarization maps considering first the full sky, and then small patches of sky. It also shows that using the pure-B mode formalism for the CMB polarization leads to improved <b>lensing</b> reconstruction over the naive case on the cut sky. Given the upcoming improvement in the CMB <b>lensing</b> reconstruction, it is expected that cross-correlations of the CMB <b>lensing</b> with other structure tracers, such as galaxies, will yield improved information for cosmology. It is also expected that the CMB <b>lensing</b> will become useful to help constrain uncertainties in the galaxy power spectrum, and provide information on the linear galaxy bias and redshift distribution. The third chapter of the thesis forecasts the power of cross correlation science for a number of galactic and non-galactic parameters. Finally, the CMB <b>lensing</b> effects the level of non-Gaussianity observed in the CMB. The fourth chapter of the thesis is a study of the <b>lensing</b> effect on the primordial squeezed bispectrum. We conclude in the fifth chapter...|$|R
40|$|Observed CMB anisotropies are <b>lensed,</b> and the <b>lensed</b> power spectra can be {{calculated}} accurately assuming the <b>lensing</b> deflections are Gaussian. However, the <b>lensing</b> deflections are actually slightly non-Gaussian due to both non-linear large-scale structure growth and post-Born corrections. We calculate the leading correction to the <b>lensed</b> CMB power spectra from the non-Gaussianity, which {{is determined by the}} <b>lensing</b> bispectrum. The lowest-order result gives ∼ 0. 3 % corrections to the BB and EE polarization spectra on small-scales, however we show that the effect on EE is reduced by about a factor of two by higher-order Gaussian <b>lensing</b> smoothing, rendering the total effect safely negligible for the foreseeable future. We give a simple analytic model for the signal expected from skewness of the large-scale <b>lensing</b> field; the effect is similar to a net demagnification and hence a small change in acoustic scale (and therefore out of phase with the dominant <b>lensing</b> smoothing that predominantly affects the peaks and troughs of the power spectrum) ...|$|R
40|$|Gravitational <b>lensing</b> of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) {{measures}} all {{the matter}} {{content in the}} Universe. It {{can be used to}} constrain neutrino masses, calibrate biased tracers for large scale structure, and remove contamination of primordial B-modes. The theoretical framework, which includes simulations and reconstruction of gravitational <b>lensing</b> effects from CMB observations, has been established and applied through this dissertation. From observations of the CMB's temperature anisotropy, WMAP datasets are used to probe gravitational <b>lensing</b> effects. It is found that the <b>lensing</b> signal can not be directly detected from WMAP alone but can be indirectly detected at > 3 [sigma] if WMAP's CMB observations are cross-correlated with galaxy surveys. Other than the CMB temperature, the CMB polarization is of great importance because the CMB's polarization is more sensitive than its temperature to probing <b>lensing</b> effects. From the ground-based small-scale polarization experiment, POLARBEAR, we (for the first time) measure polarization <b>lensing</b> and <b>lensing</b> B-modes from different types of correlation functions. The B-mode power spectrum is measured, showing the evidence for <b>lensing</b> B-modes at the 2 [sigma] level. <b>Lensing</b> reconstruction with B-modes is also performed. From the auto-correlation of the <b>lensing</b> reconstruction with B-modes, the polarization <b>lensing</b> and <b>lensing</b> B-mode signal is measured at the 4. 2 [sigma] level, including systematics. This signal measures dark matter fluctuations with 27 % uncertainty. The matter structure seen in the <b>lensing</b> reconstruction is further validated by the cross-correlation with cosmic infrared background, which shows evidence for polarization <b>lensing</b> at 4 [sigma]. This state-of-the-art technique is capable of mapping all gravitating matter in the Universe, is sensitive to the sum of neutrino masses, and is essential for cleaning the <b>lensing</b> B-mode signal in searches for primordial gravitational wave...|$|R

40|$|The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) {{radiation}} <b>lensing</b> is {{a promising}} tool {{to study the}} physics of early universe. In this work we probe the imprints of deviations from isotropy and scale invariance of primordial curvature perturbation power spectrum on CMB <b>lensing</b> potential and convergence. Specifically, we consider a scale-dependent hemispherical asymmetry in primordial power spectrum. We show that the CMB <b>lensing</b> potential and convergence and also the cross-correlation of the CMB <b>lensing</b> and late time galaxy convergence can probe the amplitude and the scale dependence of the dipole modulation. As another example, we consider a primordial power spectrum with local feature. We show that the CMB <b>lensing</b> and the cross-correlation of the CMB <b>lensing</b> and galaxy <b>lensing</b> can probe the amplitude and {{the shape of the}} local feature. We show that the cross correlation of CMB <b>lensing</b> convergence and galaxy <b>lensing</b> is capable to probe the effects of local features in power spectrum on smaller scales than the CMB <b>lensing.</b> Finally we showed that the current data can constrain the amplitude and moment dependence of dipole asymmetry.

40|$|The {{gravitational}} <b>lensing</b> {{effect is}} important to the detection of electromagnetic signals in astrophysics. The gravitational wave <b>lensing</b> effect has also been found significant to gravitational wave detection in the past decade. Recent analysis shows that the <b>lensing</b> events for advanced detectors could be quite plausible. The black holes in our MilkyWay Galaxy may play the role of lens objects. These facts motivate us to study the <b>lensing</b> effects on gravitational wave signals for advanced detectors. Taking advanced LIGO and Einstein Telescope for examples, we investigate the <b>lensing</b> effects on the parameter extraction of gravitational wave signals. Using the Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation together with matched filtering methods, we find that the <b>lensing</b> effect for a lens object with small mass is negligible. But when the mass of the lens object increases to larger than 1000 M⊙ the <b>lensing</b> effect becomes important. Using the template without <b>lensing</b> corrections would result in loss of signal detections. In contrast if we consider templates with <b>lensing</b> effects, the <b>lensed</b> signal may provide much information about the lens black hole. These facts may give us a new way to determine the parameters of the <b>lensing</b> object. For example, this kind of signal may also help us estimate the mass and the distance of the supermassive black hole hosted at the center of our Galaxy...|$|R
