50|$|A tintype, {{also known}} as a melainotype or ferrotype, is a {{photograph}} made by creating a direct positive on a thin sheet of metal coated with a dark <b>lacquer</b> <b>or</b> <b>enamel</b> and used as the support for the photographic emulsion. Tintypes enjoyed their widest use during the 1860s and 1870s, but lesser use of the medium persisted into the early 20th century and it has been revived as a novelty in the 21st.|$|R

The tips of the star are capped by ball finials and enclosed in a raised silver edge with the field in red <b>lacquer</b> <b>or</b> <b>enamel.</b> A raised crescent, open at the top, encircles {{the center of the}} badge. Inside the crescent is the tughra or cipher of the decoration's creator, Sultan Mehmed Reshad V, over the date 1333 AH (AD 1915). The reverse is flat, unadorned and has a straight pin.|$|R
40|$|Bisphenol A (BPA) and {{bisphenol}} B (BPB) {{concentrations were}} determined in peeled canned tomatoes of different brands bought in Italian supermarkets. Tomato samples analyzed were packaged in cans coated with either epoxyphenolic <b>lacquer</b> <b>or</b> low BADGE <b>enamel.</b> A solid phase extraction (SPE) {{was performed on}} C- 18 Strata E cartridge followed by a step on Florisil cartridge. Detection and quantitation were performed by a reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method with both UV and fluorescence detection (FD). On the total of 42 tested tomato samples, BPA was detected in 22 samples (52. 4 %), while BPB was detected in 9 samples (21. 4 %). BPA and BPB were simultaneously present in 8 of the analyzed samples. The levels of BPA {{found in this study}} are much lower than the European Union migration limits of 3 mg/kg food and reasonably unable to produce a daily intake exceeding the limit of 0. 05 mg/kg body weight, established by European Food Safety Authority...|$|R
50|$|Black oxide for copper, {{sometimes}} {{known by}} the trade name Ebonol C, converts the copper surface to cupric oxide. For the process to work the surface has {{to have at least}} 65% copper; for copper surfaces that have less than 90% copper it must first be pretreated with an activating treatment. The finished coating is chemically stable and very adherent. It is stable up to 400 F; above this temperature the coating degrades due to oxidation of the base copper. To increase corrosion resistance, the surface may be oiled, <b>lacquered,</b> <b>or</b> waxed. It is also used as a pre-treatment for painting <b>or</b> <b>enamelling.</b> The surface finish is usually satin, but it can be turned glossy by coating in a clear high-gloss enamel.|$|R
50|$|Wooden {{baseboard}} can {{be available}} in untreated, <b>lacquered</b> <b>or</b> prepainted versions.

50|$|Consolidation is {{the process}} of {{stabilizing}} lifting and cracked areas of lacquer to minimize further damage and loss. Consolidants utilized can include Asian <b>lacquer</b> <b>or</b> other synthetic or organic adhesives such as animal glue or Paraloid B-72.

25|$|Prior {{to final}} assembly, the {{manufacturers}} usually apply a thin coating of clear <b>or</b> colored acrylic <b>lacquer</b> <b>or</b> silver plate over the brass. The <b>lacquer</b> <b>or</b> plating serves {{to protect the}} brass from oxidation and maintains its shiny appearance. Several different types and colors of surface finish have been used over the years. It is also possible to plate the instrument with nickel or gold, {{and a number of}} gold-plated saxophones have been produced. Plating saxophones with gold is an expensive process because gold does not adhere directly to brass. As a result, the brass is first plated with silver, then gold. Some saxophonists, sellers, and repair technicians argue that the type of <b>lacquer</b> <b>or</b> plating or absence thereof may enhance an instrument's tone quality. The possible effects of different finishes on tone are difficult to isolate from the other variables that affect an instrument's tone colors. In any case, what constitutes a pleasing tone is a matter of personal preference.|$|R
40|$|Nail {{specimens}} {{are being}} submitted with increased frequency to confirm {{a diagnosis of}} onychomycosis, diagnose an inflammatory dermatosis, or identify clues to an underlying neoplasm. Samples often {{are associated with a}} variety of lacquers (aka polish, varnish, <b>enamel)</b> <b>or</b> gels that may vary in their appearance. Some <b>lacquers</b> <b>or</b> gel polishes add challenges to maintaining an even plane of sectioning, obscure underlying findings, or separate from the nail in processing and be misinterpreted as terra firma. We review the histologic appearance of common lacquers and gel polishes so that dermatopathologists recognize these different presentations in clinical practice...|$|R
