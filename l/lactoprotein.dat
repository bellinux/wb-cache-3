40|$|Mandatory {{component}} of burn disease treatment is detoxification therapy: intravenous infusion of medicines with rheological and antishock effects. The {{objective of the}} research was to establish morphological signs of damage and compensatory-adaptive changes in rat spleen on the 14 th, 21 st and 30 th days after II–III degree skin burn and manifestations of damage correction resulting {{from the use of}} integrated infusions of colloid-hyperosmolar solutions of <b>lactoprotein</b> in combination  with sorbitol. Material and methods. Experimental studies of burn injury were made on 56 nonlinear rats of both sexes weighing 150 - 170 g. Group I (the control group - 8 animals) included rats without burns receiving intravenous infusion of a 0. 9 % NaCl solution at a dose of 10 ml/kg into inferior vena cava for 5 - 6 minutes. Group II (24 animals) included rats with skin burns receiving intravenous infusion of a 0. 9 % NaCl solution at a dose of 10 ml/kg into inferior vena cava for 5 - 6 minutes. Group III (24 animals) included rats with skin burns receiving intravenous infusion of a solution of <b>lactoprotein</b> in combination with sorbitol at a dose of 10 ml/kg into inferior vena cava for 5 - 6 minutes. Results. During the pilot study it was proved that in rats with skin burn injury, which were injected with a solution of <b>lactoprotein</b> in combination with sorbitol, dystrophic and destructive changes in the spleen were less expressed compared to rats injected with a 0. 9 % NaCl solution. Conclusions. <b>Lactoprotein</b> in combination with sorbitol in case of thermal injury manifests adaptogenic properties of increasing pathogenicity of both extended periarterial areas and boundary zones; multiplication and hypertrophy of reticular cells...|$|E
40|$|Milk protein genetic {{variability}} {{has been}} extensively investigated in cattle, both at protein and DNA levels, to analyse possible relationships with quantitative and qualitative milk traits and in evolutionary and biodiversity studies. At the protein level, isoelectrofocusing (IEF) technique is a cheap and powerful tool for the simultaneous detection of different milk protein loci and alleles. Several <b>lactoprotein</b> variants, and in particular rare alleles, were identified by IEF (Erhardt., 1993; Erhardt, 1996; Ikonen et al., 1996; Erhardt et al., 1998). By using the entire casein haplotype, instead of single genotypes, we can obtain better estimates of the associations between casein variants and milk traits (Aleandri et al., 1990; Ikonen et al., 2001). IEF {{can be used to}} type the whole casein cluster [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|The genetic {{polymorphism}} {{of the structural}} loci of {{five of the six}} main <b>lactoproteins,</b> a-lactalbumin, (3 -lactoglobulin, a,l- (3 - and x-casein, was examined in Grey Alpine, Norica-Pinzgau, Aosta Black Pied, Aosta Red Pied, Piedmont and Chiana cattle breeds. The analysis is concerned with the gene frequencies at the five loci, the frequencies of the allelic combinations controlled by the genetic unit formed by the three casein loci, the linkage disequilibrium in this cluster of loci, the genetic distance between the populations and the heterozygosity. In recent years the disappearance of local livestock breeds has been the argument of international meetings ond conferences, where the causes of the reduction of the genetic variability and the reasons and methods for its conservation have been amply discussed. Emphasis has been laid upon the importance of investigating the geneti...|$|R
40|$|The hypothetically {{negative}} influence of {{food on the}} clinical activity of seropositive rheumatoid arthritis was studied using two types of artificial elementary food. One diet was allergen free, the other allergen restricted, containing only <b>lactoproteins</b> and yellow dyes. Ninety four patients entered the study, which lasted 12 weeks. During the second four week period they {{were randomly assigned to}} one of the two artificial foods. Comparison between baseline and subsequent periods showed only subjective improvements. No differences were seen between the clinical effects of the two tested diets. Nine patients (three in the allergen restricted group, six in the allergen free group) showed favourable responses, followed by marked disease exacerbation during rechallenge. Dietary manipulation also brought about changes in objective disease activity parameters in these patients. The existence of a subgroup of patients in whom food intolerance influences the activity of rheumatoid factor seropositive rheumatoid arthritis deserves serious consideration...|$|R
40|$|Colostrumis ‘the first milk {{secreted}} at {{the time}} of parturition, differing from the milk secreted later, by containing more lactalbumin and <b>lactoprotein,</b> and also being rich in antibodies that confer passive immunity to the newborn, also called “foremilk”. Human Colostrum (HC) and Bovine Colostrum (BC) are rich in protein, immunoglobulin, lactoferrin and growth factors. Recent studies suggest that colostrum components, immunoglobulin and growth factor benefits physically active personandin treatment of autoimmune disorders. It is used for the treatment {{of a wide variety of}} gastrointestinal conditions, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug–induced gut injury, H pylori infection, immune deficiency related diarrhea as well as infective diarrhea.

40|$|<b>Lactoprotein</b> clones {{have been}} {{isolated}} from a rat mammary gland recombinant library of cDNA plasmids. Clones p-Wp 52 and p-Wp 47 were shown by hybrid selection, in vitro translation, and immunoprecipitation {{to represent a}} cloned DNA sequence encoding rat whey phosphoprotein. We report here the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA insert of p-Wp 52 and shows that it encodes the complete whey phosphoprotein sequence. The encoded sequence shows a high content of half-cystine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and serine but an absence of tyrosine. The half-cystines appear in unique arrangements and are repeated in two domains of the protein. The second domain has striking similarities with the second domain of the red sea turtle protease inhibitor. Clone p-Wp 52 has allowed the study of expression of whey phosphoprotein mRNA during functional differentiation of rat mammary gland and in mammary tumors. The whey phosphoprotein mRNA is detected during midpregnancy and lactation in the rat mammary gland but is barely detected in mammary tumors in which other milk protein mRNAs are expressed. The whey phosphoprotein gene in these tumors is hypermethylated, correlating with the reduced expression of this gene...|$|E
40|$|Title of the paper: Estimating {{effective}} {{population size}} (Ne) from allele frequency changes in Bavarian Simmental (FV) and Tyrolean Grey (GV) cattle Frequencies of 10 to 16 alleles of blood group, hemo- and <b>lactoprotein</b> loci were estimated for FV in 1960, 1986 and 200, for GV in 1969, 1979 and 1998. Rates of inbreeding {{in the intervening}} periods and Ne`s were derived from Wahlund variances. The Ne`s for the two part periods of FV, spanning 2. 2 resp. 4. 1 generations, were 152 resp. 147, for the whole period of 6. 25 generation intervals 373. This {{is due to the}} opposing signs of the changes in the two part periods and it may reflect the large influence of a top sire on the gene pool in the first period and ensueing change to a FV gene reservoir similar to that in 1960. For GV the Ne`of the two part periods were 139 and 56, for the whole 97, roughly in agreement with the one expected from the two short periods. The lower Ne of the second part period agrees well with an estimate by the inbreeding increment in roughly the same time period...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The paper makes {{part from}} a complex {{research}} project on Romanian Grey Steppe, a unique breed {{in terms of}} biological and cultural-historical importance, {{on the verge of}} extinction and which has been included in a preservation programme of genetic resources from Romania. The study of genetic polymorphism of protean fractions, especially kappa-casein, and the genotype relations of these lactoproteins with some quantitative and qualitative features of milk yield represents a current theme and a novelty for this breed. In the estimation of the genetic parameters we used R. E. M. L. (Restricted Maximum Likelihood) method. The main <b>lactoprotein</b> from milk, kappa- casein (K-cz), characterized in the specialized literature as a feature having a high degree of hereditary transmission, behaves as such in the nucleus under study, a value also confirmed by the heritability coefficient (h 2 = 0. 57 %). We must mention the medium values for milk and fat quantity (h 2 = 0. 26, 0. 29 %) and the fat and protein percentage from milk having a high hereditary influence h 2 = 0. 71 - 0. 63 %. Correlations between kappa-casein and the milk quantity are negative and strong. Between kappa-casein and other qualitative features of milk (fat content 0. 58 - 0. 67 % and protein content 0. 77 - 0. 87 %), there are positive and very strong correlations. At the same time, between kappa-casein and β casein (β-cz), β lactoglobulin (βlg) respectively, correlations are positive having high values (0. 37 – 0. 45 %), indicating the same causes and determining factors for the two groups of features.

40|$|In {{the case}} of an allergy the immune system shows a disproportionately strong {{reaction}} to what are in fact harmless substances in the environment. Sometimes, they are food compo-nents, e. g. the protein in cow’s milk. This is called a cow’s milk allergy. In this case the suf-ferer’s immune system forms antibodies that react with the proteins in the cow’s milk. Even very small amounts of protein may trigger allergic reactions of this kind in the individuals affected. At the present time, there is no standard treatment for milk allergies. Patients must simply try and avoid the allergen, i. e. refrain from consuming lactoprotein-containing foods. Cow’s milk contains 30 - 35 gram proteins per litre. The main allergen is deemed to be the heat-stable protein, casein, which accounts for 80 % of the protein. Other proteins in cow’s milk with known allergenic action are, for instance, alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin. At the present time, little is known about how the proteins react to technological processing of milk like pasteurisation and homogenisation and whether they undergo any changes. Sci-entific statements differ as to whether these methods may increase or reduce the allergenic-ity of the lactoproteins. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has reviewed the scientific literature on this subject and identified a shortage of data. The goal of more exten-sive research should be to improve the data situation on the basis of which statements can then be made about whether technological processes can lead to a clinically relevant change in the allergenic potential of milk in humans. Not every milk intolerance is caused by an allergic reaction. Similar symptoms may manifest in {{the case of}} a lactose intolerance without the immune system reacting to the <b>lactoprotein.</b> The persons affected have an enzyme deficiency (lactase deficiency) which means that the lactose cannot be broken down in the gastrointestinal tract and leads to disorders there...|$|E
