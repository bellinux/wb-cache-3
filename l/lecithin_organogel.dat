40|$|The {{purpose of}} this review is to give detail insight of {{pluronic}} lecithin organogels (PLOs) as a topical and transdermal drug delivery system. Pluronic <b>lecithin</b> <b>organogel</b> is a microemulsion-based gel that has been effectively used by physicians and pharmacists to deliver hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs topically and transdermally across the stratum corneum. It is thermodynamically stable, viscoelastic, and biocompatible gel composed of phospholipids (lecithin), organic solvent, and polar solvent. Various types of therapeutic agents have been easily incorporated in PLO to improve their topical drug delivery. Pluronic <b>lecithin</b> <b>organogel</b> improves the topical administration of drug mainly because of desired drug partitioning, biphasic drug solubility, and the modification of skin barrier system by organogel components. Beside this, it shows low skin irritation, increases patient compliance, reduces side effects, avoids first pass metabolism, and increases efficiency of drug. In addition, PLO {{has been shown in}} vivo and in vitro to modulate the release and permeation of drugs applied transdermally. Thus, in future, it has wide range of applications and opportunities to experiment with various drugs in this type of drug delivery system...|$|E
40|$|Cutaneous {{administration}} {{represents a}} good strategy to treat skin diseases, avoiding side effects related to systemic administration. Apart from conventional therapy, {{based on the}} use of semi-solid formulation such as gel, ointments and creams, recently the use of specialized delivery systems based on lipid has been taken hold. This review provides an overview about the use of cubic phases, cubosomes and ethosomes, as lipid systems recently proposed to treat skin pathologies. In addition in the final part of the review cubic phases, cubosomes and ethosomes are compared to solid lipid nanoparticles and <b>lecithin</b> <b>organogel</b> with respect to their potential as delivery systems for cutaneous application. It has been reported that lipid nanosystems are able to dissolve and deliver active molecules in a controlled fashion, thereby improving their bioavailability and reducing side-effects. Particularly lipid matrixes are characterized by skin affinity and biocompatibility allowing their application on skin. Indeed, after cutaneous administration, the lipid matrix of cubic phases and cubosomes coalesces with the lipids of the stratum comeum and leads to the formation of a lipid depot from which the drug associated to the nanosystem can be released in the deeper skin strata in a controlled manner. Ethosomes are characterized by a malleable structure that promotes their interaction with skin, improving their potential as skin delivery systems with respect to liposomes. Also in the case of solid lipid nanoparticles it has been suggested a deep interaction between lipid matrix and skin strata that endorses sustained and prolonged drug release. Concerning <b>lecithin</b> <b>organogel,</b> the peculiar structure of this system, where lecithin exerts a penetration enhancer role, allows a deep interaction with skin strata, promoting the transdermal absorption of the encapsulated drugs...|$|E
40|$|Hydroquinone (HQ) {{is a drug}} {{reported}} to possess manifold biological activities. HQ is highly unstable into various topical vehicles, presenting low topical bioavailability and a relevant level of toxicity. The Pluronic® <b>Lecithin</b> <b>Organogel</b> (PLOme) is a phospholipidic microemulsion designed for transdermal purposes. The aim of this work was therefore to incorporate HQ into PLOme. We evaluated the stability, the kinetic profile and the antimicrobial activity of HQ- incorporated PLOme. No relevant pH variation was observed. Long-term stability test showed an HQ degradation {{which led to a}} short shelf life. HQ permeation rate obtained was lower from PLOme than from a gel matrix. Free and PLOme-encapsulated hydroquinone showed to have a great in vitro inhibitory potential against of S. aureus strains. The encapsulation of HQ due its unstable characteristics could be an alternative to optimize its therapeutic usage, and so further investigation is required on this pharmaceutical form before commercialization...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to formulate and evaluate the suitability of pluronic <b>lecithin</b> <b>organogels</b> containing flurbiprofen for topical application. Four formulations were developed using flurbiprofen, lecithin, Pluronic F 127, isopropyl palmitate, water, sorbic acid and potassium sorbate were coded as FL 1, FL 2, FL 3 and FL 4. All the formulations carried 30 % w/w of lecithin phase and 70 % w/w of Pluronic phase. The formulated organogels were evaluated for appearance and feel psychorheologically, in vitro diffusion study, drug content, viscosity and pH. Release of flurbiprofen from all formulations was monitored via dialysis membrane- 70 and Wistar rat skin as a semipermeable membrane into phosphate buffer saline (0. 2 M, pH 7. 4) using Keshary-Chien diffusion cell. The viscosities of different formulations were determined by using Brookfield Viscometer at 25 °.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this review is to give an insight into the {{considerable}} potential of <b>lecithin</b> <b>organogels</b> (LOs) in the applications meant for topical drug delivery. LOs are clear, thermodynamically stable, viscoelastic, and biocompatible jelly-like phases, chiefly composed of hydrated phospholipids and appropriate organic liquid. These systems are currently {{of interest to the}} pharmaceutical scientist because of their structural and functional benefits. Several therapeutic agents have been formulated as LOs for their facilitated transport through topical route (for dermal or transdermal effect), with some very encouraging results. The improved topical drug delivery has mainly been attributed to the biphasic drug solubility, the desired drug partitioning, and the modification of skin barrier function by the organogel components. Being thermodynamically stable, LOs are prepared by spontaneous emulsification and therefore posses prolonged shelf life. The utility of this novel matrix as a topical vehicle has further increased owing to its very low skin irritancy potential. Varied aspects of LOs viz formation, composition, phase behavior, and characterization have been elaborated, including a general discussion on the developmental background. Besides a comprehensive update on the topical applications of <b>lecithin</b> <b>organogels,</b> the review also includes a detailed account on the mechanistics of organogelling...|$|R
40|$|Among various nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs), ketorolac tromethamine {{has been}} widely used for post operative and emergency treatment of pain. However, it accompanies adverse side effects including gastrointestinal irritation when administered orally. Topical administration of ketorolac offers the advantage of enhanced drug delivery to the affected sites with a reduced incidence of gastrointestinal side effects. However, as skin is an exceptionally effective barrier to most chemicals, very few drugs can permeate it in amounts sufficient to deliver a therapeutic dose. Therefore, systems that make the skin locally more permeable and thereby enable transdermal delivery are of great interest. <b>Lecithin</b> <b>organogels</b> are an example of such systems in which solutions of lecithin in organic solvents can be transformed into transparent gels by addition of a critical amount of water. The main objective {{of this study was}} to investigate <b>lecithin</b> <b>organogels</b> as carriers for topical application of ketorolac tromethamine. In this research, phase studies were carried out to obtain the concentration of components for the existence range of organogel and the effect of these additives on release rate of ketorolac was also evaluated through the artificial membranes and guinea pig skin. As the lecithin concentration was increased from 40 to 50 and then 60 % w/w in formulations, a significant decrease in ketorolac release was obtained. A significant increase in drug release was also observed in formulations containing 6. 5 % w/w of ketorolac compared to those containing 1 % w/w of the drug. Increasing the water content of the organogels also resulted in an increase in ketorolac release. The optimum formulation of the organogel composed of 40 % lecithin, 60 % IPM containing 0. 6 % w/w of water and 6. 5 % w/w of ketorolac tromethamine showed the highest drug release rate. Moreover, the viscosity of the different formulations and their rheological behavior were also determined. All formulations showed a slight rheopexy behavior rheogram. It was found that increase in lecithin concentration resulted in an increase in the viscosity of the organogel. Overall, the results have suggested that ketorolac tromethamine could be incorporated with high concentrations into <b>lecithin</b> <b>organogels</b> which makes them interesting for use as a drug delivery vehicle for water soluble drugs...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work is to {{illustrate}} and discuss an application of rheo-NMR techniques {{in the investigation of}} the flow micro-morphology of a rheo-thinning fluid. The viscoelastic material is composed by weakly hydrated nonionic Wormlike Micelles (WM), stabilized by the biocompatible phospholipid in an organic solvent (<b>lecithin</b> <b>organogel).</b> By applying rheo-NMR techniques, such as micro-imaging and flow velocimetry in Couette flow, to lecithin organogels in the concentrated isotropic phase, a new phase nucleating inhomogeneously at the inner rotating cylinder showing periodic fluctuations in space in some cases, has been identified for applied shear rates within the isotropic-nematic stress plateau. On the other hand, evident slippage phenomena have been found in flow regimes consistent with a full shear-induced nematic state. Bulk rheometric investigations executed in oscillatory, steady state and transient mode have been finally carried out to bridge different flow micro-heterogeneities detected by rheo-NMR with a variety of mechanical responses manifested by lecithin WM...|$|E
40|$|Skin {{aging is}} an {{unavoidable}} aspect of human life. Premature skin aging {{can result from}} poor care, environmental pollutants, and ultraviolet radiation exposure. Wrinkles, lines, spots, uneven skin tone, and pigmentation are often indicators of skin aging. One cannot avoid aging but cosmetics and pharmaceutical approaches can minimize and delay the damage. Topical applications of biocompatible and biodegradable vehicles have been explored for delivering anti-aging compounds. <b>Lecithin</b> <b>organogel</b> (LO) is an effective vehicle for topical delivery of many bioactive agents used in aging treatment. Lecithin is cell component isolated from soya beans or eggs and purified to show excellent gelation in non-polar solvents when combined with water. LO can form a heat-stable, resistant to microbial growth, visco-elastic, optically transparent, and non-birefringent micellar system. It serves as an organic medium to enhance dermal permeation of poorly permeable drugs by effectively partitioning into the skin. Its ability to dissolve in hydrophilic {{as well as in}} lipophilic drugs makes it a dynamic vehicle, which can be explored as a carrier for anti-aging agents...|$|E
40|$|The use of transdermal {{medications}} in cats {{has become}} popular in veterinary medicine {{due to the}} ease of administration compared to oral medication. However, the research to support systemic absorption of drugs applied to the pinna after transdermal administration in cats is limited.

The two formulations of methimazole (10  mg) were applied to the inner stratum corneum of six pairs of feline ears. The receptor medium was sampled up to 30  h post-administration, and methimazole concentrations were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Histological examination of all ears was undertaken as small differences in the thickness of ear skin may have contributed to inter-individual differences in methimazole absorption between six cats.

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the use of}} <b>lecithin</b> <b>organogels</b> (LO) as versatile vehicles for percutaneous administration of methyl nicotinate (MN), fenretinide (4 HPR) and curcumin (CUR). LO are able to increase the solubility of poor water-soluble molecules {{probably due to the}} formation of a short-range hexagonal organization of the lecithin cylindrical reverse micelles. After six months from production, no phase separation and an almost absence of aggregates was observed. LO exhibited similar viscosities and rheological behaviour both in the absence and in the presence of drug. The in vitro drug diffusion from LO studied by Franz cell showed that higher viscous vehicles result in lower diffusion coefficient. The microscopic investigation of human skin displayed no significant alterations after treatment with LO and with PBS. In vivo topical activity on erythema after cutaneous application of LO showed that LO-MN induce a strong erythema, while LO-CUR inhibit skin erythema due to CUR anti-inflammatory activity. Tape-stripping experiments performed on skin after topical administration of LO showed a decrease in the amount of CUR in the stratum corneum after 1 hour from the occlusion. Shelf life stability studies demonstrated the higher stability of LO-HPR as compared to the others drugs...|$|R

It was observed thatas the lecithin concentration increased from 40 to 50 and then 60 % w/w in formulations, a significant decrease in KT release was obtained. A remarkable increase in the drug release was also observed in formulations containing 6. 5 % w/w of KT compared to those containing 1 % w/w of the drug. Increasing the water content of the organogels also resulted in an increase in KT release. The optimized formulation of the organogel composed of 40 % lecithin and 60 % IPM (containing 0. 6 % w/w of water and 6. 5 % w/w of KT) showed the highest drug release rate. Moreover, the viscosity of different formulations and their rheological behavior were also determined. All formulations showed a slightly rheopexic behavior. It was found that an increase in lecithin concentration resulted in an increase in the viscosity of the organogel.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} {{the production and}} characterization of monoolein aqueous dispersions (MAD) and <b>lecithin</b> <b>organogels</b> (ORG) as percutaneous delivery systems for curcumin (CUR). In particular, MAD stabilized by sodium cholate/poloxamer and w 0 3 ORG lipid carriers, both in the presence and absence of CUR, have been considered: MAD morphology and dimensional distribution have been investigated by Cryogenic Transmission Electron Microscopy (cryo-TEM) and Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (PCS), while the inner structure of MAD and ORG has been studied by X-ray scattering techniques. As a general result, CUR chemical stability {{has been found to}} be better controlled by MAD, probably because CUR is more protected in the case of CUR-MAD with respect to CUR-ORG. To investigate the performance of differently composed lipid formulations as CUR delivery system, in vitro studies, based on Franz cell and stratum corneum-epidermis (SCE) membranes, and in vivo studies, based on skin reflectance spectrophotometry and tape stripping, were then performed. The results indicated that ORG induces a rapid and intense initial penetration of CUR probably due to a strong interaction between the peculiar supramolecular aggregation structure of phospholipids in the vehicle and the lipids present in the stratum corneum. Conversely, CUR incorporated into MAD can be released in a controlled fashion possibly because of the formation of a CUR depot in the stratum corneum. In this respect ORG could be employed in pathologies requiring rapid CUR action, while MAD could be proposed for assuring a prolonged CUR activity...|$|R

Both poor water solubility and drug permeability have hindered the percutaneous absorption of silymarin. Formulation of silymarin into pluronic-lecithin organogel (PLO) basis for topical skin delivery is the main aim of this work. Six different PLO formulations were prepared containing various pluronic to lecithin ratios using two cosolvent systems of ethyl alcohol and dimethyl sulfoxide. Formulation 2 (20 % pluronic and 3 % lecithin) {{was found to be}} the optimal base for topical delivery of silymarin as it showed optimum pH, viscosity, drug content, and satisfactory in vitro silymarin permeation. The silymarin PLO formulation significantly relieved inflammatory symptoms of AD such as redness, swelling, and inflammation. These findings warrant the ability for application of these novel silymarin PLO formulations as a novel treatment for AD.

The prepared organogels were evaluated for its appearance, organoleptic characteristics, and feel upon application, homogeneity, occlusivenes, washability, pH, viscosity, spreadability, gel transition temperature of formulations. The formulations were also evaluated for drug content, in vitro drug diffusion properties and skin irritation testing. In vivo evaluation of formulations {{was carried out by}} hot plate and writhing test method, and finally the optimized formulation was subjected to stability studies. The developed formulations were easily washable, smooth in feel, and showed no clogging which indicate superior texture of system. Formulation, containing pluronic showed greater spreadability and higher drug diffusion rate as compared to pluronic free organogel. Drug content of organogel formulations was in the range of 94 – 97 %. The pH of the formulations was 6. 48 [*]±[*] 0. 5 and 6. 98 [*]±[*] 0. 1, reflecting no risk of skin irritation.

40|$|Vitamin A is {{essential}} for the growth, differentiation and function of epithelial tissue. Low serum retinol levels have been associated with an increased risk of malignant disease. Natural and synthetic retinoids are active in several types of premalignant skin lesions such as keratoacanthoma, actinic keratosis and basal cell carcinoma One of the less toxic vitamin A analogues studied is fenretinide (4 hydroxypropyl phenyl retinamide), a synthetic amide derivative of all-trans- retinoic acid. It has been applied in the chemoprevention and in the treatment of different types of malignancies including breast cancer, neuroblastoma, prostate, ovary, and skin tumours (e. g. basal cell carcinoma) and some other skin diseases (e. g. actinic keratosis). Advanced topical formulations to be applied on skin should be desirable in order to locally treat cutaneous pathologies. Scientific researches are always in progress in order to develop new specialized vehicles able to assure targeted delivery of actives, minimizing at the same time toxic systemic effects. Solid Lipid Nanoparticles (SLN) have been firstly designed for i. v. administration and recently investigated for peroral and transdermal application. Their solid matrix should be able to protect chemically labile agents from degradation and to modulate drug release profiles. Skin care studies performed by the use of SLN indicate an increase in skin hydration and a reduction in wrinkle depth, moreover SLN can improve uptake of cosmetic agents. The <b>lecithin</b> <b>organogel</b> consists of reversed polymer-like micelles. They are generated from the initial spherical ones by dissolving trace amounts of water in a nonaqueous solution. The micellar aggregates entangle, forming a temporal three-dimensional network in the bulk phase. These gel-like reverse micellar systems are particularly interesting for dermocosmetic applications due to their ability to solubilize substances with different chemico-physical properties, their thermodynamic stability and their biocompatibility. Niosomes, vesicles prepared by non-ionic surfactants, have recently been largely proposed as drug delivery systems. This class of vesicles, structurally very similar to liposomes, was introduced in reason of the higher chemical stability of the surfactants compared to that of phospholipids. In particular the present study concerns the design and characterization of SLN, organogels and niosomes as vehicles for retinoids such as fenretinide and rethinyl acetate...|$|E
40|$|Dissertação de mestrado em Tecnologias do Medicamento, apresentada à Faculdade de Farmácia da Universidade de CoimbraGels have {{consistently}} been studied for {{their role in}} topical and transdermal drug delivery systems as a non-invasive technique, for pharmaceutical and cosmetics application. These formulations are semi-solid three-dimensional structures, porous, with unique characteristics, such as rigidity and elasticity at the same time. Because of their high aqueous phase content, gels permit a greater dissolution of drugs through the skin and enhance skin hydration by retaining {{a significant amount of}} transepidermal water, in contrast to creams and ointments. Conventionally, gels are differentiated into two different types according to the nature of their liquid phase: hydrogels, which contain a polar solvent (water) and organogels, which contain an organic/non-polar solvent, as external phase. Hydrogels consist of polymeric materials that exhibit the ability to swell and retain a large amount of water or other biofluids in its structures. Despite its great affinity for water, they only possess a swelling behavior without dissolving in water. This proves its high flexibility, similar to natural tissue. Organogels consist of a network of self-assembled molecules which forms a thermally reversible gel upon cooling, immobilizing a non-aqueous liquid. They are mainly composed by lipids (organic phase), so they easily interact with the lipid skin surface and enhance the drug permeation through the skin. The most widely used lipids are based in edible oils due to their high biocompatibility, such as soybean oil, sunflower oil, sesame seed oil or olive oil. Organogels form viscoelastic structures through non-covalent associations with gelling agents in low concentrations. The commonly used organogelators include sorbitan monostearate or sorbitan monopalmitate. These superstructures, often long fibers or needle-shaped structures, which entangle or form pseudocrystalline regions, immobilizing the liquid largely by surface tension and forming a gel of variable consistency. <b>Lecithin</b> <b>organogels</b> are a special type of organogels that do not require addition of any additional surfactant or penetration enhancer, as lecithin serves both the purposes. Recent studies have reported other types of gels for dermal drug application, such as proniosomal gels, emulgels, bigels and aerogels, combining features of conventional hydrogels and organogels. In conclusion, further studies in gel technologies are essentials to overcome the drawbacks of each gel system and for developing cost effective delivery systems for transdermal applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{catalytic}} {{ability of}} lipases encapsulated in organogels with {{supercritical carbon dioxide}} as external solvent was studied. Lipase from Candida antarctica was encapsulated in <b>lecithin</b> water-in-oil microemulsion-based <b>organogels</b> (MBGs) formulated with hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC). The esterification of lauric acid and 1 -propanol catalysed by these MBGs was examined in supercritical carbon dioxide (35 °C, 110 bar) as solvent for the substrates. The effect of various parameters such as pressure, mass fraction of biopolymer, alcohol and carboxylic acid chain length was studied in supercritical carbon dioxide. Results are discussed with reference to experiments performed with isooctane as external solvent. In addition, a kinetic study of MBG-encapsulated C. antarctica showed that the ester synthesis catalysed by the immobilised lipase occurs via a Ping Pong Bi Bi mechanism in which only inhibition by excess of alcohol was identified. Initial experiments concerning the reusability of these gels, moreover, showed that the slight decrease of activity in supercritical carbon dioxide {{is similar to that}} observed in isooctane. In addition, the catalytic activity of HPMC MBGs containing C. antarctica lipase immobilised in so-called detergentless microemulsions comprised of n-hexane, 1 -propanol, and buffer solution was investigated in supercritical carbon dioxide. It could be shown that this type of MBG is likewise active in supercritical carbon dioxide. Biocatalyst reuse experiments indicated that detergentless MBGs exhibit a better operational and storage stability than organogels formulated with classical microemulsions. Phytantriol-based organogels as a new type of immobilisation matrix were tested for their potential application as solid-phase catalysts with both isooctane and supercritical carbon dioxide as external solvents. It was shown that Mucor miehei lipase immobilised in such organogels is capable of catalysing the esterification of 1 -propanol and lauric acid in both solvents. In order to determine the operational stability of the immobilised lipase in phytantriol-based organogels, reuse experiments were conducted in isooctane. They showed that the catalytic activity is quite well preserved despite the fact that a loss of phytantriol occurs due to its extraction from the gel. Moreover, C. antarctica lipase was tested for catalytic activity in water-in-carbon dioxide (w/c) microemulsion systems based on both ionic and nonionic surfactants in supercritical carbon dioxide. However, no evidence for enzymatic catalysis by lipase solubilised in the microemulsions was found. Furthermore, qualitative solubility studies on surfactants and related molecules were performed in supercritical carbon dioxide in order to identify new surfactants for the formation of w/c microemulsions. While Dowanol DPM and Dowanol DPnB exhibited high solubility, the tested surfactants such as C 8 C 4, Akypo LF 1, Ralufon F 5 - 13, and Emulsogen CIO 050, were not found to be soluble in supercritical carbon dioxide or to stabilise w/c microemulsions...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{medications}} formulated as ointments or gels {{and applied to}} the inner pinna of cats has become popular in veterinary medicine due to the ease of administration by this route compared to oral administration. Benign hyperplasia of the thyroid is a very common condition in cats older than ten years of age. Medical therapy with anti-thyroid drugs such as methimazole or the pro-drug of methimazole, carbimazole, {{is one of the}} treatment options for cats with hyperthyroidism. All previous studies of methimazole applied to the inner ear of cats have used Pluronic® <b>lecithin</b> <b>organogel</b> as the vehicle, however carbimazole and methimazole are lipophilic drugs, and PLO gel might not be the most suitable vehicle for a lipid soluble drug. A series of studies were designed to test a new, lipophilic formulation of carbimazole and subsequently a new formulation of methimazole for transdermal application to the inner ear of cats for the therapy of hyperthyroidism. Two pharmacokinetic studies in healthy cats, one pilot trial and one clinical trial in client owned hyperthyroid cats, established that the lipophilic formulation could be absorbed from the ear and was a safe and efficacious therapy for hyperthyroidism in cats. A drug company (Bomac Ltd, now Bayer NZ Ltd) was interested in the novel formulation and the product was patented (International Application Number PCT/NZ 2008 / 000011). The commercial product containing the drug and vehicle was sold in New Zealand as Hyper-T™ Earspot. Finally, a series of three in vitro studies were performed to determine that methimazole in the lipophilic vehicle was: a) absorbed across the pinnal skin; b) absorbed more completely at that site than the same formulation applied to the neck, groin or thoracic skin; and c) able to penetrate from the inner to the outer ear of cats in an in vitro model. These studies represent the most extensive studies to date of a drug applied to the inner pinna of cats. The results from these studies suggest that methimazole in a lipophilic vehicle can be absorbed across the skin of cats and is an efficacious therapy for the treatment of hyperthyroidism in cats...|$|E
