In the Legislative Assembly in November 1942, Heffron denounced the advisers of the Federal Government who continued to maintain the brown-out as an essential defence measure: [...] "The only conclusion I can come to, is that the brown-out was born of a form of panic when Japan entered the war and it has continued because of a few brass hats will not <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> and the evidence of the fighting men, but persist in sticking to their first conclusion. The position, therefore, is ludicrous." [...] Heffron later affirmed that the brown-out was completely unnecessary as a black-out, with short notice given, was a more effective and safer defensive measure.|$|E

40|$|Pacifists {{and their}} opponents {{disagree}} {{not only about}} moral questions, but most often about factual questions as well. For example, they came to divergent descriptions {{of the crisis in}} Kosovo. According to my reconstruction of pacifism, this is not a surprise because <b>the</b> pacifist, legitimately, <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> in <b>the</b> light of her system of value. Her opponent, in turn, <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> in <b>the</b> light of alternative systems of value, and the quarrel between the two parties about supposedly descriptive matters does not come to an end as there is no objective reality about the war in question that could settle the issue. If I am right, the pacifist's value-laden way of <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> reality can be reconstructed as an obedience to three epistemic imperatives. First, the Epistemic Imperative concerning Human Nature ("Resist against demonizing the other side; always try to understand the case from their point of view"). Second, the Epistemic Imperative concerning Non-Violent Alternatives ("Always search for non-violent alternatives to projected military action"). Third, the Epistemic Imperative concerning Uncontrolled Escalation ("Sharpen your attention for uncontrolled, irreversible side effects of military action, particularly for the danger of escalation to another world war"). Objective reality does not decide how far one should go in following these imperatives. Rather, the decision about this is our's—similarly as in case of the scientist who decides to search for common deep structure behind the chaos of the manifold. So the pacifist's epistemic imperatives can be compared to Kant's regulative principles that are necessary for guiding the scientific scrutiny of reality...|$|R

In the fundamental equation M = P/E technical analysis is the examination of M (multiple). Multiple encompasses the psychology generally abounding, i.e. the extent of willingness to buy/sell. Also in M is the ability to pay as, for instance, a spent-out bull can't make the market go higher and a well-heeled bear won't. Technical analysis analyzes price, volume, psychology, money flow and other market information, whereas fundamental analysis <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> of <b>the</b> company, market, currency or commodity.
