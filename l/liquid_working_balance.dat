40|$|This thesis {{was aimed}} to analyse the {{feasibility}} {{and the performance}} of ionic liquids as an absorbent for ammonia refrigerant in absorption refrigeration systems. Ionic liquids, novel and tailor-made absorbents, can be used with ammonia as working pairs for absorption refrigeration cycles and give some advantages such as elimination of the rectification process in ammonia/water systems. The performances of several ammonia/ionic <b>liquid</b> mixtures <b>working</b> pair available in the literature were then theoretically studied and analysed for absorption refrigeration applications using selected NRTL model. In addition, new selected ammonia/ionic <b>liquid</b> mixtures <b>working</b> pair for absorption refrigeration applications were also theoretically studied and analysed. The results show that the coefficient of performance (COP) of the absorption systems <b>working</b> with ammonia/ionic <b>liquid</b> <b>working</b> fluids were about similar when compared with ammonia/LiNO 3 at same cooling capacity and operation conditions. Among all of selected ammonia/ionic <b>liquid</b> <b>working</b> fluids studied in this thesis, only [N 1113][NTf 2] presented higher COP that that of ammonia/LiNO 3 at certain operation conditions. The COP of the systems with other ionic liquids as absorbents follows an order of [EtOHmim][BF 4] > [N 111 (2 OH) ][NTf 2] > [EtOHmim][NTf 2] at all operation conditions. Finally it can be concluded that the ionic liquid has a great potential to be an alternative absorbent for ammonia refrigerant. The ammonia/ionic <b>liquid</b> <b>working</b> fluid can provide competitive performance in comparison with conventional absorbent for ammonia refrigerant. However, some drawbacks were still remains to be solved such as relatively low solubility of ammonia into ionic liquids which affects to the solution circulation mass flow ratio and relatively high viscosity of ionic liquid in comparison with other conventional absorbent which may affects to the performance of absorber and solution pump...|$|R

The results of the preliminary calibration show a good agreement with frequency-domain site response analysis in no-slip conditions.

40|$|Many of the {{difficulties}} of applying rights in practice lie in competing interpretations of rights by different groups and organisations. This paper illustrates the complexities of putting a theory of children's rights into practice within the everyday contexts of residential child care, in particular, {{as part of the}} routines of food provision and consumption of staff and children. The challenges of operationalising children's rights specifically are also associated with different understandings of the nature of adult-child relations. Furthermore, the paper argues that the ambiguities which arise when translating children's rights into practice are partly due to the tensions involved in striking a <b>working</b> <b>balance</b> between children's protection rights as well as their participation rights. This paper is based on an ethnographic study that explored food practices in three residential children's homes in Scotland...|$|R

40|$|A {{measurement}} technique for obtaining the pumping {{performance of a}} centrifugal collector under microgravity has been developed and evaluated through microgravity experiments. These tests have been conducted under conditions such that the pressure sensors cannot easily detect the pressure rise of the <b>liquid</b> <b>working</b> fluid. These conditions have a pressure increase smaller than 400 Pa. The characteristic of the head produced in a centrifugal collector calculated from experimental data agrees well with that predicted theoretically from the velocity and the pressure generated by rotation of the centrifugal collector. It is concluded from this result that the {{measurement technique}} can correctly obtain the pumping performance of the centrifugal collector under microgravity. The centrifugal collector has produced the head of 0. 041 m at the rotation speed of 223 rpm under microgravity. The working fluid is silicon oil.

With regard to minimizing internal leakages and lubricating moving machine parts, an auxiliary <b>liquid</b> or <b>liquid</b> <b>working</b> fluid can be fed to the screw expander.

40|$|The {{circulation}} pump in an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) increases {{the pressure of}} the <b>liquid</b> <b>working</b> fluid from low condensing pressure to high evaporating pressure, and the expander utilizes the pressure difference to generate work. A portion of the expander output power is used to offset the consumed pumping work, {{and the rest of the}} expander power is exactly the net work produced by the ORC system. Because of the relatively great theoretical pumping work and very low efficiency of the {{circulation pump}} reported in previous papers, the characteristics of the expander power used for offsetting the pumping work need serious consideration. In particular, the present work examines those characteristics. It is found that the characteristics of the expander power used for offsetting the pumping work are satisfactory only under the condition that the working fluid absorbs sufficient heat in the evaporator and its specific volume at the evaporator outlet is larger than or equal to a threshold value...|$|R
