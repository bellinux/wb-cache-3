The separation of tables, for documentation roles, from eds, for {{a model of}} computation, is used to give a clean semantics of algebraic tables independent {{of the type of}} table. We dene (1) the class of recursive algebraic tables and (2) recur-sive eds. By specialising techniques developed by R. Janicki, we show how a recursive algebraic table T can be mapped to recursive eds, i. e. the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>decisions</b> of T. Both operational and denotational semantics are given for recursive eds and they are shown to agree. The expressive power of recursive tables is compared to that of while-array program schemes: both soundness and adequacy are shown. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Classifier outputs in {{the form}} of {{continuous}} values have often been combined using linear sum or stacking, but little is generally known about evidential reasoning methods for combining truncated <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> ordered <b>decisions.</b> In this paper we introduce a novel class-indifferent method for combining such a kind <b>of</b> classifier <b>decisions.</b> Specifically we model each output given by classifiers on new instances as a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> ranked <b>decisions</b> that is divided into 2 subsets <b>of</b> <b>decisions,</b> which are represented by triplet-based belief functions and then are combined using Dempster’s rule of combination. We present a formalism for triplet-based belief functions and establish a range of general formulae for combining these beliefs in order to arrive at a consensus decision. In addition we carry out a comparative analysis with an alternative representation dichotomous belief functions on the UCI benchmark data. We also compare our combination method with the popular methods of stacking, boosting, linear sum and majority voting over the same benchmark data to demonstrate the advantage of our approach. ...|$|R
30|$|Decision aspects {{are also}} {{prioritized}} and their priorities may change. The <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> aspects may alter thus demanding complete reprioritization (block numbered 2). The <b>list</b> <b>of</b> requirements is updated {{due to the}} discovery of new customers that specifies new requirements and changes. The new set of requirements comprises new, changed, delayed and already implemented requirements; all of them subject to prioritization. Prioritization techniques find it difficult to handle such large number of requirements. To uncover this problem the heuristic approach is used to lower prioritization effort. An example of heuristic approach as proposed in (Gupta et al. 2014 a) employs the numerical assignment technique to quickly prioritize the available requirements (denote with set R). The pairwise comparison is performed among fewer requirements of set R and all newly emerged and changed requirements. Lesser effort is due to less effort for reprioritization although new and changed requirements are completely pairwise prioritized. Further, minimization is possible if the new and changed requirements are prioritized with minimal efforts.|$|R
40|$|AbstractOne of the {{challenges}} a decision maker faces in using rough sets is to choose a suitable rough set model for data analysis. We investigate how two rough set models, the Pawlak model and the probabilistic model, influence the <b>decision</b> goals <b>of</b> a user. Two approaches use probabilities to define regions in the probabilistic model. These approaches use either user-defined parameters or derive the probability thresholds from the cost associated with making a classification. By determining {{the implications of the}} results obtained from these models and approaches, we observe that the availability of information regarding the analysis data is crucial for selecting a suitable rough set approach. We present a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> types corresponding to the available information and user needs.

40|$|Abstract — Classification is an {{important}} data mining task which facilitates <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> rules that helps us to predict class of an unseen instance. Various traditional techniques like Decision tress, Neural Networks, SVMs {{have been used in}} past for rule mining. Nature Inspired Algorithms (NIAs) are class of algorithms that mimic natural processes and are capable of mining comprehensible and accurate rules. It is interesting to investigate Nature Inspired Algorithms (NIAs), exclusively GA and ACO, in context of rule mining. Classification model usually represents obvious information in form <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> rules and an unseen instance is liable to be misclassified if the model created using any of the above techniques do not account for exceptions present in the dataset. Instances having low support count and deviating from obvious behavior are termed as exceptions and {{they are less likely to}} be discovered using the usual rule discovery measures that account for generality of the discovered knowledge. In this paper we have investigated use of NIAs in rule mining and exception mining and we have also suggested possible modification in existing cAntMinerpb algorithm for mining exceptions...|$|R
