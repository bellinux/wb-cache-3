5|$|Much {{time was}} spent on getting guitars to sound as Simon preferred. A bit of {{experimentation}} among the additional session players occurred, from which Simon would edit himself, compiling them together or often deleting them altogether. Many songs were recorded with a hand-built cigar-box guitar, which Simon bought from Mississippi blues musician Super Chikan. Analogue effects were applied before recording digitally to keep mixes simple; this method also inspired Simon while arranging the songs. Smith would burn Simon a compact disc each evening of the dayâ€™s session, and he would return {{the next day with}} notes on the recordings. This resulted in mixes being created as the album developed, rather than {{at the end of the}} process. Simon and Ramone often <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> recordings while driving around, noting what would need changes.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the effect that <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> recordings of <b>their</b> own performances has on piano performers. Music students, majoring in piano performance, each played while their performances were recorded. They then marked their scores with a pencil, while <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> recordings, indicating the differences between what they focused on while playing versus what they listened for in their recordings. They were requested <b>to</b> express <b>their</b> feelings about <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> recordings after they performed twice. The results showed that performers considered their performances were improved by <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> recordings. On the other hand, some aspects of their performances did not improve because they were too aware of imperfections. As performers recognized <b>their</b> performances by <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> recordings, they found solutions <b>to</b> problems about <b>their</b> performances through trial and error...|$|R

5|$|Daara J, {{formed in}} 1997, was {{originally}} a trio {{that consisted of}} Faada Freddy, N'Dongo D and Lord Alajiiman. Lord Alajiiman performed and toured throughout {{the world with the}} group until 2008 when the group split. Since then, Alajiman evolves in a solo career while contributing {{to the development of the}} music sector in Senegal. Daara J was formed when all of its members were in high school, where they were studying accounting. The rappers were influenced by American hip hop artists such as Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five and Afrika Bambaataa but also <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> parents' music, which included artists such as Sly and the Family Stone and Aretha Franklin, and musical styles which included Cuban music. Faada Freddy cites the group's major inspiration as Das EFX. Originally, the members took instrumentals of hip hop tracks from the United States and France to rap over. Later they purchased a drum machine, but even with this equipment, a member of the group would have to imitate the other instruments in the song with his voice. Positive Black Soul, another Senegalese rap group, encouraged Daara J to record and perform.|$|E
25|$|On January 10, 1840, {{after several}} years of war and a major {{smallpox}} epidemic, three Comanche emissaries entered San Antonio and asked for peace, offering to send a large contingent of their leaders in 23 days to secure a new peace. They returned a white boy as a show of sincerity. Colonel Karnes received them, <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> story, and agreed, but admonished them by saying that a lasting peace could be negotiated only when the Comanches gave up the Anglo captives that they held, estimated at thirteen. Albert Sidney Johnston, the Texas Secretary of War, had ordered San Antonio officials to take the Comanche delegates as hostages if they failed to deliver all captives. In March, Muguara, a powerful eastern Comanche chief, led 65 Comanches, including women and children, to San Antonio for peace talks.|$|E

500|$|Washington {{proved an}} able {{administrator}} and established many precedents in {{the functions of}} the presidency, including messages to Congress and the cabinet form of government. He set the standard for tolerance of opposition voices, despite fears that a democratic system would lead to political violence, and he conducted a smooth transition of power to his successor. He was an excellent delegator and judge of talent and character; he talked regularly with department heads and <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> advice before making a final decision. In handling routine tasks, he was [...] "systematic, orderly, energetic, solicitous of the opinion of others ... but decisive, intent upon general goals and the consistency of particular actions with them." [...] After reluctantly serving a second term, Washington refused to run for a third, establishing the tradition of a maximum of two terms for a president which was solidified by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison.|$|E
500|$|According {{to his own}} estimate, Davidson {{approached}} around 150 to 200 girls a {{year over}} a period of 12 years (he later modified these figures to an overall total of between 500 and 1000). His activities usually centred on the innumerable Lyons, ABC and Express Dairies teashops and their staffs of waitresses. Davidson was mesmerised, says Blythe, by [...] "the ineffable harmonies created by starched linen crackling over young breasts and black-stockinged calves in chubby conference just below the hem of the parlourmaid's frock". Many rejected his advances; a number of teashops considered him a pest and barred him. Landladies took exception to his habit of visiting their female tenants {{at all hours of the}} night. Commentators have found little evidence that he behaved indecently, or molested the girls; he bought them tea, found them rooms, <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> problems and sometimes found them work on the stage or in domestic service. He styled himself the [...] "Prostitutes' Padre", and asserted to his bishop that this was [...] "the proudest title that a true priest of Christ can hold".|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} and {{promotion}} of They Liked You Better When You Were Dead, the band were approached by their management about whom they wanted to produce their debut full-length album. They requested Colin Richardson; initially sceptical about their chances, Richardson agreed to collaborate after he <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> demos. Fightstar entered studios in west London and Surrey with Richardson in October 2005. Richardson, who had previously produced albums for Funeral for a Friend, Machine Head and Fear Factory, was meticulous during pre-production and took five days to tune the drums. When recording began, he called the band [...] "very focused" [...] and {{said that there was}} a [...] "real buzz because nobody knows what to expect." [...] Grand Unification is a loose concept album, influenced by and based on the Neon Genesis Evangelion anime series. With lyrics loosely based on the personal experiences of Charlie Simpson and Alex Westaway, its underlying concept revolves around two people who experience the last few days of their lives {{before the end of the}} world.|$|E

500|$|The unequal {{concentration}} of land ownership remained an emotional subject and {{eventually became a}} cornerstone of liberal radicalism. The politically powerless poor crofters embraced the popularly oriented, fervently evangelical Presbyterian revival after 1800 and the breakaway [...] "Free Church" [...] after 1843. This evangelical movement was led by lay preachers who themselves came from the lower strata, and whose preaching was implicitly critical of the established order. The religious change energised the crofters and separated them from the landlords; it helped prepare them for their successful and violent challenge to the landlords in the 1880s through the Highland Land League. Violence began on the Isle of Skye when Highland landlords cleared their lands for sheep and deer parks. It was quieted when the government stepped in passing the Crofters' Holdings (Scotland) Act, 1886 to reduce rents, guarantee fixity of tenure, and break up large estates to provide crofts for the homeless. In 1885 three Independent Crofter candidates were elected to Parliament, which <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> pleas. The results included explicit security for the Scottish smallholders; {{the legal right to}} bequeath tenancies to descendants; and creating a Crofting Commission. The Crofters as a political movement faded away by 1892, and the Liberal Party gained most of their votes.|$|E

In 1967, after leaving Texas, Boortz moved to Atlanta and landed a sales job. For two years he worked at Rich's Department Store, where he sold jewelry and carpeting. He later recollected that one of his customers was Martin Luther King, Jr. During that time, Boortz was an avid listener of WRNG-AM, which called itself [...] "Ring Radio", Atlanta's first talk radio station. He <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> morning talk show host, Herb Elfman, and soon became a devotee. [...] "Boortz bombarded Elfman with calls, reading him little scripts he'd scribbled." [...] While watching the news one evening, he heard that Elfman had committed suicide. The next morning, Boortz showed up at the front door of WRNG and announced that he was ready to take Elfman's place. Even though the management told him that [...] "they were going to search for a 'qualified' host to take his place", Boortz was offered to be a temporary two-week replacement. In the interim, the evening host was moved to mornings and Boortz hosted the evening. Two weeks later, Boortz was moved to the morning show, embarking on an Atlanta talk radio career that spanned more than forty years. Boortz honed his skills at the tiny 1,000-watt station, and even wrote a few speeches for then Georgia Governor Lester Maddox. He continued working at the station until 1974, when WRNG [...] "dumped him". He worked briefly at a radio station in Schenectady, New York, but soon returned to Atlanta.|$|E

During her first recording session, Rose read through and recorded the entire script in eight hours, describing the experience as [...] "exhausting, but wonderful." [...] She and co-star Bruno Campos, who provided the voice of Prince Naveen, recorded the majority of their dialogue separately.|$|E

Newly elected Virginia Governor John S. Battle refused their request for clemency. In advance of a large planned CRC demonstration in the state capital, Governor Battle doubled the capital guard and alerted the state militia. On January 30, 1951, 400 protesters arrived in Richmond, appealing to Battle {{on the issue of}} racial disparity in sentencing. Governor Battle <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> claims but was unwilling to bend {{on the issue of the}} Seven, saying: [...] "The prisoners have not been convicted because they are Negroes and should not be released because they are Negroes."

2500|$|Although Emperor Guangwu {{had already}} created {{many of his}} generals and {{officials}} marquesses, in 37, after the conquest of the empire was largely complete, he readjusted their marches {{in accordance with their}} accomplishments.

[...] He therefore resolved to give the generals large marches but not give them official positions in his government. [...] He rewarded them with great wealth and often <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> advice, but rarely put them in positions of authority. [...] He thereby reduced friction between him and his generals, thus allowing for their relationships to be preserved. [...] In this, he was matched perhaps only by Emperor Taizu of Song (Zhao Kuangyin).|$|E
