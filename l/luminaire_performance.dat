40|$|The {{illumination}} {{performance of}} surgical luminaires is quantified by performance indicators defined {{in an international}} standard (IEC 2000). The remaining maximum illuminance in relevant situations, the light-field size, and the spectral characteristics are performance indicators used by hospitals as input for luminaire opting processes. Industry however focuses on illuminance when communicating with health care professionals. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate whether these standards are sufficient to describe <b>luminaire</b> <b>performance,</b> especially for modern LED lighting technology. Illuminance distribution and spectrum measurements were performed on 5 different state-of-the-art (LED) surgical luminaires. The results showed that changing situations not only changed the maximum illuminance but also changed the light-field sizes and shapes, introducing substantial differences between luminaires. Moreover, colored cast shadows and light color variations across the light-field were observed for 3 luminaires using differently colored light emitting diodes (LEDs). Both the changing light-field sizes and shapes, and the cast shadows and light color variations for LED luminaires are not covered by the current standard. The standard should therefore be extended to incorporate these aspects, especially for such a high-end application as surgical lightin...|$|E
40|$|A new roadway {{lighting}} {{demonstration project}} was initiated in late 2010, which was planned {{in conjunction with}} other upgrades to NE Cully Boulevard, a residential collector road in the northeast area of Portland, OR. With the NE Cully Boulevard project, the Portland Bureau of Transportation hoped to demonstrate different light source technologies and different luminaires side-by-side. This report documents the initial performance of six different newly installed luminaires, including three LED products, one induction product, one ceramic metal halide product, and one high-pressure sodium (HPS) product that represented the baseline solution. It includes reported, calculated, and measured performance; evaluates the economic feasibility of each of the alternative luminaires; and documents user feedback collected from a group of local Illuminating Engineering Society (IES) members that toured the site. This report does not contain any long-term performance evaluations or laboratory measurements of <b>luminaire</b> <b>performance.</b> Although not all of the installed products performed equally, the alternative luminaires generally offered higher efficacy, more appropriate luminous intensity distributions, and favorable color quality when compared to the baseline HPS luminaire. However, some products did not provide sufficient illumination to all areas—vehicular drive lanes, bicycle lanes, and sidewalks—or would likely fail to meet design criteria {{over the life of the}} installation due to expected depreciation in lumen output. While the overall performance of the alternative luminaires was generally better than the baseline HPS luminaire, cost remains a significant barrier to widespread adoption. Based on the cost of the small quantity of luminaires purchased for this demonstration, the shortest calculated payback period for one of the alternative luminaire types was 17. 3 years. The luminaire prices were notably higher than typical prices for currently available luminaires purchased in larger quantities. At prices that are more typical, the payback would be less than 10 years. In addition to the demonstration luminaires, a networked control system was installed for additional evaluation and demonstration purposes. The capability of control system to measure luminaire input power was explored in this study. A more exhaustive demonstration and evaluation of the control system will be the subject of future GATEWAY report(s) ...|$|E

40|$|In the {{presented}} research, mobile camera {{technology is}} {{used to assess the}} performance of airport ground lighting. In particular, automated assessment of the <b>performance</b> of <b>luminaires</b> in the approach lighting system CALS) within an airport landing lighting system is proposed. To do this a camera must be installed in the cockpit of an aircraft. As the aircraft approaches the runway, the camera records image data of the lighting pattern. Subsequent image analysis, using the computer vision techniques proposed here, will allow a performance metric to be determined for the <b>luminaires.</b> The <b>performance</b> metric will rank the luminaires based on their performance. This is very useful information towards the maintenance strategy for the airport and to date, is the only method available to evaluate the <b>performance</b> of <b>luminaires</b> in the ALS pattern. In order to determine the performance metric for the ALS, the luminaires must be identified in each image in which they appear or tracked throughout the complete acquired image sequence. For each identified lurninaire, the pixel information representing that luminaire must be extracted and stored. A measure of the pixel grey level per luminaire per image is then used to estimate a performance measure for each luminaire. In addition, since mobile camera technology is used, some of the captured images can become corrupted with the effects of vibration. The effect that this vibration will have on the pixel grey level information recorded for a given luminaire is not known. Therefore a methodology to quantify this effect is proposed. In addition, since the quality of captured images can vary with vibration, a reliability factor is also automatically determined for each acquired performance measurement. Using the <b>performance</b> measurement data <b>luminaires</b> are ranked in a list and this list is then reported to the maintenance team at a given airport.

40|$|The {{adoption}} of energy efficiency measures in building codes places constraints on lighting designers that they fear {{will reduce the}} quality of the lit environment. This experiment was designed to test the hypothesis that lighting quality, as understood by lighting designers, affects the task performance, mood, comfort, health, and aesthetic judgements of office workers. Nine lighting systems were installed in a windowless, 83 m), open-plan office space containing six workstations. The designs combined three levels of lighting power density (LPD) and three levels of Designers' Lighting Quality (DLQ) (recessed troffers with prismatic lenses; recessed troffers with parabolic louvers; indirect or direct/indirect fixtures). In the low LPD options, the ambient lighting systems were supplemented with task lighting. Temporary office workers (292 in total) each worked for one day under one of the nine lighting conditions. In addition to morning and afternoon visual performance tests, they performed a variety of computer-based and paper-based tasks designed to be representative of modern office work, and completed questionnaires to assess satisfaction and impressions of lighting quality, mood, physical comfort, and social behaviours. The results show that energy-efficient lighting and good-quality lighting can be compatible. For computer-based work, under existing lighting power density limits, parabolic-louvered luminaires provide better verbal-intellectual and clerical task performance than recessed lensed <b>luminaires.</b> Verbal-intellectual task <b>performance</b> and visual performance were better under electronic ballasts than magnetic ballasts, regardless of lighting system.
