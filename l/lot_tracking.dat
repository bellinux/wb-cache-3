25|$|Inventory {{management}} {{involves a}} retailer seeking to acquire {{and maintain a}} proper merchandise assortment while ordering, shipping, handling and related costs are kept in check. It also involves systems and processes that identify inventory requirements, set targets, provide replenishment techniques, report actual and projected inventory status and handle all functions related to the tracking and management of material. This would include the monitoring of material moved {{into and out of}} stockroom locations and the reconciling of the inventory balances. It also may include ABC analysis, <b>lot</b> <b>tracking,</b> cycle counting support, etc. Management of the inventories, with the primary objective of determining/controlling stock levels within the physical distribution system, functions to balance the need for product availability against the need for minimizing stock holding and handling costs.|$|E

As a result, much inventory that was legal prior to the signing of the law and was manufactured shortly thereafter will probably be on shelves as the deadlines approach.

There is also confusion of what products need a GCC and which do not.

40|$|In industry, {{packaging}} design has often a subordinate role {{with respect to}} products and production systems design. However, {{it can lead to}} devastating effects on supply chain costs and performances. There is a need for methods and tools which show the impact of packaging along the whole supply chain by a logistic point of view in order to avoid sub-optimizations. Innovative approaches able to take into account different and often opposite needs are urgently required. The main conceptual innovation of the present work lies in its theoretical formulation of a new integrated procedure for an efficient design of packaging systems, according to a multi-criteria optimization approach. All design criteria applied will prosecute operative and logistic objectives (i. e. product integrity, personnel safety, ergonomics of manual activities, <b>lot</b> <b>tracking</b> and tracing, loads handling, vehicle saturation, environmental impact, etc.) including aspects linked to available International Standards...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Locally Orderless <b>Tracking</b> (<b>LOT)</b> is {{a visual}} {{tracking}} algorithm that automati-cally estimates {{the amount of}} local (dis) order in the target. This lets the tracker specialize in both rigid and deformable objects on-line and with no prior assumptions. We provide a probabilistic model of the target variations over time. We then rigorously show that this model is a special case of the Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD) optimization problem where the ground distance is governed by some underlying noise model. This noise model has sev-eral parameters that control the cost of moving pixels and changing their color. We develop two such noise models and demonstrate how their parameters can be estimated on-line dur-ing tracking {{to account for the}} amount of local (dis) order in the target. We also discuss the significance of this on-line parameter update and demonstrate its contribution to the perfor-mance. Finally we show <b>LOT’s</b> <b>tracking</b> capabilities on challenging video sequences, both commonly used and new, displaying performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} few years, {{remarkable}} afforts have been made for the ralization of microscale sensors, actuators and microelectromechanical systems. Due to advances in solid state and micromachining technologies, significant advances in designing, fabricating and testing of microminiaturized devices have been achieved at laboratory level. However, the technical and economical realization of microelectromechanical systems is considerably impeded {{by the lack of}} satisfying device technology for their industrial production. A production concept for the industrial production of hybrid microelectromechanical systems was developed and investigated. The concept is based on the resources and requirements of medium-sized enterprises and is characterized by its flexibility. Microsystem fab rication is separated into mecrofabrication steps performed in-house and tehcnological steps performed by external technology providers. The modularity of the concept allows for a gradual increase in the degree of automatison and the in-house production depth, depending on market capacity and financial resources. To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, the design and realization of a microfabrication process center, which includes tasks like transport and handling, processing, cleaning, testing and storing are discussed. Special attention is given to the supply and feeding of micropartsa, to the necessary magazines, trays and transport systems, to the implementation of homogeneous mechanical, environmental and information interfaces, to the employment of advanced control, scheduling, and <b>lot</b> <b>tracking</b> concepts, and to the application of highly modular and cost-efficient clean production concepts...|$|E
