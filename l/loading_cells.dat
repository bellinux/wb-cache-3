Drilled shaft foundation elements provide a cost-effective foundation alternative for the support of building and bridge superstructure loads. Bi-directional pile loading tests (BDPLTs) to evaluate the capacity of drilled shafts have become popular owing to their capacity to save time and effort as compared to the use of top-down loading tests. However, the use of BDPLTs requires that production shafts be post-grouted following testing in order to assure appropriate in-service performance. Commonly used single-acting <b>loading</b> <b>cells</b> and/or loading cell construction details can pose the potential for the development of voids following post-grouting due to their monotonic jacking action and large footprint. This paper described the development and use of high pressure bi-directional <b>loading</b> <b>cells</b> intended to minimize the possibility of post-test construction defects. First, a comparison was made between the single-acting and double-acting <b>loading</b> <b>cells.</b> Second, the results of laboratory calibrations on the pressurized <b>loading</b> <b>cells</b> were performed, as were component testing of the pumps, hoses, and hydraulic fluid synchronization lines. Then, the use of the new high pressure double-acting <b>loading</b> <b>cells</b> in production testing of instrumented shafts was described, and the efficacy of the new <b>loading</b> <b>cells</b> was illustrated. The new <b>loading</b> <b>cells</b> provided the profession with a load cell alternative for conducting BDLTs and should serve to help reduce the risk of post-test grouting defects in drilled shaft foundations...|$|E
40|$|Transfection agent (TFA) -induced {{magnetic}} cell labeling with Feridex IV {{is an attractive}} method of <b>loading</b> <b>cells</b> because it employs a pharmaceutical source of iron oxide. Although attractive, the method has two significant drawbacks. First, it requires mixing positively charged transfection agents and negatively charged magnetic nanoparticles, and the resulting loss of nanoparticle surface charge causes nanoparticle precipitation. Second, it can result in nanoparticle adsorption to the cell surface rather than internalization. Internalization of Feridex (and associated dextran) is important since dextran cell exterior can react with the antidextran antibodies, commonly present in human populations, and trigger an antibody-mediated cytotoxicity. Here we employed three assays for selecting Feridex/TFA mixtures to minimize nanoparticle precipitation and surface adsorption: (1) an assay for precipitation or stability (light scattering), (2) an assay for labeled cells (percentage of cells retained by a magnetic filter), and (3) an antidextran-based assay for nanoparticle internalization. Cells loaded with Feridex/protamine had internalized iron, whereas cells loaded with Feridex/Lipofectamine had surface-adsorbed iron. Optimal conditions for <b>loading</b> <b>cells</b> were 10 mg/Feridex and 3 mg/mL protamine sulfate. Conditions for <b>loading</b> <b>cells</b> with Feridex and a TFA need to be carefully selected to minimize nanoparticle precipitation and dextran adsorption to the cell surface...|$|E

These <b>load</b> <b>cells</b> are {{particularly}} stiff, have very good resonance values, and tend to have long life cycles in application. Strain gauge <b>load</b> <b>cells</b> work on the principle that the strain gauge (a planar resistor) deforms/stretches/contracts when the material of the <b>load</b> <b>cells</b> deforms appropriately. These values are extremely small and are relational to the stress and/or strain that the material <b>load</b> <b>cell</b> is undergoing at the time.

40|$|Foliar {{vascular}} {{anatomy and}} photosynthesis were evaluated {{for a number}} of summer annual species that either load sugars into the phloem via a symplastic route (Cucumis sativus L. cv. Straight Eight; Cucurbita pepo L. cv. Italian Zucchini Romanesco; Citrullus lanatus L. cv. Faerie Hybrid; Cucurbita pepo L. cv. Autumn Gold) or an apoplastic route (Nicotiana tabacum L.; Solanum lycopersicum L. cv. Brandywine; Gossypium hirsutum L.; Helianthus annuus L. cv. Soraya), as well as winter annual apoplastic loaders (Spinacia oleracea L. cv. Giant Nobel; Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynhold Col- 0, Swedish and Italian ecotypes). For all summer annuals, minor vein cross-sectional xylem area and tracheid number as well as the ratio of phloem <b>loading</b> <b>cells</b> to phloem sieve elements, each when normalized for foliar vein density (VD), was correlated with photosynthesis. These links presumably reflect (1) the xylem's role in providing water to meet foliar transpirational demand supporting photosynthesis and (2) the importance of the driving force of phloem loading as well as the cross-sectional area for phloem sap flux to match foliar photosynthate production. While photosynthesis correlated with the product of VD and cross-sectional phloem cell area among symplastic loaders, photosynthesis correlated with the product of VD and phloem cell number per vein among summer annual apoplastic loaders. Phloem cell size has thus apparently been a target of selection among symplastic loaders (where loading depends on enzyme concentration within <b>loading</b> <b>cells)</b> versus phloem cell number among apoplastic loaders (where loading depends on membrane transporter numbers) ...|$|E
