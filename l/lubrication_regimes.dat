The test system used was tri-pin on disc with pins made of PEEK and counterbody made of steel; they were fully immersed in ATF Dexron VI oil. Some test parameters were held constant, such as the apparent pressure of 2 MPa, linear velocity of 2 m/s, oil temperature at 85 °C, and the time - 120 minutes.

On {{the basis of these}} effects and the visual image of the contact, the flow of lubricant in the contact area is described. Shallow dimples lead to larger film thickness in elasto-hydrodynamic <b>lubrication</b> <b>regime.</b> They act like a lubricant reservoir. Deep dimples positively affect film thickness in hydrodynamic <b>lubrication</b> <b>regime,</b> where the effect of shallow dimples descend. During experiments, the formation of a cavitation is observed. The cavitation causes a starvation of dimples in many cases. This leads to reducing of the lubricant film thickness.

40|$|To ensure high device yields, wafer surface {{contamination}} and defects must be monitored and controlled {{during the entire}} process of semiconductor manufacturing. Particle surface concentrations on the wafers, mostly related to chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) processes, must be kept at the lowest possible levels. Brush scrubber cleaning {{has the potential to}} achieve this goal. However, the particle removal mechanisms are still under discussion especially the removal of nano-sized particles. This paper investigates the interactions between the particle, the brush and the wafer surface and explores the potential and limitations of the brush scrubbing technique. Furthermore the effect of the various brush/wafer parameters on the particle removal efficiency (PRE) is studied. From a mechanistic viewpoint it is shown that brush scrubbing acts in a mixed <b>lubrication</b> <b>regime.</b> From an extensive analysis of the relevant forces and moments it can be concluded that in the hydrodynamic <b>lubrication</b> <b>regime,</b> particles are removed by rolling under the dominant hydrodynamic drag force. In the boundary <b>lubrication</b> <b>regime,</b> particles can be removed by both rolling and lifting, mainly by the brush/particle van der Waals forces. The pH and the ionic strength of the cleaning fluid can influence the PRE. The chemical composition determines the electrostatic interactions of the particle once it is "kicked off" from the wafer surface: either the surface of the particles and the wafer carry the same charge and the particles remain in solution or the surface of the particles and the wafer has an opposite charge resulting in redeposition.

40|$|The {{quality of}} {{lubrication}} condition between seal faces directly affects the reliability, operating life and sealing performance of mechanical seals. Thus, {{the identification of}} <b>lubrication</b> <b>regimes</b> in face seals i. e. boundary lubrication (BL), mixed lubrication (ML) and hydrodynamic lubrication (HL) is of high importance for developing effective online condition monitoring approaches. This paper investigates the tribological behaviour and frictional characteristics of mechanical seals based on nonintrusive acoustic emission (AE) measurements. Mathematical models for AE generation mechanisms are derived based on the tribological behaviour and operating parameters of mechanical seals. They produce agreeable results with experimental data in explaining the types of AE signals observed in monitoring the face lubrication conditions. Frequency domain analysis of data shows that the viscous friction process generates more low frequency AE signals, whereas the asperity interactions show more high frequency AE. Moreover, the feasibility of using statistical parameters of the time domain data is shown to identify the <b>lubrication</b> <b>regimes</b> in face seals...|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} {{of improving the}} performance of lubricated surfaces through surface texturing has been a topic of intense research in the latest years. Considerable efforts in both experimental and numerical works {{have been made to}} study the effects of micro-textures in load capacity, friction and wear. In the industry it has been {{known for a long time}} that some texturing is required in the liners of combustion engines to avoid stiction with the piston rings. The numerical simulation of that problem poses a challenge in modeling the intervening phenomena (cavitation, starvation, ring dynamics) and solving it efficiently. In this work we present numerical simulations of the piston ring/liner problem in the hydrodynamic <b>lubrication</b> <b>regime</b> using the Elrod-Adams model and a mass-conserving algorithm. Realistic values are assumed for the parameters defining the problem. The formation of cavitation bubbles and its relation with the load-carrying capacity, friction and clearance is analyzed by considering different texture configurations and shapes in one-dimensional tests. Afterwards, two-dimensional dimpled surfaces are simulated for more than a hundred different texture configurations in the hydrodynamic <b>lubrication</b> <b>regime</b> for several Stribeck numbers. A robust code accelerated by means of a multigrid implementation allowed the realization of this extensive study.

This research investigates into vibration responses of such bearings using a clustering technique for identifying different <b>lubrication</b> <b>regimes,</b> and consequently for assessing bearing lubrication conditions. It firstly understands that the vibration sources are mainly due to the nonlinear effects including micro asperity collisions and fluid shearing interactions. These excitations together with complicated vibration paths are difficult to be characterized in a linear way {{for the purpose of}} condition monitoring. Therefore, a clustering analysis technique is adopted to classify the vibration spectrum in high frequency ranges around 10 kHz into different representative responses that corresponds to different bearing modulus values and lubrication characteristics. In particular, the analysis allows sensitive signal components and sensor positions to be determined for monitoring the journal bearing effectively. Test results from self-aligning spherical journal bearings show that it allows different lubricant oils and different <b>lubrication</b> <b>regimes</b> to be identified appropriately, providing feasible ways to online monitoring bearing conditions...|$|E

40|$|This study {{describes}} an equine joint friction test using a cartilage-on-cartilage arrangement and investigates {{the influence of}} age and load on the frictional response. Osteochondral plugs were extracted from equine shoulder joints (2 – 5 years, n = 12; 10 – 14 years, n = 15), and mounted in a pin-on-disc tribometer. The frictional response was then measured under constant conditions (2 N; 20 °C; 5 mm/s), and with increasing load (2 N, 5 N, 10 N). In all experiments, the friction coefficient of young cartilage was significantly (P < 0. 001) smaller than obtained from old cartilage, while {{the application of a}} greater load resulted in a significant (P < 0. 001) decrease in friction coefficient only in old cartilage.

However, {{it is not always}} possible to ensure this owing to changes in operating conditions such as load, speed, temperature etc. The overall frictional losses in machines are thus dependent on the operating <b>lubrication</b> <b>regimes</b> (boundary, mixed or full-film). The present work is thus aimed at investigating the role of different surface modification technologies on friction of a conformal tribopair both in boundary and full film <b>lubrication</b> <b>regimes.</b> The conformal pair chosen is a hydrodynamic bearing with some hydrostatic lift. A special test rig comprising of two bearings was built for the experimental studies. Tribological tests were conducted in a wide speed range so as to enable studies in all <b>lubrication</b> <b>regimes</b> i. e., in boundary, mixed and full-film lubrication. The influence of application of different surface modification technologies on friction has been studied. In all, rollers with five coatings (four hard DLC coatings and one self-lubricating coating) and two rollers without coating having different surface finish. Friction measurements were made on the new as well as the previously run-in components. The different coatings exhibit different levels of boundary friction, with the self-lubricating coating having lowest boundary friction, closely followed by those with hard DLC coatings. The softer amongst the hard DLC coatings showed similar boundary friction compared to that with uncoated rollers. The lift-off speed, i. e., the transition between full-film to mixed and boundary lubrication mainly governed by the surface topography characteristics. A smooth surface finish can be achieved either by polishing before the test or by effective running in of the new surface. The effectiveness of running-in of surfaces was influenced by the surface roughness and hardness of the interacting surfaces. Godkänd; 2010; Bibliografisk uppgift: CD-ROM; 20100628 (ysko...|$|E
