2500|$|On 1 August 2014, the 20th Air Force Helicopter Operations Group (Provisional) {{stood up}} at F. E. Warren Air Force Base, Wyoming {{to support the}} three USAF {{intercontinental}} ballistic missile wings. [...] Prior to the activation of the provisional group, helicopter units supporting Minuteman missile wings {{were assigned to the}} missile wing's operations group; the 37th Helicopter Squadron at F. E. Warren to the 90th Operations Group, the 40th Helicopter Squadron at Malmstrom Air Force Base, Montana to the 341st Operations Group, and the 54th Helicopter Squadron at Minot Air Force Base, North Dakota to the 91st Operations Group. [...] The formation of the group followed a recommendation from the Air Force Global Strike Command Force Improvement Program. [...] It created an aviation-focused headquarters to support the missile mission for the first time. [...] One hoped-for side effect was to improve morale in the helicopter crews that have been performing the nuclear support mission with the Bell UH-1 Huey since 1969. UH-1s would be used for by missile support units for the foreseeable future due to the cancellation of the Common Vertical <b>Lift</b> <b>Support</b> Platform in 2013.|$|E

50|$|Between December 1979 and {{the summer}} of 2013, 846 Naval Air Squadron {{operated}} the Westland Sea King HC4 helicopter to provide troop transport and load <b>lifting</b> <b>support</b> to 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines.

5000|$|... 845 Naval Air Squadron is a {{squadron}} of the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm. Part of the Commando Helicopter Force, it is a specialist amphibious unit operating the AgustaWestland Merlin HC3/HC3A helicopter and provides troop transport and load <b>lifting</b> <b>support</b> to 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines. In 2012, the squadron celebrated 50 years since it was awarded [...] "commando" [...] status.|$|R

50|$|In 1992, while off {{the coast}} off Italy, the CH-46s of HMM-266 (Rein) made {{worldwide}} news. They provided heavy <b>lift</b> <b>support</b> when Mount Etna erupted and lava flow threatened {{to wipe out the}} town of Zafferana, Sicily.|$|E
5000|$|Currently the {{squadron}} operates Bell UH-1N Huey helicopters {{acquired in the}} early 1970s. [...] Air Force Space Command also operates the UH-1N and has proposed the Common Vertical <b>Lift</b> <b>Support</b> Platform (CVLSP) program to seek a replacement to their UH-1Ns.|$|E

25|$|Because {{they are}} {{relatively}} easy to measure, the wing-tip trajectories have been reported more frequently. For example, selecting only flight sequences that produced enough <b>lift</b> to <b>support</b> a weight, will show that the wing tip follows an elliptical shape. Noncrossing shapes were also reported for other insects. Regardless of their exact shapes, the plugging-down motion indicates that insects may use aerodynamic drag in addition to <b>lift</b> to <b>support</b> its weight.|$|R
5000|$|Parallel Arm <b>lifts</b> <b>support</b> lower <b>lifting</b> {{capacities}} and are commonly installed on pickup trucks and service truck bodies. The parallel [...] "arms" [...] attach {{to both sides}} of the lifting platform and guide the platform out and away from the liftgate mainframe. Parallel Arm designs can either feature two hydraulic cylinders applying force directly to the lifting platform or a single hydraulic cylinder using some version of a cable-pulley system.|$|R
50|$|The manual {{laboratory}} {{scissor jack}} works mechanically {{by having a}} central screw connected to the central piece of metal between two layers of crossing metal pieces. The screw performs the same task as screws in hydraulic car <b>lift,</b> <b>supporting</b> the metal pieces in withstanding the oppressing weight. Turning the screw increases and decreases the angle between the metal pieces, resulting in extension and contraction of the platform height.|$|R

50|$|When Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, the Wolfpack {{became the}} first CH-53E {{squadron}} to deploy to Saudi Arabia. While in support of operations DESERT SHIELD and DESERT STORM, HMH-466 recovered downed aircraft, conducted the first Night Vision Goggle (NVG) troop insertion, and provided heavy <b>lift</b> <b>support</b> from port facilities to staging areas {{in preparation for the}} ground phase of the operation. Upon cessation of hostilities, the Wolfpack returned to Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Tustin having sustained no losses of personnel or aircraft.|$|E

Severely affected animals become weak, develop muscle atrophy in the hind limbs, and may fall or become reluctant to lie down when confined.|$|R
50|$|Aeroflot {{was also}} {{responsible}} for such services as ice patrol in the Arctic Ocean and escorting of ships through frozen seas; oil exploration; power line surveillance; and transportation and heavy <b>lifting</b> <b>support</b> on construction projects. For the latter tasks, Aeroflot used, in addition to smaller helicopters, the Mil Mi-10 flying crane capable of lifting 11,000 to 14,000 kg. Hauling of heavy cargo, including vehicles, was performed by the world's largest operational helicopter, the Mil Mi-26. Its unusual eight-blade rotor enabled it to lift a maximum payload of some twenty tons.|$|R
50|$|Beginning on 17 August 2009 Denver started {{rendering}} {{humanitarian assistance}} to Taiwan {{due to the}} destruction caused by Typhoon Morakot. Denver was tasked independently to render aid, along with two embarked squadrons, HM-14 and HSC-25. They were supporting efforts by airlifting food, medical supplies, and providing heavy <b>lift</b> <b>support</b> for earth moving equipment to assist with recovery efforts. Due to the sensitive nature surrounding Taiwan, especially with the One China policy, the Department of Defense did not publicly announce relief efforts. Denver was planned {{to be in the}} vicinity of Taiwan until 22 August 2009 to render aid to the people of Taiwan.

50|$|Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 464 (HMH-464) was {{reactivated}} {{under the}} Command of LtCol Flynn at Marine Corps Air Station New River, North Carolina on March 1, 1981 tasked to receive and introduce the CH-53E Super Stallion to the Fleet Marine Force. It {{became the first}} Marine squadron to receive the first production CH-53E aircraft in mid-1981. In 1983, four of the squadrons CH-53E aircraft along with pilots and supporting ground crew, deployed {{as part of the}} 24th Marine Amphibious Unit aboard the USS Iwo Jima to Beirut, Lebanon. This was the first shipboard deployment of the new aircraft. While in theater, the aircraft provided heavy <b>lift</b> <b>support</b> during the deployment, and provided critical support during the aftermath of the tragic October 23 bombing of the Marine barracks.|$|E
5000|$|.....we {{determined}} that the most dangerous and critical part of the operation was getting the force on the ground. We knew we could kill the enemy if they showed themselves, so we thought the greater risk was crashing a helicopter in the unfamiliar and harsh terrain at 9,000 feet of altitude. Lieutenant Colonel Jim Larson Chinook and Blackhawk aircraft from 159th Aviation Brigade provided direct <b>lift</b> <b>support</b> for Operation Anaconda. U.S. Army intelligence had located {{a large number of}} Taliban and al Qaeda personnel operating in the Shah-e-Kot Valley, near the Pakistani border.
