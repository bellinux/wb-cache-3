The group is designated by a group number (-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, etc.) which is the power to which 2 should be raised to obtain the spatial frequency of the first element (e.g., group -2 is 0.25 line pairs per millimeter). Each element is the 6th root of 2 smaller than the preceding element in the group (e.g. element 1 is 2^0, element 2 is 2^(-1/6), element 3 is 2(-1/3), etc.).

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} a novel induction-based {{framework for}} logic programming. Limiting programs are logic programs distinguished by two features, in general they contain an infinite data stream over which induction will be performed, {{and in general}} {{it is not possible}} for a system to know when a solution for any program is correct. These facts are characteristic of some problems involving induction in artificial intelligence, and several problems in knowledge representation and logic programming have exactly these properties. This thesis presents a specification language for problems with an inductive nature, limiting programs, and a resolution based system, <b>limiting</b> <b>resolution,</b> for solving these problems. This framework has properties which guarantee that the system will converge upon a particular answer in the limit. Solutions to problems which have such an inductive property by nature can be implemented using the language, and solved with the solver. For instance, many classification problems are inductive by nature. Some generalized planning problems also have the inductive property. For a class of generalized planning problems, we show that identifying a collection of domains where a plan reaches a goal is equivalent to producing a plan. This thesis gives examples of both. <b>Limiting</b> <b>resolution</b> works by a generate-and-test strategy, creating a potential solution and iteratively looking for a contradiction with the growing stream of data provided. <b>Limiting</b> <b>resolution</b> can be implemented by modifying conventional PROLOG technology. The generateand- test strategy has some inherent inefficiencies. Two improvements have arisen from this work; the first is a tabling strategy which records previously failed attempts to produce a solution and thereby avoids redundant test steps. The second is based on the heuristic observation that for some problems the size of the test step is proportional to the closeness of the generated potential-solution to the real solution, in a suitable metric. The observation can be used to improve the performance of <b>limiting</b> <b>resolution.</b> Thus this thesis describes, from theoretical foundations to implementation, a coherent methodology for incorporating induction into existing general A. I. programming techniques, along with examples of how to perform such tasks...|$|E

40|$|A {{community}} detection {{algorithm is}} considered to have a <b>resolution</b> <b>limit</b> if {{the scale of the}} smallest modules that can be resolved depends {{on the size of the}} analyzed subnetwork. The <b>resolution</b> <b>limit</b> is known to prevent some community detection algorithms from accurately identifying the modular structure of a network. In fact, any global objective function for measuring the quality of a two-level assignment of nodes into modules must have some sort of <b>resolution</b> <b>limit</b> or an external resolution parameter. However, it is yet unknown how the <b>resolution</b> <b>limit</b> affects the so-called map equation, which is known to be an efficient objective function for community detection. We derive an analytical estimate and conclude that the <b>resolution</b> <b>limit</b> of the map equation is set by the total number of links between modules instead of the total number of links in the full network as for modularity. This mechanism makes the <b>resolution</b> <b>limit</b> much less restrictive for the map equation than for modularity, and in practice orders of magnitudes smaller. Furthermore, we argue that the effect of the <b>resolution</b> <b>limit</b> often results from shoehorning multi-level modular structures into two-level descriptions.
