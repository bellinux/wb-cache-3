2500|$|Three of {{the major}} music labels, Universal Music, EMI and Warner Bros. Records, and several smaller audiophile labels (such as AIX Records, Claudio Records, DTS Entertainment and OgreOgress productions) have {{released}} or are continuing to release albums on DVD-Audio, but the number is minimal compared to standard CDs. New high-definition titles have been released in standard DVD-Video format (which can contain two-channel <b>Linear</b> <b>PCM</b> audio data ranging from 48kHz/16-bit to 96kHz/24-bit), [...] "HDAD", which includes a DVD-Video format recording {{on one side and}} DVD-Audio on the other, CD/DVD packages, which can include the album on both CD and DVD-Audio, or DualDisc, which can contain DVD-Audio content on the DVD side.

40|$|International audienceUsing {{a series}} of ab initio approaches, we {{investigate}} the optical spectra of recently synthesised fluorescent bis-coumarins (Tasior et al., 2014). We show that the complex absorption spectra of several derivatives originate in the overlapping of contributions from energetically-close excited-states. These states have been carefully characterised using TD-DFT, ADC(2) and CC 2 levels of theory and accounting for solvent effects using the corrected <b>linear</b> response <b>PCM</b> scheme. We show how such a refined protocol is both necessary and useful to investigate photophysics of these bis-coumarins. In addition {{to an analysis of}} the nature of the excited-states of these systems, the vibrationally-resolved spectrum was determined for the parent molecule. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

50|$|ATRAC was devised for MiniDisc so {{that the}} same amount of audio a CD can carry can fit on a disc far smaller than the CD (which {{contains}} uncompressed 16-bit stereo <b>linear</b> <b>PCM</b> audio).
