50|$|The FWD is {{designed}} to impart a load pulse to the pavement surface which simulates the load produced by a rolling vehicle wheel. The load is produced by dropping a large weight, and transmitted to the pavement through a circular <b>load</b> <b>plate</b> - typically 300 mm diameter on roads and 450 mm on airports. A load cell mounted {{on top of the}} <b>load</b> <b>plate</b> measures the load imparted to the pavement surface. The <b>load</b> <b>plate</b> can be solid or segmented. The advantage of a segmented <b>load</b> <b>plate</b> is that it adopts to the shape of the pavement, giving an even distribution of the load on uneven surfaces. Typically, the load for road testing is about 50 kN giving about 700 kPa pressure under the <b>load</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Prescott and Cedar Mill Pentium 4 cores, {{as well as}} the Smithfield and Presler Pentium D cores, {{used the}} LGA 775 socket. In July 2006, Intel {{released}} the desktop processor Core 2 Duo (codenamed Conroe), which also uses this socket, as does the subsequent Core 2 Quad. Intel changed from Socket 478 to LGA 775 because the new pin type offers better power distribution to the processor, allowing the front-side bus to be raised to 1600 MT/s. The 'T' in Socket T was derived from the now cancelled Tejas core, which was to replace the Prescott core. Another advantage for Intel with this newer architecture is that it is now the motherboard which has the pins, rather than the CPU, transferring the risk of pins being bent from the CPU to the motherboard.The CPU is pressed into place by a [...] "load plate", rather than human fingers directly. The installer lifts the hinged [...] "load plate", inserts the processor, closes the <b>load</b> <b>plate</b> {{over the top of the}} processor, and pushes down a locking lever. The pressure of the locking lever on the <b>load</b> <b>plate</b> clamps the processor's 775 copper contact points firmly down onto the socket's 775 pins, ensuring a good connection. The <b>load</b> <b>plate</b> only covers the edges of the top surface of the CPU (integrated heat spreader). The center is free to make contact with the cooling device placed on top of the CPU. The spacing for the CPU cooler mounting holes is 72mm x 72mm.|$|E

Early M123s had a larger fifth wheel mounted above the frame rails, but as more standard trailers were used the M123C and all following models had lowered fifth wheels. The pin remained larger, so any trailer towed by any M123 had to have an interchangeable pin.|$|E

The crack pattern obtained using the BC extracted from the <b>loading</b> <b>plates</b> (Fig.  9 a) is not in good agreement with the experimental one, while the one obtained using the BC extracted from the sample (Fig.  9 b) is much closer to reality.|$|R
50|$|Deflection sensors (geophones; force-balance seismometers) mounted {{radially}} {{from the}} center of the <b>load</b> <b>plate</b> measure the deformation of the pavement in response to the load. Some typical offsets are 0mm, 200mm, 300mm, 450mm, 600mm, 900mm, 1200mm 1500mm. The deflections measured at these sensors are termed D0, D200, D300 etc. The advantages of seismometers compared to geophones are built-in calibration devices and higher range (5 mm vs 2 mm). Geophones are more sensitive to disturbance immediately before the impact since the initial error is integrated. Geophones however are much cheaper than seismometers. Dynatest, Carl Bro, Jils and PaveTesting use geophones while KUAB have seismometers in their standard FWD's and geophones in their low-cost models.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{different}} types of load impact systems; single-mass (e.g. Dynatest, Carl Bro, PaveTesting) and double-mass (KUAB). In a single-mass system, a weight is dropped onto a single buffer connected to a <b>load</b> <b>plate,</b> which rests on the surface being tested. The load force is transferred through the plate, and the plate creates a deflection that simulates a wheel load. In the double-mass system, the weight drops onto a double-buffer system, which includes a first buffer, a second weight, and a second buffer. The double-mass system essentially produces a longer loading duration that more precisely representsa wheel load. The double-mass system has higher reproducibility and gives a more accurate result on pavements built on soft soils. The single-mass system will seriously overestimate the capacity of pavements built on soft soils. However, single-mass FWDs are smaller, cheaper and faster. Low-cost FWD:s for the Indian market are currently (2015) being developed independently by Geotran, PaveTesting and KUAB.|$|E
50|$|Many analysts use {{simplified}} {{methods to}} calculate related parameters that are empirical in nature. The most common is maximum deflection under {{the centre of}} the <b>load</b> <b>plate</b> (D0) which is related to empirical measures such as the Benkelman Beam deflection (after minor adjustment for differences in the two devices). Historically some used the radius of curvature (D0-D200) but this is out of favour now because {{it is clear that the}} steel loading plate of 300mm diameter affects the shape of the deflection bowl between the centre (D0) and the D200 sensor at 200mm. However this means that a lot of useful information about the shape of the deflected bowl is wasted. Horak and Emery have published indices that use this information: BLI=D0-D300 and gives an indication of the basecourse performance, MLI = D300-D600 and gives an indication of the subbase performance, and LLI=D600-D900 and gives an indication of subgrade performance. These and other similar indices are known as shape factors. The FWD data can also be very useful in helping the engineer divide the length of the pavement into homogeneous sections.|$|E

This socket also introduces a new method of connecting the heat dissipation interface to the chip surface and motherboard. With LGA 775, the heat dissipation interface is connected directly to the motherboard on four points, compared with the two connections of the Socket 370 and the [...] "clamshell" [...] four-point connection of the Socket 478. This was done to avoid the reputed danger of the heat sinks/fans of pre-built computers falling off in transit. LGA 775 was announced to have better heat dissipation properties than the Socket 478 it was designed to replace, but the Prescott core CPUs (in their early incarnations) ran much hotter than the previous Northwood-core Pentium 4 CPUs, and this initially neutralized the benefits of better heat transfer. However, modern Core 2 processors run at much lower temperatures than the Prescott CPUs they replace.|$|E

40|$|A {{model of}} {{electrical}} conduction through clay-coated, silt-sized quartz-grains inter-connected by clay-bridges (e. g. brickearth) is developed. Underpinned by SEM studies of brickearth, the model predicts resistivity to be {{proportional to the}} size of the quartz-grains, where the resistance afforded by clay grain-coatings and clay-bridges is comparable. The model accommodates resistivity that increases through bridge breakage and decreases through bridge compression. The resistivity of in-situ undisturbed brickearth was found to be in the range 15 to 35 ohm-m. At such low values we demonstrate that electrical flow is dominated by conduction within clay-coatings and their interconnecting clay-bridges, rather than in mobile pore-water. A small electrode array, buried at shallow depth beneath the <b>load</b> <b>plate</b> (1. 0 m by 1. 0 m) of a field collapse experiment, monitored resistivity to a depth of 1. 5 m over a 260 hour period. While the water level beneath the <b>load</b> <b>plate</b> remained below 1. 0 m depth, the resulting 3 D inverted resistivity models detected water injected immediately beneath the plate; recording rapid increases, in stages over 90 minutes, in the depth interval 0. 45 to 0. 75 m directly under the plate, during what appears to be collapse. These increases are attributed to breaking of clay-bridges weakened by injected water. ...|$|E

The internal surface of the panel is cooled by high pressure helium as that is cooled to - 423 F by liquid helium heat exchangers. An array of twelve independently controlled fans circulate the high pressure gaseous helium to provide uniform cooling on the panel surface.

As the load increased further, the inclined cracks progressed both upward toward the applied <b>load</b> <b>plate</b> and horizontally along the longitudinal reinforcement toward the support (see Fig.  3).

Because the initial gap distance h 0 is the same as the non-bonded cutoff radius between the rigid plate atoms and the CG beads (Table  1), any displacement of the plate toward the particle results in an axial loading via the repulsive energy potential; thus, there is no loading slack in the system when ϵ[*]=[*] 0.

The structural model is considered {{based on the}} classical plate theory and the von Karman strain-displacement relations are utilized to involve the nonlinear behavior of the plate.
