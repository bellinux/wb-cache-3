5000|$|In God We Trust, Inc. is a {{hardcore}} punk EP by the Dead Kennedys; {{it is now}} reissued with Plastic Surgery Disasters. The album, {{which was}} the band's first recording with drummer D.H. Peligro, spends the first two tracks attacking organized religion before going on to attack such diverse topics as Neo Nazis, President Ronald Reagan, the pesticide Kepone, {{and the kind of}} governmental indifference that vastly worsened the effects of catastrophes like the Minamata disease. [...] "We've Got a Bigger Problem Now" [...] is a lounge jazz remake of [...] "California Über Alles" [...] from the previous album with Ronald Reagan instated in place of Jerry Brown. The EP also includes a cover of the theme song from the 1960s show, Rawhide. The album cover depicts a golden Jesus crucified on a cross of dollar bills, with a background of a shiny metal material. On the original vinyl version, Side A was tracks 1-5 and Side B was tracks 6-8.

There is a consensus amongst most economic and political analysts that approximately 40 % of South Africans are living in poverty—with the poorest 15 % in a desperate struggle to survive. This means that approximately 18 million out of 45 million people have not experienced the benefits of our newly found freedom. This poses a moral challenge to all South Africans—to work together towards the economic and social integration of the poorer section of our fellow citizens. —Poverty and Inequality in South Africa 2004 – 2014, Ecumenical Foundation of Southern Africa On the Rialto, tourists eye the wares of three of the continent’s diasporic sons, young men in dreadlocks and caps, touting leather bags and laser toys in the subdued dialect of those whose papers never are correct, homeboys now in crowded high-rise rooms edging the embroidered city… …Into the city we have come for centuries, buyers, sellers, mercenaries, spies, artists, saints, the banished, and boys like these: fast on their feet, carrying sacks of counterfeit goods, shining in saturated light, the mobile inheritors of any renaissance. —From Merchants in Venice by Ingrid de Kok This page <b>left</b> <b>intentionally</b> <b>blank.</b> ~Page v...|$|E

Probe is a based on a hierarchy of Ten 15 data structures: data structures which manipulate the persistent store; which are used as a basis for database and bulk data structures; and a programming notation which provides a seamless programming environment for the abstract machine that Probe provides.

40|$|This {{page was}} <b>left</b> <b>intentionally</b> <b>blank</b> Abstract i Population growth in Perth has {{increased}} the pressure for coastal recreational, industrial and residential coastal development. Coastal planners need knowledge of the Perth Metropolitan Beaches to determine if, and where, coastal modification is required. Previous shoreline studies have been site-specific, incorporating a variety of approaches. This project aims to use one consistent morphodynamic method to characterise the Perth Metropolitan Coast from Two Rocks to Silver Sands. The objectives {{of this study are}} to: 1) simulate wave processes; 2) classify the beach types; and 3) determine long-term shoreline response. A combination of numerical modelling, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and field methods were used to meet these objectives. The longshore variation in wave climate and exposure was determined for 2003 – 2004 using SWAN (Simulating Waves Nearshore). Each of the 100 identified beaches was characterised by a field visit. Visual identification of the morphologic beach type was based on the classifications of Wright and Short (1984) an...|$|E
