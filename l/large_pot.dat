5|$|The Adbhuta Ramayana narrates: Ravana used {{to store}} the blood of sages he killed in a <b>large</b> <b>pot.</b> The sage Gritsamada was {{practicing}} penance to acquire the goddess Lakshmi as his daughter. He stored milk from Darbha grass and purified it with mantras in a pot so that Lakshmi would inhabit it. Ravana poured the milk from this pot into his blood pot. Mandodari is frustrated seeing the evil deeds of Ravana, so she decides to commit suicide by drinking {{the contents of the}} blood-pot, which is described to be more poisonous than poison. Instead of dying, Mandodari gets pregnant with the incarnation of Lakshmi due to the power of Gritsamada's milk. Mandodari buries the foetus in Kurukshetra, where it is discovered by Janaka, who named her Sita.|$|E

The second hunter (Mizar) carries a <b>large</b> <b>pot</b> — the star Alcor — on his shoulder in which to cook the bear while the third hunter (Alkaid) hauls a pile of firewood to light a fire beneath the pot.|$|E
25|$|The Fenjaan {{consisted}} of a <b>large</b> <b>pot</b> full of water and a bowl with a small hole in the center. When the bowl became full of water, it would sink into the pot, and the manager would empty the bowl and again {{put it on the}} top of the water in the pot. He would record the number of times the bowl sank by putting small stones into a jar. The place where the clock was situated, and its managers, were collectively known as khaneh Fenjaan. Usually this would be the top floor of a public-house, with west- and east-facing windows to show the time of Sunset and Sunrise. There was also another time-keeping tool named a staryab or astrolabe, but it was mostly used for superstitious beliefs and was not practical for use as a farmers' calendar. The Zeebad Gonabad water clock was in use until 1965 when it was substituted by modern clocks.|$|E
25|$|The broth for {{the dish}} {{can be either}} a mixture of two broths, made from beef tripe and brisket, respectively, or gomtang, a thin soup with a rich flavor made by {{simmering}} beef bones for a long time. If choosing the first type, the beef tripe and brisket have to be boiled separately because beef tripe has strong flavor that can affect the brisket broth and the meat. To make the beef tripe broth, cleaned beef tripe, onions, scallions, garlic, and ginger are placed in a <b>large</b> <b>pot</b> with {{a large amount of}} water and boiled until thoroughly cooked. Likewise, the brisket broth is prepared using the same method, using the same secondary ingredients to remove any bad odors that might persist. After that, both broths are chilled, and any fat floating on the surface is skimmed off. The cooked brisket is cut into bite-sized pieces, while the yang and gopchang are cut into long, diagonal strips. The boiled beef tripe and brisket are marinated with seasonings and kneaded for a long time.|$|E

50|$|Pot-in-pot {{is a type}} {{of system}} used in plant nurseries. Plants are planted in pots that will {{accommodate}} their point-of-sale size, and those pots are placed into slightly <b>larger</b> <b>pots</b> planted in a field. These pots are usually planted in long rows in large fields. The <b>larger</b> <b>pots</b> are usually connected to a central irrigation system, and often fertilized through this system as well. When the plants have grown to their point-of-sale size, they can be removed in their pots and sold immediately. The <b>larger</b> <b>pots</b> (also called socket pots) remain in the field to be reused. This system allows growers to offset labor costs associated with planting and re-planting in the field with a significant initial investment.|$|R
25|$|It's often {{recommended}} that A.sesquipedale be grown under warm to intermediate conditions and given as much light as possible without burning the leaves. The choice of growing {{the plant in}} intermediate or warm housing conditions can affect {{the timing of the}} flowering. In order to stimulate heavy flower production {{it is important that the}} light intensity be greatest between September and November. The number of flower spikes present during flowering is dependent on the number of new leaf-pairs formed during the preceding spring and summer, since each newly formed leaf-pair produce one spike and rarely two. Angraecum sesquipedale is commonly found to have a slow growth habit, but the orchid can be expected to produce flowers even before it has reached an adult size. Angraecum sesquipedale is notorious for having sensitive roots. The roots of mature plants are best left undisturbed as much as possible and as a result it is prudent to be especially careful during repotting. Young plants however are less susceptible to such root problems. Disturbing the roots can cause the plant to sulk for 2 to 4 years or even to cause it to die. When a mature plant is disturbed it frequently loses many of its lower leaves and reverts to only producing one or two flowers at a time. To avoid these problems it is commonly advised that the orchid be planted in a coarse medium such as fir bark, crock, or charcoal to minimize disturbances to the roots. Also planting it in a basket or <b>large</b> <b>pot</b> is best since this allows the orchid to grow for many years before having to have its roots disturbed.|$|E
500|$|Maqluba means [...] "upside down" [...] in Arabic, {{and it is}} a dish {{made with}} a meat, fried {{vegetables}} and rice. The dish is cooked with the meat {{at the bottom of a}} <b>large</b> <b>pot,</b> then layered with fried vegetables, such as potatoes, carrots, cauliflower and eggplant. Rice is then added to the dish as it completes cooking. When served, Maqluba is flipped upside down with the meat now at the top, hence the name.

The plot unfolds through graphic novel-esque cut scenes that also contain mini games, {{though they are}} not the same as the quick-time event game-play of the console version. The story is divided into five acts (which is further divided into 26 [...] "episodes"). The protagonist of the 3DS/Wii version is not Jack, but rather a down-on-his-luck stock car racer named [...] "Matt". The premise remains mostly unchanged (a coast-to-coast race with a <b>large</b> <b>pot</b> at stake), but introduces a female character who takes the story in a different direction.

It needs <b>large</b> <b>pots</b> to do well, and temporary halts in growth are often due to becoming root-bound. Re-potting to a <b>larger</b> <b>pot</b> will often result in a rapid size increase.

In Tajikistan and Afghanistan they sing: Samanak dar Jūsh u mā Kafcha zanēm - Dīgarān dar Khwāb u mā Dafcha zanēm.

2500|$|Epiphany is the [...] "water sanctification" [...] {{the dive}} of the Cross in {{imitation}} of the Baptism of Christ. But in Greek ethimology, that Sanctification {{is the notion of}} expiation, purification of the people and the exemption from the influence of demons. The most recently this concept is certainly not strictly Christian, but has roots in ancient worship. In most parts of Greece sanctification for the first time (in those days) the eve of Epiphany called [...] "small sanctification" [...] or [...] "Protagiasi" [...] or [...] "Enlightenment". By protagiasi the priest turns all the houses and the Cross and one strand royal [...] "sanctifies" [...] or [...] "brighten" [...] (sprinkling) rooms of houses.

Then, a dive of Cross Sea or nearby river or lake or the need to tank (as in Athens). Diving the Cross, according to popular belief gives the water cleansing and sanitizing capabilities. The inhabitants of many areas after diving run on sea beaches or along rivers or lakes and wash their agricultural tools and even icons. In common folk belief even the icons {{with the passage of time}} lose their original strength and value to the gain but again the holy water. It is this process not only exactly true survival of ancient beliefs. The ancient example Athenians had the ceremony (procedure) of known [...] "Wash" [...] as it was called at that carried [...] "in procession" [...] on the Faliro coast of the statue of Athena.
