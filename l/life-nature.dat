A program by <b>Life-Nature</b> is set up with the aim of increasing the overall area of grasslands and improving the conditions of the already existing ones. This project is co-financed by the European Union. A problem for the majority of these areas is that they are not grazed sufficiently or not grazed properly. This leads other plant species to thrive and take over, causing the dry grassland plant species to have a lack of natural resources that are needed for survival. The aim of this program is to get rid of the overgrowth, as well as start and maintain proper grazing in the future. Besides this, it is also equally important to make the public (more) aware of these areas and the problems that they are facing. This can be done by organizing field trips to the areas so that the people can witness it themselves.|$|E

Second, new mechanisms are required to set conservation priorities in a dynamic fashion, rather than relying on fixed lists (i. e., the Directives’ Annexes) that may rapidly become outdated.

Counts {{of the number of}} nests were also recorded to estimate productivity as average number of fledglings per breeding pair. Our field study was done at two locations at the western Mediterranean (Columbretes and Benidorm Islands) where small and isolated colonies of Yellow-legged Gulls (Larus cachinnans michahellis) occur. Estimates derived from direct counts were assumed to be relatively unbiased because of the small size of the study islands. We found that mark-recapture provided accurate results (similar to those obtained by counting flocks) only when mortality of chicks between capture and counts was low. Whenever both methods are applicable we recommend using flock counts to estimate productivity because it requires less input from the researcher and has little or no disturbance cost for the gulls.

During a flooding period, we sampled the fish population and the macroinvertebrate community in three contrasting habitats: mats of green algae, open water, and a habitat dominated by glasswort (Salicornia patula) that is occasionally inundated. The three habitats displayed strong variation in density and species composition of invertebrates in the water column and the benthos. In general, algal mats had higher invertebrate biomasses, but glasswort had higher diversity of organisms, in part of terrestrial origin. The density of toothcarp was very low in the open water. The habitat that is occasionally inundated (glasswort) significantly had the highest density of mature toothcarp, while immature fish were similarly abundant in the glasswort and algal mat habitats. Condition (weight-length relationship) and total food biomass in the gut contents of immature toothcarp was significantly higher in algal mats than in glasswort, whereas there were no such differences for mature fish.

40|$|The {{influence}} of hydrology, nutrient composition, food resource availability and predation on zooplankton taxonomic and size diversity was analyzed in several shallow lagoons of a Mediterranean salt marsh (Baix Ter Wetlands, NE Iberian Peninsula). Taxonomic diversity correlated better with {{variables related to}} the trophic state, such as nutrient concentrations, whereas size diversity was more sensitive to fish predation. However, the fish predation influence on the size diversity was only significant when fishes reached high densities. Under low fish densities no predation effects were observed and the food resource availability (FRa) appeared {{to be more important}} in structuring the zooplankton community. Nevertheless, the two diversity indexes showed opposite responses to this factor. With increasing FRa the taxonomic diversity increased and the size diversity decreased. Neither taxonomic nor size diversity of the zooplankton community correlated with other physical or biotic factors such as hydrological variability or macroinvertebrate predation. The relationships found suggest that the size diversity is mainly related to biotic interactions, such as fish predation or inter/intraspecific competition, while the taxonomic diversity appears to be more sensitive to abiotic factors such as the nutrient composition. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{choice of}} {{sampling}} methods to survey saproxylic beetles {{is a key}} aspect to assessing conservation strategies {{for one of the}} most endangered assemblages in Europe. We evaluated the efficiency of three sampling methods: baited tube traps (TT), window traps in front of a hollow opening (WT), and emergence traps covering tree hollows (ET) to study richness and diversity of saproxylic beetle assemblages at species and family levels in Mediterranean woodlands. We also examined trap efficiency to report ecological diversity, and changes in the relative richness and abundance of species forming trophic guilds: xylophagous, saprophagous/saproxylophagous, xylomycetophagous, predators and commensals. WT and ET were similarly effective in reporting species richness and diversity at species and family levels, and provided an accurate profile of both the flying active and hollow-linked saproxylic beetle assemblages. WT and ET were the most complementary methods, together reporting more than 90 % of richness and diversity at both species and family levels. Diversity, richness and abundance of guilds were better characterized by ET, which indicates higher efficiency in outlining the ecological community of saproxylics that inhabit tree hollows. TT were the least effective method at both taxonomic levels, sampling a biased portion of the beetle assemblage attracted to trapping principles, however they could be used as a specific method for families such as Bostrichiidae, Biphyllidae, Melyridae, Mycetophagidae or Curculionidae Scolytinae species.

40|$|The “dehesa” is a {{traditional}} Iberian agrosilvopastoral ecosystem characterized {{by the presence of}} old scattered trees that are considered as “keystone-structures”, which favor the presence {{of a wide range of}} biodiversity. We show the high diversity of saproxylic beetles and syrphids (Diptera) in this ecosystem, including red-listed species. We analyzed whether saproxylic species distribution in the “dehesa” was affected by tree density per hectare, dominant tree species or vegetation coverage. Species diversity did not correlate with tree density; however, it was affected by tree species and shrub coverage but in a different way for each taxon. The highest beetle diversity was linked to Quercus pyrenaica, the most managed tree species, with eight indicator species. In contrast, Q. rotundifolia hosted more species of saproxylic syrphids. Regarding vegetation coverage, shrub coverage was the only variable that affected insect richness, again in a different way for both taxa. In contrast, beetle species composition was only affected by dominant tree species whereas syrphid species composition was not affected by tree species or shrub coverage. We concluded that the high diversity of saproxylic insects in the “dehesa” is related to its long history of agrosilvopastoral management, which has generated landscape heterogeneity and preserved old mature trees. However, the richness and composition of different taxa of insects respond in different ways to tree species and vegetation coverage. Consequently, conservation strategies should try to maintain traditional management, and different saproxylic taxa should be used to monitor the effect of management on saproxylic diversity.

This area is a Nature 2000 site and {{is considered to be}} a hotspot for European marine biodiversity. In 2005, the management plan of the park was implemented, ending several habitat menaces, thereby allowing an application to the <b>LIFE—NATURE</b> Programme. The LIFE-BIOMARES project aimed at the restoration and management of the biodiversity of the marine park through several actions. The restoration of the seagrass prairies that were completely destroyed by fishing activities and recreational boating, was one of the most challenging. It included the transplanting of seagrasses from donor populations and the germination of seagrass seeds for posterior plantation to maintain genetic diversity in the transplanted area. One of the most popular actions was the implementation of environmental friendly moorings to integrate recreational use of the area with environmental protection. Several dissemination and environmental education actions concerning the marine park and the project took place and contributed to the public increase of the park acceptance. The seabed habitats were mapped along the park and a surrounding area to 100 m depth in order to create a habitat cartography of the park and to help locate alternative fishing zones. Biodiversity assessments for macrofauna revealed seasonal variations and an effect of the protection status. Preliminary results are presented and show that the marine park regulations are having a positive effect on biodiversity conservation and sustainable fisheries, thereby showing that these kind of conservation projects are important to disseminate coastal conservation best practices.

40|$|Asphodelus bento-rainhae P. Silva is a {{plant species}} {{belonging}} {{to the order of}} Liliales. This endemic plant occurs in central Portugal in an area of only 700 hectare on the northern slopes of the Serra da Gardunha (Fundão, Portugal). It is mainly present in north to northeast facing slopes and found in deep soils and open areas, where it is found at higher densities. It occurs along the edges of oak (Quercus robur and Quercus pyrenaica) and chestnut (Castanea sativa) forests, often reaching the herbaceous edges of these woods. Sometimes, it survives in pine forests of Pinus pinaster, mixed woods and slopes or roadsides and in lower abundances in scrubby vegetation. This species survival is threatened by forest fires and the conversion of woodland into cherry orchards, and the fruit growers’ extensive use of herbicides. The tree plantations, as well as urban sprawl, have decreased the extent and quality of its habitat. It is also confronted with invasive plants, such as Acacia dealbata. The mapping of the A. bento-rainhae habitat suitability index results on the integration of a set of biophysical factors using the ArcGIS 10. 3 software, based on the Sectorial Plan for Natura 2000 Network and other literature concerning the species ecology. The data used included bioclimatic, soil and topographic variables, based on a digital terrain model (DTM). All the geographic themes (criteria) were classified into three suitability levels: unfavorable, less favorable and favorable. Based on the resulting reclassified themes, the Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) for A. bento-rainhae P. Silva was calculated using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The fundamental concept of AHP lies in proceeding from a pairwise comparison of criteria to evaluate the weights that assign relative importance to these criteria.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{determinants}} of colony site dynamics in Audouin's gull, Larus audouinii, breeding in a small archipelago of the western Mediterranean. Data on island occupation were available {{for a series of}} 25 years, since first colonization of the archipelago in 1973. Group behavior was studied in relation to the components of dispersal: permanence or abandonment (extinction) on an island previously occupied and permanence or occupation (colonization) of another island. Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) were used to identify the relative contribution of each explanatory variable to the probability of colony abandonment. Gulls showed a low probability (3 %) of abandoning one of the islands (Grossa I.), especially when the colony was increasing in numbers from time ti- 1 to ti. However, the probability of abandoning Grossa increased up to 31 % when the colony was declining. The probability of island abandonment was very high for all other islands (range 66 - 99 %) when the colony was declining, but much lower (range 36 - 82 %) when it was increasing. Hence, we suggest that island abandonment by Audouin's gull is at least a two-step process. The first step (dispersal of a portion of the colony) probably takes place at random, as an evolutionary load typical of a species evolved in unstable habitats. The second step, a further loss of breeding pairs, seems to feedback on the first loss of members of the colony (public information), likely perceived as a loss of colony quality. Colonization of islands by gulls abandoning Grossa I. was marginally and negatively affected by the density of breeding yellow-legged gulls, a predatory species. Results apply to conservation ecology since they highlight the need to protect not only occupied patches but also those empty at present.
