The label provides important information {{on the use of the}} medicines, which helps the users to make correct use of their medicines. However, legibility is often a problem encountered in the labeling of small packages like eye/ear drops. The consumers as well as health professionals find labels difficult to read because of a number of reasons such as very small <b>letters,</b> poor <b>quality</b> of <b>printing</b> and poor colour contrast.

50|$|ImageWriter LQ (<b>Letter</b> <b>Quality)</b> was a 27-pin {{dot matrix}} printer {{introduced}} in 1987 by Apple Computer. The <b>print</b> <b>quality</b> was comparable to competing 24-pin dot-matrix printers, and offered graphics at 320 × 216 DPI. Unlike the ImageWriter II, the LQ was unreliable and noisy.

50|$|When {{designing}} for photo <b>quality</b> <b>printing,</b> graphic {{designers and}} printers start with high resolution images of 2400 dpi or higher. Traditional full color non-photo <b>quality</b> <b>printing</b> is done from images of 1200 dpi or less. Photo <b>quality</b> <b>printing</b> requires images {{to contain the}} most amount of color information possible. The high resolution images used in photo <b>quality</b> <b>printing</b> is saved in a CMYK file format to best utilize either the commercial printing process or inkjet <b>printing</b> photo <b>quality</b> output capabilities. CMYK dots of Cyan (blue), Magenta (red), Yellow, and Black are placed {{next to each other}} in specific patterns that trick the eye into seeing millions of colors. Photo <b>quality</b> inkjet <b>printing</b> transfers 4 or more toner colors to the substrate in a single cycle through the printer. In photo <b>quality</b> commercial <b>printing</b> each color of ink is applied separately.|$|R

40|$|Variations in offset <b>print</b> <b>quality</b> {{relate to}} {{numerous}} parameter of printing press and paper. To maintain constant quality of products, press operators need to assess, explore and monitor <b>print</b> <b>quality.</b> This paper presents a novel system for assessing and predicting values of <b>print</b> <b>quality</b> attributes, where the adopted, random forests (RF) -based, modeling approach also allows quantifying {{the influence of}} different parameters. In contrast to other <b>print</b> <b>quality</b> assessment systems, this system utilizes common print marks known as double grey-bars. A novel virtual sensor for assessing the mis-registration degree of printing plates using images of double grey-bars is presented.

40|$|Abstract � Printability {{of paper}} is a multidimensional concept {{consisting}} of runnability and <b>print</b> <b>quality.</b> The lack of definition for <b>print</b> <b>quality</b> makes printability rather ambiguous. In this {{paper we discuss}} the measurability of the high-level printability and <b>print</b> <b>quality</b> and present {{an interpretation of the}} measurements of low-level <b>print</b> <b>quality</b> related characteristics as information channels about highlevel concepts. This enables the construction of a layered model in which the information provided by measurements is propagated to infer about higher level concepts of quality, eventually supporting decision making. As an example, we present a case study of low-level <b>print</b> <b>quality</b> defects caused by the small-scale measurable properties of the paper, and consider the meaning of this process from the viewpoint of <b>print</b> <b>quality</b> analysis...|$|R
50|$|Technical {{quality was}} an {{important}} aspect of the production. Silent films had often been screened on television from poor-quality copies running at an inaccurate speed, usually accompanied by honky tonky piano music. Hollywood used silent film clips sourced from the best available material, shown at their original running speed and with an orchestral score, giving viewers a chance to see what they originally looked and sounded like. For instance, the first episode features a clip of Life of an American Fireman, produced in 1903 with the aforementioned stereotypical poor <b>quality</b> <b>print</b> and music and then compares that with a clip of The Fire Brigade, produced in over two decades later in 1926, in a high <b>quality</b> <b>print</b> run at the proper speed with full orchestral accompaniment.|$|R

40|$|This paper aims {{to develop}} an {{understanding}} of the factors affecting <b>print</b> <b>quality</b> in inkjet <b>printed</b> textiles and discusses tools for quantifying <b>print</b> <b>quality</b> in these textiles. Cotton fabrics with different fabric structures, yarn sizes, yarn types, and surface treatments were printed on a commercial desktop inkjet printer. <b>Print</b> <b>quality</b> (PQ) analyses were performed using an automated <b>print</b> <b>quality</b> analysis system to quantify quality attributes including line width, image noise, optical density, tone reproduction and CIELab color. Wicking tests were also conducted to elucidate the correlation between the observed <b>print</b> <b>quality</b> and the wicking behavior of the fabric structure. An image processing technique was developed to enhance the accuracy and reliability of <b>print</b> <b>quality</b> measurements and minimize the “noise ” introduced by the structure of the fabric. The results of this study provide some insight into the relationship between structure and printability in inkjet printing of textile fabrics. The efficacy of the automated PQ analysis instrument used is also demonstrated...|$|R

40|$|<b>Print</b> <b>quality</b> is a {{composite}} attribute defined by human perception. <b>Quality</b> <b>printing</b> is {{a key factor in}} improving the appearance of the publications in general and education in particular. There are several new technologies that have emerged recently to achieve this important objective.
