50|$|For {{some time}} the Great Western Railway, quite {{independently}} of the South Wales Railway, had taken {{an interest in the}} developing collieries near Gyfeillon, in the Rhondda a little west of Pontypridd, where excellent quality steam coal was being extracted. In 1854 the GWR had leased a colliery belonging to John Calvert, using it to supply <b>locomotive</b> <b>coal.</b> It became known as the Great Western Mine.|$|E
5000|$|In 1857 a {{competitive}} threat emerged when the Ely Valley Railway was incorporated, {{to build a}} broad gauge line from Llantrisant, on the South Wales Railway between Cardiff and Bridgend, towards the Rhondda valley. It opened in August 1860 as far as Tonyrefail, and in 1862 it was extended to Penygraig, close to the Taff Vale Railway at Tonypandy. It was leased to the Great Western Railway from 1 January 1861; the GWR wanted it {{as a source for}} <b>locomotive</b> <b>coal,</b> and the lease was independent of the local broad gauge railway, the South Wales Railway.|$|E
25|$|There {{seems to}} be no {{evidence}} for <b>locomotive</b> <b>coaling</b> facilities at Shepherdswell, and tenders were probably filled from the screens at Tilmanstone Colliery.|$|R

50|$|Coaling {{was carried}} out by hand from coal bunkers. Coal was shovelled onto a {{platform}} and from there into the <b>locomotive's</b> <b>coal</b> tank. Later simple cranes or derricks were installed.|$|R
5000|$|Every Bahnbetriebswerk {{had one or}} more coaling {{points for}} the {{delivery}} and unloading of coal. In addition, they had to store the fuel and carry out the replenishment of <b>locomotive</b> <b>coal</b> tanks or tenders.Coaling facilities came in various shapes and sizes, dependent on the daily consumption. Coal was delivered was by rail, either using normal goods wagons or with special self-discharging hoppers. The coal was stored in large bunkers (Kohlebansen) which usually had side walls made of concrete (on smaller Betriebswerke these were also made of old sleepers and section of rail.) Each Bahnbetriebswerk stored the daily coal requirement in a main bunker, {{the rest of the}} coal was stored in one or more reserve bunkers.|$|E
5000|$|The Ely Valley company found favour in the proposals; the {{cheapest}} {{way to make}} the physical connection would be over the South Wales Railway main line between Llantrisant and a point immediately west of Cardiff station, joining the Penarth line there. The talks seemed to be progressing well, but were abandoned by the Ely Valley company abruptly, and shortly afterwards the Great Western Railway (not the South Wales Railway) leased the Ely Valley line, in order to secure access to its <b>locomotive</b> <b>coal</b> colliery at Gyfeillon. Daniel Gooch wrote, [...] "Our object in taking the line would be chiefly for getting a connection to our own colliery and also to get, some day, into the steam coal not yet opened out."The lease was effective from 1 January 1861. On 2 August 1860 the Ely Valley Railway had opened its main line from Llantrisant to Penrhiwfer.|$|E
50|$|In 1921 the Federal Royal Commission into Standard Gauge had {{recommended}} that the mainland States of Australia and the Australian Government commit themselves to providing a uniform railway network linking the capital cities of Australia with a common gauge. As part of the standardisation of the disparate gauges, a new link between Sydney and Brisbane via Kyogle, New South Wales was identified as being a central element. Queensland in 1924 passed the South Brisbane Kyogle Grafton Act committing itself {{to the construction of}} a new standard gauge railway from South Brisbane railway station to the border with New South Wales. As part of this, New South Wales demanded a bridge over the Clarence River at Grafton and the upgrading of the Kyogle branch. The Australian Government provided half the funding for the project. The interstate standard gauge railway line between Kyogle and South Brisbane opened in 1930. The importance of the Toowoomba-Wallangarra southern line diminished, as the new link via northern New South Wales and the Richmond Gap into Queensland did not involve a change of trains at a border station.During the time of the Second World War the strategic importance of Wallangarra was vital in providing an inland transhipment and staging point during the defence of Australia. Large numbers of workers were employed to tranship goods in the New South Wales section of the yard. The extensive yard and station complex at this time consisted of the station building, closets and horse dock at the southern end of the station platform (the border dock). Refreshment Room staff and ambulance quarters were situated at the north end of the platform. On the western (Queensland) side was a goods office, casual crew quarters with dining room, frame tent and library. To the north-east an engine shed was situated, reserve coal dump, <b>locomotive</b> <b>coal</b> stage, tool room, ASM's residence (1919), ganger's residence (1919) and trucking yards. On the east side (New South Wales) was the Station Master's residence (1887), 25 ton weighbridge, lamp room, waitresses quarters and the footwarmer furnace. Quarters were also provided for laundresses. Most of these ancillary buildings are now removed.|$|E
50|$|A coaling tower, coal {{stage or}} coaling station is a {{facility}} used to load coal as fuel into railway steam <b>locomotives.</b> <b>Coaling</b> towers were often sited at motive power depots or locomotive maintenance shops.|$|R
50|$|Andal Yard {{is one of}} {{the largest}} in Eastern Railway. Coal loaded at various {{colliery}} sidings are hauled to the yard by diesel <b>locomotives.</b> <b>Coal</b> is supplied in rakes to such thermal power plants as at Bakreshwar, Farrakka and Sagardighi. Substantial amounts of coal are dispatched to destination on Northeast Frontier Railway.|$|R
50|$|Soon {{after the}} {{rebuilding}} of these <b>locomotives,</b> <b>coal</b> shortages during World War I called into question the further use of steam locomotives in Switzerland. The Rhaetian Railway therefore decided to electrify all of its lines {{on the model of}} the Engadine Railway, opened in 1914. The electrification project was able to be completed in 1919.|$|R

50|$|An {{important}} {{motive power}} depot was located {{to the west}} of the WCML and was one of the last to retain an allocation of steam locomotives until mid-1968. The buildings are now occupied by the West Coast Railway Company who still maintain and overhaul steam locos in their premises. The concrete <b>locomotive</b> <b>coaling</b> tower is a rare survivor.|$|R
50|$|As {{with the}} steam <b>locomotives,</b> <b>coal</b> fired tugboats {{fell out of}} favor when heavy oils became {{dominant}} as an industrial fuel. The reason BEDT operated their steam locomotives later than any other railroads, is that their tugs were fired by Bunker C fuel as well. It naturally made for simpler logistics to operate all equipment with one type of fuel.|$|R

50|$|It has an {{extensive}} network of railroads, {{and much of}} the coal is transported by rail. The railways were once one of the largest customers for coal to drive the steam locomotives, but these have been replaced by diesel <b>locomotives.</b> <b>Coal</b> is rarely used now for home heating.

50|$|The <b>locomotive's</b> <b>coal</b> bunker had a {{capacity}} of 1 lt t and the side-tanks had a water capacity of 484 imp gal. It had coupled wheels of 31+1/2 in diameter and cylinders of 13 in bore and 15+3/4 in stroke. The total weight of the engine in full working order was 22 lt kg {{and it had a}} tractive effort of 8660 lbf kN at 75% of boiler pressure.|$|R
50|$|The 710 {{class were}} {{built by the}} Islington Railway Workshops as a {{modified}} version of the Armstrong Whitworth built 700 class <b>locomotives.</b> <b>Coal</b> shortages after World War II saw a number converted to burn oil.

The last was withdrawn in September 1967.|$|R
5000|$|Abundant {{timber and}} water along the Bear River made Evanston a {{refueling}} station for cross-country <b>locomotives.</b> <b>Coal</b> was mined {{a few miles}} north of Evanston in Almy. Similar to other railroad towns in Wyoming, early Evanston had a large population of Chinese railroad workers - in Evanston they lived {{on the north side of}} the railroad tracks in a small [...] "China town." [...] Over time, the Chinese population dwindled, disappearing completely in the 1930s.|$|R
50|$|An engine shed, {{turntable}} and <b>locomotive</b> <b>coaling</b> and servicing {{facilities were}} installed by the South Eastern Railway in 1855 {{in the area}} between the Brighton and Tonbridge lines. These facilities were rebuilt by the Southern Railway in 1924 and lasted {{until the end of}} steam in the area in 1965. The site of the depot remained in use as a stabling point for many years after this. The sidings remain in place, but appear to have fallen into disuse in recent years.|$|R
50|$|In New Egypt the Union Transportation Company {{would set}} up its offices in 1888. New Egypt would house the shops, turntable, and water tower for the UT. The {{passenger}} station was the largest on the line, measuring 18 x 50 ft, while the freight house measured 16 x 60 ft. The UT's office building measured 38 x 20 ft. The location had a cattle pen, the Engine house at 31 x 100 ft, including a large coal trestle and a coal shed, with a <b>locomotive</b> <b>coaling</b> platform, engine pit, and a 55 ft turntable.|$|R
50|$|The <b>locomotive</b> <b>coaling</b> {{plant was}} one of the biggest in the country and had opened in 1915. Up to that point all coaling had been done by hand with 36 men being {{employed}} on each shift. It is possible that with the demand on men in the war that women may have been employed in this role as they certainly were in some other depots. The provision of the new coaling plant that could see an engine coaled in seconds, was the solution to congestion in the area caused by the long wait for coal.|$|R
25|$|The four-track shed {{was about}} 150 {{feet long and}} 50 feet wide. It was located north of the running line {{and south of the}} Foss Dyke Navigation. By 1912 an {{additional}} siding was added. In 1914 50 men were recorded as working at the shed. During World War I the increased need for coal saw traffic on the GNGEJR rise, and the sidings and engine shed at Pyewipe Junction were extremely busy. <b>Locomotive</b> <b>coaling</b> was undertaken by hand and although a turntable is evident on plans of the site, it is not known whether it was installed when the shed opened.|$|R

50|$|Due to {{a long-standing}} {{agreement}} between the competing West Coast and East Coast Main Line routes since the famous railway races of 1888 and 1895, speeds of the Scotch expresses were limited, {{the time for the}} 392 mi between the capitals being a pedestrian 8 hours 15 minutes. However, following valve gear modifications, the A1 <b>locomotive's</b> <b>coal</b> consumption was drastically reduced and it was thus found possible to run the service non-stop with a heavy train on one tender full of <b>coal.</b> Ten <b>locomotives</b> of classes A1 and A3, which were to be used on the service, were provided with corridor tenders; these avoided engine crew fatigue by enabling a replacement driver and fireman to take over halfway without stopping the train.|$|R
5000|$|In his writings, Vertov expounded on the {{prominent}} role he envisioned {{for the natural}} resources: “Coal {{comes out of the}} earth. Coal for factories. <b>Coal</b> for <b>locomotives.</b> <b>Coal</b> for coke furnaces. Coal has arrived. The conveyors and sorting machines have started up. The aerial chains of coal-filled carts have begun to move. The blast furnaces are operating at full speed. Metal has arrived. The rolling and open-hearth, rolled, open-hearth, rolled, open-hearth—in a single creative thrust toward socialism.” The film emphasizes the importance of coal in its setting and image content. As mentioned in the film summary, once the setting of the film changes to that of the Donbass region, there are numerous images of coal workers, furnaces, and carts full of coal.|$|R
