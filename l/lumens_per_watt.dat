25|$|California will {{phase out}} {{the use of}} {{incandescent}} bulbs by 2018. The bill aims to establish a minimum standard of twenty-five <b>lumens</b> <b>per</b> <b>watt</b> by 2013 and sixty <b>lumens</b> <b>per</b> <b>watt</b> by 2018.|$|E
25|$|Lamps {{designed}} for different voltages have different luminous efficacy. For example, a 100-watt, 120-volt lamp will produce about 17.1 <b>lumens</b> <b>per</b> <b>watt.</b> A lamp {{with the same}} rated lifetime but {{designed for}} 230 V would produce only around 12.8 <b>lumens</b> <b>per</b> <b>watt,</b> and a similar lamp designed for 30 volts (train lighting) would produce as much as 19.8 <b>lumens</b> <b>per</b> <b>watt.</b> Lower voltage lamps have a thicker filament, for the same power rating. They can run hotter for the same lifetime before the filament evaporates.|$|E
25|$|Incandescent lamps {{have been}} phased {{out over the}} years. They are {{wasteful}} of energy, producing between 15 and 30 <b>lumens</b> <b>per</b> <b>watt</b> of power (out of a possible 683 <b>lumens</b> <b>per</b> <b>watt</b> for an ideal light source). They can be found many times in older aquarium light hoods. They burn out frequently, put {{off a lot of}} heat, and normally do not have an appropriate spectrum associated with them. Most incandescent lamps can be replaced with commonly available and efficient screw in power compact bulbs.|$|E
50|$|The {{three most}} common types of {{incandescent}} lamps are standard incandescent lamps, tungsten halogen lamps, and reflector lamps. Standard incandescent lamps have an efficacy of 10-17 <b>lumens</b> <b>per</b> <b>watts</b> and {{a lifetime of}} 750-2500 hours. Tungsten halogen lamps have an efficacy of 12-22 <b>lumens</b> <b>per</b> <b>watts</b> and a lifetime of 2000-4000 hours. Finally reflector lamps have an efficacy of 12-19 <b>lumens</b> <b>per</b> <b>watts</b> and a lifetime of 2000-3000 hours.|$|R
5000|$|Metal halide lamps. These lamps produce {{almost white}} light, and attain 100 <b>lumen</b> <b>per</b> <b>watt</b> light output. Applications include indoor {{lighting}} of high buildings, parking lots, shops, sport terrains.|$|R
50|$|HQI lamps {{can produce}} {{different}} color temperatures when manufactured with different metal halides. They are relatively efficient light sources producing a high <b>lumen</b> <b>per</b> <b>watt</b> ratio (approximately 6x that of incandescent lamps).|$|R
25|$|The {{timeline}} {{for these}} standards {{was to start}} in January 2012. By 2020, a second tier of restrictions would become effective, which require all general-purpose bulbs to produce at least 45 <b>lumens</b> <b>per</b> <b>watt</b> (similar to current CFLs).|$|E
25|$|The {{efficacy}} of fluorescent tubes ranges from about 16 <b>lumens</b> <b>per</b> <b>watt</b> for a 4 watt tube with an ordinary ballast to over 100 <b>lumens</b> <b>per</b> <b>watt</b> with a modern electronic ballast, commonly averaging 50 to 67lm/W overall. Most compact fluorescents above 13 watts with integral electronic ballasts achieve about 60lm/W. Lamps are rated by lumens after 100 hours of operation. For a given fluorescent tube, a high-frequency electronic ballast gives about a 10% efficacy improvement over an inductive ballast. It {{is necessary to}} include the ballast loss when evaluating the {{efficacy of}} a fluorescent lamp system; this can be about 25% of the lamp power with magnetic ballasts, and around 10% with electronic ballasts.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, the Irish {{government}} announced a phase-out {{of the sale}} of any light bulbs with a luminous efficiency of less than 16 <b>lumens</b> <b>per</b> <b>watt.</b> Shortly afterwards, all member states of the EU agreed to a progressive phase-out of incandescent light bulbs by 2012.|$|E
50|$|In the reaction, {{a reduced}} flavin mononucleotide oxidizes a {{long-chain}} aliphatic aldehyde to an aliphatic carboxylic acid. The reaction forms an excited hydroxyflavin intermediate, which is dehydrated {{to the product}} FMN to emit blue-green light. Nearly all of the energy input into the reaction is transformed into light. The reaction is 80% to 90% efficient. As a comparison, the incandescent light bulb only converts about 10% of its energy into light. and a 150 <b>lumen</b> <b>per</b> <b>Watt</b> (lm/W) LED converts 20% of input energy to visible light.|$|R
5000|$|An {{important}} {{property of}} light fixtures is the luminous efficacy or wall-plug efficiency, meaning {{the amount of}} usable light emanating from the fixture per used energy, usually measured in <b>lumen</b> <b>per</b> <b>watt.</b> A fixture using replaceable light sources can also have its efficiency quoted {{as the percentage of}} light passed from the [...] "bulb" [...] to the surroundings. The more transparent the lighting fixture is, the higher efficacy. Shading the light will normally decrease efficacy but increase the directionality and the visual comfort probability.|$|R
50|$|Luxim's Li-Fi lamp, claims 120 <b>lumens</b> <b>per</b> RF <b>watt</b> (i.e. {{before taking}} into account {{electrical}} losses). The lamp {{has been used in}} Robe lighting's ROBIN 300 Plasma Spot moving headlight. It was also used in a line of, now discontinued, Panasonic rear projection TVs.|$|R
25|$|Standard {{fluorescent}} tubes are the common light bars {{you find in}} commercial ceilings. Fluorescent lighting has more color temperatures available which are more suited to aquariums than those of incandescent bulbs. They are also more efficient than incandescent lighting, averaging between 90 and 95 <b>lumens</b> <b>per</b> <b>watt.</b> The downside to regular fluorescent lights {{is that they do}} not have the intensity to penetrate into deeper aquariums.|$|E
25|$|In February 2007, Australia {{enacted a}} law that will, in effect, by legislating {{efficiency}} standards, disallow most sales of incandescent light bulbs by 2010. The Australian Federal Government announced minimum energy performance standards (MEPS) for lighting products. The new minimum standard efficiency level is 15 <b>lumens</b> <b>per</b> <b>watt</b> (lm/W). From November 2008, no non-compliant lighting (including some incandescent globes) were imported into Australia, and from November 2009, the retail sale of non-compliant lighting was banned.|$|E
25|$|A {{fluorescent}} lamp, or fluorescent tube, is a low-pressure mercury-vapor gas-discharge lamp {{that uses}} fluorescence to produce visible light. An electric current {{in the gas}} excites mercury vapor, which produces short-wave ultraviolet light that then causes a phosphor coating {{on the inside of}} the lamp to glow. A fluorescent lamp converts electrical energy into useful light much more efficiently than incandescent lamps. The typical luminous efficacy of fluorescent lighting systems is 50–100 <b>lumens</b> <b>per</b> <b>watt,</b> several times the efficacy of incandescent bulbs with comparable light output.|$|E
50|$|Haitz's law {{is named}} after Roland Haitz (1935-2015), a {{scientist}} at Agilent Technologies among others. It was first presented to the larger public at Strategies in Light 2000, {{the first of a}} series of annual conferences organized by Strategies Unlimited.Besides the forecast of exponential development of cost <b>per</b> <b>lumen</b> and amount of light per package, the publication also forecast that the efficacy of LED-based lighting could reach 200 lm/W (<b>lumen</b> <b>per</b> <b>Watt)</b> in 2020, crossing 100 lm/W in 2010. This would be the case if enough industrial and government resources were spent for research on LED-lighting. More than 50% of the electricity consumption for lighting (20% of the totally consumed electrical energy) would be saved reaching 200 lm/W. This prospect and other stepping-stone applications of LEDs (e.g. mobile phone flash and LCD-backlighting) led to a massive investment in LED-research so that the LED efficacy did indeed cross 100 lm/W in 2010. If this trend continues, LEDs will become the most efficient light source by 2020.|$|R
40|$|Development {{of energy}} {{efficient}} products and exploration of {{energy saving potential}} are major challenges for present day’s technology. Ceramic Metal Halide lamp is the latest improved version of metal halide lamp that finds its wide applications in indoor commercial lighting especially in retail shop lighting. This lamp shows better performance in terms of higher <b>lumen</b> <b>per</b> <b>watt</b> and colour constancy in comparison to conventional metal halide lamp. The inherent negative incremental impedance of CMH lamp demands the use of current control device in the lamp circuit and perfect matching of lamp ballast combination is required for efficient lamp operation. The electrical and photometric performance of two sets of commercial 70 watt CMH lamp and intregated ballast units were measured to investigate their compatibility for optimum lamp operation. The measured data were utilized to develop an electrical model for lamp ballast combination. Using this model a compatibility index is proposed {{which can be used}} for assessment of lamp performance...|$|R
5000|$|Trouble {{lights are}} {{intended}} {{to be used with}} [...] "rough service bulbs", a form of incandescent light bulbs which are designed with as many as five support wires holding the filament to allow it to withstand heavy vibrations or movement. Lower voltage bulbs such as those intended to function with 12 volt power supplies also have a higher <b>lumen</b> output <b>per</b> <b>watt</b> of power consumption. Compact fluorescent lamps and recently, light-emitting diodes may also be used in trouble lights.|$|R
25|$|Cold-cathode {{fluorescent}} lamps (CCFLs) {{have been made}} available {{in the form of}} CFLs. CCFLs use electrodes without a filament. The voltage of CCFLs is about 5 times higher than CFLs, and the current is about 10 times lower. CCFLs have a diameter of about 3 millimeters. CCFLs were initially used for document scanners and also for back-lighting LCD displays, and later manufactured for use as lamps. The efficacy (<b>lumens</b> <b>per</b> <b>watt)</b> is about half that of CFLs. CCFLs rely on the discharge itself to heat the electrodes which operate at similar temperatures to 'hot cathode' CFLs. CCFLs still have a significant warm up time (though modern electrode materials have mitigated this somewhat) and suffer similar sputtering of the electrodes when switched on cold which shortens their life. Their main advantage is much simpler driving circuitry.|$|E
25|$|Metal halide {{lights are}} {{generally}} the highest output lighting commercially available. They produce about 90-100 <b>lumens</b> <b>per</b> <b>watt</b> of power. This {{is roughly the}} same as fluorescent. The improvement with metal halides is that they concentrate this light output into a very small space, whereas fluorescent lights evenly illuminate the entire aquarium. This {{is often referred to}} as point source lighting, and is what causes the rippling visual effect on many advanced aquarium setups. This concentration of light output increases the intensity, allowing metal halide lamps to penetrate light to even the very bottom levels of most aquariums. Metal halides are available in many color temperatures, from 6500 K up to 20,000 K, though bulbs as high as 50,000 K are occasionally found. The downsides of metal halide lighting are the initial cost and the heat produced.|$|E
25|$|Incandescent bulbs {{are much}} less {{efficient}} than most other types of electric lighting; incandescent bulbs convert less than 5% of the energy they use into visible light, with standard light bulbs averaging about 2.2%. The remaining energy is converted into heat. The luminous efficacy of a typical incandescent bulb is 16 <b>lumens</b> <b>per</b> <b>watt,</b> compared with 60lm/W for a compact fluorescent bulb or 150lm/W for some white LED lamps. Some applications of the incandescent bulb (such as heat lamps) deliberately use the heat generated by the filament. Such applications include incubators, brooding boxes for poultry, heat lights for reptile tanks, infrared heating for industrial heating and drying processes, lava lamps, and the Easy-Bake Oven toy. Incandescent bulbs typically have short lifetimes compared {{with other types of}} lighting; around 1,000 hours for home light bulbs versus typically 10,000 hours for compact fluorescents and 30,000 hours for lighting LEDs.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{reduction in}} an {{eddy current loss}} for a power coupler in an electrodeless discharged lamp with our previously proposed analysis method for plasma in the lamp. We confirmed that a large eddy current flow was observed {{at the top of}} an Al stage in the power coupler and the loss was reduced by a decrease in the height of the Al stage. This result suggests that a decrease in the height is effective to reduce wasted power losses and implies the possibility of an improvement in the lamp efficiency. We also confirmed that upward-moving and moderate-elongation of the ferrite core in the power coupler is effective to reduce the wasted loss. In order to verify the result, we evaluated the lamp efficiency of a lamp with a modified power coupler. Resultantly, the lamp efficiency was increased by approximately 3 lm/W (<b>lumen</b> <b>per</b> <b>Watt).</b> Therefore, we can conclude that reducing the eddy current loss in the power coupler is one of the important factors to obtain high lamp efficiency...|$|R
5000|$|The {{light output}} of an {{incandescent}} lamp in a flashlight varies widely {{depending on the}} type of lamp. A miniature keychain lamp produces one or two lumens. A two D-cell flashlight using a common prefocus-style miniature lamp will produce on the order of 15 to 20 lumens of light [...] and a beam of about 200 candlepower. One popular make of rechargeable focusing flashlight uses a halogen lamp and produces 218 lumens. By comparison, a 60-watt household incandescent lamp will produce about 900 lumens. The luminous efficacy or <b>lumens</b> produced <b>per</b> <b>watt</b> of input of flashlight bulbs varies over the approximate range of 8 to 22 lumens/watt, depending on the size of the bulb and the fill gas, with halogen-filled 12 volt lamps having the highest efficacy.|$|R
2500|$|Tungsten-halogen {{technology}} (also called [...] "quartz-halogen", [...] "quartz-iodine", [...] "iodine cycle", etc.) {{increases the}} effective luminous efficacy of a tungsten filament: when operating {{at a higher}} filament temperature which results in more <b>lumens</b> output <b>per</b> <b>watt</b> input, a tungsten-halogen lamp has a much longer brightness lifetime than similar filaments operating without the halogen regeneration cycle. [...] At equal luminosity, the halogen-cycle bulbs also have longer lifetimes. European-designed halogen headlamp light sources are generally configured to provide more light at the same power consumption as their lower-output plain tungsten counterparts. By contrast, many US-based designs are configured to reduce or minimize the power consumption while keeping light output above the legal minimum requirements; some US tungsten-halogen headlamp light sources produce less initial light than their non-halogen counterparts. A slight theoretical fuel economy benefit and reduced vehicle construction cost through lower wire and switch ratings were the claimed benefits when American industry first chose how to implement tungsten-halogen technology. There was an improvement in seeing distance with US halogen high beams, which were permitted {{for the first time}} to produce 150,000 candela (cd) per vehicle, double the non-halogen limit of 75,000cd but still well shy of the international European limit of 225,000cd. After replaceable halogen bulbs were permitted in US headlamps in 1983, development of US bulbs continued to favor long bulb life and low power consumption, while European designs continued to prioritise optical precision and maximum output.|$|R
2500|$|The lumen (lm) is the SI {{unit for}} {{luminous}} flux, {{the total amount}} of light emitted by a source, weighted according to the sensitivity of the human eye to various colours of light. <b>Lumens</b> <b>per</b> <b>watt</b> is a common measure of the efficacy of a light source. [...] The luminous flux is of less value for bicycle lighting due to the importance of directionality. Luminous intensity is much more useful, but <b>lumens</b> <b>per</b> <b>watt</b> is a handy way to compare the output of otherwise similar lights.|$|E
2500|$|Because the eye's {{sensitivity}} {{changes with}} the wavelength, {{the output of}} lamps is commonly measured in lumens, {{a measure of the}} power of light as perceived by the human eye. The luminous efficacy of lamps is the number of lumens produced for each watt of electrical power used. The luminous efficacy of a typical CFL is 50–70 <b>lumens</b> <b>per</b> <b>watt</b> (lm/W) and that of a typical incandescent lamp is [...] Compared to a theoretical 100%-efficient lamp (...) , CFL lamps have lighting efficiency ranges of 7–10%, versus 1.5–2.5% for incandescents.|$|E
2500|$|In flood lamps {{used for}} {{photographic}} lighting, the tradeoff {{is made in}} the other direction. Compared to general-service bulbs, for the same power, these bulbs produce far more light, and (more importantly) light at a higher color temperature, at the expense of greatly reduced life (which may be as short as two hours for a type P1 lamp). The upper temperature limit for the filament is the melting point of the metal. Tungsten is the metal with the highest melting point, [...] A 50-hour-life projection bulb, for instance, is designed to operate only [...] below that melting point. Such a lamp may achieve up to 22 <b>lumens</b> <b>per</b> <b>watt,</b> compared with 17.5 for a 750-hour general service lamp.|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this program}} was to reduce the long term {{technical}} risks that were keeping the lighting industry from embracing and developing organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology for general illumination. The specific goal was to develop OLEDs for lighting {{to the point where}} it was possible to demonstrate a large area white light panel with brightness and light quality comparable to a fluorescence source and with an efficacy comparable to that of an incandescent source. it was recognized that achieving this would require significant advances in three area: (1) the improvement of white light quality for illumination, (2) the improvement of OLED energy efficiency at high brightness, and (3) the development of cost-effective large area fabrication techniques. The program was organized such that, each year, a ''deliverable'' device would be fabricated which demonstrated progress in one or more of the three critical research areas. In the first year (2001), effort concentrated on developing an OLED capable of generating high illumination-quality white light. Ultimately, a down-conversion method where a blue OLED was coupled with various down-conversion layers was chosen. Various color and scattering models were developed to aid in material development and device optimization. The first year utilized this approach to deliver a 1 inch x 1 inch OLED with higher illumination-quality than available fluorescent sources. A picture of this device is shown and performance metrics are listed. To their knowledge, this was the first demonstration of true illumination-quality light from an OLED. During the second year, effort concentrated on developing a scalable approach to large area devices. A novel device architecture consisting of dividing the device area into smaller elements that are monolithically connected in series was developed. In the course of this development, it was realized that, in addition to being scalable, this approach made the device tolerant to the most common OLED defect [...] electrical shorts. This architecture enabled the fabrication of a 6 inch x 6 inch OLED deliverable for 2002. A picture of this deliverable is shown and the performance metrics are listed. At the time, this was the highest efficiency, highest lumen output illumination-quality OLED in existence. The third year effort concentrated on improving the fabrication yield of the 6 inch x 6 inch devices and improving the underlying blue device efficiency. An efficiency breakthrough was achieved through the invention of a new device structure such that now 15 <b>lumen</b> <b>per</b> <b>watt</b> devices could be fabricated. A 2 feet x 2 feet OLED panel consisting of sixteen 6 inch x 6 inch high efficiency devices tiled together was then fabricated. Pictures of this panel are shown with performance metrics listed. This panel met all project objectives and was the final deliverable for the project. It is now the highest efficiency, highest lumen output, illumination-quality OLED in existence...|$|R

50|$|The {{average price}} <b>per</b> <b>watt</b> dropped {{drastically}} for solar cells over {{the in the}} decades leading up to 2017.

2500|$|The {{spectrum}} {{emitted by}} a blackbody radiator at temperatures of incandescent bulbs {{does not match}} the sensitivity characteristics of the human eye; the light emitted does not appear white, and most {{is not in the}} range of wavelengths at which the eye is most sensitive.

Klipstein explains it this way: [...] "An ideal thermal radiator produces visible light most efficiently at temperatures around [...] Even at this high temperature, a lot of the radiation is either infrared or ultraviolet, and the theoretical luminous efficacy (LER) is 95 lumens per watt." [...] No known material {{can be used as a}} filament at this ideal temperature, which is hotter than the sun's surface.
