40|$|AIM: To {{report an}} {{analysis}} of the concept <b>of</b> <b>respite</b> for older people. BACKGROUND: Respite is an important support strategy for family carers of older people. However, there is considerable confusion in the literature about the nature, scope, and outcomes <b>of</b> <b>respite</b> services. DATA SOURCES: The data source for the concept analysis was a review <b>of</b> literature addressing <b>respite</b> for older people. There were no publication date restrictions for the review and literature was searched up to 2010. DESIGN: Concept analysis that was informed by the work of Dubin and the operationalization of Dubin's work by Holton and Lowe. REVIEW METHOD: A review of the literature was undertaken to better understand the nature <b>of</b> <b>respite</b> for older people. The review investigated the views <b>of</b> <b>respite</b> {{from the perspective of the}} service provider, family carer, and care-recipient. A conceptual model <b>of</b> <b>respite</b> was developed using a four-step approach: gaining an understanding of the phenomenon; identifying and retrieving relevant studies; analysing the construct; and developing the conceptual model. RESULTS: The conceptual model that emerged from this process consisted of three attributes, Partnership, Service, and <b>Respite.</b> The attribute <b>of</b> Partnership concerned the relationship between the service provider, carer and care-recipient. The attribute of Service concerned what the provider offered and focused on two important areas, assistance and engagement. The attribute <b>of</b> <b>Respite</b> concerned the outcomes that the family carer and care-recipient gained from respite and focused on freedom, support, and connection. CONCLUSION: The conceptual model provides a framework to assist in the development <b>of</b> <b>respite</b> services. David Evan...|$|R

In order to achieve this aim an Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis approach was utilised for data collection and analysis.

An additional finding was also reported, as foster carers’ views of fostering and their foster children appeared to be a modifying variable influencing carers’ perceptions <b>of</b> <b>respite</b> care. These findings illustrated that there are differential effects <b>of</b> <b>respite</b> for carers compared with foster children in some cases, resulting in a tension between meeting carers’ needs and the needs of the children in their care.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} family physicians' perceptions <b>of</b> how available <b>respite</b> care is and {{how easy}} it is to refer chronically ill older people to it, and to examine their opinions <b>of</b> <b>respite</b> care. DESIGN: Mailed survey to family physicians on the Thames Valley Family Practice Research Unit's mailing list. SETTING: London, Ont, and surrounding area. PARTICIPANTS: Of the 448 surveys mailed to eligible physicians, 288 were completed and returned for a response rate of 64. 3 %. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Respondents' perceptions <b>of</b> how available <b>respite</b> care {{is and how}} easy it is to refer chronically ill older people to it and their opinions on the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>respite</b> care. RESULTS: More than half the respondents reported that outpatient respite care is always available, but how available depended on practice location. Inpatient respite care was reported as less available. More than half the respondents found referral to respite care difficult. Respondents were very positive about the role <b>of</b> <b>respite</b> services in long-term care and in lowering caregiver stress. Respondents' perceptions varied according to where they had attended medical school. Their perceptions <b>of</b> <b>respite</b> care's role in long-term care and in helping patients remain at home were influenced by whether they thought respite care was available. CONCLUSION: Family physicians need education in the value <b>of</b> <b>respite</b> services for their chronically ill older patients and their families. Physicians also need information on the respite services available and strategies for accessing them. Our findings suggest a need for greater attention to regional discrepancies in availability of services...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} {{effectiveness}} and cost-effectiveness of breaks in care {{in improving the}} well-being of informal carers of frail and disabled older {{people living in the}} community and to identify carer needs and barriers to uptake <b>of</b> <b>respite</b> services. Data sources: Major electronic databases were searched from the earliest possible date to April 2008. Review methods: Selected studies were assessed and subjected to extraction of numerical data for meta-analysis of quantitative studies and extraction of text for thematic analysis of qualitative studies. Quality of the studies was assessed using checklists specifically designed for the current review. Results: In total, 104 papers were identified for inclusion in the quantitative synthesis, 16 of which were appropriate for meta-analysis. Carer burden was reduced at 2 – 6 months' follow-up in single-sample studies but not in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental studies. Depression was reduced in RCTs in the short term and for home care but not for day care. These effects, however, were not significant in random-effects models. There was a trend for longer interventions to have more positive effects than shorter interventions. There was no effect <b>of</b> <b>respite</b> on anxiety, but it had positive effects on morale and anger and hostility. Single-group studies suggested that quality of life was worse after respite use. There were increased rates <b>of</b> institutionalisation after <b>respite</b> use; however, this does not establish a causal relationship as it may be a result <b>of</b> <b>respite</b> being provided late in the caregiving career. A total of 70 papers were identified for inclusion in the qualitative synthesis. Uptake <b>of</b> <b>respite</b> care was influenced by: carer attitudes to caring and respite provision; the caregiving relationship; knowledge of, and availability of, services; the acceptability to, and impact <b>of</b> <b>respite</b> care on, care recipients; hassles resulting from the use <b>of</b> <b>respite</b> care; quality <b>of</b> <b>respite</b> care; and the appropriateness and flexibility of service provision. Carers expressed needs for active information provision about services, support offered early in the caregiving career, access to a variety of services with flexible provision, reliable transport services, continuity of care, good-quality care, appropriate environments, care that provides benefits for care recipients (socialisation and stimulation), and appropriate activities for care recipients' levels of abilities and interests. Conclusions: There was some evidence to support respite having a positive effect on carers but the evidence was limited and weak. It is difficult, therefore, to make recommendations as to the most appropriate form <b>of</b> delivery <b>of</b> <b>respite,</b> apart from the suggestion that a range of services is probably most appropriate, to provide flexibility <b>of</b> <b>respite</b> provision and responsiveness to carer and care recipient characteristics and needs and also changes in those needs over time.

40|$|Family caregivers, who are patientsflrelatives {{and friends}} (hereafter called carers), play a {{significant}} and arguably most important role in enabling patients to make choices about their place of care during advanced disease and in the terminal phase. Relatively {{little attention has been}} directed towards identifying the needs of carers who find themselves in this position and what interventions (if any) might best support them in continuing to provide care to the patient during the illness and dying trajectory. What evidence there is suggests that while some aspects of caring are looked on positively, carers also experience challenges in maintaining their physical and psychological health and their social and financial wellbeing. One common recommendation is that respite facilities be provided. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to consider the definitions and assumptions that underpin the term ’respitefland its impact on the physical, psychological and social outcomes of carers in palliative care contexts. We conducted a review of the literature, which involved searching five electronic databases: Web of Science, Medline, CINHAHL, Cochrane Database System Review and Social Sciences Citation Index.

Despite numerous anecdotal reports in support <b>of</b> <b>respite</b> care, its uptake by carers of people with dementia remains relatively low.
