40|$|<b>Labour</b> <b>Market</b> <b>Area</b> is a {{territory}} in which {{high rate of}} people both live and work. It {{does not need to}} be consistent with area restricted by administrative boarders. It seems rather obvious that administrative boarders are not always a proper criterion in making certain decisions. The government should sometimes base on functional regions instead. That is the reason for which in 2013 Eurostat decided to from the Task Force responsible of creating a common methodology of defining Labour Market Areas. A couple of member states have already had certain experience in using their own definitions of Labour Market Areas. Nevertheless, due to independence of each method the results achieved in different countries were obviously incomparable. This caused a need to create a methodology, which would be universal for entire European Union. According to proposal there are two criteria deciding whether an area is a <b>Labour</b> <b>Market</b> <b>Area</b> or not – size (number of employed inhabitants) and self-containment, which is a minimal value of the following: 1) the proportion of an area’s employed population that works within the area and 2) the proportion of jobs within an area that are filled by residents of that area. Since the results should be possibly stable, population censuses are desirable sources. As travel-to-work matrices contain relations between places of living and places of work at LAU- 2 level, datasets may have large size (for Poland almost 350 000 records). The aim is to join areas into clusters so that all of them fulfill conditions to be considered as <b>Labour</b> <b>Market</b> <b>Area.</b> In each step only two areas are joined. Then computations for all new areas need to be performed from the beginning. There are also certain situations when once joined areas are divided, which makes the whole process more complicated.

40|$|This Ph. D. {{identifies}} the spatial structures associated with Ireland’s economic geography through {{an analysis of}} travel-to-work patterns. In doing so it applies, within the Irish context, novel techniques to identify local <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>areas</b> using data that, heretofore, were unavailable to researchers in Ireland, i. e. detailed spatial interaction data describing the journey to work. The primary aim of this thesis is to address a research lacuna concerning <b>labour</b> and <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>areas</b> {{within the field of}} economic geography in Ireland. This research augments our understanding of the spatial structure of Ireland’s economy through the identification of local <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>areas</b> and elucidates the geographies of who works where and places these within an international context. This, in turn, facilitates a detailed evaluation of Ireland’s ‘National Spatial Strategy 2002 – 2020 : People, Places and Potential’ (NSS). The content of this strategy raises fundamental geographic questions concerning who lives where, where they work and the spatial structure of those functional areas associated with cities and towns in Ireland. The thesis explores these issues through the dual conceptual lenses of geographies of labour and labour geographies. In additional to these theoretical considerations, the research is guided by three broad objectives: a) the identification of local <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>areas,</b> b) to enhance the effectiveness of spatial policies in Ireland concerned with economic development in general and those affecting labour processes in particular by critically engaging with the concept of polycentricity, and c) to empirically evaluate selected spatial concepts that are central to the NSS. In addressing these objectives the thesis makes a significant contribution to both economic geography and spatial planning. It provides a comprehensive evaluation of the NSS and provides new insights into the geography of local <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>areas</b> in Ireland, whilst also providing a methodology that overcomes the central criticism of the technique used in previous studies identifying <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R

40|$|This article {{establishes}} {{a link between}} the traditional labour economics and the urban economics literature by analyzing differences in working hours across regional <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>areas</b> in the UK. Using a real wage index reflecting skill adjusted earnings net of quality adjusted house prices in Britain and panel data on working hours the effect of regional real wages on labour supply is assessed. The identification strategy relies on workers who move across 157 <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>areas</b> in Britain and includes individual fixed effects. The main finding is that working hours are significantly higher in <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>areas</b> that offer lower real wages. Decreasing real wages by £ 1000 results in an increase of working hours of 0. 3 %. Real wage differentials {{can be seen as a}} proxy for the local amenity level. I can replicate my finding including a set of amenities instead of the real wage index. The effect is mainly due to labour supply decisions of low skilled workers who work significantly longer hours in low real wage areas than high skilled workers.

40|$|Essay 1 : Swedish micro and macro data on {{internal}} migration indicate that home-owners on average {{have a higher}} propensity to migrate to other <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>areas</b> in response to higher unemployment and job vacancy rates than renters and tenant-owners. This is evidence that owning your home does not constrain labour mobility across <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>areas</b> in comparison {{to other forms of}} housing tenure. The response to high local job vacancy rates indicates that migration in general is driven by differences in matching efficiency in local <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>areas</b> rather than a pure response to high local unemployment. A third finding is that at higher levels of aggregation high unemployment is associated to high levels of home-ownership as previous researchers have found. The suggested explanation for this correlation, i. e. that home-ownership constrains mobility of individuals, however, seems falsified in Sweden by our results. Essay 2 : Swedish micro and macro data {{on internal}} migration indicate that interregional migration responds to regional <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> conditions and individual unemployment. Migration is found to go from relatively high unemployment and high job vacancy to low unemployment and low job vacancy regions contrary to earlier research.

40|$|Earlier {{studies on}} {{entrepreneurship}} and self-employment among immigrants {{call attention to}} the fact that also the "market" for self-employment or entrepreneurs consists of a supply and demand side as well as the interaction between these two. More recent research suggests that a mix of personal resources, the surrounding structural context of markets, competition and the current political and economic environment, all acting together are seen as determining factors affecting self-employment by immigrants. However, few studies have been able to quantify the importance of these different aspects that determine ethnic self-employment. The central aim of this paper is therefore, by using multilevel regression, to quantify the role the country of birth respectively <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>area</b> plays for understanding individual differences in self-employment. Using register data on individuals for the year of 2007 for the entire Swedish population we have in this study a unique opportunity to quantify the relative importance of the self-employers embeddedness in the social and ethnic networks (country of birth) and the regional business and public regulatory framework (labour market areas) measured. Our results suggest that of the total variation in individual differences in self-employment can 14 % (men) respectively 16 % (women) be attributed to the ethnic group and the <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>area.</b> Furthermore, the ethnical groups accounted for 70 % (men) and 78 % (women) of this higher level variance. These results show that the social and ethnical context (measured by country of birth) and the economic environment (measured by local labour market areas) played a minor role for understanding individual differences in self-employment. These results can have important implications when planning interventions or other actions focusing on self-employment. Focusing only on ethnical groups/labour market areas might be inefficient as approximately 85 % of the variation is not explained by ethnical groups/labour market areas. Instead more general approaches or interventions focusing on other groups that capture a larger part of the variation might be more efficient. immigrants, self-employment, integration, entrepreneurship, multilevel logistic regression...|$|E

We cannot control for fixed effects at the individual level because very few individuals in our sample moved during 1996 – 2010.11 We also cannot control for fixed effects at the municipal level since attitudes are assumed to be constant over time. We will control for fixed effects at the <b>labour</b> <b>market</b> <b>area</b> level instead. The division of the 290 municipalities into 70 labour market areas is built by Statistics Sweden based on actual commuting conditions.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we specify, within a {{hierarchical}} Bayesian setting, appropriate atom-based models {{to solve the}} following small area estimation (SAE) questions: (i) combining auxiliary covariates which are available on non nested areal partitions (misaligned areal regression problem); (ii) providing small area estimates by using planned domains data (misaligned areal interpolation problem). To illustrate our approach we consider the problem of estimating the number of unemployed at Local <b>Labour</b> <b>Market</b> <b>area</b> (small area or target zone) level by using two misaligned source data: auxiliary information available on different administrative partitions; reliable estimates of unemployed on Labour Force Survey planned domains. Thus we explore the close connection that typical SAE issues show to have with spatial misalignment problems. Ob ject of SAE is, in fact, inference on survey non-planned “minor domains” (the so called small areas) : based on direct domain data (when available), it leads to estimates of poor quality. Thereby models are set up for borrowing strength from indirectly related data sources.

Its entrepreneurial nature is reflected in a massive presence of Chinese businessman employed in manufacturing activities, with a high concentration in industrial districts.

Therefore, the investigation {{on the presence of}} manufacturing micro-enterprises run by Chinese migrants in Italy is an issue of particular interest. The aim of the paper is to shed some light on current localization of Chinese micro-entrepreneurs in Italian industrial districts, and their specialization in ‘personal goods ’ (textile, clothing, leather and footwear), one of the main sectors of the district made in Italy. Some measurements of Chinese micro-entrepreneurship in this sector and related business services is carried out to test the hypothesis of their co-localization in industrial districts.
