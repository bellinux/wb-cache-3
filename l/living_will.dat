Pearse reported that the issue of conflict of interest applied to the Schindlers as well since, had Michael divorced Terri as they wanted him to, they would have inherited the remainder of Mrs. Schiavo's estate upon her death.|$|E

Nevertheless, the village head Narayana Rao hopes that the standard of <b>living</b> <b>will</b> soon improve along with the general condition of the village. Meanwhile, Ratnam's son Radha uses blackmail to threaten harm to Ravikanth's family if he does not back out of a prestigious highway contract. Ravikanth's nephew Karthik, who hopes to succeed Ravikanth in the business empire, leaks to Radha details about an upcoming bid for the contract, which comes to the notice of Harsha. After subtly warning Ratnam at his residence in Delhi, Harsha secretly makes a lower bid on behalf of his father's company and wins the contract.|$|E

An out of control Mulder demands to know how she got there, and is escorted out by security but later calms down and meets with Dr. Daly (Jay Brazeau), who reveals that no one can figure out how she got there or what's wrong with her. He tells Mulder and Mrs. Scully that she has a <b>living</b> <b>will</b> that dictates she be taken off of life support when her condition falls to specific criteria. At Scully's bedside, Mulder meets her older sister Melissa (Melinda McGraw). Scully has a vision of sitting in a boat, attached by rope to a dock where Mulder and Melissa stand, and nurse Owens behind them. Frohike visits Scully and sneaks out her medical chart, which the Lone Gunmen later investigate. Byers finds that Scully's blood contains branched DNA that may have been used for identification but now is inactive and nothing more than a poisonous waste product in her system.|$|E

40|$|Instructional advance {{directives}} (i. e., <b>living</b> <b>wills)</b> have been endorsed widely {{as a crucial}} method for maintaining seriously ill patients’autonomy {{at the end of}} life. Theoretically, liv-ing wills maintain the patient’s voice in treatment decisions by enhancing the ability of sur-rogate decision makers to make the treatment choices that patients would make for them-selves if competent. For <b>living</b> <b>wills</b> to achieve their goal, the following three assumptions must bemet: (a) People must complete <b>living</b> <b>wills,</b> (b) treatment preferences recorded in liv-ingwillsmust be authentic, and (c) surrogate decisionmakersmust be able to interpret <b>living</b> <b>wills</b> and use them to make accurate treatment predictions. The authors review the medical and psychological literatures bearing on these assumptions and find that the available empirical evidence challenges the validity of each assumption. The authors conclude by dis-cussing the potential benefits of advance directive use and directions for future research.

Tucker signed a DNR but Katherine and Ashley keep Tucker from being taken off life support and Katherine is left in charge of McCall Unlimited. Tucker's <b>living</b> <b>will</b> also reveals {{that he has a}} son who stands to inherit 20 million dollars if he is found. Meanwhile, Katherine reverses all of Tucker's most recent {{business}} decisions and he and Ashley marry when he wakes up from his coma. Though Tucker is physically recovered, he lost all of his business sense and Ashley must run the company in secret until he recovers fearing Katherine may try to take his company again. Afterward, Tucker is one of several suspects when Diane is murdered and he fires Devon Hamilton (Bryton James), from his record label. In turn Katherine launches her own record label as a subsidiary of Chancellor Industries and hires Devon to run it. Tucker teams up with Jack again to overturn the sale of Jabot and a shocked Katherine ends up in the hospital after a stroke. Tucker accidentally learns from Jill that Devon is his son, and Devon refuses to accept Tucker as his new father, and disowns Katherine for hiding the truth. Meanwhile, Devon's formerly drug addicted mother, now known as Harmony (Debbi Morgan), returns to Genoa City to explain her reasons for hiding Devon's paternity. Tucker stands in as the godfather of Moses Winters, the son of his longtime friend and confidant, Sofia Dupre (Julia Pace Mitchell). Tucker does his best to build a relationship with his son, but Devon constantly rejects him. He and Ashley later renew their vows and Devon finally lets his guard down and comes to the wedding.|$|E

25|$|Free {{movement}} of people across the EU will give many Turkish people the opportunity to easily migrate {{to other parts of}} Europe in search of work, or a higher standard of living. The option of migration out of Turkey will inevitably ease tensions in the east of the country, as the prospect of a better standard of <b>living</b> <b>will</b> tend to cool separatist tendencies. Some secularists in Turkey envisage that the accession of Turkey will contribute to the spread of secular western values in Turkey. Conversely, some non-secularists in Turkey envisage that accession will contribute to the further growth and acceptance of Islam in Europe.

500|$|The book, {{which was}} misleadingly labeled as the posthumous seventh volume of Russell's Studies in the Scriptures, was denounced by Rutherford's opponents, but became a best-seller and was {{translated}} into six languages and serialized in The Watch Tower. Expecting God's Kingdom to establish rule on earth and for the saints to be raised to heaven in 1918, Rutherford wrote in January of that year: [...] "The Christian looks for the year to bring the full consummation of the church's hopes." [...] He embarked on a vast advertising campaign to expose the [...] "unrighteousness" [...] of religions and their alliances with [...] "beastly" [...] governments, expanding on claims in The Finished Mystery that patriotism was a delusion and murder. The campaign {{attracted the attention of}} governments and on February 12, 1918 the book was banned by the Canadian government for what a Winnipeg newspaper described as [...] "seditious and antiwar statements" [...] On February 24 in Los Angeles Rutherford gave a talk entitled [...] "The World Has Ended—Millions Now Living May Never Die" [...] (subsequent talks in the series were renamed, [...] "Millions Now <b>Living</b> <b>Will</b> Never Die")"Noteworthy Events in the Modern-day History of Jehovah's Witnesses", Jehovah's Witnesses – Proclaimers of God's Kingdom", 1993 Watch Tower, p. 719, [...] "1918 The discourse [...] "The World Has Ended—Millions Now Living May Never Die" [...] is first delivered, on February 24, in Los Angeles, California. On March 31, in Boston, Massachusetts, the talk is entitled [...] "The World Has Ended—Millions Now <b>Living</b> <b>Will</b> Never Die" [...] in which he attacked the clergy, declaring: [...] "As a class, according to the Scriptures, the clergymen are the most reprehensible men on earth for the great war that is now afflicting mankind."

500|$|In 1920, Rutherford {{published}} a booklet, Millions Now <b>Living</b> <b>Will</b> Never Die, {{and a year}} later published his first hardcover book, The Harp of God. [...] This was followed by a further nineteen hardcover books, each with one-word titles, such as Creation (1927), Jehovah (1934) and Children (1941). His publications reached a total printing of 36 million copies. In 1925 he gained full control over what doctrines would be taught in Watch Tower Society publications, overruling the refusal by the five-man Editorial Committee to publish his article, [...] "Birth of the Nation", which contained significant doctrinal changes. Rutherford later claimed Satan had [...] "tried to prevent the publication of that article ... but failed in that effort"; In 1927 the Watch Tower Society ceased printing of Russell's Studies in the Scriptures. The Editorial Committee was dissolved in 1931, after which Rutherford wrote every leading article in The Watch Tower until his death.

500|$|Post-rock was {{established}} by Talk Talk's Laughing Stock and Slint's Spiderland albums, both released in 1991. Post-rock draws influence {{from a number of}} genres, including Krautrock, progressive rock, and jazz. The genre subverts or rejects rock conventions, and often incorporates electronic music. While the name of the genre was coined by music journalist Simon Reynolds in 1994, the style of the genre was solidified by the release of Millions Now <b>Living</b> <b>Will</b> Never Die (1996) by the Chicago group Tortoise. Post-rock became the dominant form of experimental rock music in the 1990s and bands from the genre signed to such labels as Thrill Jockey, Kranky, Drag City, and Too Pure. A related genre, math rock, peaked in the mid-1990s. In comparison to post-rock, math rock is more [...] "rockist" [...] and relies on complex time signatures and intertwining phrases. By {{the end of the decade}} a backlash had emerged against post-rock due to its [...] "dispassionate intellectuality" [...] and its perceived increasing predictability, but a new wave of post-rock bands such as Godspeed You! Black Emperor and Sigur Rós emerged who further expanded the genre.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Terri Schiavo case" [...] {{actually}} {{refers to}} a series of cases. It differed from the Quinlan and Cruzan cases by involving settled law rather than breaking new legal ground on the right-to-die issue. In 2006, Shepherd said that it was [...] "unclear" [...] whether the Schiavo case represents a landmark decision. The Schiavo case instead involved a dispute between family members over what Schiavo's wishes would have been for such a situation. According to medical ethicist Matthew Stonecipher, [...] "The movement to challenge the decisions made for Terri Schiavo threatened to destabilize end-of-life law that had developed over {{the last quarter of the}} 20th century, principally through the cases of Karen Ann Quinlan and Nancy Cruzan." [...] The outcome of the Schiavo case was also in part determined by a 1990 Florida case, Guardianship of Estelle Browning. In that case, George Felos, the attorney for Michael Schiavo in the Schiavo case, represented a Browning relative. Felos successfully argued before the Florida Supreme Court that Browning's feeding tube should be removed. The elderly Browning had expressed in a <b>living</b> <b>will</b> her wish not to be kept alive by any artificial means, including receiving food and water [...] "by a gastric tube or intravenously." [...] At that time it was common to remove people from ventilators, but the law in Florida was not clear on removing them from feeding tubes. In a landmark ruling, the Florida Supreme Court decided that Browning had [...] "the constitutional right to choose or refuse medical treatment, and that right extends to all relevant decisions concerning one's health." ...|$|E
5000|$|It also {{generated}} {{a great deal}} of interest in <b>living</b> <b>wills</b> and advance directives. [...] For example, just one month after the Supreme Court ruling in Cruzan, the Society for the Right to Die had received some 300,000 requests for advance directive forms.|$|R
