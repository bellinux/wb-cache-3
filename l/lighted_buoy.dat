The lightship was permanently stationed marking Bush Bluff shoal located in the Elizabeth River in Hampton Roads from 1895-1918 with a brief break 1911/1912 when the ship {{was replaced by a}} <b>lighted</b> <b>buoy.</b> LV-97 was temporarily used at other locations in the lower Chesapeake Bay. She was retired in 1918 after twenty-two years as a lightship, condemned, laid up in January 1918 and sold for $150 April 27, 1920.|$|E
2500|$|During {{a routine}} survey of Narragansett Bay in 2004, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ship Rude {{discovered}} a previously unknown wreck. [...] The ship is steel hulled; its bow is 36 {{feet below the}} surface, and {{it appears to have}} sunk some time after 1949. [...] The shipping lane used by ships in the bay had to be rerouted safely away from the wreck, and the Coast Guard has since marked the location with a <b>lighted</b> <b>buoy.</b> [...] Divers speculate that {{it may have been a}} Navy ammunition ferry, a privately owned ferry, or some vessel involved in a collision.|$|E
2500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 10 June Harder sighted a large Japanese task force, including three battleships and four cruisers with screening destroyers. An overhead plane spotted the submarine at periscope depth and a screening escort promptly steamed at [...] toward her position. Once again, Harder became the aggressive adversary. As the range closed to , she fired three torpedoes on a [...] "down the throat" [...] shot, then went deep to escape the onrushing destroyer and certain depth charge attack. Within a minute two torpedoes blasted the ship with violent force just as Harder passed her some [...] below. The deafening explosions shook the submarine far worse than the depth charges and aerial bombs which the infuriated enemy dropped {{during the next two}} hours. When she surfaced, Harder saw only a <b>lighted</b> <b>buoy</b> marking the spot where the unidentified destroyer either sank or was heavily damaged.|$|E

50|$|Haisborough Sands (or Haisboro Sands or Haisbro Sands) is a {{sandbank}} off {{the coast}} of Norfolk, England at Happisburgh. The shoal is 10 mi long and 1 mi wide and lies parallel to the North east coast of Norfolk. The shoal is marked to the north-west by north by the Haisbro <b>Light</b> <b>Buoy,</b> North cardinal. To the south-east by south is a <b>light</b> <b>buoy</b> South cardinal, and to the west by Mid Haisbro <b>light</b> <b>buoy</b> starboard hand. In 1995 there were three drying patches recorded to the north-north east and east-south east of the Mid Haisbro <b>light</b> <b>buoy.</b> Except at slack water their positions are indicated by tidal eddies and in slight or moderate seas the swell breaks on the shallower parts of the banks. There are a number of foul patches on {{the southern part of the}} shoal. There are very strong eddies on and around the bank especially on the north west. Over the years this shoal has claimed many ships.|$|R

She broke adrift in March 1948 and her engine failed in November 1950. She was replaced in 1958 by lightvessel 19. Lightvessel 80's last known sighting was in a Sotheby's catalogue for sale at £85,000.|$|E
50|$|Punta Gorda Lighthouse {{was built}} in 1911 and was first lit in 1912. After World War II, {{it was decided that}} given the {{remoteness}} of the station it was too costly to maintain. A <b>lighted</b> <b>buoy</b> was placed offshore, the fourth order Fresnel lens was removed, and the station was boarded up and deactivated in 1951. The keeper's house and all other station buildings were demolished.|$|E

50|$|John R. Wigham's relatives, in Scotland, were {{involved}} in shipbuilding, and he developed an interest in lighting used as a navigational aid at sea. Initially, buoys only had bells to warn mariners at night: the difficulty lay in designing an oil-lamp which could burn while unattended and not be extinguished by waves and storms. The first successful <b>lighted</b> <b>buoy</b> was patented by John Wigham in 1861. It was installed in the river Clyde.|$|E
50|$|The English Channel {{is one of}} {{the busiest}} seaways in the world and, despite {{standard}} radio warnings, three guard ships, and a <b>lighted</b> <b>buoy,</b> the Dutch vessel Nicola struck the wreck the next night, and had to be towed free. After this, two additional patrol ships and six more buoys were installed, including one with a Racon warning transponder. However, on 1 January 2003 the loaded Turkish-registered fuel carrier Vicky struck the same wreck; she was later freed by the rising tide.|$|E

50|$|Hammond's Knoll is a 6 mi long {{sandbank}} off {{the coast}} of Norfolk, England at Happisburgh, to the east of Haisborough Sands. The sandbank at low tide has a depth of 6 fathom m at each end, and 3 fathom m in the centre. The sandbank has <b>lighted</b> <b>buoys</b> at its north and east ends.|$|R
50|$|Since the {{decommissioning}} of the lighthouse, smaller automated lighthouses (two located at Humber Bay Park {{in the west}} and Bluffer's Park to the east), Toronto Harbour Light, as well as floating bell or <b>light</b> <b>buoys,</b> navigational masts have been used to replace the lighthouse to provide navigational aid along Toronto's waterfront and Toronto Harbour.|$|R
50|$|These towers {{deteriorated}} relatively quickly, and in 1983 the Coast Guard first suggested decommissioning it. It was retained, however, due to {{the proximity}} of the America's Cup races. In 1989 the Coast Guard announced that the light was to be removed, and in 1992 it was dismantled. The following year the pieces were sunk off Long Island as part of an artificial reef. A <b>lighted</b> <b>buoy</b> replaced the tower at a position somewhat further south, where it remains at present.|$|E

5000|$|Molson's Island Lighthouse {{was located}} on the {{southwest}} point of Molson's Island, approximately 2 mi southeast of the Chateau de Silva lighthouse. This was {{on the eastern side}} of the lake, near Georgeville. It was built in 1878 as a 22 ft white square wooden tower with a fixed white catoptric light located at a height of 28 ft above the high water mark and with a range of 8 mi. [...] The light had a focal plane of 28 ft. It was rebuilt in 1914 and demolished on an unknown date. The light was replaced with a <b>lighted</b> <b>buoy.</b>|$|E
