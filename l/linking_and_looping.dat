40|$|<b>Linking</b> {{feedback}} <b>loops</b> <b>and</b> system {{behavior is}} part of the foundation of system dynamics, yet the lack of formal tools has so far prevented a systematic application of the concept, except for very simple systems. Having such tools at their disposal would be a great help to analysts in understanding large, complicated simulation models. The paper applies tools from discrete mathematics and graph theory to further develop an idea by Nathan Forrester to formally link individual feedback loop strengths to the system eigenvalues. The significance of a link or a <b>loop</b> gain <b>and</b> an eigenvalue can be expressed in the eigenvalue elasticity, i. e. the relative change of an eigenvalue resulting from a relative change in the gain. The elasticities of individual <b>links</b> <b>and</b> <b>loops</b> may be found through simple matrix operations on the linearized system. Even though the number of feedback loops can grow rapidly with system size, reaching astronomical proportions even for modest systems, a central result of the paper is that one may restrict attention to an independent subset which typically grows only linearly and at most as the square of system size. An algorithm for finding an independent loop set is presented, along with suggestions for how to augment it to select loops with large elasticities. For illustration, the method is applied to a well-known system, the simple longwave model. Because this model exhibits highly nonlinear behavior, it sheds light on the usefulness of linear methods to nonlinear system. The analysis leads to a more thorough and deep understanding of the system and sheds new light on conventional wisdom regarding the role of many of the system’s feedback loops. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Zaslavsky proved in 2012 that, up to {{switching}} isomorphism, {{there are}} six different signed Petersen graphs {{and that they could}} be told apart by their chromatic polynomials, by showing that the latter give distinct results when evaluated at 3. He conjectured that the six different signed Petersen graphs also have distinct zero-free chromatic polynomials, and that both types of chromatic polynomials have distinct evaluations at any positive integer. We developed and executed a computer program (running in SAGE) that efficiently determines the number of proper k-colorings for a given signed graph; our computations for the signed Petersen graphs confirm Zaslavsky’s conjecture. We also computed the chromatic polynomials of all signed complete graphs with up to five vertices. Graph coloring problems are ubiquitous in many areas within and outside of mathematics. We are interested in certain enumerative questions about coloring signed graphs. A signed graph Σ = (Γ, σ) consists of a graph Γ = (V,E) and a signature σ ∈ {±}E. The underlying graph Γ may have multiple edges and, besides the usual <b>links</b> <b>and</b> <b>loops,</b> also half edges (with only one endpoint) and loose edges (no endpoints); the last are irrelevant for coloring questions, and so we assume in this paper that Σ has no loose edges.
