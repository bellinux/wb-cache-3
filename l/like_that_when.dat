25|$|Cruyff is {{sometimes}} {{described as a}} typical kind of ‘artist-footballer’ or ‘footballer-thinker’ who considers football, the so-called 'beautiful game', not a purely athletic/physical competition but an artistic-oriented mind-body game. Because of his distinctive footballing views, Cruyff was called ‘the Spinoza of football’ by some. He believed in a certain style of play, which {{has the power to}} put a smile on the people's faces as he described it. When Cruyff, both as a player and as a manager, spoke about football he often mentioned the entertainment value of the game, that there is more to it than winning. In a 2009 interview with Sportmails Martin Samuel, Arsène Wenger, as a devout follower of Cruyff's footballing ideology, once shared his opinion about football's artistic value, “I believe the target of anything in life should be to do it so well that it becomes an art. When you read some books they are fantastic, the writer touches something in you that you know you would not have brought out of yourself. He makes you discover something interesting in your life. If you are living like an animal, {{what is the point of}} living? What makes daily life interesting is that we try to transform it to something that is close to art. And football is <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> <b>When</b> I watch Barcelona, it is art.” , the author of Cruyff's French biography, called him ‘the greatest actor in the history of football’ because Cruyff was a glorious exception (possibly the only one ever) being the man who ‘played’ outstandingly well multiple roles in the world of football: player, manager, and thinker.|$|E
500|$|Meyer, the author, and Hardwicke, the director, {{had a close}} {{relationship}} while developing Twilight. Hardwicke wanted to embrace the experience and make {{the characters in the}} books come to life. She would call Meyer after changing a scene slightly, which surprised the author because, [...] "I've heard the stories...I know it's not normally <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> you adapt a book." [...] Meyer, a natural pessimist, was waiting for the worst but, instead, called her experience in the book's film adaptation [...] "the best I could have hoped for." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{a review}} of the second season, Bryce Wilson of Cinema Blend commented: [...] "The worst moments of this season are merely uninspired, never truly horrible. Slight misses like “Dancin' Homer”, “One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish”, “Bart's Dog Gets an F”, and “The War of the Simpsons” are a bit flat. But even in their lowest points, humor is easy to find." [...] Jeremy Roebuck of KVUE named this episode, along with [...] "Bart Sells His Soul", [...] "Homer the Heretic", [...] "Simpsons Bible Stories", and [...] "She of Little Faith", one of the best Simpsons episodes with a {{religious}} theme. Dawn Taylor of The DVD Journal thought Homer's line to Bart, [...] "I want to share something with you, the three little sentences that will get you through life. Number one: 'Cover for me.' Number two: 'Oh, good idea, boss.' Number three, 'It was <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> I got here.'", was the best line of the episode.|$|E
500|$|The next day, Churchill filed {{a lawsuit}} in state court {{claiming}} that the firing was retribution for his expressing politically unpopular views. The jury in Churchill's suit for reinstatement weighed the university's claims of academic misconduct per jury instructions it received in the case. As Stanley Fish said, [...] "It was the jury’s task to determine whether Churchill’s dismissal would have occurred independently of the adverse political response to his constitutionally protected statements." [...] The jury found that the alleged misconduct would not have led to Churchill's firing and rejected the university's academic misconduct claim as the grounds for dismissal. On April 1, 2009, a Colorado jury found that Churchill had been wrongly fired, and awarded $1 in damages. As {{one of the jurors}} said later in a press interview, [...] "it wasn't a slap in his face or anything <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> we didn't give him any money. It's just that [...] David Lane kept saying this wasn't about the money, and in the end, we took his word for that." [...] Churchill's counsel asked Chief Judge Larry J. Naves of the Denver District Court to order reinstatement in light of the verdict.|$|E
500|$|NBC were {{positive}} about the project, {{but there was still}} some concern that the homosexual subject matter would cause alarm. Ellen DeGeneres' sitcom Ellen that aired on ABC was canceled the year before Will & Grace premiered because ratings had plummeted after the show became [...] "too gay". Despite the criticism ABC received for DeGeneres' coming out episode, [...] "The Puppy Episode", [...] "there's no question that show made it easier for Will & Grace to make it on the air," [...] said Kohan. He added, [...] "Will & Grace had a better shot at succeeding where Ellen failed, however, because Will has known about his homosexuality for twenty years. He's not exploring that awkward territory {{for the first time as}} Ellen did. The process of self-discovery and the pain most gay men go through is fascinating, but the average American is put off by it." [...] Kohan also commented that rather than concentrating on Will's sexuality, Will & Grace is using it as a device: [...] "It's <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>When</b> Harry Met Sally... line when Billy Crystal says, 'A man and woman can never be friends, because sex always gets in the way.' What we want to explore is what happens between a man and a woman when sex doesn't get in the way." ...|$|E

500|$|Eastwood married Margaret Neville [...] "Maggie" [...] Johnson (born 1931; {{then working}} for an auto parts {{suppliers}} company) on December 19, 1953 in Pasadena. They had met {{six months earlier}} {{on a blind date}} in Los Angeles, although Eastwood subsequently had a serious relationship in Seattle that summer with a young woman who became pregnant with his child—an alleged daughter who was given up for adoption, per biographer Patrick McGilligan—before Johnson announced her engagement to him in October. The marriage would not prove altogether smooth. [...] "He thought they were too young, not well enough established," [...] remarked biographer Richard Schickel in the only authorized book ever written about Eastwood. A decade later, an ongoing affair Eastwood was involved in (said to have lasted 14 years) with dancer and Rawhide stuntwoman Roxanne Tunis (who was also married yet separated) produced his earliest verified child, daughter Kimber Eastwood (born Kimber Tunis; June 17, 1964), whose existence was kept secret from the public until July 1989, when the National Enquirer revealed her identity. Biographer Marc Eliot wrote of Johnson, [...] "It is difficult to say for sure that she actually knew about the baby, although it would have been nearly impossible for her not to. Everyone on the set knew ... and it is simply too difficult to keep a secret <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the mother and the illegitimate child live in the same small town, especially when that small town is Hollywood." [...] The source for the 1989 Enquirer article that originally broke the story claimed Johnson was aware of Kimber's existence at all times and even met Roxanne Tunis in person when making an unannounced visit to the set of Breezy in 1972. Actress Barbara Eden, a onetime Rawhide guest star and witness to the affair with Tunis, said of Eastwood's relationship with Johnson: [...] "They conducted a somewhat open marriage." ...|$|E
500|$|Garland, who has {{explored}} science fiction themes {{in some of}} his previous work, was a sounding board for ideas for the novel and an early reader of the book. Ishiguro stated that, despite Garland's screenwriting skills and previous experience with film, they did not discuss the idea of a film until after the novel was complete. [...] "I {{try not to think about}} things <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> writing a novel—in fact, quite the reverse", he stated. He said that he attempts to [...] "go for something... very interior, following thoughts and memories, something that I think is difficult to do on the screen, which is essentially a third-person medium." [...] Thus he was surprised when Garland, after reading a complete version of the book, said he would like to try to adapt it. Ishiguro recalled that Garland wrote a draft very quickly and immediately asked of his opinion of it [...] "as a first go". Ishiguro was very satisfied with Garland's screenplay—which was changed very little from its initial draft to the filmed version—and with the final film. When asked to compare the experience with that of The Remains of the Day, he acknowledged that both were more hands-on with this film. Romanek said that he did not make Never Let Me Go a science fiction film; rather, he was presenting a love story with fictional science context mixed in. He described the film as telling a [...] "love story where the science fiction is this subtle patina on the story." [...] The filmmaker explained that had they done the film with [...] "science fiction-y things", it would have been more openly, with props such as futuristic structures and devices.|$|E
500|$|Johnson said Adolf {{previously}} made {{comments about}} killing any African American {{who ran for}} president: [...] "He made a comment in the past. I can't honestly tell you how long ago in the past, that he didn't believe a black should be {{the leader of this}} country." [...] According to Johnson, Adolf said he was already wanted for other crimes, so it [...] "wouldn't matter if he killed Obama". Johnson also claimed Adolf said he would never be taken alive and wanted to [...] "go down in a blaze of glory". Law enforcement sources told KCNC-TV that one of the suspects [...] "was directly asked if they had come to Denver to kill Obama. He responded in the affirmative." [...] Johnson said Gartrell came to Denver to help Adolf execute the plan, and Gartrell later admitted to police that in talking about Obama, they referred to [...] "shooting on a grassy knoll," [...] a reference to the assassination of John F. Kennedy. An arrest warrant read, [...] "Adolf said that he wanted to kill Obama and additionally stated that he would specifically use a sniper rifle and high powered scope, and find high ground to set up and shoot Obama." [...] However, Johnson also told the reporter he {{came to the conclusion that}} there was assassination plot only after being questioned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation multiple times, adding, “I told them I had no idea there was a plot, a plan, a conspiracy or anything <b>like</b> <b>that</b> ... <b>When</b> the feds came and laid out everything on the table and how it looked, I was in agreement that they could have been up here to do something like that." [...] Johnson later rejected additional media interview requests.|$|E

2500|$|Venice {{had changed}} for him. Casanova now had little money for gambling, few willing females worth pursuing, and few acquaintances to enliven his dull days. He {{heard of the}} death of his mother and, more paining, visited the deathbed of Bettina Gozzi, who had first {{introduced}} him to sex and who died in his arms. His Iliad was published in three volumes, but to limited subscribers and yielding little money. He got into a published dispute with Voltaire over religion. When he asked, [...] "Suppose that you succeed in destroying superstition. With what will you replace it?" [...] Voltaire shot back, [...] "I <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> <b>When</b> I deliver humanity from a ferocious beast which devours it, can I be asked what I shall put in its place." [...] From Casanova's point of view, if Voltaire had [...] "been a proper philosopher, he would have kept silent on that subject ... the people need to live in ignorance for the general peace of the nation".|$|E
2500|$|In February 2014, {{during a}} Q session for the album, at SONOS Studios in Los Angeles, California, Schoolboy Q {{described}} the song [...] "Prescription/Oxymoron", {{as the most}} personal: [...] "I came up selling OxyContin," [...] he said. [...] "The karma behind it was that I never took an OxyContin before but I did get addicted to Percocets, Xanax, Codeine—shit <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> <b>When</b> my daughter was one and two , I used to get into sleep comas, like 'Xan comas'—just dead {{to the world and}} I put it into the music." [...] Schoolboy Q said he arranged the song to juxtapose the process of selling prescription pills and addiction: [...] "I put the OxyContin and selling it {{at the end of the}} relapse or the addiction," [...] he said. [...] "I sold OxyContin and then I got addicted [...] This way, I showed that I got addicted then I sold it. That was a crazy record. That's true shit—the first part of it when my daughter tried to wake me up and I was dead to the world. That was my little secret. I always had the cup with me. They just never knew I had a gang of pills in the other bottle. That was a little story about me and how I was addicted, too." ...|$|E
2500|$|The final {{building}} was considered excessively large. The Guardian described it in 1978 as [...] "an awful warning against thinking too big in Britain's cities", and [...] "so castle-like in its outer strength that any passing medieval army would automatically besiege {{it rather than}} shop in it...". The underground railway scheme was abandoned by 1976 and the only deck access was across Corporation Street to another Town &City development in the Shambles. At the official opening, one of its champions, Dame Kathleen Ollerenshaw, Mayor of Manchester, commented, [...] "I didn't think it would look <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> I saw the balsa wood models". [...] The [...] "unrepentant" [...] architects responded that they had provided {{what they had been}} asked to provide. Kenneth Stone said in 1978 [...] "We're not responsible for everything in there, but we're not sorry about the decisions we took as opposed to those which were forced upon us." [...] The critics' opinion did not mellow with time, and it was described as [...] "aggressive externally" [...] in 1991. The Economist noted in 1996 that it had [...] "long been regarded as one of Europe's ugliest shopping centres.... the epitome of lousy modern architecture... was hated". The Financial Times in 1997 called it [...] "outstandingly ugly" [...] and in 2000 [...] "one of Britain's least-loved buildings".|$|E
