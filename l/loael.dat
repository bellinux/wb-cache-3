40|$|In {{this report}} an {{investigation}} on {{the relevance of}} developmental toxicity endpoints in animal studies for setting acute limits is described. In this analysis NOAELs and <b>LOAELs</b> from single dose experiments are compared to NOAELs and <b>LOAELs</b> from normal 'guideline-based' repeated dose developmental toxicity studies. Based on this analysis {{it was concluded that}} gross maternal toxicity (maternal body weight, food intake, organ weights, clinical signs) are not an appropriate starting point for setting limits for acute exposure. The relevance of fetal body weight (and retarded ossification) for acute limit setting should be evaluated within the total context of developmental effects and maternal toxicity. Resorptions are considered relevant for setting acute exposure limits. Malformations and skeletal effects are considered relevant starting points for acute limit setting unless evidence is available to indicate otherwise. Using a NOAEL from a normal 'guideline-based' repeated dose developmental toxicity study always provides a worst case estimation of the NOAEL in a single dose exposure...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTrichothecene mycotoxins, potent {{translational}} inhibitors {{that are}} associated with human food poisonings and damp-building illnesses, are of considerable concern to animal and human health. Food refusal is a hallmark of exposure of experimental animals to deoxynivalenol (DON) and other Type B trichothecenes but less is known about the anorectic effects of foodborne Type A trichothecenes (e. g., T- 2 toxin, HT- 2 toxin), airborne Type D trichothecenes (e. g., satratoxin G [SG]) or functionally analogous metabolites that impair protein synthesis. Here, we utilized a well-described mouse model of food intake to compare the anorectic potencies of T- 2 toxin, HT- 2 toxin, and SG to that of emetine, a medicinal alkaloid derived from ipecac that inhibits translation. Intraperitoneal (IP) administration with T- 2 toxin, HT- 2 toxin, emetine and SG evoked anorectic responses that occurred within 0. 5 h that lasted up to 96, 96, 3 and 96 h, respectively, with lowest observed adverse effect levels (<b>LOAELs)</b> being 0. 1, 0. 1, 2. 5 and 0. 25 mg/kg BW, respectively. When delivered via natural routes of exposure, T- 2 toxin, HT- 2 toxin, emetine (oral) and SG (intranasal) induced anorectic responses that lasted up to 48, 48, 3 and 6 h, respectively with <b>LOAELs</b> being 0. 1, 0. 1, 0. 25, and 0. 5 mg/kg BW, respectively. All four compounds were generally much more potent than DON which was previously observed to have <b>LOAELs</b> of 1 and 2. 5 mg/kg BW after IP and oral dosing, respectively. Taken together, these anorectic potency data will be valuable in discerning the relative risks from trichothecenes and other translational inhibitors of natural origin...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe ceasing of {{industrial}} activities often reduces the {{emission of pollutants}} but also often leaves disturbed areas without remediation and with persistent pollutants that can still be transferred along the food chain. This study examines the potential relationships between non-essential trace metals and histopathology in target tissues of wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) collected along a gradient of contamination around the former smelter, Metaleurop Nord (northern France). Cadmium and lead concentrations were measured, and histological alterations attributable to chronic trace metal exposure were assessed in the liver and the kidneys of 78 individuals. Metal concentrations quantified {{in the present study}} were among the highest observed for this species. Some histological alterations significantly increased with Cd or Pb concentrations in the soil and in the organs. Sixteen mice from polluted sites were considered at risk for metal-induced stress because their Cd and/or Pb tissue concentrations exceeded the <b>LOAELs</b> for single exposure to these elements. These mice also exhibited a higher severity of histological alterations in their organs than individuals with lower metal burdens. These results indicate that the Metaleurop smelter, despite its closure in 2003, still represents a threat to the local ecosystem because of the high levels and high bioavailability of Cd and Pb in the soil. However, among the mice not considered at risk for metal-induced stress based on the metal levels in their tissues, a large percentage of individuals still exhibited histological alterations. Thus, the present study suggests that the evaluation of toxic effects based only on the <b>LOAELs</b> for single metal exposure may result in the underestimation of the real risks when specimens are exposed to multiple stressors...|$|R
40|$|Background: Sesame is a {{relevant}} food allergen in France. Compared to other allergens {{there is a}} lack of food challenge data and more data could help sesame allergy risk management. The aim of this study is to collect more sesame challenge data and investigate the most efficient food challenge method for future studies. Method: Records of patients at University Hospital in Nancy (France) with objective symptoms to sesame challenges were collected and combined with previously published data. An estimation of the sesame allergy population threshold was calculated based on individual NOAELs and <b>LOAELs.</b> Clinical dosing schemes at Nancy were investigated to see if the optimal protocol for sesame is currently used. Results: Fourteen patients (10 M/ 4 F, 22 ± 14. 85 years old) with objective symptoms were added to previously published data making a total of 35 sesame allergic patients. The most sensitive patient reacted to the first dose at challenge of 1. 02 mg sesame protein. The ED 05 ranges between 1. 2 and 4. 0 mg of sesame protein (Log-Normal, Log-Logistic, and Weibull models) and the ED 10 between 4. 2 and 6. 2 mg. The optimal food challenge dosing scheme for sesame follows semi-log dose increases from 0. 3 to 3000 mg protein. Conclusion: This article provides a valuable update to the existing clinical literature regarding sesame NOAELs and <b>LOAELs.</b> Establishment of a population threshold for sesame could help in increasing the credibility of precautionary labelling and decrease the costs associated with unexpected allergic reactions. Also, the use of an optimal dosing scheme would decrease time spent on diagnostic and thereafter on the economic burden of sesame allergy diagnosis. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

Other sensitive parameters were weights of reproductive organs including assessory glands i. e. testis, epididymis, prostate, seminal vesicle weight and sperm parameters such as sperm count, sperm morphology and sperm motility, the latter being especially important as it is more sensitive than histopathology in some cases. Due to the high variation of several of these parameters, only pronounced effects can be detected. Laboratory animals are still fertile even if the sperm counts drop by 90 to 99 %. Consequently, in fertility studies, fertility parameters showed lower sensitivity than the other parameters. In most cases not a single endpoint but rather several endpoints were affected.

This level was thus identified at the lowest observed adverse effect level (<b>LOAEL).</b> A NOAEL of 0.5 mg/kg was estimated by dividing the <b>LOAEL</b> by a three-fold uncertainty factor.

Using NOAELs related to lowest <b>LOAELs</b> instead of lowest NOAELs, excluding studies with a dose spacing > 8, and standardizing NOAELs to the initial dose animals received shifted the 5 th percentile of NOAEL distributions from 0. 22 to 0. 5 mg/kg body weight per day. In contrast, weighting of NOAELs for the study numbers per compound shifts 5 th percentiles downwards to lower values by 10 – 20 %.

Characterizing the hazards of inhaled toxicants generally includes extrapolation from observations on experimental animals, subjected to intermittent or subchronic exposures, to a human environmental context with exposure that is usually continuous and long-term. The extrapolation is usually based on a simple linear relationship derived from Haber's rule which assumes that, for a given chemical compound, multiplying the same concentration by the same duration of exposure will yield the same biological response. This study assessed the reliability of this assumption. The p-power in the equation C×t(p) =k was calculated for 21 chemicals, based on a comparison of <b>LOAELs</b> for subacute, subchronic and chronic durations. A bibliographic survey was then carried out to study the reliability of the intermittent-to-continuous exposure adjustment factors currently used in risk assessment. The results showed that the value of p, assumed to be 1 in risk assessment methodology, was not in fact equal to 1 for any of the selected chemicals. Moreover, in the case of respiratory tract irritation, the value of p varied from 0 to 0. 44, as confirmed by experimental studies.

40|$|The {{intent of}} this {{research}} was to identify the level of risk methanol posed to a fetus during an ethanol co-exposure. This investigation was prompted by the known competitive inhibition properties of ethanol and the developmental toxicity of methanol. Integrated into this research was the practicality necessitated by regulatory processes, namely: does the risk justify the expense of additional research. To this end, the scope and nature of exposures were summarized to illustrate the ubiquity of these chemicals and the potential for dual exposure. Similarly, severity of outcome was evaluated by systematically reviewing the <b>LOAELs,</b> NOAELs, and statistical significance contained in methanol-induced developmental studies. Results. Blood methanol levels corresponding to developmental effects in laboratory studies were found to be substantially higher than the blood methanol levels predicted in high-risk methanol-ethanol exposure scenarios. This indicates that ethanol would not likely exacerbate methanol toxicity to the point of teratogenicity; however, {{it is important to note}} that the developmental toxicity of ethanol—an established human teratogen—was not included in the evaluation. Ethanol 2 ̆ 7 s contribution as a developmental toxicant rather than merely as an attenuator of methanol toxicity undermines the severity of effects possible from this chemical combination.

In the present work, the CHO-k 1 micronucleus assay in combination with cellular imaging was further evaluated. Firstly, {{the effect of a}} range of S 9 concentrations on micronucleus formation and cytotoxicity was investigated. Subsequently, the reproducibility and predictivity of the micronucleus assay on CHO-k 1 cells was investigated with a set of four compounds. Then, a larger set of compounds (n= 44) was tested on CHO-k 1 cells and inter-laboratory correlation was calculated. Finally, cellular imaging was compared with flow cytometry for in vivo assessment of micronucleus formation. The concentration of S 9 {{had a significant impact on}} micronucleus formation and cytotoxicity. In addition, calculations of relative cell count (RCC) and cytokinesis-block proliferation index (CBPI) showed to be complementary to cytotoxicity assessment. The CHO-k 1 micronucleus assay correctly classified the four reference compounds, with a dose-response relationship and low variability. Based on a larger set of compounds, the assay proved to be reliable with a sensitivity of 94 % (n = 31) and a specificity of 85 % (n = 13). A correlation coefficient of 97 % was obtained when the lowest observable adverse effect levels (<b>LOAELs)</b> from our study were compared with those published by Diaz et al. (2007) [10]. In conclusion, the in vitro CHO-k 1 micronucleus assay combined with cellular imaging is a predictive assay appropriate for genotoxicity screening at early stages of drug development.

Arbete och Hälsa 2010; 44 (6) : 1 - 220. This document comprises the following phosphate triesters: Tricresyl phosphate TCP Triethyl phosphate TEP Tris(2 -butoxyethyl) phosphate TBEP TIPP Tri-n-butyl phosphate TBP Triisopropylated phenyl phosphate/ isopropylated triphenyl phosphate Tris(2 -chloroethyl) phosphate TCEP Tris(monochloropropyl) phosphate TMCPP Tris(1, 3 -dichloro- 2 -propyl) phosphate TDCPP Triphenyl phosphate TPP Tris(2 -ethylhexyl) phosphate TEHP The phosphate triesters are mainly used as {{flame retardant}}s and plasticisers. They differ widely in physical properties {{as well as}} toxicological profiles and toxic potency. Most of these esters have low vapour pressures and are presumably absorbed to a substantial degree by the skin. The dermal exposure route may therefore {{be more important than}} inhalation. Human toxicological data on the phosphate triesters are scarce, particularly regarding occupational inhalation exposure. Based on animal data, the critical effects vary depending on substance and include cholinesterase inhibition, neurotoxicity, cancer, reproductive toxicity, and liver and kidney toxicity. Organophosphorus-induced delayed neuropathy (OPIDN) has been associated with exposure to some triaryl phosphates. The most well-known example is the TCP isomer tri-ortho-cresyl phosphate (TOCP), which has been associated with numerous cases of poisoning worldwide. The TOCP content is therefore kept at a very low level in commercial phosphate ester products of today. Commercial products of TCP, TIPP and TPP may, however, contain other triaryl phosphates associated with OPIDN. Several other phosphate triesters have shown other (non- OPIDN) neurotoxic effects in animals. Some of the esters covered in this document exhibit carcinogenic effects in animals (TBP, TCEP, TDCPP and TEHP), whereas TCP shows no such potential. The other esters have not been properly tested. The lowest observed adverse effect levels (<b>LOAELs)</b> of the phosphate triesters range from 5 to 600 mg/kg bw/day. The no observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs), only identified for TBEP, TBP and one commercial product of TIPP, are in the range 9 - 20 mg/kg bw/day.

40|$|Drinking water {{disinfectants}} {{react with}} natural organic material (NOM) present in source waters usedfor drinking water {{to produce a}} wide variety of by-products. Several hundred disinfections by-products(DBPs) have been identified, but none have been identified with sufficient carcinogenic potency to account for the cancer risks projected from epidemiological studies. In a search for DBPs that might fill this risk gap, the present study projected reactions of chlorine and chloramine that could occur with substructures present in NOM to produce novel by-products. A review of toxicological data on related compounds, supplemented by use of a quantitative structure toxicity relationship (QSTR) program TOPKAT identified chemicals with a high probability of being chronically toxic and/or carcinogenic among 489 established and novel DBPs. Classes of DBPs that were specifically examined were haloquinones (HQs), related halocyclopentene and cyclohexene (HCP&H) derivatives, halonitriles (HNs), organic N-chloramines (NCls), haloacetamides (HAMs), and nitrosamines (NAs). A review of toxicological data available for quinones suggested that HQs and HCP&H derivatives appeared likely to be of health concern and were predicted to have chronic lowest observed adverse effect levels (<b>LOAELs)</b> in the low g/kg day range. Several HQs were predicted to be carcinogenic. Some have now been identified in drinking water. The broader class of HNs was explored by considering current toxicological data on haloacetonitriles and extending this to halopropionitriles. 2, 2 -dichloropropionitrile has been identified in drinking water at low concentrations, as well as the more widely recognized haloacetonitriles. The occurrence of HAMs has been previously documented. The very limited toxicological data on HAMs suggests that this class would have toxicological potencies similar to the dihaloacetic acids. Organic N-halamines are also known to be produced in drinking water treatment and have biological properties of concern, but no member has ever been characterized toxicologically beyond bacterial or in vitro studies of genotoxicity. The documented formation of several nitrosamines from secondary amines from both natural and industrial sources prompted exploration of the formation of additional nitrosamines. N-diphenylnitrosamine was identified in drinking waters. Of more interest, however, was the formation of phenazine (and subsequently N-chorophenazine) in a competing reaction. These are the first heterocyclic amines that have been identified as chlorination by-products. Consideration of the amounts detected of members of these by-product classes and their probable toxicological potency suggest a prioritization for obtaining more detailed toxicological data of HQs > HCP&H derivatives > NCls > HNs. Based upon a ubiquitous occurrence and virtual lack of in vivo toxicological data, NCls are the most difficult group to assign a priority as potential carcinogenic risks. This analysis indicates that research on the general problem of DBPs requires a more systematic approach than has been pursued in the past. Utilization of predictive chemical tools to guide further research can help bring resolution to the DBP issue by identifying likely DBPs with high toxicological potency...|$|R
40|$|This CICAD 1 on {{heptachlor}} {{was prepared}} by the Fraunhofer Institute of Toxicology and Experimental Medicine, Hanover, Germany. It is an update of the Environmental Health Criteria document on heptachlor (IPCS, 1984) and includes data from the IARC (2001) and JMPR (1992) reports. A comprehensive literature search of relevant databases was conducted from 2000 up to February 2004 to identify any relevant references published subsequent to those incorporated in these reports. Information on the source documents is presented in Appendix 2. Information on the peer review of this CICAD is presented in Appendix 3. This CICAD was considered and approved as an international assessment {{at a meeting of}} the Final Review Board, held in Hanoi, Viet Nam, on 28 September - 1 October 2004. Participants at the Final Review Board meeting are presented in Appendix 4. The International Chemical Safety Card on heptachlor (ICSC 0743), produced by the International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS, 2003), has also been reproduced in this document. Heptachlor (CAS No. 76 - 44 - 8) is a chlorinated dicyclopentadiene insecticide that is persistent in the environment and accumulates in the food-chain. Although its use has been banned or severely restricted in many countries since the 1980 s, it is still detected as a contaminant in some food commodities. This is due to its persistence, but it also suggests the illegal use of this pesticide in the recent past or present (or maybe its permitted use in some countries). Heptachlor is one of several organochlorine pesticides that are persistent in the environment. Concentrations in body tissues and in the environment of all these compounds together are several times greater than those of heptachlor and/or heptachlor epoxide (a persistent heptachlor metabolite) alone. Heptachlor released into the environment can be transformed by abiotic processes, such as the transformation by photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals, and it is transformed in the presence of water to compounds such as 1 -hydroxychlordene or heptachlor epoxide (such as, for example, in moist soils). In addition, it can be removed to some extent from aquatic systems by evaporation and has a limited potential to leach from soil into groundwater due to its elevated soil sorption coefficient. It is not readily biodegraded, but it is transformed biologically (i. e. by bacteria, fungi, plants, animals), mainly to the stable heptachlor epoxide. The data available on the bioconcentration potential of this lipophilic chlorinated hydrocarbon indicate that it and its stable epoxide will bioaccumulate, which can be shown from the extent of heptachlor/heptachlor epoxide still detected in environmental samples. The main exposure routes for heptachlor are probably via application-related inhalation or skin penetration, from extended exposure to dusts containing heptachlor in, for example, homes treated with this compound to control termites, and indirectly by uptake from food contaminated with heptachlor from crops or from other foods via the food-chain. However, heptachlor is a component of technical chlordane as well as a metabolite of chlordane, and thus identification of heptachlor or heptachlor epoxide does not always signify unequivocally that the primary exposure was to heptachlor (or heptachlor epoxide) per se. A survey of recent studies shows that heptachlor and/or heptachlor epoxide are found in all environmental compartments - air, water, soil, and sediment - as well as in plants (vegetables), fish and other aquatic organisms, amphibians and reptiles, birds and bird eggs, and aquatic and terrestrial mammals. They are found particularly in adipose tissues, where they accumulate. They pass up the food-chain. They are detected in human serum, adipose tissue, including breast tissue, and human breast milk. Heptachlor is readily absorbed via all routes of exposure and is readily metabolized. The major faecal metabolites include heptachlor epoxide, 1 -hydroxychlordene, and 1 -hydroxy- 2, 3 -epoxychlordene. In liver microsomes incubated with heptachlor, 85. 8 % was metabolized to heptachlor epoxide in rats, but only 20. 4 % in humans. Other metabolites identified in the human liver microsome system were 1 -hydroxy- 2, 3 - epoxychlordene (5 %), 1 -hydroxychlordene (4. 8 %), and 1, 2 -dihydroxydihydrochlordene (0. 1 %). Heptachlor epoxide is metabolized slowly and is the most persistent metabolite; it is stored mainly in adipose tissue, but also in liver, kidney, and muscle. Females appear to store more heptachlor epoxide than males. A period of 12 weeks was required for complete disappearance from the fat after discontinuing heptachlor feeding in rats. In humans and laboratory animals, placental transfer of heptachlor and/or heptachlor epoxide has been shown. Acute oral LD 50 s for heptachlor for the rat and mouse are 40 - 162 and 68 - 90 mg/kg body weight, respectively. The acute toxicity of heptachlor in animals is associated with central nervous system disturbances, such as hyperexcitability, tremors, convulsions, and paralysis. The acute toxicity of heptachlor epoxide is greater than that of heptachlor, whereas that of the other metabolites is much less. In animals fed heptachlor/heptachlor epoxide by diet, gavage, or subcutaneous injection, there is a sharp dose-response curve for mortality. Usually, no marked differences were seen between the treated animals and the controls with respect to body weights and food consumption. However, liver enlargement has been described, associated with accentuated lobulation, and histopathological findings showed enlargement of centrilobular and midzonal hepatocytes. Fertility studies in rats injected with heptachlor subcutaneously resulted in <b>LOAELs</b> of 5 mg/kg body weight per day for suppression of reproductive hormone levels, disruptions in female cyclicity, and delays in mating behaviour. In developmental toxicity studies, there were usually no clinical signs of maternal toxicity (dose-related alterations in weight gain) until mortality occurred [NOAEL for maternal toxicity = 3 mg/kg body weight per day]. In one study, reduced litter sizes were noted, but postnatal mortality of the pups was the most obvious finding [NOAEL for pre- or postnatal survival of pups = 6 mg/kg body weight per day]. No teratological effects were observed. There is accumulating evidence that the nervous system and its development are influenced by cyclodiene pesticides. The profile of effects produced by repeated heptachlor administration to female rats consisted of altered activity, hyperexcitability, and autonomic effects [NOAEL = 2 mg/kg body weight per day]. Neurotoxicological studies on perinatal heptachlor exposure in the rat (0. 03, 0. 3, or 3 mg/kg body weight per day) suggested developmental delays, alterations in GABAergic neurotransmission, and neurobehavioural changes, including cognitive deficits at all doses. Immunological studies in rats indicate the suppression of the primary IgM and secondary IgG anti-sheep red blood cell responses following perinatal exposure to all tested doses (0. 03, 0. 3, or 3 mg/kg body weight per day) of heptachlor. Heptachlor, technical-grade heptachlor, heptachlor epoxide, and a mixture of heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide have been tested for carcinogenicity by oral administration in several strains of mice and rats. Heptachlor/heptachlor epoxide and technical-grade heptachlor were shown to be carcinogenic in male and female mice but not in rats. In an initiation-promotion assay, heptachlor was active as a promoter after initiation by N-nitrosodiethylamine. Heptachlor shows mostly negative responses in in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity testing. Heptachlor causes in vitro inhibition of gap junctional intercellular communication, also suggesting a non-genotoxic carcinogenic mechanism. Available epidemiological data do not show a clear relationship between adverse health effects and exposure to heptachlor. A tolerable intake was therefore developed from experimental studies. As hepatic tumours induced by heptachlor in mice are likely to be induced by a nongenotoxic mechanism and as non-neoplastic effects were observed at doses 1 / 20 th of those inducing tumours, nonneoplastic effects (i. e. histopathological effects in the liver, neurotoxicological effects, and immunotoxicological effects) were used to derive the tolerable intake. The NOAEL for hepatic effects observed in dogs was 25 ?g/kg body weight per day, and that for neurotoxicity and immunotoxicity observed in studies in rats was 30 ?g/kg body weight per day. Applying an uncertainty factor of 10 for each of inter- and intraspecies variation and an additional factor of 2 for inadequacy of the database to the NOAEL in dogs gives a tolerable intake of 0. 1 ?g/kg body weight per day for the non-neoplastic effects. Daily dietary intakes of heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide in Poland were estimated at 0. 51 - 0. 58 ?g per person (about 0. 01 ?g/kg body weight, assuming a mean weight of 64 kg). This value is 10 -fold less than the tolerable intake of 0. 1 ?g/kg body weight. However, if food is contaminated with heptachlor, such as fish from contaminated rivers (e. g. concentrations in fish in the 0. 1 - 1 mg/kg range reported recently in some areas), vegetables from fields contaminated with heptachlor (up to 16 mg/kg), or contaminated milk (e. g. in the microgram per kilogram to milligram per kilogram range in some regions), then the dietary intake of this chemical would be much higher, and there would be a likely health risk if the contaminated food is ingested for a long period of time. For breast-fed children, taking the highest reported values for heptachlor epoxide in human breast milk and assuming a daily milk consumption of 150 g/kg body weight and an average milk fat content of 3. 1 %, a mean intake of 1. 5 ?g/kg body weight can be calculated. This value is more than 10 -fold higher than the tolerable intake of 0. 1 ?g/kg body weight per day and, if the concentrations reported are correct, should be a cause of concern. The acute toxicity of heptachlor was tested using a variety of aquatic species from different trophic levels. Heptachlor was shown to be toxic to fish and other aquatic species. However, there is a great deal of variability in the levels of toxicity reported, possibly due to evaporation of heptachlor, thereby reducing the actual concentration of the test compound from the nominal test concentration over time. For the freshwater environment, 23 toxicity values were chosen to derive a guidance value. A guidance value for heptachlor, based on the species sensitivity distribution, for the protection of 99 % of species with 50 % confidence was derived at 10 ng/l. In many locations, freshwater heptachlor concentrations exceed the guidance value; the highest reported heptachlor concentration measured in fresh surface water, 62 000 ng/l, exceeds it more than 1000 -fold. For the marine environment, 18 toxicity values were chosen to derive a guidance value. A guidance value for heptachlor, based on the species sensitivity distribution, for the protection of 99 % of species with 50 % confidence was derived at 5 ng/l. For seawater, the highest reliable value for heptachlor present is about 0. 15 ng/l, so the guidance value is not exceeded, suggesting a low risk for the marine environment. From the few data available, heptachlor appears to exhibit moderate toxic effects upon terrestrial vertebrates. None of the studies appears reliable enough to serve as a basis for a quantitative risk characterization. It should be remembered that heptachlor is used as a termiticide. In studies on rats, heptachlor has been shown to be neurotoxic and immunotoxic at 0. 03 mg/kg body weight per day. The Göksu Delta, Turkey, which is one of the most important breeding and wintering areas for birds in the world, is contaminated by organochlorine pesticides from soils from agricultural areas that have been transported to the delta by the Göksu River. From this region, levels of heptachlor/heptachlor epoxide have been detected in birds and bird eggs in the lower milligram per kilogram range. The effect of such concentrations of heptachlor on the bird populations can only be speculated at present due to lack of data; however, there is a potential risk for the terrestrial environment in this location...|$|R
