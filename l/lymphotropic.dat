Of note, recent studies suggest that only ~5% of the lymphoid-derived CD4 T cells targeted by HIV are permissive and become productively infected with the virus. More than 95% of the CD4 T cells that die are resting and are unable to support productive infection. These cells undergo abortive infection with HIV. Cell death is triggered when the host cell detects HIV foreign DNA intermediates and initiates a suicidal death pathway in an attempt to protect the host, leading to caspase-1 activation in inflammasomes, thus causing pyroptosis (a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death).|$|E

50|$|Gross {{was a major}} {{proponent of}} the {{possibility}} that some cancers can be caused by viruses and began a long search for viral causes of murine leukemia. In the course of these studies, he isolated the Gross murine leukemia virus strain as well as the first polyomavirus, so named for its proclivity to cause cancers in multiple tissue types. Gross murine leukemia virus is a retrovirus whose counterpart in humans is human T cell <b>lymphotropic</b> virus I (HTLV-I), while murine polyomavirus is closely related to the human Merkel cell polyomavirus that causes most forms of Merkel cell carcinoma. Thus, Gross identified two critical animal viruses that serve as models for viruses causing cancer in humans. His encyclopedic textbook Oncogenic Viruses is still considered a leading source book for early work in the discovery of viruses causing cancer.|$|E

See also HPV vaccine. He is also credited with discovery of the virus causing genital warts (HPV 6) and a monkey <b>lymphotropic</b> polyomavirus that is a close relative to a recently discovered human Merkel cell polyomavirus, as well as techniques to immortalize cells with Epstein-Barr virus and to induce replication of the virus using phorbol esters. His work on papillomaviruses and cervical cancer received a great deal of scientific criticism on initial unveiling but subsequently was confirmed and extended to other high-risk papillomaviruses.|$|E
5000|$|While {{there is}} no present {{licensed}} vaccine, there are many factors which make a vaccine against HTLV-1 feasible. The virus displays relatively low antigenic variability, natural immunity does occur in humans, and experimental vaccination using envelope antigens {{has been shown to}} be successful in animal models. Plasmid DNA vaccines elicit potent and protective immune responses in numerous small-animal models of infectious diseases. However, their immunogenicity in primates appears less potent. In the past two decades a large initiative has been put forth to understand the biological and pathogenic properties of the human T-cell <b>lymphotropic</b> virus type 1 (HTLV-1); this has ultimately led to the development of various experimental vaccination and therapeutic strategies to combat HTLV-1 infection. These strategies include the development of envelope glycoprotein derived B-cell epitopes for the induction of neutralizing antibodies, as well as a strategy to generate a multivalent cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against the HTLV-1 Tax antigen. A vaccine candidate that can elicit or boost anti-gp46 neutralizing antibody response may have a potential for prevention and therapy against HTLV-1 infection.|$|E
50|$|HTLV-I is an {{abbreviation}} for human T-cell <b>lymphotropic</b> virus type 1, also called human T-cell leukemia type 1, {{a virus that}} has been implicated in several kinds of diseases, including HTLV-I-associated myelopathy, and as a virus cancer link for leukemia (see adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma).HTLV-1 has six reported subtypes (subtypes A to F). The great majority of infections are caused by the cosmopolitan subtype A. HTLV was discovered by Robert Gallo and colleagues in 1980. Between 1 in 20 and 1 in 25 infected people are thought to develop cancer {{as a result of}} the virus. HTLV-1 infection is thought to spread only through dividing cells since reverse transcriptase generates proviral DNA from genomic viral RNA, and the provirus is integrated into the host genome by viral integrase after transmission. Therefore, the quantification of provirus reflects the number of HTLV-1-infected cells. So, an increase in numbers of HTLV-1-infected cells using cell division, by actions of accessory viral genes, especially tax, may provide an enhancement of infectivity tax expression induces proliferation, inhibits the apoptosis of HTLV-1-infected cells and, conversely, evokes the host immune response, including cytotoxic T cells, to kill virus-infected cells.|$|E
5000|$|A {{urogenital}} pelvic malignancy is {{a regional}} {{lymph node involvement}} in urogenital malignancies (category N in the TNM classification system) is a significant radiologic finding, with important implications for treatment and prognosis. Male urogenital pelvic cancers commonly spread to iliopelvic or retroperitoneal lymph nodes by following pathways of normal lymphatic drainage from the pelvic organs. The most likely pathway of nodal spread (superficial inguinal, pelvic, or paraaortic) depends on the tumour location in the prostate, penis, testes, or bladder and whether surgery or other therapy has disrupted normal lymphatic drainage from the tumour site; knowledge of both factors is needed for accurate disease staging. At present, lymph node status is most often assessed with standard anatomic imaging techniques such as multidetector computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, the detection of nodal disease with these techniques is reliant on lymph node size and morphological characteristics, criteria that provide limited diagnostic specificity. Functional imaging techniques, such as diffusion-weighted MRI performed {{with or without a}} <b>lymphotropic</b> contrast agent and positron emission tomography, may allow a more accurate nodal assessment based on molecular or physiologic activity [...]|$|E

5000|$|Dr. Michael Simberkoff, {{chief of}} staff of the Department of Veterans Affairs New York Harbor Medical Center, was a member of the Infectious Diseases staff in 1980 and was one of the first medical {{researchers}} to treat AIDS patients. According to Simberkoff, at first the outbreak was identified as a [...] "gay-related immunodeficiency disease" [...] that his group knew very little about and didn't know how to treat. The Infectious Diseases community began to get together on a regular basis at the VA New York Harbor Medical Center and at the New York Department of Health to share their experiences. Soon it became clear that gay men were not the only ones who had the disease; intravenous drug abusers also appeared to get infected. In 1983, the virus that causes AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) was identified and labeled as Lymphadenopathy Associated Virus (LAV) by Dr. Luc Montagnier at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. In 1984, it was also identified by Dr. Robert Gallo of National Cancer Institute and named the Human T-cell <b>Lymphotropic</b> Virus (HTLV III). There was a conflict as to who first identified the virus, but it was resolved in a joint agreement. The virus was later renamed Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).|$|E
50|$|The human T-lymphotropic virus, human T-cell <b>lymphotropic</b> virus, {{or human}} T-cell leukemia-lymphoma virus (HTLV) family of viruses are {{a group of}} human retroviruses that are known to cause a type of cancer called adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and a demyelinating disease called HTLV-I {{associated}} myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). The HTLVs belong to a larger group of primate T-lymphotropic viruses (PTLVs). Members of this family that infect humans are called HTLVs, {{and the ones that}} infect Old World monkeys are called Simian T-lymphotropic viruses (STLVs). To date, four types of HTLVs (human T-lymphotropic virus 1 HTLV-I, human T-lymphotropic virus 2 HTLV-II, HTLV-III, and HTLV-IV) and four types of STLVs (STLV-I, STLV-II, STLV-III, and STLV-V) have been identified. HTLV types HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 viruses are the first retroviruses which were discovered. Both belong to the oncovirus subfamily of retroviruses and can transform human lymphocytes so that they are self-sustaining in vitro. The HTLVs are believed to originate from intraspecies transmission of STLVs. The original name for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, was HTLV-III. The HTLV-1 genome is diploid, composed of two copies of a single-stranded RNA virus whose genome is copied into a double-stranded DNA form that integrates into the host cell genome, at which point the virus is referred to as a provirus. A closely related virus is bovine leukemia virus BLV.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} several techniques currently available (commercial kits and in-house assays) for diagnosing human T <b>lymphotropic</b> viruses types 1 and 2 in {{two groups of}} patients enrolled at HIV/AIDS specialized care services in São Paulo: Group 1 (G 1), n =  1608, 1237 male/ 371 female, median age 44. 3 years old, majority using {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART); G 2, n =  1383, 930 male/ 453 female, median age of 35. 6 years old, majority HAART naïve. Enzyme immunoassays [(EIA) Murex and Gold ELISA] were employed for human T <b>lymphotropic</b> viruses types 1 and 2 screening; Western blotting (WB), INNO-LIA (LIA), real-time PCR pol (qPCR), and nested-PCR-RFLP (tax) were used to confirm infection. Samples were considered human T <b>lymphotropic</b> viruses types 1 and 2 positive when there was reactivity using {{at least one of the}} four confirmatory assays. By serological screening, 127 / 2991 samples were positive or borderline, and human T <b>lymphotropic</b> virus infection was confirmed in 108 samples (three EIA-borderline) : 56 human T <b>lymphotropic</b> virus type 1 [G 1 (27)  + G 2 (29) ]; 45 human T <b>lymphotropic</b> virus type 2 [G 1 (21)  + G 2 (24) ]; one human T <b>lymphotropic</b> virus type 1  + human T <b>lymphotropic</b> virus type 2 (G 2); six human T <b>lymphotropic</b> virus [G 1 (2)  + G 2 (4) ]. Although there were differences in group characteristics, human T <b>lymphotropic</b> viruses types 1 and 2 prevalence was similar [3. 1 % (G 1) and 4. 2 % (G 2), p =  0. 113]. The overall sensitivities of LIA, WB, qPCR, and PCR-RFLP were 97. 2 %, 82. 4 %, 68. 9 %, and 68. 4 %, respectively, with some differences among groups, likely due to the stage of human T <b>lymphotropic</b> virus infection and/or HAART duration. Indeterminate immunoblotting results were detected in G 2, possibly due to the seroconversion period. Negative results in molecular assays could be explained by the use of HAART, the occurrence of defective provirus and/or the low circulating proviral load. In conclusion, when determining the human T <b>lymphotropic</b> virus infection, the findings highlight that there is a need to consider the blood samples with borderline results in screening assays. Of all the tested assays, LIA was the assay of choice for detecting human T <b>lymphotropic</b> virus type 1 and human T <b>lymphotropic</b> virus type 2 in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 -infected patients...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjective: Human T <b>lymphotropic</b> virus type I infects CD 4 + T {{cells and}} affects cell-mediated immunity. Cardiopulmonary bypass transiently alters {{lymphocyte}} subsets, {{resulting in a}} reduction in CD 4 + T cells {{and an increase in}} CD 8 + T cells. We proposed that cardiovascular operations and human T <b>lymphotropic</b> virus type I infection may act synergistically, resulting in serious damage to cell-mediated immunity. Methods: A total of 517 consecutive patients who were preoperatively screened for anti-human T <b>lymphotropic</b> virus type I antibody and underwent cardiovascular operations with cardiopulmonary bypass were enrolled in this study. Of the 517 patients, 82 (16 %) had positive test results for anti-human T <b>lymphotropic</b> virus type I antibody. The surgical outcome of patients with positive and negative results for anti-human T <b>lymphotropic</b> virus type I antibody was analyzed retrospectively. Results: There was no difference between the 2 groups with respect to early mortality. Distribution of survival curve was also not significantly different (P =. 5; mean follow-up duration, 2. 4 ± 1. 8 years [range, 0 - 9. 4 years] and 3. 2 ± 2. 8 years [range, 0 - 9. 8 years]) in the groups with positive and negative antibody results, respectively). In particular, long-term follow-up did not reveal adult T-cell leukemia or human T <b>lymphotropic</b> virus type I–associated myelopathy, and occurrence of neoplasm did not differ between groups. Early infectious complication was, however, significantly higher in the group with positive antibody results than in the group with negative results (P =. 02). Logistic regression analysis revealed human T <b>lymphotropic</b> virus type I infection as a significant risk for this complication (P =. 04; odds ratio, 2. 5; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 0 - 5. 8). Conclusion: A combination of human T <b>lymphotropic</b> virus type I infection and cardiovascular operation is believed to increase the potential risk of infectious complications shortly after the operation.

40|$|Simian {{immunodeficiency}} viruses, simian T-cell <b>lymphotropic</b> viruses, and simian foamy viruses from nonhuman primates {{have crossed}} the species barrier to humans at several time points, leading to the HIV and human T <b>lymphotropic</b> virus epidemic and to sporadic cases of human infections with simian foamy viruses, respectively. Efficient infection and spread in humans differs between simian foamy virus, simian <b>lymphotropic</b> virus, and simian immunodeficiency virus, but seems also to differ among the different viruses from the same simian lineage, {{as illustrated by the}} different spread of HIV- 1 M, N O, P or for the different HIV- 2 groups. Among the four HIV- 1 groups, only HIV- 1 group M has spread worldwide, and the actual diversity within HIV- 1 M (subtypes, circulating recombinants) is the result of subsequent evolution and spread in the human population. HIV- 2 only spread to some extent in West Africa, and similarly as for HIV- 1, the nine HIV- 2 groups have also a different epidemic history. Four types of human T <b>lymphotropic</b> virus, type 1 to 4, have been described in humans and for three of them simian counterparts (simian T <b>lymphotropic</b> virus- 1, - 2,- 3) have been identified in multiple nonhuman primate species.

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} {{the pain in}} patients infected with human T-cell <b>lymphotropic</b> virus type 1, clinically and epidemiologically. Methods: This systematic review was based on The PRISMA Statement. Four reviewers searched PUBMED, SciELO, LILACS and BIREME for data from observational studies and clinical trials (n ≥  30) regarding pain prevalence, characteristics, and associated factors in patients with human T-cell <b>lymphotropic</b> virus type 1. No limits on publication date or language were established. Studies {{that did not have}} pain as an outcome measure or not involving human T-cell <b>lymphotropic</b> virus type 1 infected patients were excluded. Results: A total of 3013 articles (including duplicates) were found of which seven met the predetermined criteria. The most common pain region was the lower back (53. 0 %). Non-neuropathic type (ranging from 52. 6 % to 86. 8 %) was more frequent in human T-cell <b>lymphotropic</b> virus type 1 -associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis participants, and neuropathic pain was more common in human T-cell <b>lymphotropic</b> virus type 1 carriers (53. 1 %).
