5|$|Unless a star {{is being}} {{observed}} {{from the direction}} of its pole, sections of the surface have some amount of movement toward or away from the observer. The component of movement that is {{in the direction of the}} observer is called the radial velocity. For the portion of the surface with a radial velocity component toward the observer, the radiation is shifted to a higher frequency because of Doppler shift. Likewise the region that has a component moving away from the observer is shifted to a lower frequency. When the absorption <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> star are observed, this shift at each end of the spectrum causes the line to broaden. However, this broadening must be carefully separated from other effects that can increase the line width.|$|E
5|$|When the United States {{took over}} the Philippine Islands from the Spanish in 1898 after the Spanish–American War, President William McKinley began Americanizing the former Spanish colony. In 1900 he {{appointed}} William Howard Taft to head the Philippine Commission to evaluate {{the needs of the}} new territory. Taft, who later became the Philippines' first civilian Governor-General, decided that Manila, the capital, should be a planned town. He hired as his architect and city planner Daniel Hudson Burnham, who had built Union Station and the Postal Square Building in Washington. In Manila, Burnham had in mind a long wide, tree-lined boulevard along the bay, beginning at a park area dominated by a magnificent hotel. To execute Burnham's plans, Taft hired William E. Parsons, a New York City architect, who envisioned an impressive, comfortable hotel along the <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> California mission but grander. The original design was an H-shaped plan that focused on well-ventilated rooms on two wings, providing grand vistas of the harbor, the Luneta, and Intramuros. The top floor was, in fact, a large viewing deck that was used for various functions, including watching the American navy steam into the harbor.|$|E

50|$|This is a single-lined spectroscopic {{binary star}} system with <b>an</b> orbital period <b>of</b> 2.9 years and <b>an</b> {{eccentricity}} <b>of</b> 0.48.

25|$|Medieval and Renaissance cadences {{are based}} upon dyads rather than chords.

25|$|In April 1921, the IRA {{was again}} reorganised, {{in line with}} the Dáil's {{endorsement}} of its actions, along the <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> regular army. Divisions were created based on region, with commanders being given responsibility, in theory, for large geographical areas. In practice, this had little effect on the localised nature of the guerrilla warfare.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrangement}} of poems into couplets encouraged {{the use of}} parallelism: where for two <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> poem it would be expected that the reader would compare and contrast the meaning of two lines, which would be specifically marked by the poet by using the same parts of speech in each position, or in certain key positions in each line, or else within one line.|$|E

25|$|Most writing {{systems are}} not purely one type. The English writing system, for example, {{includes}} numerals and other logograms such as #, $, and &, and the phonemic letter clusters are a complex match to sound. As mentioned above, all logographic systems have phonetic components as well, whether along the <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> syllabary, such as Chinese ("logo-syllabic"), or an abjad, as in Egyptian ("logo-consonantal").|$|E
25|$|Rodgers' {{squadron}} again sailed on October 8, 1812, {{this time}} from Boston, Massachusetts. Three days later, after capturing , Decatur separated from Rodgers and his squadron and with United States continued to cruise eastward.

As the ship slowly rose over the horizon, Captain Decatur made out the fine, familiar <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> , <b>a</b> British frigate bearing 38 guns.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the summer}} of 1940, Daniel Mayer was asked by Leon Blum to {{reconstitute}} the SFIO (in ruins because of Paul Faure's defection to the Vichy regime). In March 1941 Daniel Mayer created, with other socialists like Suzanne Buisson and Félix Gouin, the Comité d'action socialiste (CAS) in Nîmes. The same thing was created by Jean-Baptiste Lebas in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais (administratively joined with Belgium) in January 1941, along the <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> prior network created in September 1940.|$|E

Sets of closely related accessions named Col-0, Col-1, etc., have been obtained and characterized; in general, mutant lines are available through stock centers, of which best-known are the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Center-NASC and the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center-ABRC in Ohio, USA.|$|E
25|$|The most voluminous legal {{material}} written {{after the}} 8th century {{takes the form}} of notes upon that earlier material. There have been numerous questions about the degree to which such glossators understood the material they worked on. However, {{it is also possible that}} in some cases jurists used the earlier material for a legitimate method of explaining how the law had come to work. This material takes two main forms: glossing between the <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> text, and mini texts that begin with a quote from earlier legal material.|$|E
25|$|Some {{microphones}} such as condenser microphones require power. An {{alternative to}} battery power is phantom power, {{which consists of}} direct current applied equally through the two signal <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> balanced audio connector, usually a three-pin XLR connector. The supply voltage is referenced to the ground pin of the connector (pin 1 of an XLR), which normally {{is connected to the}} cable shield or a ground wire in the cable or both. Phantom power is usually supplied at a nominal 48 volts DC, although lower voltages are permissible and modern microphones will often operate over a wide range.|$|E

25|$|Einstein {{predicted}} the gravitational redshift {{of light from}} the equivalence principle in 1907, and it was predicted that this effect might be measured in the spectral <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> white dwarf star, which has a very high gravitational field. Initial attempts to measure the gravitational redshift of the spectrum of Sirius-B, were done by Walter Sydney Adams in 1925, but the result was criticized as being unusable due to the contamination from light from the (much brighter) primary star, Sirius. The first accurate measurement of the gravitational redshift of a white dwarf was done by Popper in 1954, measuring a 21km/sec gravitational redshift of 40 Eridani B.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of scholars consider {{the book to}} {{be made up of}} six distinct oracles. According to this scheme, the book of Malachi consists of a series of disputes between Yahweh and the various groups within the Israelite community. In the course of the book's three or four chapters, Yahweh is vindicated while those who do not adhere to the law of Moses are condemned. Some scholars have suggested that the book, as a whole, is structured along the <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> judicial trial, a suzerain treaty or a covenant—one of the major themes throughout the Hebrew Scriptures. Implicit in the prophet's condemnation of Israel's religious practices is a call to keep Yahweh's statutes.|$|E
25|$|Young larvae {{are dark}} {{yellowish}} green with a pale yellow {{band in the}} middle of the abdomen. From the head, which is moderately large, the body increases in thickness rapidly to the 4th or 5th segment and then tapers gradually down to the tail. It has four pairs of spines. The colour is at first smoky black, but at the last moult becomes a light clear green faintly marked with <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> darker shade. The fully grown larva is green, fusiform and having small black spots. It has a pair of osmeterium and black spines on each thoracic segment, the third pair being orange yellow. A fourth pair is situated on the last segment. The caterpillars undergo five instars over a period of 15–16 days, during which many are attacked by parasitoid wasps.|$|E
