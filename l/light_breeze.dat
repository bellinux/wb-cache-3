Rain had been falling for several hours, turning the field into a muddy mess that would hinder play throughout the game. 62,850 tickets were sold for the game, and that number was given as the official attendance. Real attendance estimates range from 40,000-50,000, due to the poor weather {{and the fact that}} the stadium was half-empty through much of the game.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Orbetello, {{also known}} as the Battle of Isola del Giglio, was a major naval {{engagement}} of the Franco-Spanish War of 1635. It was fought on 14 June 1646 off the Spanish-ruled town of Orbetello, on the coast of Tuscany, Italy, between a French fleet led by Admiral Armand de Maillé, Marquis of Brézé, and a Spanish fleet commanded by Miguel de Noronha, 4th Count of Linhares sent to break the blockade of Orbetello and relieve the town, besieged since 12 May by a French army under the command of Prince Thomas of Savoy. The Battle of Orbetello was tactically very unusual, since it was fought by sailing ships towed by galleys in a <b>light</b> <b>breeze.</b>|$|E
5|$|While Keats had {{remained}} with his prize Saumarez {{had led the}} remainder of the squadron forward, although Audacious had been left far behind the rest of the British force. The French and Spanish ships had scattered as Superb attacked the rearguard and during the night each made their way separately to the rendezvous off Cadiz harbour. As dawn broke at 04:00 on 13 July, lookouts on the leading British ship of the line Venerable under Captain Samuel Hood spotted the French ship Formidable, under the command of Captain Amable Troude in the absence of Linois, to the north. Formidable was trailing the rest of the squadron, close to the shore in Conil Bay to the south of Cadiz and north of Cape Trafalgar. The wind was light and coming from the land and so Caesar and Spencer, the latter being a long way behind the others, were unable to approach the French ship and it was left to Venerable and Thames, both inshore and therefore better able {{to make use of the}} wind, to lead the attack. Formidable had only jury topmasts following the battle on 6 July, and so Hood was able to rapidly approach the French ship, coming under fire from Troude's stern guns at 05:15, Hood holding off from replying until 05:20 so as to not delay his progress. The <b>light</b> <b>breeze</b> was at that point in Hood's favour, and Venerable was able to come close alongside Formidable and open fire with a full broadside. Off Cadiz, the remnants of Moreno's squadron formed up with the intention of sailing to Formidables aid, but were struck by a calm and could only watch the battle to the south.|$|E

25|$|The action {{began at}} 8 a.m. and lasted until nearly 10 a.m., in almost {{complete}} calm, until the French vessel struck. However, Milbrooks rigging was so badly cut and her boats holed, {{that she was}} unable to take possession of her prize; seeing this, when a <b>light</b> <b>breeze</b> came up the French vessel used her sails and sweeps to escape. In the action Milbrook had ten of her carronades dismounted, and had 12 men (out of a crew of 47) wounded. At one point Milbrook had only three carronades firing as she used her sweeps to change her position and had to endure the raking fire from her opponent for 15 minutes. Milbrook was so damaged that she had to be towed into the Tagus.|$|E
25|$|Any wind {{stronger}} than a <b>light</b> <b>breeze</b> {{can contribute to}} a rapid accumulation of snow on sheltered slopes downwind. Wind slab forms quickly and, if present, weaker snow below the slab may {{not have time to}} adjust to the new load. Even on a clear day, wind can quickly load a slope with snow by blowing snow from one place to another. Top-loading occurs when wind deposits snow from the top of a slope; cross-loading occurs when wind deposits snow parallel to the slope. When a wind blows over the top of a mountain, the leeward, or downwind, side of the mountain experiences top-loading, from the top to the bottom of that lee slope. When the wind blows across a ridge that leads up the mountain, the leeward side of the ridge is subject to cross-loading. Cross-loaded wind-slabs are usually difficult to identify visually.|$|E
25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 29 September 1803, Jackall sighted and chased a sloop running along the shore between Nieuport and Dunkirk. The wind fell so Leaver sent 11 men in a boat to board the quarry. As the British approached, the sloop ran ashore near three field pieces and a small battery of two guns, and her crew of 10 or 12 men escaped on shore. Jackall, which had been using her sweeps, and {{with the assistance of}} a <b>light</b> <b>breeze</b> that had arisen, came up and provided support for the boat and the sloop, which the boarding party had gotten off. The sloop turned out to be from Dunkirk, armed with four 2-pounder guns, and possibly serving to transport troops. Despite the fire from the sloop before she grounded, and the guns on shore, which were within 25 yards of the sloop, the British sustained no casualties. The sloop turned out to be San Façon.|$|E

25|$|The French were {{severely}} mauled by Saumarez's squadron, several French ships also running aground, but {{the wind}} prevented the British from {{taking advantage of the}} opportunity to closely engage them. Hannibal was under heavy fire from the anchored Formidable and an array of Spanish batteries and gunboats, and could not bring her guns to bear on them. The main and mizzen masts were shot away, and her casualties mounted, while attempts to pull the ship off the shoal failed. The British force had suffered considerable damage to sails, masts and rigging, and in the <b>light</b> <b>breeze,</b> Saumarez saw there was the danger that the remainder of his ships might run aground like the Hannibal. At 13:35 he ordered his squadron to withdraw to Gibraltar, leaving the damaged Hannibal behind. Ferris ordered the survivors of his crew below decks to escape the worst of the fire as the combined guns of the French and Spanish forces turned on the last remaining target. He held out until 14:00, when seeing that further resistance would be futile, he ordered the colours struck, and the Hannibals ensign came down.|$|E
25|$|The {{builders}} {{had tested}} the hull form {{in their own}} tank, and hoped to attain a speed of 20 knots (37.04km/h) with the turbine machinery. On 14 June the first steam trial was supervised personally by C. A. Parsons and John Williamson, then on 17 June during manoeuvring trials in calm weather the mean speed of two runs over the measured mile at Skelmorlie was 18.66 knots (34.56km/h). After full hull cleaning at Scott's of Greenock a further series of trials took place on 24 June: in seven return runs over the mile, the best mean speed attained was 19.7 knots (36.48km/h). On {{the next day at}} the Pointhouse yard of A. & J. Inglis the central propeller of 4ft (1.22 m) diameter was exchanged for one of 4ft 9inches (1.45 m) diameter, and the outer propellers of 2ft 10inches (0.86 m) diameter were exchanged for propellers 3ft 4inches (1.02 m) diameter. Trials on 26 June with smooth sea conditions and a <b>light</b> <b>breeze</b> achieved a mean of 20.48 knots (37.93km/h) and a fastest single run at 20.57 knots (38.1km/h). At the official trial on 28 June, invited guests came aboard off Craigendoran, and the ship then sailed to Campbeltown with intermediate visits to Dunoon, Rothesay, Largs, Fairlie and Lochranza, where Duchess of Hamilton waited with a special party of members of the Institute of Naval Architects. The two ships raced down Kilbrannan Sound and King Edward passed the paddle steamer without difficulty. A dinner in the after saloon was presided over by Peter Denny, who with other speakers commented on the speed and smoothness of the turbine steamer, in contrast to the rhythmic surging motion and vibration associated with all paddle steamers.|$|E

500|$|All day {{the chase}} continued: at 12:00 the French fleet were {{approximately}} [...] distant, and {{all through the}} afternoon the British ships slowly gained on their opponents, both sides hampered by long periods of calm weather. To ensure that his fleet {{was in a position}} to intercept the French whichever tack they took, Bridport split his fleet across a wide front, clustered in two trailing groups. At 19:00, Bridport signaled for his ships to attack the rearmost French vessels, and at 19:25 to attack French ships as and when they overhauled them, taking up mutually supportive positions. At 22:30 a calm fell, arresting both fleets until 03:00 on 23 June, when a <b>light</b> <b>breeze</b> from the south-west was enough to allow Bridport's fleet to push onwards so that as dawn rose the French were dead ahead. The main body of the French fleet was sailing in a loose cluster with three or four ships trailing behind and one ship, Alexandre under Captain François Charles Guillemet far to the rear and only [...] from the British vanguard. Alexandre had been a British ship until November 1794, when she had been captured in a sharp engagement with a French squadron in which the ship had been badly damaged. The ship was a poor sailer, and its position was worsened by poor handling by Guillemet who did not follow Villaret's orders to form a line of battle rapidly enough.|$|E
