40|$|Tyre-road {{estimation}} {{methods have been}} the objective of many research programmes throughout the world. Most of these methods aim at estimating the friction components such as tyre longitudinal slip rate κ and friction coefficient μ in the contact patch area. In order to estimate the maximum available friction coefficient μmax, these methods generally use a probabilistic relationship between the grip obtained for <b>low</b> <b>tyre</b> excitations (such as constant speed driving) and the grip obtained for high tyre excitations (such as emergency braking manoeuvre). Confirmation or invalidation of this relationship from experimental results {{is the purpose of}} this paper. Experiments have been carried out on a reference track including several test boards corresponding to a wide textural spectrum. The main advantage of these experiments lies in the use of a vehicle allowing us to accurately build point-by-point relationship between κ and μ. This relationship has been determined for different tyres and pavement textures. Finally, the curves obtained are analysed to check the validity {{of the relationship between the}} current friction coefficient used by the car during normal driving conditions and μmax...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{attempts to}} overcome the two problems of low-quality soil {{and a growing number}} of discarded tyres bymixing low-CBR soil with recycled tyre chips. The compound soil-tyre chips was then stabilised by Portland cement with theaim of using them as a new material in road construction in order to reduce the occurrence of shrinkage cracks. To achievethe purposes of this research three standard geotechnical testing programmes were employed: (1) modified compaction tests,(2) California Bearing Ratio tests (CBR), and (3) unconfined compression tests. The modified compaction test results provedthat for the mixtures having very <b>low</b> <b>tyre</b> chips and cement content, the behaviour is very complex. It was also observed thatthe greater the percentage of rubber added the lower the global density. However, this is predictable as the specific gravityof the rubber is much lower than that of the soil. For the relationship between the optimum moisture content (OMC) and thecement content, it was observed that there is no clear pattern. For the specimens having no cement added, the CBR for unsoaked specimens was observed to be greater than that forsoaked specimens. However, when the cement was introduced the CBR test showed that the resistance to penetration for thesoaked specimens was significantly greater, indicating the effects of cement added on the strength. In addition, it was foundthat the CBR values for both soaked and unsoaked specimens gradually increased with the increase of cement content. Lastly, the unconfined compressive strength progressively increased with the increased percentage of cement...|$|E
40|$|The Institute for Road Safety Research SWOV {{carried out}} an {{inspection}} of the tyres of approximately 6000 cars in the Netherlands during November 1976 {{in order to measure}} their tread-depths. The sample was taken at the parking lots of roadside restaurants, motels, and modern shopping centres and showed a slight bias in favour of newer cars. By weighting the sample a representative picture was obtained for all cars used on the roads. The weighting was carried out using data from the monthly car survey of the central bureau of statistics in the Netherlands. The percentage of cars with smooth tread tyres was much smaller than obtained by other inspections of select samples. Only 1. 3 per cent of the cars had one or more tyres with a tread-depth of less than 1 mm (the legal minimum); a further 4. 9 per cent had one or more tyres with a tread-depth of 1 to 1. 6 mm. These percentages were slightly lower than the results which the SWOV obtained in 1974 during a comparable inspection. There are indications that the situation in 1979 hardly differs from that in 1976. Although the percentage of smooth tread tyres is small, the annual number of fatal and injury accidents in the Netherlands would decline by about 500 if all tyres with a tread-depth of less than 1. 6 mm were to be replaced. The SWOV emphasizes that an insufficient tread-depth is not the only tyre aspect which threatens the safety of car occupants. Other tyre characteristics which can {{have a negative effect on}} road safety are: <b>low</b> <b>tyre</b> pressure, dried-out tyres, holes and tears, irregular wear, and combining diagonal-ply and radial-ply tyres on the same car...|$|E

40|$|Excessive {{behaviour}} {{of vehicles}} {{is often the}} subject of study, motivated by either the development of active safety systems uch as ESP, or the improvement of vehicle performance such as for racecars. In all of these cases, combined slip {{needs to be taken}} into account. In many cases however, the full set of tyre characteristics is not available. Consequently, one needs to work with inaccurate combined slip properties based on estimated slip stifnesses and friction levels. It would be a great advantage if combined slip characteristics could be estimated accurately, especially for truck tyres and racecar tyres, where facilities are rare and testing is very expensive. For passenger cars and light van tyres, about 60 % of the testing effort is spent in combined slip. This means time and costs which could be saved by this accurate estimation. Moreover, apart from this reduction of the testing effort, the estimation could be a tool for assessment in testing tyres in combined slip leading to better quality tests results. Anyhow, it will permit to derive combined slip characteristics when no test-data are available. First, some fundamental aspects in tyre modelling are given with the MF-Tyre Model (Magic Formula) treated in detail. Combined slip as described by the MF-Tyre model is discussed with the characteristics derived and compared with different passenger car tyres. In parallel, combined slip is also studied from a more fundamental scope using the physical Brush Model, with special focus on the ratio between tyre forces under pure slip and combined slip conditions (the weighting functions). Various methods to derive these weighting functions based on pure slip characteristics without testing are treated. Among these, two methods lead to satisfactory results, the Slip Circle Sinusoidal Method (SCS) presented by Pottinger and especially the Practical Slip Similarity Method (PSS), derived and developed by the authors. Among others, these methods will be compared with the Magic Formula fits and the experimental results with observed deviations for the PSS-method in shear force with measurement results bounded by 5 % for large tyre load and less than 8 % for <b>low</b> <b>tyre</b> load. A comparision of the SCS-method and PSS-method with the MF-fits for large slip suggests improvements of the Magic Formula tyre model, Between the various estimations for the prediction of the combined slip based on pure slip characteristics, the Slip Circle Method and the Practical Slip Similarity Method, derived and developed by the authors will lead to a satisfactory prediction with respect to measurement data. In addition, estimated combined slip outside of the measurement range is discussed...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} tractor traffic on grassland yield, soil porosity and penetration resistance in three field trials on contrasting soils in different regions of Norway (medium sand at Tjøtta, Nordland, silty medium sand at Fureneset, Sogn og Fjordane, silt at Løken, Oppland). The trials had a split-plot design with three levels of two wheel-by-wheel tractor passes after each cut (no traffic, light tractor 3 - 4 Mg, heavy tractor 6 - 7 Mg), three different seed mixtures and two fertilization levels. At three other field trials (Balsfjord in Troms, Fjærland in Sogn og Fjordane and Hokksund in Buskerud) impacts of both traffic and the inclusion of clovers in the seed mixture on grassland yield and penetration resistance were studied. These trials had a split-plot design with three levels of one wheel-by-wheel tractor and harvesting machinery pass and three different seed mixtures. During the first three ley years the yield reduction by tractor traffic was 26 % at Løken, 4 % at Fureneset and zero at Tjøtta. There was {{a positive correlation between}} yield reduction and the soil moisture content at wheeling. Tractor traffic reduced pore volume and air capacity and increased bulk density, degree of compactness and penetration resistance, with the largest effect on the silty soil at Løken and the smallest on the sandy soil at Tjøtta. Prediction of soil compaction by using the Terranimo® model gave a good picture of the situation at Fureneset and Tjøtta, but at Løken the soil was far more compacted than predicted by the model. The depth of tracks after wheeling was not found to give a reliable measure of soil compaction effects, as the yield reduction on the silty soil at Løken was far larger than at Tjøtta and Fureneset at the same level of track depth. In the field trials at Balsfjord, Fjærland and Hokksund the yield reduction after wheeling varied between 8 and 27 % and penetration resistance increased. Inclusion of clovers (red and white) in the seed mixture increased yields at second cuts, but 30 % clover compared to 15 % did not affect yields. During these first three years of the experimental period {{there were no significant differences}} in either yield, soil physical properties or penetration resistance between wheeling with light or heavy tractors at any of the sites. At Løken and Fureneset, the experimental period was extended for two years. At Løken the experimental setup was kept the same and the yield reduction from traffic was about 15 %. At Fureneset the number of cuts and wheelings was increased from two to three times per year, and both the fertilization level and tyre pressure were also increased. This gave significant yield reductions in the third cuts. In the last year of the experimental period (2015) there was also a significant beneficial effect on yield of using a light tractor rather than a heavy tractor. Overall soil texture and soil moisture content are major factors explaining traffic effects on soil physical properties and grassland yield. It seems that these factors explain more of the yield reduction than do the weight of tractors and machinery, at least in the short run when using <b>low</b> <b>tyre</b> pressures...|$|E
40|$|Faults in {{actuators}} and sensors {{of vehicle}} dynamics control systems {{can result in}} erroneous control, leading to degraded control performance or even loss of vehicle stability. While many faults in a vehicle dynamics system can be adequately diagnosed at a component level, treating the diagnosis problem using model-based methods on a global vehicle level can offer significant improvements in detectability and sensitivity for certain faults. This thesis presents two model-based approaches for fault detection and isolation (FDI) design, each using a vehicle dynamics model which cover different operating regions of horizontal vehicle motion. The first approach {{is based on the}} linear parameter-varying (LPV) single track model (STM), which adequately models cruising operation with moderate lateral accelerations, low path curvature, and time-varying longitudinal velocity. The design method also accounts for parameter uncertainties arising from variabilities in the tyre cornering stiffness. This application motivates the main theoretical contribution of this thesis, which is concerned with developing a generic FDI design approach for uncertain LPV systems. Methods are proposed to cover the components of the residual-based FDI with structured residuals, comprising the residual generator, single residual evaluation function, and residual pattern evaluation for fault isolation. The residual generator design method takes a reference model following approach, in which the fault-to-residual responses are optimised to follow a specified reference. The synthesis procedure exploits recent developments in robust LPV estimator synthesis that account for uncertainties by means of Integral Quadratic Constraints. To reduce the potential conservatism caused by fixed residual references, this work extends the common formulation by allowing magnitude parameters from the reference model to be optimised concurrently in the semi-definite programs of the synthesis. For residual evaluation, the proposed norm-based evaluation function follows the same robust control paradigm, and a model-based procedure is proposed for the determination of evaluation and threshold parameters. Lastly, for residual structure design, an algorithm is presented to find the smallest set of feasible residuals that achieves the best possible fault isolation. These residual generation and evaluation methods are then applied to the uncertain LPV STM to design the FDI functions. The second presented FDI design approach is based on a nonlinear kinematic model (NKM), which relates wheel speeds and steering angles to the horizontal motion of the vehicle body. The absence of linearisation makes this model valid over all motion directions, but only under the constraint that the tyre slips are negligible. In order to account for the influence of deviations from the model such as small tyre slips and measurement tolerances, this work presents a method to check the feasibility of sets of measurements with respect to the NKM, under the assumption that the deviations are bounded. Functions are also provided to recognise and exclude operating states when <b>low</b> <b>tyre</b> slip is improbable. Fault isolation is achieved by means of structured residuals.
