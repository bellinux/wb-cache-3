5|$|Virginia voters {{approved}} a government-run <b>lottery</b> in 1987. Before the vote, supporters of a <b>lottery</b> suggested {{a number of}} possible ways in which <b>lottery</b> profits could be designated in Virginia, such as education, transportation and Chesapeake Bay cleanup. However, the referendum made no designation of how <b>lottery</b> profits would be spent. Sales began September 20, 1988. In 1989, the General Assembly directed <b>Lottery</b> proceeds to capital construction projects. From 1990 to 1998, the proceeds went to Virginia's General Fund. Starting in 1999, a provision in Virginia's budget called for all proceeds to be assigned exclusively to education. In November 2000, Virginia {{voters approved}} the creation of the State <b>Lottery</b> Proceeds Fund by an 83.5-point margin.

5|$|Entering the 2005 NHL Entry Draft, Crosby {{was listed}} first {{overall in the}} NHL Central Scouting Bureau and International Scouting Services' {{respective}} rankings of prospects.

Days after the election, Wilkinson signed a proclamation calling a special legislative session to begin November 28 to pass legislation to implement the <b>lottery.</b> The call instructed the legislature to consider a bill based on the recommendations of Wilkinson's <b>lottery</b> commission.

5|$|The NHL Entry Draft {{eligibility}} requires {{players to}} have turned 18 years old by September 15 in the year the draft is held, excluding players older than 20 years old before December 31 of that same year, the latter not applying to non-North American players. The draft order {{is determined by the}} previous season's order of finish: non-playoff teams draft first in order of placement in the standings, followed by teams that competed in the post-season whose order is determined by the Stanley Cup playoffs results. Once the regular season is over, a weighted <b>lottery</b> is held for the 14 teams who miss the playoffs, giving teams the opportunity to move up to a higher pick including the first overall selection. From 1995 to 2012, a team that won the <b>lottery</b> could only move up a maximum of four picks, preventing some teams from winning the top selection regardless of winning the <b>lottery.</b> During that time, the Islanders won the <b>lottery</b> twice, receiving the top selection both times (2000 and 2009).

40|$|This paper {{examines}} preferences towards particular <b>lotteries</b> {{of random}} wealth variables. The <b>lotteries</b> consist essentially of two basic dislikes: a certain reduction in wealth and adding a zero-mean independent noise random variable to {{the distribution of}} wealth. We show how concepts such as risk aversion, prudence and temperance can be fully characterized by a preference relation over such <b>lotteries.</b> By nesting these <b>lotteries,</b> we can fully characterize the class of mixed-risk-averse preferences, as defined by Caballé and Pomansky (1996) ...|$|R
40|$|Preference {{relations}} over two-stage <b>lotteries</b> are analyzed. Empirical {{evidence indicates}} that decisionmakers do not always behave {{in accordance with the}} reduction of compound <b>lotteries</b> axiom, but they seem to satisfy a compound independence axiom. Although the reduction and the compound independence axioms, together with continuity, imply expected utility theory, each of them by itself is compatible with all possible preference relations over simple <b>lotteries.</b> Using these axioms, the author analyzes three different versions of expected utility for two-stage <b>lotteries.</b> The author suggests several different compound dominance axioms as possible replacements of the reduction axiom, which are strictly weaker than the reduction of compound <b>lotteries</b> axiom.
