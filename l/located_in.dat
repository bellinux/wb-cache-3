40|$|We use large {{survey data}} sets of firms {{provided}} by the World Bank for China, India, and Brazil 2 ̆ 014 Investment Climate Surveys 2 ̆ 014 to address the important question: what determines the locational choice of firms among cities in these countries. We find that capital cities in all countries are attractive for firms to <b>locate.</b> <b>In</b> India and China, labour-intensive firms tend not to <b>locate</b> <b>in</b> mid-sized or large cities, when compared with smaller ones, perhaps due to higher wage, training and attrition costs. Labour regulations both in India and China deter firms from <b>locating</b> <b>in</b> the larger cities, but not in Brazil. Exporter firms prefer to <b>locate</b> <b>in</b> large cities in these two countries, but not so in the largest cities of Brazil. Finally, while {{the size of a}} firm has no impact on its location decision in China, large firms in India prefer to <b>locate</b> <b>in</b> the largest cities, but not in mid-sized cities. Proximity to inputs within the city has a positive impact on firm location. The post-reform firms in China tend to <b>locate</b> <b>in</b> the large cities whereas in the case of India, post- 1991 firms refrain from <b>locating</b> <b>in</b> the mid-sized or large cities. These findings have important policy implications for urban governance in these countries, which are summarized in the paper. 2 ̆ 013 India; China; Brazil; location choice; industry location; firm locatio...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates firms' optimal {{location}} choices explicitly {{accounting for}} the role of inwards and outwards knowledge spillovers in a dynamic Cournot oligopoly with firms that are heterogeneous in their ability to carry out cost-reducing R&D. Firms can either <b>locate</b> <b>in</b> an industrial cluster or in isolation. Technological spillovers are exchanged between the firms in the cluster. It is shown that a technological leader has an incentive to <b>locate</b> <b>in</b> isolation only if her advantage exceeds a certain threshold, which is increasing in firms' discount rate, in industry dispersion, and in the intensity of knowledge spillovers. Scenarios are identified where although it is optimal for the technological leader to <b>locate</b> <b>in</b> isolation, from a welfare perspective it would be desirable that she <b>locates</b> <b>in</b> the cluster...|$|R
