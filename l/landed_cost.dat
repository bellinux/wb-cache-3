40|$|This thesis explores how a {{retailer}} should determine whether to source goods domestically vs. directly by imports through international sourcing. Through the research a <b>landed</b> <b>cost</b> model {{was developed and}} designed to calculate the total <b>landed</b> <b>cost</b> of items that were shipped from overseas locations into the US. The <b>landed</b> <b>cost</b> model is different from typical models in that it integrates the physical size of the item to be imported into the total <b>landed</b> <b>cost</b> considerations. With the <b>landed</b> <b>cost</b> estimates at SKU level, the decision of whether to import or to source domestically is derived. What attributes make better import candidates over others given that a <b>landed</b> <b>cost</b> calculator outputs "yes" to import? What {{are some of the}} risks? In addition to creating a <b>landed</b> <b>cost</b> calculator, the research presents approaches around these questions. The characteristics of good import candidates are analyzed through evaluating the variables that contribute to total <b>landed</b> <b>cost.</b> Basker and Van (2008) present theories that examine the two way relationship between the size of a dominant retailer and the imports of consumer goods. They conclude that a chain needs to reach a threshold size before it begins to import. Benchmark studies of import giants like Wal-Mart are presented in this paper to understand how a longer history in the retail sector along with a robust IT infrastructure gives a company an advantage in importing retail goods. The results of this research can help retail companies with new and small import programs understand the variables that are needed to calculate total landed costs with the consideration of container utilization. Additionally it will help the retailer to decide on the best items to import in a smaller program until they can acquire economies of scale through higher import quantities. Ordering methods such as the Periodic Order Quantity Method (POQ) for fixed order periods with variable demand and Newsvendor models for advance ordering are also addressed. The results show that given several import items of varying sizes, there is an optimum region of importing which relates to COGS, size, inventory holding cost, delta of domestic to imports COGS, demand and other costs. The retailer can find this optimum region by applying analytical techniques to evaluate the candidates that are under consideration for importing. In addition to these findings, the organizational and infrastructural needs of a small imports program are addressed. The research also ties in globalization of the retail industry and the world market economy into shifts in the retailer's decisions. by Sophia E. Scipio. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Global {{operation}} {{strategies have}} been widely used in the last several decades as many companies and industries have taken advantage of lower production costs. However, in choosing a location, companies often only consider labor cost and, as a result, overall costs may not be reduced. What other costs besides labor should be considered in locating a global facility? This research examines sourcing, manufacturing and distribution costs and develops a total <b>landed</b> <b>cost</b> model for global operations. We use this total <b>landed</b> <b>cost</b> model to estimate the total cost from raw material to the customer for one sample company operation, Tyco Electronics, across multiple manufacturing and customer countries. This total <b>landed</b> <b>cost</b> model was used to analyze the cost for each manufacturing location, customer, and mode of transportation as well as predict the effect from risks and uncertainties in global supply chain. by Apichart Jearasatit.

40|$|<b>Land</b> <b>costs</b> {{account for}} a {{significant}} proportion of the total costs for many agricultural products that are traded internationally, especially for the major grain crops that the U. S. exports in competition with several other countries. For owner-operators, a common form of tenure in the U. S. and most other countries, most <b>land</b> <b>costs</b> are implicit and involve few cash outlays, i. e., are opportunity costs that are important in the long-run but that may not affect production decisions in the short-run. To the extent that land is rented or where the owner is making mortgage payments, however, larger explicit <b>land</b> <b>costs</b> are incurred and can be a very significant factor in the cost of production and competitiveness. U. S. cost of production data for most crops in recent years indicate that the returns on equity, including land and other owned resources are zero or negative, i. e., the prices of many farm products are too low to cover total costs when opportunity costs are included as part of the cost of production. Thus, <b>land</b> <b>costs</b> may not be a significant factor in competitiveness in the current policy framework where government payments are {{a significant part of the}} net returns of farm operators.

40|$|Total <b>landed</b> <b>cost</b> {{and supply}} chain risk {{analysis}} are methods that many companies use to assess strategic sourcing decisions. For this project, <b>landed</b> <b>cost</b> {{is defined as}} those costs associated with material movement from a supplier to a designated PerkinElmer, Inc. (PKI) manufacturing site. Tools or models that {{are available in the}} technology marketplace are often too cumbersome to incorporate with a company's existing technology architecture or are too simplistic to compute an accurate <b>landed</b> <b>cost.</b> For PerkinElmer, as their Analytical Sciences business continues to grow globally, they are continuously reviewing their supplier portfolio and assessing their procurement strategy. The <b>landed</b> <b>cost</b> and risk analysis tool consists of two components, a cost model and a risk analysis model. Both models were developed to allow PKI to better understand the savings opportunities associated with a supplier selection. When performing supply chain modeling and cost optimization, it was necessary to be able to evaluate multiple scenarios that can influence a sourcing decision. Therefore, by changing parameters such as transportation mode, lead time, inventory carrying cost, freight cost, order frequency, and order quantities in the dynamic cost model, PKI is able to understand supply chain cost trade-offs. The model developed for this project is dynamic to allow multi-variable scenarios to be assessed simultaneously, thus increasing the overall analysis efficiency. For the risk analysis model, approximately 20 different factors were considered {{as a part of a}} risk portfolio. This concept adapts traditional financial investment portfolio management theory by considering how much operational impact one factor may have on PKI. (cont.) The concept is to consider a diversified portfolio, so all of the possible risk incurred by a sourcing decision does not reside in any one "category" (logistics, inventory, etc.). The outcome of the model is an index and adjusted cost, providing PKI with an estimate of the potential cost of doing business with a supplier based on their risk profile. by Brian Feller. Thesis (M.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on an {{internship}} at Honeywell Aerospace's Integrated Supply Chain (ISC) Leadership division. This work focuses on the role and use of analytical cost models in the strategy development process. The scope of ISC strategic decisions encompasses Honeywell Aerospace's global footprint of external and internal suppliers, and includes insourcing, outsourcing, transition and consolidation activities. The current practice within Honeywell Aerospace is to construct a Transition, Migration, and Integration (TMI) model which calculates the net present benefit associated with a specific transition's spending and savings. This model is the primary tool for strategic plan development. This work looks at the use of the TMI model for strategic planning with the intent of addressing concerns related to the model's complexity and accuracy. This work also develops the framework for estimating a confidence range within the TMI model to provide better visibility to the potential range of financial outcome. An additional tool used {{in the development of the}} strategic plan is the <b>Landed</b> <b>Cost</b> model. (cont.) The <b>Landed</b> <b>Cost</b> model is used to calculate the steady state total cost associated with a particular supply chain. Historically within Honeywell Aerospace ISC planning, the <b>Landed</b> <b>Cost</b> model has been used to much less of a degree than the TMI model. This work develops the role of the <b>Landed</b> <b>Cost</b> model and establishes a framework for estimating labor, logistics, inventory, and tax costs associated with manufacturing products in a variety of global regions. While this work focuses on developing analytical tools, developments and recommendations are provided in the context of the overall strategic decision process. Examples are provided to highlight the major cost drivers associated with a particular transitional activity or supply chain design. Improving the analytical component of the decision process allows ISC Leadership to more accurately and effectively identify tactics for improving operational efficiency and identify potential growth opportunities in emerging regions. by Todd Robinson.
