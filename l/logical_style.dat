The idea is to associate a transition system, i. e., an oriented graph, with a language. A node represents {{the state of the}} abstract machine running the language, usually a pair hprogram, datai.

40|$|In {{order to}} combine {{operational}} and <b>logical</b> <b>styles</b> of specifications in one unified framework, {{the notion of}} logic labelled transition systems (Logic LTS, for short) has been presented and explored by Lüttgen and Vogler in [TCS 373 (1 - 2) : 19 - 40; Inform. & Comput. 208 : 845 - 867]. In contrast with usual LTS, two logical constructors ∧ and ∨ over Logic LTSs are introduced to describe logical combinations of specifications. Hitherto such framework has been dealt with in considerable depth, however, process algebraic style way {{has not yet been}} involved and the axiomatization of constructors over Logic LTSs is absent. This paper tries to develop Lüttgen and Vogler's work along this direction. We will present a process calculus for Logic LTSs (CLL, for short). The language CLL is explored in detail from two different but equivalent views. Based on behavioral view, the notion of ready simulation is adopted to formalize the refinement relation, and the behavioral theory is developed. Based on proof-theoretic view, a sound and ground-complete axiomatic system for CLL is provided, which captures operators in CLL through (in) equational laws. Comment: 52 page...|$|R

40|$|In 2008, Ben-Amram, Jones and Kristiansen {{showed that}} for a simple "core" {{programming}} language - an imperative language with bounded loops, and arithmetics limited to addition and multiplication - {{it was possible to}} decide precisely whether a program had certain growth-rate properties, namely polynomial (or linear) bounds on computed values, or on the running time. This work emphasized the role of the core language in mitigating the notorious undecidability of program properties, so that one deals with decidable problems. A natural and intriguing problem was whether more elements can be added to the core language, improving its utility, while keeping the growth-rate properties decidable. In particular, the method presented could not handle a command that resets a variable to zero. This paper shows how to handle resets. The analysis is given in a <b>logical</b> <b>style</b> (proof rules), and its complexity is shown to be PSPACE-complete (in contrast, without resets, the problem was PTIME).

Results based on descriptive analyses indicated that the <b>logical</b> love <b>style</b> dominated the respondents’ love style (M= 3. 64) followed by friendship love (M= 3. 54), romantic love (M= 3. 10) and sacrificial love (M= 3. 09).

The results also show that the majority of teenagers who were involved in illicit sex were females (65. 6 %), while 34. 6 % were males.
