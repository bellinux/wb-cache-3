40|$|The {{diet and}} predators of Loligo sanpaulensis (Cephalopoda: Loliginidae) on the {{southern}} Brazilian shelf were studied by examining the stomach contents of 668 <b>long-finned</b> <b>squid</b> (12 – 184 mm mantle length) caught by bottom trawl and the stomach contents of 47 potential predators, including stranded penguins and marine mammals as well as fish and cephalopods caught with diverse fishing gears in the region. Of 313 <b>long-finned</b> <b>squid</b> stomachs containing food, fish occurred in 36. 4 % of stomachs, crustaceans in 23. 3 % and cephalopods in 6. 4 %. Identified prey included demersal fish, shrimps and conspecifics. Loligo sanpaulensis was preyed on by 31 of the 47 potential predatory species examined. The frequency of occurrence (FO) was high (> 20 %) in the stomach contents of La Plata dolphins Pontoporia blainvillei, penguins Spheniscus magellanicus, fur seals Arctocephalus spp., the benthic shark Mustelus canis and the benthic finfish Astroscopus sexpinosus and Percophis brasiliensis. It was less important (5 – 20 % FO) for the benthic and demersal fish Helicolenus lahillei, Paralichthys isosceles, P. patagonicus, Merluccius hubbsi and Urophycis mystacea, and of minor importance (2 – 5 % FO) in the diet of the finfish Trichiurus lepturus, Cynoscion guatucupa, Macrodon ancylodon, Pagrus pagrus and Pomatomus saltatrix. Loligo sanpaulensis {{seems to be a}} link in the pelagic and benthic foodwebs of the southern Brazilian shelf, because it is preyed on by such high-level predators as marine mammals and penguins, and by several of the most abundant fish found in the region...|$|E
40|$|Calexcitin (CE) is a calcium sensor {{protein that}} has been implicated in {{associative}} learning. The CE gene was previously cloned from the <b>long-finned</b> <b>squid,</b> Lo-ligo pealei, and the gene product was shown to bind GTP and modulate K 1 channels and ryanodine receptors in a Ca 21 -dependent manner. We cloned a new gene from L. pealei, which encodes a CE-like protein, here named calexcitin B (CEB). CEB has 95 % amino acid identity to the original form. Our sequence analyses indicate that CEs are homologous to the sarcoplasmic calcium-bind-ing protein subfamily of the EF-hand superfamily. Far and near UV circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance studies demonstrate that CEB binds Ca 21 and undergoes a conformational change. CEB is phosphoryl...|$|E
40|$|Between 2007 and 2009, 132, 178 {{cephalopods}} were sampled in the North Sea during ICES International Bottom Trawl Surveys. Most abundant {{were the}} <b>long-finned</b> <b>squids</b> Alloteuthis subulata (124, 751 animals) and Loligo forbesii (3415 animals). Short-finned squids such as Todaropsis eblanae, Todarodes sagittatus and Illex coindetii were rare (195 animals). During winter, A. subulata individuals, mostly immature and maturing, were {{concentrated in the}} central and northern parts of the North Sea. In summer, the abundance of A. subulata, mostly maturing and mature, increased in the southeastern part suggesting a southward migration to spawning grounds. L. forbesii individuals, some fully mature, were abundant in the northwestern part of the North Sea during winter indicating spawning areas in this region. In summer, L. forbesii individuals, mostly immature, occurred in lower numbers throughout the North Sea. Our data provide new information on abundance, distribution, migration, and possible recruitment areas of North Sea cephalopods...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Cephalopods play a {{significant}} role in coastal and oceanic ecosystems, both as con-sumers of invertebrates and small fish and as the prey of some fish, seabirds and marine mam-mals and other large predators. Approximately 30 species of cephalopod have been recorded in the north-eastern Atlantic and adjacent waters, including 18 teuthid (squid), seven sepiolid (bobtail), three sepiid (cuttle fish) and 10 octopod (octopus) species. A number of these are exploited com-mercially and support important target and by-catch fisheries in Western Europe. During the past decade, annual landings of cephalopods from the north-eastern Atlantic (international Council for the Exploration of the sea [iCEs] area) have ranged from 40, 000 to 55, 000 t, including substantial catches of <b>long-fin</b> (loliginid) <b>squid</b> (7000 – 11, 000 t per annum), short-fin (ommastrephid) squid (3000 – 10, 000 t), cuttle fish (including sepiolids; 16, 000 – 24, 000 t) and octopods (12, 000 – 18, 000 t). The most important exploited species in the north-eastern Atlantic are Eledone cirrhosa, Illex coin-detii, Loligo forbesi, Loligo vulgaris, Octopus vulgaris, Todarodes sagittatus, Todaropsis eblanae and Sepia officinalis. other species including Alloteuthis subulata, Gonatus fabricii and certain sepiolids, appear to be abundant and may be marketable. Cephalopods tend to rapidly concentrate heavy metals and other toxic substances in their tissues and this plays an important role in th...|$|R
40|$|The {{neuronal}} protein calexcitin {{from the}} <b>long-finned</b> <b>squid</b> Loligo pealei has been expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. Calexcitin is a 22 kDa calcium-binding protein that becomes up-regulated in invertebrates following Pavlovian conditioning {{and is likely}} to be involved in signal transduction events associated with learning and memory. Recombinant squid calexcitin has been crystallized using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion technique in the orthorhombic space group P 212121. The unit-cell parameters of a = 46. 6, b = 69. 2, c = 134. 8 Å suggest that the crystals contain two monomers per asymmetric unit and have a solvent content of 49 %. This crystal form diffracts X-rays to at least 1. 8 Å resolution and yields data of high quality using synchrotron radiation...|$|E

However, carbon ratios diVered between the two prey species, while the nitrogen ratios did not.

40|$|The {{cylindrical}} {{shape of}} soft-bodied invertebrates {{is well suited}} to functions in skeletal support and locomotion, but {{may result in a}} previously unrecognized cost—large non-uniformities in muscle strain and strain rate among the circular muscle fibres of the body wall. We investigated such gradients of strain and strain rate in the mantle of eight <b>long-finned</b> <b>squid</b> Doryteuthis pealeii and two oval squid Sepioteuthis lessoniana. Transmural gradients of circumferential strain were present during all jets (n = 312); i. e. for a given change in the circumference of the outer surface of the mantle, the inner surface experienced a greater proportional change. The magnitude of the difference increased with the amplitude of the mantle movement, with circular muscle fibres at the inner surface of the mantle experiencing a total range of strains up to 1. 45 times greater than fibres at the outer surface during vigorous jets. Differences in strain rate between the circular fibres near the inner versus the outer surface of the mantle were also present in all jets, with the greatest differences occurring during vigorous jetting. The transmural gradients of circumferential strain and strain rate we describe probably apply not only to squids and other coleoid cephalopods, but also to diverse soft-bodied invertebrates with hollow cylindrical or conical bodies and muscular organs...|$|E
40|$|The {{domestic}} butterfish (Peprilus triacanthus) fishery off the Northeast USA {{has increased}} in importance in recent years, {{to the extent that}} the quantity allocated to foreign countries fishing within USA waters has been decreased to by-catch levels. This restriction resulted in closure of a portion of the foreign squid fishery in 1985, when the by-catch quota for butterfish was exceeded. This analysis is designed to determine co-occurrence between <b>long-finned</b> <b>squid</b> (Loligo pea/ei) and butterfish particularly in directed fisheries for each species with a view that areal, diel, and/or seasonal regulations of these fisheries may be feasible to reduce the potential adverse effects of high by-catch rates. Squid and butterfish exhibited high degrees of overlap in temperature and depth preferences as indicated by seasonal and spatial distribution data from research and fishery sources. Commer-cial fishery data, however, suggested that by-catch of butterfish in the directed squid fishery can be maintained at relatively low levels (~ 6 %), when the fishery was prosecuted offshore during the winter. The domestic USA fishery, operating with effort directed at either species at various times of the year, has not been limited as to by-catch of either species. If a need develops, it is likely that seasonal and areal management measures could result in significant reductions in the by-catch of either species...|$|E
40|$|Nominal {{landings}} of butterfish, PepriZus triaaanthus (Peck), in the Northwest Atlantic {{increased from}} 3, 209 MT in 1964 to {{a peak of}} 19, 454 MT in 1973. Most of the catch during this period was taken by Japan, USSR, Poland, and the USA. Unrepor~ed butterfish by-catch in the <b>long-finned</b> <b>squid,</b> LoZigo peaZei ~ fisheries of several nations, particularly Spain and Italy, were probably significant additionar sources of mortality. Available scientific evidence indicates that during the period 1968 - 1976, fishing mortality rates increased, while mean weight of individuals in the exploitable population and average age at capture generally declined. Exploitation rates (E) ~uring 1972 - 1975 ranged from 0. 35 - 0. 42 [...] Yield per recruit studies (M= 0. 8) suggest that Emax and EO. 1 values are 0. 37 and 0. 27 for a 30 mm mesh net, and 0. 55 and 0. 36 for a 60 mm one. Mean weights of fish in the catch, at EO. 1 ' would be 66 % greater for the larger net (9 ~g), than for the smaller mesh (55 {e@- g). Equilibrium catches resulting from the average annual recruitment of 1, 138. 5 x 106 fish are 14, 540 MT (30 mm mesh) and 18, 945 MT (60 mm mesh), assuming E o. 1.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the ultrastructure, contractile properties, and in vivo length {{changes of the}} fast-acting funnel retractor muscle of the <b>long-finned</b> <b>squid</b> Doryteuthis pealeii. This muscle is composed of obliquely striated, spindle-shaped fibers ~ 3 μm across that have an abundant sarcoplasmic reticulum, consisting primarily of membranous sacs that form ‘dyads’ along the surface of each cell. The contractile apparatus consists of ‘myofibrils’ ~ 0. 25 – 0. 5 μm wide in cross section arrayed around the periphery of each cell, surrounding a central core that contains the nucleus and large mitochondria. Thick myofilaments are ~ 25 nm in diameter and ~ 2. 8 μm long. ‘Dense bodies’ are narrow, resembling Z lines, but are discontinuous and are not associated with the cytoskeletal fibrillar elements that are so prominent in slower obliquely striated muscles. The cells approximate each other closely with minimal intervening intercellular connective tissue. Our physiological experiments, conducted at 17 °C, showed that the longitudinal muscle fibers of the funnel retractor were activated rapidly (8 ms latent period following stimulation) and generated force rapidly (peak twitch force occurred within 50 ms). The longitudinal fibers had low Vmax (2. 15 ± 0. 26 L 0 s− 1, where L 0 was the length that generated peak isometric force) but generated relatively high isometric stress (270 ± 20 mN mm− 2 physiological cross section). The fibers exhibited a moderate maximum power output (49. 9 W kg− 1), compared with vertebrate and arthropod cross striated fibers, at a V/Vmax of 0. 33 ± 0. 044. During ventilation of the mantle cavity and locomotion, the funnel retractor muscle operated in vivo over a limited range of strains (+ 0. 075 to − 0. 15 relative to resting length, LR) and at low strain rates (from 0. 16 to 0. 91 LR s− 1), corresponding {{to a range of}} V/Vmax from 0. 073 to 0. 42. During the exhalant phase of the jet the range of strains was even narrower: maximum range less than ± 0. 04, with the muscle operating nearly isometrically during ventilation and slow, arms-first swimming. The limited length operating range of the funnel retractor muscles, especially during ventilation and slow jetting, suggests that they may act as muscular struts...|$|E
