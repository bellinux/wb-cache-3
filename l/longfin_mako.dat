They include the goblin shark, basking shark, megamouth shark, the thresher sharks, shortfin and <b>longfin</b> <b>mako</b> sharks, and great white shark.

5|$|The sister species {{relationship}} between the longfin and shortfin makos has been confirmed by several phylogenetic studies based on mitochondrial DNA. In turn, the closest relative of the two mako sharks is the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias). Fossil teeth belonging to the <b>longfin</b> <b>mako</b> have been recovered from the Muddy Creek marl of the Grange Burn formation, south of Hamilton, Australia, and from Mizumani Group in Gifu Prefecture, Japan. Both deposits date to the Middle Miocene epoch (15–11 million years ago (Mya).|$|E
5|$|The <b>longfin</b> <b>mako</b> has large {{eyes and}} is {{attracted}} to cyalume sticks (chemical lights), implying {{that it is}} a visual hunter. Its diet consists mainly of small, schooling bony fishes and squids. In October 1972, a 3.4-m-long female with the broken bill from a swordfish (Xiphius gladias) lodged in her abdomen was caught in the northeastern Indian Ocean; whether the shark was preying on swordfish as the shortfin mako does, or encountered the swordfish in some other aggressive context is not known. Adult longfin makos have no natural predators except for killer whales, while young individuals may fall prey to larger sharks.|$|E
500|$|Among {{the most}} ancient and {{primitive}} sharks is Cladoselache, from about 370 million years ago, which has been found within Paleozoic strata in Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee. At that point in Earth's history these rocks made up the soft bottom sediments of a large, shallow ocean, which stretched across much of North America. Cladoselache was only about [...] long with stiff triangular fins and slender jaws. Its teeth had several pointed cusps, which wore down from use. From {{the small number of}} teeth found together, it is most likely that Cladoselache did not replace its teeth as regularly as modern sharks. Its caudal fins had a similar shape to the great white sharks and the pelagic shortfin and <b>longfin</b> <b>makos.</b> The presence of whole fish arranged tail-first in their stomachs suggest that they were fast swimmers with great agility.|$|R
5|$|Widely {{scattered}} records {{suggest that}} the <b>longfin</b> <b>mako</b> shark has a worldwide distribution in tropical and warm-temperate oceans; the extent of its range {{is difficult to determine}} due to confusion with the shortfin mako. In the Atlantic Ocean, it is known from the Gulf Stream off the east coast of the United States, Cuba, and southern Brazil in the west, and from the Iberian Peninsula to Ghana in the east, possibly including the Mediterranean Sea and Cape Verde. In the Indian Ocean, it has been reported from the Mozambique Channel. In the Pacific Ocean, it occurs off Japan and Taiwan, northeastern Australia, a number of islands in the Central Pacific northeast of Micronesia, and southern California.|$|E
5|$|No {{attacks on}} humans have been {{attributed}} to the <b>longfin</b> <b>mako</b> shark. Nevertheless, its large size and teeth make it potentially dangerous. This shark is caught, generally in low numbers, as bycatch on longlines intended for tuna, swordfish, and other pelagic sharks, as well as in anchored gillnets and on hook-and-line. The meat is marketed fresh, frozen, or dried and salted, though it is considered to be of poor quality due to its mushy texture.

The genus Isurus consists of two species, the shortfin mako Isurus oxyrinchus Rafinesque, 1810 and the <b>longfin</b> <b>mako</b> Isurus paucus Guitart, 1966 (Compagno, 2001). The latter is a pelagic, oceanic, probably circumtropical shark, reaching a maximum size of 417 cm total length (Compagno, 1984, 2001). This species is apparently common in the western Atlantic where it was described {{for the first time}} (Garrick, 1967; Dodrill & Gilmore, 1979). The capture of a large female south of Panama City, FL reported by Killam & Parsons (1986), extended this species known distribution into the Gulf of Mexico. Later, Moreno & Morón (1992) confirmed the presence of <b>longfin</b> <b>mako</b> sharks in waters off the north-west African coast and recorded them for the first time off the Iberian Penin-sula coast.

40|$|The shark genus Isurus is {{cosmopolitan}} {{and represented}} by two species: the shortfin mako Isurus oxyrinchus and the <b>longfin</b> <b>mako</b> lsurus paucus. Besides a few cetaceans (Visser et al., 2000) and man, the adult mako shark is not prey to any marine animal, but {{is considered an}} apex predator {{at the top of}} the marine environment food web. Shortfin and <b>longfin</b> <b>mako</b> sharks are often captured incidentally in various pelagic fisheries throughout the world and may be vulnerable to overfishing (Baum et al., 2003; ICCA T, 2004). Researchers have documented such declines and many shark populations in general at various geographical locations are believed to be at critical population levels or may have already collapsed (Baum et al., 2003; Baum and Myers, 2004; Baum and Myers, 2005) due to direct or indirect fishing activities (Martin, 2005). Sharks are long lived, slow growing, reach sexual maturity late in their life history, and produce few offspring; thus, overall population growth is slower and sharks have a lower growth rate than most teleosts (Musick, 1999). According to the JUCN World Conservation Union 2 ̆ 7 s Red List of Threatened and Endangered Species, the shortfin mako shark was assessed and listed under the category Lower Risk (Near Threatened (NT)) in 2002. Taxa under this category do not qualify for Conservation Dependent status, but are close to qualifying under the Vulnerable category. In 2005, the longfin make shark was assessed and listed in the Vulnerable category under the same Red List of Threatened and Endangered Species. More recently, the Committee on the Status of the Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) drafted an assessment and population status for the shortfin mako shark (COSEWIC, 2006). Based on the review, the committee decided to list the species as Threatened under the criteria A 2 b. According to the COSEWIC definitions, Threatened is defined as a species likely to become endangered if limiting factors are not reversed. Presently, little to no information is available for the <b>longfin</b> <b>mako</b> shark and limited information is available for the shortfin mako shark. Although COSEWIC (2006), ICCA T (2004), and IUCN (2002) have conducted status reviews on the shortfin mako shark, this report provides the first and only complete comprehensive review that has used all available information on the shortfin and <b>longfin</b> <b>mako</b> shark. This comprehensive review was primarily based on published literature obtained by using the Nova Southeastern University library online database search system and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Pelagic Observer Program (POP) database. The shortfin mako shark is an apex predator that has some special evolutionary traits unlike any other shark species. There are only five species classified in the Lamnidae family (shortfin mako, <b>longfin</b> <b>mako,</b> porbeagle, salmon, and white shark). Review of molecular genetics studies revealed that only one species of the shortfin mako shark exist worldwide (Heist et al., 1996). Distinct from most sharks, the shortfin mako shark has the ability to regulate its internal body temperature and closely resembles the physiology of some tunas. Distribution information has revealed the shortfin and <b>longfin</b> <b>mako</b> shark are highly migratory species found in every major ocean. Both species are captured in commercial fisheries (pelagic longlines and gillnets) worldwide and abundance trends show that the shortfin mako shark has declined over the last 30 years. The shortfin mako shark is captured in great numbers and ranks as one of the most dominant species caught in pelagic longlines and gillnets. The <b>longfin</b> <b>mako,</b> although also caught in similar fishing gears, is rare in catch composition data. Today, worldwide size composition data shows that male shortfin mako sharks are being caught at or below the size at maturity and below the female shortfin mako shark size at maturity. Moreover, size composition information shows that commercial fisheries are exploiting virtually the species entire size range (60 - 340 em FL). Recent age and growth information studies indicate that the shortfin mako shark is one of the slowest growing and longest lived extant shark species. Reproduction information suggests that the shortfin mako shark has one of the longest gestation periods and reproductive cycles within the elasmobranchs, More importantly, intrauterine cannibalism has recently been documented in the shortfin mako shark, which has only been previously reported in the sand tiger shark Carcharius taurus. Unlike most shark species, the shortfin mako shark is economically important for both its quality of meat and fins. Even though the species is physiologically unique, economically important, and exploited in significant relatively large numbers, this review has revealed that there are limited specific regulations and management plans currently in place, and recovery plans for the shortfin mako shark are lacking. Based on the results of this review, it is highly recommended that further research in age specific population dynamics, fishery yield models, and specific domestic and international management measures be implemented for the conservation and sustainability of the longfin and shortfin mako sharks...|$|E
40|$|An {{ecological}} {{risk assessment}} (ERA; {{also known as}} productivity and susceptibility analysis, PSA) was conducted on eleven species of pelagic elasmobranchs (10 sharks and 1 ray) to assess their vulnerability to pelagic longline fisheries in the Atlantic Ocean. This was a level- 3 quantitative assessment consisting of a risk analysis to evaluate the biological productivity of these species and a susceptibility analysis to assess their propensity to capture and mortality in pelagic longline fisheries. The risk analysis estimated productivity (intrinsic rate of increase, r) using a stochastic Leslie matrix approach that incorporated uncertainty in age at maturity, lifespan, age-specific natural mortality and fecundity. Susceptibility to the fishery was calculated {{as the product of}} four components, which were also calculated quantitatively: availability of the species to the fleet, encounterability of the gear given the species vertical distribution, gear selectivity and post-capture mortality. Information from observer programs by several ICCAT nations was used to derive fleet-specific susceptibility values. Results indicated that most species of pelagic sharks have low productivities and varying levels of susceptibility to pelagic longline gear. A number of species were grouped near the high-risk area of the productivity-susceptibility plot, particularly the silky (Carcharhinus falciformis), shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus), and bigeye thresher (Alopias superciliosus) sharks. Other species, such as the oceanic whitetip (Carcharhinus longimanus) and <b>longfin</b> <b>mako</b> (Isurus paucus) sharks, are also highly vulnerable. The blue shark (Prionace glauca) has intermediate vulnerability, whereas the smooth hammerhead (Sphyrna zygaena), scalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini), and porbeagle (Lamna nasus) sharks are less vulnerable, and the pelagic stingray (Pteroplatytrygon violacea) and common thresher (Alopias vulpinus) sharks have the lowest vulnerabilities. As a group, pelagic sharks are particularly vulnerable to pelagic longline fisheries mostly {{as a result of their}} limited productivity. ...|$|E
