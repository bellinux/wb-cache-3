5|$|Madonna also {{performed}} {{an excerpt of}} the song at the Super Bowl XLVI halftime show in 2012, where she was joined by Cee Lo Green and by a large marching band. The same year, the song was included on The MDNA Tour. Following an 8-minute monologue against intolerance, the song was reinvented and performed in a Basque, folk acoustic version, relying only on drums, which were played by the Basque band Kalakan, and Madonna's vocal harmony. Madonna's outfit during the performance consisted of an all-leather <b>look,</b> <b>a</b> custom design by Hervé Léger and Max Azria, with knee-high boots and a mini fur bolero, while her dancers were dressed as soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Never 7 is {{a visual}} novel {{in which the}} player reads the story, and presses a button to advance through the text. At certain points, the player gets to make choices which affect the {{direction}} the plot proceeds in; these involve choosing what location to move to, and what the player character should say, as well as subtler choices such as whether to <b>look</b> <b>a</b> girl in the eyes or to take her hand. The game is presented from a first-person perspective, with pre-rendered backgrounds and 2D character portraits accompanying the text. The visuals mostly consist of still images, but with characters often changing their expression while talking.|$|E
5|$|The male {{actors were}} asked to grow their hair and moustaches. The actors also had to diet to lose weight to achieve the look of World War II characters. The costumes had a faded <b>look,</b> <b>a</b> {{reflection}} that people of the period owned few clothes, often only two outfits. None of the actors knew the script in advance and were only informed each night before {{of what they were}} to do in their daily scenes. The Romani were not aware of the historic events that were the basis of the movie, and were only told that the story was set in hard times comparable to Ceaușescu's tenure in Romania. In the scene where the Romani revolt against the police over the death of Taloche, they were made aware of the character's death only when the scene was being shot, leading to a genuine outpouring of emotions, making their fight with the police appear more real. Gatlif later remarked in an interview that this scene stands for the actual revolt by the Romani in Auschwitz on May 16, 1944.|$|E

25|$|In the {{controversial}} matter of interpreting prophecy {{such as that}} in the Book of Daniel, Calvin proposed a preterist view, {{which is to say}} that he believed that the prophecies in the book of Daniel apply only to the history between prophet Daniel (530 BC) and Jesus' first coming (30 AD). In this view he was out of line with the early church and the Reformers who came before him, who maintained more fully to historical-continuous view.

25|$|In 2016, psychologists {{confirmed}} {{the relationship between}} social media usage and body image anxieties, dieting, and the goal towards thinness. Based on a survey, 56% of women acknowledged {{the effect of the}} “social media culture in driving the pressure for perfection and negative body image”; whereby it forces them to <b>look</b> <b>a</b> certain way. These platforms further reiterate the need for individuals to compare themselves with others online, resulting in higher expectations towards their standards of beauty. Hence, 42% of women stated social media caused them to feel worse about their bodies, while another study by the University of South Australia, discovered that individuals who frequently uploaded or viewed appearance-related items were more likely to internalise the thin ideal.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1920s, steps {{have been}} taken to {{preserve}} the historic center’s charm. The first set of protections was put into place by the INAH when it was declared a national monument. This required that all restorations and new construction conform to the area's colonial architecture. To preserve the city’s trademark colonial <b>look,</b> <b>a</b> civil society regulates the renovation and maintenance of the city, especially its historic center. This includes aspects such as traffic, garden spaces and even the kinds of social events that may be held. The town has also put much effort into preserving the cobblestone streets. The most recent designation is that of a World Heritage site, along with the religious sanctuary in nearby Atotonilco, which also puts restrictions and protections into place.|$|E

25|$|As a tropospheric cloud matures, {{the dense}} water {{droplets}} may combine to produce larger droplets. If the droplets become too large and heavy {{to be kept}} aloft by the air circulation, they will fall from the cloud as rain. By this process of accumulation, the space between droplets becomes increasingly larger, permitting light to penetrate farther into the cloud. If the cloud is sufficiently large and the droplets within are spaced far enough apart, {{a percentage of the}} light that enters the cloud is not reflected back out but is absorbed giving the cloud a darker <b>look.</b> <b>A</b> simple example of this is one's being able to see farther in heavy rain than in heavy fog. This process of reflection/absorption is what causes the range of cloud color from white to black.|$|E
25|$|The next globe {{design was}} {{introduced}} on 18 April 1966, nicknamed the 'Watchstrap' it featured a smaller globe in {{the centre of}} screen with three stripes of grey and white running {{to the left and}} right, on a black background. It was also the first ident to use the name 'BBC1', using the slanted logo in white. The watchstrap globe also featured a clock, with the same design as the globe but with the clock in place of the globe. Alongside the <b>look,</b> <b>a</b> slide was used to introduce newsflashes, and featured a thick stripe, white on the left hand side and grey on the right, on a black background with a large angled '1' above the grey section and filling most of the screen. The strip held the slanted 'BBC TV' logo, with the BBC logo in the white section and the grey section containing the 'TV' logo.|$|E
25|$|Muskox Ovibos moschatus (umingmar, maskar in Nunivak Cup'ig). Alaska's {{original}} muskox were hunted {{to extinction}} in the mid-1800s - perhaps by whalers and others. They had originally ranged Alaska's arctic and western coastal tundra. In 1935-1936 the U.S. Biological Survey brought 31 muskoxen from Greenland to Nunivak Island {{in an effort}} to reestablish the species in Alaska and as a means for subsistence living. Because the animals were federally protected, and since the Nunivaarmiut were afraid of them, they added nothing to the local economy until 40 years later. when Nunivak women learned to make fine items of clothing from the underwool of the muskox (qiviut). The muskox are large animals that <b>look</b> <b>a</b> lot like bison, but have wool like sheep, and has a two-layered coat, and qiviut refers specifically to the soft underwool beneath the longer outer wool. The first modern hunting season was in 1975. Today the Nunivak herd numbers around 600 animals, down from a high of around 700 animals in 1968.|$|E

25|$|Eruca was {{the first}} {{character}} Konishi designed, and proved problematic as he had trouble deciding what type of clothing she would wear. She was intended to have long hair typical of princess characters, but was eventually given short hair based on hardware restrictions and the wish to convey a unique <b>look.</b> <b>A</b> different change was Stocke's initial supporting characters Raynie and Marco. Stocke was originally going {{to be accompanied by}} two expendable generic units, but as Hirata saw this would negatively impact the player experience, the new characters were added; they were designed to be contrasting personalities who would liven up the party during the opening segments. The character Roche went through multiple redesigns during development, while Gafka was intended to leave an impression on players. The Beastkind designs reflected their in-world status as people of the forest. Several early Beastkind concepts were combined into those seen in the final game.|$|E
25|$|On the January 30, 2012 {{episode of}} Raw, The Undertaker {{returned}} after a ten-month hiatus to confront Triple H. On the February 13 episode of Raw, Triple H refused The Undertaker's challenge for a WrestleMania rematch. After The Undertaker accused Triple H {{of living in}} the shadow of Shawn Michaels on the February 20 episode of Raw, Triple H accepted the challenge on the condition {{that it would be a}} Hell in a Cell match; Michaels was later inserted as special referee in the match. At WrestleMania XXVIII, The Undertaker, while debuting his new <b>look,</b> <b>a</b> mohawk, defeated Triple H to extend his streak to 20–0. After the match, Undertaker and Michaels carried Triple H to the entrance stage, where the three embraced. Later in 2012, The Undertaker appeared on the 1000th episode of Raw on July 23 to help Kane, who had been confronted by Jinder Mahal, Curt Hawkins, Tyler Reks, Hunico, Camacho, and Drew McIntyre. The Brothers of Destruction overcame and dominated the six other wrestlers.|$|E
25|$|Sadamasa Arikawa (who {{worked with}} Eiji Tsuburaya) {{said that the}} sculptors {{had a hard time}} coming up with a King Kong suit that appeased Tsuburaya. The first suit was {{rejected}} for being too fat with long legs giving Kong an almost cute <b>look.</b> <b>A</b> few other designs were done before Tsuburaya would approve the final look that was ultimately used in the film. The suit was given two separate masks and two separate pairs of arms. Long arm extensions which contained poles inside the arms for Hirose to grab onto and with static immovable hands was used for long shots of Kong, while short human length arms were added to the suit for scenes that required Kong to grab items and wrestle with Godzilla. Besides the suit with the two separate arm attachments, a meter high model and a puppet of Kong (used for closeups) were also built. As well, a huge prop of Kong's hand was built for the scene where he grabs Mie Hama (Fumiko) and carries her off.|$|E

25|$|The Indian {{team had}} played six {{first-class}} matches {{prior to this}} match, {{and they had a}} below-par win-loss ratio of one win and two losses, both being innings defeats. Australia, though, had a remarkable record in their last ten test series, winning eight of them, and three out of a total three series after the war. Their win-loss record was exemplary as well, winning 29 and losing only 7, out of 45 tests. However, the Indian team had reason to believe that they could punch above their weight, as they had unearthed in Vinoo Mankad, a talented all-rounder, who had taken 39 wickets in those six matches, and had also scored 516 runs from 11 innings at an average of 46.90, and their captain Lala Amarnath's good run with the bat and the emergence of a future batting stalwart for India, Vijay Hazare, made India's prospects <b>look</b> <b>a</b> little brighter. However, Australia's captain, Don Bradman was a major stumbling block in India's path. At the start of the series his record was: 42 test matches, 5773 runs, Average of 97.84. Worryingly, for the touring side, He had already scored heavily against the Indian attack for the Australian XI outfit against India, an imposing 172. So his presence meant definite trouble for Lala Amarnath's side.|$|E
25|$|The network also {{produces}} short segments promoting new movies {{with the cooperation}} of the film studios that hold releasing rights to the projects. These usually consist of either interstitial segments providing a behind-the-scenes look at the making of an upcoming/recently released film, with interviews with the actors and principal crew, or red carpet coverage, which are almost universally produced by studios with which HBO and Cinemax maintain exclusive premium television broadcast rights. Depending on their length or content, these are either aired as part of the feature segment HBO News (formerly titled HBO Entertainment News from 1988 to 2007), which airs during extended promotional breaks between programs and runs between three and five minutes, or as part of HBO First <b>Look,</b> <b>a</b> series of documentary-style interstitial specials (usually running 15 to 20 minutes in length, with no set schedule) that debuted in 1992. These segments, particularly episodes of First Look, have also often been included as bonus features on DVD and Blu-ray releases of the films that were profiled (many of which have aired on HBO and Cinemax once they reached their pay-cable distribution windows), though broadcasts of these interstitials have begun to be reduced to only a few episodes per year as HBO has focused on its higher-profile, long-form original programming instead and studios have internally produced behind-the-scenes featurettes for their films for exclusive physical and digital media release.|$|E
25|$|After Towton, Warwick goes to France {{to secure}} for Edward {{the hand of}} Louis XI's sister-in-law, Lady Bona, thus {{ensuring}} peace {{between the two nations}} by uniting in marriage their two monarchies. Warwick arrives at the French court to find that Margaret, Prince Edward and the Earl of Oxford have come to Louis to seek his aid in the conflict in England. Just as Louis is about to agree to supply Margaret with troops, Warwick intervenes, and convinces Louis that it is in his interests to support Edward and approve the marriage. Back in England, however, the recently widowed Lady Grey (Elizabeth Woodville) has come to King Edward requesting her late husband's lands be returned to her. Edward is captivated by her beauty and promises to return her husband's lands to her if she become his mistress, but Lady Grey refuses. The two banter and Edward decides that, besides being beautiful, she is also clever and virtuous, and decides to marry her against the advice of both George and Richard. Upon hearing of this, feeling he has been made to <b>look</b> <b>a</b> fool despite service to the House of York, Warwick denounces Edward, and switches allegiance to the Lancastrians, promising his daughter Anne's hand in marriage to Prince Edward as a sign of his loyalty. Shortly thereafter, George and Montague also defect to the Lancastrians. Warwick then invades England with French troops, and Edward is taken prisoner while a heavily pregnant Lady Grey (now Queen Elizabeth) flees to sanctuary. Henry is restored to the throne, and appoints Warwick and George as his Lords Protector.|$|E
