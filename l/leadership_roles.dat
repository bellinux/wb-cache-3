A composite Reliability value for benevolent <b>leadership</b> <b>role</b> perspective (0.8) was more than 0.7, which shows high reliability. The Composite Reliability of benevolent authoritative <b>leadership</b> <b>role</b> perspective (0.62) show that reliability is less compared to the standard. The Average variance Extracted (AVE) for the construct named benevolent <b>leadership</b> <b>role</b> perspective (0.56) and benevolent authoritative <b>leadership</b> <b>role</b> perspective (0.69) were more than 0.5 (Fornell and Larcker, 1981), which explain the convergent validity. The CR value higher than AVE for benevolent <b>leadership</b> <b>role</b> perspective (0.56) shows the convergent validity. The less CR value compared to AVE for benevolent authoritative <b>leadership</b> <b>role</b> perspective shows that the convergent validity is less in this case.|$|R

5|$|ACLU {{leadership}} was split {{on whether to}} purge its leadership of communists. Norman Thomas, John Haynes Holmes, and Morris Ernst were anti-communists who wanted to distance the ACLU from communism; opposing them were Harry Ward, Corliss Lamont and Elizabeth Flynn who rejected any political test for ACLU leadership. A bitter struggle ensued throughout 1939, and the anti-communists prevailed in February 1940, when the board voted to prohibit anyone who supported totalitarianism from ACLU <b>leadership</b> <b>roles.</b> Chairman Harry Ward immediately resigned, andfollowing a contentious six-hour debateElizabeth Flynn was voted off the ACLU's board. The 1940 resolution was {{considered by many to}} be a betrayal of its fundamental principles. The resolution was rescinded in 1968, and Flynn was posthumously reinstated to the ACLU in 1970.|$|E
40|$|The {{genetic and}} {{developmental}} influences on <b>leadership</b> <b>role</b> occupancy were investigated using {{a sample of}} 178 fraternal and 214 identical female twins. Two general developmental factors were identified, one involving formal work experiences {{and the other a}} family experiences factor hypothesized to influence whether women move into positions of leadership in organizations. Results indicated that 32 % of the variance in <b>leadership</b> <b>role</b> occupancy was associated with heritability. The 2 developmental factors also showed significant correlations with <b>leadership</b> <b>role</b> occupancy. However, after genetic factors were partialed out, only the work experience factor was significantly related to <b>leadership</b> <b>role</b> occupancy.

40|$|<b>Leadership</b> <b>role</b> {{occupancy}} {{has recently}} {{been shown to have}} a genetic basis. We extend prior research by examining the moderating effects of the social environment during adolescence on the genetic influences on <b>leadership</b> <b>role</b> occupancy at work. Utilizing a sample of male twins (89 pairs of identical and 54 pairs of fraternal twins, {{with a mean age of}} 36. 5 Â years), we found that genetic influences are weaker for those reared in enriched environments (i. e., higher family socioeconomic status, higher perceived parental support, and lower perceived conflict with parents). For those twins who had relatively poorer social environments, genetic influences on <b>leadership</b> <b>role</b> occupancy are significantly greater. These results have important implications for early interventions on leadership development inside and outside organizations. <b>Leadership</b> <b>role</b> occupancy Nature versus nurture Gene-environment interaction (G × E) ...|$|R
5|$|After his graduation, Wai {{enlisted in}} the Hawaii National Guard and was called into active duty before the United States' {{entrance}} into World War II. He received a commission as an officer and completed Officer Candidate School in 1941. His commission was rare {{at a time when}} few Asian Americans were allowed to serve in combat <b>leadership</b> <b>roles.</b> He was eventually assigned to the 34th Infantry Regiment of the 24th Infantry Division with the rank of Captain. The 24th Division, based at Schofield Barracks, Oahu, was among the first American units {{to be involved in the}} Pacific Theater, exchanging fire with Japanese aircraft during the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Parkinson {{was made}} {{commander}} of the Royal New Zealand Artillery, having been made a temporary lieutenant colonel. He was demoted to major the following year; this reduction in rank was {{as a result of}} disciplinary action after using the workshop facilities at Trentham Military Camp for personal work. In 1939, he was returned to his temporary rank of lieutenant colonel. A lot of his work as {{commander of the}} artillery involved the implementing programs for the upskilling of gunners and non-commissioned officers to perform <b>leadership</b> <b>roles</b> normally the preserve of officers.

5|$|Ramboasalamarazaka {{spent his}} early {{childhood}} in his father's Zafimamy court at Ikaloy. There {{he received a}} traditional education, including mastery of fanorona, a local board game believed to develop intelligence {{and the ability to}} think strategically. Young nobles being groomed for <b>leadership</b> <b>roles</b> typically learned to perform kabary (a stylized form of public address), including the judicious use of ohabolana (proverbs) to persuasively make a point. Young Merina princes also often learned to play the valiha, a bamboo tube zither then reserved for Merina and Zafimamy nobles. Around the age of 12, Ramboasalamarazaka continued his education under the supervision of his grandfather, King Andriambelomasina, at Amboatany and the royal court in Ambohimanga.|$|E

5|$|The Yugoslav coup d'état {{occurred}} on 27 March 1941 in Belgrade, Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The coup was planned and {{conducted by a}} group of pro-Western Serb-nationalist Royal Yugoslav Air Force officers formally led by its commander, General Dušan Simović, who had been associated with a number of coup plots from 1938 onwards. For practical purposes Brigadier General of Military Aviation Borivoje Mirković, Major Živan Knežević of the Yugoslav Royal Guards, and his brother Radoje Knežević all performed <b>leadership</b> <b>roles</b> in the conduct of the coup. In addition to Radoje Knežević, some other civilian leaders were probably aware of the coup before it was launched and moved to support it once it occurred, but they were not among the organisers.|$|E
5|$|The {{leadership}} of the ACLU does not always agree on policy decisions; differences of opinion within the ACLU leadership have sometimes grown into major debates. In 1937, an internal debate erupted over whether to defend Henry Ford's right to distribute anti-union literature. In 1939, a heated debate took place over whether to prohibit communists from serving in ACLU <b>leadership</b> <b>roles.</b> During the early 1950s and Cold War McCarthyism, the board was divided on whether to defend communists. In 1968, a schism formed over whether to represent Dr. Benjamin Spock's anti-war activism. In 1973, there was internal conflict over whether to call for the impeachment of Richard Nixon. In 2005, there was internal conflict {{about whether or not}} a gag rule should be imposed on ACLU employees to prevent publication of internal disputes.|$|E
5|$|Baden-Powell {{could not}} single-handedly advise all groups who {{requested}} his assistance. Early Scoutmaster training camps {{were held in}} London and Yorkshire in 1910 and 1911. Baden-Powell wanted the training to be as practical as possible to encourage other adults to take <b>leadership</b> <b>roles,</b> so the Wood Badge course was developed to recognize adult leadership training. The development of the training was delayed by World War I, so the first Wood Badge course was not held until 1919. Wood Badge is used by Boy Scout associations and combined Boy Scout and Girl Guide associations in many countries. Gilwell Park near London was purchased in 1919 on behalf of The Scout Association as an adult training site and Scouting campsite. Baden-Powell wrote a book, Aids to Scoutmastership, to help Scouting Leaders, and wrote other handbooks {{for the use of}} the new Scouting sections, such as Cub Scouts and Girl Guides. One of these was Rovering to Success, written for Rover Scouts in 1922. A wide range of leader training exists in 2007, from basic to program-specific, including the Wood Badge training.|$|E

5|$|During {{this period}} the {{struggle}} against colonial rule intensified. Nationalism became the pre-eminent cause. Claiming Indian superiority became the tool of cultural revivalism resulting in an essentialising model of Indian womanhood {{similar to that of}} Victorian womanhood: special yet separated from public space. Gandhi legitimised and expanded Indian women's public activities by initiating them into the non-violent civil disobedience movement against the British Raj. He exalted their feminine roles of caring, self-abnegation, sacrifice and tolerance; and carved a niche for those in the public arena. Peasant women {{played an important role in}} the rural satyagrahas of Borsad and Bardoli. Women-only organisations like All India Women's Conference (AIWC) and the National Federation of Indian Women (NFIW) emerged. Women were grappling with issues relating to the scope of women's political participation, women's franchise, communal awards, and <b>leadership</b> <b>roles</b> in political parties.|$|E
5|$|The {{occupation}} of Czechoslovakia by Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany in March 1939 convinced Huggins that war was imminent. Seeking to renew his government's mandate to pass emergency measures, he called an early election {{in which his}} United Party won an increased majority. Huggins rearranged his Cabinet on a war footing, making the Minister of Justice Robert Tredgold Minister of Defence as well. The territory proposed forces not only for internal security {{but also for the}} defence of British interests overseas. Self-contained Rhodesian formations were planned, including a mechanised reconnaissance unit, but Tredgold opposed this. Remembering the catastrophic casualties suffered by units such as the Newfoundland Regiment and the South African Brigade on the Western Front in World War I, he argued that one or two heavy defeats for a white Southern Rhodesian brigade might cause crippling losses and have irrevocable effects on the country as a whole. He proposed to instead concentrate on training white Rhodesians for <b>leadership</b> <b>roles</b> and specialist units, and to disperse the colony's men across the forces in small groups. These ideas met with approval in both Salisbury and London and were adopted.|$|E
5|$|White middle-class Indiana women learned {{organizational}} skills through the suffrage and temperance movements. By the 1890s they were applying their new {{skills to the}} needs of their home communities, by organizing women's clubs, the combined literary activity with social activism focused on such needs as public health, sanitation, and good schools. Hoosier women worked at both {{the state and local level}} to materialize Progressive Era reforms. In Lafayette, for example, the suffragists concentrated in the Lafayette Franchise League, while those oriented toward social concerns worked through the Lafayette Charity Organization Society (LCOS), the Free Kindergarten and Industrial School Association (FKISA), and the Martha Home. Albion Fellows Bacon led statewide and national efforts at housing reform. A native of Evansville, Bacon worked to pass tenement and housing legislation in Indiana in 1909, 1913, and 1917. She also held <b>leadership</b> <b>roles</b> in Indiana Child Welfare Association; the Child Welfare Committee, a part of the Women's Section of the Indiana State Council of Defense; the Indiana Conference of Charities and Corrections, and the Juvenile Advisory Commission of Indiana's Probation Department. Women in Indiana would officially gain the right to vote in 1920 when the 19th Amendment is ratified for the United States constitution.|$|E
