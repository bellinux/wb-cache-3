5|$|On January 25, 2011, Stelmach {{announced}} that he would not seek re-election; he also promised a leadership race before the next election. He did not specify his date of resignation at that time, however he submitted his <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>resignation</b> in June, writing that he would leave office on October 1. In the early hours of October 2, 2011, Alison Redford was declared the new leader of the party, and Stelmach resigned as premier on October 7.|$|E
5|$|When he had {{resigned}} as governor in 1785, Hancock was again elected as a {{delegate to the}} Continental Congress, known as the Confederation Congress after the ratification of the Articles of Confederation in 1781. Congress had declined in importance after the Revolutionary War, and was frequently ignored by the states. Congress elected Hancock to serve as its president, but he never attended because of his poor health {{and because he was}} not interested. He sent Congress a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>resignation</b> in 1786.|$|E
5|$|Benedict Arnold {{continued}} on to Philadelphia, {{where he met}} with members of Congress about his rank. His action at Ridgefield, coupled {{with the death of}} Wooster due to wounds sustained in the action, resulted in Arnold's promotion to major general, although his seniority was not restored over those who had been promoted before him. Amid negotiations over that issue, Arnold wrote out a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>resignation</b> on July 11, the same day that word arrived in Philadelphia, that Fort Ticonderoga had fallen to the British. Washington refused his resignation and ordered him north to assist with the defense there.|$|E

25|$|Compounding the {{problems}} the studio was facing {{was the fact}} that the studio's co-founders, brothers Max Fleischer and Dave Fleischer, were becoming increasingly estranged, and by this time were no longer speaking to each other due to personal and professional disputes. On May 25, 1941, Paramount assumed full ownership of Fleischer Studios, and had the Fleischer brothers submit signed <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>resignation,</b> to be used at Paramount's discretion. Following the unsuccessful release of Mr. Bug in December 1941, Max Fleischer, no longer able to cooperate with Dave, sent Paramount a telegram expressing such. Paramount responded by producing the <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>resignation,</b> severing the Fleischer brothers from control of their studio.|$|R
50|$|In May 2006 the Commission {{spoke out}} against the Human Resource Development Ministry's plans to {{increase}} quotas for backward castes in {{institutions such as the}} IITs. Following Arjun Singh's subsequent remarks on their credentials, two of the members, Andre Beteille and Dr Pratap Bhanu Mehta, sent <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>resignation</b> to the Prime Minister.|$|R
5|$|Concurrent {{with these}} events, Mary Margaret (Goodwin) {{continues}} {{to visit the}} amnesiac David (Joshua Dallas) at the hospital. At the same time, Kathryn (Anastasia Griffith) also continues to visit David, showing him pictures to jog his memory but later admits, although he claimed otherwise to Kathryn, to Mary Margaret that he doesn't remember anything that {{he saw in the}} pictures. As Mary Margaret notices David becoming more attracted to her, she still feels threatened by Kathryn's presence. This prompts Mary Margaret to submit her <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>resignation</b> as a volunteer at the hospital.|$|E
5|$|Despite failing health, Mansfield {{refused to}} officially leave his post as Lord Chief Justice because George III {{was opposed to}} the {{appointment}} of Mansfield's protégé Francis Buller to the position after Mansfield resigned. The government of the time instead suggested Lloyd Kenyon as a possible successor. Mansfield clung to office until 1788, (despite not sitting in court for two years) {{in the hope that}} the government would fall before he was forced to retire. This was not to be, and on 3 June, he wrote a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>resignation</b> effective the next day.|$|E
5|$|In the 1976–77 {{season the}} Flyers' win total slipped from 51 to 48, {{but they still}} managed a 0.700 winning percentage. This marked the fourth {{consecutive}} year of having a 0.700 or better win percentage – once again winning their division and finishing first in the Campbell Conference. In the post season the Flyers again reached the semi-finals, but lost to the Bruins in four straight games. The following season the Flyers' record fell to 45–20–15 finishing second to the Islanders in both the division and the Conference. Shero again led the Flyers to the semi-finals, where they lost to the Bruins once more. At {{the end of the}} season Shero, who had one more year left on his contract, submitted a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>resignation</b> stating that the Flyers needed a change whether they realized it or not. Flyers management had previously heard rumors about Shero wanting to leave Philadelphia and re-join the Rangers organization, and refused to accept his <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>resignation.</b> Shero then signed a $250,000, five-year contract with the Rangers to be their new Head Coach and General Manager, believing he no longer had a contractual agreement to the Flyers. A few weeks after signing Shero, the Rangers gave the Flyers their first-round pick in the 1978 draft (Ken Linseman) and cash as compensation, allowing the Rangers to avoid tampering charges.|$|E
25|$|Mannerheim {{supported}} Finland's military {{industry and}} sought {{in vain to}} establish a military defence union with Sweden. However, rearming the Finnish army did not occur as swiftly or {{as well as he}} hoped, and he was not enthusiastic about a war. He had many disagreements with various Cabinets, and signed many <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>resignation.</b>|$|R
5000|$|He {{went on to}} ask for <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>resignation</b> {{from all}} <b>of</b> his top staff members and state-agency commissioners.

5|$|On December 17, 1851, Henry Clay {{submitted}} a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>resignation</b> {{of his seat}} in the U.S. Senate, to be effective September 1 of the following year (1852). Clay's announcement came while the Kentucky General Assembly was in session. This was intentional. The majority of the Assembly was Whig, and Clay {{knew that if he}} resigned while the Assembly was in session, the majority would elect a Whig to be his successor. By contrast, if he had waited until September 1 to announce his resignation the Assembly would already have closed its session, and Governor Powell, a Democrat, would appoint a temporary successor until the legislature convened again two years later.|$|E
5|$|When {{a patient}} {{unexpectedly}} dies in his care, Oliver breaks down. He confesses to Penny that he cheated {{in medical school}} by swapping one of their exam papers, so he passed on her merit while {{she was forced to}} repeat a year. Furious, Penny tells Oliver that he must confess to Director of Surgery Henrik Hanssen (Guy Henry). He writes a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>resignation,</b> but deletes it after a positive day working alongside Frieda, who encourages him to repeat his F2 year. After giving Oliver a final chance to confess, Penny is called away to the site of a train crash. Oliver is left alone on AAU, where he successfully performs a difficult procedure. Hopeful that Penny will forgive him, Oliver is devastated to learn that she has been killed in an accident at the crash site. Unable to cope in the aftermath of her death, Oliver turns to drugs and alcohol. He sends Hanssen a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>resignation,</b> which includes a full confession. His father Tony (Simon Shepherd) offers him money to choose a new career, and claims that Oliver always had more potential than Penny. This angers Oliver, who endangers his own life to save a patient and feels reinvigorated. Hanssen is impressed by Oliver's patient treatment, and overlooks his cheating to allow him a fresh start.|$|E
5|$|When Ross {{returned}} home, Houston {{asked him}} to disband the company and form a new company of 83 men, promising to send written directives soon. While Ross {{was in the process}} of supervising this reorganization, Houston appointed Captain William C. Dalrymple as his new aide-de-camp with overall command of the Texas Rangers. Dalrymple, unaware of Houston's verbal orders, castigated Ross for disbanding his company. Ross completed the reorganization of the company, then returned to Waco and resigned his commission. In his <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>resignation,</b> effective February 1861, Ross informed Houston of his encounter with Dalrymple, and noted he did not believe a Ranger company could be effective if the captain did not report solely to the Governor. Houston offered to appoint Ross as an aide-de-camp with the rank of colonel, but Ross refused.|$|E
50|$|Following a {{standoff}} between protesters and government forces in Kiev on 23 January, tensions flared as anti-government forces mobilized and overtook the Regional State Administration (RSA) {{of a number}} of western Ukrainian cities, with some local governors being forced to file <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>resignation.</b> By the afternoon, the administrations of Lviv, Rivne and Ternopil, and Khmelnytskyi were also in the hands of anti-government protesters.|$|R
5000|$|A {{scientist}} {{who founded the}} Jetters. He has an annoying tendency to blow his nose on any piece of paper nearby, including <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>resignation,</b> leading, understandably, to much confusion. He has a crush on Grandma Bomber (White Bomber and Mighty's grandmother), and calls her [...] "Momo-chan", which makes her angry. Often regarded as a joke character, {{he also has a}} serious side. Ein tells the Jetters when there are missions.|$|R
5000|$|Due to the {{involvement}} of the Mission in supporting the Shogun, Chanoine had to leave Japan with the majority of the other French advisors in October 1868, per orders of the new emperor Meiji. Those who chose to remain, led by Jules Brunet, sent <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>resignation</b> from the French army before joining the forces of the Shogun. This was done apparently with Chanoine's tacit agreement, as he covered up their departure for a period of several days.|$|R
5|$|On October 10, 1973, Agnew {{appeared}} before the federal court in Baltimore, and pled no contest to one felony charge, tax evasion, for the year 1967. Richardson agreed {{that there would be}} no further prosecution of Agnew, and released a 40-page summary of the evidence. Agnew was fined $10,000 and placed on three years' unsupervised probation. At the same time, he submitted a formal <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>resignation</b> to the Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, and sent a letter to Nixon stating he was resigning in the best interest of the nation. Nixon responded with a letter concurring that the resignation was necessary to avoid a lengthy period of division and uncertainty, and applauding Agnew for his patriotism and dedication to the welfare of the US. House Minority Leader Gerald Ford, who would be Agnew's successor as vice president (and Nixon's as president) recalled that he heard the news while on the House floor and his first reaction was disbelief, his second sadness.|$|E
5|$|Articles 87 through 89 of the Constitution {{deal with}} how the {{presidency}} can change hands in-between election cycles. The President {{has the ability to}} resign from office at any time under Article 87. The <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>resignation</b> is sent to the House of Representatives and is accepted by them. The President has the ability to be removed from office if his physical or mental health is impaired under Article 88. In order for this to happen, a two-thirds majority must be reached in the House of Representatives and the Council of the Republic on the resolution to remove the President. An ad hoc committee is formed and must make the determination about the state of health before any motion can begin. If the President has committed a grave crime, such as treason, one-third of the House must bring charges against the President formally. The investigation of the charges will be conducted by the Council of the Republic. In order to evict the President from office, a two-thirds majority is needed to vote in favor of conviction. The criminal case is further sent to the Supreme Court for review. The actions of either option must occur one month after the resolution is passed or the action will be considered void by the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev's {{consolidation}} {{to power}} weakened Kosygin's influence and prestige within the Politburo. By the 1970s, when Kosygin's position was given one blow after another, he was frequently hospitalised and at several occasions Kiril Mazurov, the First Deputy {{chairman of the}} Council of Ministers, acted on his behalf during Kosygin's absence. Kosygin suffered his first heart attack in 1976. After this incident, {{it is said that}} Kosygin changed from having a vibrant personality to being tired and fed up; he, according to people close to him, seemed to have lost the will to continue his work. He twice filed a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>resignation</b> between 1976 and 1980, but was turned down on both occasions. During Kosygin's sick leave, Brezhnev appointed Nikolai Tikhonov to the post of First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers. Tikhonov, as with Brezhnev, was a conservative, and through his post as First Deputy chairman Tikhonov was able to reduce Kosygin to a standby role. At a Central Committee plenum in June 1980, the Soviet economic development plan was outlined by Tikhonov, not Kosygin. The powers of the Premier diminished to the point where Kosygin was forced to discuss all decisions made by the Council of Ministers with Brezhnev.|$|E
50|$|Paramount was {{acutely aware}} of the {{problems}} between Max and Dave Fleischer and structured their contract for the completion of Mr. Bug in an unusual way, allowing for the <b>resignation</b> <b>of</b> either brother following its completion. When Paramount renewed the Fleischer contract on May 24, 1941, a clause stipulated that the brothers deliver signed <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>resignation</b> to Paramount to be used at the studio's discretion. Post-production concluded in Hollywood just before Thanksgiving, and Dave rendered his resignation one month before the scheduled release.|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{having been}} {{conceived}} as a Democratic Party bastion during the U.S. Civil War, in its later days, {{the members of the}} Manhattan Club were often decidedly Republican in sympathies. In 1954, a survey of the men's social clubs of Manhattan noted that the club had become [...] "ninety percent Republican." [...] A half-century earlier, the significant majority of members supported Republican William McKinley's bid for President of the United States, triggering <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>resignation</b> from members who wanted it to be a Democratic Club.|$|R

The Bishop-elect was born in Niessega, Burkina Faso in 1962 and ordained a priest in 1991. He succeeds Bishop Wenceslas Compaoré, whose resignation Pope Benedict accepted, upon having reached the age limit of 75, when all bishops must offer to submit their <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>resignation</b> to the Pope for possible acceptance.|$|R
5|$|Kirilenko {{was seen}} as a {{possible}} candidate for the post of First Deputy Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet in 1977, however, First World observers tended to overrate the significance of the office, and because of it, their observation were completely off the mark. Vasili Kuznetsov, a 76-year-old man, was chosen to the office of First Deputy Chairman instead. During Brezhnev's later rule, KGB chairman Yuri Andropov gradually took over the functions and, eventually, Kirilenko's position within the Soviet leadership. In 1979, Kirilenko lost his unofficial office as supervisor of the defence industry over to Pavel Finogenov, a protegé of Dmitriy Ustinov. Kirilenko {{was seen as}} a key candidate by the West to replace Brezhnev as Soviet leader in 1982. After Brezhnev's death, Kirilenko was removed from the ruling Politburo by the new General Secretary Andropov. With his deteriorating health, having a disease known as arteriosclerosis, Kirilenko was disabled from ensuing active politics or protecting himself from Andropov's attacks. After Brezhnev's death and funeral, Kirilenko's mental condition deteriorated to where he could not remember the names of several leading Politburo members. He was unable to write properly during his later life; when asked by Andropov to write a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>resignation</b> in 1982, he was unable to do so. The decision to remove Kirilenko was taken before Andropov rose to power, so in the event Brezhnev had died later, Kirilenko would still have been forced to resign. The reason for the decision was that Kirilenko's son had tried to defect to the United Kingdom.|$|E

Although it is by far the single largest party, with 18 representatives, in the 40-member Bahraini parliament, it has often been outvoted by coalition blocs of opposition Sunni parties and independent MPs reflecting gerrymandering of electoral districts.
