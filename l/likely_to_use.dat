In a later study of 34 lexical signs, Black signers {{were found to have}} 28 signs that White signers did not know. Older signers are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> variant signs than younger signers. Most of these signs, having been developed in segregated schools for the Black Deaf, refer to everyday life. Younger signers of BASL are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> these variants, but when asked about them are aware that older signers have and use these innovative signs.|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} prescribed and misused benzodiazepines in the United States. A large-scale nationwide U.S. government study conducted by SAMHSA found that, in the U.S., benzodiazepines are recreationally the most frequently used pharmaceuticals due to their widespread availability, accounting for 35% of all drug-related visits to hospital emergency and urgent care facilities. Men and women are equally <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> benzodiazepines recreationally. The report found that alprazolam is the most common benzodiazepine for recreational use, followed by clonazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam. The number of emergency room visits due to benzodiazepines increased by 36% between 2004 and 2006.|$|E
40|$|This study investigates {{complaining}} utterances {{which are}} used by {{both male and female}} customers and bank's staffs in expressing complaint. It is aimed to find the differences between male and female customers in expressing their unsatisfied feeling. Based on data elicited from 7 male and 7 female respondents by using discourse completion test. From the functions, it is noted that male customers are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>used</b> the function of 'expressing disappointment' while female customers are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>used</b> the function of 'reporting'. From the strategy, it is noted that male and female respondents are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>used</b> 'sympathetic advise/warning'. The theory which is used in this study is politeness strategies. There are three possible strategies to make a complaint. First strategy is keeping silent, second strategy is using on record without redressive action, third strategy is using on record with redressive action, including, positive politeness, and negative politenes...|$|R

5|$|Northern mockingbirds {{are famous}} for their song repertoires. Studies have shown that males sing songs at the {{beginning}} of breeding season to attract females. Unmated males sing songs in more directions and sing more bouts than mated males. In addition, unmated males perform more flight displays than mated males. The mockingbirds usually nest several times during one breeding season. Depending on the stage of breeding and the mating status, a male mockingbird will vary his song production. The unmated male keeps close track of this change. He sings in one direction when he perceives a chance to lure a female from the nest of the mated male. Unmated males are also more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> elevated perches to extend his songs to a further range. Though the mockingbirds are socially monogamous, mated males have been known to sing to attract additional mates.|$|E
5|$|There {{does not}} appear to be a {{difference}} in motivation for self-harm in adolescent males and females. For example, for both genders there is an incremental increase in deliberate self-harm associated with an increase in consumption of cigarettes, drugs and alcohol. Triggering factors such as low self-esteem and having friends and family members who self-harm are also common between both males and females. One limited study found that, among those young individuals who do self-harm, both genders are just as equally <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the method of skin-cutting. However, females who self-cut are more likely than males to explain their self-harm episode by saying that they had wanted to punish themselves. In New Zealand, more females are hospitalised for intentional self-harm than males. Females more commonly choose methods such as self-poisoning that generally are not fatal, but still serious enough to require hospitalisation.|$|E
5|$|The British were {{alerted to}} the 4thDestroyer Flotilla's {{movement}} by Ultra signals intelligence. The {{commander of the}} Home Fleet, Admiral Henry Moore, was informed that the destroyers had sailed on 27January, shortly after the three carriers and their escort had put to sea. He believed that the German ships were <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a route between the coastal islands and the shore, as was common for the Kriegsmarine. If this route was used, it would be preferable for strike aircraft of No. 18 Group RAF to attack the destroyers as Norway's inshore waters were protected by naval mines and coastal batteries. Alternatively, the German ships could make a high-speed night passage outside of the coastal islands. In case an offshore route was used, Moore ordered Vice Admiral Frederick Dalrymple-Hamilton, {{the commander of the}} 10thCruiser Squadron, to sail with the cruisers Diadem and Mauritius and patrol off Bergen. The Home Fleet did not have any destroyers available to accompany Dalrymple-Hamilton's force, though Moore considered but decided against cancelling the carrier operation in order to make some of these ships available.|$|E

5|$|When compared, Black signers {{were more}} likely than were White signers to produce signs outside of the typical signing space and to use two-handed signs.

Less marked forms, such as pronouns, determiners, plain verbs, and nouns, tend to be less likely to be {{produced}} outside the typical signing space. The selection of two-handed signs over one-handed signs was found to have systematic constraints on their production. When the sign could be produced with one or two hands, Black signers often produced the variant that matched the handedness of the following sign; if the following sign was two-handed, they {{were more likely}} to produce a two-handed variant, while if the following sign was one-handed, {{they were more likely to}} produce the one-handed variant. The use of innovative one-handed forms, though, even in environments which favored them, did not exceed 50 percent.|$|E
