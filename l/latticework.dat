The closed mantapa, well decorated inside and out, is larger than the vestibule connecting the shrine and the mantapa and has four lathe-turned pillars to support the ceiling, which may be deeply domed. The four pillars divide the hall into nine bays. The nine bays result in nine decorated ceilings. Pierced stone screens (Jali or <b>Latticework)</b> that serve as windows in the navaranga (hall) and Sabhamantapa (congregation hall) is a characteristic Hoysala stylistic element.|$|E

Rustin notices several stab wounds and ligature marks scattered about on the corpse, suspecting the victim to be {{the centerpiece of a}} ritual murder—the [...] "paraphiliac love map" [...] to the perpetrator's fantasy. Martin dismisses his suspicions, and suddenly invites Rustin to dinner at his wife Maggie's (Michelle Monaghan) insistence, much to Rustin's dismay as it is his deceased daughter's birthday. However, he reluctantly agrees to come, but infuriates Martin when he shows up intoxicated.|$|R
40|$|A current {{question}} in biofilm research is whether biofilm-specific genetic processes {{can lead to}} differentiation in physiology and function among biofilm cells. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, phenotypic variants which exhibit a small-colony phenotype on agar media and a markedly accelerated pattern of biofilm development {{compared to that of}} the parental strain are often isolated from biofilms. We grew P. aeruginosa biofilms in glass flow cell reactors and observed that the emergence of small-colony variants (SCVs) in the effluent runoff from the biofilms correlated with the emergence of plaque-forming Pf 1 -like filamentous phage (designated Pf 4) from the biofilm. Because several recent studies have shown that bacteriophage genes are among the most highly upregulated groups of genes during biofilm development, we investigated whether Pf 4 plays a role in SCV formation during P. aeruginosa biofilm development. We carried out immunoelectron microscopy using anti- Pf 4 antibodies and observed that SCV cells, but not parental-type cells, exhibited high densities of Pf 4 filaments on the cell surface and that these filaments were often tightly interwoven into complex <b>latticeworks</b> surrounding the cells. Moreover, infection of P. aeruginosa planktonic cultures with Pf 4 caused the emergence of SCVs within the culture. These SCVs exhibited enhanced attachment, accelerated biofilm development, and large regions of dead and lysed cells inside microcolonies in a manner identical to that of SCVs obtained from biofilms. We concluded that Pf 4 can mediate phenotypic variation in P. aeruginosa biofilms. We also performed partial sequencing and analysis of the Pf 4 replicative form and identified a number of open reading frames not previously recognized in the genome of P. aeruginosa, including a putative postsegregational killing operon...|$|R
40|$|Bat assemblages inhabiting two {{discrete}} karst {{areas in}} north Vietnam were sampled from 2006 - 2008.   Inventory {{studies indicate that}} Vietnamese karst areas with intact primary forest harbour {{a large proportion of}} the national bat fauna with levels of species richness which may greatly exceed those of other forest types in-country.   Forests on karst ridgetops in degraded areas are capable of supporting high bat species richness at low abundances and their persistence as linear tracts and <b>latticeworks</b> of forest in anthropogenic landscapes may provide corridors for the movement of forest-dependent bats.   Reproductive studies demonstrate that the timing of major reproductive events (pregnancy, lactation and weaning) coincide for two pteropodids and for 26 species in three insectivorous bat families.   The high temporal congruence in reproduction and climatic homogeneity of north Vietnam (18 - 23 °N) suggests that these results may have wider applicability.   Echolocation studies involving 30 insectivorous species indicate that correct acoustic identification of free-flying bats is feasible.   Comparisons of conventional capture methods with simultaneous acoustic sampling in a variety of karst habitats demonstrate that acoustic methods are indispensable in maximising inventory completeness in assemblage studies.   Ecomorphological studies of 37 bat species indicate that analysis of wing morphology is useful in predicting foraging habitats.   Results support the hypothesis that bat species highly adapted to foraging in the forest interior are negatively affected by forest degradation.   Three bat species new to science are described.   Factors associated with extinction risk in bats are reviewed and recommendations for conservation management and further research are provided.

5|$|The {{shell is}} {{composed}} of two calcareous valves held together by a ligament. The valves are made of either calcite, {{as is the case}} in oysters, or both calcite and aragonite. Sometimes, the aragonite forms an inner, nacreous layer, {{as is the case in}} the order Pterioida. In other taxa, alternate layers of calcite and aragonite are laid down. The ligament and byssus, if calcified, are composed of aragonite. The outermost layer of the shell is the periostracum, a skin-like layer which {{is composed of}} a conchiolin. The periostracum is secreted in the groove between the outer and middle layers of the mantle, and is usually olive or brown in colour and easily abraded. The outer surface of the valves is often sculpted, with clams often having concentric striations, scallops having radial ribs and oysters a <b>latticework</b> of irregular markings.|$|E

40|$|Uprilogu se raspravlja skulptura iz starokršćanske faze crkve Sv. Marte u Bijaćima kod Trogira, Pronadena je pri arheološkim istraživanjima koja su na ovom lokalitetu vršena u dva navrata; prvi put izmedu 1902. i 1906. i drugi put izmedu 1967. i 1969. godine, Katalog obraduje ukupno 53 cjelovito ili fragmentarno sačuvana spomenika razvrstana u nekoliko grupa: sarkofazi, arhitektonska plastika (baze stupovi i kapiteli crkvenih brodova), pragovi, elementi prozora (prozorski stupići i tranzene) i elementi liturgijskog namještaja (oltar, oltarna ograda i ambon). Spomenici o kojima je riječ, danas se čuvaju u Arheološkom muzeju i Muzeju hrvatskih arheoloških spomenika u Splitu, ili su još uvijek na nalazištu u izvornom položajuThe {{sculpture}} {{presented in}} this catalogue are the paleoChristian stone church fixtures discovered in the course ojthe two research campaigns at the locality of St. Martha (Sv. Marta) in Bijaći. The first one, headed by F. Bulić, was performed by the Croatian Society for Exploring the National History of Split (Hrvatsko društvo za istraživanje domaće povijesti u Spijetu) The then excavated artefacts are situated at the very locality or are kept in the depot and the lapidarium of the Archaeological Museum of Split. All of them were listed between 1902 and 1905 in the Museum Inventary B, however, marks of this first inventorying have been preserved in traces only. 1 /accompanied with the mark BIH (the Bihać Collection), the preserved numbers and letters are written in red paint. Several fragments from this site have been reinventoried in {{the last twenty years}} and makeparts of the Inventary Eor S,which explains the multiple inventary references. The exception is a sarcophagus entered in the Museum Inventary A. During the second stage of the excavations, headed by Dušan jelovina and Dasen Vrsalović, from 1967 to 1969,a large number of paleo-Christian fragments were found, too, some of them still at the site and some, mostly smaller and better preserved anes, taken to the Croatian Archaeological Monuments Museum (Muzej hrvatskih arheoloških spomenika) at Split. Presently, they are stored in the Museum depot. It is to be underlined here that the jelovina 2 ̆ 7 s and Vrsalović-field inventories record and catalogue all artefacts they found at the site during the excavations, including those already inventoried at the Bulić time. This catalogue records all paleo-Christian artefacts from the site, regardless of where they are now: at the site in Bijaći, in the Archaeological Museum at Split, or in the Croatian Archaeological Monuments Museum at Split. Sometimes, it was hard to determine whether, for instance, a column fragment in the Bulić 2 ̆ 7 s inventary is Roman, paleo-Christian or early-medieval, the data sometimes even lacking the dimensions that could enable a more precise classification. Nevertheless, the collected material still enables creation of an acceptable image of the decorations and fixtures from the paleo-Christian church with baptistery, surrounded with burials in sarcophaguses. All the preserved fragments have been classified into two groups: -architectural elements (thresholds, window columns, imposts, window <b>latticeworks,</b> bases, shafts and capitals of the vessel colonnades); -liturgical elements (altar and auxiliary table, altar or baptistery font ciborium, high cancellum and ambo). Eventually, the entire materialproved sufficient to date the construction of the church (or its equipping) to the (6 th century, or {{the second half of the}} (6 th century for the ambo. It is noticed too that the church with its baptistery and liturgical fixtures fit perjectly the closer regional context, powerfully influenced by Salona, which is perfectly understandable. It is also interesting to notice that the location of the baptistery is not of the so called Salonitan type, although the closest parallels of capitals from the church in Bij 2 ̆ 7 aći are at Gradina and in the southern apse of the medieval church of Ss, Peter and Moses of Solin, Finally, this church and baptistery, most probably dedicated to St. John the Baptist, are built on top of the remains of a Roman villa, and finely depict the Christianity in the rural community of the Salonitan diocesis in the 6 th century...|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to Humayun's tomb, the more closely contemporary Tomb of Itmad-Ud-Daulah marked {{a new era}} of Mughal architecture. It was built by the empress Nur Jehan for her father from 1622–1625 AD (1031–1034 AH) and is small in comparison to many other Mughal-era tombs. So exquisite is the execution of its surface treatments, it is often described as a jewel box. The garden layout, hierarchical use of white marble and sandstone, Parchin kari inlay designs and <b>latticework</b> presage many elements of the Taj Mahal. The cenotaph of Nur Jehan's father is laid, off centre, to the west of her mother. This break in symmetry was repeated in the Taj where Mumtaz was interred in the geometric centre of the complex and Jahan is laid to her side. These close similarities with the tomb of Mumtaz have earned it the sobriquet - The Baby Taj.|$|E
25|$|Both Suther and Régine Tessier, {{the latter}} in a sketch of Sage in Notable American Women: The Modern Period, note key {{features}} of Sage’s mature work. Most of Sage’s paintings focus on free-standing architectural structures, including walls, towers, and <b>latticework,</b> which could represent buildings either under construction or ruined and decaying. Some contain figures that {{might or might not}} be human, hidden by flowing drapery. (Le Passage, one of Sage’s last paintings, is perhaps the only one containing a definite human figure; even Small Portrait, thought by many to be a self-portrait, is hardly recognizable as a face.) Like Tanguy, Sage often sets her objects on deserts or plains that recede to immeasurably distant horizons. She renders her forms in meticulous, photographic detail, using a gray-green-ochre palette that Tessier describes as “reminiscent of the sulphurous light before a thunderstorm”. Critics frequently called Sage’s work disturbing or depressing, even when they praised her painterly skill.|$|E
25|$|An unusual cigar-shaped aluminium-clad {{steel tower}} {{supported}} by cables, the Skylon was the “Vertical Feature” {{that was an}} abiding symbol of the Festival of Britain. The base was nearly 15 metres (50feet) from the ground, with the top nearly 90 metres (300feet) high. The frame was clad in aluminium louvres lit from within at night. It was designed by Hidalgo Moya, Philip Powell and Felix Samuely, and fabricated by Painter Brothers of Hereford, England, between Westminster Bridge and Hungerford Bridge. It had a steel <b>latticework</b> frame, pointed at both ends and supported on cables slung between three steel beams.
