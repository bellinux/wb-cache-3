As a result, areas coated by barium sulfate will appear white on an X-ray film. The passage of barium through the gastrointestinal tract is observed by a radiologist using a fluoroscope attached to a TV monitor. The radiologist takes a series of individual X-ray images at timed intervals depending on the areas to be studied. Sometimes medication which produces gas in the gastrointestinal tract is administered together with the Barium sulfate.

30|$|Advanced haemodynamic {{monitoring}} is {{a cornerstone}} of intensive care [1, 2]. Besides the pulmonary artery catheter (PAC), transpulmonary thermodilution (TPTD) is another technology that using a conventional arterial access instead of the pulmonary arterial route avoids several risks and severe complications of the PAC [3] such as arrhythmias and pulmonary arterial embolism. Usually, the femoral arterial access {{is used for the}} insertion of the TPTD catheter which, in addition to a conventional <b>lumen</b> <b>providing</b> invasive arterial pressure, includes a thermistor for TPTD. This additional feature slightly increases the diameter compared to a conventional arterial line, being the main reason to prefer femoral arterial access. Despite this, TPTD has also been validated using a special catheter via the radial artery approach [4]. This catheter is 50  cm long in order to reach the subclavian artery and receive a true reflection of central aortic pressure [5]. Due to the increased diameter and length compared to a conventional radial arterial line (4 Fr and 50  cm vs. 2.7 Fr and 8  cm), the radial TPTD arterial line might induce more complications including ischemic events and long-term impairment of blood flow compromising distal perfusion, especially if the collateral circulation is damaged [6].|$|E
40|$|In oncological {{patients}} with upper gastrointestinal tract tumours, dysphagia and cachexy necessitate gastrostomy orjejunostomy {{as the only}} options of enteral access for long-term feeding. In this article the authors describe a modifiedtechnique of laparoscopic feeding jejunostomy applied during the staging laparoscopy. A 48 -year-old male patient withgastroesophageal junction tumour and a 68 -year-old male patient with oesophageal tumour were operated on usingthe described technique. Exploratory laparoscopy was performed. Then the feeding jejunostomy was made usinga Cystofix® TUR catheter. The jejunum was fixed to the abdominal wall with four 2. 0 Novafil™ transabdominal stitches. Two additional sutures were placed caudally about 4 cm and 8 cm from the jejunostomy, aiming at prevention ofjejunal torsion. Total operating time was 45 min. There was no blood loss. There were no intraoperative complications. The only adverse event was one jejunostomy wound infection that responded well to oral antibiotics. There were nomortalities. The described technique has most {{of the benefits of}} laparoscopic feeding jejunostomy with some stepsadded from the open operation making the procedure easier to perform as part of a staging operation with a relativelyshort additional operating time. The proposed transabdominal stitches make the technique easier to apply. Two additional‘anti-torsion sutures’ prevent postoperative volvulus. Use of the Cystofix catheter allows easy introduction of thecatheter into the peritoneal cavity and the jejunal <b>lumen,</b> <b>providing</b> a good seal at the same time.

Permeabilities {{of sodium}} (PNa) and urea (Pu) were simultaneously determined from the lumen-to-bath efflux of 22 Na and [14 C]urea. PNa and Pu were also measured by in vivo microperfusion of descending (DVR) and ascending vasa recta (AVR) at the papillary tip of Munich-Wistar rats. In some OMVR PNa was indistinguishable from zero. The mean +/- SE of PNa (x 10 (- 5), cm/s) in OMVR was 76 +/- 9. Pu in OMVR {{was always very}} high (x 10 (- 5), cm/s), 360 +/- 14. There was no correlation between OMVR PNa and Pu. Inner medullary AVR and DVR had PNa of 115 +/- 10 and 75 +/- 10, respectively, and Pu of 121 +/- 10 and 76 +/- 11, respectively. PNa and Pu in papillary vasa recta were always nearly identical and highly correlated. Transport of [14 C] urea in OMVR was reversibly inhibited by addition of unlabeled urea or phloretin to the bath and <b>lumen,</b> <b>providing</b> evidence for carrier-mediated transport. These data suggest that sodium and urea might traverse the wall of inner medullary vasa recta by a paracellular pathway while urea also crosses by a transcellular route in OMVR. Electron microscopic examination of seven in vitro perfused OMVR revealed no fenestrations and exposure of these vessels to 10 microM calcium ionophore A 23187 or 1 nM angiotensin II resulted in reversible contraction, suggesting that in vitro perfused OMVR are DVR only...|$|E
40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that tumors elicit specific T cell responses in a substantial proportion of patients. Many tumor-associated antigens (TAA) like Ep-CAM, CEA and her- 2 /neu {{have already been}} identified as targets for specific T cell responses in patients with various malignancies including colorectal cancer. It is not clear yet weather patients with other adenocarcinomas expressing the same TAA possess similar T cell responses. The aim of our study was to analyze T cell responses against HLA-A* 0201 -restricted epitopes of the TAA Ep-CAM p 263 - 271, CEA p 571 - 579 and her- 2 /neu p 654 - 662 in peripheral blood of patients with breast cancer (BC) and compare it with T cell reactivity found in colorectal cancer (CRC). Therefore we used the IFNgamma-ELISPOT assay a sensitive and reproducible method {{for the detection of}} TAA-reactive T cells directly ex vivo in unstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. As a positive control for the general T cell reactivity, specific T cells against the flu matrix protein p 58 - 66 were determined. A comparative analysis of distribution of patients with BC or CRC for stage and prior therapy revealed that both patient groups had received comparable prior therapies including surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. RESULTS: Surprisingly, a complete absence of ex vivo T cell responses against these TAA was found in 20 patients with BC. In contrast, specific T cells were detectable in 5 of 27 (18, 5 %) patients with CRC against at least 1 of these TAA. T cell responses against influenza-derived peptides were similar in both groups of cancer patients. The comparison of TAA-specific T cell responses in BC- and CRC-patients in the &# 967; 2 -test shows a statistically significant difference (p= 0, 042). In 4 BC patients we were able to obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cells before and after therapy with anti-her 2 /neu-antibody (Herceptin®). In one of these BC-patients T cells specifically secreting IFN-gamma could be detected by ELISPOT assay in response to 2 her 2 /neu-peptides (p 369 - 377; p 883 - 899) and one Ep-CAM-peptide (p 263 - 271) after 4 cycles of therapy. CONCLUSION: The results of our study indicate a difference either of tumor immunogenicity or of the migratory pattern of tumor-specific T cells between BC- and CRC-patients. Also, one obvious difference between CRC and BC is the location of CRC in the colorectal <b>lumen,</b> <b>providing</b> direct contact with external antigens and bacteria. Bacteria are known to be highly productive sources of immunomodulating molecules. Further investigations will be necessary to determine weather antibody therapy against TAA effectively induces tumor-specific T cells.

40|$|AbstractPoxviruses {{differ from}} most DNA viruses by replicating entirely within the cytoplasm. The first {{discernible}} viral structures are crescents and spherical immature virions containing a single lipoprotein membrane bilayer with an external honeycomb lattice.

Nevertheless, transient connections between viral and cellular membranes could {{be difficult to}} resolve. Despite the absence of direct evidence, the intermediate compartment (ERGIC) between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus and the ER itself were considered possible sources of crescent membranes. A break-through in understanding poxvirus membrane biogenesis has come from recent studies of the abortive replication of several vaccinia virus null mutants.

40|$|Nanopores {{fabricated}} from glass microcapillaries {{are used}} in applications ranging from scanning ion conductance microscopy to single molecule detection. Still, evaluating the nanocapillary tip by a non-invasive means remains challenging. For instance, electron microscopy characterization techniques can charge, heat and contaminate the glass surface, and typically require conductive coatings that influence the final tip geometry. Per contra, electrical characterization by the means of ion current through the capillary <b>lumen</b> <b>provides</b> only indirect geometrical details of the tips. Here, we show that Helium scanning transmission ion microscopy provides a non-destructive and precise determination of glass nanocapillary tip geometries. This enables the reproducible fabrication of axially asymmetric blunt, bullet and hourglass-shaped tips with opening diameters from 20 nm to 400 nm by laser-assisted pulling. Accordingly, this allows for an evaluation of how tip shape, pore diameter and opening angle impacts on ionic current rectification behavior and the translocation of single molecules.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{known for a long time}} that the {{thylakoid}} <b>lumen</b> <b>provides</b> the environment for oxygen evolution, plastocyanin-mediated electron transfer and photoprotection. More recently lumenal proteins have been revealed to play roles in numerous processes, most often linked with regulating thylakoid biogenesis and the activity and turnover of photosynthetic protein complexes, especially the PSII and NAD(P) H dehydrogenase-like complexes. Still, the functions of the majority of lumenal proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana are unknown. Interestingly, while the thylakoid lumen proteome of at least 80 proteins contains several large protein families, individual members of many protein families have highly divergent roles. This is indicative of evolutionary pressure leading to neofunctionalisation of lumenal proteins, emphasizing the important role of thylakoid lumen for photosynthetic electron transfer and ultimately for the plant fitness. Furthermore, the involvement of anterograde and retrograde signaling networks that regulate the expression and activity of lumen proteins is increasingly pertinent. Recent studies have also highlighted the importance of thiol/disulphide modulation in controlling the functions of many lumenal proteins and photosynthetic regulation pathways...|$|R

40|$|Devices for venous {{cannulation}} {{have seen}} significant progress over time: the original, rigid steel cannulas have evolved toward flexible plastic cannulas with wire support that prevents kinking, very thin walled wire wound cannulas allowing for percutaneous application, {{and all sorts}} of combinations. In contrast to all these rectilinear venous cannula designs, which present the same cross-sectional area over their entire intravascular path, the smartcanula concept of "collapsed insertion and expansion in situ" is the logical next step for venous access. Automatically adjusting cross-sectional area up to a pre-determined diameter or the vessel <b>lumen</b> <b>provides</b> optimal flow and ease of use for both, insertion and removal. Smartcanula performance was assessed in a small series of patients (76 +/- 17 kg) undergoing redo procedures. The calculated target pump flow (2. 4 L/min/m 2) was 4. 42 +/- 61 L/ min. Mean pump flow achieved during cardiopulmonary bypass was 4. 84 +/- 87 L/min or 110 % of the target. Reduced atrial chatter, kink resistance in situ, and improved blood drainage despite smaller access orifice size, are the most striking advantages of this new device. The benefits of smart cannulation are obvious in remote cannulation for limited access cardiac surgery, but there are many other cannula applications where space is an issue, and that is where smart cannulation is most effective...|$|R
40|$|Embryo {{implantation}} requires synchronized {{dialogue between}} the receptive endometrium and activated blastocyst via locally produced soluble mediators. During the mid-secretory (MS) phase of the menstrual cycle, increased glandular secretion into the uterine <b>lumen</b> <b>provides</b> important mediators that modulate the endometrium and support the conceptus during implantation. Previously we demonstrated the importance of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the human uterus, {{particularly with respect to}} embryo implantation. In the current study, proteomic analysis of human uterine lavage fluid identified the presence of placental growth factor (PlGF) a homolog of VEGF, that binds the VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR 1). Analysis of immunostaining for PlGF in human endometrial tissue across the menstrual cycle (from both fertile and infertile women) revealed PlGF was predominantly localised to glandular and luminal epithelial cells, with staining in the decidualising stromal cells surrounding the maternal spiral arteries in the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle. Immunoreactive PlGF was also detected in subpopulations of endometrial leukocytes. Functional studies demonstrated that culturing mouse embryos with recombinant human (rh) PlGF enhanced blastocyst cell number and outgrowth. Furthermore, treatment of human endometrial epithelial cells (EEC) with rhPlGF enhanced EEC adhesion. Taken together, these data demonstrate that PlGF is abundant in the human endometrium, and secreted into the uterine lumen where it mediates functional changes in cellular adhesion with important roles in implantation.

Ironically, this system has presented problems for the general theory that IP 3 acts primarily on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), because the IP 3 -elicited Ca 2 + release occurs in the apical pole, which is dominated by zymogen granules (ZGs) and apparently contains very little ER. Using confocal and two-photon microscopy {{and a number of}} different ER-specific fluorescent probes, we have now investigated in detail the distribution of the ER in living pancreatic acinar cells. It turns out that although the bulk of the ER, as expected, is clearly located in the baso-lateral part of the cell, there is significant invasion of ER into the granular pole and each ZG is in fact surrounded by strands of ER. This structural evidence from living cells, in conjunction with recent functional studies demonstrating the high Ca 2 + mobility in the ER <b>lumen,</b> <b>provides</b> the framework for a coherent and internally consistent theory for cytosolic Ca 2 + signal generation in the apical secretory pole, in which the primary Ca 2 + release occurs from ER extensions in the granular pole supplied with Ca 2 + from the main store {{at the base of the}} cell by the tunnel function of the ER...|$|R

Videos at frame rates up to 180 fps were collected and processed to extract phase shifts associated with moving erythrocytes in the coronary arteries. Radial averaging centered on the vessel <b>lumen</b> <b>provided</b> spatial smoothing of phase noise in a single cross-sectional frame for instantaneous peak velocity measurement without distortion of the flow profile. Temporal averaging synchronized to the cardiac cycle (i. e., gating) was also performed to reduce phase noise, although resulting in lower flow profiles. The vessel angle with respect to incident imaging beam was measured with three-dimensional raster scans collected from the same region as the high speed cross-sectional scans. The variability in peak phase measurement was 10 - 15 % from cycle to cycle on a single animal but larger for measurements among animals. The inter-subject variability is attributed to factors related to real physiological and anatomical differences, instrumentation variables, and measurement error. The measured peak instantaneous flow velocity in a ~ 40 -µm diameter vessel was 23. 5 mm/s (28 kHz Doppler phase shift). In addition to measurement of the flow velocity, we observed several dynamic features of the vessel and surrounding myocardium in the intensity and phase sequences, including asymmetric vessel deformation and rapid flow reversal immediately following maximum flow, in confirmation of known coronary artery flow dynamics.

Essential for hepatocyte (HC) vitality and function in vitro are a vascularisation to guarantee cell supply and metabolite evacuation, extracellular matrix contact and the co-culture with endothelial cells (EC), which build up a filtration barrier between blood and HC, and are involved in regeneration processes. We created a vascularized matrix for long-term co-culture of human and porcine HC and EC. Basis is a decellularized porcine jejunal segment with an obtained vascular system.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The anabolic effect of growth hormone administration is associated with nitrogen retention and an increase muscle strength, but the impact of growth hormone on nutrient uptake from the gut lumen has not been examined. METHODS: Twelve healthy patients received a daily subcutaneous dose of low-dose GH (0. 1 mg/kg), high-dose GH (0. 2 mg/kg), or no treatment (controls) for 3 days before surgery. At operation, ileum (8 patients) or jejunum (4 patients) was resected, and brush border membrane vesicles (BBMVs) were prepared by differential centrifugation. Vesicle purity was confirmed by a 16 -fold enrichment of marker enzymes. The carrier-mediated transport of glutamine (System B), leucine (System L), alanine (System B), arginine (System y+), MeAIB (methyl alpha-aminoisobutyric acid [System A]), and glucose (Na(+) -dependent glucose transporter) by BBMVs was measured by a rapid mixing/filtration technique. RESULTS: Treatment with low-dose GH resulted in a statistically insignificant increase in amino acid transport rates in jejunal and ileal BBMVs. High-dose GH resulted in a generalized 20 %-to 70 %-stimulation of amino acid transport, whereas glucose transport was not affected. The effects of GH were similar in ileum and jejunum. Kinetic analysis of the transport of glutamine (the most abundant amino acid {{in the body and}} the principal gut fuel) and the essential amino acid leucine revealed that the increase in transport was caused by a 50 % increase in carrier Vmax, consistent with {{an increase in the number}} of functional carriers in the brush border membrane. Pooled analysis of transport velocities demonstrated that total rates of amino acid uptake from the gut lumen were increased significantly by 35 % in GH-treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: The ability of GH to enhance amino acid uptake from the gut <b>lumen</b> <b>provides</b> energy and precursors for protein synthesis in the gut mucosa, as well as additional substrate for anabolism in other organs...|$|R

To analyze the oligomeric properties of calnexin and calnexin-substrate complexes, sucrose velocity gradient centrifugation and chemical cross-linking were used. After CHAPS solubilization of Chinese Hamster Ovary cells, the unoccupied calnexin behaved as a monomer sedimenting at 3. 5 S 20,W. For calnexin-substrate complexes the S-values ranged between 3. 5 – 8 S 20,W, the size increasing with the molecular {{weight of the}} substrate. Influenza hemagglutinin, a well-characterized substrate associated with calnexin in complexes that sedimented at 5 – 5. 5 S 20,W. The majority of stable complexes extracted from cells, appeared to contain a single calnexin and a single substrate molecule, with about {{one third of the}} calnexin in the cell being unoccupied or present in weak associations. However, when chemical cross-linking was performed in intact cells, the calnexin-substrate complexes and calnexin itself was found {{to be part of a}} much larger heterogeneous protein network that included other ER proteins. Pulse-chase analysis of influenza-infected cells combined with chemical cross-linking showed that HA was part of large, heterogeneous, cross-linked entities during the early phases of folding, but no longer after homotrimer assembly. The network of weakly associated resident ER chaperones which included BiP, GRP 94, calreticulin, calnexin, and other proteins, may serve as a matrix that binds early folding and assembly intermediates and restricts their exit from the ER.

40|$|Abstract Background A {{wide variety}} of {{surgical}} techniques are used to perform vasectomy. The purpose of this systematic review was to assess if any surgical techniques to isolate or occlude the vas are associated with better outcomes in terms of occlusive and contraceptive effectiveness, and complications. Methods We searched MEDLINE (1966 -June 2003), EMBASE (1980 -June 2003), reference lists of retrieved articles, urology textbooks, and our own files looking for studies comparing two or more vasectomy surgical techniques and reporting on effectiveness and complications. From 2, 058 titles or abstracts, two independent reviewers identified 224 as potentially relevant. Full reports of 219 articles were retrieved and final selection {{was made by the}} same two independent reviewers using the same criteria as for the initial selection. Discrepancies were resolved by involving a third reviewer. Data were extracted and methodological quality of selected studies was assessed by two independent reviewers. Studies were divided in broad categories (isolation, occlusion, and combined isolation and occlusion techniques) and sub-categories of specific surgical techniques performed. Qualitative analyses and syntheses were done. Results Of 31 comparative studies (37 articles), only four were randomized clinical trials, most studies were observational and retrospective. Overall methodological quality was low. From nine studies on vas isolation, there is good evidence that the no-scalpel vasectomy approach decreases the risk of surgical complications, namely hematoma/bleeding and infection, compared with incisional techniques. Five comparative studies including one high quality randomized clinical trial provided good evidence that fascial interposition (FI) increases the occlusive effectiveness of ligation and excision. Results of 11 comparative studies suggest that FI with cautery of the vas <b>lumen</b> <b>provides</b> the highest level of occlusive effectiveness, even when leaving the testicular end open. Otherwise, firm evidence to support any occlusion technique in terms of increased effectiveness or decreased risk of complications is lacking. Conclusions Current evidence supports no-scalpel vasectomy as the safest surgical approach to isolate the vas when performing vasectomy. Adding FI increases effectiveness beyond ligation and excision alone. Occlusive effectiveness appears to be further improved by combining FI with cautery. Methodologically sound prospective controlled studies should be conducted to evaluate specific occlusion techniques further. </p...|$|R

Expression of J 13 Lp alone in cells is sufficient to induce collapsed ER cisternae. Collapse was dependent on a cysteine residue in the N-terminal domain of J 13 Lp exposed to the ER lumen. Luminal collapse was also dependent on the expression of J 13 Lp within stacks of ER where antiparallel interactions between the cytoplasmic domains of J 13 Lp orientated N-terminal domains across ER cisternae. Cisternal collapse was then driven by disulphide bonds between N-terminal domains arranged in antiparallel arrays across the ER <b>lumen.</b> This <b>provides</b> a novel mechanism for biogenesis of modified stacks of ER present in cells infected with ASFV, and may also be relevant to cellular processes. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that fructans, a soluble dietary fiber, are {{beneficial}} to human health and offer a promising approach for the treatment of some diseases. Fructans are nonreducing carbohydrates composed of fructosyl units and terminated by a single glucose molecule. These carbohydrates may be straight or branched with varying degrees of polymerization. Additionally, fructans are resistant to hydrolysis by human digestive enzymes but can be fermented by the colonic microbiota to produce short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), metabolic by-products that possess immunomodulatory activity. The indirect role of fructans in stimulating probiotic growth is one of the mechanisms through which fructans exert their prebiotic activity and improve health or ameliorate disease. However, a more direct mechanism for fructan activity has recently been suggested; fructans may interact with immune cells in the intestinal lumen to modulate immune responses in the body. Fructans are currently being studied for their potential as “ROS scavengers” that benefit intestinal epithelial cells by improving their redox environment. In this review, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of fructans interaction with the intestinal immune system, the gut microbiota, and other components of the intestinal <b>lumen</b> to <b>provide</b> an overview of the mechanisms underlying the effects of fructans on health and disease...|$|R
40|$|Chronic maxillary atelectasis (CMA) is {{characterized}} by a reduced maxillary sinus volume due to an inward bowing of {{one or more of the}} sinus walls. The disorder is probably caused by an obstruction of the maxillary ostium, leading to a persistent negative pressure within the sinus <b>lumen.</b> To <b>provide</b> insight into the epidemiology, pathogenesis and treatment of this disorder, a retrospective study of twelve cases that met radiographic criteria of CMA was carried out. The patients were equally divided between both sexes and were on average 25 years old. Five of the twelve patients were under eighteen years of age. The patients had chronic sinonasal complaints except two, who had a "silent sinus syndrome", characterized by enophthalmos associated with a marked sinus deformation. This is the first report of CMA associated with a benign nasal tumour and also of CMA following cicatrisation due to nasal packing for bleeding after endoscopic sinus surgery. All patients were treated surgically by creating a middle meatal antrostomy, thus restoring sinus ventilation. To conclude, CMA is rare and probably underestimated, especially in the paediatric population. Different entities causing a complete ostial occlusion can lead to CMA. Endoscopically restoring maxillary sinus ventilation is the recommended treatment. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{secretory}} pathway {{is one of}} {{the hallmarks}} of eukaryotic cells. The pathway furnishes the cells with an elaborate membrane network operating in the space between the nucleus and the plasma membrane. It includes all the cellular organelles and membranes, excluding the organelles that emerged as a result of bacterial endosymbiosis (mitochondria, chloroplasts and peroxisomes). The organelles and membranes of the secretory pathway as well as the plasma membrane are connected to each other by a continuous membrane flow that results in exchange of materials and directional sorting of membrane proteins and lipids. Nevertheless, the composition of the membranes of all the organelles connected with the secretory pathway is unique, and the specific internal contents of the organelles are maintained. The assembly and maintenance of this dynamic entity require energy at several levels. Although part of the energy is provided by cytoplasmic metabolic processes, {{a large part of the}} energy utilized to build up and maintain the unique composition of the <b>lumen</b> is <b>provided</b> by ion pumps. The vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) provides much of this energy in the form of a proton-motive force. Energetization of organelles by V-ATPase also results in their acidification. The level of acidification is dependent on the extent and quality of secondary transport systems, as well as on the specific properties of the specific V-ATPase operatin...|$|R
40|$|The crop {{of adult}} Phormia regina {{consists}} of a duct that diverges from the esophagus, {{just in front of}} the cardia, and extends ventrally and posteriorly into the thorax and abdomen where it forms a bilobed sac. Flattened epithelial cells produce the cuticular lining of the crop. When empty, or partially full, the epithelial cells and cuticular lining form folds extending into the <b>lumen,</b> thus <b>providing</b> for expansion as the crop sac fills. Covering the sac on the hemolymph side is a layer of anastomosed, intrinsic muscles connected to one another by intercellular cytoplasmic bridges. Mitochondria are located at the periphery of the sarcomere. Also inside the sarcomere are glycogen, sarcoplasmic reticula, and transverse tubular systems (T-system). I, A, and Z-bands are present and the Z-bands are not in register making the muscle-type supercontractile. Important structures, not previously researched and associated with the crop muscles, are the crop nerves. Coming off the corpora cardiaca, and running down each side of the crop duct, is a pair of nerves, each housing several axons. These nerves extend to and branch over the crop sac. Here they penetrate the muscle mass and form neuromuscular junctions where electron-dense droplets of neurosecretion are released. Based on the literature, and research in our laboratory, it has now been shown that these nerves carry adipokinetic hormone, Drosophila insulin-like peptide, and a dromyosuppressin-like neuropeptide...|$|R

40|$|The LIM 1863 colon {{carcinoma}} {{cell line}} grows as structural organoids of goblet and columnar cells around a central <b>lumen</b> and <b>provides</b> {{a model for}} the development of stem cells in the normal colon. The organoid structure can be disrupted by removal of calcium from the medium, resulting in a suspension of single cells. Upon readdition of calcium, the cells reform the organoid structure over a period of 24 h, and ultrastructural examination of the reforming cells reveals that this involves a complex process that we have termed clutching. To determine the adhesion molecules involved in organoid formation we attempted to block this process by single cell suspensions of LIM 1863 reseeded in the presence of monoclonal antibodies. An anti-integrin antibody directed against a conformational epitope on the alpha v subunit totally inhibited organoid reformation. As a consequence of this inhibition of cell contact the colon carcinoma cells rapidly underwent apoptosis. Investigations of the apoptotic pathway involved suggested an induction mechanism since the onset of apoptosis in the contact- inhibited cells showed specific increased synthesis of 68 - and 72 -kD proteins. In addition, immunoblotting of cytosolic and nuclear extracts of the cells revealed the rapid translocation of the tumor suppressor gene product, p 53 to the cell nucleus upon induction of apoptosis. These results suggest that cell-cell adhesion may be a vital regulator of colon development overcome in tumor cells by loss of adhesion molecules or of functional p 53 protein...|$|R
