60|$|But again, a selfish, greedy {{man comes}} often, and sits in my clothes. A man who frets away his <b>life,</b> <b>planning</b> {{how to get}} more money--more food, more clothes, more pleasures for himself; a man so busy {{thinking}} of the many things he needs he has no time to dwell upon the needs of others. He deems himself {{the centre of the}} universe. You would imagine, hearing him grumbling, that the world had been created and got ready against the time when he should come to take his pleasure in it. He would push and trample, heedless, reaching towards these many desires of his; and when, grabbing, he misses, he curses Heaven for its injustice, and men and women for getting in his path. He is not a nice man, in any way. I wish, as I say, he would not come so often and sit in my clothes. He persists that he is I, and that I am only a sentimental fool, spoiling his chances. Sometimes, for a while, I get rid of him, but he always comes back; and then he gets rid of me and I become him. It is very confusing. Sometimes I wonder if I really am myself.|$|E

50|$|ISO 15686 is the in {{development}} ISO standard dealing with service <b>life</b> <b>planning.</b> It {{is a decision}} process which addresses {{the development of the}} service life of a building component, building or other constructed work like a bridge or tunnel. Its approach is to ensure a proposed design life has a structured response in establishing its service life normally from a reference or estimated service life framework. Then in turn secure a life-cycle cost profile (or Whole-life cost when called for) whilst addressing environmental factors like life cycle assessment and service life care and end of life considerations including obsolescence and embodied energy recovery.

50|$|Script {{analysis}} at {{the individual}} level considers that 'from the early transactions between mother, father and child, a <b>life</b> <b>plan</b> evolves.

Fortunately, scripts can be changed, since they are not inborn, but learned'. Many of these same people developing a <b>life</b> <b>plan,</b> start businesses or work into leadership positions in organisations.
