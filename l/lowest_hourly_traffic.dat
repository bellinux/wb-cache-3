The best agreement with the traffic noise was found by using the so-called normal traffic flow rate, yielding overlaps between 68 and 97 %.

The partial effect of cold categories on weekday <b>hourly</b> truck <b>traffic</b> {{is presented in}} Fig.  8 b, and the mean <b>hourly</b> <b>traffic</b> factor {{does not appear to}} be changed considerably except for CC 4. A very small amount of increase in the mean hourly factor (0.049 – 0.0515) is observed between CC 3 and CC 4. However, it can be interpreted into marginal increase in terms of real truck number (1 – 2 vehicles) based on the parameter of annual average daily truck traffic (AADTT) for the study site. For other cold categories, based on the tests of significance carried out in this study, it is found that the drop (or increase) in the <b>hourly</b> <b>traffic</b> factor cannot be considered statistically significant. In the case of weekend (Fig.  9 b), the plot seemingly indicates upward and downward patterns that, however, are not statistically significant.

A method is proposed in this paper to predict <b>hourly</b> <b>traffic</b> flows up to and into the near future, using historical data collected from the Hong Kong Annual Traffic Census (ATC). Two parametric and two non-parametric models have been employed and evaluated in this study. The results show that the non-parametric models (Non-Parametric Regression (NPR) and Gaussian Maximum Likelihood (GML)) were more promising for predicting <b>hourly</b> <b>traffic</b> flows at the selected ATC station. Further analysis encompassing 87 ATC stations revealed that the NPR is likely to react to unexpected changes more effectively than the GML method, while the GML model performs better under steady traffic flows. Taking into consideration the dynamic nature of the common traffic patterns in Hong Kong and the advantages/disadvantages of the various models, the NPR model is recommended for predicting the <b>hourly</b> <b>traffic</b> flows in that region.

40|$|Average Annual Daily Traffic is {{typically}} estimated by applying seasonal factors (SFs) to short-term counts. SFs are obtained from continuous count sites and assigned to short-term count sites. This assignment procedure is usually empirical and subjective. Some {{previous studies have}} attempted to establish relationships between SFs and influential variables to provide an objective and data-driven alternative for SF assignment. However, in rural areas, SFs are difficult to model due to low land use intensity and, sometimes, significant through traffic. This paper presents a study of relationships between monthly SFs and <b>hourly</b> <b>traffic</b> patterns, land use, and other variables, using data from 116 continuous counters in rural areas throughout Florida. It is found that <b>hourly</b> <b>traffic</b> patterns are related to traffic seasonality {{and can be used}} to improve the modeling of influential variables that affect SF. The influential variables are then used for seasonal factor assignment and estimation.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{generalized}} model {{to estimate the}} peak hour origin-destination (OD) traffic demand variation from day-to-day <b>hourly</b> <b>traffic</b> counts throughout the whole year. Different from the conventional OD estimation methods, the proposed modeling approach aims to estimate not only the mean but also the variation (in terms of covariance matrix) of the OD demands during the same peak hour periods due to day-to-day fluctuation over the whole year. For this purpose, this paper fully considers the first- and second-order statistical properties of the day-to-day <b>hourly</b> <b>traffic</b> count data so as to capture the stochastic characteristics of the OD demands. The proposed model is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem. In the upper-level problem, a weighted least squares method is used to estimate the mean and covariance matrix of the OD demands. In the lower-level problem, a reliability-based traffic assignment model is adopted {{to take account of}} travelers' risk-taking path choice behaviors under OD demand variation. A heuristic iterative estimation-assignment algorithm is proposed for solving the bi-level optimization problem. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the applications of the proposed model for assessment of network performance over the whole year.

Three suitable techniques emerged from pilot studies of such series conducted by Watson et a 1 (1992 a) and Redfern et a 1 (1992). The three techniques are: a) Maintaining an average and variability measure over time; b) ARIMA modelling with detection of large residuals; C) A point's influence on the correlation structure of the series.

40|$|A {{regression}} model for predicting L 10 noise levels at roadsides due to {{urban road traffic}} in Hong Kong was developed. It was found that urban traffic noise depends on the logarithmic functions of the <b>hourly</b> <b>traffic</b> flow (logQ), the number of heavy vehicles (logHV) and the average speed of vehicles (logV). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's studentized method confirmed that the <b>hourly</b> <b>traffic</b> flow {{and the number of}} heavy vehicles are the most significant factors in urban traffic noise.

The statistical frequency distribution of urban traffic noise was obtained based on the noise levels measured in the winter months of 2000. It was found that urban traffic noise is characterized by chi-squared distributions with a degree of freedom of 6 for interrupted traffic flow and with a different dof of 12 for free traffic flow. Two noise sources with the same or different chi-squared distributions can be combined using the method of probability combination.

40|$|Estimation {{of vehicle}} speed and delay is {{fundamental}} to many forms of transportation planning analyses including air quality, long-range travel forecasting, major investment studies, and congestion management systems. However, existing planning-level techniques do {{a poor job of}} estimating the duration and extent of congestion. To improve the state of the practice, a simplified queuing-based model, QSIM, was developed. QSIM incorporates several features including: the use of temporal distributions as a basis for developing <b>hourly</b> <b>traffic</b> estimates; estimation of “peak spreading”; accounting for daily variation in <b>traffic</b> by allowing <b>hourly</b> <b>traffic</b> estimates to vary stochastically; for freeways, the inclusion of a capacity drop after flow has broken down (i. e., after the onset of queuing) to model the growth and dissipation of queues; for arterials, considering the effects of signal density and progression; separate functions to estimate speeds in queuing and free-flow conditions based on relationships developed with microscopic traffic simulation models; use of the concept of highway capacity to determine when traffic operates under free-flow and queuing conditions as well as a basis for estimating free-flow speeds and the extent of queuing on the test link; and estimating delay rather than speed as the predictive variable. (Speed is then developed as a function of delay and free-flow speed.) The model was used to develop a dataset from which a series of predictive equations were developed. The equations use only a few, readily available independent variables. Application of the new procedure shows that under congested conditions, it predicts substantially more delay than do traditional methods. Future work includes field validation of the models and extending them to cover a variety of bottleneck conditions...|$|R
