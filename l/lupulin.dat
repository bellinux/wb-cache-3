ESTs representing enzymes of terpenoid biosynthesis, including {{all of the}} steps of the methyl 4 -erythritol phosphate pathway, were abundant in the EST data set, as were ESTs for the known type III polyketide synthases of bitter acid and xanthohumol biosynthesis. The xanthohumol biosynthetic pathway involves a key O-methylation step. Four S-adenosyl-l-methionine–dependent O-methyltransferases (OMTs) with similarity to known flavonoid-methylating enzymes were present in the EST data set. OMT 1, which was the most highly expressed OMT based on EST abundance and RT-PCR analysis, performs the final reaction in xanthohumol biosynthesis by methylating desmethylxanthohumol to form xanthohumol. OMT 2 accepted a broad range of substrates, including desmethylxanthohumol, but did not form xanthohumol.

However, optimized protocols for RNA extraction from hop cones are not available. In this study, the RNeasy midi kit protocol was modified to isolate high amounts of total RNA from fresh and freeze-dried hop tissues, specifically leaves, female inflorescences, and lupulin-enriched hop cone fractions. The main difficulties in obtaining high RNA yields were related to specific features of hop, including the abundance of secondary metabolites and their accumulation in the sticky <b>lupulin</b> glands. The introduction of a number of modifications into the RNeasy midi kit protocol resulted in RNA of high quality, as assessed by spectrophotometry and electrophoresis in agarose gels.

Results Homologues of flavonoid-regulating TFs HlMyb 2 (M 2), HlbHLH 2 (B 2) and HlWDR 1 (W 1) from hop were cloned using a <b>lupulin</b> gland-specific cDNA library from the hop variety Osvald's 72. Using a "combinatorial" transient GUS expression system it was shown that these unique lupulin-gland-associated TFs significantly activated the promoter (P) of chs _H 1 in ternary combinations of B 2, W 1 and either M 2 or the previously characterized Hl Myb 3 (M 3). The promoter activation was strongly dependent on the Myb-P binding box TCCTACC having a core sequence CCWACC positioned on its 5 ' end region and it seems that the complexity of the promoter plays an important role. M 2 B 2 W 1 -mediated activation significantly exceeded the strength of expression of native chs _H 1 gene driven by the 35 S promoter of CaMV, while M 3 B 2 W 1 resulted in 30 % of the 35 S: chs _H 1 expression level, as quantified by real-time PCR. Another newly cloned hop TF, Hl Myb 7, containing a transcriptional repressor-like motif pdLNLD/ELxiG/S (PDLNLELRIS), was identified as an efficient inhibitor of chs _H 1 -activating TFs.

The dissection of biosynthetic pathway(s) of these compounds in <b>lupulin</b> glands, {{as well as its}} regulation by transcription factors (TFs), is important for efficient biotech no logical manipulation of the hop metabolome. TFs of the bZIP class were preselected from the hop transcriptome using a cDNA-AFLP approach and cloned from a cDNA library based on glandular tissue-enriched hop cones. The cloned TFs HlbZIP 1 A and HlbZIP 2 have predicted molecular masses of 27. 4 and 34. 2 kDa, respectively, and both are similar to the group A 3 bZIP TFs according to the composition of characteristic domains. While HlbZIP 1 A is rather neutral (pl 6. 42), HlbZIP 2 is strongly basic (pl 8, 51). A truncated variant of HlbZIP 1 (HlbZIP 1 B), which is strongly basic but lacks the leucine zipper domain, has also been cloned from hop. Similar to the previously cloned HIMyb 3 from hop, both bZIP TFs show a highly specific expression in <b>lupulin</b> glands, although low expression was observed also in other tissues including roots and immature pollen. Comparative functional analyses of HbZip 1 A, HlbZip 2, and subvariants of HIMyb 3 were performed in a transient expression system using Nicotiana benthamiana leaf coinfiltration with Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains bearing hop TFs and selected promoters fused to the GUS reference gene. both hop bZIP TFs and HIMyb 3 mainly activated the promoters of chalcone synthase chs_H 1 and the,newly cloned O-methyl transferase 1 genes, while the response of the valerophenone synthase promoter to the cloned hop TFs was very low. These analyses also showed that the cloned bZIP TFs are not strictly G-box-specific.

These acids have no {{bitterness}} of their own, but can be isomerized and subsequently hydrogenated to form bitter iso-α-acids and tetrahydroiso-α-acids respectively. Current literature values for the detection thresholds of iso-α-acid and tetrahydroiso-α-acid in lager beer have been reported using American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) method 679, a method commonly used to find detection thresholds of various compounds. ASTM method 679 is currently described as a “rapid method” and was a forerunner to ASTM method 1432, the current standard method for finding human detection thresholds. It has been argued that ASTM method 679 is statistically weaker than ASTM method 1432, as a group threshold found using ASTM method 679 is based on an individual “best estimate threshold” found using only one ascending series of 3 -altrnative forced choice (3 -AFC) presentations per panelist. The group threshold found using ASTM method 1432 is based on individual thresholds that are determined using data from 6 ascending series of 3 -AFC presentations per panelist, the principle being that test repetition will help nullify moment-to-moment panelist variation. However, test repetition takes time, and the lack of repetition required for ASTM method 679 makes the method quicker and simpler to implement than ASTM method 1432. Current literature detection threshold values for both iso-α-acids and tetrahydroiso-α-acids in lager beer have not been found using ASTM method 1432. The primary objective of the research presented in this paper was to use the current ASTM standard method to determine updated threshold values for both iso-α-acids and tetrahydroiso-α-acids in lager beer. The secondary objective of this research was to compare threshold results from the same data set using ASTM method 679 and ASTM method 1432 to evaluate whether these methods provide statistically similar results. Findings showed that implementation of ASTM method 679 to find individual thresholds did produce results that were not statistically different from individual results found using ASTM method 1432. All group thresholds except the Day 1 tetrahydroiso-α-acid threshold found using ASTM 679 were also statistically in agreement with group thresholds obtained using ASTM method 1432. Beta acids, like alpha acids, {{are found in}} the <b>lupulin</b> glands of hops cones. Beta acids oxidize to form bitter compounds. Beta acids and tetrahydroiso-α-acids {{have been found to be}} miticidal against varroa mites, parasitic mites that feed off of and damage honeybees and bee larva. Though beta acids and tetrahydroiso-α-acids are FDA-declared GRAS substances, and will have no ill-effects on honey consumers, bees may transfer the bitter acids to their honey. Detectable levels of these bitter substances could lead to consumer rejection of honey from hives treated with beta acids or tetrahydroiso-α-acids. In a second experiment discussed in this thesis, the detection thresholds of beta acids and tetrahydroiso-α-acids were found in light clover honey. A method for the extraction and quantification of beta acids and tetrahydroiso-α-acids in beer and wort was modified and verified for the extraction and quantification of hops acids in honey. This method combined with group threshold data obtained in this experiment can be used in an industrial setting to determine whether the concentrations of beta acids and/or tetrahydro-iso-α-acids that may have been transferred to honey are above or below the human detection threshold...|$|E

Southern blot analyses indicated that HIMyb 3 is a unique gene, which was detected in various Humulus lupulus cultivars, but not in Humulus japonicus. Reverse transcription and real-time PCR revealed {{the highest levels of}} HIMyb 3 mRNA in hop cones at a late stage of maturation and in colored petiole epidermis, while the lowest levels were observed in hop flowers. Two alternative open reading frames starting in the N-terminal domain of HIMyb 3, encoding for proteins having 269 and 265 amino acids with apparent molecular masses of 30. 3 and 29. 9 kDa, respectively, were analyzed as transgenes that were overexpressed in Arabidopsis thaliana, Nicotiana benthamiana, and Petunia hybrida plants. Transformation with the longer 269 aa variant designated I-HIMyb 3 led to a flowering delay and to a strong inhibition of seed germination in A. thaliana. Nearly complete flower sterility, dwarfing, and leaf curling of P. hybrida and N. benthamiana I-HIMyb 3 transgenotes were noted. On the contrary, the shorter 265 -aa-encoding s-HIMyb 3 transgene led in A. thaliana to the stimulation of initial seed germination, to fast initiation of the lateral roots, and to quite specific branching phenotypes with many long lateral stems formed at angles near 90 degrees. Limited plant sterility but growth stimulation and rather branched phenotypes were evident for s-HIMyb 3 transgenotes of P. hybrida and N. benthamiana. It was found that both HIMyb 3 transgenes interfere in the accumulation and composition of flavonol glycosides and phenolic acids in transformed plants.

Alpha-acid and beta-acid {{content of the}} cone, alpha:beta-acid ratio, total soft resin, and <b>lupulin</b> content of the cone {{were included in the}} chemical evaluation. Genetic variance, genetic coefficient of variation, broad sense heritability and expected gain were calculated for each of the traits. The degree of association between traits was determined on the basis of phenotypic, genotypic and environmental correlations. The phenotypic correlations were further analyzed by path coefficient analysis to determine the interrelationships of the traits. Highly significant differences among genotypes were shown for all characters measured. The genetic coefficients of variation, broad sense heritability, and expected gains indicated there was a large genetic potential for improvement of most traits studied. Vigor, flowering date, and harvest date appear to have the least genetic potential for improvement. Application of a five percent selection pressure should result in a 90 percent gain in number of cones per vine and yield, and a 70 percent gain in lateral length and cones per lateral. All agronomic characteristics other than cone weight were positively correlated with yield. Also, all possible combinations of harvest date, lateral length, nodes per lateral, cones per lateral, cones per vine, and yield had significant positive phenotypic correlations. With the exception of vigor, phenotypic correlations between agronomic characters and the quality traits, alpha-acid and betaacid content of the cone, were either significant in a positive direction or showed no relationship. Correlations between alpha-acid and beta-acid concentration tend to support the concept that the two compounds are genetically independent after their common biosynthetic pathways diverge. Path coefficient analyses of phenotypic correlation coefficients showed that lateral length and cones per vine have more of a direct and indirect effect on yield than does vigor, flowering date, harvest date, nodes per lateral, or cone weight. The results reported in this study are important to the hop breeder whose objective is to improve yield and quality. The results indicate: 1. There is a large genetic potential for improving most traits studied. 2. Associations between and among agronomic and quality traits show that selection can be practiced on either group separately without having a negative effect on the other. 3. Lateral length and cones per vine have a strong influence on yield. Improvement of these two traits provides a means for increasing yeild in early maturing cultivars...|$|E

First, hops was grown on the monastery grounds on a large scale. Czech, and thus Saaz hops, reached its peak in the 19 th century, mainly for its fragrance, color and kontent of <b>lupulin,</b> and became a {{benchmark}} for determining the quality and price of hops. Kazbek is the first variety of "flavour hops" bred in the Czech Republic. Its unique sensory properties were examined with numerous brewing tests in several breweries of different sizes. Breeding of "flavour hops" is a real challenge for hop breeders. The first hop in that category, for example Citra, Amarillo, Simcoe, Bravo, were bred in the United States. Variety Kazbek was obtained by selecting progeny of the hybrid material, which has origins in Russian wild hops. It was registered in 2008 due to high stability and efficiency. Robustness and stability is expressed {{in the name of the}} variety, because Kazbek is the highest mountain of the middle Caucasus. From the brewing point of view, it belongs among the bitter types. Saaz Late variety was obtained by selecting F 1 offspring of parental combination of unfinished breeding material that is the origin of Saaz. It has a charakter of late variety. Saaz Late is an aromatic variety for the second and third hopping. Aroma is genuine, fine, hoppy. The most important quality aspect of hops is alpha acids content. Content of alpha acids has been reagularly assessed since 1981. The evaluation results show, that the alpha acids kontent in varieties Saaz Late and Kazbek is proven statistically different. Selection of suitable location is the key element for cultivation of hybrid varieties. It is very important to focus on the evaluation of natural conditions of each location. This paper shows that there is no statistically significant difference between locations Stekník and Blšany. Optimal temperature for growth and subsequent yield formation should not drop below + 7 °C in April, + 11 °C in May and from June to August should range between + 15 and + 18 °C. The stability and balance of temperature is also important. Precipitation has a bigger 7 impact on yield formation than temperature. This statement was confirmed in 2015, when tropical temperatures and drought during the flowering and cone formation caused significant decrease of yield. Low yield leve...|$|E
