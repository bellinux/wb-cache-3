40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS—Lodoxamide {{tromethamine}} and N-acetyl-aspartyl {{glutamic acid}} (NAAGA) are mast cell stabilisers, {{both of which}} {{have been shown to be}} effective in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. The aim of this study was to compare the two compounds in patients with common ocular allergic disorders.  METHODS— 73 patients participated in a double masked, randomised multicentre study. Diagnoses were chronic allergic conjunctivitis, vernal conjunctivitis, seasonal and atopic conjunctivitis. 36  patients were treated with <b>lodoxamide</b> 0. 1 % and 37  with NAAGA 4. 9 %, the drops being instilled four times daily for up to 56  days.  RESULTS—The overall opinion of the physicians and the patients was in favour of <b>lodoxamide</b> at day 10  of the study. At this time, 86 % of <b>lodoxamide</b> treated and 49 % of NAAGA treated patients considered they had improved. The patients' opinion favoured <b>lodoxamide</b> at day 28  and both physicians' and patients' evaluations were in favour of <b>lodoxamide</b> at day 42.  Evaluation of signs and symptoms indicated superiority of <b>lodoxamide</b> at days 42  and 56.  Both treatments were well tolerated.  CONCLUSION—While both <b>lodoxamide</b> and NAAGA treatments are associated with clinical improvements in patients with allergic conjunctivitis, <b>lodoxamide</b> may have an earlier onset of action.    Keywords: allergic conjunctivitis; lodoxamide; NAAGA; topical therap...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>lodoxamide</b> tromethamine, a calcium antagonist, on {{intestinal}} fluid accumulation induced by Escherichia coli heat-stable (ST) and Vibrio cholerae (CT) enterotoxins in infant mice was investigated. The simultaneous administration of <b>lodoxamide</b> with ST or CT enterotoxin {{resulted in a}} significant (P less than 0. 01) inhibition of the intestinal fluid response. A minimum concentration of 10 (- 7) or 10 (- 8) M <b>lodoxamide</b> caused an inhibition (P less than 0. 01) of the ST- or CT-mediated fluid response, respectively. Treatment of infant mice with buffer or drug alone {{did not result in}} fluid accumulation. A significant inhibition of ST and CT enterotoxic activities was also observed when <b>lodoxamide</b> was administered 30 min before (P less than 0. 02) or 30 min after (P less than 0. 01) toxin challenge. These data suggest that calcium may be important in the ST- or CT-mediated induction of fluid accumulation.

40|$|Lack of high potency {{agonists}} has restricted {{analysis of}} the G protein–coupled receptor GPR 35. Moreover, marked variation in potency and/or affinity of current ligands between human and rodent orthologs of GPR 35 has limited their productive use in rodent models of physiology. Based on the reported modest potency of the antiasthma and antiallergic ligands cromolyn disodium and nedocromil sodium, we identified the related compounds <b>lodoxamide</b> and bufrolin as high potency agonists of human GPR 35. Unlike previously identified high potency agonists that are highly selective for human GPR 35, both <b>lodoxamide</b> and bufrolin displayed equivalent potency at rat GPR 35. Further synthetic antiallergic ligands, either sharing features of the standard surrogate agonist zaprinast, or with <b>lodoxamide</b> and bufrolin, were also shown to display agonism at either human or rat GPR 35. Because both <b>lodoxamide</b> and bufrolin are symmetric di-acids, their potential mode of binding was explored via mutagenesis based on swapping between the rat and human ortholog nonconserved arginine residues within proximity of a key conserved arginine at position 3. 36. Computational modeling and ligand docking predicted the contributions of different arginine residues, other than at 3. 36, in human GPR 35 for these two ligands and were consistent with selective loss of potency of either bufrolin or <b>lodoxamide</b> at distinct arginine mutants. The computational models also suggested that bufrolin and <b>lodoxamide</b> would display reduced potency at a low-frequency human GPR 35 single nucleotide polymorphism.

40|$|AbstractObjective: Research in lung {{transplant}} preservation {{has generally}} focused on free radicals and enzyme release from neutrophils, parenchymal cells, macrophages, and endothelium. The lung {{has a large}} resident population of mast cells that, when activated, release potent inflammatory mediators. We hypothesized that adding an inhibitor of mast cell degranulation, <b>lodoxamide</b> tromethamine (10 μmol/L), to Euro-Collins and University of Wisconsin preservation solutions, would decrease lung preservation injury. Methods: Rat lungs were isolated, flushed with the respective solution, and stored at 4 ° C for 6 or 12 hours. The lungs were reperfused with fresh blood and ventilated with 100 % oxygen. Alveolar-arterial oxygen difference, oxygen tension, capillary filtration coefficient, and compliance were determined. Results: After 6 hours of ischemic storage: <b>lodoxamide</b> tromethamine–enhanced Euro-Collins solution decreased alveolar-arterial oxygen difference from 539 to 457 (p  = 0. 004), increased oxygen tension from 119 to 205 mm Hg (p = 0. 006), and decreased capillary filtration coefficient from 3. 9 to 2. 0 (p < 0. 001); <b>lodoxamide</b> tromethamine–enhanced University of Wisconsin solution decreased alveolar-arterial oxygen difference from 546 to 317 (p  < 0. 001), increased oxygen tension from 166 to 335 mm Hg (p < 0. 001), and decreased capillary filtration coefficient from 3. 0 to 1. 7 (p < 0. 001). After 12 hours of ischemic storage, <b>lodoxamide</b> tromethamine–enhanced Euro-Collins solution decreased alveolar-arterial oxygen difference from 588 to 485 (p < 0. 001), increased oxygen tension from 100 to 161 mm Hg (p = 0. 012), decreased capillary filtration coefficient from 6. 2 to 2. 6 (p < 0. 001), and increased compliance from 0. 12 to 0. 21 (p < 0. 001); <b>lodoxamide</b> tromethamine–enhanced University of Wisconsin solution decreased alveolar-arterial oxygen difference from 478 to 322 (p < 0. 001), increased oxygen tension from 214 to 335 mm Hg (p < 0. 001), decreased capillary filtration constant from 4. 2 to 2. 0 (p < 0. 001), and increased compliance from 0. 20 to 0. 25 (p < 0. 001). Conclusions: Addition of <b>lodoxamide</b> tromethamine to Euro-Collins or University of Wisconsin solution results in a marked decrease in lung reperfusion injury as demonstrated by increased oxygenation, decreased microvascular permeability, and increased compliance.

40|$|These {{studies were}} {{designed}} to assess pathophysiologic factors responsible for increased vascular permeability occurring in rat skin that has been thermally injured in vivo. Under the conditions employed, permeability changes and edema formation progressed over time, with peak changes occurring 60 minutes after thermal trauma. The plasma of thermally injured rats showed dramatic increases in levels of xanthine oxidase activity, with peak values appearing as early as 15 minutes after thermal trauma. Excision of the burned skin immediately after thermal injury significantly diminished the increase in plasma xanthine oxidase activity. The skin permeability changes were attenuated by treatment of animals with antioxidants (catalase, superoxide dismutase [SOD], dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO], dimethylthiourea [DMTU]) or an iron chelator (deferoxamine), supporting the role of oxygen radicals {{in the development of}} vascular injury as defined by greatly increased vascular permeability. Studies employing laser Doppler velocimetry in thermally injured skin revealed a pronounced and sustained decrease in blood flow after thermal trauma, a pattern not affected by protective interventions. The failure of neutrophil depletion to protect against the vascular permeability changes and the protective effects of the xanthine oxidase inhibitors (allopurinol and <b>lodoxamide</b> tromethamine) suggest that xanthine oxidase is the most likely source of the oxygen radicals involved in edema formation. <b>Lodoxamide</b> was found to have some hydroxyl radical (HO.) scavenging ability (greater than that of allopurinol) but no iron chelating activity. Some of the protective effects of <b>lodoxamide</b> and allopurinol may be linked to their HO. scavenging ability.

Thirty pairs of lungs were perfused with colloid for up to 6 h, during which pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and capillary pressure (PCP) were measured frequently, and time to gain 5 g in weight (t 5) was recorded. Four protocols with different perfusate additives were studied: (i) none (control, n = 11); (ii) 10 mmol NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (n = 6); (iii) 10 mmol L-NAME with 100 mumol <b>lodoxamide,</b> an inhibitor of mast cell degranulation (n = 7); (iv) 10 mmol L-NAME with 10 mumol 8 -bromo- 3 ', 5 '-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (8 Br-cGMP), an analogue of cGMP that may reduce vascular permeability by relaxing contractile elements in endothelial cells (n = 6).

40|$|Having {{identified}} renin in cardiac mast cells, {{we assessed}} whether its release leads to cardiac dysfunction. In Langendorff-perfused guinea pig hearts, mast cell degranulation with compound 48 / 80 released Ang I–forming activity. This activity {{was blocked by}} the selective renin inhibitor BILA 2157, indicating that renin was responsible for Ang I formation. Local generation of cardiac Ang II from mast cell–derived renin also elicited norepinephrine release from isolated sympathetic nerve terminals. This action was mediated by Ang II-type 1 (AT 1) receptors. In 2 models of ischemia/reperfusion using Langendorff-perfused guinea pig and mouse hearts, a significant coronary spillover of renin and norepinephrine was observed. In both models, this was accompanied by ventricular fibrillation. Mast cell stabilization with cromolyn or <b>lodoxamide</b> markedly reduced active renin overflow and attenuated both norepinephrine release and arrhythmias. Similar cardioprotection was observed in guinea pig hearts treated with BILA 2157 or the AT 1 receptor antagonist EXP 3174. Renin overflow and arrhythmias in ischemia/reperfusion were much less prominent in hearts of mast cell–deficient mice than in control hearts. Thus, mast cell–derived renin is pivotal for activating a cardiac renin-angiotensin system leading to excessive norepinephrine release in ischemia/reperfusion. Mast cell–derived renin may be a useful therapeutic target for hyperadrenergic dysfunctions, such as arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death, myocardial ischemia, and congestive heart failure...|$|E

Intravital video microscopy {{was used to}} define the mechanisms that underlie the inflammatory reactions elicited by direct exposure of the microvasculature to Tx-A. Leukocyte adherence and emigration, leukocyte-platelet aggregation, and extravasation of FITC-albumin were monitored in rat mesenteric venules exposed to Tx-A. Significant increases in leukocyte adherence and emigration (LAE) and albumin leakage were noted within 15 - 30 min of Tx-A exposure. These responses were accompanied by mast cell degranulation {{and the formation of}} platelet-leukocyte aggregates. The Tx-A-induced increases in LAE and albumin leakage were significantly attenuated by pretreatment with either monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against the leukocyte adhesion glycoproteins, CD 11 /CD 18, intercellular adhesion molecule- 1, and P-selectin (but not E-selectin) or with sialyl Lewis x, a counter-receptor for P-selectin. The mast cell stabilizer, <b>lodoxamide,</b> an H 1 - (but not an H 2 -) receptor antagonist, and diamine oxidase (histaminase) were also effective in reducing the LAE and albumin leakage elicited by Tx-A.

The exacerbated response in W/Wv mice was greatly attenuated by pretreatment with either dexamethasone (1. 3 -fold) or the selective inducible NOS inhibitor, aminoguanidine (1. 4 -fold), and partially attenuated by the mast cell stabiliser, <b>lodoxamide</b> (2. 9 -fold). Jejunal inducible NOS activity was significantly higher in W/WV than in +/+ mice, while jejunal MPO was lower in W/WV mice than in +/+ mice, suggesting that the higher inducible NOS in W/WV does not result from the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the gut. The higher inducible NOS activity in the jejunum of W/WV was significantly reduced by dexamethasone treatment.  Conclusions—Our results suggest that mast cells normally serve to inhibit inducible NOS activity tonically in the gut and that inhibitors of NOS elicit a larger permeability response when this tonic inhibitory influence is released by mast cell depletion. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} the {{anti-allergic}} drugs, sodium cromoglycate (SCG), <b>lodoxamide,</b> traxanox, RU 31156 and the beta-adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol to inhibit IgE-dependent histamine and prostaglandin D 2 (PGD 2) release was assessed using human dispersed lung mast cells. The anti-allergic drugs were weak inhibitors of histamine release, high concentrations (100 - 1000 microM) producing less than 35 % inhibition. Salbutamol produced 39 % inhibition at 10 microM. The efficacy of both SCG and salbutamol was inversely related to the concentration of anti-IgE used for challenge and {{to the degree of}} histamine release. Rapid tachyphylaxis was observed with all anti-allergic drugs but not with salbutamol. Cross-tachyphylaxis was observed between SCG and the other anti-allergic drugs, suggesting a common mechanism of action. No cross-tachyphylaxis was observed between SCG and salbutamol. SCG was significantly (P less than 0. 001) more effective in inhibiting PGD 2 than it was histamine release. Preferential inhibition of PGD 2 compared with histamine release was less marked (P less than 0. 05) with salbutamol and not significant with the other anti-allergic drugs. Mast cells dispersed by enzymatic digestion of human lung released more histamine on immunological challenge than mechanically dispersed cells obtained by fine chopping of tissue. Enzyme treatment of mechanically dispersed cells removed this difference. Enzymatically and mechanically dispersed cells responded similarly to the inhibitory effects of SCG and salbutamol. Our results suggest that salbutamol is a more effective inhibitor of mediator release from human lung mast cells than anti-allergic drugs. However, with the low levels of mediator release achieved during an allergic reaction in man in vivo, both salbutamol and SCG are likely to be effective inhibitors of both preformed and newly generated mediators...|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} that endothelial cell-derived oxidants {{could contribute to}} neutrophil-mediated endothelial cell injury and cytotoxicity has been a subject of speculation. Rat pulmonary artery endothelial cells (RPAECs) were examined {{for the presence of}} xanthine oxidase (XO) activity, a well-known source of O 2 -. Using a sensitive assay based on measurements of radioactive xanthine conversion to uric acid by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), RPAEC extracts were found to contain both XO and xanthine dehydrogenase (XD) activities. Extracts from early passage cells have 55. 3 +/- 11. 7 (mean +/- SE) units/ 10 (6) cells of total (XO + XD) activity, one unit of activity being defined as the conversion of 1 % of substrate to product in 30 minutes of incubation. XO comprised 31. 6 +/- 3. 1 % of this total activity. Addition of human neutrophils stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) caused a rapid and dose-dependent increase in RPAEC XO activity from 31. 6 +/- 3. 1 % to 71. 7 +/- 4. 8 % of total without altering total (XO + XD) activity. The neutrophil dose-response curve for increase in XO paralleled closely the curve for neutrophil-mediated RPAEC cytotoxicity. The basal XO and XD activities and the neutrophil-induced increase in XO activity were inhibited by treating RPAECs with allopurinol, oxypurinol, and <b>lodoxamide,</b> which also inhibited cytotoxicity, but not by catalase, superoxide dismutase, or deferoxamine. Addition of H 2 O 2 failed to cause an increase in RPAEC XO activity or XD to XO conversion. The results suggest that during neutrophil-mediated injury, rapid conversion of RPAEC XD to XO occurs, resulting in increased XO, catalyzed endogenous oxidant production, which may contribute to the oxidant burden in the killing mechanism initiated by activated neutrophils. Although the mechanism for conversion of XD to XO is uncertain, it appears that neutrophil-derived H 2 O 2 is not sufficient to cause this phenomenon. Furthermore, neither O 2 - nor chelatable iron is required for neutrophil-induced XD to XO conversion. Supernatant fluids from activated neutrophils failed to induce XD to XO conversion in RPAECs. This in vitro system provides an opportunity to define the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the in vivo phenomenon of XD to XO conversion associated with ischemic/reperfusion or inflammatory tissue injury...|$|E
40|$|G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are seven-pass {{integral}} membrane {{proteins that}} act as transducers of extracellular signals across the lipid bilayer. Their location and involvement in basic and pathological physiological processes has secured their role as key targets for pharmaceutical intervention. GPCRs are targeted {{by many of the}} best-selling drugs on the market and there are a substantial number of GPCRs that are yet to be characterised; these could offer interest for therapeutic targeting. GPR 35 is one such receptor that, as a result of gene knockout and genome wide association studies, has attracted interest through its association with cardiovascular and gastrointestinal disease. Elucidation of the basic physiological function of GPR 35 has, however, been difficult due a paucity of potent and selective ligands in addition to a lack of consensus on the endogenous ligand. Herein, a focussed drug discovery effort was carried out to identify agonists of GPR 35. Various in vitro cellular assays were employed in conjunction with N- or C-terminally manipulated forms of the receptor to investigate GPR 35 ’s signalling profile and to provide an assay format suitable for the characterisation of newly identified ligands. Although GPR 35 associates with both Gαi/o and Gα 13 families of small heterotrimeric G proteins, the G protein-independent β-arrestin- 2 recruitment format was found to be the most suited to drug screening efforts. Small molecule compound screening, carried out in conjunction with the Medical Research Council Technology, identified compound 1 as the most potent ligand of human GPR 35 reported at that time. However, the lower efficacy and potency of compound 1 at the rodent species orthologues of GPR 35 prevented its use in in vivo studies. A subsequent effort, carried out with Novartis, focused on mast cell stabilisers as putative agonists of GPR 35, revealed <b>lodoxamide</b> and bufrolin as highly potent agonists that activated human and rat GPR 35 with equal potency. This finding offered–for the first time–the opportunity to employ the same GPR 35 ligand between species at a similar concentration, an important factor to consider when translating rodent in vivo functional studies to those in man. Additionally, using molecular modelling and site directed mutagenesis studies, these newly identified compounds were used to aid characterisation of the ligand binding pockets of human and rat GPR 35 to reveal the molecular basis of species selectivity at this receptor. In summary, this research effort presents GPR 35 tool compounds that can now be used to dissect the basic biology of GPR 35 and investigate its contribution to disease...|$|E
40|$|Background and aim: The {{cause of}} {{ulcerative}} colitis (UC) is largely unknown. However, {{there is a}} presumed genetic component to susceptibility and altered intestinal barrier function has been implicated in the pathophysiology of ulcerative colitis. There {{is evidence that the}} increased intestinal permeability in IBD is partly controlled by delicate intercellular circuits in the colonic tissue linked to the enteric nervous system. Little is, however, known about how this is regulated in detail. Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is a good surgical reconstructive option in UC patients after proctocolectomy. However 10 - 15 % of IPAA patients develop a severe and recurrent inflammation in the constructed pouch. The standard treatment for pouchitis is long and/or frequent use of antibiotics. Probiotics have been shown {{to reduce the risk of}} recurrence of pouchitis after induction treatment with antibiotics. The aim was to characterize macromolecular permeability in non inflamed colon of UC and elucidate the role of cholinergic signaling, mast cells and eosinophils in the regulation of the human colonic permeability. Furthermore, we examine the mucosal barrier function in relation to pouchitis, before and after treatment with probiotics. Material and methods: In the first study 23 UC patients in remission and 53 healthy volunteers were included. Biopsies from the sigmoid colon were assed for macromolecular permeability (horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and 51 CrEDTA) and electrophysiology during challenge with carbachol. Experiments were repeated with CRF receptor antagonists, carbachol receptor antagonists and mast cell stabilizers in Ussing chambers. Further, pouch biopsies from 16 IPAA patients with pouchitis and 13 IPAA controls were assed in Ussing chambers for macromolecular permeability and electrophysiology as above. In addition E. coli K 12 were used to assess the barrier to bacteria. Biopsies were taken on three occasions; before treatment, after antibiotics and after probiotics. Pouchitis Disease Activity Index (PDAI) was used in all subjects. Results: Colonic tissues from UC patients had significant increase in permeability to protein antigens compared with controls. Permeability was normalized by atropine, α-helical CRF(9 - 41) and <b>lodoxamide.</b> Eosinophils were increased in number in UC tissues, expressed M 2 and M 3 muscarinic receptors and showed immunoreactivity to CRF. In pouchitis patients,  PDAI was significantly improved after treatment with antibiotics and probiotics. There was a significantly enhanced passage of E. coli K 12 and HRP in patients with active pouchitis, which was unchanged during treatment with antibiotics, but significantly normalized by probiotics. Conclusions and discussion: We identified a neuroimmune intercellular circuit (from cholinergic nerves, via eosinophils to mast cells) that mediates colonic mucosal barrier dysfunction in UC patients. Furthermore we found that probiotics restored the increased permeation to E. coli and HRP in patients with pouchitis. Pouchitis, resembling symptoms in active UC, may well constitute a good model to study acquired intestinal barrier dysfunction in IBD...|$|E
