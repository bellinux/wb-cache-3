Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz, said that the payments were [...] "a completely unacceptable use of taxpayer dollars that should instead go to providing care for veterans." [...] Dr. Sam Foote said that the firing was [...] "a good first step" [...] and that [...] "I think there are a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>others</b> who need to follow her out the door." ...|$|E
500|$|Though Sakic {{was a quiet}} individual, he {{was able}} to motivate his team to play at higher levels, which earned him the respect of his peers and executives. The first signs of Sakic's {{leadership}} began to show while still a member of the Swift Current Broncos of the WHL. After the bus crash that killed four of his teammates, Sakic was seen {{as the leader of the}} team, acknowledging that the experience changed his outlook on life. Early in his career with the Nordiques (when Mike Hough was still captain), with the team hoping to rebuild around their top draft pick Eric Lindros, and holding onto Lindros' rights for the season when he refused to sign, Sakic suggested that the team could progress without Lindros, saying, [...] "We only want players here who have the passion to play the game. I'm tired of hearing that name. He's not here and there are a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>others</b> in this locker room who really care about the game." [...] Lindros was traded a year later, bringing in a number of quality players, which vastly improved the Nordiques. Sakic's leadership qualities led him to be courted by other teams, such as in the summer of 1997, when the New York Rangers offered him a large contract in order to replace departed captain Mark Messier, though the Avalanche ultimately matched the offer and retained Sakic.|$|E
500|$|In 1989–90, {{his second}} NHL season, Sakic {{was able to}} switch his number back to his {{familiar}} #19 (Alain Côté had retired over the summer), and scored 102 points, which was ninth overall in the league. At {{the start of the}} next season, 1990–91, he was named co-captain along with Steven Finn (Sakic was captain for home games, Finn for away games) and again passed the 100 point mark, improving to 109 points and sixth overall in the league, but would slip during 1991–92 to 94 points, having missed 11 games. Early on in the season, Sakic showed some of his leadership qualities, even while Mike Hough was serving as captain, as he stood firm in the Eric Lindros holdout issue. With Lindros holding out against the Nordiques, who were one of the worst teams in league, Sakic commented, [...] "We only want players here who have the passion to play the game. I'm tired of hearing that name. He's not here and there are a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>others</b> in this locker room who really care about the game." [...] Lindros was traded a year later, ending the situation and bringing in a number of quality players, which vastly improved the Nordiques. During their first four seasons with Joe Sakic, the Nordiques finished last place in the Adams Division and last in the entire league for three straight years, from 1989 to 1991.|$|E

2500|$|He won his Yorkshire cap in 1970, but {{was twice}} forced to remodel his off-break bowling action {{after he was}} {{suspended}} in 1972, and again in 1978. [...] "It was a bad time because you were never allowed to defend yourself," [...] said Cope. [...] "A committee met and made a decision, which was then passed on down the lines. You didn’t know who was on that committee or what they thought. But Dickie Bird {{and a lot of}} other people have said, 'Geoff, there's nothing wrong; if you were guilty, then an awful <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>others</b> were.' I think that's a fair comment; it was just one of those periods." [...] Cricket writer, Colin Bateman, noted that [...] "Geoff Cope's career was blighted by suspicions that his off-spinner's action was illegal and twice – in 1972 and 1978 – he was suspended by Lord's. The second suspension came after he had broken through into the Test side the previous winter in Pakistan, where he came tantalisingly close to a debut hat-trick".|$|E

There are breaches in the walls that you could throw a cat through. The bedrooms have no locks on the doors, no furniture but a single chair in each, and a bedstead without bedding--just a mattress. Even these meager accommodations you cannot be sure that you will have in monopoly; you must take your chance of being stowed in with a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>others.</b> Sir, it is a most abominable hotel.|$|E

There he sat, however, very busy and supremely happy in the smith's kitchen, with a pipe in his mouth and a bottle of wine before him. The old smith sat opposite to him, while the two young men stood among a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>others</b> round the little table, and Annot bustled {{in and out of the}} room, now going close enough up to her lover to enable him to pinch her elbow unseen by her father, and then leaning against the dresser, and listening to his military eloquence.|$|E
