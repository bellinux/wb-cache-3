40|$|Abstract. Cone-beam {{computed}} tomography (CBCT) {{is an important}} image modality <b>for</b> <b>dental</b> <b>surgery</b> planning, with high resolution images at a relative low radiation dose. In these scans the mandibular canal is hardly visible, {{this is a problem}} for implant surgery planning. We use anisotropic diffusion filtering to remove noise and enhance the mandibu-lar canal in CBCT scans. For the diffusion tensor we use hybrid diffusion with a continuous switch (HDCS), suitable for filtering both tubular as planar image structures. We focus in this paper on the diffusion dis-cretization schemes. The standard scheme shows good isotropic filtering behavior but is not rotational invariant, the diffusion scheme of Weick-ert is rotational invariant but suffers from checkerboard artifacts. We introduce a new scheme, in which we numerically optimize the image derivatives. This scheme is rotational invariant and shows good isotropic filtering properties on both synthetic as real CBCT data. ...|$|R

The first 2 assessments measured overall levels of patient anxiety and pain and confirmed that nitrous oxide sedation reduced anxiety without changing already low levels of pain.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness and safety of oral midazolam in children undergoing <b>dental</b> <b>surgery.</b> Materials and methods: A prospective, randomized, controlled trial was conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of midazolam in children. Patients aged 2 – 9 years who underwent <b>dental</b> <b>surgery</b> under general anesthesia were randomly allocated into one of the four groups: midazolam 0. 2  mg/kg dose group (n =  30); midazolam 0. 21 – 0. 4  mg/kg dose group (n =  15); midazolam more than 0. 41  mg/kg dose group (n =  15) or the placebo group (n =  31). The effectiveness of midazolam on sedation was assessed by the evaluation of vital signs, such as the respiratory and heart rate, oxygen saturation and the patients’ reactive behaviors, in comparison with the placebo. Results: The scores of the ratings for sleep, movement and crying, as well as patients’ reactions at the moment of separation from their parents and their collaboration with the staff were statistically significantly better among patients who received oral midazolam compared with the placebo. There were statistically significant direct correlations between the doses of midazolam and higher sleep, movement, crying and reaction scores 30  min after premedication as well as higher scores of patients upon separation from their parents.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, the 3 D-morphology of the {{porosity}} in dentin is investigated {{within the}} first 350 μm from the dentin-enamel junction (DEJ) by fluorescence confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). We found that the porous microstructure exhibits a much more complex geometry than classically described, which may impact our fundamental understanding of the mechanical behavior of teeth and could have practical consequences <b>for</b> <b>dental</b> <b>surgery.</b> Our 3 D observations reveal numerous fine branches stemming from the tubules which {{may play a role}} in cellular communication or mechanosensing during the early stages of dentinogenesis. The effect of this highly branched microstructure on the local mechanical properties is investigated by means of numerical simulations. Under simplified assumptions on the surrounding tissue characteristics, we find that the presence of fine branches negatively affects the mechanical properties by creating local stress concentrations. However, this effect is reduced by the presence of peritubular dentin surrounding the tubules. The porosity was also quantified using the CSLM data and compared to this derived from SEM imaging. A bimodal distribution of channel diameters was found near the DEJ with a mean value of 1. 5 - 2 μm for the tubules and 0. 3 - 0. 5 μm for the fine branches which contribute to 30 % of the total porosity (∼ 1. 2 %). A gradient in the branching density was observed from the DEJ towards the pulp, independently of the anatomical location. Our work constitutes an incentive towards more elaborate multiscale studies of dentin microstructure to better assess the effect of aging and for the design of biomaterials used in dentistry, e. g. to ensure more efficient bonding to dentin. Finally, our analysis of the tubular network structure provides valuable data to improve current numerical models. Statement of significanceThis paper provides an unprecedented 3 D view of the structural complexity of the porous structure of teeth at the dentin-enamel junction. This could improve our understanding of the biomechanical function of teeth which may, in turn, provide valuable information <b>for</b> <b>dental</b> <b>surgery</b> as this porous network forms the anchorage substrate <b>for</b> <b>dental</b> restorations. Current research on this matter has been hindered by the need to visualize structural details with very high spatial resolution, which is generally achieved using highly sophisticated instruments.

Because of the widespread availability of such instruments, further investigations on this matter could be envisaged at very moderate costs...|$|R

40|$|Objective. Surgery is {{the main}} oral {{healthcare}} hazard to the patient with a bleeding tendency, which is mostly caused {{by the use of}} anticoagulants. The traditional management entails the interruption of anticoagulant therapy <b>for</b> <b>dental</b> <b>surgery</b> to prevent hemorrhage. However, this practice may increase the risk of a potentially life-threatening thromboembolism. Because this issue is still controversial, it is the aim of this paper to review the evidence, to highlight the areas of major concern, and to suggest management regimens for patients on the 3 main types of anticoagulants: coumarins, heparins, and aspirin. Materials reviewed. The pertinent literature and clinical protocols of hospital dentistry departments have been extensively reviewed and discussed. Results. Several evolving clinical practices in the last years have been detected: anticoagulant use is generally not discontinued; oral surgery is performed despite laboratory values showing significant bleeding tendency; new effective local methods are used to prevent bleeding; and patients at risk are referred to hospital-based clinics. Conclusion. The management of oral surgery procedures on patients treated with anticoagulants should be influenced by several factors: extent and urgency of surgery, laboratory values, treating physician’s recommendation, available facilities, dentist expertise, and patient’s oral, medical, and general condition...|$|R

Third molar {{extraction}} under {{regional anaesthesia}} (inferior alveolar and buccal nerve blocks), {{two groups of}} 30 patients each, group 1 = control, group 2 = EDA treatment. Anxiety and pain level were reported by means of Visual Analogue Scale, postoperative pain description with the McGill Pain Questionnaire. Postoperative telephonic interview to all patients. Computerized randomization, values expressed as mean±SD, data comparison evaluated by means of ANOVA and χ 2, statistical significance indicated by P values < 0. 05. Results. Features of the patients and surgical interventions were similar. EDA has determined lower pain level, moreover patients {{in the control group}} showed higher values of blood pressure and heart frequency. Telephonic interview not reported amnesia of the perioperative events. A smaller number of EDA treated patients reported pain during needle prick and /or intraoperatively. 80 % of the EDA treated patients liked the treatment and 93 % of the patients would repeat the treatment, if needed. Conclusions. EDA is a complementary analgesic technique <b>for</b> <b>dental</b> <b>surgery.</b> Cardiovascular changes, frequently observed during third molar extraction, were not present in the EDA treated patients. This confirms that EDA is able to modify the physiologic responses to stressful events, blunting the adrenergic upset, maybe by means of an analgesic action on Aβ fiber and an increase of endorphins central level.
