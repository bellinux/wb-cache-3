5|$|Murray cod {{continue}} a pattern present in Murray-Darling native fish genera of speciation into <b>lowland</b> and specialist upland species: Murray cod are the primarily <b>lowland</b> species and the endangered trout cod are the specialist upland species. The pattern is slightly blurred in the cod species because, being adaptable and successful fish, Murray cod push significant distances into upland habitats, while the now endangered trout cod stray (or did stray, before their decline) well down the upland/lowland transition zone, {{which can be}} extensive in Murray-Darling Rivers. Nevertheless, the basic pattern of speciation into a primarily <b>lowland</b> species and a specialist upland species is present.|$|E
5|$|Nearby is the Dunster Park and Heathlands Site of Special Scientific Interest {{noted for}} nationally {{important}} <b>lowland</b> dry heath, dry <b>lowland</b> acid grassland, wood-pasture with veteran trees and ancient semi-natural oak woodland habitats. The fauna of the <b>lowland</b> heath includes the heath fritillary (Mellicta athalia), a nationally rare butterfly. The assemblage of beetles {{associated with the}} veteran trees is of national significance because of the variety and abundance of species.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{communities}} have been classified into nine categories: <b>lowland</b> subtropical rainforest, submontane rainforest, cloud-forest and scrub, <b>lowland</b> swamp forest, mangrove scrub and seagrass, coastal scrub and cliff vegetation, inland scrub and herbland, offshore island vegetation, shoreline and beach vegetation, and disturbed vegetation.|$|E
25|$|Several {{distinct}} sub-regions within Mesoamerica {{are defined}} by a convergence of geographic and cultural attributes. These sub-regions are more conceptual than culturally meaningful, and the demarcation of their limits is not rigid. The Maya area, for example, {{can be divided into}} two general groups: the <b>lowlands</b> and highlands. The <b>lowlands</b> are further divided into the southern and northern Maya <b>lowlands.</b> The southern Maya <b>lowlands</b> are generally regarded as encompassing northern Guatemala, southern Campeche and Quintana Roo in Mexico, and Belize. The northern <b>lowlands</b> cover the remainder of the northern portion of the Yucatán Peninsula. Other areas include Central Mexico, West Mexico, the Gulf Coast <b>Lowlands,</b> Oaxaca, the Southern Pacific <b>Lowlands,</b> and Southeast Mesoamerica (including northern Honduras).|$|R

There is also a recent unconfirmed report from Cambodia. Their large ranges and presumed high numbers mean that none of the crag martins are considered to be threatened, and all are classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E

5|$|Although {{it gained}} recruits, the rising began {{to suffer from}} {{internal}} divisions, particularly between the Highlanders who made {{up the bulk of}} the forces and the <b>Lowland</b> nobles and officers who were their commanders. In early 1654, nine months into the revolt, Middleton, a <b>Lowland</b> officer and a veteran of the Battle of Worcester, arrived with a commission to command from Charles II. Despite objections from his followers, Glencairn surrendered control over his forces, which had now reached 3,500 foot and 1,500 horse. That evening Sir George Munro, Middleton's aide insulted Glencairn's forces and the result was a duel in which Munro was wounded. Glencairn was arrested. He would eventually be released and retire from the conflict. A series of other disputes and duels undermined the leadership of the campaign {{for the remainder of the}} rising.|$|E
5|$|Antoninus Pius soon {{reversed}} the containment policy {{of his predecessor}} Hadrian, and Urbicus was ordered to begin the reconquest of <b>Lowland</b> Scotland by moving north. Between 139 and 140 he rebuilt a fort at Corbridge and by 142 or 143, commemorative coins were issued celebrating a victory in Britain. It is therefore likely that Urbicus led the reoccupation of southern Scotland , probably using the 2nd Augustan Legion. He evidently campaigned against several British tribes (possibly including factions of the northern Brigantes), certainly against the <b>lowland</b> tribes of Scotland, the Votadini and Selgovae of the Scottish Borders region, and the Damnonii of Strathclyde. His total force may have been about 16,500 men.|$|E

The 75th Division proceeded to attack Mesmiye on a lower and southward extension of the ridge on which Qatra and el Mughar were situated with the 52nd (<b>Lowland)</b> Division attacking directly towards these two villages.
