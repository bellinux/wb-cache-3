25|$|Berlioz was {{especially}} taken with Shakespeare's ability {{to pinpoint the}} heart of a dramatic conflict and penetrating the secrets of intense <b>love.</b> <b>These</b> secrets, Berlioz suggested in the text of Roméo et Juliette the playwright took with him to heaven. Time and again through the years, Berlioz would distill the favorite image of a play and distill it into musical terms. Roméo et Juliette may have been the first. Later came The Tempest, King Lear, a funeral march for the final scene in Hamlet, the love scene for Les Troyens (which, some claim, Berlioz took from The Merchant of Venice), and Béatrice and Benedict.|$|E
25|$|The poems used in most Kurdish {{music are}} filled with stories of romance and unrequited <b>love.</b> <b>These</b> poems have often two verses, which are divided in ten, eleven, or twelve syllables, and {{are based on the}} Gathas of the Zoroastrians. Kurdish melodies are very simple; their range is usually {{confined}} to a few notes. The form of the music is often strophic, and every gourani has a particular melody that is sung with various stanzas. At the end of every stanza the strophe is repeated unchanged throughout the song. Every gourani is characterized by a specific strophe. Similar to a lied or a chanson, gouranis may be accompanied by instrumental sections, which have three parts: prelude, middle section, and the ending. The prelude and the ending are performed by the group, and the middle section is performed in the form of call and response.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} half of the 1990s, Mochizuki {{directed}} a series of yakuza movies that are considered his best work. Some of the films were a collaboration with novelist Yukio Yamanouchi who had once been a legal advisor to one of the yakuza syndicates. The first of the films, Another Lonely Hitman, about an old-time yakuza hitman who ends up battling his own gang, was released in 1995. The movie took the Best Film award at the 5th Japan Film Professional Awards and Mochizuki won the Best Director award. What critics consider his best film appeared in 1997, Onibi or The Fire Within, another study of an aging yakuza trying to go straight. Onibi won the Best Film award at the 19th Yokohama Film Festival and Mochizuki took the festival's Best Director award for this movie and his other 1997 film A Yakuza in <b>Love.</b> <b>These</b> were followed by the 1998 manga-based Mobster's Confession, a comical, cynical account of a small-time gangster and his girlfriend. By this time, Mochizuki had begun to attain an international reputation and the Rotterdam Film Festival held a ten-film retrospective on the director in 1998.|$|E

[...] However, Williams suggested that the exiles give the natives a gratuity in the form of tools, coats and wampum. [...] On 24 March 1638 Williams drew up the deed granting Aquidneck Island to the settlers. [...] The deed was signed [...] "at Narragansett" [...] (likely Providence) by the sachems Canonicus and Miantonomi, with Williams and Randall Holden being the witnesses. [...] The names of many of the exiles were included on the deed; Coddington's name appeared first because he was responsible for the gratuity.|$|E
500|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Good Hit" [...] begins with Lopez holding a pointer {{in her left}} hand, while asking for the {{attention}} of the students. Two chalk boards are shown behind her, saying the words [...] "Fierceology" [...] and [...] "Work It Out 101". Lopez is then seen dancing on chairs with several female students, each with a hair dryer in hand. These scenes are intercut with Lopez teaching the students how to whip their hair. They then strut up and down a hallway. The music video was noted for its sex appeal, in which Lopez and the students are dressed in Dolce & Gabbana. An alternate version of the video was leaked online in December 2011. This version begins with Lopez posing in front of a mirror, draped in jewelry and sitting on a couch with a telephone. This footage is taken from a behind the scenes look at the photoshoot for <b>Love?.</b> <b>These</b> scenes are intercut with that from the original version.|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. Ology (website)'s Josh Harrison gave it an {{eight out of}} ten rating, writing that [...] "You gotta <b>love</b> <b>these</b> Simpsons episodes that really get {{into the heart of}} a subculture. Diving head-first into the world of foodies and food blogging (after a hilarious geeky pit-stop at a video game expo), 'The Food Wife' shish-kabobs gourmet diehards while highlighting a very real problem between Homer and Marge." [...] He concluded that the episode is [...] "a definite swing for the fences, and I think it hits its mark completely." [...] The scenes at the video game convention were praised by Anthony Severino of Game Revolution as well. He commented that the writers [...] "nailed it. Everything from the massive displays, long lines, and even the look of the Los Angeles Convention Center was spot on. The best was how they portrayed people with 'VIP passes', you know those things that we journalists get, as douches who think they're better than the regulars." ...|$|E
500|$|You {{know how}} many verses I did for that song. I did a version of that before her album [...] even came out. I did two verses. I <b>love</b> <b>these</b> verses too, but they ended up going with André's verse and André killed it. [...] Then [...] reached out to me and {{she wanted me to}} get on the remix. I did two more verses. Out of the second set that I did, she picked the first verse. But my second verse, I just gotta say for the record… It was just too long, I think she was looking for {{something}} shorter and more to the point. [...] It's just a blessing to even be able to work with [...] I'm on my defensive rapper, like yo man. When you follow in André's 3000's shoes, you're expected to really go in. Just the fact to even be on the song with her and shoot the video with her and just be in her presence. She's such a hard working, incredible artist. I’ll never forget that day we shot the video, I'll never forget being able to be on that song, and hopefully we got more as time goes on[...]|$|E
500|$|By 2009, {{there had}} been four {{versions}} of the album released: a rare London Records promotional disc, a bootleg with cover art by Arik Roper, the Rise Above/Music Cartel Records album, and a release by Tee Pee Records. The Rise Above/Music Cartel release was an unauthorized edited version, released in 1999 under the title Jerusalem. Jerusalem runs at 52 minutes and is a single composition split into six identically named tracks. The version of the album titled Dopesmoker was released on April 22, 2003, by Tee Pee Records on compact disc and vinyl with a 63-minute running time. Cisneros spoke most positively about the 2003 Dopesmoker release, saying [...] "I don't think the Dopesmoker thing is the exact version that we submitted, but that's the closest one that's {{come out of the}} four. If I had to pick a favorite, that would be it." [...] Parts of the song were used in the film Broken Flowers by Jim Jarmusch. Jarmusch stated that he was a fan of Sleep and listed them along with Earth and Sunn O))) as an influence for creating the film: [...] "I <b>love</b> <b>these</b> kind of visual landscapes they make, and they really inspired things for me for my film The Limits of Control".|$|E
