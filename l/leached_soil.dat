50|$|Calcium is {{one percent}} by weight of soils and is {{generally}} available but may be low as it is soluble and can be leached. It is thus low in sandy and heavily <b>leached</b> <b>soil</b> or strongly acidic mineral soil. Calcium is supplied to the plant {{in the form of}} exchangeable ions and moderately soluble minerals. Calcium is more available on the soil colloids than is potassium because the common mineral calcite, CaCO3, is more soluble than potassium-bearing minerals.|$|E
50|$|The litter left by kauri is {{much more}} acidic than most trees, and as it decays {{similarly}} acidic compounds are liberated. In {{a process known as}} leaching, these acidic molecules pass through the soil layers with the help of rainfall, and release other nutrients trapped in clay such as nitrogen and phosphorus. This leaves these important nutrients unavailable to other trees, as they are washed down into deeper layers. This process is known as podsolization, and changes the soil colour to a dull grey. For a single tree, this leaves an area of <b>leached</b> <b>soil</b> beneath known as a cup podsol. This leaching process is important for kauri's survival as it competes with other species for space.|$|E

40|$|The habitat {{preferences}} of twelve potential bush encroacher {{species in the}} Manyeleti Game Reserve, situated in the Arid Low-veld veld type in the eastern Transvaal, were investigated. These species have wide distribution patterns and owing to their presence in many sample plots, high frequencies were recorded in almost all classes of various habitat variables. Application of the Ecological Profiles Technique therefore resulted in disappointing results, as habitat preferences could not be established. The technique was modified to process quantitative density data (individuals per hectare) and the resulting profiles were {{expressed in terms of}} relative mean density per habitat class. The results were significant and habitat preferences were positively identified. Grouping of species with similar profiles lead to the identification of the following five indicator groups:Terminalia sericea, Combretum zeyheri, C. apiculatum and Acacia exuvialis with preference to sandy, acid, <b>leached,</b> non-sodic <b>soils</b> with low conductivity.

These processes are affected by physicochemical system properties, such as O 2 availability, and disturbances, such as the presence of antimicrobial compounds in wastewater. We examined the microbial community structure of leachfield mesocosms containing native soil and receiving domestic wastewater under intermittently-aerated (AIR) and unaerated (LEACH) conditions before and after dosing with tetracycline (TET). Community structure was assessed using phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA), analysis of dominant phylotypes using polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR–DGGE), and cloning and sequencing of 16 S rRNA genes. Prior to dosing, the same PLFA biomarkers were found in soil from AIR and LEACH treatments, although AIR soil had a larger active microbial population and higher concentrations for nine of 32 PLFA markers found. AIR soil also had a larger number of dominant phylotypes, most of them unique to this treatment. Dosing of mesocosms with TET had a more marked effect on AIR than <b>LEACH</b> <b>soil,</b> reducing the size of the microbial population and the number and concentration of PLFA markers. Dominant phylotypes decreased by ~ 15 % in response to TET in both treatments, although the AIR treatment retained a higher number of phylotypes than the LEACH treatment. Fewer than 10 % of clones were common to both OPEN ACCESS Water 2013, 5 506 AIR and <b>LEACH</b> <b>soil,</b> and fewer than 25 % of the clones from either treatment were homologous with isolates of known genus and species. These included human pathogens, as well as bacteria involved in biogeochemical transformations of C, N, S and metals, and biodegradation of various organic contaminants. Our results show that intermittent aeration has a marked effect on the size and structure of the microbial community that develops in a native leachfield soil. In addition, there is a differential response of the microbial communities of AIR and <b>LEACH</b> <b>soil</b> to tetracycline addition which may be linked to changes in function...|$|R

Each chamber holds 15 plant–soil systems with hermetical separation of the shared above ground (shoots) from the individual belowground compartments (roots, rhizosphere, soil).
