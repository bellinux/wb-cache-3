He's always so positive and so sure and he never wants to repeat himself. Like, 'How can I make something different and new and not <b>like</b> <b>anything</b> else?' I look back at that whole record, and I think, 'Wow I wish there was more time to do more singles.' You only get {{so many things that}} people hear.|$|E

500|$|Bleeding Through's The Truth {{album was}} {{released}} on January 10, 2006 through Trustkill Records. The album was produced by Rob Caggiano, lead guitarist of Anthrax. The band decided to rebuild their sound from the ground up, quoting to Alternative Press as [...] "Taking out the Metalcore, and then adding the metal into hardcore, if that makes any sense." [...] (--Scott Danough, guitarist). [...] "I don't think this album sounds <b>like</b> <b>anything</b> else out there right now. We're {{very proud of that}} fact." [...] says guitarist Brian Leppke.|$|E

He can break up a ball game with one mighty swish of his bat but, to put it mildly, there always has been an uncertain quality about him. Big Jeff was dissatisfied in Cleveland, didn't like the ballpark, didn't like the management, didn't <b>like</b> <b>anything.</b> Still, he has been a most valuable hitter, perhaps {{one of the best in}} the game when he is settled down to business." ...|$|E
500|$|Reznor called Year Zero a [...] "shift in direction" [...] {{in that it}} [...] "doesn't {{sound like}} With Teeth". [...] He also {{said that when he}} {{finishes}} a new album, he has to [...] "go into battle with the people {{whose job it is to}} figure out how to sell the record. The only time that didn't happen was [...] With Teeth. This time, however, [...] expecting an epic struggle. [...] is not a particularly friendly record and it certainly doesn't sound <b>like</b> <b>anything</b> else out there right now." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} also well-liked by the band. Mick Avory, who noted the song {{as one of}} the songs he was most proud to be {{associated}} with, said [...] "I always liked 'Lola', I liked the subject. It's not <b>like</b> <b>anything</b> else. I liked it for that. We'd always take a different path". In a 1983 interview, Ray Davies said, [...] "I'm just very pleased I recorded it and more pleased I wrote it". The band revisited the [...] "Lola" [...] character in the lyrics of their 1981 song, [...] "Destroyer", a minor chart hit in America.|$|E

500|$|The cover, {{created by}} Royston Knipe, {{was based on}} Francisco Goya's etching The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters. It {{features}} Baratte in his pistachio green silk Charvet suit replacing the recumbent Goya in his self-portrait. Instead of the owls and bats which assail Goya in The Sleep of Reason, Knipe used ravens. The cover was noted by The Guardian writer John Dugdale, in {{an article about the}} marketing aspect of book cover design, as being unique in the current market. He stated that; along with the covers for The Sense of an Ending and The Tiger's Wife; [...] "None of the three looks <b>like</b> <b>anything</b> else in bookshops".|$|E
500|$|Several of {{the actors}} had {{basketball}} experience, such as Krasinski, who played for his high school team. Brian Baumgartner, who portrays Kevin, actually succeeded in making 14 free-throw shots, of which several {{were included in the}} final footage. Steve Carell later said of his basketball skills, [...] "The thing about looking like you're bad at basketball is, it's <b>like</b> <b>anything</b> else, you have to be incredibly good in order to look bad [...] but that's not the case with me and basketball. I just was bad." [...] However, Carell joked that he would [...] "kick ass" [...] at a hockey episode, a reference to his real-life hockey skills.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} for PopMatters, music critic Tim O'Neil called the song [...] "an odd track" [...] that [...] "doesn't really sound <b>like</b> <b>anything</b> [...] ever heard before." [...] He continued: [...] "I wouldn't be {{surprised}} {{if it was the}} next single , because its [...] not the kind of track you forget." [...] John Bush from AllMusic listed the track as one of his album track picks while Michaelangelo Matos from Spin called it one of the album's best moments that were [...] "less about the successive climaxes than steady-state flow." [...] Jack Smith from BBC Music described the song as [...] "cutting edge" [...] and [...] "hook-laden", while highlighting it as [...] "a welcome return" [...] for Burgess.|$|E

5000|$|... "All A Woman Needs" [...] {{grew out}} of a {{conversation}} Armatrading had with friends over dinner, with one of them relating a story about a man who gave a woman he <b>liked</b> <b>anything</b> she asked for, saying [...] "love will come later". Armatrading felt that this message was [...] "something to say to somebody".|$|R
500|$|... "Hello Kitty" [...] is a J-pop, dubstep, and EDM {{track that}} is three minutes and {{eighteen}} seconds long. [...] "Hello Kitty" [...] {{was written by}} Lavigne, Chad Kroeger, David Hodges and Martin Johnson, while the song was produced by Kroeger and Hodges. Brandon Paddock and Kyle Moorman became assistants in its production. The song was engineered by John Hanes, musical mixed by Serban Ghenea and additional programming was held by Paddock and Moorman. Lavigne described the lyrics while talking to Digital Spy, [...] "'Hello Kitty' was such an interesting topic and subject [...] It was really exciting for me. I didn't want it to sound <b>like</b> <b>anything</b> I'd done before. I wanted it to sound over the top so I ended up hiring a new producer {{to help me with}} it." ...|$|E
500|$|Before {{the start}} of the {{recording}} sessions, bassist David Ellefson stated that the band doesn't want their seventh studio album to sound <b>like</b> <b>anything</b> they have already recorded. Instrumentally, the band introduced a more melodic mix than the previous albums, filled with crunchy riffs and speedy guitar solos. In addition, Mustaine re-evaluated the band's songwriting techniques, recasting some lyrics to better reflect the sales and radio airplay environment of then's rock arena. According to him, many of the song's lyrics were altered {{in order to make the}} music [...] "a little more inclusive of people who aren't into dying and evil". Ellefson commented that this album was a natural progression in Megadeth's sound. He further stated that they were not trying to leave behind their thrash metal and heavy metal roots, but to broaden their musical horizons.|$|E
500|$|More {{mixed reviews}} were {{critical}} of Diamandis' vocal delivery. Lou Thomas from BBC Music commented that [...] "he consistently diverting changes in style across the album are fine—the wonky 80s shoulder-pad pop of 'The Outsider' is nothing <b>like</b> <b>anything</b> else here, for example. But over 13 songs of Sparks-voice and many similar staccato piano riffs listeners may feel bludgeoned by Marina and her slightly overbearing presence", concluding that her eccentric vocals would polarise opinions. Sean O'Neal wrote on The A.V. Club that after [...] "dozens of squeaky Regina Spektor-ish enunciations" [...] and [...] "Kate Bush trills", the [...] "overbearing {{need to prove}} herself just ends up being exhausting". Joe Rivers of No Ripcord praised [...] "Are You Satisfied?", [...] "Hollywood" [...] and [...] "Oh No!" [...] but was put off by sudden [...] "howling" [...] in [...] "Hermit the Frog" [...] and a [...] "throaty growl" [...] in [...] "The Outsider".|$|E
6000|$|At {{this again}} he fairly faced her, his {{momentary}} silence making it still more direct. [...] "I like, you know, {{about as well}} as I ever <b>liked</b> <b>anything,</b> this wonderful idea of yours of putting in a plea for her solitude and her youth. Don't think I do it injustice if I say--which is saying much--that it's quite as charming as it's amusing. And now good-bye." ...|$|R
6000|$|Poor Kate {{found it}} {{not at all}} easy to explain {{when she came to}} particulars. [...] "Always cross," [...] was the clearest idea in her mind; [...] "never pleased with her, never <b>liking</b> <b>anything</b> she did--not punishing, but much worse." [...] She had not made out her case, she knew; but she could only murmur again, [...] "It all went wrong, and I was very unhappy." ...|$|R

The {{question}} is, have we generals to equal those who led the Prussians to victory against Austria? Is our discipline equal--or <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> equal--to that of the Prussians? Is our organization as good as theirs? And lastly, have we <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> their numbers? ...|$|R
500|$|Astral Weeks {{influenced}} future {{releases of}} other musicians such as Bono and Bruce Springsteen. Mike Ragogna with The Huffington Post wrote that Astral Weeks influenced Springsteen's 1973 first album Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J. {{and two of}} the songs from his second. Steven Van Zandt, from Springsteen's E Street Band, has said: [...] "Astral Weeks was like a religion to us." [...] According to writer Steve Turner, the album also became popular with travelers of the hippie trail, [...] "from Europe through to Kathmandu and there were even reports of vans painted in psychedelic colours being renamed 'the Van Morrison'." [...] In his 1975 book, Ritchie Yorke wrote [...] "It was almost as if Van Morrison, elusive at any time, had deliberately created an album of music which would indefinitely withstand the vulgarity of music industry image-making. Later they might say that other albums were reminiscent of Astral Weeks, but they could never claim that Astral Weeks was <b>like</b> <b>anything</b> else." ...|$|E
500|$|Lancaster, however, {{kept an eye}} on {{the public}} {{scrutiny}} surrounding Lopez. Olivier Van Doorne, worldwide creative director at Select Communications, said: [...] "Whenever you take a celebrity into a commercial venture, which {{more and more people are}} doing, there's enormous risk [...] It doesn't take much to turn the public around overnight." [...] Mark Malinowski, director for entertainment marketing at Ketchum, part of the Omnicom, said the situation [...] "will reach a point where, <b>like</b> <b>anything</b> else, there may be overexposure". Lancaster's marketing vice president Catherine Walsh remarked in a statement: [...] "The worst thing in the world would be to unplug Glow to introduce Still". Still Jennifer Lopez was released in October 2003. While Glow by JLo was aimed at the female market at girls between the age of 15 and 25, Still Jennifer Lopez was aimed to appeal to an older demographic of females 25 and above, according to Rebecca Murray of About.com.|$|E
500|$|Wired {{reported}} that the iPhone 5 design, carried on in the iPhone 5S and iPhone SE, was regarded as [...] "long been the golden child of Apple phone design and a benchmark for phones in general", while the succeeding iPhone 6/6S design was less critically acclaimed as it [...] "felt a little bit wrong, as though you were holding a slick $650 bar of soap". Wired described the iPhone 5 as [...] "elegance rooted {{in the way the}} aluminum and glass work together. It felt streamlined, yet substantial, which is different from the iPhone 6, which feels substantial in size alone. Plus, unlike the ubiquitous rounded corners of the 6, the iPhone 5 didn’t really look <b>like</b> <b>anything</b> else on the market at the time". However, the iPhone 5's design was not suited to scaling up, in contrast to the iPhone 6/6S which could better accommodate the growing consumer trend towards larger screen sizes and indeed spawned the 6/6S Plus phablet models.|$|E
50|$|When Diller {{was a young}} boy, he <b>liked</b> <b>anything</b> {{that was}} drawn and was funny. When he started drawing, {{there was not one}} {{specific}} person he tried to copy, but he liked the cartoon Andy Capp. Diller couldn't read at the time (he was 6 years old), but he could understand Andy Capp. From an early age, Diller was drawn to cartoons that took very little dialogue to tell a story.|$|R
60|$|One bit of {{patronage}} {{at least she}} could exercise; a married pair of former Homestead servants {{had set up a}} fuel store at St. Norbert's, receiving coal from the ships, and retailing it.

5000|$|Jordan Ireland was {{critical}} about the album: [...] "With this album I don’t {{really feel like}} we nailed it, we’re definitely falling {{into a lot of}} categories that’ve been done before and I don’t feel <b>like</b> it’s <b>anything</b> completely original or <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> that, but that’s kind of the goal that we’re heading towards." ...|$|R
500|$|Most of the {{negative}} comments centered around the following World Heavyweight Championship match, which ended in disqualification immediately following a double countout in the preceding Orton-Edge match due to injury. McNichol described it [...] "a weak ending in a normal show", but especially when the Orton-Edge match [...] "had ended in such circumstances". Bishop agreed, only awarding the match 2.5 out of ten {{and said that the}} match [...] "hurt the show in a big, big way". Kevin Eck of The Baltimore Sun also criticized the booking of the finish, remarking that [...] "Swagger came off looking <b>like</b> <b>anything</b> but a credible champion". Wrestling journalist Dave Meltzer also criticized the World Heavyweight Championship match, remarking that it was [...] "almost an insult as a PPV main event". Bishop stated that the show was [...] "hampered by several stoppages for blood" [...] and a predictable ending to the main event between Cena and Batista. McNichol also criticized the main event as [...] "overbooked and excessive", while Eck remarked that it had a [...] "predictable result".|$|E
500|$|NME {{reviewer}} Louis Pattison rated Syro 9out of 10and {{surmised that}} {{the album is}} [...] "a banging reminder of why the Cornish raver is one of music's true innovators". Pattison further stated that [...] "whereas Drukqs sometimes felt alienating or punishing, Syro charms and beguiles … [...] amazing: bug-eyed, banging rave that sounds quintessentially Aphex while not quite sounding <b>like</b> <b>anything</b> he's done before." [...] In his review for The Wire, Derek Walmsley wrote positively about the album. He said that [...] "Syro feels like a perfected memory of 80s music", adding [...] "its sweeping melodies, with echoes of 1991's Analogue Bubblebath, {{could be seen as}} a return to his roots" [...] but concluded that [...] "Aphex Twin's music seems as new as it ever was." [...] Rolling Stone reviewer Will Hermes gave Syro a four-out-of-five star rating and stated that the record is [...] "thick with Seventies jazz-funk nods" [...] and [...] "answers Daft Punks Random Access Memories with future-shock electronics supplanting nostalgic dazzle … graying snobs once called this 'intelligent dance music.' Even now, few do it better." ...|$|E
500|$|Reaction to [...] "You're Getting Old" [...] was positive. Critics {{pointed to}} the self-referencing aim of the episode in growing older and redefining senses of humor as well as cynicism. While Ramsey Isler of IGN found the episode to be largely humorless and monotonous, he {{interpreted}} this as intentional {{on the part of}} the show's creators, who he believed had grown weary of creating the series. Isler called the final moments of the episode [...] "the most somber material the series has ever produced... providing the emotional soundtrack for a montage of images that just rip the heart out of any South Park fan", giving the episode an 8.5/10. HitFix's review on the episode focused on its personal philosophic themes, with reviewer Alan Sepinwall stating [...] "But what was interesting about Stan's existential crisis, and how he struggled to <b>like</b> <b>anything,</b> is that the show's philosophy has often largely been about how other people care too much about things... Yet here, Stan's lack of passion – and the Marsh parents' – was clearly shown to be a bad thing for them." ...|$|E
