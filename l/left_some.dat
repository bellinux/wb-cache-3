5|$|Before {{developing}} into Tropical Depression Nine, {{the precursor}} tropical wave dropped moderate to heavy rainfall across the Lesser Antilles. The depression caused moderate rainfall in Puerto Rico, where {{two to three}} inches (50 to 75mm) of precipitation were recorded. The flooding from the rainfall entered tenhouses and <b>left</b> <b>some</b> streets impassable. A mudslide {{was reported in the}} eastern portion of the island. A river in northeastern Puerto Rico surpassed its banks from flooding, though it returned to normal levels within hours. Damage in Puerto Rico totaled $20,000 (2003USD, $ USD).|$|E
5|$|Passing to {{the east}} of Georgia, the storm {{produced}} light winds and rainfall near the coast. In South Carolina, the storm brought over 7inches (175mm) of precipitation to North Myrtle Beach, which caused ponding on roadways. Winds were generally light, peaking at around 35mph (55km/h), which caused isolated power outages; about 2,700people across the state lost power. Near Charleston, the passage of the storm caused moderate flooding that <b>left</b> <b>some</b> roads closed. No significant damage was reported in the state.|$|E

The Hokies began the new season with hopes of repeating the success that saw the team reach consecutive Bowl Alliance games in the previous two seasons, but the loss {{of much of the}} starting lineup that led the Hokies in those years <b>left</b> <b>some</b> people's skeptical about Tech's chance to reach a third Bowl Alliance game.|$|E
5|$|When the BoM first classiifed Lam as Tropical Low 13U, {{the agency}} also issued a cyclone {{watch for the}} Cape York Peninsula and Arnhem Land. Before the storm struck, {{officials}} transported residents in Lam's path by air to the capital city Darwin. All 426people living in Warruwi were airlifted, and the storm caused many schools {{in the region to}} be closed; students from Warruwi continued classes after they evacuated to Darwin. Residents anticipated Lam's intensity to be lower at landfall, which <b>left</b> <b>some</b> off guard.|$|E

5|$|After Naylor {{was brought}} home, the mob {{attacked}} the church, damaging a wall with the cannon. A second cannon was {{brought from the}} wharfs and fired at the church, after which the mob pelted the building with rocks and broke in through a side door. The soldiers fired on the men breaking into the church, who promptly retreated. After retreating, the nativists negotiated with the guard, who agreed to withdraw, allowing the nativists to guard the church. Responding to being pelted with rocks as they <b>left,</b> <b>some</b> soldiers fired back on the crowd, which only incited the mob further. The mob forced {{its way into the}} church, causing extensive damage to the interior. After about an hour, a group of twenty men organized themselves to guard St. Philip Neri's, and the mob left the church.|$|E
5|$|After the {{war with}} Japan began, Wau became an {{evacuation}} centre, receiving refugees from Lae and Salamaua. Non-native {{women and children were}} evacuated while men of military age were called up for service in the New Guinea Volunteer Rifles, the local militia unit. Initially, civilians were evacuated by civilian aircraft but as the Japanese drew closer—bombing Wau on 23 January 1942—it became too dangerous to fly without fighter escort, which was unavailable. This <b>left</b> <b>some</b> 250 European and Asian men stranded. These refugees made a hazardous journey over the Owen Stanley Range on foot by way of Kudjeru and Tekadu to Bulldog, a disused mining settlement where there was an aerodrome, and thence down the Lakekamu River to the sea.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he never}} {{abandoned}} {{the idea of}} composing a full opera, and considered many subjects– including that of the Nibelung saga later adapted by Wagner, about which he corresponded with his sister Fanny– he never wrote {{more than a few}} pages of sketches for any project. In Mendelssohn's last years the opera manager Benjamin Lumley tried to contract him to write an opera from Shakespeare's The Tempest on a libretto by Eugène Scribe, and even announced it as forthcoming in 1847, the year of Mendelssohn's death. The libretto was eventually set by Fromental Halévy. At his death Mendelssohn <b>left</b> <b>some</b> sketches for an opera on the story of the Lorelei.|$|E

5|$|Andover {{competed in}} the first Hampshire Senior Cup in 1888, but became {{involved}} in controversy after they were knocked out of the competition by Woolston Works. During this match, a Glasgow–based player called J. Kesson played for Woolston in their victory. Andover protested that Kesson should be disqualified {{on the grounds of}} residency—although he had played for Woolston Works earlier that season, he had since moved back to Glasgow. Woolston's appeal rested on the fact that Kesson had <b>left</b> <b>some</b> items of clothing at his lodgings in Woolston, and this should be interpreted as his intention to return. The Hampshire FA upheld the appeal, allowing Woolston to progress through to the next round and eventually win the inaugural competition.|$|E
5|$|As several squads {{left the}} hill on a patrol, North Koreans {{attacked}} the main company position behind it. The platoon dropped {{down off the}} ridge into a gully on the <b>left.</b> <b>Some</b> {{of the men in}} the advanced squad made their way back to US lines, but North Koreans captured most near the bottom of Ka-san on September 10 as they were trying to make their way through the North Korean lines. About 30 minutes after D Company had reached Hill 755, an estimated North Korean battalion launched an attack down the slope running south to Hill 755 from the crest of Hill 902. The company to turned back this attack. That night, North Korean mortar and small arms fire harassed the company and there were several small probing North Korean attacks.|$|E
5|$|Concerned at {{the expense}} of {{maintaining}} the Falkland Islands in an era of budget cuts, the UK again considered transferring sovereignty to Argentina in the early Thatcher government. Substantive sovereignty talks again ended by 1981, and the dispute escalated with passing time. In April 1982, the disagreement became an armed conflict when Argentina invaded the Falklands and other British territories in the South Atlantic, briefly occupying them until a UK expeditionary force retook the territories in June. After the war, the United Kingdom expanded its military presence, building RAF Mount Pleasant and increasing the size of its garrison. The war also <b>left</b> <b>some</b> 117 minefields containing nearly 20,000 mines of various types, including anti-vehicle and anti-personnel mines. Due to the large number of deminer casualties, initial attempts to clear the mines ceased in 1983.|$|E

5|$|From Puerto de Caballos, Gil González sailed west {{along the}} coast to the Amatique Bay, and founded a Spanish {{settlement}} {{near the mouth of}} the Río Dulce, within modern-day Guatemala, which he named San Gil de Buena Vista. He launched a campaign of conquest in the mountainous region dividing Honduras from Guatemala. González <b>left</b> <b>some</b> of his men under the command of Francisco Riquelme at San Gil de Buena Vista, and sailed back east {{along the coast}} to a point east of the Cape of Honduras (near modern Trujillo). From there he marched inland in search of a route to the Pacific. The colonists at San Gil did not prosper, and soon searched of a more hospitable location. They resettled in the important indigenous town of Nito, near the mouth of the Dulce River.|$|E
5|$|Governor Deane C. Davis of Vermont {{declared}} a state of emergency and ordered the National Guard to assist with cleanup efforts. Blowing snow continuously blocked roads after being cleared, and snow removal vehicles, not equipped to withstand the excessive snow, began experiencing mechanical issues. The storm <b>left</b> <b>some</b> communities without power or telephone service for up to two days, although isolated outages persisted longer. One person died in Saxtons River. With roads impassable in both New York and New England, tank trucks could not reach dairy farmers, who were in some cases forced to discard thousands of gallons of milk. In other cases, power outages rendered equipment useless, requiring milking to be done manually. One person in New Hampshire died of exhaustion during the storm.|$|E
5|$|In his {{subsequent}} statement Smith admitted to {{being at the}} Rainbow with Corcoran and a male friend, but claimed they were later separated {{when they went to}} another public house, the Kerryman, and the male friend was ejected.

Smith said that the man became aggressive, so he asked Corcoran if she wanted to go home. Claiming that she told him she did not, he said he then left her.|$|E
