500|$|The stage {{backdrop}} depicted {{an urban}} rooftop with water tank and air outlet, symbolic of New York's skyline. [...] At twilight, the backing band went onstage, followed by New York's mayor, Ed Koch, who announced, [...] "Ladies and gentlemen, Simon and Garfunkel!" [...] The duo entered through a side stage door, took center stage amid audience applause, <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>and</b> shook hands, {{and began the}} concert with their 1968 hit [...] "Mrs. Robinson".|$|E
500|$|Bayer {{asked the}} group to perform [...] "Vow" [...] live while he filmed the takes for the video shoot. Garbage had never {{performed}} live as group prior to this, and had initially had not considered ever performing live onstage. [...] "We set up amps and played the guitars. Butch was pounding away and Shirley had a live mic. After the first run-through, we all <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>and</b> said, 'This feels really good.'" [...] Erikson later recalled. The group enjoyed the experience of performing together {{so much that they}} quickly changed their minds, and scheduled tourdates later that year.|$|E
500|$|After collaborating in 2002's Minority Report, Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise were {{interested}} in working together again. Spielberg stated about Cruise, [...] "He's such an intelligent, creative partner, and brings such great ideas to the set that we just spark each other. [...] I love working with Tom Cruise." [...] Cruise met with Spielberg during the filming of Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can (2002) and gave three options of films to create together, one of them being an adaptation of The War of the Worlds. Spielberg chose The War of the Worlds and stated, [...] "We <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>and</b> the lights went on. [...] As soon as I heard it, I said 'Oh my God! War of the Worlds – absolutely.' [...] That was it." ...|$|E

500|$|In May 1974, Los Angeles Times critic Robert Hilburn {{reviewed}} the second New York Dolls album, Too Much Too Soon. [...] "I told ya the New York Dolls were the real thing," [...] he wrote, describing the album as [...] "perhaps {{the best example}} of raw, thumb-your-nose-at-the-world, punk rock since the Rolling Stones' Exile on Main Street." [...] Bassist Jeff Jensen of Boston's Real Kids reports of a show that year, [...] "A reviewer for one of the free entertainment magazines of the time caught the act and gave us a great review, calling us a 'punk band.'... e all sort of <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>and</b> said, 'What's punk?'" [...] In a 1974 interview for his fanzine Heavy Metal Digest Danny Sugerman told Iggy Pop [...] "You went on record as saying you never were a punk" [...] and Iggy replied [...] "...well I ain't. I never was a punk." ...|$|E
500|$|Hanneman later {{admitted}} {{that while the}} band was listening to Metallica and Megadeth at the time, they were finding the repetition of guitar riffs tiring. He said, [...] "If we do a verse two or three times, we're already bored with it. So we weren't {{trying to make the}} songs shorter—that's just what we were into," [...] which resulted in the album's short duration of 29 minutes. King had stated that while hour-long records seem to be the trend, [...] "ou could lose this part; you could cut this song completely, and make a much more intense record, which is what we're all about." [...] When the record was completed, the band met with Rubin, who asked: [...] "Do you realize how short this is?" [...] Slayer members <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>and</b> replied: [...] "So what?" [...] The entire album was on one side of a cassette; King stated it was [...] "neat," [...] as [...] "You could listen to it, flip it over, and play it again." [...] The music is abrasive and faster than previous releases, helping to narrow the gap between thrash metal and its predecessor hardcore punk, and is played at an average of 220 beats per minute.|$|E
500|$|After [...] "Freakshow" [...] is Blackouts eight track, [...] "Toy Soldier", a R and dance-pop song {{reminiscent}} of Destiny's Child's song [...] "Lose My Breath" [...] (2004) that showcases a military drumroll and Spears singing about needing a new lover. In [...] "Hot as Ice", a R song featuring background vocals by T-Pain, she sings {{in a higher}} register: [...] "I'm just a girl {{with the ability to}} drive a man crazy / Make him call me 'mama', make him my new baby." [...] Blackouts tenth track [...] "Ooh Ooh Baby" [...] contains a flamenco guitar and blends the beat from Gary Glitter's [...] "Rock and Roll" [...] (1972) and the melody of The Turtles' [...] "Happy Together" [...] (1967). In the lyrics, she sings to a lover [...] "Touch me and I come alive / I can feel you on my lips / I can feel you deep inside". Kara DioGuardi said she was inspired by the relationship between Spears and her first son in the studio, saying: [...] "I would look at the two of them, the way they <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>and</b> the way she would hold the baby. It kind of struck me as interesting. At times it'd be about a kid at times about a lover." [...] "Perfect Lover", an R song, has a propulsive, clattery belly-dance beat in which Spears sings lyrics such as [...] "Tick-tock / Tick-tock / Come and get me while I'm hot". The twelfth track is [...] "Why Should I Be Sad", a midtempo R song directed to her ex-husband Kevin Federline. One of the bonus tracks, [...] "Everybody", samples Eurythmics' [...] "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" [...] (1983). It features Spears singing about the dancefloor in a breathy lower register.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the morning}} of March 1, Lebrón {{traveled}} to Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan, where she rendezvoused {{with the rest of}} the group. They took the train to Washington, DC, and went the short distance from Union Station to the Capitol. Rafael Cancel Miranda suggested they postpone the attack, as it was late and the weather was rainy. Lebrón said, [...] "I am alone" [...] and continued towards the Capitol building's interior. The group <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>and</b> decided to follow her.|$|E
2500|$|To {{make sure}} the beat was the same {{throughout}} the song, Porter took a noise gate and set it to be triggered by a drum machine, using percussion instruments Joyce typically did not, set to 16th notes. This created what he called [...] "a swirling signal" [...] that balanced the analog tremolo effect and made sure the whole song stayed on the same beat. The guitar tracks were then [...] "bounced" [...] down to three of the master recording's 24 available tracks, and the 15-minute version was cut down to 8 minutes. This was longer than any previous Smiths' song had been. But, Porter told Tony Fletcher, [...] "we <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>and</b> said, 'It sounds fucking great; let's keep it like that.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In Germany militant Darwinismus {{elevated}} Darwin to heroic status. When {{the eminent}} Freethinker Doctor Ludwig Büchner requested an audience {{he thought he}} was greeting a noble ally. To Darwin this was a grotesque misunderstanding, but he felt unable to refuse. Darwin's wife Emma Darwin expressed her expectation that their guest [...] "will refrain from airing his very strong religious opinions" [...] and invited their old friend the Revd. John Brodie Innes. On Thursday 28 September 1881 Büchner arrived with Edward Aveling. Darwin's son Frank was also present. Darwin wittily explained that [...] " [...] & I have been fast friends for 30 years. We never thoroughly agreed on any subject but once and then we <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>and</b> thought one of us must be very ill".|$|E

2500|$|In 2004, k.d. lang {{recorded}} {{a version of}} [...] "Hallelujah" [...] on her album Hymns of the 49th Parallel. She has since sung it at several major events, such as at the Canadian Juno Awards of 2005, where it [...] "brought the audience to its feet for a two-minute ovation." [...] Lang also sang it at the 2006 Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame when Cohen {{was inducted into the}} Hall of Fame. Cohen's partner, singer Anjani Thomas, said: [...] "After hearing k.d. lang perform that song at the Canadian Songwriter's Hall of Fame in 2006 we <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>and</b> said, 'well, I think we can lay that song to rest now! It's really been done to its ultimate blissful state of perfection'." [...] Lang sang it at the opening ceremony of the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver, before a claimed TV audience of three billion.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, in {{the lead}} group, Sylvain Calzati had stormed {{away from the other}} five escapees with about [...] to go, only to be chased after {{somewhat}} later by Patrice Halgand and Kjell Carlström. The other three riders mainly <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>and</b> did not believe they could stay out of the peloton's grip. However, the peloton would catch up with those three non-believers, but the other three were not to be caught before the finish line. Sylvain Calzati proved to be too strong for the other two as they coöperated to get back to him but never saw him again before Lorient, instead the gap only became bigger. In the end Sylvain Calzati scored his most beautiful professional victory of his career as he came over the finish line more than two minutes ahead of Carlström and Halgand, who both just ended a few seconds before the peloton. In the peloton, Robbie McEwen again won the sprint, enlarging his lead in the standings for the green jersey over the other sprinters.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the album's stripped-back closing track, [...] "You Were Good", Jim Adkins stated: [...] "A {{fair amount}} of the ideas for Damage started out as {{acoustic}} songs, like really rough acoustic songs. 'You Were Good' started out in a pretty acoustic-based world and {{when we tried to}} take it out of that world, we realized that without the acoustic guitar in there as a bed, it didn't feel the same without it being there. With 'You Were Good', we experimented around a little bit with fleshing it out and building the dynamics of it in a full band sense, {{but at the end of}} the day we all <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>and</b> agreed it sounded better with just me and a guitar and the weirdo, Indian drone thing on there." [...] Guitarist and backing vocalist Tom Linton elaborated: [...] "It was just [...] with an acoustic guitar and his vocals, and there was never a point where he stopped and started over. He just played it from the beginning to the end live. Then I overdubbed an organ part and Alain [...] played the guitar part. That was really fun to do, and I don't think we had ever done it before, especially with vocals." ...|$|E

2500|$|Between {{leaving the}} Moments and joining The Small Faces, Steve Marriott joined The Checkpoints. Chris Clements: [...] "He {{actually}} approached us (The Checkpoints) {{and said he}} needed to fulfill some gigs that were pending. This was in 1965, he was {{with us for a}} couple of months. We rehearsed at The Kentish Drovers in the Old Kent Road in South London. He got us to learn James Brown numbers, which at the time we weren't very up in. One particular memory sticks in my mind. When we rehearsed with him, he almost spoke the words of the song, rather than sang the words. He was listening to us, making sure we got the backing right, so he didn't put himself out vocally. But when we did the first gig with him, out came this fantastic soul voice, we all <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>and</b> our mouths fell open! When doing the gigs, we would pick him up outside the Brewery in Romford road Essex. He always had a small case with his harmonicas in. His harmonica playing was excellent. Our transport at that time was a converted ambulance, and Steve would always sit up front with the owner driver, (a man in his early 50s) rather than sit in the back talking to us. He {{seemed to me to be}} a bit of a loner. Even when I had a conversation with him, he always seemed to be looking past me, as though in a hurry to be somewhere else. He was quite a heavy smoker as I recall. We did various venues in Essex, around the Basildon area. He had no guitar, he would use our lead guitarist's red Fender Strat. Steve would put many guitar breaks in the James Brown songs. So we would all huddle around our drummer Gary Hyde who would watch Steve. When Gary stopped, we stopped, when Gary started, we started, so by using those tactics the gigs went well. We had photos taken at the various venues at that time, I wish someone would dig them out from wherever, I would love to see them." ...|$|E
