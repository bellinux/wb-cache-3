40|$|Title of the paper: Investigation on {{occupational}} behaviour {{of female}} and castrated male fattening pigs In four rounds 144 fattening pigs {{of both sexes}} were brought in four pens (two of them were littered, two without any litter). Their occupational behaviour was recorded {{at the time of}} bringing the pigs into the pen, at the beginning, at the middle {{and at the end of}} the fattening period using an infrared-video-technology and a time lapse video recorder. In every pen three occupational tools (pendular beam, cross of chains and <b>lifting</b> <b>beam)</b> were offered to the pigs. At the 1 st recording the behaviour of all pigs was analysed, at the other fattening periods the behaviour of six focal pigs of both sexes per pen was analysed always over 24 h. At the time the pigs were brought into the pens no significant differences between the two sexes could be observed concerning the latency until the pigs had the first contact to the different occupational tools, whereas both sexes needed longest for their first contact to the cross of chains. During the other fattening periods the duration of occupation with the cross of chains (♂= 0. 06 %; ♀= 0. 08 %, p< 0. 086) and the pendular beam (♂= 0. 15 %; ♀= 0. 2 %, p< 0. 087) by the female pigs tended to be longer than the one shown by the castrated male pigs. Thereby both sexes used the cross of chains longer for occupation than the pendular beam and the <b>lifting</b> <b>beam.</b> The female pigs occupied themselves significantly longer with the straw in the littered pens, the floor in the pens without straw, the pen’s equipment and the pen mates than the castrated male pigs did. In contrast the castrated males used the trough significantly longer for occupation. In this study female pigs were more active, whereas the castrated male pigs spent a significantly longer time feeding and tended to spend more time lying and had better daily gains...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to {{document}} {{the results of the}} 150 % rated capacity load test performed by DynCorp Hoisting and Rigging on the CASTOR GSF special cask lifting beams. The two lifting beams were originally rated and tested at 20, 000 kg (44, 000 lb) by the cask manufacturer in Germany. The testing performed by DynCorp rated and tested the lifting beams to 30, 000 kg (66, 000 lb) + 0 %, - 5 %, for Hanford Site use. The CASTOR GSF cask, used to transport isotopic Heat Sources (canisters), must be lifted with its own designed <b>lifting</b> <b>beam</b> system (Figures 1, 2, and 3). As designed, the beam material is RSt 37 - 2 (equivalent to American Society for Testing and Materials [ASTM] A- 570), the eye plate is St 52 - 2 (equivalent to ASTM A- 516), and the lifting pin is St 50 (equivalent to ASTM A- 515). The beam has two opposing 58 mm (2. 3 in.) diameter by 120 mm(4. 7 in.) length, high grade steel pins that engage the cask for lifting. The pins have a manual locking mechanism to prevent disengagement from the casks. The static, gross weight (loaded) of the cask 18, 640 kg (41, 000 lb) on the pins prevents movement of the pins during lifting. This is due to the frictional force of the cask on the pins when lifting begins...|$|E
