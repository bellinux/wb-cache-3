However, substantial anharmonicity was found at elevated temperatures, especially for phonon modes dominated by the motions of oxygen atoms.

Extending our previous work on ZrSiO 4, the Gibbs free energy has been calculated using a transferable interatomic potential in various phases over a range of P and T. Due to an interesting interplay between the <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> and atomic packing, the zircon (body centered tetragonal, I 41 /amd), scheelite (body centered tetragonal, I 41 /a) and huttonite (monoclinic, P 21 /n) phases occur at different P and T. It is shown that for ThSiO 4 at high P, the huttonite and scheelite phases are favored at high and low T respectively. However, for both USiO 4 and HfSiO 4 the huttonite phase is dynamically unstable and the scheelite phase is stable as the high pressure phase. In fact, the calculations reveal that the stability of the huttonite phase is determined by the ionic size of the M-atom; this phase is unstable for the silicate with the smaller Hf and U ions and stable with the larger Th ion. The calculated phase diagrams are in fair agreement with the reported experimental observations. The calculated structures, phonon spectra, and various thermodynamic properties also fairly well reproduce the available experimental data.

40|$|<b>Vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> is {{important}} for the thermodynamics of alloying, alloy formation, phase transitions and phase stability at high temperature. <b>Vibrational</b> <b>entropies</b> of alloying and alloy formation were calculated for 32 binary alloys and intermetallic compounds using phonon DOS curves taken from the literature. The <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropies</b> of formation span a wide range from - 0. 64 to + 0. 55 kB/atom, and the <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropies</b> of alloying ranged from - 0. 39 to + 1. 0 kB/atom. This range exceeds the range of configurational entropy of a binary alloy, which reaches a maximum value of + 0. 69 kB/atom and a minimum value of 0 k B /atom. The <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> of the NiTi martensitic transition was measured using low-temperature calorimetry and inelastic neutron-scattering. The high-temperature B 2 phase of NiTi has a <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> 0. 5 k B /atom larger than the low-temperature martensitic phase. The difference in <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> accounts for the total entropy of the austenitic-martensitic phase transition. Inelastic neutron scattering was used to show that the phonon DOS of V is unchanged between 20 and 1000 °C, inconsistent with the phonon softening expected from thermal expansion. It is found that the effects of volume expansion and rising temperature exert equal and opposite shifts on the phonon DOS. The pure temperature dependence of the phonon DOS is due to strong phonon-phonon scattering, which in turn leads to a <b>large</b> anharmonic <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> contribution at high temperature.

40|$|Generating {{the immune}} {{response}} requires the discrimination of peptides {{presented by the}} human leukocyte antigen complex (HLA) through the T-cell receptor (TCR). However, how a single amino acid substitution in the antigen bonded to HLA affects the response of T cells remains uncertain. Hence, we used molecular dynamics computations to analyze the molecular interactions between peptides, HLA and TCR. We compared immunologically reactive complexes with non-reactive and weakly reactive complexes. MD trajectories were produced to simulate the behavior of isolated components of the various p-HLA-TCR complexes. Analysis of the fluctuations showed that p-HLA binding barely restrains TCR motions, and mainly affects the CDR 3 loops. Conversely, inactive p-HLA complexes displayed significant drop in their dynamics when compared with its free versus ternary forms (p-HLA-TCR). In agreement, the free non-reactive p-HLA complexes showed a lower amount of salt bridges than the responsive ones. This resulted in differences between the electrostatic potentials of reactive and inactive p-HLA species and <b>larger</b> <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropies</b> in non-elicitor complexes. Analysis of the ternary p-HLA-TCR complexes also revealed {{a larger number of}} salt bridges in the responsive complexes. To summarize, our computations indicate that the affinity of each p-HLA complex towards TCR is intimately linked to both, the dynamics of its free species and its ability to form specific intermolecular salt-bridges in the ternary complexes. Of outstanding interest is the emerging concept of antigen reactivity involving its interplay with the HLA head sidechain dynamics by rearranging its salt-bridges.

As such, phonons, spin-waves or electronic excitations have their own entropic contribution. This thesis investigates the entropic effects of lattice vibrations in transition metal alloys, both from experimental and computational points of view. Using inelastic neutron scattering, it is shown that a few percent of substitutional impurities from the transition metal series strongly affect the phonon density of states (DOS) of pure vanadium. Alloying with 6 % Pt solutes produces a strong stiffening of the phonon DOS, inducing a <b>large</b> and negative <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> of mixing, which overcomes the increase in configurational entropy. A systematic study of chemical trends for different transition metal impurities was conducted. A previously unknown correlation is established between the <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> of alloying and the difference in electronegativity of the solute and the host. Density-functional theory calculations were conducted and confirmed the occurrence of systematic charge-transfers correlating with the electronegativity, which affect the interatomic force-constants and the phonons. The effect of impurities on the anomalous temperature-dependence of phonons in vanadium is investigated. It is found that the solutes which affect the phonon density of states most strongly at room temperature also suppress the anomalous temperature behavior. Electron-phonon and phonon-phonon couplings are examined as potential sources of this effect, through a careful accounting of their contributions to the heat capacity, based on inelastic neutron scattering experiments, calorimetry measurements and electronic structure calculations. Finally, the changes in the phonon DOS and the <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> across the low-temperature martensitic phase transformation in Fe 71 Ni 29 are investigated. The respective contributions of the phonons and magnetism to the entropy of the direct and reverse transformation are evaluated from neutron scattering and differential scanning calorimetry measurements.

The difference in <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> of disordered and ordered [ [...] . ] kB/atom at high temperatures. The difference in heat capacity of chemically disordered and [ [...] . ] ordered [ [...] . ] was measured by calorimetry from 70 K - 300 K. By comparing these measured results to a harmonic heat capacity calculated with a Born-von Karman model, we estimate the difference in <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> between disordered and ordered Cu 3 Au to be [ [...] . ] kg/atom at high temperatures. Samples of [ [...] . ] were prepared with two microstructures: 1) with equilibrium [ [...] . ] order, and 2) with partial disorder (having a large [ [...] . ] chemical order parameter, but without the tetragonality of the unit cell). We measured the difference in their heat capacities from 60 K to 325 K and inelastic neutron scattering spectra at four values of Q at 11 K and at 300 K. We describe a microstructural contribution to the anharmonic heat capacity that originates with the anisotropy of the [ [...] . ] structure. We estimate the difference in <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> between partially-disordered and ordered [ [...] . ] to be [ [...] . ] kg/atom at high temperature. The elastic energy stored in the microstructure is about 60 J/mole at low temperatures. The difference in <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> between fcc disordered and hexagonal ordered [ [...] . ] was measured by calorimetry to be [ [...] . ] /atom at high temperatures, with the ordered alloy having the lower <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy.</b> Neutron diffraction data revealed that the observed L 12 region of the phase diagram does not exist, but is a state that can be obtained in quenched alloys. Neutron energy loss spectra were measured for two states of nanophase Fe: 1) as-milled, with a characteristic nanocrystallite size of 12 nm, and 2) annealed, with a characteristic crystallite size of 28 nm. The longitudinal peak in the phonon DOS of the nanophase Fe was broadened {{compared to that of}} the annealed material. We attribute this broadening to short phonon lifetimes in nanocrystals. The nanophase material also showed an enhanced density of states at low energies below 15 meV, which may indicate the presence of inter-crystallite vibrations. These differences in phonon DOS should have only a small effect on the difference in <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> of n. anocrystalline and larger-grained [ [...] . ]. The <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> differences that have been measured are large enough in comparison to 0. 56 [ [...] . ]/atom, the maximum possible difference in configurational entropy for a 3 : 1 atomic ratio, to make a significant contribution to the alloy thermodynami...|$|R
40|$|Inelastic nuclear {{resonant}} scattering {{spectra of}} Fe- 57 atoms were measured on crystalline alloys of Pt 3 Fe- 57 that were chemically disordered, partially ordered, and L 1 (2) ordered. Phonon partial {{density of states}} curves for Fe- 57 were obtained from these spectra. Upon disordering, about 10 % of the spectral intensity underwent a distinct shift from 25 to 19 meV. This change in optical modes accounted {{for most of the}} change of the <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> of disordering contributed by Fe atoms, which was (+ 0. 10 +/- 0. 03) k(B) (Fe atom) (- 1). Prospects for parametrizing the <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> with low-order cluster variables were assessed. To calculate the difference in <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> of the disordered and ordered alloys, the clusters must be large enough to account for the abundances of several of the atom configurations of the first-nearest-neighbor shell about the Fe- 57 atoms...|$|R
40|$|Inelastic neutron {{scattering}} and nuclear resonant inelastic x-ray scattering {{were used to}} determine the phonon densities of states of face-centered-cubic Ni-Fe alloys. Increasing Fe concentration results in an average softening of the phonon modes. Chemical ordering of the Ni_(0. 72) Fe_(0. 28) alloy results in a reduction of the partial <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> of the Fe atoms but does not significantly change the partial <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> of the Ni atoms. Changes in the phonon densities of states with composition and chemical ordering are discussed and analyzed with a cluster expansion method...|$|R
40|$|Inelastic neutron-scattering spectra and neutron-diffraction {{patterns}} were measured on the alloy Co 3 V at temperatures from 1073 - 1513 K, where the hP 24 (ordered hexagonal) and fee structures are the equilibrium {{states of the}} alloy. Phonon density of states (DOS) curves were calculated from the inelastic-scattering spectra, allowing estimates of the <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> in the harmonic and quasiharmonic approximations. The <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> of the hP 24 -fcc phase transition at 1323 K {{was found to be}} 0. 07 k(B) /atom. The anharmonic contributions to the entropy over a temperature range of 100 K were comparable to the <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> of this phase transition. The anharmonic softening of the phonon DOS was only slightly larger for the hP 24 than the fee phase, however, so the anharmonic effects contribute only slightly to the difference in entropy of the two phases. The simple Gruneisen approximation was inadequate for predicting the thermal softening of the phonon DOS...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{chemical}} {{order on the}} <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> have been studied using firstprinciples and semi-empirical potential methods. Pseudopotential calculations on the Pd 3 V system show that the <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> decreases by 0. 07 k B upon disordering in the high-temperature limit. The decrease in entropy contradicts what would be expected from simple bonding arguments, but {{can be explained by}} the influence of size effects on the vibrations. In addition, the embeddedatom method is used to study the effects of local environments on the entropic contributions of individual Ni and Al atoms in Ni 3 Al. It is found that increasing numbers of Al nearest neighbours decreases the <b>vibrational</b> <b>entropy</b> of an atom when relaxations are not included. When the system is relaxed, this effect disappears, and the local entropy is approximately uniform with increasing number of Al neighbours. These results are explained in terms of the large size mismatch between Ni and Al. In addition, a local cl [...] ...|$|R
