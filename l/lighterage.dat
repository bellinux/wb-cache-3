25|$|By 1869, the Shropshire Union had a {{thriving}} business carrying goods from a base at Chester Basin, Liverpool, across the River Mersey to Ellesmere Port and Birkenhead. The LNWR was {{also involved in}} cross-river trade, using private carriers, and this {{was transferred to the}} Shropshire Union in 1870, after they had suggested it. The company bought out the <b>lighterage</b> business of William Oulton in 1870, moved their base from Chester Basin to Manchester Basin, and bought the Mersey Carrying Co in 1883. Under the terms of the lease with the LNWR, the company was limited in the types of goods they could carry, and although they made a healthy operating profit until the late 1860s, this did not cover the interest on debts or dividends. Between 1850 and 1870, receipts had risen from £104,638 to £145,976, but costs had risen much faster, and the average surplus had fallen from £45,885 to £11,717. Most of the income was generated by their carrying business, rather than by tolls for use of the canal network.|$|E
25|$|Tobruk {{is capable}} of embarking between 300 and 520 {{soldiers}} (extended duration versus short term), along with 1,300 tons of cargo or 330 lane metres of vehicles (equivalent to 18 Leopard 1 or M1 Abrams main battle tanks plus 40 M113 armored personnel carriers or Australian Light Armoured Vehicles). Vehicles and cargo can be embarked via bow or stern ramps, with the reinforced tank-deck running {{the length of the}} ship, and inter-deck transfer ramps fitted. The bow ramp is contained behind horizontal-opening bow doors, and can be extended and lowered for beach or harbour loading, while at the stern a combined door-ramp can be used conventionally when at suitable facilities, or for ramp-to-ramp loading of landing craft at sea. Additional cargo handling is provided by the 70-tonne Velle heavy lift derrick (a feature singled out for attention in Jane's Fighting Ships), supplemented by two 8.5-tonne Favco cranes. Two LCM-8 landing craft can be carried in cradles on the main deck, while two LCVP are carried in derricks on the superstructure. Two Naval <b>Lighterage</b> Equipment pontoons can be carried on the ship's flanks to extend the reach of the bow ramp when beaching, or as rafts to transport cargo ashore. The ship has an aft helicopter platform capable of handling aircraft up to Sea King size, while the main deck (once cleared of landing craft and cargo) {{can be used as a}} secondary flight deck for helicopters up to Chinook size. Both flight decks can be operated simultaneously, and both have capability for landed or at-hover refuelling.|$|E

2500|$|Montford Point began {{a series}} of Post-Delivery Tests and Trials (PDT) events {{beginning}} in April 2014 that took place over several months, which included an Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT) end-to-end event to determine operational effectiveness and the week-long Pacific Horizon 2015 humanitarian assistance and disaster relief exercise. [...] The tests demonstrated her ability to interface with cargo ships, including the LMSR using the Vehicle Transfer Ramp (VTR) and the JHSV with its vehicle ramp, and the Improved Navy <b>Lighterage</b> System to offload equipment onto it to be moved to shore by LCACs, reducing the need for use of a foreign port. Initial Operating Capability (IOC) is expected in April 2015.|$|E
6000|$|... "What sort of nonsense?" [...] {{wondered}} {{the chief}} engineer. [...] "I found the Capataz always a very shrewd and sensible fellow, absolutely fearless, and remarkably useful. A perfect handy man. Sir John was greatly {{impressed by his}} resourcefulness and attention when he made that overland journey from Sta. Marta. Later on, as you might have heard, he rendered us a service by disclosing to the then chief of police the presence {{in the town of}} some professional thieves, who came from a distance to wreck and rob our monthly pay train. He has certainly organized the <b>lighterage</b> service of the harbour for the O.S.N. Company with great ability. He knows how to make himself obeyed, foreigner though he is. It is true that the Cargadores are strangers here, too, for the most part--immigrants, Islenos." ...|$|E
6000|$|Regarded by the O. S. N. Company {{as an old}} and {{faithful}} servant, Captain Mitchell was allowed to attain the term of his usefulness in ease and dignity {{at the head of}} the enormously extended service. The augmentation of the establishment, with its crowds of clerks, an office in town, the old office in the harbour, the division into departments--passenger, cargo, <b>lighterage,</b> and so on--secured a greater leisure for his last years in the regenerated Sulaco, the capital of the Occidental Republic. Liked by the natives for his good nature and the formality of his manner, self-important and simple, known for years as a [...] "friend of our country," [...] he felt himself a personality of mark in the town. Getting up early for a turn in the market-place while the gigantic shadow of Higuerota was still lying upon the fruit and flower stalls piled up with masses of gorgeous colouring, attending easily to current affairs, welcomed in houses, greeted by ladies on the Alameda, with his entry into all the clubs and a footing in the Casa Gould, he led his privileged old bachelor, man-about-town existence with great comfort and solemnity. But on mail-boat days he was down at the Harbour Office at an early hour, with his own gig, manned by a smart crew in white and blue, ready to dash off and board the ship directly she showed her bows between the harbour heads.|$|E

50|$|Bombing {{during the}} Blitz of World War II {{severely}} damaged the docks, {{and by the}} 1960s, newer container technology and relocation to Tilbury had made the lightermen's trade, <b>lighterage,</b> obsolete. In terminal decline most up-river docks had been abandoned by the 1980s. Some waterman encouraged by Festival of Britain 1951 set up river cruise companies in the late 1940s others in the 1980s but by careful consolidation of ownership and concentrating on passenger comfort, some offering night cruises, have successfully dominated the sector on into the new millennium. In the <b>lighterage</b> sector Cory Environmental, originally an amalgamation of eight companies, bucked the trend of this traditionally fragmented industry by capitalizing on an opportunity and used its empty coal barges, on return trips, to transport rubbish from London's streets generating enough extra revenue to buy up surplus barges from smaller <b>lighterage</b> companies as they sold up. Between 1967 and 1976 over 40 <b>lighterage</b> firms closed down.|$|E

50|$|The fading {{fortunes}} of the Croydon gold mines {{in the early twentieth}} century had significant impact on the economy of Normanton, as did the construction of a railway between Townsville and the copper mines of Cloncurry in 1908.

By 1920 the Carpentaria <b>Lighterage</b> Company withdrew from the Gulf trade and two lighters, the Atlas and Hercules were sold to the Shire Councils of Normanton and Burketown.
