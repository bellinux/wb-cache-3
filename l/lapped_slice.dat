40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology for predicting the thresholds of multiple site damage and widespread fatigue damage in fuselage <b>lap</b> <b>slices.</b> Widespread fatigue damage {{is a type}} of multiple cracking that reduces the airframe residual strength to a level below the damage tolerant requirement. The MSD threshold refers to the point in the lifetime of an airplane when two adjacent collinear fatigue cracks can linkup at the allowable stress. The WFD threshold is the point in time when linkup of a primary crack created from accidental damage and secondary cracks created from fatigue can result in a catastrophic failure. The methodology presented in this paper combines results from residual strength analysis and fatigue crack growth testing to determine these thresholds. In particular, a displacement compatibility approach is adopted to calculate residual strength in curved stiffened panels tested in the laboratory. The laboratory experiments also include fatigue testing of full-scale panels containing a debonded <b>lap</b> <b>slice.</b> Based on this methodology, the threshold of widespread fatigue damage for these laboratory panels, adjusted to zero minimum-stress cycling, is between 32, 000 and 40, 000 cycles, and the threshold of multiple site damage is about 70, 000 cycles...|$|R
5000|$|Hamilton {{later wrote}} of his childhood: Alexander Hamilton's gentle nature {{rendered}} his house a joyous one to his children... His intercourse {{with his children}} was always affectionate and confiding, which excited in them a corresponding confidence and devotion. I distinctly recollect the scene at breakfast {{in the front room}} of the house in Broadway. My dear mother, seated as was her wont {{at the head of the}} table with a napkin in her <b>lap,</b> cutting <b>slices</b> of bread and spreading them with butter for the younger boys... When the lessons were finished the father and the elder children were called to breakfast, after which the boys were packed off to school.|$|R
50|$|Sa are salad-like {{dishes from}} {{northern}} Thailand which {{can use a}} similar chilli and spice paste as the northern Thai <b>lap,</b> but with <b>sliced</b> raw shallots and garlic added into the dish. Two of the numerous variations are sa phli, which is made with uncooked sliced banana flowers, and sa chin, with sliced raw buffalo meat. Sa taengkwa however, which is made with cucumber, doesn't use the lap spice mix but instead a mix of shrimp paste, roasted fermented soy bean and boiled fermented fish.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{connection}} of reinforcing steel is accomplished because the length limitation {{of production and}} condition. Regulations have not recommended explicitly or prohibit {{a particular kind of}} connections. The use of mechanical connections configuration and the lap splice connections were developed in this study. Reviews of research are not only including technical aspects of strength and integrity of structural elements, but also observe the ease of manufacture and implementation. Research program is conducted by reviewing the configuration of <b>lap</b> <b>slice</b> length and the amount of clamp which has been used. The research of connections is reviewed in conditions of bare bar which embedded in concrete beams. The bare bar conditions did as if reinforcement tensile test, which the variable is the number of clamp with a lap splice configuration 1 clamp+lap splice 6, 34 db and 2 clamp+lap splice 6, 34 db. Application of the connections is made through 5 kinds of bending beam specimen which its reinforced connections is made on appeal bar diameter (db) = 16 mm, the variable of joints is lap splice 6, 34 db, 1 clamp+lap splice 6, 34 db, 2 clamp+lap splice 6, 34 db, 2 clamp+lap splice 19, 016 db, and it as a control beam without connection. Concrete quality, steel quality, and tightening boults of clamp are fixed variables. The research has resulted clamp force which increased significantly sized up ± 100 % of its number, the most optimum number use 2 clamps, the strength of lap splice raise keep up with its length. The minimum configuration is best used 2 clamps with length minimum of lap splice 11, 41 db. The stiffness of five specimens indicated high equivalence with R² = 0, 931 but the ductility of bar with lap splice connection 6, 34 db is not equivalent compare with bar without connections, it’s only 22 %. From the result of research, we can conclude that the connection variant has a huge potential to be used, however it still needs to be re -observed because it still has weakness of its ductility, next the subsequent research needs to be carried out by improving the quality of clamp material with the most optimum length of lap splice...|$|R
50|$|There was {{a six-week}} gap before the San Marino round, at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari near Bologna in Italy; {{a number of}} changes were made {{to most of the}} cars during this period. An almost {{identical}} grid to Brazil saw Senna, Berger, Patrese, Boutsen, Mansell and Prost line up after qualifying. At the start, Senna and Berger got away well but Boutsen sliced ahead of Patrese to take third with Mansell and Prost behind. Boutsen passed Berger on lap 2. On the next <b>lap,</b> a stone <b>sliced</b> through Senna's wheelrim, spinning him into a sand trap and out of the race. Boutsen pulled away from Berger but his engine blew on lap 18.|$|R
50|$|The third start {{was clean}} and Senna took the lead ahead of Berger, Prost, Boutsen, Patrese and Nannini. On lap 11, Mansell went into the pits with {{handling}} problems; he went back out but retired eight laps later. On <b>lap</b> 14, Prost <b>sliced</b> ahead of Berger who then pitted for tyres. Senna and Prost, separated by 2 seconds stopped {{at the same time}} but then Nannini who was planning to go without stopping came in between them. Then both Patrese and Boutsen went out with gearbox troubles. Prost passed Nannini and Berger tried the same but this time Nannini came back at him to keep the place. On lap 41, Nannini went wide and Berger sailed through to take third. Senna duly won from Prost, Berger, Nannini, Piquet and Gugelmin.|$|R
50|$|Mark Petch Motorsport {{was formed}} in 1985 by former New Zealand National Championship winner Mark Petch who by 1985 had become a wealthy {{designer}} and manufacturer of industrial seals. A Volvo 240T was imported from Belgium and debuted at the 1985 Wellington 500 with Robbie Francevic and former Works Volvo driver Michel Delcourt taking victory despite the car not arriving in time for qualifying and only turning in {{a small number of}} laps in the final practice session. Their non-appearance in qualifying resulted in the car starting {{from the rear of the}} field, though within approximately 5 <b>laps</b> Delcourt had <b>sliced</b> through the field to be in 5th place Francevic then drove the car in the 1985 Australian Touring Car Championship recording wins at Symmons Plains and Oran Park before teaming with John Bowe at the Sandown 500 and Bathurst 1000.|$|R
5|$|Their embittered {{season ended}} as many pundits had feared. In the Japanese Grand Prix {{at the end}} of lap 46, Senna made his move at the Casino Chicane. Prost, turning into the corner, turned into his teammate's path {{resulting}} in a collision and the cars sliding interlocked down the escape road. Prost, thinking the World Championship was over, climbed out of his stalled car. To separate the cars, the marshals pushed Senna's McLaren backwards onto the track. This left it in a dangerous position, so they pushed it forwards again. As they did so, Senna bump-started the engine. He drove through the chicane and rejoined. The nose of his car was damaged and he had to pit, but he rejoined only five seconds behind the Benetton of Alessandro Nannini. On <b>lap</b> 50, Ayrton <b>sliced</b> past Nannini at the chicane to take the lead and won the race. But it was Nannini who appeared on the top step of the podium, race officials having excluded Senna for missing the chicane. McLaren appealed the decision, but the FIA Court of Appeal not only upheld the decision but fined Senna US$100,000 and gave him a suspended six-month ban. Thus Prost clinched his third driver's title in controversial circumstances.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the final}} {{race of the}} 2016 season, the title rivals took their 14th front-row lockout with Hamilton having out {{qualified}} championship leader Rosberg by one-third of a second. During the race, both Mercedes started well and maintained their respectively position. Hamilton moved clear from the field while Rosberg had a lengthly pit stop for preventing an unsafe release thus unfortunately lost a position to Verstappen. Rosberg followed Verstappen for the next 12 <b>laps,</b> before finally <b>slicing</b> past the Red Bull. Rosberg then set a numerous number of fastest laps to cut down Hamilton's advantage, while title rival - Hamilton, started his tactics - in his bid {{to have a chance}} to secure his 4th title, by trying to back his teammate up into the clutch of Verstappen. Vettel joined the group by using alternative strategy - using supersoft tyres, he then made the pass on Verstappen, thus Hamilton, Rosberg, Vettel, and Verstappen were separated by less than 3 seconds. Hamilton was told numerous times via team radio to speed up due to risk of jeopardising the win. Hamilton ignored and disobeyed team radio instructions and continued backing his teammate up. Eventually, Hamilton took the chequered flag by 0.4s from Rosberg, while Rosberg defended well from the fast coming Vettel by another 0.4s, while Verstappen took fourth, just 0.8s behind Vettel. [...] From this result, although Hamilton took his 10th win of the season but had lost the Drivers' Championship by 5 points. (Hamilton: 380 points; as compared to Rosberg: 385 points), therefore Rosberg was crowned as the 2016 Formula One World Drivers' Champion, his maiden and only title.|$|R
40|$|Semiconductor {{devices are}} the {{building}} blocks of electronics and communication technology in the modern world. The charge, mass and spin of charge carriers in the semiconductor devices lay the foundations of the technology developments in the modern age. But to date only the electronic charge of the semiconductors has been exploited for such applications. The significance of the spin of charge carriers is completely ignored because in a semiconductor the half of the carriers are in spin-up state and the remainder are in spin-down state. A new electronics termed as spintronics, spin-transport based electronics, is focused to utilise the spin degree of freedom of the charge carriers in addition to its electronic charge. The devices based on these have the potential for various technological advancements like non-volatility, increased data processing speed, decreased electronic power consumption and increased integration densities as compared to the conventional semiconductor devices. In this study, the author intended to study the growth and properties of magnetic impurity doped antimony based III-V compounds and compare these results with those of the films grown by MBE. This thesis is organised into seven chapters. The first introductory chapter gives a brief review of the work on spintronics, diluted magnetic semiconductors, Ferromagnetic / paramagnetic semiconductor hybrid structures with special emphasis on the properties of antimonides which have already been reported in the literature. This is followed by the scope of the thesis. The second chapter deals with technical details of various instruments used in the present research work. Third chapter describes the growth and structural properties of bulk crystals grown by Bridgman method and thin films grown by liquid phase epitaxy (LPE). Bulk crystals of InSb and GaSb doped with magnetic elements such as Mn and Fe are grown with different doping concentrations. Thin films of InSb and GaSb doped Mn with different doping concentrations are grown by LPE. The grown crystals are processed by <b>slicing,</b> <b>lapping,</b> polishing and chemical etching methods. X-ray diffraction studies are carried out to confirm alloy formation and to find the change in lattice parameter if any. From the powder diffraction patterns, the lattice parameter is refined with the help of Retvield refinement program. A systematic change of lattice parameter with the incorporation of magnetic impurities into InSb and GaSb is observed. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray analysis are carried out to identify the secondary phases and their composition respectively. Chapter 4 gives the detailed magnetotransport studies carried out on InSb and GaSb crystals doped with Mn and Fe. Also, the magnetotransport studies carried out on thin films grown by liquid phase epitaxy are presented here. This chapter is divided into three sections of which the first section deals with Mn doped bulk crystals of InSb and GaSb, the second section deals with Fe doped bulk crystals of InSb and GaSb and the third section deals with Mn doped InSb and GaSb films grown on GaAs by Liquid Phase Epitaxy. Temperature dependence of zero field resistivity, magnetoresistance and Hall measurements are carried out from 1. 4 to 300 K. All the samples show p type conduction throughout the temperature range studied except for Fe doped InSb. Mn doped crystals show negative magnetoresistance and anomalous Hall effect below 10 K. Anisotropy in magnetoresistance is also observed at low temperatures in InMnSb crystals. On the other hand, Fe doped samples exhibit positive magnetoresistance throughout the temperature range and no anomalous Hall effect is observed. Chapter 5 describes the magnetic properties of bulk InMnSb, GaMnSb, InFeSb and GaFeSb crystals so also the thin films of InMnSb/GaAs. DC magnetization measurements are carried out in the temperature range 2 - 300 K. The Mn doped InSb and GaSb crystals as well as InMnSb/GaAs films, show a magnetic ordering below 10 K which could arise from the InMnSb and GaMnSb alloy formation. Also, saturation in magnetization observed even at room temperature suggests the existence of ferromagnetic MnSb clusters in the crystals which has been verified by scanning electron microscopy studies. In Fe doped InSb crystals, the temperature dependent DC magnetization shows irreversibility under field cooled and zero field cooled conditions below 12 K, suggesting a spin glass-like behaviour. Also, magnetization measurement shows the coexistence of ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases throughout the temperature range studied. Existence of ferromagnetic phase could arise from secondary phases Fe 1 -xInx or FeSb 2 present in the crystal as clusters and paramagnetic phase could arise from the randomly distributed Fe atoms in the InSb matrix. Fe doped GaSb crystals show interesting magnetic property that arises from the FeGa alloy (secondary phase) present in it. The EPR studies on Ga 0. 98 Mn 0. 02 Sb cluster-free (?) crystal suggest that the dominant Mn impurity in GaMnSb is Mn 2 + (d 5), described as ionized acceptor A−. This conclusion was derived from EPR experiments, which reveal a strong absorption line with an effective g factor very close to 2. 00, the value typical for centre A−. The absence of EPR signal typical for neutral Mn acceptor A 0 suggests that this center is absent in the crystal under investigation. The observed behavior {{is similar to that of}} Ga 1 -xMnxAs and In 1 -xMnxAs epilayers. EPR studies also reveal that the competition between antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic phases exists in the studied crystal. Chapter 6 describes the optical measurements carried out on bulk Ga 1 -xMnxSb crystals and their films with different Mn doping concentrations. FTIR studies are carried out in the temperature range 4 - 300 K. From the FTIR studies, it is found that intra valance spin – orbit splitting band absorption is dominant compared to the fundamental absorption in doped crystals. In higher doped crystals (x > 0. 01), fundamental band absorption merges with split-off band and could not be resolved. Free carrier absorption studies are also carried out in the energy range below the band gap. FTIR studies on GaMnSb/GaAs films suggest band gap narrowing effect due to Mn doping. Furthermore the Photoluminescence measurements are carried out in the temperature range 10 – 300 K for all the Mn doped GaSb crystals. PL studies also support the band gap narrowing and band filling effects. A comprehensive summary of this research investigation and scope for the further work are presented in the last chapter...|$|R
