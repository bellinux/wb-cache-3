The problems range from undetectable items inserted in the body to external equipment that needlessly hides detail on radiographs. The variety and absolute numbers of such devices used in patient care and monitoring are rapidly increasing. Some voluntary standardsfor radiologic detectability exist, but there is no organized method for the dissemination of these stand-ards. A surprising variety of important devices are invisible or poorly opaque, ensuring lack of detection by radiography. These include venous catheters, vascular grafts, heart valve and breast prostheses, feeding tubes, and even ventricula...|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss a}} {{combinatorial}} interdependence between the maximal number of nonredundant symbols on n objects, if these {{elements of a}} set are looked at as a commutative and – {{at the same time}} – as a sequenced assembly. We generate combinations of partitions on a set (= "structures on a set"; = "multidimensional partitions") and compare the maximal number of distinct structures on a set (= "n?") to the maximal number of distinct sequences that the elements of the set can be ordered into (= "n!"). We find that max(n?,n!) =f(n). Switching between the longitudinal and the transversal way of storing information appears to allow inroads towards understanding some puzzling phenomena {{in a wide variety of}} fields. Specifically, we propose an explanation why FOUR distinct <b>logical</b> <b>markers</b> are used in the DNA by a number theoretical innovation. In the present paper, we concentrate on an important combinatorial detail which allows classifying (categorising, grouping) sets according to the maximal extent of inner disjunction of their subsets. We renumber the set N into a System M. We are still with additions of natural numbers (partitions), but select some, for which the translation function m(n) yields also. t. For these, m(n) = Sum(m(ni)) above and beside n = Sum(ni). We look into possible uses of. d. (doubly /or more/. t.) sentences on N. Categories and Subject Descriptors: Combinatorics, number theory, disjunction operator, symmetry definitions, size-invariant translations. Key Words and Phrases: truth level. i. > 1; dissimilarity of parts of the whole, natural constants, extent of possibly being otherwis...|$|R
40|$|When {{students}} and teacher talk with each other, {{there is usually}} {{a high degree of}} collaboration and frequent turn-taking. However, when students are required to produce more extended speech, {{in the form of a}} description, narration or opinion, there is less support from the teacher and a greater burden on students because they have to package the discourse in a logical and coherent manner. Students, however, often produce extended discourse that lacks coherence due to a number of miscues in the areas of <b>logical</b> connection, discourse <b>markers,</b> syntactic incorporation and lexical specifi city. This paper investigates these miscues and shows how they interact with each other to lead to incoherence, through a number of examples. A discussion of the implications for ELT is given...|$|R
30|$|Vande Kopple’s (1985) {{classification}} for meta-discourse included textual {{and interpersonal}} main categories. Textual meta-discourse constituted text connectives, code glosses, validity markers, and narrators. Interpersonal meta-discourse also included illocution markers, attitude markers, and commentaries. Crismore et al. (1993) then provided a revised categorization of meta-discourse, including two major categories of textual and interpersonal. However, textual component was subdivided into textual <b>markers</b> (<b>logical</b> connectives, sequencers, reminders, and topicalizers) and interpretive markers (code glosses, illocution markers, and announcements). The interpersonal aspect was also reorganized into hedges, certainty markers, attributors, attitude markers, and commentary. Hyland (2005) also proposed a models which comprises two major categories, including interactive MDMs, which concern the writer’s awareness of {{and attention to}} his readers and interactional MDMs, which refer to writer’s attempts to make his views more explicit for the readers.|$|R
40|$|The line of argumentation in a well-structured {{argumentative}} text {{or academic}} essay should exhibit <b>logical</b> continuity. Conjunction <b>markers</b> {{are one of}} the resources that writers can use to achieve this objective. By means of conjunction markers, the idea world is represented in a coherent fashion. The present article presents a corpus linguistic investigation into the possible quantitative and qualitative differences in the use of conjunction markers in the academic essays and journal articles of postgraduate students and published researchers respectively, in the area of Afrikaans language and literary studies. The findings are that the quantitative differences between the corpora are small, while the qualitative differences imply that students use some conjunction markers in a more speech-like or informal way. Students also use the high frequency conjunction markers even more, while researchers make more frequent use of the low frequency conjunction markers. In spite of this, the finding is that the differences between the student and researcher corpora are not statistically significant as far as the majority of conjunction markers are concerned.

40|$|Background: Topical {{imiquimod}} {{is sometimes}} used for lentigo maligna (LM) in situ melanoma instead of surgery, but frequency of cure is uncertain. Pathological complete regression (pCR) is a <b>logical</b> surrogate <b>marker</b> for cure after imiquimod, although residual LM and atypical melanocytic hyperplasia {{may not be}} reliably distinguished. A trial comparing imiquimod vs. surgery might be justified by a high imiquimod pCR rate. Objectives: Primary: to estimate the pCR rate for LM following imiquimod. Secondary: to assess the accuracy of prediction of pCR, using clinical complete regression (cCR) plus negative post-treatment biopsies, tolerability, resource use, patients' preferences and induced melanoma immunity. Methods: This was a single-arm phase II trial of 60 imiquimod applications over 12 weeks for LM then radical resection. A pCR rate ≥ 25 out of 33 would reliably discriminate between pCR rates < 60 % and ≥ 85 %. Clinical response was assessed and biopsies taken after imiquimod. Patients recorded adverse events in diaries. Patient preference was measured after surgery using a standard gamble tool. Results: The pCR rate was 10 of 27 (37 %, 95 % confidence interval 19 - 58 %). The rate of cCR plus negative biopsies was 12 of 28, of whom seven of 11 had pCR on subsequent surgery. The median dose intensity was 86 · 7 %. Of the 16 surveyed patients, eight preferred primary imiquimod over surgery if the cure rate for imiquimod was 80 %, and four of 16 if it was ≤ 40 %. Conclusions: The pCR rate was insufficient to justify phase III investigation of imiquimod vs. Surgery: Clinical complete response and negative targeted biopsies left uncertainty regarding pathological clearance. Some patients would trade less aggressive treatment of LM against efficacy...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate the misuses of two main categories of metadiscourse markers used by a group of university students. To this end, 50 EFL learners of intermediate language proficiency level were chosen by means of administering a TOEFL proficiency test. The participants were female junior students majoring in English literature at Kerman Azad University. These learners were regarded as intermediate ones scoring 400 - 550 in the proficiency test. Then, the learners were provided with an argumentative topic to write a 250 -word essay in 45 minutes. The number of misuses of metadiscourse markers were counted with regard to their use of textual and interpersonal markers of this kind, and the subcategories of textual (<b>logical</b> connectives, frame <b>markers,</b> endophoric markers, evidentials, and code glosses), and the subcategories of interpersonal metadiscourse markers (hedges, emphatics, attitude markers, relational markers, and person markers). Moreover, different classifications of misuses were explored. The results of Chi-square analysis indicated that misuses of metadiscourse makers can be due to overuse of these <b>markers</b> (e. g. <b>logical</b> connective and person markers), punctuation,interlingua, and intralinguaerrors. Finally, using a Pearson correlation to investigate the correlation between the participants’ TOEFL score and essay score, it was concluded that language proficiency has a positive relationship with the uses of metadiscourse markers and essays quality...|$|R
