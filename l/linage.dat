25|$|Percussionist Evelyn Glennie has {{collaborated with}} Björk {{and can be}} heard playing the marimba on Post and Telegram, as well as Oxygen. Thompson Twins {{included}} marimba in their many 1980s works. Jack White played marimba on The Nurse, a song on The White Stripes' album Get Behind Me Satan. In 2003, Marina Calzado <b>Linage</b> recorded an album bridging the gap between academic and popular music, Marimba de Buenos Aires, featuring music by Ástor Piazzolla. In 2009, Canadian musician Spencer Krug, working under the moniker Moonface, released a 20-minute continuous piece called Dreamland EP: Marimba And Shit-Drums with Jagjaguwar. The recording consists entirely of marimba, drums and vocals and comprises many movements and recurring themes. Vincent Montana Jr. played the marimba {{on one of the}} great socially conscious soul songs of the early 1970s People Make the World Go Round by The Stylistics. The experimental band Coil (band) used the marimba in its later performances such as Selvaggina, Go Back into the Woods and studio albums The Ape of Naples and Black Antlers.|$|E

Later research on Euoplocephalus indicates that forward and sideways jaw movement was possible in these animals, the skull being able to withstand considerable forces. A 2016 study of the dental occlusion (contact between the teeth) of ankylosaur specimens found that the ability for backwards (palinal) jaw movement evolved independently in different ankylosaur <b>linages,</b> including Late Cretaceous North American ankylosaurids like Ankylosaurus and Euoplocephalus.|$|R

50|$|At a {{molecular}} level, {{expression of the}} gene RUNX1 is upregulated by the RUNX1 intronic cis-regulatory element (+23 RUNX1 enhancer).

As mentioned before, the main role of RUNX1 is to modulate the fate of haematopoietic cells. This {{can be achieved by}} binding to the thrombopoietin (TPO) recaptor/ c-Mpl promoter, followed by the recruitment of transcription activators or repressors in order to promote transition of the hemogenic endothelium to HSCs, or differentiation into <b>linages</b> of lower haematopoetic hierarchies.
