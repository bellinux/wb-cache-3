50|$|With {{the double}} tracking, barrier arms were {{installed}} for vehicular traffic on Collins avenue and pedestrian cribs provided. However, because northbound trains stopping at Linden lead to prolonged {{operation of the}} flashing lights, bells, and barrier arms, and a second train approaching can also keep the warning alarms operating for long periods, many pedestrians became habitual risk takers. The cribs were also poorly designed forcing some pedestrians to walk with {{their backs to the}} trains before stepping onto the railway line. A series of pedestrian deaths at Collins Avenue followed. This led to the installation of second train <b>coming</b> <b>indicators</b> and, in the late 1980s, to longer pedestrian cribs that ensured pedestrians always faced oncoming trains and took sufficient steps to look up and see approaching trains before stepping onto the railway line. There have been no pedestrian deaths since the installation of the longer cribs.|$|R
5000|$|Throughout the world, {{interest}} was {{growing in the}} prospect of direct city-to-city transport. The market for the Rotodyne {{was that of a}} medium-haul [...] "flying bus": It would take off vertically from an inner-city heliport, with all <b>lift</b> <b>coming</b> from the tip-jet driven rotor, and then would increase airspeed, eventually with all power from the engines being transferred to the propellers with the rotor autorotating. In this mode, the collective pitch, and hence drag, of the rotor could be reduced, as the wings would be taking as much as half of the craft's weight. The Rotodyne would then cruise at speeds of about 150 kn (280 km/h) to another city, e.g., London to Paris, where the rotor tip-jet system would be restarted for landing vertically in the city centre. When the Rotodyne landed and the rotor stopped moving, its blades drooped downward from the hub. To avoid striking the vertical stabilisers on startup, the tips of these fins were angled down to the horizontal. They were raised once the rotor had spun up.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis research demonstrated that a vertical takeoff and landing aircraft capable of transitioning to conventional flight using cross-flow fans is possible. In particular, {{the design and}} manufacture of a wing-embedded cross-flow fan airfoil, and its implementation into an aircraft, was conducted. The design was developed based on the Gottingen 570 airfoil and generated lift coefficients of four [...] {{greater than the sum}} of the parts [...] due to the fundamental coupling between the wing and cross-flow fan. The wing was characterized with Ansys' CFX solver over tip-speed ratios of zero (hover) to infinity (glide), and predicted a hover angle of 36 ¼ with 56 % of the <b>lift</b> <b>coming</b> from the airfoil. This meant that a full 90 ¼ rotation was not required to go from hover to forward flight; additionally, even while hovering, {{more than half of the}} lift was generated by the airfoil. The airfoil was manufactured from pre-impregnated carbon fiber using a mold produced by 3 D printing. Printer filament selection was based on glass transition temperature and printability. ABS filament was chosen due to its high temperature resistance and relative ease of 3 D printing. The aircraft was configured with all the wing assemblies facing the same direction to favor faster forward flight. This differed from previous designs, which used symmetry to increase stability. Controlled untethered flight was successful. Outstanding ThesisEnsign, United States Nav...|$|R

In order to test whether centrality correlates with urban values, a regression model is used departing from data of Metropolitan Barcelona, such a method allows for controlling architectural variables that influence residential housings, as well as other locational factors beyond centrality that may affect land values. The results suggest that urban form does influence the spatial distribution of urban values; nevertheless such an impact is not as high as other locative factors such as socioresidential segregation. So urban policies intended to democratize urban quality should be focused not only in urban structural factors but also those regarding social differentiation of space...|$|R

We estimate these relationships using three classes of models: the traditional per capita income-pollution level - Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) - specifications, a more inclusive model containing main socioeconomic variables such as agricultural intensity, land use, ethnic composition, population density and educational attainment, and a model that includes the socioeconomic variables while accounting for spatial correlations too. For most water quality indicators, we do not find support for EKC specifications. For pollutants like phosphorus and total suspended solids, the level of agricultural activity is a significant determinant of water quality in California, but for other surface water pollutants commonly considered agricultural pollutants, such as ammonia and nitrate, the level of agricultural activity is not statistically significant. We find that education, ethnic composition, age structure, land use, population density, and water area are all significantly correlated with various indicators of water quality.

This river runs through agricultural area of the Central Bohemian Uplands and as a right-hand side tributary it flows into the Vltava river, in particular to Slapy reservoir. According to the data of concentration of <b>indicators</b> <b>coming</b> from monitored profiles of the State public enterprise Povodí Vltavy which were completed by our own monitoring profile the quality of water has been analyzed. Furthermore, the effect of Mastník on the water quality in Slapy reservoir has been evaluated. It was discovered that the steps that are being taken, mainly construction of sewage treatment plants, are leading to gradual improvement of quality of the surface water. Nowadays the final quality of water is influenced by growing concentration of chlorophyll. This growth is caused by warmer waters and that leads to higher eutrofisation of rivers in the catchment area. The most significant eutrofisation is showing in the creek of Mastník where it's affected by Slapy reservoir. In [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Background: According to {{some studies}} in the western countries, % 12. 7 of total female cancers and % 9. 8 of all deaths {{resulted}} from cancers in the females are due to genital system carcinoma.  Methods: The present analytic cross sectional study was done on the cancer registry data of Yazd province {{for the evaluation of}} trend of genital carcinoma occurrence amongst females from 2006 to 2010. The trend of cancer incidence was calculated according to age, year of occurrence, family history, income, and job and residence place. Data was analyzed using student T-test and chi-square test.  Findings: There were seen higher percentages of cancer amongst age above 50 years, married women and householders. Majority of those had education level of primary (% 40. 5) and moderate income level (% 49. 6). The highest incidence rate was related to year 2010 (% 30) and uterus cancers including body & endometrial was more common than others (% 42. 7). The association between cancer incidence and age (p<. 001) also disease occurrence and marital status (p=. 03) were seen statistically significant. Cancers of uterus and cervix among subjects with age above 50 and cancer of ovary among females under 30 years was more common.  Conclusion: our results showed that the incidence rate of genital carcinoma amongst Yazdi females has had a increasing trend from 2006 to 2010 and socio- economic factors had significant role in the causation of cancer.

However, the musculo-skeletal problems were found to be abundantly present with pain in 91 &#x 0025; of the subjects. Region-wise mapping of pain revealed that postural pain in low back was present in 47 &#x 0025; while in neck was 19 &#x 0025;. Scapular muscles on the right side were involved in stabilizing shoulder, which never went overhead. On the contrary, left shoulder was raised as high (> 90 degrees) in spinning action, while pulling thread. This muscle work involved trapezius, deltoid and triceps action concentrically in <b>lifting</b> and while <b>coming</b> to starting position slowly, eccentrically. There was no pause since the wheel continued to spin the thread continuously, unless a worker opted to stop the work.

A procedure for multiparameter data quality control is described. Then we explain why the seafloor is an interesting observation point for geophysical parameters and how it differs from land sites. We consider four interesting geophysical phenomena found at the EMSO sites {{that are related to}} geo-hazard. In the first case, we show how unknown seismicity and landslides in the Western Ionian Sea were identified and roughly localised through a single-sensor analysis based on the seismometer. In the second case, we concentrate on the problem of near-coast tsunami generation and describe a Tsunami Early Warning Detection (TEWD) system, tested in the Western Iberian Margin and currently operating in real time at the Western Ionian site. In the third case, we consider two large volcanoes in the central Mediterranean area, Mt. Etna and the Marsili seamount. Signals from the seismometer and gravimeter recorded at the seafloor at 2100 m b. s. l. show various phases of Mt. Etna's 2002 – 2003 eruption.

40|$|In modern times, {{imprisonment}} {{has been}} established as punishment and not for punishment, {{which means that the}} only right that is suspended has to do with freedom of movement. Nevertheless, serving a sentence in Chilean prisons has become a form of continuous punishment that extends far beyond the mere deprivation of liberty. Indeed, Chilean prisons have been criticized for their levels of overcrowding, lack of access to rehabilitative programs, and for their levels of mistreatment towards inmates. In addition, violence has become a common, daily reality in many facilities throughout the country. Its occurrence is problematic not only because it threats security and order inside prisons, but also because it undermines any attempt to successfully develop rehabilitative initiatives inside prison walls. Despite that prison violence has been studied in developed nations, much remains unanswered for developing countries. Thus, this dissertation will try to fill part of this gap by analyzing the correlates of violent events in Chilean prisons as well as by examining which theory of prison violence (among deprivation, administrative-control and importation) seemed to better explain the study’s results. In order to do that, this study employed a combination of both administrative data from the Chilean Bureau of Prisons (Gendarmería de Chile) and some results of the First National Survey on Inmates’ Perception of Quality of Life, conducted in 2013 (Sanhueza, in press). Anchored in the literature review and on empirical findings on prison violence, this study included six representative <b>indicators</b> <b>coming</b> for the three theories tested, while controlling for total inmate population size.

The study of the quality against the background (short range forecast) indicates a potential to use the QI, as a selection criteria within the screening of the data in the analysis. Several experiments are investigated, and compared with the current operational NWP system, which uses only the AMV in SATOB format, a subset of higher quality than the BUFR AMV, but disseminated every 6 hours only. A first experiment, where all observations are used, leaving the choice of active data to the screening procedure during assimilation (operational asymmetric first guess check) appears not to be good enough. Three other experiments (one with some thresholds of QI relaxed at high levels and at mid-levels over the sea in the mid-latitudes, another with the AQC only as selection criterion, and the last one, with some thresholds more restricted {{than in the previous}} experiment) give similar results, against the operational NWP system: • a reduction of root-mean-square (rms) increments at high levels over West Africa and in the Southern Hemisphere on the Meteosat coverage, and at low levels in the Southern Atlantic. • a global neutral impact in forecasts, but slightly positive over Europe and Australia. The third experiment (with restricted thresholds), giving a better fit of BUFR AMV to first guess and analysis, appears to be the most robust.

30|$|Since {{the last}} years of the past century, the {{importance}} of basing policies on evidence, data, and analysis has quickly spread all over the world. The Evidence-Based Policy movement [1 – 5] has grown enormously, and mainly all public administrations are now focused on maximising utility and show a pragmatic problem-solving approach to socio-economical issues [6]. In this respect, the evaluation of public funding programs is a field of great interest for policymakers and economists. Politicians and technicians need to estimate the impact that funding has on life and society, in order to address future programs and to modify their decisions. Many standard and advanced statistical methods are commonly used for this purpose, such as linear/nonlinear regressions, Bayesian inference, machine learning, data mining, and so on. In this paper we suggest new <b>indicators,</b> <b>coming</b> from network analysis, that can help underlining in a quantitative way important effects that are not usually considered, being them outside the domain of investigation of standard statistical tools. This does certainly not mean that program evaluation cannot be performed without including network analysis, but that valuable insight about public funding programs could hopefully be inferred from such techniques, in order to help increasing objectivity of the extracted results. Recently, a growing interest towards complex network analysis applied to evaluation can be seen both in literature [7 – 12] and institutional reports [13]. The indicators we suggest can be used by experts in program evaluation for their analyses, giving them the opportunity of considering and quantitatively measuring important features of the funding programs, such as relations between the actors involved in them. Social network analysis is a particularly suitable tool to extract information about relations among the different components of a system. Investigating the relations between the actors participating to a program could be of interest, since can e.g. show structural contradictions in the organisation of the different levels involved [10]. Considering the set of projects, research institutions and enterprises that participate to a funding program as a complex dynamical system, it is possible to identify underlying network structures simply defining the edges according to some relations among the components that are of interest for the evaluator. Once the network is constructed, global and local properties can be evaluated and discussed.|$|R

40|$|Many times, in {{the last}} years, various {{attempts}} have been made to deal with the outcomes of the global economic crisis by means of possible relaunch policies for the construction industry; almost always following a neo-classical growth model, mostly grounded on a quantitative interpretation of development and primarily aimed to raise again the consumption variable, constantly seen as the main index of social well-being. But is it still advisable today - we could ask - to follow such a tendency? Especially in the present circumstances, when multiple signals coming from the economy, the social and the environmental sciences, as well as from the urban and territorial studies, are revealing some ongoing radical transformations, showing all the limits of traditional growth policies. The "weak" sustainability paradigm - appeared {{in the last}} decades of the XXth Century and based on a possible balance between the loss of natural resources and the increase of fixed capitals - is now meant to be replaced by a "strong" interpretation of it, more radical and grounded on a non-negotiability principle of the common finite resources; additionally some of the more recent studies, about the relationships among economic policies, social progress and territorial development, are recommending explicitly a necessary substitution of the only economic evaluations (such as the GDP-based ones) with more complex <b>indicators,</b> <b>coming</b> also from the ecology field, such as land take, landscape fragmentation, level of biodiversity etc. Moreover the physical changes recently observed in the European territory seem to confirm - from a general point of view - a significant slowdown of the sprawl processes in many regions and a collateral increase of transformations in already urbanized areas. Our cities and countryside are rapidly evolving in new metropolitan-like systems, very different from the traditional ones, but anyway able to extend the urban characters to wide parts of the territory, where opposite functional logics, social needs and morphological structures coexist at different scales, continuously variable and mutually intertwined. Reasoning about a sustainable future for cities and regions in terms of "open scales" means, therefore, mainly to break their individual boundaries of autonomy (political, economic, technical, administrative etc.) to reassemble all of these matters in large, holistic recomposing figures; it means most of all to assign to the project a role quite different from the traditional one - (a superimposed device, aimed to produce univocal solutions to specific questions) - and to place it among the stakeholders and decision makers as a dialog catalyser, taking advantage of its prefiguration capabilitie...|$|R
40|$|Growth in the Polish {{economy in}} the fourth quarter of 2006 and in the whole of 2006 {{exceeded}} expectations reaching the highest yearly rate since 1997. The economy expanded at 6. 6 % yoy {{in the fourth quarter}} and at an annual average of 6. 1 %. The growth was driven by a surge in investment, private consumption and exports. Strong demand was met by an acceleration of industrial production growth and contributed to a reduction of registered unemployment to the lowest levels since the late 1990 s. The outlook is positive both in the short and medium term. Forecasts show continued high GDP growth figures in the coming quarters and business sentiment indexes, as well as consumer confidence indexes are at or close to historically high levels. The rapid growth of fixed capital investment adds to the picture of prevailing optimism. The 2006 HICP inflation rate, at an annual average of 1. 3 %, remained among the EU lowest, while higher GDP growth and tax revenues have led to a smaller-thanexpected fiscal deficit in terms of GDP. Despite the positive perspective there are, however, a number of risks to the downside emerging. First of all, rising demand and credit figures lead to the emergence of some inflationary pressures. On the supply side, despite still high registered unemployment rates, labor supply in some markets seems especially squeezed, in part due to migration. March 2007 inflation exceeded expectations reaching 2. 5 % and is projected to rise further by the end of 2007. Government spending needs to be cut back given the growth phase of the economic cycle and unprecedented optimism levels. However, plans for consolidation do not seem ambitious and the postponement of tax reforms constitutes a foregone occasion to reorganize the state budget before a slowdown kicks in. For now, there seems little possibility of meeting the 3 % of GDP limit on fiscal deficit and having the EU's excessive deficit procedure <b>lifted</b> in the <b>coming</b> years. The housing market in the main cities is booming, fueled largely by increased access to mortgage loans. Supply in the entire construction sector is rising, though is curbed in part by problems of tightening labor supply. Poor credit access in the past leads to the expectation that this fast growth is part of a catch-up effect rather than a bubble. If rising inflation pressures are not contained in time and will ultimately require large(r) interest rate hikes the housing market may be vulnerable to a rapid cooling. Some additional sources of uncertainty {{in the fourth quarter of}} 2006 included issues of energy security and rather ambiguous attempts to find a replacement for the outgoing central bank governor. Finally, mainly due to high demand for exports in the EU, the current account deficit remains moderate; however the most recent figures exceeded expectations because of a larger-than-expected trade deficit. Therefore, although the economy is certainly doing well, some fears of overheating are emerging, and there is room for both central bank and government action in order to contain the uncertainties and sustain the high growth. In the new edition of the Polish Economic Outlook we summarize the main macroeconomic developments in the last quarter of 2006 and the first quarter of 2007. We present CASE forecasts for the main variables and introduce a Special Topic section in order to focus on broader economic issues. To start we propose Poland, the Euro and the Maastricht Criteria...|$|R
