30|$|In {{the above}} example [14], as the channel diameters of H-ZSM- 5 {{are small and}} {{relatively}} uniform, {{there is not much}} internal space for the coke building up, whereas the larger inner cavity space allows the H-SAPO- 34 to accumulate more coke species inside. It {{should be noted that the}} volume of coke storage here is not directly correlated with the coke capacity of zeolite. In contrast, due to the uniformly distributed channel size, H-ZSM- 5 would possess a much higher coke tolerance capacity, this is because in principle, chemicals with larger than the channel diameter size are hardly formed inside [12, 13, 22, 25]. For H-SAPO- 34, the smaller pore opening and much larger inner cavity make it difficult to move those internally formed <b>large</b> <b>coke</b> species to outside space, thus eventually leadint to an inreversible catalyst deactivation [10, 12, 13, 34, 35, 36].|$|E

Copper additions {{did not have}} any effect on metal wastage of 304 SS, but reduced the attack on 310 SS and 800 H markedly at levels of 5 % and 10 %. However, increasing the copper content to 20 % produced large copper-rich precipitates which accelerated dusting by promoting internal graphitisation. Dusting was associated with surface coking. When pitting occurred, on copper-free alloys and on copper containing 304 SS, <b>large</b> <b>coke</b> structures grew above the pits. Internal grain boundary carburisation always took place, and intragranular carbides also precipitated when dusting occurred.

40|$|MasterA {{wide variety}} of {{different}} linear, diquaternary alkylammonium ions {{have been used as}} supplementary crystallization structure-directing agents (SDAs) in the synthesis of UZM- 12, a high-silica version of zeolite erionite, via a charge density mismatch (CDM) approach. When tetraethylammonium is used as a CDM SDA, the crystallization of UZM- 12 was found to be critically dependent not only on the type of alkali metal cations added as another crystallization SDA to the synthesis mixture, but also {{on the size of the}} groups on the diquaternary ammonium ion employed and the length of its central polymethylene chain that are closely related to the dimensions of cylindrical 23 -hedral eri cages in this small-pore zeolite. 27 Al MQ MAS NMR measurements reveal a preferential location of Al on the high-multiplicity site over the lower-multiplicity site of the UZM- 12 framework. The catalytic results from the methanol-to-olefin reaction over a series of H-UZM- 12 zeolites with similar acidic properties but different crystallite sizes (100 - 2500 nm in length) demonstrate that the nanocrystallinity (probably the < 100 nm range) may have a detrimental effect on the activity and stability for this reaction, probably due to the fast buildup of <b>large</b> <b>coke</b> molecules on the external surface of zeolite crystallites that inhibits the methanol diffusion to intrazeolitic acid sites, rendering them ultimately inaccessible for catalysis...|$|E
40|$|The {{catalytic}} performance (nitrous oxide decomposition, hydroxylation of benzene to phenol with nitrous oxide, {{and selective}} reduction of nitric oxide by i-butane) was evaluated {{for a set}} of HZSM- 5 and sublimed Fe/ZSM- 5 catalysts, which have been extensively characterized in an earlier contribution (J. Catal. (2003)). Nitrous oxide decomposition rates for the sublimed samples strongly increase after high-temperature calcination and particularly, after high-temperature steaming. Only {{a small fraction of the}} total iron content is active in this decomposition. For benzene hydroxylation the initial phenol productivity also increases with increasing severity of treatment. It is concluded that similar catalytic sites are important. Nevertheless, Fe/ZSM- 5 and Fe/ZSM- 5 (HTC) exhibit relatively low phenol selectivities due to significant hydrocarbon combustion. The steamed Fe/ZSM- 5, however, produces phenol with high selectivity. The stability of the sublimed samples is relatively low due to the <b>large</b> <b>coke</b> make, attributable to the large number of active sites. Commercial HZSM- 5 with an iron content of 0. 024 wt% and its steamed counterpart are also active and have a better stability, the latter one having the highest phenol productivity after prolonged reaction times. The beneficial effect of severe activation treatments to sublimed Fe/ZSM- 5, where iron is introduced at extraframework positions, is taken as an indication that removal of lattice aluminum is important for the generation of active sites. The different activity order in NO reduction by i-butane suggests that the active sites for this reaction are different from those for nitrous oxide decomposition and selective benzene oxidation...|$|E
40|$|The {{catalytic}} conversion of hydrocarbons over zeolites {{has been applied}} in large scale petroleum-refining processes. However, there is always formation and retention of heavy by-products, called coke, which causes catalyst deactivation. This deactivation {{is due to the}} poisoning of the acid sites and/or pore blockage. The formation of coke on hydrocarbon processing catalysts is of considerable technological and economic importance {{and a great deal of}} work has been carried out to this study. The main aim of this work is to understand the deactivation of zeolite catalysts as a result of coke deposition. The deactivation by coke of USHY zeolite was investigated during {{catalytic conversion}} of hydrocarbons – 1 -pentene, n-heptane and ethylbenzene – as representatives of olefins, paraffins and aromatics respectively, at different reaction temperatures, time-on-streams and composition. Three novel techniques, coke classification, thermogravimetric method for characterising coke precursors and indirect temperature programmed desorption (TPD) for catalyst acid sites characterisation were developed to further study catalyst deactivation mechanism. Product distribution, coke formation, characterisation of coke precursors, as well as the role of strong acid sites on hydrocarbon reactions are presented and discussed. During catalytic reactions of 1 -pentene over USHY zeolite, cracking and hydride transfer were the predominant reactions in initial stage which deactivated rapidly allowing isomerisation to become the main reaction afterwards. Deactivation studies showed that coke formation was very strong initially which is in good correlation with the initial rapid deactivation. The hydrogen freed during this initial time from the formation of high C/H ratio coke components contributed to the formation of hydride transfer products. The amount of coke precursors decrease with increasing reaction temperature due to the higher desorption of coke precursors into gas phase while hard coke amount increased with temperature as expected from an activated process. The coke amount formed was not proportional to the reactant feed composition, because of a strong pseudo-zeroth- order initial coking on strong acidic sites. The thermogravimetric method provides insight into the chemical character of coke precursor components in terms of the mode of their removal and allows further classification of coke precursors into small and <b>large</b> <b>coke</b> precursors. The concentration and strength of acid sites of coked catalysts were studied by the TPD methodology. Besides, characterisation of coke precursors was also revealed. The initial deactivation preferentially on strong acid sites is very fast. The concentration of free acid sites is inversely correlated well with the total concentration of coke rather than individual coke groups. Coke precursors tend to be more stable at higher reaction temperatures. Furthermore, by selectively poisoning strong acid sites of USHY zeolite, it shows conclusively that strong acid sites are responsible for cracking and hydride transfer reactions as well as strong coke formation while weak acid sites can only catalyse double bond isomerisation. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{formation}} of carbonaceous deposits that occurs during the aromatization of C 4 –C 7 paraffin and olefin hydrocarbons is visualized in a space- and time-resolved manner over individual micron-sized H-ZSM- 5 zeolite crystals. In situ UV–vis and confocal fluorescence micro-spectroscopy techniques are applied in a comparative study {{for each individual}} light naphtha component. Optical microphotograph image analysis shows how crystal coloration depends on the reactant molecule. The corresponding absorption measurements confirm that olefinic hydrocarbons generate a pronounced coke deposition. Two main UV–vis bands, located at around 420 and 500 nm, thereby shape the absorption spectrum profile and are assigned to aromatic and poly aromatic species. Increasing reactant chain length results in more extended coke deposits, while the introduction of methyl branching generates conjugated carbonaceous species of similar confined size. The <b>larger</b> <b>coke</b> deposits predominantly locate within the straight channels of the H-ZSM- 5 zeolite catalyst, as demonstrated by polarization-dependent UV–vis micro-spectroscopy. In situ confocal fluorescence microscopy reveals spatial heterogeneities of photo-excited coke species between the olefin and paraffin reactants.

40|$|Coke {{formation}} {{during the}} methanol-to-olefin (MTO) conversion {{has been studied}} at the single-particle level with in situ UV/Vis and confocal fluorescence microscopy. For this purpose, large H-ZSM- 5 crystals differing in their Si/Al molar ratio have been investigated. During MTO, performed at 623 and 773  K, three major UV/Vis bands assigned to different carbonaceous deposits and their precursors are observed. The absorption at 420  nm, assigned to methyl-substituted aromatic compounds, initiates the buildup of the optically active coke species. With time-on-stream, these carbonaceous compounds expand in size, resulting in the gradual development of a second absorption band at around 500  nm. An additional broad absorption band in the 600  nm region indicates the enhanced formation of extended carbonaceous compounds that form as the reaction temperature is raised. Overall, the rate of coke formation decreases with decreasing aluminum content. Analysis of the reaction kinetics indicates that an increased Brønsted acid site density facilitates the formation of <b>larger</b> <b>coke</b> species and enhances their formation rate. The use of multiple excitation wavelengths in confocal fluorescence microscopy enables the localization of coke compounds with different molecular dimensions in an individual H-ZSM- 5 crystal. It demonstrates that small coke species evenly spread throughout the entire H-ZSM- 5 crystal, whereas extended coke deposits primarily form near the crystal edges and surfaces. Polarization-dependent UV/Vis spectroscopy measurements illustrate that extended coke species are predominantly formed in the straight channels of H-ZSM- 5. In addition, at higher temperatures, fast deactivation leads {{to the formation of}} large aromatic compounds within channel intersections and at the external zeolite surface, where the lack of spatial restrictions allows the formation of graphite-like coke...|$|R

In November 1881, Thomas proposed selling the Monastery Coke Works near Latrobe, Pennsylvania, to Frick, or at least have Frick take over the marketing and selling of the coke produced there. Thomas' offer came as Frick was planning his wedding, and it fell to Andrew to meet with Frick and his new bride as they honeymooned in New York City. By this time, Thomas had negotiated most of an agreement with Frick, as well as planned the meeting with Andrew. Carnegie took a 10 percent interest in H.C.
