40|$|A methodology, {{based on}} {{accelerated}} degradation testing, is developed {{to predict the}} lifetime of remote phosphor plates used in solid-state lighting (SSL) applications. Both thermal stress and light intensity are used to accelerate degradation reaction in remote phosphor plates.

40|$|Since {{about five}} years, Lighting {{has become a}} partly {{required}} and partly elective course within the Energy program of the Master of Engineering Technology at KU Leuven. While the theoretical part of the course is lectured to the entire audience, an increased emphasis {{has been placed on}} an individual evaluation of the students for the laboratory module. In order to admit several students simultaneously to the laboratory, multiple constructions of the same laboratory setup are requested. Therefore, cheap alternatives to the scientific metrology instrumentation, which still guarantee that the students get acquainted with optical metrology techniques and general radiometric and photometric quantities, are needed. In this paper, the design of an inexpensive integrating sphere setup is presented, enabling the optical characterization of light sources. Instead of using an expensive sphere with magnesium oxide or barium sulfate coating, a cheap polystyrene sphere is employed. In combination with a low-cost USB spectroradiometer, the system enables the direct measurement of the spectral radiant power of a light source. In addition, the <b>luminous</b> <b>flux,</b> <b>luminous</b> efficacy, <b>colour</b> coordinates, <b>colour</b> temperature, <b>and</b> <b>colour</b> rendering index can be determined.

Materials and methods: Technical parameters of ten chosen LED sources of light were determined. The sources varied among each other, according to the shape, colour temperature, <b>colour</b> rendering index <b>and</b> also name of the manufacturer. For each of the analysed sources of light, the illuminance, lighting uniformity, lighting luminance and degree of glare were determined.

The discrete correlation function method yielded good correlation between the bands with no measurable time lags, implying that radiation in these bands originate from the same region and by the same mechanism. We also used the structure function technique to look for characteristic timescales in the light curves. During the times of rapid variability, no evidence for the source to display spectral changes with magnitude was found on either of the timescales.

Our sample contains six BL Lacertae objects and six flat spectrum radio quasars.

This method is to be applied directly to routine calibration measurements of <b>luminous</b> <b>flux.</b> A new <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> calibration facility with a 2. 5 m integrating sphere has been recently completed at NIST and will allow the calibration of test lamps with no need for <b>luminous</b> <b>flux</b> standard lamps.

40|$|Young Sun-like {{stars at}} the {{beginning}} of the pre-main sequence (PMS) evolution are surrounded by accretion discs and remnant protostellar envelopes. Photometric and spectroscopic variations of these stars are driven by interactions of the star with the disc. Time scales and wavelength dependence of the variability carry information on the physical mechanisms behind these interactions. We conducted multi-epoch, multi-wavelength study of PV Cep, a strongly variable, accreting PMS star. By combining our own observations from 2004 - 2010 with archival and literature data, we show that PV Cep started a spectacular fading in 2005, reaching an I_C-band amplitude of 4 mag. Analysis of variation of the optical <b>and</b> infrared <b>fluxes,</b> <b>colour</b> indices, <b>and</b> emission line fluxes suggests that the photometric decline in 2005 - 2009 resulted from an interplay between variable accretion and circumstellar extinction: since the central luminosity of the system is dominated by accretion, a modest drop in the accretion rate could induce the drastic restructuring of the inner disc.
