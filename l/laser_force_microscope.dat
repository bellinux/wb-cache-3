40|$|Abstract: The <b>laser</b> atomic <b>force</b> <b>microscope,</b> a novel {{tool for}} surface {{structure}} exploration, is employed {{to investigate the}} struc 2 tural polymorphism of actin filaments by self 2 organization in vitro. It is demonstrated that the actin can be polymerized into tree 2 like branch structure and long filaments with different diameters in F 2 buffer without the addition of F 2 actin stabilizing reagent, such as phalloidin etc., which is capable of inhibiting the F 2 actin from depolymerization. These polymerized filaments clearly exhibit the structural polymorphism and show obvious difference {{from those in the}} cross 2 linked network mainly composed of single F 2 actin and F 2 actin bundle in the presence of phalloidin under same experimental conditions in previous experiments...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of reactor pressure on GaN nucleation layer (NL) {{and the quality}} of subsequent GaN on sapphire is studied. The layers were grown by low-pressure metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) on c-plane sapphire substrates and investigated by in situ <b>laser</b> reflectometry, atomic <b>force</b> <b>microscope,</b> scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence. With the increase of reactor pressure prior to high-temperature GaN growth, the size of GaN nuclei formed after annealing decreases, the spacing between nucleation sites increases and the coalescence of GaN nuclei is deferred. The optical and crystalline qualities of GaN epilayer were improved when NLs were deposited at high pressure. The elongated lateral overgrowth of GaN islands is responsible for the quality improvement. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

The normal mode of an atomic <b>force</b> <b>microscope</b> is {{used to measure the}} stiffness and hardness of thin films which are tribologically characterized by roughness, nano-scale adhesion forces and friction forces. The friction forces are measured using the lateral force mode of atomic <b>force</b> <b>microscope.</b> In order to measure the adhesion forces of thin films, spectroscopy in point with atomic <b>force</b> <b>microscope</b> was performed. Direct measurement of tribological and mechanical behaviour of thin films is important to increase the lifetime of microstructures which use thin films for friction and stiction reduction of microsystems...|$|R

40|$|Effect {{of silicon}} atomic <b>force</b> <b>microscope</b> probe {{position}} and particle spacing {{on the local}} absorption of an array of gold nanoparticles placed over a dielectric borosilicate glass surface are evaluated. An improved, vectorized version of discrete dipole approximation coupled with surface interactions is employed throughout the study. It is shown that surface evanescent waves interacting with the system of nanoparticles and atomic <b>force</b> <b>microscope</b> probe result in a near-field coupling between them. This coupling can enhance or reduce the local absorption by the nanoparticles depending on the position of atomic <b>force</b> <b>microscope</b> tip in three-dimensional space and direction of propagation of the surface evanescent wave. The position of the atomic <b>force</b> <b>microscope's</b> tip and spacing that maximize the absorption are identified.
