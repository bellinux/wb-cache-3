50|$|Public <b>law</b> <b>is</b> <b>law</b> {{that governs}} the {{relationship}} between people and the State, and it is composed of three types: constitutional law, criminal law, and administrative <b>law.</b> Constitutional <b>law</b> <b>is</b> the body of law that governs the principles and powers of the government, and {{the relationships between the}} different parts of the government. Criminal <b>law</b> <b>is</b> <b>law</b> that restricts conduct that threatens safety and welfare of society or the State.

5|$|A {{secondary}} rhetorical battle began between Walpole and the Irish {{in regard}} to Wood's patent; {{the rest of the}} constitutional debate was over the nature of Poynings' Law, a law that was brought back into use through the Declaratory Act (1720). Poyning's <b>Law</b> <b>was</b> a law that the British claimed allowed them to control all of Ireland's legal actions and to revoke the Irish parliamentary independence. Traditionally, the rulers of Ireland viewed themselves as a kingdom and not a colony that would be controlled by Poyning's Law.
