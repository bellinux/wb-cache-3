In 1947, Gerard Kuiper showed that the thin Martian atmosphere contained extensive carbon dioxide; roughly double the quantity found in Earth's atmosphere. The first standard nomenclature for Mars albedo features was adopted in 1960 by the International Astronomical Union. Since the 1960s, multiple robotic spacecraft have been sent to explore Mars from orbit and the surface. The planet has remained under observation by ground and space-based instruments across a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum.

40|$|This plan {{outlines}} a Characterization Program {{that provides}} the necessary data to support the Integrated Process Strategy scope and schedules for the Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF) and sludge stored in the Hanford K Basins. The plan {{is driven by the}} schedule to begin fuel transfer by December 1997. The program is structured for 4 years (i. e., FY 1995 through FY 1998) and is limited to in-situ and <b>laboratory</b> <b>examinations</b> of the SNF and sludge in the K East and K West Basins. In order to assure the scope and schedule of the Characterization Program fully supports the Integrated Process Strategy, key project management has approved the plan. The intent of the program is to provide bounding behavior for the fuel, and acceptability for the transfer of the sludge to the Double Shell Tanks. Fuel examinations are based on two shipping compains from the K West Basin and one from the K East Basin with coincident sludge sampling campaings for the associated canister sludge. Sampling of the basin floor and pit sludge will be conducted independent of the fuel and canister sludge shipping activities. Fuel behavior and properties investigated in the laboratory include physical condition, hydride and oxide content, conditioning testing, oxidation kinetics, and dry storage behavior. These <b>laboratory</b> <b>examinations</b> are expected to provide the necessary data to establish or confirm fuel conditioning process limits and support safety analysis. Sludge <b>laboratory</b> <b>examinations</b> include measurement of quantity and content, measurement of properties for equipment design and recovery process limits and support safety analysis. Sludge <b>laboratory</b> <b>examinations</b> include measurement of quantity and content, measurement of properties for equipment design and recovery precesses, tank farm acceptance, simulant development, measurement of corrosion products, and measurements of drying behavior...|$|R
