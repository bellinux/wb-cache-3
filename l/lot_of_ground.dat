The Pirates experienced a surge in fan enthusiasm with Bonds on the team and set the club attendance record of 52,119 in the 1987 home opener.

25|$|Pettitte {{throws a}} four-seam fastball, a cutter a curveball, a sinker, a changeup to {{right-handed}} batters, and a slider. His out pitch is a cutter at 84–88mph with good inside break on right-handed batters, {{resulting in a}} <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>ground</b> ball outs and double plays. Before his original 2011 retirement, his fastball was measured in the lower 90s and his curveball was about 74–76mph. As a left-handed pitcher, Pettitte has an exceptional pickoff move to first base, allowing him to record 100 career pickoffs.|$|E

The half forwards will cover a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>ground</b> and utilising speedy half forwards to run at defences is a common tactic.

In early 1957 a licence agreement was reached to allow Valmet to build the Gnat at Tampere in Finland, although in the end none was built.

25|$|By 1879 {{the library}} had 189,114 volumes on its shelves. Space was lacking. Thus on December 5, 1879, John Jacob Astor III donated three <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>ground</b> {{adjoining}} the northern side <b>of</b> the library's <b>lot</b> for an addition.

25|$|Scientific {{publications}} {{increased by}} 308% between 2005 and 2014, {{primarily as a}} result of Thomson Reuters' decision to track a much larger number of Brazilian journals in its database between 2006 and 2008. Despite this artificial boost, the pace of growth has slowed since 2011. Moreover, in terms of publications per capita, the country trails both the more dynamic emerging market economies and advanced economies, even if it is ahead of most of its neighbours. When it comes to impact, Brazil has lost a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>ground</b> in the past decade. One possible cause may be the speed with which enrolment in higher education has expanded since the mid-1990s, especially as concerns students passing through the federal system of universities, some of which have resorted to hiring inexperienced faculty, including candidates without doctorates.|$|E
25|$|On lap 15, Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel {{came into}} the pits. Hamilton rejoined in sixth place but Vettel's fuel pump failed to work {{so he had to}} come in again. Kovalainen came in a lap later while Barrichello was pushing to try and build a gap. Button and Räikkönen pitted on lap 18, the Finn coming out in eighth while Button rejoined in 11th.

[...] Serrano commented on the presentation of Jimmy Wales during the film, [...] "In the end, I came out of the theater thinking of him as a three-dimensional figure, very much a man with passion but neither completely good or evil. To be honest, this is very important in a film like this and is a definite plus for the movie." [...] Serrano recommended the documentary, and concluded, [...] "This is definitely a solid film. ... This film is definitely worth a viewing. It’s interesting, well made, and presents varied perspectives on Wikipedia that help the narrative stay interesting." ...|$|E
500|$|Described as [...] "one of {{the most}} talented footballers of his generation", Enda Muldoon has played in {{virtually}} all positions in the forward line, as well as midfield for both his club and county.

Muldoon has been praised for his vision and ability to pick out pin-point passes, and he is also regarded as a great reader of the game. Ballinderry and Derry team-mate Kevin McGuckin described him as [...] "a magician on the ball and can do anything with it or put it anywhere with his passing".

Rick Porter of Zap2it praised the episode, but {{expressed concern that the}} show would grow more stale now that Michael, Pam and Ryan were back to their old jobs at Dunder Mifflin; Porter particularly complimented the new aspects of the Charles Miner character presented in [...] "Broke", including his interaction with David and his exasperation with Dwight. Dan Hopper of Best Week Ever praised the episode and Michael's shrewdness, but also expressed worry that the quality of future episodes would dip now that Dunder Mifflin was back to normal. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club said of the episode, [...] "Elba's stint on The Office went out on a high note. I'll miss his joyless scold of a middle manager but it's nice to have the gang reunited." [...] Rabin also said the moment when Charles fails to listen when Dwight learns Michael's company is broke [...] "rang a little false", but praised the episode as a whole. Meghan Carlson of BuddyTV said she enjoyed seeing Michael so victorious at the end, and said, [...] "as far as ends getting tied off cleanly, 'Broke' was an inspired episode, full of tension, suspense, and yes, humor." ...|$|E

Patrick Ryan of USA Today felt that [...] "espite the album title and Stefani's refreshingly candid press tour, it's sometimes hard to believe this is what her truth actually sounds like. But even if she's not being totally honest here, it's still more so than many of her pop peers." [...] Jillian Mapes of Pitchfork Media criticized the songs she perceived were tailor-made for Top 40 radio, calling them [...] "unremarkable" [...] saying they [...] "fail to match the unique specificity of her early solo hits". But she praised [...] "the ones in which she is audibly upset—sometimes pissed off, sometimes sad, but best-case scenario, both.

[...] In a mixed review, Theon Weber of Spin commented, [...] "n creating a schism between her punkish pep and her new-wave nostalgia, it leaves the former stranded and the latter generic."
