5|$|There was a {{good deal}} of {{interest}} in the 2004 transit as scientists attempted to measure the pattern of <b>light</b> <b>dimming</b> as Venus blocked out some of the Sun's light, in order to refine techniques that they hope to use in searching for extrasolar planets. Current methods of looking for planets orbiting other stars only work for a few cases: planets that are very large (Jupiter-like, not Earth-like), whose gravity is strong enough to wobble the star sufficiently for us to detect changes in proper motion or Doppler shift changes in radial velocity; Jupiter or Neptune sized planets very close to their parent star whose transit causes changes in the luminosity of the star; or planets which pass in front of background stars with the planet-parent star separation comparable to the Einstein ring and cause gravitational microlensing. Measuring light intensity {{during the course of a}} transit, as the planet blocks out some of the light, is potentially much more sensitive, and might be used to find smaller planets. However, extremely precise measurement is needed: for example, the transit of Venus causes the amount of light received from the Sun to drop by a fraction of 0.001 (that is, to 99.9% of its nominal value), and the dimming produced by small extrasolar planets will be similarly tiny.|$|E
60|$|In that {{darkness}} {{were all}} the shapes and lights and shadows of a London night in spring: the trees in dark bloom; the wan yellow of the gas-lamps, pale emblems of the self-consciousness of towns; the clustered shades of the tiny leaves, spilled, purple, {{on the surface of}} the road, like bunches of black grapes squeezed down into the earth by the feet of the passers-by. There, too, were shapes of men and women hurrying home, and the great blocked shapes of the houses where they lived. A halo hovered above the City--a high haze of yellow <b>light,</b> <b>dimming</b> the stars. The black, slow figure of a policeman moved noiselessly along the railings opposite.|$|E

5000|$|EnOcean {{wireless}} data packets {{are relatively}} small, with the packet being only 14 bytes long and are transmitted at 125 kbit/s. RF energy is only transmitted for the 1's of the binary data, {{reducing the amount}} of power required. Three packets are sent at pseudo-random intervals reducing the possibility of RF packet collisions. Modules optimized for switching applications transmit additional data packets on release of push-button switches, enabling other features such as <b>light</b> <b>dimming</b> to be implemented. [...] The transmission frequencies used for the devices are 902 MHz, 928.35 MHz, 868.3 MHz and 315 MHz.

Several of the flexible class-room spaces were removed during this period.In 2002 the auditorium was renovated again, the stage was made larger on either side, the last remains of the old music room were taken out, new seats were added in one of the lecture theatres and one of the seating sections, as well as a new stage <b>light</b> <b>dimming</b> system was installed.|$|E
5000|$|Technology: It is the Saurer F006 {{turned into}} an {{off-road}} passenger vehicle with four-wheel drive. The concept {{was adopted by the}} automaker Monteverdi, improved by Berna engineering company of Olten, Switzerland. Saurer took over the production. The axles are from IHC Scout (Jeep I scout from International Harvester). The vehicle had a plastic body made of polyester. For power the drive-train was a 6-cylinder petrol engine from Volvo with an automatic transmission. Maximum speed was 100 km/h. Overall styling contrasted to the Mercedes G and Puch 230GE joint venture vehicle with the front turn signals mounted conventionally {{on the front of the}} vehicle (and not on the hood). The equipment installed in the front bumper parking lights can be turned by flicking the [...] "Tarnlicht" [...] switch (a multipurpose military switch for <b>light</b> <b>dimming).</b> The basic vehicle has a fixed open back cab.

40|$|Heating, cooling and {{lighting}} are the dominant sectors of energy consumption in commercial buildings. Controlling solar radiation through windows {{will improve the}} illuminance distribution as well as energy efficiency of buildings. Advanced window systems with motorized shading controlled in conjunction with <b>light</b> <b>dimming</b> constitute a promising approach for improving energy efficiency of buildings. However, the performance of current controlled daylighting systems is neither sufficiently reliable nor accurate, thereby reducing their widespread adoption. The uncertainty of <b>light</b> <b>dimming</b> control system performance {{is largely due to}} prediction of workplane illuminance. This makes the system unreliable and sometimes more complex. To improve the performance of <b>light</b> <b>dimming</b> control systems, the prediction of the workplane illuminance must be considered first. Without thorough understanding of systems, their control may not be achieved efficiently. A new daylight prediction method, Illuminance Ratio Prediction (IRP) method, is proposed in this thesis for an integrated daylighting control system. The proposed method, which is theoretically developed based on radiosity theory, shows that the illuminance ratio of two arbitrary surfaces in a space in the presence of one initial light source with varying quantity at a fixed location is always constant. The proposed method was experimentally proved. With the IRP method, reliable and accurate predictions of daylighting parameters such as the workplane illuminance, the exterior vertical illuminance and the solar heat gains through the window systems, were obtained as the basis for development of an integrated daylighting control methodology. The methodology was validated in an outdoor test-room with dimmable electric lighting and a window with built-in motorized blinds. The algorithm was calibrated with a workplane sensor control. Then, an integrated daylighting control system using an interior front wall sensor for prediction was successfully tested. It was found that this system could maintain both the workplane illuminance level and the solar heat gains at the desirable level by simultaneous controls of <b>light</b> <b>dimming</b> and blind tilt angle. With active daylighting control, significant energy savings may be achieved in energy consumption for lighting and cooling. One important asset of the methodology developed is that motorized blinds are optimally tilted so as to admit just enough daylight to satisfy workplane illuminance requirements predicted with IRP method, thus reducing cooling loads due to potential excessive solar gains...|$|E

30|$|Cross-tree {{constraints}} {{are used}} to formalize extra-feature dependencies {{in the form of}} propositional formulas. In the VScomponent sub-model, these constraints define configuration rules for the correct assembly of software components. For instance, the dependency ‚Äúcomponent A requires the interface provided by component B‚Äù can be modeled by the constraint ‚ÄúA implies B‚Äù. Furthermore, cross-tree constraints between both sub-models work as a bridge between application requirements and component assemblies that realize those requirements. For instance, the constraint ‚ÄúShadowRemoval implies Lighting.Low‚Äù means that if Lighting.Low feature, which represents a low light context condition, is selected due to a <b>light</b> <b>dimming</b> event, the ShadowRemoval component is deselected, i.e. it cannot be part of the current system configuration.|$|E

We show that independent control of <b>light</b> <b>dimming</b> is possible while transmitting data within a typical room environment, provided the PWM dimming period is an integer multiple of the PPM slot duration. To validate this, we show the measured eye diagrams {{for a range of}} dimming levels. In addition, we qualitatively illustrate examples of different dimming levels by changing the dimming level while maintaining the PPM data stream...|$|E
