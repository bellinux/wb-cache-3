5|$|In {{the early}} days of the service, <b>lifeboat</b> launch and {{recovery}} was usually undertaken by women. There were deeply-held views about women actually crewing the boats themselves – it was considered extremely bad luck. Along all parts part of the coastline, women supported their men on the <b>lifeboat</b> crews by working together to get the <b>lifeboat</b> afloat and then later recovering it from the water in readiness for when the next call came. While <b>lifeboat</b> crew are still predominantly male (92%), the first female (inshore) crew member was Elizabeth Hostvedt in 1969, and Frances Glody was the first woman crew member on an all-weather <b>lifeboat,</b> at Dunmore East <b>Lifeboat</b> Station, in 1981. Lauren McGuire, at the age of 27, became the RNLI's youngest station manager in 2011, at Clovelly, Devon.|$|E

5|$|The Royal National <b>Lifeboat</b> Institution {{stationed}} an inshore <b>lifeboat</b> at Bournemouth between 1965 and 1972. Coverage for {{the area}} has otherwise been provided from Poole <b>Lifeboat</b> Station. The Bournemouth International Centre (BIC), a large conference and exhibition centre, was constructed near the seafront in 1984, and {{in the following year}} Bournemouth became the first town in the United Kingdom to introduce and use CCTV cameras for public street-based surveillance.|$|E
5|$|The first Royal National <b>Lifeboat</b> {{was funded}} by the town of Cheltenham, and arrived in 1866. The <b>lifeboat</b> was removed in 1930 because of the {{difficulty}} in getting a full crew, and because the launching arrangements were not suitable for a powered boat. The current Burnham-on-Sea <b>Lifeboat</b> Station is the base for Royal National <b>Lifeboat</b> Institution (RNLI) search and rescue operations. The present station was opened in 2003. It operates two inshore lifeboats (ILBs), a B Class rigid-hulled boat and an inflatable D Class.|$|E
2500|$|As built, Andes had 14 <b>lifeboats</b> {{with a total}} {{capacity}} of 1,174 people. There were two , [...] motor boats, ten [...] <b>lifeboats</b> and two [...] <b>lifeboats.</b> All were mounted on Taylor's patent gravity davits.|$|R
25|$|Additional <b>lifeboats</b> {{could be}} stored {{within reach of}} the davits on the deck house roof, and in an {{emergency}} the gantry davits could reach <b>lifeboats</b> {{on the other side}} of the ship, providing that none of the funnels was obstructing the way. The aim of this design was to enable all the <b>lifeboats</b> to be launched, even if the ship developed a list that would normally prevent <b>lifeboats</b> being launched on the side opposite to the list. However, several of these davits were placed abreast of funnels, defeating that purpose. The ship carried 48 <b>lifeboats,</b> capable of carrying at least 75 people each. Thus, 3,600 people could be carried by the <b>lifeboats,</b> more than the maximum number of people the ship could carry.|$|R

5|$|A {{court of}} enquiry was held the {{following}} month in Liverpool by the Board of Trade, and focused particularly on {{the roles of the}} captains in the tragedy as well as the design of the Liverpool <b>lifeboat.</b> The court found that no-one was to blame for the loss of either Ellen Southard or the Liverpool <b>lifeboat.</b> Captain James Martin and his crew were praised for their gallantry in getting everyone off the ship, and absolved of any blame with respect to the capsizing of the <b>lifeboat.</b> The <b>lifeboat</b> was furthermore found to be of sound design and suitably adapted to her role, but debate continued for many years about the merits of the tubular design vs the self-righting one, as well as the requirement for lifeboats to be powered.|$|E

5|$|All-weather {{lifeboats}} (ALBs) {{are large}} boats with enclosed wheelhouses and survivor spaces below deck, which are self-righting and {{can go out}} in all weather conditions. Some ALBs carry an inflatable Y-class <b>lifeboat</b> or Y-boat for inshore work, launched by mechanical arm. There are six classes of ALB motor life boats, with speeds ranging from 17 to 25 knots. The RNLI's aim {{is to provide a}} 25-knot <b>lifeboat</b> to every all-weather crew, and has begun construction of an All-weather <b>Lifeboat</b> Centre (ALC) in Poole which, when complete, will save £3million a year. The RNLI took over the ALC in 2015 with the expectation of becoming fully operational in 2019, when six Shannon-class lifeboats a year will be built.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the safer}} eastern channel and {{improvements}} in maritime technology, the Royal National <b>Lifeboat</b> Institution still deals with incidents at the Doom Bar. In February 1997, two fishermen who were not wearing lifejackets drowned after their boat capsized. Two anglers {{had been killed in}} a similar incident in 1994. On 25 June 2007, the Padstow <b>lifeboat</b> and a rescue helicopter rescued the crews of two yachts in separate incidents from the area.|$|E

50|$|Titanic had 16 sets of davits, each able {{to handle}} four <b>lifeboats.</b> This gave Titanic the ability to carry up to 64 wooden <b>lifeboats</b> {{which would have been}} enough for 4,000 people—considerably more than her actual capacity. However, the White Star Line decided that only 16 wooden <b>lifeboats</b> and four collapsibles would be carried, which could {{accommodate}} 1,178 people, only one-third of Titanic total capacity. At the time, the Board of Trades regulations required British vessels over 10,000 tons to only carry 16 <b>lifeboats</b> with a capacity of 990 occupants.|$|R

5|$|In {{the centre}} of the town lies Weymouth Harbour; {{although}} it was the reason for the town's foundation, the harbour separates the two areas of Melcombe Regis (the main town centre) and Weymouth (the southern harbourside) from each other. Since the 18th century they have been linked by successive bridges over the narrowest part of the harbour. The present Town Bridge, built in 1930, is a lifting bascule bridge allowing boats to access the inner harbour. The Royal National <b>Lifeboat</b> Institution stationed a <b>lifeboat</b> at Weymouth {{for the first time on}} 26 January 1869. A boathouse was built with a slipway by the harbour and is still in use, although the <b>lifeboat</b> is now moored at a pontoon.|$|E

While it was still possible to board the <b>lifeboats</b> on the port side, lowering them presented a different problem. As was typical for the period, the hull plates of Lusitania were riveted, and as the <b>lifeboats</b> were lowered they dragged on the inch high rivets, which threatened to seriously damage the boats before they landed in the water.|$|R
