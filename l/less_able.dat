5|$|The keto oxygen renders {{mephedrone}} more hydrophilic {{than the}} corresponding methylamphetamines, which {{may account for}} the higher doses required to achieve a similar effect, because mephedrone is <b>less</b> <b>able</b> to cross the blood–brain barrier.|$|E
5|$|The late stelae at Seibal show {{a marked}} {{reduction}} in quality over {{a span of}} about forty years, {{with the loss of}} Classic Period traits, and bearing flatter and cruder representations than earlier stelae.

5|$|Another way enzyme {{malfunctions}} {{can cause}} disease comes from germline mutations in genes coding for DNA repair enzymes. Defects in these enzymes cause cancer because cells are <b>less</b> <b>able</b> to repair mutations in their genomes. This causes a slow accumulation of mutations {{and results in}} the development of cancers. An example of such a hereditary cancer syndrome is xeroderma pigmentosum, which causes the development of skin cancers in response to even minimal exposure to ultraviolet light.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the damage done by}} the bullet, the autopsy also found that the President was suffering from cardiomyopathy (fatty degeneration of the heart muscle). This would have weakened his heart and made him <b>less</b> <b>able</b> to recover from such an injury, and was thought to be related to his overweight frame and lack of exercise. Modern scholars generally believe that McKinley died of pancreatic necrosis, a condition that is difficult to treat today and would have been completely impossible for the doctors of his time.|$|E
5|$|The reason Byzantine Greek merchants {{have often}} been {{neglected}} in historiography {{is not that they}} were any <b>less</b> <b>able</b> than their ancient or modern Greek colleagues in matters of trade. It rather originated with the way history was written in Byzantium, which was often under the patronage of their competitors, the court, and land aristocracy. The fact that they were eventually surpassed by their Italian rivals is attributable to the privileges sought and acquired by the Crusader States within the Levant and the dominant maritime violence of the Italians.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This {{omni-directional}} wheelchair {{was designed}} for the <b>less</b> <b>abled</b> elderly to move more flexibly in narrow spaces, such as elevators or small aisle. We have constructed one dexterous three-wheeled wheelchair with smooth omni-directional motion. It does not only keep the merit of the existing manual and electrical operated wheelchair, but also with a novel omni-directional mobility system. Elderly people can easily operate such device in most environments. We implemented the dexterous and complicated mechanisms to allow such an electrically operated wheelchair to move forward at any direction that is far easier manoeuvred than any traditional electronic wheelchairs. We carried on improvements for design, mechanical and control system of this electrically operated wheelchair, {{and the development of}} smart automatic charge system and lastly a collision-evading system. Key words: Wheelchair, electrically operated wheelchair, omni-directional movement...|$|R
50|$|Bronte Beach is a {{small but}} popular {{recreational}} beach in the eastern suburbs of Sydney, Australia. It is 2 kilometres south of Bondi Beach and north of the much larger Coogee Beach. A long distance ocean swimming event is held every December between Bondi Beach and Bronte. The three beaches are linked by a paved coastal footpath along the rocky cliff tops, much frequented by tourists and local runners and walkers. The beach is popular with surfers and despite the non rough surf, <b>less</b> <b>abled</b> swimmers can avail themselves of the bogey hole or rock pool towards {{the southern end of}} the beach. At the south end of the beach is a 30-metre ocean pool, one of the best known in Sydney. Also directly opposite from Bronte there are some popular cafes.|$|R
5|$|Benthic in nature, {{the plain}} maskray feeds mainly on caridean shrimp and polychaete worms, {{and to a}} lesser extent on small bony fishes. It is viviparous, with females {{producing}} litters of one or two young that are nourished during gestation via histotroph ("uterine milk"). This species lacks economic value but is caught incidentally in bottom trawls, which it is thought to be <b>less</b> <b>able</b> to withstand than other maskrays due to its gracile build. As it also has a limited distribution and low fecundity, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it as Near Threatened.|$|E
5|$|Despite his successes, al-Mu'tadid's reign was {{ultimately}} {{too short to}} effect a lasting reversal of the Caliphate's fortunes, and the revival that he spearheaded was too dependent {{on the presence of}} capable personalities {{at the helm of the}} state. The brief reign of his <b>less</b> <b>able</b> son and heir, al-Muktafi, still saw some major gains, notably the annexation of the Tulunid domains, but his later successors lacked his energy, and new enemies appeared in the form of the Qarmatians. In addition, the factionalism within the bureaucracy, that had become apparent during the later years of al-Mu'tadid's reign, would debilitate the Abbasid government for decades to come, eventually leading to the subjugation of the Caliphate to a series of military strongmen and culminating in the conquest of Baghdad by the Buyids in 946.|$|E
5|$|However, it {{is highly}} {{unlikely}} that single-story structures such as mobile homes can have a substantial effect on tornado development or evolution. More people are killed in trailer parks because mobile homes are <b>less</b> <b>able</b> to withstand high winds than permanent structures. Winds which can demolish or roll a mobile home may only cause roof damage to a typical one- or two-family permanent residence. Another likely contributing factor to the continued propagation of this myth is confirmation bias: whenever a new instance of a tornado hitting a mobile home park occurs, media outlets report on it more extensively, ignoring damage to the surrounding area which may not have produced as many casualties.|$|E

5|$|In {{reality the}} House of Hohenzollern, of which Albrecht was a member, the ruling {{family of the}} Margraviate of Brandenburg, had been {{actively}} expanding its territorial influence; for example already in the 16th century in Farther Pomerania and Silesia. Motivated by a current political expediency, Sigismund Augustus in 1563 allowed the Brandenburg elector branch of the Hohenzollerns, excluded under the 1525 agreement, to inherit the Prussian fief rule. The decision, confirmed by the 1569 sejm, made the future union of Prussia with Brandenburg possible. Sigismind II, unlike his successors, was however careful to assert his supremacy. The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, ruled after 1572 by elective kings, was even <b>less</b> <b>able</b> to counteract the growing importance of the dynastically active Hohenzollerns.|$|E
5|$|Low oxygen levels lead to hypoxic {{pulmonary}} vasoconstriction, the {{tightening of}} small {{blood vessels in}} the lung to create an optimal distribution of blood through the lung. Persistently low oxygen levels causing chronic vasoconstriction leads to increased pressure on the pulmonary artery (pulmonary hypertension), which in turn puts strain on the right ventricle, the part of the heart that pumps blood to the lungs. The right ventricle undergoes remodeling, becomes distended and is <b>less</b> <b>able</b> to remove blood from the veins. When this is the case, raised hydrostatic pressure leads to accumulation of fluid in the skin (edema), and in more severe cases the liver and the abdominal cavity.|$|E
5|$|Olfactory {{navigation}} {{has been}} suggested as a possible mechanism in pigeons. Papi's 'mosaic' model argues that pigeons build and remember a mental map of the odours in their area, recognizing where they are by the local odour. Wallraff's 'gradient' model argues {{that there is a}} steady, large-scale gradient of odour which remains stable for long periods. If there were two or more such gradients in different directions, pigeons could locate themselves in two dimensions by the intensities of the odours. However {{it is not clear that}} such stable gradients exist. Papi did find evidence that anosmic pigeons (unable to detect odours) were much <b>less</b> <b>able</b> to orient and navigate than normal pigeons, so olfaction does seem to be important in pigeon navigation. However, it is not clear how olfactory cues are used.|$|E

5|$|Recent {{studies on}} the sail of Dimetrodon and other sphenacodontids support Haack's 1986 {{contention}} that the sail was poorly adapted to releasing heat and maintaining a stable body temperature. The presence of sails in small-bodied species of Dimetrodon such as D.milleri and D.teutonis does not fit {{the idea that the}} sail's purpose was thermoregulation because smaller sails are <b>less</b> <b>able</b> to transfer heat and because small bodies can absorb and release heat easily on their own. Moreover, close relatives of Dimetrodon such as Sphenacodon have very low crests that would have been useless as thermoregulatory devices. The large sail of Dimetrodon is thought to have developed gradually from these smaller crests, meaning that over most of the sail's evolutionary history, thermoregulation could not have served an important function.|$|E
5|$|Some insects, {{occupying the}} {{biological}} niches that they do, {{need to be}} incredibly maneuverable. They must find their food in tight spaces and be capable of escaping larger predators – or they may themselves be predators, and need to capture prey. Their maneuverability, from an aerodynamic viewpoint, is provided by high lift and thrust forces. Typical insect fliers can attain lift forces up to three times their weight and horizontal thrust forces up to five times their weight. There are two substantially different insect flight mechanisms, and {{each has its own}} advantages and disadvantages – just because odonates have a more primitive flight mechanism does not mean they are <b>less</b> <b>able</b> fliers; they are, in certain ways, more agile than anything that has evolved afterward.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} {{cause of death}} in temperate areas is likely to be starvation, particularly over the autumn and winter period when first year birds are still perfecting their hunting skills. In northern and upland areas, there is some correlation between mortality in older birds and adverse weather, deep-lying snow and prolonged low temperatures. Collision with road vehicles is another cause of mortality, and may result when birds forage on mown verges. Some of these birds are in poor condition and may have been <b>less</b> <b>able</b> to evade oncoming vehicles than fit individuals would have been. Historically, many deaths were caused by the use of pesticides, and this may still be the case {{in some parts of the}} world. Collisions with power-lines kill some birds and shooting accounts for others, especially in Mediterranean regions.|$|E

5|$|The red-throated loon breeds {{primarily}} in the Arctic regions of northern Eurasia and North America (generally north of 50°N latitude), and winters in northern coastal waters, sometimes in groups of considerable size. More than 4,400 spend the winter in a loose concentration on {{the eastern part of}} the German Bight, for example. Unlike other loons, it regularly uses very small freshwater lakes as breeding sites. Its small size renders it more versatile, but it is <b>less</b> <b>able</b> to feed on deeper prey. The increase in size and diversity of the remaining species of loons suggests that the benefits of larger size outweigh the limitations.|$|E
5|$|The small glaciers in {{the forest}} are <b>less</b> <b>able</b> to resist melting than the great ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica. Once a glacier begins retreating, it may fall into disequilibrium and be unable to find mass balance (accumulation versus melting rate) at any size. Without a {{favorable}} climate change, {{it will continue to}} retreat until it disappears. Loss of glacial ice already reduces the summer glacial runoff that supplies water to streams and lakes and provides a cold-water source vital to certain fish and plant species. This, in turn, may {{have a significant impact on}} the forest ecosystem over time.|$|E
5|$|To further {{interest}} the case, House manipulates the team, Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), and Chase (Jesse Spencer), by swapping {{his own blood}} sample, leading them to believe he too has syphilis, perhaps the cause for his misanthropic personality and unfriendliness.

Meanwhile, Foreman believes he isn't getting the respect he deserves from Kutner, Taub (Peter Jacobson) and Thirteen (Olivia Wilde), {{when he tries to}} do their performance reviews, which he believes is due to House frequently humiliating him. House replies that if he did not humiliate and taunt Foreman, he would not be strong and able enough to handle the rest of the team.|$|E
50|$|A further {{factor in}} a child’s {{educational}} attainment involves the school environment, more specifically teacher expectations and attitudes.
