5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built four {{dams and}} locks on the <b>lower</b> Snake River to {{facilitate}} shipping. The <b>lower</b> Columbia River has likewise been dammed for navigation. Thus a deep shipping channel through locks and slackwater reservoirs for heavy barges exists from the Pacific Ocean to Lewiston, Idaho. Most barge traffic originating on the Snake River goes to deep-water ports on the <b>lower</b> Columbia River, such as Portland. Grain, mostly wheat, {{is the main}} product shipped from the Snake, and nearly {{all of it is}} exported internationally from the <b>lower</b> Columbia River ports.|$|E
5|$|In the {{mandible}} (<b>lower</b> jaw), {{the upper}} and <b>lower</b> masseteric ridges come close together below the first molars, but do not fuse. The {{back end of the}} <b>lower</b> incisor root is in a capsular process, a raising of the mandibular bone behind the molars. The upper incisors have yellowish enamel and are opisthodont, with the cutting edge inclined backwards. The molars are relatively small and are brachydont (low-crowned) and bunodont (with the cusps higher than the connecting crests). They {{are similar to those of}} the marsh rice rat in structural details. The upper and <b>lower</b> first molars have small accessory roots, as in many other oryzomyines, and the second and third <b>lower</b> molar each have two roots only.|$|E
5|$|Known {{material}} of Dermotherium includes {{a handful of}} jaw fragments and isolated teeth. Dermotherium major is known only from a fragment of the left <b>lower</b> jaw bearing the third <b>lower</b> molar (m3) and a poorly preserved second <b>lower</b> molar (m2). The holotype of Dermotherium chimaera is a <b>lower</b> jaw fragment in which remnants of the deciduous third <b>lower</b> premolar are visible. X-ray microtomography reveals the unerupted <b>lower</b> third incisor (i3), canine (c1), third premolar (p3), and fourth premolar (p4) still inside the jaw. In addition, this species is known from two other jaw fragments, one bearing m1 and m2 and the other bearing m2 and m3, and two isolated molars, an upper first and second molar (M1 and M2). The tentatively referred {{material of}} this species from Pakistan includes a single M2.|$|E
50|$|The modes can be {{arranged}} in the following sequence, which follows the circle of fifths. In this sequence, each mode has one more <b>lowered</b> interval relative to the tonic than the mode preceding it. Thus taking Lydian as reference, Ionian (major) has a <b>lowered</b> fourth; Mixolydian, a <b>lowered</b> fourth and seventh; Dorian, a <b>lowered</b> fourth, seventh, and third; Aeolian (Natural Minor), a <b>lowered</b> fourth, seventh, third, and sixth; Phrygian, a <b>lowered</b> fourth, seventh, third, sixth, and second; and Locrian, a <b>lowered</b> fourth, seventh, third, sixth, second, and fifth. Put another way, the augmented fourth of the Lydian scale {{has been reduced to}} a perfect fourth in Ionian, the major seventh in Ionian, to a minor seventh in Mixolydian, etc.|$|R

5|$|One of {{the major}} {{applications}} of sintered silicon nitride is in automobile industry as a material for engine parts. Those include, in diesel engines, glowplugs for faster start-up; precombustion chambers (swirl chambers) for <b>lower</b> emissions, faster start-up and <b>lower</b> noise; turbocharger for reduced engine lag and emissions. In spark-ignition engines, silicon nitride is used for rocker arm pads for <b>lower</b> wear, turbocharger for <b>lower</b> inertia and less engine lag, and in exhaust gas control valves for increased acceleration. As examples of production levels, there is an estimated more than 300,000 sintered silicon nitride turbochargers made annually.|$|E

50|$|The Cub Lo-Boy, {{introduced}} in 1955, was a <b>lowered</b> {{version of the}} Standard Cub. The rear axle housings were rotated, <b>lowering</b> the tractor about 7-8 inches.

These modifications <b>lowered</b> the center of gravity, and decreased the turning radius, which made the tractor more maneuverable improving the mowing capability of the Cub.|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare one-hand and two-hands <b>lowering</b> activity in terms of biomechanical stress for the range of <b>lowering</b> heights from knuckle height to 10 cm above floor level. Background: Even though two-hands lifting/lowering activity of manual materials handling tasks are prevalent at the industrial site, many manual materials handling tasks which require the worker to perform one-hand lifting/lowering are also very common at the industrial site and forestry and farming. Method: Eight male subjects were asked to perform <b>lowering</b> tasks using both a one-handed as well as a two-handed <b>lowering</b> technique. Trunk muscle electromyographic activity was recorded while the subjects performed the <b>lowering</b> tasks. This information was used as input to an EMG-assisted free-dynamic biomechanical model that predicted spinal loading in three dimensions. Results: It was shown that for the left-hand <b>lowering</b> tasks, the values of moment, lateral shear force, A-P shear force, and compressive force were increased by the average 6 %, as the workload was increased twice from 7. 5 kg to 15 kg. For the right-hand <b>lowering</b> task, these were increased by the average 17 %. For the two-hands <b>lowering</b> tasks, these were increased by the average 14 %. Conclusion: Even though the effect of workload on the biomechanical stress for both one-hand and two-hands <b>lowering</b> tasks is not so significant for the workload less than 15 kg, it can be claimed that the biomechanical stress for one-hand <b>lowering</b> is greater than for two-hands <b>lowering</b> tasks. Therefore, it can be concluded that asymmetrical <b>lowering</b> posture would give greater influence on the biomechanical stress than th...|$|R

Gravity adds to the forces causing this general movement, because the higher pressure compresses the column of air {{near the center of}} the area into greater density – and so greater weight compared to <b>lower</b> pressure, <b>lower</b> density, and <b>lower</b> weight of the air outside the center.|$|E

50|$|Another type of {{approach}} to derive verb-initial word orders involves subject <b>lowering,</b> resulting in a structure in which the subject follows the verb.
