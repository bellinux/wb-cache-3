60|$|But it is Sunday morning, and {{the worker}} is exceptional. Along the road we pass various pedestrians, {{men in their}} black sheepskins, boys in their soldiers' remains. They are trudging from one village to another, across the wild valleys. And {{there is a sense}} of Sunday morning freedom, of roving, as in an English countryside. Only the one old peasant works alone: and a {{goatherd}} watching his <b>long-haired,</b> <b>white</b> goats.|$|E
5000|$|The Maltese is a <b>long-haired</b> <b>white</b> goat characterised by a raven-black {{area on the}} top {{and sides}} of the head and long {{pendulous}} black ears which turn outwards at the tip.|$|E
5000|$|The Appenzell, 'Chèvre d’Appenzell', 'Appenzellerziege', is a {{rare and}} {{endangered}} indigenous breed of <b>long-haired</b> <b>white</b> domestic goat from Switzerland. It originates in the [...] "half-cantons" [...] of the historic Appenzell region, Appenzell Ausserrhoden and Appenzell Innerrhoden, and has spread into the neighbouring Canton of St. Gallen.|$|E
60|$|Elijah did {{not improve}} with time; the years that made him <b>long-haired,</b> <b>whiter,</b> and more owl-like also made him more penurious and grasping, and anxious to {{get the better of}} every person about him. There was {{scarcely}} a poor person in the village--not a field labourer nor shepherd nor farmer's boy, nor any old woman he had employed, who did not consider that they had suffered at his hands. The very poorest could not escape; if he got some one to work for fourpence a day he would find a reason to keep back a portion of the small sum due to him. At the same time he wanted to be well thought of, and at length an opportunity came to him to figure as one who did not live wholly for himself but rather as a person ready to go {{out of his way to}} help his neighbours.|$|R
50|$|The Salish Wool Dog is an extinct {{breed of}} <b>white,</b> <b>long-haired,</b> Spitz-type dog that was {{developed}} and bred by the native peoples {{of what is now}} Washington and British Columbia.|$|R
50|$|The last {{reported}} {{sighting of}} the Chinese lop-eared cat was in 1938 when a droop-eared cat was imported from China. On that last occasion the mutation {{was believed to}} occur only in <b>white</b> <b>long-haired</b> cats.|$|R
5000|$|In Concert: Live at Philharmonic Hall {{included}} illustrations {{inside the}} album by McCoy satirizing mainstream {{rock and roll}} music, with a cartoon music label [...] "Slickophonics" [...] and a <b>long-haired</b> <b>white</b> band with the name [...] "Foot Fooler" [...] {{on the front of}} the drum kit. In a 1974 review of the album, music magazine Coda characterized McCoy's illustrations for this album, and On the Corner, as [...] "tastelessness".|$|E
5000|$|Ann Baker, a Persian cat breeder, {{developed}} the Ragdoll in the 1960s {{starting with the}} offspring of a domestic <b>long-haired</b> <b>white</b> cat named Josephine, selecting for positive temperaments, pleasing looks, and non-matting fur. The Cat Fanciers Association recognized the breed in 1993 in the [...] "miscellaneous" [...] class. Physically, the cats generally have light-colored coats with Siamese-like points, with darker edges {{in areas such as}} the cats' paws and ears. Male ragdolls can become physically quite large, going up to around twenty pounds, even while still maintaining a general sort of playfulness well into adulthood. Since members of the breed are prone to be overly trusting, owners must exercise caution when bringing the cats outdoors. However, the felines generally interact well with children, seniors, and other pets.|$|E
5000|$|Lambright's {{death was}} ruled a murder-suicide, however the {{circumstances}} were questioned by {{his daughter and}} discussed at length in a self-published book in 2005 about Stepin Fetchit. Even Lincoln Perry himself once reported in a LA Times interview his belief that his son was set-up. It was believed that Lambright's involvement with the black power movement {{at the peak of}} the COINTELPRO program was related to his death. A [...] "mysterious <b>long-haired</b> <b>white</b> man" [...] was reported at the scene of the crime who was thought to have been involved in some way. Ultimately, his death was ruled a murder-suicide when the white man wasn't found. Perry never provided child support for Lambright and they only met two years before his son's violent death.|$|E
5000|$|In 1936, a winged cat was {{supposedly}} {{found on a}} farm near Portpatrick, Wigtownshire, Scotland. It was a <b>white</b> <b>long-haired</b> cat, and the wings were flaps 6 in (15 cm) long and 3 in (7.5 cm) wide on its back. They flapped up and down when the cat ran. This is consistent with badly matted fur.|$|R
50|$|Italian Jesuit Martino Martini {{had visited}} China in the 1650s and {{published}} Novus Atlas Sinensis in 1655. In {{the section on}} Peking Province, Martini described a variety of cosetted <b>white,</b> <b>long-haired</b> and long-eared cats found in the region. The breed was once found in region around Peking and probably resembled a long-haired Scottish Fold. His description of white, droop-eared companion cats was copied in 1673 by John Ogilby and by later authors.|$|R
6000|$|I {{hastened to}} Mrs. Fairfax's room; {{there was a}} fire there too, but no candle, and no Mrs. Fairfax. Instead, all alone, sitting upright on the rug, and gazing with gravity at the blaze, I beheld a great black and <b>white</b> <b>long-haired</b> dog, just like the Gytrash of the lane. It was so like it that I went forward and said--"Pilot" [...] and the thing got up and came to me and snuffed me. I caressed him, and he wagged his great tail; but he looked an eerie {{creature}} to be alone with, and I could not tell whence he had come. I rang the bell, for I wanted a candle; and I wanted, too, to get an account of this visitant. Leah entered.|$|R
