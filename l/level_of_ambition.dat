40|$|What is {{at stake}} in the {{standoff}} and suspension of the Doha Round of trade talks? What impact would an agreement based on greater or lesser <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>ambition</b> have on developing countries, whose economies are relatively dependent on agriculture? Using the MIRAGE computable general equilibrium model of the global economy, in this article we compare different scenarios for the Doha agricultural and NAMA negotiations, taking real numbers from the proposals on the table from the United States (US) and the European Union (EU) in December 2005. The results for both scenarios demonstrate the high stakes for successful completion of this negotiation given the positions articulated by the countries involved. A cooperative reform outcome by the US and the EU - based on the most ambitious components of their negotiating proposals - delivers noticeably more benefits than an unambitious outcome. We measure the degree <b>of</b> <b>ambition</b> in each scenario by the construction of a Mercantilist Trade Restrictiveness Index and focus the analysis on the impacts on developing countries.

Our results show that conflicts frequently arise in group work, most commonly caused by different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>ambition</b> among students.

40|$|The United States’ {{decision}} {{to withdraw from}} the Paris Agreement (pending possible re-engagement under different terms) may have significant ramifications for international climate policy, but the implications of this decision remain contested. This commentary illustrates how comparative analysis of US participation in multilateral environmental agreements can inform predictions and future assessments of the decision. We compare and contrast US non-participation in the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement, focusing on four key areas that may condition the influence of US treaty decisions on international climate policy: (i) global momentum on climate change mitigation; (ii) the possibility of US non-participation giving rise to alternative forms of international collaboration on climate policy; (iii) the timing and circumstances of the US {{decision to}} exit; and (iv) the influence of treaty design on countries’ incentives to participate and comply. We find that differences across the two treaties relating to the first three factors are more likely to reduce the negative ramifications of US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement compared to the Kyoto Protocol. However, the increased urgency of deep decarbonization renders US non-participation a major concern despite its declining share of global emissions. Moreover, key design features of the Paris Agreement suggest that other countries may react to the US decision by scaling back their <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>ambition</b> and compliance, even if they remain in the Agreement. Key policy insightsIncreasing global momentum on mitigation since 1997 means that US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement is potentially less damaging than its non-participation in the Kyoto ProtocolDespite the declining US share of global emissions, greater urgency of deep decarbonization means that the non-participation of a major player, such as the US, remains problematic for global cooperation and achieving the Paris Agreement’s goalsDifferences {{in the design of the}} Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement suggest that US non-participation is more likely to prompt reluctant countries to stay within the Paris framework but reduce <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>ambition</b> and compliance, rather than exit the Agreement altogether</p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{focuses on}} {{business}} domain modeling {{as part of}} requirements engi-neering in software development projects. Domain modeling concerns obtaining and model-ing the language (concepts, terminologies; ontologies) used by stakeholders {{to talk about a}} domain. Achieving conceptual clarity and consensus among stakeholders is an important yet often neglected part of requirements engineering. Domain modeling can {{play a key role in}} supporting it. This does, however, require a nuanced approach to language aspects of domain modeling as well as ambition management concerning its goals, and the procedure followed. We provide an analysis of the linguistic complexities involved, as well as <b>of</b> various <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>ambition</b> concerning the domain modeling process. On top of the “classic ” approach to modeling singular, stable domains, we distinguish aspects like incremental modeling, mod-eling of multiple terminologies within a domain, and domain evolution; we will elaborate on the first two aspects. ...|$|R

In Bureaucratic Ambition, Teodoro (2011) shows that public administration career systems shape bureaucrats’ ambitions, political behavior, and management strategies. But career systems are not neutral conduits of talent: administrators are more likely to pursue advancement when career systems favor them. This research proposes that women and men respond to gendered public career systems. Using national and state-level data on public school managers, we find marked gender disparities in the career paths that lead educators from the classroom to the superintendent post. Specifically, we find that female and elementary school teachers take longer to advance than male and secondary school teachers. We also find gender disparities in certification and experiences among school principals. Accordingly, female and elementary principals report lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>ambition.</b> Such gendered career systems may lead to biases in policy agendas and management styles...|$|R
