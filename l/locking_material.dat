In particular the possibility of considering snow as a multistage inhomogeneous <b>locking</b> <b>material</b> under high pressures and impact loading has been investigated. Some uniaxial wave propagation problems under these as-sumptions have been considered. Finite displacements and inhomogeneous distribution of initial density have been considered. The behavior of snow under these assumptions and subjected to impact loading has been discussed. The resulting stresses and velocities have been calculated by numerical methods. Also {{the possibility of using}} impact tests and shock propagation to determine the mechanical properties of snow has been discussed. <b>Locking</b> <b>material</b> is an ideal material or a mathematical approximation of certain real materials.

40|$|This thesis {{endeavors to}} develop a new locking method for a twisted {{morphing}} wing spar. The conventional wing has to have hinges and a discontinuous surface. These cause air separation that decreases aerodynamic performance. Unlike this old concept, the new airfoil comprises a square cross section spar into the wing blade. Twisting the spar changes the airfoil?s angle of attack to control lifting and thrust force without a discontinuous surface. A nastic actuator generates shear stress for twisting the spar. A thermoplastic polymer locks the twisted shape. Applying heat and solidifying the polymer makes the beam lock into the twisted position even after removing the shear stress. This concept was evaluated by computer simulation and an experiment with a prototype construction. The analysis with 5 m long spar shows that + 450 Pa shear stress generated + 2 degrees twist and maximum 1. 49 MN/m spring constant at the spar tip. This spring constant helps a designer select the <b>locking</b> <b>material,</b> Ultem. The analysis proves that the Ultem film?s shear spring constant is high enough to hold the aluminum spar?s spring back. Physical experiment conditions might differ from computer simulation because environmental limitations might be present. The prototype spar has to be less than 300 mm long to fit in an electric oven. Tension made the beam twist and baked it with <b>locking</b> <b>material.</b> When the polymer softened, the beam was taken from the oven and cooled. The solidified <b>locking</b> <b>material</b> held the spar at twisted status. The observation shows no detectable spring back after removing tension. Analytic solution also presents no spring back in twisting the prototype section spar. The FEA of the section spar verifies the physical experiment results. As a normal polymer, the Ultem shows stress relaxation. The load drop affects deceasing elastic modulus. Subsequently, the Ultem is able to lock the twisted spar even after the relaxation...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{propagation}} of compaction waves in a stationary foam block subjected to an impact {{by a small}} mass is studied {{in order to examine}} the mechanism of compaction within the primary and reflected stress waves. The analysis is focused on aluminium strain rate insensitive foam that exhibits strain hardening under quasistatic compression. A theoretical approach is applied using a uniaxial model of compaction in which the compacted strains, being functions of the velocity variation, are not predefined but are obtained {{as a part of the}} solution. The present approach allows one to obtain the strain histories and strain distributions within the primary compaction wave as well as within the reflected wave, which propagates in a media with non-uniform density increasing monotonically in the direction of loading. FE simulations considering aluminium based foam Cymat with density 411. 5 kg/m 3 are carried out in order to verify the proposed theoretical model. A comparison between the impact velocity attenuation predicted by the present model and classical Rigid Perfectly-Plastic <b>Locking</b> <b>material</b> model for cellular materials is discussed...|$|E

40|$|Long-term {{planning}} for nuclear energy systems {{has been an}} area of interest for policy planners and systems designers to assess and manage {{the complexity of the}} system and the long-term, wide-ranging societal impacts of decisions. However, traditional planning tools are often poorly equipped to cope with the deep parametric, structural, and value uncertainties in long-term planning. A more robust, multiobjective decision-making method is applied to a model of the nuclear fuel cycle to address the many sources of complexity, uncertainty, and ambiguity inherent to long-term planning. Unlike prior studies that rely on assessing the outcomes of a limited set of deployment strategies, solutions in this study arise from optimizing behavior against multiple incommensurable objectives, utilizing goal-seeking multiobjective evolutionary algorithms to identify minimax regret solutions across various demand scenarios. By excluding inferior and infeasible solutions, the choice between the Pareto optimal solutions depends on a decision-maker's preferences for the defined outcomes - limiting analyst bias and increasing transparency. Though simplified by the necessity of reducing computational burdens, the nuclear fuel cycle model captures important phenomena governing the behavior of the nuclear energy system relevant to the decision to close the fuel cycle - incorporating reactor population dynamics, material stocks and flows, constraints on material flows, and outcomes of interest to decision-makers. Technology neutral performance criteria are defined consistent with the Generation IV International Forum goals of improved security and proliferation resistance based on structural features of the nuclear fuel cycle, natural resource sustainability, and waste production. A review of safety risks and the economic history of the development of nuclear technology suggests that safety and economic criteria may not be decisive criteria as the safety risks posed by alternative fuel cycles may be comparable in aggregate and economic performance is uncertain and path dependent. Technology strategies impacting reactor lifetimes and advanced reactor introduction dates are evaluated against a high, medium, and phaseout scenarios of nuclear energy demand. Non-dominated, minimax regret solutions are found with the NSGA- II multiobjective evolutionary algorithm. Results suggest that more aggressive technology strategies featuring the early introduction of breeder and burner reactors, possibly combined with lifetime extension of once-through systems, tend to dominate less aggressive strategies under more demanding growth scenarios over the next century. Less aggressive technology strategies that delay burning and breeding tend to be clustered in the minimax regret space, suggesting greater sensitivity to shifts in preferences. Lifetime extension strategies can unexpectedly result in fewer deployments of once-through systems, permitting the growth of advanced systems to meet demand. Both breeders and burners are important for controlling plutonium inventories with breeders achieving lower inventories in storage by <b>locking</b> <b>material</b> in reactor cores while burners can reduce the total inventory in the system. Other observations include the indirect impacts of some performance measures, the relatively small impact of technology strategies on the waste properties of all material in the system, and the difficulty of phasing out nuclear energy while meeting all objectives with the specified technology options...|$|E

Unfortunately, liberation distribution {{is very difficult to}} measure accurately. One problem is the stereological effect associated with a microscopic liberation analysis. Many methods have been proposed to correct for the stereological effect, but they remain essentially untested, in part {{due to the lack of}} a standard or reference material. In this work, a method was established to create an artificial standard material. Silica grains were placed in an epoxy resin to create a block of material that was crushed to yield liberated and locked particles.

The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate an alternative treatment using isolated axial interfragmentary compression for the dynamisation of humeral shaft nonunion after retrograde <b>locked</b> nailing. <b>Materials</b> and methods Between January 2000 and May 2009, 124 humeral shaft fractures were treated in our trauma department with retrograde locked nailing using the unreamed humeral nail (UHN®, Synthes, Paoli, PA, USA). Nonunion occurred in seven patients (5. 6 %) – five females and two males, mean age 44 years (range: 17 – 73 years). The nonunion was treated by applying isolated secondary interfragmentary compression. Mean follow-up was 43 months (range: 8 – 74 months). The Rommens score and the disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand (DASH) score were used to evaluate the global functioning of the upper limb. Results The compression procedure was successful in all seven cases. In each case, the union occurred without any complications in 3 – 5 months. The mean DASH score was 25 / 100 (range: 8. 3 – 60. 8 / 100). The Rommens score was judged excellent for five of the seven patients but two were rated moderate.
