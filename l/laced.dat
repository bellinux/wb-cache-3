5|$|With {{the breed}} that carries his name, John Sebright {{intentionally}} {{set out to}} create a very small bantam chicken with <b>laced</b> plumage similar to the <b>laced</b> variety of Polish chickens. Although the exact makeup of the breed is uncertain, he {{is thought to have}} crossed British, Hamburgh, Nankin and Polish birds with a base of Rosecombs before achieving a <b>laced</b> chicken that would breed true. After the breed's establishment circa 1810, Sebright founded The Sebright Bantam Club, which was the very first individual breed association for chickens. The breed has appeared in the American Poultry Association's Standard of Perfection since the first edition in 1874. Today, the breed is one of the ten most popular bantam chickens, according to the American Bantam Association.|$|E

5|$|Fueled by the {{negative}} press, and despite an injured leg, McNamara led Syracuse on a {{run to the}} Big East tournament title. In the first round he hit a running one-handed three-point shot {{with less than a}} second left in the game to spur Syracuse past the University of Cincinnati, 74-73. Following the game Jim Boeheim unleashed a passionate profanity <b>laced</b> defense of his star player to the attending media.|$|E
50|$|Part <b>lace</b> or {{sectional}} <b>lace</b> {{is a way}} {{of making}} bobbin <b>lace.</b> It characterises various styles, such as Honiton <b>lace</b> or Brussels <b>lace.</b>|$|R

5|$|He {{perceived}} {{books as}} permanent objects that were invested with power. This power was {{unique in that}} it could transmit ideas to people of different times, cultures, and interests, and do so in ways other art forms could not. This ambition <b>laced</b> all of his work, particularly in his later years. Lissitzky was devoted {{to the idea of}} creating art with power and purpose, art that could invoke change.|$|E
5|$|Boyd had {{her first}} {{encounter}} with LSD in early 1965 when the couple's dentist, John Riley, secretly <b>laced</b> her coffee with the drug during a dinner party at his home. As she {{was getting ready to}} leave with Harrison and John and Cynthia Lennon, Riley told them that he had spiked their drinks and tried to persuade them to stay. Outside, Boyd was in an agitated state from the drug and threatened to break a store window, but Harrison pulled her away. Later, when Boyd and her group were in a lift on their way up to the Ad Lib club, they mistakenly believed it was on fire.|$|E
5|$|During {{an autopsy}} on Susan Snow, Assistant Medical Examiner Janet Miller {{detected}} {{the scent of}} bitter almonds, an odor distinctive to cyanide. Tests verified that Snow had died of acute cyanide poisoning. Investigators examined {{the contents of the}} Snow-Webking household and discovered the source of the cyanide: the bottle of Extra-Strength Excedrin capsules that both Snow and Webking had used the morning of Snow's death. Three capsules out of those that remained in the 60-capsule bottle were found to be <b>laced</b> with cyanide in toxic quantities.|$|E
50|$|It is a {{continuous}} <b>lace,</b> {{meaning that it}} was made in one piece on a <b>lace</b> pillow, using the same threads in the pattern as in the ground, or réseau. Antwerp <b>lace</b> {{is very similar to}} Mechlin <b>lace,</b> which was also made in Antwerp. Antwerp <b>lace</b> is heavier and sturdier than Mechlin <b>lace.</b> It has a cordonnet, or a flat thread outlining the pattern, just as Mechlin <b>lace</b> does. The cordonnet was very strong and rather coarse. Antwerp <b>lace</b> was also similar to Binche <b>lace</b> in its cordonnet. The réseau or ground for Antwerp <b>lace</b> varies from the same hexagonal ground as Mechlin <b>lace</b> to a tessellation-pattern featuring a six-pointed star.|$|R
50|$|Genoese <b>lace</b> was a guipure <b>lace.</b> Genoese lacemakers went to Malta {{to found}} {{the style of}} Maltese <b>lace.</b> This later {{inspired}} the style of English <b>lace</b> known as Bedfordshire <b>lace.</b>|$|R
50|$|Battenberg <b>lace</b> {{is a type}} of tape <b>lace.</b> The {{name for}} this American <b>lace</b> was chosen in honour of a wedding of the Battenberg family, which {{occurred}} about the time a patent for making the <b>lace</b> was applied for at Washington. Originally Battenberg <b>lace</b> was heavier than the other machine tape <b>laces</b> such as Princess <b>lace.</b>|$|R
5|$|FBI {{special agent}} Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) goes to {{investigate}} the murder. The victim, a twenty-two-year-old backpacker, now shows signs of body decay usually associated with old age. Later, at a pay-phone, she asks her partner, John Doggett (Robert Patrick), to check the X-Files for cases mentioning glycoproteins. While discussing the case with Doggett, the bus passes her, and she follows it to a gas station {{in the middle of}} the desert. A man with an injured hand learns that she is a medical doctor and fills her car with gasoline <b>laced</b> with water. Scully returns to the gas station and is told that rain got into the gas canisters.|$|E
5|$|In {{his book}} Popular Contemporary Writers, Michael D. Sharp {{describes}} Vonnegut's linguistic style as straightforward; his sentences concise, his language simple, his paragraphs brief, and his ordinary tone conversational. Vonnegut uses this style to convey normally complex subject matter {{in a way}} that is intelligible to a large audience. He credited his time as a journalist for his ability, pointing to his work with the Chicago City News Bureau, which required him to convey stories in telephone conversations. Vonnegut's compositions are also <b>laced</b> with distinct references to his own life, notably in Slaughterhouse-Five and Slapstick.|$|E
5|$|One {{month after}} her {{attempted}} suicide, Wollstonecraft agreed {{to undertake the}} long and treacherous journey to Scandinavia in order to resolve Imlay's business difficulties. Not only was her journey to Scandinavia fraught with peril (she was a woman travelling alone {{during a time of}} war), it was also <b>laced</b> with sorrow and anger. While Wollstonecraft initially believed that the trip might resurrect their relationship, she eventually recognized that it was doomed, particularly after Imlay failed to meet her in Hamburg. Wollstonecraft's despair increased as her journey progressed.|$|E

50|$|Needle <b>lace</b> (also {{known as}} needlelace or needle-made <b>lace</b> or point <b>lace)</b> {{is a type}} of <b>lace</b> created using a needle and thread to stitch up {{hundreds}} of small stitches to form the <b>lace</b> itself.|$|R
5000|$|Originally crocheted <b>lace</b> was not {{regarded}} as true <b>lace.</b> Crocheting {{was considered an}} easy, and less time-consuming, but otherwise clearly inferior surrogate for [...] "true" [...] <b>lace</b> such as bobbin <b>lace,</b> needle <b>lace</b> or [...] netting. The first examples of crocheted <b>lace</b> try to reproduce the products of other lacemaking techniques as faithfully as possible. Later, the many possibilities and inherent beauty of crocheted <b>lace</b> were appreciated more.|$|R
5|$|Since the 20th century, actual metal corsets have {{occasionally}} {{been made}} for contemporary wear, although such instances are rare. Steele notes that alongside a 1930s metal corset made for and worn by a fetish corsetiere called Cayne, the late 20th- and early 21st-century tight-lacer Cathie Jung had a silver corset-cover made to wear over her actual <b>laced</b> corset. Between 1933 and 1940 Mrs. Cayne advertised a booklet describing her 14-inch waistline and offered other services in the Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News.|$|E
5|$|To {{better control}} the {{population}} of termites, various methods {{have been developed to}} track termite movements. One early method involved distributing termite bait <b>laced</b> with immunoglobulin G (IgG) marker proteins from rabbits or chickens. Termites collected from the field could be tested for the rabbit-IgG markers using a rabbit-IgG-specific assay. More recently developed, less expensive alternatives include tracking the termites using egg white, cow milk, or soy milk proteins, which can be sprayed on termites in the field. Termites bearing these proteins can be traced using a protein-specific ELISA test.|$|E
5|$|To this end, {{a crew of}} 12 {{prepared}} a ship that had been seized in Gibraltar. They disguised vertical logs of wood with headwear, to make the Spaniards believe that the vessel was fully crewed. To make it look more heavily armed, additional portholes were cut in the hull and logs placed to resemble cannons. Barrels of powder {{were placed in the}} ship and grappling irons <b>laced</b> into the ships rigging, to catch the ropes and sails of Magdalen and ensure the vessels would become entangled.|$|E
50|$|The Scranton <b>Lace</b> Company, {{also known}} as the Scranton <b>Lace</b> Curtain Company and Scranton <b>Lace</b> Curtain Manufacturing Company, was an American <b>lace</b> {{manufacturer}} in Scranton, Pennsylvania.|$|R
50|$|The {{very early}} bobbin <b>laces</b> were {{probably}} made freehand, as pins were scarce, coarse, and expensive. At first, the <b>laces</b> were purely utilitarian: “seaming” <b>laces</b> (insertions) joining narrow widths of fabric, and toothed or scalloped <b>laces</b> reinforcing the edges (edgings). Many {{of the later}} freehand <b>laces</b> were also functional, but some areas produced very wide ornamental <b>laces.</b>|$|R
50|$|Arras <b>lace</b> {{refers to}} a form of pure white bobbin <b>lace</b> that was made at Arras, France, from the 17th to 19th centuries. It is similar to, but {{stronger}} than Lille <b>lace.</b> Arras also produced gold <b>lace</b> and a lightweight <b>lace</b> called mignonette.|$|R
5|$|Much of {{the return}} flows do not issue {{directly}} back into the Snake River, but rather feed the Snake River Aquifer underneath the Snake River Plain. Water diverted from the river for irrigation, after absorbing any surface pollutants, re-enters the ground and feeds the aquifer. Although the aquifer has maintained its level, {{it has become increasingly}} <b>laced</b> with contaminants. Water in the aquifer eventually travels to {{the west side of the}} Snake River Plain and re-enters the river as springs. Throughout much of the Snake River Plain and Hells Canyon, excessive sediment is also a recurring problem. In December 2007, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a permit requiring owners of fish farms along the Snake River to reduce their phosphorus discharge by 40%. Pollutant levels in Hells Canyon upstream of the Salmon River confluence, including that of water temperature, dissolved nutrients, and sediment, are required to meet certain levels.|$|E
5|$|She {{appeared}} in singer Courtney Love's backing band on her 2004 America's Sweetheart tour {{and returned to}} Europe. She released the 2006 album Opheliac with the German label Trisol Music Group. In 2007, she released Laced/Unlaced; the re-release of On a Day... appeared as <b>Laced</b> with songs on the electric violin as Unlaced. She later left Trisol to join New-York-based The End Records in 2009 and release Opheliac in the United States, where previously it had only been available as an import. In 2012, she released the album Fight Like a Girl. She {{played the role of}} Painted Doll in Darren Lynn Bousman's 2012 film The Devil's Carnival, as well as its 2015 sequel, Alleluia! The Devil's Carnival.|$|E
5|$|Starfish may be preyed on by conspecifics, other starfish species, tritons, crabs, fish, gulls and sea otters. Their first {{lines of}} defence are the {{saponins}} present in their body walls, which have unpleasant flavours. Some starfish such as Astropecten polyacanthus also include powerful toxins such as tetrodotoxin among their chemical armoury, and the slime star can ooze out {{large quantities of}} repellent mucus. They also have body armour {{in the form of}} hard plates and spines. The crown-of-thorns starfish is particularly unattractive to potential predators, being heavily defended by sharp spines, <b>laced</b> with toxins and sometimes with bright warning colours. Other species protect their vulnerable tube feet and arm tips by lining their ambulacral grooves with spines and heavily plating their extremities.|$|E
50|$|Torchon <b>lace</b> {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} <b>laces,</b> and is common to many lace-making regions such as Belgium, France, Italy, Saxony, Sweden and Spain. Due to its simplicity, torchon <b>lace</b> is {{generally}} the first <b>lace</b> a lacemaker learns to make, and has been since at least the 19th century. It only requires a few bobbins and uses thicker thread than other <b>laces,</b> which makes it easier to learn on. It is also the simplest of all the grounded <b>laces.</b> Beggar's <b>lace</b> is an alternative term for torchon <b>lace.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In the 1870s {{the second}} French empire collapsed, {{concurrently}} fashion changed. The cheaper guipures were affected but the better Brussels <b>laces</b> stayed {{in demand for}} wedding trousseaux. Designs and technique however remained much the same. [...] Individuality of <b>lace</b> types decreased and interest for making <b>lace</b> as a hobby increased. In the 1880s the <b>lace</b> industry revived with imitations of old <b>laces.</b> Aalst developed a <b>lace</b> with a technique based on Duchesse <b>lace.</b> The frequent little roses gave the <b>lace</b> its name: Rosaline. The same name {{has been used for}} a seventeenth century Venetian needle <b>lace</b> with similar design. The Belgian Rosaline was produced until the 1950s and rediscovered in 1980s. The <b>lace</b> is flexible to changing fashion. Worn and unsold pieces could be reassembled.|$|R
50|$|The Barmen <b>lace</b> machine {{makes perfect}} copies of torchon <b>lace</b> and the simpler hand-made bobbin <b>lace.</b> Its bobbins imitate the {{movements}} of the bobbins of the hand-made <b>lace</b> maker.|$|R
5|$|In the 1st and 2nd centuries, a Roman soldier's clothes {{consisted}} of a single-piece, short-sleeved tunic the hem of which reached the knees and special hobnailed sandals (caligae). This attire, which left the arms and legs bare, had evolved in a Mediterranean climate and was not suitable for northern Europe in cold weather. In northern Europe, long-sleeved tunics, trousers (bracae), socks (worn inside the caligae) and <b>laced</b> boots were commonly worn in winter from the 1st century. During the 3rd century, these items of clothing became much more widespread, apparently common in Mediterranean provinces also. However, {{it is likely that}} in warmer weather, trousers were dispensed with and caligae worn instead of socks and boots. Late Roman clothing was often highly decorated, with woven or embroidered strips, clavi, circular roundels, orbiculi, or square panels, tabulae, added to tunics and cloaks. These colourful decorative elements usually {{consisted of}} geometrical patterns and stylised plant motifs, but could include human or animal figures. A distinctive part of a soldier's costume, though it seems to have also been worn by non-military bureaucrats, was a type of round, brimless hat known as the pannonian cap (pileus pannonicus).|$|E
5|$|On 19 August 1942 a major landing {{took place}} at the French coastal town of Dieppe. The main force was {{provided}} by the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, supported by No. 3 and No. 4 Commandos. The mission of No. 3 Commando was to neutralize a German coastal battery near Berneval-le-Grand that {{was in a position to}} fire upon the landing at Dieppe. The landing craft carrying No. 3 Commando ran into a German coastal convoy. Only a handful of commandos, under the second in command Major Peter Young, landed and scaled the barbed wire <b>laced</b> cliffs. Eventually 18 Commandos reached the perimeter of the battery via Berneval and engaged the target with small arms fire. Although unable to destroy the guns, they prevented the Germans from firing effectively on the main assault by harassing their gun crews with sniper fire. In a subsidiary operation No. 4 Commando landed in force along with the French Troop No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando and 50 United States Army Rangers and destroyed the artillery battery at Varengeville. Most of No. 4 Commando safely returned to England. Captain Patrick Porteous of No. 4 Commando was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions during the raid.|$|E
5|$|Other hunting traditions then follow, again {{rooted in}} religion. The warriors of the Kuru tribe in Africa commit a sacred act {{in which they}} copulate with the ground in belief that it will make the Earth fertile and produce animals for the hunt, and a stag hunt in France, rooted in ancient pagan beliefs of the Gauls, is blessed by a mass before the hunt takes place, during which the hunters and dogs chase and {{ultimately}} kill a fleeing stag. In a fox hunt, the Wild Fox Association sabotages the hunting efforts by serving wine <b>laced</b> with a laxative to the hunters and distracting the dogs with an Afghan bitch in heat. Their efforts are then connected to species conservation, and to exemplify that hunters are truly concerned in wildlife conservation, Argentine hunters capture an Andean condor to sell to a zoo. A collage of other conservation efforts is shown, including the tagging of white rhinoceroses, grizzly bears and elephants, which are shot with morphine darts. Argentinian deer and elephant seals are physically subdued and marked. Tourists on Africans safaris then come to view the conservation efforts, which the narrator claims to have seemingly negated the animals' violent instincts. This deception is demonstrated with the mauling of a tourist named Pit Dernitz by lions.|$|E
