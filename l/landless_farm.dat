40|$|Years of poor {{nutrient}} management {{practices in the}} agriculture industry in the North China Plain have led to large losses of nutrients to the environment, causing severe ecological consequences. Analyzing farm nutrient flows is urgently {{needed in order to}} reduce nutrient losses. A farm-level nutrient flow model was developed in this study based on the NUFER (NUtrient flows in Food chains, Environment and Resources use) model, and was used to analyze nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) flows, use efficiencies, and losses for nine representative farm types in the North China Plain. Data from 401 farms were evaluated for the years 2012 – 2015. The analysis showed that mixed farms were more efficient in nutrient utilization than crop-based or <b>landless</b> livestock <b>farms.</b> The efficiencies of N and P used in crop production were highest for mixed dairy farms, reaching 67 % for N and 68 % for P. Consistently, mixed dairy farms had the lowest N and P surpluses and losses in crop production. Mixed swine farms were 5 and 9 % higher in N and P efficiency in livestock production than <b>landless</b> swine <b>farms,</b> respectively. Losses of N and P from the animal manure management chain were 20 – 42 % lower for mixed swine and 69 – 78 % lower for mixed poultry <b>farms</b> than for <b>landless</b> <b>farms</b> of the same animal type. This is at least partially due to more frequent manure removal. Integrated crop-livestock production using livestock wastes as crop fertilizer was shown to be the most sustainable model in nutrient use for the agriculture industry in the North China Plain...|$|R

40|$|Differences in soil, {{climate and}} {{socioeconomic}} conditions cause animal production to vary widely between European regions, notably in animal density and percentage <b>landless</b> <b>farming.</b> They {{have in common}} that animal products result from the cycling and redistribution of nutrients through soil, air, plants, animals and manure, with energy from photosynthesis or from the input of fossil energy as driving force. Nature of nutrients and rates of their conversion vary between and within cycle components, and consequently imbalances occur, causing undesired nutrient losses to or extractions from soil, water and air. Nutrients causing environmental concern are those containing excessive phosphorus (P), potassium (K) and nitrate (NO 3 -) contaminating soil and water and those losing the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) into the air. Successful and feasible interventions are to extensify, to reduce external inputs and to optimise. Maximum stocking density should not exceed 2. 0 livestock units (LU) /ha. Reductions in external inputs of N, P and K are possible through reduction in fertiliser inputs and by reducing or applying compositional changes of dietary inputs. Optimisation at farm level includes implementing the nutritive measures mentioned above combined with an increased reproductive efficiency by lowering the number of parent animals. Animal manure {{should be treated as}} a commodity rather as a waste, with a tailor made composition to be achieved by nutrition or by fractionation. The recommended measures require legal and mental interventions, the success of which will largely depend on the quality of legislation and the acceptability of its implementation.

One of Turner's last students, Merle Curti used in-depth analysis of local history in Trempeleau County to test Turner's thesis about democracy. Turner's view was that American democracy, [...] "involved widespread participation in the making of decisions affecting the common life, the development of initiative and self-reliance, and equality of economic and cultural opportunity. It thus also involved Americanization of immigrant." [...] Curti found that from 1840 to 1860 in Wisconsin the poorest groups gained rapidly in land ownership, and often rose to political leadership at the local level. He found that even <b>landless</b> young <b>farm</b> workers were soon able to obtain their own farms. Free land on the frontier therefore created opportunity and democracy, for both European immigrants as well as old stock Yankees.|$|R

40|$|After {{short-lived}} {{growth in}} the early 1990 s, Russia’s private family farming sector has been characterized by stagnation, while ownership of former collective and state farms is increasingly concentrated {{in the hands of}} the rural elite.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} people’s {{attempts to}} (re) construct belonging and authority after rapid socio-political and economic change. It {{is a study}} of the lives of those living alongside each other in a new resettlement area in Zimbabwe a decade after ‘fast track’ land reform. Drawing on ethnographic research conducted on a series of farms in the Mazowe area (March 2012 -May 2013), I show that in the uncertain socio-political context of this new resettlement area, belonging was a dynamic social process involving complex moral bonds, and relationships of dependence and obligation. ‘Fast track’ land reform can be understood as a process of state-making in which the Zimbabwean state reconfigured its relationship with its citizens via the redistribution of land. After ‘fast track’, farms were transformed from socially and politically bounded entities under the paternalistic rule of white farmers, to areas in which land beneficiaries and farm workers lived alongside one another under the rule of the ZANU PF state. Land was allocated according to ZANU PF loyalty. Farmworkers due to their associations with white farmers and oppositional politics, were rarely allocated land. Thus farms in Mazowe consisted of <b>landless</b> <b>farm</b> workers who had lived and worked in the area for generations, and landed beneficiaries who came from a variety of places. In addition, ‘fast track’ was framed in terms of redistribution rather than restitution but many chiefs saw it as an opportunity to ‘return’ to their ancestral lands. However, their claims to authority in the areas remained uncertain. I examine how people dealt with the various tensions thrown up by ‘fast track’. By leaving these tensions unresolved, a contingent stability was generated on farms, even as this was fragile. My work contributes to better understanding the socio-political effects of land reform. Research on Zimbabwean land reform has tended to rely on official framings of people’s relationships to each other and the land, and has largely failed to capture the complexity and negotiated nature of these in everyday life. Anthropological work on belonging has mostly focused on explicit claims. I show how history and the micro-politics of everyday relationships profoundly shaped local forms of belonging which crosscut state delimitations of who belonged, and what land reform meant to those living in this area...|$|E

40|$|Improved {{management}} of nitrogen (N) in agriculture {{is necessary to}} achieve a sustainable balance between the production of food and other biomass, and the unwanted effects of N on water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity deterioration and human health. To analyse farm N-losses and the complex interactions within farming systems, efficient methods for identifying emissions hotspots and evaluating mitigation measures are therefore needed. The present paper aims to fill this gap at the farm and landscape scales. Six agricultural landscapes in Poland (PL), the Netherlands (NL), France (FR), Italy (IT), Scotland (UK) and Denmark (DK) were studied, and a common method was developed for undertaking farm inventories and the derivation of farm N balances, N surpluses and for evaluating uncertainty for the 222 farms and 11 440 ha of farmland included in the study. In all landscapes, a large variation in the farm N surplus was found, and thereby a large potential for reductions. The highest average N surpluses {{were found in the}} most livestock-intensive landscapes of IT, FR, and NL; on average 202 ± 28, 179 ± 63 and 178 ± 20 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1 , respectively. All landscapes showed hotspots, especially from livestock farms, including a special UK case with large-scale <b>landless</b> poultry <b>farming.</b> Overall, the average N surplus from the land-based UK farms dominated by extensive sheep and cattle grazing was only 31 ± 10 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1 , but was similar to the N surplus of PL and DK (122 ± 20 and 146 ± 55 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1 , respectively) when <b>landless</b> poultry <b>farming</b> was included. We found farm N balances to be a useful indicator for N losses and the potential for improving N management. Significant correlations to N surplus were found, both with ammonia air concentrations and nitrate concentrations in soils and groundwater, measured during the period of N management data collection in the landscapes from 2007 – 2009. This indicates that farm N surpluses may be used as an independent dataset for validation of measured and modelled N emissions in agricultural landscapes. No significant correlation was found with N measured in surface waters, probably because of spatial and temporal variations in groundwater buffering and biogeochemical reactions affecting N flows from farm to surface waters. A case study of the development in N surplus from the landscape in DK from 1998 – 2008 showed a 22 % reduction related to measures targeted at N emissions from livestock farms. Based on the large differences in N surplus between average N management farms and the most modern and N-efficient farms, it was concluded that additional N-surplus reductions of 25 – 50 %, as compared to the present level, were realistic in all landscapes. The implemented N-surplus method was thus effective for comparing and synthesizing results on farm N emissions and the potentials of mitigation options. It is recommended for use in combination with other methods for the assessment of landscape N emissions and farm N efficiency, including more detailed N source and N sink hotspot mapping, measurements and modelling...|$|R

For the period of 2010 - 2030, we explored possible effects of technological and managerial measures aimed at improving the performances of pig production via scenario analysis. We used and further developed the NUtrient flows in Food Chains, Environment and Resources use (NUFER) model to calculate the feed requirement and consumption, and N and P losses in different pig production systems for all the years Between 1960 and 2010, pig production has largely shifted from the so-called backyard system to landless systems. The N use efficiencies at fattener level increased from 18 to 28 %, due to the increased animal productivity. However, the N use efficiencies at the Whole system level decreased from 46 to 11 % during this period, mainly due to the increase of <b>landless</b> pig <b>farms,</b> which rely on imported feed and have no land-base for manure disposal. The total N and P losses were 5289 and 829 Gg in 2010, which is 30 and 95 times higher than in 1960. In the business as usual scenario, the total N and P losses were projected to increase by 25 and 55 % between 2010 and 2030, respectively. Analyses of other scenarios indicate that packages of technological and managerial measures can decrease total N and P losses by 64 and 95 % respectively.

The net returns from dairying have been found as Rs 25, 864, which is about 29. 7 per cent to the total and it also could contribute maximum to employment (55 per cent). The optimal plan for small-farmer category has revealed that dairy animals have contributed maximum net returns (Rs 31, 640) to the aggregate net returns (Rs 49, 105). Dairy animals have also generated an employment of 840 humandays as against 45, 80 and 38. 6 humandays, from paddy–I, paddy–II and groundnut crops, respectively. The optimal plan for marginal farmers has indicated that dairy animals and sheep could be more attractive in terms of income and employment generation. Optimal plan for landless households has revealed that 5 dairy animals, 15 goats and 15 sheep could be valuable for increasing their income and employment. Income increase in the optimal farm plans has been found maximum (223. 5 per cent) in large-farmer category, followed by small (192. 7 per cent), marginal (180. 1 per cent) and landless households (116 per cent).

As a result, substantial efforts in agricultural R&D have been directed towards design of new technologies for smallholder dairy farming. Variable success in technology transfer has clearly shown that adoption is context-specific, related to the physical and socio-economic environment, access of farmers to resources, access to information and personal attitudes. A series of concepts and methods were developed to incorporate these considerations, and to replace narrow technology-driven approaches by broader ones such as Farming Systems Research (FSR). This thesis describes and analyses experiences of BAIF, an Indian NGO, with the use of FSR methodology in livestock development programmes in Gujarat, India. The objectives were to identify criteria and methodologies for selection of appropriate livestock technologies for farm level, and to identify differences in the methods of selection of appropriate technology. Section 1 describes the variation in livestock production systems in India in general and in Gujarat-state. Livestock comprises defined and undefined breeds of cattle and buffalo. Total livestock population increased annually by over 1 % in the last four decades, with buffalo and goat populations increasing faster than cattle. This section also gives background to the BAIF organization and to FSR methodologies. Section 2 more specifically describes the Gujarat research area with agro-ecological zone-wise information on animal breeds, herd composition, feed resources, crops, and trends in seasonal availability of feed as derived from transects, Participatory Rural Appraisals, and mapping. Constraint analysis and modelling indicated limited genetic potential of the local breeds and shortage of feed resources, both quantitatively and qualitatively, as major constraints for livestock development. Crossbreeding for breed improvement and use of (improved) local feed resources were identified as suitable technologies to alleviate these constraints. Ex-post performance monitoring of some BAIF crossbreeding programmes show that crossbred cattle fitted well in the smallholder mixed farming systems of both tribal and non-tribal farmers in all three selected agro-ecological zones (Section 3). Milk production of crossbreds was substantially higher, as was livestock gross margin and household income. Although quality of the roughages is a major limiting factor, farmers owning crossbreds tried to adjust to the needs of the cows by feeding concentrates. There was no difference in workload and labour division between households with and without crossbreds. Crossbreeding thus proved a techno-economically and socially viable livelihood option for both mixed and <b>landless</b> <b>farming</b> systems in Gujarat. Various modelling approaches were used in Section 4 to explore, ex ante, the suitability of feeding technologies such as urea supplementation, use of local and commercial concentrates, urea-treated straw with concentrates, and leuceana tree leaves for crop-livestock systems in Gujarat, India. Major conclusions were that (i) concentrate feeding is beneficial to farmers with market access and crossbred cows, (ii) crossbreeding interventions are more remunerative for landless and tribal farmers than for non-tribal farmers; feeding interventions are more effective for crossbreds than for local cows, (iii) maximum farm income is achieved at medium milk yields per animal; higher milk yields require use of better feeds, which renders the straws of the grains useless for feeding; at farm level, the (economically) optimum cropping pattern would then shift from grain crops to cotton. This section continues with a narrative on BAIF's experiences with field testing of technologies at animal, at herd, at farm and watershed level, including a shift to crop research when dictated by local needs. Over a period of roughly 30 years, three phases in on-field testing can be distinguished, i. e., starting with a period of predominantly top-down approaches, moving to a phase with emphasis on participatory identification and testing of technologies, and then into a phase with work at community and watershed level. A few cases are discussed for each phase, illustrating the processes, methods and types of technologies involved, and drawing lessons on field experimentation for livestock and rural development in general. The studies brought out, among others, that adoption of technologies is facilitated when these u se local (feed) resources, that are readily available, requires only small changes in farm practices, are relatively simple to implement, and yield tangible results in the short term. Section 5 analyses the dynamics in methods and approaches of BAIF's work on livestock development, as it grew from Gandhian roots into a large development organization. It emphasises the dynamics in approaches between top-down, objectivist and reductionist approaches on one hand and bottom-up, constructivist, holistic and self-organized approaches on the other hand. These experiences are set against similar developments on the (inter) national scene and in industrialized countries, along with factors that influence the changes, suggesting that agricultural R&D behaves as a complex adaptive system with its own dynamics and associated paradigm shifts. It also discusses a number of cross-cutting issues such as the notion of real versus perceived problems, hierarchy and grid, phases in development and aspects of holism versus reductionism, also reflected in notions of goal and process orientation. Concluding, the thesis considers development as a continuous process, of which the goals change over time-and-space. This reflects a paradigm issue, and if development is indeed a dynamic process it implies that choice of methodology and technology) should go along with changes occurring in that process. Some guidelines regarding the usefulness of approaches and technologies are given. But agricultural R&D is ultimately considered to be a complex adaptive system, also in Gujarat, and development organizations such as BAIF have to, therefore, show dynamic behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Examines whether {{nuclear family}} {{households}} are gaining ground in India {{at the expense}} of joint family households, based on a questionnaire survey of all 544 households of 3 villages in the Arambagh region of the Hooghly District of West Bengal. The findings suggest that: (1) although the joint family household is not the typical household in rural West Bengal, either in terms of its proportion among all households or in terms of people belonging to it, it shows a remarkable stability, & thus provides support to the cyclical view that joint family households are relatively stable in their rate of incidence, & nuclear family households are transitional forms in the normal functioning of the developmental cycle of joint family units; (2) the developmental cycle of formation & dissolution of joint family households varies by different groups in a village in that the proportion of joint family households tends to be significantly higher among household heads who are age 45 +, own land, operate large farms, follow agricultural occupations, belong to high or middle castes, &/or are literate, than among those who are age 44 or younger, <b>landless,</b> operate smaller <b>farms,</b> follow nonagricultural occupations, belong to low castes, or are illiterate; (3) only four characteristics - age, landownership, occupation, & literacy - are independently related to the incidence of household types, & they show a stronger relationship to household types when combined into an index than does each characteristic, except age, related singly; & (4) once the household head is age 45 +, regardless of his other characteristics, & his first son is old enough to bring his wife into the household, his probability of heading a joint family increases significantly. The high proportion of nuclear family households in the 3 villages suggest that married sons tend to separate from their parental households almost immediately after they themselves become parents. The joint family household, however, persists as a unit for a relatively longer period of time after it comes into existence among those people in a village who own land, follow agricultural occupations, & are literate. 7 Tables, 16 References.

40|$|The {{poor and}} the prosperous Ramamoorthi, a <b>landless</b> and {{illiterate}} <b>farm</b> labourer, dug up an idol by acci-dent and {{was found guilty of}} theft when he sold it for £ 16; Meivel, the dealer’s runner, impressed the London judge as a rogue; Chandran was on bail for attempted murder and convicted of rioting with a deadly weapon; Hussain was found in possession of another six stolen idols; Nadar also had a history of dealings with stolen idols, while the dealer in London supplied a false provenance {{which turned out to be}} from his mother in Pakistan. These were among the details revealed in the English High Court in the claim by the Union of India for the return of the idol from the Bumper Development Cor-poration. Such cases often reveal the workings of the illicit trade in cultural property and are of great use to those fighting this per-nicious problem. The New Zealand gov-ernment incurred £ 300, 000 in costs in the Ortiz case and the Indian govern-ment £ 100, 000, ultimately recovered, in the Bumper Case. The Bumper Case detailed some of the methods used for identification – analysis of artistic style and technique, the exact composition of the bronze, exact measurements, even the pattern of termite tracks over the sur-face. A spade-mark on the Maori carved wooden panels in the Ortiz case, pho-tographed before their illicit export from New Zealand, found a precise match on the piece located in London. Both these cases alerted collectors to the criminal activity providing the international mar-ket with a seemingly endless supply of works of art and antiquities, and warned dealers that buying Maori antiquities or Hindu idols was a risky business. Yet, guardians of cultural heritage often remain unaware of case details from neighbouring countries, though knowl-edge here would allow for better deci-sions regarding the remedy to pursue, its cost, and the likelihood of success. Case studies need not be restricted to lit-igation: negotiated settlements between individuals or institutions are as impor-tant, as are returns effected through cooperation between police, customs and other relevant authorities, govern-ment to government negotiations, and the work of the relevant UNESCO Committee...|$|R
25|$|The most {{controversial}} measure Caesar introduced was an agrarian bill to allot plots {{of land to}} the <b>landless</b> poor to <b>farm.</b> Conservative aristocrats had a tradition of vehemently opposing land redistribution and most such bills were not passed. In Cassius Dio’s opinion, Caesar tried to appear to promote {{the interests of the}} optimates {{as well as those of}} the people, and said that he would not introduce his land reform if they did not agree with it. He read the draft of the bill to the senate, asked for the option of each senator and promised to amend or scrap any clause that had raised objections. The optimates were annoyed because the bill, to their embarrassment, could not be criticised. Moreover, it would give Caesar popularity and power. Even though no optimate spoke against it, no one expressed approval. The law would distribute public and private land to all citizens instead of just Pompey’s veterans and would do so without any expense for the city or any loss for the optimates. It would be financed with the proceeds from Pompey’s war booty and the new tributes and taxes in the east Pompey established with his victories in the Third Mithridatic War. Private land was to be bought at the price assessed in the tax-lists to ensure fairness. The land commission in charge of the allocations would be large and have twenty members so that it would not be small commission run by a clique and many men would share the honour. Caesar added that it would be run by the most suitable men. This was an invitation to the optimates to apply for these posts. He ruled himself out of the commission to avoid suggestions that he proposed the measure out of self-interest and said that he was happy with being just the proposer of the law. The senators kept delaying the vote. Cato advocated the status quo. Caesar came to the point of having him dragged out of the senate house and arrested. Cato said that he was up for this and many senators followed suit and left. Caesar adjourned the session of the senate and decided that since the senate was not willing to pass a preliminary decree he would get the plebeian council to vote. He did not convene the senate for the rest of his consulship and proposed motions directly to the plebeian council. Cassius Dio thought Caesar proposed the bill as a favour to Pompey and Crassus.|$|R
40|$|Six {{agricultural}} landscapes in Poland (PL), the Netherlands (NL), France (FR), Italy (IT), Scotland (UK) and Denmark (DK) were studied, and {{a common}} method was developed for undertaking farm inventories and the derivation of farm nitrogen (N) balances and N surplus from the in total 222 farms and 11 440 ha of farmland. In all landscapes, a large variation in the farm N surplus was found, and thereby a large potential for reductions. The highest average N surpluses {{were found in the}} most livestock-intensive landscapes of IT, FR, and NL; on average 202 ± 28, 179 ± 63 and 178 ± 20 kg N ha − 1 yr − 1, respectively. However, all landscapes showed hotspots, especially from livestock farms, including a special UK case with <b>landless</b> large-scale poultry <b>farming.</b> So, whereas the average N surplus from the land-based UK farms dominated by extensive sheep grazing was only 31 ± 10 kg N ha − 1 yr − 1, the landscape average was similar to those of PL and DK (122 ± 20 and 146 ± 55 kg N ha − 1 yr − 1, respectively) when landless poultry were included. However, the challenge remains how to account for indirect N surpluses and emissions from such farms with a large export of manure out of the landscape. We conclude that farm N balances are a useful indicator for N losses and the potential for improving N management. Significant correlations to N surplus were found, both with ammonia air concentrations and nitrate levels in soils and groundwater, measured during the landscape data collection campaign from 2007 – 2009. This indicates that farm N surpluses may be used as an independent dataset for validation of measured and modelled N emissions in agricultural landscapes. However, no significant correlation was found to N measured in surface waters, probably because of the short time horizon of the study. A case study of the development in N surplus from the landscape in DK from 1998 – 2008 showed a 22 % reduction, related to statistically significant effects (p < 0. 01) of measures targeted at reducing N emissions from livestock farms. Based on the large differences between the average and the most modern and N-efficient farms, it was concluded that N-surplus reductions of 25 – 50 % as compared to the present level were realistic in all landscapes. The implemented N-surplus method was thus effective at comparing and synthesizing results on farm N emissions and the potentials of mitigation options, and is recommended for use in combination with other methods for the assessment of landscape N emissions and farm N efficiency, including more detailed N sink and N source hotspot mapping, measurements and modelling...|$|R
