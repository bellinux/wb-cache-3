5|$|A {{recapitulation}} {{theory of}} evolutionary development was proposed by Étienne Serres in 1824–26, echoing the 1808 ideas of Johann Friedrich Meckel. They {{argued that the}} embryos of 'higher' animals went through or recapitulated a series of stages, each of which resembled an animal lower down the great chain of being. For example, the brain of a human embryo looked first <b>like</b> that of a fish, then in turn <b>like</b> that of a reptile, bird, and mammal before becoming clearly human. The embryologist Karl Ernst von Baer opposed this, arguing in 1828 {{that there was no}} linear sequence as in the great chain of being, based on a single body plan, but a process of epigenesis in which structures differentiate. Von Baer instead recognised four distinct animal body plans: radiate, <b>like</b> starfish; molluscan, <b>like</b> clams; articulate, <b>like</b> lobsters; and vertebrate, <b>like</b> fish. Zoologists then largely abandoned recapitulation, though Ernst Haeckel revived it in 1866.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was aimed to assess the effect of {{information}} about organic production on “Pecorino” cheese <b>liking.</b> Mean scores of perceived <b>liking</b> were similar for organic cheese (OC) and conventional cheese (CC). Expected <b>liking</b> scores were higher for OC than for CC (P< 0. 001). For OC the expected <b>liking</b> was significantly higher (P< 0. 001) than the perceived <b>liking</b> expressed in blind conditions (negative disconfirmation), whereas for CC the expected <b>liking</b> was significantly lower (P< 0. 001) than the perceived <b>liking</b> expressed in blind conditions (positive disconfirmation). Consumers assimilated their <b>liking</b> for OC {{in the direction of}} expectations, as the difference actual vs. perceived <b>liking</b> was significant (P< 0. 001). However, the assimilation was not complete, as the difference actual <b>liking</b> vs. expected <b>liking</b> was also significant (P< 0. 001). Consumers showed a willingness to pay OC higher than the actual commercial value of organic cheese. We conclude that the information about organic farming can be a major determinant of cheese <b>liking,</b> thus providing a potential tool for product differentiation, particularly for small scale and traditional farms...|$|R

40|$|Two {{distinct}} {{patterns of}} sweet taste <b>liking</b> have been described: one showing a peak <b>liking</b> {{response in the}} mid-range of sucrose concentrations and the other showing a monotonic <b>liking</b> response at progressively higher sucrose concentrations. Classification of these patterns has been somewhat arbitrary. In this report, we analyzed patterns of sweet taste <b>liking</b> in a pilot study with 26 adults including 14 women and 12 men, 32. 6 ± 14. 5 years of age with body mass index 26. 4 ± 5. 1 kg/m 2 (mean ± SD). Sweet taste <b>liking</b> was measured for 10 levels of sucrose solutions (0. 035 M to 1. 346 M). Participants rated their <b>liking</b> of each solution using a visual analog scale with 0 indicating strongly disliking and 100 strongly <b>liking.</b> The cluster analysis demonstrated two distinct groups: 13 <b>liked</b> relatively low sucrose concentrations and <b>liked</b> high sucrose concentrations less, and 13 <b>liked</b> high sucrose concentrations greatly. If we use the 0. 598 M sucrose solution alone and a cutoff <b>liking</b> score of 50, we can distinguish the two clusters with high sensitivity (100 %) and specificity (100 %).

40|$|Introduction: Fat, {{added sugar}} and sodium are {{important}} nutritional factors {{involved in the}} risk of obesity, although these components contribute to eating pleasure thanks to their sensory properties. Few cross-sectional studies have shown equivocal results about relationships between <b>liking</b> and weight status. The only one prospective study has shown an increase of weight in individuals who <b>liked</b> sweet taste and no significant relationships for fat <b>liking.</b> However, the tool that assesses <b>liking</b> is unreliable. Objectives: The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the prospective association between <b>liking</b> for fat, sweet and salt and the onset of obesity in adults. Method / Design: <b>Liking</b> scores were assessed using a validated questionnaire and self-reported anthropometric data were collected during 4 years in 29, 025 French adults participating in the NutriNetSanté study, a large web-based observational cohort. The influence of fat, sweet and salt <b>liking</b> on the incidence of obesity was assessed by Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for socio-demographic and economic factors, lifestyle, physical activity and energy intake. Results: In both genders, <b>liking</b> for fat was positively associated with obesity risk (HRmen= 1. 24 [1. 05, 1. 47]; HRwomen= 1. 20 [1. 10, 1. 32]), whereas sweet <b>liking</b> was inversely associated (HRmen= 0. 82 [0. 69, 0. 98]; HRwomen= 0. 88 [0. 80, 0. 98]). In contrast, no significant association with <b>liking</b> for salty taste was found. When <b>liking</b> scores were considered into quartiles, individuals with the highest fat <b>liking</b> had higher risk of obesity (men: HRQ 4 vs. Q 1 = 2. 75 [1. 40, 5. 41]; women: HRQ 4 vs. Q 1 = 2. 31 [1. 56, 3. 42]) than those with the lowest <b>liking</b> level. Regarding the highest sweet <b>liking,</b> a strong inverse relationship was also found (men: HRQ 4 vs. Q 1 = 0. 41 [0. 22, 0. 75]; women: HRQ 4 vs. Q 1 = 0. 65 [0. 45, 0. 92]) compared to those with the lowest <b>liking.</b> Conclusions: This study demonstrates that a heightened fat <b>liking</b> is an important predictor of weight status in adults, whereas a <b>liking</b> for sweet foods is inversely associated with the onset of obesity. These results suggest that sensory <b>liking</b> should be taking into account in obesity prevention...|$|R
5|$|Before the 1960s and 1970s, the {{prevailing}} interpretation of hadrosaurids <b>like</b> Edmontosaurus {{was that they}} were aquatic and fed on aquatic plants.

40|$|Food {{acceptance}} and food choice are largely driven by taste preferences and <b>liking,</b> particularly among children.

According to principal component analysis (PCA), the BMI was unrelated to either the food neophobia or the <b>liking</b> values. Food neophobia was negatively correlated with <b>liking</b> of both F&V, but <b>liking</b> of vegetables contributed more in discriminating children according to their neophobia level than fruits <b>liking.</b> This suggests that <b>liking</b> of vegetables is a better indicator of children's food neophobia than <b>liking</b> of fruits. This outcome was further confirmed as low, medium and highly neophobic children differed significantly for their vegetables <b>liking</b> but not for fruits <b>liking.</b> Food neophobia was higher in boys than in girls and decreased systematically with increasing age...|$|R

Objective: to test the IST prediction that wanting and <b>liking</b> for alcohol can be dissociated in humans. Methods: measures of wanting and <b>liking</b> for alcohol were obtained in three experiments. Experiment 1 examined whether <b>liking</b> for alcohol was associated with levels of wanting, as indexed by self-reported weekly alcohol intake. Experiments 2 and 3 also assessed the association between <b>liking</b> and wanting but in these experiments wanting was also indexed by alcohol consumption in the laboratory. Experiment 2 increased wanting for alcohol using an alcohol priming dose to determine whether <b>liking</b> would be similarly affected. Experiment 3 reduced <b>liking</b> for alcohol by adulterating drinks with Tween to see whether wanting would also be reduced. Results: little evidence for an association between <b>liking</b> and wanting for alcohol was found in Experiments 1 – 3 but, collapsing across all experiments, a weak positive correlation between <b>liking</b> and wanting was found. However, in Experiment 2, wanting was increased by the alcohol priming dose whereas <b>liking</b> was not and in Experiment 3 <b>liking</b> was reduced without a concurrent reduction in wanting. Conclusions: although correlations between wanting and <b>liking</b> can be observed these results support the contention of the IST that wanting and <b>liking</b> for alcohol can be dissociated in human participants...|$|R

Based on comparisons of bone texture of Daspletosaurus with crocodilians, a 2017 theory suggests that Tyrannosaurus and other tyrannosaurids may not have had lips at all and instead had large, flat scales that left no room for lips. The skull of Daspletosaurus also suggests that tyrannosaurids including Tyrannosaurus had integumentary sensory organs similar to crocodilians likely used in touch, temperature readings, prey detection and precise control of jaw movements.|$|E

In three experiments, participants rated the subjective likability of various visual objects (e. g. car, chair), and predicted the mean <b>liking</b> rating by other participants. Irrespective of the object's category, the correlation between individual prediction and actual mean <b>liking</b> of others (prediction validity) was not higher than the correlation between the predictor's own <b>liking</b> and the mean <b>liking</b> of others. Further, individual prediction correlated more with the predictor's own <b>liking</b> than it was with others' <b>liking.</b> Namely, predictions were biased towards the predictor's subjective <b>liking</b> (a variation of the false consensus effect).
