Furthermore, both hedge accounting and the fair value option under IAS 39 are designed to reduce mixed-measurement volatility and to improve the sensitivity of firm risk measures to earnings volatility. We also find that the relationship between credit ratings (proxy for risk) and earnings volatility increases for IFRS-adopting firms after 2005. The evidence is consistent with the argument that IAS 39 increases the credit relevance of earnings volatility...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{about the}} adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) by the Nigerian financial institutions. Nigeria have been using domestic accounting standard (NGAAP) for banks and non-banks financial institutions known as Statement of Accounting Standards (SAS 10 Part 1 and SAS 15 Part 2) issued in 1990 and 1997 respectively for financial reporting. These domestic standards were adopted from International Accounting Standards (IAS 30) but have not been updated like IAS 30 {{as reported by the}} Report on Observance of Standard Codes (ROSC) of Nigeria in 2004 and 2011. The change in accounting regulations is {{as a result of the}} weaknesses of NGAAP and low disclosure requirements. IFRS reporting has more disclosures than NGAAP especially for financial institutions. Under NGAAP financial instruments have not been classified as in IFRS. For instance, financial instruments have been classified into four under IAS 39 as; (i) recognised fair value on gain or loss in profit or loss, (ii) are measured at amortised cost for investments held-to-maturity, (iii) measured at amortised cost for <b>loans</b> <b>and</b> <b>receivables,</b> (iv) measured at fair value gain or loss for available-for-sale financial assets recognised in other comprehensive income.

30|$|Noticing {{the lack}} of credit {{services}} in China, in early 2013, the People’s Bank of China released the “Credit Industry Management Regulations” and allowed private credit service providers begin operating. Since then, over 70 private credit services were established, such as ZhiMa credit (Alibaba), Tencent credit, ZhongChengXin credit, and PengYuan credit. These companies can be classified into two types. The first type is established by e-commerce companies, represented by ZhiMa credit established by Alibaba (and 100 Credit to be discussed in this paper). ZhiMa credit integrates data {{of hundreds of thousands}} of Taobao sellers’ reputations and transactional activities on Taobao, Tmall, and Alipay platforms.

The impact of financial innovation on the economy is diversified and no single variable can be considered as an appropriate indicator for measuring its significance in the economy. We selected 2 Proxy indicators to measure financial innovation. The first proxy for financial innovation is the Domestic Credit to the Private Sector (DCB), which refers to the ratio of the number of credit facilities to the private sector for investment in the form of securities, <b>loan,</b> <b>and</b> other accounts <b>receivable.</b> Growth economic theory predicts that capital adequacy will positively influence economic growth, and so we assigned this variable a positive sign for its coefficient.

40|$|The {{objective}} of financial reporting {{is to provide}} financial information that is useful to existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors (IASB’s Conceptual Framework ED/ 2015 / 3). General purpose financial reports provide information about the financial position of a reporting entity, {{as well as information}} about the effects of transactions and other events that will change a reporting entity’s economic resources and claims (para 1. 12 ED/ 2015 / 3). Investor confidence and trust in the financial statements is a crucial component for financial markets to function smoothly. This report presents the attitudes and concerns of over 700 respondents toward fair value accounting. The survey shows there is a high level of trust toward financial statements, with higher levels of trust shown in financial statements prepared using a hybrid measurement model of historical cost and fair value accounting vis-à-vis a single measurement basis model (either historical cost or fair value accounting). More than 75 % of the survey respondents perceive fair value accounting to provide useful information for trading securities, available-for-sale securities and real estate; but less than 60 % of the respondents perceive fair value accounting to provide useful information for held-to-maturity securities, <b>loans</b> <b>and</b> <b>receivables,</b> property, plant and equipment, biological assets and intangible assets. However, there are lingering concerns toward the reliability of fair value measurements. Specifically, 26 % of respondents state that they distrust fair value estimates.

40|$|Insurance {{companies}} offer business and individuals {{the possibility to}} reduce the financial impact of a risk occurring by transferring it away from themselves onto someone. For taking on risk on behalf of someone else the insurance company requires a premium from the policyholder which is pooled and invested {{in order to meet}} future obligations towards the policyholder. However, the importance of the European insurance industry goes beyond economic protection of the policyholder as the industry with its EUR 8. 4 trillion or 58 percent of EU GDP in assets is the largest institutional investor in Europe. As the financial system has undergone dramatic transformation over time, so have the role and function of intermediaries changed. While traditional tasks like reducing transaction costs and asymmetric information became less relevant, facilitating of risk transfer and dealing with the increasing breadth and depth of financial markets are gaining more and more importance. While insurers have been able to hold illiquid asset to a larger extent arguments from the industry are made that the planned introduction of Solvency II will limit insurers and overlook their investment abilities, which is something that can affect the region’s economic development. The above mention aspect combined with the limited research that has been conducted on insurers’ asset allocation and the performance of it resulted in the following research question: Does asset allocation impact insurance company's performance? The question focuses on insurers within the European Union (EU) which is enlarged by the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland, where performance is measured as the return on investment (ROI). To answer the research question in the best possible way, relevant theories such as Modern Portfolio Theory or Efficient Market Hypothesis are presented and discussed as well as previous research on asset allocation. Earlier studies about asset allocation policy and its power to explain the investment return came to different conclusions which can be due to variation in the interpretation of the findings or difficulties by distinguishing between asset allocation policy and active asset allocation. Census is used to investigate in the topic as the population of listed insurance companies within the selected region was rather small which finally came down to 42 firms due to the timeframe of 11 years. Data regarding insurer’s asset class weights in debt securities, equity, real estate, derivatives, cash and equivalent, <b>loans</b> <b>and</b> <b>receivables</b> and the category of others were collected. The return on investment was also collected for each year of the time period and for each insurance company. Benchmarks were constructed in order to replicate what the return of a passive investment of the same proportion would have yielded. The result was inconclusive as {{it was not possible to}} determine if asset allocation policy or active management have the greatest impact on the return on investment.

Mutual funds and securities companies have recorded assets and some liabilities at fair value for decades in accordance with securities regulations and other accounting guidance. For commercial banks {{and other types of}} financial services companies, some asset classes are required to be recorded at fair value, such as derivatives and marketable equity securities. For other types of assets, such as <b>loan</b> <b>receivables</b> <b>and</b> debt securities, it depends on whether the assets are held for trading (active buying and selling) or for investment.
