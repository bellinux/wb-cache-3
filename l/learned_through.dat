5|$|Nonviolent Communication {{is based}} on the idea that all human beings have the {{capacity}} for compassion and only resort to violence or behavior that harms others when they do not recognize more effective strategies for meeting needs. Habits of thinking and speaking that lead to the use of violence (psychological and physical) are <b>learned</b> <b>through</b> culture. NVC theory supposes all human behavior stems from attempts to meet universal human needs and that these needs are never in conflict. Rather, conflict arises when strategies for meeting needs clash. NVC proposes that if people can identify their needs, the needs of others, and the feelings that surround these needs, harmony can be achieved.|$|E

5|$|Theories {{about the}} origin of {{language}} differ in regard to their basic assumptions about what language is. Some theories are {{based on the idea that}} language is so complex that one cannot imagine it simply appearing from nothing in its final form, but that it must have evolved from earlier pre-linguistic systems among our pre-human ancestors. These theories can be called continuity-based theories. The opposite viewpoint is that language is such a unique human trait that it cannot be compared to anything found among non-humans and that it must therefore have appeared suddenly in the transition from pre-hominids to early man. These theories can be defined as discontinuity-based. Similarly, theories based on Chomsky's generative view of language see language mostly as an innate faculty that is largely genetically encoded, whereas functionalist theories see it as a system that is largely cultural, <b>learned</b> <b>through</b> social interaction.|$|E
5|$|Battles use a turn-based battle system, {{with the}} player, enemies, and {{sometimes}} non-playable characters each taking turns and moving across a grid-based battlefield: battles are {{won by the}} player defeating all enemies in a map or killing a boss character. Enemies include human troops and monsters. The players are given {{a limited number of}} units, which are each assigned unique character classes that have various functions in battle, such as being mounted or having access to magic. A unit's class also affects their range of movement on the battlefield. In contrast to the previous game, character classes are not set but can switch once a character reaches a certain level. A special example of class promotion is the two main characters: Alm can promote from a Fighter to a Hero, while Celica promotes from a Priestess to a Princess. Each time a unit raises its experience level, its various stats increase based on a percent chance unique for each character. Spells for magical classes are <b>learned</b> <b>through</b> leveling up rather than being part of a separate system, and each spell consumes part of the caster's health when used.|$|E

40|$|<b>Learning</b> <b>through</b> play is a {{universal}} concept that has been studied and applied since the 1800 ’s. Various theorists, scholars and authors have provided information and research on why <b>learning</b> <b>through</b> play {{is the best way}} for young children to learn. In South Africa there is a dilemma on implementing <b>learning</b> <b>through</b> play due to various influences and contributing factors. That is why this study gained insight into how preschool teachers understand and implement <b>learning</b> <b>through</b> play. The conceptual framework of this study used different lenses of looking at <b>learning</b> <b>through</b> play. These lenses were established by reviewing the relevant literature. The conceptual framework was then used to structure questions and methods for use during the collection of the data. The data was summarised, organised and eventually analysed. This study applied a qualitative case study design to investigate five preschool teachers’ experiences, ideas and conceptions of <b>learning</b> <b>through</b> play. Data was collected from these preschool teachers through semi-structured interviews, documents (photovoices and lesson plans) and journal keeping (field notes). The data analyses and findings support the themes and subthemes that emerged. The findings suggest that preschool teachers are in favour of <b>learning</b> <b>through</b> play, but due to various influences and factors it is not always implemented successfully.

40|$|Reflection {{is widely}} posited as a {{professional}} practice and process that supports students to <b>learn</b> <b>through</b> experience. Effective reflection for <b>learning</b> <b>through</b> experience requires {{a high level of}} introspection and open-minded self-analysis, a capacity for abstract learning, and self-regulation and agency that few students in higher education innately possess. Reflection can, however, be learnt and taught through strategic interventions and careful scaffolding. This paper outlines a new framework for scaffolding reflection for <b>learning</b> <b>through</b> experience. The framework was developed by the authors as a scaffolding aid to develop teachers' ability to effectively incorporate reflection into experience-based learning curriculum in higher education. The authors contend that scaffolding reflection during each of four learning phases will positively contribute to <b>learning</b> <b>through</b> experience. 13 page(s...|$|R

The objectives {{of the study was to}} study the overall favorable attitude of B. Ed. students towards <b>learning</b> <b>through</b> ICT, to study relationship between the attitudes of B. Ed. students towards ICT and their learning style, to study the difference in the attitude of male and female B. Ed, post graduate and graduate B. Ed. students towards <b>learning</b> <b>through</b> ICT. In the present study 100 students were selected of B. Ed. class to collect the data which includes 50 male and 50 female B. Ed. students. The data was collected from the Lovely institute of Education, Phagwara. Stratified simple random sampling technique was applied to collect data of present study. Two tools were used, to access the attitude of B. Ed. students towards <b>learning</b> <b>through</b> ICT. Attitude of teachers towards web-based learning self made scale was used. To access the learning style of B. Ed. students Styles of Learning and Thinking (SOLAT) by Venket Raman (1994) was used. Statistical technique quartile deviation used to see the attitude B. Ed. students towards <b>learning</b> <b>through</b> ICT. t-test was used to see the difference between the attitude of male and female B.

Statistical technique ANOVA was used to see the relationship between the attitude of B. Ed. students towards <b>learning</b> <b>through</b> ICT and their learning style. On the basis of the interpretation of the data conclusion have been drawn, The conclusions were there exists neither favorable nor unfavorable attitude of B.

Animals use these SSDR to continue living, to help increase their chance of fitness, by surviving long enough to procreate. Humans and animals alike have created fear to know what should be avoided, and this fear can be <b>learned</b> <b>through</b> association with others in the community, or <b>learned</b> <b>through</b> personal experience with a creature, species, or situations that should be avoided.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an account of}} the inter-psychological processes that constitute <b>learning</b> <b>through</b> work. It does this by drawing on deliberations about the relative contributions of the immediate social world (i. e., workplace setting) that individuals encounter and the personal premises for individuals' learning. This account is realised through analyses of workers' experiences of working and learning in both large and small enterprises. Together, these premises and their contributions are used to elaborate how <b>learning</b> <b>through</b> work proceeds as a process of relational interdependence between the affordance of the workplace and the engagement of workers. This relational process is evident in work of different kinds, from the labours of coalminers through to the entrepreneurial activities of small business operators. Instances of <b>learning</b> <b>through</b> work are elaborated through studies that identify how workplaces' affordances-those that invite workers in particular ways to participate, access support and reward-are generated and projected. These contributions to engaging in and <b>learning</b> <b>through</b> work can be conceptualised as the immediate social contribution or experience that is shaped by cultural and situational factors and the social legacies that shape how individuals construe, engage in, and <b>learn</b> <b>through</b> those practices. It concludes by discussing issues related to both the inter-psychological process and outcomes (e. g., inter-subjectivity) arising from <b>learning</b> <b>through</b> work.
