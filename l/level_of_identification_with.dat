40|$|The present {{research}} investigated {{the role of}} perceived similarity in cultural values (associated with diversity in cultural backgrounds) and an intercultural group climate in predicting <b>identification</b> <b>with</b> both the organization and the work team. The relevance of perceived similarity in cultural values for identification was shown in a questionnaire study among 124 employees from various organizations (Study 1). Study 2 among 75 employees from a diverse organization showed that perceived similarity in cultural values is positively related to <b>identification</b> <b>with</b> workgroups. In this vein, cultural diversity can hinder identification. Therefore, we focused on an intercultural group climate, in which cultural diversity is perceived as positive, as an alternative way to ensure employees' identification in diverse work groups. Results confirmed that employees report high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> <b>with</b> both the organization and the work team, when the intercultural group climate is strong. In addition, when an intercultural group climate is strong, employees still report high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> <b>with</b> the organization despite low perceived similarity in cultural values.

5000|$|The idea of {{including}} {{the other in}} the self has been extended to include an entire ingroup in the self. An ingroup is an interdependent set of individuals with which a person identifies. The individual believes he or {{she is a member of}} this group. [...] In fact, several academic groups have found similar findings in the me/not me reaction time paradigm at a group level. [...] Participants showed a slower reaction time for traits that were incongruent between the self and ingroup. This was in comparison to quicker reaction times for traits that were congruent between the self and ingroup. The slow reaction times were consistent with the inclusion of the ingroup in the self claim as it suggested that the individual had included group characteristics in the self. As a result, there was difficulty recalling if a trait belong to the self or ingroup. Several researchers have examined the role of ingroup identification (i.e. a person's prolonged psychological connection to an ingroup) and self-expansion. In fact, Trop and Wright refined the meaning of ingroup identification and believed it was analogous to the inclusion of the ingroup in the self. The authors found that the degree of connectedness to the ingroup will affect confusion of self-descriptors. People who highly identified with an ingroup showed slower reaction times for self-descriptors that did not relate to the ingroup (this is consistent with previous findings). However, low ingroup identification lead to no differences in reaction times between whether or not the self-descriptors were also descriptive of the ingroup. This demonstrated that the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> <b>with</b> an ingroup can be conceptualized as the degree to which we will include the ingroup in the self.|$|E

Despite the fact that women, on average, currently achieve {{a higher level of}} education than men, women's marketplace status and their height of salary often do not correspond to it. One of the reasons is a low proportion of women in mathematics-related subjects.

40|$|It {{is argued}} that the entitativity of the ingroup moderates the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>{{identification}}</b> <b>with</b> the ingroup. Specifically, that high levels of entitativity are conducive to strong identification, whereas low levels of entitativity reduce identification with the ingroup. These hypotheses were tested across four studies using the European Union (EU) as the reference group. The four studies manipulated four different factors that, according to Campbell (1958), impact on group entitativity: common fate (Study 1), similarity (Study 2), salience (Study 3), and boundedness (Study 4). Across the four studies, we found evidence {{for the impact of}} these factors on the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> <b>with</b> the EU among European citizens holding moderate attitudes toward the EU but not (or much less) for citizens holding more extreme attitudes towards the EU. Mediational analyses further confirmed the viability of an entitativity-based interpretation {{of the impact of the}} manipulations on the level of identification.

The purpose of the present investigation was to provide additional evidence regarding the influence poor competitive seasons have on the malleability of athletes’ self-identity. Athletes were followed throughout the course of their season to determine whether athletes who encountered a poor competitive season reported lowered <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> athletic identity. Specifically, male and female NCAA Division I track and field athletes completed pre-indoor, post-indoor, and post-outdoor assessments of athletic identity.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} phenomenon of student mobility, supported and made more feasible in Europe with the Bologna process, new expectations have been created. One of them follows a much discussed {{term in the}} sense of a higher awareness and attraction towards the so called European Identity. This topic plays an important role at the socio-cultural area of the European integration and has been a center of hard discussion both, at the political and theoretical level. It is at the theoretical level that statements including students, especially those who have had the opportunity to interact with other Europeans and realized of their commonalities are appointed to more likely identify with this identity.

It is believed that part of this risk is due to pressure from peer passengers to engage in speeding; which may be active (i. e., verbal encouragement) or passive (i. e., perceived pressure {{on the part of}} the driver). The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) was used to investigate this impact of peer passengers on young drivers, particularly the influence of the type of peer pressure and a driver’s <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> <b>with</b> their passengers. A scenario-based questionnaire was constructed, informed by focus groups and pilot studies, and distributed to university students (N = 398). The questionnaire measured participants’ intentions and the TPB constructs, including two components of perceived behaviour control, within a baseline scenario as well as an experimental scenario in which the variables of type of pressure and identification were manipulated. Consistent with the hypotheses, the study found that attitudes and self-efficacy significantly predicted intentions over and above the variance explained by the sociodemographic variables of age, gender, self-esteem, sensation seeking, as well as past behaviour and exposure. Across the scenarios, attitudes explained between 4. 3 % and 14. 5 %, while self-efficacy to refrain from speeding explained between 4. 9 % and 17. 1 %, of the unique variance in intentions to speed. However, contrary to expectations, intentions to speed were found to be higher in the “no passenger” than “passenger present” conditions, although this finding is not completely inconsistent with recent literature.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} three empirical {{chapters on}} local labour markets, mineral booms, beliefs, conflict and uncertainty. All the {{analysis was conducted}} using Peruvian data and context. The first chapter finds that Peruvian individuals exposed to violent events during their impressionable years trust less government institutions, and feel less identified with their neighbours, while more identified with religious groups. The estimated effect is small and heterogeneous depending on {{the identity of the}} perpetrator. The effect on <b>identification</b> <b>with</b> groups <b>of</b> population is also heterogeneous by the indigenous origin of the individuals. Owners of an agricultural plot embedded in a cooperative setting at the local level exhibit even smaller <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> <b>with</b> their locals while higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> <b>with</b> their ethnic group. In line with recent literature, these findings suggest that conflict has a small but persistent effect on the formation of trust and identity, which is a central feature to understand the interaction between culture and institutions, and ultimately to understand the persistent consequences of wars. The second chapter studies the relationship between democratic beliefs and economic uncertainty. I explored whether uncertainty experienced during the impressionable years of the individuals is a key factor behind the formation of the democratic beliefs. Results showed that this type of uncertainty had no effect on the determination of democratic beliefs. Combining uncertainty with the exposure to authoritarian regimes did not change the result. This result is robust to different definition of rural individuals, the interaction of uncertainty and degree of experienced authoritarianism, and different formative periods. Current uncertainty, on the other hand, was unable to fully explain the formation of democratic beliefs. The final chapter investigated the local labour effects of mining booms. Using two rounds of population census for 1043 districts in Peru I documented that large-scale mining activity had a positive effect on local employment over 14 years. The effect was differentiated by industry, skill and migration status. Employment grew by 4...|$|R
