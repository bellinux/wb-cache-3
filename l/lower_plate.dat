A glass vessel a (fig. 127.)[A] was {{ground at}} the top and bottom so as to be closed by two ground brass plates, b and c; b carried a stuffing-box, with a sliding rod d {{terminated}} by a brass ball s below, and a ring above.

The metallic parts of this apparatus were not varnished, but the glass was well-covered with a coat of shell-lac previously dissolved in alcohol. On exhausting the vessel at the air-pump it could be filled with any other gas than air, and, in such cases, the gas so passed in was dried whilst entering by fused chloride of calcium.|$|E

50|$|The {{theodolite}} is {{an instrument}} for the measurement of angles. It uses two separate circles, protractors or alidades to measure angles in the horizontal and the vertical plane. A telescope mounted on trunnions is aligned vertically with the target object. The whole upper section rotates for horizontal alignment. The vertical circle measures the angle that the telescope makes against the vertical, known as the zenith angle. The horizontal circle uses an upper and <b>lower</b> <b>plate.</b> When beginning the survey, the surveyor points the instrument in a known direction (bearing), and clamps the <b>lower</b> <b>plate</b> in place. The instrument can then rotate to measure the bearing to other objects. If no bearing is known or direct angle measurement is wanted, the instrument can be set to zero during the initial sight. It will then read the angle between the initial object, the theodolite itself, and the item that the telescope aligns with.|$|E
