40|$|Background: In this study, {{a method}} for <b>linear</b> <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficient</b> {{calculation}} was introduced. Methods: <b>Linear</b> <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficient</b> was calculated with a new method that base on the physics of interaction of photon with matter, mathematical calculation and x-ray spectrum consideration. The calculation was done for Cerrobend as a common radiotherapy modifier and Mercury. Results: The values of calculated <b>linear</b> <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficient</b> with this new method are in acceptable range. Also, the <b>linear</b> <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficient</b> decreases slightly as the thickness of attenuating filter (Cerrobend or mercury) increased, so the procedure of <b>linear</b> <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficient</b> variation is in agreement with other documents.

In contrast to the more conventional medical computerized tomography (CT) systems, a microfocal X-ray source is used. This enables a far better spatial resolution. The <b>linear</b> <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficient</b> or tomodensity is dependent on the physical density and the mineralogy of the object to be imaged, and on the energy of the radiation used. Earlier work by Verhelst et al. (Verhelst, F., David, P., Ferment, W. J. J., Jegers, L., Vervoort, A., 1996. Correlation of 3 D-computerized tomographic scans and 2 D-color image analysis of Westphalian coal by means of multivariate statistics. Int. J. Coal Geol. 29, 1 - 21) presented the results of the correlation of the tomodensities obtained from three-dimensional CT scans with two-dimensional data on the composition of a coal sample acquired with color image analysis (CIA), a camera technique. This analysis assumed the linear proportionality of the tomodensity with the real physical bulk density, which is true only for certain energy ranges. In this paper, we use CMT devices for a similar correlation. For sake of comparison, the same core sample was used. First, new CIA data on the surface composition along two profiles were sampled with greater detail (100 mu m). These data are subjected to a geostatistical analysis to quantify the spatial dependence between the measurements. Second, CMT tomograms were made, yielding spatial resolutions twice as high as medical CT. A multivariate correlation was carried out, and two improved (geo) statistical methods are suggested. The different energy range of the microfocal X-ray source compared to medical CT, however, produces some bias in the correlation of the tomodensities with the surface percentages of the constituents. We therefore suggest that the <b>linear</b> <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficient</b> be treated as a separate unit.

40|$|Objective: The CT {{portion of}} PET/CT {{provides}} attenuation correction of the PET emission scan. This study {{was performed to}} evaluate how much the CT tube current can be lowered while still providing attenuation maps on PET images. Methods: Two body phantoms (outside diameters of 300 and 500 mm) were used to investigate, and PET/CT acquisitions were performed with an Aquiduo PCA- 7000 B (Toshiba Medical Systems, Otawara, Japan). The CT scan was performed with the following parameters (120 kVp; 0. 5 -s rotation; 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 200, 320, 460 mA). After the CT scan, PET images for 18 F-FDG (5. 3 kBq/mL) were obtained for 4 min/bed position. The <b>linear</b> <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> for 18 F-FDG in 300 - and 500 -mm phantoms, pixel values and SD of CT images, radioactivity concentration values and hot- and cold-sphere contrast on PET images in the 500 -mm phantom were evaluated. Results: In the 300 -mm phantom, all eight tube currents gave average <b>linear</b> <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> of approximately 0. 095 cm - 1. In contrast, the average <b>linear</b> <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> of the 500 -mm phantom at 10, 20, and 40 mA were significantly decreased (0. 081, 0. 087, and 0. 092 cm - 1, respectively; p < 0. 05) as compared to 0. 096 cm - 1 of the other tube currents. Further, CT pixel values decreased 10 and 20 mA. Thus, the background radioactivity concentration values at 10 and 20 mA were substantially underestimated to be 57 and 80 %, respectively (p < 0. 05); the hot-sphere contrast values at 10 and 20 mA were 0. 26 and 0. 29; the cold-sphere contrast values at 10, 20, and 40 mA were - 0. 33, - 0. 16, and 0. 08. Conclusions: Although the <b>linear</b> <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> in the 300 -mm phantom remained the same with varying CT tube currents, the 500 -mm phantom yielded {{significant differences in the}} range 10 - 40 mA.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} the x-ray photon energy {{dependence of the}} anatomic power spectrum of the breast when imaged with dedicated breast computed tomography (CT). METHODS: A theoretical framework for scaling the empirically determined anatomic power spectrum at one x-ray photon energy to that at any given x-ray photon energy when imaged with dedicated breast CT was developed. Theory predicted that when the anatomic power spectrum is fitted with a power curve of the form k f(-beta), where k and beta are fit coefficients and f is spatial frequency, the exponent beta would be independent of x-ray photon energy (E), and the amplitude k scales with {{the square of the}} difference in energy-dependent <b>linear</b> <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> of fibroglandular and adipose tissues. Twenty mastectomy specimens based numerical phantoms that were previously imaged with a benchtop flat-panel cone-beam CT system were converted to 3 D distribution of glandular weight fraction (f(g)) and were used to verify the theoretical findings. The 3 D power spectrum was computed in terms of f(g) and after converting to <b>linear</b> <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> at monoenergetic x-ray photon energies of 20 - 80 keV in 5 keV intervals. The 1 D power spectra along the axes were extracted and fitted with a power curve of the form k f(-beta). The energy dependence of k and beta were analyzed. RESULTS: For the 20 mastectomy specimen based numerical phantoms used in the study, the exponent beta was found to be in the range of 2. 34 - 2. 42, depending on the axis of measurement. Numerical simulations agreed with the theoretical predictions that for a power-law anatomic spectrum of the form k f(-beta), beta was independent of E and k(E) = k(1) [mu(g) (E) - mu(a) (E) ](2), where k(1) is a constant, and mu(g) (E) and mu(a) (E) represent the energy-dependent <b>linear</b> <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> of fibroglandular and adipose tissues, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Numerical simulations confirmed the theoretical predictions that in dedicated breast CT, the spatial frequency dependence of the anatomic power spectrum will be independent of x-ray photon energy, and the amplitude of the anatomic power spectrum scales by the square of difference in <b>linear</b> <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> of fibroglandular and adipose tissues...|$|R
