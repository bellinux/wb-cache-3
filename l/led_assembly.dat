The criticism intensified when Minister of Education Meas Saem closed the Lycee Sisowath in response to the protests. Sambaur's government fell in September 1949. The Democratic Party again took the reins with Ieu Koeus as Prime Minister. His administration lasted nine days until the King, tired of ministerial instability, took advantage of ambiguous wording in the Democratic Party drafted constitution and stepped in. Asserting his newly claimed powers, the King dissolved the National Assembly, postponed elections and formed a new government without an Assembly and named Sambour Prime Minister again. As an ally of Sihanouk, he continued to support efforts by Shihanouk to gain concessions from the French and move towards independence. Sambaur resigned in April 1950 and Sihanouk himself became Prime Minister.|$|E

30|$|This {{behaviour}} reverses in {{case that}} the reflectivity of the substrate surface is reduced to values lower than 85 %. In this case, the overall CIE x values decrease for all the different globe-top radii since a comparably larger amount of the (mainly yellow) backscattered light is absorbed by the substrate surface. Therefore, again, the hemispherical globe-top with the smallest radius shows the lowest decrease of the CIE x values and the lowest deviation from the initial value. In practice, it is most likely that the reflectivity of the substrate surface decreases (and not increases) during the lifetime of the <b>LED</b> <b>assembly</b> because of materials degradation. One can therefore conclude that a smaller globe-top size has some advantages in regard of long-term maintenance of a given colour temperature.|$|E
40|$|A {{multichannel}} Light Monitoring System (LMS) {{based on}} super-bright blue LED, {{has been developed}} for the high resolution electromagnetic hybrid calorimeter (HY-CAL) at Jefferson Lab. The {{central part of the}} calorimeter consists of 1200 PbWO 4 crystal modules. The prototype LMS has been constructed and tested, and has demonstrated a capability of providing an adequate light pulse per each channel, equivalent to the signal of 5 GeV electrons in the detector. The final Light Monitoring System with 1800 output channels and fiber optics light distribution system is presently under construction. The light source of the LMS represents an assembly of 31 super bright blue LEDs connected in series. The uniformity of the output light is achieved by mixing light from the <b>LED</b> <b>assembly</b> in an integrating sphere. The light intensity is being monitored using PIN photo diode and reference photomultipliers with Am 241 radioactive source.

30|$|For a {{systematic}} approach {{to improve the}} white light quality of phosphor converted light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for general lighting applications {{it is imperative to}} get the individual sources of error for correlated colour temperature (CCT) reproducibility and maintenance under control. In this regard, it is of essential importance to understand how geometrical, optical and thermal properties of the colour conversion elements (CCEs), which typically consist of phosphor particles embedded in a transparent matrix material, affect the constancy of a desired CCT value. In this contribution we use an <b>LED</b> <b>assembly</b> consisting of an LED die mounted on a printed circuit board by chip-on-board technology and a CCE with a globe-top configuration on the top of it as a model system and discuss the impact of the CCE size, the substrate reflectivity as well as the thermal load of the CCEs on CCT maintenance and the respective radiant fluxes. It turns out that optimized solutions for CCT maintenance and high radiant fluxes in regard of one of the relevant influence factors {{do not need to be}} optimized solutions in regard of another one.|$|E
40|$|A {{particle}} fallout/activity sensor measures relative {{amounts of}} dust or other particles which collect on a mirror {{in an area}} to be monitored. The sensor includes a sensor module and a data acquisition module, both {{of which can be}} operated independently of one another or in combination with one another. The sensor module includes a housing containing the mirror, an <b>LED</b> <b>assembly</b> for illuminating the mirror and an optical detector assembly for detecting light scattered off of the mirror by dust or other particles collected thereon. A microprocessor controls operation of the sensor module's components and displays results of a measurement on an LCD display mounted on the housing. A push button switch is also mounted on the housing which permits manual initiation of a measurement. The housing is constructed of light absorbing material, such as black delrin, which minimizes detection of light by the optical detector assembly other than that scattered by dust or particles on the mirror. The data acquisition module can be connected to the sensor module and includes its own microprocessor, a timekeeper and other digital circuitry for causing the sensor module to make a measurement periodically and send the measurement data to the data acquisition module for display and storage in memory for later retrieval and transfer to a separate computer. The time tagged measurement data {{can also be used to}} determine the relative level of activity in the monitored area since this level is directly related to the amount of dust or particle fallout in the area...|$|E
40|$|Paper is an {{excellent}} candidate to replace plastics as a substrate for flexible electronics due to its low cost, renewability and flexibility. Cellulose nanopaper (CNP), {{a new type of}} paper made of nanosized cellulose fibers, is a promising substrate material for transparent and flexible electrodes due to its potentially high transparency and high mechanical strength. Although CNP substrates can achieve high transparency, they are still characterized by high diffuse transmittance and small direct transmittance, resulting in high optical haze of the substrates. In this study, we proposed a simple methodology for large-scale production of high-transparency, low-haze CNP comprising both long cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) and short cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs). By varying the CNC/CNF ratio in the hybrid CNP, we could tailor its total transmittance, direct transmittance and diffuse transmittance. By increasing the CNC content, the optical haze of the hybrid CNP could be decreased and its transparency could be increased. The direct transmittance and optical haze of the CNP were 75. 1 % and 10. 0 %, respectively, greatly improved from the values of previously reported CNP (31. 1 % and 62. 0 %, respectively). Transparent, flexible electrodes were fabricated by coating the hybrid CNP with silver nanowires (AgNWs). The electrodes showed a low sheet resistance (minimum 1. 2 Ω sq- 1) and a high total transmittance (maximum of 82. 5 %). The electrodes were used to make a light emitting diode (<b>LED)</b> <b>assembly</b> to demonstrate their potential use in flexible displays. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry...|$|E

The thermal conductivity of the BN-filled substrate was measured. The temperature distribution and heat flow of the LED package were assessed by thermal profile measurement using an infrared (IR) camera and thermocouples. In addition, the heat transfer process of the <b>LED</b> package <b>assembly</b> in natural convection was also simulated using the computational fluid dynamics method. The optical performance of the LED package was monitored and investigated with various filler contents. The heat conduction mechanismin the substrate was analyzed. IR thermogram showed that the BN-doped substrate could effectively lower the surface temperature of the LED package by 21. 5 °C compared with the traditional FR 4 substrate. According to the IESNA LM 80 lifetime testing method, reduction in LED temperature can prolong the LED's lifetime by 19, 000 h. The optical performance of the <b>LED</b> package <b>assembly</b> was also found to be improved significantly in lighting power by 10 %. As a result, the overall heat dissipation capability of the LED package to the surrounding is enhanced, which improves the LED's efficacy. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R
