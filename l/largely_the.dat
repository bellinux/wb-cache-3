5|$|A {{week before}} her death, Mary {{went through her}} papers, weeding out some which were burnt, but her journal survives, as do her letters to William and to Frances Apsley. The Jacobites lambasted her, but the {{assessment}} of her character that came down to posterity was <b>largely</b> <b>the</b> vision of Mary as a dutiful, submissive wife, who assumed power reluctantly, exercised it with considerable ability when necessary, and willingly deferred it to her husband.|$|E
5|$|Anarky has {{undergone}} several shifts in his characterization {{over the course}} of the character's existence. These were largely decided upon by Alan Grant, who between the creation of Anarky to the end of the 1999 Anarky series, was <b>largely</b> <b>the</b> sole author of the character. After the departure of Grant and Breyfogle from DC Comics, Anarky's characterization fell to various authors who utilized him thereafter.|$|E

5|$|England were <b>largely</b> <b>the</b> {{better team}} and, {{if not for}} the {{resilient}} batting of Chanderpaul, they would have won by an even larger margin. The West Indies suffered greatly from his absence in the second Test, losing the match by an innings and 283 runs, their biggest defeat in Test history. England retained the Wisden trophy at Old Trafford by taking an unbeatable 2–0 lead, They ultimately won the series 3–0.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, an enquiry {{investigated}} the Fremantle Prison riot that {{occurred at the}} start of the year. The report suggested that little evidence supported the escape plan theory reported by the media, but that the riot was <b>largely</b> <b>the</b> result of an incident of that morning involving the mistreatment of a prisoner and his subsequent release into Three Division yard.|$|E
5|$|In Giants: Citizen Kabuto, players take on {{the roles}} of three {{humanoid}} races: gun-toting Meccaryns, magic-wielding Sea Reapers, and the gigantic Kabuto. Each player is assigned direct control of a single character. The game's developers, Planet Moon Studios, created this design to encourage players {{to focus on the}} action and not to be burdened with micromanagement. Players can customize the controls, which are <b>largely</b> <b>the</b> same for each race, with slight differences for abilities.|$|E

5|$|Like {{previous}} Pokémon games, Diamond and Pearl chronicle {{the adventures}} of a young Pokémon trainer as he/she trains and battles Pokémon while also thwarting the schemes of a criminal organization. The games add many new features, such as Internet play over the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and changes to battle mechanics and Pokémon Contests, along with addition of 107 new Pokémon. The games are independent of each other but feature <b>largely</b> <b>the</b> same plot and while both can be played separately, {{it is necessary to}} trade between them in order to complete the games' Pokédexes.|$|E
5|$|Murder on the Orient Express was {{announced}} in May 2006, as the second installment in The Adventure Company's Agatha Christie series. As with the game's predecessor, And Then There Were None, Murder on the Orient Express was developed by AWE Productions, in collaboration with producer The Adventure Company. The production team remained <b>largely</b> <b>the</b> same, with Lee Sheldon reprising his role as Lead Designer, and Scott Nixon from AWE Productions reprising his position as Managing Director.|$|E
5|$|Television in Scotland is <b>largely</b> <b>the</b> same as UK-wide broadcasts, {{however the}} {{national}} broadcaster is BBC Scotland, a constituent {{part of the}} British Broadcasting Corporation, the publicly funded broadcaster of the United Kingdom. It runs three national television stations, and the national radio stations, BBC Radio Scotland and BBC Radio nan Gaidheal, amongst others. Scotland also has some programming in the Gaelic language. BBC Alba is the national Gaelic-language channel. The main Scottish commercial television station is STV.|$|E

5|$|The Kingdom of the Picts {{as it was}} in {{the early}} 8th century, when Bede was writing, was <b>largely</b> <b>the</b> same as the kingdom of the Scots in the reign of Alexander I (1107–1124). However, by the tenth century, the Pictish kingdom was {{dominated}} by what we can recognise as Gaelic culture, and had developed a traditional story of an Irish conquest around the ancestor of the contemporary royal dynasty, Cináed mac Ailpín (Kenneth MacAlpin).|$|E
5|$|The castle is <b>largely</b> <b>the</b> {{creation}} of the Douglas Earls of Morton, who held Aberdour from the 14th century. The earls used Aberdour as a second home until 1642, when their primary residence, Dalkeith House, was sold. A fire in the late 17th century was followed by some repairs, but in 1725 the family purchased nearby Aberdour House, and the medieval castle was allowed to fall into decay. Today, only the 17th-century wing remains roofed, while the tower has mostly collapsed. Aberdour Castle {{is now in the}} care of Historic Scotland, and {{is open to the public}} all year.|$|E
5|$|The games {{introduce}} 100 {{new species}} of Pokémon, and follow {{the progress of the}} central character, whose name the player may choose, in his quest to master Pokémon battling. Both games are independent of each other but feature <b>largely</b> <b>the</b> same plot and, while both can be played separately, it is necessary to trade between them and their backward compatible predecessors in order to fully complete the games' Pokédexes. The Johto Saga of the Pokémon anime is based on the new region introduced in the games.|$|E

5|$|The papal {{conclave}} of 1724 {{was called}} upon {{the death of}} Pope Innocent XIII. It began on 20 March 1724 and ended on 28 May that year {{with the election of}} Vincenzo Maria Orsini, a Dominican friar, as Pope Benedict XIII. The conclave was made of <b>largely</b> <b>the</b> same electors that had elected Innocent in 1721 and the same factions dominated it. Multiple attempts were made to elect candidates that would be acceptable to the various Catholic monarchies at the time, but none were successful until May. Benedict resisted his own election for two days before being convinced to accept it.|$|E
