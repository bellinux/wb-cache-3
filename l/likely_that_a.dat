5|$|Such long-distance {{high-speed}} railways are {{not included}} in the preliminary long-term plan for 2010–2040, and it is likely that railways Hamar–Trondheim and Drammen–Kristansand will be built first since they are easier to build. It is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> high-speed railway to Bergen will be built sometime in the period 2030–2060.|$|E
5|$|Beta, Gamma, and Iota Serpentis form a {{distinctive}} triangular shape marking {{the head of}} the snake, with Kappa Serpentis being roughly midway between Gamma and Iota. The brightest of the four with an apparent magnitude of roughly 3.67, Beta Serpentis is a white main-sequence star roughly 160 parsecs distant. It is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> nearby 10th-magnitude star is physically associated with Beta, although it is not certain. The Mira variable R Serpentis, situated between Beta and Gamma, is {{visible to the naked eye}} at its maximum of 5th-magnitude, but, typical of Mira variables, it can fade to below magnitude 14. Gamma Serpentis itself is an F-type subgiant located only 11 parsecs distant and thus is quite bright, being of magnitude 3.84 ± 0.05. The star is known to show solar-like oscillations.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> small native {{settlement}} {{occupied the}} site {{before the advent}} of the Romans, possibly as the main trading station on the boundary between two British tribes, the Corieltauvi in the East Midlands whose later tribal centre was at Ratae Corieltauvorum, and the Cornovii to the west with their original capital Uriconon (which would later give its name to the important Roman British city of Viroconium) at the hill fort on The Wrekin. These tribes offered little resistance to Roman rule.|$|E

50|$|Basque is {{directly}} related to ancient Aquitanian, and it is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> early form of the Basque language was present in Western Europe before the arrival of the Indo-European languages in the area. The language may have been spoken since Paleolithic times.|$|R
5|$|The 1908 Ordnance Survey map of Gibraltar reveals Flat Bastion Magazine {{within the}} east side of the bastion. The British version of the {{magazine}} dates back to at least 1873, as documented on a keystone above one of the magazine's doorways (pictured right). It is considered <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> magazine was present at that site previously. The magazine was constructed on scree breccia, with underlying limestone bedrock. The road through the bastion is positioned just to the west of the magazine.|$|E
5|$|The tomb {{was built}} from sarsen borders that were {{arranged}} as two trilithons, and was oriented almost east to west. As with {{four of the}} other Medway Megaliths, {{it appears to have}} been oriented toward either the Medway Valley or the North Downs. The chamber was a trapezoid in its shape, measuring about 12 feet long and 7-and-a-half feet wide. The chamber was likely 10 feet in height. It is likely that the entrance to the chamber was almost entirely blocked by a large stone, designated 'G' by excavators. Although {{it is difficult to determine}} the precise original layout of the chamber as a result of damage caused by medieval robbers, it appears <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> medial stone divided the chamber in two. Furthermore, within the chamber, a drystone wall would have also blocked access.|$|E
5|$|TypeIa supernovae {{are thought}} to be {{potentially}} the most dangerous if they occur close enough to the Earth. Because these supernovae arise from dim, common white dwarf stars in binary systems, it is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> supernova that can affect the Earth will occur unpredictably and in a star system that is not well studied. The closest known candidate is IK Pegasi (see below). Recent estimates predict that a TypeII supernova would have to be closer than eight parsecs (26light-years) to destroy half of the Earth's ozone layer, and there are no such candidates closer than about 500 light years.|$|E

5000|$|Kinsham Grange {{may have}} been a priory near the River Lugg in Herefordshire, England at [...] It now seems <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> error by John Tanner in 1744 {{confused}} this site with one at Great Limber in Lincolnshire and there was never a priory here.|$|R
5|$|X-10 {{supplied}} the Los Alamos Laboratory {{with the first}} significant samples of plutonium. Studies of these by Emilio G. Segrè and his P-5 Group at Los Alamos revealed that it contained impurities {{in the form of}} the isotope plutonium-240, which has a far higher spontaneous fission rate than plutonium-239. This meant that it would be highly <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> plutonium gun-type nuclear weapon would predetonate and blow itself apart during the initial formation of a critical mass. The Los Alamos Laboratory was thus forced to turn its development efforts to creating an implosion-type nuclear weapon—a far more difficult feat.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} Medieval period, British kingship was not {{inherited}} {{in a direct}} line from previous kings, as {{would be the case}} in the late Middle Ages. There were instead a number of candidates for kingship, who usually needed {{to be a member of}} a particular dynasty and to claim descent from a particular ancestor. Kingship could be multi-layered and very fluid. The Pictish kings of Fortriu were probably acting as overlords of other Pictish kings for much of this period and occasionally were able to assert an overlordship over non-Pictish kings, but occasionally themselves had to acknowledge the overlordship of external rulers, both Anglian and British. Such relationships may have placed obligations to pay tribute or to supply armed forces. After a victory, sub-kings may have received rewards in return for this service. Interaction with and intermarriage into the ruling families of subject kingdoms may have opened the way to absorption of such sub-kingdoms and, although there might be later overturnings of these mergers, it is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> complex process by which kingship was gradually monopolised by a handful of the most powerful dynasties was taking place.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 863, Umar struck again, joining forces with the Abbasid general Ja'far ibn Dinar al-Khayyat (probably the {{governor}} of Tarsus) for a successful raid into Cappadocia. The Arabs crossed the Cilician Gates into Byzantine territory, plundering as they went, until they reached a place near Tyana. There, the Tarsian army returned home, but Umar obtained Ja'far's leave to press on into Asia Minor. Umar's forces represented {{the bulk of his}} emirate's strength, but their size is unknown: the contemporary Muslim historian Ya'qubi claims that Umar had 8,000 men at his disposal, while the Byzantine historians Genesius and Theophanes Continuatus inflate the numbers of the Arab army to 40,000 men. The Byzantinist John Haldon considers the former number to be closer to reality, and estimates the size of the combined Arab force at 15,000–20,000 men. It is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> Paulician contingent under Karbeas was present as well.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} case, the cipher {{can be broken}} using the same {{techniques}} as for a general simple substitution cipher, such as frequency analysis [...] or pattern words. While solving, it is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> attacker will quickly notice the regularity in the solution and deduce <b>that</b> <b>a</b> Caesar cipher is the specific algorithm employed.|$|R
5000|$|Nectarius of Digne (...) was {{believed}} to have been the third Bishop of Digne, the first bishop of Digne having been Saint Domnin and the second Saint Vincent. However, Pierre Gassendi considers it <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> unknown bishop succeeded Saint Vincent as predecessor to Nectarius, making Nectarius the fourth bishop of Digne.|$|R
50|$|Technical {{progress}} in railways had developed edge rails, which {{were capable of}} carrying heavier wheel loads, and it is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> edge railway had been built alongside {{the lower part of}} the Carmarthenshire alignment before 1832, by which time the now-outmoded Carmarthenshire Tramroad had fallen into disuse north of Felin Foel.|$|R
5|$|It is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> multicomponent, {{adaptive}} {{immune system}} arose with the first vertebrates, as invertebrates do not generate lymphocytes or an antibody-based humoral response. Many species, however, utilize mechanisms {{that appear to be}} precursors of these aspects of vertebrate immunity. Immune systems appear even in the structurally most simple forms of life, with bacteria using a unique defense mechanism, called the restriction modification system to protect themselves from viral pathogens, called bacteriophages. Prokaryotes also possess acquired immunity, through a system that uses CRISPR sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of phage that they have come into contact with in the past, which allows them to block virus replication through a form of RNA interference. Prokaryotes also possess other defense mechanisms. Offensive elements of the immune systems are also present in unicellular eukaryotes, but studies of their roles in defense are few.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} when Æthelberht became a Christian. It is possible, despite Bede's account, that he already was a Christian before Augustine's mission arrived. It is likely that Liudhard and Bertha pressed Æthelberht to {{consider}} becoming a Christian {{before the arrival of}} the mission, and it is also <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> condition of Æthelberht's marriage to Bertha was that Æthelberht would consider conversion. Conversion via the influence of the Frankish court would have been seen as an explicit recognition of Frankish overlordship, however, so it is possible that Æthelberht's delay of his conversion until it could be accomplished via Roman influence, might have been an assertion of independence from Frankish control. It also has been argued that Augustine's hesitation—he turned back to Rome, asking to be released from the mission—is an indication that Æthelberht was a pagan at the time Augustine was sent.|$|E
5|$|The Bigod family {{continued}} {{to build their}} grip on the region, taking advantage of their powerful castles at Thetford, Framlingham, Bungay, and Walton. Roger's son, Hugh Bigod, played a prominent role {{during the civil war}} years of the Anarchy, rebelling against King Stephen from his strongholds in East Anglia. It appears <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> stone wall had been built around the bailey around this time, and recent work has speculated that a stone keep was also erected on the site. At the end of the war, however, Henry II took the throne and attempted to restore royal power across the region. In 1157, Henry seized Bigod's castles; he ultimately returned Framlingham and Bungay, but retained Thetford Castle for his own use. Hugh Bigod then joined the revolt by Henry's sons, seizing the castle, but in 1173 Henry's forces captured the castle and destroyed the fortifications. The mound, however, proved effectively indestructable.|$|E
5000|$|Flynn himself, with co-worker William Dickens, has {{suggested}} an explanatory model which points to two-way causality between IQ and environment: a cognitively challenging environment raises an individual’s IQ, while in addition a higher individual IQ {{makes it more}} <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> individual will self-select or be sorted into more cognitively challenging environments ...|$|R

5000|$|One {{potentially}} {{negative effect}} of scalpelling {{is that the}} holes created by the process {{are less likely to}} close naturally over time than those from stretched piercings. Though it is still possible in some cases, especially at smaller sizes, it is far more <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> unwanted hole would have to be closed surgically.|$|R
5|$|The {{congregation}} {{was heavily}} involved in World WarII, with many members serving in the armed forces, including Dudley Weinberg, who had succeeded Cohn as assistant rabbi. Children of Israel published a special newsletter for overseas members; {{by the end of}} the war, approximately four hundred congregants had served—and fourteen had died—in the U.S. military. As with many other Reform congregations, the members of Temple Israel were split on the issue of Zionism. It is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> majority were anti-Zionist, and the synagogue president joined the anti-Zionist American Council for Judaism, though other prominent members supported Zionism, and still others were simply non-Zionist. Ettelson initially opposed Zionism, though he did not join the council. With the growth of antisemitism inside and outside the United States, his views changed, and he was an early member of the local chapter of the Zionist United Palestine Appeal. Nevertheless, he successfully kept the issue from becoming divisive at the temple.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{parts of}} the church date from around 1300, but it is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> timber-framed church existed on the site before then. The church's {{original}} dedication was to SaintLawrence, but that was later changed to SaintMary. A clerestory was added in the 15thcentury. The tower was built in 1530, and the Stanley pew was added in about 1600. The west gallery, which contained an organ, was installed in 1803. In 1856, the chancel was completely rebuilt, to a design by Cuffley and Starkey, {{paid for by the}} Stanley family. The vestry was constructed in 1860. The church was restored between 1877 and 1878 by Paley and Austin; the nave floor was lowered, the pulpit was replaced, plaster was removed from the roof and the walls, and the box pews were replaced by new oak pews. The tower clock, made in 1743, was renovated in 1997. In 2000, the 16th-century wooden bell-frame was strengthened by the addition of a steel frame, and the Stanley pew was restored.|$|E
5|$|They {{dropped the}} tag team {{title to the}} CM Punk and Colt Cabana at ROH's Chicago-area debut, ROH Reborn: Stage Two, working in ROH {{for the first time}} as outward heels. At the next show, Round Robin Challenge III, the title {{switched}} three times among the teams in the round robin challenge, the Second City Saints (Punk and Cabana), the Briscoe Brothers, and the Prophecy team of Dan Maff and B.J. Whitmer. The Briscoes defeated Maff and Whitmer in the fourth match of the night to win the title for a second time, and then lost it back to Punk and Cabana in the main event. The Brothers both participated in ROH's inaugural Survival of the Fittest tournament, with Mark going over Alex Shelley in his qualifier and Jay falling to Homicide. Mark did not, however, win the elimination final. After losing a two out of three falls tag team title match to Punk and Cabana at Death Before Dishonor II Part 1, ending that feud, they lost in separate singles matches to members of The Rottweilers the next night. Between that and their victory in tag team action at Testing the Limit, it is <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> feud was planned between the Briscoes and the Rottweilers.|$|E
