50|$|This {{example is}} {{representative}} of a SFG (signal-flow graph) used to represent a servo control system and illustrates several features of SFGs. Some of the <b>loops</b> (<b>loop</b> 3, <b>loop</b> 4 and <b>loop</b> 5) are extrinsic intentionally designed feedback <b>loops.</b> These are shown with dotted lines. There are also intrinsic <b>loops</b> (<b>loop</b> 0, loop1, loop2) that are not intentional feedback <b>loops,</b> although they can be analyzed as though they were. These <b>loops</b> are shown with solid lines. <b>Loop</b> 3 and <b>loop</b> 4 are also known as minor <b>loops</b> because they are inside a larger <b>loop.</b>|$|R

5|$|A 2011 {{study of}} the nasal {{passages}} of Euoplocephalus supported their function as a heat and water balancing system, noting the extensive blood vessel system and an increased surface area for the mucosa membrane (used for heat and water exchange in modern animals). The researchers also supported the loops acting as a resonance chamber, comparable to the enlongated nasal passages of saiga antelope and <b>looping</b> trachea of cranes and swans. Reconstructions of the inner ear suggest adaptation to hearing at low frequencies, such as the low-toned resonant sounds possibly produced by the nasal passages. They disputed {{the possibility that the}} <b>looping</b> is related to olfaction (sense of smell) as the olfactionary region is pushed to the sides of the main airway.|$|E
5|$|AirTrain {{connects the}} airport {{terminals}} and parking areas with LIRR and subway lines in Queens. The system {{consists of three}} routes: one route each connecting the terminals with the Howard Beach and Jamaica stations, and one route <b>looping</b> continuously around the central terminal area.|$|E
5|$|As Mars {{approaches}} opposition, {{it begins}} {{a period of}} retrograde motion, which means it will appear to move backwards in a <b>looping</b> motion {{with respect to the}} background stars. The duration of this retrograde motion lasts for about 72 days, and Mars reaches its peak luminosity {{in the middle of this}} motion.|$|E
50|$|In {{their basic}} form, P <b>loops</b> and eye <b>loops</b> are “open” <b>loops.</b> This {{means that the}} <b>loop</b> can be opened {{mechanically}} {{to allow it to}} connect to another component. The opposite of an open <b>loop</b> is a closed <b>loop.</b> In a closed <b>loop,</b> the end of the wire is wrapped around the stem of the <b>loop</b> so that the <b>loop</b> is permanent and can’t be opened. A closed <b>loop</b> is also called a wrapped <b>loop</b> and it is this technique that resulted in this approach to making jewelry being called wire wrapping. A connection between two wrapped <b>loops</b> must be performed BEFORE the second <b>loop</b> is wrapped closed.|$|R
50|$|<b>Loop</b> fission or <b>loop</b> distribution: <b>Loop</b> fission {{attempts}} {{to break a}} <b>loop</b> into multiple <b>loops</b> over the same index range but each taking {{only a part of}} the <b>loop's</b> body. This can improve locality of reference, both of the data being accessed in the <b>loop</b> and the code in the <b>loop's</b> body.|$|R
50|$|<b>Loop</b> invariants are {{essentially}} constants within a <b>loop,</b> but their value may change {{outside of the}} <b>loop.</b> Induction variables are changing by known amounts. The terms are relative to a particular <b>loop.</b> When <b>loops</b> are nested, an induction variable in the outer <b>loop</b> can be a <b>loop</b> invariant in the inner <b>loop.</b>|$|R

Thereafter, the screen flickers and Alex tells the player she is going to meet up with Clarissa, Ren and Nona to go to Edward's Island and she is picking up Jonas, whom she has never met, revealing that time is still <b>looping.</b>|$|E
5|$|Earth overtakes Jupiter every 398.9 days as it orbits the Sun, a {{duration}} {{called the}} synodic period. As it does so, Jupiter appears to undergo retrograde motion {{with respect to}} the background stars. That is, for a period Jupiter seems to move backward in the night sky, performing a <b>looping</b> motion.|$|E
5|$|From Earth, Neptune {{goes through}} {{apparent}} retrograde motion every 367days, {{resulting in a}} <b>looping</b> motion against the background stars during each opposition. These loops carried it close to the 1846 discovery coordinates in April and July 2010 and again in October and November 2011.|$|E
50|$|A {{conditional}} <b>loop</b> has {{the potential}} to become an infinite <b>loop</b> when nothing in the <b>loop's</b> body can affect the outcome of the <b>loop's</b> conditional statement. However, infinite <b>loops</b> can sometimes be used purposely, often with an exit from the <b>loop</b> built into the <b>loop</b> implementation for every computer language, but many share the same basic structure and/or concept. The While <b>loop</b> and the For <b>loop</b> are the two most common types of conditional <b>loops</b> in most programming languages.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{technique}} combining <b>loop</b> distribution with <b>loop</b> fusion {{to improve the}} timing performance without increasing the code size of the transformed <b>loops.</b> We first develop the <b>loop</b> distribution theorems that state the conditions distributing any two-level nested <b>loop</b> in the maximum way. Based on the <b>loop</b> distribution theorems, we design an algorithm to conduct maximum <b>loop</b> distribution. Then we propose a technique of maximum <b>loop</b> distribution with direct <b>loop</b> fusion, which performs maximum <b>loop</b> distribution followed by direct <b>loop</b> fusion. The experimental {{results show that the}} execution time of the transformed <b>loops</b> by our technique is reduced 41. 9 % on average compared to the original <b>loops</b> without the increase of the code size. ...|$|R

5|$|September 5, 1950– Hurricane Easy moves ashore near Cedar Key {{and later}} near Tampa Bay {{as a major}} {{hurricane}} after <b>looping</b> offshore. The hurricane causes locally heavy damage in a sparsely populated area, totaling $3.3million (1950USD, $29.5million 2008USD). Due to its erratic motion, Easy drops heavy rainfall peaking at 38.7inches (983mm) in Yankeetown, which in turn causes 2indirect deaths from electrocution.|$|E
50|$|Conversely, <b>loop</b> fusion (or <b>loop</b> jamming) is a {{compiler}} optimization and <b>loop</b> transformation which replaces multiple <b>loops</b> with {{a single}} one. It is possible when two <b>loops</b> iterate over the same range and do not reference each other's data. <b>Loop</b> fusion does not always improve run-time speed. On some architectures, two <b>loops</b> may actually perform better than one <b>loop</b> because, for example, there is increased data locality within each <b>loop.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{shape of}} the nasal {{chambers}} of Ankylosaurus indicate that airflow was unidirectional, (<b>looping</b> through the lungs during inhalation and exhalation), although it {{may also have been}} bidirectional in the posterior nasal chamber, which directed air past the olfactory lobes. The enlarged olfactory region of ankylosaurids indicates a well-developed sense of smell, and the position of the orbits of Ankylosaurus suggest some stereoscopic vision.|$|E
5|$|As Hurricane Felix was <b>looping</b> {{offshore}} {{the eastern}} United States, it produced swells of 26ft (8m) along the Nova Scotia coast on an otherwise sunny day. Beaches were closed. Buoys near the Newfoundland coast recorded wave heights of 49ft (15m), while buoys farther offshore reported wave heights of 82ft (27.5m). The outer rainbands {{of the storm}} dropped light rainfall, peaking at around 3.43mm (87mm) in northern Newfoundland. Offshore Caithness in Scotland, waves from the remnants of Felix submerged an experimental wave power station, damaging it further after previous waves damaged the system.|$|E
5|$|From its {{headwaters}} in the Coast Mountains, the Yukon River flows northwest, {{across the}} Yukon–Alaska border, until it intersects the Porcupine River at {{the settlement of}} Fort Yukon. At that point, the river turns west and southwest, flowing through the Yukon Flats, a low-lying wetland area containing thousands of ponds, streams, and other small bodies of water. As the river flows southwest, it intersects the Tanana and Koyukuk rivers before <b>looping</b> south, then north into Norton Sound in the Bering Sea.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we explore how to utilize a <b>loop</b> cache {{to relieve the}} {{unnecessary}} pressure placed on the trace cache by <b>loops.</b> Due to the high temporal locality of <b>loops,</b> <b>loops</b> should be cached. We have observed that when <b>loops</b> contain control flow instructions in their bodies {{it is better to}} collect traces on a dedicated <b>loop</b> cache instead of using trace cache space. The traces of instructions within <b>loops</b> tend to exhibit predictable patterns that can be detected and exploited at run-time. We propose to capture dynamic traces of <b>loop</b> bodies in a <b>loop</b> cache. The novelty of this <b>loop</b> cache consists of dynamically capturing <b>loop</b> iterations with conditional branches and correlating them to unique <b>loops.</b> Once <b>loop</b> iterations are cached in the <b>loop</b> cache, their bodies can be provided by the <b>loop</b> cache without polluting the trace cache and without any instruction cache accesses. The proposed <b>loop</b> cache includes hardware capable of dynamically unfolding <b>loops</b> such that large traces of instructions are accessed in a single <b>loop</b> cache interrogation. We evaluate our <b>loop</b> cache and compare it against a baseline machine with a larger first-level instruction cache. We also consider how the <b>loop</b> cache can compliment the introduction of a trace cache by filtering out <b>loop</b> traces that needlessly dominate the trace cache space. We quantify th...|$|R
