In this situation, the <b>local</b> <b>loops</b> F and F' may {{be thought of as}} being “locally the same” near the unit. Certainly, they should not be distinguished by any infinitesimal algebraic structure at the unit, such as those arising in the classical Lie theory (think of formal groups or Lie algebras). With this in mind, we define local equivalence as the equivalence relation on the category of <b>local</b> <b>loops</b> generated by open embeddings.

This was originally scheduled to be released during 2008 but was delayed and scaled back as Virgin Media concentrated on improving its cable broadband proposition instead of focusing on competing with Sky in the premium television market.

2500|$|In a {{decision}} by the Government on 3 May 2006, Telecom was forced to unbundle the <b>local</b> <b>loop,</b> to provide [...] "access to fast, competitively priced broadband internet". The decision significantly affected the company's market share, and allowed competitors (such as TelstraClear, Orcon and Ihug) to offer broadband and other communications services throughout New Zealand by installing their own equipment in exchanges. The announcement of this decision was rushed ahead of schedule, as the documents were leaked to Telecom who advised the government of the leak. It was widely reported that the government had intended to make the announcement during the 2006 Budget. Most of Telecom's competitors and many independent commentators such as InternetNZ and Paul Budde applauded the decision, with opposition to unbundling coming from the Business Roundtable, Federated Farmers, and Bruce Sheppard (representing Telecom shareholders). Legislation was introduced to enable the regulatory changes. Three other political parties (New Zealand First, the Green Party and United Future) supported the decision, which would give the government at least 66 votes if there were no votes against the party line. The main opposition National Party initially opposed the unbundling decision, but later voted in favour of it after a select committee hearing. This left the ACT Party alone in opposing the decision.|$|E
