5|$|The {{build-up}} {{towards a}} war involving Lombards, Gepids, and Byzantines started possibly in 548 or 549, with Audoin and Thurisind each sending an embassy to Justinian's court at Constantinople, {{in attempts to}} obtain military support from Justinian or at least, {{in the case of}} Thurisind, to get a pledge of neutrality. To sway Justinian, Thurisind's envoys reminded him of their long tradition of alliance and promised to fight against Byzantium's enemies. However, the emperor sided with the Lombards; he made them formal allies and promised to provide troops against the Gepids. From Justinian's perspective, this war was of major importance in the <b>larger</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> the Gothic War, because possession of Pannonia was strategically necessary to keep open land communications between Italy and the Balkans.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Bubbling, a {{recently}} introduced graph transformation for functional logic computations, is well-suited for {{the reduction of}} redexes with distinct replacements. Unlike backtracking, bubbling preserves operational completeness; unlike copying, it avoids the up-front construction <b>of</b> <b>large</b> <b>contexts</b> <b>of</b> redexes, an expensive and frequently wasteful operation. We recall the notion of bubbling and offer the first proof of its completeness and soundness with respect to rewriting. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{movement}} began {{within a}} <b>large</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> increasing domination by the Gelug lineage. Beginning in the 17th century, the Gelug view and politics increasingly dominated in Tibet and the minority lineages {{were at risk}} for losing their traditions. At its founding, the Rimé movement was primarily non-Gelugpa teachers and at times the movement has appeared critical of Gelug views. Professor Georges Dreyfus suggests this argumentation was less to create further division but was to bolster minority views that had been marginalized by Gelug supremacy. Nonetheless, philosophic commentaries by early Rimé writers tend to criticize Gelugpa tenets.|$|R

25|$|While {{researching the}} First Folios in the Folger Library, Robert Evans came across an epitaph for Shakespeare that was {{previously}} unrecorded. The epitaph appears in verse, {{similar to that}} of the sonnets, and shows just how highly Shakespeare's contemporaries thought of his work. The lines of the epitaph themselves echo lines from sonnet 55, which bring into thought the ideas of that particular sonnet itself. Through the verses of the sonnet, the young man becomes immortal. Through the verses of the epitaph, as well as the <b>larger</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> praise for the dead poet, Shakespeare himself becomes immortal, echoing and reinforcing his very argument in sonnet 55.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there are}} others who point to the {{changing}} urban aspirations and prospects for mobility that can be seen in Indian cities such as Mumbai in which the film is set.

Parthasarathy (2009) argues for a better understanding of issues of dignity of labour and that the film should be interpreted in a more nuanced way as reflecting the role of market forces and India’s new service economy in transforming the caste and status determined opportunity structure in urban India.|$|E

EU sanctions tend to be imposed in conjunction with measures by other actors: their interplay deserves closer analysis in terms of sequencing, objectives, complexity and legitimacy. The latter is particularly important, given recent criticisms of unilateral sanctions measures voiced at UN forums such as the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council...|$|R
25|$|So far, {{there have}} been many interpretations for the Buddhist crisis and the immolation of Thích Quảng Đức in 1963. Relating the events in a <b>larger</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> Vietnamese Buddhism in twentieth century and looking at the {{interactions}} between Diệm and Buddhist groups, Miller argues that the Buddhist protests during Diệm's regime were not only the struggles for discrimination in religious practices and religious freedom but also the resistances of Vietnamese Buddhism to Diệm's nation building policies centered by Personalist revolution that Buddhists considered a threat to the revival of Vietnamese Buddhist power. Until the end of his life, Diệm, along with his brother Nhu still believed that their nation building was successful and they could resolve the Buddhist crisis in their own way, like what they had done with the Hinh crisis in 1954 and the struggle with the Bình Xuyên in 1955.|$|E
25|$|Lichtman {{argues in}} the book that Trump could face {{impeachment}} for reasons including: complicity of conspiracy with foreign governments, crimes against humanity for the U.S. neglecting global warming, and violation of the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the constitution barring the president from taking personal monetary offerings from other governments. He provides the reader with an overview of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and links between Trump associates and Russian officials, asserting such ties could be used in efforts to impeach President Trump. He uses the Watergate scandal as the backdrop to compare Trump's reactions to criticism with those of Richard Nixon during Nixon's impeachment process. The author discusses assertions of sexual misconduct against Trump, and delves into some of the his legal affairs stemming from them.
