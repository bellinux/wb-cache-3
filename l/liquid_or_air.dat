This Arctic Cat-designed motor was manufactured by Suzuki and featured a 2V SOHC design with hemispherical combustion chambers. Manual and CVT automatic transmissions were offered. A 650V2 V-twin engine option borrowed from the Kawasaki Prairie was also offered starting in 2003. A major redesign of the platform was launched in 2005. With the new redesign came new body work, electronics, rear mounted gas tank and a standard front locking diff, though the chassis in general remained largely unchanged. A new high performance engine platform also debuted in the 650H1. This H1 platform was a direct evolution of the previous suzuki manufactured engines with many parts being interchangeable, but was now manufactured by Arctic Cat in the US. A 700EFI model was also offered which used an engine and transmission combo borrowed from the Suzuki king quad model. This is a 4V dohc design with no relation to the H1 engine platform. This was replaced with the 700H1 which was a higher displacement version of the 650H1 with fuel injection added. A 1000cc H2 V-twin engine, was also made available. Arctic Cat utility ATV's are primarily designed and marketed toward utilitarian uses such as farm work and hunting. Compared to other ATVs, they offer very high ground clearance, low gear ratios for towing, and large steel racks for hauling large loads, and large fuel tanks for extended range. The high ground clearance and locking differentials make them particularly adept off road. They also offer 2 up models, and the TBX model which features a large dump box and high payload capacity, and a Mud Pro model which features factory air snorkels to allow it to drive nearly submerged, larger mud tires, and stronger driveline components.|$|E

This work centers on the design of a Thick film Mass flow Sensor, its fabrication and testing. The principle of operation is based on the phenomenon of loss of heat from the heated resistors to the flowing mass. The design of the sensor fixture is such that the <b>liquid</b> <b>or</b> <b>air</b> flows over equally heated, similar and high TCR value thick film resistances of a Wheatstone bridge. The flow of <b>liquid</b> <b>or</b> <b>air</b> causes uneven cooling of the resistors. This uneven cooling results in an offset due to the imbalance in the bridge. The offset voltage is dependent on the temperature difference of the bridge thermistors which in turn varies in accordance with the mass flow rate. Water and 95 % nitrogen are the masses used to test the sensor. Standard techniques of thick film technology are employed for the sensor fabrication. A traditional calibrated water clock setup with an adjustable flow rate valve is used to test the performance with water. A 95 % nitrogen supply line from the microelectronics laboratory with a calibrated flow meter attached to the fixture is used to test the performance with gas. The final output graphs for the sensor against water and 95 % nitrogen imply that the offset varies in accordance with the flow rate as all other parameters such as the power supply and temperature of the mass are kept constant. The sensor is found to be highly sensitive at lower flow rates and the sensitivity gradually decreases with the increase in flow rate...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the characteristics of the atomization process of a liquid jet injected into a high-pressure air cross-flow, i. e. in condition similar to that occurring in the inlet duct of a LPP gas-turbine burner. The influences of controlling parameters such as air velocity, liquid velocity and diameter of the nozzle are considered. The main features of the spray morphology were determined by means of a tomographic visualization technique and the general evolution of the spray in some typical cases is presented in the paper. It is shown as the jet evolution is significantly influenced by the onset of a stripping atomization mechanism marked by the peculiar morphology of the spray cross-section. This is also evident from the observation of the jet trajectories determined by using a shadowgraphic technique. The different behavior of the atomization process induced by the stripping mechanism led to a bi-stable evolution of jet trajectory in dependence of the prevalence of the <b>liquid</b> <b>or</b> <b>air</b> velocities effects. This feature can be hardly modeled by the interpolating function proposed in the literature. As a consequence, a stronger effort to gain a deeper understanding of the fluid dynamic, involved in the jet break-up in presence of an air cross-flow, is still required in order to build-up a more realistic model of the jet trajectory evolution.

40|$|The {{most recent}} {{analysis}} of energy usage {{in the country}} reveled that nearly 50 % of the power generation is used for air conditioning and mechanical ventilation most of which is used by commercial organizations. The grid generation mix that contains {{a high percentage of}} fossil fuel makes such energy usage environment unfriendly. Although absorption refrigeration is an old technique its economical application is limited to applications where cheap or waste heat energy is available despite decades of R&D, due to low COP, high initial cost and larger size. Heat input at Moderately high (over 120 ᵒC) temperature and need to release large amount of heat to the environment through <b>liquid</b> <b>or</b> <b>air</b> cooling makes absorption chiller less conducive in cooling. Yet, being a tropical country, Sri Lanka has a better potential in adopting solar driven absorption refrigeration, if the chillers are operated at low temperature heat input that also promotes efficiency in storage that is mandatory due to fluctuation of energy source, subject to economic feasibility. The project aims designing and modeling of a solar power driven absorption chiller system that is adoptable to a selected medium size commercial organization. The proposed system uses heat energy around 100 ᵒC and reusing fraction of energy expelled to the environment by suitably modifying operating parameter and thereby increasing efficiency of the system. Reduction of such heat losses and reducing heat input is achieved with the use of secondary heat exchange (brine) system that optimizes the energy usage. This arrangement will make efficient usage of solar heat storage, even in the considerable absence of solar power. System modeling and simulation of both basic double effect chiller and its modified versions were carried out and compared to evaluate improvement.

As time progresses humans {{are becoming more}} aware of need to use so called “alternative energy sources” to alleviate the main energy converters i. e. power stations. The student was tasked with investigating the thermal performance of a solar powered refrigeration cycle (prototype) that could: produce enough refrigeration effect that it replaces the standard home vapour compression unit, used for cooling or freezing of foods, heats up a geyser sufficiently to have hot water for a common house hold, has excess energy to heat or cool <b>liquid</b> <b>or</b> <b>air</b> based environments and {{has the potential to}} lower the electrical bill of a house. The introductory step was to obtain the thermo fluid properties of aqua ammonia solutions. A setback came about when determining the aqua ammonia properties. There were too many conflicting properties being yielded by six different authors. In an attempt to gain confidence in only one author a comparison table was prepared. The table compared the six authors to each other. By looking at all the values compared it brought great clarity to the problem. When continuing the research into the fundamental law approach of solving for the cycle new findings were made. Initially very little comprehensive studies were done which explained in fundamental laws to solve for the absorption cycle. After extensive reviewing of a detailed study on how to solve for absorption refrigeration cycles, then it was able to begin improving on the thermo – fluid design of the cycle. As cycle and component design began to progress the train of thought began to steer in a direction. Each component needed to be detail designed. The advantage of having each component specifically catered for in the cycle design was that it would increase the cycle efficiency. In this way it would ensure that during the concept generation phase the functioning of each component was clear, thereby enabling a clear understanding of how components would compliment each other in a cycle. A mode of solving for the cycle was to endeavour that all parameters could be calculated unambiguously, with the aid of computerisation. Testing was carried out on a real life commercial thermal siphoning machine in order to realistically understand how absorption refrigeration works and gain experience. At {{the end of the study}} the most important result is that the dissertation research shows strong evidence that it will be possible to create a device which can fulfil the four tasks listed above. Another result is a program which is a refined cycle design of the pump absorption type refrigeration. The program solves for points along the cycle.
