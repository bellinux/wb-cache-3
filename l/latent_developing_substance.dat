40|$|Individuals with {{a family}} history of {{substance}} use disorders (FH+) are at a greater risk of <b>developing</b> <b>substance</b> use disorders than their peers with no such family histories (FH-) and this vulnerability is proportional to the number of affected relatives (FH density). The risk for <b>developing</b> <b>substance</b> use disorders peaks during adolescence to early adulthood in the general population, and that is thought to be related to delayed maturation of frontocortical and frontostriatal functional circuits. We hypothesized that FH+ youth and young adults have impaired myelination of frontocortical and frontostriatal white matter tracts. We examined fractional anisotropy (FA) data in 80 FH+ and 34 FH- youths (12. 9 +/- 1. 0 years) and in 25 FH+ and 30 FH- young adults (24. 3 +/- 3. 4 years). FH+ youths had lower FA values in both frontocortical and frontostriatal tracts as well as parietocortical tracts including the anterior, superior and posterior corona radiata and the superior frontal-occipital fasciculus. Moreover, FA values in these tracts were negatively correlated with FH density. FH+ adults had lower FA values in two frontocortical tracts: the genu of the corpus callosum and anterior corona radiata and also significant negative correlations between FA and FH density in these same tracts. In both groups, lower FA values corresponded to higher radial diffusivity suggesting reduced axonal myelination. We interpreted our findings as evidence for impaired myelination of frontal white matter that was proportional to FH density. Our data suggest that deficits may partially resolve with age, paralleling an age-related decline in risk for <b>developing</b> <b>substance</b> use disorders. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Vapors of cyanoacrylate were fed into car through a hose and car itself acts as a fumigation chamber. Matthias (2016) used cyanoacrylate fuming method to <b>develop</b> <b>latent</b> fingermarks on both adhesive and non-adhesive sides of different kinds of tapes (black electrical tape, packaging tape, grey duct tape, masking tape) which were previously treated with Un-Du liquid. It was observed that use of Un-Du liquid did not affect the quality of developed prints and also did not interfere in processing of items with cyanoacrylate fuming method. Lam et al. (2014) recommended the sequential processing with cyanoacrylate fuming, vacuum metal deposition and fluorescent dye staining to <b>develop</b> <b>latent</b> fingermarks on Canadian polymer banknotes. They suggested the immediate processing of banknotes with cyanoacrylate fuming in order to minimize the print degradation.

30|$|It was {{observed}} that relative humidity {{and long term}} storage of latent fingermarks prior to processing had negligible effect {{on the quality of}} cyanoacrylate developed fingerprints on polypropylene foils (Schwarz and Hermanowski 2012). In contrast to this, other authors observed that relative humidity during cyanoacrylate fuming effects the quality of developed prints and microstructure of the polycyanoacrylate. However, relative humidity has less influence on sebaceous marks (Paine et al. 2011). Kendall observed that several hours to several days may take place to <b>develop</b> <b>latent</b> fingermarks using super glue fuming (Kendall 1982). However, heating of cyanoacrylate reduces the time required to <b>develop</b> <b>latent</b> fingermarks (Olenik 1984). Overheating of cyanoacrylate ester should be avoided as it produces toxic hydrogen cyanide, if heated above approximately 220  °C (Mock 1985; Masters 2002). Kendall and Rehn (1983) observed that polymerization of cyanoacrylate reduces the time required to <b>develop</b> <b>latent</b> fingermarks. Pires and Springer (2016) observed that aluminum did not retard the polymerization of cyanoacrylate prior to vaporization. However, in contrast to this, some studies reported that aluminum acts as a polymerization retardant in <b>developing</b> <b>latent</b> fingermarks using cyanoacrylate fuming method (Olenik 1984; Olenik 1983; Lewis et al. 2001; Tuthill 1982).|$|R
