40|$|Introduction: Human {{stem cell}} lines and their derivatives, as {{alternatives}} {{to the use of}} animal cells or cancer cell lines, have been widely discussed as cellular models in predictive toxicology. However, the role of stem cells in the development of <b>long-term</b> <b>toxicities</b> and carcinogenesis has not received great attention so far, despite growing evidence indicating the relationship of stem cell damage to adverse effects later in life. However, testing this in vitro is a scientific/technical challenge in particular due to the complex interplay of factors existing under physiological conditions. Current major research programs in stem cell toxicity are not aiming to demonstrate that stem cells can be targeted by toxicants. Therefore, this knowledge gap needs to be addressed in additional research activities developing technical solutions and defining appropriate experimental designs. Areas covered: The current review describes selected examples of the role of stem cells in the development of <b>long-term</b> <b>toxicities</b> in the brain, heart or liver and in the development of cancer. Expert opinion: The presented examples illustrate the need to analyze the contribution of stem cells to chronic toxicity {{in order to make a}} final conclusion whether stem cell toxicities are an underestimated risk in mechanism-based safety assessments. This requires the development of predictive in vitro models allowing the assessment of adverse effects to stem cells on chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity...|$|R

Imatinib, the BCR-ABL 1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), {{was the first of}} its kind to specifically target and inhibit the underlying Philadelphia chromosome (Ph+) oncogene found to be driving chronic myeloid leukemia in adults, and has since become standard of care for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia in children. Imatinib, with its ability to target Ph+ leukemia, has been successfully incorporated into the treatment of not only pediatric chronic myeloid leukemia but also Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia. With the incorporation of imatinib into combination chemotherapy for pediatric Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia, current survival rates are far higher than at any other time for this once dreadful disease. With more children today receiving treatment with imatinib for either chronic myeloid leukemia or Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia, knowledge is accumulating surrounding the short-term and <b>long-term</b> <b>toxicities</b> observed in children, adolescents, and young adults treated with this TKI. In summary, the TKI imatinib has made a historic impact in the treatment of pediatric Ph+ leukemias, transforming what were once very high-risk diseases with considerable morbidity and mortality into ones that are now very treatable but with a new awareness surrounding the <b>long-term</b> <b>toxicities</b> that may come with this price for cure.

5000|$|Use of {{radiation}} therapy after lumpectomy provides equivalent survival rates to mastectomy, {{although there is}} a slightly higher risk of recurrent disease in the same breast in the form of further DCIS or invasive breast cancer.

[...] The Cochrane review did not find any evidence that the radiation therapy had any long-term toxic effects.

40|$|Abstract Background In our {{previous}} SMC NB- 2004 study {{of patients with}} high-risk neuroblastomas, which incorporated total-body irradiation (TBI) with second high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (HDCT/auto-SCT), the survival rate was encouraging; however, short- and <b>long-term</b> <b>toxicities</b> were significant. In the present SMC NB- 2009 study, only TBI was replaced with 131 I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) treatment {{in order to reduce}} toxicities. Methods From January 2009 to December 2013, 54 consecutive patients were assigned to receive tandem HDCT/auto-SCT after nine cycles of induction chemotherapy. The CEC (carboplatin + etoposide + cyclophosphamide) regimen and the TM (thiotepa + melphalan) regimen with (for metastatic MIBG avid tumors) or without (for localized or MIBG non-avid tumors) 131 I-MIBG treatment (18 or 12  mCi/kg) were used for tandem HDCT/auto-SCT. Local radiotherapy, differentiation therapy with 13 -cis-retinoic acid, and immunotherapy with interleukin- 2 were administered after tandem HDCT/auto-SCT. Results Fifty-two patients underwent the first HDCT/auto-SCT and 47 patients completed tandem HDCT/auto-SCT. There was no significant immediate toxicity during the 131 I-MIBG infusion. Acute toxicities during the tandem HDCT/auto-SCT were less severe in the NB- 2009 study than in the NB- 2004 study. Late effects such as growth hormone deficiency, cataracts, and glomerulopathy evaluated at 3  years after the second HDCT/auto-SCT were also less significant in the NB- 2009 study than in NB- 2004 study. There was no difference in the 5 -year event-free survival (EFS) between the two studies (67. 5 [*]±[*] 6. 7 % versus 58. 3 [*]±[*] 6. 9 %, P[*]=[*] 0. 340).
