It was {{originally}} designed to run on top of Operating System/2 Extended Edition. The network client was called IBM LAN Requester and was included with OS/2 EE 1.1 by default. (Eventually IBM shipped other clients and supported yet more. Examples include the IBM OS/2 File/Print Client, IBM OS/2 Peer, and client software for Windows.) Here the short term <b>LAN</b> <b>Server</b> refers to the IBM OS/2 <b>LAN</b> <b>Server</b> product.

40|$|The {{explosive}} {{growth of the}} Internet, {{the widespread use of}} WWW-related applications, and the increased reliance on client-server architectures places interesting new demands on network servers. In particular, the operating system running on such systems needs to manage the machine 's resources in a manner that maximizes and maintains throughput under conditions of high load. We propose and evaluate a new network subsystem architecture that provides improved fairness, stability, and increased throughput under high network load. The architecture is hardware independent and does not degrade network latency or bandwidth under normal load conditions. 1 Introduction Most work on operating system support for high-speed networks to date has focused on improving message latency and on delivering the network's full bandwidth to application programs [1, 5, 7, 21].

40|$|Abstract: In Unix environments, {{application}} logs often quickly grow unexpectedly large. This paper reviews various available {{solutions that}} attempt to manage that growth and proposes an elemental addition to filesystems that assists in managing unexpected growth. Additionally, a prototype of the filesystem element for MINIX is developed and development notes are presented. The filesystem element is {{a new type of}} file which grows to a specific size and then upon a block allocation beyond that threshold, it deletes the first block of the file. When this filetype is appended, it acts as a finite-length FIFO queue that has elements consumed when it is written to. I Introduction and motivation for a solution Web servers, database servers, application <b>servers,</b> and <b>LAN</b> <b>servers,</b> all tend to log a large amount of data for security and for troubleshooting purposes. Part of the task of system administration is to allocate disk space for these logs and to manage these logs. 1 While infinite logging would be preferred by many, it is not practical and disk spac...|$|R

While allowing players to experience many features from the full version of Blockland, players are limited to loading default builds and cannot load any third party add-ons or saves. Included in the demo is a tutorial in which the players can learn the basics of Blockland. You may also jump into several pre-created maps for you to explore and build in. The demo also does not allow online play, limiting players to single-player games. It is, however, possible to join <b>LAN</b> <b>servers</b> created by owners of the full version.

The UK-distributed free demo CD-ROM of OS/2 Warp essentially contained the entire OS and was easily, even accidentally, cracked, meaning that even people who liked it did not have to buy it. This was seen as a backdoor tactic {{to increase the number of}} OS/2 users, in the belief that this would increase sales and demand for third-party applications, and thus strengthen OS/2's desktop numbers. This suggestion was bolstered by the fact that this demo version had replaced another which was not so easily cracked, but which had been released with trial versions of various applications. In 2000, the July edition of Australian Personal Computer magazine bundled software CD-ROMs, included a full version of Warp 4 that required no activation and was essentially a free release. Special versions of OS/2 2.11 and Warp 4 also included symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) support.|$|E
40|$|To {{reduce the}} cost and {{complexity}} of the current DoD information infrastructure, a Multilevel Secure (MLS) network solution eliminating hardware redundancies is required. Implementing a high assurance MLS LAN requires the ability to extend a trusted path over a TCP/IP network. No high assurance network trusted path mechanisms currently exist. We present a design and proof- of-concept implementation for a Secure <b>LAN</b> <b>Server</b> that provides the trusted path between a trusted computing base extension (TCBE) servicing a COTS PC and protocol servers executing at single sensitivity levels on the XTS- 300. The trusted path establishes high assurance communications (over a TCP/IP network) between a TCBE and the Secure <b>LAN</b> <b>Server.</b> This trusted channel is used first for user authentication, then as a trusted relay between the protocol server and TCBE. All transmitted data passed over the LAN can be protected by encryption, providing assurance of integrity and confidentiality for the data.

40|$|Although use of {{patients}} {{in the classroom is}} valuable in teaching neuroscience, both live and analog videotape demonstrations have inherent limitations. Patient availability may be unreliable, and analog videotape is costly to distribute and incorporate into presentations and examinations. The objective of our project is to create digital source videos depicting neurologic disorders, organize them into a searchable database on an Internet server, and distribute them as a neuroscience resource, free of charge, to health care educational institutions. The specific aims are to (1) create digital video of a neurologist performing the physical examination on patients with neurologic disease, (2) compress this video for Internet delivery in QuickTime streaming format, and (3) organize these video files into a searchable database on an Internet server for file transfer protocol (FTP) download to client institutions. FTP download of streamable files will allow client institutions to organize the files to suit their needs, and distribute them via their own local area network (LAN). This will assure the bandwidth necessary for delivery and uninterrupted playback of this full motion (30 fps) video. Preliminary compressions were done using Sorenson Video variable bitrate option to produce video files deliverable over bandwidths of 30 - 50 Kilobytes/sec (KBS).
