25|$|The image {{can be read}} as a petrified {{synthesis}} of all the stages during and after the Descent from the Cross: the lowering of the corpse, the Deposition, Lamentation and the Entombment. Christ's feet appear to be still nailed together, while the spread of His arms retains the position of His body on the Cross. Christ's body is shown as if held out for the concentrated gaze of the viewer. Joseph of Arimathea <b>looks</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> body towards the skull of Adam. Joseph appears as a sumptuously dressed burgher and has the most portrait-like appearance of the figures in the painting; his gaze links the hands of Christ and his mother, the new Adam and Eve, with the skull of Adam. Thereby visualising the essence of the Redemption.|$|E
500|$|Most of {{this stretch}} of the trail is on forest roads. From the Monastic City at Glendalough, the Way follows the Green Road towards the Upper Lake. It passes through an area of native {{woodland}} made up of oak, holly, birch, and rowan. Ascending from the Upper Lake, the trail reaches Poulanass Waterfall which, over millennia, has cut a narrow gorge through the slate rock and borne millions of tonnes of rock, sand and mud into Glendalough, dividing what was originally one lake into the two seen today. The trail continues its ascent through forest before emerging onto the saddle between Mullacor and Lugduff mountains at Borenacrow. The Borenacrow route between Glendalough and Glenmalure dates back to ancient times {{and there is a}} local tradition that Saint Kevin travelled this way to celebrate Mass in Glenmalure. The view ahead <b>looks</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Glenmalure valley at Fraughan Rock Glen and Lugnaquilla, Wicklow's highest mountain at [...] The Way then begins a long descent into Glenmalure, the longest glacial valley in Ireland and Great Britain. Along the way the trail passes another Adirondack shelter, constructed in 2006 by Mountain [...] Reaching the floor of the valley, the Way joins the Military Road to reach Drumgoff Crossroads. Crossing the River Avonbeg, the route passes the remains of an old military barracks, built around 1800, and enters Drumgoff Wood. At the forest entrance is a granite pillar marking the official halfway point of the Wicklow Way. The trail follows a forest road along the flanks of Slieve Maan before briefly re-joining the Military Road and then following a forest road around Carrickashane Mountain before reaching the road at Iron Bridge where the Way crosses the Ow River. Another Adirondack shelter, again constructed by Mountain [...] volunteers with assistance from the Glenwalk Hillwalking Club, can be found at Mucklagh, on the slopes of Carrickashane Mountain.|$|E

6000|$|When all was over, Charles rushed off to Cannes, to {{get away}} from the impertinent stare of London. Amelia and Isabel and I went with him. We were driving one {{afternoon}} on the hills beyond the town, among the myrtle and lentisk scrub, when we noticed in front of us a nice victoria, containing two ladies in very deep mourning. We followed it, unintentionally, as far as Le Grand Pin--that big pine tree that <b>looks</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> bay towards Antibes. There, the ladies descended and sat down on a knoll, gazing out disconsolately towards the sea and the islands. It was evident they were suffering very deep grief.

60|$|All night, then, {{we walked}} through {{the north side of}} the Carse under the high line of the Ochil mountains; and by Alloa and Clackmannan and Culross, all of which we avoided: and about ten in the morning, mighty hungry and tired, came to the little clachan of Limekilns. This is a place that sits near in by the water-side, and <b>looks</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> Hope to the town of the Queensferry. Smoke went up from both of these, and from other villages and farms upon all hands. The fields were being reaped; two ships lay anchored, and boats were coming and going on the Hope.

6000|$|For {{the passing}} stranger, {{or even the}} {{protracted}} so-journer, whose time and money are not too much at odds, a hotel is best, and a hotel in the new quarter is pleasanter than one in the old quarters. Ours, at any rate, was in a wide, sunny, and (if I must own it) dusty street, {{laid out in a}} line of beauty on the borders of the former Villa Ludovisi, where the aging or middle-aging reader used to come to see Guercino's [...] "Aurora" [...] in the roof of the casino. Now all trace of the garden is hidden under vast and vaster hotels and great blond apartment-houses, and ironed down with trolley-rails; but the Guercino has been spared, though it is no longer so accessible to the public. Still, there is a garden left, and our hotel, with others, <b>looks</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> sun and dust of its street into the useful vegetation of the famous old Capuchin convent, with the church, to which I came so eagerly so long ago to revere Guido's [...] "St. Michael and the Dragon" [...] and the decorative bones of the good brothers braided on the walls and roofs of the crypt in the indissoluble community of floral and geometric designs.|$|E
60|$|Half an hour {{afterwards}} she popped {{her head}} in the study to bid me good-bye, wishing to see if I appreciated her. She was so charming in her fresh linen frock and flowered hat, that I could not but be proud of her. She expected me to follow her to the window, for from between the great purple rhododendrons she waved me a lace mitten, then glinted on like a flower moving brightly through the green hazels. Her path lay through the wood in the opposite direction from Strelley Mill, down the red drive across the tree-scattered space to the highroad. This road ran along the end of our lakelet, Nethermere, for {{about a quarter of a}} mile. Nethermere is the lowest in a chain of three ponds. The other two are the upper and lower mill ponds at Strelley: this is the largest and most charming piece of water, a mile long and about a quarter of a mile in width. Our wood runs down to the water's edge. On the opposite side, on a hill beyond the farthest corner of the lake, stands Highclose. It <b>looks</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> water at us in Woodside with one eye as it were, while our cottage casts a sidelong glance back again at the proud house, and peeps coyly through the trees.|$|E

60|$|The men I met {{coming from}} Jerusalem {{reported}} {{all sorts of}} contradictory impressions; and yet my own impression contradicted them all. Their impressions were doubtless as true as mine; but I describe my own because it is true, and because I think it points to a neglected truth about the real Jerusalem. I need not say I did not expect the real Jerusalem to be the New Jerusalem; a city of charity and peace, {{any more than a}} city of chrysolite and pearl. I might more reasonably have expected an austere and ascetic place, oppressed with the weight of its destiny, with no inns except monasteries, and these sealed with the terrible silence of the Trappists; an awful city where men speak by signs in the street. I did not need the numberless jokes about Jerusalem to-day, to warn me against expecting this; anyhow I did not expect it, and certainly I did not find it. But neither did I find what I was much more inclined to expect; something at the other extreme. Many reports had led me to look for a truly cosmopolitan town, that is a truly conquered town. I looked for a place like Cairo, containing indeed old and interesting things, but open on every side to new and vulgar things; full of the touts who seem only created for the tourists and the tourists who seem only created for the touts. There may be more of this in the place than pleases those who would idealise it. But I fancy there is much less of it than is commonly supposed in the reaction from such an ideal. It does not, like Cairo, offer the exciting experience of twenty guides fighting for one traveller; of young Turks drinking American cocktails as a protest against Christian wine. The town is quite inconvenient enough to make it a decent place for pilgrims. Or a stranger might have imagined a place even less Western than Cairo, one of those villages of Palestine described in dusty old books of Biblical research. He might remember drawings like diagrams representing a well or a wine-press, rather a dry well, so to speak, and a wine-press very difficult to associate with wine. These hard colourless outlines never did justice to the colour of the East, but even to give it the colour of the East would not do justice to Jerusalem. If I had anticipated the Bagdad of all our dreams, a maze of bazaars glowing with gorgeous wares, I should have been wrong again. There is quite enough of this vivid and varied colour in Jerusalem, {{but it is not the}} first fact that arrests the attention, and certainly not the first that arrested mine. I give my own first impression as a fact, for what it is worth and exactly as it came. I did not expect it, and it was some time before I even understood it. As soon as I was walking inside the walls of Jerusalem, I had an overwhelming impression that I was walking in the town of Rye, where it <b>looks</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> flat sea-meadows towards Winchelsea.|$|E
6000|$|Are, then, our woods, our mountains, and our streams, [...] Needful {{to teach}} our poets how to sing? [...] O, maiden rare, far other {{thoughts}} were ours, [...] When we have sat by ocean's foaming marge, [...] And watched the waves leap roaring on the rocks, [...] Than young Leander and his Hero had, [...] Gazing from Sestos to the other shore. [...] The moon looks down and ocean worships her, [...] Stars rise and set, and seasons come and go [...] Even {{as they did in}} Homer's elder time, [...] But we behold them not with Grecian eyes: [...] Then they were types of beauty and of strength, [...] But now of freedom, unconfined and pure, [...] Subject alone to Order's higher law. [...] What cares the Russian serf or Southern slave [...] Though we should speak as man spake never yet [...] Of gleaming Hudson's broad magnificence, [...] Or green Niagara's never-ending roar? [...] Our country hath a gospel of her own [...] To preach and practise before all the world,-- [...] The freedom and divinity of man, [...] The glorious claims of human brotherhood,-- [...] Which to pay nobly, as a freeman should, [...] Gains the sole wealth that will not fly away,-- [...] And the soul's fealty to none but God. [...] These are realities, which make the shows [...] Of outward Nature, be they ne'er so grand, [...] Seem small, and worthless, and contemptible. [...] These are the mountain-summits for our bards, [...] Which stretch far upward into heaven itself, [...] And give such wide-spread and exulting view [...] Of hope, and faith, and onward destiny, [...] That shrunk Parnassus to a molehill dwindles. [...] Our new Atlantis, like a morning-star, [...] Silvers the murk face of slow-yielding Night, [...] The herald of a fuller truth than yet [...] Hath gleamed upon the upraisèd face of Man [...] Since the earth glittered in her stainless prime,-- [...] Of a more glorious sunrise than of old [...] Drew wondrous melodies from Memnon huge, [...] Yea, draws them still, though now he sits waist-deep [...] In the engulfing flood of whirling sand, [...] And <b>looks</b> <b>across</b> <b>the</b> wastes of endless gray, [...] Sole wreck, where once his hundred-gated Thebes [...] Pained with her mighty hum the calm, blue heaven. [...] Shall the dull stone pay grateful orisons, [...] And we till noonday bar the splendor out, [...] Lest it reproach and chide our sluggard hearts, [...] Warm-nestled in the down of Prejudice, [...] And be content, though clad with angel-wings, [...] Close-clipped, to hop about from perch to perch, [...] In paltry cages of dead men's dead thoughts? [...] O, rather like the sky-lark, soar and sing, [...] And let our gushing songs befit the dawn [...] And sunrise, and the yet unshaken dew [...] Brimming the chalice of each full-blown hope, [...] Whose blithe front turns to greet the growing day. [...] Never had poets such high call before, [...] Never can poets hope for higher one, [...] And, if they be but faithful to their trust, [...] Earth will remember them with love and joy, [...] And O, far better, God will not forget.

[...] Wait for no hints from waterfalls or woods, [...] Nor dream that tales of red men, brute and fierce, [...] Repay the finding of this Western World, [...] Or needed half the globe to give them birth: [...] Spirit supreme of Freedom! not for this [...] Did great Columbus tame his eagle soul [...] To jostle with the daws that perch in courts; [...] Not for this, friendless, on an unknown sea, [...] Coping with mad waves and more mutinous spirits, [...] Battled he with the dreadful ache at heart [...] Which tempts, with devilish subtleties of doubt, [...] The hermit of that loneliest solitude, [...] The silent desert of a great New Thought; [...] Though loud Niagara were to-day struck dumb, [...] Yet would this cataract of boiling life, [...] Rush plunging on and on to endless deeps [...] And utter thunder till the world shall cease,-- [...] A thunder worthy of the poet's song, [...] And which alone can fill it with true life.
