40|$|Encyclopédie en 3 volumes, 1996 pagesOver {{the last}} two decades, {{contrary}} to the pension system, the family policy branch of the Social security system has been immune to cutbacks in provision and no retrenchment measures have been implemented. This mirrors the salience of family-related issues {{in the social and}} political agenda. This also reflects the fact that the family branch and its large network of <b>Local</b> <b>Allowance</b> Funds (CAFs) are responsible for the management of welfare state provisions. The family branch is a transfer-heavy system which aims at reducing social inequalities and fighting against poverty. It also provides families with a rich array of universal cash benefits which aim to lighten the financial burden for families irrespective of their income. These measures are successful in reducing the poverty rate among families, in particular lone parent families. Since the seventies, family policy has progressively integrated the ‘working mother model' and the range of measures to help working parents has recently been expanded yet again...|$|E
5000|$|Questions of {{fairness}} of the <b>Local</b> Housing <b>Allowance</b> system were raised when it was revealed in October 2008 that a family in the London borough of Ealing was receiving £150,000 a year in <b>Local</b> Housing <b>Allowance</b> to rent a 7 bedroom property. [...] As the Brown government acknowledged in the 2009 Budget, families on benefit might be significantly better off than low income families who {{are not eligible for}} housing benefits. [...] "Indications ... are that some claimants may be able to afford accommodation that is out of reach of working families on low incomes. Furthermore, costs of Housing Benefit have been rising above inflation despite static caseloads." [...] The transition from the old housing benefit system to <b>Local</b> Housing <b>Allowance</b> significantly increased payments available for larger houses in some areas, as can be seen by comparing the Local Reference Rent calculated by the Valuation Office Agency, which served as the basis for determining the old housing benefit, against the current <b>Local</b> Housing <b>Allowance.</b> As an example, the Local Reference Rent for the largest type of house in the East Thames Valley locality in March 2009 was £328.85 per week, while the <b>Local</b> Housing <b>Allowance</b> for a similar property in the same area was £646.15 per week, an increase of £16,500 per year. However, the maximum that claimants can now claim <b>Local</b> Housing <b>Allowance</b> for under the coalition government is £400 a week, for a maximum of a four bedroom property. Regional variations also apply meaning that the maximum in areas with low rent prices LHA maximum will be much much lower than £400 a week.|$|R

50|$|In October 2002 the Government {{announced}} {{the introduction of}} the <b>Local</b> Housing <b>Allowance</b> (LHA) to replace existing Housing Benefit rent restrictions for private tenants. <b>Local</b> Housing <b>Allowance</b> uses the same regulations as the existing scheme. LHA is means tested and tapered {{in exactly the same way}} as Housing Benefit - however, the eligible rent is fixed for a household of a given size in a given region. This region will include many towns. Housing Benefit is not normally restricted below the advertised LHA rate; up until 2009 a tenant moving into accommodation cheaper than the LHA rate was allowed to keep the difference, after 2009 this was limited to a maximum of £15.|$|R
50|$|Changes to the <b>local</b> housing <b>allowance</b> were {{announced}} in the June 2010 budget. The first changes are planned to come into effect between April 2011 and October 2011. The VOA Rent Officers now provide the BRMA and lettings data on a new facility for London.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Local</b> Housing <b>Allowance</b> (LHA) was {{introduced}} on 7 April 2008 to provide Housing Benefit entitlement for tenants renting private sector accommodation in England, Scotland and Wales. The LHA system introduced significant {{changes to the}} way Housing Benefit (HB) levels are restricted and how benefit is paid. It did not replace Housing Benefit - {{it is just a}} different way of calculating entitlement under the existing Housing Benefit scheme: the <b>Local</b> Housing <b>Allowance</b> is based on the 30th percentile of local rented accommodation. LHA rates relate to the area in which the housing benefit claim is made. These areas are called Broad Rental Market Areas, defined as [...] "where a person could reasonably be expected to live taking into account access to facilities and services." ...|$|R

50|$|Since April 2008, new {{private sector}} benefit claimants receive housing benefit under revised rent {{restriction}} rules called <b>Local</b> Housing <b>Allowance.</b> From April 2017 people {{between the ages}} of 18 and 21 will not ordinarily be entitled to housing benefit.

50|$|Where the {{landlord}} is a not for profit company (or voluntary organisation), a Registered Social Landlord or a Local Council that provides care support or supervision, {{they will be}} exempt from <b>Local</b> Housing <b>Allowance</b> and will fall under the housing benefit rules in operation prior to 2 January 1996.|$|R
50|$|<b>Local</b> Housing <b>Allowance</b> is {{designed}} to ensure that landlords {{do not have a}} reason to discriminate against tenants on Housing Benefit, as in most cases there will be no need for a landlord to know that the tenant is on Housing Benefit, and the tenant can know in advance if rent will be met in full.|$|R

50|$|The final {{scheme was}} {{different}} {{in that the}} maximum difference between the rent payable and the eligible <b>local</b> housing <b>allowance</b> was restricted to £15.

5000|$|A <b>Local</b> Housing <b>Allowance</b> (LHA) policy restricting Housing Benefit {{for private}} sector tenants {{to cover a}} maximum number of rooms had been in place since 2008. It was {{extended}} in April 2013 to cover public housing in the United Kingdom (except Northern Ireland). The resulting under-occupancy penalty, {{commonly known as the}} [...] "bedroom tax", affected an estimated 660,000 working age social housing tenants in the UK, reducing weekly incomes by £12-£22. The measure reduced the expenditure of the Department for Work and Pensions by approximately £500 million per year.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Local</b> Housing <b>Allowance</b> was {{introduced}} across all Local Authority areas on 7 April 2008. The legislation {{to enable the}} scheme is contained in the Welfare Reform Act which received Royal Assent in May 2007. The local authorities that trialled the new system were known as Pathfinder Authorities. They were Argyll and Bute, Blackpool, Brighton and Hove, Conwy county borough, Coventry, East Riding of Yorkshire, City of Edinburgh, Guildford, City of Leeds, London Borough of Lewisham, North East Lincolnshire, Norwich, Pembrokeshire, City of Salford, South Norfolk, Metropolitan Borough of St Helens, Teignbridge, London Borough of Wandsworth ...|$|R

One bedroom is allowed for each of the following: ...|$|R
5000|$|In January 2013 Lewis was criticised for {{comments}} {{he had made}} about <b>local</b> councillors' <b>allowances</b> by Clive Betts, the Chair of the Communities and Local Government Select Committee. Later in 2013 Lewis was critical of local councils, including many Conservative run councils, planning council tax rises in 2013 against {{the wishes of the}} government, saying that there was [...] "still massive scope" [...] for councils to cut [...] "waste and inefficiency". He has also attacked the Local Government Association for producing proposals to give local councils more freedom over their levels of council tax in the future.|$|R
50|$|Before the {{introduction}} of the <b>Local</b> Housing <b>Allowance</b> the only way of finding out whether the benefit for the property would be restricted would have been to obtain a Pre Tenancy Determination. These had to be requested through the local authority and The Rent Service decision was treated by the Local Authority {{in the same way as}} any other referral to the Rent Service. Requests needed to be made by a prospective tenant and the landlord of the property. If the circumstances of the individual claimant were broadly the same as that of the prospective tenant who made the request for the PTD the decision remained valid for a year.|$|R
50|$|Direct {{payment of}} the housing {{component}} of Universal Credit (i.e. {{what used to be}} Housing Benefit) to tenants {{has been the subject of}} controversy. Although housing benefit has long been paid to most private sector tenants directly, for social housing tenants it has historically been paid directly to their landlords. As a result, the implementation of a social housing equivalent to the <b>Local</b> Housing <b>Allowance</b> policy, which has been present in the private sector without comment for over a decade, has widely been perceived as a tax on having extra bedrooms, rather than the tenant making up a shortfall in the rent arising from a standardisation of their level of benefit.|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} also {{available}} online at: [URL] part of its reform of Housing Benefit, the Government has introduced a <b>Local</b> Housing <b>Allowance</b> (LHA) for private rented sector claimants in nine Pathfinder areas. This report gives early findings from the claimant stream of the evaluation of LHA and covers the period up to around {{six months after the}} start of LHA in each Pathfinder. It is important to stress that these are early, emerging findings. Many claimants will only just have gone onto LHA or received direct payment for the first time, so the behavioural impacts of LHA are unlikely to have fed through as yet. These will be monitored throughout the evaluation period to assess any future changes and so these findings may develop over time...|$|R
50|$|The Government has {{introduced}} a new rent restriction policy for the calculation of Housing Benefit for private tenants called <b>Local</b> Housing <b>Allowance.</b> The scheme replaces two previous methods of controlling high rents for most new tenancies. Old scheme cases where the local authority decided the level of restriction based {{on the cost of}} suitable alternative accommodation (in operation from 15 January 1989 to 1 January 1996), Reference Rent cases, where the level of eligible rent was decided by the Rent Service based on the lower of what a landlord {{would have been able to}} obtain had a landlord not been renting to a tenant on Housing Benefit (the claim related rent) and the average cost of similar properties in that area (the local reference rent).|$|R
50|$|The <b>Local</b> Housing <b>Allowance</b> {{is set at}} the 30th {{percentile}} {{level for}} rents in the Broad Market Rental Area. The Broad Market Rental areas are similar in geographic size to Counties. This {{has led to a}} number of counties such as Cambridgeshire criticising the scheme because market rents in the city area of the county are considerably higher than those in the shire areas of the county. The House of Lords ruled against the concept of very large Broad Market Rental areas in the Heffernan case (R (Heffernan) v The Rent Service 2008 UKHL 58). The DWP re-introduced legislation to overturn this decision, restoring its intention to use very large broad market rental areas to draw down the cost of the scheme.|$|R
50|$|Anyone {{who was in}} {{receipt of}} the Guarantee Credit part of Pension Credit was also {{eligible}} for full Housing Benefit. This could be a significant amount, ensuring that a retired person in this position has their rent paid in full. However, the Coalition government proposed to change this rule in a substantial manner by abolishing Housing Benefit. It was intended that from October 2014, Pension Credit would gain a new core element for Housing costs comparable with the Housing Element of Universal Credit, for working-age benefit claimants. The Housing element {{would be based on}} <b>Local</b> Housing <b>Allowance,</b> in a similar manner to Housing Benefit, but payments would be incorporated within Pension Credit, rather than being a separate benefit claimed from the local council. It is not clear when, or if, this plan will be implemented.|$|R

50|$|Parish councils {{comprise}} volunteer councillors who {{are elected}} to serve for four years. Decisions {{of the council}} are carried out by a paid officer, typically known as a parish clerk. Councils may employ additional people (including bodies corporate, provided where necessary, by tender) to carry out specific tasks dictated by the council.
