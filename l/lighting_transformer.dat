Gardner's also won contracts with the Telecommunications Research Establishment and the Ministry of Aircraft Production. After the war, contracts from the Admiralty and the Atomic Energy Research Establishment allowed the business to grow and Gardner's were soon employing around 300 people. Gardner's contributed to the local economy not just because it was a major employer but also because it attracted others to the area such as Penny and Giles (potentiometers) and Plessey Defence Systems who came to take advantage of the local skilled workforce. The factory closed in the late 1990s partly due to an increase in cheap imports.|$|R

40|$|For voltage {{adaptation}} and galvanic isolation in High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) converter stations, standard transformers operating at grid frequency are currently used. These devices {{tend to be}} very large and heavy, which is undesirable in many applications. Transformers where the magnetic parts operate at a frequency considerably higher than the grid frequency could offer many advantages. Smaller and <b>lighter</b> <b>transformers</b> and lower losses are among them. In this thesis, a future-oriented HVDC converter station using a medium frequency MF transformer is studied with special focus on the converter circuits. The converter size used in this work is 78 MW (± 75 kVDC/ 11 kVAC) and the main application is power transmission to and from offshore installations. The converter consists of a snubbered Voltage-Source Converter VSC and 2 -phase by 3 -phase cycloconverter connected by a MF transformer. The VSC is implemented using a single phase leg and the cycloconverter is implemented using fast thyristors. It is expected that the semiconductor losses of the power conversion system will be significantly reduced by the use of the proposed converter topology which permits soft switching of all semiconductor valves in all operating points without any auxiliary valve. The thesis evaluates the commercial potential of the proposed HVDC system. A general circuit design based on available preconditions is made first for the studied converter station, and then a comparison with an existing two-level HVDC-Light station with regard to semiconductor requirements and losses is performed for the same operating point. The total space occupied by the valve installations for both systems is also estimated. The comparison shows that the proposed system promises a considerable {{reduction in the number of}} semiconductor devices and, as a result, the total volume of the converter valves.

40|$|Offshore {{wind power}} has an {{increasing}} {{interest in the}} research community and among the politicians. Therefore {{it is important to}} find the right solutions to meet the environmental and commercial requirements to give offshore wind power a promising future. This thesis are proposing a new converter topology for offshore wind parks. Since the topology is based on DC transmission in stead of AC transmission it is better suited for use in this type of parks. All the converters are located in the wind turbines and the turbines are connected in series directly connected to shore without any transformation stages. The one-phase AC to three-phase AC converter with the new switching pattern is explained and a method to calculate the losses in the converter is given. The loss calculation method is based on the characteristics of the switch found in the data sheet, which in this case is a RB-IGBT. The conduction losses, turn-on, turn-off and recovery losses for one switch are calculated and multiplied with the number of switches in the converter. An equation of the total losses per switch is given and there are performed loss simulations for the converter in PSCAD with good results. In the AC-AC converter there are bidirectional switches, in this case two reverse-blocking IGBTs. The RB-IGBT is compared to other types of bidirectional switches which is made of IGBTs and diodes in anti parallel. The comparison shows that with the RB-IGBTs the on-state voltage drop is halved since a RB-IGBT has the same on-state voltage drop as a normal IGBT. This also reduces the on-state losses. The architecture of the RB-IGBT is almost the same as the IGBT but with an extension of the p+ layer on the edges up to the gate isolation. This separates the sides from the active region of the chip so the leakage currents from the side surfaces of the device are blocked. A design of a high power high frequency transformer for the converter topology in the nacelle of the wind turbine is proposed. A design method is used and a program to calculate the necessary values is made. The transformer should be a double E-core with a centre leg of 4. 5 cm made of the ferrite material N 27. Both primary and secondary windings, which will be copper foils, should be wound on the centre leg of the core using a bobbin. The primary windings will be separated in two sections each section having 12 layers with two turns per layer. The secondary windings will be sandwiched between the primary sections and will consist of 24 layers with two turns per layers. Each foil conductor has a height of 4. 5 cm and a thickness of 0. 3165 mm. The new converter topology reduces the converter losses due to fewer converter stages, a new type of reverse-blocking IGBT and a new switching pattern. It also reduces the weight of the converter system because of no capacitors and a <b>lighter</b> <b>transformer.</b> This is important for floating wind turbines. A prototype of the converter topology with protection should be made to verify the results of this thesis. Simulation studies for the whole park during operation and faults should also be carried out to see if the topology fits the harsh conditions offshore. </p...|$|R

There are two major benefits of a wireless intercom system over the traditional wired intercom. The first is that installation is much easier since no wires have to be run between intercom units. The second {{is that you can}} easily move the units at any time. With that convenience and ease of installation comes a risk of interference from other wireless and electrical devices. Nearby wireless devices such as cordless telephones, wireless data networks, and remote audio speakers, as well as structural features in your building, can all interfere. Electrical devices such as motors, <b>lighting</b> fixtures and <b>transformers</b> can cause noise. There may be concerns about privacy since conversations may be picked up on a scanner, baby monitor, cordless phone, or a similar device on the same frequency. Encrypted wireless intercoms can reduce or eliminate privacy risks, while placement, installation, construction, grounding and shielding methods can reduce or eliminate the detrimental effects of external interference. The United States and Canada have several frequency ranges for wireless intercom systems and other wireless products.
