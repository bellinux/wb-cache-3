25|$|The {{additional}} return {{above the}} risk-free {{nominal interest rate}} which is expected from a risky investment is the risk premium. The risk premium an investor requires on an investment depends on the risk preferences of the investor. Evidence suggests that most <b>lenders</b> <b>are</b> risk-averse.|$|E
25|$|Banks {{also earned}} revenue by securitizing debt, {{particularly}} mortgage debt {{prior to the}} financial crisis. Investment banks have become concerned that <b>lenders</b> <b>are</b> securitizing in-house, driving the investment banks to pursue vertical integration by becoming lenders, which is allowed in the United States since {{the repeal of the}} Glass–Steagall Act in 1999.|$|E
25|$|Since <b>lenders</b> <b>are</b> now {{required}} {{to issue a}} standardized GFE in a specific time frame, consumers are provided an opportunity to compare lenders and their products. Further, HUD states that prior to the issuance of a GFE, lenders can only charge potential borrowers a fee to cover {{the expense of a}} credit report. The relative low cost of credit reports ($15–30) results in consumers' ability to comparison shop many lenders at a minimal cost.|$|E

25|$|In many cases, borrowers write a post-dated check (check with {{a future}} date) to the lender; if the borrowers don't {{have enough money}} in their account by the check's date, their check will bounce. In Texas, payday <b>lenders</b> <b>are</b> {{prohibited}} from suing a borrower for theft if the check is post-dated. One payday lender in the state instead gets their customers to write checks dated for the day the loan is given. Customers borrow money because they don't have any, so the lender accepts the check knowing that it would bounce on the check's date. If the borrower fails to pay on the due date, the lender sues the borrower for writing a hot check.|$|E
25|$|India's {{reliance}} on external assistance and concessional debt has decreased since liberalisation of the economy, and the debt service ratio decreased from 35.3% in 1990–91 to 4.4% in 2008–09. In India, external commercial borrowings (ECBs), or commercial loans from non-resident <b>lenders,</b> <b>are</b> being permitted {{by the government}} for providing an additional source of funds to Indian corporates. The Ministry of Finance monitors and regulates them through ECB policy guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) under the Foreign Exchange Management Act of 1999. India's foreign exchange reserves have steadily risen from $5.8billion in March 1991 to $318.6billion in December 2009. In 2012, the United Kingdom announced an end to all financial aid to India, citing the growth and robustness of Indian economy.|$|E

Concerns are increasing about the vast amounts of water used at coal-fired and nuclear power plants, particularly in regions of the country facing water shortages.

25|$|Prior to 2009 {{regulation}} of consumer credit was primarily {{conducted by the}} states and territories. Some states such as New South Wales and Queensland legislated effective annual interest rate caps of 48%. In 2008 the Australian states and territories referred powers of consumer credit to the Commonwealth. In 2009 the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009 (Cth) was introduced, which initially treated payday lenders no differently from all other lenders. In 2013 Parliament tightened regulation on the payday lending further introducing the Consumer Credit and Corporations Legislation Amendment (Enhancements) Act 2012 (Cth) which imposed an effective APR cap of 48% for all consumer credit contracts (inclusive of all fees and charges). Payday lenders who provided a loan falling within {{the definition of a}} small amount credit contract (SACC), defined as a contract provided by a non authorised-deposit taking institution for less than $2,000 for a term between 16 days and 1 year, are permitted to charge a 20% establishment fee in addition to monthly (or part thereof) fee of 4% (effective 48% p.a.). Payday lenders who provide a loan falling within the definition of a medium amount credit contract (MACC), defined as a credit contract provided by a non-deposit taking institution for between $2,000–$5,000 may charge a $400 establishment fee in addition to the statutory interest rate cap of 48%. Payday <b>lenders</b> <b>are</b> still required to comply with Responsible lending obligations applying to all creditors. Unlike other jurisdictions Australian payday lenders providing SACC or MACC products are not required to display their fees as an effective annual interest rate percentage.|$|E

5000|$|A {{leveraged}} lease or leased <b>lender</b> <b>is</b> a lease {{in which}} the lessor puts {{up some of the}} money required to purchase the asset and borrows the rest from a <b>lender.</b> The <b>lender</b> <b>is</b> given a senior secured interest on the asset and an assignment of the lease and lease payments. The lessee typically makes payments directly to the lender as the lease payments are assigned to the lender.|$|R
50|$|In {{corporate}} finance, Structural subordination is {{the concept}} that a lender to a company will {{not have access to}} the assets of the company's subsidiary until after all of the subsidiary's creditors have been paid and the remaining assets have been distributed up to the company as an equity holder. For example, if a lender loans money to a parent company, that <b>lender</b> <b>is</b> structurally subordinated to a lender who loaned money to a subsidiary operating company which is lower down in the company organizational structure. The operating company <b>lender</b> <b>is</b> structurally senior, and the parent company <b>lender</b> can only <b>be</b> repaid from the operating assets after the operating company <b>lender</b> has <b>been</b> repaid.|$|R
2500|$|Payday lenders {{have made}} {{effective}} use of the sovereign status of Native American reservations, often forming partnerships with members of a tribe to offer loans over the Internet which evade state law. However, the Federal Trade Commission has begun the aggressively monitor these lenders as well.

2500|$|Naked {{short selling}} {{is a case}} of short selling without first {{arranging}} a borrow. If the stock is in short supply, finding shares to borrow can be difficult. The seller may also decide not to borrow the shares, in some cases because <b>lenders</b> <b>are</b> not available, or because the costs of lending are too high. [...] When shares are not borrowed within the clearing time period and the short-seller does not tender shares to the buyer, the trade is considered to have [...] "failed to deliver." [...] Nevertheless, the trade will continue to sit open or the buyer may be credited the shares by the DTCC until the short-seller either closes out the position or borrows the shares.|$|E
2500|$|Mezzanine capital {{refers to}} subordinated debt or {{preferred}} equity securities that often represent the most junior {{portion of a}} company's capital structure that is senior to the company's common equity. [...] This form of financing is often used by private equity investors {{to reduce the amount}} of equity capital required to finance a leveraged buyout or major expansion. [...] Mezzanine capital, which is often used by smaller companies that are unable to access the high yield market, allows such companies to borrow additional capital beyond the levels that traditional <b>lenders</b> <b>are</b> willing to provide through bank loans. [...] In compensation for the increased risk, mezzanine debt holders require a higher return for their investment than secured or other more senior lenders. Mezzanine securities are often structured with a current income coupon.|$|E

2500|$|The {{shape of}} the yield curve {{indicates}} the cumulative priorities of all lenders relative to a particular borrower (such as the US Treasury or the Treasury of Japan), or the priorities of a single lender relative to all possible borrowers. With other factors held equal, lenders will prefer to have funds at their disposal, {{rather than at the}} disposal of a third party. The interest rate is the [...] "price" [...] paid to convince them to lend. As the term of the loan increases, lenders demand an increase in the interest received. In addition, lenders may be concerned about future circumstances, e.g. a potential default (or rising rates of inflation), so they demand higher interest rates on long-term loans than they demand on shorter-term loans to compensate for the increased risk. Occasionally, when <b>lenders</b> <b>are</b> seeking long-term debt contracts more aggressively than short-term debt contracts, the yield curve [...] "inverts", with interest rates (yields) being lower for the longer periods of repayment so that lenders can attract long-term borrowing.|$|E
