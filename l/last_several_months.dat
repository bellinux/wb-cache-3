Consumer demand is inelastic and largely insensitive to price change, while sales volumes are generally low. In the shoe polish market as a whole, some 26% of turnover is accounted for by pastes, 24% by creams, 23% by aerosols, and 13% by liquids. In recent years, the demand for shoe polish products has either been static or declined; one reason is the gradual replacement of formal footwear with sneakers for everyday use.|$|E
5|$|The ship {{arrived at}} Pearl on 10 June and {{remained}} {{for several days}} before departing for Bremerton to begin an overhaul scheduled to <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>months.</b> Captain Cassady was relieved by Captain Thomas Sisson on 22 June although he was only briefly in command before Captain Lucian A. Moebus assumed command on 31 July. Saratoga completed her post-refit sea trials on 13 September and arrived at the Naval Air Station Alameda on 16 September to begin loading 85 aircraft, 1500 passengers and cargo bound for Pearl Harbor. She departed San Francisco two days later and arrived on 24 September. The ship was assigned to Carrier Division 11 which was tasked to train night fighter pilots and to develop night tactics and doctrine. Rear Admiral Matthias Gardner made Saratoga his flagship on 10 October. Four days later, the ship was accidentally rammed by her plane guard destroyer , gashing the port side of her hull. Operations were immediately cancelled and she returned to port for temporary repairs. Permanent repairs were made during a brief refit {{during the first week}} of November. Carrier qualification and other training continued through most of January 1945.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{variants}} of Michelson-Morley and Kennedy–Thorndike experiments {{have been conducted}} {{in order to test}} the isotropy of the speed of light.

Laser, maser and optical resonators are used, reducing the possibility of any anisotropy of the speed of light to the 10−17 level. In addition to terrestrial tests, Lunar Laser Ranging Experiments have also been conducted as a variation of the Kennedy-Thorndike-experiment.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms usually {{began to}} appear six to 11 days after initial infection, {{beginning}} with a fever and cough. Most cases reported a progression to a persistent cough, leading to expectoration and sometimes hemoptysis. Worms in the bronchial region can trigger a chronic, nonproductive cough and asthma-like symptoms due to the obstruction of airways by the worms. These symptoms, along with a low-grade fever, can <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>months</b> if not initially diagnosed correctly. A scratching or crawling sensation can be felt in the throat if the worms are attached in the larynx. Weight loss and pneumonitis have been reported as possible long-term consequences, but not anemia.|$|E

Its replacement, Capitol, did little better, and after its cancellation, CBS aligned As the World Turns against One Life to Live and Another World, a configuration that stayed in place until Another Worlds cancellation in 1999. The 1980s saw One Life to Live reach the height of its popularity, with an estimate of 9 million viewers early in the decade. The show typically ranked between the second and the fourth position in the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|The third {{match of}} the night was a clash between the Los Villanos brothers, Villano III, Villano IV, and Villano V and several wrestlers from the La Lagunero area of Mexico, the trio of Dr. Wagner Jr., Blue Panther, and Black Warrior who had {{developed}} a rivalry with the brothers over the <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>months</b> and who would have repeated clashes over the years following the 2000 Sin Piedad show. The fifth match {{of the night}} would see the team of Los Guerreros del Infierno ("The Infernal Warriors"; Rey Bucanero and Último Guerrero) defend their CMLL World Tag Team Championship against the team of El Hijo del Santo and Negro Casas. Hijo del Santo and Negro Casas were the previous holders of the championship, but were forced to vacate the title when Hijo del Santo stopped working for CMLL on a full time basis in mid-2000. Los Guerreros del Infierno had won a tournament for the vacant titles only a month earlier when the two defeated Mr. Niebla and Villano IV at CMLL's Entre Torre Infernal show. Hijo del Santo returned to CMLL during the tournament, immediately challenging the new champions for a title match since they never defeated the duo of Hijo del Santo and Negro Casas for the championship.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the plan}} was brought to a halt {{with the arrival of}} the newly {{designated}} governor, Juan de Ribera. On July 18, 1711, he was officially appointed by the king, but he could only take office when his predecessor's term was over. Prior to arriving to Puerto Rico, Ribea and Enríquez exchanged friendly letters. The privateer lowered his guard, expecting to have a productive relation with the future governor. While exchanging letters, Enríquez spent over 20,000 pieces of eight as gifts and other considerations and even lent his best vessel, La Gloria, so that Ribera could arrive. He also made sure that La Fortaleza was fitted with supplies to <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>months.</b> Ribera arrived to San Juan on December 23, 1713, replacing Danío. Enríquez was confident that with his previous actions he had gained the governor's favor, but noticing that his ship arrived fully loaded likely offered an early warning that the functionary actually intended to compete with him. Ribera had manipulated the privateer, projecting a benign posture to avoid awaking any suspicion. Having spent the two years after being appointed in the adjacent Cumaná and Margarita, the governor had observed the models used in the Americas and established connections, also becoming familiar with Enríquez's own modus operandi. Shortly after taking office, Ribera attempted to eradicate privateering from Puerto Rico for his own benefit. He quickly employed his connections in attempts to take over Enríquez's market. After completing his first term, Danío left his entire fortune in charge of Enríquez, while he returned to Spain. They agreed that the money would be sent there when needed. However, the arrangement was difficult, since the money was filtered by small quantities or failed to arrive at all. Ribera would employ the privateer's own model against him, mimicking several of his tactics, albeit in a more aggressive fashion. Considering Enríquez a direct adversary, the governor intercepted his mail and took over profitable associations.|$|E

In the recollection of Jack Rieley, the Beach Boys' former manager, Wilson feared that what he had accomplished over the <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>months</b> of recording would sound dated to contemporary rock audiences.

500|$|In 1816 Maxwell {{was ordered}} to escort Lord Amherst on a {{diplomatic}} mission to the Jiaqing Emperor of China. Alceste was accompanied by the small sloop HMS Lyra, under Captain Basil Hall, and the East Indiaman General Hewitt, which carried gifts for the Emperor. The small convoy called at Madeira, Rio de Janeiro, Cape Town, Anjere and Batavia, and arrived at Peiho after nearly six months at sea in July. Amherst went ashore with his party, instructing Maxwell {{to meet him at}} Canton once his diplomatic mission was complete. The mission was expected to <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>months,</b> so Maxwell and Hall agreed to use the time to become the first British sailors to explore the Yellow Sea and beyond. Between them, Lyra and Alceste visited the Gulf of Pecheli, the West coast of Korea and the [...] "Loo-Choo" [...] (Ryukyu) Islandsin some cases as the first European ships known to have sailed these waters. During the journey, Maxwell saw the Great Wall of China and discovered serious inaccuracies in the charts of Western Korea, finding it lay 130miles east of its supposed position. The expedition also made the first known British government contacts with both the Koreans and the Ryukyu Islanders, who ignored instructions from Chinese officials not to communicate with the British ships.|$|E
500|$|By April 1853 the {{situation}} had become very acrimonuous. [...] Meinig had been using extracts from the testimonial provided by Bird without permission in order to bolster the Company's, medically largely unsupported, quack advertising claims. Bird threatened a legal injunction but Meinig refused to desist and tried to imply that Bird was benefitting from the publicity. [...] A letter writing campaign by one Dr. McIntyre against the Pulvermacher advertisements led to an exchange of letters in the Association Medical Journal. [...] Bird made plain that he had only ever recommended the chain as a convenient source of electricity and did not support any of the claimed curative powers, most especially those {{that were supposed to}} produce instant results (a typical course of electrotherapy at the time could <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>months).</b> [...] He criticised some of the chains being sold as delivering [...] "too feeble" [...] a current to be of any medical use and pointed out that the proposed procedure of wrapping the device around an affected limb would make it useless since a conductive path through the skin across each cell would prevent a useful voltage being developed at the terminals (Pulvermacher even suggests in his patent that contact with the body generates enough electricity to be effective even without electrolyte). [...] This resulted in the Journal removing the Pulvermacher advertisements from its pages. [...] The Association Medical Journal was quickly followed by the Medical Times and with growing pressure on The Lancet to do the same this pretty much ended professional medical support for the device, {{at least for the time}} being.|$|E

2500|$|The writers {{spent time}} researching local California {{politics}} and attending Los Angeles City Council meetings. Schur said they observed that many community hearings were attended only by those opposed, often angrily, to the proposals under consideration. This fact {{became a major}} component of town hall scenes, and was the basis for the [...] "Canvassing" [...] episode. The writers consulted with real-life government officials such as urban planners and elected officials. Scott Albright, a California city planner, provided direct feedback for the Mark Brendanawicz character, and the inspiration for Ron Swanson's anti-government convictions came from a real-life encounter Schur had in Burbank with a Libertarian government official who admitted, [...] "I don't really believe in the mission of my job." [...] The concept of turning a construction pit into a park was seen as a device to bring all the characters together working toward a common goal.
