A brief assessment shows that the actual average value of water on the Agulhas Plain, as estimated by other studies, is higher than the economic cost of making the water available through alien clearing and restoration.

Excessive rainfall caused extreme events such as five-year floods, torrential floods and flash floods, and extreme tidal backflows have inundated the <b>low-lying</b> <b>coastal</b> <b>area.</b> Uncontrolled population growth in urban areas, poor land use planning, the lack of understanding among city stakeholders and communities about floods and its disaster risk, and {{a poor level of}} knowledge about disaster reduction initiatives and preparedness are the important reasons for the flood events becoming disasters.

40|$|International audienceThis study aims {{to assess}} the {{performance}} of raster-based flood modeling methods on a wide diversity of coastal marshes.

Static methods are applied to 27 marshes showing a wide geomorphological diversity.

On the contrary, these methods overpredict flooded areas for large marshes where the distance between the coastline and the landward boundary of the marsh is large, because the flooding cannot be considered as instantaneous. In this case, semi-dynamic methods based on surge overflowing volume calculations can improve the flooding prediction significantly.

40|$|Indonesian {{region is}} located in the {{interaction}} between three major plates, one of the most active subduction zones. This region has frequent earthquakes and tsunamis. Given its location, Indonesian region is very vulnerable to many disasters, including tsunami. The rapid growth of population in coastal areas makes Indonesia more vulnerable to tsunami occurrence since coastal areas have always been the most preferred location for settlements. This research was conducted in Cilacap Regency, Indonesia which was hit by tsunami on July 17 th, 2006, caused many damages and casualties. In the tsunami mitigation plan, evacuation plays a crucial measure for saving human lives. The primary strategy for saving lives immediately before tsunami waves arrives is to evacuate people from the hazard zone. Especially for communities who are living in a <b>low-lying</b> <b>coastal</b> <b>area.</b> Given their location, {{it would be impossible to}} evacuate these communities in time, which could result in significant loss of life. This research tried to determine the suitable location for vertical evacuation and the capacity of suitable evacuation shelter buildings and also to develop a methodology to choose the most effective evacuation routes. For these purposes, some kind of spatial information are required such as the distribution pattern of settlements and detailed road network, in which for these study, can significantly be supported by using remote sensing technology. This paper will present the results of how remote sensing technologies were used to support provision of spatial information required for tsunami evacuation model in Cilacap, Central Java. * Corresponding Author. 1...|$|E

Soil samples were taken at two depths (0 to 20 and 20 to 40 cm) during 2010 and late 2012. Water quality in a local shallow well was also monitored in 2010 and 2012. High soil salinity was recorded 2 months later than tsunami occurs, closely associated to water-soluble chloride and cations (Cl- >> Na+ >> Ca 2 +> Mg 2 +> K+), ionic toxicities, and vegetal inhibition (Vasconcellea pubescens) by less available water to plants. An initial reduction in soil pH due to ionic strength and coarse-textured class of soil was observed and the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) in soil varied between 5. 7 and 11. 2 (mmol L- 1) (0. 5) showing to be saline. Although SARw values are very high (> 18 (mmol L- 1) 0. 5), it does not exist risks of reduction on soil infiltration rates according to ECw (> 5 dS m(- 1)) obtained. After 2 years, soil salinity was drastically reduced in the affected areas due to high soil permeability and natural attenuation (rainfalls and leaching effects), with sulfate and bicarbonate concentrations showing excessive values. Further, irrigation water quality returned to pre-tsunami situation, with only levels of sodium slightly exceeding desirable range from health point of view. Finally, it is suggested a proper design of irrigation systems before implementing other management practice...|$|E
40|$|Global {{climate change}} is {{expected}} to have negative effects on water resources as a result of increased variability in extreme events such as droughts and floods. Compared with surface water resources, there has been less research into the impacts of climate change on groundwater both in terms of the effects on quantity and quality and also linkages within the hydrological cycle. This paper presents an overview of possible climate change impacts on groundwater using evidence presented at the 1 st Symposium of the UNESCO IHP GRAPHIC project with examples reported from Asia, North America and Pacific Ocean atolls. A further, more detailed case study is presented that uses a numerical groundwater model to investigate the possible impacts of climate change on saline intrusion in a <b>low-lying</b> <b>coastal</b> <b>area</b> in East Anglia. In this example in north east Norfolk, and compared to the 1970 s baseline condition, a rise in sea-level in the 2080 s to an elevation of 57 cm and a 60 % decrease in annual actual groundwater recharge under a Medium-high gas emissions scenario will potentially cause saline water to advance 1700 m further inland into the coastal sand and gravel aquifer. As a consequence of the shallow depth of saline water in the coastal aquifer, the chloride concentration in coastal drains may increase to about 4000 mg/l in the 2080 s. In general, this paper highlights that the impacts of climate change on water resources is specific to geo-climatic regions which only emphasises the future challenges of adapting to climate change. The mitigation and avoidance of these effects is, however, also apparent and include better dissemination of information to water resources managers and local communities and the development of sustainable groundwater abstraction methods...|$|E
40|$|The {{groundwater}} in a shallow, unconfined, low-lying coastal aquifer in Santala, southern Finland, was chemically characterised {{by integrating}} multivariate statistical approaches, {{principal component analysis}} (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), based on the stable isotopes δ 2 H and δ 18 O, hydrogeochemistry and field monitoring data. PCA and HCA yielded similar results and classified groundwater samples into six distinct groups that revealed the factors controlling temporal and spatial variations in the groundwater geochemistry, such as the geology, anthropogenic sources from human activities, climate and surface water. High temporal variation in groundwater chemistry directly corresponded to precipitation. With an increase in precipitation, KMnO 4 consumption, EC, alkalinity and Ca concentrations also increased in most wells, while Fe, Al, Mn and SO 4 were occasionally increased during spring after the snowmelt under specific geological conditions. The continued increase in NO 3 and metal concentrations in groundwater indicates the potential contamination risk to the aquifer. Stable isotopes of δ 18 O and δ 2 H indicate groundwater recharge directly from meteoric water, with an insignificant contribution from lake water, and no seawater intrusion into the aquifer. Groundwater geochemistry suggests that local seawater intrusion is temporarily able {{to take place in}} the sulfate reduction zone along the freshwater and seawater mixed zone in the <b>low-lying</b> <b>coastal</b> <b>area,</b> but the contribution of seawater was found to be very low. The influence of lake water could be observed from higher levels of KMnO 4 consumption in wells near the lake. The integration of PCA and HCA with conventional classification of groundwater types, {{as well as with the}} hydrogeochemical data, provided useful tools to identify the vulnerable groundwater areas representing the impacts of both natural and human activities on water quality and the understanding of complex groundwater flow system for the aquifer vulnerability assessment and groundwater management in the future...|$|E
