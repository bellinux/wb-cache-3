25|$|Deployment of divers from {{a surface}} {{saturation}} complex requires the diver {{to be transferred}} {{under pressure from the}} accommodation area to the underwater workplace. This is generally done by using a closed diving bell, also known as a Personnel Transfer Capsule, which is clamped to the <b>lock</b> <b>flange</b> of the accommodation transfer chamber and the pressure equalized with the accommodation transfer chamber for transfer to the bell. The lock doors can then be opened for the divers to enter the bell. The divers will suit up before entering the bell and complete the pre-dive checks. The pressure in the bell will be adjusted to suit the depth at which the divers will lock out while the bell is being lowered, so that the pressure change can be slow without unduly delaying operations.|$|E
40|$|A {{coupling}} device has a transversely arranged, open-end groove in a flange {{attached to a}} pipe end. The groove in the flange receives a circumferentially arranged <b>locking</b> <b>flange</b> element on the other coupling member and permits alignment of the bores of the coupling members when the <b>locking</b> <b>flange</b> element is in the open end groove. Upon alignment of the bores of the coupling members, a trigger member is activated to automatically release a spring biased tubular member {{in one of the}} coupling members. The tubular member has a conical end which is displaced into the other coupling member to lock the coupling members to one another. A tensioning nut is threadedly movable on a coupling member so as to be moved into tightening engagement with the other coupling member...|$|R
50|$|The mount is a bayonet type, with a 65° {{clockwise}} <b>lock,</b> and a <b>flange</b> {{focal distance}} of 43.5 mm.|$|R
50|$|The flange of {{the mount}} defines the {{positioning}} of the lens relative to the image sensor. A ring is present around the opening on the camera which, when rotated, tightly <b>locks</b> the <b>flange</b> of the lens against the camera. A pin on the top side of the lens flange and {{a hole in the}} camera mount make sure the lens cannot be mounted at an angle.|$|R
40|$|A clamp-mount {{device is}} {{disclosed}} for mounting equipment to an associated I-beam {{and the like}} structural member of the type having oppositely extending flanges wherein the device comprises a base {{and a pair of}} oppositely facing clamping members carried diagonally on the base clamping flanges therebetween and having flange receiving openings facing one another. Lock means are carried diagonally by the base opposite the clamping members <b>locking</b> the <b>flanges</b> in the clamping members. A resilient hub is carried centrally of the base engaging and biasing a back side of the flanges maintaining tightly clamped and facilitating use on vertical as well as horizontal members. The base turns about the hub to receive the flanges within the clamping members. Equipment may be secured to the base by any suitable means such as bolts in openings. Slidable gate latches secure the hinged locks in an upright locking position. The resilient hub includes a recess opening formed in the base and a rubber-like pad carried in this opening being depressably and rotatably carried therein...|$|R
500|$|Also, radius/radii; {{tertiary}} fibres. [...] Also defined herewith: proximal barbules; distal barbules; barbicels; hooklets (hamuli); pennulum; teeth. Just as [...] branch off on parallel {{sides of}} the , the barbs in turn {{have a set of}} structures called barbules, branching from each side of the [...] The base cells of the barbule form a plate from which a thinner stalk projects called the pennulum. At one more level of branching, the pennulum hosts small outgrowths from it called barbicels—which when found on , vary in structure depending on which side of a barb's ramus they project from. Proximal barbules (on the proximal side of the ramus) have ventral projections near the base called teeth, while growing from the pennulum are cilia—simple pointed structures. At the base of the proximal barbule, the [...] "dorsal edge is recurved into a [...] ". The distal barbules (on the distal side of the ramus) have a thicker base with more elaborate teeth, and a longer pennulum with hooklets (also called hamuli) at the end, as well as cilia in greater number than on proximal barbules. The hooklets overlap one to four rows of proximal barbules on the next higher barb, <b>locking</b> into their <b>flanges,</b> thereby giving the [...] structure, strength, flexibility and stability.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to design a tool for moderate cross section reduction of bars that are deformed within a channel slider tool that is used for equal channel angular extrusion (ECAE). The bars that are deformed via ECAE have an initial square cross section with a nominal value of 1. 00 in 2 and aspect ratios (length/width) ranging between 4 and 6. A systems engineering design methodology is used to generate a topbottom approach {{in the development of}} the tool's design. This includes defining a need statement, which is the "Need for an area reduction extrusion tool to replace the current practices of machining ECAE processed billets". The system functions and requirements are defined next and used to generate three concepts that are compared to select the winning concept for further refinement. Major components of the selected tool are: a container, ram, base plate, punch plate, four die-inserts, four wedges and four <b>flange</b> <b>locks.</b> For materials, such as copper (C 10100) and aluminum (Al 6061 -T 6), that can be processed by this tool, the upper bound extrusion pressure, which is derived by limit analysis, is set at 192 ksi. The upper bound extrusion pressure is constrained by the buckling limit of the ram, which is 202 ksi. The maximum wall stress experienced by the container is 113 ksi. For materials with the same cross section and dimensions, fixed end conditions of the Ram support larger bucking loads when compared to other end conditions such as rounded ends or rounded-fixed ends. With the application of the upper bound method, an increase in the extrusion ratio of the tool causes a corresponding rise in the optimal cone angle of the die further translating to a rise in the extrusion pressure...|$|R
