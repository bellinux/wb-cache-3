40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} trans-dental photo-curing {{on the degree of}} conversion (DC) of a resin composite irradiated by a light curing unit operating in different curing modes. Methods: A curing lamp having six different curing modes was used for indirect photo-activation of a Nanocomposite through different thicknesses of tooth tissues. Fourier transformation infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to determine DC. Three main experimental groups were formed in accordance with the 0. 5 mm, 1 mm and 1. 3 mm, tooth thicknesses which were further subdivided into six minor groups formed according to irradiation modes. Control groups employed direct irradiation. Results: For each of the six <b>light</b> curing <b>modes,</b> the average DC decreased with increase in intervening tooth thickness. Among the groups, 0. 5 mm had the highest DC mean values, 21. 5 mm group had the lowest mean values (P< 0. 05). The composite resin showed lower DC mean values when irradiated indirectly compared to control direct curing (P< 0. 05). DC mean values for turbo and high <b>light</b> <b>modes</b> were statistically significantly higher compared to Normal, Soft Start, Pulse and Pulse Soft <b>light</b> <b>modes.</b> Conclusions: A Nano-composite resin cured through different tooth thickness has lower DC compared to direct curing. DC decreases with increasing intervening tooth thickness. DC mean values for turbo and high <b>light</b> <b>modes</b> were statistically higher compared to normal, soft start, pulse and pulse soft <b>light</b> <b>modes...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Besides {{describing}} quantum dynamics, one can naturally {{apply the}} cluster-expansion approach {{to represent the}} quantum distributions.

Alternatively, one can express {{them in terms of}} the expectation-value representation [...] In this case, the connection from [...] to the density matrix is unique but can result in a numerically diverging series. This problem can be solved by introducing a cluster-expansion transformation (CET)that represents the distribution in terms of a Gaussian, defined by the singlet-doublet contributions, multiplied by a polynomial, defined by the higher-order clusters. It turns out that this formulation provides extreme convergence in representation-to-representation transformations.|$|E

The heat from a pilot light in many appliances (furnaces, space heaters, water heaters) is generally released in the same chamber as the primary burner.The energy loss is much smaller for pilot lights in space heaters than other products, because space heaters heat a smaller enclosed space and contribute more significantly to heating the room. The appliance efficiency of a gas fired balanced flue local space heater in pilot <b>light</b> <b>mode</b> is almost equal with the appliance efficiency measured at the reduced power of the appliance, which efficiency is between 65 - 95% based on the low calorific value of the consumed gas, making part of the pilot lights energy consumption into a useful heat.|$|E

The photon exchange between the modes and the atoms occurs around the overlapping nodes of associated standing waves, which generates the two-dimensional (2 D) version of the Optical Stern-Gerlach (OSG) effect. In this optical cross-cavity setup, we show that the discrete signatures of the fields states, left in the momentum distribution of the deflected atoms, may reveal entanglement for a certain class of two-mode states. For a single photon, we present the possibility of quantifying entanglement by {{the rotation of the}} momentum distribution.

50|$|The dance-point {{system uses}} raw step values to {{determine}} the grade. A 'perfect' step adds two points, a 'great' step adds one point, a 'good' step is worth nothing, a 'boo' step takes away four points, and a 'miss' step takes away eight points. An 'O.K.' freeze adds six points, and an 'N.G.' freeze is worth nothing. The dance points are also tied to the life bar. As always, if a player takes too many bad steps and depletes the life bar, they will fail, and the game will end immediately. If the first song is in <b>Light</b> <b>mode,</b> then the game will allow a player to fail that song and continue, but will fail the player out if they fail a second song.

40|$|Quantum {{computers}} promise ultrafast {{performance for}} certain tasks. Experimentally appealing, measurement-based quantum computation requires an entangled resource called a cluster state, with long computations requiring large cluster states. Previously, the largest cluster state consisted of eight photonic qubits or <b>light</b> <b>modes,</b> {{and the largest}} multipartite entangled state of any sort involved 14 trapped ions.

We deterministically generate and fully characterize a continuous-variable cluster state containing more than 10, 000 entangled modes.

The use of immersion fluids can provide better visual effects and improve the diagnostic accuracy of dermoscopic examinations. MethodsFifteen volar melanocytic lesions, including two palmar and 13 plantar lesions, were included in our study. We compared the visual effects of two different immersion fluids as an interface for dermoscopy. Four combinations of immersion fluid (ultrasound jelly or mineral oil) and observation mode (polarized or nonpolarized light) were compared for visual effects during the dermoscopic examination of lesions based on air bubble inclusion and microstructure visibility. ResultsBoth the mineral oil and the ultrasound jelly allowed at least one microstructure to be clearly visible in each image of the acral volar melanocytic lesions examined. All modes of observation achieved acceptable visual effects. The use of mineral oil and the polarized <b>light</b> <b>mode</b> resulted {{in the formation of}} fewer bubbles than the use of mineral oil and the nonpolarized <b>light</b> <b>mode</b> (p <  0. 05). The use of ultrasound jelly and the polarized <b>light</b> <b>mode</b> resulted in significantly better visual effects (p <  0. 05) than that of ultrasound jelly or mineral oil and the nonpolarized <b>light</b> <b>mode.</b> ConclusionThe use of either mineral oil or ultrasound jelly as interface provides acceptable visual effects for the dermoscopic examination of acral volar melanocytic lesions. The use of the polarized <b>light</b> <b>mode</b> reduced the reflection and scattering of light, resulting in better visual effect than that achieved using the nonpolarized <b>light</b> <b>mode.</b> In the early diagnosis of acral melanoma, choosing the appropriate application of immersion fluid and observation mode yields the optimal visual effect...|$|E

40|$|Teleportation {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the communication of quantum information between the nodes of a quantum network and is viewed as an essential ingredient for long-distance Quantum Cryptography. We describe a method to teleport the quantum information carried by a photon in a superposition of a number $d$ of <b>light</b> <b>modes</b> (a "qudit") by the help of $d$ additional photons based on transcription. A qudit encoded into a single excitation of $d$ <b>light</b> <b>modes</b> (in our case Laguerre-Gauss modes which carry orbital angular momentum) is transcribed to $d$ single-rail photonic qubits, which are spatially separated. Each single-rail qubit consists of a superposition of vacuum and a single photon in each one of the modes. After successful teleportation of each of the $d$ single-rail qubits by means of "quantum scissors" they are converted back into a qudit carried by a single photon which completes the teleportation scheme.
