Atangana kept the post {{for six months and}} took up extra duties as a nurse. The colonisers next sent Atangana to Buea to work as an office clerk. At some point between the end of his schooling in Kribi and the end of his service in Victoria, Atangana met Marie Biloa, a woman from a village called Mekumba. Although she was a <b>little</b> <b>older</b> and living as a kept woman by a German functionary, Atangana married her. She would eventually bear him two children: Jean Ndengue and Katerina (or Catherine) Edzimbi.|$|E

25|$|Jack {{has lost}} his {{seafaring}} father on board the Kyleclare, sunk by a U-boat on this same route, and goes to sea to support his family. His innate decency makes him join in this dangerous rescue of members of a navy whom he passionately hates for having killed his father. He comes to see the terrified German survivors not {{as part of a}} vicious murder machine but as shivering, wounded individuals, some <b>little</b> <b>older</b> than him, caught in a war that is not of their own making. The novel is premised around a view that The Kerlogue’s crew obeyed an unwritten code to save any lives they could. In risking their lives, they recognised the drowning Germans not are combatants, but as fellow sailors and honoured what sailors traditionally believe the initials SOS stand for: “Save our Souls”.|$|E

25|$|Plants are {{referred}} to as annuals which live only one year, biennials which live two years, and perennials which live longer than that. The longest-lived perennials, woody-stemmed plants such as trees and bushes, often live for hundreds and even thousands of years (one may question whether or not they may die of old age). A giant sequoia, General Sherman {{is alive and well in}} its third millennium. A Great Basin Bristlecone Pine called Methuselah is 4,848 years old (as of 2017) and the Bristlecone Pine called Prometheus was a <b>little</b> <b>older</b> still, at least 4,844 years (and possibly as old as 5,000 years), when it was cut down in 1964. The oldest known plant (possibly oldest living thing) is a clonal Quaking Aspen (Populus tremuloides) tree colony in the Fishlake National Forest in Utah called Pando at about 80,000 years. Lichen, a symbiotic algae and fungal proto-plant, such as Rhizocarpon geographicum can live upwards of 10,000 years.|$|E
25|$|Reproducing 13 {{watercolour}} and graphite drawings, Bluff Life (1990) {{was produced}} in 1982 during a two-month stay in a lighthouse off the southern coast of Iceland in a town called Dyrhólaey. The series totals of thirteen drawings, all made on note cards. The second book, Folds (1991), {{is a collection of}} photographs documenting extent sheepfolds; a unique indigenous structure found throughout the island. To Place: Verne’s Journey (1995), the fifth in the series, refers to the North Atlantic island where the book Journey to Center of The Earth (1864), by Jules Verne, began. Horn’s volume opens with a series of aerial geographic views of Iceland, continues with multiple images of the island’s geological formations, and concludes with images of crashing waves. A photographic essay, the seventh volume Arctic Circles (1998) records the endless horizon of the North Sea, the feathers of an eider nest, and the rotating beacon of a lighthouse, invoking in form the very circumference of Iceland. Doubt Box (Book IX) (2006) is a collection of cards rather than a bound volume. Printed on both sides, the cards show pictures of glacial water, taxidermied birds, and of the same face, a <b>little</b> <b>older.</b>|$|E

500|$|At the time, Dalhousie {{was a small}} University, {{with only}} 400students, {{and members of the}} {{teaching}} staff had a heavy workload. Howe, at age 23, was <b>little</b> <b>older</b> than some of his students. He had little experience in the field, and on trips outside Halifax, he and his students would solve problems together. Howe's view was that any problem could be solved through common sense and hard work. [...] Howe took his students to the countryside, where they camped, surveying and planning imaginary railroads. His student Denis Stairs, who would go on to lead the Montreal Engineering Company, said of Howe that by the time the camp ended, his students had great respect for him. Student C. J. Mackenzie, who Howe would later appoint to the National Research Council presidency, stated that Howe was not a brilliant lecturer, but that his presentations were always extremely clear. Howe later said of university education, [...] "The worker at college continues to work, and becomes a successful engineer. The shirker continues to shirk, and gets nowhere." [...] In addition to his own work, Howe found time for an active social life in Halifax, and considered marrying the sister of one of his students, but she had another husband in mind.|$|E
500|$|Although Spiritual Machines {{was not as}} {{successful}} as Our Lady Peace's previous three albums, it was highly praised by fans and critics alike as being one of Our Lady Peace's finest releases, and has also been proclaimed as being the height of their artistic creativity. Selena Gomez of the University Star of Texas State University–San Marcos called the album incredible, but {{also pointed out that}} it was a commercial disaster due to it being [...] "flighty and difficult to palate." [...] MacKenzie Wilson of Allmusic gave the album 4 out of 5 stars saying that [...] "They can still deliver pinch-hitting licks and the brash attitude they did when they first formed in 1993, but they are a <b>little</b> <b>older</b> and a little wiser." [...] A review from the Hamilton Spectator noted that the album's concluding tracks [...] "If You Believe" [...] and [...] "The Wonderful Future" [...] demonstrated a particular facility for mixing sonic textures and that there were [...] "actually moments when vocalist Raine Maida varies from his impersonation of a singing head cold." [...] Ashley Bird of Kerrang! noted that the album was packed with crisp, clean songwriting, odd searing post-grunge riffs and Raine Maida's nasal croon. He {{went on to say that}} the song [...] "Life" [...] "is one of the most perfectly weighted slices of pop-rock you'll hear." ...|$|E

500|$|For the {{majority}} of the recordings, Saadiq played most of the instruments, including bass, keyboard, guitar, Mellotron, percussion, and drums, and he also layered each recorded instrumental part afterwards. Brungardt used a Neumann U 47 microphone to record each of Saadiq's instrument parts. Saadiq recorded his vocals on a dynamic microphone alone in the recording studio's control room, an approach encouraged to him earlier in his career by record producer and audio engineer Gerry Brown. According to Brungardt, [...] " [...] voice benefits from a dynamic mic because it tends to give him more bottom and presence. Plus dynamic mics can sound a <b>little</b> <b>older</b> when pushed". With the songs' guitar parts, Brungardt wanted to create additional distortion in order to produce a grittier guitar sound for the songs, a stylistic preference Saadiq and he had acquired from listening to a great deal of indie rock at the time. He applied several techniques to achieve this sound, including increasing the gain on Saadiq's Fender Twin guitar amplifier, using a software plug-in for the recordings in post-production, and re-amping Saadiq's guitar parts. In his interview for EQ Magazine, Brungardt discussed using a Massey TapeHead, one of his preferred plug-ins, in the recording process, stating [...] "I’ll use that {{on a lot of things}} to get a little more grit. It thickens stuff up nicely if you record something that’s a little too bright. I usually go a lot for darker tones when recording and mixing".|$|E
500|$|Analyzing ways {{in which}} Disney's heroines have evolved {{overtime}} due to [...] "the approach to the characterization of the princesses chang" [...] as the characters gradually transformed from passive young women into heroines who [...] "had ambitions and desires aside from finding true love," [...] critics often divide the Disney Princesses into three separate categories and rank Belle among {{the middle of the}} timeline, with Kit Steinkellner of HelloGiggles observing that the character improved upon [...] "the Disney princess archetype" [...] by simultaneously serving as both a [...] "dreamer" [...] and a [...] "doer" [...] in her film, as opposed to exclusively the former. Film historian Paula Sigman Lowery explained to the Daily Express that Belle's personality is a combination of Ariel's spirit and burgeoning independence, and Pocahontas' maturity, while Belle is [...] "a <b>little</b> <b>older</b> [...] and a little further along in their journey towards independence." [...] About.com's David Nusair believes that Belle belongs to a category of Disney Princesses known as [...] "The Lady Vanishes," [...] in which the heroines, in spite of being brave, outspoken and independent, nonetheless [...] "are forced to behave passively as others help them achieve their respective goals." [...] Michelle Munro, writing for Durham College of Applied Arts and Technology, felt that even though Belle shares several traits with her more passive predecessors, the character introduced [...] "new possibilities for princesses." [...] Girls in Capes wrote that Belle pioneered a generation of princesses who taught [...] "about ambition, self-discovery and the pursuit of what we want." [...] Additionally, Belle remains Disney's first and only princess to have hazel eyes.|$|E
500|$|Serving as {{executive}} producers {{in addition to}} writers throughout the entire series, Schooley and McCorkle oversaw the show for its entire duration to maintain consistency. As executive producers, Schooley and McCorkle were mostly involved in the writing process, focusing mainly on plot and dialogue, while storyboarding was chiefly handled by Loter. The writing staff consisted of both Disney Channel employees and freelance writers. Much of the series is based on both Schooley and McCorkle's own experiences growing up as teenagers in high school. Although essentially a comedy series, Schooley and McCorkle also combined elements of adventure, relationships and humor in order to appeal to both boys, who are primarily interested in action, and girls, who are more-so attracted to relationships and character development, aware of [...] "ancient truisms" [...] surrounding the belief that boys are generally less likely to watch a series starring a female lead, while girls seldom exhibit such reservations when the casting situation is reversed. Without alienating younger viewers, to whom the show refuses to [...] "talk down", the writing in Kim Possible is [...] "a <b>little</b> <b>older</b> than" [...] that of traditional Disney animated series. While avoiding adult references, Schooley and McCorkle opted for a fast-paced sitcom-style dialogue and rhythm that attracted adult viewers instead, ultimately resulting in teleplays that were typically five pages longer than traditional Disney Channel scripts. Additionally, the show heavily parodies the popular James Bond films. Kim Possibles showrunners were heavily influenced by Marvel Comics, particularly the Spider-Man, Fantastic Four and X-Men comic book series. One particularly strong influence is found in Dr. Drakken and James Possible's former friendship, whose relationship closely mirrors that of the Fantastic Fours Victor von Doom/Doctor Doom and Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic, respectively.|$|E
