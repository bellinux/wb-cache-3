5|$|Mitchell and Galle sent an {{anonymous}} complaint to the TMB detailing their concerns with Arafiles's care of nine patients in 2008 and 2009. The <b>letter</b> <b>said</b> that the nurses feared {{losing their jobs}} if their identities were revealed {{in connection with the}} complaint. Arafiles became aware of the complaint and spoke to Winkler County Sheriff Robert Roberts, alleging that the complaint amounted to harassment. The TMB issued a copy of the complaint to Roberts with the understanding that it would only be used to investigate criminal activity by Arafiles. Roberts sent the complaint to Arafiles and to WCMH administrator Stan Wiley. As WCMH was a small hospital, details from the letter identified Mitchell and Galle as the sources of the complaint.|$|E
5|$|A 1989 {{document}} generally {{known as}} Aspects of Christian meditation set forth {{the position of}} the Holy See with respect to the differences between Christian and eastern styles of meditation. The document, issued as a letter to all Catholic bishops, stresses the differences between Christian and eastern meditative approaches. It warns of the dangers of attempting to mix Christian meditation with eastern approaches since that could be both confusing and misleading, and may result in the loss of the essential Christocentric nature of Christian meditation. The letter warned that euphoric states obtained through Eastern meditation {{should not be confused with}} prayer or assumed to be signs of the presence of God, a state that should always result in loving service to others. Without these truths, the <b>letter</b> <b>said,</b> meditation, which should be a flight from the self, can degenerate into a form of self-absorption.|$|E

25|$|On 19 August 1998, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, {{chairman}} of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), stated that recently uncovered letters had implicated the British MI5, the American CIA, and then South African intelligence {{services in the}} crash. One TRC <b>letter</b> <b>said</b> that a bomb in the aircraft's wheel bay was set to detonate when the wheels came down for a landing. Tutu {{said that they were}} unable to investigate the truth of the letters or the allegations that South Africa or Western intelligence agencies {{played a role in the}} crash. The British Foreign Office suggested that they may have been created as Soviet misinformation or disinformation.|$|E
25|$|The letter {{condemned}} {{physical and}} verbal violence against homosexual persons, but asserted that condemnation of violence {{did not mean}} that the homosexual orientation was good or neutral or that homosexual sexual acts should be permitted. The letter also said that accepting homosexual acts as morally equivalent to married heterosexual acts was harmful to the family and society and warned bishops to be on guard against, and not to support, Catholic organizations not upholding the Church's doctrine on homosexualitygroups which the <b>letter</b> <b>said</b> were not really Catholic. This alluded to LGBT and LGBT-accepting Catholic groups such as DignityUSA and New Ways Ministry, and which ultimately resulted in the exclusion of Dignity from Church property.|$|E

25|$|The {{first set}} of anthrax letters were postmarked September 18, 2001, exactly {{one week after the}} September 11, 2001 attacks. Five letters are {{believed}} to have been mailed at this time, to ABC News, CBS News, NBC News and the New York Post, all in New York City; and the National Enquirer at American Media, Inc. (AMI) in Boca Raton, Florida. AMI also publishes a tabloid called Sun where Robert Stevens, the first person who died from the mailings, worked. Only the New York Post and NBC News letters were actually found; the existence of the other three letters is inferred from the pattern of infection. The anthrax found in the New York Post letter is reported to have become damp before being discovered. Scientists examining the anthrax from the New York Post <b>letter</b> <b>said</b> it appeared as a coarse brown granular material looking like Purina Dog Chow.|$|E
25|$|Alternative {{theories}} proposed include FBI incompetence, that Syria or Iraq {{directed the}} attacks, or that similar to some 9/11 conspiracy theories the U.S. government knew {{in advance that}} the attacks would occur. Senator Patrick Leahy who is Senate Judiciary Committee chairman and who had received an anthrax-tainted <b>letter,</b> <b>said</b> the FBI has not produced convincing evidence in the case. The Washington Post called for an independent investigation in the case saying that reporters and scientists were poking holes in the case. Had both attacks on the senators succeeded in killing their targets, the result {{would have been a}} Republican majority in the Senate, in the immediate future because of the loss of two Democrats, and in the long term, as the governors of the targets' states would have been likely to name Republican replacements. This suggests that right-wing extremists had an incentive to carry out the attacks.|$|E

The protest <b>letter</b> <b>said</b> that the spotlight on Tel Aviv was part of [...] "the Israeli propaganda machine" [...] because it {{was supported in part by}} funding from the Israeli government and had been described by the Israeli Consul General Amir Gissin as being part of a Brand Israel campaign intended to draw attention away from Israel's conflict with the Palestinians. Other signers included actor Danny Glover, musician David Byrne, journalist John Pilger, and authors Alice Walker, Naomi Klein, and Howard Zinn.|$|E

500|$|Disappointed by Shahrbaraz's failure, Khosrow II sent a {{messenger}} bearing {{a letter to}} Kardarigan, who was the second-in-command of the Sasanian army.

After reading the letter, he offered to show the letter to Shahrbaraz in a meeting at Constantinople. Shahrbaraz accepted his proposal and met Heraclius at Constantinople, where he read the letter and switched over to Heraclius' side. Shahrbaraz then changed {{the contents of the}} letter, making it state that Khosrow II wanted 400 officers killed, ensuring that Kardarigan {{and the rest of the}} army remained loyal to him.|$|E

One read, [...] "Now is the time for every citizen who loves the state of Mississippi to 'Stand up and be counted' before hoodlum white trash brings us to destruction."

500|$|All {{of these}} events led to {{mounting}} speculation about Brown's future as Prime Minister and a possible leadership challenge. However, Brown faced down his critics and was applauded {{at a meeting of}} the Parliamentary Labour Party on 8 June 2009. Brown continued to be unpopular; in September, Britain's biggest selling newspaper The Sun announced that after 12 years of supporting Labour, it would withdraw its support in favour of the Conservatives. A challenge to Brown's leadership was made in January 2010 when Patricia Hewitt and Geoff Hoon wrote to Labour MPs calling for a secret ballot on the issue. Their <b>letter</b> <b>said</b> that the party was [...] "deeply divided" [...] and the issue should be sorted out [...] "once and for all".

On 2 August, a second photographer, Qassim Zain Aldeen was arrested. Several Bahrain-based rights organizations wrote an open letter on 6 August co-signed {{by a number of}} international NGOs asking other international NGOs, mainstream media, Bahrain allies and the United Nations to pay close attention to Bahrain over the next week, especially on 14 August, which they said would likely see the country [...] "come under lockdown".

[...] Chancellor Kohl, commenting on the <b>letter,</b> <b>said</b> that those who signed it [...] "don't {{know a thing about}} Germany and don't want to know." [...] German officials argued that [...] "the whole fuss was cranked up by the Scientologists to achieve what we won't give them: tax-exempt status as a religion. This is intimidation, pure and simple." [...] Officials explained that precisely because of Germany's Nazi past, Germany took a determined stance against all [...] "radical cults and sects, including right-wing Nazi groups", and not just against Scientology. Kohl's Christian Democratic Union party denounced the letter as [...] "absurd" [...] and cited German court rulings stating that Scientology had primarily economic goals and could legitimately be referred to using phrases such as a [...] "contemptuous cartel of oppression".|$|E
500|$|In 2012, {{the council}} of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets {{announced}} its plans to sell another version of Draped Seated Woman 1957–58, a 1.6-tonne bronze sculpture. Moore, a well-known socialist, had sold the sculpture {{at a fraction of}} its market value to the former London County Council on the understanding that it would be displayed in a public space and might enrich the lives of those living in a socially deprived area. Nicknamed Old Flo, it was installed on the Stifford council estate in 1962 but was vandalised and moved to the Yorkshire Sculpture Park in 1997. Tower Hamlets Council later had considered moving Draped Seated Woman to private land in Canary Wharf but instead chose to [...] "explore options" [...] for a sale.

500|$|The NSWCA {{were outraged}} by Lord Harris's letter and convened a special meeting to {{consider}} their response and subsequently had their honorary secretary, Mr J.M. Gibson, write to The Daily Telegraph in reply. [...] Gibson argued that [...] "the misconduct of those who took possession of the wickets has been exaggerated" [...] and that Lord Harris's account was [...] "universally regarded here as both inaccurate and ungenerous." [...] The <b>letter</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "We cannot allow a libel upon the people of New South Wales so utterly unfounded as this to pass without challenge". It went on to accuse Harris of omitting certain facts in his account, which according to the NSWCA, depicted Australia and the cricket authorities in a poor light. These included an accusation that Harris had failed {{to note that the}} NSWCA and the media had immediately and strongly condemned the disturbance and treatment of the English visitors. Gibson also criticised Lord Harris for claiming that Coulthard was [...] "competent", while [...] "admitting 'he had made two mistakes in our innings'", especially as Coulthard's not out ruling against Lord Harris [...] "was openly admitted by his lordship to be a mistake" [...] that favoured the Englishmen. The letter further denied the claim that those who incited the riot were associated with the NSWCA and accused Harris of inflammatory conduct during the disorder.|$|E
