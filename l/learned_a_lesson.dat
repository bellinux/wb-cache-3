500|$|The 479th FG {{converted}} to the P-51 Mustang in mid-September. On his second transition flight, {{at the point}} of touchdown during landing, Olds <b>learned</b> <b>a</b> <b>lesson</b> in [...] "false confidence" [...] when the powerful torque of the single-engined fighter forced him to ground loop after the Mustang veered off the runway. Olds shot down an Fw 190 in his new Scat IV on October 6 during a savage battle near Berlin in which he was nearly shot down by his own wingman. He completed his first combat tour on November 9, 1944, accruing 270 hours of combat time and six kills.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the first}} episode aired, {{journalist}} Patrick Strudwick asked, [...] "Channel 4, why call your new documentary My Transsexual Summer? It sounds like gender tourism, a fun little trip to the other side." [...] Sarah Dean, an entertainment editor for The Huffington Post UK, called the title [...] "sensationalist". Although Sarah Lake of Trans Media Watch found the title contentious, she defended it {{by pointing out that}} transition is a temporary process like coming of age; even so, she believed the title to be [...] "only slightly better" [...] than the [...] "dire and totally inappropriate" [...] working title, Girls Will Be Boys and Boys Will Be Girls. Her overall assessment was that [...] "although the programme makers undeniably made some compromises to draw in viewers, millions will have enjoyed the company of these seven, shared in their lives and <b>learned</b> <b>a</b> <b>lesson</b> in diversity.â€¦ They will now have an entry point to broadening their understanding of the rich and joyful diversity of gender experience, something which has always existed but of which they were previously unaware." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, at the Simpson family's home, Patty {{comes out}} of the closet as a lesbian, saying that she is in love with a pro golfer named Veronica and asking Homer to perform the ceremony. This makes Marge {{extremely}} uncomfortable, even though the evidence was always there. While Homer accepts Patty's sexuality, a furious Marge reveals that she doesn't want her with Veronica and still insists she marries a man. Patty gets angry and points out that Marge acts very [...] "liberal" [...] about the issue but cannot accept her sister's sexuality, and says she hopes to see Marge at her wedding. Before the wedding, Marge accidentally discovers Veronica is actually a man, ironically while Veronica is singing Aerosmith's [...] "Dude (Looks Like a Lady)" [...] while shaving, and because Veronica left the toilet seat up after leaving. Happily she decides to keep quiet about it knowing that Patty will be marrying a man. But Marge is so moved by Patty's heartfelt declaration of love for Veronica during the ceremony that she reveals Veronica's Adam's apple. [...] "Veronica" [...] explains that as the straight Leslie Robin Swisher, he posed as a woman to get onto the LPGA golf tour. He then asks Patty if she'll still marry him, but she declines. Afterwards, Marge reconciles with Patty after telling her that she's <b>learned</b> <b>a</b> <b>lesson</b> and has accepted the fact that Patty's a lesbian; they hug after reconciling. Patty and her other sister, Selma, then go to leave a bag at the airport unattended, as a way to meet security personnel they can date.|$|E

2500|$|In 1983, Irwin {{had another}} close tilt at The Open Championship, but lost by a shot to Tom Watson at Royal Birkdale, after whiffing {{on a tiny}} putt of about an inch, during his third round of play. Irwin said that his mistake, which cost him {{the chance of a}} playoff with Watson, was [...] "a mental lapse" [...] and that he <b>learned</b> <b>a</b> <b>lesson</b> from it, later being very careful on short putts.|$|E
2500|$|Arkansas Republicans {{were eager}} to work with Winthrop Rockefeller on another race for {{governor}} if he could be led to run as a true Republican to help build the party in the state. I liked him personally. He showed me many courtesies, and I still thought [...] {{that he would make}} a good governor and could be elected on the Republican ticket..... He had <b>learned</b> <b>a</b> <b>lesson.</b> And he won his next two races for governor..... His service contributed greatly to the enormous benefits of two-party government in Arkansas.|$|E
2500|$|Also in 1980, Christian critic R. Chris Hassel, Jr. {{offered a}} Christian {{view of the}} play. The {{experience}} of the lovers and that of Bottom (as expressed in his awakening speech) teach them [...] "a new humility, a healthy sense of folly". They realise {{that there are things}} that are true {{despite the fact that they}} can not be seen or understood. They just <b>learned</b> <b>a</b> <b>lesson</b> of faith. Hassel also thought that Theseus' speech on the lunatic, the lover, and the poet is an applause to imagination. But it is also a laughing rejection of futile attempts to perceive, categorise, or express it.|$|E

2500|$|Fukuda's {{announcement}} that Japan would extend generous assistance to African countries {{in spite of}} its tight financial condition is aimed at burnishing Japan's credentials in the international community. [...] Prime Minister Fukuda's speech was designed to strengthen Japan's leadership as host of the G-8 meeting because aid to Africa would be an important item on the meeting's agenda. Another reason for the government's magnanimity is that Japan is trying to strengthen its relations with African countries to win their support for its bid to gain a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. [...] The Japanese government <b>learned</b> <b>a</b> <b>lesson</b> from the failure of its 2005 campaign for permanent membership at the Security Council: Support from African countries, which account for one-fourth of U.N. membership, is construed as indispensable if Japan is to succeed in its bid. [...] In his speech, Fukuda said, [...] "Japan would like to work on U.N. Security Council reform in cooperation with its African friends." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 2006 Liberal {{leadership}} race, Ignatieff {{advocated for}} measures to address climate change, including a carbon tax. During the 2008 federal election Dion's key policy plank was his Green Shift plan, a revenue neutral carbon tax which {{would put a}} price on greenhouse gas emissions while reducing income taxes. The Green Shift had been heavily criticized by the Conservatives and it was believed to have been a significant factor in the party's poor showing in the election. Following the election Ignatieff announced he would not campaign on Dion's Green Shift. In a speech to the Edmonton Chamber of Commerce in February 2009, he said; [...] "You can't win elections if you're adding to the input costs of a farmer putting diesel into his tractor, or you're adding to the input costs of a fisherman putting diesel into his fishing boat, or a trucker transporting goods". He went onto say that; [...] "You've got to work with the grain of Canadians and not against them. I think we <b>learned</b> <b>a</b> <b>lesson</b> in the last election." [...] In November 2009, he announced that a Liberal government would implement an industrial cap-and-trade system to combat climate change.|$|E
