500|$|Under Burton's direction, Broyles wrote another draft, but his {{script was}} {{projected}} at a $200 million budget. Fox {{wanted to cut}} it to $100 million. In August 2000, two months before principal photography, Fox brought Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal for rewrites. Broyles [...] "had a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>respect</b> with the work they [...] did. And to think that given what I'd done and given what Tim wanted, they navigated the right course." [...] One of the considered endings had Leo Davidson crash-landing at Yankee Stadium, witnessing apes playing baseball. Various alternatives were considered before the filmmakers decided on the final one. The production of Planet of the Apes was a difficult experience for Burton. This was largely contributed by Fox's adamant release date (July 2001), which meant that everything from pre-production to editing and visual effects work was rushed.|$|E

He also noted the inexplicable selection of publications for analysis, which included media reports, websites of public organizations and even unidentified persons. At the same time, a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>respected,</b> peer-reviewed work from Russian-language authors was ignored.
