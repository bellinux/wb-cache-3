500|$|Support among {{senators}} for {{the resolution}} came about {{after the release of}} the Kony 2012 video and its subsequent popularity. One of the resolution leaders, Senator Chris Coons, became aware of the situation after his daughters asked him what he was doing to stop Kony and Senator Roy Blunt was informed [...] "at a Missouri caucus in St. Louis when a constituent quizzed him about Kony". One of the co-sponsors of the resolution, Senator Lindsey Graham, stated that, [...] "When you get 100 million Americans <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>something,</b> you will get our attention. This YouTube sensation is gonna help the Congress be more aggressive and will do more to lead to his demise than all other action combined." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kiyohiko Koike for Listenmusic {{felt the}} song was an [...] "aggressive number erupting all the band member's fervour" [...] created by aspects such as the [...] "quick beat, {{growling}} bass line and Ringo's freaky passionate voice". He felt {{the song was}} not a song you could call a single feeling it had an [...] "eccentric spirit of adventure", but praised Sheena {{being used as a}} resource by her bandmates in the production of a song, and felt that the [...] "mental aspects" [...] of the band had evolved. Hot Express reviewer Tetsuo Hiraga praised Sheena's [...] "charming" [...] vocals in the song, and felt as if the song were exploding from every direction. He believed that this [...] "broken" [...] Sheena had not been seen in her previous works before. CDJournal reviewers noted the song's structure, describing it as [...] "developing into a constantly changing song, as if many songs were in a single song." [...] Reviewer Naoko Saito was very positive on the song, praising the [...] "exploding tricky band sound", calling the song [...] "full of thrills and excitement, like <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>something</b> you shouldn't be". What's In? reviewers called the song a [...] "wild rock tune", noting its [...] "bewildering structure".|$|E

6000|$|... "That's {{the last}} thing I remember, {{wondering}} if you would. You seemed such miles and miles away. It was like <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>something</b> in a mist through {{the wrong end of}} a telescope. Oh, Kirk!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Her shiny {{eyes had}} a dry, intense stare, which, missing Razumov, {{gave him an}} absurd notion that she was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>something</b> which was visible to her behind him. He cursed himself for an impressionable fool, and asked with forced calmness-- ...|$|E

60|$|Rollo, {{understanding}} the gesture, {{though not the}} words, turned in the direction that Carlos indicated, and {{saw that there was}} quite a crowd of men, women, and children at the place, all engaged, evidently, in <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>something</b> or other very intently.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{wonderful}} to be <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>something</b> that happened three thousand years ago, isn't it?" [...] said Rilla.

6000|$|The word, for a little, {{held the}} air, {{and he might}} have seemed the while to be looking, by no means dimly now, at all it stood for. But he had in fact been <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>something</b> else. [...] "You leave her here then to die?" ...|$|E
3000|$|... [There’s an] initial bias {{where if}} you’re feeling really low it’s hard {{to jump up}} and <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>something</b> with a clean slate or fresh eyes. So I think there’s some natural spill over there.|$|R
60|$|Gregory rose, {{and passed}} through the door held open. Kitchener {{was sitting at the}} table with Lord Cromer. His keen glance seemed, to Gregory, to take him in from head to foot, and then to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>something</b> far beyond him.|$|R

60|$|The publican {{stood at}} the window {{with his back to}} the bed.

60|$|After {{the first}} burst of his grief was exhausted, he was {{recalled}} to himself by a sensation {{as if some}} change {{had taken place in}} the lighting of the studio.

60|$|Comrade Prebble {{backed the}} {{reluctant}} Mike into a corner, and, like the Ancient Mariner, held {{him with a}} glittering eye. Psmith and Mr Waller, in the opposite corner, were <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>something</b> with their heads close together. Mike definitely abandoned all hope of a rescue from Psmith, and tried to buoy himself up with the reflection that this could not last for ever.|$|E

6000|$|... "Come down--come down!" [...] {{cried the}} painter, {{steadily}} making {{his own way}} down. Rowland saw that as he moved, and even as he selected his foothold and watched his steps, he was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>something</b> {{at the bottom of}} the cliff. This was a great rugged wall which had fallen backward from the perpendicular, and the descent, though difficult, was with care sufficiently practicable.|$|E
60|$|Rollo sat still, {{looking at}} the fire a few minutes, and then {{he thought he would}} go out into the kitchen, and see what Nathan was about. Accordingly, he went into the kitchen.

6000|$|Her heart {{died within}} her. Never had {{she felt so}} utterly strange and far-off.

25|$|The {{spinning}} sensation experienced from BPPV {{is usually}} triggered by {{movement of the}} head, will have a sudden onset, and can last anywhere from {{a few seconds to}} several minutes.

50|$|Joshua goes to Anne-Marie's {{where she}} tends to his wounds.
