UNESCO distinguishes three types of cultural landscape, of which a clearly defined landscape designed and created by man is the most easily identifiable.

40|$|Rates of ice-stream retreat {{over decades}} can be {{determined}} from repeated satellite surveys and over millennia by paleoenvironmental reconstructions. Centennial time scales are an important temporal gap in geological observations of value in process understanding and evaluation of numerical models. We address this temporal gap by developing a 3 ka and 123 km retreat time series for the Irish Sea ice stream (ISIS), a major outlet draining the last British-Irish ice sheet. The Llŷn Peninsula (northwest Wales, UK) contains numerous ice-marginal indicators from which we reconstructed a robust chronological framework of margin oscillations. The <b>landscape</b> <b>documents</b> the retreat of a former marine-terminating ice stream through a topographic constriction, across a reverse bed slope, and across variations in calving margin width. New dating constraints for this sequence were integrated in a Bayesian sequence model to develop a high-resolution ice-retreat chronology. Our results show that retreat of the ISIS during the period 24 – 20 ka displayed centennial-scale oscillatory behavior of the margin despite relatively stable climatic, oceanic, and relative sea-level forcing mechanisms. Faster retreat rates coincided with greater axial trough depths as the ice passed over a reverse bed slope and the calving margin widened (from 65 to 139 km). The geological observations presented here over a 123 -km-long ice-retreat sequence are consistent with theory that marine-based ice can be inherently unstable when passing over a reverse bed slope, but also that wider calving margins lead to much faster ice retreat...|$|R
40|$|Human {{population}} expansion {{has led to}} {{an increase}} in vehicle traffic and therefore vehicle noise. Traffic and traffic noise has been shown to affect avian abundance, breeding success, density and species diversity on the <b>landscape.</b> <b>Documented</b> changes in avian vocalizations due to traffic noise include shifts in amplitude, frequency, rate, timing, and duration of vocalizations along with a number of behavioral adaptations. During the winters of 2011 – 2012 and 2012 – 2013, we recorded and measured the “chick-a-dee” vocalization of Black-capped Chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) and the “po-ta-to-chip” vocalization of American Goldfinches (Spinus tristis) to determine if bird vocalizations near high traffic noise had higher minimum and maximum frequencies than bird vocalizations near low traffic noise. We found that both the Black-capped Chickadee and American Goldfinch vocalizations have a higher minimum frequency near high traffic noise while the maximum frequency showed no change. This suggests that these species will alter the part of their vocalization that is acoustically masked by traffic noise in order to better transmit the vocalization. However, costs of altering vocalizations include the inability to attract a mate, poor vocal performance, not sounding like conspecifics, and being more easily heard by predators. Chickadees also alter how often they vocalize based on their flock composition. Chickadees vocalize more in mixed-species flocks with other satellite members than in flocks that contained juncos or in single-species flocks of chickadees. Also, single species flocks of Black-capped Chickadees tended to be smaller in size and mixed-species flocks of Dark-eyed Juncos plus individual satellite members tended to be larger in size...|$|R

40|$|The {{emerging}} {{field of}} text mining applies methods from data mining and exploratory data analysis to analyzing text collections and to conveying {{information to the}} user in an intuitive manner. Visual, map-like displays provide a powerful and fast medium for portraying information about large collections of text. Relationships between text items and collections, such as similarity, clusters, gaps and outliers can be communicated naturally using spatial relationships, shading, and colors. In the WEBSOM method the self-organizing map (SOM) algorithm is used to automatically organize very large and high-dimensional collections of text documents onto two-dimensional map displays. The map forms a <b>document</b> <b>landscape</b> where similar <b>documents</b> appear {{close to each other}} at points of the regular map grid. The landscape can be labeled with automatically identified descriptive words that convey properties of each area and also act as landmarks during exploration. With the help of an HTML-based interactive tool the ordered landscape can be used in browsing the document collection and in performing searches on the map. An organized map offers an overview of an unknown document collection helping the user in familiarizing herself with the domain. Map displays that are already familiar can be used as visual frames of reference for conveying properties of unknown text items. Static, thematically arranged <b>document</b> <b>landscapes</b> provide meaningful backgrounds for dynamic visualizations of for example time-related properties of the data. Search results can be visualized in the context of related documents. Experiments on document collections of various sizes, text types, and languages show that the WEBSOM method is scalable and generally applicable. Preliminary results in a text retrieval experiment indicate that even when the additional value provided by the visualization is disregarded the document maps perform at least comparably with more conventional retrieval methods. reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Examinations of {{the impact}} of land-use change on {{functional}} diversity link changes in ecological community structure driven by land modification with the consequences for ecosystem function. Yet, most studies have been small-scale, experimental analyses and primarily focussed on plants. There is a lack of research on fauna communities and at large-scales across multiple land uses. We assessed changes in the functional diversity of bird communities across 24 land uses aligned along an intensification gradient. We tested the hypothesis that functional diversity is higher in less intensively used <b>landscapes,</b> <b>documented</b> changes in diversity using four diversity metrics, and examined how functional diversity varied with species richness to identify levels of functional redundancy. Functional diversity, measured using a dendogram-based metric, increased from high to low intensity land uses, but observed values did not differ significantly from randomly-generated expected values. Values for functional evenness and functional divergence did not vary consistently with land-use intensification, although higher than expected values were mostly recorded in high intensity land uses. A total of 16 land uses had lower than expected values for functional dispersion and these were mostly low intensity native vegetation sites. Relations between functional diversity and bird species richness yielded strikingly different patterns for the entire bird community vs. particular functional groups. For all birds and insectivores, functional evenness, divergence and dispersion showed a linear decline with increasing species richness suggesting substantial functional redundancy across communities. However, for nectarivores, frugivores and carnivores, there was a significant hump-shaped or non-significant positive linear relationship between these functional measures and species richness indicating less redundancy. Hump-shaped relationships signify that the most functionally diverse communities occur at intermediate levels of species richness. Interpretations of redundancy thus vary for different functional groups and related ecosystem functions (e. g. pollination), and can be substantially different to relationships involving entire ecological communities...|$|R
40|$|The present-day seabed in {{the eastern}} English Channel is an erosional {{landscape}} dissected by a complicated network of palaeovalleys. The largest of these palaeovalleys has been interpreted {{as the product of}} catastrophic flooding though the Straits of Dover during the Mid Quaternary. Whilst the eastern English Channel is a valuable source of aggregates, little {{attention has been paid to}} the sedimentary record preserved on the continental shelf in terms of its ability to <b>document</b> <b>landscape</b> change throughout the Quaternary. This thesis aims to establish the first stratigraphic model of deposits preserved on the continental shelf {{in the eastern}} English Channel and chronometrically constrain the timing of deposition using Optical Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating. The model will be used as a framework to reconstruct landscape change and address questions regarding the preservation potential of sediments, and the imprint sedimentary processes have on the landscape, in continental shelf settings over glacial-interglacial cycles. The stratigraphic model was constructed through the integration of high resolution mutlibeam bathymetry, shallow sub-surface 2 D seismic profiles, lithological information from vibrocores, and chronometric data obtained through OSL. A variety of drowned landscapes including terrestrial (fluvial and colluvial), coastal and shallow marine, were identified. These <b>landscapes</b> <b>document</b> palaeoenvironmental change on the continental shelf from MIS 6 to MIS 1. The fluvial landscape in the English Channel is dominated by multiple phases of lateral and vertical erosion, primarily in response to changes in sea level, but also as a result of reorganisation of drainage basins and variable discharges due to fluctuating ice margins. Exposure of the continental shelf during cold periods is documented in the form of remnant periglacial deposits and extensive palaeosols. The most volumetrically significant sediments preserved on the continental shelf were deposited in shallow marine and coastal settings. These sediments are typically restricted to palaeovalleys where accommodation created during relative sea-level rise enabled deposition. Elsewhere, sediments are preserved as relict coastal landforms, in particular, as part of an exceptionally rare drowned barrier complex at Hastings Bank. Over multiple sea-level cycles, sediments are recycled by fluvial and marine processes, with the most recent phase of deposition having the greatest preservation potential. Erosional processes have the greatest persistence in the landscape record. However, they create a composite record and distinguishing between different events without a correlative sediment package is problematic. The results presented in this thesis highlight the timing and nature of ‘normal’ sedimentary regimes in a continental shelf setting over multiple glacial-interglacial cycles. Further, they reveal evidence for erosion and deposition by fluvial processes in the Northern Palaeovalley during the last glacial period, thus contradicting an existing hypothesis that states the palaeovalley formed through catastrophic flooding...|$|R
