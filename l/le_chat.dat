25|$|In 1979, Willy DeVille {{took his}} band {{in a new}} {{direction}} and recorded an album in Paris called <b>Le</b> <b>Chat</b> Bleu. For the album, DeVille wrote several songs with Doc Pomus who had previously seen the band play in New York City. DeVille hired Jean Claude Petit to supervise string arrangements, and he dismissed the members of the band except for guitarist Louis X. Erlanger in favor of new musicians: Accordionist Kenny Margolis, Jerry Scheff (bass), Ron Tutt (drums) and, once again, Steve Douglas (saxophone), who also served as producer. Capitol Records was not happy with <b>Le</b> <b>Chat</b> Bleu, believing that American audiences were incapable of listening to songs with accordions and lavish string arrangements; consequently they initially released the album only in Europe, in 1980. However, the album sold impressively in America as an import and Capitol finally released it in the United States later the same year. Ironically, Rolling Stone yearly critic’s poll ranked <b>Le</b> <b>Chat</b> Bleu the fifth best album of 1980, and music historian Glenn A. Baker declared it the tenth best rock album of all time.|$|E

Finally on 19 October 1893 the work was seen at the theatre as <b>Le</b> <b>Chat</b> du diable. For this, Nuitter and Tréfeu reworked their original libretto, and a few movements from the ballet Le Papillon were inserted in the score. It ran for 77 performances that year (with another 11 in early 1894) but then fell into neglect.|$|E

25|$|Cabaret is {{a typical}} form of French musical {{entertainment}} featuring chanson, music, dance, comedy and spectacles. The audience usually sits at tables, often dining or drinking, and performances are sometimes introduced by a master of ceremonies. The first cabaret was opened in 1881 in Montmartre, Paris, by Rodolphe Salis and was called <b>Le</b> <b>Chat</b> Noir (The Black Cat). Built in 1889, Moulin Rouge is famous for the large red windmill on its roof. Other popular French cabarets include the Folies Bergère and Le Lido. Cabarets were a key venue in the careers of many singers such as Mistinguett, Josephine Baker, Charles Trenet and Edith Piaf. More recently, Patricia Kaas embodies {{the revival of the}} French cabaret style.|$|E
25|$|The {{emerging}} modernista {{art world}} gained a center {{with the opening}} of Els Quatre Gats, a bar modeled on <b>Le</b> <b>Chat</b> Noir in Paris. Casas largely financed this bar {{on the ground floor of}} Casa Martí, a building by Architect Josep Puig i Cadafalch in Montsió Street near the center of Barcelona; it opened in June 1897 and lasted for six years (and was later reconstructed in 1978). His partners in the enterprise were Pere Romeu, who largely played host to the bar, as well as Rusiñol and Miquel Utrillo. The bar hosted tertulias and revolving art exhibits, including one of the first one-man shows by Pablo Picasso; the most prominent piece in its permanent collection was a lighthearted Casas self-portrait, depicting him smoking a pipe while pedaling a tandem bicycle with Romeu as his stoker. The original of the paintingor most of it: nearly a third of the canvas was cut away by an intervening owneris now in Barcelona's Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya (MNAC); a creditable reproduction resides in the revived Els Quatre Gats.|$|E

500|$|Le Maître Chat, ou <b>le</b> <b>Chat</b> Botté {{was later}} {{published}} by Barbin in Paris in January 1697 {{in a collection}} of tales called Histoires ou contes du temps passé.

500|$|Jarre {{struggled}} with classical piano studies, although he later changed teachers {{and worked on}} his scales. A more general interest in musical instruments was sparked by his discovery at the Saint-Ouen flea market, where his mother sold antiques, of a Boris Vian trumpet violin. He often accompanied his mother to <b>Le</b> <b>Chat</b> Qui Pêche (The Fishing Cat), a friend's Paris jazz club, where saxophonists Archie Shepp and John Coltrane, and trumpet players Don Cherry and Chet Baker were regular performers. These early jazz experiences suggested to him that music may be [...] "descriptive, without lyrics". He was also influenced {{by the work of}} French artist Pierre Soulages, whose exhibition at the Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris he attended. Soulages' paintings used multiple textured layers, and Jarre realised that [...] "for the first time in music, you could act as a painter with frequencies and sounds." [...] He was also influenced by classical, modernist music; in a 2004 interview for The Guardian, he spoke of the effect that a performance of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring had upon him: ...|$|E
500|$|Perrault's son Pierre Darmancour {{was assumed}} to have been {{responsible}} for the authorship of Histoires with the evidence cited being the book's dedication to Élisabeth Charlotte d'Orléans, the youngest niece of Louis XIV, which was signed [...] "P. Darmancour". Perrault senior, however, was known for some time to have been interested in contes de veille or contes de ma mère l'oye, and in 1693 published a versification of [...] "Les Souhaits Ridicules" [...] and, in 1694, a tale with a Cinderella theme called [...] "Peau d'Ane". Further, a handwritten and illustrated manuscript of five of the tales (including Le Maistre Chat ou <b>le</b> <b>Chat</b> Botté) existed two years before the tale's 1697 Paris publication. Pierre Darmancour was sixteen or seventeen {{years old at the time}} the manuscript was prepared and, as scholars Iona and Peter Opie note, quite unlikely to have been interested in recording fairy tales. Darmancour, who became a soldier, showed no literary inclinations, and, when he died in 1700, his obituary made no mention of any connection with the tales. However, when Perrault senior died in 1703, the newspaper alluded to his being responsible for [...] "La Belle au bois dormant", which the paper had published in 1696.|$|E

500|$|In 1789, Nguyễn Ánh made Duyệt a general. From {{this point}} on, Duyệt {{accompanied}} his master on many military campaigns against the Tây Sơn. Continuous warfare then ensued, mostly centred near Nha Trang and Qui Nhơn {{on the south}} central coast, where the Nguyễn besieged the Tây Sơn's strongholds. In 1801, Duyệt engineered a naval victory in Thị Nại, which {{was a turning point}} of the war and heralded the complete collapse of the Tây Sơn. In the same year, a close colleague, Tong Viet Phuc was killed in battle by the Tây Sơn, leading Duyệt to fly into [...] "an almost insane rage" [...] and start killing every enemy soldier he came across, leading Nguyễn Ánh to rebuke him. Shortly thereafter, Nguyễn Ánh exploited the absence of most of the Tây Sơn's army, which was attempting to recapture Quy Nhon, to lead his army in an attack on Phú Xuân, the capital of the Tây Sơn. However, the Nguyễn encountered heavy resistance from Tây Sơn forces around the Tu Dung sea gate, the entrance into the citadel of Phú Xuân. Seeing that the Nguyễn forces could not breach the defense by frontal attacks, Nguyễn Ánh ordered Duyet to lead a naval division to attack the Tây Sơn defense complex from the rear. Lê Văn Duyệt and his deputy <b>Le</b> <b>Chat</b> then defeated the Tây Sơn army and forced their commander, Prince Consort Nguyen Van Tri, to flee. This paved a way for the Nguyễn to assault the citadel of Phú Xuân.|$|E
