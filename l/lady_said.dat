500|$|The {{installment}} {{was filmed}} {{and set in}} Los Angeles, California, as were all other Awake episodes. During filming of the installment, Isaacs {{thought it would be}} funny to moon down the stairs during a scene in which Hannah and Michael go nude swimming, but stated that it would probably break the Standards and Practices law. Filming of the episode commenced at an actual campus swimming pool for one scene. A lady present during filming asked if Isaacs was naked. Isaacs replied that he was not completely naked, but had a [...] "small piece of material taped over [...] genitals"; the <b>lady</b> <b>said</b> [...] "That's naked," [...] adding [...] "I can see your butt crack." [...] In response, Isaacs [...] "taped a piece of material over [...] butt crack". When the last scene was filmed that day, he ran up the stairs, causing the material—which had been secured only by a piece of sealing tape—to fall off. The woman was [...] "furious". Isaacs thought that the team of Awake would have to withdraw the footage, but was happy to see that part was included in the finished episode.|$|E
2500|$|The other {{contents}} of Bernadette's reported visions were simple {{and focused on}} the need for prayer and penance. On 25 February she explained that the vision had told her [...] "to drink of the water of the spring, to wash in it and to eat the herb that grew there," [...] as an act of penance. To everyone's surprise, the next day the grotto was no longer muddy but clear water flowed. On 2 March, at the thirteenth of the alleged apparitions, Bernadette told her family that the <b>lady</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "a chapel should be built and a procession formed".|$|E
2500|$|Two of the Medjugorje visionaries (on whose {{status in}} the eyes of the Catholic Church see Catholic Church {{response}} to the Medjugorje apparitions) said Maria Valtorta's book had received supernatural approval. Vicka Ivankovic told an American attorney: [...] "Our <b>Lady</b> <b>said</b> if a person wants to know Jesus, he should read THE POEM OF THE MAN-GOD by Maria Valtorta. That book is the truth." [...] Marija Pavlovic, another of the Medjugorje visionaries, said in 1985: [...] "Maria Valtorta! All true. The Poem of the Man-God. The Madonna said two years ago, all true! Dictated by Jesus!" [...] A claim she repeated in 1988. However Fr. Philip Pavich, OFM, an American Croatian Franciscan priest stationed in Medjugorje, sent a circular letter to the Medjugorje fans, questioning the purported visions of Maria Valtorta and the subsequent book.|$|E
60|$|The <b>ladies</b> <b>said</b> they {{supposed}} so, {{and they}} were forced to make what they could of wisdom in which they might certainly have felt a want of finality.|$|R
60|$|These <b>ladies</b> <b>said</b> {{that it was}} not {{necessary}} in regard to Miss Anderson and Miss Van Hook; and as the crowd pushed them on, Dan felt that they had been received with distinction.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is true," [...] the <b>ladies</b> <b>said,</b> in {{one form}} or another, with the tone of conviction; but they were not so deeply {{convinced}} that they did not want a man's opinion, and they all looked at Westover.|$|R
2500|$|In the 20th century, in {{the last}} {{apparition}} of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Fátima, Portugal, Sister Lúcia, {{one of the most}} famous visionaries of Our <b>Lady,</b> <b>said</b> that the Virgin appeared to her as Our Lady of Mount Carmel (holding the Brown Scapular). Many years after, Lúcia became a Carmelite nun. When Sister Lúcia was asked in an interview why the Blessed Virgin appeared as Our Lady of Mount Carmel in her last apparition, she replied: [...] "Because Our Lady wants all to wear the Scapular... The reason for this," [...] she explained, [...] "is that the Scapular is our sign of consecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary". When asked if the Brown Scapular is as necessary to the fulfillment of Our Lady’s requests as the Rosary, Sister Lúcia answered: [...] "The Scapular and the Rosary are inseparable".|$|E
2500|$|There are {{a number}} of legends {{associated}} with the castle, and according to the English Heritage guidebook, it [...] "is reputed {{to be one of the}} most haunted castles in Britain." [...] Two female ghosts are said to haunt the castle: the White Lady, and the Blue Lady. The Blue Lady is said to beckon for help from passers-by, luring them to her tower. [...] If they go to her, it is said they fall to their death. [...] She is thought to have been the daughter of a Norman lord and is said to wander the dungeons mourning the loss of her baby, which she murdered as it was sired by her own father. The White <b>Lady,</b> <b>said</b> to be the spirit of Margaret Pomeroy, is claimed to haunt the dungeons, having been imprisoned there by her sister, Eleanor, who was jealous of her beauty. [...] Their stories often blur together.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ask your pardon, sir. The <b>lady</b> <b>said</b> she {{was aware}} she might be unknown by name. But she begged me to say, sir, that she had {{formerly}} the honour of being acquainted with Miss Dorrit. The <b>lady</b> <b>said,</b> sir, the youngest Miss Dorrit.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You look pale, Amelie," [...] one of {{the other}} <b>ladies</b> <b>said</b> as they {{gathered}} in a group for a moment before proceeding to their respective apartments, where they were supposed to pass the afternoon in working, reading, and meditation.|$|R

6000|$|There is {{something}} magnificent about going up these mountains, appalling {{as it seems}} to one's nerves, at particular turns and angles of the road, where the mule stops you on the very [...] "brink of forever," [...] as one of the <b>ladies</b> <b>said.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Then {{when they}} were come to her the <b>lady</b> <b>said</b> to the damsel, [...] "Didst thou use that balm as I told thee to do?" [...] And the damsel said, [...] "Yea." [...] The <b>lady</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "How much didst thou use thereof?" [...] And the damsel said, [...] "I used it all." ...|$|E
60|$|And the Sea <b>Lady</b> <b>said</b> {{they were}} very pretty--especially the {{cultivated}} sorts....|$|E
60|$|GEOFFREY Oh, Lord! That's {{what the}} <b>lady</b> <b>said</b> who had buried seven.|$|E
60|$|The <b>ladies</b> <b>said</b> {{they were}} waiting for their carriage, which they had left at a certain point when they went to look at the fall, and had ordered to take them up at the inn. They talked about people and things that Kitty had never heard of.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then Gregory {{has been}} dead {{eighteen}} years!" [...] the elder of the <b>ladies</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "We have always hoped {{that he would be}} alive, in one of the colonies, and that sooner or later he would see the advertisement that had been put in the papers." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Lady</b> Constantine <b>said,</b> 'Hush!' {{and pointed}} inquiringly upward.|$|R
60|$|The <b>lady</b> <b>said</b> nothing, and {{the child}} turned her face to me again.|$|E
60|$|The <b>lady</b> <b>said,</b> 'O, you droll monster!' as {{she smiled}} and watched him stride ahead.|$|E
60|$|This {{looked very}} like a dead-lock. My <b>lady</b> <b>said</b> so, in choicer {{language}} than mine.|$|E
6000|$|All the <b>ladies</b> <b>said</b> with bated breath, [...] "O, look there!" [...] and Lucetta {{was ready}} to faint. Elizabeth-Jane peeped through the {{shoulders}} of those in front, saw what it was, and was terrified; and then her interest in the spectacle as a strange phenomenon {{got the better of}} her fear.|$|R
60|$|After a few days, the <b>ladies</b> <b>said</b> {{they wished}} to go home again. The gazelle begged them hard to stay, but finding they would not, it brought many gifts, and gave some to the ladies and some to their slaves. And they all thought the gazelle greater a {{thousand}} times than its master, Sultan Darai.|$|R
60|$|Still the <b>ladies</b> <b>said</b> nothing, {{but there}} was a storm-signal hoisted in Mrs. Bunnett's cheek, which boded no good to her husband. There was room only for one trunk in the state-room, and by prompt generalship Mrs. Fillson got hers in first. Having seen it safe she went up on deck for a look round.|$|R
60|$|Gons. Pr'ythee, do not flatter me; I am a villain; That admirable <b>lady</b> <b>said</b> I was.|$|E

60|$|The <b>lady</b> <b>said,</b> in a mournful tone, {{that she}} could not get up, and that she had no {{appetite}} for dinner.|$|E
60|$|But the {{prestige}} of the Griffiths diminished. Everyone in Blackstable {{came to the conclusion that}} the new Lady Ously-Farrowham had been very badly treated by her relatives, and many young <b>ladies</b> <b>said</b> they would have done just the same in her place. Also Mrs Gray induced her husband to ask Griffith to resign his churchwardenship.|$|R

6000|$|Sobs {{only for}} awhile were heard; [...] At length the <b>ladies</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "My, love, you have {{reminded}} us [...] Of our loved and early dead; [...] But this {{you could not}} know, my dear, [...] And it indeed is true; [...] We are all near to Death's dark door, [...] Even little girls like you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What, dollars?" [...] the <b>lady</b> <b>said,</b> {{smiling and}} accentuating the tip-tilted nose a little more. [...] "Oh, Mr. Porter, it ain't good enough!" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{voice of}} the second speaker seemed to affect the {{listener}} greatly. After a pause, the <b>lady</b> <b>said,</b> 'Very well, I will see him.' ...|$|E
