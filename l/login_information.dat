2500|$|Rep. Mary Bono Mack of the United States Congress {{commented on}} the {{incident}}, [...] "How many times {{is this going to}} happen before Congress finally wakes up and takes action? This latest incident once again brings into sharp focus the need to pass data protection legislation." [...] Senator Patrick Leahy said, [...] "Reports of another major data breach should give pause to American consumers who, now more than ever, share sensitive personal information in their online transactions and networking... Congress should make comprehensive data privacy and cybercrime legislation a top priority." [...] Marcus Carey, a security researcher for Rapid7, said that the hackers had penetrated the databases of LinkedIn in the preceding days. He expressed concerns that they may have had access to the website even after the attack. Michael Aronowitz, Vice President of Saveology said, [...] "Everyday hundreds of sites are hacked and personal information is obtained. Stealing <b>login</b> <b>information</b> from one account can easily be used to access other accounts, which can hold personal and financial information." [...] Security experts indicated that the stolen passwords were encrypted {{in a way that was}} fairly easy to decrypt, which was one of the reasons for the data breach. Katie Szpyrka, a long time user of LinkedIn from Illinois, United States, filed a $5 million lawsuit against LinkedIn, complaining that the company did not keep their promises to secure connections and databases. Erin O’Harra, a spokeswoman working for LinkedIn, when asked about the lawsuit, said that lawyers were looking to take advantage of that situation to again propose the bills SOPA and PIPA in the United States Congress. [...] An amended complaint was filed on Nov. 26, 2012 on behalf of Szpyrka and another premium LinkedIn user from Virginia, United States, named Khalilah Gilmore–Wright, as class representatives for all LinkedIn users who were affected by the breach. [...] The lawsuit sought injunctive and other equitable relief, as well as restitution and damages for the plaintiffs and members of the class.|$|E

It is useful to improve the security of the login process.

In our technique, a smart device pre-stores feature <b>information</b> of <b>Login</b> User Interface. Before entering authentication information, a plug-in of Web browser at host side will verify the validation of Login Inter face according to pre-stored <b>Login</b> Interface <b>information.</b> Wi-Fi provides a communication channel between the plug-in and the smart device. Furthermore, the smart device can automatically fill the field of user id and password to the Login User Interface if Login User Interface passes the verification of smart mobile device.

Because of the increasing number of students, PESMA should increase the facilities. Internet is very important for staff and students. Staff accesses the internet to manage the data. Student accesses the internet to find and access the information and journal. Single Sign On (SSO) is a system which facilitates a user account for accessing the data in servers. This method is implementation at PESMA KH Mas Mansur UMS which integrate between information system and hotspot. Install and configuration SSO server, configuration router hotspot. Student doesn’t need to memorize many usernames and passwords, eases data processing. If each server has user data, then the user data processing (add, delete, edit) should be done in every server. By using SSO, only need one time process. The SSO implementation helps student for using information system and hotspot access with one account login that has been registered and helps administrator to organize data about user who access system. It is caused by the use of LDAP as single user data. Furthermore data is stored centrally in one server.

It is also trivially easy to manipulate into loading an attack page which could steal a student’s CWU <b>login</b> credentials. The <b>information</b> collected by such an attack would give the attacker access to the student’s Novell, Safari and GroupWise accounts. This would allow them to: view the student’s name, address, telephone number, and any other contact information which they had on file in Safari. The attacker could alter a compromised student’s course registrations; financial aid acceptance; send email messages {{as though they were}} the student; or use the school network for nefarious purposes which would then {{be traced back to the}} compromised student’s account. Further, since an attacker would have access to the student’s GroupWise email account, they would be able to compromise any accounts on services for which the student had used their cwu. edu email address as a password reset contact. This could include, bank, credit card, online bill payment, social networking, job search sites, or even additional email accounts from other providers.
