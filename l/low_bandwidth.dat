5|$|A hub is able {{to support}} <b>low</b> <b>bandwidth</b> devices mixed with other speed device via a special PID value, PRE. This is {{required}} as a USB hub functions as a very simple repeater, broadcasting the host message to all connected devices regardless if the packet was for it or not. This means in a mixed speed environment, {{there is a potential}} danger that a low speed will misinterpret a high or full speed signal from the host.|$|E

The <b>low</b> <b>bandwidth</b> requirements also allow for satellite technology to receive telemetry data at a moderately higher cost, but across a global coverage area and into very remote locations not covered well by terrestrial radio or public carriers.|$|E

TCP/IP networking allowed most of the remaining BBSes to evolve and include Internet hosting capabilities. Recent BBS software, such as Synchronet, Mystic BBS, EleBBS, DOC or Wildcat! BBS, provide access using the Telnet protocol rather than dialup, or by using legacy DOS-based BBS software with a FOSSIL-to-Telnet redirector such as NetFoss.|$|E

These included a standard 64kbit/s MP3, a low-bandwidth 16kbit/s MP3, Advanced Audio Coding (AAC), and open source Ogg Vorbis. However, the Ogg Vorbis version of the show ceased to be offered in August 2009 with the AAC and <b>low</b> <b>bandwidth</b> MP3 versions ending in early November 2009. In response, Leo Laporte stated that he was a believer that his content should be made available to the widest audience possible in the format of their choice, as well as philosophically agreeing with the open source nature of Ogg Vorbis. However the time and effort the TWiT Staff needed to encode, upload, and distribute alternate audio formats in the limited time between recording and release each Sunday evening was not justified by the number of people choosing to listen to them.|$|E

40|$|As the Internet and {{wireless}} networks are developed rapidly, the demand of communicating anywhere, anytime on any device emerges. However, {{most of the}} current wireless networks still work in <b>low</b> <b>bandwidths,</b> and mobile devices still suffer from weak computational power, short battery lifetime and limited display capability. We developed portrait video phone systems that can run on PCs and Pocket PCs at very low bit rates through the Internet. The core technology that portrait video phones employ is the so-called portrait video (or bi-level video) codec. Portrait video codec first converts a full-color video into a black/white image sequence and then compresses it into a black/white portraitlike video. Portrait video possesses clearer shape, smoother motion, shorter initial latency, and cheaper computational cost than MPEG 2, MPEG 4 and H. 263 for <b>low</b> <b>bandwidths.</b> Typically the portrait video phone provides QCIF-size video with a frame rate of 5 - 15 fps for a 9. 6 Kbps video bandwidth. The portrait video is so small that it can even be transmitted through an HTTP proxy as text. Experiments show that the portrait video phones work well on ordinary GSM wireless telecommunication networks...|$|R
