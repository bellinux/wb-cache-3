The rocket is released from the <b>linear</b> <b>launcher</b> just after it gets to a peak speed of about 900 km/h, and flies out the guide tube to obtain the speed of 700 km/h at the height of 100 m above the ground. The <b>linear</b> <b>launcher</b> is brought to a stop at the ground surface by a quick control of deceleration. It has been found from the numerical simulation in attractive-mode that the four-pole superconducting LSM launcher system proposed here enables the armature current to decrease remarkably by 40...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- To {{reduce the}} cost of {{launching}} rocket, various researches are performed. A new vertical-type linear synchronous motor rocket launcher system is proposed by the first author Yoshida. The <b>linear</b> <b>launcher</b> is accelerated to a peak speed with loading the rocket, and after releasing the rocket, it is decelerated with no-load to be brought to rest at the upper end of underground guide tube near the earth surface. After the rocket is released from the launcher and takes off with a high initial-speed, the rocket continues to ascend with no control subject to the Coriolis force in the guide-direction under the force of gravity in the rise-direction. This paper presents the rocket launching numerical simulation in vertical- type PM LSM rocket launcher system including rotational motion control. We have verified the stability of rolling, pitching and yawing motion control by the simulation results in a small experimental model on the ground...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this article, we {{consider}} the case where a regulated output of an uncertain system with unknown disturbance input is constrained to lie between two specified time-varying bounds. We suppose a controller has already been designed using any desired technique. This controller may not satisfy expected output constraints. The objective is to design saturations on the control signal so that the closed-loop is altered only when those specifications are not met. The theory {{is presented in the}} linear case with linear dependence on an unknown disturbance. Application to an uncertain <b>launcher</b> <b>linear</b> model with unknown wind disturbance is presented...|$|R
40|$|Advances in ultra {{high speed}} <b>linear</b> {{induction}} electromagnetic <b>launchers</b> {{over the past}} decade have focused on magnetic compensation of the exit and entry-edge transient flux wave to produce efficient and compact linear electric machinery. The paper discusses two approaches to edge compensation in long-stator induction catapults with typical end speeds of 150 to 1, 500 m/s. In classical linear induction machines, the exit-edge effect is manifest as two auxiliary traveling waves that produce a magnetic drag on the projectile and a loss of magnetic flux over the main surface of the machine. In the new design for the Stator Compensated Induction Machine (SCIM) high velocity launcher, the exit-edge effect is nulled by a dual wavelength machine or alternately the airgap flux is peaked at a location prior to the exit edge. A four (4) stage LIM catapult is presently being constructed for 180 m/s end speed operation using double-sided longitudinal flux machines. Advanced exit and entry edge compensation is being used to maximize system efficiency, and minimize stray heating of the reaction armature. Each stage will output approximately 60 kN of force and produce over 500 G s of acceleration on the armature. The advantage of this design is there is no ablation to the projectile and no sliding contacts, allowing repeated firing of the launcher without maintenance of any sort. The paper shows results of a parametric study for 500 m/s and 1, 500 m/s <b>linear</b> induction <b>launchers</b> incorporating two of the latest compensation techniques for an air-core stator primary and an iron-core primary winding. Typical thrust densities for these machines are in the range of 150 kN/sq. m. to 225 kN/sq. m. and these compete favorably with permanent magnet linear synchronous machines. The operational advantages of the high speed SCIM launcher are shown by eliminating the need for pole-angle position sensors as would be required by synchronous systems. The stator power factor is also improved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- Considering the {{transitory}} {{character of}} its operation, the <b>linear</b> induction <b>launcher</b> has dynamic performances {{such as the}} propulsion force and the projectile velocity which are significantly dependent not only on its geometrical dimensions but also on its feeding. In this paper, {{the effect of the}} latter, which is undoubtedly of capital importance, on the performances of the device is studied thanks to a model obtained by an analytical method called the coupled circuits method which we implemented. Our study related to two different prototypes. The first is a low speed laboratory prototype which comprises only one section of inductive reels and which was used to us as practical model on which tests were carried out for the validation of the adopted method. Let us note that the results obtained with these tests are given in this present paper. As for the second prototype, of which the geometrical data are fixed by holding account of the study undertaken on the first prototype, it comprises two sections of inductive reels. It is used as model of simulation in order to meter in obviousness the influence of the mode of feeding on the dynamic behavior of the projectile during its evolution within the sections of the launcher and {{at the time of its}} transition from the first section to the second section...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{accelerating}} payloads by electromagnetic fields in space needs lots of fundamental research and is by best available technologies today not feasible without {{a process of}} research and development of ten/twenty years. After the first study the concept was changed from an antipodal satellite accelerator to a stationary launcher in the space, so the complexity of the requirement that the satellites meet in different orbits for many times is reduced one launch from one orbit into another. The system requires transporting a heavy mass for space application for example possibility to launch small missions to Moon and beyond, a high efficiency of the process additional high force in a short time, possibility to control automatically and be an independent system without support from the Earth. These requirements contain a safe and proved system, where guesses should be avoided. The acceleration by an electromagnetic field to compete with chemical propulsion gives many advantages, but there are negative aspects which make it difficult to realize a stationary launcher in space. For example electrical propulsion has no limitation in velocity (only in range of speed of light) like chemical propulsion, but they need a higher energy density and strain the material and components more in different aspects like mechanical, thermal and electromagnetic stress. So this defines a new limitation and also the structure, design and behavior is more complex than chemical propulsions. There exist many assumptions and con-cepts about electromagnetic <b>launchers</b> for example <b>Linear</b> Induction <b>Launchers</b> (LIL), but they are only proved by experiments for low masses. The most difficult and elusive point is to connect all parts in an optimal way together like geometrical parameters, synchronization, switching, circuits, power supply, pulse induction time and consider all factors of influence like mutual inductance, material parameters, heat radiation, coaxial movement and tolerance. Therefore it is necessary to research and develop in electromagnetic technologies to allow concepts as described within this report for being feasible in next decades...|$|R
40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{assessed}} {{the ability of}} hockey helmets to protect against falls and collisions, yet none have addressed the injury risk associated with puck impacts. Thus, {{the purpose of this}} study was to document the capacity of a typical vinyl nitrile ice hockey helmet to reduce head accelerations and brain deformation caused by a puck impact. A bare and a helmeted Hybrid III male 50 th percentile headform was struck with a puck three times to the forehead at 17, 23, 29, 35, and 41 m/s using a pneumatic puck <b>launcher.</b> <b>Linear</b> and rotational accelerations were captured using accelerometers fitted in the headform and used as input in the University College Dublin Brain Trauma Model to obtain brain deformation. The helmet reduced peak resultant linear acceleration, peak resultant rotational acceleration, and maximum principal strain, but a comparison with published brain injury risk curves shows that it did not reduce the concussion risk below 50 % for impacts at or above 23 m/s. Thus, a vinyl nitrile ice hockey helmet can protect players from direct puck impacts in amateur and youth leagues but may not be adequate in competitive elite leagues, where the puck can be shot at velocities well above 23 m/s. Furthermore, competitive adult male ice hockey players struck to the helmet by a puck may need to consider changing their helmet, as it was shown that direct impacts at or above 35 m/s decreased the helmet’s ability to reduce head peak linear acceleration in subsequent impacts...|$|R
