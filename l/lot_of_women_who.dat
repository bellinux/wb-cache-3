There was a yellow-haired lady manageress who never heard you when you spoke to her, 'cause she was always trying to hear what some seedy old fool would be whispering to her across the counter. Then there were waitresses, and their notion of waiting was to spend an hour talking to a twopenny cup of coffee, and to look haughty and insulted whenever anybody as really wanted something ventured to ask for it. A frizzle-haired cashier used to make love all day out of her pigeon-hole with the two box-office boys from the Oxford Music Hall, who took it turn and turn about. Sometimes she'd leave off to take a customer's money, and sometimes she wouldn't. I've been to some rummy places in my time; and a waiter ain't the blind owl as he's supposed to be. But never in my life have I seen so much love-making, not all at once, as used to go on in that place. It was a dismal, gloomy sort of hole, and spoony couples seemed to scent it out by instinct, and would spend hours there over a pot of tea and assorted pastry.

[...] Although the album is called No Boys Allowed, Hilson told Lisa Binkert of Billboard magazine that [...] "I have all male features on the album, but they're all men. Not boys ...

I wanted men to come and sound off." [...] Hilson has stated in {{an interview}} with Perez Hilton that the album's title actually means, No Bullshit Allowed. She released a statement on her website about the title saying, [...] "it's not about excluding men. It's more about women understanding that there comes a time in your life when you want a man.

40|$|Leadership {{of women}} in islam is still a {{controversial}} issue.

Third, the texts of the Qur‟an (QS. 4 : 34) which indicates the primacy of men become the leader and prophet Muhammad hadits narrated by Abi Bakrah Companions who outwardly show that a people will not prosper if it is led by a women. Would however, some experts scholars allow it. From this views of scholars, will bring up a dialectic on the views of the scholars in Indonesia. For example in this context Majlis Ulama Indonesia (MUI), Ormas Muhammadiyah, and Nahdlatul Ulama as a spectrum of institutions into various ORMAS emphasizes the contextuality and does not apply to an harfiah understanding. Here the condition of women at the time (at the time of the prophet) has not allowed them to handle public affairs, because of lack of knowledge and experience.

How does the concept of the future of women judges offered in deciding a criminal case? The method used in this study is a socio-historical method, and seeks to reconstruct istidlal or legal istinbath used MUI, Muhammadiyah and Nahdlatul Ulama systematically and objectively by collecting data and evaluating and mensistensikan proposition that will be used by the MUI, Muhammadiyah and Nahdlatul Ulama, in order to obtain a final conclusion in the context of the discourse ness.

For {{the first time in}} international legal history, ‘forced marriage ’ is being prosecuted as a ‘crime against humanity ’ in Sierra Leone’s post-conflict ‘Special Court’. This represents an important step in advancing the human rights of girls, and follows a growing trend in international criminal prosecution of gender offences. Notwith-standing the significance of this indictment, international law is no panacea for the deeper inequalities and vulnerabilities that girls experience in peacetime and in wartime.

40|$|Background and {{objectives}} of my research In recent years, the populations of urban areas have grown. Africa, in particular, has experienced rapid growth in its urban populations and this trend has included Burkina Faso (Beauchemin & Schoumaker, 2005; Jeune, Piche & Poirier 2004). A growing {{number of women in}} Burkina Faso have been migrating from rural to urban areas in recent years (Jeune, Piche & Poirier, 2004), due, in part, to increased economic autonomy and education among women (Oppong, 1983; Adepoju, 1995). It has been reported that 40 % of the women who have migrated from rural to urban areas are 20 to 24 years of age, educated, and planning to obtain additional education or jobs in the urban areas (Adepoju 1995). However, in the village of Passakongo, which places in northwest of Burkina Faso, there is not a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> migrate to urban areas. To reflect of this situation, there might be a lot of reasons for this. By the way, there are 13 female mutual help associations in this village. This number is more than that of male mutual help associations. For example, one of the female associations owns 2 of 1 ha. vegetable garden. If she becomes a member and pays membership fees every each months, she can grow vegetables there and consume or sell as she wants to do. And other activities of the association are commerce of sorghum, Rotating Credit and so on. These activities seem to help women’s activities of earning. Furthermore, it is presumed that these active activities of the female mutual help associations affect the low numbered people of migrating to the urban areas from this village. Therefore, in this research, I investigate the livelihood and husbandry of woman. Besides, conducting an investigation of all the female mutual help association in Passakongo village, I develop the feature of those groups such as activities and members. After all, I will reveal the role of female mutual help association to women life in rural area of Burkina Faso...|$|E

Grandsons were all very well, but he wanted his soup at midday. When shown the babies, he stared at them with a fixed gaze, and muttered something like: [...] "It's too much." [...] Whether he meant too much happiness, or simply commented upon the number of his descendants, it is impossible to say. He looked offended--as far as his old wooden face could express anything; and for days afterwards could be seen, almost any time of the day, sitting at the gate, with his nose over his knees, a pipe between his gums, and gathered up into a kind of raging concentrated sulkiness. Once he spoke to his son, alluding to the newcomers with a groan: [...] "They will quarrel over the land." [...] "Don't bother about that, father," [...] answered Jean-Pierre, stolidly, and passed, bent double, towing a recalcitrant cow over his shoulder.|$|R

For myself, [...] I don't care a button {{whether or not there}} are any servants at all; [...] but I know well that you won't come till you have made your [...] arrangements regarding them! Another thing, Aunt Janet. You must [...] not be killed with work here, and it is all so vast [...] . Why can't [...] you get some sort of secretary who will write your letters and do all [...] that sort of thing for you? I know you won't have a man secretary; [...] but there are <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> now <b>who</b> can write shorthand and [...] typewrite. You could doubtless get one in the clan--someone with a [...] desire to better herself. I know you would make her happy here. If [...] she is not too young, all the better; she will have learned to hold [...] her tongue and mind her own business, and not be too inquisitive. [...] That would be a nuisance when we are finding our way about in a new [...] country and trying to reconcile all sorts of opposites in a whole new [...] country with new people, whom at first we shan't understand, and who [...] certainly won't understand us; where every man carries a gun with as [...] little thought of it as he has of buttons!

2500|$|Vanessa {{was created}} in 2009 by Holby City {{executive}} producer Tony McHale, {{as a replacement for}} former CEO Jayne Grayson (Stella Gonet), who departed from the show during its eleventh series. It was first announced on 18 May 2009 that actress Leslie Ash had been cast in the role, after a five-year break from acting due to complications arising from MSSA. Ash commented that the role was the first she had had to audition for since the age of nineteen, and although nervous: [...] "I am so pleased and happy they've given me this chance. They are very brave to have taken on a disabled actress. I can't wait to be back on set. It's the last piece of the jigsaw in my recovery. I'm finally back to where I was." [...] McHale commented: [...] "We're thrilled to have Leslie join us at Holby. We know she's going to be a terrific asset to the show and her character will bring another dimension to our already strong cast. Her stories are going to have our viewers guessing all the way." [...] Her first scenes were filmed in June 2009, for broadcast in October 2009. Asked how long she saw herself staying in Holby City, Ash replied: [...] "At the moment I’m really happy, so as long as they want me! I want it to go well so I can stay on. Also, I know there are <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> out there <b>who</b> love this show and I don’t want them to be disappointed. I want them to say, 'She looks great!'".|$|R

This study provides a recommendation for both central and local governments (especially in East Java) to accomodate reproductive health services for women with disabilities. Since The Convention {{on the rights of}} persons with disabilities through the Law no. 19 in 2011, the government have not taken any significant action. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a more implementative model policy for the community. The purpose of this research acts as a reference to make an effective, efficient, and right-on-target reproductive health policy. The recommendation made in this study {{is expected to be a}} reference for various parties, including the government, in order to design a more concrete and proactive steps to overcome reproductive health issue for women with disabilities in Indonesia, and also to build strategies which unite communities with different backgrounds.

Several steps taken are (1) determining the location of the study purposively in 33 sub-districts of Malang regency: in clinic, health, education, and social department, boarding school, Bhakti Luhur, P 2 TP 2 A, and local NGOs. Malang regency is chosen because (a) it is the only city which starts concerning sexuality and reproductive health <b>of</b> <b>women</b> with disabilities issues; (b) The sex ratio in 2010 was around 98, 78 %, which means that the number of females is significantly larger than males. As seen from the population density of 33 sub-districts of Malang, the majority <b>of</b> <b>women</b> has high density above 2000 /km². It implies that poverty is mostly suffered by women; (c) the number of reproductive health issues for women with disabilities is quite a lot, because it is regarded as a taboo.

The result of this study indicates that there are still a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> with disabilities <b>who</b> do not understand about taking care of their reproductive organs, and thus impacting their health. The control over their reproductive organs is still low, which makes many of them suffered from sexual violences that lead to unwanted pregnancies.
