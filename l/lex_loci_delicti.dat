25|$|Because {{the early}} system of {{connecting}} factors was mechanical and inflexible, the results could offend a court's sense of justice. For example, {{with the development}} of the motor car, the classification of the cause as tort required the application of the <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> <b>delicti</b> commissi rule. In France, the Court of Cassation's insistence on the rule frequently barred or severely limited relief for French parties injured in states with no developed law for the compensation of such victims. The lower courts used a variety of judicial devices to avoid the injustice.|$|E

5000|$|Since the Court did not {{directly}} address procedural factors such as statute of limitations and exhaustion of local remedies (i.e., a principle in international law whereby the plaintiff must exhaust remedies in the nation under whose territorial jurisdiction the tort occurred before having recourse in a foreign court), the Sosa framework might well be incomplete. Footnote 21 mentions, without deciding, that exhaustion could be a relevant issue to analyze in a future case. However, the opinion in chief would seem to implicitly reject an exhaustion requirement {{on account of the}} policy underlying Congress's decision to have federal courts hear claims by foreign nationals against other foreign nationals for acts committed on foreign soil. Though the Court does not explicitly pinpoint the policy, it implicitly adopts a hostis humani generis theory and rejects a transitory tort basis for jurisdiction. One can conclude this from the Court's insistence upon the law of nations as the source of justiciable torts, and its favorable recognition of Filártiga v. Pena-Irala. [...] Under a transitory tort doctrine, the choice of law is typically the <b>lex</b> <b>locus</b> <b>delicti,</b> or the law of the nation on whose territory the tort was committed. In contrast, a hostis humani generis (i.e., [...] "enemy of all mankind") theory requires a universal norm such as found in the law of nations. In Filártiga, the Second Circuit adopted the hostis humani generis rationale, deeming irrelevant the fact that the plaintiff could have a remedy under Paraguayan law (<b>lex</b> <b>locus</b> <b>delicti).</b>|$|R
40|$|When the Second Circuit {{decided in}} Filartiga v. Pena-Irala that the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) {{provided}} a federal forum for {{international human rights}} claims, {{no one would have}} predicted that thirty-three years later in Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co. the Supreme Court would use the presumption against extraterritoriality to limit those claims. This essay recounts some of the doctrinal developments in alien tort litigation during the intervening thirty-three years. After Filartiga, courts faced a choice whether to apply international law as the rule of decision, or the law of the place where the tort occurred. Courts chose the international law road, with U. S. law providing the cause of action and the rules for damages. The Supreme Court ratified this choice in Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, clarifying that the cause of action came not from the ATS itself but from federal common law. In the battles over aiding and abetting liability that followed, plaintiffs argued that federal common law should govern just about every issue of ATS litigation except the initial violation of international law, while defendants and the Bush Administration argued that the presumption against extraterritoriality should apply to the federal common law cause of action, the position the Supreme Court accepted in Kiobel. This essay argues that the early decisions to apply international law rather than the <b>lex</b> <b>locus</b> <b>delicti</b> as the rule of decision in alien tort litigation ultimately provided the doctrinal hook for the Supreme Court to restrict alien tort suits with the presumption against extraterritoriality. It also glances briefly down the road not taken...|$|R
500|$|The [...] "where {{the said}} Crimes shall have been committed" [...] {{language}} {{refers to the}} <b>locus</b> <b>delicti.</b> [...] "he <b>locus</b> <b>delicti</b> must be determined from {{the nature of the}} crime alleged and the location of the act or acts constituting it." [...] Thus, a single crime may often give rise to several constitutionally permissible venues, and venue may be constitutionally permissible even if an individual defendant was never personally present in the relevant state. For example, conspiracy may be prosecuted wherever the agreement occurred or wherever any overt act was committed.|$|R
5000|$|The rule is {{no longer}} used in Canadian law and instead the <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> <b>delicti</b> rule is used. [...] Likewise, the rule no longer forms part of Australian law which also uses the <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> <b>delicti</b> rule. [...] This rule holds that the {{applicable}} law for a tort committed in a foreign place will be the tort law of the foreign place.|$|E
50|$|The ruling {{concerning}} {{the choice of}} law (lex originis for determining copyright ownership and <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> <b>delicti</b> for the infringement) was contrary to the previous presumption that only the law where the infringement occurred (i.e., <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> <b>delicti)</b> would apply. It has been discussed controversially in several publications. Since the Berne Convention does not offer any guidance on which law shall be applied to determine copyright ownership, this ruling is still the relevant case law in this question and the principle is applied in the U.S. even in other recent cases. The decision is only effective within the U.S.; other countries may follow other rules, such as using the <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> <b>delicti</b> exclusively.|$|E

50|$|The first {{attempts}} {{to establish a}} coherent choice of law rule for tort cases involving a foreign law element varied between favouring the lex fori (i.e. {{the law of the}} court) and the <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> <b>delicti</b> commissi (i.e. the law of the place where the tort was committed). The public policy of territorial sovereignty was always the principal consideration. Hence, the forum courts claimed their right to apply their laws to determine whether any lawsuit initiated in their jurisdiction allowed a remedy. Equally, it is the commission of a tort that vests a right of action in a claimant and therefore, it should always be for the law of the place where that right was created {{to determine the extent of}} any remedy flowing from it. In the end, a compromise emerged where the <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> <b>delicti</b> was the first point of reference but courts retained a discretion to substitute the lex fori if the foreign law was deemed unfair and other practical considerations pointed to the application of forum law.|$|E
5000|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that this messy interpretation of the Australian Court could have been avoided, had the Court followed the general practice that procedural rules always go with the forum and substantive law depends on the [...] "forum most interested" [...] analysis. However, since John Pfeiffer Pty Ltd v Rogerson (2000) 203 CLR 503, statutes of limitations are considered substantive law. Because of this, the applicability of limitation laws no longer go with the local forum; rather, they too follow the <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> <b>delicti.</b>|$|E

40|$|Art. 7 of Regulation No. 864 / 07 (so called Rome II Regulation) {{provides}} for a specific conflict of laws rule concerning liability for environmental damage, which empowers the person sustaining the damage {{to choose between the}} application of the <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> damni and the application of the <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> actus. The present article analyses the rationale underpinning the attribution to only one of the parties concerned (the person sustaining the damage) of the unilateral right to choose the law applicable to their relationship and it concludes that the provision at issue does not purport to alter the equal balance between such parties, as it rather aims at ensuring a high level of environmental protection, both by preventing a race {{to the bottom of the}} relevant national legal standards and by discouraging the phenomenon known as environmental dumping. Furthermore, the article compares the specific provision laid down by art. 7 of Rome II Regulation with the general conflict of laws rule provided by art. 4 and art. 14 of the same instrument, with particular reference to the role played – in the peculiar context of environmental liability – by party autonomy and to the different relevance attributed by the said rules to the <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> damni and to the <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> actus...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Lex</b> <b>loci</b> celebrationis is a Latin {{term for}} a legal {{principle}} in English common law, roughly translated as [...] "the {{law of the land}} (<b>lex</b> <b>loci)</b> where the marriage was celebrated". It refers to the validity of the union, independent of the laws of marriage of the countries involved: where the two individuals have legal nationality or citizenship, or where they live (reside or are domiciled). The assumption under the common law is that such a marriage, when lawfully and validly celebrated under the relevant law of the land, is also lawful and valid.|$|R
5000|$|After {{reviewing}} the relevant authorities Lord Slynn {{held that the}} [...] "flexible exception" [...] to the double actionability requirement which had been created by the House of Lords in Boys v Chaplin 1971 AC 356 could apply in favour of not only the forum (the lex fori) but also in favour {{of the law of}} the place where the tort occurred (the <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> <b>delicti</b> commissi). In this case the facts were overwhelmingly connected with Saudi Arabia, and so Saudi Arabian law only should be applied to the relevant issue.|$|E
5000|$|The Court {{modified}} {{the test in}} Phillips v Eyre on whether a court can assume jurisdiction over a tort that occurred in another country by requiring [...] "double actionability".
