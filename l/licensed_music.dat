Goldstein of IGN praised the actors' {{performances}} {{and the use}} of <b>licensed</b> <b>music.</b> GameSpot's Calvert and GamesRadar's Walter also commended the <b>licensed</b> <b>music,</b> the latter admiring the humour of the radio's talk stations. Michael Pinson of The Pro Audio Files praised the separate features of the game's sound design—including the city's ambiance, <b>licensed</b> <b>music,</b> character dialogue, and vehicle and weapon sound effects—applauding the developer's use of uniting the features together. Carolyn Gudmundson of GamesRadar also retroactively praised the game's soundtrack, commending its suitability to the game's setting.|$|E
5|$|As Remedy {{encouraged}} YouTubers to make videos {{about the}} game and players to share their experience with others, the team introduced an audio option which allows players to turn off <b>licensed</b> <b>music.</b> This allows YouTubers to upload their videos online without {{having to worry about}} copyright infringement. The <b>licensed</b> <b>music</b> featured in the game was specially chosen by Lake, and is played {{at the end of each}} act and the credits scene.|$|E

5|$|Forza Motorsport 4 {{features}} an original score by Lance Hayes, {{also known as}} DJ Drunken Master. Like Forza Motorsport 3, the score consists mainly of ambient electronica music, although orchestral elements are incorporated into the music. Alongside the score, Forza Motorsport 4 contains {{a wide selection of}} <b>licensed</b> <b>music</b> from various artists. Although the game was released in 2011, the score was not officially released until October 30, 2013 on iTunes.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} by Sony Studio Liverpool. Production was centred around focusing on the feedback left by fans regarding Wipeout Pure, and improving on aspects where the development team thought they had failed in with the predecessor. The game features sixteen <b>licensed</b> <b>music</b> tracks from techno artists, including Kraftwerk. Wipeout Pulse received positive reviews upon release. Critics praised the graphics and presentation, although some criticised the repetitiveness and hard difficulty.|$|E
5|$|L.A. Noires open {{world is}} a {{recreation}} of 1947 Los Angeles. The development team conducted field research in Los Angeles throughout the game's development, and compiled multiple aerial photographs to gather traffic and building information. Various plot points and investigations in the game are based on real life events, such as the Black Dahlia case. Like other games published by Rockstar, L.A. Noire uses <b>licensed</b> <b>music</b> provided by an in-game radio. Over 30 licensed tracks continuously loop on one radio station. The game also features an original score composed {{by a group of}} musicians and inspired by 1940s films.|$|E

5|$|While Criterion {{had their}} own audio team to create {{original}} music, working with EA gave {{them the opportunity to}} include <b>licensed</b> <b>music</b> in Burnout 3. EA launched an initiative called EA TRAX in 2002 with the intent of including licensed tracks in all their games. Burnout 3s soundtrack featured over forty songs, delivered in a radio station format presented by DJ Stryker from alternative rock station KROQ-FM. Options were added to modify which songs during a race or on the menu screen and the Xbox version supports custom soundtracks.|$|E
5|$|After an {{audition}} process, Ned Luke, Shawn Fonteno and Steven Ogg {{were selected to}} portray Michael, Franklin and Trevor, respectively. Their performances were mostly recorded using motion capture technology, but dialogue for scenes with characters seated in vehicles was recorded in studios instead. The game {{is the first in}} its series to feature an original score, composed by a team of producers collaborating with each other over several years. <b>Licensed</b> <b>music</b> provided by an in-game radio is also used. The team licensed more than 241 tracks shared between fifteen radio stations, with an additional two stations providing talk radio. Some of the tracks were written specifically for the game, such as rapper and producer Flying Lotus' original work composed for the FlyLo FM radio station he hosts.|$|E
5|$|Guitar Hero and Rock Band (Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii), music game franchises {{which used}} {{specially}} designed controllers that mimicked musical instruments and allowed uses {{to play a}} large selection of <b>licensed</b> <b>music,</b> were extremely popular during the seventh generation, with over twenty different title releases across various platforms. Activision's Guitar Hero series sold more than 25 million units with over $2 billion in retail revenue, while Harmonix's Rock Band series has sold over 13 million copies; both series were augmented with a large volume of downloadable content. However, due to {{saturation of the market}} in 2009 along with the economic recess, both series have since ceased publishing, though Harmonix has stated they will bring back Rock Band to the eighth-generation when the time is right.|$|E

5|$|The actors {{selected}} {{to portray the}} protagonists invested much time and research into character development. Motion capture was used to record the characters' facial and body movements. Like its predecessors, the game features an in-game radio that plays a selection of <b>licensed</b> <b>music</b> tracks. The game {{is the first in}} its series to feature an original score, composed over several years by a team of five music producers. They worked in close collaboration, sampling and incorporating different influences into each other's ideas. The game's re-release added a first-person view option along with the traditional third-person view. To accommodate first-person, the game received a fundamental visual and technical upgrade, as well as new gameplay features like a replay editor that lets players create gameplay videos.|$|E
25|$|Kinect Sports {{features}} a front end and Party Play voiceover recorded by Peter Dickson {{and a number}} of <b>licensed</b> <b>music</b> tracks from artists including Queen, Robbie Williams, MC Hammer and Gwen Stefani. Celebratory stings from these tracks are used throughout the game when players score a goal, achieve a strike, break a record or win an otherwise crucial point.|$|E
25|$|As with {{previous}} Need for Speed titles, Most Wanteds soundtrack contains {{a variety of}} <b>licensed</b> <b>music.</b> It mainly comprises electronic music (including dubstep, such as Skrillex, Techno, such as Deadmau5, and electronica, such as Zedd), alternative rock and hip hop, such as Dizzee Rascal. Among these songs are two remixes of The Who songs originally from the album Who's Next. Most Wanted also contains songs from Criterion Games' previous title, Burnout Crash!, which play over the stereo of parked cars.|$|E

25|$|The game's soundtrack {{features}} about 170 licensed tracks accessible across twelve in-game {{radio stations}} while driving or at home. Station genres include alternative rock, reggae, hip hop, heavy metal, funk, R and 1980s pop, with {{artists such as}} Opeth, Duran Duran, Lamb of God, The Used, My Chemical Romance, Avenged Sevenfold, Paramore, Panic! at the Disco and Run-D.M.C. The player can create a custom playlist of the licensed tracks to play on a separate station. Lead audio designer Frank Petreikis's budget for <b>licensed</b> <b>music</b> was double that of the previous game so as to secure more prominent tracks.|$|E
25|$|The Daria TV movies Is It Fall Yet? and Is It College Yet? {{were the}} sole two {{authorized}} DVD releases until 2010. Each DVD also includes two episodes from the series, from seasons 4 and 5 respectively, with <b>licensed</b> <b>music</b> removed. The latter disc uses a second-showing MTV version that was shortened by approximately seven minutes, {{rather than the}} original cablecast version. It does, however, include a short clip of a Daria appearance on Beavis and Butt-Head, accessed as a hidden Easter egg on the opening menu (by cycling among menu choices until the highlighting disappears).|$|E
500|$|BioShock {{contains}} both <b>licensed</b> <b>music</b> and {{an original}} score. The <b>licensed</b> <b>music</b> from the 1940s and 1950s {{can be heard}} playing on phonograph throughout Rapture. In total, 30 licensed songs can be heard throughout the game. The original score was composed by Garry Schyman. He works his pieces to mesh well with the chosen <b>licensed</b> <b>music</b> as to keep the same feel, while also trying to bring out something that was [...] "eerie, frightening and at times beautiful" [...] to mesh well with Rapture's environments.|$|E

The <b>music</b> is <b>licensed</b> by the customers according to an accepted license agreement, and they cannot sell it or license it to others.

500|$|Destructoid's Jim Sterling {{called the}} sound design [...] "impeccable" [...] and praised the actors' performances, {{original}} soundtrack and <b>licensed</b> <b>music</b> use. IGN and Giant Bomb commended the music selection {{and felt that}} the original score enhanced dramatic tension during missions. GameSpot's Petit wrote that the score [...] "lends missions more cinematic flavour". Edge said that the <b>licensed</b> <b>music</b> enhanced the city's [...] "already remarkable sense of space" [...] and that the original score improved {{the atmosphere of the}} gameplay. They summarised the game as [...] "a compendium of everything Rockstar has learnt about the power of game music in the past decade".|$|E
500|$|Grand Theft Auto V is {{the first}} game in its series to use an {{original}} score. Music supervisor Ivan Pavlovich summarised the original score idea as [...] "daunting", because it was unprecedented for a Grand Theft Auto game. Like most previous series entries, the game uses <b>licensed</b> <b>music</b> tracks provided by an in-game radio as well. Pavlovich hoped that the original score would enhance the <b>licensed</b> <b>music</b> use, not detract from it. He further noted the balancing act between the score's [...] "ambient subtext and tensions" [...] and the game's onscreen action. To work on the score, Rockstar engaged The Alchemist, Oh No and Tangerine Dream with Woody Jackson, who had previously worked on Red Dead Redemption, L.A. Noire and Max Payne 3s music. The team of producers collaborated over several years to create more than twenty hours of music that scores both the game's missions and dynamic gameplay throughout the single-player and multiplayer modes.|$|E
500|$|Tom McShea criticised {{the game}} for lacking [...] "surprising, memorable {{gameplay}} moments" [...] in his review for GameSpot, but hailed it for its [...] "fresh" [...] story-telling, great original as well as <b>licensed</b> <b>music,</b> [...] "subtle" [...] lighting effects, which, along with the soundtrack, [...] "create a disturbing atmosphere", [...] "satisfying" [...] combat system and [...] "clever" [...] inclusion of collectibles, giving a final score of 8.5/10.|$|E
