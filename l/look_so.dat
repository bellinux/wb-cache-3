5|$|Effects artist Scott Stoddard {{described}} his look for Jason's face {{as a combination}} of Carl Fullerton's design for Friday the 13th Part 2 and Tom Savini's design for Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter. Stoddard's vision of Jason included hair loss, skin rashes, and the traditional deformities in his face. Stoddard tried to craft Jason's <b>look</b> <b>so</b> it would allow more human side of the character to be seen. Mears was required to wear full body make-up from the chest upwards while performing as Jason. The actor wore a chest plate with fake skin that would adjust to his muscle movements. He wore a hump on his back {{to give the impression}} that Jason had scoliosis. A prosthetic eye was glued to Mears' face to show realistic eye movements. Stoddard initially spent three-and-a-half hours applying the make-up to Mears' head and torso. He was eventually able to reduce the required time to just over an hour for scenes in which Mears wore the hockey mask. For scenes in which Jason's face is revealed, it took approximately four hours to apply the make-up.|$|E
25|$|The Grady sisters <b>look</b> <b>so</b> similar {{that they}} appear to be twins, though they're {{actually}} different ages (Ullman states that he thinks that they were about eight and ten).|$|E
25|$|The ladies wear {{jackets and}} {{petticoats}} of brown linen, with chip hats, {{in which they}} fix their handkerchiefs to wipe the sweat from their faces; but, truly, whether it is owing to the steam that surrounds them, or {{the heat of the}} water, or the nature of the dress, or to all these causes together, they <b>look</b> <b>so</b> flushed, and so frightful, that I always turn my eyes another way.|$|E

6000|$|Why {{on earth}} should Miss La Creevy and Tim Linkinwater have said {{all this in}} a whisper? It was no secret. And why should Tim Linkinwater have <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> hard at Miss La Creevy, and why should Miss La Creevy have <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> hard at the ground? ...|$|R

500|$|Jones and Purvis {{attended}} the BET Hip Hop Awards in Atlanta on October 13, 2007, and {{were invited to}} present the award for Video of the Year. When the two defendants came out on stage, they were greeted by a standing ovation. Emcee Katt Williams joked, [...] "They don't <b>look</b> <b>so</b> tough, do they?" [...] The two members delivered speeches thanking family, friends, the [...] "Hip-Hop Nation", and those who came to Jena.|$|E
60|$|At first Biddy gave a cry, as if {{she thought}} it was my apparition, but in another moment she was in my embrace. I wept to see her, and she wept to see me; I, because she <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> fresh and pleasant; she, because I <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> worn and white.|$|R

60|$|Toodles <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> thunderstruck {{that the}} Assistant Commissioner smiled faintly.|$|R
500|$|One of {{the props}} {{developed}} for the video {{was a pair of}} sunglasses made of wire. According to Gaga, she imagined [...] "a downtown, bad-ass kid walking down the street with his buddies, grabbing a pair of pliers, and making a pair of sunglasses out of a fence on the street". She wore them on the opening shot of the music video along with a chain link hood garment, saying that [...] "they <b>look</b> <b>so</b> hard. It looks like I plied them right out of the fence and put them on my face".|$|E
500|$|Reborn dolls <b>look</b> <b>so</b> real {{they have}} been mistaken for real babies. In July 2008, police in Queensland, Australia smashed a car window to rescue what seemed like an {{unconscious}} baby only to find it was a reborn doll. The police stated that the doll was [...] "incredibly lifelike" [...] and that bystanders who thought a baby was dying were frightened by the incident. A similar incident {{was reported in the}} United States, in which police broke the window of a Hummer to save a baby {{that turned out to be}} a reborn doll.|$|E
500|$|When {{creating}} the gadgets for the series, the writers noted {{the need to}} combine the period setting with the influence of Howard Stark, who {{opens the door to}} [...] "things that are fantastic for the time period". They worked closely with the props department to develop technology that appears [...] "both retro and futuristic at the same time", with Fazekas explaining that the goal was to avoid a science fiction <b>look,</b> <b>so</b> the fantastical aspects were reserved solely for function while the aesthetic was kept within the realms of that time period.|$|E

500|$|The chorus was {{inspired}} by U2's first concert in New York City following the September 11 attacks during their 2001 Elevation Tour. When the lights illuminated the audience during a performance of [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name," [...] the band saw tears streaming down the faces of many fans. Upon seeing this raw release of emotion, Bono shouted, [...] "Oh you <b>look</b> <b>so</b> beautiful tonight"; later, the band integrated the line into the chorus. The fans' passion, along with the resolve of the city following the attack, were the primary inspirations {{for many of the}} song's other lyrics.|$|E
500|$|The {{gang member}} likes insignias that are {{prominent}} on sweaters and their creator. Among the 28 stories, other notable tales include {{one about the}} influence of Madonna (with discourse including [...] "Any American woman under 40 who says she's never dressed as Madonna is either lying or Amish."); one about dressing room anxiety (a story revolving around the concept that [...] "I'm an 8. I've always been an 8"); and one about your mother's tastes in clothes ("I don't understand, you could <b>look</b> <b>so</b> good if you tried"). [...] Three of the characters sometimes work as a trio and all characters have monologues.|$|E
500|$|Host Regis Philbin {{described}} Carpenter {{as having}} [...] "cruised right through those first fourteen questions," [...] he had proceeded {{to reach the}} final question without using any of his lifelines. The $1 million question was, [...] "Which of these U.S. Presidents appeared on the television series 'Laugh-In'?", with the choices being A) Lyndon Johnson, B) Richard Nixon, C) Jimmy Carter, and D) Gerald Ford. Carpenter used his Phone-A-Friend lifeline to call his father not for help, but rather to inform him that he knew the answer. Carpenter later explained, [...] "I thought I'd <b>look</b> <b>so</b> cocky if I didn't use any lifelines, so I faked it." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2004, Hurlbut {{teamed up}} with {{director}} Charles Stone III again {{to work on the}} film Mr. 3000. In a positive review of the film, Harper Barnes of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch highlighted Hurlbut, noting he had previously worked with the film's editor, Bill Pankow, on Drumline. In a review of Mr. 3000 for The Manhattan Mercury, arts critic G.W. Clift specifically highlighted Hurlbut's work on the film, commenting: [...] "Mr. 3000 has several attractions, even unexpected ones like Shane Hurlbut's heart-stopping photography. ... one doesn't mind that it lingers over scenes, in part because the scenes <b>look</b> <b>so</b> very good." [...] In his review Mr. 3000 for the Intelligencer Journal, Jack Roberts also highlighted Hurlbut's work on the film.|$|E
500|$|Gittings {{participated in}} many of the {{earliest}} LGBT actions in the United States. In 1965, Gittings marched in the first gay picket lines at the White House, the US State Department, and at Independence Hall in Philadelphia to protest the federal government's policy on discrimination of homosexuals, holding a sign that read [...] "Sexual preference is irrelevant to federal employment." [...] The men who agreed to picket had to wear suits and ties, and the women who participated were to wear dresses, heels, and pantyhose so as to look employable by the federal government. Reactions from passersby were varied. A tourist witnessing the demonstration remarked, [...] "I still don't believe it. Somebody's kidding." [...] A stunned high school student pointed out, [...] "They all <b>look</b> <b>so</b> normal." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} {{illustrate}} the special abilities of the Justice League members, special effects company Entity FX had {{to come in and}} digitally create the powers for each character. Senior Producer at Entity FX, Trent Smith, explained that they wanted to give Bart's super speed a [...] "more current" [...] <b>look,</b> <b>so</b> they employed 3D techniques in conjunction with the 2D graphics from season four to create a [...] "hybrid" [...] image for the screen. Smith explained that the 3D technology allowed the team to [...] " [...] a path for [...] that he {{may not be able to}} achieve in the 2D composite world". Entity FX used Autodesk Maya and Adobe After Effects to create the 3D stream that follows Bart when he is running at super speed.|$|E

5000|$|An {{acoustic}} {{version of}} [...] "Well Well Well" [...] {{was released on}} the 2004 album Acoustic. The instrumentation on this version include just Lennon playing acoustic guitar. This version of the song contains the line [...] "She <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> beautiful I could wee" [...] instead of [...] "She <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> beautiful I could eat her." [...] Urish and Bielen raise the possibility that since Lennon was singing in a nasal voice and dropping some consonants, {{he may have been}} actually singing [...] "She <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> beautiful I could weep." [...] Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine calls the Acoustic version [...] "lean, mean...with a heavily phased vocal." ...|$|R
500|$|Its {{mastery of}} form, light, and shadow made the work <b>look</b> <b>so</b> {{realistic}} that Rodin {{was accused of}} surmoulage– having taken a cast from a living model. Rodin vigorously denied the charges, writing to newspapers and having photographs taken of the model to prove how the sculpture differed. He demanded an inquiry and was eventually exonerated by a committee of sculptors. Leaving aside the false charges, the piece polarized critics. It had barely won acceptance for display at the Paris Salon, and criticism likened it to [...] "a statue of a sleepwalker" [...] and called it [...] "an astonishingly accurate copy of a low type". Others rallied to defend the piece and Rodin's integrity. The government minister Turquet admired the piece, and The Age of Bronze was purchased by the state for 2,200 francs– what it had cost Rodin to have it cast in bronze.|$|E
500|$|The {{film has}} been criticized for its {{portrayal}} of ballet and ballet dancers. Upon the film's release in the United Kingdom, The Guardian interviewed four professional ballet dancers in the UK: Tamara Rojo, Lauren Cuthbertson, Edward Watson, and Elena Glurjidze. Rojo called the film [...] "lazy... featuring every ballet cliche going." [...] Watson felt that the film [...] "makes [...] <b>look</b> <b>so</b> naff and laughable. It doesn't show why ballet is so important to us – why we would want to try so hard." [...] The Canadian Press also reported that many Canadian ballet dancers felt that the film depicted dancers negatively and exaggerated elements of their lives but gave Portman high marks for her dance technique. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Gillian Murphy a principal dancer with American Ballet Theatre praised the visual elements of the film but noted that the film presentation of the ballet world was [...] "extreme." ...|$|E
500|$|Lennon went to New York with McCartney shortly afterward, telling Cynthia {{she could}} not go with them, so she went {{on a trip to}} Italy with her mother. During Cynthia's holiday in Italy, an [...] "agitated" [...] Mardas {{unexpectedly}} arrived (pacing up and down outside her hotel until she returned) and gave the news that Lennon was planning to sue Cynthia for divorce on grounds of adultery, seek sole custody of Julian, and send Cynthia [...] "back to Hoylake". Mardas also said that he intended to testify in court that Cynthia had committed adultery with him. She said in 2005: [...] "The mere fact that Magic Alex [...] arrived in Italy {{in the middle of the}} night without any prior knowledge of where I was staying made me extremely suspicious. I was being coerced into making it easy for John [...] and Yoko to accuse me of doing something that would make them not <b>look</b> <b>so</b> bad".|$|E
