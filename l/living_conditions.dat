The researcher will identify rural migrants in Beijing, examine their housing characteristics (housing crowding, housing privacy and housing facility) and the influence on their <b>living</b> <b>condition.</b> Also, some suggestions are given to improve their housing characteristics and <b>living</b> <b>condition.</b> The government should revise the migrant housing policy and hukou management. Also, the rural migrants should try to increase their education level and social skills. For the occupation, the local government should give the rural migrants more job opportunity. These issues are analyzed in relation to local government attitudes toward the rural migrants. The analysis is based on data collected from two types of interviews: rural migrants and management interviews which examine the rural migrants’ housing and managerial aspects of this research, respectively. It is also supported by the utilization of secondary data. The findings of the study indicate that the rural migrants’ housing characteristics (housing crowding, housing privacy and housing facility) highly influence their <b>living</b> <b>condition</b> in Beijing Fengtai District.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to analyze}} the {{marginalization}} process of rural community, represented by aging and population decline, {{from the perspective of}} resident's <b>living</b> <b>condition.</b> In other words, it aims to elucidate the actual changes that residents face in the marginalization process of rural community. A series of field survey was conducted in Yurihonjo City in Akita Prefecture. Total of five rural communities were selected from remote and central area of the city. Field survey was composed of questionnaire-based household survey and interview survey in each community. In order to capture the <b>living</b> <b>condition</b> of residents, the applied variables in the questionnaire were set based on the categories in Sustainable Development Indicators. This process ensured a wider perspective on capturing <b>living</b> <b>condition</b> of residents. The comparative analysis of the result first illustrated a significant difference on farming type between remote and central community. In remote community, more households are engaged in cultivation for self-consumption purpose than central community. This finding implies that various activities may gradually change their contents rather than their immediate disappearances in the marginalization process. Second, the results of self-evaluation on <b>living</b> <b>condition,</b> future concerns, and residents'willingness to stay in the same community prevailed that the residents of remote community are more concerned on the practical factors to sustain <b>living</b> <b>condition</b> of individual households, while residents of central community expressed higher level of concern on the sustainability of the entire community. Those observed differences in field survey are rooted in the continuous outflow of young population from rural to urban area. This implies the existence of urban system {{on the other side of}} those various marginalizing phenomena in rural community. Thus, the result of this study suggests the importance of establishing a new interaction, more of interdependence, between rural and urban areas in today's local governance as one of the potential measures to the current situation of rural community. 報告番号:; 学位授与年月日: 2012 - 03 - 22; 学位の種別: 修士; 学位の種類: 修士(サステイナビリティ学); 学位記番号: 修創域第 4470 号; 研究科・専攻: 新領域創成科学研究科環境学研究系サステイナビリティ学教育プログラ...|$|R
