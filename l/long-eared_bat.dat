5|$|Only one native mammal {{remains on}} the islands, the large forest bat. The endemic Lord Howe <b>long-eared</b> <b>bat</b> is known only from a skull and is now presumed extinct, {{possibly}} {{the result of the}} introduction of ship rats.|$|E
5|$|The concept plan {{identified}} 145 {{species of}} birds as either known or expected {{to be found in}} the park. By 2006, 98 species had been recorded in the park's area, though not all specifically within the park's boundaries. Of the park's insects, seven species were found to be largely confined by its boundaries, with little presence in the rest of Adelaide. Their presence was unusual, as they were regarded as arid zone species. Approximately 35 reptile and amphibian species have been recorded within Anstey Hill park. Fauna in the park includes western grey kangaroo, common ringtail possum, common brushtail possum, short-beaked echidna, Gould's wattled bat, chocolate wattled bat, little forest bat, white-striped free-tailed bat and the lesser <b>long-eared</b> <b>bat.</b> Koalas are present, though they are not native to the area, having been deliberately introduced to the Adelaide hills.|$|E
5|$|Most microbats, {{especially}} in temperate areas, prey on insects. The diet of an insectivorous bat may span {{a wide range}} of species, including flies, beetles, moths, grasshoppers, crickets, termites, bees, wasps, mayflies and caddisflies. Large numbers of Mexican free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) fly hundreds of meters above the ground in central Texas to feed on migrating moths. Species that hunt insects in flight, like the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus), may catch an insect in mid-air with its mouth, and eat it in the air or use their tail membranes or wings to scoop up the insect and carry it to the mouth. The bat may also take the insect back to its roost and eat it there. Slower moving bat species such as the brown <b>long-eared</b> <b>bat</b> (Plecotus auritus) and many horseshoe bat species, may take or glean insects from vegatation or hunt them from perches. Insectivorous bats living at high latitudes have to consume prey with higher energetic value than tropical bats.|$|E

50|$|In the fall, {{northern}} <b>long-eared</b> <b>bats</b> {{migrate to}} caves to hibernate. Depending on the latitude, this may occur {{at any time}} between September and November, and the bats emerge between March and May. They typically hibernate together with much larger numbers of bats of other species, although hibernating groups of northern <b>long-eared</b> <b>bats</b> may still number in the hundreds.|$|R
5|$|The maximum {{lifespan}} of bats is three-and-a-half {{times larger}} than other mammals of a similar size. Five species have been recorded living over 30 years in the wild: the brown <b>long-eared</b> <b>bat</b> (Plecotus auritus), the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus), Brandt's bat (Myotis brandti), the lesser mouse-eared bat (Myotis blythii) and the greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum). One hypothesis as to why bats can live so long is because they slow down their metabolic rate while hibernating, being consistent with the rate-of-living theory; bats that hibernate, on average, have a longer lifespan than bats that do not. Another hypothesis is that flying has reduced their mortality rate, which would also be true for birds and gliding mammals. Bat species which give birth to multiple pups generally have a shorter lifespan than species that give birth to only a single pup. Cave-roosting species may have a longer lifespan than non-roosting species because of the decreased predation in caves. The oldest recorded bat is a 41-year-old male Brandt's bat.|$|E
25|$|Endangered species {{known to}} occur in the Daniel Boone National Forest include Indiana Bat, Cumberland darter, snuffbox, sheepnose, and fluted kidneyshell. Threatened species known {{to occur in}} the Daniel Boone National Forest include White-haired goldenrod, rabbitsfoot, and {{northern}} <b>long-eared</b> <b>bat.</b> The Cumberland arrow darter and the Kentucky arrow darter are currently proposed for listing under the Endangered Species Act of 1969.|$|E
25|$|The {{heathland}} is {{a significant}} local habitat for the common lizard (Zootoca vivipara) grass snakes (Natrix natrix), and slowworms (Anguis fragilis) dominate the mats in the grassland in spring-time. The common newt (Lissotriton vulgaris), common toad (Bufo bufo) and common frog (Rana temporaria) all inhabit the ponds, and the high insect numbers associated with the water attract bats, such as the common pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) and common <b>long-eared</b> <b>bat</b> (Plecotus auritus).|$|E

25|$|The {{large mammals}} {{present in the}} {{ecoregion}} are the addax (Addax nasomaculatus), Barbary sheep (Ammotragus lervia), dorcas gazelle (Gazella dorcas), and rhim gazelle (Gazella leptoceros). However, rodents are the most represented order of mammals in the Tibesti, and include the Agag gerbil (Gerbillus agag), Balochistan gerbil (Gerbillus nanus), Cairo spiny mouse (Acomys cahirinus), lesser Egyptian jerboa (Jaculus jaculus), Libyan jird (Meriones libycus), Mzab gundi (Massoutiera Mzabi) and the North African gerbil (Gerbillus campestris). Also present are cats such as the African wildcat (Felis silvestris lybica) and, more rarely, the caracal (Caracal caracal) and the Sudan cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus soemmeringii), {{as well as several}} canine species including the Egyptian wolf (Canis anthus lupaster), fennec fox (Vulpes zerda) and Rüppell's fox (Vulpes rueppellii). The striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena) may also occupy the range. There may be as many as 50 endangered painted hunting dogs (Lycaon pictus) in the Tibesti, although some regard these relict populations as extirpated, partially due to the Darfur refugee turmoil and other Sudan generated conflicts. Bats are heavily represented in the Tibesti, including the desert <b>long-eared</b> <b>bat</b> (Otonycteris hemprichii), greater mouse-tailed bat (Rhinopoma microphyllum), Hamilton's tomb bat (Taphozous hamiltoni), Mauritian tomb bat (Taphozous mauritianus) and the trident bat (Asellia tridens). The Cape hare (Lepus capensis), desert hedgehog (Paraechinus aethiopicus), olive baboon (Papio anubis), rock hyrax (Procavia capensis) and the Saharan striped polecat (Ictonyx libyca) also populate the area.|$|E
500|$|Little brown bats {{are now at}} {{a higher}} threat due to white-nose {{syndrome}} (WNS) in eastern North America. White-nose syndrome {{is caused by the}} fungus, Pseudogymnoascus destructans, which affects bats during hibernation. [...] " [...] WNS is estimated to have killed more than 5.5 million bats in the Northeast and Canada. In some sites, 90 to 100 percent of bats have died (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, 2015)." [...] Many states have made special considerations with respect to the disease, including listing them as a sensitive or protected species. [...] Canada has listed them as an endangered species. [...] It is estimated that 94% of the population in the eastern half of the country has died {{over the last few years}} from WNS, and the disease is moving westward at a rate that may see them extirpated within as little as 12 years. [...] It is expected that the tri-colored bat will also be listed in a few years due to WNS, and the northern <b>long-eared</b> <b>bat</b> was recently federally listed as threatened due to WNS.|$|E
