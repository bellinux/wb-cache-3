2500|$|The 1969 98 {{conventional}} front engine/rear drive car {{remained the}} top-of-the-line Oldsmobile. It {{was the largest}} Oldsmobile product offered and now had a [...] wheelbase. Six body styles were now available with a hardtop version of the Luxury Sedan added to the lineup. New to the 98 series were a recessed padded instrument panel, anti-theft lock within the steering column, rear view mirror map light, mini-buckle seat belts, and deeply padded head restraints. Standard equipment included: power brakes, self-regulating electric clock, full carpeting, courtesy lamps, paint stripes, power seat adjuster, seat belts and shoulder harnasses, power steering, Deluxe steering wheel, power windows, Turbo-Hydramatic transmission, custom sport seat, foam padded front seat, and wheel discs (hub caps). Standard tire size was 8.85 x 14inches. Upholstery was vinyl, cloth or leather. The 98's standard engine was still the Rocket 455 which required premium <b>leaded</b> <b>gas.</b> All 98s were made in Lansing and had the code letter M.|$|E

5000|$|Due to lead {{pollution}} risks, {{the use of}} <b>leaded</b> auto <b>gas</b> {{began to}} be phased out in the mid-1970s. But most small airplanes, including piston-engine aircraft and some smaller jets, still run on leaded fuel, known as [...] "avgas." [...] In December 2014, CEH reached legal agreements with 26 avgas providers in California requiring them to not use or sell gasoline with a lead content greater than 0.56 grams per liter, which is significantly lower than many fuel mixes. The settlement called on the companies to sell avgas [...] "with the lowest concentration of lead approved for aviation use that is commercially available," [...] and required them to post warning signs around airports.|$|R
5000|$|... 1972 was {{the last}} model year for the mid-sized Buick Skylark. During this model year many {{pollution}} controls {{were added to the}} engines, Compression was lowered, engines had to accept <b>leaded</b> and unleaded <b>gas,</b> and spark timing was retarded (no vacuum advance in lower gears) while driving in lower gears to reduce emissions. For 1972, the base Buick Skylark used the 350-cubic-inch V8 with the 2-barrel Rochester carburetor (now putting out 145 horsepower) as standard equipment. A new federally mandated system to calculate power was put into effect that year, and the actual engine performance was probably comparable but slightly lower because of pollution controls in the 1972 model year to the [...] that was listed for the previous year. The Skylark 350 now used a version of the same V8 engine as the base Skylark, but with a 4-barrel Rochester carburetor that generated [...]|$|R
5000|$|South Prescott is {{a hundred}} year old {{neighborhood}} in West Oakland; due to past industrial activity and <b>leaded</b> <b>gas</b> neighborhood soil averaged 800 ppm lead before a major EPA-led cleanup. Some {{of the most}} contaminated areas of the neighborhood had soil lead levels in excess of 2700 ppm. The EPA-led cleanup used ground up bones from pollock to convert elemental lead in the soil to pyromorphite, a compound that is harmless {{even if it is}} ingested. [...] The cleanup successfully remediated around 95% of residential properties in South Prescott, as well as all public right-of-ways.|$|E
50|$|Bartlett Pond has water {{depths of}} {{slightly}} over a meter. The {{bottom of the}} pond {{is made up of}} fine silt and clay muds with large cobbles, clasts and boulders in some places left behind by the retreat of the glaciers. In a study conducted by University of Massachusetts-Amherst in 2013 and again in 2014, X-ray fluorescence data shows slightly higher abundance of lead and zinc within the upper 50 centimeters of sediment cores taken out of the pond. These elements are common in the shallowest sediments of many ponds throughout the Northeast US, left behind by industrial pollution and <b>leaded</b> <b>gas</b> emissions.|$|E
50|$|Environmental {{issues in}} Iran include, {{especially}} in urban areas, vehicle emissions, refinery operations, and industrial effluents which contribute to poor air quality. Most cars use <b>leaded</b> <b>gas</b> and lack emissions control equipment. Tehran is rated {{as one of}} the world’s most polluted cities. However, buses and cars running on natural gas are planned to replace the existing public transportation fleet in the future. Also, energy prices are kept artificially low in Iran through heavy state subsidies, resulting in highly inefficient and polluting consumption patterns. Traffic management, vehicle inspection, general use of electric bicycles and electronic government are also part of the solution.|$|E
40|$|Boron nitride (BN) {{nanotubes}} {{of different}} sizes and tubular structures exhibit very different mechanical and chemical properties, as well as different applications. BN nanotubes {{of different sizes}} and nanostructures have been produced in different nitriding gases in a milling and annealing process, in which elemental boron powder was first milled in NH 3 for 150 h and subsequently annealed at 1, 200 °C for 6 h. The influence of nitriding gases was investigated by using N 2, NH 3, N 2 –H 2 mixture gases. A relatively slow nitriding reaction in NH 3 <b>gas</b> <b>leaded</b> to a 2 D growth of BN (002) basal planes {{and the formation of}} thin BN nanotubes without the help of metal catalysts. Fast nitriding reactions occurred in N 2 or N 2 –H 2 mixture gases, catalyzed by metal particles, resulted in 3 D crystal growth and the formation of many large cylindrical and bamboo tubes. <br /...|$|R
50|$|After {{isolating}} {{the pump}} problem, {{cars and trucks}} built for the war effort (no civilian cars were built during that time) were equipped with carbon-seal water pumps that did not leak and caused no more geysers. Meanwhile, air cooling advanced in memory of boiling engines... even though boil-over {{was no longer a}} common problem. Air-cooled engines became popular throughout Europe. After the war, Volkswagen advertised in the USA as not boiling over, even though new water-cooled cars no longer boiled over, but these cars sold well. But as air quality awareness rose in the 1960s, and laws governing exhaust emissions were passed, unleaded gas replaced <b>leaded</b> <b>gas</b> and leaner fuel mixtures became the norm. Subaru chose liquid-cooling for their EA series (flat) engine when it was introduced in 1966.|$|E
50|$|Different {{transportation}} systems affect {{the environment of}} a city but can also affect other elements. Transportation system planning impact three main elements that {{can go back and}} forth. These three elements are accessibility, land use, and activity. The planning process of transportation system can impact all, none, or one of these three elements. Therefore, during the process of planning {{it is important to consider}} what will be at stake if specific {{transportation systems}} are going to be build. In addition to these elements, transportation also impacts the environment around it. The increase of car use in specific cities within the United States has increased which can cause more pollution in the air due to <b>leaded</b> <b>gas</b> for fuel engines. Another important impact is that transportation systems can impact the national economy. This can be due to the large investments in specific transportation system development in cities such as bridges and construction of roads.|$|E

5000|$|These removal {{actions were}} {{ineffective}} at making the park safe, particularly because the protective dome the city installed {{had not been}} maintained or checked and had cracked. [...] In 1993, the African American Development Organization lead a drive to force the government to evaluate {{the safety of the}} park, after a yellow-white substance had begun to ooze out of cracks in basketball courts in the park. [...] Later that same year, the City of Oakland fenced off the park and began testing the area, the EPA was also involved. The EPA's evaluation of the site found that soil lead levels as high as 6,700 ppm were still present in the park, as well as zinc levels in excess of 7,450 ppm, and arsenic levels in excess of 700ppm. The evaluation also found that residential properties within seven blocks of the park also had significantly elevated levels of lead, in some cases as high as 10,000 ppm. (84% of houses in the area were built before 1950, and were thus extant while the battery plant was still operational.) Elevated levels of lead, presumably from the park, were also found at a nearby elementary school. Although much of the contamination in these areas was likely due to the park, lead paint and <b>leaded</b> <b>gas</b> from nearby highways probably contributed to the contamination as well. An additional series of actions were taken by joint local, state, and federal agencies between 1993 and 1996 aimed to remediate the park and surrounding residential properties. [...] The park reopened in 1996, and cleanup of all nearby residential properties with a soil lead concentration >1000 ppm was performed by AlliedSignal (the owner of the plant, and its final completion was agreed to by the EPA in 2001 in a way that absolved AliedSignal of any future liability.|$|E
40|$|Many {{environmental}} policies including the Kyoto Protocol, the Acid Rain Program, the Montreal Protocol and the phase-out of <b>leaded</b> <b>gas</b> {{are designed to}} achieve a target level of abatement within a specified period of time. This paper examines how pollution abatement should be allocated over time using heterogeneous technologies characterized by learning by doing. In the presence of learning by doing, conventional economic wisdom regarding the allocation of pollution abatement must be modified. This paper derives the appropriate generalization of the principle that marginal abatement costs are equalized and shows how learning by doing alters the optimal allocation of abatement.
