5|$|In chronic {{inflammatory}} {{diseases like}} atopic dermatitis (skin), rheumatoid arthritis (joints),…, {{the side effects}} of corticosteroids are problematic because of the necessary <b>long-term</b> <b>treatment.</b> Therefore, SEGRAMs are being investigated as an alternative topical treatment. Systemic <b>long-term</b> <b>treatment</b> of inflammations with corticosteroids is particularly liable to cause metabolic side-effects, which makes the development of oral SEGRAMs an interesting goal.

5|$|Before the 1980s, the {{prognosis}} or expected outcome of DPB was poor, especially in cases with superinfection (the {{emergence of a}} new viral or bacterial infection, in addition to the currently occurring infection) by P.aeruginosa. DPB continued to have a very high mortality rate before generalized antibiotic treatment and oxygen therapy were beginning to be used routinely in the effort to manage symptoms. Around 1985, when <b>long-term</b> <b>treatment</b> with the antibiotic erythromycin became the standard for managing DPB, {{the prognosis}} significantly improved.

5|$|A major {{disadvantage}} of benzodiazepines that tolerance to therapeutic effects develops relatively quickly while many adverse effects persist. Tolerance develops to hypnotic and myorelexant effects within days to weeks, and to anticonvulsant and anxiolytic effects within weeks to months. Therefore, benzodiazepines {{are unlikely to}} be effective long-term treatments for sleep and anxiety. While BZD therapeutic effects disappear with tolerance, depression and impulsivity with high suicidal risk commonly persist. Several studies have confirmed that long-term benzodiazepines are not significantly different from placebo for sleep or anxiety. This may explain why patients commonly increase doses over time and many eventually take more than one type of benzodiazepine after the first loses effectiveness. Additionally, because tolerance to benzodiazepine sedating effects develops more quickly than does tolerance to brainstem depressant effects, those taking more benzodiazepines to achieve desired effects may suffer sudden respiratory depression, hypotension or death. Most patients with anxiety disorders and PTSD have symptoms that persist for at least several months, making tolerance to therapeutic effects a distinct problem for them and necessitating the need for more effective <b>long-term</b> <b>treatment</b> (e.g., psychotherapy, serotonergic antidepressants).|$|E

5|$|Guidelines {{issued by}} the UK-based National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), carried out a {{systematic}} review using different methodology {{and came to a}} different conclusion. They questioned the accuracy of studies that were not placebo-controlled. And, based on the findings of placebo-controlled studies, they do not recommend use of benzodiazepines beyond two to four weeks, as tolerance and physical dependence develop rapidly, with withdrawal symptoms including rebound anxiety occurring after six weeks or more of use. Nevertheless, benzodiazepines are still prescribed for <b>long-term</b> <b>treatment</b> of anxiety disorders, although specific antidepressants and psychological therapies are recommended as the first-line treatment options with the anticonvulsant drug pregabalin indicated as a second- or third-line treatment and suitable for long-term use. NICE stated that long-term use of benzodiazepines for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia is an unlicensed indication, does not have long-term efficacy, and is, therefore, not recommended by clinical guidelines. Psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy are recommended as a first-line therapy for panic disorder; benzodiazepine use has been found to interfere with therapeutic gains from these therapies.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the release}} of nonbenzodiazepines in 1992 in {{response}} to safety concerns, individuals with insomnia and other sleep disorders have increasingly been prescribed nonbenzodiazepines (2.3% in 1993 to 13.7% of Americans in 2010), less often prescribed benzodiazepines (23.5% in 1993 to 10.8% in 2010). It is not clear {{as to whether the}} new nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics (Z-drugs) are better than the short-acting benzodiazepines. The efficacy of these two groups of medications is similar. According to the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, indirect comparison indicates that side-effects from benzodiazepines may be about twice as frequent as from nonbenzodiazepines. Some experts suggest using nonbenzodiazepines preferentially as a first-line <b>long-term</b> <b>treatment</b> of insomnia. However, the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence did not find any convincing evidence in favor of Z-drugs. NICE review pointed out that short-acting Z-drugs were inappropriately compared in clinical trials with long-acting benzodiazepines. There have been no trials comparing short-acting Z-drugs with appropriate doses of short-acting benzodiazepines. Based on this, NICE recommended choosing the hypnotic based on cost and the patient's preference.|$|E

40|$|Within pharmacovigilance, {{knowledge}} of time-to-onset (time from start of drug administration to onset of reaction) {{is important in}} causality assessment of drugs and suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and may indicate pharmacological mechanisms involved. It {{has been suggested that}} time-to-onset from individual case reports can be used for detection of safety signals. However, some ADRs only occur during treatment, while those that do occur later {{are less likely to be}} reported. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of treatment duration on the reported time-to-onset. Case reports from the WHO Global ICSR database, VigiBase, up until February 5 (th) 2010 were the basis of this study. To examine the effect of duration of treatment on reported time-to-onset, angioedema and hepatitis were selected to represent short and long latency ADRs, respectively. The reported time-to-onset for each of these ADRs was contrasted for a set of drugs expected to be used short- or long-term, respectively. The study included 2, 980 unique reports for angioedema and 1, 159 for hepatitis. Median reported time-to-onset for angioedema in short-term treatments ranged 0 - 1 days (median 0. 5), for angioedema in <b>long-term</b> <b>treatments</b> 0 - 26 days (median 8), for hepatitis in short-term treatments 4 - 12 days (median 7. 5) and for hepatitis in long term treatments 19 - 73 days (median 28).

40|$|<b>Long-term</b> <b>treatments</b> {{with the}} σ ligand {{haloperidol}} decrease {{the density of}} σ receptors in mammalian CNS. We have shown that σ ligands, such as di(2 -tolyl) guanidin (DTG), potentiate dose-dependently, with bell-shaped dose-response curves, the neuronal response of pyramidal neurones to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) in the CA 3 region of the rat dorsal hippocampus. σ Ligands producing such a potentiation were denoted ‘agonists'. This potentiation was suppressed by low doses of other σ ligands denoted ‘antagonists'. High doses of DTG and JO- 1784 did not modify the NMDA response but acted as ‘antagonists' by suppressing the potentiation induced by σ ‘agonists'. Following a 21 -day treatment with haloperidol {{as well as with}} high doses of DTG or JO- 1784, after a 48 [*]h washout, the acute administration of σ ‘agonists' failed to induce any potentiation of the NMDA response. Following a 21 day treatment with a low dose of DTG or JO- 1784, after a 48 [*]h washout, the neuronal response to microiontophoretic applications of NMDA was markedly increased. A 21 day treatment with low or high doses of (+) -pentazocine, after a 48 [*]h washout, did not produce any change. Following a two day treatment with a high dose of haloperidol, DTG, JO- 1784 and (+) -pentazocine, after a 24 [*]h washout, the potentiation of the NMDA response induced by the acute administration of the σ ‘agonists' was unchanged. With the minipumps on board, with DTG and JO- 1784, a dose-dependent enhancement of the NMDA response was seen but no effect was observed in the groups of rats treated at the same doses with haloperidol or (+) -pentazocine. The present data suggest that <b>long-term</b> <b>treatments</b> with σ ‘antagonists' induce a desensitization of the σ receptors, whereas <b>long-term</b> <b>treatments</b> with σ ‘agonists' induce a supersensitivity of the σ receptors...|$|R
