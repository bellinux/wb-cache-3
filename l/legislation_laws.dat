5000|$|The task of {{replacing}} Spanish <b>legislation</b> <b>laws</b> for another, appropriate to modern republican times, {{had been almost}} forgotten. The country was governed by laws which were established by the King of Spain as they were old laws, functioning since before independence.

50|$|This understanding, however, only {{captures the}} sense in which the {{reproduction}} of labour power comes at no cost to capitalists, like the reproduction of ecological conditions, but unlike the reproduction of, say, machine bolts and plastic wrap. Elites and governments have always sought to actively intervene or mediate in the process of the reproduction of labour power, through family <b>legislation,</b> <b>laws</b> regulating sexual conduct, medical provisions, education policies, and housing policies. Such interventions always carry an economic cost, but that cost can be socialized or forced upon workers themselves, especially women. In these areas of civil society, there has been a constant battle between conservatives, social reformists and radicals.|$|E

5000|$|The {{start of}} the 20th century {{continued}} to see rapid growth {{in the establishment of}} public libraries. During the late 19th century, the General Federation of Women's Clubs (GFWC) was formed. This national organization became one of the main advocates for free public libraries in the United States. In 1904, Mrs. Charles A. Perkins wrote, in the Federation Bulletin (the official organ of the GFWC), that [...] "clubs had established 474 free public libraries." [...] In order to start these libraries, clubwomen would advocate for various forms of <b>legislation.</b> <b>Laws</b> were needed to enable municipalities to provide tax support to libraries. The lobbying for this legislation created state commissions. Clubwomen would also raise money by utilizing their own skills through bake sales, entertainments, and other small-scale fund-raising events. Books were collected through donations or purchased from the funds earned by the clubs.|$|E

The members are elected from the 19 counties for 4-year terms according to a system of proportional representation. Until 2009, the Storting divided itself into two chambers, the Odelsting and the Lagting {{for the sole purpose of}} voting on <b>legislation.</b> <b>Laws</b> were proposed by the government through a Member of the Council of State or by a member of the Odelsting and decided on by the Odelsting and Lagting, in case of repeated disagreement by the joint Storting. In practice, the Lagting rarely disagreed and mainly just rubber-stamped the Odelsting's decision. In February 2007, the Storting passed a constitutional amendment to repeal the division, which abolished the Lagting for the 2009 general election, thereby establishing a fully unicameral system.|$|E
