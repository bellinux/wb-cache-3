25|$|In Chamber of Secrets, Nick is {{a victim}} of the Basilisk that Ginny Weasley unleashes under the {{influence}} of Tom Riddle. The stare of the Basilisk is lethal to anyone who looks it directly in the eye. All of its living victims meet its gaze indirectly, either from a reflection or by seeing it through something else, and are only petrified rather than killed. Nick is the only one to <b>look</b> <b>directly</b> <b>at</b> the Basilisk, but he too is petrified since he is a ghost and cannot die again. Nick also protected Hufflepuff student Justin Finch-Fletchley from death after Justin saw the basilisk's eyes through Nick's transparent body, thus only petrifying him as well.|$|E

He stated that [...] "persons with normal sight can <b>look</b> <b>directly</b> <b>at</b> the sun, or at the strongest artificial light, without injury or discomfort," [...] and gave several examples of patients' vision purportedly improving after sungazingthis is at variance with the well-known risk of eye damage that can result from direct sunlight observation.|$|E
500|$|There is a {{horizontal}} band separating the foreground and background, whose {{function is to}} separate the Holy Family from the background figures and St. John the Baptist. The background figures are five nudes, whose meaning and function are subject to much speculation and debate. [...] The Holy Family is much larger in size than the nudes in the background, and {{there appears to be}} water in between the land where the Holy Family and the nudes are situated. [...] The Holy Family all gaze at Christ, but none of the nudes <b>look</b> <b>directly</b> <b>at</b> him. [...] The far background contains a landscape.|$|E

500|$|Bates said that, just as {{one should}} not attempt to run a {{marathon}} without training, one should not immediately <b>look</b> <b>directly</b> <b>at</b> the sun, but he suggested {{that it could be}} worked up to. He acknowledged that looking at the sun could have ill effects, but characterized them as being [...] "always temporary" [...] and in fact the effects of strain in response to sunlight. He wrote that he had cured people who believed that the sun had caused them permanent eye damage. In his magazine, Bates later suggested exposing only the white part of the eyeball to direct sunlight, and only for seconds at a time, after allowing the sun to shine on closed eyelids for a longer period.|$|E
500|$|The {{painting}} marks {{a departure}} from conventional and contemporary European epitaphs by placing the saints and mortal donor within the same pictorial space. Van der Paele kneels {{to the right of}} the Virgin and Child and seems a somewhat distracted and absent-minded figure. This is intentional, an indication that he is, in the words of art historian Bret Rothstein, [...] "disconnected from the perceptible world", and fully absorbed in the spiritual realm. This notion is reinforced by his glasses which, although they imply education, wealth and learning, also allude to fallibility of the human, earthly senses. In keeping with the conventions of late medieval art, van der Paele does not <b>look</b> <b>directly</b> <b>at</b> any of the heavenly figures, but stares into the middle distance, observing social and spiritual decorum.|$|E
500|$|The Entombment shows Christ's body, {{wrapped in}} a white linen shroud and still wearing a crown of thorns, as it is lowered into a deep stone tomb. He is {{attended}} by seven mourners dressed in contemporary clothing. Among the group of mourners standing at Christ's side, the three female figures are shown with downcast eyes while the two men <b>look</b> <b>directly</b> <b>at</b> Christ; these gazes are reversed with the couple kneeling at his feet. The background contains a wide landscape with a winding pathway and a broad river before a more distant vista of trees and hills. Bouts is considered an innovative painter of landscapes, even in his portrait work where they are included as distant views seen through open windows. The vista in The Entombment is {{regarded as one of}} his finest, and is typically [...] composed of distant brown and green hills against a blue sky.|$|E

500|$|Many {{aspects of}} Las Meninas relate to earlier works by Velázquez {{in which he}} plays with {{conventions}} of representation. In the Rokeby Venus—his only surviving nude—the face of the subject is visible, blurred beyond any realism, in a mirror. The angle of the mirror is such that although [...] "often described as looking at herself, [...] is more disconcertingly looking at us". In the early Christ in the House of Martha and Mary of 1618, Christ and his companions are seen only through a serving hatch to a room behind, according to the National Gallery (London), who are {{clear that this is}} the intention, although before restoration many art historians regarded this scene as either a painting hanging on the wall in the main scene, or a reflection in a mirror, and the debate has continued. The dress worn in the two scenes also differs: the main scene is in contemporary dress, while the scene with Christ uses conventional iconographic biblical dress. This is also a feature of Los Borrachos of 1629, where contemporary peasants consort with the god Bacchus and his companions, who have the conventional undress of mythology. In this, as in some of his early bodegones, the figures <b>look</b> <b>directly</b> <b>at</b> the viewer as if seeking a reaction.|$|E
500|$|The centre {{foreground}} shows a {{group of}} five mourners, with three other figures set {{to the right and}} left. In the center group, John the Evangelist supports the Virgin Mary, surrounded by three women. Mary's dramatic swoon in grief pushes her forward in the pictorial space, and according to Smith, places her [...] "closest to the viewer's presumed position". Dressed in an enveloping blue robe that hides most of her face, she collapses and is caught by John, who supports her by her arms. Mary Magdalene kneels to the right, dressed in a white-trimmed green robe and red sleeves. Raising her arms aloft, she clenches her fingers in a distraught, agonised manner. She is the only figure from this group shown to <b>look</b> <b>directly</b> <b>at</b> Christ and serves as one of the key painterly devices to direct the viewer's gaze upwards towards the crosses. The fourth and fifth mourners have been identified as prophesying sibyls, and stand to the far left and right of the centre group. The sibyl to the left faces the cross {{with her back to the}} viewer while the turbaned mourner on the right faces the group and is either the Erythraean or the Cumaean sibyl, both of whom are attributed in Christian tradition with warning the occupying Romans of the cult of redemption that would develop around Christ's death and resurrection. She has an almost indifferent expression that has been interpreted both as satisfaction at seeing her prophesies realised, and as compassionate contemplation of the other women's grief.|$|E

2500|$|According to Steinberg, the {{reversed}} gaze, that is, {{the fact}} that the figures <b>look</b> <b>directly</b> <b>at</b> the viewer, as well as the idea of the self-possessed woman, no longer there solely for the pleasure of the male gaze, may be traced back to Manet's Olympia of 1863. William Rubin (1927–2006), the former Director of the Department of Painting and Sculpture at MoMA wrote that [...] "Steinberg was the first writer {{to come to grips with}} the sexual subject of the Demoiselles." ...|$|E

2500|$|Good fliers such as flies or honey bees, or prey-catching insects such as {{praying mantis}} or dragonflies, have {{specialised}} zones of ommatidia organised into a fovea area which gives acute vision. In the acute zone, {{the eyes are}} flattened and the facets larger. The flattening allows more ommatidia to receive light from a spot and therefore higher resolution. The black spot {{that can be seen}} on the compound eyes of such insects, which always seems to <b>look</b> <b>directly</b> <b>at</b> the observer, is called a pseudopupil. This occurs because the ommatidia which one observes [...] "head-on" [...] (along their optical axes) absorb the incident light, while those to one side reflect it.|$|E

2500|$|Eye {{floaters}} {{are suspended}} in the vitreous humour, the thick fluid or gel that fills the eye. The vitreous humour, or vitreous body, is a jelly-like, transparent substance that fills {{a majority of the}} eye. It lies within the vitreous chamber behind the lens, {{and is one of the}} four optical components of the eye. Thus, floaters follow the rapid motions of the eye, while drifting slowly within the fluid. When they are first noticed, the natural reaction is to attempt to <b>look</b> <b>directly</b> <b>at</b> them. However, attempting to shift one's gaze toward them can be difficult as floaters follow the motion of the eye, remaining to the side of the direction of gaze. Floaters are, in fact, visible only because they do not remain perfectly fixed within the eye. Although the blood vessels of the eye also obstruct light, they are invisible under normal circumstances because they are fixed in location relative to the retina, and the brain [...] "tunes out" [...] stabilized images due to neural adaptation. This stabilization is often interrupted by floaters, especially when they tend to remain visible.|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the next}} several years she {{continued}} to create illustrations for magazines, including a series of Mother Goose illustrations printed in Good Housekeeping which were made in black and white until mid-1914 when they were printed in color. Her illustrations were reproduced in the book The Jessie Willcox Smith Mother Goose by Dodd, Mead, and Company. The book that reflected her continued theme of mother and child in a realistic portrayal was a commercial success. Biographer Edward D. Nudelman wrote, [...] "The cover illustration for this book, showing two children nestled beneath the wings of Mother Goose, is one of Smith's most pleasing and warm images. The serenity portrayed in the posture and expression of the children, along with the material concern of Mother Goose, gives evidence of the genius of Smith." [...] Smith had a knack for painting children, persuasively using milk, cookies and fairy tales to achieve a relaxed, focused, child model. In her October 1917 Good Housekeeping article she wrote that [...] "A child will always <b>look</b> <b>directly</b> <b>at</b> anyone who is telling a story; so while I paint I tell tales marvelous to hear." [...] In 1915 Smith finished one of her most well known works for Charles Kingsley's The Water-Babies.|$|E
