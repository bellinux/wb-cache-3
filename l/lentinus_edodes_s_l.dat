Irradiation with 2 kGy increased the eight-carbon volatile components of fresh shiitake, Treatment at 1 kGy irradiation of fresh shiitake produced some new volatile compounds in the dry product, such as methylethyl disulphide, sulphinylbis methane, methyl(methylthio) ethyl disulphide and N-(3 -methylbutyl) acetamide. The eight-carbon compounds mostly disappeared after drying. The amount of sulphur-containing volatile compounds in dried shiitake became lower during irradiation.

Among the other compounds, the OMW contain small amounts of lipids (about 2 % dry weight), mostly represented by oleic and palmitic acids, which could stimulate fungal growth. The effect of OMW on <b>Lentinus</b> <b>edodes</b> (Berk.) <b>Sing.</b> growth and production of laccase and Mn-peroxidase on liquid and solid cultures media was tested in the studies described in this article.

MethodsMice were injected H 22 cells and then treated with either 5 -FU, polysaccharides from Tricholoma matsutake (PTM), polysaccharides from <b>Lentinus</b> <b>edodes</b> (PL), PTM + PL, 5 -FU + PTM, 5 -FU + PL, or 5 -FU + COP.

Additionally, splenic natural killer (NK) cell and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activities were assessed and the serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), Interleukin- 2 (IL- 2), and Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) were measured. ResultsCompared with mice from the control, 5 -FU, PL, PTM, PTM + PL, 5 -FU + PL, and 5 -FU + PTM groups, mice treated with 5 -FU + COP showed: (a) significantly reduced tumor weight and volume (P< 0. 05); (b) significantly higher serum levels of TNF-α, IL- 2, and IFN-γ (P< 0. 05); (c) significantly increased CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cell frequencies in the spleen (P< 0. 05); and (d) significantly increased splenic NK cell and CTL activities (P< 0. 05). The tumor weight and volume in mice treated with 5 -FU+PL or 5 -FU+PTM were significantly reduced compared with mice treated with 5 -FU alone (P< 0. 05).
