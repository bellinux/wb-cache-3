5000|$|Two more coaches without {{separate}} smoking compartments {{were purchased}} in 1915. These coaches had less powerful [...] traction motors and were incapable {{of the speed}} required for express service. They were used exclusively for the slower schedules making local stops. Powered box express cars operated as extra trains making two round trips daily handling <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>carload</b> <b>freight</b> including cans of raw milk from rural dairy farms to a Portland milk processor. The Baldwin electric locomotive ran on these extra runs with a PLI boxcar when {{there were a few}} PLI stock cars of cattle or bulky loads for PLI's ten flatcars.|$|E
50|$|Express {{service was}} {{passenger}} sized cars carrying <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>carload</b> <b>freight.</b> From 1903 a 2-car newspaper train left Chicago {{in the early}} morning and delivered papers to most stops. This train, sometimes using passenger cars, lasted until the end of service. Aso {{in the early morning}} “milk trains”, often an express car pulling a boxcar, made a trip east. These trains picked up milk cans from farms along the line and brought them to a dairy in Chicago, then returned them in the afternoon. This service lost most of it's business to trucks and ended in the 1920s. Other express trains ran during the day, and did local switching.|$|E

5000|$|The {{building}} {{was designed by}} Lusby Simpson of Abbott, Merkt & Co. and completed in 1932. The building had a multipurpose design {{when it opened in}} 1932 with the first floor and basement designated as [...] "Union Inland Terminal #1" [...] which was to be used to transport goods by truck to and from railroad lines and/or shipping piers. The second floor was the Commerce section designed for exhibitions and the upper floors were designed for manufacturing. The Union Inland Terminal was built by the Port Authority to be a warehouse/union station to handle <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>carload</b> (LCL) shipments, consolidating the shipping functions of the Hudson River piers two blocks west of the building, the eight trunk railroads that operated a block west of the building and truck operations (an inland terminal by definition is a warehouse that is not immediately next to railroad lines/piers but is nearby and is used to relieve congestion at the transfer points).|$|R
5000|$|Dominion Express Company {{was formed}} {{independently}} in 1873 before the CPR itself, although train service {{did not begin}} until the summer of 1882 at which time it operated over some 300 mi of track from Rat Portage (Kenora) Ontario west to Winnipeg, Manitoba. It was soon absorbed into the CPR and expanded everywhere the CPR went. It was renamed Canadian Express Company on 1 September 1926, and the headquarters moved from Winnipeg, to Toronto. It was operated as a separate company with the railway charging them to haul express cars on trains. Express was handled in separate cars, some with employees on board, on the headend of passenger trains to provide a fast scheduled service for which higher rates could be charged <b>than</b> for LCL (<b>Less</b> <b>than</b> <b>Carload</b> Lot), small shipments of freight which were subject to delay. Aside from all sorts of small shipments {{for all kinds of}} businesses such products as cream, butter, poultry and eggs were handled along with fresh flowers, fish and other sea foods some handled in separate refrigerated cars. Horses and livestock along with birds and small animals including prize cattle for exhibition were carried often in special horse cars that had facilities for grooms to ride with their animals.|$|R

25|$|The Final Tier I Draft Environmental Impact Statement {{recommends}} {{further study}} of two alternatives: enhanced rail float operations {{and the most}} basic rail tunnel among the tunnel alternatives. While the rail float alternative is expected to produce less freight tonnage diversion than the tunnel (2.8 million tons per year vs 9.6), its costs are dramatically less, $175 million vs. $7.2 billion. The EIS recommends a phased approach, starting by building enhanced float service for <b>carload</b> <b>freight,</b> adding capacity for intermodal traffic, developing needed intermodal facilities on Long Island and finally planning and building the rail freight tunnel.|$|R
50|$|The company {{entered into}} {{agreements}} with the P&LE in 1904 and with the PRR in 1905 to switch <b>carload</b> <b>freight</b> to industries located between South 3rd St and South 21st Street. Loads came from the P&LE yard at South 10th St and the PRR yard at South 21st St. The company was reimbursed $1 per car by the PRR {{and the cost of}} the service performed by the P&LE. Because of the additional traffic, Baldwin 0-6-0T number 4 (contract 34710 of 1910), ALCo (Pittsburgh) 0-4-0T number 5 (contract 39950 of 1906) and 0-6-0T number 6 (contract 42745 of 1907) were delivered.|$|R
5|$|With {{increasing}} {{competition from}} trucks and automobiles in the 1920s, passenger volume {{began to decline}} along with less-than-carload freight, such as milk from the many dairy farms along the Ma and Pa's pastoral route. The Ma and Pa substituted more economical, self-propelled gas-electric passenger cars for steam-powered passenger trains in 19271928. <b>Carload</b> <b>freight</b> volume increased in the 1920s, however, as more industries located along the line, and earnings were strong enough {{for the company to}} declare dividends in 1930 and 1931. The Ma and Pa's relative prosperity ended with the economic downturn during the Great Depression, which cut the railroad's gross revenues by half from 1932 to 1935.|$|R
40|$|Efficient {{and correct}} freight train {{marshalling}} {{is vital for}} high quality <b>carload</b> <b>freight</b> transportations. During marshalling, it is desirable that cars are sorted according to their individual drop-off locations in the outbound freight trains. Furthermore, practical limitations such as non-uniform and limited track lengths and the arrival and departure times of trains need to be considered. This paper presents a novel optimisation method for freight marshalling scheduling under these circumstances. The method {{is based on an}} integer programming formulation that is solved using column generation and branch and price. The approach minimises the number of extra shunting operations that have to be performed, and is evaluated on real-world data from the Hallsberg marshalling yard in Sweden. RanPla...|$|R

Mostly <b>carload</b> <b>freight</b> was being shipped on the line by this point, with almost no need anymore for station and team track facilities. The remaining freight houses were a liability at this point, being very old and needing immediate attention. The freight house at Wrightstown was removed, and in Davis, the combination freight and passenger building was also removed. The Cream Ridge freight house was removed in January 1943. When the PRR took over operations, the much needed upgrades could take place, and the needed maintenance could finally be performed. Much of the line was upgraded from the original 65 lb rail to 85 lb rail, and several bridges were quickly upgraded.|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} the polynomial time version, in short <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to(T) (P) -introreducibility, {{of the notion}} of introreducibility studied in Recursion Theory.

Our proof generalizes to virtually all the computation bounded reducibilities <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to(r), showing that a set is <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to(r) -introreducible if and only if it belongs to the minimum <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to(r) -degree.
