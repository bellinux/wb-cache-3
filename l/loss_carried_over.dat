50|$|Bereavement, while {{a normal}} part of life for most people, carries a degree of risk when limited support is available. Severe {{reactions}} to <b>loss</b> may <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> into familial relations and cause trauma for children, spouses and any other family members. Issues of personal faith and beliefs may also face challenge, as bereaved persons reassess personal definitions in the face of great pain. While many who grieve are able to work through their loss independently, accessing additional support from bereavement professionals may promote the process of healing. Individual counseling, professional support groups or educational classes, and peer-lead support groups are primary resources available to the bereaved. In some regions local hospice agencies may be an important first contact for those seeking bereavement support.|$|R
5000|$|Carryover basis, also {{referred}} to as a transferred basis, applies to inter vivos gifts and transfers in trust. [...] Generally, a taxpayer's basis in property is the cost to acquire the property. [...] However, there is an exception for inter vivos gifts and transfers in trust. [...] For gifts, to calculate a gain, the donee has the same basis in the property as the donor's adjusted basis in the property. [...] The same rule applies for calculating a loss, unless the donor's adjusted basis is greater than the fair market value of the property {{at the time of the}} gift. [...] In this case, the <b>loss</b> does not <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> and the basis is the fair market value of the property at the time of the gift.|$|R
40|$|Sixty-eight micronekton and {{macroplankton}} samples collected with a 3 m Isaacs-Kidd Midwater Trawl were preserved {{with ten}} percent buffered formaldehyde solution. An investigation of wet weight <b>loss</b> was <b>carried</b> out <b>over</b> {{a period of}} 7 months.

40|$|The {{abstract}} describes {{experiments with}} different cropping systems for organic greenhouse production of tomatoes. In this experiment two main questions are adressed. As greenhouse tomato production {{is a very}} intensive monoculture production, problems with nutrient supply and balances are expected, and problems with soilborne pests and diseases are widespread. To counter such problems, we compare the normal method of soil grown tomatoes with systems where tomatoes are grown in compost filled boxes. This allows to control nutrient <b>losses</b> and prevent <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> of diseses and pests in the soil. We also study an intermediate system, where where tomatoes are established in compost filled boxes, but the roots are allowed to develop also in the soil outside the boxes. This system seems to combine the main advantages of growing either directly in the soil or in the closed boxes. The other main {{question is whether the}} high nutrient demand by the tomatoe crops can be met by plant based materials, rather than by animal manure. The results suggest that suggest that all or at least most of the nutrient supply can be based on plant residues...|$|R
30|$|Recognizing the {{existence}} of <b>loss</b> <b>carried</b> forward and carried backward in the US corporate tax system, Mackie–Mason (1990) analysed {{the effects of the}} marginal tax rate on debt policy. He found that when a company has <b>loss</b> <b>carried</b> forward and investment tax credit (i.e., another tax shield), it is less likely to raise capital by new debt issue. Since both existing <b>loss</b> <b>carried</b> forward and investment tax credit are substitutes for new debt issue in terms of tax savings, this result is consistent with the trade-off theory.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Prototype {{conductors}} for the ITER magnets {{have been}} tested extensively in the SULTAN facility at CRPP in the last decade. The in depth characterization of the high current carrying conductors provided a valuable feedback in the design, with performance optimization and cost reduction. From the transient stability results, the temperature margin required to withstand the plasma disruption {{has been found to}} be much smaller than originally assumed. A comparison between two specially designed conductors showed that the copper fraction in the superconducting Nb 3 Sn composite can be reduced without affecting the stability, leading to a substantial reduction of the overall amount of superconducting composite to be procured for the ITER magnets. AC <b>loss</b> measurements <b>carried</b> out <b>over</b> a broad range of frequency, brought evidence of two regimes of losses, complementing the test results of the ITER model coils and indicating that the correct eddy currents loss to be retained in the design for plasma disruption and initiation is much smaller than the value extrapolated from the slow charge of the model coils. Other results on current distribution, cyclic load and joint performance are briefly reported...|$|R

40|$|Task {{demands that}} {{influence}} scanning behaviour in one task can cause that behaviour to persist {{to a second}} unrelated task (<b>carry</b> <b>over).</b> This can also affect performance on a second task (e. g., hazard perception ratings), and {{has been attributed to}} a process of attentional bias that is modulated by top-down influences (Thompson & Crundall, 2011). In a series of experiments we explored how these top-down influences impact upon <b>carry</b> <b>over.</b> In all experiments, participants searched letters that were presented horizontally, vertically, or in a random array. They were then presented with a driving scene and rated the hazardousness of the scene. <b>Carry</b> <b>over</b> of eye-movements from the letter search to the scene was observed in all experiments. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that this <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> effect influenced hazard perception accuracy. The magnitude of <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> was correlated with task switching abilities, attentional conflicting, and attentional orienting (Experiment 1), and was affected by predictability of the primary task (Experiment 2). Furthermore, direct current stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and parietal areas affected the magnitude of the effect (Experiment 3). These results indicate that <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> is modulated by the specific ability to orient attention and disengage from this orientation. Over orienting leads to increased <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> and insufficient task switching is detrimental to task performance. As a result the current experiments provide evidence that the <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> effect is strongly influenced by attentional processes, namely orienting, inhibition, and task switching...|$|R
50|$|A group {{relief is}} {{available}} {{independently of the}} seat of a company within the EU. Therefore, the CCCTB implies a consolidation of losses and profits within the group. The allocation of the overall profit would not be determined by separate accounting but by the formula. Because of EU-wide consolidation of profits and losses, each Member State bears a subsidiary's loss in proportion to {{its share of the}} overall profit. Acceptance of foreign losses by Member States is thus easier to attain. Because of the consolidation of the EU-wide operations of the firm, it is sensible to assume that there are sufficient profits to absorb losses of group members. Hence, an immediate cross-border loss compensation is available, making interest and liquidity disadvantages disappear. In the case of an overall <b>loss,</b> a <b>loss</b> <b>carry</b> forward and a <b>loss</b> <b>carry</b> back must exist in each Member State. The European Commission proposes an unlimited <b>loss</b> <b>carry</b> forward. However, whether group relief for third countries, i.e., non-EU countries, is available, depends on national legislation.|$|R

40|$|A {{consolidated}} {{filing of}} {{corporate income tax}} may induce firms to manipulate ownership interests in subsidiaries but no study has systematically examined such behavioral responses. This paper examines empirically inclusions/exclusions of subsidiaries to/from consolidation groups in a quasi-experiment that utilizes the Japanese tax reform of 2002. The identification of tax effects {{is based on a}} difference-in-difference strategy that exploits disincentives to consolidate subsidiaries with <b>losses</b> <b>carried</b> forward. The data consists of 37, 000 - 40, 000 subsidiary-time observations spanning biennially over 1988 - 2006. The result shows that <b>losses</b> <b>carried</b> forward significantly reduced the propensity to include subsidiaries to consolidation groups. No evidence on tax-motivated exclusion is found. This result suggests that the forced consolidation regime is preferable. ...|$|R
40|$|Tax {{avoidance}} is {{an interesting}} strategy option taken by management which aims to increase profitability through the reduction of corporate tax expense. This research has a purpose to examine the influence of ownership structures financial distress, and tax <b>loss</b> <b>carry</b> forward on tax avoidance using secondary data from financial statement of manufacturing companies listed on IDX year 2012 - 2014. The study type {{used in this study}} is hypothesis testing.

40|$|Simulated {{marginal}} {{tax rates}} involve complex calculations of simulating future (uncertain) incomes and mimicking corporate tax code. This paper develops two algorithms to calculate simulated marginal tax rate. The codes {{have been developed}} to forecast future taxable income of Indian companies and their Marginal Tax Rates (MTR) using Monte Carlo simulation in MATLAB. <b>Loss</b> <b>carry</b> forward and minimum alternate tax rules have been incorporated in both the algorithms. Further, a change is made in both the algorithms to incorporate <b>loss</b> <b>carry</b> backward feature to suit the needs of the country where such laws are applicable. The 10000 simulations in MATLAB suggest that MTR is company specific and it is dependent on the income pattern of the company. The MTR increases when <b>loss</b> <b>carry</b> backward rule is applied. In cases where the company actually pays zero tax in a year due to incurred losses, it is found that even in such cases MTR may be non zero. It is found that there is enough cross sectional and time series variations in MTR, therefore, the effect of tax rates on various policy issues of government and companies can be studied by taking MTR as an effective proxy for tax rates. ...|$|R
