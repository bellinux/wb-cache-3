They would have to navigate through Japanese-occupied territory, find food, and as few internees spoke Cantonese, they {{would also have to}} deal with the <b>language</b> <b>barrier</b> if they succeeded in escaping. Despite these difficulties, there were three major escape attempts, of which two in March 1942 were successful. One group of eight internees escaped on a small boat to neighbouring Macau. Another group, consisting of two internees, escaped through the New Territories and into mainland China. The third group, four policemen, in April 1942 managed to escape the camp grounds but were caught within a few miles of camp. They were subsequently imprisoned and released back to camp after a few weeks.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Despite {{evidence}} from other healthcare settings that <b>language</b> <b>barriers</b> negatively impact patient outcomes, {{the literature on}} <b>language</b> <b>barriers</b> in emergency medical services (EMS) has not been previously summarized. The objective {{of this study is}} to systematically review existing studies of the impact of <b>language</b> <b>barriers</b> on prehospital emergency care and identify opportunities for future research.   Methods: A systematic review with narrative synthesis of publications with populations specific to the prehospital setting and outcome measures specific to <b>language</b> <b>barriers</b> was conducted. A four-prong search strategy of academic databases (PubMed, Academic Search Complete, and Clinical Key) through March 2015, web-based search for gray literature, search of citation lists, and review of key conference proceedings using pre-defined eligibility criteria was used. Language-related outcomes were categorized and reported as community-specific outcomes, EMS provider-specific outcomes, patient-specific outcomes, or health system-specific outcomes. Results: Twenty-two studies met eligibility criteria for review. Ten publications (45 %) focused on community-specific outcomes. <b>Language</b> <b>barriers</b> are perceived as a <b>barrier</b> by minority <b>language</b> speaking communities to activating EMS. Eleven publications (50 %) reported outcomes specific to EMS providers, with six of these studies focused on EMS dispatch. EMS dispatchers describe less accurate and delayed dispatch of resources when confronted with language discordant callers, as well as limitations in the ability to provide medical direction to callers. There is a paucity of research on EMS treatment and transport decisions, and no studies provided patient-specific or health system-specific outcomes. Key research gaps include identifying the mechanisms by which <b>language</b> <b>barriers</b> impact care, the effect of <b>language</b> <b>barriers</b> on EMS utilization and clinically significant outcomes, and the cost implications of addressing <b>language</b> <b>barriers.</b> Conclusion: The existing research on prehospital <b>language</b> <b>barriers</b> is largely exploratory, and substantial gaps in understanding the interaction between <b>language</b> <b>barriers</b> and prehospital care have yet to be addressed.

The objective is to compare Ireland, as a context responding to the new challenge of <b>language</b> <b>barriers</b> in healthcare, and England, as {{a context in which}} the management of <b>language</b> <b>barriers</b> is being re-assessed. Methods Empirical data from two action research studies in Ireland and England are compared.

Results Key findings are that the same range of formal and informal responses to <b>language</b> <b>barriers</b> occurs in practice in both contexts but proportions of knowledge and use of these responses differ. English service providers have more awareness about the use of formal responses than Irish service providers but uptake of formal responses remains low in both contexts.

5|$|Aside from Æthelberht's {{granting}} {{of freedom of}} worship to his wife, the choice of Kent was probably dictated {{by a number of}} other factors. Kent was the dominant power in southeastern Britain. Since the eclipse of King Ceawlin of Wessex in 592, Æthelberht was the leading Anglo-Saxon ruler; Bede refers to Æthelberht as having imperium (overlordship) south of the River Humber. Trade between the Franks and Æthelberht's kingdom was well established, and the <b>language</b> <b>barrier</b> between the two regions was apparently only a minor obstacle, as the interpreters for the mission came from the Franks. Lastly, Kent's proximity to the Franks allowed support from a Christian area. There is some evidence, including Gregory's letters to Frankish kings in support of the mission, that some of the Franks felt that they had a claim to overlordship over some of the southern British kingdoms at this time. The presence of a Frankish bishop could also have lent credence to claims of overlordship, if Bertha's Bishop Liudhard was felt to be acting {{as a representative of the}} Frankish church and not merely as a spiritual advisor to the queen. Frankish influence was not merely political; archaeological remains attest to a cultural influence as well.|$|E

On the night of 17–18 March, the 390th and 398th were moved up to their jumping-off positions in the area of Korpech village. The attacks of the two divisions began at 10:00 on 18 March, and the 390th, advancing in conjunction with the 55th Tank Brigade, overcame German resistance and captured two trench lines of the German main defensive line. By the end of the day, they had dug in on the new positions. On the morning of 19 March, Zakian committed his reserve, the 784th Rifle Regiment, into the battle.

Thirty-five days into the shoot, Selvaraghavan gave a statement that the film was forty percent over and the film should release by May 2008 whilst also mentioning that rains in Kerala led to the budget going over expectations two months into the project. In January 2008, the unit moved to Jaisalmer in Rajasthan to shoot in the deserts in the region, however they were delayed again by unseasonal rains. Missing its original release date, the film's progress carried on through 2008, with shooting occurring {{towards the end of the}} year inside sets at Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad. In the studios, choreographer Shivshankar composed a classical dance for Reemma Sen and Parthiepan, and the sequence was shot over twenty days.

Shoots in all regions were tough and demanding for the crew as the film featured more than three thousand junior artistes from a variety of unions across India, with the <b>language</b> <b>barrier</b> becoming a problem.
