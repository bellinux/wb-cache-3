50|$|Rheinmetall Borsig {{proposed}} a new medium velocity gun with a smoothbore barrel that relied on hollow charge ammunition to defeat tanks. The design used the High-Low Pressure principle where the high pressures {{generated by the}} propellant did not act directly on the projectile but instead seeped into the main chamber at a controlled rate. This allowed a very simple <b>light-weight</b> <b>barrel</b> with a conventional heavy breech. A simple light-weight carriage was designed for the weapon.|$|E
5000|$|Efforts by John M. Browning and Fred T. Moore {{resulted}} in the water-cooled Browning machine gun, caliber [...]50, M1921. An aircraft version was termed the Browning aircraft machine gun, caliber [...]50, M1921. These guns were used experimentally from 1921 until 1937. They had <b>light-weight</b> <b>barrels</b> and the ammunition fed only from the left side. Service trials raised doubts whether the guns would be suitable for aircraft or for anti-aircraft use. A heavy barrel M1921 was considered for ground vehicles.|$|R
