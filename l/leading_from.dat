5|$|A nondeterministic {{algorithm}} {{for determining}} whether a 2-satisfiability instance is not satisfiable, using only a logarithmic amount of writable memory, is easy to describe: simply choose (nondeterministically) a variable v and search (nondeterministically) for a chain of implications <b>leading</b> <b>from</b> v to its negation {{and then back to}} v. If such a chain is found, the instance cannot be satisfiable. By the Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem, it is also possible in nondeterministic logspace to verify that a satisfiable 2-satisfiability instance is satisfiable.|$|E

5|$|Just outside Athol Springs, NY75 passes {{under two}} {{railroad}} bridges, carrying the Norfolk Southern Railway-owned Lake Erie District {{line and the}} CSX Transportation-owned Lake Shore Subdivision line over the highway.

The route continues on, passing south of Saint Francis High School before ending shortly afterward at a partial interchange with NY5. NY75 northbound merges directly into NY5 eastbound, a limited-access highway, while NY75 southbound begins as an offshoot of NY5 westbound.

5|$|Patton's {{colorful}} image, hard-driving {{personality and}} {{success as a}} commander were at times overshadowed by his controversial public statements. His philosophy of <b>leading</b> <b>from</b> the front {{and his ability to}} inspire troops with vulgarity-ridden speeches, such as a famous address to the Third Army, attracted favorable attention. His strong emphasis on rapid and aggressive offensive action proved effective. While Allied leaders held sharply differing opinions on Patton, he was regarded highly by his opponents in the German High Command. A popular, award-winning biographical film released in 1970 helped transform Patton into an American hero.|$|E
