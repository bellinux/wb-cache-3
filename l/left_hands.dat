He wears rich clothes (generally in sculpture, only a dhoti) {{as well as}} various ornaments like a crown, armbands, necklaces etc., symbolic of royalty and the yagnopavita (sacred thread). In his eight arms, he is prescribed in the texts to carry gada (mace), sword, arrow and the Sudarshana Chakra in his <b>left</b> <b>hands</b> and shankha (conch), shield, bow and lotus in his right hands. However, in sculpture, he is often four-armed and in two of his hands, he holds a lotus and a conch, while his other hands rest on the heads of his personified weapons (ayudhapurusha) - Gadadevi or Gadanari (gada as a female) on his right and Chakrapurusha on his left, who stand as small figures besides his legs. They both look upwards towards him and hold fly whisks. A tiny figurine of the earth goddess Prithvi (who associated with Varaha and Vishnu as his consort) rises from the pedestal in between his feet, as though supporting the deity. A short dagger or sword may be tucked up in the waist belt of the god near the right hip, a peculiar feature of Kashmir icons. Attendants or devotees may be also shown besides or below Vishnu. Sometimes, Brahma and Shiva and the ten avatars of Vishnu may be depicted in the background.|$|E

50|$|In the laboratory, {{a patient}} was given two {{different}} fabrics: a wire screen in his <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> {{and a piece}} of sandpaper in his right hand. The patient received two different fabrics out of his view so that neither eye nor hemisphere visually seen what his hands were given. When the patient was indicating what fabric was in the <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> he was able to correctly indicate and point with the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> to the wire screen after it had been set on a table. As he pointed with his <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> however, the right hand tried to stop the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> and make the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> point to the fabric that the right hand was holding. The <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> continued to point at the correct fabric, even though the right hand tried to forcefully move the <b>left</b> <b>hand.</b> During the struggle, the patient also verbalized feelings of animosity by saying, “That’s wrong!” and “I hate this hand”.

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, luthiers developed new methods of constructing the violin, viola and cello that gave these instruments a richer tone, more volume, and more carrying power. Also at this time, bowmakers made the violin bow longer, with a thicker ribbon of hair under higher tension. This improved projection, and also made possible new bowing techniques. In 1820, Louis Spohr invented the chinrest, which gave violinists more freedom of movement in their <b>left</b> <b>hands,</b> for a more nimble technique. These changes contributed to the effectiveness of public performances in large halls, and expanded the repertoire of techniques available to chamber music composers.|$|E

25|$|Other riots {{include the}} Hong Kong 1967 riots which began when {{internal}} conflict within the Communist party in China {{resulted in the}} Cultural Revolution. Pro-communist leftists in Hong Kong challenged British rule. Demonstrations were held, the red guards would take shape in Hong Kong carrying Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong in their <b>left</b> <b>hands</b> shouting communist slogans. The People's Daily in Beijing ran editorials supporting the leftist struggle. Rumors spread that China was preparing {{to take over the}} colony. Political tension soared. The riots only came to an end in December 1967 when Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai ordered the leftist groups in Hong Kong to stop. After the riot, the government made an effort to clean up any existing communist networks. The radio host Lam Bun was also murdered.|$|E

25|$|On 5 December 2009 Martínez fought Paul Williams in a non-title middleweight bout at Atlantic City's Boardwalk Hall in a {{fight that}} was later {{described}} as a fight of the year candidate. In the first round Williams and Martínez would both knock each other down once. Martínez would then seem to control the next two rounds with effective power punching. Then Williams seemed to narrowly {{take control of the}} fight when he seemingly won rounds 4, 5, 6 and 7 by landing hard <b>left</b> <b>hands</b> to the side of Martínez's head. Rounds 8–10 then signified that the fight would be close on the score-cards when Martínez won those rounds by repeating what he did in rounds 2 and 3. Then in the final 2 rounds (11–12), both fighters began to fade although the exchanges remained very closely contested, although Williams was far more active and therefore would seemingly win those final 2 rounds {{based on the fact that}} he was far more active in the last 2 rounds of the fight. That would turn out to be the case as Williams would escape with a majority decision victory with scores of 114–114, 119–110 (for Williams) and 115–113 (for Williams).|$|E
25|$|Shevardnadze's {{rapid rise}} in Soviet Georgia's {{political}} hierarchy {{was the result}} of his campaign against corruption. Throughout most of Shevardnadze's leadership, anti-corruption campaigns were central to his authority and policy. By the time Shevardnadze had become leader, Georgia was the Soviet republic most afflicted by corruption. The rule of Vasil Mzhavanadze had been characterised by weak leadership, nepotism, despotism, and bribery pervading the upper echelons of power. In Georgia, corruption had been allowed to thrive, leading to serious deformations in the system; for example only 68 per cent of Georgian goods were exported legally, while the percentage of goods exported legally from other Soviet Republics approached 100 per cent. Shevardnadze rallied support for his anti-corruption campaigns by establishing the Study of Public Opinion. To combat corruption, he engaged in subterfuge; after halting all exports he dressed himself as a peasant and drove a car filled with tomatoes through the border. After his personal subterfuge, the entire Georgian border police was purged. While never proven, it is said that after taking office, Shevardnadze asked all leading officials to show their <b>left</b> <b>hands</b> and ordered those who used Western-produced watches to replace them with Soviet ones. This story portrayed Shevardnadze as an active battler against corruption. His campaign against corruption was largely unsuccessful and when he returned to Georgia in 1992, corruption was still a huge problem.|$|E
500|$|There {{are many}} varied {{depictions of the}} {{different}} forms of Kaali. The most common shows her with four arms and hands, showing aspects of creation and destruction. The two right hands are often held out in blessing, one in a mudra saying [...] "fear not" [...] (abhayamudra), the other conferring boons. Her <b>left</b> <b>hands</b> hold a severed head and blood-covered sword. The sword severs the bondage of ignorance and ego, represented by the severed head. One interpretation of Kaali's tongue is that the red tongue symbolizes the rajasic nature being conquered by the white (symbolizing sattvic) nature of the teeth. Her blackness represents that she is nirguna, beyond all qualities of nature, and transcendent.|$|E

500|$|Although less {{dangerous}} than work below ground, some bal maidens suffered poor health. Tuberculosis and bronchitis were endemic in the mining communities, {{and would be}} exacerbated by constant exposure {{to high levels of}} mineral dust. Constant work with damp ore might have led to rheumatic problems. The extraction of arsenic from the tin and copper ores sometimes led to exposure to arsenic fumes. Constant bending, lifting, and carrying often led to muscular strains. The need to hold chunks of ore with one hand while hammering them with the other led to some bal maidens suffering permanent damage to their <b>left</b> <b>hands.</b> The noise generated by industrial machinery, particularly after the introduction of the steam engine, could cause hearing difficulties, with some groups of bal maidens developing private sign languages. Noxious fumes, notably arsenic, lead and antimony could cause [...] digestive problems, bowel disorders and amenorrhoea and other disruptions of the reproductive system. Barley hoggans also caused digestive problems.|$|E

Through flashbacks it is revealed that Shinra had wanted to build a Mako reactor in his home town of Corel, an idea Barret advocated. However, due to an accident at the plant, Shinra razed the town, killing Barret's wife in the process, and causing Barret and Dyne to flee with Dyne's daughter, Marlene. Cornered, Dyne slipped off a cliff and Barret grabbed his hand, but Shinra soldier's opened fire, and destroyed Barret's and Dyne's right and <b>left</b> <b>hands</b> respectively, causing the latter to fall to his presumed death. Barret adopted Marlene as his own daughter, had an [...] "adapter" [...] graft to his arm to interface with prosthetic weapons to aid in his combat against Shinra, and founded AVALANCHE. Dyne's death causes him to admit his grudge with Shinra is solely for revenge, with his earlier claims of [...] "saving the world" [...] meant only to convince himself he was fighting for the greater good. Barret eventually shifts his goal to actually wanting to save the Planet, doing so for Marlene's sake, and he helps Cloud and his allies defeat Sephiroth to prevent the Planet's destruction.|$|E
