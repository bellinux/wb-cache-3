5|$|In September 1978 Mugabe {{met with}} Nkomo in <b>Lusaka.</b> He was {{angry with the}} latter's secret {{attempts}} to negotiate with Smith.|$|E
5|$|Western Province was {{the largest}} among all provinces, having an area of 126,386km2, while <b>Lusaka</b> was the {{smallest}} with 21,896km2. <b>Lusaka</b> was the most populated and the most densely populated {{with a population of}} 2,191,225 and a density of 100 persons per km2. As of 2010, Western Province had the best sex ratio of 108 females for every 100 males, while Copperbelt had the lowest of 101. Northern Province had the highest number of basic schools, while Copperbelt had the highest number of high schools. The unemployment rate of youth (55%) and general unemployment rate (32%) was the highest in Copperbelt Province, while Eastern had the lowest unemployment rate of 6 per cent. AIDS death was maximum in Copperbelt with 26,799 recorded deaths in 2010, while it was lowest in North-Western with 2,859 recorded deaths. <b>Lusaka</b> Province had the most number of doctors and least number of Malaria related incidents, while North-Western had the lowest number of doctors.|$|E
5|$|Zambia {{had a total}} {{population}} of 13,092,666 including 6,454,647 males and 6,638,019 females. Among the provinces, <b>Lusaka</b> had the largest population followed by Copperbelt, Eastern, Southern and Central. The interdecadal growth was 2.8 per cent compared to 2.5 per cent during the census of 2000.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the fifth}} Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM), held in <b>Lusaka,</b> Zambia from 1 to 7 August in 1979, the British {{government}} invited Muzorewa, Mugabe, and Nkomo {{to participate in}} a constitutional conference at Lancaster House. The purpose of the conference was to discuss and reach an agreement on the terms of an independence constitution, and provide for elections supervised under British authority allowing Zimbabwe Rhodesia to proceed to legal independence.|$|E
5|$|The {{first few}} years of the {{federation}} were characterised by a relatively peaceful political atmosphere and a booming economy. The government's coffers were kept full through revenue from Northern Rhodesia's copper mines, and overseas investment saw the rapid expansion of the cities of Salisbury, Bulawayo and <b>Lusaka.</b> High-standard tar roads replaced dirt tracks and the railway system was expanded. Welensky credited the high rate of development to the astute management of the federal Minister of Finance, Donald Macintyre.|$|E
5|$|Savimbi, {{unwilling to}} {{personally}} sign an accord, had former UNITA Secretary General Eugenio Manuvakola represent UNITA in his place. Manuvakola and Angolan Foreign Minister Venancio de Moura signed the <b>Lusaka</b> Protocol in <b>Lusaka,</b> Zambia on 31 October 1994, agreeing to integrate and disarm UNITA. Both sides signed a ceasefire {{as part of}} the protocol on 20 November. Under the agreement the government and UNITA would cease fire and demobilize. 5,500 UNITA members, including 180 militants, would join the Angolan national police, 1,200 UNITA members, including 40 militants, would join the rapid reaction police force, and UNITA generals would become officers in the Angolan Armed Forces. Foreign mercenaries would return to their home countries and all parties would stop acquiring foreign arms. The agreement gave UNITA politicians homes and a headquarters. The government agreed to appoint UNITA members to head the Mines, Commerce, Health, and Tourism ministries, in addition to seven deputy ministers, ambassadors, the governorships of Uige, Lunda Sul, and Cuando Cubango, deputy governors, municipal administrators, deputy administrators, and commune administrators. The government would release all prisoners and give amnesty to all militants involved in the civil war. Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and South African President Nelson Mandela met in <b>Lusaka</b> on 15 November 1994 to boost support symbolically for the protocol. Mugabe and Mandela both said {{they would be willing to}} meet with Savimbi and Mandela asked him to come to South Africa, but Savimbi did not come. The agreement created a joint commission, consisting of officials from the Angolan government, UNITA, and the UN with the governments of Portugal, the United States, and Russia observing, to oversee its implementation. Violations of the protocol's provisions would be discussed and reviewed by the commission. The protocol's provisions, integrating UNITA into the military, a ceasefire, and a coalition government, were similar to those of the Alvor Agreement that granted Angola independence from Portugal in 1975. Many of the same environmental problems, mutual distrust between UNITA and the MPLA, loose international oversight, the importation of foreign arms, and an overemphasis on maintaining the balance of power, led to the collapse of the protocol.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Lusaka</b> Ceasefire Agreement was not {{successful}} in ending the war, and fighting resumed in September 1999. The FAC's performance {{continued to be}} poor and both the major offensives the Government launched in 2000 ended in costly defeats. President Kabila's mismanagement was an important factor behind the FAC's poor performance, with soldiers frequently going unpaid and unfed while the Government purchased advanced weaponry {{which could not be}} operated or maintained. The defeats in 2000 are believed to have been the cause of President Kabila's assassination in January 2001. Following the assassination, Joseph Kabila assumed the presidency and was eventually successful in negotiating an end to the war in 2002-2003.|$|E
5|$|The UN spent $1.6billion from 1994 to 1998 in {{maintaining}} a peacekeeping force. The Angolan military attacked UNITA {{forces in the}} Central Highlands on 4 December 1998, {{the day before the}} MPLA's fourth Congress. Dos Santos told the delegates the next day that he believed war to {{be the only way to}} ultimately achieve peace, rejected the <b>Lusaka</b> Protocol, and asked MONUA to leave. In February 1999, the Security Council withdrew the last MONUA personnel. In late 1998, several UNITA commanders, dissatisfied with Savimbi's leadership, formed UNITA Renovada, a breakaway militant group. Thousands more deserted UNITA in 1999 and 2000.|$|E
5|$|The growing {{unrest in}} Portugal culminated on April 25, 1974, when the Carnation Revolution, a {{peaceful}} leftist military coup d'état in Lisbon, ousted the incumbent Portuguese government of Marcelo Caetano. Thousands of Portuguese citizens left Mozambique, {{and the new}} head of government, General António de Spínola, called for a ceasefire. With the change of government in Lisbon, many soldiers refused to continue fighting, often remaining in their barracks instead of going on patrol. Negotiations between the Portuguese administration culminated in the <b>Lusaka</b> Accord signed on September 7, 1974, which provided for a complete hand-over of power to FRELIMO, uncontested by elections. Formal independence was set for June 25, 1975, the 13th anniversary of the founding of FRELIMO.|$|E
5|$|Under {{pressure}} from South African Prime Minister B. J. Vorster, Smith accepted in principle that white minority rule {{could not be}} prolonged indefinitely. He oversaw the 1979 general election which resulted in Abel Muzorewa, a politically moderate black bishop, being elected Prime Minister. Both ZANU and ZAPU had boycotted the election, which did not receive international recognition. At the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1979, held in <b>Lusaka,</b> the British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher surprised delegates by announcing that the UK would officially recognise Rhodesia's independence if it transitioned to democratic majority rule.|$|E
5|$|Government troops killed Jonas Savimbi on 22 February 2002, in Moxico province. UNITA Vice President António Dembo took over, but {{died from}} {{diabetes}} 12days later on 3 March, and Secretary-General Paulo Lukamba became UNITA's leader. After Savimbi's death, the government {{came to a}} crossroads over how to proceed. After initially indicating the counter-insurgency might continue, the government announced it would halt all military operations on 13 March. Military commanders for UNITA and the MPLA met in Cassamba and agreed to a cease-fire. However, Carlos Morgado, UNITA's spokesman in Portugal, said the UNITA's Portugal wing had been under the impression General Kamorteiro, the UNITA general who agreed to the ceasefire, had been captured {{more than a week}} earlier. Morgado did say that he had not heard from Angola since Savimbi's death. The military commanders signed a Memorandum of Understanding as an addendum to the <b>Lusaka</b> Protocol in Luena on 4 April, with Santos and Lukambo observing.|$|E
5|$|As per the census, Zambia {{recorded}} a Total fertility rate (TFR), {{defined as the}} fertility rate of a woman throughout her life, of 5.9, with 7.0 in rural and 4.6 in urban areas. The most urbanized provinces, with higher socio-economic index like <b>Lusaka</b> {{recorded a}} lower TFR. Crude birth rate (CBR), the number of live births for each 1,000 births, stood at 35 in Zambia, with the Northern Province recording a maximum of 41. Child-woman ratio (CWR), the ratio of children aged 0–4 against women aged 15–49, was 738 children per thousand women and it was maximum in Northern province, where it was 880. The General fertility rate (GFR), the number of births per 1,000 child bearing women, was 147 as per the census. The Completed family Size (CF) was 6.4 in rural areas and 5.4 in urban areas. Gross reproduction rate (GRR), {{the average number of}} females births a women would have between ages 15–49, was 2.3, while the Net reproduction rate (NRR), the number of surviving female births a women would have between ages 15–49, stood at 2.1.|$|E
5|$|The Second Congo War, {{which began}} in 1998, was still raging when Kagame assumed the {{presidency}} in 2000. Namibia, Angola, Zimbabwe, and Chad had committed troops to the Congolese government side, while Rwanda, Uganda, and Burundi were supporting rebel groups. The rebel group Rally for Congolese Democracy (RCD) had split in 1999 into two factions: the RCD-Goma, supported by Rwanda, and the RCD-Kisangani, which was allied to Uganda. Uganda also supported the Movement for the Liberation of the Congo (MLC), a rebel group from the north. All these rebel groups were at war with Kabila's government in Kinshasa, but were also increasingly hostile to each other. Various peace meetings had been held, culminating in the July 1999 <b>Lusaka</b> Ceasefire Agreement which was signed by Kabila, Kagame {{and all the other}} foreign governments. The rebel groups were not party to the agreement, and fighting continued. The RPA continued to be heavily involved in the Congo War during 2000, fighting battles against the Ugandan army in Kisangani and against Kabila's army in Kasai and Katanga.|$|E
5|$|Mugabe {{was arrested}} on his return to Southern Rhodesia in December 1963. His trial lasted from January to March 1964, during which he refused to retract the subversive {{statements}} that he had publicly made. In March 1964 {{he was sentenced to}} 21 months imprisonment. Mugabe was first imprisoned at Salisbury Maximum Security Prison, before being moved to the Wha Wha detention centre and then the Sikombela detention centre in Que Que. At the latter, he organised study classes for the inmates, teaching them basic literacy as well as maths and English. Sympathetic black warders smuggled messages from Mugabe {{and other members of the}} ZANU executive committee to activists outside the prison. At the executive's bidding, ZANU activist Herbert Chitepo had organised a small guerrilla force in <b>Lusaka.</b> In April 1966 it carried out a failed attempt to destroy power pylons at Sinoia, and shortly after attacked a white-owned farm near Hartley, killing its inhabitants. The government responded by returning the members of the ZANU executive, including Mugabe, to Salisbury Prison in 1966. There, forty prisoners were divided among four communal cells, with many sleeping on the concrete floor due to overcrowding; Mugabe shared his cell with Sithole, Enos Nkala, and Edgar Tekere. He remained there for eight years, devoting his time to reading and studying. During this period he gained several further degrees from the University of London: a masters in economics, a bachelor of administration, and two law degrees.|$|E

25|$|In March 1976, Mbeki, Albert Dhlomo and Jacob Zuma {{were arrested}} in Swaziland, but the trio managed to escape {{deportation}} to South Africa. Instead, a month after their arrest, they were escorted {{across the border to}} Mozambique. From there, Mbeki went back to <b>Lusaka</b> for a few months before being posted to Nigeria in January 1977. Before leaving <b>Lusaka,</b> Mbeki was appointed as deputy to Duma Nokwe in the Department of Information and Propaganda (DIP). Mbeki's mission in Nigeria was to establish diplomatic relations with Olusegun Obasanjo's regime, – a mission that proved to be quite successful as Mbeki was to build a lasting relationship with the Nigerian authorities, eclipsing the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) in Nigeria. Zanele, who was running the Africa offices of the International University Education Fund in <b>Lusaka,</b> spent much of 1977 with her husband in Nigeria.|$|E
25|$|Together with Oliver Tambo, Mbeki left London for <b>Lusaka</b> in April 1971 {{to take up}} the {{position}} of assistant secretary of the ANC's Revolutionary Council (RC). This {{was the first time in}} nine years that Mbeki was setting foot on African soil. The aim of the RC at this time was to bridge an ever-widening gap between the ANC in exile and the people back home. In <b>Lusaka,</b> Mbeki was housed in a secret location in Makeni, south-west of the city. Later, Mbeki moved over to work in the ANC's propaganda section. But he continued to attend RC meetings. Four months after his arrival in <b>Lusaka,</b> Mbeki travelled to Beichlingen to deliver a speech on behalf of the ANC's Executive Committee at the YSS summer school. This was a turning point in Mbeki's life as it was the first time he spoke on behalf of the ANC as opposed to the ANC Youth League.|$|E
25|$|Through a {{separate}} voluntary fund, Commonwealth governments support the Commonwealth Youth Programme, {{a division of}} the Secretariat with offices in Gulu (Uganda), <b>Lusaka</b> (Zambia), Chandigarh (India), Georgetown (Guyana) and Honiara (Solomon Islands).|$|E

25|$|The peri-urban {{areas of}} <b>Lusaka,</b> {{the capital of}} Zambia, have ground {{conditions}} which are strongly karstified {{and for this reason}} – together with the increasing population density in these peri-urban areas – pollution of water wells from pit latrines is a major public health threat there.|$|E
25|$|Naturally {{occurring}} pigments such as ochres {{and iron}} oxides {{have been used}} as colorants since prehistoric times. Archaeologists have uncovered evidence that early humans used paint for aesthetic purposes such as body decoration. Pigments and paint grinding equipment believed to be between 350,000 and 400,000 years old have been reported in a cave at Twin Rivers, near <b>Lusaka,</b> Zambia.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{earliest}} matches Zambia women's national football team played were in 1994, for qualification for 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup. They played in a 5 November 1994 World Cup qualifier against South Africa in South Africa, where Zambia lost 3–5. In the return match in <b>Lusaka,</b> Zambia on 17 November 1994, Zambia lost again but with a score of 2–6.|$|E
25|$|By the mid-1990s, cricket was {{confined}} almost entirely to <b>Lusaka,</b> {{but the national}} side returned {{to play in the}} African Cricket Association Championships in 1994. Zambia took part in the Africa Cup in 2002, beating Namibia and Tanzania and the Zambian Cricket Union became an associate member of the ICC in 2003, enabling the national side to take part in ICC tournaments for the first time.|$|E
25|$|Chona {{received}} his primary education at Chona out-school in Nampeyo (established by the Jesuit mission at his father's request), and at Chikuni (the Jesuit headquarters). It was at Chikuni that Chona converted to Catholicism. He completed his secondary education at Munali Secondary School in <b>Lusaka</b> in 1951 and then {{worked as an}} interpreter at the High Court in Livingstone. However, his ambition {{was to become a}} lawyer.|$|E
25|$|In December 1986, the South African {{government}} requested Mozambican authorities expel six {{senior members}} of the ANC including himself. As a result of the pressure applied by the apartheid government on Mozambique, in January 1987, Zuma was forced to leave Mozambique. He moved to the ANC Head Office in <b>Lusaka,</b> Zambia, where he was appointed Head of Underground Structures and shortly thereafter Chief of the Intelligence Department.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{he worked}} as a case officer in <b>Lusaka,</b> Zambia during the Rhodesian Bush War. He then {{transferred}} to Somalia, where he served for two years during the conflict between Ethiopians and Somalis. He worked in South Africa during the National Party government's war against guerrilla movements opposing the apartheid system. While assigned to Kinshasa, Zaire, Black was involved in the Reagan Administration's covert action program to arm anti-communist guerrillas in neighboring Angola.|$|E
25|$|Zambia: The Beit CURE International Hospital of Zambia was {{established}} in 2004, in <b>Lusaka</b> when CURE {{signed an agreement with}} the Zambian Ministry of Health to operate a pediatric teaching hospital, specializing in treatment and care of children living with disabilities. The Beit Trust, a UK-based charity, donated $1.5 million to support construction of the hospital as a centennial gift to the people of Zambia. The hospital partners with Smile Train and has a hip replacement program.|$|E
25|$|In February 1982, Mbeki's brother Jama disappeared. He {{was later}} presumed dead. In 1985, PW Botha {{declared}} a State of Emergency {{and gave the}} army and police special powers. In 1986, the South African Army sent a captain in the South African Defence Force (SADF) to kill Mbeki. The plan was to put a bomb in his house in <b>Lusaka,</b> but the assassin was arrested by the Zambian police before he could go through with the plan.|$|E
25|$|In January 1971, Lloyd International {{entered into}} an {{agreement}} with East African Airways Corporation (EAAC) to operate scheduled all-cargo services on the latter's behalf between London, Dar es Salaam, Nairobi, Entebbe and <b>Lusaka.</b> This was also the year the airline acquired two more 707s, another -321 and a -324C. The latter was a convertible aircraft that could either be operated in an all-passenger, all-cargo or mixed passenger/cargo configuration. It was also the company's first turbofan-powered jet.|$|E
25|$|Chitepo died on 18 March 1975 in <b>Lusaka,</b> Zambia {{when a car}} bomb, {{placed in}} his Volkswagen Beetle the night before, exploded. He and Silas Shamiso, one of his bodyguards, were killed instantly. Sadat Kufamadzuba, his other bodyguard, was injured. The {{explosion}} sent part of the car onto {{the roof of his}} house and uprooted a tree next door. Hours later one of his neighbours died of injuries he sustained in the explosion. ZANU at the time blamed the Rhodesian Security Forces.|$|E
25|$|The Commonwealth's {{objectives}} were first {{outlined in the}} 1971 Singapore Declaration, which committed the Commonwealth to the institution of world peace; promotion of representative democracy and individual liberty; the pursuit of equality and opposition to racism; the fight against poverty, ignorance, and disease; and free trade. To these were added opposition to {{discrimination on the basis}} of gender by the <b>Lusaka</b> Declaration of 1979, and environmental sustainability by the Langkawi Declaration of 1989. These {{objectives were}} reinforced by the Harare Declaration in 1991.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{diplomatic}} circumstances {{contributed to}} the first ceasefire of the war. In July 1999 the <b>Lusaka</b> Ceasefire Agreement was signed by the six warring countries (Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Rwanda and Uganda) and, on 1 August, the MLC (the RCD refused to sign). Under {{the terms of the}} agreement, forces from all sides, under a Joint Military Commission, would co-operate in tracking, disarming and documenting all armed groups in the Congo, especially those forces identified with the 1994 Rwandan Genocide.|$|E
25|$|In 1999 he was {{appointed}} as Minister-Counselor to the Portuguese Embassy in Luanda, Angola, a position he held until 2002. During his post in Luanda, marked {{by the death of}} UNITA’s Angolan rebel leader, Jonas Savimbi, and {{the final days of the}} Angolan Civil War, Luís de Almeida Sampaio was a member of the Portuguese delegation (comprising the “troika for peace” with the United States of America and Russia) responsible for the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding as an addendum to the <b>Lusaka</b> Protocol.|$|E
25|$|Mbeki {{played a}} major role in turning the {{international}} media against apartheid. Raising the diplomatic profile of the ANC, Mbeki acted as a point of contact for foreign governments and international organisations and he was extremely successful in this position. Mbeki also played the role of ambassador to the steady flow of delegates from the elite sectors of white South Africa. These included academics, clerics, business people and representatives of liberal white groups who travelled to <b>Lusaka</b> to assess the ANC's views on a democratic, free South Africa.|$|E
25|$|The Patriotic Front (PF) was {{originally}} formed in 1976 {{as a political}} and military alliance between ZAPU and ZANU during the war against white minority rule. Both movements contributed their respective military forces: ZAPU's military wing was known as Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA) which operated mainly from Zambia and somewhat in Angola, and ZANU's guerrillas were known as Zimbabwe National African Liberation Army (ZANLA) which formed in 1965 in Tanzania, but operated mainly from camps around <b>Lusaka,</b> Zambia and later from Mozambique. Objective of the Patriotic Front was to overthrow the white minority regime by means of political pressure and military force.|$|E
