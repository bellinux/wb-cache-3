6000|$|The young Englishmen {{emerged from}} their cabin and amused {{themselves}} with wandering about the immense labyrinthine steamer, which struck {{them as an}} extraordinary mixture of a ship and a hotel. It was densely crowded with passengers, the larger number of whom appeared to be ladies and very young children; and in the big saloons, ornamented in white and gold, which followed each other in surprising succession, beneath the swinging gaslight, and among the small side passages where the Negro domestics of both sexes assembled {{with an air of}} philosophic leisure, everyone was moving to and fro and exchanging loud and familiar observations. Eventually, at the instance of a discriminating black, our young men went and had some [...] "supper" [...] in a wonderful place arranged like a theater, where, in a gilded gallery, upon which little boxes appeared to open, a large orchestra was playing operatic selections, and, below, people were handing about bills of fare, {{as if they had been}} programs. All this was sufficiently curious; but the agreeable thing, later, was to sit out on one of the great white decks of the steamer, in the warm breezy darkness, and, in the vague starlight, to make out the line of low, mysterious coast. The young Englishmen tried American cigars--those of Mr. Westgate--and talked together as they usually talked, with many odd silences, lapses of logic, and incongruities of transition; like people who have grown old together and learned to supply each other's missing phrases; or, more especially, like people thoroughly conscious of a common point of view, so that a style of conversation superficially <b>lacking</b> <b>in</b> <b>finish</b> might suffice for reference to a fund of associations in the light of which everything was all right.|$|E

England's forwards were again penalized by Watson in the 61st minute, and Flatley kicked the penalty goal for Australia.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{concepts}} of risk and resilience applied to children and youth. The author suggests advantages in considering a definition of risk grounded in actual school performance and behavior, as opposed to common conceptions of risk tied to various group-level probabilities of failure. The study focuses on students doing poorly or <b>lacking</b> confidence <b>in</b> <b>finishing</b> school as of 8 th grade who turn themselves around by the 10 th grade. Using data from the NELS: 88 survey, analyses examine the nature of performance based risks and {{the conditions under which}} students improve their performance levels and outlooks by grade 10. The estimated models of resilience show influences resembling those found in studies of individual resilience in other domains. The importance of family supports, school responsiveness to students, and student involvement in school and community activities stand out as predictors of recovery from low performance. A few patterns within sub-groups emerge: for instance the non-influence of SES on resilience within the Hispanic and African American cohorts. And Hispanic youth are less resilient in schools where there are perceived problems with youth gangs. ...|$|R
50|$|The first {{personality}} {{tires of}} the other two personalities and shoots both. Jimmy's ghost then shoots him, but Pete does not die. Instead, the CEO of Propaganda reappears as a disembodied voice and guides Pete to place where they can talk face-to-face. There, the man reveals himself as a former CIA agent and the screenwriter who created Pete. Depressed about his <b>lack</b> of success <b>in</b> <b>finishing</b> the screenplay, the writer explains that he has become suicidal and threatens to kill himself, which was the source of the apocalypse in Pete's world. The writer berates Pete for derailing the writing process and taking over the character. Pete is unable to talk the writer out his course of action, and the film ends as the writer shoots himself in the head.|$|R
50|$|Fish hydrolysate, in its {{simplest}} form, {{is ground}} up fish {{transformed into a}} liquid phase, where the cleavage of molecular bonds occurs through various biological processes. Raw material choice; either whole fish or by-products, depends on the commercial sources of the fish. In some cases, the fillet portions are removed for human consumption, the remaining fish body (generally the guts, bones, cartilage, scales and remaining meat) is put into water and ground up. Some fish hydrolysate is ground more finely than others so more bone material is able to remain suspended. Enzymes may {{also be used to}} dissolve bones, scale and meat. If the larger chunks of bone and scales are screened out, calcium or mineral content may be <b>lacking</b> <b>in</b> the <b>finished</b> product form. If purchasing fish hydrolysate for agricultural applications, one should look at the label carefully for the concentration of mineral elements in the liquid. Some fish hydrolysates have been made into a dried product, increasing the potential for inclusion as an ingredient in other food or feed products. The oil is separated out in this process, which means the Omega 3 fatty acid would remain with the oil and not the hydrolysate.|$|R
50|$|In 1987, he was {{no longer}} the {{outstanding}} 1500 m athlete that he had been in previous years. Having previously been able to win races from any position and at any pace, {{he was no}}w <b>lacking</b> confidence <b>in</b> his <b>finishing</b> speed, an area in which he had fallen behind some of his main rivals. He was beaten by José Luis González in the European Cup, and although he followed that with an impressive win in the 1000 m in Stockholm, and won the Dream Mile for the third year running, he finished eighth after leading into the final bend of the 1987 World Championships final in Rome. He had said before the race that his only hope of victory was a fast race, in which he could run the finish out of his opponents, in particular Abdi Bile, the eventual winner. Unhappily for Cram, the pace was slow, and he faded badly in the last 100 metres.|$|R

[...] Baseball Magazine praised Bush for his range: [...] "In the field Bush sometimes appears ragged, {{but this is}} not owing to <b>lack</b> of <b>finish</b> <b>in</b> handling stinging grounders. It is rather a direct result of his eagerness to spear everything within reach and just a little beyond. No chance is too hard for him to try, and more than most fielders can say he pulls down the drive and relays it to first." [...] In its annual selection of an All-America Baseball Team, Baseball Magazine named Bush as the second best shortstop in the American League, calling him [...] "one of the cleverest fielders in the game" [...] and citing [...] "his unsurpassed ability to get on bases and his great speed and nice judgment in run-getting once he earns standing room on first." ...|$|R
5000|$|His {{best work}} is the series of marble reliefs executed, in {{collaboration}} with Pisano, for the famous tomb of St Dominic in the church of that Saint at Bologna. The figures on the funeral urn, in mezzo-rilievo, are about two feet high. Fra Guglielmo's work on the posterior face of the tomb deals with six Dominican legends: the Blessed Reginald smitten by a distemper; the Virgin Mary healing a sick man and selecting the habit for the Friars Preachers; the same man freed from a terrible temptation by holding St Dominic's hands; Pope Honorius III having his vision of St Dominic supporting the falling Lateran Basilica; Honorius examining the Dominican rule, and his solemn approbation of it. This work afforded little scope to Fra Guglielmo's imaginative powers, but its masterly execution raised his esteem to second only to his master, Nicola Pisano. On the other hand, the figures show some of the characteristic stiffness and <b>lack</b> of <b>finish</b> <b>in</b> the extremities of the time. They are also crowded.|$|R

40|$|In {{my thesis}} I {{examine how the}} {{screenplay}} author and director Quentin Tarantino uses the literary format of the screenplay to convey the spatiality and temporality {{of the characters in}} the narrative. I also investigate how the reader’s perception of these factors is crystallized, by contrasting the screenplay with its film. I apply theories from screenplay and adaptation studies, and by combining, opposing or altering them I demonstrate how the screenplay can achieve unique effects that are lost when the text is turned into a movie. I show, among other things, that in the screenplay, the reader can be endowed spatial properties. Furthermore, not all spatial properties of the characters have to be specified in the screenplay. The spatiality {{of the people in the}} movie depends on whether they are recognized by the spectator or not, as this alters the spectator’s perception of the actors’ extension in space. I also analyze how the distance between reader and narrative is diminished in the screenplay as she partly participates in the creation of it. On the other hand, there seems to be an indelible temporal discrepancy between the music and the events described in the screenplay. Moreover, in a screenplay, silence and inaction can be endowed with temporal extension in a way that movies cannot. I also examine how the screenplay author, thanks to the screenplay’s unique feature of scene headings, can create a temporal rupture that <b>lacks</b> equivalence <b>in</b> the <b>finished</b> film...|$|R
