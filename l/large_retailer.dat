2500|$|In scoring, Wong uses a 100-point {{system that}} he {{developed}} before {{working for the}} <b>large</b> <b>retailer.</b> Wong reports that his system is aimed at {{the taste of the}} consumer rather than at that of the intellectual, unlike Parker's system which is more cerebral. One of the differences, said Wong, is that Parker may give a [...] "fruitful" [...] wine 88 points when Wong will give it 92, noting that it may be well-made for its varietal. He reports that he has only given two wines a score of 100, one a 1990 Montrachet from Domaine Ramonet-Prudhon and the other a late 1990s vintage from Opus One. His personal favorites to drink are French wines such as second- and third-growth Bordeaux reds, and California Pinot noir from the Russian River Valley. Other wines he likes include Chenin blanc from the Loire Valley, Pinot gris from Alsace, high-end Chardonnay from Australia and various biodynamic wines. Wong publishes his thoughts about wine regularly on [...] "Wilfred's Blog", hosted on the company website; a forum that he uses to name his current favorites and to recommend wine and food pairings.|$|E

40|$|The paper explores an {{efficiency}} hypothesis regarding the contractual process between <b>large</b> <b>retailers,</b> such as Wal-Mart and Carrefour, and their suppliers. The empirical evidence presented {{supports the idea}} that <b>large</b> <b>retailers</b> play a quasi-judicial role, acting as "courts of first instance" in their relationships with suppliers. In this role, <b>large</b> <b>retailers</b> adjust the terms of trade to on-going changes and sanction performance failures, sometimes delaying payments. A potential abuse of their position {{is limited by the}} need for re-contracting and preserving their reputations. Suppliers renew their confidence in their retailers on a yearly basis, through writing new contracts.
