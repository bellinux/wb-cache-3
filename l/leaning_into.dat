25|$|Skiers use {{outriggers}} {{for balance}} and as leverage when they fall to right themselves. Outriggers {{are also used}} for turning; skiers use the outrigger and their upper body by <b>leaning</b> <b>into</b> the direction they want to turn. In para-Nordic skiing, outriggers or ski poles are used to propel the skier forward. If skiers fall, they may require assistance in righting themselves, and/or {{getting back to the}} fall line. Doing this on their own, they need to position their mono-ski facing uphill relative to the fall line.|$|E
25|$|After winning two minor bouts in Germany and enlisting the {{services}} of legendary boxing trainer Emanuel Steward, Klitschko again fought for the vacated WBO title on 10 April 2004, in Las Vegas, against Lamon Brewster. Klitschko sent Brewster to the canvas in the fourth round; however, things turned around in the fifth when Brewster's punches began backing him up. Not defending himself and <b>leaning</b> <b>into</b> ropes for support, Klitschko took a standing eight count. On unsteady legs, Klitschko fell to the canvas after the bell and the referee stopped the fight for his safety.|$|E

25|$|There is {{no single}} universally {{accepted}} stance, with a wide variation between players who compete at professional cuesports. However, {{there are a number}} of common characteristics: generally the back leg is braced while the front leg is slightly bent with the player <b>leaning</b> <b>into</b> the shot; the player's weight is evenly distributed, and the body remains still for the duration of the shot. Many of the modern players face the line of the shot, while a more traditional stance would see the player twist their body so their back foot is at a right-angle to the shot.|$|E

50|$|The {{next four}} years of Controlled Bleeding's output strayed from the {{previous}} trio's art rock <b>leanings</b> <b>into</b> more experimental areas. During 1983 and 1984, the band released a series of live-to-two-track cassettes via labels like Inner-X-Musick, Broken Flag, and Ladd-Frith which featured layered, harsh industrial noise, sometimes mixed with guitar and Joe Papa's vocal work. In February 1985, the band's first full-length LP, Knees and Bones, was released by Hans Fahlberg on his Sweden-based record label Psychout Productions, featuring a particularly harsh wall of sound similar {{to the work of}} other American and Japanese harsh noise artists.|$|R

500|$|The race {{took place}} in very wet and windy conditions. This {{included}} a headwind {{in the early stages}} of the race, which delayed the formation of a breakaway.

[...] Soon afterwards the peloton was split into groups as riders began to withdraw from the race.

500|$|The overall {{look was}} {{influenced}} by television images, particularly commercials: Many shots have characters <b>leaning</b> <b>into</b> the lens with their eyeballs wide open, and the interior scenes are heavily lit, because Weir wanted to remind viewers that [...] "in this world, everything was for sale". Those involved in visual effects work found the film somewhat difficult to make, because 1997 was the year many visual effects companies were trying to convert to computer-generated imagery. CGI was used to create the upper halves {{of some of the}} larger buildings in the film's downtown set. Craig Barron, one of the effects supervisors, said that these digital models did not have to look as detailed and weathered as they normally would in a film because of the artificial look of the entire town, although they did imitate slight blemishes found in the physical buildings.|$|E

When the vehicle was made public in 1946, Stout picked the name Forty-Six for that year. Some firms considered producing the Forty-Six, but as Stout stated he doubted there would be much of a market for a $10,000 dollar car, the estimated price if it had been mass-produced.|$|E

Various translations of Rotha's book, however, displayed the marks of self-imposed censorship or misreading and changed his socialist <b>leanings</b> <b>into</b> support for the imperial state of Japan.

6000|$|Alone {{with her}} patient, Mrs. Petty, an enthusiast for {{cleanliness}} and fresh air, went on her knees, and, having plucked out the charred {{ring of the}} little hole in the carpet, opened the window wider to rid the room of the smell of burning.

60|$|Our men {{raised a}} hoarse yell, drowned {{all at once}} by the popping of musketry in the tops and the {{bursting}} of grenades here and there about the decks. A mighty muffled blast sent the Bon homme Richard rolling to larboard, and the smoke eddied from our hatches and lifted out of {{the space between the}} ships. The Englishman had blown off his gun-ports. And next some one shouted that our battery of twelves was fighting them muzzle to muzzle below, our rammers <b>leaning</b> <b>into</b> the Serapis to send their shot home. No chance then for the thoughts which had tortured us in moments of suspense. That was a fearful hour, when a shot had scarce to leap a cannon's length to find its commission; when the belches of the English guns burned the hair of our faces; when Death was sovereign, merciful or cruel at his pleasure. The red flashes disclosed many an act of coolness and of heroism. I saw a French lad whip off his coat when a gunner called for a wad, and another, who had been a scavenger, snatch the rammer from Pearce's hands when he staggered with a grape-shot through his chest. Poor Jack Pearce! He did not live to see the work 'Scolding Sairy' was to do that night. I had but dragged him beyond reach of the recoil when he was gone.|$|E

But since the night when, <b>leaning</b> out <b>into</b> the moonlight, he heard the waggons coming in to Covent Garden Market, a strange feeling had possessed him--the sensation of a man who lies, with a touch of fever on him, listening to the thrum of distant music--sensuous, not unpleasurable.|$|R
