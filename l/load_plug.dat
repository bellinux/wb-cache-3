The study compared <b>plug</b> <b>load</b> assumptions made by 92 energy modeling practitioners against ASHRAE and Title 24 requirements, as well as, {{the evaluation of the}} <b>plug</b> <b>loads</b> calculation methodology used by 660 LEED-CI and 429 LEED-NC certified projects. In general, energy modelers considered the energy consumption of <b>plug</b> <b>loads</b> of equipment that are constantly running (such as refrigerators) as well as monitors and computes predictable. Overall the results suggested a disconnection between energy modelers assumptions and the actual performance of buildings. The study also shows that there was no consistency on the method used by LEED-CI and NC projects, while one is based on the power and percentage of ENERGY STAR equipment installed in the building the other one is based on a whole-building-design energy model. In conclusion, the study suggests LEED or ASHRAE to develop guidelines for <b>plug</b> <b>loads</b> calculations.|$|R
40|$|<b>Plug</b> <b>loads</b> use 12 % of site {{energy in}} U. S. office buildings. The {{relative}} importance of <b>plug</b> <b>loads</b> is rising and it is projected to increase more in years to come. We studied the predicted and simulated <b>plug</b> <b>load</b> energy consumption using data submitted to the U. S. Green Building Council for LEED certification. The study included 660 LEED for Commercial Interiors projects and 429 LEED for New Construction projects. This is the first study to analyze LEED submittal data related to <b>plug</b> <b>load</b> energy use. The submittal data from these projects was mined and statistically analyzed. The results show that 73 % of the projects under LEED-CI that attempted the credit dedicated to <b>plug</b> <b>loads</b> earned 2 of 2 points available (90 % or more of eligible equipment is ENERGY STAR rate). Additionally, we found that projects most frequently specify ENERGY STAR rated laptops, monitors, desktops and printers, whereas televisions, fax machines, refrigerators and dishwashers were less frequently specified. Under LEED-NC, the median peak <b>plug</b> <b>load</b> power intensity reported among the projects was 10. 8 W/m 2. Most of the projects complied with the LEED requirement of 25 % process load energy use, with the median percentage being 25 % and the 1 st and 3 rd quartiles ranging from 18 % to 31 %. 32 % of the projects reported using eQUEST as an energy simulation tool.

40|$|AbstractEnergy {{efficiency}} {{is a key}} goal for today's enterprises in their efforts towards achieving their sustainability goals, meeting stakeholder needs and concerns, and addressing environmental regulations for a greener tomorrow. Energy efficiency efforts in office and commercial buildings have so far focused on HVAC and lighting, which together constitutes about 60 - 70 % of the energy consumption. With most companies having achieved a fair degree of optimization in HVAC usage, they now are turning their attention to <b>plug</b> <b>loads,</b> which constitutes about 30 - 40 % of the enterprises’ energy consumption. Study conducted within Infosys and other entities shows roughly 40 % of energy consumed by <b>plug</b> <b>loads</b> is wasted. By effectively managing <b>plug</b> <b>load</b> consumption, {{it is possible to}} save much of this wastage. However, there are not many <b>plug</b> <b>load</b> energy managements solutions in the market today that can cost effectively address the issue at hand due to a variety of challenges.

40|$|Axial <b>loads</b> on <b>plugs</b> or {{seals in}} an {{underground}} repository due to gas, water pressures and temperature changes induced subsequent to waste and plug emplacement lead to shear stresses at the plug/rock contact. Therefore, {{the bond between}} the plug and rock is a critical element for the design and effectiveness of plugs in boreholes, shafts or tunnels. This study includes a systematic investigation of the bond strength of cementitious borehole plugs in welded tuff. Analytical and numerical analysis of borehole plug-rock stress transfer mechanics is performed. The interface strength and deformation are studied {{as a function of}} Young`s modulus ratio of plug and rock, plug length and rock cylinder outside-to-inside radius ratio. The tensile stresses in and near an axially <b>loaded</b> <b>plug</b> are analyzed. The frictional interface strength of an axially <b>loaded</b> borehole <b>plug,</b> the effect of axial stress and lateral external stress, and thermal effects are also analyzed. Implications for plug design are discussed. The main conclusion is a strong recommendation to design friction plugs in shafts, drifts, tunnels or boreholes with a minimum length to diameter ratio of four. Such a geometrical design will reduce tensile stresses in the plug and in the host rock to a level which should minimize the risk of long-term deterioration caused by excessive tensile stresses. Push-out tests have been used to determine the bond strength by applying an axial <b>load</b> to cement <b>plugs</b> emplaced in boreholes in welded tuff cylinders. A total of 130 push-out tests have been performed as a function of borehole size, plug length, temperature, and degree of saturation of the host tuff.

40|$|Plug loads—traditionally {{viewed as}} behaviorally {{motivated}} {{and beyond the}} control of designers and operations—are now seen {{as an integral part of}} achieving low-energy building targets. Higher education institutions are increasingly recognizing the environmental impacts of campus facilities through holistic approaches to energy savings including energy efficient design and occupant engagement. Residence halls are a compelling example because students bring large numbers of electronics to their rooms and have unlimited access to power for an all-inclusive room rate and resource usage competitions and campaigns are commonplace. However, limited research exists on residence halls <b>plug</b> <b>loads.</b> This dissertation asked the following of residence halls: (1) What are the measured <b>plug</b> <b>loads</b> and how do they compare with design estimates? (2) What role do building design characteristics play in <b>plug</b> <b>loads?</b> (3) What are the specific occupant behaviors that could influence future design? (4) How can <b>plug</b> <b>loads</b> be better understood in terms of behavior, design, and operations? To answer these questions, a sequential mixed methods study included field measurements and student surveys in six residence halls on three Oregon campuses followed by 24 interviews with designers, operators, and students. Findings suggest that <b>plug</b> <b>loads</b> in occupied residence halls are higher and usage profiles differ from design predictions. Results do not show significant correlations between design characteristics and <b>plug</b> <b>loads</b> but suggest that some room/suite level features may play a somewhat stronger role. Survey responses indicated that students are doing more with fewer smart devices, which suggests opportunities for students sharing energy intensive devices. Lighting emerged as both a practical and a social consideration. Finally, the data revealed “balance of power” as a coherent process that explicates the relationships between design, operations, and behavior. Designers have the power to recommend <b>plug</b> <b>load</b> strategies and technologies but are limited by costs, maintenance, and political concerns; operations personnel have the power to impose limits on student power usage but are often reluctant to interfere with the overall living experience; and students have the power to use <b>plug</b> <b>load</b> electricity with few restrictions. This suggests that the balance may be skewed toward student behavior...|$|R
