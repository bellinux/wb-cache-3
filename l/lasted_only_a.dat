5|$|The {{official}} {{attendance of}} the event was 134,476, of which 70,000 were estimated {{to be in the}} infield of Churchill Downs. This surpassed the previous Derby record of 130,564; however the record <b>lasted</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> year as the 1974 edition attracted 163,628 spectators. Dwight Chapin of Los Angeles Times and author Timothy Capps credited the increased attendance due to Secretariat's loss at the Wood.|$|E
5|$|By 1962, {{both the}} United States and the Soviet Union had flown two solo spaceflights in the Space Race. There was a {{widespread}} perception, however, that the United States was falling behind; its two missions had been suborbital and had <b>lasted</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few minutes. The Soviet missions had both orbited the Earth, and the second, Vostok 2, had remained in orbit {{for a full}} day.

5|$|Capper {{oversaw the}} first Army aeroplanes. He briefly flew Dunne's first glider, the D.1, during secret trials at Blair Atholl in Scotland in 1907. The flight had <b>lasted</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few seconds when the glider {{crashed into a}} wall, with Capper {{sustaining}} a cut to the head. The next year, Cody flew the first British-built aeroplane at Farnborough, which earned it the title British Army Aeroplane No.1. This was an ironic achievement for Capper's command, as he had pinned his personal hopes on Dunne, whose D.4 achieved {{no more than a}} few hops.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{wholesale}} destruction of plants at the K–Pg boundary, {{there was a}} proliferation of saprotrophic organisms, such as fungi, {{that do not require}} photosynthesis and use nutrients from decaying vegetation.

Once the atmosphere cleared, photosynthetic organisms, such as ferns and other plants, returned.|$|E
5|$|Fielding first {{produced}} a play in February 1728. Although his first production, Love in Several Masques, <b>lasted</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few nights, {{it was the}} start of his career in theatre. On 16 March 1728, Fielding enrolled at the University of Leyden, but he did not abandon the theatre. His early plays were those of an amateur hobby, but he later returned to London to earn a living. Arthur Murphy, in his 1762 biographical introduction to Fielding's works, believed that Fielding returned to London and treated the theatre as a career because his father stopped an allowance of 200 pounds a year.|$|E

His aunt Caroline Praill—his mother's sister—who lived in nearby Edgbaston, gave him a home, while he worked as an errand boy in a Birmingham {{building}} firm. This arrangement <b>lasted</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few months before Horatio, impatient {{to be reunited with}} his sister from whom he had been separated for six years, went to London where he began an apprenticeship with a wood engraver.|$|E

5|$|The {{police did}} not {{initially}} investigate; no crime had been committed, and the morals of ministers were not their concern. Although the relationship <b>lasted</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few weeks it became public knowledge in 1962.

Thirteen of the twenty received sentences of fifteen years' imprisonment, while five were sentenced to five years and two were sentenced to ten years.

5|$|A {{clash between}} local Torajan {{leaders and the}} South Sulawesi provincial {{government}} (as a tourist developer) broke out in 1985. The government designated 18 Toraja villages and burial sites as traditional tourist attractions. Consequently, zoning restrictions were applied to these areas, such that Torajans themselves were barred from changing their tongkonans and burial sites. The plan was opposed by some Torajan leaders, as they felt that their rituals and traditions were being determined by outsiders. As a result, in 1987, the Torajan village of Kété Kesú and several other designated tourist attractions closed their doors to tourists. This closure <b>lasted</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few days, as the villagers found it too difficult to survive without the income from selling souvenirs.|$|E
5|$|Aldfrith died {{soon after}} Wilfrid's arrival back in England. The new king, Eadwulf, had been {{considered}} one of Wilfrid's friends, but after his accession to the throne he ordered Wilfrid {{to stay out of}} Northumbria. Eadwulf's reign <b>lasted</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few months however, before he was expelled to make way for Aldfrith's son Osred, to whom Wilfrid acted as spiritual adviser. Wilfrid may have been one of Osred's chief supporters, along with Oswiu's daughter Abbess Ælfflæd of Whitby, and the nobleman Beornhæth. Once Osred was secure on the throne Wilfrid was restored to Ripon and Hexham in 706. When Bosa of York died, however, Wilfrid did not contest the decision to appoint John of Beverley to York. This appointment meant John's transfer from Hexham, leaving Wilfrid free to perform episcopal functions at Hexham, which he did until his death.|$|E

5|$|An {{agreement}} was signed with Amadeus in 2007 to upgrade Biman's ticketing system with an e-ticketing solution {{to comply with}} IATA rules, which set out a deadline of 31 December 2007 for all member airlines to switch over their ticketing systems. E-ticketing has enabled major airlines to provide online check-in facilities, reducing the need to queue up at check-in counters. However, Biman has not made any attempts to improve customer service through the adoption of e-ticketing, {{although it has been}} able to reduce its own costs. In 2005, Biman had briefly stopped using the Amadeus ticketing system when the government suspended the operation of a local Amadeus subsidiary following a court order, after allegations of money laundering. The suspension, however, <b>lasted</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> month, and was lifted after the writ was appealed in the High Court.|$|E
5|$|By 1895, she was {{withdrawn}} from front-line service {{and used for}} fishery protection. This duty <b>lasted</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> year, after which she was placed out of service. In 1899, she was reclassified as a light cruiser, along with her sister ship , though both vessels remained out of service. Meteor {{was used as a}} harbor guard ship starting on 3 May 1904. On 24 June 1911, she was stricken from the naval register and used as a barracks ship in Kiel. She served in this capacity through World War I. After the German defeat, the ship was sold for scrapping in 1919. Meteor thereafter was broken up in Rendsburg.|$|E
