Four leisure educators were interviewed to answer these questions. The study is based on qualitative interviews, wich means that the interviewer must interpret and understand what the respondents want to say.

It is important that the correct conditions exist for them to be able to see each child's needs and interests. The conditions are that the presence of trained staff, adequate staff and a good working relationship with the school.
