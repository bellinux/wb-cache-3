40|$|We have {{developed}} a system for the isolation of Neurospora crassa mutants that shows altered responses to blue light. To this end we have used the light-regulated promoter of the albino- 3 gene fused to the neutral amino acid permease gene mtr. The product of the mtr gene {{is required for the}} uptake of neutral aliphatic and aromatic amino acids, as well as toxic analogs such as p-flurophenylalanine or 4 -methyltryptophan. mtr trp- 2 -carrying cells were transformed with the al- 3 promoter-mtr wild-type gene (al- 3 p-mtr+) to obtain a strain with a light-regulated tryptophan uptake. This strain is sensitive to p-fluorophenylalanine when grown under illumination and resistant when grown in the dark. UV mutagenesis of the al- 3 p-mtr(+) -carrying strain allowed us to isolate two mutant strains, BLR- 1 and BLR- 2 (blue <b>light</b> <b>regulator),</b> that are light-resistant to p-fluorophenylalanine and have lost the ability to grow on tryptophan. These two strains have a pale-orange phenotype and show down-regulation of all the photoregulated genes tested (al- 3, al- 1, con- 8, and con- 10).

Despite their similarity, env 1 could not compensate {{for the lack of}} vvd function. Besides the effect of light on sporulation, we observed a reduced growth rate in constant light. An env 1 PAS− mutant of H. jecorina grows significantly slower in the presence of light but remains unaffected in darkness compared to the wild-type strain QM 9414. env 1 rapidly responds to a light pulse, with this response being different upon growth on glucose or glycerol, and it encodes a regulator essential for H. jecorina light tolerance. The induction of cellulase transcription in H. jecorina by cellulose is enhanced by light in the wild-type strain QM 9414 compared to that in constant darkness, whereas a delayed induction in light and only a transient up-regulation in constant darkness of cbh 1 was observed in the env 1 PAS− mutant. However, light does not lead to cellulase expression {{in the absence of an}} inducer.

40|$|Abstract Background In nature, {{light is}} one of the most {{important}} environmental cues that fungi perceive and interpret. It is known not only to influence growth and conidiation, but also cellulase gene expression. We therefore studied the relevance of the main components of the light perception machinery of Trichoderma reesei (Hypocrea jecorina), ENV 1, BLR 1 and BLR 2, for production of plant cell wall degrading enzymes in fermentations aimed at efficient biosynthesis of enzyme mixtures for biofuel production. Findings Our results indicate that despite cultivation in mostly dark conditions, all three components show an influence on cellulase expression. While we found the performance of the enzyme mixture secreted by a deletion mutant in env 1 to be enhanced, the higher cellulolytic activity observed for Δblr 2 is mainly due to an increased secretion capacity of this strain. Δblr 1 showed enhanced biomass accumulation, but due to its obviously lower secretion capacity still was the least efficient strain in this study. Conclusions We conclude that with respect to regulation of plant cell wall degrading enzymes, the blue <b>light</b> <b>regulator</b> proteins are unlikely to act as a complex. Their regulatory influence on cellulase biosynthesis involves an alteration of protein secretion, which may be due to adjustment of transcription or posttranscriptional regulation of upstream factors. In contrast, the regulatory function of ENV 1 seems to involve adjustment of enzyme proportions to environmental conditions. </p...|$|E
40|$|The photolyases, DNA repair {{enzymes that}} use visible and long-wavelength UV light to repair cyclobutane {{pyrimidine}} dimers (CPDs) created by short-wavelength UV, {{belong to the}} larger photolyase-cryptochrome gene family. Cryptochromes (UVA-blue light photoreceptors) lack repair activity, and sensory and regulatory roles have been defined for them in plants and animals. Evolutionary considerations indicate that cryptochromes diverged from CPD photolyases before the emergence of eukaryotes. In prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes, some photolyases might have photosensory functions. phr 1 codes for a class I CPD photolyase in Trichoderma atroviride. phr 1 is rapidly induced by blue and UVA light, and its photoinduction requires functional blue <b>light</b> <b>regulator</b> (BLR) proteins, which are White Collar homologs in Trichoderma. Here we show that deletion of phr 1 abolished photoreactivation of UVC (200 to 280 nm) -inhibited spores and thus that PHR 1 is {{the main component of}} the photorepair system. The 2 -kb 5 ′ upstream region of phr 1, with putative light-regulated elements, confers blue light regulation on a reporter gene. To assess phr 1 photosensory function, fluence response curves of this light-regulated promoter were tested in null mutant (Δphr 1) strains. Photoinduction of the phr 1 promoter in Δphr 1 strains was > 5 -fold more sensitive to light than that in the wild type, whereas in PHR 1 -overexpressing lines the sensitivity to light increased about 2 -fold. Our data suggest that PHR 1 may regulate its expression in a light-dependent manner, perhaps through negative modulation of the BLR proteins. This is the first evidence for a regulatory role of photolyase, a role usually attributed to cryptochromes...|$|E
40|$|Although the enzymes {{enabling}} Hypocrea jecorina (anamorph Trichoderma reesei) {{to degrade}} the insoluble substrate cellulose {{have been investigated}} in some detail, little is still known about the mechanism by which cellulose signals its presence to the fungus. In order to investigate the possible role of a G-protein/cyclic AMP signaling pathway, the gene encoding GNA 3, which belongs to the adenylate cyclase-activating class III of G-alpha subunits, was cloned. gna 3 is clustered {{in tandem with the}} mitogen-activated protein kinase gene tmk 3 and the glycogen phosphorylase gene gph 1. The gna 3 transcript is upregulated in the presence of light and is almost absent in the dark. A strain bearing a constitutively activated version of GNA 3 (gna 3 QL) exhibits strongly increased cellulase transcription {{in the presence of the}} inducer cellulose and in the presence of light, whereas a gna 3 antisense strain showed delayed cellulase transcription under this condition. However, the gna 3 QL mutant strain was unable to form cellulases in the absence of cellulose. The necessity of light for stimulation of cellulase transcription by GNA 3 could not be overcome in a mutant which expressed gna 3 under control of the constitutive gpd 1 promoter also in darkness. We conclude that the previously reported stimulation of cellulase gene transcription by light, but not the direct transmission of the cellulose signal, involves the function and activation of GNA 3. The upregulation of gna 3 by light is influenced by the light modulator ENVOY, but GNA 3 itself has no effect on transcription of the <b>light</b> <b>regulator</b> genes blr 1, blr 2, and env 1.

40|$|Species of the mycoparasitic fungal genus Hypocrea/Trichoderma are {{prominent}} producers of peptaibols, {{a class of}} small linear peptides of fungal origin. Some of these peptaibols {{have been shown to}} act synergistically with cell-wall-degrading enzymes in the inhibition of the growth of other fungi in vitro and in vivo. Here we present the structure of the Hypocrea atroviridis peptaibol synthetase gene (pbs 1), deduced from the genome sequence of H. atroviridis. It consists of 19 typical peptide synthetase modules with the required additional modifying domains at the N and C termini. Phylogenetic and similarity analyses of the individual amino acid-activating modules is consistent with its ability to synthesize atroviridins. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry of surface-grown cultures of H. atroviridis showed that no peptaibols were formed during vegetative growth, but a microheterogenous mixture of atroviridins accumulated when the colonies started to sporulate. This correlation between sporulation and atroviridin formation was shown to be independent of the pathway inducing sporulation (i. e., light, mechanical injury and carbon starvation, respectively). Atroviridin formation was dependent on the function of the two blue <b>light</b> <b>regulators,</b> BLR 1 and BLR 2, under some but not all conditions of sporulation and was repressed in a pkr 1 (regulatory subunit of protein kinase A) antisense strain with constitutively active protein kinase A.

The initial synthesis in leaves {{of all four}} mRNAs follows a lightindependent schedule; illumination influences only the level to which each mRNA accumulates.

However, how FIN 219 /JAR 1 integrates FR light and JA signaling remains largely unknown. We used a microarray approach to dissect the effect of fin 219 mutation on the interaction of FR light and JA signaling. The fin 219 - 2 mutant was less sensitive than the wild type to various concentrations of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) under low and high FR light. High FR light reduced the sensitivity of Arabidopsis seedlings to MeJA likely through FIN 219. Intriguingly, in response to MeJA, FIN 219 levels showed a negative feedback regulation. Further microarray assay revealed that FR light could regulate gene expression by FIN 219 -dependent or -independent pathways. The expression profiles affected in fin 219 - 2 indicated that FIN 219 /JAR 1 plays a critical role in the integration of multiple hormone-related signaling. In particular, FIN 219 regulates a number of transcription factors (TFs), including 94 basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs, in response to FR light and MeJA. Loss-of-function mutants of some bHLH TFs affected by FIN 219 showed altered responses to MeJA in the regulation of hypocotyl and root elongation. Thus, FIN 219 /JAR 1 is tightly regulated in response to exogenous MeJA. It also interacts with multiple plant hormones to modulate hypocotyl and root elongation of Arabidopsis seedlings likely by regulating a group of TFs...|$|R
40|$|Photolyase is a DNA {{repair enzyme}} that reverses UV-induced photoproducts in DNA in a light-dependent manner. Recently, photolyase homologs were {{identified}} in higher eukaryotes. These homologs, termed cryptochromes, function as blue <b>light</b> photoreceptors or <b>regulators</b> of circadian rhythm. In contrast, most bacteria have only a single photolyase or photolyase-like gene. Unlike other microbes, the chromosome of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 contains two ORFs (slr 0854 and sll 1629) with high similarities to photolyases. We have characterized both genes. The slr 0854 gene product exhibited specific, light-dependent repair activity for a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD), whereas the sll 1629 gene product lacks measurable affinity for DNA in vitro. Disruption of either slr 0854 or sll 1629 {{had little or no}} effect on the growth rate of the cyanobacterium. A mutant lacking the slr 0854 gene showed severe UV sensitivity, in contrast to a mutant lacking sll 1629. Phylogenetic analysis showed that sll 1629 is more closely related to the cryptochromes than photolyases. We conclude that sll 1629 is a bacterial cryptochrome. To our knowledge, this is the first description of a bacterial cryptochrome...|$|R

Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni {{is a member of}} Compositae family. Stevia plant has zero calorie content and its leaves are estimated to be 300 times sweeter than sugar. This plant {{is believed to be the}} most ideal substitute for sugar and important to assist in medicinal value especially for diabetic patients. In this study, microcutting techniques using a mist-chamber propagation box were used as it was beneficial for propagation of Stevia and gave genetic uniformity to the plant. The effects of different treatments on root stimulation of Stevia in microcuttings technique were evaluated. Treatments studied were different sizes of shoot cuttings, plant growth <b>regulators,</b> <b>lights,</b> and shades. Data logger was used to record the mean value of humidity (> 90 % RH), light intensity (673 – 2045 lx), and temperature (28. 6 – 30. 1 ∘C) inside themist-chamber propagation box. From analysis of variance, there were significant differences between varieties and treatments in parameters studied...|$|R
40|$|Development of the {{reproductive}} system was retarded in cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) exposed to short daylengths (10 h of light/day, 1 OL: 14 D) from birth- 50 days of age. Com-pared with animals exposed to long daylengths (14 L: 1 OD), the seminal vesicles and testes of of short-day reared rats were reduced in weight. However, spermatogenesis {{and development of}} the testicular interstitial apparatus were not affected by photoperiod or blinding. Short day ex-posure and blinding from birth also delayed vaginal opening but were without apparent effect on ovulation or the number of corpora lutea formed. Long term exposure (up to 20 weeks) to short daylengths did not affect the gonads of adult male cotton rats; constant darkness and blinding also exerted few if any substantial effects on the male gonad. The prepubertal cotton rat measures and is sensitive to photoperiod duration and the sexually mature individual becomes relatively free from the dictates of photoperiod as regards reproductive morphology. Overall {{the reproductive}} system of this species {{does not appear to be}} subject to photoperiodic regulation. It is concluded that proximate factors other than <b>light</b> are important <b>regulators</b> of the seasonal reproductive cycle...|$|R
40|$|Plants exhibit daily rhythms {{in their}} growth, {{providing}} an ideal {{system for the}} study of interactions between environmental stimuli such as <b>light</b> and internal <b>regulators</b> such as the circadian clock. We previously found that two basic loop-helix-loop transcription factors, PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 4 (PIF 4) and PIF 5, integrate light and circadian clock signaling to generate rhythmic plant growth in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Here, we use expression profiling and real-time growth assays to identify growth regulatory networks downstream of PIF 4 and PIF 5. Genome-wide analysis of light-, clock-, or growth-correlated genes showed significant overlap between the transcriptomes of clock-, light-, and growth-related pathways. Overrepresentation analysis of growth-correlated genes predicted that the auxin and gibberellic acid (GA) hormone pathways both contribute to diurnal growth control. Indeed, lesions of GA biosynthesis genes retarded rhythmic growth. Surprisingly, GA-responsive genes are not enriched among genes regulated by PIF 4 and PIF 5, whereas auxin pathway and response genes are. Consistent with this finding, the auxin response is more severely affected than the GA response in pif 4 pif 5 double mutants and in PIF 5 -overexpressing lines. We conclude that at least two downstream modules participate in diurnal rhythmic hypocotyl growth: PIF 4 and/or PIF 5 modulation of auxin-related pathways and PIF-independent regulation of the GA pathway...|$|R
