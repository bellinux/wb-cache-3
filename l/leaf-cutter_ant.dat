40|$|Insects, in general, are agile creatures {{capable of}} {{navigating}} uneven and difficult terrain with ease.

40|$|The {{literature}} {{data on the}} digestive enzymes present in different taxonomic groups of ants are reviewed and their patterns of occurrence across the various groups are tested. Data are available on 32 digestive enzymes from 62 ant species from 15 tribes belonging to seven subfamilies (Dolichoderinae, Ecitoninae, Formicinae, Myrmicinae, Paraponerinae, Ponerinae, and Pseudomyrmecinae). <b>Leaf-cutter</b> <b>ants</b> (Myrmicinae, higher Attini) are the best-investigated group. Nearly all analysed enzymes were present in all the species investigated, irrespective of taxonomic group. The only significant difference across taxonomic groups concerns enzymes that attack plant structural polysaccharides (cellulases, pectinase, xylanase). These were more frequent in <b>leaf-cutter</b> <b>ants</b> than in other groups.

50|$|On April 8, 15, and 22, 2015, {{a three-part}} series titled 'Animal Homes' hosted and narrated by Morgan aired on PBS 'NATURE.' 'Animal Homes' {{examines}} the various structures, building methods, and social networks utilized by {{animals in the}} wild to protect themselves and their young from predators, invaders, and the natural elements. The series' first episode ('The Nest') focuses on what birds build to house their clutches of eggs using only their beaks and feet and the social interactions they confront while incubating and raising their young. Morgan is shown trying his hand at building a structurally sound nest, testing the strength of other avian structures, and presenting the collection of bird's nests owned by the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University. Episode two ('Location Location Location'), examines the importance of choosing an appropriate environment for an animal's home and the strategies employed in maximizing their success. In the episode, Morgan observes the dam and lodge building rituals of beavers, the protective relationship between hummingbird bird nests and their proximity to those of raptors, and takes part in the processing of a mother black bear and her cubs who had been hibernating in the forests of Maryland. Morgan is featured in the third episode ('Animal Cities') observing a colony of nesting puffins in northwest Scotland, scuba diving off of Corsica to inspect the complex social and reproductive strategies of the oscillated wrasse, and excavating the fungal garden of a <b>leaf-cutter</b> <b>ant</b> nest in the rainforest.|$|E
40|$|Leaf-cutter ants (Atta spp.) remove {{leaf litter}} and woody debris—potential fuels—in and around their nests and {{foraging}} trails. We conducted single and three annual experimental fires {{to determine the}} effects of this <b>leaf-cutter</b> <b>ant</b> activity on the behavior of low-intensity, slow-moving fires. In a transitional forest, where the southern Amazon forest meets the Brazilian savanna, we tested whether <b>leaf-cutter</b> <b>ant</b> nests and trails (i) inhibit fire spread due to a lack of fuels, and (ii), thereby, reduce the total burned area during these experimental low-intensity fires, particularly at forest edges where <b>leaf-cutter</b> <b>ant</b> abundance was higher. Fine-medium fuel mass increased with an increase in distance from ant nest, and the mean area of bare soil was greater on nests than on the forest floor. Between 60 to 90 percent of the unburned area was within 30 [*]m of ant nests, and burned area significantly increased with increasing distance to ant nests. In addition, the number of ant nests declined with increasing distance from the forest edge, and, with exception of the first experimental fire, burned area also increased with increasing distance from the edge. The present study provides new insight to fire ecology in Amazon environments...|$|E

40|$|Background: Leaf-cutter ants use fresh plant {{material}} {{to grow a}} mutualistic fungus {{that serves as the}} ants ’ primary food source. Within fungus gardens, various plant compounds are metabolized and transformed into nutrients suitable for ant consumption. This symbiotic association produces a large amount of refuse consisting primarily of partly degraded {{plant material}}. A <b>leaf-cutter</b> <b>ant</b> colony is thus divided into two spatially and chemically distinct environments that together represent a plant biomass degradation gradient. Little is known about the microbial community structure in gardens and dumps or variation between lab and field colonies. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using microbial membrane lipid analysis and a variety of community metrics, we assessed and compared the microbiota of fungus gardens and refuse dumps from both laboratory-maintained and field-collected colonies. We found that gardens contained a diverse and consistent community of microbes, dominated by Gram-negative bacteria, particularly c-Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. These findings were consistent across lab and field gardens, as well as host ant taxa. In contrast, dumps were enriched for Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria. Broad-scale clustering analyses revealed that community relatedness between samples reflected system component (gardens/dumps) rather than colony source (lab/field). At finer scales samples clustered according to colony source. Conclusions/Significance: Here we report the first comparative analysis of the microbiota from <b>leaf-cutter</b> <b>ant</b> colonies.

50|$|Distance of {{dispersal}} {{is entirely}} {{dependent upon the}} distance the ant travels, so it has been seen that seeds are carried only short distances, at least when this method is {{compared to that of}} vertebrate or wind dispersal. While studies show that the soil in which <b>leaf-cutter</b> <b>ants</b> build their nests are favorable to plant growth, there is some debate among researchers whether collection by the <b>leaf-cutter</b> <b>ants</b> increases the actual rate at which germination occurs. However, seedlings are negatively affected by shade, and the soil under the parent tree. A. striatus removes the seed and deposits it at the nest, where conditions are sunny with favorable soil. Another benefit to being shipped by ants is escaping more natural predators., Ripe fruit containing seeds fall underneath the tree, and vertebrates will often search in these areas. If the ants get there first, seeds will escape organisms that would actually eat the seed.|$|R

40|$|In many species, females store sperm between {{copulation}} and egg fertilization, but {{the consequences}} of sperm storage and patterns of sperm use for female life history and reproductive success have not been investigated in great detail. In hymenopteran insect societies (ants, bees, wasps), reproduction is usually monopolized by one or relatively few queens, who mate only during a brief period early in life and store sperm for later use. The queens of some ants are particularly long-lived and {{have the potential to}} produce millions of offspring during their life. To do so, queens store many sperm cells, and this sperm must remain viable throughout the years of storage. Queens should also be under strong selection to use stored sperm prudently when fertilizing eggs. We used the <b>leaf-cutter</b> <b>ant</b> Atta colombica to investigate the dynamics of sperm use during egg fertilization. We show that queens are able to fertilize close to 100 per cent of the eggs and that the average sperm use per egg is very low, but increases with queen age. The robustness of stored sperm was found to decrease with years of storage, signifying that senescence affects sperm either directly or indirectly via the declining glandular secretions or deteriorating sperm-storage organs. We evaluate our findings with a heuristic model, which suggests that the average queen has sperm for almost 9 years of normal colony development. We discuss the extent to which <b>leaf-cutter</b> <b>ant</b> queens have been able to optimize their sperm expenditure and infer that our observed averages of sperm number, sperm robustness and sperm use are consistent with sperm depletion being a significant cause of mortality of mature colonies of Atta leaf-cutter ants...|$|E
