40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{research}} shows a close association between language development and Executive Function (EF). However, these studies are mostly focused on school-aged children. Much less is known about this issue in preschoolers and/or toddlers. The aim {{of this study was to}} address this gap by exploring the relationships between emerging EF skills (working memory, inhi- bition, cognitive exibility) and age-appropriate linguistic measures (<b>lexical</b> <b>ability,</b> function word omissions, Mean Length of Utterance - MLU) during toddlerhood. Two groups (24 - 30 months of age), each one consisting of 20 typically developing children, participated in the study. The results showed that the relations between cognitive and linguistic measures changed from 24 to 30 months of age: at 24 months, only morpho-syntactic measures signi cantly correlated with cognitive exibility, whereas at 30 months both <b>lexical</b> <b>ability</b> and LME signi cantly correlated with the three FE mea- sures. Moreover, function word omissions correlated with cognitive exibility and inhibition. When checking on age and <b>lexical</b> <b>ability,</b> only cognitive exibility was associated with morpho-syntactic complexity. These results are discussed in the light of emergentist-dynamic developmental models...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{cross-sectional}} study {{that focuses on}} the assessment of the semantic network in the mental lexicon of second language learners. Generally, the number of words a learner claims to know is a reflection of achievement and advances in his vocabulary knowledge. However, the size of a learner's vocabulary knowledge only reveals half of the story about his lexical competence. An understanding of the quality of word knowledge allows for a clearer interpretation of the organisation and integration of lexical items in the mental lexicon. Typically, vocabulary researchers have utilised word association tests to measure vocabulary depth. However, there are several problems with the traditional methodology of this test, which has resulted in some inaccurate claims about a non-native speaker's <b>lexical</b> <b>ability,</b> such as the dichotomous native-like versus non-native-like categorisation of <b>lexical</b> <b>ability.</b> The aim of this thesis study was to test an alternative word association test that claims to capture partial native-like lexical knowledge in non-native speakers. Up to this point, this method had only been developed and tested on native speakers of English. The results of the analysis in this study reveal that this test does capture a range of native-like levels of <b>lexical</b> <b>ability</b> in non-native speakers of English. The findings suggest that this alternate word association measure of vocabulary depth could be used in conjunction with other language and vocabulary measures for both diagnostic and placement purposes. The information gained from this study provides a new approach to and understanding of vocabulary acquisition research and assessment...|$|E
40|$|Studies of {{language}} in children with mild-to-moderate hearing impairment (HI) indicate that they often have problems in phonological shortterm memory (PSTM) {{and that they have}} linguistic weaknesses both in vocabulary and morphosyntax similar to children with specific language impairment (SLI). However, children with HI may be more likely than children with SLI to acquire typical language skills as they get older. It has been suggested that the more persisting problems in children with SLI are due to a combination of factors: perceptual, cognitive and/or linguistic. Aims: The main aim {{of this study was to}} explore language skills in children with HI in comparison with children with SLI, and how children with both HI and language impairment differ from those with non-impaired spoken language skills. Methods & Procedures: PSTM, output phonology, <b>lexical</b> <b>ability,</b> receptive grammar and verb morphology were assessed in a group of children with mild-to-moderate HI (n= 11) and a group of children with SLI (n= 12) aged 5 years 6 months to 9 years 0 months. Outcomes & Results: The HI group tended to score higher than the SLI group on the language measures, although few of the differences were significant. The children with HI had their most obvious weaknesses in PSTM, vocabulary, receptive grammar and inflection of novel verbs. The subgroup of children with HI (five out of 10) who also showed evidence of grammatical output problems was significantly younger than the remaining children with HI. Correlation analysis showed that the language variables were not associated with age, whereas hearing level was associated with PSTM. Conclusions: Children with HI are at risk for at least a delay in <b>lexical</b> <b>ability,</b> receptive grammar and grammatical production. The problems seen in the HI group might be explained by their low-level perceptual deficit and weak PSTM. For the SLI group the impairment is more severe. From a clinical perspective an important conclusion is that the language development in children with even mild-to-moderate HI deserves attention and support...|$|E

40|$|Inflectional {{spelling}} abilities {{have been}} less extensively studied than <b>lexical</b> spelling <b>abilities</b> {{and the relationship between}} these two types of spelling abilities is poorly understood. In this study, we compared lexical and inflectional spelling abilities in 12 -year-old children, by hypothesizing that attentional load may be particularly detrimental for sentence context-dependent inflectional spelling abilities, in contrast to sentence context-independent <b>lexical</b> spelling <b>abilities.</b> Ninety-five sixth graders had to write to dictation sentences containing orthographically inconsistent words as well as inflected words (plural nouns and verbs at the 3 th person) in three different cognitive load conditions. In a medium load condition, a time constraint obliged the subjects to write the sentences as quickly as possible. In a high load condition, the participants had to write the sentences as quickly as possible while further carrying out calculation problems (additions). The minimal load condition corresponded to standard writing to dictation, with no time constraint or any secondary task. The number of spelling errors for orthographically inconsistent words (<b>lexical</b> spelling <b>abilities)</b> and inflected words (inflectional spelling abilities) was calculated for each condition. We observed that spelling performance for inconsistent words was not impacted by cognitive load. On the other hand, spelling performance for inflected words decreased significantly in the medium and high load conditions. These results suggest that inflectional spelling abilities are less proceduralized than <b>lexical</b> spelling <b>abilities,</b> and rely to a greater extent on cognitive control processes...|$|R

40|$|Vocabulary {{knowledge}} {{is the basis}} of language ability. For learners, increasing the number of words and phrases they know {{is the most important thing}} they can do to improve their ability. However, lexical competence involves much more than simply memorizing long lists. All words have various aspects of knowledge. Some examples are syntactic and semantic behavior, derivations, active and passive knowledge, collocations and the network of associations and knowledge of polysemy. (e. g. Richards, 1976; Melka, 1997) However, for a typical inter-mediate learner who knows several thousand head words, assessing the overall state of her vocabulary knowledge would be impossible if all these aspects were taken into account. Understandably, teachers often rely on one-time vocabulary tests of L 2 -L 1 translation knowledge. But since such tests constitute only a tiny fraction of known words and target only one facet of knowledge, they reveal little about the overall state of lexical development. Moreover, the development of lexical competence is not linear or monotonic. It progresses in spurts and regresses with disuse, as any committed language learner has experienced. Clearly, sensitive, practical testing tools are needed to assess the various facets of L 2 <b>lexical</b> <b>ability.</b> This paper will deal with the testing of L 2 word recognition ability...|$|E

40|$|In {{an earlier}} study by the authors, it was {{suggested}} that some fluent aphasic speakers exhibit subtle grammatical deficits. In this paper, how far lexical accessing problems might account for these deficits is considered. For this study, spontaneous speech data collected from two groups of aphasic speakers, Dutch and English, and from normal controls are analysed. As expected, differences are found between the aphasic and the control groups. The English aphasic group was significantly different from the control group on lexical and grammatical measures. There was {{a significant difference between the}} Dutch aphasic group and the normal controls for one lexical measure (types and tokens of nouns used) and for one grammatical measure, the proportion of embedded clauses used. The relationship between the aphasic speakers' grammatical and <b>lexical</b> <b>abilities</b> is explored by comparing the distribution of clausal structures with the frequency and diversity of verb and noun use. A number of dissociations are found between the grammatical and the lexical measures within the aphasic groups which suggests that difficulty with lexical accessing may not always account for the grammatical limitations of fluent aphasics...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{investigated}} cognitive, {{linguistic and}} narrative abilities {{in a group}} of children suffering from Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, an allelic X-linked recessive disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding dystrophin. The patients showed mildly reduced IQ with lower Verbal than Performance Intelligence Quotient and were mildly affected in visual attention and short-term memory processing. At the linguistic assessment, neither receptive (word comprehension) nor expressive (naming tasks and fluency) <b>lexical</b> <b>abilities</b> were impaired. However, their narratives were qualitatively inferior with respect to those produced by a group of typically developing children. Their speech samples were characterized by the presence of fewer verbs and complete sentences. It is suggested that the reduced production of complete sentences is due to a selective problem in verb argument structure generation. Since the lack of dystrophin is assumed to produce effects on the maturation of the cerebellum, whose involvement has been recently suggested in verb and syntactic processing, these findings may lend indirect support to the hypothesis of a cerebellar-cortical circuit specialized in verb and sentence production...|$|R

At tertiary level, sufficient word knowledge and lexical comprehension ensure sufficient literacy of language skills as learners need to cope with challenging academic tasks in their respective field of study. This paper reports findings of {{a case study of}} pre-degree Malaysian learners enrolled at Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Perlis. The study was undertaken to find out if these learners have sufficient <b>lexical</b> <b>ability</b> before they embark on a degree programme. Nine learners of varying proficiency levels of high, average and low language proficiency were selected for this study. The data were collected in sequential two-phased procedure. The first phase involved diagnostic stage of probing learners’ level of word knowledge with online Vocabulary Levels Test by Laufer and Nation. Subsequently, learners’ capability within the scope of word form, spelling and pronunciation was explored through the Academic Word List Test and in-depth interviews with the participants. The findings revealed that the learners’ word mastery level is only between 1, 000 and 3, 000 words, which is far below the minimum level required for tertiary education. These insights thus inform the researcher that urgent measures must be taken in order to redeem the situation. Hence, a structured vocabulary learning programme is deemed necessary in the Malaysian English language curriculum to help learners acquire sufficient lexis before embarking on tertiary education. This would also provide our tertiary learners with the avenue to make them employable and marketable graduates with firm language proficiency in general and lexical competence in particular...|$|E
40|$|Dyslexia is a language-based {{learning}} disability. Although {{this condition}} {{is characterized by}} anatomical malformation of the brain, {{it seems that the}} typical reading pattern of dyslexic may be also related to more complex sensory deficits. Among them, visual-perceptive deficits have been described in a subtype of dyslexia, called visual-perceptive dyslexia. The distinctive feature of a patient suffering from visual-perceptive dyslexia form is marked by effortlessly recognize the characteristics of each individual stimulus. The Tetra protocol is a visual-perceptual evaluation protocol that was introduced for the diagnostic phase and the rehabilitation of visual-perceptive dyslexia. The diagnostic tests include: the eidomorphometry test, designed to evaluate the perception of spatial relationships; the contrast sensitivity threshold test, especially at low spatial frequencies; and the REPORT TEST words, to assess the speed and the reading efficiency. In addition, the rehabilitation phase is carried out with the visual neuro-enhancement program TRIGRAM, a visual training proposal designed to reduce the lateral masking phenomenon in visual-perceptive dyslexic. Thus, in this study we used the diagnostic tests of TETRA® Protocol to determine presence of visual-perceptual abnormalities in children with dyslexia. Proven time the presence of these visual-perceptual alterations, the patients were also subjected to the rehabilitation sessions of TRIGRAM, in order to investigate whether this visual training may improve the pattern of reading. At {{the end of the program}} (t 1) and after three months (t 2), the same subjects underwent the same diagnostic tests of TETRA® Protocol to evaluate and confirm the results obtained during rehabilitation program. The results showed a significant increase in contrast sensitivity at low and high spatial frequencies. Moreover, the same improvements in the visual system's ability to discriminate the contours of an object within the field of view, have been maintained three months after the end of treatment. We also observed a significant improvement in the perception of spatial relationships, with reduction of SRA value. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the visual rehabilitation training (TRIGRAM) is able to improve the perception of spatial relationships, and increase contrast sensitivity in young patients affected by "visual dyslexia". Nonetheless, these data need to be confirmed in larger cohort of subjects in order to establish whether these effects can also increase <b>lexical</b> <b>ability</b> (increased reading speed and reduce errors during the lexical task). ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Dementia may {{be defined}} as the {{attenuation}} of cognitive powers despite preserved basal consciousness. Its most common cause is Alzheimer s disease (AD). Pathoanatomical staging {{has made it clear that}} the disease passes through a protracted preclinical phase with slowly emerging symptoms. Such symptoms may include various forms of forgetfulness, such as forgetting the names of people, things, and places. Because word finding also wanes somewhat with normal aging, objective tests of word finding might help in separating benign word lapses from those reductions in <b>lexical</b> <b>ability</b> that may herald dementia. Objectives: The main aim of the thesis was to identify speech production tests of relevance to the diagnosis of AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Material and Methods: The thesis is based on retrospective clinical data obtained from patients admitted to the memory clinic of the Department of Geriatrics, Karolinska University Hospital. All subjects had undergone an examination for possible dementia. Study I explored the interrelationships of three word fluency tests and performance differences between the diagnostic categories. Study II investigated whether reductions in regional brain blood flow affected performance in a verb fluency task and a noun fluency task. Study III examined the production of an automatic word sequence in forward and reverse order as a diagnostic target. Study IV analyzed the capacity for rapid articulatory action in AD and related disorders. Results: Verb, noun, and letter-based fluency were found to be factorially distinct tests although with covariance between factors. Noun fluency was disproportionately impaired in AD. In MCI, however, verb fluency was more decreased than noun or letter-based fluency. Verb fluency performance was predicted by educational level and temporal lobe blood flow, while noun fluency was predicted by age and parietotemporal-occipital blood flow. Forward word sequence production was preserved across diagnostic categories. In contrast, backward word sequence production was impaired in MCI and devastated in AD. The diagnostic predictive power of backward word sequence production was approximately equivalent to that of the widely-used Mini-Mental State Examination. Sequential speech motion rate was modestly reduced in MCI and AD, but more markedly so in frontotemporal dementia and progressive nonfluent aphasia. In semantic dementia, articulatory capacity was at the level of participants without objective cognitive impairment and superior to the other categories. Conclusion: Lexical production tasks have application to the diagnosis of MCI and mild AD. The capacity for rapid articulatory action varies both between and within AD and related disorders. The potential neural correlates of this variation remain to be explored by future studies...|$|E
40|$|Coming {{to grips}} with lexical {{richness}} in spontaneous speech data In spontaneous speech data, lexical richness is generally operationalized by meas-ures in which {{the relation between the}} number of types and tokens plays a role, of which the Type/Token Ratio (TTR) is the most famous. This article discusses {{the reliability and validity of}} different measures of lexical richness in various language data research and computer simulations, and examines the behaviour of these measures in spontaneous speech data of first language and second language children learning Dutch, aged four to seven, compared with their <b>lexical</b> <b>abilities</b> as measured by tests. The results show that neither the validity nor the reliability of the measures were satisfactory, especially the widely applied TTR. Initially, the number of types, or lemmas, and the Guiraud and Uber indexes seem to be adequate measures. However, in later stages of vocabulary acquisition (from 3000 words on) neither is valid. It is suggested that more effective measures of lexical richness might be based not on the distribution of or the relation between the types and tokens, but on the degree of difficulty of the words used, as measured by their (levels of) frequency in daily language input. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Children's {{low scores}} on {{vocabulary}} tests are often erroneously interpreted as reflecting poor cognitive and/or language skills. It {{may be necessary}} to incorporate the measurement of word-learning ability in estimating children's <b>lexical</b> <b>abilities.</b> Aims: To explore {{the reliability and validity of}} the Dynamic Assessment of Word Learning (DAWL), a new dynamic assessment of receptive vocabulary. Methods & Procedures: A dynamic assessment (DA) of word learning ability was developed and adopted within a nursery school setting with 15 children aged between 3; 07 and 4; 03, ten of whom had been referred to speech and language therapy. Outcomes & Results: A number of quantitative measures were derived from the DA procedure, including measures of children's ability to identify the targeted items and to generalize to a second exemplar, as well as measures of children's ability to retain the targeted items. Internal, inter-rater and test–retest reliability of the DAWL was established as well as correlational measures of concurrent and predictive validity. Conclusions & Implications: The DAWL was found to provide both quantitative and qualitative information which could be used to improve the accuracy of differential diagnosis and the understanding of processes underlying the child's performance.

Methods: A case series analysis of four Afrikaans/English bilingual aphasic individuals whose confrontation naming data were subjected to broad phonetic transcription was employed. Research questions were directed toward between language differences in <b>lexical</b> retrieval <b>abilities,</b> the influence of performance by degree of cognate overlap and types of errors produced.

40|$|There is {{an ongoing}} debate in the {{literature}} over {{the main source of}} information that children use when acquiring and developing language. Theories either support a computational linguistic perspective – in which children are thought to use aspects of language itself and their ability to perceive patterns to acquire language – or a social perspective, in which children are thought to use their ability to jointly attend with communication partners in order to acquire language. It is difficult to tease apart these sources of information in typically-developing children, but children with autism spectrum disorders have difficulty with both joint attention and language development, to varying degrees. The current study is a longitudinal analysis of specific language development in young children with autism and their typically-developing peers, using joint attention behaviors and computational behaviors to predict language growth. Joint attention proved to be important in lexical development but not as much in grammatical development, and computational abilities proved important specifically for pronoun use. Furthermore, the growth itself of early grammatical and <b>lexical</b> <b>abilities</b> predicted scores on later language tests. These results support a role for social abilities in the growth of lexical development, and a role for computational abilities on initial language abilities, but not on their growth over time...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAccording to the Procedural Deficit Hypothesis (PDH), {{abnormalities}} of brain structures underlying procedural memory largely explain the language deficits {{in children with}} specific language impairment (SLI). These abnormalities are posited to result in core deficits of procedural memory, which in turn explain the grammar problems in the disorder. The abnormalities {{are also likely to}} lead to problems with other, non-procedural functions, such as working memory, that rely at least partly on the affected brain structures. In contrast, declarative memory is expected to remain largely intact, and should play an important compensatory role for grammar. These claims were tested by examining measures of working, declarative and procedural memory in 51 children with SLI and 51 matched typically-developing (TD) children (mean age 10). Working memory was assessed with the Working Memory Test Battery for Children, declarative memory with the Children’s Memory Scale, and procedural memory with a visuo-spatial Serial Reaction Time task. As compared to the TD children, the children with SLI were impaired at procedural memory, even when holding working memory constant. In contrast, they were spared at declarative memory for visual information, and at declarative memory in the verbal domain after controlling for working memory and language. Visuo-spatial short-term memory was intact, whereas verbal working memory was impaired, even when language deficits were held constant. Correlation analyses showed neither visuo-spatial nor verbal working memory was associated with either <b>lexical</b> or grammatical <b>abilities</b> in either the SLI or TD children. Declarative memory correlated with <b>lexical</b> <b>abilities</b> in both groups of children. Finally, grammatical abilities were associated with procedural memory in the TD children, but with declarative memory in the children with SLI. These findings replicate and extend previous studies of working, declarative and procedural memory in SLI. Overall, we suggest that the evidence largely supports the predictions of the PDH...|$|R
40|$|Women {{are better}} than men at verbal memory tasks, such as remembering word lists. These tasks depend on {{declarative}} memory. The declarative/procedural model of language, which posits that the lexicon of stored words is part of declarative memory, while grammatical composition of complex forms depends on procedural memory, predicts a female superiority in aspects of lexical memory. Other neurocognitive models of language have not made this prediction. Here we examine the prediction in past-tense over-regularizations (e. g. holded) produced by children. We expected that girls would remember irregular past-tense forms (held) better than boys, and thus would over-regularize less. To our surprise, girls over-regularized far more than boys. We investigated potential explanations for this sex difference. Analyses showed that in girls but not boys, over-regularization rates correlated with measures {{of the number of}} similar-sounding regulars (folded, molded). This sex difference in phonological neighborhood effects is taken to suggest that girls tend to produce over-regularizations in associative lexical memory, generalizing over stored neighboring regulars, while boys are more likely to depend upon rule-governed affixation (hold +-ed). The finding is consistent with the hypothesis that, likely due to their superior <b>lexical</b> <b>abilities,</b> females tend to retrieve from memory complex forms (walked) that men generally compose with the grammatical system (walk +-ed).

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND:According to the {{linguistic}} determinism approach, knowledge of sentential complements such as: John {{says that the}} earth is flat {{plays a crucial role}} in theory of mind (ToM) development by providing a means to represent explicitly people's mental attitudes and beliefs. This approach predicts that mastery of complements determines successful belief reasoning across explicit ToM tasks, even low-verbal ones, and across populations. AIMS:(1) To investigate the link between a low-verbal ToM-task and complements in Specific Language Impairment (SLI), (2) To determine whether this population shows similar ToM performance to that of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or those with Typical Development (TD) once these groups are matched on competency for complements, (3) To explore whether complements conveying a falsehood without jeopardizing the veracity of the entire sentence, such as complements of verbs of communication, are more crucial for belief attribution than complements which do not have this property, namely complements of verbs of perception, (?John sees that the earth is flat). METHODS & PROCEDURES:Children with SLI (n = 20), with ASD (n = 34) and TD (n = 30) completed sentence-picture-matching tasks assessing complementation with communication and perception verbs, as well as a picture-sequencing task assessing ToM. Children were furthermore evaluated for general grammatical and <b>lexical</b> <b>abilities</b> and non-verbal IQ. OUTCOMES & RESULTS:Results reveal that competency on complements relates to ToM performance with a low-verbal task in SLI, and that SLI, ASD and TD groups of equivalent performance on complements also perform similarly for ToM. Results further suggest that complements with an independent truth-value are the only ones to show a significant relation to ToM performance after teasing out the impact of non-verbal reasoning. CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS:This study suggests that clinical groups of different aetiologies as well as TD children perform comparably for ToM once they have similar complementation skills. Findings further highlight that specific types of complements, namely those with an independent truth value, relate in a special way to mentalizing. Future work should determine whether these specific structures could be effective in ToM remediation programmes...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{comparing}} neuropsychological test scores in 83 cardiologists and nurses (exposed group, EG) {{working in the}} cardiac catheterization laboratory, and 83 control participants (non exposed group, nEG), to explore possible cognitive impairments. The neuropsychological assessment {{was carried out by}} means of a battery called Esame Neuropsicologico Breve. EG participants showed significantly lower scores on the delayed recall, visual short-term memory, and semantic <b>lexical</b> access <b>ability</b> than the nEG ones. No dose response could be detected. EG participants showed lower memory and verbal fluency performances, as compared with nEG. These reduced skills suggest alterations of some left hemisphere structures that are more exposed to IR in interventional cardiology staff. On the basis of these findings, therefore, head protection would be a mandatory good practice to reduce effects of head exposure to ionizing radiation among invasive cardiology personnel (and among other exposed professionals) ...|$|R
40|$|Disfluencies are {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} in everyday conversational speech, occurring approximately 6 times per 100 words. Previous studies attempting to explore what may affect the frequency of disfluencies in the spontaneous speech of typical speakers address factors such as age, gender and education. However, reliable trends between groups {{have been difficult to}} find, highlighting that there is not only huge variation between groups but also within. This study considers that the production of disfluencies such as silent pauses, filled pauses, repetitions, prolongations and repairs may be attributed to difficulties in the planning and formulation stages of spoken language production. Therefore, this study suggests that the variation may be as a result of both personal factors i. e rate and efficacy of an individual’s language production processes, and discourse related factors i. e cognitive and psycholinguistic demands the speech task places on the speaker. This study investigates the variation in the prevalence of disfluencies observed in spontaneous speech (average rate and type of disfluencies observed in 2 speech tasks) and how they correlate with rate of lexical access variation. Two speech tasks were completed within this study, with each placing different demands on the speaker. This study found {{a significant difference between the}} rates of disfluencies produced in each condition. To determine participants’ rate of lexical access 4 verbal fluency tasks were used: 2 semantic and 2 phonological fluency tasks. In this study a significant negative correlation is found between lexical access and the frequency of disfluencies in speech. Specifically, a strong significant negative correlation is established between <b>lexical</b> access <b>abilities</b> and rate of hesitations: suggesting that a reduced rate of lexical access will result in an increased frequency of hesitations. The results of this study indicate that <b>lexical</b> access <b>abilities</b> significantly contribute to the variation in disfluencies found in spontaneous speech. An attempt to explain this relationship is made within this study in relation to Levelt’s model of language production. Additionally the results of this study suggest that the variation in cognitive and psycholinguistic demands in the initial planning stage of language production also contribute to the variation in disfluency rates...|$|R
40|$|In non-fluent aphasia, oral {{expression}} is often agrammatic, i. e. grammatically incomplete and/or incorrect. By contrast, expression in fluent aphasia usually appears grammatical, albeit with disruptions in content. Despite this persistent impression, errors of sentence structure and morphology do occur in fluent aphasia, although {{they take the}} form of substitutions rather than omissions. This has been called ‘paragrammatism’. The underlying deficit giving rise to paragrammatism remains poorly understood, however. In this study, the <b>lexical</b> and grammatical <b>abilities</b> of an individual with paragrammatism and an individual with agrammatism are compared. The relationship between the two disorders, and their possible underpinnings, are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Readers {{and writers}} of Spanish use an orthography {{that is highly}} transparent. It has been {{proposed}} that readers of Spanish can rely on grapheme-phoneme correspondences, alone, to access meaning or phonology from print. In recent years, a number of case studies have yielded evidence inconsistent with this idea. We review these studies with particular focus on those that report evidence for reading based on direct lexical mappings between print, orthographic representations, and meaning or phonology. We report a new case of acquired literacy impairment in Spanish, MJ, who presents a pattern of preserved abilities and deficits symptomatic of deep dyslexia. The patient is unable to read nonwords, but can read {{a substantial number of}} words. Her reading is characterized by the production of semantic, visual, and derivational errors. We argue that MJ has a deficit in her <b>lexical</b> selection <b>ability,</b> common to both her reading and her naming problems. We propose that MJ, and the other cases we review, demonstrate that lexical reading is adopted by skilled readers even in a transparent language...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} prohibiting {{gestures}} on children’s <b>lexical</b> retrieval <b>ability</b> Two alternative accounts {{have been proposed}} to explain the role of gestures in thinking and speaking. The Information Packaging Hypothesis (Kita, 2000) claims that gestures are important for the conceptual packaging of information before it is coded into a linguistic form for speech. The Lexical Retrieval Hypothesis (Rauscher et al., 1996) sees gestures as functioning more {{at the level of}} speech production in helping the speaker to find the right words. The latter hypothesis has not been fully explored with children. In this study children were given a naming task under conditions that allowed and restricted gestures. Children named more words correctly and resolved more ‘tip-of-the-tongue’ states when allowed to gesture than when not, suggesting that gestures facilitate access to the lexicon in children and are important for speech production as well as conceptualization. - 3 -The effects of prohibiting gestures on children’s ability to retrieve words Like adults, children frequently gesture with their hands when they speak.

40|$|Extremely low {{gestational age}} (ELGA, GA. <. 28 weeks) preterm {{children}} {{are at high}} risk for linguistic impairments; however, their lexical comprehension and production as well as lexical categories in their early language acquisition have not been specifically examined via direct tools. Our study examines lexical comprehension and production as well as gestural production in ELGA children by focusing on noun and predicate acquisition. Forty monolingual ELGA children (mean GA of 26. 7 weeks) and 40 full-term (FT) children were assessed at two years of corrected chronological age (CCA) using a test of noun and predicate comprehension and production (PiNG) and the Italian MB-CDI. Noun comprehension and production were delayed in ELGA compared with FT children, as documented by the low number of correct responses and the large number of errors, i. e., incorrect responses and no-response items, and by the types of incorrect responses, i. e., fewer semantically related responses, in noun production. Regarding predicate comprehension and production, a higher frequency of no responses was reported by ELGA children and these children also presented a lower frequency of bimodal spoken-gestural responses in predicate production than FT children. A delayed vocabulary size as demonstrated by the MB-CDI, was exhibited by one-fourth of the ELGA children, who were also unable to complete the predicate subtest. These findings highlight that noun comprehension and production are delayed in ELGA children at two years of CCA and are the most important indexes for the direct evaluation of their <b>lexical</b> <b>abilities</b> and delay. The types of incorrect responses and bimodal spoken-gestural responses were proven to be useful indexes for evaluating the noun and predicate level of acquisition and to plan early focused interventions. Learning outcomes: After reading this manuscript, the reader will understand (a) the differences in noun and predicate comprehension and production between ELGA and FT children and the indexes of lexical delays exhibited by ELGA children at 2; 0 (CCA); (b) the relevance of evaluating errors (incorrect response and no response), the types of incorrect responses (semantically related and unrelated) and the modality of the responses (unimodal spoken and bimodal spoken-gestural) in noun and predicate production to understand the difficulties experienced by ELGA children in representing and expressing meanings; and (c) the need to plan specific interventions to support spoken and gestural modalities in lexical comprehension and production in ELGA children by focusing on noun and predicate acquisition...|$|R
40|$|Background & Aims: In {{order to}} {{understand}} better the <b>lexical</b> access <b>abilities</b> in children with word-finding difficulties, the extent of serial naming speed difficulties in these {{children as well as}} the degree to which serial and discrete naming tasks are related to one another and to literacy abilities was investigated. This enabled some of the predictions made in the double-deficit hypothesis of Wolf and Bowers to be tested. Methods & Procedures: Eighteen children with word-finding difficulties completed naming and literacy tasks at 8; 6 years and literacy tasks at 9; 8 years. Outcomes & Results: Children with word-finding difficulties had very slow serial naming, despite their non-verbal and literacy abilities often being in the typical range. Serial and discrete naming speeds were not closely related. The performance on serial naming tasks that involved alphanumeric items provided the strongest correlations with decoding and reading comprehension. Conclusions & Implications: Discrete and serial naming tasks appear to assess different aspects of lexical access, and only partial support was obtained for the double-deficit hypothesis. The findings also suggest that a reason for the correlation between the children's serial naming speed for letters/digits and their literacy could be because both are structurally similar tasks...|$|R

Elliott Chair of the Supervisory Committee: Diane L. Kendall, PhD, CCC-SLP Speech and Hearing Sciences Phonomotor {{treatment}} is a phonologically based, intensive training program associated with gains in naming trained items, untrained items (generalization) {{and improvements in}} parts of discourse {{and quality of life}} indicators. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine links between pretreatment individual factors and phonomotor treatment outcome measures in 26 persons with aphasia. Age, months post onset (MPO), severity of aphasia, severity of anomia, and severity of phonological impairment were assessed prior to treatment and compared to gains immediately and at a 3 month follow-up. Though age and MPO appear to predict immediate improvement, they do not predict maintenance of learned skills following treatment termination and therefore should not be used to inform enrollment decisions. Baseline <b>lexical</b> retrieval <b>ability</b> predicted trained and untrained real word confrontation naming 3 months following treatment termination. These results lend support for the importance of considering residual lexical-semantic abilities when enrolling participants into phonomotor treatment...|$|R
