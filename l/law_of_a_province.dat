Using a descriptive design, a survey and interviews were undertaken with students who were learning English at <b>a</b> vocational school <b>of</b> <b>law</b> at <b>a</b> <b>province</b> in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. The findings indicated how students recognized the role of the summarizing strategy although there were some problems they had to encounter while reading, namely vocabulary and grammar.

Provincial legislation which in pith and substance falls inside the perimeter of that term broadly defined is ultra vires. Parliament's legislative jurisdiction properly founded on s. 91(27) may have a destructive force on encroaching legislation from provincial legislatures, but such {{is the nature of}} the allocation procedure in ss. 91 and 92 of the Constitution. Here we are not concerned with the result in <b>law</b> <b>of</b> the exercise by Parliament of one of its exclusive heads of jurisdiction. Indeed, the converse is the question: what, if anything, is the result in <b>law</b> <b>of</b> legislation by <b>a</b> <b>province</b> where it may be classified as essentially criminal in nature? Basic principles require the conclusion that such legislation is invalid, regardless of any perceived need for its substantive provisions, and regardless of perceived defects or gaps in the federal legislative plan...|$|R
50|$|In Canadian labour law, the Rand formula (also {{referred}} to as automatic check-off) is a workplace situation where the payment of trade union dues is mandatory regardless of the worker's union status. This formula is designed {{to ensure that no}} employee will opt out of the union simply to avoid dues yet reap the benefits of collective bargaining, such as higher wages or health insurance. Supreme Court of Canada Justice Ivan Rand, the eponym <b>of</b> this <b>law,</b> introduced this formula in 1946 as an arbitration decision ending the Ford Strike of 1945 in Windsor, Ontario. The Canada Labour Code and the labour relations <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>provinces</b> contain provisions requiring the Rand formula when certain conditions are met. In those provinces where the labour relations laws do not make the Rand formula mandatory, the automatic check-off of union dues may become part of the collective bargaining agreement if both parties (i.e., the employer and the trade union) agree. If there are religious objections to paying dues the dues may be donated to a mutually agreed upon charity.|$|R
