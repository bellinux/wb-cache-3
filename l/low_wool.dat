First, {{an evaluation of}} the physical attributes of cashmere tops available to commercial spinners; second, the influence of processing variables on the efficiency of producing cashmere tops from raw Australian cashmere; and third, the influence of design of cashmere ultrafine wool blends on the fibre curvature of tops. Testing the physical attributes of cashmere tops from traditional and new sources of supply, was followed by statistical analyses based on factors of origin, processor and other determinants. The analyses demonstrated important processor effects and also that cashmere from different origins shows commercially important variations in fibre attributes. It was possible to efficiently produce Australian cashmere tops with Hauteur, tenacity, extension, softness and residual guard hairs quality attributes equivalent to those observed in the best cashmere tops. The blending of cashmere with wool resulted in a reduction of the mean fibre curvature of the blend compared with the unblended wool. The present work demonstrated that the fibre curvature properties of blended <b>low</b> crimp ultrafine <b>wool</b> tops were closer to the properties of pure cashmere tops than were tops made from blended standard high crimp ultrafine wool.

Data (37 sensorial assessments of high curvature wool fabrics; 38 sensorial assessments of <b>low</b> curvature <b>wool</b> fabrics) were analyzed using linear mixed model analysis (restricted maximum likelihood), which included fixed effects for wool type and blend ratio and a random effect for participant. The use of a control sleeve fabric reduced variance due to participant effects by providing an anchor for each sensation over time. Wool fiber curvature affected participant assessment of breathability, comfort, feel after exercise (damp/dry) and skin feel (prickly/soft), with preferred values associated with high curvature (crimp) superfine wool.

50|$|Until {{the second}} half of the 20th century when it moved {{operations}} to the Northern Hemisphere and transformed itself into a conglomerate the major portion of Dalgety's business was the Australasian wool trade pioneered by John Macarthur in New South Wales. Dalgety depended on the woolgrowers. Soon after F G Dalgety went into business on his own account Australia's sheep numbers had reached around 20 million. Thirty years later there were more than 100 million but by 1903 by prolonged drought flocks had almost halved and numbers did not come back to 100 million until 1926. By that time UK took about 50 per cent of Australia's total wool exports. UK demand rose during the Second World War but as the war ended it was found the UK government held 10.4 million bales. In conjunction with officials from Australia New Zealand and South Africa a joint arrangement was made in 1945 to ensure its orderly sale and the sale was completed in 1951. Later the same year American demand generated by the outbreak of the Korean War pulled wool prices up to nine times the UK contract price of five years earlier but the following year Australia's returns from wool were halved.Wool prices continued to fall but bottomed in 1971 when there were a record 180 million sheep, the sheep numbers to some extent compensating for <b>low</b> <b>wool</b> prices. Price stabilisation schemes were organised with Australian government support. That support was withdrawn in 1999.|$|E

40|$|Why Australian wool {{producers}} {{remained in}} the business despite the hardship they have experienced {{for much of the}} 1990 s from <b>low</b> prices of <b>wool?</b> This question was raised frequently by research scientists and policymakers of the wool industry. A recent exploratory study gives a notion that Australian wool production could be a 'lifestyle' choice and/or a choice other than economic reasons. To validate this notion this paper investigates the factors that drive and motivate the Western Australian wool producers, as identified in the exploratory study, by applying a Structural Equation Modelling approach. An innovative mixed research method is adopted in this study. Telephone survey is conducted among a random selection of 290 wool producers in WA. The results suggest that despite some expectations lifestyle factor is not significant in influencing WA wool producers to produce wool. Income, input factor and personal motivation are significant predictors of wool production by WA wool producers. Implications of the results are discussed.

40|$|The {{original}} {{copy of this}} thesis has page 166 missing, please contact the Research Archive Administrator {{if you have a}} copy of the missing page, so it can be added to the file. Wool strength is a heritable trait and varies widely between individuals even when they are maintained under equivalent conditions nutritionally. Consequently, it is valid to search for genetic markers of wool strength with the aim of using them in improving fleece quality. Wool strength is closely related to winter wool growth (Geenty et al. 1984). It is thought that the diminished follicle activity at this time reduces fibre diameter (Ross et al. 1965). This thesis investigates some of the mechanisms which may control wool growth. Such understanding will consequently aid a future search for genetic markers of wool strength. Blood plasma from eighty-six sheep was assayed for a number of metabolites and growth factors including glucose, urea, β-hydroxybutyrate, creatinine, insulin, insulin-like growth factor I, growth hormone, cortisol and melatonin. A correlation was observed between elevated plasma insulin and reduced plasma glucose and wool strength. Some changes in peripheral tissue sensitivity to insulin were also found. For example, in an indoor treatment high wool strength animals showed some peripheral tissue resistance to insulin. These data suggest that the control of and/ or mechanisms of glucose uptake vary between high and <b>low</b> <b>wool</b> strength animals. Insulin binding by the skin was investigated. No significant differences in insulin receptor binding were found between the skin of high and <b>low</b> <b>wool</b> strength animals. Although it is possible that differences could have been masked by the variable nature of the data, the evidence available from this and previous studies suggest that highly variable insulin binding between individuals by ovine tissues is a 'normal' observation. The lack of correlation between insulin receptor binding and wool strength was consequently thought to be real. Differences in tissue sensitivity to insulin were therefore hypothesised to lie with a post-receptor mechanism. The expression of glucose transporters 1 and 4 was assessed in tissues of high and <b>low</b> <b>wool</b> strength sheep using human cDNA probes. Appropriate human cDNA probes were also used to evaluate the expression of the insulin and insulin-like growth factor I receptor genes and the gene for ribosomal protein S 6. Except for the ribosomal protein S 6 gene, low to nil expression of these genes was observed in all the tissues examined when compared to the constitutively expressed B-actin gene. Expression could not be stimulated by chronic (5 hour) insulin infusion. Low expression was not thought to be due solely to a lack of homology between ovine and human sequences suggesting the expression of genes involved in glucose uptake is extremely low in sheep. The glucose transporter 1 gene was expressed at low levels in skin, wool follicles and brain tissue but not in muscle and fat tissue. This suggests that skin, like brain tissue, has an absolute requirement for glucose, a situation not found in adipose and muscle tissue. Glucose transporter I is generally reported to be associated with non-insulin dependent glucose uptake. From this it was concluded that elucidation of the mechanisms by which glucose is taken up into different tissues provides the key to understanding the controlling factors by which glucose is partitioned to the wool follicle. Such a mechanism could be influenced by insulin either directly by its action on the wool follicle, or indirectly, by causing insulin resistance in muscle and adipose tissues which partitions glucose to the skin where it is taken up in an insulin-independent manner...|$|E

This paper describes an analysis comparing a traditional fine-wool growing enterprise ("Wool") with one focused on wool and meat production ("Wool/Meat") in south-west Victoria. The two systems were modelled using {{the computer program}} MIDAS, and profitability was calculated {{for a range of}} commodity prices and production levels. The standard production levels for the "Wool" and "Wool/Meat" sheep genotypes was assumed to be 3. 2 and 4. 0 kg clean fleece weight, 19. 6 and 21. 0 μm, and 75 % and 110 % weaning rate, respectively. With these production levels, the "Wool/Meat" genotype was more profitable than "Wool" over a broad range of wool and meat prices.

Since the collapse of the wool reserve price scheme in 1991, wool prices declined and income on wool producing farms followed suit. R & D during this period has also declined from 5 - 4 % agricultural GDP in 1986 to only 3 % in 2005 and has favoured research related to cropping rather than that related to pastures and livestock. How then do we convince students that mixed-farming enterprises provide the sustainable future of farming? This paper provides a background to farming practises over the last 20 years, along with the economic, environmental and social basis for the decisions that have been made. In view of a changing climate, peak oil, food security issues and changing trends for global food consumption, it will then set the scene and discuss why pastures and livestock should be an integral component of future farming systems. Finally, it will discuss how we can change a whole generation of future farmers and researchers to see the value of livestock and pastures in their farming landscapes.

50|$|What makes wool {{a unique}} product {{is that it}} is {{essentially}} flame resistant. The combination of sulfur and nitrogen provides a blend of materials that provide a flame-resistant product. The reason wool is used for many types of heat protection is that it has a low ignition temperature. This is defined as the temperature in which an item will produce a flame. Wool can be heated to over 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit before the igniting of this fabric. Even when the fabric comes in contact with flames it does not disseminate the flame. This provides an even greater protective quality with the <b>wool’s</b> <b>low</b> ignition temperature and the inability for flames to spread throughout the fiber. When wool is heated to a certain degree, it begins to “char” on the outside. This can provide a protective outer layer on the outside fabric. When the char {{on the outside of the}} fabric is consistent with the original properties of the wool, it can produce a safer version of the product. When the heat is directly applied to the fabric, the “char” forms a semi-liquid state which can be wiped off the fabric providing no evidence of the heat contact.|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} for adopting a genetic solution to protect sheep from blowfly strike on the breech {{was investigated in}} a flock of sheep that contained several animals expressing a trait characterised by <b>low</b> <b>wool</b> coverage over the breech and through a wide channel from the anus to the udder or scrotum. A scoring system (1, bare to 5, woolly) was developed and {{used to determine the}} heritability of the trait and its phenotypic and genetic correlations with other traits of importance in a sheep enterprise. In comparison to animals with woolly breeches, the skin in the breech of animals with a low bareness score was characterised by a low density of follicles producing short, medullated fibres, with histological evidence of immune rejection and follicular atrophy. The bareness score of progeny was influenced by the score of their respective sires suggesting a strong genetic component. The heritability of bareness score was moderate to high (h 2 = 0. 45 ± 0. 02, 0. 53 ± 0. 01 and 0. 38 ± 0. 02 at lamb, hogget and adult ages, respectively). The lactation status and age of ewes influenced their bareness score, resulting in a low repeatability (0. 42) of the trait between ages in females. Genetic correlations between bareness score and most other economically important traits were low. The weight of belly wool and the weight of skirtings was genetically related to bareness score (rg = + 0. 52 and + 0. 48 respectively), indicating that animals with barer breeches tend genetically towards lighter belly wool weights and lower weight of skirtings at wool classing. Selection and breeding for bareness score should achieve relatively rapid progress towards fixing the trait in a flock and without adverse effects on other important traits. Caution should be exercised in extrapolating these results to other bloodlines and environments where genetic mechanisms or environmental influences may be different. N. M. Edwards, M. Hebart and P.

It was observed that besides the <b>low</b> <b>wool</b> production, the utilization of this kind of wool is restricted by its low quality...|$|E
40|$|The {{constituent}} {{elements of}} effective management {{in coping with}} the variability of the climatic and economic environment in agriculture are largely unknown. In order to define these elements, a procedure which incorporated {{an assessment of the}} influence of environmental and resource levels and inputs, and the personal characteristics of the manager, on management performance, was utilized. A comparative economic analysis between properties, within zones of similar vegetation and soil characteristics in South West Queensland, was undertaken. This involved comparison of individual properties within each year, and changes between consecutive years. Definition of groups of properties with common changes in financial performance between years was also obtained for the Soft Mulga Zone, which had contrasting changes of performance between individual properties and between consecutive years. A review of past research into the influence of a manager's personal characteristics on managerial performance revealed that understanding and predictability of the characteristics' influence was low and unreliable. This was considered to be due to having not used theories of total human behaviour in those studies. Each manager's definition of management of a property, in his own terms, was determined using a Repertory Grid technique derived from Kelly's Theory of Personal Constructs. An understanding of management strategies and success, learning about management, coping with the environment and reacting to one's own managerial performance, was obtained using the Repertory Grid Test. The study showed that environmental and resource levels have a. considerable influence on managerial performance in any one year and on changes in performance between years. Certain strategies of livestock number manipulation were more effective than others in ensuring adequate financial performance, in situations of drought and <b>low</b> <b>wool</b> prices. Each manager was essentially individualstic in how he saw his property and how he saw and valued his management. Whether he effectively coped with changes in his biological and economic 'environment depended on how he construed those changes, his experience with those changes in the past, and how he reacted to the results of his management efforts. The economic and psychological assessments allowed a definition of managerial ability to be determined. They also allowed the development of an in-the-field Repertory Grid technique to assist in determining a manager's constructs about management. The field method would have value in ensuring that the helping agencies for primary producers were more relevant in their activities.

50|$|In most oriental rugs, {{the pile}} is of sheep's wool. Its {{characteristics}} and quality vary from each {{area to the}} next, depending on the breed of sheep, climatic conditions, pasturage, and the particular customs relating to when and how the wool is shorn and processed. In the Middle East, rug wools come mainly from the fat-tailed and fat-rumped sheep races, which are distinguished, as their names suggest, by the accumulation of fat in the respective parts of their bodies. Different areas of a sheep's fleece yield different qualities of wool, depending on the ratio between the thicker and stiffer sheep hair and the finer fibers of the wool. Usually, sheep are shorn in spring and fall. The spring shear produces wool of finer quality. The <b>lowest</b> grade of <b>wool</b> used in carpet weaving is “skin” wool, which is removed chemically from dead animal skin. Fibers from camels and goats are also used. Goat hair is mainly used for fastening the borders, or selvages, of Baluchi and Turkmen rugs, since it is more resistant to abrasion. Camel wool is occasionally used in Middle Eastern rugs. It is often dyed in black, or used in its natural colour. More often, wool said to be camel's wool {{turns out to be}} dyed sheep wool.|$|R

Higher grades of Persian wool are {{often referred to as}} kurk, or kork wool, which is gained from the wool growing on the sheep's neck. Modern production also makes use of imported wool, e.g. Merino wool from New Zealand, because the high demand on carpet wool cannot be entirely met by the local production. Fibers from camels and goats are also used. Goat hair is mainly used for fastening the borders, or selvedges, of nomadic rugs like Baluch rugs, since it is more resistant to abrasion. Camel wool is occasionally used in Persian nomadic rugs. It is often dyed in black, or used in its natural colour. More often, wool said to be camel's wool turns out to be dyed sheep wool.|$|R
40|$|This {{project was}} part of a larger CSIRO {{experiment}} which was examining the factors involved in the development of tender wool. In order to understand the effect of nutritional variations on wool quality, changes in cellular activity and morphology within the wool follicle were examined. Six sheep with a history of producing <b>low</b> staple strength <b>wool</b> (3 ̆c 25 N/ktex) and six sheep with a history of producing high staple strength wool (3 ̆e 30 N/ktex) were selected. The experiment ran for 18 weeks, for the first 10 weeks the sheep were fed a restricted ration to achieve a weight loss of approximately 175 g/day. From weeks 11 to 18, the sheep were fed an iso-energetic ration containing low or high protein. The sheep were weighed weekly and colchicine treated skin biopsies were collected at 0, 2, 10, 11, 12 and 18 weeks, embedded in paraffin and serial sectioned. The work carried out for this Honours project involved assessing wool follicles from these sheep to determine the stage of the growth cycle, the mitotic rate and the area of the follicle bulb. Although group differences were not evident between the different diets and staple strengths, this study demonstrated a high correlation between the number of mitotically active cells in the follicular bulb, the area of the follicular bulb, live-weight of the sheep, clean wool weight and fibre diameter (r = 84. 5...|$|R
