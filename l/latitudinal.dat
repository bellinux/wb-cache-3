5|$|Because Neptune {{is not a}} solid body, its {{atmosphere}} undergoes differential rotation. The wide {{equatorial zone}} rotates with {{a period of about}} 18hours, which is slower than the 16.1-hour rotation of the planet's magnetic field. By contrast, the reverse is true for the polar regions where the rotation period is 12hours. This differential rotation is the most pronounced of any planet in the Solar System, and it results in strong <b>latitudinal</b> wind shear.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its vast}} size {{and range of}} altitudes, Argentina {{possesses}} {{a wide variety of}} climatic regions, ranging from the hot subtropical region in the north to the cold subantarctic in the far south. Lying between those is the Pampas region, featuring a mild and humid climate. Many regions have different, often contrasting, microclimates. In general, Argentina has four main climate types: warm, moderate, arid, and cold in which the relief features, and the <b>latitudinal</b> extent of the country, determine the different varieties within the main climate types.|$|E
5|$|The {{biology of}} life {{operates}} {{within a certain}} range of temperatures. Heat {{is a form of}} energy that regulates temperature. Heat affects growth rates, activity, behaviour, and primary production. Temperature is largely dependent on the incidence of solar radiation. The <b>latitudinal</b> and longitudinal spatial variation of temperature greatly affects climates and consequently the distribution of biodiversity and levels of primary production in different ecosystems or biomes across the planet. Heat and temperature relate importantly to metabolic activity. Poikilotherms, for example, have a body temperature that is largely regulated and dependent on the temperature of the external environment. In contrast, homeotherms regulate their internal body temperature by expending metabolic energy.|$|E
5|$|The {{climate of}} a region depends {{on a number of}} factors, {{especially}} latitude. A <b>latitudinal</b> band of the surface with similar climatic attributes forms a climate region. There are a number of such regions, ranging from the tropical climate at the equator to the polar climate in the northern and southern extremes. Weather is also influenced by the seasons, which result from the Earth's axis being tilted relative to its orbital plane. Thus, at any given time during the summer or winter, one part of the Earth is more directly exposed to the rays of the sun. This exposure alternates as the Earth revolves in its orbit. At any given time, regardless of season, the northern and southern hemispheres experience opposite seasons.|$|E
5|$|The {{current flowing}} from the {{ionosphere}} to the plasma sheet is especially strong when the corresponding part of the plasma sheet rotates slower than the planet. As mentioned above, co-rotation breaks down in the region located between 20 and 40RJ from Jupiter. This region corresponds to the magnetodisk, where the magnetic field is highly stretched. The strong direct current flowing into the magnetodisk originates in a very limited <b>latitudinal</b> range of about ° from the Jovian magnetic poles. These narrow circular regions correspond to Jupiter's main auroral ovals. (See below.) The return current {{flowing from the}} outer magnetosphere beyond 50RJ enters the Jovian ionosphere near the poles, closing the electrical circuit. The total radial current in the Jovian magnetosphere is estimated at 60 million–140million amperes.|$|E
5|$|The vast size, {{and wide}} range of altitudes, {{contribute}} to Argentina's diverse climate. Consequently, {{there is a wide}} variety of biomes in the country, including subtropical rain forests, semi-arid and arid regions, temperate plains in the Pampas, and cold subantarctic in the south. In general, Argentina has four main climate types: warm, moderate, arid, and cold in which the relief features, and the <b>latitudinal</b> extent of the country, determine the different varieties in the main climate types. Despite the diversity of biomes, about two-thirds of Argentina is arid or semi-arid. Argentina is best divided into six distinct regions reflecting the climatic conditions of the country as a whole. From north to south, these regions are Northwest, Chaco, Northeast, Cuyo/Monte, Pampas, and Patagonia. Each climatic region has distinctive types of vegetation.|$|E
5|$|While {{there are}} {{resident}} {{populations of the}} yellow-faced honeyeater throughout its range, {{it is for the}} most part a seasonal, <b>latitudinal,</b> daytime migrant. During the autumn (March to May) it migrates north along the highlands and coastal fringe of eastern Australia to southern Queensland, to return in the spring (August to October) of the same year. The birds commonly move in flocks of 10 to 100 birds, but occasionally in larger groups of up to 1,000 or more birds. The groups can include other species such as the white-naped honeyeater, fuscous honeyeater, noisy friarbird and silvereye. They move in successive flocks at a rate of up to several thousand birds an hour. Over 100,000 birds were recorded passing Hastings point in New South Wales {{over the course of a}} single day in May 1965. The species is able to detect geomagnetic fields and uses them to navigate while migrating. Experiments where the vertical component of the magnetic field was reversed indicate that the magnetic compass of the yellow-faced honeyeater is based on the inclination of the field lines and not on polarity, meaning they distinguish between the direction of the equator and poles, rather than north and south. While their flight is in one general direction, it is not in a straight line as the flocks stay in vegetated areas, negotiate gaps in the mountain ranges and detour around cities.|$|E

25|$|The {{distribution}} of the ichneumonids was traditionally considered {{an exception to the}} common <b>latitudinal</b> gradient in species diversity, since the family was thought to be at its most species rich in the temperate zone instead of the tropics, but numerous new tropical species have now been discovered.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the large}} <b>latitudinal</b> range {{of the country and}} the varied {{topography}} and climate, Norway has a larger number of different habitats than almost any other European country. There are approximately 60,000 species in Norway and adjacent waters (excluding bacteria and virus). The Norwegian Shelf large marine ecosystem is considered highly productive.|$|E
25|$|The {{distribution}} of ichneumonid species richness {{is subject to}} ongoing debate. Long believed to be rare in the tropics, and at its most species rich in the temperate region, the family became a classic textbook example of an 'exceptional' <b>latitudinal</b> diversity gradient. Recently this belief has been questioned, after the discovery of numerous new tropical species.|$|E

Its two main subclades (J1-M267 and J2-M172), show opposite <b>latitudinal</b> gradients in the Middle East. J1-M267 is more abundant in the southern areas, reaching a frequency around 73% in Yemen, whereas J2-M172 {{is more common in}} the Levant.|$|E

25|$|The {{geography}} and subtropical <b>latitudinal</b> location of Punjab lead to large {{variations in temperature}} from month to month.

25|$|Together with NY52, {{which it}} closely {{parallels}} and briefly joins in downtown Liberty, it forms the <b>latitudinal</b> {{backbone of the}} Hudson Valley region for non-interstate traffic. It offers the traveler {{a wide variety of}} landscapes, from farmlands, mountains and forests to the urban center of Poughkeepsie. Sights along the way include two of New York City's major reservoirs in the Catskills, a dramatic crossing of the Shawangunk Ridge, and the Mid-Hudson Bridge.|$|E
25|$|Temporal {{variation}} {{in the structure of}} euglossine bee communities reveal the relative contributions of varying ecological processes to the shaping of insect communities which include resource competition and habitat filtering. Specifically, phylogenetic diversity changes across <b>latitudinal</b> gradients, in which the more seasonal climates have decreased phylogenetic diversity. It has therefore been theorized that the same ecological processes that drive phylogenetic diversity geographically, also shape communities at the temporal level within a given community.|$|E
25|$|Project Loon is Google's pursuit {{to deploy}} a high-altitude balloon network {{operating}} in the stratosphere, at altitudes between 18km and 25km. Google asserts that this particular layer of the stratosphere is advantageous because of its relatively low wind speeds (e.g., wind speeds between 5 and 20mph / 10 to 30 km/h) and minimal turbulence. Moreover, Google claims that it can model, with reasonable accuracy, the seasonal, longitudinal, and <b>latitudinal</b> variations in wind speeds within the 18–25km stratospheric layer.|$|E
25|$|Under warming conditions, the {{increasing}} {{depth of the}} summer active layer has significant impacts on the hydrologic and geomorphic regimes. Thawing and retreat of permafrost {{have been reported in}} the upper Mackenzie Valley and along the southern margin of its occurrence in Manitoba, but such observations are not readily quantified and generalized. Based on average <b>latitudinal</b> gradients of air temperature, an average northward displacement of the southern permafrost boundary by 50-to-150nbsp&km could be expected, under equilibrium conditions, for a 1nbsp&°C warming.|$|E
25|$|Given a {{reasonably}} accurate model of wind speeds within the 18–25km band, Google {{claims that it}} can control the <b>latitudinal</b> and longitudinal position of high-altitude balloons by adjusting only the balloon's altitude. By adjusting the volume and density of the gas (e.g., helium, hydrogen, or another lighter-than-air compound) in the balloon, the balloon's variable buoyancy system is {{able to control the}} balloon's altitude. Google has additionally indicated that balloons may be constructed from various materials (e.g., metalized Mylar or BoPET) or a highly flexible latex or rubber material (e.g., chloroprene).|$|E
25|$|The {{fossil record}} {{suggests}} that the population history of Xerocrassa geyeri is linked to palaeoclimate changes. The <b>latitudinal</b> shifts of suitable habitat during Pleistocene across Europe, driven by climate change, were anticipated by Xerocrassa geyeri in the fossil record with remarkably short time lags. In other words, the species can be detected in the fossil record very soon after the onset of a suitable climate phase. Research by Pfenninger et al. (2003) suggested that {{the origin of the}} species is in the Provence from where it expanded its range first to Southwest France and subsequently from there to Germany.|$|E
25|$|Certainly, {{the central}} Arctic Ocean was {{ice-free}} before, during, {{and after the}} PETM. This can be ascertained from the composition of sediment cores recovered during the Arctic Coring Expedition (ACEX) at 87°N on Lomonosov Ridge. Moreover, temperatures increased during the PETM, {{as indicated by the}} brief presence of subtropical dinoflagellates, and a marked increase in TEX86. The latter record is intriguing, though, because it suggests a 6°C (11°F) rise from ~ before the PETM to ~ during the PETM. Assuming the TEX86 record reflects summer temperatures, it still implies much warmer temperatures on the North Pole compared to the present day, but no significant <b>latitudinal</b> amplification relative to surrounding time.|$|E
25|$|The real Earth–ionosphere {{waveguide}} is not {{a perfect}} electromagnetic resonant cavity. Losses due to finite ionosphere electrical conductivity lower the propagation speed of electromagnetic signals in the cavity, resulting in a resonance frequency that is lower than would be expected in an ideal case, and the observed peaks are wide. In addition, {{there are a number}} of horizontal asymmetries – day-night difference in the height of the ionosphere, <b>latitudinal</b> changes in the Earth's magnetic field, sudden ionospheric disturbances, polar cap absorption, variation in the Earth radius of ± 11km from equator to geographic poles, etc. that produce other effects in the Schumann resonance power spectra.|$|E
25|$|Temperatures in Australia have {{followed}} an increasing trend between {{the years of}} 1910 to 2004 by approximately 0.7°C. Overnight minimum temperatures have warmed more rapidly than daytime maximum temperatures. The observed warming has hastened in recent years. The late-20th century warming has been largely attributed to the increased greenhouse effect. Temperature differences between winter and summer are minor in the tropical region of Australia. However, they are greatest in the southern inland, with seasonal differences along the coast being moderated by the ocean’s proximity. In July, a more common <b>latitudinal</b> distribution of average maximums is apparent, ranging from 30°C near the north coast to below 3°C in the mountainous areas of the south-east.|$|E
25|$|Species {{diversity}} of the extant cycads peaks at 17˚ 15"N and 28˚ 12"S, with a minor peak at the equator. There is therefore not a <b>latitudinal</b> diversity gradient towards the equator but towards the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. However, the peak near the northern tropic {{is largely due to}} Cycas in Asia and Zamia in the New World, whereas the peak near the southern tropic is due to Cycas again, and also to the diverse genus Encephalartos in southern and central Africa, and Macrozamia in Australia. Thus, the distribution pattern of cycad species with latitude appears to be an artifact of the geographical isolation of the remaining cycad genera and their species, and perhaps because they are partly xerophytic rather than simply tropical.|$|E
25|$|In Jared Diamond's {{groundbreaking}} Guns, Germs, and Steel, he {{lays out}} the basic arguments for Environmental determinism - that environments and geography determine the political institutions of a certain region. Starting from the same attempt to explain why Eurasian civilizations have outlived other civilizations that used {{to exist in the}} world, Diamond looks at the geographical differences among different civilizations and the agricultural practices that have arisen from those differences. For example, because of the <b>latitudinal</b> differences between the Eurasian continent and American/African continents—the Eurasian continent has a large longitudinal span while the American/African continents are longitudinally narrow—it is easier for inhabitants of the Eurasian continent to spread the same kind of agricultural products and domesticated animals like wheat, cows and horses. On the other hand, for African and American continents, because of the wide <b>latitudinal</b> differences of different regions, it is hard for the same kind of agricultural products and domesticated animals to spread. Because of this difference, people on Eurasian continent are more likely to develop stronger immune systems and thus their civilizations are more likely to survive. However, according to Acemoglu and Robinson, the theory is incapable of explaining the {{gap between rich and poor}} countries after 1500. It is also powerless in explaining the difference of economic growth between two places with similar or same geographic conditions, like Nogales, Sonora and Nogales, Arizona, North Korea and South Korea and East Germany and West Germany. In comparison, according to the book, geographical factors do not have as strong an explanatory power as institutional factors. Especially in the modern age when advanced technology is widely available, the reason why Equatorial Guinea or Sierra Leone still suffer from diseases like Malaria is not because of the weather, but because of the poor institutions underlying those states.|$|E
25|$|During seed based {{restoration}} projects, it {{is generally}} recommended to source from local populations, to minimize the effects of maladaptation. One of the many challenges of restoration is that every species is different and requires different sourcing guidelines. Rather than putting strict distance recommendations, other guidelines recommend sourcing seeds to match similar environmental conditions. For example, sourcing for Castilleja levisecta found that farther source populations that matched similar environmental variables were better suited for the restoration project than closer source populations. Restoration guidelines vary drastically between states and agency. For example, Minnesota is broken up into 9 seed sourcing zones, where its neighbor Iowa, is broken into three <b>latitudinal</b> zones. US Forest Service recently developed provisional seed zones based {{on a combination of}} minimum winter temperature zones, aridity, and the Level III ecoregions.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{correlation}} between the geographic distribution of UV radiation (UVR) {{and the distribution of}} skin pigmentation around the world. Areas that have higher amounts of UVR have darker-skinned populations, generally located nearer the equator. Areas that are further away from the equator generally closer to the poles have a lower concentration of UVR, and contain lighter-skinned populations. This is the result of human evolution which contributed to variable melanin content in the skin to adapt to certain environments. A larger percentage of dark skinned people are found in the Southern Hemisphere because <b>latitudinal</b> land mass distribution is disproportionate. The present distribution of skin colour variation does not completely reflect the correlation of intense UVR and dark skin pigmentation due to mass migration and movement of peoples across continents in the recent past.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the lunar}} orbit is also {{inclined}} to Earth's ecliptic plane by 5.1°, the rotational {{axis of the}} Moon seems to rotate {{towards and away from}} Earth during one complete orbit. This is referred to as <b>latitudinal</b> libration, which allows one to see almost 7° of latitude beyond the pole on the far side. Finally, because the Moon is only about 60 Earth radii away from Earth's centre of mass, an observer at the equator who observes the Moon throughout the night moves laterally by one Earth diameter. This gives rise to a diurnal libration, which allows one to view an additional one degree's worth of lunar longitude. For the same reason, observers at both of Earth's geographical poles would be able to see one additional degree's worth of libration in latitude.|$|E
25|$|Other {{important}} astronomers from India include Madhava of Sangamagrama, Nilakantha Somayaji and Jyeshtadeva, {{who were}} members of the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics from the 14th century to the 16th century. Nilakantha Somayaji, in his Aryabhatiyabhasya, a commentary on Aryabhata's Aryabhatiya, developed his own computational system for a partially heliocentric planetary model, in which Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn orbit the Sun, which in turn orbits the Earth, similar to the Tychonic system later proposed by Tycho Brahe in the late 16th century. Nilakantha's system, however, was mathematically more efficient than the Tychonic system, due to correctly taking into account the equation of the centre and <b>latitudinal</b> motion of Mercury and Venus. Most astronomers of the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics who followed him accepted his planetary model.|$|E
25|$|Fossil {{evidence}} suggests that current populations of Xerocrassa geyeri are relicts of a much more widespread distribution during more favourable climatic periods in the Pleistocene era. Xerocrassa geyeri fossils are relatively abundant and Xerocrassa geyeri was one of main land snails in the western and southern Europe in glacial periods. In loess deposits, the presence of Xerocrassa geyeri shells has been reported since the early Pleistocene. The subfossilised shell deposits in southern England and large parts of France are correlated with the widespread occurrence of rather arid cold steppe vegetation formations. These formations are associated with transitional phases of Pleistocene climate cycles, covering parts of Europe even during maximal glacial expansion thus providing the potential for local refugia. Both Pleistocene interstadial and pleniglacial periods resulted in altitudinal and <b>latitudinal</b> shiftings of these formations, {{as well as in}} reductions in their extent.|$|E
25|$|Some studies {{indicate}} that ectomycorrhizal fungi might {{be at odds with}} the general <b>latitudinal</b> gradient of diversity (LGD). Data sets, free from inconclusive fruit-body surveys and largely relying on more accurate sequencing and microarray technologies, indicate that EcM fungi may be at enhanced diversity in the temperate zone. This implies that many of the causal mechanisms proposed to explain the LGD pattern might be inapplicable, or in need of modification, in reference to EcM. Though this relationship is far from certain, there exist some hypotheses to explain the plausibility of this phenomenon: 1) EcM fungi may have evolved at higher latitudes with Pinaceae hosts, and are subsequently inferior at competition in tropical climates, 2) host lineages might be more diverse in temperate conditions, and well developed soil and soil horizons in temperate regions allow for higher niche differentiation and species accumulation, and 3) tropical EcM hosts are more sparsely distributed, yielding small isolated forest islands that may reduce the population sizes and subsequent richness of EcM fungi.|$|E
25|$|Experimental warming {{has been}} shown to start {{flowering}} substantially earlier than control cushions experiencing ambient temperature. Both the male and female phases developed faster in the OTCs and capsules (fruits) matured earlier, and the cushions produced more mature seeds and had a higher seed/ovule ratio contributing to an overall positive reproductive response. However, a study on four populations across a <b>latitudinal</b> gradient in North America showed that southern populations of moss campion had lower survival and recruitment, but higher individual growth rates than more northern populations. Furthermore, vital rates such as growth, survival, and fruits per area were shown to increase in moderately warmer years yet declined in the very warmest years, suggesting that a change in climate into warmer conditions or more frequent unusually warm summers may eventually lead to negative impacts. Another study showed that while the short term responses were positive, they turned negative on medium-term, suggestion that moss campion may be at risk in future global warming.|$|E
25|$|In a 1998 study, tritium {{concentrations}} in surface seawater and atmospheric water vapor (10meters above the surface) were sampled {{at the following}} locations: the Sulu Sea, the Fremantle Bay, the Bay of Bengal, the Penang Bay, and the Strait of Malacca. Results indicated that the tritium concentration in surface seawater was highest at the Fremantle Bay (approximately 0.40Bq/liter), which could be accredited to the mixing of runoff of freshwater from nearby lands due to large amounts found in coastal waters. Typically, lower concentrations were found between 35 and 45 degrees south latitude and near the equator. Results also indicated that (in general) tritium has decreased over the years (up to 1997) due to the physical decay of bomb tritium in the Indian Ocean. As for water vapor, the tritium concentration was approximately one order of magnitude greater than surface seawater concentrations (ranging from 0.46 to 1.15Bq/liter). Therefore, the water vapor tritium is not affected by the surface seawater concentration; thus, the high tritium {{concentrations in}} the vapor were concluded to be {{a direct consequence of}} the downward movement of natural tritium from the stratosphere to the troposphere (therefore, the ocean air showed a dependence on <b>latitudinal</b> change).|$|E

In the north-south direction the eastern taiga is divided (east of the Yenisei River), with a continental climate, and west, with a milder climate, in general, the climate zone is moist, moderately warm (cool in the north) in the summer and harsh winter, there is a steady snow cover in the winter. In the <b>latitudinal</b> direction the taiga is divided into three subzones - northern, middle and southern taiga. In the western taiga dense spruce and fir forests on wetlands alternate with pine forests, shrubs and meadows on the lighter soils. Such vegetation is typical of the eastern taiga, but it plays an important role not fir and larch. Coniferous forest, however, does not form a continuous array and sparse areas of birch, alder, willow (mainly in river valleys), the wetlands - marshes. Within the taiga are widespread fur-bearing animals - sable, marten, ermine, moose, brown bear, wolverine, wolf, and muskrat.|$|E
