5|$|At {{the end of}} the English Civil War Lady Drake {{was joined}} at her Devon home, Ash House in the parish of Musbury, by her fourth {{daughter}} Elizabeth Drake and her husband Winston Churchill (1620–1688), a Royalist cavalry captain. Unlike his mother-in-law who had supported the Parliamentary cause, Winston had the misfortune of fighting on the losing side of the war – for which he, <b>like</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> Cavaliers, was forced to compound; in his case £446 18s. Although Winston had paid off the fine by 1651, it had impoverished him. From this episode may derive the Churchill family motto: Fiel Pero Desdichado ("Faithful but Unfortunate").|$|E

For example, scholars had assumed that Veturius Macrinus mentioned in the Life of Didius Julianus was an invention of the author, <b>like</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> names. However, an inscription was uncovered which confirmed his existence and his post as Praetorian Prefect in 193.

5|$|Throughout {{the early}} 1970s plans {{continued}} to emerge for the redevelopment of the Albert Dock {{site and the}} whole of the south docks system in general. Many of these plans were quite extreme including Liverpool City Council's suggestion to use the dock basin as a landfill site. The Mersey Docks and Harbour Company (MDHC), the reincarnation of the now defunct Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, however felt it could get more money by filling in the dock basin with sand and selling it as developable land and not derelict land. One plan for the Albert Dock that was taken more seriously was the idea that it become the new home of Liverpool Polytechnic (now John Moores University). The government was even willing to provide £3m in funding but <b>like</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> plans this too fell by the wayside.|$|E

500|$|In {{collaboration}} with Engels, Marx also set about {{writing a book}} which is often seen as his best treatment {{of the concept of}} historical materialism, The German Ideology. In this work, Marx broke with Ludwig Feuerbach, Bruno Bauer, Max Stirner {{and the rest of the}} Young Hegelians, while he also broke with Karl Grun and other [...] "true socialists" [...] whose philosophies were still based in part on [...] "idealism". In German Ideology, Marx and Engels finally completed their philosophy, which was based solely on materialism as the sole motor force in history. German Ideology is written in a humorously satirical form, but even this satirical form did not save the work from censorship. <b>Like</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> early writings of his, German Ideology would not be published in Marx's lifetime and would be published only in 1932.|$|E

[...] Homologies of the flowers of orchids showed them all to be based on [...] "fifteen groups of vessels, arranged three within three, in alternating order". He disparaged the idea that this was an [...] "ideal type" [...] fixed by the Omnipotent Creator, but attributed it instead to its [...] "descent from some monocotyledonous plant, which, <b>like</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> plants of the same division, possessed fifteen organs, arranged alternately three within three in five whorls; and that the now wonderfully changed structure of the flower is due to a long course of slow modification,—each modification having been preserved which was useful to each plant, during the incessant changes to which the organic and the inorganic world has been exposed".|$|E
500|$|<b>Like</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> {{aspects of}} its biology, the vocalisations of the huia {{are not well}} known, and present {{knowledge}} is based on very few accounts. The calls were mostly a varied array of whistles, [...] "peculiar and strange", but also [...] "soft, melodious and flute-like". An imitation of the bird's call survives as a recording of 1909 huia search team member Henare Hamana whistling the call (see External links). Huia were often silent. When they did vocalise, their calls could carry considerable distances – some were audible from up to [...] away through dense forest. The calls were said to differ between sexes, though there are no details. Calls were given with the bird's head and neck stretched outward and its bill pointing 30 to 45 degrees from the vertical. Most references describe huia calls as heard in the early morning; one records it as the first bird to sing in the dawn chorus, and captive birds were known to [...] "wake the household". Like the whitehead, huia behaved unusually {{before the onset of}} wet weather, being [...] "happy and in full song". The bird's name is onomatopoeic: it was named by Māori for its loud distress call, a smooth, unslurred whistle rendered as uia, uia, uia or where are you?. This call was said to be given when the bird was excited or hungry. Chicks had a [...] "plaintive cry, pleasant to the ear", would feebly answer imitations by people, and were very noisy when kept in tents.|$|E

[...] Walker, among other reporters and some casual gamers, have questioned the reasons for his popularity, while other reporters have criticised his rise in notability. Walker commented on PewDiePie's interaction with his audience, writing, [...] "While he can be raucous and crude, it always comes across as genuine. He constantly addresses his audience as a bunch of peer-like friends, as opposed to distant, genuflecting fans. He's certainly {{more than willing to}} make fun of himself in the process." [...] In 2015, The Verge wrote, [...] "Love it or hate it, his success — <b>like</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> YouTube personalities — isn't just in playing games but actually connecting and talking directly to an audience. No agent, press release, or any other intermediary. He just hit record." [...] He refers to his fan base as the [...] "Bro Army" [...] and addresses his audience as [...] "bros". On this, Walker wrote, [...] "Profanity aside, it's a bummer that his persona includes constant references to his viewers as [...] "bros," [...] and that he's loose with words like [...] "bitch" [...] when his gaming adventures lead him into contact with female villain characters. Given how smart this guy clearly is when he speaks directly, I suspect he could modify his demeanor in a way that remained engaging to a young fan base but somehow contributed to improving gamer-land’s sometimes disturbingly bro-centric attitude." [...] However, both Walker and Reed have commented on PewDiePie's intelligence, with Reed opining, [...] "He's much more thoughtful and self-aware than he seems in many of his videos." ...|$|E
