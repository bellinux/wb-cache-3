5|$|Beyonce has crafted her brand around {{embracing}} femininity {{and female}} sexuality. Although as Dr. Cheryl Thompson explains {{in her article}} “The sweet taste of lemonade: Beyonce serves up black feminist history most recent album,” Beyonce is only recently exploring the intersecting themes of feminism and black empowerment in her work. According to Thompson, Beyonce - like many other black female artists - has held back with her identity as a black woman {{for the sake of}} appealing to the masses. Like the SNL skit that pokes fun at white Beyonce fans that listened to “Lemonade” and realized {{for the first time that}} Beyonce is indeed a black woman, it is only very recently that the artist has transformed her feminist image into something more specific to the issues black women face. As Thompson explains, all of Beyonce’s previous albums were about feminism. “Lemonade” is about black feminism. The importance of having artistry like “Lemonade” in the mainstream is critical to examining the <b>lived</b> <b>experiences</b> of black women, and the racial and gender-based oppression that intersect to create a unique set of obstacles.|$|E

It is governed exclusively neither by causality, nor by intentionality. In this space of in-betweenness phenomenology can overcome its inaugural opposition to naturalism.|$|E

40|$|Recovery is {{government}} mandated and a core facet {{of mental health}} reform. However, Recovery implementation in this country (Australia) has been inhibited {{by a lack of}} education of, and understanding from, clinicians. A grounded theory study was undertaken to explore the potential and existing role of <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> practitioners in assisting meaningful implementations of Recovery within the Australian mental health sector. In-depth interviews were conducted with 13 people employed to work from a <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> perspective. The findings suggest participants have experienced and observed significant barriers to the implementation of Recovery-focused practice while operating in <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> roles. Three main issues emerged: (1) Recovery co-opted, (2) Recovery uptake, and (3) Recovery denial. For a genuine Recovery-focused mental health system to be developed, <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> practitioners must be enabled to take their role as Recovery experts and leaders. <b>Lived</b> <b>experience</b> practitioners are the logical leaders of Recovery implementation due to their own internal experience and understandings of Recovery and the wider <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> movement&# 039;s development and championing of the concepts...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the {{phenomenon}} of feeling unsure as viewed from the humanbecoming school of thought. From the humanbecoming perspective feeling unsure is a universal <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> of health and quality of life. The purposes of this study were to understand the <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> of feeling unsure from the humanbecoming perspective, to enhance understanding of the <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> of feeling unsure as an essence of health and quality of life, to discover the structure of the <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> of feeling unsure, to add to the body of knowledge on the phenomenon of feeling unsure, and to contribute to expand the theory of humanbecoming. The Parse research methodology was used to guide this study and answer the question: Whqt is the structure of the <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> of feeling unsure? Ten persons living in community accepted to participate in this study. The processes of dialogical engagement, extraction-synthesis, and heuristic interpretation were used for data gathering and analysis. The central finding of this study is Feeling unsure is wavering irresolutely with discerning ponderings arising in venturing with trepidations, while revering alliances. The findings of this study emerged as new knowledge that extend the theory of humanbecoming and enhance the understanding of the <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> of feeling unsure...|$|R
25|$|The {{impact of}} Schleiermacher's work on hermeneutics is significant. The claim of Schleiermacher {{as the father}} of hermeneutics seems to be {{justified}} by the fact that his work marks the beginning of hermeneutics as a general field of inquiry, separate from the specific disciplines (e.g. law or theology). His focus on hermeneutics as a theory of interpretation for any textual expression would be expanded even further to the theory of interpretation of <b>lived</b> <b>experiences</b> in the twentieth century by those like Heidegger, Gadamer, and Ricoeur.|$|E

500|$|The {{sociology}} {{of change and}} development attempts to understand how societies develop {{and how they can}} be changed. This includes studying many different aspects of society, for example demographic trends, political or technological trends, or changes in culture. Within this field, sociologists often use macrosociological methods or historical-comparative methods. In contemporary studies of social change, there are overlaps with international development or community development. However, most of the founders of sociology had theories of social change based on their study of history. For instance, Marx contended that the material circumstances of society ultimately caused the ideal or cultural aspects of society, while Weber argued that it was in fact the cultural mores of Protestantism that ushered in a transformation of material circumstances. In contrast to both, Durkheim argued that societies moved from simple to complex through a process of sociocultural evolution. Sociologists in this field also study processes of globalization and imperialism. Most notably, Immanuel Wallerstein extends Marx's theoretical frame to include large spans of time and the entire globe in what is known as world systems theory. Development sociology is also heavily influenced by post-colonialism. In recent years, Raewyn Connell issued a critique of the bias in sociological research towards countries in the Global North. She argues that this bias blinds sociologists to the <b>lived</b> <b>experiences</b> of the Global South, specifically, so-called, [...] "Northern Theory" [...] lacks an adequate theory of imperialism and colonialism.|$|E
40|$|Background <b>Lived</b> <b>experience</b> {{of mental}} health {{conditions}} is becoming valued within mainstream mental health service delivery. This {{is reflected in the}} rising employment of Peer Support Workers (PSWs) to support and enhance clients’ recovery. However, the <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> {{of mental health}} professionals has been spuriously overlooked in the literature. To date, no studies have explored the influence of <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> on professionals’ roles, identity, work relationships, or its potential clinical utility to enhance clients’ recovery. Methodology This study uses Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) to explore the views and reflections of mental health professionals with their own <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> of mental health challenges. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted on NHS premises. Data was transcribed and subject to in-depth interpretative analysis by the researcher. Results Five superordinate themes emerged from the data: “Lived Experience Informs Practice” reveals how having a greater understanding, empathy, and limited self-disclosure enriches the therapeutic relationship; “Stigma” shows that all participants have experienced stigma from others, and some, self-stigma. Half of the participants spoke about the “them and us” between professionals and clients, and one participant, between professionals and PSWs; “Towards a Culture of Openness” captures participants’ concerns around social acceptability of their <b>lived</b> <b>experience,</b> and their hopes for greater openness and less shame, akin to that in recovery settings; “Changed Identity” highlights the impact of <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> on professionals’ roles and vice versa; and finally, “Experiencing the Organisation as Unsupportive” reveals that participants feel under pressure to prove wellness, that staff wellbeing is not prioritised, and there exists an ironic lack of understanding and support. Conclusion The findings showed that <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> influences mental health professionals’ identity and self-care, their clinical practice, and their working relationships with colleagues and the organisation. Participants valued their <b>lived</b> <b>experience,</b> especially in terms of building strong therapeutic relationships with clients...|$|R

500|$|Either/Or portrays two life views. Each life view {{is written}} and {{represented}} by a fictional pseudonymous author, with the prose of the work reflecting and depending on the life view being discussed. For example, the aesthetic life view is written in short essay form, with poetic imagery and allusions, discussing aesthetic topics such as music, seduction, drama, and beauty. The ethical life view is written as two long letters, with a more argumentative and restrained prose, discussing moral responsibility, critical reflection, and marriage. The views of the book are not neatly summarized, but are expressed as <b>lived</b> <b>experiences</b> embodied by the pseudonymous authors. The book's central concern is the primal question asked by Aristotle, [...] "How should we live?" [...] His book was certainly informed by Epictetus; [...] "Consider first, man, what the matter is, and what your own nature is able to bear. If you would be a wrestler, consider your shoulders, your back, your thighs; for different persons are made for different things. Do {{you think that you}} can act as you do and be a philosopher, that you can eat, drink, be angry, be discontented, as you are now? You must watch, you must labor, you must get the better of certain appetites, must quit your acquaintances, be despised by your servant, be laughed at by those you meet; come off worse than others in everything—in offices, in honors, before tribunals. When you have fully considered all these things, approach, if you please—that is, if, by parting with them, you have a mind to purchase serenity, freedom, and tranquillity. If not, do not come hither; do not, like children, be now a philosopher, then a publican, then an orator, and then one of Caesar’s officers. These things are not consistent. You must be one man, either good or bad. You must cultivate either your own reason or else externals; apply yourself either to things within or without you—that is, be either a philosopher or one of the mob." [...] His motto comes from Plutarch, [...] "The deceived is wiser than one not deceived." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scholars in {{the late}} 20th and early 21st centuries {{extended}} that [...] "narrative imagination" [...] {{to the ability to}} understand the records of <b>lived</b> <b>experiences</b> outside of one's own individual social and cultural context. Through that narrative imagination, it is claimed, humanities scholars and students develop a conscience more suited to the multicultural world we live in. That conscience might {{take the form of a}} passive one that allows more effective self-reflection or extend into active empathy that facilitates the dispensation of civic duties a responsible world citizen must engage in. There is disagreement, however, on the level of influence humanities study can have on an individual and whether or not the understanding produced in humanistic enterprise can guarantee an [...] "identifiable positive effect on people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Imagination, {{as part of}} {{the tool}} kit of artists or scholars, helps create meaning that invokes a {{response}} from an audience. Since a humanities scholar is always within the [...] of <b>lived</b> <b>experiences,</b> no [...] "absolute" [...] knowledge is theoretically possible; knowledge is instead a ceaseless procedure of inventing and reinventing the context a text is read in. Poststructuralism has problematized an approach to the humanistic study based on questions of meaning, intentionality, and authorship. In the wake of the death of the author proclaimed by Roland Barthes, various theoretical currents such as deconstruction and discourse analysis seek to expose the ideologies and rhetoric operative in producing both the purportedly meaningful objects and the hermeneutic subjects of humanistic study. This exposure has opened up the interpretive structures of the humanities to criticism humanities scholarship is [...] "unscientific" [...] and therefore unfit for inclusion in modern university curricula because of the very nature of its changing contextual meaning.|$|E

2500|$|In hip hop culture, it is {{considered}} essential to [...] "keep it real" [...] or to be authentic to the <b>lived</b> <b>experiences</b> of people from disadvantaged neighborhoods ("the Ghetto"). Despite the fact that hip hop artists typically use imagined scenarios and fictionalized stories in their raps, the culture demands that they act as if all their lyrics are true or potentially true. Because of this, lyrics of rap songs have often been treated as [...] "confessions" [...] {{to a number of}} violent crimes in the United States. It is also considered to be the duty of rappers and other hip hop artists (DJs, dancers) to [...] "represent" [...] their city and neighborhood. This demands being proud of being from disadvantaged cities neighborhoods that have traditionally been a source of shame, and glorifying them in lyrics and graffiti. This has potentially been {{one of the ways that}} hip hop has become regarded as a [...] "local" [...] rather than [...] "foreign" [...] genre of music in so many countries around the world in just a few decades. Nevertheless, sampling and borrowing from a number of genres and places is also a part of the hip hop milieu, and an album like the surprise hit Kala by Anglo-Tamil rapper M.I.A. was recorded in locations all across the world and features sounds from a different country on every track.|$|E

40|$|Mental {{health policy}} {{includes}} a clear expectation that consumers {{will participate in}} all aspects of the design and delivery of mental health services. This edict has led to employment roles for people with <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> of significant mental health challenges and service use. Despite the proliferation of these roles, research into factors impacting their success or otherwise is limited. This paper presents findings from a grounded theory study investigating the <b>experiences</b> of <b>Lived</b> <b>Experience</b> Practitioners {{in the context of their}} employment. In-depth interviews were conducted with 13 <b>Lived</b> <b>Experience</b> Practitioners. Risk was identified as a core category, and included sub-categories: vulnerability, &# 039;out and proud&# 039;, fear to disclose, and self-care. Essentially participants described the unique vulnerabilities of their mental health challenges being known, and while there were many positives about disclosing there was also apprehension about personal information being so publically known. Self-care techniques were important mediators against these identified risks. The success of <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> roles requires support and nurses can play an important role, given the size of the nursing workforce in mental health, the close relationships nurses enjoy with consumers and the contribution they have made to the development of <b>lived</b> <b>experience</b> roles within academia...|$|R
