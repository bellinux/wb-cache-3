25|$|With {{the basic}} idea outlined, Hayes and Sirkis gave Heatherington the go-ahead to build a {{prototype}} by adding a microcontroller to an otherwise <b>lightly</b> <b>modified</b> version of their existing 300 bit/s hardware. Sirkis was particularly interested in using the 1MHz PIC microcontroller, which were available for only US$1 a piece. After six months {{of trying to get}} the modem working with the PIC, Heatherington gave up and demanded they use the 8MHz Zilog Z8 instead, a US$10 part. Sirkis acquiesced, and a working prototype was soon complete.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to being a highly competitive racing car, the Cooper Bob-tail was to form the basis for Cooper's first true attempt to enter the World Championship in their own right. Jack Brabham had gained a strong reputation as a racer in his native Australia driving a <b>lightly</b> <b>modified</b> Cooper Bristol which he branded the RedeX Special. On moving to the UK he picked up where he had left off, driving a Cooper-Alta in domestic British series. Brabham's visits to the Cooper works to collect spares led to collaboration with the Cooper outfit, and subsequently wholesale integration with the Cooper works team. Eventually he persuaded the Coopers to allow him to create a Formula One version of the T39 chassis around a 2-litre Bristol engine. Brabham, working almost alone on the car, completed the Formula One special the day before its first race: the 1955 British Grand Prix at Aintree Circuit. Although the car's engine failed on this first outing, subsequent development proved that the rear-engined Cooper was competitive with the best Formula One machinery of the day, ultimately winning the 1955 Australian Grand Prix, and {{paved the way for the}} Cooper works to develop a proper slipper-bodied challenger.|$|E
40|$|Rapport interne. The B {{notation}} {{is based}} on set theory, the language of generalised substitutions and first order logic. B specifications are composed of abstract machines whose states can be modified by operations. The rigour of B specifications is ensured by proof obligations which are automatically generated and proved by the B support tools. The mechanism of proof {{is based on}} mathematical reasoning and rules of inference. In this paper, we present a formal approach to specification and verification of an object-oriented system based on the B method. We <b>lightly</b> <b>modify</b> the structure of abstract machines to make it similar to classes in object-oriented notations. We introduce a simulation machine to simulate the execution and to check the correctness of a specified system. A case study is used to illustrate this approac...|$|R

These inferences can be accounted for in Neo-Davidsonian Event Semantics by means of additional conceptual information in the form of meaning axioms...|$|R

In a first phase the study has carried out {{the current state of the}} art of these instruments, based mainly on bibliographical references and in consultations to the Jesús Usón Minimally Invasive Surgery Centre and the Institute of Biomechanics of Valencia. In a second phase, a tweezer was been modeled and developed with the software CAD 3 D SolidWorks, and later the design has been evaluated, <b>modifying</b> <b>lightly</b> its geometry and materials for reducing the weight. It is important to emphasize the possibilities that SolidWorks offers for the optimization of the design of instruments of laparoscopic surgery. Finally, the study has revealed that with some geometric modifications, that do not modify the use of these instruments, and with some changes in the used materials, it is possible to reduce the weight and facilitates the employment to the user...|$|R
500|$|Spielberg {{attempted}} {{to portray the}} era accurately, using period vehicles and aircraft. Four Harvard SNJ aircraft were <b>lightly</b> <b>modified</b> in France to resemble Mitsubishi A6M Zero aircraft. Two additional non-flying replicas were used. Three restored P-51D Mustangs, two from 'The Fighter Collection' of England, and one from the 'Old Flying Machine Company', were flown in the film. These P-51s were flown by Ray Hanna (who was featured in the film flying at low-level past the child star with the canopy back, waving), his son Mark and [...] "Hoof" [...] Proudfoot and took over 10 days of filming to complete due {{to the complexity of}} the planned aerial sequences, which included the P-51s actually dropping plaster-filled replica 500lb bombs at low level, with simulated bomb blasts. A number of large scale remote control flying models were also used, including an 18-foot wingspan B-29, but Spielberg felt the results were disappointing, so he extended the film contract with the full-size examples and pilots on set in Trebujena, Spain.

40|$|Doctoral thesis (Ph. D.) – University of Nordland, 2012 The {{heart is}} {{considered}} the powerhouse of the cardiovascular system. In this thesis, characterization of cardiac pacemaker and potential biomarkers of cardiac diseases of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) were discussed. The normal performance of the heart requires balance, whether for coronary circulation, the synchrony and effectiveness of myocardial contractions or the influence of its nerves and ganglion cells. Neural control is equally important for the power {{and complexity of the}} heart. The pacemaker is the cardiac neural tissue that is responsible for initiation and control of heart beat. This thesis described the location of cardiac pacemaker of Atlantic salmon at the junction of sinus venosus and atrium. Morphologically, the pacemaker tissue was composed of <b>lightly</b> stained plexiform <b>modified</b> cardiomyocytes, wavy appearing nerve bundles with oval, wavy, elongated nuclei with pointed ends and large round to pear–shaped postganglionic nerve cell bodies (ganglion cells). Novel immuno–localization of the natriuretic peptides such as salmon cardiac peptide (sCP) and ventricular natriuretic peptide (VNP) in the postganglionic nerve cell bodies at SA junction was demonstrated, suggesting their neuromodulatory/neurotransmitter roles in teleosts (Atlantic salmon). Besides CD 3 as a general T cell marker, novel CD 3 immunostaining in the postganglionic nerve cell bodies of cardiac pacemaker of Atlantic salmon was demonstrated, suggesting additional roles of CD 3 in teleosts and shared similar patterns to mammals. Atlantic salmon aquaculture industry bears huge losses due to viral diseases including cardiac viral diseases. Heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI), cardiomyopathy syndrome (CMS) and pancreas disease (PD) are viral diseases of marine farmed Atlantic salmon which mainly affect the heart in addition to other vital organs. The main findings of these diseases are necrosis and mononuclear inflammatory cells infiltrates affecting different regions of the heart. To identify the potential biomarkers of cardiac diseases, blood biochemistry markers were correlated to the CMS– and HSMI–affected Atlantic salmon. Candidate biomarkers included serum enzymes such as creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were measured and significantly correlated to the cardiac pathology of HSMI–affected fish, suggesting promising potential biomarkers to predict the disease (HSMI). Non–significant correlations of serum enzymes to CMS–affected fish suggested that serum enzymes could be used to differentiate between the HSMI and CMS. Further, immunohistochemistry was performed to identify potential markers of cardiac pathological changes of Atlantic salmon affected with similar cardiac diseases (CMS, HSMI and PD). The spectrum of inflammatory cells associated with the cardiac pathology consisted of mainly CD 3 Ɛ+ T lymphocytes and lymphocytic response dominated over granulocytes in the CMS–, PD– and HSMI–affected hearts. Macrophage–like and eosinophilic granular cells were identified by rTNFα antiserum in all three investigated diseased hearts, particularly in areas surrounding lesions. MHC class II antiserum identified strong, moderate and low levels of immunopositive cells in diseased hearts in HSMI, CMS and PD respectively. The CD 3, MHC class II, PCNA, TNFα, caspase 3 and TUNEL staining were mostly confined to lesioned areas in the diseased hearts, pointing to pathological changes and suggesting the markers appear promising as a supplementary tool in the identification of lesioned areas in the investigated diseased hearts. Interestingly, the apparently similar diseases exhibited differences in the immunopathological responses in Atlantic salmon...|$|R
