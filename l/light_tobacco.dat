60|$|Toomer was an {{interesting}} type. He had a disagreeable disposition profoundly modified by a public school and university training. Two antagonistic forces made him. He was the spirit of scurrility incarnate, that was, as people say, innate; and by virtue of those moulding forces he was {{doing his best to}} be an English gentleman. That mysterious impulse which compels the young male to make objectionable imputations against seemly lives and to write rare inelegant words upon clean and decent things burnt almost intolerably within him, and equally powerful now was the gross craving he had acquired for personal association with all that is prominent, all that is successful, all that is of good report. He had found his resultant in the censorious defence of established things. He conducted the British Critic, attacking with a merciless energy all that was new, all that was critical, all those fresh and noble tentatives that admit of unsavoury interpretations, and when the urgent Yahoo in him carried him below the pretentious dignity of his accustomed organ he would squirt out his bitterness in a little sham facetious bookstall volume with a bright cover and quaint woodcuts, in which just as many prominent people as possible were mentioned by name and a sauce of general absurdity could be employed to cover and, if need be, excuse particular libels. So he managed to relieve himself and get along. Harman was just on the border-line of the class he considered himself free to revile. Harman was an outsider and aggressive and new, one of Mrs. Blapton's knights, and of no particular weight in society; so far he was fair game; but he was not so new as he had been, he was almost through with the running of the Toomer gauntlet, he had a tremendous lot of money and it was with a modified vehemence that the distinguished journalist and humourist expatiated on his offensiveness to Mr. Brumley. He talked in a gentle, rather weary voice, that came through a moustache like a fringe of <b>light</b> <b>tobacco.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Were {{the flame}} {{to go out}} in a lamp, then there was a temptation for the collier to relight it. Some opened the lamps to <b>light</b> <b>tobacco</b> pipes underground. [...] Both of these {{practices}} were strictly forbidden; they clearly negated {{the whole point of the}} safety lamp. The miner was expected to return to the shaft to perform relighting, a round trip of up to a few miles. For men on piece work, this meant a loss of income (perhaps 10% of their day's pay) and so was unpopular. From the mid-century onwards, and particularly after the 1872 act, lamps had to have a lock mechanism which prevented the miner opening the lamp. Two schemes existed; either a special tool was required which kept at the pit head or else opening the lamp extinguished the flame. The latter mechanism can be seen in the Mueseler, Landau and Yates lamps below. Such a lamp was known as a protector lamp, a term picked up and used as a company name. Only on the return to the bank could the lamp man open the lamp for refilling and service. Various different locking mechanisms were developed; miners tended to be ingenious in finding ways of circumventing them. A number of additional lamps were supposed to accompany each gang of men, but restricting the number was an obvious economy for the pit owners.|$|E

25|$|An African slave named Stephan {{changed the}} process of curing the Bright Leaf <b>tobacco</b> variety (a <b>lighter</b> flavored <b>tobacco</b> leaf) by curing it with {{charcoal}} taken from a local blacksmith's fire rather than the usual logwood. This fire burned hotter and faster and accelerated the curing process. The process was refined further to include a furnace in which heat from the charcoal was applied through flues, so that dark soot and off flavors did not {{come in contact with}} the tobacco. This changed the curing process of a lighter leaf and produced a new, <b>lighter</b> <b>tobacco</b> which was able to be inhaled. This, linked together with the British Victorian desire for cigarettes, along with the aforementioned French and other European countries, gave way to an emerging market to minced tobacco. This trend had not yet hit America for its export market.|$|R

40|$|Antisera to acidic isoforms of pathogenesis-related {{proteins}} {{were used}} to measure the induction of these proteins in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) leaves. Endo-(1 - 4) -β-xylanase purified from culture filtrates of Trichoderma viride was a strong elicitor of pathogenesis-related protein synthesis in tobacco leaves. The synthesis of these proteins was localized to tissue at the area of enzyme application. The inhibitors of ethylene biosynthesis and ethylene action, 1 -aminoethoxyvinylglycine and silver thiosulfate, inhibited accumulation of pathogenesis-related proteins induced by tobacco mosaic virus and α-aminobutyric acid, but did not inhibit elicitation by xylanase. Likewise, the induction of these proteins by the tobacco pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci was not affected by the inhibitors of ethylene biosynthesis and action. The leaf response to tobacco mosaic virus and α-aminobutyric acid was dependent on light in normal and photosynthetically incompetent leaves. In contrast, the response of leaves to xylanase was independent of <b>light.</b> <b>Tobacco</b> mosaic virus and α-aminobutyric acid induced concerted accumulation of pathogenesis-related proteins. However, xylanase elicited the accumulation of only a subset of these proteins. Specifically, the plant (1 - 3) -β-glucanases, which are normally a part of the concerted response, were underrepresented. These experiments have revealed the presence of a novel ethylene-independent pathway for pathogenesis-related protein induction that is activated by xylanase...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Cigarette {{smoking is}} {{associated}} with a more severe Crohn's disease (CD) course. However, the effect of light consumption is not known. Our aim was to characterize the effect of a <b>light</b> <b>tobacco</b> consumption on the course of CD. METHODS: We analyzed the course of CD during the period 1995 - 2007 from data collected in 2795 consecutive patients in whom smoking habits were recorded. Patients were classified as nonsmokers (n = 1420), light smokers (1 - 10 cigarettes/day; n = 385), heavy smokers (> 10 cigarettes/day; n = 638), and intermittent smokers (change in smoking habits; n = 352). Patient-years while smoking were compared to patient-years without smoking. The analyses considered patient-years regarding annual disease activity and therapeutic requirements. RESULTS: The percentage of years with active disease was 37 % in nonsmokers versus 46 % in light smokers (P < 0. 001; adjusted hazard ratio 1. 30 [1. 19 - 1. 43]) and 48 % in heavy smokers (P < 0. 001; adjusted hazard ratio 1. 68 [1. 57 - 1. 81]), despite an increased use of immunosuppressants in smokers. Hospitalization rates were also increased in both groups of smokers, with 12 % in nonsmokers versus 15 % in both groups of smokers (P < 0. 001 for both comparisons). The annual rate of intestinal resection was 4. 5 % in nonsmokers, 5. 1 % in light smokers, and 5. 5 % in heavy smokers, with a significant difference observed between nonsmokers and heavy smokers only (P < 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: Light smokers are doing worse than nonsmokers regarding disease activity and the need for immunosuppressants. Complete smoking cessation should be advised in all smokers with CD...|$|E
40|$|In June 1932 we {{received}} at the Institute for Plant-diseases at Buitenzorg (Java) {{a number of}} Coreid bugs, sent by the Adjunct Agricultural Adviser stationed at Wonogiri (Res. Djocjacarta, Central Java), which bugs were reported of causing rather serious damage to Cassava plants (Manihot utillissima Pohl); the sending included some damaged plants. The Coreids were sent for identification to Dr. H. C. Blöte, curator of the Leiden Museum, as it was known {{to me that he}} was studying this special group of Heteroptera. Recently Dr. Blöte (1935) described the species sent as Dasynus manihotis. It is closely related to another noxious species of Dasynus, some years ago described by China as Dasynus piperis, which is well known by the studies of Dr. J. van der Vecht (1933). Character of the damage. Dasynus manihotis sucks the top parts of the stems of the Cassava plants. Its punction causes the tissues to shrink and the leaves to wither. Soon after the punction the shrunken tissues take a brownish colour, later the leaves wither entirely and drop, and the stems that are much punctured die off. New leaves can develop from {{the lower part of the}} stem, but in the meantime growth is much retarded. The illustration (fig. 1) gives a good impression of the damage in its earlier stage. The irregular sunken patches in the lower part of the stem have a <b>light</b> <b>tobacco</b> to chocolate brown colour. The smaller spots between the second and the third small leaves from below are pale brown. Experiments in the laboratory on healthy plants gave the same symptoms. Bionomical notes.

Most Batek are unwilling to settle in Pos Labir because it has not been dedicated to the Batek, they would have to leave there if the Government asked and they would lose their nomadic lifestyle and their religion. One of the Batek summed up the situation by saying: “We Batek are rich if we have a cooking pot, digging stick, bush-knife, <b>lighter,</b> <b>tobacco,</b> salt and fishing pole. Also a man is sad if he doesn't have a blowpipe. We only want four or five sarongs, we don't need trousers. If we live here (in Pos Lebir), we need money, if we have money we buy a lot.

50|$|The {{causes of}} the tunnel {{explosion}} were reported through witness testimonies and through the formal investigation of the accident. In the formal investigation of the accident there were three possibilities proposed for what could have caused the ignition of the blasting powder: electrical sparks or current, open lanterns, and <b>lighted</b> <b>tobacco</b> pipes. For the topic of electricity, the main focus was on a drill or crowbar touching the power cable, {{or one of the}} cans was brought into direct contact with a low hanging power cable. This theory was concluded to be improbable since there were no drills or crowbars found in the debris and there were no signs of arcing from electricity. It was also concluded that the probability of a crew member placing a powder can {{on the edge of a}} mine cart in just the right spot to touch the power cable was also extremely low, since it would almost have to be done on purpose. The report goes on to conclude that electricity was an improbable cause because of the lack of arc burns on the mine carts and powder cans. The theories of an open lamp or a lit pipe igniting the powder were much more probable, as stated in the report, as lamps were found in the debris and attached to places near where powder would be located. It was also noted that miners would trade blasting powder if they did not bring enough for the day’s job, allowing sparks from lit matches or tobacco pipes to contact the powder.|$|R

Another method saw the use of a striker, a tool that looked like scissors, but with flint on one [...] "blade" [...] and steel on the other.
