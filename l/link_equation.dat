40|$|In this thesis, I {{created an}} {{algorithm}} {{to compensate for}} the saturation of data collected by the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA). Saturation of the energy measurements had made it impossible to measure surface roughness at 100 m length scales. By calculating the returned energy, the problem of saturation can be avoided. This algorithm was applied to MOLA data across the Martian surface to create an estimate of surface roughness across the planet. The method calculates pulse spreading from returned pulse energy using the <b>link</b> <b>equation.</b> The accuracy of the method is limited by the accuracy of albedo measurements. This analysis improved the estimation of surface roughness on Mars. Further improvements could be gained by correcting for the opacity of atmospheric dust as a cause of pulse spreading. by Andrew Benedict Mamo. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|Vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) and microlenses {{can be used}} to {{implement}} free space optical interconnects (FSOIs) which do not suffer from the bandwidth limitations inherent in metallic interconnects. A comprehensive <b>link</b> <b>equation</b> describing the effects of both optical and electrical noise is introduced. We have evaluated FSOI performance by examining the following metrics: the space-bandwidth product (SBP), describing the density of channels and aggregate bandwidth that can be achieved, and the carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR), which represents the relative strength of the carrier signal. The mode expansion method (MEM) was used to account for the primary cause of optical noise: laser beam diffraction. While the literature commonly assumes an ideal single-mode laser beam, we consider the experimentally determined multimodal structure of a VCSEL beam in our calculations. It was found that maximum achievable interconnect length and density for a given CNR was significantly reduced when the higher order transverse modes were present in Simulations. However, the Simulations demonstrate that free-space optical interconnects are still a suitable solution for the communications bottleneck, despite the adverse effects introduced by transverse modes...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2004 In this research, an {{analytical}} model for analyzing a production line {{consisting of a}} series of automated workstations with infinite buffers is developed. Automated workstations are assumed to have deterministic processing times, and independent exponentially distributed operating time between failures and repair times. The analytical model starts with existing results from a Markov chain model of two automated workstations in series, where analytical expressions are developed for the average number of jobs in the second workstation and its queue. This research focuses on the development of a set of <b>linking</b> <b>equations</b> {{that can be used to}} analyze larger systems using a two workstation decomposition approach.

Simulations of a number of different 3 -workstation and 10 -workstation systems were carried out employing a range of workstation utilizations and processing time coefficients of variation.

Since such single-ended systems are incapable of ranging beyond the Moon to the planets, we consider the feasibility of a two-way asynchro-nous (i. e. independently firing) interplanetary laser transponder pair, capable of decimeter ranging and sub-nanosecond time transfer from Earth to a spacecraft anywhere within the inner Solar System. After introducing the transponder <b>link</b> <b>equation</b> {{and the concept of}} ‘‘balanced’ ’ transponders, we describe how range and time can be transferred between terminals, and preview the potential advantages of photon counting asynchronous transponders for interplanetary applications. We then develop mathematical models for the various sources of noise in an interplanetary transponder link including planetary albedo, solar or lunar illu-mination of the local atmosphere, and laser backscatter off the local atmosphere.

40|$|In {{order to}} develop a laser system for multi-wavelength {{satellite}} laser ranging, the joint group of the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory and the Czech Technical University has studied the conversion efficiency of the Raman-shifting beam and its spatial characteristics. We adopted a 0. 53 mum laser with pulse width of 35 ps and peak energy of 35 mJ, the second harmonic of a Nd:YAG actively and passively mode-locked laser, to pump a one-meter-long Raman tube which is full of H- 2 with high pressure at the Prague-based laboratory. We get the first Stokes laser (0. 68 mum) : 7 mJ (single pulse) with beam divergence of 40 " (arcsecond) and spatial wobbling of less than 4 "; and the first anti-Stokes laser (0. 43 mum) : 2 mJ (single pulse) with divergence of 56 " and spatial wobbling of less than 4 ". The emitting beam from the Raman cell also includes 0. 53 mum: 10 mJ (single pulse) with divergence of 40 " and spatial wobbling of less than 7 ".

40|$|The range {{uncertainties}} {{associated with}} the refractive atmosphere can be mitigated by the technique of two color, or dual wavelength, ranging. The precision of the differential time of flight (DTOF) measurement depends on the atmospheric dispersion between the two wavelengths, the received pulsewidths and photoelectron counts, and {{on the amount of}} temporal averaging. In general, the transmitted wavelengths are not independently chosen but instead are generated via nonlinear optics techniques (harmonic crystals, Raman scattering, etc.) which also determine their relative pulsewidths. The mean received photoelectrons at each wavelength are calculated via the familiar radar <b>link</b> <b>equation</b> which contains several wavelength dependent parameters. By collecting the various wavelength dependent terms, one can define a wavelength figure of merit for a two color laser ranging system. In this paper, we apply the wavelength figure of merit to the case of an extremely clear atmosphere and draw several conclusions regarding the relative merits of fundamental-second harmonic, fundamental-third harmonic, second-third harmonic, and Raman two color systems. We find that, in spite of the larger dispersion between wavelengths, fundamental-third harmonic systems have the lowest figure of merit due to a combination of poor detector performance at the fundamental and poor atmospheric transmission at the third harmonic. The fundamental-second harmonic systems (approximately 700 nm and 350 nm) have the highest figure of merit, but second-third harmonic systems, using fundamental transmitters near 1000 nm, are a close second. Raman-shifted transmitters appear to offer no advantage over harmonic systems because of the relatively small wavelength separation that can be achieved in light gases such as hydrogen and the lack of good ultrashort pulse transmitters with an optimum fundamental wavelength near 400 nm...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A group {{signature}} scheme is a digital signature scheme {{that allows a}} group member to sign messages anonymously {{on behalf of the}} group. Recently, Tseng and Jan proposed two {{group signature}} schemes based on self-certified and ID-based public keys respectively.

In this paper, we first point out that the proposed <b>linking</b> <b>equation,</b> which is used to check the linkability of Tseng and Jan’s self-certified scheme, cannot work because the inverse problem of RSA is hard.
