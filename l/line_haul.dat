25|$|Team {{drivers are}} two drivers who take turns driving the same truck in shifts (sometimes husband and wife), or several people in {{different}} states that split up the haul (<b>line</b> <b>haul)</b> {{to keep from}} being away from home for such long periods.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} {{different}} classes of freight railroads: Class I, regional, local <b>line</b> <b>haul,</b> and switching & terminal. Class I railroads {{are defined as}} those with revenue of at least $346.8 million in 2006. They comprise just {{one percent of the}} number of freight railroads, but account for 67 percent of the industry's mileage, 90 percent of its employees, and 93 percent of its freight revenue.|$|E
2500|$|Local <b>line</b> <b>haul</b> railroads operate {{less than}} [...] and {{earn less than}} $40 million per year (most earn less than $5 million per year). In 2006, there were 323 local <b>line</b> <b>haul</b> railroads. They {{generally}} perform point-to-point service over short distances.|$|E

2500|$|A {{regional}} railroad is a <b>line</b> <b>haul</b> railroad with {{at least}} [...] and/or revenue between $40 million and the Class I threshold. There were 33 regional railroads in 2006. Most have between 75 and 500 employees.|$|E
2500|$|Getting paid by {{percentage}} {{is the preferred}} way of business among veteran drivers and owner-operators. Typical percentage among owner-operators pulling flatbed trailers is between 85-90 percent of <b>line</b> <b>haul</b> being paid to the driver. Additionally the driver may receive 100 percent of fuel surcharges and fees for extra pickups or drops or for tarping loads. It creates strong incentives for drivers for agreeing to pull especially difficult loads; i.e. pieces that are especially heavy or large, that require tarping, pieces that are being shipped or received along treacherous routes far from the interstates. It also discourages drivers and owner-operators from agreeing to move [...] "cheap freight". Percentage of load is the simplest way of calculating what a driver and his/her truck will earn.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{the nature}} of the job, most drivers stay out longer than 4 weeks at a time. A few for months on end and even longer. For the average large company driver in the United States 6 weeks is the average, with each week out garnering the driver one day off. This accrues to a set maximum usually 6 or 7 days. This is the average for OTR (Over The Road) <b>Line</b> <b>Haul</b> and Regional drivers. Vocational and Local drivers are usually home every night or every other night. Most {{tractors}} are equipped with sleeper berths that range from 36" [...] to as large as 86" [...] in length. While there are larger sleepers that get up to 144" [...] in length, these are not seen in the mainline segment of trucking. Those are usually seen in the specialized and household moving segments, where the load is either permitted for overweight or oversize or is very light yet bulky.|$|E

2500|$|In 1881, the New Jersey Midland Railroad was {{consolidated}} {{with five}} other railroads {{to form the}} New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway. The new New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway had extended west to Gravel Place, Pennsylvania, and a connection with the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railway (DL). [...] The NYS also had {{a connection to the}} DL at Delaware, New Jersey via the Blairstown Railway. [...] Due to the increased volume of traffic, the railroad was double-tracked from Paterson to Jersey City in 1887. To reach the port on the Hudson River waterfront, traffic was handed off to the Pennsylvania Railroad at Marion Junction via the Hudson Connecting Railway. To keep more of the <b>line</b> <b>haul</b> revenue for themselves, the Susquehanna extended their line from their Little Ferry Yard through the new Palisades Tunnel to a new terminal at Edgewater where they had constructed coal docks for transfer from train to boat in 1892. The NYSW also reached west of the Delaware River and leased the Wilkes-Barre and Eastern Railroad to access the Scranton area directly and divert traffic away from the Lackawanna.|$|E
