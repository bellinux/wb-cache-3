2500|$|Emperor Xuanzong {{began to}} be concerned, but took no decisive action, instead stating, [...] "Do not speak further. [...] <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> about these things." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 2. Where art thou, my gentle child? [...] 10 <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> thy spirit feeds, With {{its life}} intense and mild, The love of living leaves and weeds Among these tombs and ruins wild;-- <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> that through low seeds [...] 15 Of sweet flowers and sunny grass Into their hues and scents may pass A portion-- ...|$|E
60|$|Ben. Pray, sir, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> I am a wit, or {{my heart}} will break.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{mean about}} his <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> he didn't ca'e for me, so long. But don't {{you think he}} wants to do what is right! Mr. Gregory, I mean." ...|$|R
60|$|JULIA O Faulkland, {{when your}} {{kindness}} can make <b>me</b> thus happy, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> not <b>think</b> that I discovered something of coldness in your first salutation.|$|R
6000|$|Yes, I {{am writing}} to a man; but <b>let</b> <b>me</b> not <b>think</b> of that, for madness {{is in the}} thought. You will {{understand}} my feelings? O yes, I am sure you will; and you will respect them too, and not despise them, - will you? ...|$|R
60|$|CARMODY (resuming his walk). And {{who else}} is there, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>think?</b> Oh, Mary--she's the same as ever, you can see for yourself.|$|E
6000|$|LADY WINDERMERE. I {{am afraid}} of being myself. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>think!</b> Let me wait! My husband may return to me. [Sits down on sofa.] ...|$|E
6000|$|Trick. That's impossible; he'll meet you. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> a moment:--Mrs Saintly is abroad, and cannot {{discover}} you: {{have any}} of the servants seen you? ...|$|E
6000|$|Yet not to earth's {{contracted}} span [...] Thy goodness <b>let</b> <b>me</b> bound, Or <b>think</b> Thee Lord alone of man, [...] When thousand {{worlds are}} round: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{go to her}} {{as soon as he}} will <b>let</b> <b>me.</b> I don't <b>think</b> he will forbid my {{going to}} her, perhaps, after a day or two; but I know he would not <b>let</b> <b>me</b> go on purpose to meet her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' said Wilmet. 'They {{will not}} <b>let</b> <b>me,</b> though I <b>think</b> {{it would have}} been wiser. I do not know how it is to be, except that it is utterly {{impossible}} for the present.' ...|$|R
60|$|L. (seeing he has {{no chance}} against the odds). Well, well; but I'm really tired. Go and dance a little, first; and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>think.</b>|$|E
60|$|Pala. I confess I was {{thinking}} so, {{as fast as}} I could; but you think so much before me, that you will <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> nothing.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope not. That {{would be}} worst of all!" [...] said Caroline. [...] "I must ask Janet. Don't say {{anything}} about it, my dear. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> it over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why indeed not?" [...] {{said the}} other with a sudden {{recrudescence}} of his usual gaiety. [...] "I can do it, old compeer! Dondersteen, but I should be a smeerlap if I did not. Wait one moment.... <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> just <b>think....</b> Yes! I have the way clear in my mind now.... I will be here as early as I was to-day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, and besides, my dear, I should hate to {{have any}} of the neighbors come and find us all up here. It would look so utterly absurd. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> try and <b>think</b> of some other plan." ...|$|R
5000|$|Crichton {{said he did}} {{not wish}} to make his directorial debut with science fiction but, [...] "That's the only way I could get the studio to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> direct. People <b>think</b> I'm good at it I guess." ...|$|R
6000|$|PURDIE. And so I am now. (He sees he is not.) Where did I change? The wood! <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>think.</b> The wood ... {{the wood}}, certainly. But the wood wasn't the wood.|$|E
6000|$|... "Fair and square, I don't, Worry. You {{never would}} <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> {{of how many}} runs we had or needed. I can count seven--yes, and one more, that was Reddy's home-run." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will never}} do," [...] he said, {{shaking his head}} ominously, when she had explained. [...] "You simply must collect that money somehow. Let me see. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> a moment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Because I can't {{get rid of}} her. Old Cissie nursed my mother, and {{she says}} she'll nurse me till she dies. The idea! She never <b>lets</b> <b>me</b> alone. She <b>thinks</b> I'm delicate. She has grown infirm in her understanding, you know. Mad--quite mad, poor Cissie!' ...|$|R
60|$|It seemed then, in my {{pain and}} bitterness, that I would rather <b>let</b> Buell <b>think</b> <b>me</b> dead. Dick's voice went {{straight}} to my heart, but I made no answer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't suppose I ever shall howl. I'm too {{thoroughly}} subdued; {{and with}} Cornelia here to-day I shall {{be able to}} hold in. You're the first Synthesis girl," [...] she frankly explained to Cornelia, [...] "that mamma's ever <b>let</b> <b>me</b> have. She <b>thinks</b> they spend all their time drawing the nude." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Am I a man, or only a coward?" [...] he muttered. [...] "Lass, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>think.</b> Don't believe I'm harsh, nor cold, nor nothin' {{except that}} I {{want to do}} what's right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is he indeed!" [...] the Count said in surprise. [...] "I {{had taken}} him {{to be at least}} your equal in years. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>think,</b> you are but {{eighteen}} and some months?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing, nothing, child," [...] she murmured, as in a dream. [...] "Wait {{a moment}} [...] . <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> [...] . think! [...] . You said [...] . the Scarlet Pimpernel had gone today [...] . ?" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{turned in}} amazement {{to see if}} she had heard aright. He had removed his glasses, and the deep blue {{expressive}} eyes so seldom plainly visible were wistfully, pleadingly, fixed on her, brimming over with the dew of earnestness. Her face of inquiry gave him courage to go on, 'If you would only <b>let</b> <b>me,</b> I <b>think</b> I could bring you home to see him; and if you would believe it and try, I believe I could make you happier,' and with an uncontrollable shake in his voice he ceased--and only looked.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't mind {{saying that}} I was getting some {{interested}} myself--oh, {{not in the}} way Sarah never <b>lets</b> up <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> know she <b>thinks.</b> That two-pound nugget was what had me going. If Vahna'd put me wise to where it came from, I could say good-bye to railroading and hit the high places for Nebraska and Sarah.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I wish {{people would}} let one's daughters alone!' exclaimed Mr. Kendal. 'You {{will talk to}} her then, Albinia, and don't <b>let</b> her <b>think</b> <b>me</b> more harsh than you can help, and come and tell me how she bears it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hold on! Hold on! Hold on!" [...] cried Brown, {{frowning}} {{more and}} more, with a quite unusual concentration of curiosity. [...] "Don't think me rude. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> this {{out for a}} moment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is queer, mighty queer," [...] {{said the}} teacher to himself. [...] "Now, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> what I did with them. Yes, I {{put them in the}} glass, I am {{positive}} of it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|But, dreary tho' {{the moments}} fleet, [...] O <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> we yet shall meet; [...] That only ray of solace sweet, [...] Can on thy Chloris shine, Love! [...] O wert thou, &c.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Vyner sighed. [...] "I don’t know," [...] he said, slowly. [...] "It {{is not of}} long standing; I only {{noticed it}} a little while ago. The first time I had an attack I was sitting in my office—working. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> see. I <b>think</b> {{it was the day}} you came in there to see your father. Yes, I am sure it was." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{wish to be}} unfair," [...] she replied. [...] "Only, {{since you}} ask me, I {{have to tell you}} that that is the way it seems to me. I don't want to {{introduce}} the question of right and wrong into this, Hugh, I'm not capable of unravelling it; I can't put myself into your life, and see things from your point of view, weigh your problems and difficulties. In the first place, you won't <b>let</b> <b>me.</b> I <b>think</b> I understand you, partly--but only partly. You have kept yourself shut up. But why discuss it? I have made up my mind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am struggling, and I shall succeed; but I cannot {{do it all}} at once. At {{any rate}} I could not go there. You must give my love to Lady Julia, and not <b>let</b> her <b>think</b> <b>me</b> cross. Perhaps Bell will go." ...|$|R
