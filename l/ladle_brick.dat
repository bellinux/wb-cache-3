40|$|The {{present study}} aims to {{synthesize}} SiAlON-based composites utilizing coal gangue. Different types of SiAlON-based composites were synthesized using coal gangue by carbothermal reduction nitridation method through control of different reaction atmospheres. The experimental {{results indicate that}} the oxygen partial pressure was an essential factor in the manufacture of SiAlON-based composites and under proper control of the atmospheres, SiAlON-based composites with different crystal structures could be synthesized. The optimum conditions of synthesis of different SiAlON-based composites were respectively determined. Based on the laboratory results, a prototype plant was proposed and constructed, and β-SiAlON composite was successfully produced using coal gangue. The synthesized β-SiAlON composite was applied in preparation of iron <b>ladle</b> <b>brick</b> instead of SiC, which showed that the compression strength, refractoriness under load and high temperature bending strength were increased from 44. 5 ± 6. 7 MPa, 1618 ± 21 °C and 5. 4 ± 1. 2 MPa to 64. 1 ± 2. 5 MPa, 1700 ± 28 °C and 7. 1 ± 1. 6 MPa, respectively. Compared with the traditional synthesis method, the present technique is expected to save energy both in raw materials and technical process...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this experiment, {{preparation}} of samples were based on original ratio of bauxite matrix Al 2 O 3 -SiC-C castable for iron runner, and partial bauxites of size 8 - 5 mm, 5 - 3 mm, 3 - 1 mm and < 0. 074 mm were replaced by the same size granular recycling Al 2 O 3 -MgO-C materials from spent <b>ladle</b> <b>bricks,</b> respectively. Effects of particle size {{and content of the}} recycled materials on sintering performance of the castable were investigated. The sintering performance was analyzed by measuring apparent porosity, room temperature flexural strength, room temperature pressure strength and high temperature flexural strength. The results showed that the apparent porosity of the samples overall tended to increase with content of the recycling materials increasing, while room temperature flexural strength, room temperature pressure strength and high temperature flexural strength of the samples reduced gradually. 8 - 5 mm and 5 - 3 mm particle of 5 %- 15 % the recycling Al 2 O 3 -MgO-C materials was more suitable for the preservation of high temperature flexural strength and room temperature strength of the samples than 3 - 1 mm and < 0. 074 mm particle...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY. The {{occurrence}} ofcookeite, a di/trioctahedral chlorite {{of composition}} (A 13. 95 Feo. o 2 Mg 0. ol Li 0. sl) (A 10. 74 Sia. ~) Oio(OH) s, in the Back Creek pyrophyllite deposit near Pambula is described. The mineral {{is restricted to}} a relatively narrow zone near {{the centre of the}} deposit and although diaspore is also present in this zone the two have not been found in intimate association, it is concluded that the introduction of lithium has been the principal factor controlling development ofthe cookeite. THERE are three known deposits of pyrophyllite in New South Wales (Loughnan, 196 o) of which that at Back Creek near Pambula on the far south coast appears the most extensive. But, although the material has been worked intermittently for many years, until recently {{little in the way of}} subsurface xploration had been carried out, and hence specific information on the mineral composition and origin of the deposit was lacking. However, renewed interest in the use of pyrophyllite, particularly for the making of refractory <b>ladle</b> <b>bricks,</b> has resulted in a reappraisal of the deposit by the Pyrophyllite Corporation with a series of diamond and percussion drillholes and an extensive open cut in the southern part of the outcrop. Geological setting. The deposit is situated IO. 5 km south-west of Pambula nd occur...|$|R

In this experiment, {{preparation}} of samples were based on original ratio of bauxite matrix Al 2 O 3 -SiC-C castable for iron tap channel, and partial bauxites of size 8 - 5 mm, 5 - 3 mm, 3 - 1 mm and < 0. 074 mm were replaced by recycling materials {{of the same size}} granular from spent Al 2 O 3 -MgO-C <b>ladle</b> <b>bricks,</b> respectively. Effects of recycling ladle lining materials on phase composition and microstructure of Al 2 O 3 -SiC-C castable for iron runner were investigated by XRD, SEM and EDS. The results showed that new phases SiO 2 and (Mg 0. 804 Ca 0. 196) 3 Al 2 (SiO 4) 3 were formed in the castable at 1450 o C in air atmosphere, and the spherical (Mg 0. 804 Ca 0. 196) 3 Al 2 (SiO 4) 3 was formed on external surface of recycling Al 2 O 3 -MgO-C particle. thereinto, SiC oxidation to formed SiO 2 with flow pattern character was key element of the phase (Mg 0. 804 Ca 0. 196) 3 Al 2 (SiO 4) 3 formation. The more fine and uniform of recycling Al 2 O 3 -MgO-C particles, the more spherical (Mg 0. 804 Ca 0. 196) 3 Al 2 (SiO 4) 3 was formed in recycling Al 2 O 3 -SiC-C castable. Internal structure of theirs samples exhibited looser state with content increasing of recycling ladle lining materials...|$|R
40|$|Proceedings of the 8 th Conference and Exhibition of the European Ceramic Society; Istanbul; Turkey; 29 June 2003 through 3 July 2003 A {{multilayer}} feed-forward {{back-propagation learning}} algorithm was employed as an {{artificial neural network}} (ANN) tool to create a model to predict the corrosion of MgO-C <b>ladle</b> refractory <b>bricks</b> based on laboratory slag corrosion test data. The corrosion process occurred by immersion of the rectangular refractory specimens in molten slag-steel bath. An ANN model to predict the amount of corrosion was created by using the training data. The model was also tested with experimentally measured data and relatively low error levels were achieved. This model was then used to predict {{the response of the}} slag-corrosion system to different values of the factors affecting the corrosion of bricks at high temperatures. Exposure time, exposure temperature of slag-brick contact and CaO/SiO 2 ratio of the slag were the factors used for modelling. Model results provided the potential for selection of the best conditions for avoiding the factor combinations that may accelerate corrosion...|$|R
40|$|Steel ladle {{sidewall}} buildup is {{a phenomenon}} that has been observed in steel plants across the world. A laboratory-based investigation that involved immersing test rods of <b>ladle</b> refractory sidewall <b>brick</b> into molten slags of varying compositions was conducted. The mechanism of sidewall buildup was subsequently investigated by varying the thermal regime following slag immersion and observing the resulting microstructures. Slags high in silica exhibited a discontinuous precipitation of corundum, with an additional deposit of anorthite depending on the cooling rate following slag immersion. Slags containing large quantities of alumina were observed to form well-defined bands of hibonite and calcium dialuminate, {{in addition to a}} matrix in some regions, which contained spinel and calcium aluminate. Increasing lime in high-alumina slags was observed to decrease the quantity of slag deposited on the test rods. Experimental results suggest that the mechanism of sidewall buildup may involve a dual-stage process in which dissolution of the sidewall into the bulk slag layer during casting contributes to a loss of material, and dissolution into an adhered liquid layer following casting promotes the formation of solid phases and contributes to increased sidewall thickness...|$|R
