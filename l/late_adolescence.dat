5|$|A complex {{mixture of}} genetic and {{environmental}} factors influences {{the risk of the}} development of alcoholism. Genes that influence the metabolism of alcohol also influence the risk of alcoholism, and may be indicated by a family history of alcoholism. One paper has found that alcohol use at an early age may influence the expression of genes which increase the risk of alcohol dependence. Individuals who have a genetic disposition to alcoholism {{are also more likely to}} begin drinking at an earlier age than average. Also, a younger age of onset of drinking is associated with an increased risk of the development of alcoholism, and about 40 percent of alcoholics will drink excessively by their <b>late</b> <b>adolescence.</b> It is not entirely clear whether this association is causal, and some researchers have been known to disagree with this view.|$|E

This {{is due to the fact}} that a grammatical construction on an L2 that has a parallel structure in an L1 would impose less processing demand than one that does not have a parallel, causing a poorer performance on language structure.|$|E
25|$|Neither the DSM nor the ICD-10 {{diagnostic}} criteria require actual sexual activity with a prepubescent youth. The diagnosis {{can therefore be}} made based {{on the presence of}} fantasies or sexual urges even if they have never been acted upon. On the other hand, a person who acts upon these urges yet experiences no distress about their fantasies or urges can also qualify for the diagnosis. Acting on sexual urges is not limited to overt sex acts for purposes of this diagnosis, and can sometimes include indecent exposure, voyeuristic or frotteuristic behaviors, or masturbating to child pornography. Often, these behaviors need to be considered in-context with an element of clinical judgment before a diagnosis is made. Likewise, when the patient is in <b>late</b> <b>adolescence,</b> the age difference is not specified in hard numbers and instead requires careful consideration of the situation.|$|E
25|$|Evolutionary {{psychology}} {{has been}} applied to explain criminal or otherwise immoral behavior as being adaptive or related to adaptive behaviors. Males are generally more aggressive than females, who are more selective of their partners because of the far greater effort they have to contribute to pregnancy and child-rearing, and this is hypothesized to stem from the more intense reproductive competition faced by them. Males of low status may be especially vulnerable to being childless. It may have been evolutionary advantageous to engage in highly risky and be violently aggressive behavior to increase their status and therefore reproductive success. This may explain why males are generally involved in more crimes, and why low status and being unmarried is associated with criminality. Furthermore, competition over females is argued to have been particularly intensive in <b>late</b> <b>adolescence</b> and young adulthood, which is theorized to explain why crime rates are particularly high during this period.|$|E

40|$|Adolescence is an {{important}} developmental period between childhood and adulthood. During adolescence, significant structural changes {{take place in the}} brain and in particularly in the frontal cortex. The frontal cortex plays a crucial role in higher brain functions such as working memory, inhibition and selective attention. Therefore, accurate information about development of the frontal cortex helps to better understanding these functions. In this study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to study structural changes in frontal gray and white matter volume during the transition from <b>late</b> childhood to <b>adolescence</b> (age 9 to 17), while taking sex differences and pubertal timing in account. Participants were 76 healthy twin pairs (46 % females). The results showed significant increases in frontal white matter volume and a volume reduction of frontal gray matter throughout <b>late</b> childhood and <b>adolescence.</b> Development of frontal regions appears to occur more rapidly from early adolescence to middle adolescence (ages 12 to 17) than from childhood to early adolescence (ages 9 to 12). Sex differences were found for structural development of frontal gray and white matter. Boys showed more increase of white matter volume throughout <b>late</b> childhood and <b>adolescence,</b> while girls showed more reduction of gray matter volume during this time. There was limited evidence that stage of puberty predicts brain maturation better than age. The study is unique in comparing volumetric changes of the frontal regions between twee periods and future studies need to replicate these findings...|$|R
25|$|In {{the months}} and years {{following}} the appearance of pubic hair, other areas of skin that respond to androgens may develop androgenic hair. The usual sequence is: underarm (axillary) hair, perianal hair, upper lip hair, sideburn (preauricular) hair, periareolar hair, and the beard area. As with most human biological processes, this specific order may vary among some individuals. Arm, leg, chest, abdominal, and back hair become heavier more gradually. There is a large range in amount of body hair among adult men, and significant differences in timing and quantity of hair growth among different racial groups. Facial hair is often present in <b>late</b> <b>adolescence,</b> but may not appear until significantly later. Facial hair will continue to get coarser, darker and thicker for another 2–4 years after puberty. Some men do not develop full facial hair for up to 10 years {{after the completion of}} puberty. Chest hair may appear during puberty or years after, though not all men develop it.|$|E
25|$|Facial hair {{in males}} {{normally}} {{appears in a}} specific order during puberty: The first facial hair to appear tends to grow {{at the corners of}} the upper lip, typically between 14 and 17 years of age. It then spreads to form a moustache over the entire upper lip. This is followed by the appearance of hair on {{the upper part of the}} cheeks, and the area under the lower lip. The hair eventually spreads to the sides and lower border of the chin, and the rest of the lower face to form a full beard. As with most human biological processes, this specific order may vary among some individuals. Facial hair is often present in <b>late</b> <b>adolescence,</b> around ages 17 and 18, but may not appear until significantly later. Some men do not develop full facial hair for 10 years after puberty. Facial hair continues to get coarser, darker and thicker for another 2–4 years after puberty.|$|E
25|$|More recent {{research}} has also explored writing development. Myhill concentrated {{on the development of}} written language skills in adolescents aged 13 to 15. Myhill discovered that the more mature writer was aware of the shaping of text, and used non-finite clauses, which mirrored Perera's results (1984). Other researchers focused on writing development up until <b>late</b> <b>adolescence,</b> as there has been a limited research in this area. Chrisite and Derewianke recognize that the survey conducted by Perera (1984) {{is still one of the}} most significant research studies in the writing development field and believe Perera's study is similar to theirs. Chrisite and Derewianke (2010) again propose four phases of writing development. The researchers believe that the process of writing development does not stop when an individual leaves formal education, and again, the researchers highlight that these phases are flexible in their onset. The first phase focuses on spoken language as the main aid for writing development, and the development then takes its course reaching the fourth phase, which continues beyond formal education.|$|E

25|$|Romantic {{relationships}} tend {{to increase}} in prevalence throughout adolescence. By age 15, 53% of adolescents have had a romantic relationship that lasted at least one month {{over the course of}} the previous 18 months. In a 2008 study conducted by YouGov for Channel 4, 20% of 14−17-year-olds surveyed revealed that they had their first sexual experience at 13 or under in the United Kingdom. A 2002 American study found that those aged 15–44 reported that the average age of first sexual intercourse was 17.0 for males and 17.3 for females. The typical duration of relationships increases throughout the teenage years as well. This constant increase in the likelihood of a long-term relationship can be explained by sexual maturation and the development of cognitive skills necessary to maintain a romantic bond (e.g. caregiving, appropriate attachment), although these skills are not strongly developed until <b>late</b> <b>adolescence.</b> Long-term relationships allow adolescents to gain the skills necessary for high-quality relationships later in life and develop feelings of self-worth. Overall, positive romantic relationships among adolescents can result in long-term benefits. High-quality romantic relationships are associated with higher commitment in early adulthood and are positively associated with self-esteem, self-confidence, and social competence. For example, an adolescent with positive self-confidence is likely to consider themselves a more successful partner, whereas negative experiences may lead to low confidence as a romantic partner. Adolescents often date within their demographic in regards to race, ethnicity, popularity, and physical attractiveness. However, there are traits in which certain individuals, particularly adolescent girls, seek diversity. While most adolescents date people approximately their own age, boys typically date partners the same age or younger; girls typically date partners the same age or older.|$|E

To minimize the developmental disruption associated with schizophrenia, much work has recently been done to identify and treat the prodromal (pre-onset) phase of the illness, which has been detected up to 30months before the onset of symptoms. Those who go on to develop schizophrenia may experience transient or self-limiting psychotic symptoms and the non-specific symptoms of social withdrawal, irritability, dysphoria, and clumsiness before the onset of the disease. Children who go on to develop schizophrenia may [...] also demonstrate decreased intelligence, decreased motor development (reaching milestones such as walking slowly), isolated play preference, social anxiety, and poor school performance.|$|E
