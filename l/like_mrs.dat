40|$|There is a ∼ 150 km s− 1 {{discrepancy}} between the measured motion of the Local Group of galaxies (LG) {{with respect to the}} CMB and the linear theory prediction based on the gravitational force field of the large scale structure in full-sky redshift surveys. We perform a variety of tests which show that the LG motion cannot be recovered to better than 150 − 200 km s− 1 in amplitude and within a ≈ 10 ◦ in direction. The tests rely on catalogs of mock galaxies identified in the Millennium simulation using semi-analytic galaxy formation models. We compare these results to the Ks = 11. 75 Two-Mass Galaxy Redshift Survey, which provides the deepest, widest and most complete spatial distribution of galaxies available so far. In our analysis we use a new, concise relation for deriving the LG motion and bulk flow from the true distribution of galaxies in redshift space. Our results show that the main source of uncertainty is the small effective depth of surveys <b>like</b> the 2 <b>MRS</b> that prevents a proper sampling of the large scale structure beyond ∼ 100 h− 1 Mpc. Deeper redshift surveys are needed to reach the “convergence scale ” of ≈ 250 h− 1 Mpc in a ΛCDM universe.

It is a first attempt to relate the dependency-based annotation scheme of PDT to a compositional semantics approach <b>like</b> (R) <b>MRS.</b> A mapping algorithm that converts PDT trees to (R) MRS structures is developed, associating (R) MRSs to each node on the dependency tree. Furthermore, composition rules are formulated and the relation between dependency in PDT and semantic heads in (R) MRS is analyzed. It turns out that structure and dependencies, morphological categories and some coreferences can be preserved in the target structures. Moreover, valency and free modifications are distinguished using the valency dictionary of PDT as an additional resource. The validation results show that systematically correct underspecified target representations {{can be obtained by}} a rule-based mapping approach, which is an indicator that (R) MRS is indeed robust in relation to the formal representation of Czech data.

500|$|In the 1970s and 1980s, Austen {{studies was}} {{influenced}} by Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar's seminal The Madwoman in the Attic (1979), which contrasts the [...] "decorous surfaces" [...] with the [...] "explosive anger" [...] of 19th-century female English writers. This work, along with other feminist criticism of Austen, has firmly positioned Austen as a woman writer. Gibler and Gubar suggested that what are usually seen as the unpleasant female characters in the Austen books <b>like</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Norris in Mansfield Park, Lady Catherine de Bourgh in Pride and Prejudice and Mrs. Churchill in Emma were in fact expressions of Austen's anger at a patriarchal society, whom are punished in guilt over her own immodesty in writing novels while her heroines who end up happily married are expressions of Austen's desire to compromise with society. The Gilbert-Gubar thesis proved to be influential and inspired scholars to reexamine Austen's through most have a more favorable opinion of her heroines than Gilbert and Gubar did., Other scholars such as Linda Hunt have argued that Austen used realism {{as a way of}} attacking patriarchy from the outside as opposed to subverting it from within by irony as Gilbert and Gubar claimed. The interest generated in Austen by these critics led to the discovery and study of other woman writers of the time. Moreover, with the publication of Julia Prewitt Brown's Jane Austen's Novels: Social Change and Literary Form (1979), Margaret Kirkham's Jane Austen: Feminism and Fiction (1983), and Claudia L. Johnson's Jane Austen: Women, Politics and the Novel (1988), scholars were no longer able to easily argue that Austen was [...] "apolitical, or even unqualifiedly 'conservative'". Kirkham, for example, described the similarities between Austen's thought and that of Mary Wollstonecraft, labelling them both as [...] "Enlightenment feminists". Kirham argued that by showing women were just as capable of being rational as men that Austen was a follower of Wollstonecraft. Johnson similarly places Austen in an 18th-century political tradition, although she outlines the debt Austen owes to the political novels of the 1790s written by women.|$|E

30|$|The whole-body imaging aims {{to screen}} {{through the entire}} body for {{acquiring}} the various information across the 3 -D body. Employment of this hybrid modality could enhance the image features with high spatial and time resolution. This could be either obtained with sequential or simultaneous imaging modality. Although, the sequential system fails to provide high temporal resolution, the designing {{of the system is}} quite simpler. Besides, it provides a potential clinical application for multi-purpose imaging such as MRI Attenuation Correction(MRIAC), which is adopted by GE Healthcare (Veit-Haibach et al. 2013). This system employs same couch for both the modality such that MRIAC could be taken with or without MRI coils. If it was taken with MRI, the coil must be taken off prior to the PET imaging. The first commercially available sequential human PET/MRI system is that adopted by Philips Healthcare, which comprises of 3  T whole body MRI and PET satisfying TOF application (Griesmer et al. 2010). The couch could be of sliding type to enable whole body imaging with less scanning time, although most of the electronics of PET is placed external to that of MRI. Thus, it keeps away from RF interference and fringing effect. Also, this could be advantageous to reduce the loss of gain in PMT with the reduction of supply power from 1500  V to DC voltage of 900.Whereas, the simultaneous acquisition modality for whole body imaging consists of the PET detector with annular rings of 56 block detectors and 3  T whole body MRI (Delso et al. 2011). Thereby, it makes the system unfit for TOF application. It has the dimensions of 4 x 4 x 20 mm in an array of 3 [*]×[*] 3 providing a temporal resolution of 2.93  ns. The simultaneous imaging puts up an upper limit to fit the ring diameter of trans-axial FOV 59.4  cm within the bore of the MRI subsystem.

40|$|Background Okhaldhunga Community Hospital (OCH) {{lies in a}} {{rural area}} in the east of Nepal. In this area there is no {{reliable}} power supply so it is still not possible for this hospital to use a computer based medical record system (<b>MRS)</b> <b>like</b> we do in most western hospitals today. Therefore they have developed their own system, where the patients themselves are responsible for taking care of their own medical record (MR) and bringing it at their next visit to the hospital. We wanted to look at how this medical record system at OCH works today. Method We chose to use a dual strategy to achieve this goal, a quantitative and a qualitative design. In the quantitative part, we developed a questionnaire concerning the MRS and analyzed factors we assumed could influence the patients’ compliance in bringing their medical record to the hospital. We hired one of the staff at OCH to interview all the patients coming to the hospital for three different months: January 2010, April 2010 and October 2010. In the qualitative part we did 10 semi-structured interviews with patients at the hospital. To analyze the interviews, we used the principles of systematic text condensation as modified by Malterud. Main Results Most of the patients bring their own Medical Record (MR) to the hospital (89, 7 %). Factors increasing this compliance are short travel time to the hospital, many previous visits and short time since last visit. The patients state that the main reason to bring the MR is to get the consultation cheaper. The patients with less education, the patients that have been to the hospital several times before and patients that have visited the hospital a short time ago are significantly more concerned about the price of the consultation. The patients keep their MR at a safe place in their homes together with other important documents. They have a lack of knowledge concerning the content of the MR, and they {{want to know more about}} the content. Conclusions OCH has a MRS that challenges our regular way of thinking about MRs due to the fact that they give the patients the full responsibility to take care of their own MR. The study reveals that the MRS has a high functionality concerning the compliance of the patients in bringing their MR to the hospital and it seems like the main motivation for bringing the MR to OCH is to get the consultation cheaper. The study also reveals a lack of knowledge concerning the content of the patients` own MR, and that they hunger for more information. This result may indicate that by giving the patients easy access to their own MR, it could make the patients more concerned about their own health situation...|$|R

40|$|Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere {{interactions}} {{are difficult to}} predict {{because they are the}} combination of many hydrological, biological and atmospheric processes. It results in an interface composed of imbricate soil, vegetation and atmospheric layers and not only a simple superposition of these layers. Therefore, it is necessary to study the compartments all together to understand the hydrological behaviour of a watershed. More over lateral variability in each water compartments add to the complexity of natural landscapes. To address this complexity, we have instrumented in the framework of the AMMA-CATCH experiment, a 12 km 2 watershed situated in a rocky context in north Benin. It {{is part of a larger}} hydrological device to understand the water cycle in West Africa and the feedback of the continental surface on the monsoon system. The Ara watershed has been instrumented with several ground stations to monitor the water table, the vadose zone, the precipitations and the river discharge. We also implement instrumentation that gives aggregated characteristics such as geophysical prospecting methods. Electromagnetic and MRS (magnetic resonance sounding) have been used to characterize the hydrodynamic ground properties. Also, a Large Aperture Scintillometer together with a flux station are installed on a 2. 4 km transect over the catchments,from which are measured aggregated sensible and latent heat flux at a km 2 scale. At catchments scale, it has been shown from water table level and scintillometry measurements that the AET (Actual Evapo-Transpiration) regime lasts the entire dry period from November till the next wet season in June. As no runoff is observed during this period, a simple pattern is considered and consists in a direct link between water table and transpiration. However we first can’t conclude on the average porosity necessary to drain the water table through transpiration because it varies during the season. In this study, a detailed footprint analysis is carried out together with a MRS drainage porosity characterisation within the same area. These combined information are then used to explain the AET time series in agreement with water table drainage. Methods involved <b>like</b> scintillometry and <b>MRS,</b> have been implemented on the same experiment field for the first time. They will be first rapidly summarized. In particular a fine scale geological and drainage porosity maps have been obtained from an electrical conductivity prospection of the regolith measured with electromagnetic EM 34 equipment and MRS measurements. Then, the study will focus on AET time series during the dry seasons 2006 and 2008 derived from scintillometry observations. When the wind shifts from Harmatan (north-east) to monsoon (south-west), it allows to differentiate AET regimes from different vegetation and geological context.
