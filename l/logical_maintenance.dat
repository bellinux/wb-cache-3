40|$|The current {{aircraft}} maintenance philosophy, {{referred to as}} scheduled maintenance, follows a preventative strategy in which maintenance tasks are carried out at predetermined intervals or according to prescribed criteria related to safety, operational and economic aspects. Emerging technologies, such as Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), are proposed by airframe manufacturers to reduce long-term maintenance cost and increase aircraft availability. It introduces a timely and automatic diagnostic and prognostic capability which may bring substantial changes to the current maintenance philosophy. This study investigates an integrated approach of scheduled maintenance and SHM by suggestion various <b>logical</b> <b>maintenance</b> procedures. A probabilistic model is established {{to examine the effects}} of the SHM synchronization with scheduled maintenance and the impact on both safety and economy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This minor {{dissertation}} {{is focused}} on reviewing the reliability of an engineering section on a mine. The study arises as the mining industry faces great pressure to meet and surpass their production targets. The reliability of an engineering section on a mine significantly contributes towards increasing mining availability hence allowing for mineral ore targets to be met. This minor dissertation explored the following concepts:  <b>Logical</b> <b>maintenance</b> approaches i. e. structured maintenance plans, maintenance approaches such as preventative, corrective and condition-based monitoring and control and monitoring techniques.  Relevant reliability concepts i. e. Root Cause Analysis, Total Productive Maintenance, Total Quality Management, Lean Maintenance and Reliability Centred Maintenance.  Reliability supporting factors that influences reliability decisions i. e. Life Cycle Cost Analysis, Training and Change Management. Finally, a case study was utilised to review the maintenance approaches, reliability concepts and supporting reliability factors that a mine is currently utilising. M. Ing.

40|$|Multicast {{applications}} for large-scale Mobile Ad hoc NETworks (MANETs) require an {{efficient and effective}} Quality of Service (QoS) -aware multicast model. The new requirements to guarantee QoS are high availability and good load balancing due to limited bandwidth and transmission power of Mobile Nodes (MNs). We propose a logical Hypercube-based Virtual Dynamic Backbone (HVDB) model for QoS-aware multicast communications. In this model, high fault tolerance and small diameter of hypercubes are the basis for high availability, and regularity and symmetry of hypercubes contribute to good load balancing. Based on this model, we design proactive local <b>logical</b> route <b>maintenance,</b> summary-based membership update, and logical location-based multicast routing algorithms in large-scale MANETs. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{solution}} to delivering multicast data reliably not only to/from fixed hosts but also to/from mobile hosts in combined fixed/mobile IP networks, {{particularly with regard to}} the per-source shortest path multicast routing protocol and remote subscription option in IETF mobile IP multicast standard. We propose exploiting tree-based error recovery, well-established concept for reliable multicast in fixed networks, where a hierarchical logical tree of a source and receivers is constructed over which the responsibility of error recovery is distributed. We introduce a new entity named ARMM (Agent for Reliable Mobile Multicast) located at each cell of wireless/mobile networks. Each ARMM participates in a logical tree as a parent of mobile hosts in the corresponding cell. It is responsible for retransmission and requesting for retransmission on behalf of the mobile hosts. With aid of ARMM, the proposed scheme features (1) adaptive reconstruction of logical trees due to host mobility, (2) retransmission to mobile hosts via optimal routes, (3) abstracting a group of mobile hosts into a single ARMM (and thus reducing <b>logical</b> tree <b>maintenance</b> overhead), (4) efficient use of wireless bandwidth for retransmission, and (5) low processing burden on mobile hosts themselves. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme provides higher scalability than a scheme applying a generalized tree-based reliable multicast in mobile environments. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} of this project {{is to create an}} {{informative}} system based on metadata level due to the research done on existing sites in Lithuania, which has shown that those sites don‘t have some functional possibilities: they are difficult to manage, loading data is complicated, redesigning is expensive and hard, slow operation, high financial <b>maintenance.</b> <b>Logical</b> site architecture has been designed as well as the model of system behaviour (using diagrams of sequences), scheme of relative data base, model of system testing and meta-base level. System model has been tested, maintenance and user‘s instruction documents have been prepared, any logical and other mistakes have been corrected. This site ‚The dwelling site‘lets easily change the structure of data and widen it, it has become more convenient to change user‘s possibilities and load new data and use the site itself. The data is quicker to reach because of the metadata level. It is also easier for site administrator to redesign the whole site for the different purpose when the range of information changes. When managing of content is easy to maintain it is also easier for a less experienced administrator to look after the site, because the logic of site operation is separated from data being used...|$|R
40|$|Narrative, {{though a}} crucial {{process by which}} we {{interpret}} the meaning of events and communicate with one another, has come under increasing criticism as to its merit {{as a mode of}} argumentative proof. This project situates itself by contrasting Walter Fisher 2 ̆ 7 s proposal that narrative is the fundamental human communicative paradigm with Nassim Taleb 2 ̆ 7 s rejection of narrative as an analytical tool. It is my contention that because narrative is both fundamental as well as flawed the best way to process is to endeavor to improve narrative as a mode of argumentative proof. ^ This project develops a concept of narrative fallacies to maintenance our storytelling capacity to run parallel to the informal <b>logical</b> fallacies that <b>maintenance</b> our rational capacity. Narrative fallacies are patterns of story that appeal to one 2 ̆ 7 s desire as to what stories should be by imposing expectations of fictional stories on historical ones. Such fallacies are further grouped by the certain aspect of a story (e. g. protagonist, climax, economy, denouement etc.) that they emphasize. ^ Drawing on examples from the political arena in which political actors construct and consume stories to foster understanding of their political reality and achieve their persuasive goals, this project proposes a preliminary typography of narrative fallacies. The goal of this typography is to begin a conversation that focuses on how the features of fictional stories come to be expected of stories in the political arena. ^ Finally, this project examines one particular case-study—that of narrative destiny. I propose that narrative destiny imposes the expectation of a strong positive climactic outcome on historical stories and may thus be identified as fallacious. Destiny throughout American history and as a pattern of life-story is considered, and the case of Newt Gingrich 2 ̆ 7 s 2012 political campaign in particular is used {{as an example of how}} the concept of narrative fallacious can be applied in the field. ...|$|R
