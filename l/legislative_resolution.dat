5000|$|Merkley went on {{to dismiss}} the criticism, {{pointing}} out that <b>Legislative</b> <b>resolutions</b> carry no force of law and are only statements of principle, that a legislator could freely pick and choose which parts of the resolution to support, and that he made clear that [...] "you stand up and clarify what parts you're supporting and what parts you're opposed to and I did that more clearly than any member {{on the floor of}} the House." ...|$|R

25|$|Southern sympathizers {{were outraged}} at the legislature's decisions, citing that Polk's troops in Kentucky were only {{en route to}} counter Grant's forces. Later <b>legislative</b> <b>resolutions</b> passed by Unionists—such as {{inviting}} Union General Robert Anderson to enroll volunteers to expel the Confederate forces, requesting the governor to call out the militia, and appointing Union General Thomas L. Crittenden in command of Kentucky forces—incensed the Southerners. (Magoffin vetoed the resolutions but was overridden each time.) In 1862, the legislature passed an act to disenfranchise citizens who enlisted in the Confederate States Army. Thus Kentucky's neutral status evolved into backing the Union. Most of those who originally sought neutrality turned to the Union cause.|$|R

40|$|The Article first {{explains}} the basic {{requirements of the}} Regulatory Flexibility Act, and in particular focuses on the periodic review requirement contained in Section 610. It traces the history of Presidential efforts through the promulgation of executive orders to delay the implementation of regulations and require agencies to consult with regulated industries. Reviewing agency action from 1997 - 2005 following Section 610 review, it found agencies are confused as to when review is necessary, and, though Section 610 is meant to decrease the regulatory burden on small business, agencies often increase the regulatory burden on small business. It concludes the key problem regarding Section 610 agency is the very low review rate, and provides several <b>legislative</b> <b>resolutions</b> meant to compel agency review and greater small business participation in regulatory decision-making...|$|R
5000|$|In 1765, the British {{government}} {{needed money}} {{to afford the}} 10,000 officers and soldiers living in the colonies, and intended that the colonists living there should contribute. The British passed a series of taxes aimed at the colonists, {{and many of the}} colonists refused to pay certain taxes; they argued that they should not be held accountable for taxes which were decided upon without any form of their consent through a representative. This became commonly known as [...] "No Taxation without Representation." [...] Parliament insisted on its right to rule the colonies {{despite the fact that the}} colonists had no representative in Parliament. The most incendiary tax was the Stamp Act of 1765, which caused a firestorm of opposition through <b>legislative</b> <b>resolutions</b> (starting in the colony of Virginia), public demonstrations, threats, and occasional hurtful losses.|$|R

40|$|First Published October 23, 2015 EU {{legislative}} decision-making {{is increasingly}} shifted into informal secluded arenas. Scholars have explained this trend and analysed its consequences for bargaining success and democratic legitimacy. Yet, we {{know little about}} how informalisation affects legislative behaviour in the EP. This article contributes to closing the gap, by theorising and analysing the impact of ‘early agreements’ on cohesion. Given the reputational, political and transaction costs of failing an early agreement in plenary, we expect political groups to invest heavily in discipline and consensus, and legislators to comply in votes. Using a new dataset, combining Hix et al. ’s roll-call data with original codecision data (1999 - 2011), we show that informalisation increases cohesion but only for centrist parties. Rapporteurships and votes on ‘costly’ <b>legislative</b> <b>resolutions</b> also matter, but do not mediate the effect of early agreement...|$|R
40|$|Elections {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} features of the democratic process which constitutes the sign post of democracy. It grants people a government and the government has constitutional right to govern those who elect it. Elections provide an opportunity to the people to express their faith in the government from time to time and change it when the need arises. Elections symbolize the sovereignty of the people and provide legitimacy to the authority of the government. Thus, free and fair elections are indispensable for the success of democracy. In a democratic country like India, people have the real power and choice to elect their representatives. By this only the real welfare state will arise. Because now-a-days people all over the world want welfare state only. The present paper focuses on the importance of electoral reforms and <b>legislative</b> <b>resolutions</b> in India...|$|R
