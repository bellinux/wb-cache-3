5|$|Joe Shea got up {{and started}} calmly with {{a report on the}} state of the investigation. But within a minute, he was rambling, and in another thirty seconds, he was incoherent. I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> and saw my father, in the grip of {{dementia}} praecox. It was horrifying and fascinating at the same time.|$|E

25|$|Between 1888 and 1890, Narendra visited Vaidyanath in Allahabad. In January 1890 he {{went from}} Allahabad to Ghazipur and met Pavhari Baba, an Advaita Vedanta ascetic who {{spent much of his}} time in meditation. At the time he {{suffered}} from lumbago, and it was becoming impossible for him to move or sit in meditation. After meeting Baba, Narendra wanted to become his disciple and Baba asked him to stay a few more days at Ghazipur. However, the night before his initiation Narendra had a dream in which Ramakrishna <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with a melancholy face. This dream convinced Narendra that no one other than Ramakrishna could be his teacher, and he abandoned the idea of becoming Baba's disciple.|$|E

25|$|Cline's privately {{published}} work Hope for high risk and rage filled children also cites family therapist and hypnotherapist Milton Erickson as a source, and reprints {{parts of a}} case of Erickson's published in 1961. The report describes {{the case of a}} divorced mother with a non-compliant son. Erickson advised the mother to sit on the child {{for hours at a time}} and to feed him only on cold oatmeal while she and a daughter ate appetizing food. The child did increase in compliance, and Erickson noted, with apparent approval, that he trembled when his mother <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> Cline commented, with respect to this and other cases, that in his opinion all bonds were trauma bonds. According to Cline, it illustrates the three essential components of 1) taking control, 2) the child's expression of rage; and, 3) relaxation and the development of bonding.|$|E
25|$|The Dalai Lama had {{a strong}} {{following}} as many people from Tibet <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> as their leader from not just a political point of view but, also from a spiritual prospective. After the Dalai Lama's government fled to Dharamsala, India, during the 1959 Tibetan Rebellion, it established a rival government-in-exile. Afterwards, the Central People's Government in Beijing renounced the agreement and began implementation of the halted social and political reforms. During the Great Leap Forward, between 200,000 and 1,000,000 Tibetans died, and approximately 6,000 monasteries were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution, thus {{the vast majority of}} historic Tibetan architecture was destroyed. In 1962 China and India fought a brief war over the disputed South Tibet and Aksai Chin regions. Although China won the war, Chinese troops withdrew north of the McMahon Line, effectively ceding South Tibet to India.|$|E
25|$|McVeigh's accomplice, Terry Nichols, {{was convicted}} and sentenced in federal court {{to life in prison}} {{for his role in the}} crime. At Nichols' trial, {{evidence}} was presented indicating that others may have been involved. Several residents of central Kansas, including real estate agent Georgia Rucker and a retired Army NCO, testified at Terry Nichols' federal trial that they had seen two trucks at Geary Lake State Park, where prosecutors alleged the bomb was assembled. The retired NCO said he visited the lake on April 18, 1995, but left after a group of surly men <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> aggressively. The operator of the Dreamland Motel testified that two Ryder trucks had been parked outside her Grandview Plaza motel where McVeigh stayed in Room 26 the weekend before the bombing. Terry Nichols is incarcerated at ADX Florence in Florence, Colorado.|$|E

Rabbit Butler was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in that nasty way. This was an {{occasion}} where manly frankness was the quality most to be aimed at. To be misunderstood in the circles in which Mr. Buffin moved meant something more than the mere risk of being treated with cold displeasure.|$|R

25|$|Included in that haul {{was one of}} {{the most}} famous caughts-and-bowled ever taken. Ulyett sent down a {{straight}} half-volley to Bonnor, who drove at it with all his considerable might and got it right out of the middle of the bat. The ball flew back towards the bowler with a resounding crack. It seemed to Ulyett barely to have left his hand—yet already it was flying back to him at what seemed like the speed of light. He had no time to judge it but held out the right hand instinctively, and the leather stuck, right in the middle of his palm. With the sound of Bonnor's stroke still echoing about the ground, many eyes in the gallery were looking for the area near the boundary where they thought that the ball would land. The eyes of George Giffen, the non-striker, were among the wanderers, and he was certain that everyone else must be looking for it, too: indeed, a segment of the crowd, in panic, had even opened up a space in the ring in anticipation of the ball’s descent. Giffen reckoned it to have been a very mighty drive indeed—but he could not see where it had gone. When, finally, his and other eyes were diverted back towards the pitch, they noticed Ulyett celebrating and Bonnor was departing. It soon dawned on them that Ulyett had taken the catch. Although Ulyett felt no pain in the centre of his hand, there was definitely a fair amount of it on the outside. Bonnor <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> disgustedly, thinking it almost immoral to have done such a thing, and he walked off gloomily. The England players gathered around Ulyett in wonderment. They seemed to the Wisden correspondent to be curious as to what kind of man this was—although they were also keen to congratulate him on his evasion of impending danger. The looks on the faces of Allan Steel and Alfred Lyttelton would stay with Wisdens man for a long time. WG Grace and Lord Harris both told Ulyett that he was foolish to have attempted to take the catch: had it hit his wrist or arm instead, that bone would surely have snapped. Giffen believed that this {{was one of the}} finest catches that he had ever seen, and, although on the team which it had adversely affected, he definitely appreciated it.|$|E
500|$|One {{example of}} his dogged pursuit of {{excellence}} is that while in high school, Scheyer refused to leave the gym one night until he made 50 consecutive free throws. [...] After finally hitting 49 in a row, he missed on his final attempt. [...] His father encouraged him to join him and go home, but – as his coach recalled – “Jon <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> and said, ‘No. I’m starting over.’ Then he stayed until he made 50 in a row.” ...|$|E
500|$|Former Disney {{chairman}} Jeffrey Katzenberg {{had always}} wanted to do an animated adaptation of The Ten Commandments. While working for The Walt Disney Company, Katzenberg suggested this idea to Michael Eisner, but he refused. The idea for the film was brought back at the formation of DreamWorks SKG in 1994, when Katzenberg's partners, Amblin Entertainment founder Steven Spielberg, and music producer David Geffen, were meeting in Spielberg's living room. Katzenberg recalls that Spielberg <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> during the meeting and said, [...] "You ought to do The Ten Commandments." ...|$|E

During a staff meeting, when Chief Technology Officer Aneesh Chopra gave uniformly upbeat reports, Emanuel {{is said to have}} <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> and said: [...] "Whatever you're taking, I want some." [...] Emanuel had a hand in war strategy, {{political}} maneuvering, communications and economic policy. Bob Woodward wrote in Obama's Wars that Emanuel made a habit of telephoning CIA Director Leon Panetta and asking about the lethal drone strikes aimed at Al Qaeda, asking [...] "Who did we get today?" ...|$|E
500|$|When he {{graduated}} from high school in 1997, Youkilis weighed about 227 pounds and was 6' 1". He was recruited by two Division I schools: Butler University and his ultimate choice, the University of Cincinnati (UC)—an institution that was the alma mater of both his father and Youkilis' longtime idol, Sandy Koufax, and had just finished a 12–46 season. UC coach Brian Cleary spotted Youkilis at a winter camp. [...] "I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> and said, Well, we need somebody", said Cleary. [...] "I'd love to tell you I saw something no one else did, but he was just better than what we had." ...|$|E

"Padre Pio {{looked at}} Lefebvre very sternly and said: [...] "Never cause discord among your {{brothers}} and always practise {{the rule of}} obedience; above all when it seems {{to you that the}} errors of those in authority are all the more serious. There is no other road than that of obedience, especially {{for those of us who}} have made this vow."... It seems Archbishop Lefebvre did not see things in quite the same way even if he did respond to Padre Pio with: [...] "I will remember that, Father." [...] Padre Pio <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> intensely and, seeing what would soon happen, said: [...] "No! You will forget it! You will tear apart the community of faithful, oppose the will of your superiors and even go against the orders of the pope himself and this will happen quite soon..." ...|$|E

Neither F-15 pilot had been informed that U.S. Army Black Hawks participating in OPC often carried auxiliary fuel tanks mounted on wings nor had either been instructed in the paint scheme that Iraqi Hind helicopters used, light brown and desert tan, which was different from the dark green color used by the Black Hawks. Wickson later stated that, [...] "I had no doubt when I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> that he was a Hind[...] [...] [...] The Black Hawk did not even cross my mind." ...|$|E
500|$|Johnson's {{tall and}} robust figure {{combined}} with his odd gestures were confusing to some; when William Hogarth first saw Johnson standing near {{a window in}} Samuel Richardson's house, [...] "shaking his head and rolling himself about in a strange ridiculous manner", Hogarth thought Johnson an [...] "ideot, whom his relations had put {{under the care of}} Mr. Richardson". Hogarth was quite surprised when [...] "this figure stalked forwards to where he and Mr. Richardson were sitting and all at once took up the argument... such a power of eloquence, that Hogarth <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with astonishment, and actually imagined that this ideot had been at the moment inspired". Beyond appearance, Adam Smith claimed that [...] "Johnson knew more books than any man alive", while Edmund Burke thought that if Johnson were to join Parliament, he [...] "certainly would have been the greatest speaker that ever was there". Johnson relied on a unique form of rhetoric, and he is well known for his [...] "refutation" [...] of Bishop Berkeley's immaterialism, his claim that matter did not actually exist but only seemed to exist: during a conversation with Boswell, Johnson powerfully stomped a nearby stone and proclaimed of Berkeley's theory, [...] "I refute it thus!" ...|$|E
