40|$|In the {{literature}} on the evolution of farming systems in Sub-Saharan Africa, the food versus cash debate on the competition versus complementarity between food and export crops (such as cotton) in agricultural development seems to offer contrasting views on rural development. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to revisit these schools of thought through an empirical case study in northern Côte d’Ivoire. Farming systems are distinguished through the presence of cotton and the degree of intensification and mechanization. Non-mechanized cotton systems are severely constrained by <b>labour</b> <b>bottlenecks</b> during field preparation of cotton fields due to competition with food crops and are barely able to subsist. Mechanization, as part of the cotton program, enables cotton farms to spread labour peaks and dramatically increase cropped areas. Our findings suggest that both development theories in reality coexist rather than contrast and that neither of both simultaneously applies on all farming systems. farming systems, adoption, cotton, animal traction, Côte d’Ivoire...|$|R
40|$|The inland {{valleys of}} the humid forest ecology show {{considerable}} potential for double rice crop production {{because of a}} longer rainfall regime; {{but this is not}} commonly practised. The question as to wether the magnitude of farm income from a second rice crop would lead to its adoption was evaluated. Data was obtained between March and August 1999 from farmers fields and from an on-farm late trial with improved inputs between September and December 1999 in the Ozu Abam inland valley near Bende in South eastern Nigeria. Results indicate that a second rice crop within the year will improve farmer income by 74 percent. Labour costs will reduce by nine percent while capital operating costs will double with the use of improved inputs. However <b>labour</b> <b>bottlenecks</b> due to competition with upland crops, absence of mechanised dryers, power tillers and storage facilities may limit the adoption of double rice cropping.

40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{analyses}} {{the local}} incidence across England of migration {{flows from the}} eight Accession (A 8) countries of east and central Europe immediately following the 2004 expansion of the European Union. It examines not only the total inflow of A 8 migrants but also the three largest nationality groups, as well as three large groups defined {{by the type of}} job they gained. The distributions of these migrant groups are related to labour market conditions to see how far migrants were attracted to areas with tight labour supply. Migrant group distributions are modelled to take into account other potential drivers such as the patterns of earlier migrant populations. Datasets on the A 8 migrants have limitations, and these are noted because policy development may be hindered as a result. Recent pronouncements from the British Government have stressed that immigrants make substantial contributions to the national economy, not least in the form of additional labour supply for tight labour markets (e. g. Home Office, 2005). This paper seeks to move the debate forward by looking at the local distribution across England of one recently very important international contribution to Britain’s labour supply. The aim is to establish how far this migrant stream went to tighter labour markets, as is implied by the view that such migrants help solve <b>labour</b> <b>bottlenecks...</b>|$|R

40|$|Process {{management}} and innovation arguably remain among the concepts under focus of recent researches {{since there is}} no significantly outstanding method to measure and monitor the level of innovation in the manufacturing processes over a particular time period taking the fundamental activities of manufacturing processes into account. Although there are various studies relevant to process improvement, manufacturing processes are not focused on in the literature. This paper presents a novel performance indicator, called degree of process innovation, for monitoring and measuring innovation in manufacturing processes based on the four most important components among the fundamental activities of a manufacturing system. The components are namely Average <b>Labour</b> Utilisation, Cumulative <b>Bottleneck</b> Ratio, Unit Production Time and Unit Production Cost. The idea behind this approach has flourished on the basis of an indicator proposed in the literature to measure the general organisational improvements. The scope of that indicator has been narrowed down to manufacturing processes to accurately reflect the state of the manufacturing processes. The proposed approach has been verified with a case study in manufacturing industry, where each of the four sub-indicators was calculated based on the data provided and aggregated into the degree of process innovation.

40|$|Euro-Mediterranean Consortium for Applied Research on International Migration (CARIM) Migration {{policy is}} one of the fields least {{scrutinized}} in the Arab world. Responding to international economic trends, policy makers, social partners, and civil society players in Jordan and Lebanon have come to the realization that certain <b>labour</b> market <b>bottlenecks</b> can only be overcome by bringing in foreign workers. This has led to a significant immigration of laborers {{from a wide variety of}} countries and forced all relevant participants in the policy making process to renew their interest in coordinated temporary labour migration schemes. Both in Jordan and Lebanon, experts and policy makers alike see opportunities in these schemes that can help them meet the changing demands in their labour markets without permanently adding to their populations and labour forces. In the countries of origin, reciprocally, temporary labour migration schemes are intended to allow governments to alleviate pressures on their labour markets in the short and medium-term, and also let them reap the benefits of migration, through remittances and skill acquisition. In this study the authors will consider, based on a tripartite approach, whether the interests of employers and workers organizations coincide with those of governments in designing and implementing temporary migration schemes. The internationally codified rights of migrant workers to equality and non-discrimination and to their integration into societies and workplaces will be compared to the realities on the ground in Lebanon and Jordan. Have the limited provisions for protecting employees’ rights and a lack of their integration into the host societies negatively affected policy goals, closely linked to social cohesion? Does the effective protection of migrant workers contradict the needs of the indigenous populations in Lebanon and Jordan in general? Can the empowerment of the migrants themselves and their inclusion into the tripartite decision making process facilitate migration policy reform? Which social players can – and have – step in if the state and social partners neglect those roles foreseen for them by the international organizations dealing primarily with migrant labour, first and foremost the International Labour Organization (ILO) ?CARIM is co-financed by the European University Institute and the European Unio...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the potential for}} increased cross-border labour mobility within the EU- 25 and considers {{the costs and benefits}} of any increase in labour mobility to both sending and receiving countries in the medium to long run. Evidence from previous EU enlargement experiences, academic studies, the existence of barriers to mobility within the EU and the economic determinants of migration all indicate a moderate potential for increased migrant flows. The magnitude of cross-border labour flow in the medium to long run will most likely be largely a function of the demand for migrants and the speed at which the EU- 8 catches up economically with the EU- 15. If broad-based economic growth and social development continues in the EU- 8, labour migration will most likely decrease. In addition, faster population ageing in the EU- 8 tends towards dampening migration flow from the new Member States in the medium term. In terms of costs and benefits, for the EU- 8 countries labour migration, especially in the short run, may present a number of challenges. Emigration may tend to weigh disproportionally on the pool of young and educated workers, aggravating <b>labour</b> market <b>bottlenecks</b> in a number of EU- 8 countries. For the EU- 25 as a whole, cross-border labour mobility is likely to offer a number of advantages, by allowing a more efficient matching of workers 2 ̆ 018 skills with job vacancies and facilitating the general upskilling of European workforces. The current restrictions on labour mobility from the EU- 8 countries to the other EU member countries stand in contrast with one of the central principles of the EU 2 ̆ 013 the free movement of labour. Furthermore, these restrictions may decrease the efficient use of labour resources in the face of demographic change and globalisation and hamper an important adjustment mechanism within EMU. Delaying the removal of these barriers may be costly for the EU- 25 at a time when leaders are concerned about Europe 2 ̆ 018 s international competitiveness and may increase illegal work in a number of countries. Finally, it would not be beneficial for Europe to loose a significant part of the most agile and talented individuals from the new Member States to more traditional migration centres such as the US and Canada...|$|R
40|$|In November 2000 the European Commission {{published}} its communication "On a Community Immigration Policy". The Commission's Document identifies {{clearly the}} changing pressures which {{have affected the}} need for a reappraisal of immigration policy. First, the advent of the single market with free movement of labour within the EU requires a common approach to immigration over the EU's external borders. Secondly, the gradual transition from an era of high unemployment into one of tighter labour markets, coupled with demographic change, has been revealing increasing problems of <b>labour</b> market <b>bottlenecks,</b> especially in respect of certain specific skills, requiring more than a national-based competitive bidding for selected immigrants. Thirdly, there has been an increase in asylum-seeking and illegal migration. The particular pressure for a review of EU policy on immigration has come from the situation in Central and Eastern Europe over the past decade, in particular how to accommodate the accession of the first waves of candidate countries into a unified single labour market and how to regulate the anticipated continuing pressure for migration from those countries in the region remaining outside the EU. The enormous increase in migration activity in the early 1990 s, following a long period of stable or falling migration pressure since the 1950 s and early 1960 s, demonstrated both types of migration, genuine pressures for workers to migrate from poor regions to rich regions as part of an increasing integration of the European economy and large flows of population resulting from war and ethnic conflict. Although it is easy to demonstrate that the overall pressure of immigration to the EU {{is not likely to be}} great, there is the problem that such immigration is highly regionally concentrated and this has implications both for the policy as a whole and for regional development within the EU. This paper assess the regional impacts of migration in the context of a model of migration which stresses the limited duration of much migrant activity. It highlights the importance of short-term migration in terms of remittances and productivity gain, but identifies the importance of improving information to reduce the asymmetry which lead to mismatch and hence to reduced welfare in both sending and receiving regions. Particular evidence is drawn from data on migration from Poland, Albania and Bulgaria. The paper concludes that Immigration Policy needs to address mechanisms for identifying migrant flows and preparing for their easy absorption. Rather than trying to set aggregate quotas or optimal transition periods to free movement; this may be most efficiently achieved through use of voucher or auction systems. ...|$|R
