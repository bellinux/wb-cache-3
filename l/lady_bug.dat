Juno First, released by Chris Walton in 2009, borrows the name and design of the 1983 Konami arcade game; and Thrust, released by Thomas Jentzsch in 2000, is a port of a 1986 computer game originally designed for the BBC Micro. Other programmers have implemented Sea Wolf (as Seawolf), Tetris (as Edtris 2600) and Caverns of Mars (as Conquest of Mars).

INTRODUCTION — Organically grown foods are {{foods that are}} grown or processed {{without the use of}} synthetic fertilizers or pesticides [1 - 5]. Organic farmers attempt to protect the environment by using natural matter (eg, aged manure, humus, and compost) for fertilizer and biological methods of pest control (eg, crop rotation and natural insect predators like <b>lady</b> <b>bugs)</b> [2, 4, 6].

50|$|The game {{is set in}} an {{outdoors}} bug environment, in the Bugdom, {{a kingdom}} once ruled by bugs, namely the rollie pollies and ladybugs that was overthrown by a clan of fire ants who captured all of the <b>Lady</b> <b>Bugs</b> and held them as prisoners, leaving their leader, King Thorax, to rule the land. The player visits several colorful locations throughout the kingdom, namely a lawn (levels 1 and 2), a pond (level 3), a forest which resembles a bug's interpretation of a garden (levels 4 and 5), a beehive (levels 6 and 7), a nighttime-themed level (level 8), and an anthill (levels 9 and 10).|$|R
25|$|Several {{natural enemies}} {{can reduce the}} {{population}} of the insects on hosts. Of all the predators, insects seem {{to be the most important}} group. Insects and their larvae such as pyralid moths (order Lepidoptera), which destroy the cactus, and predators such as <b>lady</b> <b>bugs</b> (Coleoptera), various Diptera (such as Syrphidae and Chamaemyiidae), lacewings (Neuroptera), and ants (Hymenoptera) have been identified, as well as numerous parasitic wasps. Many birds, human-commensal rodents (especially rats) and reptiles also prey on cochineal insects. In regions dependent on cochineal production, pest control measures are taken seriously. For small-scale cultivation, manual methods of control have proved to be the safest and most effective. For large-scale cultivation, advanced pest control methods have to be developed, including alternative bioinsecticides or traps with pheromones.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIt is {{well known}} that reaction–diffusion systems {{describing}} Turing models can display very rich pattern formation behavior. Turing systems have been proposed for pattern formation in various biological systems, e. g. patterns in fish, butterflies, <b>lady</b> <b>bugs</b> and etc. A Turing model expresses temporal behavior of the concentrations of two reacting and diffusing chemicals which is represented by coupled reaction–diffusion equations. Since the base of these reaction–diffusion equations arises from the conservation laws, we develop a hybrid finite volume spectral element method for the numerical solution of them and apply the proposed method to Turing system generated by the Schnakenberg model. Also, as numerical simulations, we study the variety of spatio-temporal patterns for various values of diffusion rates in the problem...|$|R
