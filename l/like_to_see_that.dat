25|$|Some U.S. {{retailers}} offer {{opportunities for}} consumer recycling of discarded electronic devices. In the US, the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) urges consumers to dispose properly of end-of-life electronics through its recycling locator at www.GreenerGadgets.org. This list only includes manufacturer and retailer programs {{that use the}} strictest standards and third-party certified recycling locations, to provide consumers assurance that their products will be recycled safely and responsibly. CEA {{research has found that}} 58 percent of consumers know where to take their end-of-life electronics, and the electronics industry would very much <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> level of awareness increase. Consumer electronics manufacturers and retailers sponsor or operate more than 5,000 recycling locations nationwide and have vowed to recycle one billion pounds annually by 2016, a sharp increase from 300 million pounds industry recycled in 2010.|$|E
2500|$|On June 1, 2011, Palin stated her {{opposition}} to the DREAM Act, {{a bill that would}} provide conditional permanent residency to certain illegal and deportable alien students who graduate from U.S. high schools, who are of good moral character, arrived in the U.S. legally or illegally as minors and have been in the country continuously {{for at least five years}} prior to the bill's enactment: [...] "The immigrants in the past, they had to literally and figuratively stand in line and follow rules to become U.S. citizens. I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> continue, but unfortunately, the Dream Act kind of usurps that, the system, that is a legal system, to make sure that immigrants who want to be here legally, working hard, producing and supplying revenue and resources for their family, that they're able to do that right and legally. Unfortunately, the DREAM act doesn't accomplish that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{concerns}} to the contrary, Glasberg denied that Ziva [...] "friend zoned" [...] Tony in the finale. He explained, [...] "It might not satisfy everyone out there, but I think we're getting there — she even reaches {{up with her}} hand and puts it very gently, and in a lovely way, on his shoulder before that kiss happens. I think there are gestures being made that have definitely advanced from where we were a year ago." [...] In response to complaints about {{the pace of the}} development, he said, [...] "There are a lot of fans who would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> story advance much faster than we're doing it, but I firmly believe a little goes a long way and there are ways to tease it and to flirt that are just as significant and just as meaningful." [...] He maintained, [...] "We made huge strides. Their relationship has evolved, has changed. They're a little more open with each other and a little more emotionally connected, certainly more than where we were {{at the beginning of the}} season. [...] may not be the big leap that a lot of people would like it to be, but I also feel like we're enjoying the pace at which this is happening. That's not to say we're not headed in the direction everyone would like to go, but I think we’re getting there. It's very complicated when two agents who are working together get into a relationship, and that's something that [...] would be very conscious of. So I think they would tread lightly, which is why, in theory, we're treading lightly and being very careful about the steps that we take." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What a pity!" [...] she richly wailed. [...] "I {{should have}} <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that.</b> One must <b>see</b> everything--to {{be able to}} do everything." [...] And as he pressed for what in {{particular}} she had wished <b>to</b> <b>see</b> she replied: [...] "The way a woman like that receives one of the old ones." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But if {{you marry}} and settle somewhere, as I hope you will, {{you must have}} {{something}} to begin with, my son. So be prudent and invest your money; don't give it away, for rainy days come to all of us, and dependence {{would be very hard}} for you to bear,' answered Mrs Jo with a sage air, though she <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the money-making fever had not seized her lucky boy yet.|$|R
6000|$|... "I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> glade," [...] said Twinkle, who was {{determined}} to let nothing escape her that she could possibly see.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> Book of Records," [...] mused Cap'n Bill, who didn't {{think the}} {{description}} of the Sunset Country at all dreadful.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> letter Jason Sparr got--saying we were guilty," [...] {{returned}} our hero. [...] "Maybe Doctor Clay can {{get hold}} of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What's {{the good}} of worrying?" [...] he said presently. [...] "I shouldn't if it weren't for my poor old father. It must have come to this one day, and the sooner it is over the sooner to sleep, as the song says. When one comes {{to think of it}} there are {{enormous}} advantages in sleep, for that's the only time one is quite happy. Still, I should have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> Cypripedium first." ...|$|R
50|$|Mr. Mumby is {{the local}} squire at Oak-tree Farm; his sons are Martin and John. Mr. Kiddle is a cattle dealer; his daughters are Phoebe and Anne. Ada Kiddle, the eldest daughter, was taken by Martin and John Mumby one summer under the oak tree on the green, with the {{encouragement}} of Mrs. Vosper, and drowned herself when winter came. Mrs. Vosper, who <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> girls are taken by men under the oak tree, encouraged the same to happen to Phoebe and Anne.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{man who is}} bowling now {{is not up to}} much, sergeant. Suppose {{you take}} the ball for an over or two; I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how <b>that</b> young fellow would stand up to your bowling." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Why, {{that would}} be fun!" [...] {{declared}} Belle. [...] "I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> bear, and get a shot at him, too," [...] went on the girl from Star Ranch.|$|E

5000|$|The Distaff was {{marred by}} {{injuries}} to the two favorites, Fleet Indian and Pine Island. Fleet Indian, who was later named Champion Older Female Horse, suffered a compound fracture in her left front fetlock, which was surgically repaired. Pine Island dislocated her left front ankle {{and had to be}} euthanized because of infection. Long-shot Round Pond won the race comfortably, though the celebration of her connections was muted. [...] "I've been in that situation and nobody ever <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> happen," [...] said her trainer Michael Matz, who had also been the trainer of Barbaro.|$|R
60|$|I {{have just}} {{time to tell}} you under my own hand that I invited Mr. Bear to a dinner of such guests as he would {{naturally}} <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see,</b> and <b>that</b> we took to him very much, and got on with him capitally.|$|R
6000|$|After {{a little}} more consultation, {{it was decided that}} John should write to Dr. Ruthven that his cousin had some papers of his father's which he thought the Doctor might <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see,</b> and <b>that</b> they would bring them if he would make an appointment, ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> parchment," [...] {{said the}} solemn-eyed Prince Inga, [...] "for if it indeed teaches {{one to be}} good it must be worth its weight in pearls." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that,</b> too, Carlos, and the Americans in the flames. Ah, but the {{day when}} we are to take the capital seems {{a long way off}} now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As you are {{interested}} in curiosities, perhaps you may <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> some <b>that</b> I have here in my bag. I am very fond and proud of them, because they are genuine, and have histories of old times attached to them," [...] she said presently.|$|R

6000|$|... "It's {{very good}} of you, damn you!" [...] my visitor laughed, red and really grave. Then he said: [...] "You'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> scoundrel {{publicly}} glorified--perched on the pedestal {{of a great}} complimentary pension?" ...|$|E
60|$|She <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{the alarm}} <b>that</b> {{came over the}} other woman's face. It was richly worth while to scare Caroline Holland like that.|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe," [...] said Lawrence, [...] "that {{my ankle}} is quite strong {{enough for me}} to walk to Aunt Patsy's and back, without sitting down to rest.

6000|$|... "Some of {{the shots}} from this side are sure to fall among them, and if a few are killed and wounded the rest will get angry, and all idea of fraternizing with the men who are firing on them will be at an end.

6000|$|... "I {{was going}} to be very busy," [...] he said, showing an unwillingness. [...] "I have fifty young foals in that meadow there; and I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> they get their suppers served to them warm." ...|$|E

6000|$|... “I {{will put}} them down {{as part of the}} crew of the Furious. I want a few {{specially}} strong and active men for her; her commander is a very dashing officer, and I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> he is well manned.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nothing's the matter, sir. I {{was waiting}} in the court-yard for Miss Dorrit when she came out. I thought you'd <b>like</b> some one <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> she was safe.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pshaw! YOU scared, Silas Lapham?" [...] cried {{his wife}} proudly. [...] "I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the thing <b>that</b> ever scared you; or the {{knockdown}} that YOU couldn't pick up from!" ...|$|R
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, though it's fetishistic and personal, I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> {{think that my}} fetishes aren't that obscure. Who doesn't want <b>to</b> <b>see</b> girls running down the {{trenches}} of World War One wreaking havoc? I'd always {{had an interest in}} those worlds comic books, fantasy art, animated films. I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> this, <b>that's</b> how I approach everything, and then keep pushing it from there.|$|R
