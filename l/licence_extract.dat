50|$|The {{earliest}} document {{which the}} name of Zahara is found is probably the treaty of accommodation between Vejer and Tarifa dated 1444 AD. The settlement was established following the granting of a <b>licence</b> to <b>extract</b> tuna granted to Guzman el Bueno. This privilege still belongs to his descendants, the Dukes of Medina Sidonia, who own the tuna-trap of Zahara.|$|R
5000|$|During {{their time}} extracting water in Chesham, the river Chess ran dry and {{remained}} so until extraction stopped, when within 6 months it {{had returned to}} its former level. This {{was the only time}} that the river has dried up apart from a short time during the drought of 1979. In 2005 Councillor Justine Fulford campaigned to prevent the extension of the <b>licence</b> to <b>extract</b> water, {{on the grounds that it}} was hurting the local environment.|$|R
5000|$|Under Brown, telecom radio {{frequency}} auctions gathered £22.5 {{billion for the}} government. By using a system of sealed bids and only selling a restricted number of <b>licences,</b> they <b>extracted</b> high prices from the telecom operators. Germany at this time applied a similar auction; some allege that these together caused a severe recession in the European telecoms development industry (2001 Telecoms crash) {{with the loss of}} 100,000 jobs across Europe, 30,000 of those in the UK. But, as Paul Klemperer, one of the designers of the auctions, points out, [...] "the United States held no 3G auctions, yet telecoms companies lost just as much: in fact, they lost more." ...|$|R
25|$|Since its {{inception}} as a nuclear facility, Sellafield {{has also been}} host to reprocessing operations, which separate the uranium, plutonium, and fission products from spent nuclear fuel. The uranium can then {{be used in the}} manufacture of new nuclear fuel, or in applications where its density is an asset. The plutonium can be used in the manufacture of mixed oxide fuel (MOX) for thermal reactors, or as fuel for fast breeder reactors, such as the Prototype Fast Reactor at Dounreay. These processes, including the associated cooling ponds, require considerable amounts of water and the <b>licence</b> to <b>extract</b> water from Wast Water, formerly held by BNFL, is now held by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority.|$|R
5000|$|Aubrey's {{relationship}} with Wood {{was to become}} increasingly fraught. Aubrey asked Wood to be [...] "my index expurgatorius": {{a reference to the}} Church's list of banned books, which Wood seems to have taken not as a warning, but as a <b>licence</b> to simply <b>extract</b> pages of notes to paste into his own proofs. In 1692, Aubrey complained bitterly that Wood had mutilated forty pages of his manuscript, perhaps for fear of a libel case. Wood was eventually prosecuted for insinuations against the judicial integrity of the school of Clarendon. One of the two statements called in question was founded on information provided by Aubrey and this may explain the estrangement between the two antiquaries and the ungrateful account that Wood gives of Aubrey's character. It is now famous: [...] "a shiftless person, roving and magotie-headed, and sometimes little better than crased. And being exceedingly credulous, would stuff his many letters sent to A. W. with folliries and misinformations, which would sometimes guid him into the paths of errour".|$|R
40|$|RATIONALE: There is an {{increasing}} demand for studies on indoor allergens, particularly on house dust mite (HDM) allergens, in order to perform basic clinical research and to test anti-allergic drugs under well-controlled conditions. At Fraunhofer ITEM, a novel technique to universally create an atmosphere loaded with allergen particles was recently developed. In brief, aerosol particles of defined size are produced by spray-drying of a solution that contains a <b>licenced</b> allergen <b>extract</b> and lactose as a carrier. The particle size distribution {{is dependent on the}} initial droplet size and the solute lactose concentration aiming to have a particle size above 10 µm. The aim {{of this study was to}} test the safety and efficacy with dose-range finding and reproducibility of this novel HDM challenge in patients with allergic rhinitis in the Fraunhofer Environmental Challenge Chamber (ECC). METHODS: In a monocenter, placebo-controlled, single-blind, pilot study 18 subjects with allergic rhinitis and sensitization to HDM were exposed in the Fraunhofer ECC for 4 hours to house dust mite allergen (ALK lyophilisiert SQ 503 Der p, ALK-Abello, Wedel, Germany) at either 250 SQE/m 3, 500 SQE/m 3, 1000 SQE/m 3, or lactose alone (0 SQE/m 3) seven days apart. The dose of 500 SQE/m 3 was repeated to investigate reproducibility. Total nasal symptom score (TNSS), anterior rhinomanometry, nasal secretions, exhaled NO, FEV 1 and adverse events were assessed prior to and during the exposures. RESULTS: At a lactose concentration of 10 % (w/v) the mass median aerodynamic diameter of allergen particles was 13. 5 µm and only 11 % of particles were < 10 µm. Exposure to HDM increased TNSS (mean±SD) to 3. 4 ± 1. 8, 3. 3 ± 2. 1, and 3. 6 ± 2. 0 at 250 SQE/m 3, 500 SQE/m 3, and 1000 SQE/m 3, respectively, while lactose alone did not change TNSS (0. 7 ± 0. 6). Repeated exposure to 500 SQE/m 3 induced a TNSS of 3. 0 ± 2. 2 which was not different compared to the same previous dose. Objective measures of nasal flow and nasal secretions were in line with clinical symptoms. Exposure to HDM was safe with no relevant change in FEV 1. CONCLUSION: HDM allergen challenge in the Fraunhofer ECC using a novel technique to universally generate allergen atmospheres was safe and specifically induced symptoms in patients with allergic rhinitis. Symptoms were reproducible but no dose-dependency was observed in the tested dose-range. This study provides the methodological basis for further clinical studies using well controlled allergen atmospheres...|$|R
