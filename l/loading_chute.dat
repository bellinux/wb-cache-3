50|$|Another {{distinguishing}} feature of Lake vessels versus Ocean vessels is the cargo hatch configuration. On the Lake vessels, the hatches are traditionally spaced 24 ft apart.

In 1785, the Leeds and Liverpool Canal Company took over the lease of the canal. In 1794, a 240 yd (220m) extension was constructed, to a new loading dock, which was linked to quarries by a tramway. Much of the limestone went to the Low Moor Ironworks in Bradford, where it was used in the smelting of iron. It was also used as road stone, and some of it was burnt to produce lime, for use as a fertiliser and in the production of mortar.|$|R

50|$|In the {{northeast}} and east of England the term staith or staithe (from the Norse for landing stage) is also used. The two terms have historically had a geographical distinction: those to the north in the Kingdom of Northumbria used the Anglo-Saxon spelling of 'staith', southern sites of the Danelaw took the Danish spelling of 'staithe'. Both originally referred to staithes {{in the sense of}} jetties or wharves. In time, the northern coalfields of Northumbria developed coal staiths specifically for loading coal onto ships and these would adopt the 'staith' spelling as a distinction from simple wharves: for example, Dunston Staiths in Gateshead and Brancaster Staithe in Norfolk. However, the term staith may also be used to refer only to <b>loading</b> <b>chutes</b> or ramps used for bulk commodities like coal in loading ships and barges.|$|R

5000|$|Hazard the {{geographer}} and surveyor pioneered a technique which became standardized in the rail transport industry, and indeed, adopted in building many roads and ramps; that of dividing the overall height (the rise) from the starting reference {{point to the}} destination by the distance (or run) - then setting the grade (regardless of excavations needed, or supports needing constructed) {{of the road to}} maintain that average slope. [...] He used the technique when surveying the initial mule road the Lehigh Coal Company used to connect the new settlement and mines at Summit Hill, PA with the <b>loading</b> <b>chute</b> at what would become Mauch Chunk, PA. When the company decided to lay rails along the mule trail, the pre-graded slope allowed the workers to lay rails over the nine mile descent in only a few months of conversion.|$|E
5000|$|A cattle chute (North America) or cattle race (Australia, British Isles and New Zealand) {{also called}} a run or alley, is a narrow {{corridor}} built for cattle, sheep, pigs {{and other animals}} to travel through when being herded from one location to another that is nearby. A conventional race consists of parallel panels or fences with a space between them just wide enough for one animal to pass through comfortably {{without being able to}} turn around, thus forming the animals into a queue that only allows them to go forward. [...] It is used for routine husbandry activities such as drafting (sorting) or loading animals via ramp or <b>loading</b> <b>chute</b> into a vehicle; placing them one at a time in a cattle crush(variations also called a squeeze chute or standing stock)for examination, marking or veterinary treatment.

50|$|The next hurdle {{surprised}} White and Hazard - {{there were}} in general, as was witnessed by the legislator's comments, a wide divergence of opinion {{as to whether the}} Lehigh could be tamed, and perhaps more surprising, there were less backers of any scheme to continue mining coal from the lands held by LCMC - there were simply too many failures over the 24 years of its operations for the peace of mind of many investors. Accordingly, three times the funds were raised to improve the river as were raised to put the mining U delivery of coal onto a regular paying basis. Given permission, the two companies went to work, and overstocked the market demand in 1820, having opened practical, though not ideal navigability of the Lehigh over four years ahead of their targeted 1824. Coal mining and delivery by grading a near constant descent mule track from Summit Hill to feed a <b>loading</b> <b>chute</b> at the huge slack water pool created at Mauch Chunk, went well as well; the coal deposits were essentially outcrops needing little effort to extract. Riding this success, the two companies were merged into the Lehigh Navigation Company, resolved to apply the high tech of the American Canal Era (canals, locks, rails) to bringing coal to their foundries and the stoves and furnaces of Philadelphia and beyond.|$|E

40|$|The use of rock boxes within {{conveyor}} transfers is not new, however, {{there is}} little published in the literature {{to aid in the}} design and implementation of rock boxes; instead mainly relying on prior knowledge and rules-of-thumb. A benefit of a rock box over other transfer types (e. g. soft <b>loading</b> <b>chutes</b> and impact plates) is their ability to capture material {{in such a way that}} it is only the initial feed of material which contacts chute walls or liners, with build-up of material creating a dominance of particle-particle interactions, thus reducing wear of the system and hence cost. This paper presents the preliminary results from an experimental rock box test program using polyethylene pellets, conducted on the variable geometry conveyor transfer research facility at the University of Wollongong. The position of the rock box, along with the belt speed and feed rate of material were varied to obtain a range of visual as well as quantifiable data. This paper also presents a series of discrete element modelling (DEM) simulations designed to predict the very same particle/bulk characteristics seen in the experimental test program in a view to determining whether accurate simulated predictions can be obtained. This simulation work involved the use of calibrated material models to ensure accuracy of all particle-particle and particle-geometry interactions. Initial minor discrepancies between the experimental and simulated results were investigated via input parameter adjustment to determine the root cause of the variations. The final comparisons still show some variation, however, investigations are ongoing...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of more stringent environmental and occupational {{health and safety}} regulations have instigated efforts {{to reduce the amount of}} dust generated during loading of ships with dusty bulk materials. The work presented in this paper demonstrates that to reduce dust emissions during ship loading of dry bulk materials, the material stream exiting the <b>loading</b> <b>chute</b> should be concentrated and at high velocity. This encapsulates the majority of the dust within the stream and buries it within the pile. The chutes that have been designed to achieve this result also keeps the impact angle of the bulk material with the chute low, reducing particle degradation and therefore minimising additional dust generation. Further reductions in dust emissions are possible with the use of a self adjusting flap above the material stream which prevents dust laden air from exiting the spoon chute...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an industrial case study to reduce dust emissions from a grain handling ship loader. The primary {{objective of the}} study was to reduce dust emissions to within acceptable environmental levels during ship loading. Several constraints were imposed on the solution due to time and budgetary restrictions, and the inability to add a dust suppression agent to the grain for quality reasons. A number of alternative <b>loading</b> <b>chute</b> configurations and delivery spoon profiles were examined in a pilot-scale test facility. This paper will discuss a number of alternative solutions which were investigated during the course of the study and the critical parameters of the final design. Tests showed that it was not beneficial to decelerate the product stream to keep the relative velocity of the air stream over the grain below the minimum pickup velocity. Instead, it was found that concentrating the product stream and keeping the product velocity high was more beneficial in reducing dust emissions. A reduction of 50 % in dust emission was achieved through the use of specifically designed constant radius and parabolic profile loading spoons. The product stream exiting the curved spoons was found to be concentrated and stream-lined, resulting in the dust being contained within the product stream...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of more stringent environmental and occupational {{health and safety}} regulations have instigated efforts {{to reduce the amount of}} dust generated during loading of ships with dusty bulk materials. An initial study was undertaken to investigate possible methods to reduce dust emissions from wheat loading operations at the Port of Newcastle. Details of this study are contained in an industrial report by Krull [I] and articles by Wheeler et al. [2, 31. In summary, a number of alternative <b>loading</b> <b>chute</b> configurations and delivery chute profiles were examined in a pilot-scale test facility, which showed that it was not beneficial to decelerate the product stream in an effort to keep the relative velocity of the air stream over the grain below the minimum pickup velocity. Instead, it was found that concentrating the product stream and keeping the product velocity high was more beneficial in reducing dust emissions. Experimental results showed a 50 % dust reduction was possible and was subsequently achieved at the grain loading terminal. Further studies have since been conducted for Finders Ports in Port Adelaide, Australia to examine if the same approach could be used for loading ilmenite onto ships. Experimental results conducted in the pilot-scale test facility using the same chute configuration as used for wheat indicate a potential dust reduction of approximately 80 %. For both the investigated ship loading operations, similar constraints on the implementation of dust reducing methods were imposed as follows: Required modifications to the ship loaders must be undertaken in a short period of time and if possible not involve any significant structural work to the ship loader. Ability to retrofit to the existing booms of the ship loaders. Existing filling levels of ships were to be maintained and the ship loader must be able to load grain underneath the decking on the ship's cargo hold. Due to strict export quality requirements no additives, including water, were to be used as dust suppression agents...|$|E
50|$|Dunston is {{particularly}} known for wooden coal staiths, first opened in 1893 as a structure for loading coal from the North Durham coalfield onto ships. In the 1920s, 140,000 tons of coal per week were loaded from the staiths, and {{they continued to}} be used until the 1970s. They were also a shipping point for coke produced at the nearby Norwood Coke Works, as well as pencil pitch manufactured at the Thomas Ness Tar Works using by-products from the Norwood plant and the Redheugh Gasworks. Throughout their working life, motive power for shunting wagons on the staiths and in their extensive sidings known as the Norwood Coal Yard {{came in the form}} of locomotives from Gateshead MPD. The staiths' output gradually declined with the contraction of the coal industry, and they were finally closed and partially dismantled in 1980. Now redundant, the railway lines leading to the staiths were lifted, finally allowing the demolition of several low bridges that had become a nuisance to bus operators by limiting the routes available to double-deckers in the area. For many years, the men who worked on the staiths, known as teemers (the men who released the coal from the wagons and operated the <b>loading</b> <b>chutes</b> and conveyors) and trimmers (who had the dangerous job of ensuring the stability of the colliers by levelling the load in their holds as they were filled), had their own room in the nearby Dunston Excelsior Club. For anyone not employed in the club or on the staiths, access to the room was strictly by invite only, and the staithesmen held a reputation for unceremoniously ejecting anyone who fell foul of this rule.|$|R

Where prevailing weather conditions permitted, shippers built wharves allowing the ships to come alongside and load directly from the dock. The wire chutes permitted ships with deeper drafts to load since they did not need to approach so close to shore. The wires continued in use until after World War I and were discontinued by the start of World War II.|$|R

40|$|While {{studying}} environmental art, I reflected upon my {{own experiences}} {{related to the}} environment and its impact upon me. Largely, these experiences were gained while growing up on our family farm in Iowa, where the environment {{played an important role in}} life. The works produced during that study, related directly to those experiences. Some of the topics explored at that time pertained to: earth, erosion, and sedimentation; sights and smells of crops; and wind sounds. Initially, I felt some reticence in creating work about my experiences of the farm, fearing they might be considered too personal or too narrow. Nevertheless, I felt this work to be too crucial and too significant to allow my fears to curb its exploration. Sometime later, I became aware of having frequent recurrences of particular memories and images of the farm???events, places, objects which were indelibly etched in my mind. Sometimes these images occurred during changes in the weather, or seasons; from feelings of alienation, boredom, loneliness; or from missing my family and the farm. The recurrence and clarity of these images, and my personal identification with them, compelled me to focus upon them in my work. Initially, I drew the images, but soon discovered a need to express them in sculpture, which resulted in the first bas relief. I found this method to be a more effective means of expressing the nature and importance of these memories. The subject of this first bas relief (Plate I) was an old earthen root cellar, used to store fresh and canned fruits and vegetables from our orchard and garden. This ???cave???, as we called it, was frequented throughout the year. In the fall, it was visited for re-stocking; in the summer, for protection against threatening storms, as a unique respite from heat, as well as a personal hide-away. Working with these first images, through drawing relief sculpture, encouraged additional images from my past to come forth: The Kitchen (Plate II), The Bale Pile (Plates VI & VIII), The Barn (Plate VIII), The <b>Loading</b> <b>Chute</b> (Plate XI), The Oatfield (Plate XII), and others.

5000|$|The shed {{was home}} {{to a number of}} express locomotives, being {{allocated}} no less than 35 pacifics in 1954, as well as the Newcastle Central station pilots, and an assortment of smaller locomotives for local passenger trains and goods workings, with a large number of goods engines also stabled a few miles away at Blaydon (52C) and at the nearby Borough Gardens shed (54C) which stood at the eastern end of a large marshalling yard adjacent to the Newcastle-Sunderland line up until its closure in 1959, by which time its shed code was 52J, having previously been a sub-shed of Sunderland (54A) along with Tyne Dock (formerly 54C, becoming 52H in 1958). From 1958 all BR locomotive depots on Tyneside, Wearside and in Northumberland became sub-sheds of Gateshead. Prior to its conversion into a more conventional loco (and when not undergoing tests and modifications), the experimental water-tube boilered [...] "W1" [...] 4-6-4 No. 10000 which became known as the [...] "hush-hush" [...] due to the secrecy surrounding its construction was also stabled at Gateshead. In BR days, the shed continued to house mainly ex-NER/LNER locomotives, the BR standard classes being for the most part conspicuous by their absence from north east lines (one exception being a modified batch of the massive [...] "9Fs" [...] which had been specially fitted with large Westinghouse air pumps; these locomotives were stabled at Tyne Dock shed and employed on the heavy iron ore trains to Consett Steelworks where the pumps were needed to operate the air powered doors on the large bogie ore hoppers). Gateshead also provided motive power for Dunston Staithes, to the West, which had restrictions in place regarding locomotives that could work on them, these being, in LNER and BR days, J71 and J72 0-6-0 tanks and a pair of Y3 sentinel geared locomotives affectionately known as [...] "pups". The 0-6-0 tanks propelled loaded trains out of the Norwood Coal Yard onto top of the Staithes where the waiting pups shunted the wagons into position above the <b>loading</b> <b>chutes,</b> while the empties rolled back off the staithes under gravity and would be collected for their journey back to the colliery by an 0-8-0 from Blaydon or Borough Gardens.

40|$|Video and {{industry}} data {{were used to}} assess the inter-relationships of aggression, delivery, coat color, year of birth, number of outs, buckoff percent and score in rodeo bulls. An evaluation of laterality based on observations of how the individual animals were <b>loaded</b> into <b>chutes</b> at 11 bull riding events showed 63 % left-handed delivery and 37 % right-handed delivery across all observations (n = 525). There was a similar distribution for aggressiveness (based on whether or not the bull charged after the rider dismounted) with 64 % of bulls being non-aggressive and 36 % of bulls being aggressive. Significant linear relationships existed between score and number of outs and score and buckoff percentage indicating that experience impacted performance. The correlation between number of outs and buckoff percentage was low to moderate (0. 06 to 0. 30), depending upon the subset of data evaluated. The r-square value for the analysis of score among all bulls was 0. 14; however, the r-square value in the subset of bulls with known sires with more than one son was 0. 68 when sire was included in the model. Similar increases in r-square values were observed for 2006 average score, career average score, buckoff percentage, and career buckoff percentage, indicating important genetic influences on these traits and/or their component traits. Investigations into the relationship between performance and aggression may help bucking stock producers improve the selection criteria they use. The current trend within the industry is for several breeders to breed ?hot? or flighty, nervous cattle to achieve higher performing offspring. Given that there was no association between aggression and score based on chi-square test, aggression may be removed from the criteria for using certain animals for breeding purposes. Based on results from this work, if bucking stock breeders want to make genetic changes in these traits, documentation of pedigree information is vital...|$|R
