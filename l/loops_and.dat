5|$|In April 1868, the Metropolitan & St John's Wood Railway (M) {{opened a}} {{single-track}} railway in tunnel to Swiss Cottage from new platforms at Baker Street (called Baker Street East). There were intermediate stations at St John's Wood Road and Marlborough Road, both with crossing <b>loops,</b> <b>and</b> {{the line was}} worked by the Met with a train every 20 minutes.

40|$|AbstractElectron {{microscopy}} {{has shown}} that non-histone chromosomal HMG 1 could induce DNA looping or compaction in the presence (but not in the absence) of Ca 2 +. The effect of calcium on DNA <b>looping</b> <b>and</b> compaction was interpreted as calcium binding to the acidic C-domain of HMG 1. Both individual DNA-binding HMG 1 -box domains A and B {{were found to be}} involved in DNA <b>looping</b> <b>and</b> compaction. Treatment of HMG 1 with a thiol-specific reagent, N-ethylmaleimide, inhibited the ability of the protein to induce DNA <b>looping</b> <b>and</b> compaction but not the electrostatic interaction with DNA. These results indicated that cysteine-sulfhydryl groups of the HMG 1 -box domains A and B are specifically involved in DNA <b>looping</b> <b>and</b> compaction, and that in the absence of calcium the acidic C-domain down-regulates these effects by modulation of the DNA-binding properties of the HMG 1 -box domains...|$|R
5|$|After what {{is later}} {{believed}} to have been at least three months, Daniel is finally able to reconstruct the planet's history with the finished translations: the Ancients had attempted to escape a mysterious plague by building a time machine but never got it to work properly. Upon returning to the planet, SG-1 learn of the death of Malikai's wife, whom Malikai wants to visit in the past {{with the help of the}} time machine. O'Neill's experience of his son's death convinces Malikai to shut down the device before yet another new loop can start. Back at the SGC, O'Neill, Carter, and Daniel have their first breakfast after the <b>loops,</b> <b>and</b> O'Neill answers Daniel's question about unusual activities in the loops with a long look at Carter.|$|E
5|$|By 1932 the Cronulla tramway had closed. Competing bus {{services}} {{had begun}} to run with unrestricted competition, and the tram line by this time was so full with services that trams often ran late due to holdups at the crossing <b>loops</b> <b>and</b> passengers missed their connections at Sutherland. The line suffered large losses in its later years, {{and the effect of}} the Great Depression at the time forced it to cease its services, the last passenger service operating on 3 August 1931. The goods service continued until 12 January of the next year.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, the {{rationing}} {{of petroleum}} fuels gave {{a boost to}} ridership on the electric tramways. To handle the massive increase in ridership, the trams were equipped with two conductors. The single-centre-door solution that worked excellently before the war became a bottle-neck as the trams became packed with riders. Lack of parts, particularly for the British Vickers motors, caused long waits for defective vehicles at the depots. From 1942, the Kolsås Line was transferred to terminate at Nationaltheatret in the city centre, and the Class B was operated along the Lilleaker Line from the west. Trams 164–166 were sent to Düsseldorf in Germany, but were never used because the city lacked balloon <b>loops</b> <b>and</b> the trams were too wide.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) {{officials}} announced their long-term plan {{to prevent further}} traffic jams. They will create a series of <b>loops</b> <b>and</b> overpasses allowing traffic to go directly from southbound Route32 to the Thruway and remove some traffic lights {{in front of the}} mall. The changes were expected to be complete by 2011, as part of improvements to convert the Route17 expressway into I-86. However, in 2009 they were postponed due to funding constraints. Work was slated to begin in 2013, but just before it could start Governor Andrew Cuomo redirected the money to repair projects elsewhere in the state. The project was put on indefinite hold in 2014 until it could be funded.|$|E
5|$|The Victor {{has been}} {{described}} as an agile aircraft, atypical for a large bomber aircraft; in 1958, a Victor had performed several <b>loops</b> <b>and</b> a barrel roll during practices for a display flight at Farnborough Airshow. Manoeuvrability was greatly enabled by the light controls, quick response of the aircraft, and the design of certain flight surfaces such as the infinitely-variable tail-mounted airbrake. The Victor was designed for flight at high subsonic speeds, although multiple instances have occurred in which the sound barrier was broken. During development of the Victor B.2, the RAF had stressed the concept of tactical manoeuvrability, which led to much effort in development being given to increasing the aircraft's height and range performance.|$|E
5|$|The line stopped {{carrying}} {{passengers on}} 5 December 1964, {{as part of}} the rationalisation known as the Beeching Axe. All stations were closed, and all goods yards, passing <b>loops</b> <b>and</b> sidings removed, except the marshalling yard for the Octel freight. Octel's freight traffic totaled 70,000 tons annually, and the railway was kept in order to serve this traffic. Local freight services ceased, and the electric staff system was withdrawn, so that only one train could be on the branch at a time, although that was sufficient for Octel's requirements. The double junction at Gaerwen was also remodelled. Once the freight trains were being worked by diesel locomotives, arrangements were made for the British Rail engines to operate {{all the way to the}} plant.|$|E
