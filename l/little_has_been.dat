5|$|Many traditions have {{stressed}} the grief of mothers over deprivation {{of their children}} but <b>little</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> said historically about young children's loss of their mothers; {{this may have been}} because loss of the mother in infancy frequently meant death for a breast-fed infant. In the 19th century, French society bureaucratised a system in which infants were breast-fed at the homes of foster mothers, returning to the biological family after weaning, and no concern was evinced at the possible effect of this double separation on the child.|$|E

5|$|Pollution, {{floods and}} {{development}} of the watershed and the surrounding county have blighted the water quality and wildlife of the creek since the 1960s, when residential suburban development of the eight cities in the watershed began.

5|$|At , it {{is a small}} honeyeater with a short {{tail and}} {{relatively}} long down-curved bill. It is sexually dimorphic; the male has a glossy red head and brown upperparts and paler grey-brown underparts while the female has predominantly grey-brown plumage. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical mangrove forests. It is very active when feeding in the tree canopy, darting from flower to flower and gleaning insects off foliage. It calls constantly as it feeds. While <b>little</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> documented on the red-headed myzomela's breeding behaviour, it is recorded as building a small cup-shaped nest in the mangroves and laying two or three oval, white eggs with small red blotches.|$|E
5|$|The War of the Bavarian Succession was {{the last}} war for both Frederick and Maria Theresa, whose reigns began and ended with wars against one another. Although they {{deployed}} armies {{three to four times}} the size of the armies of the Seven Years' War, neither monarch used the entirety of the military force each had at his or her disposal, making this war-without-battles remarkable. Despite the restraint of the monarchs, some early nineteenth-century casualty estimates suggest that tens of thousands died of starvation and hunger-related disease. Carlyle's more moderate estimate lies at about ten thousand Prussian and probably another ten thousand Austrian dead. Michael Hochedlinger assesses combined casualties at approximately thirty thousand; Robert Kann gives no estimate of casualties but suggests the primary causes of death were cholera and dysentery. Gaston Bodart, whose 1915 work is still considered the authority on Austrian military losses, is specific: five Austrian generals (he does not name them), over twelve thousand soldiers, and 74officers died of disease. In minor actions and skirmishes, nine officers and 265men were killed and four officers and 123men were wounded, but not fatally. Sixty-two officers and 2,802men were taken prisoner, and 137men were missing. Over three thousand Imperial soldiers deserted. Finally, twenty-six officers and 372men were discharged with disabilities. Bodart also gives Prussian losses: one general killed (he does not say which), 87officers and 3,364 men killed, wounded or captured. Overall, he assumes losses of ten percent of the fighting force. <b>Little</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> discovered of civilian casualties, although certainly the civilians also suffered from starvation and disease. There were other damages: for example, Habelschwerdt and one of its hamlets were destroyed by fire.|$|E
