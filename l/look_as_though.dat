5|$|Upon Philip's return, he {{dispatched}} Alexander {{with a small}} {{force to}} subdue revolts in southern Thrace. Campaigning against the Greek city of Perinthus, Alexander {{is reported to have}} saved his father's life. Meanwhile, the city of Amphissa began to work lands that were sacred to Apollo near Delphi, a sacrilege that gave Philip the opportunity to further intervene in Greek affairs. Still occupied in Thrace, he ordered Alexander to muster an army for a campaign in southern Greece. Concerned that other Greek states might intervene, Alexander made it <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he was preparing to attack Illyria instead. During this turmoil, the Illyrians invaded Macedonia, only to be repelled by Alexander.|$|E
5|$|M-86 {{currently}} uses two bridges {{eligible for}} listing on the NRHP. The span over the St. Joseph River in Three Rivers {{was built in}} 1903. It is a five-span concrete arch bridge constructed to <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> created from stacked masonry blocks. The current railings were added in 1952 by the MSHD during a repair project. The second historic structure is the bridge over the Prairie River in Centreville. This camelback pony truss span was moved to its current location in 1938–39, although it was originally built on an unknown location in 1923. In the move, two sidewalks, one {{on either side of}} the trusses, were eliminated from the structure. This project was part of Public Works Administration relief work in the area.|$|E
5|$|Mercedes {{enjoys a}} fling with Freddie and then soon begin a relationship. The pair {{get into a}} feud with Grace Black (Tamara Wall) and Trevor over The Loft, which they work in and run. Mercedes is left angry and {{disappointed}} when she walks in on Lindsey and Freddie kissing. When Mercedes discovers that Freddie killed Grace's father Fraser Black (Jesse Birdsall) for his mistreatment of his mother, Sandy Roscoe (Gillian Taylforth), she uses this information to blackmail him. She forms strong friendships with Cindy and Lindsey, whom she bonded with over Doctor Browning's death, and helps Cindy's daughter Holly Cunningham (Amanda Clapham) when she suspects Cindy has had a mental breakdown. Mercedes also helps Theresa, who is serving a prison sentence for Calvin's murder after his brother Sonny Valentine (Aaron Fontaine) had tricked Carmel into reporting Theresa to the police, to escape by forcing a heavily pregnant Theresa to fake labour. Mercedes enters the hospital dressed as a doctor and helps Theresa escape, but Sonny tracks them down. Myra, who has returned from Spain, knocks Sonny unconscious and the three women try to escape, but the police catch them and Theresa is returned to prison although they are eventually able to get her released by making it <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> Sonny manipulated her in to confessing. Mercedes supports John Paul when he reveals that he was raped {{by one of his}} students, Finn O'Connor (Keith Rice) and Mercedes starts a feud with Finn's stepmother Diane O'Connor (Alex Fletcher), who protests Finn's innocence. Mercedes, Myra, Nana and Carmel publicly embarrass Diane and support John Paul in court at Finn's trial, when Finn protests his innocence and lies, claiming that John Paul molested him, but Finn is found guilty for the rape and sent to prison.|$|E

25|$|Extrasolar planets – methane was {{detected}} on extrasolar planet HD 189733b; {{this is the}} first detection of an organic compound on a planet outside the solar system. Its origin is unknown, since the planet's high temperature (700°C) would normally favor the formation of carbon monoxide instead. Research indicates that meteoroids slamming against exoplanet atmospheres could add hydrocarbon gases such as methane, making the exoplanets <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they are inhabited by life, even if they are not.|$|E
25|$|Forced {{perspective}} {{was also}} employed, {{so that it}} would <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the short Hobbits were interacting with taller Men and Elves. Surprising the makers of the film, the simple use of kneeling down was used to great effect. Some actors also wore oversized costumes to make average sized actors look small, and there were numerous scale doubles, who were disguised with costumes, and an avoidance of close-ups and numerous back shots, and even latex faces for the Hobbit doubles.|$|E
25|$|The Tainted – Where {{the other}} Nazgûl were slowly {{swallowed}} by the taint of their rings, the Tainted gave himself wholly and willingly to Sauron. Now all natural things rebel in his presence, vegetation withers, animals sicken and bold warriors cower. He is an abomination whose merest presence is poison to life, honour and hope. The Tainted {{is one of the}} Nazgûl, representing their withering, abhorrent nature. His mounted model is built to <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> his horse were sickened and dying by merely being near him.|$|E

Churchill sacked Wavell but could not have it <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he was being punished or have Wavell return to England, as embarrassing questions could be raised. Churchill had Wavell exchange duties with General Claude Auchinleck, Commander-in-Chief, India. Along with Wavell went Michael O'Moore Creagh, who was replaced by Gott.|$|E
25|$|Silas, born 17 March 1948, {{is the son}} of Nancy Blissett. Silas {{became a}} {{journalist}} and married a woman named Joan. They had two children, Heidi (Kim Tiddy) and Wendy. Silas told his family that Joan was murdered by an intruder she disturbed, and that he'd found her body, but it was later revealed that Silas had discovered that Joan {{was having an affair with}} her neighbour and Silas killed her, making it <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> she'd been killed by a burglar. Silas faked a heart attack after killing Joan, although it was later treated as a false alarm by the local hospital.|$|E
25|$|Shares {{had been}} issued {{in the names}} of Peto, Betts, Crampton and their acquaintances, and the LCDR {{accounts}} written up to make it <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> either the associated cash payment had been made directly to Peto and Betts to fund the construction of the line, or the money, having been paid to the railway company, had temporarily been lent back to the new shareholders. In fact, no cash had changed hands at all, but on the strength of these fictitious entries, the statutory declaration was made before a justice of the peace and authority given to raise loans.|$|E

25|$|The roofed {{colonnade}} {{led from}} the enclosure wall {{to the south of}} the complex. A passageway with a limestone ceiling constructed to <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it was made from whole tree trunks led to a massive stone imitation of two open doors. Beyond this portal was a hall with twenty pairs of limestone columns composed of drum shaped segments built to look like bundles of plant stems and reaching a height of 6.6 m. The columns were not free-standing, but were attached to the wall by masonry projections. Between the columns {{on both sides of the}} hall were small chambers, which some Egyptologists propose may have been for each of the provinces of Upper and Lower Egypt. At the end of the colonnade was the transverse hypostyle room with eight columns connected in pairs by blocks of limestone. This led to the South Court.|$|E
25|$|Richie {{is able to}} {{secretly}} abstract JR's bone marrow, while setting JR up to <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he was out {{all night}} with a hooker the day he went missing. A drugged-up JR, unaware that his bone marrow has been stolen, insists {{to his family and}} Babe that he was drugged and he knows Richie did this to him. Initially Krystal is the only one to believe JR, but Babe later finds out that JR is telling the truth about Richie and apologizes to him. She sees Richie pay the hooker that was with JR the night Richie stole his bone marrow. Babe punches out the hooker. She goes on a mission to find out what other stuff Richie has done to JR or anyone else. During this mission, JR saves Babe from being raped by some guys when she goes undercover as a prostitute to clear JR's name and find out what crimes Richie did. Trina decides to tell the truth about Richie and her part in framing JR when Richie stole his bone marrow. JR promises Trina some money to get out of prostituting and go somewhere Richie is not due to fear that Richie will kill her since she told JR what Richie did. With Richie finally gone, JR and Babe come happily together again.|$|E
25|$|The Fellowship of the Ring makes {{extensive}} use of digital, practical and make-up special effects throughout. One noticeable illusion that appears in almost every scene involves setting a proper scale so that the characters are all the correct height. Elijah Wood, who plays Frodo, is 5ft 6 in (1.68m) tall in real life, but the character of Frodo Baggins is barely four feet in height. Many different tricks were used to depict the hobbits (and Gimli the Dwarf) as being of diminutive stature. (In a happy coincidence, John-Rhys Davies– who played Gimli– is as tall compared to the Hobbit actors as his character needed to be compared to theirs, so {{he did not need}} to be filmed separately as a third variation of height, and is quite taller than Orlando Bloom, who played Legolas.) Large- and small-scale doubles were used in certain scenes, while entire duplicates of certain sets (including Bag End in Hobbiton) were built at two different scales, so that the characters would appear to be the appropriate size. At one point in the film, Frodo runs along a corridor in Bag End, followed by Gandalf. Elijah Wood and Ian McKellen were filmed in separate versions of the same corridor, built at two different scales, and a fast camera pan conceals the edit between the two. Forced perspective was also employed, so that it would <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the short Hobbits were interacting with taller Men and Elves. Even the simple use of kneeling down, to the filmmakers' surprise, turned out to be an effective method in creating the illusion.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the artistic}} styles {{that is the most}} radical {{departure}} from traditional animation styles is in [...] "The Duel", which employs a filter that makes every cell <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it was hand painted by watercolors. His goal that he was aiming for in this project was, [...] "to make audiences understand there should be other styles of animation beyond the existing two primary kinds of animation presented—precisely cel-drawing 2D style and CG 3D style. I wanted to show that creators are not limited, that they have many options for different (animation) styles to create stories." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{identity}} of the sitter has been debated since the panel's discovery. Foley has identified at least four Jane Greys among the English nobility {{at the time of}} the portrait. However, owing to [...] "the ages and marital status of the other candidates", Lady Jane Grey was the only viable choice; the others were too young, already married and using a different surname, or had lost their title. Starkey was more reserved, arguing [...] "there isn't that over-the-top quality you get with royal portraits of the period, where the sitters <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they've just come back from Asprey", and that there was no documentation of Jane owning the jewellery seen in the portrait.|$|E

I was very interested in characterizing or caricaturing a brushstroke..." [...] He has also described this series as follows: [...] "t's taking something that originally was suppose to mean immediacy and I'm tediously drawing something that looks like a brushstroke...I want it to <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it were painstaking." [...] In the 1990s, he described his inspiration in more artistic terms ...|$|E

500|$|Immediately {{following}} the battle Stimers telegraphed Ericsson, congratulating and thanking him {{for making it}} possible to confront the Confederate ironclad and for [...] "saving the day". No sooner than Monitor had weighed anchor, numerous small boats and spectators on shore flocked around the ship to congratulate the crew for what they regarded as their victory over Virginia. Assistant Secretary Fox, who observed the entire battle from aboard Minnesota, came aboard Monitor and jokingly told her officers, [...] "Well gentlemen, you don't <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> you just went through one of the greatest naval conflicts on record". A small tug soon came alongside and the blinded Worden was brought up from his cabin while crew members and spectators cheered. He was taken directly to Fort Monroe for preliminary treatment, then to a hospital in Washington shortly thereafter.|$|E
500|$|Scott and Zelda {{quickly became}} celebrities of New York, {{as much for}} their wild {{behavior}} as {{for the success of}} This Side of Paradise. They were ordered to leave both the Biltmore Hotel and the Commodore Hotel for their drunkenness. Zelda once jumped into the fountain at Union Square. Another example of their behavior was when Dorothy Parker first met them, as Zelda and Scott were sitting atop a taxi. Parker said, [...] "They did both <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they had just stepped out of the sun; their youth was striking. Everyone wanted to meet him." [...] Their social life was fueled with alcohol. Publicly, this meant little more than napping when they arrived at parties, but privately it increasingly led to bitter fights. To their delight, {{in the pages of the}} New York newspapers Zelda and Scott had become icons of youth and success—enfants terribles of the Jazz Age.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the album}} was {{generally}} well received, its content drew criticism from fans, who felt the overall effect diminished the significance of Harrison's solo career. In the 1977 edition of their book , Roy Carr and Tony Tyler summed up the implication: [...] "George's 'Best Of'. Half Beatle, half Harisongs. But {{will there be a}} Volume II?" [...] Nicholas Schaffner observed a couple of minor positives on this [...] "half-baked" [...] collection: [...] "The Best of George Harrison does confirm that George's big production numbers from All Things Must Pass more than hold their own alongside the seven featured Beatles tunes... And the album is undeniably better looking than Rock 'n' Roll Music." [...] Bob Woffinden similarly found that Harrison's solo recordings matched the standard of the Beatles' tracks while noting that [...] "Capitol's half-and-half arrangement... made it <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> {{he was the only one}} of the four [...] with insufficient clout to warrant a 'Greatest Hits' [...] entirely of his own work." ...|$|E
