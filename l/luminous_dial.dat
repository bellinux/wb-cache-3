A Pre-operational Safety Appraisal is a requirement as stated in Department of Energy Order 5481. 1, Safety Analysis and Review System. The operations to be conducted in the new Tritiated Scrap Waste Recovery Facility are not new, but a continuation of a prime mission of Mound`s i. e. recovery of tritium from waste produced throughout the DOE complex. The new facility is a replacement of an existing process started in the early 1960 `s and incorporates numerous design changes to enhance personnel and environmental safety. This report also documents the safety of a one time operation involving the recovery of tritium from material obtained by the Department of Energy from the State of Arizona. This project will involve the processing of 240, 000 curies of tritium contained in glass ampoules that were to be used in items such as <b>luminous</b> <b>dial</b> watches.

25|$|From the 1960s {{the use of}} radium {{paint was}} discontinued. In many cases <b>luminous</b> <b>dials</b> were {{implemented}} with non-radioactive fluorescent materials excited by light; such devices glow in the dark after exposure to light, but the glow fades. Where long-lasting self-luminosity in darkness was required, safer radioactive promethium-147 (half-life 2.6 years) or tritium (half-life 12 years) paint was used; both continue to be used today. These had the added advantage of not degrading the phosphor over time, unlike radium. Tritium emits very low-energy beta radiation (even lower-energy than the beta radiation emitted by promethium) which cannot penetrate the skin, rather than the penetrating gamma radiation of radium and is regarded as safer.|$|R

The damage is manifest in various forms, i. e., severe anemia, osteitis, and osteogenic sarcoma. In the past, therapy to check injury from internal radiation emitters had been directed to attempts to hasten the elimination of the noxious agent. These have included such methods as low calcium diets, parathormone, viosterol, ammonium chloride, calcium gluconate, and low phosphorus diets. Of these the decalcifying type of treatment was reported to have some measure of effectiveness. The results of the other types of therapy were equivocal. The most successful approach was reported in the work of Schubert. Using zirconium citrate complex, administered 3 hours after the injection of radioyttrium and plutonium into rats, he was able to increase the urinary excretion of the injected radio elements many times over that of the excretion in the untreated rats, in some instance up by a factor of 50 for the first day of excretion. However, when used at later time periods, i. e., in a dog at 150 days, the increase in urinary excretion was only a factor of 2 to 3 over the control period. The fecal excretion of the radio elements was not influenced by the treatment. The present study reports a different approach for accelerating the excretion of radioelements, namely the use of chelating agents. Many of the rare earth and actinide series of elements form water-soluble chelates with various organic compounds. This consideration suggested the possibility that this property of chelating agents might be used 'in vivo' to mobilize radio elements fixed within the body. Of the many compounds considered, ethylenediamine tetracetic acid (EDTA) was chosen for this study. The EDTA was selected because it forms a very stable chelate with many metal ions and hence has a strong tendency to remove such ions from insoluble combinations, i. e., it will dissolve such salts as calcium oxalate, barium sulfate, and lead phosphate in neutral and alkaline solutions. Moreover, it has suitable characteristics for 'in vivo' application. It forms serum soluble chelates which are not readily broken down in the body but are rapidly excreted intact via the kidney. It is readily absorbed through the digestive tract. It has a very low level of toxicity when used as described in this study, namely as the calcium complex. A dose equivalent to 3 grams per kilo of body weight, injected intraperitoneally into rats, will result in death in approximately 50 % of the injected animals in one day. When administered as a neutral salt, the EDTA combines avidly with serum calcium and produces death in hypocalcemia with relatively small doses, i. e., approximately 200 milligrams per kilo of body weight in rats. However, when administered combined with an equivalent weight of calcium ion, this negative calcium balance is prevented and the compound is rendered relatively non-toxic. Under these conditions the EDTA will still chelate a large number of metals, namely the metals which displace the calcium from combination with the EDTA because they form more stable chelates...|$|E

By out here, I refer to a pin head, somewhere in the Pacific, that they call an island where all you can see is water coral 2 ̆ 6 palm trees. To walk entirely around the island in about three hours you can see it’s pretty small. We have an occasional ship stop now 2 ̆ 6 then 2 ̆ 6 it’s a welcome sight. We have a long working day 2 ̆ 6 are on call twenty-four hours a day. When we do have a few hours to ourselves we can play tennis, basketball, handball, swim, fish, sail in the lagoon or go shell hunting. Believe it or not shell hunting is the most popular and I guess you might say the most dangerous, for coral is the worst thing I ever ran up against for cutting a person. Shells known as “Cat Eyes” are obtained beyond the reef which surrounds the island 2 ̆ 6 it is necessary to swim under the breakers through the coral to reach comparatively calm water beyond where the water will be anywhere from ten to fifty feet 2 ̆ 6 deeper. The shells are found clinging to coral shelves in this water and with the aid of underwater glasses you look out at fish of all colors 2 ̆ 6 shapes including sharks which don’t exactly make one feel too much at home. It is something you read 2 ̆ 6 dream about but very seldom think you will try. Sharks come within easy reach at times 2 ̆ 6 they are not to be trusted so we usually make a cautious exit from their vicinity. We have movies every night 2 ̆ 6 a black out room in the barracks where we can read, write, play cards, drink beer and fruit juices also liquor if you are fortunate enough to have had the forthought [sic] and brought your own personal stock. No lights including cigarettes are allowed outside after dark and unless there is a bright moon out <b>luminous</b> <b>dial</b> wrist watches act more or less as a means of avoiding bumping into people in the dark. The weather is ideal 2 ̆ 6 your [sic] not here long before you acquire a dark tan. I have been out here a little better than three months now 2 ̆ 6 on the way out I stopped at Pearl Harbor where I was shown around the island of Oahu by none other than Eddie Krvock a well known alumnus of Bryant College. I am in contact with Gene Schmidt who is a Pvt. in the Army based in Texas also S/Sgt. Ray Smith in California 2 ̆ 6 both of them love the life they are leading even if it is quite a let down after being a civilian. When I was stationed back in the states it sure was nice to receive packages of cigarettes, candy, etc. from the Service club 2 ̆ 6 I really appreciated it. Out here we can get cigarettes without any trouble 2 ̆ 6 as far as food goes I’m afraid it would get stale on its way out besides they try to give us everything that is possible in the line of candy etc. 2 ̆ 6 with the mails being heavy we are asked not to send for packages. Thanks for wanting to do something in the line of those welcome packages but I suggest that in many cases where you cannot send them letters will always be welcome. In return you will receive mail from the boys which will be newsy at first but later after they have given you all the news they have to cut down due to censoring. I hope this letter will give you a general idea in brief what life is like on a Pacific Isle, all but the details that cannot be told for obvious reasons. I was very sorry to learn of Ben Scuda’s being missing {{in this part of the}} globe 2 ̆ 6 I hope he will turn up safe 2 ̆ 6 sound very soon. I believe he was operating off a carrier 2 ̆ 6 having operated myself from one I know that every inch of credit coming to him he deserves for it is just about the toughest assignment in the navy but it’s also one of the best. It isn’t like me to talk so long but I did want to show my appreciation 2 ̆ 6 if I ever return to Prov. you’ll see me on the hill until then write letters to the boys over-seas plenty of them they are always welcome.

And then there was Madame von Rosen, upon whom he looked down with some of that ill-favoured contempt of the chaste male for the imperfect woman.
