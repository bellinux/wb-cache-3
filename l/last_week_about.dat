6000|$|... "MORAL STATISTICIAN."--I don't {{want any}} of your statistics; I took your whole batch and lit my pipe with it. I hate your kind of people. You are always {{ciphering}} out how much a man's health is injured, and how much his intellect is impaired, and how many pitiful dollars and cents he wastes {{in the course of}} ninety-two years' indulgence in the fatal practice of smoking; and in the equally fatal practice of drinking coffee; and in playing billiards occasionally; and in taking a glass of wine at dinner, etc., etc., etc. And you are always figuring out how many women have been burned to death because of the dangerous fashion of wearing expansive hoops, etc., etc., etc. You never see more than one side of the question. You are blind to the fact that most old men in America smoke and drink coffee, although, according to your theory, they ought to have died young; and that hearty old Englishmen drink wine and survive it, and portly old Dutchmen both drink and smoke freely, and yet grow older and fatter all the time. And you never try to find out how much solid comfort, relaxation, and enjoyment a man derives from smoking {{in the course of a}} lifetime (which is worth ten times the money he would save by letting it alone), nor the appalling aggregate of happiness lost in a lifetime by your kind of people from not smoking. Of course you can save money by denying yourself all the little vicious enjoyments for fifty years; but then what can you do with it? What use can you put it to? Money can't save your infinitesimal soul. All the use that money can be put to is to purchase comfort and enjoyment in this life; therefore, as you are an enemy to comfort and enjoyment, where is the use of accumulating cash? It won't do for you to say that you can use it to better purpose in furnishing a good table, and in charities, and in supporting tract societies, because you know yourself that you people who have no petty vices are never known to give away a cent, and that you stint yourselves so in the matter of food that you are always feeble and hungry. And you never dare to laugh in the daytime for fear some poor wretch, seeing you in a good humor, will try to borrow a dollar of you; and in church you are always down on your knees, with your eyes buried in the cushion, when the contribution-box comes around; and you never give the revenue officers a full statement of your income. Now you know these things yourself, don't you? Very well, then what is the use of your stringing out your miserable lives to a lean and withered old age? What is the use of your saving money that is so utterly worthless to you? In a word, why don't you go off somewhere and die, and not be always trying to seduce people into becoming as [...] "ornery" [...] and unlovable as you are yourselves, by your villainous [...] "moral statistics"? Now I don't approve of dissipation, and I don't indulge in it, either; but I haven't a particle of confidence in a man who has no redeeming petty vices, and so I don't want to hear from you any more. I think you are the very same man who read me a long lecture <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>about</b> the degrading vice of smoking cigars, and then came back, in my absence, with your reprehensible fireproof gloves on, and carried off my beautiful parlor stove.|$|E

Maybe I should take some time off. " Mrs. Brown was concerned. This did not sound like Bill. He was usually an upbeat guy, liked his job at the software company, and always looked forward to the start of the school year, especially since he was hoping to graduate in the spring. "Perhaps you should visit my doctor, and he can give you something to make you feel better, " she told him.

40|$|Background and purpose: Integrated Biological Behavior Survey (IBBS) in 2011 {{showed that}} use of condoms among clients of female sex workers (FSW) was low. This was likely {{associated}} with tha lack of negotiations by FSWs. This study aims to determine negotiation strategies and determinants of condom use among FSWs in Denpasar. Methods: Cross-sectional survey was conducted among 100 brothel FSWs selected by cluster random sampling in some locations in Denpasar. Data was collected through interviews using questionnaires on: socio-demographic characteristics, internal and external factors, condom negotiations and condom use. Questionnaire about condom negotiation was a modification of Condom Influence Strategy Questionnaire (CISQ) developed by Noar. Bivariate analysis was conducted using chi square test and multivariate analysis by logistic regression. Results: About 87 % FSWs reported use condoms during the last sexual intercourse with their clients and 63 % reported always used condom in the <b>last</b> <b>week.</b> <b>About</b> 37 % of clients carried condoms when they visit FSWs and 58 % of FSWs reported that they negotiated condom to their clients. Among 63 % of clients who did not carry condoms 92. 1 % of them eventually wear condoms after negotiated by FSWs. Negotiating strategy used by FSWs were direct request, conseptualizing relationships, risk information and deception. Significant factors associated with condom use were age of FSWs (AOR= 4. 1; 95 %CI: 1. 32 - 12. 4), the availability of condoms (AOR= 8. 8; 95 %CI: 2. 8 - 27. 7) and negotiations (AOR= 3. 9; 95 %CI: 1. 4 - 10. 8). Conclusion: Most frequent negotiation strategy used was direct request to their clients.
