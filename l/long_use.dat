5|$|This caused great consternation {{among the}} aristocracy, {{who insisted that}} <b>long</b> <b>use</b> in itself {{constituted}} licence. A compromise was eventually reached in 1290, whereby a liberty was considered legitimate {{as long as it}} could be shown to have been exercised since the coronation of Richard the Lionheart in 1189. Royal gains from the Quo warranto proceedings were insignificant; few liberties were returned to the King. Edward had nevertheless won a significant victory, in clearly establishing the principle that all liberties essentially emanated from the crown.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Finnhorse's {{image as}} a working farm horse, the breed {{was used as a}} cavalry mount from the 17thcentury until the end of World War II. After the {{mechanisation}} of Finnish agriculture in the 1960s and the 1970s, however, it was not clear if the Finnhorse would make the transition into a riding horse, even though the <b>long</b> <b>use</b> of the breed by the Finnish cavalry had proven it well-suited for the job. The Finnhorse had a strong {{image as a}} harnessed working horse, associated with rural life and old times. When riding as a hobby emerged and became more established in Finnish cities during the 1960s, imported horses and ponies were preferred as mounts; warmblooded horses represented modern times, leisure time and wealth, while the Finnhorse was viewed as rugged and unsophisticated. The riding section studbook, created in 1971, grew slowly and gained only a few dozen horses during its first decade, as the idea of a Finnhorse used for riding was considered near-ridiculous at the time.|$|E

25|$|Modern designs {{have also}} shifted more towards using steel {{containment}} structures. In some cases steel {{is used to}} line {{the inside of the}} concrete, which contributes strength from both materials in the hypothetical case that containment becomes highly pressurized. Yet other newer designs call for both a steel and concrete containment - which is in decades <b>long</b> <b>use</b> in the current German PWR-designs - notably the AP1000 and the European Pressurized Reactor plan to use both; which gives missile protection by the outer concrete and pressurizing ability by the inner steel structure. The AP1000 has planned vents {{at the bottom of the}} concrete structure surrounding the steel structure under the logic that it would help move air over the steel structure and cool containment in the event of a major accident (in a similar way to how a cooling tower works).|$|E

500|$|The local {{transportation}} company, CTP, manages a tram line {{that runs through}} the city. Planned modernisation will involve the installation of new rail tracks and the separation of the tram route from road traffic. This will bring a number of advantages, including vibration and shock reduction, a substantial noise decrease, <b>long</b> <b>use</b> expectancy and higher transit speed – [...] The route will undergo major alteration on Horea Street, between the Chamber of Commerce and the central rail station, a rather problematic area. This dilemma should be solved either with the relocation of the track next to the sidewalk, or through the construction of a suspended tunnel. Another area that will benefit from large-scale changes is [...] "Splaiul Independenței", where the tracks will be pulled back to the Central Park, so that the roadway can host two lanes. In the Mănăștur area, under the bridge, the tracks will be brought closer, while other major works will executed on the traffic circle on Primăverii Street. Given the development of the metropolitan area, further plans feature the creation of a light rail track between Gilău and Jucu that will use these modernised tracks in the city.|$|E

2500|$|The use of E. coli as the {{experimental}} organism has allowed many generations and large populations {{to be studied}} {{in a relatively short}} period of time. Moreover, due to the <b>long</b> <b>use</b> of E [...]coli as a principle model organism in molecular biology, a wide array of tools, protocols, and procedures were available for studying changes at the genetic, phenotypic, and physiological levels. The bacteria can also be frozen and preserved while remaining viable. This has permitted the creation of what Lenski describes as a [...] "frozen fossil record" [...] of samples of evolving populations that can be revived at any time. This frozen fossil record allows populations to be restarted in cases of contamination or other disruption in the experiment, and permits the isolation and comparison of living exemplars of ancestral and evolved clones. Lenski chose an E. coli strain that reproduces only asexually, lacks any plasmids that could permit bacterial conjugation, and has no viable prophage. As a consequence, evolution in the experiment occurs only by the core evolutionary processes of mutation, genetic drift, and natural selection. This strict asexuality also means that genetic markers persist in lineages and clades by common descent, but cannot otherwise spread in the populations.|$|E
