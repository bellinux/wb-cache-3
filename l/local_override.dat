40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of Proposition 2 - 1 / 2 [...] a {{property}} tax limitation law approved by Massachusetts voters in 1980 [...] and assess voter satisfaction with these effects. We find that the proposition had a smaller effect on local revenues and spending than expected, as a result of both amendments to the law and a strong economy. Voters in 1980 believed there was significant waste in local government, partly because of an inability to monitor local officials. Proposition 2 - 1 / 2 curbed these agency losses, but direct <b>local</b> <b>override</b> votes and municipal expenditure patterns imply that the proposition initially reduced spending more than voters wanted.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{summarizes}} {{the most important}} features of the Crane Control Network (CCN) and Fast Multidrive Field bus Link (FMFL) {{as a part of}} the Distributed Multidrive System (DMS). The proposed links provide a real-time communication link between various clients or controllers in a complex DMS. CNL is configured as a <b>local</b> <b>overriding</b> communication network and includes FMFL as subnet. CNL and FMFL are designed in accordance with ISO's seven-layer model for Opens System Interconnection (OSI). Both links are used for the time critical, real-time communication within the DMS. DMS, access to the CNL and basic features of the FMFL’s protocol are shortly presented...|$|R

40|$|The San Joaquin Valley (SJV) {{suffers from}} severe health-endangering episodes of PM 2. 5 aerosol {{loadings}} in wintertime; episodes last approximately 5 days and differ in geographical distribution and composition. PM 2. 5 stations are scattered; consequently {{the use of}} remote sensing to map variable regional patterns of these varying respirable aerosol concentrations is desirable. High-precision AOT retrievals can capture column particulate loading. However,PM 2. 5 mapping is challenging due to several reasons: particularly thin mixed layers (ML) and thus relatively low aerosol optical thickness (AOT) close to current measurement limits, variable and a typical composition of the aerosols, and complex surface bidirectional reflectance. However, the West does present some advantages in analysis. Air basins are isolated from long-distance transport, and experience predominant strong meteorological subsidence. Thus these Western basin regions have fewer problematic cases of overriding aerosol layers detached from the surface. To counter such <b>local</b> <b>overriding,</b> Chu et al. have described an approach for the Eastern US, and He et al have described a synoptic classification approach useful in Shanghai. The Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) expands our experience {{with the use of}} AOT, with lower PM 2. 5 and several isolated sub-basins. We have prepared daily maps of episodes in each region. We present also a sequence of increasingly detailed statistical models, AOT initially appears to contribute little information; however, inclusion of weather information reveals its utility. Lyapustin and Wang's MultiAngle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) retrieval for AOT provided the most useful operational remote sensing information for these regions. It provides high (1 -km) spatial resolution maps and a high percentage of availability. Empirical regression methods have found that random effects regression models (aka mixed effects models, ME) employing AOT provide good estimates of ground PM 2. 5 concentrations. Here, we attempt to extend these methods and evaluate the usefulness of AOT with greater physical analysis, based on DISCOVER-AQ 4 experience...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} role of {{contrast}} in the local licensing of scrambling in on-line language comprehension in German using event-related brain potentials (ERP). Although contrastive readings {{give rise to a}} higher acceptability of scrambled word orders, they do not lead to an attenuation of the processing difficulties observed at the position of the scrambled object itself. Thus, similar to previous findings on givenness, contrast leads to global but not local licensing of scrambled structures, a finding that speaks against an immediate interaction of all relevant information types. The pattern is reversed when the scrambled object induces a corrective focus reading. Here scrambling does not give rise to increased local processing cost, but global acceptability decreases. These findings suggest that corrective focus can <b>override</b> <b>local</b> syntactic requirements {{on the basis of its}} extraordinarily high communicative saliency...|$|R

The topic of gender is generally missing from MPA management analyses. A mixed-methods qualitative approach was used. Results indicate that women played a significant role in MPA site selection and management, especially the enforcement of MPA policies and livelihood generation. Further implications for MPA management are that 1) changing gender roles and responsibilities has social equity outcomes, 2) action by gender-progressive individuals enabled women's empowerment, 3) <b>local</b> context can <b>override</b> gender-mainstreaming policies, and 4) a lack of gender considerations in MPA management can undermine long-term success...|$|R

40|$|As {{with many}} {{environmental}} issues, conflicts over airport noise are often {{grounded in the}} different experiences and knowledges of those who measure it and those who suffer its effects. The ways that airport neighbors challenge noise maps reflect the critical cartography literature, which does not take the truth of maps for granted but instead considers the political and other subjectivities behind their construction. At the same time, work {{in science and technology}} studies shows that conflicts between local residents and state officials and/or scientists are in part based on their different types of knowledge about a place, with state-centered scientific knowledge generally considered to <b>override</b> <b>local</b> knowledges. This paper brings together these two literatures in an analysis of conflicts over airport noise at Minneapolis – St Paul International Airport to show how members of the public construct their own critical cartographies. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{eye-tracking}} experiment {{examined the}} on-line interpretation of complex expressions like heavy smoker.

These results constrain the notion of incrementality in sentence comprehension and suggest that strict incrementality, in which each word is immediately and fully interpreted {{as soon as it}} is encountered, cannot be maintained. Alternative theories and comparisons to existing research in other domains are discussed. Recent research has particularly emphasized the incremental nature of language comprehension.

40|$|Developing {{countries}} are pervaded with scarcely populated rural areas. Under those conditions, providing broadband services with an efficient internet access at reasonable costs becomes a difficult endeavor.

Some solutions applied in these cases involve the use of long range wireless technologies, such as: microwave, 802. 11, WiMax, CDMA 450, among others. Some of the features fostering these technologies include speed, simple installation, use of frequencies which do not require previous authorization, and, furthermore, the possibility to <b>override</b> <b>local</b> telecommunications operators.

However, a recent randomized controlled study shows that surgery at 9 months of age is followed by a better post-operative growth of the testes than surgery at 3 years, which supports previous arguments for early surgery. Cryptorchidism is best diagnosed clinically, and treated by surgi-cal orchiopexy at age 6 - 12 months, without a routine biopsy.

40|$|The United States {{is in an}} {{affordable}} housing crisis; the problem is particularly acute in Massachusetts. Local zoning—especially {{in the form of}} density controls—is probably the most significant cause of the crisis. To mitigate the power of local zoning Massachusetts passed the Comprehensive Permit Law, which allows local zoning boards of appeals to <b>override</b> <b>local</b> zoning if certain requirements are met. One of those requirements, a government subsidy to the developer, has in some instances hindered the construction of affordable housing. Typically, a subsidy is required as an incentive to builders; otherwise their projects would not be profitable enough for them. In localities where real estate values are high, however, a density bonus (being able to develop more units on the same piece of land) may be enough to incentivize builders. In areas where subsidies are not necessary, project oversight, now largely performed by subsidizing agencies, should be performed by the Department of Housing and Community Development or local housing authorities...|$|R

40|$|In eukaryotes, the {{location}} of a gene on the chro-mosome is known to affect its expression, but such position effects are poorly understood in bacteria. Here, using Escherichia coli K- 12, we demonstrate that expression of a reporter gene cassette, com-prised of the model E. coli lac promoter driving ex-pression of gfp, varies by∼ 300 -fold depending on its precise position on the chromosome. At some posi-tions, expression was more than 3 -fold higher than at the natural lac promoter locus, whereas at several other locations, the reporter cassette was completely silenced: effectively <b>overriding</b> <b>local</b> lac promoter control. These effects were not due to differences in gene copy number, caused by partially replicated genomes. Rather, the differences in gene expression occur predominantly at the level of transcription and are mediated by several different features that are in-volved in chromosome organization.
