40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the role of}} the T cell antigen receptor (TcR) in control of T cell migration in an in vitro system. We used T cells from transgenic mice bearing a TcR for the <b>lysozyme</b> <b>peptide</b> 48 - 62 bound to I-A(k) (3 A 9). T cells from the 3 A 9 TcR transgenic mice crawled on purified intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 substrates, but strikingly, stopped upon interaction with the physiological ligand, i. e., the mouse I-A(k) with covalently attached hen egg white <b>lysozyme</b> <b>peptide</b> residues 48 - 62 complex. TcR-triggered stopping was reversible by treatment with adhesion-strengthening phorbol esters. The microtubule organizing center of stopped cells was positioned adjacent to the site of stable cell anchorage. Direct conversion of lymphocyte function associated- 1 to the high-affinity conformation with antibodies also stopped T cells in a similar manner to antigen. Thus, physiological TcR engagement triggers a stop signal through lymphocyte function associated- 1. We propose that the stop signal is an early and essential event in T cell activation that also will {{play an important role in}} control of T cell migration...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} the direct binding of a hen egg white <b>lysozyme</b> <b>peptide,</b> HEL(46 - 61), to membrane I-Ak (protein encoded in the A locus of the I region) molecules {{in the presence}} of detergent. A number of synthetic peptide derivatives, which did not stimulate our T-cell reactive hybridomas, competed for the binding of HEL(46 - 61) to I-Ak and also inhibited the functional presentation of HEL(46 - 61). Inhibitors included a peptide lacking a tyrosine at position 53 and a peptide corresponding to the autologous <b>lysozyme</b> <b>peptide.</b> Presentation was examined with cells or with supported planar phospholipid membranes bearing only I-Ak and HEL(46 - 61). Other peptides that did not compete for the binding did not inhibit functional presentation. We concluded that the binding of an immunogenic peptide to I-A is critical for presentation, that the I-A molecule does not discriminate between autologous and foreign related determinants but does recognize structurally different peptides. Our evidence suggests that our immunogenic peptide bears noncontiguous amino acids critical for contact I-A binding interspersed with amino acids critical for interaction with T cells...|$|E
40|$|The binding of 125 I-labeled {{immunogenic}} peptides to purified Ia {{molecules in}} detergent solution was examined by equilibrium dialysis. We used the chicken ovalbumin peptide ovalbumin-(323 - 339) -Tyr, which is immunogenic in the BALB/c mouse and restricted to I-Ad. 125 I-labeled ovalbumin-(323 - 339) -Tyr {{was shown to}} bind to I-Ad but not to I-Ed, I-Ek, or I-Ak. This binding was inhibited by unlabeled ovalbumin-(323 - 339) but not by ovalbumin-(329 - 339), which is the longest N-terminally truncated peptide that fails to stimulate any of the I-Ad-restricted hybridomas {{that have been raised}} to ovalbumin-(323 - 339) -Tyr. As a further specificity control, we also used the chicken egg <b>lysozyme</b> <b>peptide</b> Tyr-(46 - 61), which has recently been studied by similar methods [Babbitt, B. P., Allen, P. M., Matsueda, G., Haber, E. & Unanue, E. R. (1985) Nature (London) 317, 359 - 361]. We have confirmed that it bound to I-Ak but not to I-Ek, I-Ad, or I-Ed. Thus, a specific interaction between Ia and antigen that correlates with the major histocompatibility complex restriction was demonstrated, strongly arguing in favor of a determinant selection hypothesis for such restriction...|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} realize rhLZ {{secreted}} into chicken cells, human <b>lysozyme</b> signal <b>peptide</b> {{was replaced by}} chicken <b>lysozyme</b> signal <b>peptide.</b> It was confirmed that chicken signal peptide could direct rhLZ secretion into chickens. In this study, we obtained transgenic chickens expressing bioactive human lysozyme to an amount of 29.9  μg/mL with excluded gene silence and inhibition that usually happen in transgenic chickens prepared by lentiviral vector (Mizuarai et al. 2001). The expression levels of rhLZ were different among individuals, probably resulting from position effects caused by chromosomal location of the transgene insertion (Dobie et al. 1996; Kong et al. 2009; Robertson et al. 1995). Therefore, selecting of transgenic chickens expressing rhLZ of high levels {{will be available for}} commercial production.|$|R
40|$|Protein {{oxidation}} {{can have}} major implications {{on the quality}} and safety of foods, {{but the majority of}} methods to evaluate oxidative damage lack specificity. Therefore, this study aimed to identify specific markers for protein oxidation. A wellcharacterized protein, lysozyme, was modified by photo-oxidation and subsequently hydrolyzed prior to peptide analysis by LCTOF-MS. A semiquantitative analysis of the peptides indicated that from the seven peptides containing sensitive amino acids, two peptides (HGLDNYR and WWCNDGR) were highly affected upon photo-oxidation and have the potential to serve as markers for protein oxidation. Site-specific modifications enabled the description of the degradation pathway of several <b>lysozyme</b> <b>peptides</b> but also indicated that the surrounding amino acids and the 3 D structure of the protein {{have an impact on the}} induced modifications. It is therefore advisable to evaluate protein oxidation on the intact protein...|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{interaction}} of six photoreactive conjugates of the immunogenic hen egg-white <b>lysozyme</b> <b>peptides</b> HEL(46 - 61) or HEL(49 - 61) with the murine histocompatibility class II molecules I-Ak, I-Ad, I-Ek, and I-Ed. All compounds tested selectively labeled the alpha chain of the class II molecules. This was true when testing class II molecules on cell membranes or solubilized in detergents. The COOH-terminal conjugate of HEL(49 - 61) with (4 -azidobenzoyl) cystine preferentially labeled I-Ak. However, addition of hydroxyl or iodine substituents to the photoreactive moiety increased the labeling efficiency and resulted in labeling of the other class II molecules. The {{data suggest that the}} photoreactive groups enhanced the binding affinities of these peptides to class II molecules, reflected by the increased labeling efficiencies. Conversely, introduction of an iodine substitution into the tyrosine residue of HEL(46 - 61) or HEL(49 - 61) strongly decreased the photoaffinity labeling, possibly due to steric interference with ligand binding to class II molecules. Judicious use of photoaffinity probes that conserve binding specificity of the peptide should be useful for mapping the antigen-binding site of a class II molecule...|$|R
40|$|The alpha beta T-cell {{receptor}} (TCR) recognizes antigenic peptides {{bound to}} {{major histocompatibility complex}} (MHC) molecules. In contrast to the antibody combining site, for which the antigen contact or complementarity-determining residues (CDRs) have been precisely defined, the location and function of the corresponding CDR regions of the alpha and beta TCR chains are not known. To develop a model system for systematic analysis of the CDRs of the alpha beta TCR, we isolated a panel of murine T-cell clones that recognize a <b>lysozyme</b> <b>peptide</b> containing residues 74 - 88 bound to either Ab or Abm- 12 MHC class II molecules. Although these two MHC molecules differ by only three amino acid residues within the A beta chain, each of the T-cell clones was specific for peptide bound to the self-MHC molecule and did not recognize the same peptide bound to the other MHC molecule. The structural basis for this exquisite ligand specificity of the TCRs was analyzed by isolation and characterization of alpha and beta chain genes from five closely related T-cell clones. Comparison of predicted amino acid sequences mapped the ligand specificity differences to residues present within the alpha chain variable region segment and the alpha and beta chain variable-joining region junction regions.

40|$|The self-mouse <b>lysozyme</b> <b>peptide</b> {{corresponding}} to residues 46 - 62 (ML 46 - 62) binds {{to the major}} histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules I-A k and it selectively inhibits, when coinjected with antigen, priming of I-Ak-restricted, antigen-specific T cells. We demonstrate that administration of ML 46 - 62 also inhibits in vivo antibody responses induced by I-A k-restricted T helper cells. ML 46 - 62 is able to prevent the primary anti-hen egg white lysozyme (HEL) antibody response induced by the entire HEL molecule in B 10. A(4 R) mice, expressing only I-A k molecules, but not in mice of H- 2 a haplotype. ML 46 - 62 also strongly decreases, in B 10. A(4 R) mice, the antibody response to ribonuclease A, a protein antigen unrelated to the MHC blocker, indicating that MHC blockade is the mechanism leading to inhibition of antibody response. This is further supported by the concomitant decrease, in vivo, of complex formation between immunodominant HEL peptides and I-A k molecules, preventing I-AL-restricted T cell induction. Administration of ML 46 - 62 after antigen priming does not affect ongoing antibody responses, as expected from MHC blockade. A single injection of ML 46 - 62 {{at the time of}} protein antigen priming precludes not only the primary, but also the secondary antibody response to a subsequent challenge with soluble protein, even when the challenge is performed several month...|$|E

50|$|Lipoteichoic acid (LTA) {{is a major}} {{constituent}} of the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria.

The structure of LTA varies between the different species of Gram positive bacteria and may contain long chains of ribitol or glycerol phosphate. LTA is anchored to the cell membrane via a diacylglycerol. It acts as regulator of autolytic wall enzymes (muramidases).

40|$|Human {{breast milk}} {{is the best}} {{nutritional}} support that insures the right development and influences the immune status of the newborn infant. However, {{when it is not}} possible to breast feed, it may be necessary to use commercial infant formulas that mimic, where possible, the levels and types of nutrients present in human milk. Despite this, some formula-fed infant develops allergy and/or atopic disease compared to breast-fed infants. Cow’s milk allergy can be divided into immunoglobulin IgE mediated food allergy and non-IgE-mediated food allergy. Most infants with cow’s milk protein allergy (CMPA) develop symptoms before 1 month of age, often within 1 week after introduction of cow’s milk-based formula. Donkey milk may be considered a good substitute for cow’s milk in feeding children with CMPA since its composition is very similar to human milk. Donkey milk total protein content is low (1. 5 – 1. 8 g/ 100 g), very close to human milk. A thorough analysis of the donkey milk protein profile has been performed in this study; the interest was focused on the milk proteins considered safe for the prevention and treatment of various disorders in humans. The content of lactoferrin, lactoperoxidase and <b>lysozyme,</b> <b>peptides</b> with antimicrobial activity, able to stimulate the development of the neonatal intestine, was determined. Donkey milk is characterized by a low casein content, with values very close to human milk; the total whey protein content in donkey milk ranges between 0. 49 and 0. 80 g/ 100 g, very close to human milk (0. 68 – 0. 83 g/ 100 g).

40|$|T cell {{recognition}} of foreign Ag/MHC class II complexes is sensitive down to approximately 100 complexes per cell or approximately 0. 2 complexes/micron 2. To {{better understand the}} physical basis of the recognition stage of Ag presentation, we examined adhesion of the lysozyme- specific T cell hybridoma, 3 A 9, to artificial bilayers containing covalent MHC class II/peptide complexes or adhesion molecules. Adhesion of 3 A 9 cells required a superphysiologic density of the MHC class II/peptide complex and was partly dependent on CD 4; cells adhered but did not crawl. No adhesion was observed to bilayers containing MHC class II molecules without the <b>lysozyme</b> <b>peptide.</b> Activated 3 A 9 cells adhered and crawled on bilayers containing ICAM- 1. The physical strength of contacts was tested with fluid shear. 3 A 9 cells adherent to bilayers containing MHC class II/peptide complexes shed their contact, which remained on the substrate and contained TCR. In contrast, 3 A 9 cells peeled from the ICAM- 1 bilayer, and held firmly on LFA- 1 bilayers; in a manner dependent on filamentous actin. When ICAM- 1 and the MHC/peptide complexes were combined, the 3 A 9 cells adhered tightly and spread, but did not crawl, on the bilayers and TCR clustered {{at the center of}} the contact area. Physiologically, the TCR is unlikely to directly initiate adhesion. TCR clusters formed with the assistance of adhesion mechanisms may have to be shed to allow de-adhesion, and this may contribute to TCR down-regulation...|$|E
40|$|The {{contribution}} of T-cell-receptor beta-chain diversity to the T-cell antigen-specific repertoire was investigated using single-chain T-cell-receptor transgenic mice. Animals that express the rearranged beta-chain gene from a T hybridoma with specificity for a hen egg <b>lysozyme</b> <b>peptide,</b> designated HEL (85 - 96) were analysed {{for their ability}} to respond to a panel of diverse antigens. Transgenic mice exhibited a significantly elevated response to HEL (85 - 96) which was shown to be due to an increased frequency of HEL (85 - 96) -specific T-cell progenitors. This increased frequency of specific progenitors resulted in the ability of transgenic mice to respond to the peptide in the absence of antigen priming. Conversely, transgenic mice failed to respond to any other antigen tested. Furthermore, this apparent deficiency was associated with a significant decrease in the frequency of antigen-specific T-cell progenitors in transgenic mice. Surprisingly, the ability to launch an alloresponse was unaffected by the exclusive expression of the transgene-derived beta-chain. These results indicate that beta-chain diversity is crucial for the ability of the T-cell population to elicit a rapid and robust response to the profusion of different antigen/major histocompatibility complex (MHC) ligands potentially encountered by an individual. Furthermore, these results suggest a lesser role for beta-chain diversity in contributing to allorecognition, and support a model in which the direct recognition of peptide-mediated conformational MHC forms is the major contributor to the alloreactive response exhibited by the majority of T cells...|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} the {{bacterial}} beta-galactosidase gene (lacZ) as a reporter gene for the rapid measurement of T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) -mediated activation of individual T cells. The reporter construct contained the lacZ gene {{under the control of}} the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) element of the human interleukin 2 enhancer [Fiering, S., Northrop, J. P., Nolan, G. P., Matilla, P., Crabtree, G. R. & Herzenberg, L. A. (1990) Genes Dev. 4, 1823 - 1834]. The activity of the intracellular lacZ enzyme was analyzed by flow cytometric measurement of fluorescein accumulation in cells loaded with the fluorogenic beta-galactosidase substrate fluorescein di-beta-D-galactopyranoside. As a model system, the T-cell hybridoma BO 4 H 9. 1, which is specific for the <b>lysozyme</b> <b>peptide</b> (amino acids 74 - 88) /Ab complex, was transfected with the NF-AT-lacZ construct. lacZ activity was induced in 50 - 100 % of the transfectant cells following exposure to pharmacological agents, to the physiological peptide/major histocompatibility complex ligand, or to other TCR-specific stimuli. Interestingly, increasing concentrations of the stimulus increased the fraction of lacZ+ cells, but not the level of lacZ activity per cell. Even under widely varying levels of stimulus, the level of lacZ activity in individual lacZ+ cells remained within a remarkably narrow range. These results demonstrate that TCR-mediated activation can be readily measured in single T cells and strongly suggest that, once committed to activation, the level of NF-AT transcriptional activity in individual T cells is independent of the form or concentration of stimulus. This assay is likely to prove useful for the study of early activation events in individual T cells and of TCR ligands...|$|E

40|$|The {{key role}} played by islet-reactive CD 8 and CD 4 T cells in type 1 {{diabetes}} calls for new immunotherapies that target pathogenic T cells in a selective manner. We previously demonstrated that genetically linking the signalling portion of CD 3 -ζ onto the C-terminus of β 2 -microglobulin and an autoantigenic peptide to its N-terminus converts MHC-I complexes into functional T-cell receptor-specific receptors. CD 8 T cells expressing such receptors specifically killed diabetogenic CD 8 T cells, blocked T-cell-induced diabetes in immunodeficient NOD. SCID mice and suppressed disease in wild-type NOD mice. Here we describe the immunotargeting of CD 4 T cells by chimeric MHC-II receptors. To this end we chose the diabetogenic NOD CD 4 T-cell clone BDC 2. 5, which recognizes the I-Ag 7 -bound 1040 - 31 mimotope. We assembled several constructs encoding I-Ag 7 α- and β-chains, the latter carrying mim or hen egg <b>lysozyme</b> <b>peptide</b> as control, each supplemented with CD 3 -ζ intracellular portion, either with or without its transmembrane domain. Following mRNA co-transfection of reporter B 3 Z T cells and mouse CD 8 and CD 4 T cells, these constructs triggered robust activation upon I-Ag 7 cross-linking. A BDC 2. 5 T-cell hybridoma activated B 3 Z transfectants expressing the mimotope, but not the control peptide, in both configurations. Potent two-way activation was also evident with transgenic BDC 2. 5 CD 4 T cells, but peptide-specific activation required the CD 3 -ζ transmembrane domain. Chimeric MHC-II/CD 3 -ζ complexes therefore allow the selective immunotargeting of islet-reactive CD 4 T cells, which {{take part in the}} pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes...|$|E
40|$|Neonatal {{exposure}} to antigen {{is believed to}} result in T cell clonal inactivation or deletion. Here we report that, contrary to this notion, neonatal injection of BALB/c mice with a hen egg <b>lysozyme</b> <b>peptide</b> 106 - 116 in putative "tolergenic" doses induced a T cell proliferative and an immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody (Ab) response of both T helper cell 1 (Th 1) - (IgG 2 a, IgG 2 b, and IgG 3) and Th 2 -dependent (IgG 1) isotopes. Upon subsequent challenge with the peptide in complete Freund's adjuvant in adult life, although this neonatal regimen suppressed proliferation {{and the production of}} Th 1 cytokines (interleukin[IL]- 2 and interferon gamma), Th 2 cytokine (IL- 5, IL- 4, and IL- 10) secretion was increased, and the serum levels of Th 1 - and Th 2 -dependent isotypes of peptide-specific Ab remained elevated. The in vitro proliferative unresponsiveness in Th 1 cells could be reversed by Abs to Th 2 cytokines (IL- 4 and IL- 10). Thus, neonatal treatment with a peptide antigen induces T cell priming including production of IgG Abs of both Th 1 - and Th 2 -dependent isotypes. Upon subsequent peptide exposure, the peptide- specific T cell responses undergo an effective class switch in the direction of Th 2, resulting in T cell proliferative unresponsiveness. Accordingly, this shift towards increased Ab production to autoantigen could be deleterious in individuals prone to antibody-mediated diseases. Indeed, neonatal treatment with a self-autoantigenic peptide from an anti-DNA monoclonal Ab (A 6 H 58 - 69) significantly increased the IgG anti-double-stranded DNA Ab levels in lupus-prone NZB/NZW F 1 mice, despite suppressing peptide-specific T cell proliferation. This adverse clinical response is {{in sharp contrast to the}} beneficial outcome of neonatal treatment with autoantigens in Th 1 -mediated autoimmune diseases, such as autoimmune encephalomyelitis, as reported by others. A Th 1 to Th 2 immune deviation can explain the discordant biological responses after the presumed induction of neonatal tolerance in autoantibody- vs. Th- 1 mediated autoimmune diseases...|$|E

Here, the events that lead to specific localization of diabetogenic CD 4 T cells into islets of Langerhans resulting in diabetes were examined. This was evaluated in two models, one in which T cells specific for a hen-egg white <b>lysozyme</b> (HEL) <b>peptide</b> were injected into mice expressing HEL on β cells and the other using T cells in the nonobese diabetic mouse strain, which develops spontaneous diabetes. Only T cells specific for β-cell antigens localized in islets within the first hours after their injection and were found adherent to intraislet dendritic cells (DCs). DCs surrounded blood vessels with dendrites reaching into the vessels. Localization of antigen-specific T cells did not require chemokine receptor signaling but involved class II histocompatibility and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 molecules. We found no evidence for nonspecific localization of CD 4 T cells into normal noninflamed islets. Thus, the anatomy of the islet of Langerhans permits the specific localization of diabetogenic T cells {{at a time when}} there is no inflammation in the islets...|$|R
40|$|The peak widths and {{relative}} intensities of the singly- and multiply-charged molecular ions appearing in plasma desorption mass spectra {{are used as}} a probe for the stability of molecular ions. Two <b>peptides,</b> <b>lysozyme</b> and lactalbumin, which have similar molecular weights and tertiary structures, but different primary structures and isoelectric points, were prepared in solutions of different pH, before adsorption to nitrocellulose foils. The peak widths of the resultant molecular ion signals were minimized near their respective isoelectric points, {{which is consistent with}} reports on the stability of their tertiary structures and/or enzymatic activities near the isoelectric point. Similar studies were carried out with the addition of glutathione, a matrix which has effects on PDMS spectra {{similar to that of the}} nitrocellulose surface...|$|R
40|$|The binding of a <b>lysozyme</b> and {{ovalbumin}} <b>peptide</b> to purified class II major histocompatibility {{molecules in}} detergents was increased {{by the addition}} of certain lipids. Natural lipids from B lymphoma cells enhanced the binding and so did phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, and cardiolipin. Phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingomyelin, and cholesterol had no effect. There was no major difference between the effects of a phospholipid and its lyso derivative. As studied with phosphatidylcholine, the increase in peptide binding was also dependent on the fatty acid composition of the lipid. The binding affinity was increased 10 - to 50 -fold in the presence of lipid {{as a result of an}} increase in the association rate while the off-rate remained essentially unchanged. Our results suggest that lipids, directly or indirectly, induce conformational changes in class II molecules that favor their peptide-binding property...|$|R
40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} {{simulations of}} four peptides {{taken from the}} hen lysozyme sequence {{have been used to}} generate models for non-native protein conformations. Comparisons between the different peptides and with experimental data for denatured <b>lysozyme</b> and <b>peptide</b> fragments provides insight into the characteristics of the conformational ensembles populated in these non-native states and the dependence of their structural features on the amino acid sequence. For the denatured conformers populated local contacts dominate in determining the properties observed in the trajectories, all four peptides showing similar characteristics. These include {{a significant increase in the}} number of main-chain O(i) -NH(i + 2) hydrogen bonds and hydrogen bonds involving side-chain groups, this increase compensating to a large extent for the loss of hydrogen bonds involved in helical or beta-sheet secondary structure in the native fold, and the generation of a population of collapsed states with local clusterings of hydrophobic groups. The hydrophobic clusters enable at least partial burial of many side-chains exposed by the loss of tertiary contacts on denaturation and provide models that may explain the experimentally observed protection of amides from hydrogen exchange and the existence of residual secondary structure in non-native species of lysozyme. The results suggest that this approach has an important role to play in aiding the interpretation of experimental data for conformationally disordered non-native states of proteins.

40|$|New PEG {{derivatives}} {{were studied}} for peptide and protein modification, based upon an amino acid arm, Met-Nle or Met-βAla, activated as succinimidyl ester. PEG-Met-Nle-OSu or PEG-Met-βAla-OSu react with amino groups in protein-yielding conjugates with stable amide bond. From these conjugates PEG may be removed by BrCN treatment, leaving Nle or βAla as reporter amino acid, {{at the site}} where PEG was bound. The conjugation of PEG and its removal by BrCN treatment was assessed on a partial sequence of glucagone and on <b>lysozyme</b> as model <b>peptide</b> or protein. Furthermore, insulin, a protein with three potential sites of PEGylation, was modified by PEG-Met-Nle, and the PEG isomers were separated by HPLC. After removal of PEG, as reported above, the sites of PEGylation were identified by characterization of the two insulin chains obtained after reduction and carboxymethylation. Mass spectrometry, amino acid analysis and Edman sequence, could reveal {{the position of the}} reporter norleucine that corresponds to the position of PEG binding...|$|R
40|$|Objectives High Ca {{content is}} one of the most {{important}} characteristic of dairy products, According to some Authors dairy products have a better Ca digestibility compared to plant foods and this characteristic has been related to the inclusion of Ca in the caseinophosphopeptides (CPP). Because ripening time and <b>lysozyme</b> can affect <b>peptide</b> pattern we decided to study the effect of these two factors on in vitro Ca digestibility. Experimental methods 20 samples of Grana Padano produced with lysozyme and 17 samples produced without lysozyme (total 37 samples), aged between 11 and 25 months were obtained from 2 different cheese-factories. In vitro Ca digestibility (dCa) was determined using the methods of Perales et al (J Agric Food Chem, 2005, 53 : 3721). Molecular weight (MW) of peptides was determined by exclusion chromatography and CPP were determined by HPLC-MS. Analysis of variance was carried out with SAS 9. 1 using GLM procedure of the SAS 9. 1. The correlation between variables was performed with the PROC CORR of SAS 9. 1. Results The dCa (...|$|R
40|$|Metazoans {{identify}} and eliminate bacterial pathogens in microbe-rich environments {{such as the}} intestinal lumen, however the mechanisms are unclear. Potentially, host cells employ intracellular surveillance or stress response programs to detect pathogens that target monitored cellular activities to initiate innate immune responses 1 – 3. Mitochondrial function is evaluated by monitoring mitochondrial protein import efficiency of the transcription factor ATFS- 1, which mediates the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt). During mitochondrial stress, import is impaired 4 allowing ATFS- 1 to traffic to the nucleus where it mediates a transcriptional response to re-establish mitochondrial homeostasis 5. Here, we examined the role of ATFS- 1 during pathogen exposure because in addition to mitochondrial protective genes, ATFS- 1 induced innate immune genes during mitochondrial stress that included a secreted <b>lysozyme</b> and anti-microbial <b>peptides.</b> Exposure to the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa caused mitochondrial dysfunction and activation of the UPRmt. Animals lacking atfs- 1 were susceptible to P. aeruginosa, while hyper-activation of ATFS- 1 and the UPRmt improved clearance of P. aeruginosa from the intestine and prolonged C. elegans survival largely independent of know...|$|R
40|$|Alterations and {{impairment}} of immune responses in humans present a health risk for space exploration missions. The molecular mechanisms underpinning innate immune defense can be confounded by {{the complexity of}} the acquired immune system of humans. Drosophila (fruit fly) innate immunity is simpler, and shares many similarities with human innate immunity at the level of molecular and genetic pathways. The goals of this study were to elucidate fundamental immune processes in Drosophila affected by spaceflight and to measure host-pathogen responses post-flight. Five containers, each containing ten female and five male fruit flies, were housed and bred on the space shuttle (average orbit altitude of 330. 35 km) for 12 days and 18. 5 hours. A new generation of flies was reared in microgravity. In larvae, the immune system was examined by analyzing plasmatocyte number and activity in culture. In adults, the induced immune responses were analyzed by bacterial clearance and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of selected genes following infection with E. coli. The RNA levels of relevant immune pathway genes were determined in both larvae and adults by microarray analysis. The ability of larval plasmatocytes to phagocytose E. coli in culture was attenuated following spaceflight, and in parallel, the expression of genes involved in cell maturation was downregulated. In addition, the level of constitutive expression of pattern recognition receptors and opsonins that specifically recognize bacteria, and of <b>lysozymes,</b> antimicrobial <b>peptide</b> (AMP) pathway and immune stress genes, hallmarks of humoral immunity, were also reduced in larvae. In adults, the efficiency of bacterial clearance measured in vivo following a systemic infection with E. coli post-flight, remained robust. We show that spaceflight altered both cellular and humoral immune responses in Drosophila and that the disruption occurs at multiple interacting pathways...|$|R
