Feral populations also occur in China, northern Australia, and Florida, USA as a byproduct of the ornamental fish trade.

5|$|Early 20th-century weight limits were enacted {{to protect}} dirt and gravel roads from {{damage caused by}} the solid wheels of heavy trucks. As time passed, truck weight limits focused {{primarily}} on gross weight limits (which had no prescribed limits on length). By 1974, bridges received special protection from increasing truck weight limits. The bridge formula law was enacted by the U.S. Congress to limit the weight-to-length ratio of heavy trucks, and to protect roads and bridges from {{the damage caused by}} the concentrated weight of shorter trucks. The formula effectively lowers the legal weight <b>limit</b> <b>for</b> shorter trucks, preventing them from causing premature deterioration of bridges and highway infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to lead {{can occur}} by {{contaminated}} air, water, dust, food, or consumer products.

Exposure at work is a common cause of lead poisoning in adults with certain occupations at particular risk. Diagnosis is typically by measurement of the blood lead level. The Centers for Disease Control (US) has set the upper <b>limit</b> <b>for</b> blood lead for adults at 10µg/dl (10µg/100 g) and for children at 5µg/dl.
