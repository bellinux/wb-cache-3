40|$|Background: Aseptic stem <b>loosening</b> {{following}} reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) is {{an uncommon}} complication. The majority {{of literature on}} RSA consists of case series with short follow-up periods. It remains unknown which factors contribute to aseptic stem <b>loosening</b> in RSA. Our analysis aimed to compare the incidence of aseptic stem <b>loosening,</b> humeral radiolucent lines (RLL) and revision for stem <b>loosening</b> between: 1) cemented and uncemented stems, and 2) different etiological subgroups Methods: In a systematic review 75 articles were included after assessment of study methodology and a meta-analysis of 1660 cemented and 805 uncemented stems was performed. We compared the incidence of aseptic stem <b>loosening,</b> humeral RLL, and revision for stem <b>loosening</b> between: 1) cemented and uncemented stems from cohorts with short (< 5 years) mean follow-up periods, long (≥ 5 years) mean follow-up periods, and all cohorts combined; and 2) different etiological subgroups. Results: The overall incidence of aseptic stem <b>loosening</b> was 1 %. When comparing cemented to uncemented stems, {{there was no significant}} difference in the incidence of aseptic stem <b>loosening</b> or of revision for stem <b>loosening</b> in both the short and long term follow-up groups. Humeral RLL were more common with cemented stems (15. 9 % versus 9. 5 %, p = 0. 002). The highest incidence of aseptic stem <b>loosening</b> occurred in the tumor subgroup (10. 81 %), followed by RSA as revision for failed arthroplasty (3. 66 %). No stem <b>loosening</b> was seen in the acute fracture or fracture sequelae groups. Conclusion: Aseptic stem <b>loosening</b> occurred more commonly in cohorts with long follow-up times (2 % vs 0. 8 %, p = 0. 01). There was no difference in the incidence of aseptic stem <b>loosening</b> or revision for stem <b>loosening</b> between cemented and uncemented stems.

40|$|Total hip {{replacement}} {{is a human}} surgical intervention {{with the aim of}} pain relief and function restoration, with a survival rate of ≥ 90 % at ten years. Currently, imaging techniques are the primary diagnostic and follow-up method, but are unreliable for early <b>loosening</b> detection. Vibrometry has been proposed as an alternative, more sensitive method for <b>loosening</b> diagnosis. Despite the fact that acetabular cups have a higher revision rate over femoral components, most of the existing vibrometry literature is stem related. A limited number of studies have examined cup <b>loosening</b> without defining the <b>loosening</b> level detected. Hence, the present study aimed to investigate the feasibility of detecting acetabular cup <b>loosening</b> using vibrometry, and to define the earliest <b>loosening</b> phase that could be accurately detected. Three objectives were devised to address this aim. Firstly, a simplified set-up with minimal boundary conditions utilising Sawbones blocks. Secondly, a complex bone geometry was examined by utilising a Sawbones hemi-pelvis, and thirdly a more clinically relevant experiment was tested by using a composite femur and hemi-pelvis. <b>Loosening</b> was demonstrated by a reduction in the fundamental frequency and an increase in the magnitude of the related harmonics. By quantifying the magnitude of the harmonics in relation to the fundamental frequency, {{it was found that the}} harmonic ratio would increase, corresponding to the degree of <b>loosening.</b> These findings support the existing vibrometry literature. In the first objective the minimum detected simulated <b>loosening</b> was 1 mm zone 2 <b>loosening</b> within the frequency range 2000 - 2500 Hz. For the second and third objectives this was 1 mm spherical acetabular cup <b>loosening</b> within the range 500 - 1500 Hz. Hence, the study suggests that vibrometry has the potential to diagnose early acetabular cup <b>loosening.</b> This study is therefore novel because it has defined the minimum acetabular cup <b>loosening</b> level that can be reliably detected, alongside the favourable frequency range...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Total hip {{arthroplasty}} (THA) is {{a commonly}} used surgical treatment of osteoarthritis {{of the hip}} joint. A frequent complication of THA is <b>loosening</b> of one or both components of the prosthesis. <b>Loosening</b> of the hip prosthesis is usually caused by mechanical (aseptic) causes but can also have an infectional (septic) cause. Both types of <b>loosening</b> of the hip prosthesis require a different surgical treatment. The treatment of aseptic <b>loosening</b> of the hip prosthesis consists of one operation during which one or both components of the prosthesis are being changed (1 -stage revision THA). Treatment of septic <b>loosening</b> of the hip prosthesis requires a more intensive treatment because first the infection has to be cleared. Previous studies showed that certain patient-related factors have {{an increased risk of}} aseptic or septic <b>loosening</b> of the hip prosthesis. However, no study has been performed into the difference between patient-related factors with aseptic or septic <b>loosening</b> of the hip prosthesis. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify patient-related factors that are associated with an increased risk of aseptic or septic <b>loosening</b> of the hip prosthesis. Methods: This retrospective cohort study consisted of 257 patients who underwent a revision THA between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2011 admitted to the orthopedic unit of the Martini Hospital in Groningen. After in- and exclusioncriteria, 161 patients were being included. Patient-related and surgical factors were derived from EPD and patient charts. Analysed patient-related factors included the 19 specific diseases that are used to determine the Charlson Comorbidity Index as well as the 30 most common chronic diseases according to the Dutch Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM). Uni- and multivariate logistic regressions were performed to identify patient-related factors related to aseptic or septic <b>loosening</b> of the hip prosthesis. Results: Of the 161 patients, 151 patients had an aseptic <b>loosening</b> and 15 patients had a septic <b>loosening</b> of the hip prosthesis. Analysis showed that myocardial infarction (OR, 7. 37; BI 1. 86 - 29. 20) and cancer (OR, 5. 25; BI 1. 65 - 16. 76) had a raised chance for septic <b>loosening</b> in comparison with aseptic <b>loosening</b> of the hip prosthesis. Overweight showed to be a raised chance OR, 0. 26; BI, 0. 07 - 0. 97) for aseptic <b>loosening</b> of the hip prosthesis. Also having a high Charlson score (> 5) in comparison with a Charlson score of 0 was a risk factor for septic <b>loosening</b> of the hip prosthesis. Conclusions: This study showed that patients with myocardial infarction or cancer in the medical history have a significant higher risk for septic <b>loosening</b> in comparison with aseptic <b>loosening</b> of the hip prosthesis. Overweight is a risk factor for aseptic <b>loosening</b> in comparison with septic <b>loosening</b> of the hip prosthesis. Also having a high Charlson score (> 5) is a risk factor for septic <b>loosening</b> of the hip prosthesis. ...|$|R

Aim {{of this study was to}} examine the prevalence of comorbid conditions and their influence on aseptic and septic <b>loosening</b> of a TKP in a Dutch population. Methods: Retrospective cohort study, which was executed at University Medical Center Groningen. Patients with aseptic or septic <b>loosening</b> of a TKP between January 2007 and December 2012 were included. Comorbid conditions were selected based on the Charlson comorbidity index and the 30 most common chronic diseases, as defined by the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM). Odds ratios for comorbid conditions were calculated using univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses. Results: Aseptic <b>loosening</b> occured in 50 patients and 13 had septic <b>loosening</b> of a TKP. Hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, overweight and obesitas were more prevalent in patients suffering from <b>loosening</b> of a TKP. Diabetes mellitus (OR 0, 1; p = 0, 040) was the only predictor for aseptic <b>loosening.</b> Predictors for septic <b>loosening</b> were pre-operative anemia (OR 6, 2; p = 0, 025) and overweight (OR 9, 9; p = 0, 071). Conclusion: Diabetes mellitus was associated with an increased risk of aseptic <b>loosening.</b> Pre-operative anemia and overweigh were predictive for septic <b>loosening</b> of a TKP.

40|$|Bolted joints {{are widely}} used {{in a variety of}} {{engineering}} applications where they are dynamically loaded with frequencies of vibration spread over a wide spectrum with the same general effects. When under dynamic loading, bolted joints can become loose due to a loss in clamping pressure in the joints. This vibrational <b>loosening</b> sometimes can cause serious problems, and in some cases can lead to fatal consequences if it remains undetected. Non-intrusive ultrasonic and image processing techniques were simultaneously used to investigate the relaxation of contact pressure and <b>loosening</b> of bolted joints subjected to cyclic shear loading. Three critical areas, the contact interface of the bolted component, the bolt length and the rotation of the bolt head, were monitored during <b>loosening</b> of the joints. The results show that <b>loosening</b> of bolted joints can be grouped into three stages: very rapid, rapid, and gradual <b>loosening.</b> The earliest stage of the <b>loosening</b> of bolted joints is characterised by cyclic strain ratcheting–loosening of the bolted joint during vibration without rotation of the bolt head. The higher the rate of relaxation at this early stage, the lower is the resistance of the bolted joint to vibration-induced <b>loosening.</b> Both the dynamic shear load and an additional constant shear load in another direction were observed to affect the rate of <b>loosening,</b> and at this early stage, a rise in the magnitude of the additional constant shear load increases the rate of <b>loosening.</b> Furthermore, the contact pressure distribution affects the rate of <b>loosening</b> at the bolted joint interface, as <b>loosening</b> increases away from area of high contact pressure...|$|R

40|$|Background: A Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) is a {{surgery in}} which the knee joint is {{replaced}} by a knee prosthesis. One of the most major complications after a TKA is a <b>loosening</b> of the knee prosthesis. The <b>loosening</b> may have a non-infectious (aseptic) or an infectious (septic) cause. There is knowledge about certain patient-related factors that increases the risk of getting an aseptic or septic knee prosthesis <b>loosening.</b> However, there is limited knowledge whether there are differences in patient-related factors of patients with an aseptic or a septic knee prosthesis <b>loosening.</b> If there is <b>loosening</b> of the knee prosthesis, depending on the severity of the <b>loosening</b> and the situation of the patient, the prosthesis will be replaced (revision TKA). A revision TKA is a heavier and major surgery than a primary TKA; the patient needs to be re-operated with all negative consequences that implies. It is proved that there are differences in physical functioning and quality of life after revision TKA because of an aseptic or a septic knee prosthesis <b>loosening.</b> However, the results in physical functioning and quality of life after revision TKA because of aseptic or septic <b>loosening,</b> vary widely. Purposes: The primary aim of this retrospective study was to investigate whether there were differences in patient-related factors in patients with an aseptic or a septic knee prosthesis <b>loosening.</b> The secondary aim was to investigate whether there were differences after mid-term in physical functioning and quality of life after revision TKA because of aseptic or septic knee prosthesis <b>loosening.</b> Patients and Methods: The patient-related factors of 61 patients with an aseptic (N= 32) or a septic (N= 29) <b>loosening</b> of the knee prosthesis between 2005 and 2012 were identified. Logistic regression analyze was used to analyze whether there were differences in patient-related factors between the patients with an aseptic or a septic knee prosthetic <b>loosening.</b> For the assessment of physical functioning and quality of life after revision TKA, the clinical outcome, assessed with the SF- 36 and WOMAC, of 24 patients were analyzed. Thereafter, the clinical outcomes between the group of patients after revision TKA because of aseptic knee prosthesis <b>loosening</b> (N= 14) were compared with the group of patients after revision TKA because of septic knee prosthesis <b>loosening</b> (N= 10). Results: Preoperative anemia and diabetic mellitus were found to be significant associated with the development of a knee prosthesis loosening; preoperative anemia was associated with an increased risk of developing a septic knee prosthesis <b>loosening</b> (OR: 15. 5 95 % B. I: 1. 61 - 149. 03), diabetic mellitus was associated with an increased risk of developing an aseptic knee prosthesis <b>loosening</b> (OR: 0. 03 95 % B. I: 0. 002 - 0. 56). Some (non-significant) trends also have been observed; both coronary heart diseases and hypercholesterolemia seemed to give an increased risk of an aseptic <b>loosening</b> of the knee prosthesis.
