Sodium bisulfite modified glycinin had higher surface hydrophobicity, which facilitated hydrophobic interations between molecules and aggregation of glycinin. The balance between hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic forces makes glycinin form unique chain-like structures.

40|$|Suspensions of {{commercial}} refined and bleached beech wood pulp (RBP) were further processed through mechanical disintegration (MD-RBP), chemical modification (CM-RBP), or through chemical modification followed by mechanical disintegration (CM-MD-RBP). Nanocomposites were prepared by compounding a poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) <b>latex</b> <b>adhesive</b> with increasing {{contents of the}} untreated RBP or the processed nanofibrils, and the resulting nanocomposites were analyzed by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The presence of cellulose nanofibrils had a strong influence on the viscoelastic properties of PVAc latex films. For all nanocomposites, increasing amounts of cellulose nanofibrils led to increasing reinforcing effects in the glassy, glass transition and rubbery plateau regions. At any given concentration, the CM-MD-RBP cellulose nanofibrils showed superior reinforcing potential, especially in the glass transitions of PVAc and polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH), and in the rubbery plateau. The untreated RBP fibrils that were only mechanically disintegrated showed higher reinforcement effect than those that were only chemically modified. Most interestingly, the reinforcing action of the CM-MD-RBP (at 5, 10 and 20 % concentrations) in the high temperature region was superior to {{the sum of the}} separate effects of the CM-RBP and MD-RBP, indicating a synergistic effect...|$|E

40|$|T his process {{consists}} of applying a 0. 005 inch clear plastisol top coat to a textured or smooth surfaced release paper. The plastisol is subse-quently gelled {{and can be}} printed at this stage. Gelation can be obtained at temperatures from 250 ’ F to 320 ’ F. The plastisol foam layer is coated directly onto the clear top coat and passed through an infrared or gas fired oven to gel the foam. This step is taken to avoid strikethrough of the foam plastisol when the fabric is laminated (1) to the foam. The fabric is coated with {{a thin layer of}} acrylic <b>latex</b> <b>adhesive</b> and is bonded to the warm gelled foam in the nip of a chromed steel and rubber back-up roll. The final &dquo;sandwich&dquo; laminate is passed through a tunnel oven and is expanded. The foamed laminate is then stripped from the release paper and can be embossed mechanically, if desired. The resultant product may vary from 0. 020 inches to 0. 150 inches in thickness depend-ing upon the time and temperature of expansion and the blow ratio of the foam composition.

40|$|Surfactant {{distributions}} {{in model}} pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) films were investigated using {{atomic force microscopy}} (AFM) and confocal Raman microscopy (CRM). The PSAs are water-based acrylics synthesized with n-butyl acrylate, vinyl acetate, and methacrylic acid and two commercially available surfactants, disodium (nonylphenoxypolyethoxy) ethyl sulfosuccinate (anionic) and nonylphenoxypoly(ethyleneoxy) ethanol (non-ionic). The ratio of these surfactants was varied, while the total surfactant content was held constant. AFM images demonstrate the tendency of anionic surfactant to accumulate at the film surfaces and retard latex particle coalescence. CRM, which was introduced here {{as a means of}} providing quantitative depth profiling of surfactant concentration in <b>latex</b> <b>adhesive</b> films, confirms that the anionic surfactant tends to migrate to the film interfaces. This is consistent with its greater water solubility, which causes it to be transported by convective flow during the film coalescence process. The behavior of the nonionic surfactant is consistent with its greater compatibility with the polymer, showing little enrichment at film interfaces and little lateral variability in concentration measurements made via CRM. Surfactant distributions near film interfaces determined via CRM are well fit by an exponential decay model, in which concentrations drop from their highs at interfaces to plateau values in the film bulk. It was observed that decay constants are larger at the film-air interface compared with those obtained at the film-substrate side indicating differences in the mechanism involved...|$|E

Sodium bisulfite modified glycinin had higher surface hydrophobicity, which facilitated hydrophobic interations between molecules and aggregation of glycinin. The balance between hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic forces makes glycinin form unique chain-like structures. Adhesive performance of glycinin dropped significantly at lower sodium bisulfite concentration and then increased as sodium bisulfite concentration increased up to 24 g/L. Excess sodium bisulfite was detrimental to adhesive strength and water resistance. High-molecular-weight aggregates were observed in unmodified β-conglycinin, but these aggregates were dissociated by sodium bisulfite treatment. Similar to glycinin, the thermal stability of β-conglycinin was improved by the modification. However, the denaturation enthalpy of β-conglycinin decreased significantly at high level of sodium bisulfite (36 g/L). The turbidity at pH 4. 8 also dropped extensively at the concentration of 36 g/L. The contact angle of β-conglycinin reached its minimum at 6 g/L sodium bisulfite on cherry wood and 24 g/L on glass. Morphology study proved that sodium bisulfite modification made the β-conglycinin solution more dispersed. At pH 9. 5, water resistance of β-conglycinin was improved to a small extent by 6 g/L sodium bisulfite. At pH 4. 8, adhesive performance was enhanced by 3 g/L and 6 g/L sodium bisulfite. High level of sodium bisulfite at 36 g/L reduced the adhesive performance of β-conglycinin drastically...|$|E
40|$|Strengthening and {{rehabilitation}} of structures are major issues worldwide. In most situations, strengthening is required {{when there is}} an increase in the applied load, human error in initial construction, legal requirement to comply with updated versions of existing codes, or {{as a result of the}} loss of strength due to deterioration over time. Fibre Reinforced Polymer 'FRP' strengthening systems are enjoying a great deal of popularity as a result of the unique properties of FRPs, namely, being lightweight, fatigue resistant and non-corrosive in addition to their ease of application. As the major bonding agent used in current applications are organic adhesives with low glass transition temperatures, it would be very beneficial if they are replaced with a cementitious (mineral) based bonding agents such as modified concrete in order to produce fire resistant strengthening system. Pilot testing conducted by the authors have shown that excellent bonding properties can be achieved using many types of cement based adhesives. The mixes generally include Ordinary Portland Cement with a Silica based very fine filler to reduce cement dosage and superplasticizer to achieve the required workability.

In this paper, we will discuss the fundamental factors that have historically prevented acrylic latex PSAs from achieving the cohesive strength of solventborne dispersions. We will also discuss new technologies (including traditional and nanotechnology approaches) that have helped bridge the waterborne-solventborne cohesive strength gap and have enabled the use of waterborne PSA products in adhesive applications formerly reserved for solventborne systems. Replacing Solventborne Technology: A Multi-dimensional Problem Achieving the balance of adhesive and cohesive properties has been a challenge for waterborne latex PSA technology; however, the medium to high-end specialty PSA products have many additional requirements for acceptable performance. These properties include resistance to water degradation, water-whitening, and heat and humidity. 0...|$|R

This research is on increasing the mechanical strength and physical properties of MDF using Natural Rubber Latex (NR) as an <b>adhesive.</b> NR <b>latex</b> has ability to increase mechanical properties of MDF by doing a chemical formulation itself.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{both the}} development of a sampling strategy and monitoring of seven typical construction/renovation activities for the types and concentrations of particulate, gaseous and microbiological contaminants that were produced. The activities were: prepared dry wall sanding, metal cutting, water-damaged drywall removal, ceiling tile removal, carpet removal/installation, painting, air duct caulking/sealing. Sampling was performed near each activity, at some distance from the activity to estimate spreading potential, and in supply air to determine background concentrations. In addition, ventilation/exhaust rates were measured or estimated, and temperatures and relative humidities recorded. In addition to samples, spot measurements were made with direct-reading equipment for particles in two size ranges and for total VOC, to provide more information on the spatial movement of contaminants, and on variations of concentration with time. The highest particle counts in both size ranges were associated with metal welding. TVOC concentrations associated with VOC-free carpet <b>adhesive,</b> <b>latex</b> paint and water-based duct sealant were all low. Very large quantities of mold spores were found in samples collected during removal of water-damaged drywall. High concentrations were also measured for three microbial VOCs that are typically associated with active mold growth. Sampling also produced evidence for release of mold spores during removal of old carpet and old ceiling tiles. For most activities, concentrations of emitted contaminants decreased with distance from the activity...|$|R
40|$|Waterborne {{adhesives}} for rubber to metal bonding {{have been}} available since 1990. However, published information about their formulation has been limited, as proprietary restrictions are exercised by companies. As a consequence, the way these adhesives interact with substrates has not been studied extensively. With the aim of investigating the effect the components of a waterborne adhesive have on rubber to metal bonding, fractional factorial and surface response methodologies of design of experiments were employed in this study. Twenty six formulations were prepared with a polychloroprene <b>latex</b> as the <b>adhesive</b> polymer. Viscosity, wettability and non-volatile solids content were measured with each liquid adhesive, while the mechanical strength was evaluated by applying a tensile mechanical stress over cured solid adhesive films. Adhesion properties were evaluated by using a single lap-shear test on metal to metal joints and a pull-out test on rubber to metal joints. The {{results showed that the}} components with the largest relative influence on cohesive and adhesives forces were tackifier resin, silicon dioxide and polychloroprene latex type. In order to better understand the contributions of these variables, mathematical models correlating them with the response variables were obtained. This study is valuable in explaining how, through statistical methods, a waterborne adhesive for rubber to metal bonding can be formulated with a reasonably low number of experiments. This study was supported by EAFIT University...|$|R
40|$|In {{the frame}} of a {{long-term}} study of biofilm formation in the marine environment, protein-coated amine latex microbeads were used as a simplified bacterial model, in order to elucidate the role of surface protein on adhesion to 316 L stainless steel. Bovine serum albumin (BSA), chosen as the model protein, was covalently immobilized to the amine latex beads using glutaraldehyde as cross-linker. The adhesion of BSA-coated latex beads to stainless steel was then examined under a well-controlled physico-chemical environment, using a shear stress flow chamber. The shear-induced detachment of beads was analysed by testing three different microbeads/stainless steel systems: bare latex beads, activated latex beads with poly(glutaraldehyde) and BSA-coated <b>latex</b> beads in <b>adhesive</b> contact with stainless steel. The suspending medium used for detachment was representative of seawater in terms of pH and ionic strength. Adhesion was quantified through two complementary parameters: the wall shear stress threshold needed to cause 2 % bead detachment (τW 2 %) and the wall shear stress required to remove 50 % of the initially adhered bead (τW 50 %). Zeta potential measurements, paired with protein quantification, indicated that the coating density was weak. Nevertheless, the BSA-coated latex beads promoted an increased adhesion compared to bare beads, which was demonstrated by higher τW 2 % and τW 50 % values (τW 2 %= 15. 9 ± 8. 1 Pa and 39. 4 ± 10. 7 Pa; τW 50 %= 41. 4 ± 7. 9 and 73. 5 ± 14. 8 Pa for bare and BSA-coated beads, respectively). These results confirmed the role of surface proteins on adhesion to stainless steel. The shear stress flow chamber and the associated method for bead coating were demonstrated to be a relevant approach to analyse nano-scale molecular interactions between biological and physical surfaces...|$|R

There are several types of nanoparticle inclusions with different structures: metal clusters, fullerenes particles and molybdenum selenide, Our research focus is on polymer nanocomposites with inorganic clay particles as inclusions, in particular we used sodium montmorillonite polymer nanocomposite. In our study, modeling and simulations of sodium montmorillonite (Na+-MMT) is currently being investigated as an inorganic nanocomposite material. Na+-MMT clay consists of platelets, one nanometer thick with large lateral dimensions, which can be used to achieve efficient reinforcement of polymer matrices. This nanocomposite has different applications such as a binder of animal feed, a plasticizing agent in cement, brick and ceramic, and a thickener and stabilizer of <b>latex</b> and rubber <b>adhesives.</b> In this study, sodium montmorillonite called Na+-MMT structure is built with the bulk system and the layered system which includes from 1 to 12 layers by using Crystal Builder of Cerius 2. An isothermal and isobaric ensemble is used for calculation of thermodynamic properties such as specific heat capacities and isothermal expansion coefficients of Na+-MMT. A canonical ensemble which holds a fixed temperature, volume and number of molecules is used for defining exfoliation kinetics of layered structures and surface formation energies for Na+-MMT layered structures are calculated by using a canonical ensemble. Mechanical properties are used to help characterize and identify the Na+-MMT structure. Several elastic properties such as compliance and stiffness matrices, Young's, shear, and bulk modulus, volume compressibility, Poisson's ratios, Lam? constants, and velocities of sound are calculated in specified directions. Another calculation method is the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP). VASP is a complex package for performing ab-initio quantum-mechanical calculations and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations using pseudopotentials and a plane wave basis set. Cut off energy is optimized for the unit cell of Na+-MMT by using different cut off energy values. Experimental and theoretical cell parameters are compared by using cell shape and volume optimization and root mean square (RMS) coordinate difference is calculated for variation of cell parameters. Cell shape and volume optimization are done for calculating optimum expansion or compression constant...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{serves to}} {{investigate}} how miniemulsion polymerization, {{as an alternative}} to the conventional emulsion polymerization, can be used to produce pressure-sensitive adhesives. The key advantage that miniemulsion polymerization offers is its droplet nucleation mechanism, where polymer particles are created in such a way that intra- and extra-particle diffusion resistance is maximized. This results in the in-situ production of populations of polymer particles with different properties. The main objective of this thesis was to create an adequately stabilized miniemulsion to create bimodal distributions of particle size or molecular weight for pressure-sensitive adhesives applications. The performance of pressure-sensitive adhesives is characterized by the quantification of an adhesion as well as a cohesion component. On the one hand, pressure-sensitive adhesives must be able to wet the surface and be able to flow under low stresses and on the other hand, they must be able to be removed from the surface and be able to dissipate energy. This leads to a conflicting set of properties wherein a compromise must be made in the final properties. In order to tackle this conflict, miniemulsion polymerization can potentially be used to create latexes with compensating properties at the nanoscale through the preparation of particles with different particle sizes and/or microstructures such as different molecular weights and copolymer composition. Our work started by investigating the influence of surfactant concentration, copolymer composition and chain transfer agent concentration on the resulting <b>latex,</b> polymer and <b>adhesive</b> properties of pressure-sensitive adhesives prepared with poly(2 -ethyl hexyl acrylate/vinyl acetate/methacrylic acid). It was found that a combination of an anionic surfactant (sodium dodecyl sulfate) with an ethoxylated linear fatty alcohol non-ionic surfactant adequately stabilized this copolymer yielding latexes with 43 wt. -% solids content and with a maximum change in the number of particles (Np) with respect to the number of droplets (Nd) of ∼ 6 %. Nevertheless, this copolymer showed considerable homogeneous nucleation in the water phase due to its water solubility, which unavoidably led to inadequate pressure-sensitive adhesives properties. The second part of the study employed methyl methacrylate as a substitute for vinyl acetate to produce a 2 -ethyl hexyl acrylate/methyl methacrylate/acrylic acid terpolymer. It was found that the surfactant mixture, sodium dodecyl sulfate/Disponil A 3065, was also able to stabilize this miniemulsion. The adhesive properties of films cast from this polymer system were systematically compared to those produced by conventional emulsion polymerization using a factorial design. Significant differences between the latexes (or films) produced by these two techniques were found due to their different particle nucleation mechanisms. The most significant difference between the films obtained was shown via a viscoelastic analysis. The analysis showed that miniemulsion-based films presented more entangled networks, i. e., larger values of Mw/M e (which is a measure of the entanglement density) compared to emulsion-based ones even though the weight-average Mw was generally lower for the latexes produced by miniemulsion polymerization. In subsequent work, a one-pot two-step miniemulsion polymerization approach was used to create poly (2 -ethyl hexyl acrylate/methyl methacrylate/acrylic acid) pressure-sensitive adhesives with well-defined and predictable bimodal particle size distributions or bimodal molecular weight distributions. The "in-situ bimodal" latexes produced using this approach were compared to monomodal latexes as well as bimodal latexes produced via conventional post-polymerization blending on the basis of their viscoelastic and pressure-sensitive adhesives properties. Finally, an exploratory study of the use of Atomic Force Microscopy to investigate pressure-sensitive adhesives performance was conducted. Atomic force microscopy was used to acquire adhesion-force curves to investigate the effect of monomodal and bimodal distributions of molecular weight and particle size on the adhesion force and energy at the nanoscale. In conclusion, this is a first attempt to engineer bimodal distributions of molecular weights and particle sizes using miniemulsion polymerization specifically for the production of pressure-sensitive adhesives. Our conclusions are broadly applicable to a large class of soft materials based on deformable polymeric networks such as adhesives, coating and paints. It is expected that in the future, production of latexes with concurrent multimodal distributions of molecular weights, particle sizes and compositions can be produced using this approach...|$|R
