40|$|The {{original}} {{concept of}} {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} {{was that of a}} rapidly progressive, often fulminant, fatal disease primarily affecting women in the reproductive age group. Subsequent observations, however, have revealed many additional and protean aspects of this disorder. The purpose of this report is {{to call attention to the}} onset of the disease in one specific group in which it is not often suspected, namely, patients in the sixth decade of life or later (1 - 8). Although the age range for appearance of the disease is from 2 to 73 years, most of the cases (75 - 84 per cent) occur between the ages of 10 and 40 years, the average age at onset being from 25 to 30 years. Despite the inclusion of patients aged 50 or over in statistical summaries of previously published series, there has been only 1 such patient reported in detail. Knopf and Castor (9) presented the case of a woman in whom, at age 66, joint pains, pleural effusion and thrombocytopenia developed in association with diagnostic findings in a <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> <b>cell</b> preparation. At the time of publication, the patient’s symptoms were controlled with minimal dosages of prednisone, aspirin and antimalarials. In the period 1950 - 1958, 5 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus whose disease became manifest in the sixth decade of life or later, were studied in the Hematology Section of the Department of Medicine at Temple University Medical Center.

The phagocytosis of necrotic cell material (PNC) assay parallels the well-known <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> <b>cell</b> test. In this study, we aimed to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of the assay and the relationship with clinical manifestations and disease activity in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Methods: The diagnostic accuracy for SLE diagnosis of the PNC assay was studied by cross-sectional assessment of blood samples from 148 healthy control subjects and a multicenter rheumatic group (MRG) of 529 patients with different rheumatic symptoms. A cohort of 69 patients with an established SLE diagnosis (SLE cohort) underwent longitudinal clinical and laboratory follow-up for analysis of the temporal relationships between PNC positivity and specific clinical manifestations. Results: In 35 of 529 MRG patients, 13 of whom had SLE, the PNC assay result was positive. Combined positivity of the PNC assay and anti–double-stranded DNA antibodies increased specificity and positive predictive value for SLE diagnosis to 0. 99 and 0. 67, respectively. In the longitudinal study, 42 of 69 SLE cohort patients had positive results in the PNC assay at least once. PNC assay positivity was associated with current hematological manifestations and could predict mucocutaneous manifestations. When combined with hypocomplementemia, PNC positivity preceded increased Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 score, glomerulonephritis, and alopecia. Conclusions: Serum-mediated PNC by polymorphonuclear leukocytes is commonly but not exclusively seen in patients with SLE. The PNC assay {{may be used in}} follow-up of patients with SLE and, especially in combination with other routinely assessed laboratory tests, may help to predict flares and different clinical manifestations, including glomerulonephritis.

40|$|The fine {{morphology}} of hematoxylin bodies [...] structures which, {{by light}} microscopy, {{are considered to}} be pathognomonic for systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> [...] is described in renal glomeruli.

The cytoplasmic components consist of a multitude of vesicles, vacuoles, degenerating granules, and glycogen. Hematoxylin bodies are usually contained within the bounderies of mesangial cells. A transition from circulating leukocytes to typical hematoxylin bodies could be demonstrated.

Vaccination of such mice with plasmid DNA vectors encoding these epitopes induced CD 8 � T cells that killed anti-DNA antibody-producing B cells, reduced serum anti-DNA antibody levels, retarded the development of nephritis, and improved survival. Vaccine-mediated induction of anti-V H cytotoxic T lymphocytes that ablate autoreactive B cells represents a novel approach to treat autoantibody-mediated diseases.

40|$|Autoantibodies {{are central}} to the {{pathogenesis}} of several autoimmune diseases including systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus.</b> Plasma <b>cells</b> secrete these autoantibodies, but the anatomical sites of these cells are not well defined. Here, we found that although dsDNA-specific plasma cells in NZB/W mice were present in spleen and bone marrow, a large number were in the kidneys and their number correlated with the serum dsDNA-IgG titer. We observed renal plasma cells only in mice with nephritis, where they located mainly to the tubulointerstitium of the cortex and outer medulla. These cells had the phenotypic characteristics of fully differentiated plasma cells and, similar to long-lived bone marrow plasma cells, they were not in cell cycle. In patients with lupus nephritis, plasma cells were often present in the medulla in those with the most severe disease, especially combined proliferative and membranous lupus nephritis. The identification of the kidney as a major site of autoreactive plasma cells has implications for our understanding of the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis and for strategies to deplete autoreactive plasma cells, a long-standing therapeutic aim...|$|R
40|$|Epidemiology is {{the study}} of the {{distribution}} and determinants of disease in human populations. Over the past decade there has been considerable progress in our understanding of the fundamental descriptive epidemiology (levels of disease frequency: incidence and prevalence, comorbidity, mortality, trends over time, geographic distributions, and clinical characteristics) of the rheumatic diseases. This progress is reviewed for the following major rheumatic diseases: rheumatoid arthritis (RA), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, osteoarthritis, systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus,</b> giant <b>cell</b> arteritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, gout, Sjögren’s syndrome, and ankylosing spondylitis. These findings demonstrate the dynamic nature of the incidence and prevalence of these conditions- a reflection of the impact of genetic and environmental factors. The past decade has also brought new insights regarding the comorbidity associated with rheumatic diseases. Strong evidence now shows that persons with RA are at a high risk for developing several comorbid disorders, that these conditions may have atypical features and thus may be difficult to diagnose, and that persons with RA experience poorer outcomes after comorbidity compared with the general population. Taken together, these findings underscore the complexity of the rheumatic diseases and highlight the key role of epidemiological research in understanding these intriguing conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalence}} and pattern of <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> (LE) <b>cell</b> positivity in diseases in Ile-Ife, Osun state {{was carried out}} between January 1999 and June 2004 (5 years). A total of 96 patients with different diseases were screened for LE cell using standard techniques. Of this number, 63 (65. 6 %) were females and 33 (34. 4 %) were males, their age ranges between 2 and 65 years (x 26. 5 years). Twelve (12. 5 %) were positive for LE cell within the period. Forty five (46. 9 %) were screened between January 1999 and December 2002 (4 years), 4 (4. 2 %) were positive for LE cell. Fifty one (53. 1 %) were screened between January 2003 and June 2004 (1 years), 8 (8. 3 %) were positive for LE cell. It was observed from the study that the LE cell positivity is on the increase due to increase number of requests especially from renal patients. LE cell positivity is also greater in females 7 (7. 3 %) than in males 5 (5. 2 %) and occurs more {{in the second and}} third decades of life. Key words...|$|R
