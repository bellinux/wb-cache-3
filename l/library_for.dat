5|$|Meridian {{is served}} by the Meridian-Lauderdale County Public Library, located {{at the corner of}} 7th Street and 26th Avenue. The city {{originally}} had two Carnegie libraries, both built in 1913 – one for blacks and one for whites. A group of women had formed the Fortnightly Book and Magazine Club in the 1880s and began raising money to build a <b>library</b> <b>for</b> the city. The books they collected and shared within the club were later the basis of the library collection for Meridian. With wide support for the library, the club enlisted Israel Marks, a city leader, to approach the national philanthropist Andrew Carnegie for funding assistance. The <b>library</b> <b>for</b> blacks was built at 13th Street and 28th Avenue on land donated by St. Paul Methodist Church, and the <b>library</b> <b>for</b> whites was established in a building originally owned by members of the First Presbyterian Church of Meridian, who sold it to the city on September 25, 1911. The African American library was the only <b>library</b> <b>for</b> blacks in the state until after World War I and is the only Carnegie library ever built for African Americans in the country. The two libraries served the city until 1967, when the institutions became integrated because of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, combined their collections, and moved all materials to their current location. The former white library was renovated and converted into the Meridian Museum of Art in 1970, and the former African-American library was demolished on May 28, 2008.|$|E
