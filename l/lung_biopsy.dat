25|$|Asbestosis resembles {{many other}} diffuse {{interstitial}} lung diseases, including other pneumoconiosis. The differential diagnosis includes {{idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis}} (IPF), hypersensitivity pneumonitis, sarcoidosis, and others. The presence of pleural plaquing may provide supportive evidence of causation by asbestos. Although <b>lung</b> <b>biopsy</b> is usually not necessary, the presence of asbestos bodies in association with pulmonary fibrosis establishes the diagnosis. Conversely, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis {{in the absence of}} asbestos bodies is most likely not asbestosis. Asbestos bodies in the absence of fibrosis indicate exposure, not disease.|$|E
40|$|Background: Sarcoidosis is a {{systemic}} granulomatous disease of unknown etiology. Lungs and lymphatics {{are the principal}} sites affected by this disease. The disorder is often not suspected by physicians. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective study done on 140 transbronchial <b>lung</b> <b>biopsies</b> received for histopathological examination in the Department of Pathology for 1 year in a multispeciality tertiary care hospital, in Delhi. Results: Out of 140 transbronchial <b>lung</b> <b>biopsies</b> studied, 13 cases of sarcoidosis were diagnosed histopathologically. In these patients a clinical, pathological, and radiological corelation was done. And a final diagnosis of sarcoidosis was given after excluding other granulomatous lesions. Conclusion: Transbronchial <b>lung</b> <b>biopsies</b> have become an important tool in the diagnosis of sarcoidosis in present time. Hence sarcoidosis {{should be considered as}} a differential diagnosis when dealing with granulomatous lesions in <b>lung</b> <b>biopsies...</b>|$|R

25|$|If {{the person}} has kidney failure or {{cutaneous}} vasculitis, a biopsy is obtained from the kidneys. On rare occasions, thoracoscopic <b>lung</b> <b>biopsy</b> is required. On histopathological examination, a biopsy will show leukocytoclastic vasculitis with necrotic changes and granulomatous inflammation (clumps of typically arranged white blood cells) on microscopy. These granulomas are {{the main reason for}} the name granulomatosis with polyangiitis, although it is not an essential feature. Nevertheless, necrotizing granulomas are a hallmark of this disease. However, many biopsies can be nonspecific and 50% provide too little information for the diagnosis of GPA.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} can {{be confirmed}} by the characteristic appearance of the chest x-ray, which shows widespread pulmonary infiltrates, and an arterial oxygen level (PaO2) that is strikingly lower than would be expected from symptoms. Gallium 67 scans are also useful in the diagnosis. They are abnormal in approximately 90% of cases and are often positive before the chest x-ray becomes abnormal. The diagnosis can be definitively confirmed by histological identification of the causative organism in sputum or bronchio-alveolar lavage (lung rinse). Staining with toluidine blue, silver stain, periodic-acid schiff stain, or an immunofluorescence assay will show the characteristic cysts. The cysts resemble crushed ping-pong balls and are present in aggregates of 2 to 8 (and {{not to be confused}} with Histoplasma or Cryptococcus, which typically do not form aggregates of spores or cells). A <b>lung</b> <b>biopsy</b> would show thickened alveolar septa with fluffy eosinophilic exudate in the alveoli. Both the thickened septa and the fluffy exudate contribute to dysfunctional diffusion capacity which is characteristic of this pneumonia.|$|E
500|$|Healthy {{for most}} of his childhood, he became {{extremely}} ill with pneumonia in December 1984. On December 17, 1984, during a <b>lung</b> <b>biopsy,</b> Ryan was diagnosed with AIDS. By this time the scientific community had studied the epidemic in great detail. Earlier that year that HTLV-III was identified and isolated by American research scientists, confirming the work done by French research scientists who called it LAV. A lengthy public battle to determine who should be recognized as the discover of the human retro virus delayed development of a test for what would later be called HIV. Ryan had apparently received a contaminated treatment of FactorVIII that was infected with HIV, as did thousands of other Americans with hemophilia and hemophiliacs around the world. At that time, because the retrovirus that causes AIDS had been recently identified, much of the pooled Factor VIII concentrate [...] was tainted. Blood banks and pharmaceuticals dismissed calls by the CDC to use a Hepatitis B test as a surrogate until a HIV test could be developed. Late plasma products were screen and heat treated to deactivate both HIV and Hepatitis. Among hemophiliacs treated with blood-clotting factors between 1979 and 1984, nearly 90% became infected with HIV and/or Hepatitis C. At the time of his diagnosis, his T-cell count had dropped to 25 (a healthy individual without HIV will have around 5001200). Doctors predicted Ryan White had only six months to live.|$|E

500|$|The {{diagnosis}} of DPB requires {{analysis of the}} lungs and bronchiolar tissues, which can require a <b>lung</b> <b>biopsy,</b> or the more preferred high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan of the lungs. The diagnostic criteria include severe inflammation in all layers of the respiratory bronchioles and lung tissue lesions that appear as nodules within the terminal and respiratory bronchioles in both lungs. The nodules in DPB appear as opaque lumps when viewed on X-rays of the lung, and can cause airway obstruction, which is evaluated by a pulmonary function test, or PFT. [...] Lung X-rays can also reveal dilation of the bronchiolar passages, another sign of DBP. HRCT scans often show blockages of some bronchiolar passages with mucus, which {{is referred to as}} the [...] "tree-in-bud" [...] pattern. [...] Hypoxemia, another sign of breathing difficulty, is revealed by measuring the oxygen and carbon dioxide content of the blood, using a blood test called arterial blood gas. Other findings observed with DPB include the proliferation of lymphocytes (white blood cells that fight infection), neutrophils, and foamy histiocytes (tissue macrophages) in the lung lining. Bacteria such as H.influenzae and P.aeruginosa are also detectable, with the latter becoming more prominent as the disease progresses. The white blood, bacterial and other cellular content of the blood can be measured by taking a complete blood count (CBC). Elevated levels of IgG and IgA (classes of immunoglobulins) may be seen, as well as the presence of rheumatoid factor (an indicator of autoimmunity). Hemagglutination, a clumping of red blood cells in response to the presence of antibodies in the blood, may also occur. Neutrophils, beta-defensins, leukotrienes, and chemokines can also be detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid injected then removed from the bronchiolar airways of individuals with DPB, for evaluation.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Idiopathic {{pulmonary}} fibrosis exhibits differential progression {{from the time}} of diagnosis but the molecular basis for varying progression rates is poorly understood. The aim {{of the present study was}} to ascertain whether differential miRNA expression might provide one explanation for rapidly versus slowly progressing forms of IPF. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: miRNA and mRNA were isolated from surgical <b>lung</b> <b>biopsies</b> from IPF patients with a clinically documented rapid or slow course of disease over the first year after diagnosis. A quantitative PCR miRNA array containing 88 of the most abundant miRNA in the human genome was used to profile <b>lung</b> <b>biopsies</b> from 9 patients with rapidly progressing IPF, 6 patients with slowly progressing IPF, and 10 normal <b>lung</b> <b>biopsies.</b> Using this approach, 11 miRNA were significantly increased and 36 were significantly decreased in rapid biopsies compared with normal biopsies. Slowly progressive biopsies exhibited 4 significantly increased miRNA and 36 significantly decreased miRNA compared with normal lung. Among the miRNA present in IPF with validated mRNA targets were those with regulatory effects on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Five miRNA (miR- 302 c, miR- 423 - 5 p, miR- 210, miR- 376 c, and miR- 185) were significantly increased in rapid compared with slow IPF <b>lung</b> <b>biopsies.</b> Additional analyses of rapid biopsies and fibroblasts grown from the same biopsies revealed that the expression of AGO 1 and AGO 2 (essential components of the miRNA processing RISC complex) were lower compared with either slow or normal <b>lung</b> <b>biopsies</b> and fibroblasts. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the development and/or clinical progression of IPF might be the consequence of aberrant miRNA processing...|$|R

40|$|SummaryRationaleThe {{prognostic}} {{significance of}} fibroblast foci in surgical <b>lung</b> <b>biopsies</b> from patients with {{idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis}} (IPF) is unclear. ObjectivesWe assessed the relationship between profusion of fibroblast foci and survival in 43 patients with IPF seen at a tertiary referral medical center from 1996 to 2002. MethodsFibroblast foci in surgical <b>lung</b> <b>biopsies</b> were counted using a systematic morphometric point-counting technique. Patients with either clinical or pathologic evidence of accelerated disease were excluded from analysis. The association of fibroblast counts with survival was assessed using proportional hazards regression. ResultsThe mean age (±SD) of the study population was 64 ± 9 years; 26 (60 %) patients were male. The mean (%±SD) profusion of fibroblastic foci was 0. 6 ± 0. 7, expressed {{as a percentage of}} total points counted. Fibroblast foci counts did not differ markedly between upper, middle, and lower lobes. Median survival from the time of biopsy was 2. 4 years; there were 25 (58 %) deaths in the follow up period. There was no significant relationship between profusion of fibroblast foci and survival in the overall group (p= 0. 250). ConclusionsHigher prevalence of fibroblast foci assessed using a simple point-counting technique applied to surgical <b>lung</b> <b>biopsies</b> is not associated with survival in patients with clinically stable IPF...|$|R
40|$|Background:Progression of non-small cell {{lung cancer}} (NSCLC) from early- to late-stage may signify the {{accumulation}} of gene mutations. An advanced-stage tumor's mutation profile may also have prognostic value, guiding treatment decisions. Mutation detection of multiple genes is limited by the low amount of deoxyribonucleic acid extracted from low-volume diagnostic <b>lung</b> <b>biopsies.</b> We explored whole genome amplification (WGA) to enable multiple molecular analyses. Methods:Eighty-eight advanced-stage NSCLC patients were enrolled. Their low-volume <b>lung</b> <b>biopsies</b> underwent WGA before direct sequencing for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), KRAS (rat sarcoma virus), p 53, and CMET (mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor) mutations. Overall survival impact was examined. Surgically-resected tumors from 133 early-stage NSCLC patients were sequenced for EGFR, KRAS and p 53 mutations. We compared the mutation frequencies of both groups. Results:It is feasible for low-volume <b>lung</b> <b>biopsies</b> to undergo WGA for mutational analysis. KRAS and CMET mutations have a deleterious effect on overall survival, hazard ratios 5. 05 (p = 0. 009) and 23. 65 (p = 0. 005), respectively. EGFR and p 53 mutations, however, do not have a survival impact. There also {{does not seem to be}} significant differences in the frequency of mutations in EGFR, KRAS, and p 53 between early- and advanced-stage disease: 20 % versus 24 % (p = 0. 48), 29 % versus 27 % (p = 0. 75), 10 % versus 6 % (p = 0. 27), respectively. Conclusions:In advanced-stage NSCLC, KRAS, and CMET mutations suggest poor prognosis, whereas EGFR and p 53 mutations do not seem to have survival impact. Mutations in EGFR, KRAS and p 53 are unlikely to be responsible for the progression of NSCLC from early- to late-stage disease. WGA may be used to expand starting deoxyribonucleic acid from low-volume <b>lung</b> <b>biopsies</b> for further analysis of advanced-stage NSCLC...|$|R
