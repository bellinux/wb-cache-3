40|$|Prior {{research}} offers limited {{insight into}} the types of work experiences that promote <b>leadership</b> <b>skill</b> development and the ways that the person and context shape the developmental value of these experiences. In this article, the authors develop a series of hypotheses linking <b>leadership</b> <b>skill</b> development to features of the experience (developmental challenge), person (learning orientation), and context (feedback availability). Based on 225 on-the-job experiences across 60 managers, their results demonstrate {{that the relationship between}} developmental challenge and <b>leadership</b> <b>skill</b> development exhibits a pattern of diminishing returns.

5|$|After Khan's {{departure}} from Comilla, the cooperative's model failed in independent Bangladesh because {{only a few}} occupational groups managed to achieve the desired success. By 1979, only 61 of the 400 cooperatives were functioning. The model actually fell prey to the ineffective internal and external controls, stagnation, and diversion of funds. This prompted the subsequent scholars and practitioners in microfinance, such as Muhammad Yunus of Grameen Bank and Fazle Hasan Abed of BRAC, to abandon the cooperative approach in favour of more centralised control and service delivery structures. The new strategy targeted the poorest villagers, while excluding the 'less poor'. However, Khan's <b>leadership</b> <b>skills</b> {{during the course of}} his association with the project remained a source of inspiration for these leaders, as well as other participatory development initiatives in the country.|$|E

5|$|However, many of Quwatli's {{generation}} were unimpressed with Faisal's <b>leadership</b> <b>skills,</b> {{and were}} drawn to a republican, rather than monarchist, view of governance. Furthermore, they were suspicious of Faisal, and his brother Abdullah's ties with the British. On 15 April 1919 they founded a loose coalition {{under the name of}} al-Istiqlal Party ("Independence Party"). The party had a pan-Arab, secular, anti-British and anti-Hashemite outlook and attracted mostly youth activists from the elite classes. Well-known members, other than Quwatli, included Adil Arslan, Nabih al-Azmeh, Riad al-Sulh, Saadallah al-Jabiri, Ahmad Qadri, Izzat Darwaza and Awni Abd al-Hadi.

5|$|Satoru Iwata {{was born}} on December6, 1959, and raised in Sapporo, Japan, where his father served as a prefectural official.

With money saved up from a dish-washing job and some additional allowance from his father, Iwata purchased an HP-65, the first programmable calculator, in 1974. After entering Hokkaido Sapporo South High School in April1975, he began developing his own games during his junior year.

In retrospect, Robinson commented that at first, Duncan was reluctant {{to step into the}} void, still needing some time to truly develop his <b>leadership</b> <b>skills.</b> Statistically though, Duncan remained strong; after another convincing season with averages of 22.3 points, 12.4 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 2.7 blocks, he led the Spurs into the Western Conference Semifinals. There, they met the Los Angeles Lakers again, split the series 2–2, and in Game 5, Duncan made a toughly defended jump shot which put the Spurs ahead by one point with 0.4 seconds left to play. Despite the little time remaining, Lakers point guard Derek Fisher hit a buzzer beater for an upset Lakers win.
