5|$|Cinematographer Russell Boyd largely {{utilized}} available {{light to}} give the movie a natural feel, which Beresford said was crucial to its sense of authenticity. Harper said Boyd was so quiet during filming that he mostly used just three words: Yeah', 'right' and 'sure. Beresford, Foote and Duvall considered the climactic scene {{to be the one}} in which Mac, tending the family garden, discusses with Rosa Lee his pain over his daughter's death. Beresford and Boyd filmed the scene in a <b>long</b> <b>take</b> and long shot so it could flow uninterrupted, with the lonely Texas landscape captured in the background. When studio executives received the footage, they contacted Beresford and requested close-up shots be intercut, but he insisted on keeping the <b>long</b> <b>take</b> intact. Duvall said he felt the scene underscored Mac's stoicism in the face of tragedy and loss.|$|E
5|$|Each {{successive}} {{scene in}} the sequence was shorter {{than the one before}} it by exactly one frame. The scene where Bart writes his confession was done as one <b>long</b> <b>take</b> to balance the shorter scenes elsewhere in the episode. It was animated in the United States by Dan Haskett. There were a few problems with the finished animation for the episode. The banana in the opening scene was colored incorrectly, as the Korean animators were unfamiliar with the fruit, and the final bathtub scene was particularly problematic, including issues with lip sync. The version in the broadcast episode was the best of several attempts.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{took place}} {{throughout}} April 2009. Before it began, production designer Anthony Ainsworth partly reconstructed the Grid set {{to give it}} more of a concrete, underground bunker, feel. Though more television series in the UK are adopting high-definition cameras, the Spooks producers decided to continue using hand held standard-definition ones, which were more compact and flexible; the producers felt that using high-definition cameras would sacrifice the filming style of the series. For instance, a hand held camera would allow the crew to film one <b>long</b> <b>take</b> following cast members through tight spaces, like an average London flat. High-definition cameras would lose that ability.|$|E
5000|$|The set {{facilitated}} <b>long</b> <b>takes</b> {{in which}} conversations begin indoors, move outside to actual storefronts, and continue across the town square. Welles used <b>long</b> <b>takes</b> {{as a way}} to protect the integrity of his film, giving [...] "the great supercutter" [...] nothing to cut away to. The <b>long</b> <b>takes</b> are so subtle that they go unnoticed. At a time that a one-minute take was a rarity, Welles presents one unbroken scene between Kindler and Meinike in the woods that is four minutes long — longer than the bravura opening of Touch of Evil (1958).|$|R

5|$|The song debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at {{position}} 22 and thereafter declined. The track was promoted by a music video, which {{was directed by}} Marco Brambilla. The video features a <b>long</b> <b>take</b> of the camera pulling away from West. The video received positive reviews from critics and received two nominations for MTV Video Music Awards. West performed the song on Saturday Night Live, at the 2010 BET Awards, at the 2011 Coachella Music Festival, and his Watch the Throne Tour. When performing the song, West often wore clothes made from red leather. A remix of the track featuring rapper Jay-Z was released on August 20, 2010, {{as a part of}} West's weekly GOOD Fridays series.|$|E
5|$|The <b>long</b> <b>take</b> video {{begins with}} many people dancing on a hallway, until a girl comes and opens a door {{which leads to}} a room. There, other dancers are dancing to the song in midway of white rays of light, until the camera shows Jackson {{in the corner of the}} room and they start {{performing}} a dance routine. While the singer disappears from vision, people dance until she appears again dancing to the song. Then she goes to a hallway and enters a red-lighted room, accompanied by dancers, where entertainer Mimi Marks is seen. There she dances another routine along with her dancers. After dancing, she enters in another hallway where she gets alone with a man, until they share a kiss. Then, people who were in the previous room enter to the hallway to connect to another room, with Marks taking Jackson with her. The video ends with people coming closer to Jackson.|$|E

25|$|Tarkovsky {{worked in}} close {{collaboration}} with cinematographer Vadim Yusov from 1958 to 1972, {{and much of}} the visual style of Tarkovsky's films can be attributed to this collaboration. Tarkovsky would spend two days preparing for Yusov to film a single <b>long</b> <b>take,</b> and due to the preparation, usually only a single take was needed.|$|E
25|$|The film {{covers the}} period of previews leading to the play's opening, and with a brief {{exception}} appears as if filmed in a single shot, an idea Iñárritu had from the film's conception. Emmanuel Lubezki, who won the Academy Award for his cinematography in Birdman, believed that the recording time necessary for the unique <b>long</b> <b>take</b> approach taken in Birdman {{could not have been}} made with older technology. The film was shot in New York City during the spring of 2013 with a budget of $16.5 million jointly financed by Fox Searchlight Pictures, New Regency Pictures and Worldview Entertainment. It premiered the following year in August where it opened the 71st Venice International Film Festival.|$|E
25|$|The song {{peaked at}} number 13 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and hit {{number one on}} both the US Billboard Hot Rap Songs and Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs charts. The song has since been {{certified}} quadruple Platinum for four million digital sales in the US as of August 2016. A music video directed by Australian director Nabil Elderkin was released on June 6, 2012. The highly stylized video shows a <b>long</b> <b>take</b> of all four rappers featured on the song, along with other GOOD Music recording artists such as Cyhi the Prynce, Kid Cudi, Mr. Hudson and Teyana Taylor in cameos. The video features the rappers giving their verses and dancing around, with deliberate editing {{to make it appear}} as if they are disappearing and reappearing behind walls. The video received positive reviews from critics.|$|E

500|$|... "Rock with U" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics, {{with the majority}} lauding its retro, but futuristic sound, and commending the song's elements of house music. [...] The song had minimal success, only being able to reach the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles and the top-twenty of the Hot Dance Club Songs, although it did manage to make the Top 5 of the UK R Chart. Saam Farahmand directed the <b>long</b> <b>take</b> music video, which features Jackson having a party inside a club, with red and white rays of light entering the room.

The song received a music video directed by Australian director Nabil Elderkin released on June 16. The highly stylized video shows a <b>long</b> <b>take</b> of Ocean sitting around in a darkly lit room. Ocean performed the song during a show in New York City with alternative hip hop group OFWGKTA, and during his seven show tour through North America and Europe.

He {{wanted to make the}} video as a <b>long</b> <b>take</b> video, like the music video for previous single [...] "Feedback", which he also directed. According to the singer, the makeup looks and fashion of the video were a [...] "futuristic version of the Blitz Kids from the 80's". Dulduao commented [...] "I just wanted sort of bring Janet into the visionary style she's had in the past and I wanted to bring to like, video, and bring it back".

50|$|The {{film was}} quite revolutionary with {{its use of}} mystery to the audience; the characters, background, and {{location}} all go unknown throughout the entire film.

500|$|The {{episode is}} {{presented}} in four acts, each beginning in total silence and with a close-up shot of Joyce's pale, staring face. Shooting the first act was difficult for Gellar (Buffy). Whedon shot the scene where she finds her mother as one <b>long</b> <b>take,</b> showing her move {{through the house and}} calling the paramedics, about seven times. The rest of the scenes in the act were shot in sequence. At the end, Giles arrives and also attempts to revive Joyce, but Buffy blurts, [...] "We're not supposed to move the body!" [...] Both Gellar and Trachtenberg (Dawn) were raised by single women, and Gellar later spoke about the experience of acting something that was very real and close to her, stating, [...] "you try to separate it as best you can {{and at the same time}} it adds that extra layer". As soon as the scene was finished with Gellar [...] "at a fever pitch", they restarted it where she comes in the door happily, which Whedon regretted for the emotional range Gellar was required to endure.|$|E
500|$|The {{video is}} shot as one <b>long</b> <b>take,</b> {{shot in a}} mostly dark room. Ocean sits in the room, smoking an {{unspecified}} drug. Eventually, {{he gets up and}} begins to smear an unknown substance onto his face. Random shots of pandas and rain forest imagery are also spliced into the video, and it ends with Ocean being slapped by the ghostly image of a woman. MTV further summarized the video; [...] "Ocean is surrounded by ghostly incarnations of beautiful women, tigers and pandas. At one point, Ocean smears what appears to be novocaine — or Procaine — on his solemn-looking face." [...] Supposedly, it required several takes to achieve the correct angle for the slapping moment, and the spliced images were placed in the video because Ocean asked the director whether or not they [...] "can we put some kind of Asian-rain-forest stuff in there?" [...] Billboard wrote that the video was [...] "minimalist" [...] and [...] "eerie". Pitchfork named the video amongst the best of the year.|$|E
500|$|With filming {{completed}} in Rome, production moved to Mexico City in late March {{to shoot the}} film's opening sequence, with scenes to include the Day of the Dead festival filmed {{in and around the}} Zócalo and the Centro Histórico district. At the time, no such Day of the Dead parade like the one from the film took place in Mexico City; in 2016, due to the interest raised by Spectre and the government's desire to promote the pre-Hispanic Mexican culture, the federal and local authorities decided to organize an actual [...] "Día de los Muertos" [...] parade through Paseo de la Reforma and Centro Historico on 29 October 2016, which was attended by 250,000 people. [...] The film opens with a <b>long</b> <b>take</b> that joins six shots seamlessly, {{and was one of the}} few scenes that required previsualization. Through extensive planning, filming did not require motion control cameras. The scene joints were done in post-production through re-timing and re-projections, which even matched Mexico locations with interiors filmed at Pinewood.|$|E
