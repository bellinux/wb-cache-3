Since the benefits from MIMO result in a heavy computational load in detectors, the design of low-complexity sub-optimum receivers is currently an active area of research. Lattice-reduction-aided detection (LRAD) {{has been shown to}} be an effective low-complexity method with near-ML performance. In this paper we advocate the use of systolic array architectures for MIMO receivers, and in particular we exhibit one of them based on LRAD. The "LLL lattice reduction algorithm" and the ensuing <b>linear</b> <b>detections</b> or successive spatial-interference cancellations can be located in the same array, which is con- siderably hardware-efficient. Since the conventional form of the LLL algorithm is not immediately suitable for parallel processing, two modified LLL algorithms are considered here for the systolic array. LLL algorithm with full-size reduction (FSR-LLL) is one of the versions more suitable for parallel processing. Another variant is the all-swap lattice-reduction (ASLR) algorithm for complex-valued lattices, which processes all lattice basis vectors simultaneously within one iteration. Our novel systolic array can operate both algorithms with different external logic controls. In order to simplify the systolic array design, we replace the Lovász condition in the definition of LLL-reduced lattice with the looser Siegel condition. Simulation results show that for LR- aided <b>linear</b> <b>detections,</b> the bit-error-rate performance is still maintained with this relaxation. Comparisons between the two algorithms in terms of bit-error-rate performance, and average FPGA processing time in the systolic array are made, which shows that ASLR is a better choice for a systolic architecture, especially for systems with a large number of antennas.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we compare}} {{two classes of}} linear {{interference}} suppression techniques for downlink TDD-CDMA systems, namely, <b>linear</b> multiuser <b>detection</b> methods (receiver processing) and linear precoding methods (transmitter processing). For the linear precoding schemes, {{we assume that the}} channel state information (CSI) is available only at the transmitter but not at the receiver (i. e., ultra simple receivers). We propose several precoding techniques and the corresponding power control algorithms. The performance metric used in the comparisons is the total power required at the transmitter to achieve a target SINR at the receiver. Our results reveal that in general multiuser detection and precoding offer similar performance; but in certain scenarios (e. g, low BER requirements or use of random spreading sequences), precoding can bring a substantial performance improvement. These results motivate the use of precoding techniques to reduce the complexity of the system and the mobile terminals (only a matched-filter to the own spreading sequence is required without CSI). Moreover, it is shown that the proposed chip-wise linear MMSE precoding method is optimal {{in the sense that it}} requires the minimum total transmitted power to meet a certain receiver SINR performance.
