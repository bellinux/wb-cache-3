This paper demonstrates {{the advantages of the}} SiC bipolar junction transistor (BJT) by the realisation of a boost converter stage for photovoltaic (PV) systems. First the key attributes (on-state behaviour and switching losses) of the devices are reviewed. By this measurements, the driving circuits in the boost converter are optimized in order to achieve high efficiency.

40|$|Visible light {{communication}} (VLC) is {{an emerging}} technology that uses light-emitting diodes (LEDs) or laser diodes for simultaneous illumination and data communication. This technology is envisioned to {{be a major}} part of the solution to the current bottlenecks in data and wireless communication. However, the conventional lighting phosphors that are typically integrated with LEDs have limited modulation bandwidth and thus cannot provide the bandwidth required to realize the potential of VLC. In this work, we present a promising <b>light</b> <b>converter</b> for VLC by designing solution-processed CsPbBr 3 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) with a conventional red phosphor. The fabricated CsPbBr 3 NCs phosphor-based white <b>light</b> <b>converter</b> exhibits an unprecedented modulation bandwidth of 491 MHz, which is ~ 40 times greater than that of conventional phosphors, and the capability to transmit a high data rate of up to 2 Gbit/s. Moreover, this perovskite enhanced white light source combines ultrafast response characteristics with a high color rendering index of 89 and a low correlated color temperature of 3236 K, thereby enabling dual VLC and solid-state lighting functionalities...|$|E

From experimental data we provide an explanation to how light can be obtained at room temperature by a balance of the donors and acceptors. A steady-state recombination rate model is used to demonstrate that the luminescence in fluorescent SiC can be enhanced by controlling the donor and acceptor doping levels. A doping criterion for optimization of this luminescence is thus proposed...|$|E

This setup {{has the ability}} of generating highly chirped signal and idler pulses with compressed pulse durations below 600 fs and pulse energies of up to 250 nJ. At a fixed pump wavelength of 1040 nm, the emerging signal and idler wavelengths can be easily tuned between 867 to 918 nm and 1200 to 1300 nm, respectively, only by altering the cavity length. With compressed peak powers > 100 kW and a repetition rate of only 785 kHz, this source provides tunable intense ultra-short pulses at moderate average powers.

40|$|The {{structure}} {{and stability of}} Agn+ 3 clusters (n = 1, 2, 3) in zeolite Y and their photochemical properties are investigated. Silver-exchanged zeolites have potential technological applications as UV-to-visible <b>light</b> <b>converters.</b> The {{structure and}} stability of silver clusters were examined using the periodic den- sity functional theory (DFT), and employing a developed and programmed geometry optimization driver. Non-reduced silver cations are preferably lo- cated in 6 -member rings, far from each other. Upon a partial reduction, trigonal clusters are formed in the sodalite cages. The photochemical prop- erties are examined by various methods including the EOM-CCSD, MRPT 2 and TD-DFT. No charge transfer transitions from ligands to silver clusters are found. Instead, transitions involving d and s electrons on silver clusters fall in the visible spectral range. Our results contradict the previous sugges- tion proposing existence of linear silver clusters through a double- 6 -member ring unit. Both parts of our investigations (structural and photochemical) disprove this previous proposition. A new interpretation of experimental spectra is proposed-the reduced trigonal silver cluster is responsible for photoactivity of Ag-doped zeolites with a low silver loading.

The converter is a phosphor or scintillator material which is modified to block ambient light. The intensifier includes fiber optics input and output face plates with a photocathode-microchannel plate amplifier-phosphor combination. Incoming radiation is converted to visible light by the converter which is piped into the intensifier by the input fiber optics face plate. The photocathode converts the visible light to electrons which are amplified by a microchannel plate amplifier. The electrons are converted back to light by a phosphor layer and piped out for viewing by the output fiber optics faces plate. The converter-intensifier combination may be further combined with its own radiation source or used with an independent source...|$|E

40|$|Infrared plasmons in doped {{graphene}} nanostructures produce large {{optical absorption}} {{that can be}} used for narrow-band thermal light emission at tunable frequencies that strongly depend on the doping charge. By virtue of Kirchhoff's law, thermal light emission is proportional to the absorption, thus resulting in narrow emission lines associated with the electrically controlled plasmons of heated graphene. Here we show that realistic designs of graphene plasmonic structures can release over 90 % of the emission through individual infrared lines with 1 % bandwidth. We examine anisotropic graphene structures in which efficient heating can be produced upon optical pumping tuned to a plasmonic absorption resonance situated in the blue region relative to the thermal emission. An incoherent thermal <b>light</b> <b>converter</b> is thus achieved. Our results open a radically different approach for designing tunable nanoscale infrared light sources.

This system allows measurements of the flux density of the reactive NO-NO 2 -O 3 triad and additionally of the non-reactive trace gases CO 2 and H 2 O. For the NO 2 detection a highly NO 2 specific blue <b>light</b> <b>converter</b> was used, which was coupled to chemilumines-cence detection of the photolysis product NO. This NO 2 converter excludes known interferences with other nitrogen compounds, which occur by using more unspecific NO 2 con-verters. Photo-chemical reactions of NO, NO 2, and O 3 in-side the dynamic chamber were considered for the determi-nation of NO 2 flux densities, NO 2 deposition velocities, as well as NO 2 compensation point concentrations.

40|$|Cross-linked {{composite}} PDMS coatings containing luminescent micrometersized Ce doped Y 3 Al 5 O 12 garnet particles were prepared. The garnet particles were homogeneously and individually dispersed {{across the}} bulk of the cross-linked composite coatings, which is an important requirement for the potential application of these polymer-based <b>light</b> <b>converter</b> coatings. The thermal and optical degradation of the composite coatings was investigated by TGA and after exposure to high temperature (300 C) and high power visible light irradiation (150 W) for long periods of time, under air and atmospheric humidity conditions. The composite coatings were analyzed by SEM and optical microscopy after the heat and light exposure and no phase segregation, coloring or cracking was observed. Microscope-ATR-FTIR Spectroscopy confirmed the stability of the composite coatings during the exposure to high temperature and light in the visible range, but small structural changes were revealed in the cross-linked PDMS network, mainly due to the formation of additional cross-links. The cross-linked composite coatings emit white light upon irradiation with a blue light source, even after being exposed to the degradation test, attesting for their potential application in new solid state lighting devices, i. e. high power LEDs...|$|E
40|$|The {{nanoparticles}} of CH 3 NH 3 PbBr 3 hybrid perovskites were synthesized. These perovskite nanoparticles we {{embedded in}} polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) {{in order to}} obtain the composite, which we used as <b>light</b> <b>converter</b> for silicon solar cells. It was shown that the composite emit the light with the intensity maximum at about 527 nm when exited by a short wavelength (300 Ã· 450 nm) of light. The silicon solar cells were used to examine the effect of down-conversion (DC) process by perovskite nanoparticles embedded in PMMA. For experiments, two groups of monocrystalline silicon solar cells were used. The first one included the solar cells without surface texturization and antireflection coating. The second one included the commercial cells with surface texturization and antireflection coating. In every series of the cells one part of the cells were covered by composite (CH 3 NH 3 PbBr 3 in PMMA) layer and second part of cells by pure PMMA for comparison. It was shown that External Quantum Efficiency EQE of the photovoltaic cells covered by composite (CH 3 NH 3 PbBr 3 in PMMA) layer was improved in both group of the cells but unfortunately the Internal Quantum Efficiency was reduced. This reduction was caused by high absorption of the short wavelength light and reabsorption of the luminescence light. Therefore, the CH 3 NH 3 PbBr 3 perovskite nanoparticles embedded in PMMA matrix were unable to increase silicon solar cell efficiency in the tested systems...|$|E
40|$|Poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) {{cross-linked}} {{films with}} different concentrations of micrometer-sized garnet particles were prepared through hydrosilylation reaction between a di-vinyl-terminated PDMS and a four-functional silane cross-linker {{in the presence}} of a Platinum catalyst. The garnet particles, consisting of micrometer-sized Ce doped Y 3 Al 5 O 12 particles commonly used on <b>light</b> <b>converters</b> (for solid state light devices, e. g. Light emitting diodes LEDs), were homogeneously and individually dispersed through the bulk of the cross-linked films for a concentration up to 20 % in volume. The effect of the garnet on the cross-linking of the composite films was investigated by in-situ ATR-FTIR Spectroscopy. When formulations with an excess of cross-linker were used the overall consumption of Si-H groups of the cross-linker is slowdown {{in the presence of}} the garnet. The same effect was observed for an increasing concentration of the garnet. This effect is attributed to a strong interaction of the catalyst with the garnet during the cross-linking process. The possible origins of this interaction are discussed. NMR Imaging was used to investigate the cross-linked networks formed in the composite films. All the networks are homogeneous through the depth of the cross-linked composite films (approx. 5 Âµm resolution). The films prepared in the presence of the garnet particles showed similar relaxation behavior, regardless of the cross-linker concentration used in the initial formulation, contrary to previous results with PDMS cross-linked films. This behaviour is explained based on the presence of different type of chemical cross-links, resulting from the occurrence of hydrosilylation and secondary reactions, which are influenced by the interaction between the garnet particles and the catalyst...|$|R
