We introduce the method of a <b>linear</b> search <b>grid</b> to analyze GRB events with large sky localization uncertainties such as the localizations provided by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM). Coherent searches for gravitational waves (GWs) can be computationally intensive when the GRB sky position is not well-localized, due to the corrections required for the difference in arrival time between detectors. Using a <b>linear</b> search <b>grid</b> we are able to reduce the computational cost of the analysis by a factor of O(10) for GBM events. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our analysis pipeline can improve upon the sky localization of GRBs detected by the GBM, if a high-frequency GW signal is observed in coincidence. We use the <b>linear</b> search <b>grid</b> method in a search for GWs associated with 129 GRBs observed satellite-based gamma-ray experiments between 2006 and 2011. The GRBs in our sample had not been previously analyzed for GW counterparts.

We find no evidence for GW signals, either with any individual GRB in this sample or with the population as a whole. For each GRB we place lower bounds on the distance to the progenitor, assuming a fixed GW emission energy of 10 (exp - 2) Stellar Mass sq c, with a median exclusion distance of 0. 8 Mpc for emission at 500 Hz and 0. 3 Mpc at 1 kHz.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} problem arising in dense wireless networks {{is the high}} co-channel interference. Interference alignment (IA) was recently proposed as {{an effective way to}} combat interference in wireless networks. The concept of IA, though, is originated by the capacity study of interference channels and as such, its performance is mainly gauged under ideal assumptions, such as instantaneous and perfect channel state information (CSI) at all nodes, and homogeneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) users, i. e., each user has the same average SNR. Consequently, the performance of IA under realistic conditions has not been completely investigated yet. In this paper, we aim at filling this gap by providing a performance assessment of spatial IA in practical systems. Specifically, we derive a closed-form expression for the IA average sum-rate when CSI is acquired through training and users have heterogeneous SNR. A main insight from our analysis is that IA can indeed provide significant spectral efficiency gains over traditional approaches {{in a wide range of}} dense network scenarios.

40|$|Given the {{increasing}} importance of optimal sensor deployment for battlefield strategists, the converse problem of reacting {{to a particular}} deployment by an enemy is equally significant and not yet addressed in a quantifiable manner in the literature. We address this issue by modeling a two stage game in which the opponent deploys sensors to cover a sensor field and we attempt to maximally reduce his coverage at minimal cost. In this context, we introduce the concept of minimal sensor integrity which measures the vulnerability of any sensor deployment. We find the best response by quantifying the merits of each response. While the problem of optimally deploying sensors subject to coverage constraints is NP-Complete [3], {{in this paper we}} show that the best response (i. e the maximum vulnerability) can be computed in polynomial time for sensors with arbitrary coverage capabilities deployed over points in any dimensional space.

30|$|The {{problem of}} isospectrality {{in the theory}} of linear {{operators}} is deep and challenging. Its connection in context of discretizations was looked at in [2], featuring the concept of Wess-Ruffing discretization. In this reference, it was shown how isospectrality occurs in context of supersymmetric difference ladder operator formalisms. The concept of superpotentials was first reviewed where naturally the concept of isospectrality appears. Difference versions of the quantum harmonic oscillator on an equidistant grid were looked at, revealing the same equidistant point spectrum which the continuum quantum harmonic oscillator has. Next self-similar supermodels were addressed, showing a point spectrum which consists of basic versions of the natural numbers. These supermodels were related to discrete versions of Schrödinger operators, which exhibit - at least partially - the same type of discrete point spectrum. The concept of strip discretizations was introduced on basic <b>linear</b> <b>grids.</b> This type of discretization showed the typical point spectrum, consisting of basic versions of the natural numbers. Precisely the same type of spectrum was finally also found in case of so-called basic multigrid discretizations.

By doing so it is shown that the nodal conductance matrices GH and GV of the two sub-grids can be expressed as the Kronecker products GH = I-M circle times G(N), G(V) = G(M) circle times I-N, and G of the resultant planar grid as the Kronecker sum G = G(N circle plus) G(M), where G(M) and I-M are, respectively, the nodal conductance matrix of a <b>linear</b> resistive <b>grid</b> and the identity matrix, both of size M. Moreover, since the analytical expressions for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of G(M) - which is a symmetric tridiagonal matrix- are well known, this approach enables the derivation of the analytical expressions of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of G(H), G(V) and G in terms of those of G(M) and G(N), thereby drastically simplifying their computation and rendering {{the use of any}} matrix-inversion-based method unnecessary in the solution of nodal equations of very large grids.

We consider one aspect of grid design, choosing a <b>linear</b> <b>grid</b> within a distributed resistance cell model to optimize finger spacings at concentrations between 500 and 2500 suns under uniform and nonuniform illumination. Optimization for maximum efficiency under Gaussian irradiance profiles is done by SPICE analysis. Relative to the optimized uniform illumination designs, we find enhancements of 0. 5 % to 2 % in absolute efficiencies for uniform spacing. Efficiency enhancement with nonuniform spacing under nonuniform illumination is also evaluated. Our model suggests that, at lower concentrations (< 1000 suns), the penalty for using uniformly spaced fingers instead of nonuniformly spaced fingers is < 0. 1 %. However, at a concentration of 2500 suns the penalty increases to 0. 3 %. Thus, relative to a uniform irradiance optimization, an absolute efficiency increase of 2. 3 % can be attained for an optimized nonuniform spacing given the Gaussian irradiance profile under consideration...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Tidal streams {{are complex}} {{watercourses}} that represent a transitional zone between riverine and marine systems; they occur where fresh and marine waters converge. Because tidal circulation processes cause substantial turbulence in these highly dynamic zones, tidal streams {{are the most}} productive of water bodies. Their rich biological diversity, combined with the convenience of land and water transports, provide sites for concentrated populations that evolve into large cities. Domestic wastewater is generally discharged directly into tidal streams in Taiwan, necessitating regular evaluation of the water quality of these streams. Given the complex flow dynamics of tidal streams, only a few models can effectively evaluate and identify pollution levels.

40|$|Summary. We extend {{recent work}} on {{nonlinear}} optimal control problems with integer restrictions {{on some of}} the control functions (mixed-integer optimal control problems, MIOCP). We improve a theorem [25] that states that the solution of a relaxed and convexified problem can be approximated with arbitrary precision by a solution fulfilling the integer requirements. Unlike in previous publications the new proof avoids the usage of the Krein-Milman theorem, which is undesirable as it only states the existence of a solution that may switch infinitely often. We present a constructive way to obtain an integer solution with a guaranteed bound on the performance loss in polynomial time. We prove that this bound depends linearly on the control discretization grid. A numerical benchmark example illustrates the procedure. As a byproduct, we obtain an estimate of the Hausdorff distance between reachable sets. We improve the approximation order to <b>linear</b> <b>grid</b> size h instead of the previously known result with order √ h [14]. We are able to include a Special Ordered Set condition which will allow for a transfer of the results to a more general, multi-dimensional and nonlinear case compared to the Theorems in [20]. ...|$|E

Each RMC consist of two sets of widely spaced, fine-scale <b>linear</b> <b>grids.</b> As the spacecraft rotates, these grids block and unblock any X-rays which may be coming from the Sun modulating the photon signal in time.

Multiple RMCs, each with different slit widths, provide coverage over a full range of flare source sizes.
