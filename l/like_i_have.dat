You can have your child and you can still have fun and still be sexy and still have dreams and still live for yourself. I'm not embarrassed about it, and I don't feel <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to protect that side of me because I do believe that {{sexuality}} is a power we all have." ...|$|E

500|$|The mixtape samples {{songs from}} Radiohead, Coldplay, MGMT, Mr. Hudson and The Eagles, which Ocean sings over. Ocean, when {{uploading}} the album to iTunes, labeled it as bluegrass and death metal, out of arbitrariness. When asked {{about why he}} uploaded the songs in that way, he replied; [...] "I don't want to seem <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a cause against genres, or maybe I do... Bluegrass is swag. Bluegrass is all the way swag." [...] Ocean described the making of his mixtape as a labor of love, stating that [...] "It was like difficult to make. Not like writing the songs [...] arranging the songs. That had a level of difficulty, too. But just piecing together all the levels {{to do it at}} the level, the quality of records I wanted to make… But, it was a process I appreciate so much." ...|$|E

And he said—respectfully, I can't knock him for saying <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> this one feature, I think he was working on his own music as well so he didn't want to be on too many things. And I said, 'I totally respect that. I'm obviously not gonna get into any domestic anything. That's your wife.' But the record was 'My Love.' And it ended up being an interesting blessing in disguise because I think Tip for that record—I mean his verse is phenomenal." ...|$|E
500|$|In a November 2013 {{interview}} with Q, Lorde expressed frustration about [...] "certain things about music": [...] "There {{are a lot}} of shock tactics these days. People trying to outdo each other, which will probably culminate in two people fucking on stage at the Grammys." [...] Following the release of Pure Heroine, she also described herself as a [...] "sex-positive" [...] person, elaborating:People like to paint me in a certain way, but I'm a hugely sex-positive person and I have nothing against anyone getting naked. For me personally I just don't think it really would complement my music in any way or help me tell a story any better. It's not <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a problem with dancing around in undies—I think you can use that stuff in a hugely powerful way. It just hasn't felt necessary for me.|$|E

500|$|Paul Maurice Kelly [...] (born 13 January 1955) is an Australian {{rock music}} singer-songwriter, guitarist, and {{harmonica}} player. He has performed solo, and has led numerous groups, including the Dots, the Coloured Girls, and the Messengers. He {{has worked with}} other artists and groups, including associated projects Professor Ratbaggy and Stardust Five. Kelly's music style has ranged from bluegrass to studio-oriented dub reggae, but his core output straddles folk, rock, and country. His lyrics capture {{the vastness of the}} culture and landscape of Australia by chronicling life about him for over 30 years. David Fricke from Rolling Stone calls Kelly [...] "one of the finest songwriters I have ever heard, Australian or otherwise." [...] Kelly has said, [...] "Song writing is mysterious to me. I still feel like a total beginner. I don't feel <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> got it nailed yet".|$|E
500|$|Fellow {{songwriter}} Neil Finn (Crowded House) has said, [...] "There {{is something}} unique and powerful {{about the way}} Kelly mixes up everyday detail with the big issues of life, death, love and struggle – not a trace of pretence or fakery in there". Ross Clelland, writing for Rolling Stone, described Kelly: [...] "hile he was (rightly) lauded {{for his ability to}} sing of injustice without ranting, or deal with the darker sides of human nature non-judgementally, often overlooked was the fact he could write a damn fine melodic hook to go with those words". Tim Freedman (The Whitlams) acknowledges Kelly, Peter Garrett (Midnight Oil), and John Schumann (Redgum) as inspiring him by [...] " [...] our suburbs with our own myths and social history". However, Kelly has been quoted as saying [...] "Song writing is mysterious to me. I still feel like a total beginner. I don't feel <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> got it nailed yet". In 2007 Kelly donated his 'Lee Oskar' harmonica to the Sydney Powerhouse Museum. The museum's statement of significance cites Kelly's talent as a songwriter, his distinctive voice, and his harmonica playing, particularly on Live, May 1992.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked whether}} the album was thematically {{different}} from Fallen, Lee said that [...] "all of the negative and hard, difficult experiences" [...] that characterized the band's music still came across, but displays a less hopeless attitude. Rather than wallowing in [...] "the hard stuff", the record's theme reflects on looking for solutions and happiness. In an interview with MTV News, Lee said about the album's title: I feel <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{the ability to do}} a lot of things I couldn't do before, for a number of reasons......A lot of doors have kind of been opened in my life—not just since everything has happened for us. The singer also felt the band [...] "broke the doors" [...] and tried doing different things, which was also an inspiration for the title. Simon Cosyns of The Sun labelled the record's artwork—which sees Lee in front of an open door—as [...] " [...] the dark Evanescence image intact, with sinister fairytale scenes, elaborate Victorian gothic arches, illuminated typography and elaborate flowing dresses". Dane Prokofiev of PopMatters praised the album cover, calling it [...] " [...] gother-looking piece." ...|$|E

500|$|Several critics {{noted the}} album's {{extensive}} exploration of sexuality. Having been a singer {{since the age}} of nine, Beyoncé felt [...] "stifled" [...] by the perception she was a role model for young children, and now into her thirties, believed she had [...] "earned the right to [...] express any and every side of self". Addressing the album's sexual content specifically, the singer said [...] "I don't at all have any shame about being sexual and I'm not embarrassed about it and I don't feel <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to protect that side of me." [...] Several critics described Beyoncés sex songs as a celebration of monogamous love. [...] "Drunk in Love" [...] is a duet with her husband Jay-Z, and features lyrics heavily laden with double entendres that explore lust within their sexual relationship. It fuses intermittent trap beats with heavy bass, skittering synthesizers and drums, and Arabic-scale vocal arpeggios. Beyoncé's vocals are diverse, including a melodramatic chorus sung in her upper register and a half-rapped second verse. [...] "Blow" [...] veers from a thumping jazz beat created with sparse piano chords and guitars to a [...] "swinging electro-funk groove" [...] with elements of neo-disco. Its erotic, tongue-in-cheek lyrics include a running cunnilingus metaphor of [...] "licking Skittles" [...] in its chorus. The slow-jam [...] "Rocket" [...] is a homage to D'Angelo's soul-infused [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" [...] (2000). Described by Entertainment Weeklys Nick Catucci as a [...] "slippery, six-and-a-half-minute funk excursion", Beyoncé adopts a slow, harmonious vocal as she instructs her love interest to watch her perform a striptease.|$|E
2500|$|I don't feel {{helpless}} or anything. I don't feel <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to be like, [...] "I'm {{a female}} and I {{can do this}} if I want to", cause, of course I can. I already know that, and I never felt being female hurt anything. If anything, it helped.|$|E
2500|$|Defining {{the role}} and {{category}} of resultatives has inspired numerous approaches from linguists. Traditionally, certain tenses and aspects {{have been attributed to}} resultatives. Namely, the present perfect aspect is pointed to in explaining resultative constructions <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> written them a letter. There is a stress on the sense of completeness inherent in resultatives: [...] A: Have you cleaned the windows? [...] B: No, I haven't finished them yet.|$|E
5000|$|In {{an episode}} of Sex and the City, Carrie sees her old flame Mr. Big at the Opera. After {{storming}} out she thinks to herself [...] "I felt <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> just seen The Phantom of the Opera".|$|R

2500|$|Kirito is voiced in Japanese by Yoshitsugu Matsuoka and in English by Bryce Papenbrook. In an {{interview}} with Matsuoka on the similarities {{between him and his}} character, the voice actor opinioned that [...] "I'm thinking about our workplaces – in both of our workplaces, there's only one chance , so there's {{a lot of people who}} are putting in their all. I always think that I have to do the best acting I can for the sake of those who came to see me or watch the show. I feel <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to pull along people with my acting. I feel <b>like,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to pave the way for the others." [...] Many fans have asked Reki Kawahara whether there would be an eventual crossover between Accel World and Sword Art Online, to which he answered that while he had already written a scenario where Kirito and Haruyuki Arita meet and fight, such a prospect would be difficult due to SAO taking place in 2022 and Accel World in 2046.|$|E
2500|$|..... One {{morning as}} I was making my thanksgiving after Communion, {{a very strong}} {{distraction}} took hold of me. I thought I saw a great plain full of people enveloped in thick fog. They were walking about like people who had lost their way {{and did not know}} which way to turn. Someone near me said: 'This is England'. I was just going to ask some questions, when I saw Pope Pius IX just <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> seen him in pictures. He was robed magnificently and carried in his hand a torch alive with flames. As he walked slowly towards that immense gathering of people, the leaping flames from the torch dispelled the fog, and the people stood in the splendour of the noonday sun. 'That torch', said the one beside me, 'is the Catholic Faith, which is going to light up England'".|$|E

2500|$|After his nomination, Jackson {{received}} backlash {{for some}} of his past statements that have been perceived as derogatory to gays, blacks, and Democrats. Jackson and some observers have noted the challenge of differentiating between statements made in a ministry setting and those made in a political setting. Jackson said, [...] "I {{have been forced to}} clarify those views because they went back and picked out ministry settings where I talked about these things and brought them into my campaign. Then I feel <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no choice but to clarify." [...] Coby Dillard, a Norfolk Republican, observed that some of the criticism {{stems from the fact that}} commentary acceptable in a church setting is received differently in a political campaign. Jackson said that by critiquing his comments made in a ministry context, his opponents were trying to impose a religious test to say that anyone who takes a traditional view of the Bible is unfit for public office.|$|E
2500|$|Immediately {{after the}} speech MSNBC host Chris Matthews admitted, [...] "I {{have to tell}} you, a little chill in my legs right now. That is an amazing moment in history right there.

And the reason I say that is because I think the immigrant experience combined with the African background, combined with the incredible education, combined with his beautiful speech, not every politician gets help with the speech, but that speech {{was a piece of}} work." [...] Commenting the next day, Pat Buchanan, while complimentary towards Obama, was more critical of what he called a centrist speech: [...] "He is hiding what he truly believes. What does Obama believe about this war?" [...] On PBS, columnist David Brooks responded positively, [...] "This is why you go to conventions, to watch a speech like this," [...] while Mark Shields said, [...] "A star is born." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the second Test, footage emerged of South Africa's captain Faf du Plessis apparently shining the ball using a sweet in his mouth. He was charged by the International Cricket Council (ICC) for ball tampering and pled not-guilty. Hashim Amla said that the situation was [...] "ridiculous" [...] and [...] "a joke". It was suggested that a hearing would take place after {{the conclusion}} of the third Test, as Cricket South Africa (CSA) had engaged legal representation for du Plessis. However, on 22 November, du Plessis was found guilty of ball tampering, fined his match fee from the Hobart Test, but was allowed to play in the Adelaide Test. After du Plessis was found guilty he said he disagreed with the verdict stating [...] "I felt <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done nothing wrong". Du Plessis appealed the charge, but that was rejected on 21 December 2016. The initial penalties of losing his match fee and getting three demerit points stood, but he was not punished with a one-match ban.|$|E
