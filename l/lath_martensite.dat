The novel cast steel after various heat treatments was characterized by microstructure observations and mechanical properties measurement {{in order to achieve}} an optimal process correlated with good abrasive resistance for a long marine service. Differential scanning calorimetry and hardness analyses deduced a complete austenitizing temperature of 1 000 °C, based on the alloying element homogenization and defective structure elimination without grain coarsening. An optimal austempering process (austenitized at 1 000 °C, quick cooled for holding at 350 °C for 1. 5 h and then air-cooled to room temperature) produced a uniform mixture structure of fine carbide-free aciculate bainites and few <b>lath</b> <b>martensites,</b> resulting in the tensile strength increase of 34 % and impact toughness increase of 50 % compared with that of the as-cast steel.

40|$|Martensite is {{generally}} {{known as a}} hard but brittle microstructure. This is only true for high carbon plate martensite. Recently developed steels with a <b>lath</b> <b>martensite</b> microstructure offer an excellent toughness at yield strength of 1000 MPa yield strength. A transformation into <b>lath</b> <b>martensite</b> by glide as invariant shear mechanism is only possible at a carbon content below 0, 03 %. The source of both high strength and good toughness is the high dislocation density and the narrow lath width off less than 1 µm. By a thermomechanical treatment, {{that leads to a}} finer lath structure both strength and ductility can be improved to a yield strength of 1150 MPa and an elongation of 18 %.

Specimens in austenitic state were deformed in tension by several strains (true strain ε = 0. 1 ∼ 1. 0) at 773 K (which was above Md temperature). In the case of conventionally quenched (not-deformed) specimen, an austenite grain contained several packets and each packet was almost completely partitioned by parallel blocks. However, this morphology of packets and blocks was markedly changed when martensite was formed from deformed (work-hardened) austenite.

40|$|Fe-Cr-C alloys with {{chromium}} {{concentrations in}} the range from similar to 2 to 12 wt. % form ferritic-martensitic structures by rapid cooling from the austenite state already in the presence of relatively low carbon concentrations. In this process it is possible to obtain different ratios of ferrite and martensite, as well as formation of carbides, by varying the thermal treatment. The presence of ferrite or martensite might have an influence on the nanostructural evolution under irradiation of these alloys. Here, considering a tempered martensite reference alloy with 9 % Cr, we make use of an already validated object kinetic Monte Carlo (OKMC) model in order to study the possible effect of the formation of <b>martensite</b> <b>laths</b> on the material nanostructural evolution under neutron irradiation, assuming that the relevant boundaries act as sinks for radiation defects. The results show that the reduction of the grain size (including in this definition the average size of prior austenite grains, packets, blocks, and laths) does not play any relevant role until sizes of the order of similar to 0. 5 mu m are reached: for smaller grains, the number of defects being absorbed by the boundaries becomes dominant. However, this threshold is lower than the experimentally observed <b>martensite</b> <b>lath</b> dimensions, thereby suggesting that what makes the difference in martensitic Fe-Cr-C alloys with respect to ferrite, concerning events and mechanisms taking place during irradiation, are not the lath boundaries as sinks. Differences between the nanostructural evolution under neutron irradiation in ferrite and martensite should therefore be ascribed to other factors. (C) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
