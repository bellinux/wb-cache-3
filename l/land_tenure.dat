Soldiers' children were also forcibly enrolled, something that followed spontaneous tendencies among the rank-and-file, but also expressed increasing difficulties in recruitment.|$|E

40|$|We {{characterized}} wildfire {{transmission and}} exposure within {{a matrix of}} large <b>land</b> <b>tenures</b> (federal, state, and private) surrounding 56 communities within a 3. 3 million ha fire prone region of central Oregon US. Wildfire simulation and network analysis were used to quantify the exchange of fire among <b>land</b> <b>tenures</b> and communities and analyze the relative contributions of human versus natural ignitions to wildfire exposure. Among the <b>land</b> <b>tenures</b> examined, the area burned by incoming fires averaged 57 % of the total burned area. Community exposure from incoming fires ignited on surrounding <b>land</b> <b>tenures</b> accounted for 67 % of the total area burned. The number of <b>land</b> <b>tenures</b> contributing wildfire to individual communities and surrounding wildland urban interface (WUI) varied from 3 to 20. Community firesheds, i. e. the area where ignitions can spawn fires that can burn into the WUI, covered 40 % of the landscape, and were 5. 5 {{times larger than the}} combined area of the community core and WUI. For the major <b>land</b> <b>tenures</b> within the study area, the amount of incoming versus outgoing fire was relatively constant, with some exceptions. The study provides a multi-scale characterization of wildfire networks within a large, mixed tenure and fire prone landscape, and illustrates the connectivity of risk between communities and the surrounding wildlands. We use the findings to discuss how scale mismatches in local wildfire governance result from disconnected planning systems and disparate fire management objectives among the large landowners (federal, state, private) and local communities. Local and regional risk planning processes can adopt our concepts and methods to better define and map the scale of wildfire risk from large fire events and incorporate wildfire network and connectivity concepts into risk assessments...|$|R
5|$|Following the {{colonisation}} of Australia by the British, the 19th century saw {{the initial}} European exploration and {{settlement of the}} area and their encounters with the local indigenous peoples, beginning with the first explorations in 1820 and shortly followed by the first European settlements in 1824. At the outset the region was dominated by large properties used for sheep and cattle grazing, which had been granted to free settlers that had arrived in Australia from the United Kingdom and other European countries. These large properties were later broken up and subdivided in accordance with changes to <b>land</b> <b>tenure</b> arrangements, smaller farms and urban developments becoming more common.|$|E
5|$|From 1992 to 1999, Nauru had a local {{government}} system {{known as the}} Nauru Island Council (NIC). This nine-member council was designed to provide municipal services. The NIC was dissolved in 1999 and all assets and liabilities became vested in the national government. <b>Land</b> <b>tenure</b> on Nauru is unusual: all Nauruans have certain rights to all land on the island, {{which is owned by}} individuals and family groups. Government and corporate entities do not own any land, and they must enter into a lease arrangement with landowners to use land. Non-Nauruans cannot own land on the island.|$|E
5|$|During the High Middle Ages, Crompton was a {{collection}} of scattered woods, farmsteads, moorland, swamp and a single corn mill, occupied by a small and close community of families. The area was thinly populated and consisted of several dispersed hamlets, including Whitfield, High Crompton, Cowlishaw, Birshaw and Bovebeale (above Beal). These hamlets were situated above the water-logged valley bottoms and below the exposed high moors. Owing to complicated local arrangements of <b>land</b> <b>tenure,</b> inheritance, and absentee landlords, the local lordship was weak, and Crompton failed to emerge as a manor with its own lord and court. This slowly facilitated comparative freedoms and independence for the early people of Crompton, which encouraged the influx of families from the neighbouring parish of Rochdale, including the Buckleys, Cleggs, Greaves and Milnes.|$|E

He believed that rural land should be owned by the state and leased to people who would make whatever use of it that would benefit the largest number of people, thus breaking the often-abused power of wealthy landowners in British society.|$|E
5|$|According to Hindu mythology, {{the lands}} of Kerala were {{recovered}} from the sea by the axe-wielding warrior sage Parasurama, the sixth avatar of Vishnu (hence, Kerala is also called Parasurama Kshetram ("The Land of Parasurama")). Parasurama threw his axe across the sea, and the water receded {{as far as it}} reached. According to legend, this new area of land extended from Gokarna to Kanyakumari. The land which rose from sea was filled with salt and unsuitable for habitation; so Parasurama invoked the Snake King Vasuki, who spat holy poison and converted the soil into fertile lush green land. Out of respect, Vasuki and all snakes were appointed as protectors and guardians of the land. The legend was later expanded, and found literary expression in the 17th or 18th century with Keralolpathi, which traces the origin of aspects of early Kerala society, such as <b>land</b> <b>tenure</b> and administration, to the story of Parasurama. In medieval times Kuttuvan may have emulated the Parasurama tradition by throwing his spear into the sea to symbolise his lordship over it.|$|E
