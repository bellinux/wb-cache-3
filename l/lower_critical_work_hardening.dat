The {{thermomechanical}} {{treatment at}} 1050 °C under a stress of about 30 MPa, of milled ribbons from Fe- 25 Cr- 20 Ni (0. 060 %Ni- 0. 1 %Ti) refractory stainless steel, {{leads to a}} recrystallisation of the as-melt-spun structure which is intermediate between cellular and columnar dendritic. The mean grain size in the relatively high density zones (85 %) may be considered as low and do not exceed 10 µm. Other grains appear abnormally large and reach 30 µm.
