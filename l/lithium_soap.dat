5000|$|<b>Lithium</b> <b>soaps</b> are {{produced}} {{in a manner}} similar to saponification of triglycerides.

25|$|The type of {{alkali metal}} used determines {{the kind of}} soap product. Sodium soaps, {{prepared}} from sodium hydroxide, are firm, whereas potassium soaps, derived from potassium hydroxide, are softer or often liquid. Historically, potassium hydroxide was extracted {{from the ashes of}} bracken or other plants. <b>Lithium</b> <b>soaps</b> also tend to be hard—these are used exclusively in greases.|$|R
5000|$|Lithium 12-hydroxystearate is a {{chemical}} compound {{classified as a}} <b>lithium</b> <b>soap.</b> In chemistry, [...] "soap" [...] refers to salts of fatty acids. Lithium 12-hydroxystearate is a white solid. Lithium soaps are key component of many lubricating greases.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} {{and use of}} lithium underwent several drastic changes in history. The first major application of lithium was in high-temperature lithium greases for aircraft engines and similar applications in World War II and shortly after. This use {{was supported by the}} fact that lithium-based soaps have a higher melting point than other alkali soaps, and are less corrosive than calcium based soaps. The small demand for <b>lithium</b> <b>soaps</b> and lubricating greases was supported by several small mining operations, mostly in the US.|$|R
50|$|To produce lithium 12-hydroxystearate, lithium {{hydroxide}} and the fatty acid are combined {{in an aqueous}} medium. With vigorous stirring, dilute monohydrate {{lithium hydroxide}} is gradually added to a dispersion of the fatty acid in water heated to slightly below boiling. Since these <b>lithium</b> <b>soaps</b> are difficult to filter, they are collected by spray drying. For applications, lithium 12-hydroxystearate is usually dispersed in synthetic oils such as silicone oil and ester oil. The synthetic oils are preferred for their greater stability and ability to perform at extreme temperatures.|$|R
50|$|Soaps are salts of fatty acids. In the {{domestic}} setting, sodium-based and potassium-based soaps {{are commonly used}} as natural cleaning surfactants. The most useful of the non-detergent soaps are those based on lithium, as they are free of corrosive properties. For lubrication, and as form-release agents, <b>soaps</b> derived from <b>lithium</b> are used due to their higher melting points. The main components of <b>lithium</b> <b>soaps</b> are <b>lithium</b> stearate and lithium 12-hydroxystearate. In addition to soap, soap-based lubricating greases also contain hydrocarbon oils and other components.|$|R
5000|$|Lithium 12-hydroxystearate {{exhibits}} high {{oxidation stability}} and a dropping point up to around 200 °C. Most greases used today in motor vehicles, aircraft, and heavy machinery contain lithium stearates, mainly lithium 12-hydroxystearate. [...] Greases {{can be made}} with the addition of several different metallic soaps. Some greases are prepared from sodium, barium, lithium, and calcium soaps. <b>Lithium</b> <b>soap</b> greases are preferred for their water resistance, and their oxidative and mechanical stability. Depending on the grease, they also have good performance at high or low temperatures, but not both.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{lubricating}} greases are mixtures {{of an oil}} and a soap. The soap is dispersed into the oil to form a stable, viscous gel that is called a grease. Grease made with <b>lithium</b> <b>soap</b> ("lithium grease") adheres particularly well to metal, is non-corrosive, may be used under heavy loads, and exhibits good temperature tolerance. It has a drip temperature of [...] and resists moisture, so {{it is commonly used}} as lubricant in household products, such as electric garage doors, as well as in automotive applications, such as CV joints. Lithium-containing greases first appeared during World War II and were perhaps the first large-scale commercial application of lithium compounds.|$|E
5000|$|Tallow or lard {{was used}} as a {{lubricant}} to ease the insertion of muzzle loaded bullets. [...] Elongated rifle bullets were designed to be cast with grooves encircling the bullet to provide a reservoir for lubricant. These lubricants softened the black powder fouling for easier removal and reduced the tendency of bullets to leave deposits of lead in the barrel as they were fired. The latter advantage continued to be significant with smokeless powder. Attempts to obtain satisfactory high-velocity performance with cast bullets have included experimentation with a variety of lubricant mixtures including such things as beeswax, carnuba wax, Japan wax, bayberry wax, paraffin, petroleum jelly, sperm oil, castor oil, stearyl alcohol, lauryl alcohol, graphite, molybdenum disulphide, mica, zinc oxide, Teflon, cup grease, <b>lithium</b> <b>soap,</b> water pump grease, and a variety of more modern lubricating materials.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Basically, rolling {{bearings}} greases are {{consisting of two}} main components: a lubricating liquid, generally oil, and a thickening agent. The most used lubricants of this type in rolling contacts lubrication are mineral oil and <b>Lithium</b> <b>soaps</b> based, their properties being improved by adding the appropriate additives for specific technical applications. Here it can be highlighted their particular constitutive aspect given by the soap three-dimensional network (consisting of twisted or flatted fibres) that contains the base oil. Both fibres elementary dimensions and the soap structural uniformity are different from a manufacturer to other being influenced by the processing technology, by the raw materials provenience or by the thickener quantity or the presence of additives. Lubricating greases behaviour is dependant on their initial structure and also by their rheology under the external loads influence, all this aspects having a strong influence on greases service life. The paper presents a possible mechanism for greases lubricating film generation and failure, a hierarchy for their deterioration criteria being also proposed...|$|R
5000|$|Lithium {{derivatives}} of 12-hydroxystearate {{and several}} other carboxylic acids are important constituents of lubricating greases. In lithium-based greases, lithium carboxylates are thickeners. [...] "Complex soaps" [...] are also common, these being combinations of metallic <b>soaps,</b> such as <b>lithium</b> and calcium <b>soaps.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Lithium</b> {{stearate}} <b>soap</b> and layered MoS 2 nanoparticles encapsulated in <b>lithium</b> stearate <b>soap</b> {{are prepared}} in the laboratory, and their lubricating properties are compared {{with respect to}} the particle and particle concentration. The tribotracks after friction test was investigated with Raman Spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and 3 D optical profilometry to understand the action mechanism. The status of the soap particles on a tribotrack changes with time, contact pressure and sliding speed. At low pressure and speed, individual solid undeformed soap particle stand proud of the surface and the topography shows marginal difference with sliding time. In these conditions, no frictional difference between the performance of grease with and without the nanoparticles is observed. Increasing the contact pressure and temperature (low speed and high speed) has a dramatic effect as the soap particles melt and the liquid soap flows over the track releasing the hitherto encapsulated nanoparticles. Consequently, the soap smears the track like a liquid, and the nanoparticles now come directly into the interface and are sheared to generate a low-friction tribofilm. At high particle concentration, the sliding time required for melting of the soap and release of MoS 2 is reduced, and the tribofilm is more substantial and uniform consisting of smeared MoS 2 and carboxylate soap as observed by SEM and 3 D optical profilometry. A change in the Raman Spectra is observed with particle concentration, and this is related to morphology and microstructure of the tribofilm generated...|$|R
40|$|Commercial greases {{for space}} {{applications}} usually fulfill the requirements {{imposed by the}} severe conditions of use. The main requirement is their ability to create an EHL film, boundary film, or both under speed, load and temperature conditions that the mechanisms will operate. Three greases, all based on a multiply alkylated cyclopentane (Pennzan(R)) base oil, were studied. The thickeners were an n-octadecylterephthalamate soap, a <b>lithium</b> <b>soap,</b> and a urea derivative. A Four-Ball Tribometer and a Spiral Orbit Tribometer were employed to evaluate the greases under ultrahigh vacuum. Results indicated that all three greases yielded very low wear rates and extended lifetimes. In addition, routine physical property data is reported for each grease...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: An {{environmental}} friendly palm-grease {{has already been}} formulated from modified RBDPO (Refined Bleach Deodorized Palm Oil) as base oil and <b>lithium</b> <b>soap</b> as thickener. Such palm-grease is dedicated for general application and or equipment working in areas where biodegradability is required such as in agriculture, forestry and coastal marine, recreation areas. The grease was manufactured via 4 steps of processes: saponification in pressurized reactor, soap dilution by heating, re-crystallization by cooling and homogenization. The result of lubrication performance tests using 4 -ball wear-test showed {{that the amount of}} wear on ball specimen was smaller in test with the palm- grease than the test with mineral (HVI 160 S) grease. This ability of the palm-grease to provide better surface protection or antiwear property was considered as the existence of relatively polar groups in base oil such as ester-COOC-, hydroxides –OH and oxirane ring (epoxy) -COC-...|$|E
