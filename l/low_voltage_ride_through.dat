50|$|As a summary, a doubly-fed {{induction}} machine is a wound-rotor doubly-fed electric machine and has several advantages over a conventional {{induction machine}} in wind power applications. First, as the rotor circuit {{is controlled by}} a power electronics converter, the induction generator is able to both import and export reactive power. This has important consequences for power system stability and allows the machine to support the grid during severe voltage disturbances (<b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>ride</b> <b>through,</b> LVRT). Second, {{the control of the}} rotor voltages and currents enables the induction machine to remain synchronized with the grid while the wind turbine speed varies. A variable speed wind turbine utilizes the available wind resource more efficiently than a fixed speed wind turbine, especially during light wind conditions. Third, the cost of the converter is low when compared with other variable speed solutions because {{only a fraction of the}} mechanical power, typically 25-30%, is fed to the grid through the converter, the rest being fed to grid directly from the stator. The efficiency of the DFIG is very good for the same reason.|$|E

The results of simulation conducted on a 1. 5 MW DFIG in the PSCAD/EMTDC verified the correctness of the derivation. Through qualitative analysis of stator flux expression, different fault durations will lead to the difference of transient during fault clearing and ignoring the process of fault clearing will lead to excessive crowbar resistance. Therefore, this paper optimizes the Crowbar resistance by considering both the process of grid fault and fault clearing, and then presents a Crowbar resistance adaptive setting principle based on Crowbar structure with parallel resistor.
