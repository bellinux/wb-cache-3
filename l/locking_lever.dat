50|$|The MAG uses ignited powder gases vented {{through a}} port in the barrel to propel a gas piston rod {{connected}} to the locking assembly (it uses a long-stroke piston system). The barrel breech is locked with a vertically tilting, downward <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> mechanism that is {{connected to the}} bolt carrier through an articulated joint. The locking shoulder and camming surfaces that guide the <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> are located {{at the base of the}} receiver. The MAG uses a series of proven design concepts from other successful firearms, for example the locking mechanism is modeled on that of the Browning M1918 (BAR) automatic rifle, and the feed and trigger mechanisms are from the WWII-era MG42 universal machine gun.|$|E
5000|$|First {{manufactured}} in 1976, the Benelli B76 is a locked-breech, fixed-barrel pistol, that works {{thanks to a}} unique [...] "inertia lock" [...] system, as explained in [...] In this system, the gun has a bolt provided with ribs extending transversely to the bolt axis and adapted to engage in and disengage from corresponding mating grooves in the receiver, and a <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> that links the bolt with the slide which acts as a bolt carrier. Upon firing, while the pistol recoils in {{the hand of the}} shooter, the inertia of the slide makes it maintain its position relative to the receiver, constraining the bolt ribs' motion in the corresponding grooves via the <b>locking</b> <b>lever,</b> and so keeping the breech positively locked. As soon as the recoil movement of the pistol in the hand of the shooter slows down, the slide tends to continue its rearward movement, so retreating relative to the receiver. At that point, the <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> does not force the bolt into its locking recesses any more and the bolt is free to recoil as well, pushed by the residual pressure of the gasses in the barrel with enough force to complete the shooting cycle.|$|E
50|$|The LPS {{telescopic}} sight propriety mount is adjustable for {{tension on the}} LPS rifle's side rail. This side rail is a Warsaw Pact rail similar in design to the mounting used for Russian SVD rifles and PSO-1 optical sights and positions the {{telescopic sight}} axis {{to the left side}} in relation to the receiver and bore center axis.The Warsaw Pact mount has a castle nut that screws {{into the bottom of the}} <b>locking</b> <b>lever.</b> The spring-loaded portion of the clamp has to be pressed down to tighten or loosen the castle nut as needed.The scope can be easily removed from the receiver of the rifle by swinging the <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> open, then sliding the scope mount to the rear. This allows easy access to the receiver cover which needs to be removed for cleaning.Due to the offset to the left and the relative height of the mounting, the PSL iron sights can be used with a LPS scope mounted, though the positioning of the scope’s optical center axis may not be comfortable to all shooters.|$|E

50|$|These little pistols were {{intended}} to be a parlor pistol and not a defensive weapon. They are designed for use with a percussion cap and lead shot, without gunpowder. There are two types of breech-pieces, about equal in frequency in existing production guns; all known prototypes have the one-piece design, which provides no cover to enclose the cap, and its <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> is quite short. The two-piece design has a cone to hold the cap, a cover providing protection from the exploding cap, and a longer lever.|$|E
50|$|The MAG's {{receiver}} {{is constructed}} from sheet metal stampings reinforced by steel plates and rivets. The front is reinforced {{to accept the}} barrel nut and gas cylinder which are permanently mounted. Guide rails that support the bolt assembly and piston extension during their reciprocating movement are riveted to the side plates. The bolt's guide rails are shaped downward to drive the <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> into engagement with the locking shoulder, which is also riveted to the side plates. The rear of the receiver has been reinforced and slotted to accept the butt-stock.|$|E
50|$|The {{telescopic}} sight propriety mount is adjustable for {{tension on the}} SVD rifle's side rail. This side rail is a Warsaw Pact rail (a type of dovetail rail).

50|$|In 2010, Chiappa began {{marketing}} {{a version}} of the Aircrew Survival Weapon called the Chiappa X-Caliber. It is an evolution of the M6 Scout, which had the major failing of disassembling by removing a pin to take the gun down into two easy to stow parts. If the pin was lost, the gun could not be reassembled. The Chiappa X-Caliber is designed to fold in half by pushing one <b>locking</b> <b>lever.</b> In addition, it comes with adapters that allow up to a dozen different calibers of cartridges and shotshells to be used, one at a time in each barrel.|$|E
5000|$|The Prescott and Cedar Mill Pentium 4 cores, {{as well as}} the Smithfield and Presler Pentium D cores, {{used the}} LGA 775 socket. In July 2006, Intel {{released}} the desktop processor Core 2 Duo (codenamed Conroe), which also uses this socket, as does the subsequent Core 2 Quad. Intel changed from Socket 478 to LGA 775 because the new pin type offers better power distribution to the processor, allowing the front-side bus to be raised to 1600 MT/s. The 'T' in Socket T was derived from the now cancelled Tejas core, which was to replace the Prescott core. Another advantage for Intel with this newer architecture is that it is now the motherboard which has the pins, rather than the CPU, transferring the risk of pins being bent from the CPU to the motherboard.The CPU is pressed into place by a [...] "load plate", rather than human fingers directly. The installer lifts the hinged [...] "load plate", inserts the processor, closes the load plate {{over the top of the}} processor, and pushes down a <b>locking</b> <b>lever.</b> The pressure of the <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> on the load plate clamps the processor's 775 copper contact points firmly down onto the socket's 775 pins, ensuring a good connection. The load plate only covers the edges of the top surface of the CPU (integrated heat spreader). The center is free to make contact with the cooling device placed on top of the CPU. The spacing for the CPU cooler mounting holes is 72mm x 72mm.|$|E
50|$|To {{mount the}} optics, a side-rail is {{permanently}} {{attached to the}} left wall of the receiver which accepts an alloy sliding dovetail rail mount with a clamping lever to which can be attached various telescopic sights and night optics. The mount is detachable from the receiver rail in seconds by swinging the <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> open and sliding the scope and mount off the rail to the rear. It can be removed and reattached without loss of zero. The optic sight is normally removed during field stripping to give {{easy access to the}} receiver cover and bolt carrier. The rifle features mechanically adjustable backup AKM-type iron sights with a sliding tangent rear sight which can be adjusted from 100 m to 1,000 m. These sights can be used with or without the optic sight in place.|$|E
50|$|Railway {{interlocking}} is of British origin, where numerous patents were granted. In June 1856, John Saxby {{received the}} first patent for interlocking switches and signals. In 1868, Saxby (of Saxby & Farmer) {{was awarded a}} patent for what is known today in North America as “preliminary latch locking”. Preliminary latch locking became so successful that by 1873, 13,000 mechanical <b>locking</b> <b>levers</b> were employed on the London and North Western Railway alone.|$|R

50|$|The Airphibian {{took the}} {{approach}} of converting from an aircraft to a roadable vehicle by a conversion process that left aircraft sections behind during road use. The process consisted of removing a three-bladed propeller and placing it on a hook {{on the side of}} the fuselage, cranking down support casters, and disengaging <b>lock</b> <b>levers</b> connecting the flight unit to the road unit. The wing and aft fuselage are detached for road use.|$|R
50|$|The {{program was}} encoded on a punched card {{and could be}} {{prepared}} on any keypunch (a keypunch would operate even if no program card was in place). The program card was wrapped around the program drum, and clamped in place. The drum rotated as the card being punched moved through the punching mechanism. The holes in the program card were sensed by an array of starwheels that would cause levers to rise and fall as {{the holes in the}} program card passed beneath the starwheels, activating electrical contacts. The program was encoded in the top six rows 12,11,0,1,2,3. If the optional Second Program feature was installed, another program could be encoded in the bottom six rows 4,5,6,7,8,9. A switch let the operator select which program to use. The central cover on the keypunch could be tilted open toward the operator and a <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> released, allowing the program drum to be removed and replaced.|$|E
50|$|Stoddard-Dayton {{was slow}} {{to react to the}} {{emergence}} of a mass market and maintained a high-quality strategy after automobiles ceased to be exclusively rich men's status symbols. They were building cars as good as possible while Ford and General Motors were building as cheap as possible. Stoddard-Dayton continued to expand model offerings at all price points, but never changed fundamental manufacturing methods. The classic example of this was the 11-part radiator cap on the limousine - body, two pins, gasket, gasket retainer, screws, and latch. It was permanently attached to the radiator so that it could not be lost or stolen and could be opened with a flip of the <b>locking</b> <b>lever,</b> even when the engine was hot. Meanwhile, in Detroit, a Ford punch press was punching out caps and then an operation applied threads. True, the threads sometimes stuck and it could not be removed when the radiator was hot - but the Model T was selling for $399.|$|E
50|$|As {{standard}} the Mauser M 98 rifle {{features the}} traditional Mauser 98 three-position safety attached {{at the rear}} of the bolt which operating lever can be flicked from right (safety on, bolt locked) to middle (safety on, bolt can be opened for reloading), to left (ready to fire) but only when the rifle is cocked, otherwise the safety will not move. The safety secures the firing pin. The safety can only be released by firing the rifle with the safety set in the ready to fire position or by closing the cocked bolt with a previously pulled trigger that must be kept pulled back during the closing operation. Disengaging the safety by closing the bolt is only possible with the safety set in the ready to fire position. The safety catch lever is quite large, making it easy to operate but posing a problem for mounting telescopic sights very low above the receiver whilst retaining good operability of the safety catch leaver.The Mauser M 98 rifle series can also be ordered with an optional Mauser horizontal 3-position safety with <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> to ensure good operability of the safety catch leaver with low mounted aiming optics.|$|E

25|$|The AAIB {{investigation}} {{concluded that}} the accident {{was caused by the}} locked condition of the aircraft's elevators which prevented the aircraft rotating into a flying attitude. It was thought likely that the elevator gust lock became re-engaged during the pilots' pre-takeoff checks, and that it was not noticed until the takeoff was so far advanced that a successful abandonment within the overrun area could not be made. The re-engagement of the gust lock was made possible by the condition of the gust <b>lock</b> <b>lever</b> gate plate and gate-stop strip, to which non-standard repairs had been made.|$|R
50|$|In this {{mechanism}} the reversing rod {{is controlled by}} a screw and nut, worked by a wheel in the cab. The nut either operates on the reversing rod directly or through a lever, as above. The screw and nut may be cut with a double thread and a coarse pitch to move the mechanism as quickly as possible. The wheel is fitted with a <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> to prevent creep {{and there is an}} indicator to show the percentage of cutoff in use. This method of altering the cutoff offers finer control than the sector lever, but it has the disadvantage of slow operation. It is most suitable for long-distance passenger engines where frequent changes of cutoff are not required and where fine adjustments offer the most benefit. On locomotives fitted with Westinghouse air brake equipment and Stephenson valve gear, it was common to use the screw housing as an air cylinder, with the nut extended to form a piston. Compressed air from the brake reservoirs was applied {{to one side of the}} piston to reduce the effort required to lift the heavy expansion link, with gravity assisting in the opposite direction.|$|E
5000|$|In theory, {{the motor}} failure {{on the plane}} could not present a problem because the <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> {{would not be able}} to close. However, during the {{investigation}} a McDonnell Douglas test rig demonstrated that the entire locking pin operating system was too weak, allowing the handle to be forced closed even with the pins out of the locking holes. This occurred on Flight 96, when the handler forced the handle closed with his knee. In spite of the vent not closing completely, neither the handler nor the engineer considered this to be serious. Although the vent door remained partially open, it closed enough to cause it to [...] "blow shut", and thereby allow pressurization of the cargo hold. Although the handle did not seat the pins entirely, the small amount of motion it managed to cause was enough to press on the warning indicator switch, deactivating the cockpit warning light. It was only the combination of all of these failures that allowed the accident to happen. Yet all of these indicators had a single common point of failure: the mechanical weakness of the locking system that allowed the handle to be moved.|$|E
5000|$|In 1920, the Belgian arms {{manufacturer}} Fabrique Nationale (FN) acquired {{sales and}} production {{rights to the}} BAR series of firearms in Europe from Colt. The first BAR model sold by FN was the Kg m/21 (Kg—Kulsprutegevär or [...] "machine rifle") chambered for the 6.5×55mm m/94 cartridge. The m/21 is {{a variant of the}} Model 1919 designed to Swedish specifications and manufactured initially by Colt's and later under license at the Carl Gustafs Stads Gevärsfaktori in Eskilstuna. Compared to the Model 1919, the Swedish weapon has—apart from the different caliber—a spiked bipod and pistol grip. The m/21 would become one of Sweden's main support weapons in the interwar years together with the water-cooled belt-fed Ksp m/1914 medium machine gun (Swedish adaptation of the Austrian M07/12). Dissatisfied with the rapidly overheating fixed barrel of the m/21, Carl Gustaf began to design a new quick-detach mechanism for the barrel which mates the externally grooved chamber to a series of rotating flanges in the receiver operated by a <b>locking</b> <b>lever.</b> The barrel also received cooling fins along its entire length. These enhancements were incorporated into the fm/1935 prototype which was favorably evaluated during trials in 1935. The final version was the Kg m/37, adopted for service in 1937, which uses a smooth contour, unfinned barrel. Numerous m/21 guns were retrofitted with the screw-on receiver extension and quick-change barrel, and renamed the Kg m/21-37. The m/37 remained in service until being replaced by the FN MAG, but was still in second-line use until 1980. Carl Gustaf also developed a belt-fed prototype; however, it was never adopted.|$|E

50|$|Verwood {{station was}} 14 miles and 38 chains from Alderbury Junction, {{some way to}} the west of the village on the B3081. This crossed the line on an over-bridge just to the north of the station. The station {{consisted}} of a passing loop with two platforms plus goods facilities. The up platform was used in both directions when ths signalbox was closed. When the signalbox was open there were two single line sections West Moors to Verwood and Verwood to Fordingbridge, operated by Tylers No 6 tablets, when shut the two token were locked away behind the lever frame (lever 11 was the section <b>locking</b> <b>lever)</b> and a long section staff was withdrawn for a section from West Moors to Fordingbridge. The main station building was a single-storey, double gabled brick building, with platform canopy, on the up platform. Next to it was the LSWR Type 1 signal box and beyond that a parcels store. On the down platform was a timber shelter. At the southern end of the down platform a ground frame was located, this had to be operated for the passage of all down trains when the signalbox was open, it also was required for access to the sidings. In the station yard was the Albion Hotel. The goods yard was at the southern end of the up platform and consisted of a number of sidings, some serving the nearby brick works. A single siding ran between a cattle loading dock and the up platform. Verwood was the only station, other than Fordingbridge, to be equipped with a loading crane. In the later years that the station was open timber for various railway works was forward to the works after being loaded by the hand crane. The Albion Hotel (now the Albion Inn) and the road bridge are the only remaining structures with the road being rerouted across the station site.|$|E

40|$|A Seat Track Attach Mechanism (SAM) is a multiple-use {{clamping}} device {{intended for use}} in mounting various objects on the standard seat tracks used on the International Space Station (ISS). The basic SAM design could also be adapted to other settings in which seat tracks are available: for example, SAM-like devices {{could be used as}} universal aircraft-seat-track mounting clamps. A SAM (see figure) is easily installed by inserting it in a seat track, then actuating a <b>locking</b> <b>lever</b> to clamp the SAM to the track. The SAM includes an over-center locking feature that prevents premature disengagement that could be caused by some inadvertent movements of persons or objects in the vicinity. A SAM can be installed in, or removed from, any position along a seat track, without regard for the locations of the circular access holes. Hence, one or more SAM(s) can be used to mount an object or objects on a track or a pair of tracks in an infinite number of preferred configurations. A SAM can be incorporated into a dual swivel device, so that two of the SAMs can be made to lock onto two side-by-side seat tracks simultaneously, as would be the case in a standard ISS rack bay where two side-by-side racks reside. The main benefit to using two SAMs in a side-by-side arrangement is to provide a coupled load. By picking up load points on two seat tracks, a coupled loading is created, improving the stability and strength since the load is spread to two seat tracks at a short distance...|$|E
