50|$|Home Demonstration Garden: Since {{its opening}} in 2003 this 3 acre space {{has been devoted}} to {{educational}} displays including noteworthy plants and architectural techniques and materials suitable for Central Florida gardeners. It is divided into 10 residentially scaled “idea gardens” showcasing different plant groups that include the following gardens: Bird, Bog, Enabling, Evening, Fragrance, Ornamental Grass, Shade, Subtropical Fruit, Urban Patio and Wildflower. • The Bird Garden displays plants that attract and sustain birds in Central Florida. Some of the plants produce fruit and berries for birds to eat while other plants have dense growth habits that allow birds cover or nesting sites. There are also flowering plants that hummingbirds feed from and find attractive. • The Bog Garden demonstrates plants that can tolerate growing in a wet location in the landscape. This is an area in which water can stand for several hours to a couple of days at a time following a heavy rainfall but is not permanent. The soil is very heavy and poorly drained. A “dry” streambed runs {{through the center of the}} Bog Garden but does not have a permanent flow of water.• The Enabling Garden was specifically designed to support Leu Garden’s extensive horticultural therapy program. The beds are raised for gardening for several purposes; to provide accessibility for someone in a wheelchair, for someone who needs to remain seated most of the time or for people with visual impairments, because the plants are in closer range than on the ground. The plantings in these beds may change throughout the year. In addition there is a small Texture Garden that contains plants with unusual textures to the touch or brightly colored foliage and flowers and a small Scented Garden with plants that have fragrant flowers or leaves or flowers. • The Evening Garden displays a wide variety of plants that have foliage or flowers that are easily seen in the evening or bear flowers that are fragrant at night. Many of these plants have white flowers or variegated foliage• The Fragrance Garden contains plants that bear fragrant flowers or have leaves or even fruit that is fragrant. • The Ornamental Grass Garden contains grasses or grass-like plants in a variety of heights short and tall. Most are grown for the ornamental foliage while others bear striking inflorescences.• The Shade Garden demonstrates different plant specimens that can grow in shady and low <b>light</b> <b>locations</b> of a landscape.• The Subtropical Fruit Garden contains different subtropical and tropical fruit trees and plants that can be grown in Central Florida• The Urban Patio Garden is ideally suited to smaller urban spaces. It can help gardeners learn how to bring shape, form and color to a small area. • The Wildflower Garden demonstrates wildflower specimens that are excellent choices for the low maintenance home landscape. Many are drought tolerant and pest resistant. They offer color almost year round and are good for attracting butterflies, beneficial insects like bees, and sometimes hummingbirds. Most of the wildflowers displayed here are native to Central Florida, with some being annuals and some perennials. There are also native grasses, shrubs, and trees planted in this area.|$|E

40|$|NFPA 101, section 5 - 9 {{mandates}} that, where {{required by}} building classification, all designated emergency egress routes {{be provided with}} adequate emergency lighting {{in the event of}} a normal lighting outage. Emergency lighting is to be arranged so that egress routes are illuminated to an average of 1. 0 footcandle with a minimum at any point of 0. 1 footcandle, as measured at floor level. These levels are permitted to drop to 60 % of their original value over the required 90 minute emergency lighting duration after a power outage. The Plutonium Finishing Plant (PFP) has two designations for battery powered egress lights ''Emergency Lights'' are those battery powered lights required by NFPA 101 to provide lighting along officially designated egress routes in those buildings meeting the correct occupancy requirements. Emergency Lights are maintained on a monthly basis by procedure ZSR- 12 N- 001. ''Backup Lights'' are battery powered lights not required by NFPA, but installed in areas where additional light may be needed. The Backup <b>Light</b> <b>locations</b> were identified by PFP Safety and Engineering based on several factors. (1) General occupancy and type of work in the area. Areas occupied briefly during a shiftly surveillance do not require backup lighting while a room occupied fairly frequently or for significant lengths of time will need one or two Backup lights to provide general illumination of the egress points. (2) Complexity of the egress routes. Office spaces with a standard hallway/room configuration will not require Backup Lights while a large room with several subdivisions or irregularly placed rooms, doors, and equipment will require Backup Lights to make egress safer. (3) Reasonable balance between the safety benefits of additional lighting and the man-hours/exposure required for periodic light maintenance. In some plant areas such as building 236 -Z, the additional maintenance time and risk of contamination do not warrant having Backup Lights installed in all rooms. Sufficient light for egress is provided by existing lights located in the hallways...|$|E

40|$|The City of Mattawa is a {{fast growing}} city along the Columbia River. Government Road {{is the main}} road and a major highway that runs east-west {{connecting}} most of the residential streets to the agricultural land. Currently, the road is 100 foot wide with mismatched sidewalks, gravel parking, and unclear lane divisions. There is considerable traffic congestion and pedestrian traffic with limited safe crossing areas. The town is working to improve the condition along the road such as creating a safe path for children walking to school, sidewalks, crosswalks, speed and traffic control. To study and develop an improved street plan, the city worked with the Rural Communities Design Initiative (RCDI) at Washington State University, Gray and Osborne, Inc., consulting engineers, and Berger Partnership, a landscape architecture firm. The RCDI team of faculty and students in Landscape Architecture, Interior Design, and Architecture worked in a co-design process by facilitating community workshops. RCDI worked with community members to collect data and identify problems concerning traffic in the community. Community members shared their ideas and interests in developing their community as safe and welcoming. After collecting information and perspective during the participatory community workshops, the RCDI team researched and designed a concept proposal and presented it to the community through a second workshop. After community feedback the proposal was revised, then presented to the City of Mattawa. The RCDI student team created a document which included the proposed design plan along Government Road and and planning for future growth. The plan included road sections, street <b>light</b> <b>locations,</b> pedestrian safety, traffic calming and lane divisions, parking options, streetscape and storefront character, community arts, and gathering spaces. Locations were proposed for a community center, city hall, and fire station. The RCDI conceptual planning document {{has been used by}} the City of Mattawa, Gray & Osborne Inc. and Berger Partnership for the refinement of the streetscape character and to prepare a feasibility study. The City of Mattawa {{is currently working on a}} community hall design based on interest expressed at the workshops...|$|E

50|$|Film noir, {{which was}} given its name by Nino Frank, {{is marked by}} lower {{production}} values, darker images, under <b>lighting,</b> <b>location</b> shooting, and general nihilism: this is because, we are told, {{during the war and}} post-war years filmmakers (as well as filmgoers) were generally more pessimistic. Also, the German Expressionists (including Fritz Lang, who was not technically an expressionist as popularly believed) emigrated to America and brought their stylized lighting effects (and disillusionment due to the war) to American soil.|$|R

25|$|As well as {{the obvious}} ability to move these mobile lights to {{temporary}} airfields they were also used to camouflage the airfield location from the enemy. The normal peacetime beacon <b>location</b> or <b>light</b> code was no longer used. Instead a mobile light was placed at one of three positions {{some distance from the}} airfield and a different wartime code was used: Elmdon (EK) used JD / KJ / UT in war, Ringway (EZ) used CL / HV / JL. The codes and their offset to the airfield location were distributed to flight crews and would change periodically. If an air raid was in progress at the airfield and so returning aircraft should divert elsewhere, its <b>light</b> <b>location</b> would also indicate this by also displaying a triangle of red lights surrounding it.|$|R
