40|$|In {{this paper}} we address the {{issues related to the}} {{delivery}} of multimedia streams on <b>local</b> <b>area</b> <b>networks.</b> Multimedia integrates voice and video along with text and images into existing systems. <b>Local</b> <b>area</b> <b>networks</b> were designed to handle regular data traffic which are bursty in nature and for which variable delay is acceptable. Multimedia traffic, on the other hand, requires constant delay in addition to fast (or real time) delivery. Multimedia traffic also requires large amount of bandwidth compared to regular traffic. Since <b>local</b> <b>area</b> <b>networks</b> are widely in use, their modification to integrate multimedia streams is very important. In our work we consider some possible solutions to the problems associated with multimedia on <b>local</b> <b>area</b> <b>networks</b> as well as studying the performance aspects of these solutions. Key words: Multimedia, <b>local</b> <b>area</b> <b>networks,</b> synchronization, priority, switching hubs. 1 Introduction Multimedia is a media that integrates the transmission of voice and video alo [...] ...|$|R

5|$|In March 1999, {{one month}} after the game's release, Final Fantasy VIII Ultimania was published, a book that {{features}} an in-depth guide to Final Fantasy VIII and interviews with the developers. An origami book was released in November 1999. On September 22, 1999, a CD-ROM titled Final Fantasy VIII Desktop Accessories was released. It contains desktop icons, computer wallpapers, screensavers, and an e-mail application. It additionally features a stand-alone edition of the Triple Triad minigame, which allowed players to compete against one another via a <b>local</b> <b>area</b> <b>network.</b>|$|E

It is now supported by similar {{services such as}} GameSpy Arcade and XFire, via DirectPlay.

Players compete {{in a series of}} matches of various types, with the general aim of out-killing opponents. The PC version supports multiplayer online or over a <b>local</b> <b>area</b> <b>network.</b> Free expansion packs were released, some of which were bundled with a 2000 re-release: Unreal Tournament: Game of the Year Edition.|$|E
5|$|A {{cluster is}} a group of loosely coupled {{computers}} that work together closely, so that in some respects they can be regarded as a single computer. Clusters are composed of multiple standalone machines connected by a network. While machines in a cluster {{do not have to be}} symmetric, load balancing is more difficult if they are not. The most common type of cluster is the Beowulf cluster, which is a cluster implemented on multiple identical commercial off-the-shelf computers connected with a TCP/IP Ethernet <b>local</b> <b>area</b> <b>network.</b> Beowulf technology was originally developed by Thomas Sterling and Donald Becker.

5|$|By early April 1999, TouchWave had {{upgraded}} their WebSwitch 1608 <b>local</b> <b>area</b> <b>network</b> distributed {{phone system}} to a product called WebSwitch 2000. On April 13, 1999, Swedish telecommunication company Ericsson announced that it had purchased TouchWave for $46 million. In exchange for the $46M, TouchWave provided Ericsson with Internet Protocol centric network products such as business phone and private business exchanges. The acquisition of TouchWave {{came at a time}} when multibillion-dollar companies were acquiring other relatively small Internet-connected companies, such as WebLine, Selsius, GeoTel, NBX, Dialogic, and Summa Four. Some employees from TouchWave eventually followed serial entrepreneur and former TouchWave president and CEO Samir Lehaff to Adomo, Inc., a provider of voicemail majordomo services. TouchWave co-founder Jeff Snider would go on to be vice president of enterprise sales at Ericsson and then a CEO co-founder of Adomo in 1999.|$|E
5|$|StarCraft II {{does not}} offer the ability to play {{directly}} over a <b>local</b> <b>area</b> <b>network</b> (LAN), as is possible with StarCraft; all network games are routed through the Internet via Blizzard's gaming servers. The latency delay between commands issued and game response when played online is greatly reduced when playing over a LAN and this allows for much finer control over in-game units; there were concerns that a professional scene would not develop as a result. Over 250,000 fans signed a petition asking Blizzard to add LAN play to StarCraft II, before the game's release. Currently, Blizzard {{has no plans to}} support LAN play. Although it does not change the routing of the game through Blizzard's servers, a Players Near You feature was added in StarCraft II patch 2.0.4, to help with organizing games with other players on the same local network.|$|E
5|$|On 11 September 1940, George Stibitz {{transmitted}} {{problems for}} his Complex Number Calculator in New York using a teletype, {{and received the}} computed results back at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. This configuration of a centralized computer (mainframe) with remote dumb terminals remained popular well into the 1970s. However, already in the 1960s, researchers started to investigate packet switching, a technology that sends a message in portions to its destination asynchronously without passing it through a centralized mainframe. A four-node network emerged on 5 December 1969, constituting {{the beginnings of the}} ARPANET, which by 1981 had grown to 213 nodes. ARPANET eventually merged with other networks to form the Internet. While Internet development was a focus of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) who published a series of Request for Comment documents, other networking advancement occurred in industrial laboratories, such as the <b>local</b> <b>area</b> <b>network</b> (LAN) developments of Ethernet (1983) and the token ring protocol (1984).|$|E
