40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the patterns of}} durational adjustment of bi-syllabic words in Standard Chinese when different constituents of the word are focused for correction. Results show that both focus-induced <b>lengthening</b> and utterance final <b>lengthening</b> exists in Chinese bi-syllabic words. The distribution of final <b>lengthening</b> is non-uniform. The final-lengthening pattern of target words is progressive, while the focus <b>lengthening</b> doesn’t have a certain pattern in <b>lengthening,</b> no progressive <b>lengthening</b> or any “edge effect’ appears {{in the distribution of}} <b>lengthening</b> pattern. However both final <b>lengthening</b> and focus <b>lengthening</b> are consistent with the content based view and the structural based view. In that, <b>lengthening</b> appears in all syllables if it is expandable regardless of the where the <b>lengthening</b> starts. And short syllable <b>lengthened</b> less than full syllables. The lack of final <b>lengthening</b> in words with second syllable being stressed and a full first syllable agrees with the structure based view that <b>lengthening</b> starts from the stressed syllable. In the focus-induced <b>lengthening,</b> the target words position has a obvious impact on the <b>lengthening</b> effect.

30|$|Femoral <b>lengthening</b> can be {{combined}} with the tibial <b>lengthening</b> {{at the same time}} or at a separate time to treat concomitant shortening of the femur. Simultaneous femur and tibia <b>lengthening</b> with external fixation is used when the femur and tibia shortening is of significant magnitude. In such cases, it is not unusual to perform the SUPERankle procedure with application of the external fixator for <b>lengthening</b> tibia and femur. A discussion of femoral <b>lengthening</b> {{is beyond the scope of}} this article, but for further information the reader is referred to published studies [32, 33, 34]. If femoral <b>lengthening</b> is considered, it is factored into the surgical life plan discussed previously. Obviously, simultaneous femoral and tibial <b>lengthening</b> can yield much larger amounts of <b>lengthening</b> in one treatment than tibia <b>lengthening</b> alone. For example, simultaneous 5.0 -cm femoral and 5.0 -cm tibia <b>lengthening</b> together take a total of 5  months of external fixation, and isolated tibia <b>lengthening</b> of 5.0  cm also takes a total of 5  months of external fixation. Therefore, in the first example combined femoral and tibia <b>lengthening</b> achieve 10.0  cm (4 in.) of leg length equalization compared to only 5.0  cm (2 in.) when only the tibia is <b>lengthened.</b> While tibial <b>lengthening</b> alone requires daily physical therapy, combined femur and tibial <b>lengthening</b> mandates strict lengthening-specific physical therapy [33]. There is no indication to do femoral <b>lengthening</b> in the absence of femoral discrepancy. The advent of internal <b>lengthening</b> methods makes femoral <b>lengthening</b> as a separate procedure much easier.|$|R
40|$|Limb-lengthening {{procedures}} {{include a}} series of radiographic examinations to follow the <b>lengthening</b> process and callus formation. We quantified ionizing radiation exposure during <b>lengthening</b> treatment and estimated {{the risks associated with}} this exposure in 53 patients undergoing <b>lengthening</b> procedures. Field size and tube voltage of all radiographs and fluoroscopy time during surgery were recorded. According to conversion factor tables of organ doses, the cumulative organ dose was estimated. Location of <b>lengthening,</b> age, complications during <b>lengthening</b> procedure, range of <b>lengthening,</b> healing index, and other factors affecting the duration of the <b>lengthening</b> procedures were analyzed. Average <b>lengthening</b> was 4. 8  cm (range, 3. 0 – 12. 5  cm). The average cumulative organ dose for a straight <b>lengthening</b> procedure was 3. 1  mSv (range, 0. 2 – 12. 5  mSv). The average organ dose per centimeter of <b>lengthening</b> was 0. 7  mSv/cm (range, 0. 03 – 5. 9  mSv/cm). Doses for patients with tibial <b>lengthening</b> (0. 3  mSv/cm) were less than doses for patients with femoral <b>lengthening</b> (1. 1  mSv/cm). Age, complications, range of <b>lengthening,</b> and healing index did not influence the dosage of radiation per centimeter <b>lengthening.</b> We judge the average patient’s exposure during a limb-lengthening procedure as tolerable, but femur <b>lengthening</b> results in a higher cumulative organ dose...|$|R
5|$|Among the Eolambia {{specimens}} {{found to}} date, the best-preserved sacrum includes seven vertebrae.

The prezygapophyses <b>lengthen</b> to become stalks and the postzygapophyses shrink in the middle and rear caudals. Furthermore, the neural spines transition from rectangular to strongly curved (concave in front and convex behind), the centra become more elongated, and the transverse processes disappear as well.|$|E

The California Highway Commission endorsed the routing for SR75 in 1965 along Otay Mesa Road, away from future residential developments. There were plans as early as 1970 to have a highway heading southwest to a new border crossing that would bypass the Tijuana area. The next year, James Moe, the state public works director, subsequently asked the California State Legislature to <b>lengthen</b> SR75 to connect to this new crossing, rather than using I-5 to make the connection.|$|E

Using a large cohort of 150 children who had undergone bone <b>lengthening</b> procedures, we describe five patterns of post-intervention growth and identify factors that are favourable for normal residual growth. The criteria for bone <b>lengthening</b> which should maintain good residual growth are—bone age at <b>lengthening</b> should be before the pubertal growth spurt; the interval between two <b>lengthening</b> procedures should be over three years; the percentage of <b>lengthening</b> should be < 30 % of the initial segment; {{and no more than}} two <b>lengthening</b> procedures should be carried out during infancy.|$|R
5|$|Homing transponders {{are similar}} to IFF systems in general terms, but used shorter pulses.

The pulse was sent to the Mk. IV's display and appeared as a sharp blip. Depending on the location of the transponder relative to the aircraft, the blip would be longer on the left or right of the azimuth display, allowing the operator to guide the aircraft to the transponder using exactly the same methods as a conventional aircraft intercept.|$|E
5|$|Since so {{many new}} sets had to be created, the {{production}} commenced filming with location photography. Four days were spent in the Titan Missile Museum, south of Tucson, Arizona—the disarmed nuclear missile was fitted with a fiberglass capsule shell to stand in for the Phoenixs booster and command module. The old missile silo provided a large set that the budget would have prohibited building from scratch, but the small size created difficulties. Each camera move was planned in advance to work around areas where the lighting would be added, and electricians and grips donned rock-climbing harnesses to move down the shaft and attach the lights. To give greater dimension to the rocket and lend the missile a futuristic appearance, Leonetti chose to offset the missile's metallic surface with complementary colors. Using different-colored gels made the rocket appear longer than it actually was; to complete the effect, shots from the Phoenixs nose downwards and from the engines up were filmed with a 30mm lens to <b>lengthen</b> the missile.|$|E
5|$|The northernmost {{coastal area}} {{is one of}} California's most seismically active regions and, in a 50-year period, the area {{including}} the Mendocino Fracture Zone at the southern flank of the Gorda Plate generated about 25 percent of all seismic energy unleashed in the state. The Mendocino Triple Junction (strike-slip/strike-slip/trench) formed 29–30 mya at 31° N (west of present-day Baja California) when the Pacific-Farallon spreading center initially approached the subduction zone {{off the coast of}} western North America. Simultaneously, the Rivera Triple Junction shifted to the southeast to its current position at 23° N. Once the Pacific Plate and North American Plate connected the boundary became that of a transform fault (San Andreas) due to the northwestward motion of the Pacific Plate relative to the North American Plate.

Recordings of those live shows were issued in 2002 as Inglewood – Live in California. The next gig at San Diego was the last one supporting Cream, whose management apparently did not appreciate the cheerful reaction of the audience to Deep Purple and dropped them. After a week of forced stop, their American manager succeeded in setting up a tour which included the San Francisco International Pop Festival and venues on the West Coast.

5|$|Fontana, who had {{previously}} worked {{on a number of}} episodes of the original series, was tasked with writing the script for the pilot. The production team met in full {{for the first time on}} February 18, 1987, having received the first draft of Fontana's script a few days earlier. The original premise involved the Enterprise and the USS Starseeker approaching an alien lifeform captured by a race called the Annoi and turned into a weapon. After the Annoi told the Starfleet ships to surrender, the Starseeker opened fire and was destroyed, while Troi contacted the alien and convinced it to crash on a nearby planet so that the Enterprise can help it to free itself along with rescuing other prisoners the Annoi were using as slaves on the surface. Despite numerous changes taking place to the plot before the final version, some of the introductions for various characters made it through to the final version. The plot involving Q was added subsequently to the episode in order to make it longer. Roddenberry was aiming for an hour-long pilot, but Paramount wanted a two-hour show and eventually won out. Other items were also added in order to <b>lengthen</b> the episode, including the saucer separation sequence and the appearance of Admiral Leonard McCoy.|$|E
5|$|Spiny {{scallops}} are dioecious, individuals being either male or female. They become mature {{at about}} 2 {{years old and}} usually live for about 4 years. Breeding {{takes place in the}} summer. Gametes are released into the water column and fertilisation is external. Veliger larvae begin to develop from the eggs in about 2 days and drift with the plankton for 40 days, growing to a maximum valve length of 240μ (0.01 inch). The larvae have a tuft of broad, compound cilia near the mouth. The velum, the locomotory and feeding organ, has bands of cilia running down it. The simple eyes and rudimentary gills start developing on about the 25th day. The foot becomes visible on the 15th day and the propodium (the projecting front end of the foot) develops on about the 28th. By the 34rd day, the larva is crawling about using its foot and its cilia. Metamorphosis takes place on about the 40th day. Over the course of 48 hours, the internal organs undergo a 90° rotation, the valves, hinge and ligament appear and the gills <b>lengthen.</b> A swimming veliger larva has become a benthic juvenile scallop.|$|E

Two dorsal vertebrae were preserved with a complete, but very crushed neural arch, a neural spine with a characteristic shape: it is very widened distally and narrows downwards. The vertebrae also have an internal structure that is spongy, with very large cells. The caudal vertebrae are all strongly procoelous and are compressed on the sides. The neural spines of the caudal vertebrae are very narrow and very tall and point toward the rear. The middle caudal vertebrae are more compressed on the sides that the others.

30|$|Gradual {{development}} of varus and procurvatum occurs with proximal femoral <b>lengthening,</b> {{irrespective of the}} type of external fixator device used. With circular systems, the possibility of correction of the deformity after <b>lengthening</b> is useful. Some monolateral rail systems also posses adjustable clamps (e.g. the micrometric swivel clamp of the Orthofix LRS) that allow the correction of the varus component to be reduced but, being a device applied in the coronal plane, correction of procurvatum is more difficult. In general, this deformity is not a clinically significant issue in subtrochanteric <b>lengthening</b> if the target <b>lengthening</b> is kept 5 – 6  cm. Should the surgeon wish to achieve a greater length using a monolateral device, consideration should then be given for bifocal femoral <b>lengthening</b> where it is possible to achieve 5  cm of <b>lengthening</b> at each osteotomy site. Bifocal femoral <b>lengthening</b> should not be used for <b>lengthening</b> for congenital pathologies (especially longitudinal deficiency of the femur) as the tension created in the soft tissues will become excessive.|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} studies {{over the last few}} decades have {{established}} that the control strategy employed by the nervous system during <b>lengthening</b> (eccentric) differs from those used during shortening (concentric) and isometric contractions. The purpose of this review is to summarize current knowledge on the neural control of <b>lengthening</b> contractions. After a brief discussion of methodological issues that can confound the comparison between <b>lengthening</b> and shortening actions, the review provides evidence that untrained individuals are usually unable to fully activate their muscles during a maximal <b>lengthening</b> contraction and that motor unit activity during submaximal <b>lengthening</b> actions differs from that during shortening actions. Contrary to common knowledge, however, more recent studies have found that the recruitment order of motor units is similar during submaximal shortening and <b>lengthening</b> contractions, but that discharge rate is systematically lower during <b>lengthening</b> actions. Subsequently, the review examines the mechanisms responsible for the specific control of maximal and submaximal <b>lengthening</b> contractions as reported by recent studies on the modulation of cortical and spinal excitability. As similar modulation has been observed regardless of contraction intensity, it appears that spinal and corticospinal excitability are reduced during <b>lengthening</b> compared with shortening and isometric contractions. Nonetheless, the modulation observed during <b>lengthening</b> contractions is mainly attributable to inhibition at the spinal level. SCOPUS: re. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
