5|$|While {{working in}} the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo's {{interest}} in archaeology and old relics led him to reconstruct an armillary sphere from existing models {{as well as from}} ancient texts that could provide additional information. Shen used ancient mirrors while conducting his optics experiments. He observed ancient weaponry, describing the scaled sight devices on ancient crossbows and the ancients' production of swords with composite blades that had a midrib of wrought iron and <b>low-carbon</b> <b>steel</b> while having two sharp edges of high-carbon steel. Being a knowledgeable musician, Shen also suggested suspending an ancient bell by using a hollow handle. In his assessment of the carved reliefs of the ancient Zhuwei Tomb, Shen stated that the reliefs demonstrate genuine Han Dynasty (202 BC–220 AD) era clothing.|$|E
25|$|Soft <b>low-carbon</b> <b>steel</b> bits are inexpensive, but do {{not hold}} an edge well and require {{frequent}} sharpening. They are used only for drilling wood; even working with hardwoods rather than softwoods can noticeably shorten their lifespan.|$|E
25|$|Bits {{made from}} {{high-carbon}} steel are more durable than <b>low-carbon</b> <b>steel</b> bits {{due to the}} properties conferred by hardening and tempering the material.

30|$|Interstitial free (IF) steels are {{generally}} annealed in the ferrite (α) single region (Hashimoto et al. 1998; Mukunthan and Hawbolt 1996; Nishitani et al. 2011; Takechi 1994; Ye et al. 2002). In contrast, high-strength <b>low-carbon</b> <b>steels</b> {{used in the}} automobile industry are often annealed at the intercritical temperature (Garcia et al. 2005; Hayami et al. 1979; Goodman 1984; Takayama et al. 1982; Toji et al. 2011). During the intercritical annealing, recrystallization of α and formation of austenite (γ) can occur {{at the same time}} in <b>low-carbon</b> <b>steels.</b> Therefore, the microstructural evolution during intercritical annealing in <b>low-carbon</b> <b>steels</b> is sometimes complicated compared to IF steels.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose is}} the {{investigation}} of high-strength states in iron {{and a series of}} low-carbon steels; the states having been obtained due to the formation of a submicrocrystal structure through an intensive torsional strain under quasi-hydrostatic pressure and rolling. Electron-microscopic studies, an X-ray analysis and mechanical tests of samples of iron and <b>low-carbon</b> <b>steels</b> with a submicrocrystal structures have been made. The high-strength states in commercial <b>low-carbon</b> <b>steels</b> have been obtained and studied {{for the first time as}} a result of formation of fibrous submicrocrystal structures. A positive effect of non-equilibrium grain boundaries on the strength and toughness of steels of this kind has been detected. A new means of increasing a system of the mechanical properties of structural <b>low-carbon</b> <b>steels</b> via the formation of submicrocrystal structures in them has been suggested.

25|$|Case-hardening {{involves}} {{packing the}} low-carbon iron within a substance high in carbon, then heating this pack to encourage carbon migration into {{the surface of}} the iron. This forms a thin surface layer of higher carbon steel, with the carbon content gradually decreasing deeper from the surface. The resulting product combines much of the toughness of a <b>low-carbon</b> <b>steel</b> core, with the hardness and wear resistance of the outer high-carbon steel.|$|E

2500|$|The {{carbon content}} of steel greatly affects its machinability.

40|$|Austenite {{grain size}} is an {{important}} microstructure parameter when processing steels as it provides the initial condition for the austenite decomposition that determines the final microstructure and thus properties of the <b>steel.</b> In <b>low-carbon</b> <b>steels</b> it is frequently difficult if not impossible to quantify the austenite grain size using conventional metallographic techniques. Laserultrasonics provides an attractive alternative to quantify the grain size in-situ during thermomechanical processing of a steel sample. The attenuation of the laser generated ultrasound wave {{is a function of}} the grain size. The present paper gives an overview on the state-of-the-art of this novel measurement technique. Using isothermal and non-isothermal grain growth tests in <b>low-carbon</b> <b>steels</b> the advantages and limitations of laser-ultrasonic measurements will be demonstrated. Further, their application for deformed samples will be presented to quantify austenite grain sizes during and after recrystallization. The in-situ measurements provide significantly new insights into the austenite microstructure evolution during thermo-mechanical processing of <b>low-carbon</b> <b>steels.</b> The implications on expediting the development of improved process models will be discussed. 9 (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

30|$|We mainly {{examined}} the recrystallization of α {{and the formation}} of γ during intercritical annealing when the γ fraction was above 30  %.

The M1895 Lee rifle therefore received a rapid barrel rifling twist of one turn in 7.5 inches (19cm) (with right-hand twist) to keep the bullet from wobbling or tumbling at extended ranges.

On the other hand, when the 6mm bullet struck muscle or air-filled cavities such as the lungs, the bullet tended to make a perforating wound of small diameter that caused little damage.|$|E
