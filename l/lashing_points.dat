50|$|Lt Col Charles Pasley of the Royal School of Military Engineering at Chatham England {{developed}} {{a new form of}} pontoon which was adopted in 1817 by the British Army. Each pontoon was split into two halves, and the two pointed ends could be connected together in locations with tidal flow. Each half was enclosed, reducing the risk of swamping, and the sections bore multiple <b>lashing</b> <b>points.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Palsey {{developed}} {{a new form of}} pontoon bridge which was adopted in 1817 by the British Army. Each pontoon was split into two halves and you could connect two pointed ends together in cases where you had tidal flow. Each half was enclosed, so reducing the risk of swamping and there were multiple <b>lashing</b> <b>points.</b> The [...] "Pasley Pontoon" [...] lasted until it was replaced in 1836.|$|E
50|$|A D-ring is {{an item of}} hardware, {{usually a}} {{tie-down}} metal ring shaped like the letter D used primarily as a <b>lashing</b> <b>point.</b>|$|R
50|$|Pioneering-This badge {{recognizes the}} ability of a Scout in the area of Pioneering. The ability goes beyond a basic {{knowledge}} of knots and <b>lashing,</b> to the <b>point</b> that the Scout can create useful and creative items using easily obtained wooden poles and rope (including cord and string).|$|R
50|$|The flying {{jib-boom}} is secured, at its heel end, to the jib-boom by a boom {{iron and}} <b>lashing.</b> At its <b>point,</b> {{it has a}} sheave for the royal stay. Another sheave at the heel is for a heel rope. It is {{to the point that}} the tack of the flying jib sail is drawn out.|$|R
50|$|Postwar, Sea Otters were {{converted}} for civilian use. The cabin was soundproofed and fitted with heating. Seating for four passengers, a chemical toilet and a stowage for baggage were provided. As {{they were intended}} for use as Bush airplanes in remote areas, versatility was important. To allow cargo to be carried, the cabin floor was strengthened and fitted with <b>lashing</b> <b>points,</b> and the passenger seats made easily removable.|$|E
5000|$|There was a five door {{two seat}} panel van {{version of the}} Roomster called the Škoda Praktik (Typ 5J8). Its cargo space is 1605 mm long, 1016 mm wide (minimum), and 900 mm in height - giving a cargo load space of 1900 L, and a payload from 550 to 640 kg. It also {{includes}} a moveable internal load bulked, hidden underfloor storage, anti slip load bay floor covering with six <b>lashing</b> <b>points,</b> and full length roof rails.|$|E
40|$|At about 09301 on 21 May 2009, a {{crew member}} on board the general cargo ship Thor Gitta was fatally injured while {{attempting}} to secure lashing bins in the cargo hold. At the time, the ship was about 390 miles 2 northwest of Fremantle, Western Australia. The investigation found that a risk analysis had not been undertaken before the bins were introduced into service and that the bins had been inadequately secured {{in an area where}} there were no dedicated <b>lashing</b> <b>points.</b> It also found that the crew member was probably affected by fatigue {{as a result of the}} duty roster and the ship’s movement in the heavy seas. 1 All times referred to in this report are ship time, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) + 7 or + 8 hours. 2 A nautical mile of 1852 m. As a result of this accident, the ship’s manager has implemented a range of measures on all its vessels to improve the security of bin lashing arrangements and manage the risks of carrying out tasks associated with operation of the bins. The company has also introduced a different rostering system to better manage the fatigue of watchkeepers when the ship is at sea. The ATSB has issued one safety recommendation to the Danish Maritime Authority relating to the use of the 6 hour on/ 6 hour off work routine and the effect that that work routine has on {{a crew member}}’s level of fatigue...|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} frame backpack {{is a recent}} innovation, invented in 1967 by Greg Lowe, {{who went on to}} found Lowe Alpine and Lowepro, companies specializing in backpacks and other forms of carrying bags for various equipment. An internal-frame pack has a large fabric section around an {{internal frame}} composed of strips of either aluminum, titanium or plastic, sometimes with additional metal stays to reinforce the frame. A complex series of straps works with the frame to distribute the weight and hold it in place. The internal frame permits the pack to fit closely to the wearer's back and minimizes shifting of the load, which is desirable when participating in activities that involve upper-body movement such as scrambling over rocky surfaces and skiing. However, the tight fit reduces ventilation, so these type of packs tend to be more sweaty than external frame packs. The internal construction also allows for a large storage compartment; a few <b>lash</b> <b>points</b> (including webbing loops and straps for sleeping bags and other large items) may be present, but as the frame is completely integrated, it is difficult to securely lash larger and heavier items which do not fit inside the compartment to the outside of the pack. Internal frame packs originally suffered from smaller load capacity and less comfortable fit during steady walking, but newer models have improved greatly in these respects. In addition, because of their snug fit, the improved internal frame models have largely replaced external frame backpacks for many activities.|$|R
6000|$|Enter JOSEPHINE and NAPOLEON together, {{somewhat}} out of breath. [...] With careless suppleness {{she slides}} {{down on a}} couch and fans [...] herself. Now that the candle-rays reach her they show her mellow [...] complexion, her velvety eyes with long <b>lashes,</b> mouth with <b>pointed</b> [...] corners and excessive mobility beneath its duvet, and curls of [...] dark hair pressed down upon the temples by a gold band.|$|R
50|$|From 1977 - 1981, Lash {{played for}} various {{teams in the}} NHL minor leagues putting up above average numbers. Through 158 games <b>Lash</b> {{recorded}} 100 <b>points.</b> Shortly after a 1 game call-up from the NHL's Cleveland Barons, Lash went to West Germany to represent ECD Iserlohn, now the Iserlohn Roosters, in the Deutsche Eishockey Liga where he netted 27 goals and 14 assists in just 18 games. His career, while promising, was short-lived as it was plagued by injuries. Lash {{would be forced to}} retire from his professional career {{at the end of the}} 1980 - 81 season at the age of 23.|$|R
5000|$|In 2012, the RAF's Merlin HC3/3A fleet {{began to}} be {{transferred}} to the Royal Navy for use by the Commando Helicopter Force. Royal Navy personnel worked alongside RAF crew at Benson to build experience during the transition. A £454m Merlin Life Sustainment Programme will see 25 HC3/3A airframes fitted with the cockpit electronics of the HM2, folding tails and main rotor heads, strengthened landing gear, deck <b>lashing</b> mounting <b>points,</b> obsolescence updates, fast-roping points and a common emergency egress system. The first HC4 is to begin flight trials in September 2017, with an IOC in mid-2018; an interim folding main rotor head will be fitted to some HC3 for shipborne operations prior to the HC4 upgrade. [...] Command of the UK Merlin HC3/3A fleet was formally transferred from the RAF to the Royal Navy during a ceremony at RAF Benson on 30 September 2014. As part of the same ceremony, the RAF's 78 Sqn was disbanded and the Royal Navy's 846 Naval Air Squadron stood-up with the Merlin. [...] The RAF's 28(AC) continued to operate as part of the Commando Helicopter Force until July 2015, when 28(AC) Sqn stood down and 845 Naval Air Squadron stood-up. 846 NAS relocated from RAF Benson to RNAS Yeovilton in March 2015, with 845 NAS following in June 2016.|$|R
50|$|With Werner von Strucker {{comatose}} and hospitalized, May {{returns to}} the Playground and learns Andrew is at another facility, the Cocoon, re-assessing Joey Gutierrez. She goes there and confronts Andrew, revealing she knows he is <b>Lash,</b> at which <b>point</b> he panics and shoots her with an Icer. Lincoln secretly meets with Mack, explaining he has deduced how Lash found the other Afterlife Inhumans. Jiaying had a ledger containing a list of their names, which was recovered by SHIELD after her death, meaning someone inside SHIELD is Lash. Meanwhile, Fitz recovers data from the phone Simmons took to the barren planet, and is deeply moved when he finds a recording of her talking {{about the history of}} their friendship and the future she imagined them sharing. He also notices similarities between the logo of Project Distant Star and a symbol carved into the Monolith chamber in the Gloucestershire castle.|$|R
40|$|In an age {{of digital}} convergence, Scott <b>Lash</b> {{recommends}} some <b>points</b> beyond traditional perspectives of communication by interdisciplinary theorizing. Lash's argument in Critique of Information is that the earlier critical theory is no longer possible. In the global information order, what happens is a shift from a culture of representation to a technological culture. Technological achievement of communication itself, as say the reflexivity of technological objects, causes the unintended consequences. We should be moving from representational culture of epistemology to technological phenomenology. The critique of information takes place through shock-experience, and critique itself and the critic can only be the supplement The critique of information lies {{in the power of}} the "and" because there is no more transcendental or perfect theory outside. Is an older generation critical theory no longer possible? Lash's argument should be reexamined. However, it is possible that informationcritique must be inside of information. In addition, the study suggests that Lash has to accumulate more empirical research to complete his so-call "mediatheory" It then really helps the knowledge of communication fields moving forward...|$|R
5000|$|After elimination, Christi confronts Miranda {{about her}} {{comments}} that Christi was sloppy drunk during the elimination ceremony. The next morning, Antonio gathers the girls {{so they can}} {{play a game of}} [...] "Toni Says", where Tully emerges victorious and spends more time with her ex-husband: The other girls feel intimidated and spy on their alone time. Later, the women must compete in the main challenge, sculpting a clay figurine of Antonio as he poses nude. Autumn and Christi emerge victorious and Antonio and the two girls will later have a romantic boatride date. Meanwhile, the girls attend a disco with Antonio, where tension rises between the girls as Christi and Tania clash after Tania accuses her of being two-faced. After the date, Tully tells Jessica that she's too young for Antonio, and she <b>lashes</b> back and <b>points</b> out that Tully still lives in her parents and does not have a job. Miranda has not spent time with Antonio due to an allergic reaction to a spider bite, and the girls ponder why she's so confident that she's staying since she never spends time with Antonio. At elimination, Antonio says so long to Jessica, telling her that she's too young.|$|R
