To answer this question, we use novel comparative evidence on how {{the conflict between the}} dispossessed original owner and the bona fide purchaser of a stolen good is resolved in different countries. This is the most primitive manifestation of a fundamental legal choice: the balance between the protection of the owner’s property rights and the enhancement of the buyer’s reliance on contracts.

40|$|The main {{question}} of this PhD thesis is whether for legal and fiscal service providers, the Dutch anti-money laundering reporting duty {{that is based}} on the Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Act[1] (hereafter: Wwft) and its enforcement meet the principles of legal certainty, legal privilege, effectiveness and equivalence. This study starts with an introductory chapter and has four subsequent parts: the normative framework (Part I), the anti-money laundering reporting duty (Part II), enforcement (Part III) and conclusions and recommendations (Part IV). Part I Chapters 2 and 3 contain the normative framework. These chapters describe legal certainty, legal privilege, effectiveness and equivalence as principles of good enforcement. Chapter 3 describes legal privilege in more detail and studies {{the extent to which the}} confidential relationship between practising lawyers (advocaten) and their clients, is protected in case law of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), the European Court of Justice and the Dutch Hoge Raad. Part II Chapter 4 shows that the scope of the Money Laundering Directive has been substantially extended over time. Chapter 5 analyses the implementation of the anti-money laundering reporting duty and the legal-privilege exemption that are based on the Third Money Laundering Directive for legal and fiscal service providers in the Netherlands, Belgium, France, and England and Wales. Chapter 6 analyses how the legal-privilege exemption of the Third Money Laundering Directive should be interpreted with regard to practising lawyers, civil-law notaries, accountants and other legal and fiscal service providers, in order to comply with the criteria of protection of legal privilege, effectiveness, <b>legal</b> certainty and <b>equivalence.</b> Chapter 7 addresses a number of obscurities regarding the content and scope of the Wwft reporting duty for legal and fiscal service providers. Part III Chapter 8 is an introduction, offering an overview of the various existing systems of supervision of the various professions, the Dutch government’s views on this and the current developments regarding the supervision of civil-law notaries and practising lawyers. Chapter 9 analyses the external Wwft supervision by the Bureau Financial Supervision (hereafter: BFT). Chapter 10 describes the internal Wwft supervision by the KNB and the president of the notarial disciplinary court. Chapter 11 describes the internal Wwft supervision of practising lawyers, analysing it according to the principles of legal certainty, legal privilege, effectiveness and equivalence, and discusses proposals to enhance supervision. Chapter 12 discusses the internal Wwft supervision by the professional organisations of accountants and tax advisors. Chapter 13 shows that currently the disciplinary sanctions of the Wwft are not legally certain, not effective and not equivalent to the administrative sanctions through the Wwft regime and the Financial Supervision Act. Part IV The final chapter, Chapter 14, presents the conclusions and recommendations for each profession separately. [...] [1]Wet ter voorkoming van witwassen en financieren van terrorism...|$|R
40|$|In the {{old days}} {{demographic}} transitions were initiated by industrialization, but even todayhighly developed countries like Germany face new societal challenges when it comes todemographic change and the ensuing development in population. Population ageing, declineand heterogenization have implications on many aspects of life and adaptationmeasures at different levels will be necessary. A central question which has been predominantfor some years now, both in the scientific and political discussion about demographicchange, is how local quality of life can be sustained under these changing demographicconditions, especially in regions where the economic viability of services of general interestis endangered. It {{is driven by the}} constitutionally legitimized spatial planning principleof equal living conditions which should according to the social state principle guaranteeany citizen living conditions that ensure adequate social participation and free personalitydevelopment now and in the future. The place of residence in itself should therefore never turn into an individual disadvantage– a danger more prominent in rural areas due to structural circumstances. Neverthelessrural areas cannot be seen as homogeneous as the rural diversity in Germany shows. Thus,demographic change affects rural regions differently. Nevertheless population projectionspredict a future of demographic decline in all regions – rural or not – which will becomeapparent sooner or later. Since shrinking communities are under a high pressure to act,the focus lies on these regions as the intensive discussion on peripheral rural regions ofEastern Germany shows. But also demographically stable or growing rural regions willhave to deal with the foreseeable developments. The same is also true for the region "DerSelfkant" in the district of Heinsberg (North Rhine-Westphalia) which is currently developinga strategy for dealing with demographic change. In view of a still growing populationthe region is primarily faced with changes caused by population ageing, but also bypotential out-migration which is due to its proximity to urban areas in North Rhine-Westphalia and the Netherlands. The apparent and in shrinking societies even increasingdependency on migration reveals the vulnerability of growing regions, too. Therefore, sustaininglocal quality of life is of vital importance to regions and local authorities. Because the legislator describes this aim with vague <b>legal</b> terms like <b>equivalence</b> or adequacy,nevertheless providing with it a certain radius of operation which is to a certainextent required by the regional variability of demographic change, every region will haveto find its own answers. Taking this up, the thesis focusing on the Selfkant region aimed toidentify approaches derived from the citizen’s point-of-view. Tight public budgets and thepostulate of sustainability will require further consideration of this perspective in the future because only with the knowledge of existing needs adequate local quality of life canbe developed. In this context a written standardized survey was carried out in the Selfkantregion and inhabitants of at least 35 years of age were asked about their local quality oflife, defined by the essential areas provision of infrastructure, mobility, residential environmentand social integration. The objective was to gain knowledge of present demandsand of demands at old age with regard to the living environment. On the one hand theanalysis itself was undertaken in terms of personal characteristics like age and mobility,both of which gain importance in terms of coping with every-day life. On the other handthe analysis was differentiated according to the residential location (municipality, district). The inclusion of the subcommunal level takes account of the increasing need for asmall-scale view on demographic changes, because these are noticed locally, they continueto be heterogeneous and influence the subjective well-being at the place of residence substantially. Despite a high degree of residential satisfaction typical for rural areas the interviewedinhabitants judge their living community on average to be only moderate. How much localquality of life depends on the factor of mobility becomes clear in two observations: Respondentsshow a higher dissatisfaction with certain aspects of their local quality of lifewhen they are in need of personal assistance. Furthermore, aspects of supply have beenidentified as important motives for moving. A comparative analysis with objective livingconditions has also shown that subjective views do actually reflect these objective conditions,resulting in a possible critical reflection of local developments. Whether living in arural area becomes disadvantageous is determined, in the end, by the accessibility of basicinfrastructure facilities, especially local grocery and medical care, or by available opportunitiesto compensate deficits in infrastructure. In the view of changing conditions the resultsof the study necessarily lead to the question whether rural areas should rather beunderstood as residential locations for certain stages of life and whether the role of individualdecisions for residential location and its possible impacts on the general publicshould be more intensively discussed in terms of {{the quality of life in}} rural areas...|$|R

The memo also states the opposing case - that if the court system in Bulgaria had considered the evidence of Witness A, and that the conviction of Shields should stand, a pardon would require [...] "further deliberation". Further, it stated that should the conviction of Shields be overturned in Bulgaria, that Merseyside police would render [...] "all assistance formally requested (from the Bulgarian police) in dealing with (Graham) Sankey" [...] who had made and then retracted a public confession to the crime, As Sankey retracted his confession and refused to return to Bulgaria to be interviewed by police or appear in court, it was inadmissible as evidence there. The memo states that Graham Sankey, Anthony Wilson and Bradley Thompson [...] "refused to cooperate entirely with Merseyside police during the inquiry". No explicit identification of Witness A was made in the police report.|$|E

UK Verify, the new Electronic Identity (eID) Management {{system of}} the UK Government, has been {{promoted}} as a state-of-the-art privacy-preserving system, designed around demands for better privacy and control, and is the first eID {{system in which the}} government delegates the provision of identity to competing private third parties. Under the EU eIDAS, Member States can allow their citizens to transact with foreign services by notifying their national eID systems. Once a system is notified, all other Member States are obligated to incorporate it into their electronic identification procedures. The paper offers a discussion of Gov. UK Verify's compliance with eIDAS as well as Gov. UK Verify's potential <b>legal</b> <b>equivalence</b> to EU systems under eIDAS as a third-country legal framework after Brexit. To this end it examines the requirements set forth by eIDAS for national eID systems, classifies these requirements in relation to their ratio legis and organises them into five sets. The paper proposes a more thorough framework than the current regime to decide on <b>legal</b> <b>equivalence</b> and attempts a first application in the case of Gov. UK Verify. It then assesses Gov.

30|$|In the UK {{there is}} the {{so-called}} foreclosure, which could {{be defined as a}} debt enforcement procedure aimed at recovering money owed to secured creditors (Djankov et al. 2008). Derived from the above definition we must directly rule out a direct <b>legal</b> <b>equivalence</b> between foreclosure and ejecución oracción hipotecaria. That is, we must be very specific when using these terms. Therefore, we should “translate” ejecución de un bien mueble pignorado (acción pignoraticia) as a foreclose on a pledged movable asset under UK Law. Then, if the property is an immovable asset (e.g. a building, a plant, the entrepreneur’s home), we could use the term “mortgage over land and buildings” foreclosures {{in the case of an}} execution (acción hipotecaria in Spain). In the main text we simplify the terminology and, for brevity of exposition, we use the term mortgage foreclosure.|$|E

40|$|Translation {{as a test}} of {{language}} vitality. Today the claim that “Europe speaks with a single voice in many languages” is considered necessary for European integration. But awareness of the controversies related to <b>legal</b> <b>equivalence</b> grows, while the concept of linguistic ‘equivalence’ remains an axiomatic attribute of the different language versions, not a quality that can be modified and demonstrated. Although EU institutions request their translators to pay attention to different registers and diverse styles, lexical vagueness and weak logical connections spread a sense of approximation that makes the voice of Europe distant from ordinary language and occasionally quite unpalatable. The gap between the aims of multilingualism and the reality of translation has increased attention for the flexibility and adaptation of the national languages. If a phenomenon of ‘Europeanization’ of all languages is underway, {{this is due to the}} increasing pressure of English. Thus the question to be asked is whether the EU still functions as an agency {{of language}} maintenance or rather of language shift? The authors of the following papers seek to answer this question not so much from the general interaction between English and their different mother tongues, but more specifically between English as a lingua franca and the Europeanised varieties of national languages as they are now used and promoted by EU institutions...|$|E
40|$|A {{trademark}} 2 ̆ 7 s {{or trade}} dress 2 ̆ 7 2 ̆ 2 commercial impression 2 ̆ 2 {{is the meaning}} or idea it conveys to consumers. Courts and administrative tribunals sometimes are confronted with deciding whether a mark or dress generates a 2 ̆ 2 continuing commercial impression. 2 ̆ 2 In some instances, this arises in regard to questions of abandonment [...] although a mark or trade dress has not been used {{for a period of}} time, the trier of fact must determine whether the public continues to have accurate lingering impressions associated with that mark or dress. In other instances, because corporations periodically make slight modifications to their marks and trade dress in an effort to update and modernize them, triers of fact are called on to determine whether the newer mark or dress generates a 2 ̆ 2 continuing commercial impression 2 ̆ 2 among the relevant public. Essentially holding that <b>legal</b> <b>equivalence</b> is a matter of law, in arriving at their determination of continuing commercial impression, triers of fact have relied upon argument and their own inclinations. We argue for a broadening of this perspective. Marks are deemed to be legal equivalents if they create the same continuing commercial impression. As the impression is one that is created in consumers, it seems counterintuitive to conclude that the only relevant evidence is that of an antiseptic analysis of the visual or aural appearance of the marks themselves. Rather, the determination of whether marks are legal equivalents is more properly a mixed question of fact and law [...] one that, as in other contexts, can be tested by a range of evidence, including consumer survey evidence. We then go on to describe and discuss the only two known occasions where survey evidence has been gathered and proffered in regard to assessing 2 ̆ 2 continuing commercial impression, 2 ̆ 2 and draw implications from these for future efforts at using consumer survey evidence to support a claim of continuing commercial impression...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} Doctoral Thesis {{presented here}} is entitled Translation in the European Parliament: {{a study of}} technical and administrative communication texts. Among the different research areas in institutional translation, the present research work attempts to study and discuss UE texts concerned with political, legal, economic and technical and scientific areas, and its main goals are: 1. To identify the linguistic features characteristic of technical and administrative communication texts produced by the European Parliament:  Description of discursive aspects.  Description of the linguistic aspect.  Description and interpretation of rhetorical aspects: nature of the chosen texts and their pragmatic purpose. 2. To determine the most appropriate translation methods to be applied in this case. The main hypothesis {{of this research is}} the following: Have technical and administrative communication texts common linguistic features in their English, French and Spanish versions? And if they do have them, will these features be useful for institutional translators? In EU texts translation we theoretically rely on the notion of equivalence to the original; this notion of equivalence to the original has been a debated issue for ages in translation studies and it has been approached by several authors (W. Wilss, 1982; K. Reiss and H. J. Vermeer, 1991; Ch. Nord 1991; 1997; G. Toury 1997). Another problem raised by translation scholars has been how to get the original text and its translation to be «the same text» when all the factors involved in the process are by definition different (J. R. Catford, 1965; B. Hatim and I. Mason 1990; 1998); A. Neubert & G. Shreve, 1992). In addition, EU texts translation posed another problem in addition to the language problem of equivalence, namely, that the equivalence must also be "legal" in principle. Therefore, the translation of EU texts requires identical formulation in each of the official languages (Jover González-Gómez, 2002). Thus, we argue that the <b>legal</b> <b>equivalence</b> is what differentiates the EU texts from other international organizations texts, as theoretically in the former there is neither source text nor target text, the translator having to produce another source text with equal legal validity. (A. Pym 1999). In sum, the translator must reconcile unity and diversity in performing their task, while [...] ...|$|E
