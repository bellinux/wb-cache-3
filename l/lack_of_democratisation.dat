2500|$|For many, the {{political}} context surrounding the 2005 summit — the stagnation of the Middle East Peace Process, the US-led war on Iraq, the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>democratisation</b> in Arab countries, {{and the war}} on terror's negative effects on freedoms and human rights, among others—proved for many the inefficiency of the Barcelona Process for fulfilling its objectives of peace, stability and prosperity. Given these circumstances, even politicians that had been engaged with the Barcelona Process since its very beginnings, like the Spanish politician Josep Borrell, expressed their disappointment about the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership and its incapacity to deliver results. Critiques from Southern Mediterranean countries blamed the Partnership's failure on Europe's lack of interest towards the Mediterranean in favour of its Eastern neighbourhood; whereas experts from the North accused Southern countries of only being interested on [...] "their own bi-lateral relationship with the EU" [...] while downplaying multilateral policies.|$|E

Last year, when eight authors participated, {{the main focus}} was on national elections and good electoral practice as a major instrument <b>of</b> <b>democratisation</b> in the SADC region. This year, the main focus is on civil society as an instrument <b>of</b> <b>democratisation.</b> In addition, three articles were commissioned to discuss key problem areas that affect {{the region as a}} whole: the nature of liberation movements as governments, the struggle for gender equality in governance, and the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> harmonised instruments to guide and assess elections...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} how {{an assessment}} of East Asian states helps us test concepts <b>of</b> <b>democratisation.</b> It argues {{that many of the}} analytical approaches deployed by democratisation scholars reflect the contexts in which the majority <b>of</b> <b>democratisation</b> studies have been developed. In particular, they underplay the significance <b>of</b> the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> separation of state and economy – of public and private – that predominates in much of the developing world. It argues that democratisation studies can be enhanced by engaging with the insights provided by international political economy approaches – particularly, but not only, in relation to the study of East Asia. This working paper is a chapter from the forthcoming book Democratization Through the Looking Glass, edited by Peter Burnell, for publication by Manchester University Press in 2003. The book contains different perspectives of several disciplines such as international political economy, legal scholarship, sociology and women’s studies, together with the insights of different area studies. It advances the case for a broadly based comparative study <b>of</b> <b>democratisation,</b> while arguing that multidisciplinarity will enhance our understanding far more than a narrow political science approach...|$|R

40|$|As a {{culturally}} distinctive region, Asia {{was chosen as}} the sample for this study. This empirical study investigated what the major trends <b>of</b> <b>democratisation</b> were in Asia between 1981 and 2005 : why some countries became democratic while other countries failed to follow suit during that period. The main research hypothesis was: “That is it was mainly economic development that drove democratisation in Asia between 1981 and 2005 ”. Although some studies have studied the impact of economic development on democratisation in Asia, their findings have been inconclusive and focuses sometimes different. [To investigate the research hypothesis, 24 Asian countries were selected…measurement tools used etc…] For this research work, statistical and case study methods were applied. The data used in the analyses were collected from established data sources e. g. Freedom House (Freedom in the World, n. d.) and United Nations Statistics Division (UN Stat, n. d.). Repeated Measures in Linear Mixed Modeling (LMM) were used to analyse the quantitative data. Three case studies supplemented the findings of statistical analyses. Historical information and institutional and legal facts were also used in the case studies. This study found that increases in the level of economic development along with its equitable distribution in society and positive roles of political actors increase the level <b>of</b> <b>democratisation</b> in Asia. Some pro-democratic political and social institutions, such as tradition of parliamentarianism, and international organisations, for example Bretton wood institutions, also led to democratisation. A low extent of national political divide was found to result in a considerably high level <b>of</b> <b>democratisation</b> in a country where confrontation between major political forces is the main feature of politics. This study also found that a partial democracy with Asian values, economic legitimacy, a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> corruption and a “systematic control” over opposition politicians can survive, and is not prone to higher level <b>of</b> <b>democratisation.</b> The Taiwan case revealed that, amongst other factors, the role of political actors and economic equity along with economic development is also vital for democratisation. The Singapore case explained how a “hybrid regime” in a rich country outsmarts <b>democratisation.</b> The study <b>of</b> Bangladesh provides an idea about other elements, e. g. lower level of political confrontation, that push for higher levels <b>of</b> <b>democratisation...</b>|$|R

40|$|The crises <b>of</b> <b>democratisation</b> in Africa {{have not}} been {{properly}} focused on in its primacy, the economic dynamics of democracy. As such this study focuses on the economics <b>of</b> <b>democratisation</b> which {{is out of the}} agenda of most African countries. Although Africans and Western do-gooders of democracy pretend to offer Africa the liverages of economic development, they have always done the contrary with the assistance of their local collaborators. The global regime of capital has always worked against Africa’s democratisation as it undermines Africa’s economic progress which strengthens Euro-American democracy in its fundamental of material base. Thus capitalist law of uneven-development which aids the realisation problem of advance capital strengthens democracy in Europe and North America and underdevelops democracy in Africa. This is the logic of the crises <b>of</b> <b>democratisation</b> in Africa and can only be overcome by a home or African grown development processes and the stoppage of flight of capital to Europe and North America...|$|R
5000|$|Rai's {{work on a}} gendered {{analysis}} of the processes <b>of</b> <b>democratisation,</b> and in particular women's access to political and national and local development institutions, has contributed enormously to the debates in the field. In 2000 she edited International Perspectives on Gender and Democratization, {{which was one of}} the first books in this area. In this book Rai raised important questions about the nature of the third wave <b>of</b> <b>democratisation</b> and its complex effect on gender relations in the developing work. A distinctive framing <b>of</b> <b>democratisation</b> in her work concerns not only new but consolidated democracies such as India; Rai suggests that engendering state institutions in these countries forms part <b>of</b> the <b>democratisation</b> process and should not be overlooked. Her work on women MPs in the Indian parliament, funded by the Nuffield Foundation, remains one of the only studies of its kind and has led to Rai working with United Nations organisations such as UNDP, Division for Women's Advancement, Department for Economic and Social Affairs and Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance for consultancy work, and public speaking engagements. She also published a United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Report: Achieving Gender Equality in Public Offices in Pakistan.|$|R

40|$|A wave {{of recent}} {{research}} has attempted to explain within-country variations {{in the rise of}} primary schooling by studying local political and economic conditions. There is a particular focus {{on the role of the}} spread <b>of</b> <b>democratisation</b> and local elites in the development of schooling. An important lesson coming out of these studies is that conditions varied markedly between countries and over time. This paper studies the development of primary schools in rural Sweden after the school reform of 1842 in the context <b>of</b> industrialisation and <b>democratisation</b> <b>of</b> Swedish society. The findings give support to an elite-control interpretation of the spread of schooling in the latter half of the 19 century, rather than a bottom-up movement related to the spread <b>of</b> <b>democratisation.</b> This can be explained by the fact that Sweden remained an elite-democracy during the period and that industrialisation was relatively late...|$|R

40|$|There is an {{abundant}} {{literature on the}} Spanish transition to democracy as viewed from {{the level of the}} Spanish national polity and of the national political elites. The view from civil society and from particular localities is much less explored. This book fills this gap by seeking to understand the process <b>of</b> <b>democratisation</b> from the local level, the level of politics closest to the ordinary citizen. Through an empirical case study of politics in the city of Barcelona, this book sheds light on the relationship between democratisation and citizen participation in associations and social movements within civil society. The focus is on both the process <b>of</b> <b>democratisation</b> and the outcome of that process, namely, the kind of democracy established. At the core of the book are three questions. First, what role did citizen participation play in the process <b>of</b> <b>democratisation?</b> Second, what was the impact of citizen participation on the kind of democracy established? And finally, what are the consequences of trying to create a more participatory democracy within the shell of capitalist, liberal democracy?

40|$|After nearly 30 {{years in}} power, the Hosni Mubarak regime in Egypt, {{considered}} by many to be the strongest in the Arab world, collapsed suddenly in February 2011 after a mere 18 days of street protests. In this article, we try to explain the puzzling collapse of the Mubarak regime using regime transition theory. We argue that the Mubarak regime’s collapse came about as a result of four key developments, none of which were sufficient to cause the regime’s collapse, but when coalesced together exposed the regime’s <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> coercive and persuasive powers, thereby hastening its demise. We conclude that regime transition theory, developed to explain the third wave <b>of</b> <b>democratisations</b> in the 1970 s and 1980 s, is still relevant in explaining transitions from authoritarian rule...|$|R

40|$|The {{point of}} {{departure}} for the Power, Conflict and Democracy Programme (PCD) is the critique of the two conventional explanations for the problems <b>of</b> <b>democratisation</b> in the global South for being empirically mistaken and based on narrow and static theory. 2 We argue that the root causes for the crisis <b>of</b> <b>democratisation</b> are neither poor application of the mainstream model (emphasising elitist pacts and institution-building in return for more privatisation and self management), nor that democracy is premature due the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> sufficient preconditions. Rather, the more fundamental dilemma is the depoliticisation of democracy {{and the fact that the}} paradigms are unable to conceptualise the problems and options involved. This inability is because the proponents of both the dominant arguments agree on a narrow definition of democracy in terms of freedoms and fair elections – and then either neglect the basic conditions or say they have to be created beforehand by other means. The result is that both paradigms exclude by definition approaches that focus less on democratic rules of the game in themselves and more on how these institutions may be used and expanded in favour of improved social, economic and other conditions. Given that such social democratic oriented paths have been quite important, especially in the transition of the previously poor Scandinavian countries into welfare states, and that adapted versions are now gaining ground in paradigmatic cases such as Brazil, there is an obvious need to widen the perspective...|$|R
