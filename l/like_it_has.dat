It is built in provincial Neoclassical style with massive columns and arches. However, {{the back of the}} structure is very different, as it is an irregular pattern of brickwork, which looks <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> half collapsed. In reality, the structure was never completed. Since 1906, the city has promised to finish the building, but never has. Even the federal government in 1975 announced plans to not only finish the building but restore many of the churches and plazas, but they never came to fruition.|$|E

[...] Reviews for The Hungry Saw described the album as containing [...] "foreboding, compelling soul", and [...] "blue-eyed/black-lung balladry with classic soul touches-- warm Hammond organ tones, tambourine-rattled rhythms, female back-up singers" [...] that were [...] "remarkably in tune with contemporary British pop music's neo-soul slant".|$|E

Madhureeta Mukherjee of The Times of India gave the film a 4/5 rating and said, [...] "Ranbir, in the most challenging performance of his career leaves us 'dumbstruck'.

Further, the sales of One Touch and its last three singles, [...] "New Year", [...] "Run for Cover" [...] and [...] "Soul Sound", failed to meet the expectations of London Records and the group was subsequently dropped. Band member Keisha Buchanan has stated that the song's release and subsequent commercial underperformance was a positive experience because, saying: [...] "Everything happens for a reason and it looks <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> all worked out".

500|$|Roger Ebert {{noted that}} the {{majority}} of the film was shot indoors, where oblong sets, corridors, and small spaces manifest constriction and tightness, in contrast to the usual emphasis on sweep and majesty in historical dramas. Hooper used wide shots to capture the actors' body language, particularly Geoffrey Rush, who trained at L'École Internationale de Théâtre Jacques Lecoq in Paris and [...] "is consequently brilliant in the way he carries his body". Hooper widened his scope first to capture Rush's gestures, then full body movements and silhouettes. The approach carried over to Firth as well. In the first consultation scene, the Duke is squeezed against the end of a long couch framed against a large wall, [...] "as if to use the arm of the sofa as a kind of friend, as a security blanket?"

500|$|Rossio and Marsilii {{believe that}} many of the {{negative}} reviews of Déjà Vu are a direct result of Scott's direction of the film, and have stated that [...] "Tony Scott added nothing to Déjà Vu and made several hundred small mistakes and about eight or nine deadly mistakes", which makes the film seem <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> many unforgivable plot holes, when it should not have had any. [...] "here are no plot holes at all, and scrutiny reveals the plot to be air tight." [...] says Rossio. [...] "We had years to think of all this and work it out." [...] It was felt there were many misunderstandings that Scott's take on the plot introduced into the film. In his own defense, Scott cited in an interview with Iain Blair of BNET that only nineteen weeks were provided for the production of the film, which [...] "isn't a lot for a film like Déjà Vu." ...|$|E

500|$|Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone {{believed}} [...] "Fifteen" [...] was exemplary in that [...] "Swift is a songwriting savant with {{an intuitive}} gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture". Rosen compared her songwriting in the track {{to that of}} producers Dr. Luke and Max Martin, who he referred to as [...] "Swedish pop gods". He continued, [...] "Her music mixes an almost impersonal professionalism — it's so rigorously crafted it sounds <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been scientifically engineered in a hit factory — with confessions that are squirmingly intimate and true." [...] Jonathon Keefe of Slant Magazine considered the bridge one of the nicer moments of Fearless, but was unimpressed with Swift's singing, particularly in the outro. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic found [...] "Fifteen", in which Swift portrayed {{the role of a}} big sister instead of a big star, {{to be one of the}} best and the most personal song on Fearless. Ken Tucker of Billboard magazine believed [...] "Fifteen" [...] could appeal with teenagers looking for hope and adult women reminiscing the past. Leah Greenbelt of Entertainment Weekly stated, [...] "When she sings about sexuality, she sounds like a real teen, not some manufactured vixen-Lolita".|$|E

The show served as part {{one of the}} two-part [...] "Glorious Excess" [...] series, with the second installment [...] "Glorious Excess (DIES)" [...] due at JANM on August 22, 2009. Shinoda commented on the inspiration behind the Glorious Excess series, stating, [...] "It Got {{to a point where}} the pervasiveness of 'celebrity news' concerned me. It seemed <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> jumped out of its niche into places where it doesn't belong. I would be watching the news, and thinking, 'of all the things {{going on in the world}} right now, why are they covering so-and-so's breakup?' It didn't make sense to me. Add to that the fact that I'm supposed to somehow 'belong' to that celebrity group—and I really don't feel like I do in a lot of ways—and you can see how the topic started to become really interesting to me. The Glorious Excess (BORN) show was my way of diving into those topics, trying to find answers. It follows a central 'celebrity' character, who is filthy rich, slightly violent, and famous without any particular skill or talent." ...|$|E
500|$|Hoffman {{explained}} {{the key to}} his changeup was how he pinched the seam of the ball with his thumb and index finger as he released it. He threw the changeup with the arm speed used to throw a fastball, and the spin and movement of the ball looked the same to the batter. His changeup ranged from 73–76mph. Bruce Bochy, who managed Hoffman for over a decade with the Padres, said of Hoffman's changeup: [...] "He pitched so well off his fastball [...] couldn't just sit on it every pitch." [...] "You could be sitting on [...] and still not be successful with it", says former player Mark Sweeney. It was the arm action on the change up and the late sink just before it reached the plate that allowed Hoffman to stay successful over the years. With opponents flailing to slow down their swings, teammates nicknamed Hoffman's changeup The Bugs Bunny Pitch after a famous Bugs Bunny cartoon episode. [...] "Some [...] fool you. Some guys overpower you. Hoffman embarrasses you", said former rival and later teammate Mike Piazza. After striking out on a changeup to end the game against Hoffman, Dodger catcher Paul Lo Duca said, [...] "It's <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> a parachute on it." [...] As Hoffman lost velocity on his fastball throughout his career, he compensated by maintaining a notable speed differential between that pitch and his changeup. He initially kept the grip of his changeup a secret. [...] "I was a little weird about it", Hoffman said. [...] "I didn't like talking about how I threw the change. I didn't want people to see how I gripped the ball. I thought I'd be giving away something to the hitters." [...] Later in his career, he posed for pictures of his grip, figuring everyone had seen it.|$|E

The film is hypnotically entertaining, and it is funny without once being gaggy, {{but it is also}} rather harrowing." [...] Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times opined that it was [...] "the picture that science fiction fans of every age and in every corner of the world have prayed (sometimes forlornly) that the {{industry}} might some day give them. It is an ultimate statement of the science fiction film, an awesome realization of the spatial future... it is a milestone, a landmark for a spacemark, in the art of film." [...] Louise Sweeney of The Christian Science Monitor felt that 2001 was [...] "a brilliant intergalactic satire on modern technology. It's also a dazzling 160-minute tour on the Kubrick filmship through the universe out there beyond our earth." [...] Philip French wrote that the film was [...] "perhaps the first multi-million-dollar supercolossal movie since D.W. Griffith's Intolerance fifty years ago which can be regarded as the work of one man...Space Odyssey is important as the high-water mark of science-fiction movie making, or at least of the genre's futuristic branch." [...] The Boston Globe's review indicated that it was [...] "the world's most extraordinary film. Nothing <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> ever been shown in Boston before or, for that matter, anywhere... The film is as exciting as the discovery of a new dimension in life." [...] Roger Ebert gave the film four stars in his original review, believing the film [...] "succeeds magnificently on a cosmic scale." [...] He later put it on his Top 10 list for Sight & Sound. Time provided at least seven different mini-reviews of the film in various issues in 1968, each one slightly more positive than the preceding one; in the final review dated December 27, 1968, the magazine called 2001 [...] "an epic film about the history and future of mankind, brilliantly directed by Stanley Kubrick.
