We show how IEC can be used to quickly find the most informative <b>linear</b> <b>projection(s).</b> In another, more complex example, IEC is used to evolve the “true ” metric of attribute space.

Subsequently, this can for instance be used to detect the occupation of specific frequency bands, which has applications in cognitive radio. Surprisingly, if the span of the random <b>linear</b> <b>projections</b> is larger than the period of the cyclostationary signals, the cyclic power spectrum can be recovered without putting any sparsity constraints on it, which allows for simple least squares reconstruction methods.

40|$|Abstract. Compressive Sensing is an {{emerging}} field {{based on the}} revelation that {{a small group of}} nonadaptive <b>linear</b> <b>projections</b> of a compressible signal contains enough information for reconstruction and processing. In this paper, we propose algorithms and hardware to support a new theory of Compressive Imaging. Our approach is based on a new digital image/video camera that directly acquires random projections of the light field without first collecting the pixels/voxels. Our camera architecture employs a digital micromirror array to perform optical calculations of <b>linear</b> <b>projections</b> of an image onto pseudorandom binary patterns. Its hallmarks include the ability to obtain an image with a single detection element while measuring the image/video fewer times than the number of pixels/voxels; this can significantly reduce the computation required for video acquisition/encoding. Since our system relies on a single photon detector, it can also be adapted to image at wavelengths that are currently impossible with conventional CCD and CMOS imagers. We are currently testing a prototype design for the camera and include experimental results.

40|$|When {{processing}} massive data sets, a core task is {{to construct}} synopses of the data. To be useful, a synopsis data structure should be easy to construct while also yielding good approximations of the relevant properties of the data set. A particularly useful class of synopses are sketches, i. e., those based on <b>linear</b> <b>projections</b> of the data. These are applicable in many models including various parallel, stream, and compressed sensing settings. A rich body of analytic and empirical work exists for sketching numerical data such as the frequencies {{of a set of}} entities. Our work investigates graph sketching where the graphs of interest encode the relationships between these entities. The main challenge is to capture this richer structure and build the necessary synopses with only linear measurements. In this paper we consider properties of graphs including the size of the cuts, the distances between nodes, and the prevalence of dense sub-graphs. Our main result is a sketch-based sparsifier construction: we show that O̅(nε- 2) random <b>linear</b> <b>projections</b> of a graph on n nodes suffice to (1 + ε) approximate all cut values. Similarly, we show that O(ε- 2) <b>linear</b> <b>projections</b> suffice for (additively) approximating the fraction of induced sub-graphs that match a given pattern such as a small clique. Finally, for distance estimation we present sketch-based spanner constructions. In this last result the sketches are adaptive, i. e., the <b>linear</b> <b>projections</b> are performed in a small number of batches where each projection may be chosen dependent on the outcome of earlier sketches. All of the above results immediately give rise to data stream algorithms that also apply to dynamic graph streams where edges are both inserted and deleted. The non-adaptive sketches, such as those for sparsification and subgraphs, give us single-pass algorithms for distributed data streams with insertion and deletions. The adaptive sketches can be used to analyze MapReduce algorithms that use a small number of rounds...|$|R
