Integration of optical components onto a microfluidic chip offers numerous new possibilities {{in the field}} of particle and cell analysis, but reconfigurable on-chip light positioning {{is still one of the}} major challenges. The recently developed device is built up as a liquid-core/liquid-cladding waveguide which enables versatile adjustment possibilities. Provided with a new input coupling region, the coupling efficiency was improved and straight light guidance could be ensured.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical simulation of the liquid–solid flow in a 12 -way coal distributor {{used in a}} coal preparation plant. The liquid flow, coupled with gas-flow, is determined by a homogeneous multiphase model by computational fluid dynamics (CFD). A strong swirling and non-uniform flow is obtained. The fluid–solid interaction is determined based on the CFD results. Then, discrete element method (DEM) is employed to calculate the solid flow in the distributor. The effects of some key variables {{on the distribution of}} both fluid outlets and solid outlets are studied through the numerical experiments. The particle–fluid interactions are analyzed {{in order to understand the}} reasons for the maldistribution of the coal particle phase.

30|$|The {{streamlines}} {{inside the}} air and water phases for a superficial liquid velocity of 0.10  m/s and superficial gas velocities of 31.77  m/s 18.03  m/s downstream of the <b>liquid</b> <b>inlet</b> section are presented in Fig.  3 a, b, respectively, to show {{the characteristics of the}} flow field. It can be seen that when the amplitude of the forming wave at the <b>liquid</b> <b>inlet</b> section reaches its maximum value, it starts to move upwards. In Fig.  3 a, the liquid phase travels as thin film and it is carried out of the pipe due to the higher gas velocity (31.77  m/s) resulting in an annular flow pattern. The waves in this flow pattern tend to be flatter. All simulated cases that fall within the annular flow regime show that all the liquid film moves upward out of the pipe. As the superficial gas velocity reduces to 18.03  m/s, the drag force imparted on the liquid film becomes insufficient to carry the liquid phase to the pipe exit section while keeping the typical annular flow pattern. As a result, the liquid film thickens, thus producing a circulatory flow region in the liquid phase causing part of the liquid film to move downward near the pipe wall. This is accompanied by the formation of flooding waves that have higher frequencies and tends to cause the continuous throwing of the liquid phase (water) in the region located above the <b>liquid</b> <b>inlet</b> section. In all the simulated cases that fall under the churn flow regime, part of the liquid film flows downwards periodically. This is considered to be the on-set of film reversal and the accompanied gas velocity is called the critical gas velocity.|$|E
40|$|A {{particle}} injector device provides {{injection of}} particles into a liquid stream. The device includes a funnel portion comprising a conical member having side walls tapering from a top opening (which receives the particles) {{down to a}} relatively smaller exit opening. A funnel inlet receives {{a portion of the}} liquid stream and the latter is directed onto the side walls of the conical member so as to create a cushion of liquid against which the particles impact. A main section of the device includes an inlet port in communication with the exit opening of the funnel portion. A main <b>liquid</b> <b>inlet</b> receives the main portion of the liquid stream at high pressure and low velocity and a throat region located downstream of the main <b>liquid</b> <b>inlet</b> accelerates liquid received by this inlet from the low velocity to a higher velocity so as to create a low pressure area at the exit opening of the funnel portion. An outlet opening of the main section enables the particles and liquid stream to exit from the injector device.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, {{phenomena}} associated with counter current flow limitation (CCFL) were experimentally investigated using small diameter tubes {{in order to}} suggest criterion for which the oil return is secured. The test section is made of Pyrex glass tube to allow visual observation. The inner diameter of the test tube is 7 mm and the height is 1 m. The inclination of test tubes varied from vertical to crank type with various horizontal lengths. Waterair flow and lubricant oil-air flow were examined {{through a series of}} experiment at various liquid flow rates. In this experimental study, flow reversal and flooding phenomena were visually observed and two-phase flow rate were measured. Flow reversal point represents the air flow rate when the liquid film begins to flow downwards in the tube below the <b>liquid</b> <b>inlet</b> location. Whole supplied liquid flows upward when the gas flow rate is larger than this value. So the flow reversal point can be interpreted as oil return criterion and the flow reversal points were measured using various shape of test section {{in a wide range of}} liquid flow rate. The gas velocities for the flow reversal point appeared to be similar over a certain range of liquid flow rate. Flooding point was defined as the air flow rate when liquid starts to flow above the <b>liquid</b> <b>inlet</b> part. The air flow rate needed to cause flooding is inversely proportional to the liquid flow rate. Both flow reversal and flooding velocity also depend on the inclination angle, horizontal length and liquid property...|$|E
