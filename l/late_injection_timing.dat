40|$|This {{study was}} {{concerned}} {{with the performance of}} biofuels in diesel engines. Generally, the basic combustion and emission characteristics of Rapeseed Oil (RSO) and Soya Oil (SO) result in a lower in-cylinder pressure peak than diesel. This led to the reduction of Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) emissions and to relatively high soot emissions. Further measurements of RSO were done in order to investigate the influence of injection pressure, injection timing and Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) on combustion and emission characteristics. A high soot emission from RSO was reduced by increased injection pressure. Moreover, injection timing also had to be varied {{in order to reduce the}} soot emissions from RSO. The retarded injection timing (3 deg bTDC) and increased injection pressure (1200 bar) for the blend of 30 % RSO resulted in a reduction of soot emission to the same level as from diesel fuel. Further investigation regarding the soot emissions was done for Rapeseed Methyl Ester (RME) under turbocharged engine operation. The application of the boost pressure resulted in stable engine operation at a <b>late</b> <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> of 5 deg aTDC. A simultaneous reduction of soot and NOx emissions has been achieved for RME at an injection timing of TDC and high EGR percentage (40 – 50 %) ...|$|E
40|$|High {{pressure}} ratio (PR) {{compressed natural gas}} (CNG) jets are studied using optical diagnostics under quiescent but realistic spark-ignited (SI) engine conditions. CNG jets were issued impulsively from a bespoke direct injector. Observations into the delivery characteristics for a large {{pressure ratio}} (PR) range were carried out (8. 3 <PR< 400). Non-dimensional scaling laws show that the penetration rate can be represented by a single relationship. The penetration rate is the primary determinant of fuel targeting. Additionally, the jet growth rate and spread angle are also presented. The evolution of the transient underexpanded jet features: the barrel length and Mach disc diameter are detailed and a strong dependency on the injector needle-lift is shown. These nearfield compressible features are recognised as flow structures which influence the mixing rate of a free jet and are also shown to control {{the size of the}} incompressible regions. The highly dynamic jet features are captured with high-fidelity schlieren high-speed video. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) maps taken at multiple after start of injection (aSOI) instances detail the flow characteristics within the jet core and the ambient regions. Using the jet core centerline velocity, the Mach disc location (barrel length) is measured to within 7 % of schlieren measurements. PIV measurements acquired at <b>late</b> <b>injection</b> (<b>timing)</b> conditions reveal detail on the influence of fuel delivery on the flow within the ignition zone. The mean flow velocity and kinetic energy are consequences of the jet&# 039;s proximity to the ignition region with influences largely originating from the encroaching shear-layer and/or the rolling vortex...|$|E
40|$|Premixed charge {{compression}} ignition {{mode of operation}} simultaneously reduces oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and particulate matter with improved fuel economy. Late injection is one such strategy to achieve premixed charge {{compression ignition}} mode along with the control over the ignition timing. Late injection along with charge dilution retards combustion and prepares homogeneous mixture by providing sufficient ignition delay. The in-cylinder charge distribution dictates mixture formation which affects the performance and emissions characteristics. Experimental results fail to provide an insight of the in-cylinder processes involved. Hence, numerical simulations have been performed to get in-cylinder distributions of scalars, which help in understanding the combustion process. The work consists of late in-cylinder injection of Diesel wherein the heat release rate trace shows only a premixed mode with lower soot and NOx. The absence of diffusion combustion confirms that the engine operates in a premixed charge compression ignition mode. In this work, effects of various injection parameters and swirl ratio on engine in-cylinder processes, performance and exhaust emissions have been studied using a three-dimensional model with detailed chemistry by using Converge, a computational fluid dynamics tool. Increasing swirl ratio improved air-fuel mixing causing lower soot emission {{up to a certain}} limit beyond which further increase in swirl ratio led to higher soot emission due to increased heat loss. Delayed start of injection resulted in delayed combustion leading to lower soot and NOx emission but partial oxidation resulted in higher carbon monoxide (CO) emissions. Nozzle tilt angle beyond 70 degrees {{led to the formation of}} fuel-rich mixture at the center of combustion chamber resulting in higher soot and CO emissions. A narrow spray cone angle improved air-fuel mixing leading to lower soot but produced higher NOx. Medium swirl with <b>late</b> <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> and wide nozzle tilt angle along with narrower spray cone angle resulted in lower emissions without deteriorating engine performance...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{injection}} strategies including the <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> and pressure play the most important role in determining engine performance, especially in pollutant emissions. However, the <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> and pressure quantitatively affect the performance of diesel engine with a turbo charger are not well understood. In this paper, the fire computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code with an improved spray model has been used to simulate the spray and combustion processes of diesel with early and <b>late</b> <b>injection</b> <b>timings</b> and six different injection pressure (from 275  bar to 1000  bar). It has been concluded that the use of early injection provides lower soot and higher NOx emissions than the <b>late</b> <b>injection.</b> In this study, it has been tried using the change of fuel injection time at these two next steps: before top dead center (BTDC) and after top dead center (ATDC) in order to achieving optimum emission and power in a specific point...|$|R
40|$|Simultaneous {{formaldehyde}} and OH PLIF {{have been}} applied in a direct-injected HCCI engine. The engine is a 0. 5 l single-cylinder optical engine equipped with EGR system. PLIF measurements were performed with the engine run with two different fuels of low and high volatility, respectively. Different ratios of EGR were also examined. The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate how fuels with different volatility and EGR affect the HCCI combustion and measurements were performed for early and <b>late</b> <b>injection</b> <b>timings.</b> Measurements are presented for different <b>injection</b> <b>timings</b> showing formaldehyde and OH from start of <b>injection</b> until <b>late</b> in the expansion stroke. Also, formaldehyde distributions obtained from after the low temperature regime and before the high temperature regime are studied for different tuning of the start of injection from 300 CAD to 20 CAD before top dead center.

40|$|Traffic related NOx and {{particle}} emission remain a significant concern {{particularly in the}} urban environment. Electrification offers a medium to long term solution, but there remains a need to significantly reduce internal combustion engine emissions in the short and medium term, and potentially {{in the long term}} for long range inter city transportation. <b>Late</b> <b>injection</b> low temperature combustion (LTC) has the potential to achieve ultra-low emissions levels in a compression ignition engine by increasing the lean pre-mixed burn fraction. However, significant quantities of diluent are normally required to achieve the required delay in ignition and pre-mixing to achieve LTC. This results in high boost requirements, increased pumping work and the complexity of the air handling system and potentially adversely impacting fuel economy. In this paper, results from a single cylinder light duty research engine are presented using a novel ramped combustion chamber focused at mid to high engine loads. The ramped combustion chamber improves mixing and enables more retarded <b>injection</b> <b>timings</b> than those possible on conventional bowl designs. This combustion strategy has enabled LTC conditions to be achieved at lower dilution rates, typically 20 - 30 % at loads up to 15 bar IMEP. CFD analysis of the air-fuel interaction indicates the ramped bowl effectively deflects fuel away from the squish region enabling very <b>late</b> <b>injection</b> <b>timings.</b> One dimensional analysis of the engine system was used to investigate the potential of late exhaust valve opening in improving work recovery, resulting in improved fuel consumption over the baseline LTC valve timing...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} reduce {{nitrogen}} oxides (NOx) and soot emissions while maintaining high thermal efficiency, more advanced combustion concepts have been developed over the years, such as Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) and Partially Premixed Combustion (PPC), as possible combustion processes in commercial engines. Compared to HCCI, PPC has advantages of lower unburned hydrocarbon (UHC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions; however, due to increased fuel stratifications, soot emissions {{can be a challenge}} when adding Exhaust-Gas Recirculation (EGR) gas. The current work presents particle size distribution measurements performed from HCCI-like combustion with very early (120 CAD BTDC) to PPC combustion with <b>late</b> <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> (11 CAD BTDC) at two intake oxygen rates, 21 % and 15 % respectively. Particle size distributions were measured using a differential mobility spectrometer DMS 500. Additionally, to get knowledge of the effect of injection timing on particle size distributions in PPC mode, measurements were performed in injection timing sweeps at engine speeds 800 rpm and 1600 rpm. Results show that, without EGR, throughout the injection timing from very early to late injection, a unimodal particle size distribution dominated by nucleation mode particles can be observed. Adding EGR, similar unimodal particle size distributions are obtained for early injection timings whereas bimodal size distributions appear for late injection timings when injecting goes into the bowl. The corresponding accumulation mode particle number rapidly increases and results in a high engine-out soot output. In PPC mode with high fuel stratification, a similar trend is found at engine speeds 800 rpm and 1600 rpm during injection timing sweeps. Retarding injection is generally found to reduce particle numbers in nucleation mode and increase numbers in accumulation mode, which leads to a higher soot mass output despite of a reduction in total particle numbers. It can be concluded that charge stratification and fuel impingement influence particle size distributions during injection timing variations...|$|E
40|$|A {{significant}} reduction of soot emissions from diesel engines cannot be achieved without an improved {{understanding of the}} soot processes inside the engine cylinder. While previous studies have primarily focused on exhaust soot particles, how these soot particles are formed {{in the first place}} is virtually unknown. To bridge this gap, this thesis presents a new experimental approach for collecting soot particles inside the cylinder of a single-cylinder light-duty diesel engine using a thermophoretic sampling technique. Soot samples are analysed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and subsequent image post-processing to obtain key parameters such as size distributions and fractal dimensions of soot particles. Results of this thesis demonstrate the successful collection of in-flame soot particles {{for the first time in}} a working diesel engine. The uncertainty analysis showed that the cyclic dispersions of engine combustion do not inflict significant impacts on particle size distribution. Parametrical studies with various injection timing and pressure revealed that the <b>late</b> <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> or high injection pressure reduces the number counts, projection area, aggregate size and fractal dimension of in-flame soot particles. Increasing injection pressure also resulted in reduced primary particle size. Soot samplings were also conducted for various combustion stages by changing the sampling location with respect to the diesel flame. Reduced soot projection area and aggregate size are found for post-wall-impingement soot particles suggesting the effect of flame-wall interaction. Furthermore, late-cycle and exhaust soot particles show reduced number counts, projection area, and primary particle size. These trends suggest that small particles are easily oxidized during the combustion while large aggregates with compact structures would more likely survive the oxidation. Moreover, the wall-deposited and in-flame soot particles were compared. The results show much smaller number counts, projection area and more compacted structures for the wall-deposited soot particles. The findings of this study are expected to build a new science base needed by industry to develop improved combustion strategies that achieve further reduction in soot emissions. The data provided by this work would also help build new soot models applicable to practical diesel engine conditions...|$|E
40|$|This work {{evaluates the}} effect of charge {{stratification}} on combustion phasing, {{rate of heat release}} and emissions for HCCI combustion. Engine experiments in both optical and traditional single cylinder engines were carried out with PRF 50 as fuel. The amount of stratification as well as injection timing of the stratified charge was varied. It was found that a stratified charge can influence combustion phasing, increasing the stratification amount or <b>late</b> <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> of the stratified charge leads to an advanced CA 50 timing. The NOX emissions follows the CA 50 advancement, advanced CA 50 timing leads to higher NOX emissions. Correlation between CA 50 can also be seen for HC and CO emissions when the injection timing was varied, late injection and thereby advanced CA 50 timing leads to both lower HC and CO emissions. This trend can not be seen when the stratification amount was varied, increased stratification amount leads to higher CO emission and for operating condition with late CA 50 timing the HC emissions also increase with increasing stratification amount. Optical studies, with high speed CCD camera, show that an increase in stratification leads to poor combustion quality near the cylinder walls, due to leaner mixtures near the cylinder walls and this results in higher HC and CO emissions. The maximum rate of heat release depends on stratification amount - a larger amount gives a lower rate of heat release but the main heat release is advanced. Varied injection timing results in different phasing of the main heat releases. The use of charge stratification for HCCI combustion can lead to a larger operating range, due to its effect on combustion phasing and rate of heat release, since the upper load range is partly restricted by too high rates of heat release leading to high pressure oscillations and the lower load to late combustion phasing leading to high cycle-to-cycle variations...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{designing}} robust and noise-insensitive PI controllers for pressure-sensor based combustion-timing control was studied through simulation. Different primary reference fuels (PRF) and operating conditions were studied. The simulations were done using a physics-based, control-oriented model with an empirical ignition-delay correlation. It {{was found that}} the controllable region, in-between the zero-gain region for early <b>injection</b> <b>timings</b> and the misfire region for <b>late</b> <b>injection</b> <b>timings</b> is strongly PRF dependent. As a result, it was necessary to adjust intake temperature to compensate for the difference in fuel reactivity prior to the controller design. With adjusted intake temperature, PRF dependent negative-temperature coefficient behavior gave different system characteristics for the different fuels. The PI-controller design was accomplished by solving the optimization problem of maximizing disturbance rejection and tracking performance subject to constraints on robustness and measurement-noise sensitivity. Optimal controller gains were found to be limited by the high system gain at late combustion timings and high-load conditions, furthermore, the measurement-noise sensitivity was found to be higher at the low-load operating points where the ignition delay is more sensitive to variations in load and intake-conditions. The controller-gain restrictions were found to vary for the different PRFs, the optimal gains for higher PRFs were lower due to a higher system gain, whereas the measurement-noise sensitivity was found to be higher for lower PRFs...|$|R
40|$|Syngas {{produced}} from gasification of solid fuels can serve best as transition fuel from the carbon-based to the hydrogen-based fuels {{in the internal}} combustion engines. The lone drawback is its low calorific value being between one tenth and one fifth of that of CNG (Compressed Natural Gas). This results in higher BSFC (brake specific fuel consumption) and limitation on the <b>injection</b> duration at <b>late</b> <b>injection</b> <b>timings</b> in the DI (direct-injection) SI (spark-ignition) engine. Recently, there have been efforts to enrich the syngas with methane so that the calorific value can be improved.

The result shows that the MES (methane-enriched syngas) (has extended the operation excess air ratio (λ) compared to syngas and CNG at the same engine speed. Methane-enrichment has maintained the faster and smoother combustion, the lower brake emissions of carbon monoxide and total hydrocarbon, and higher brake emissions of nitrogen oxides observed with syngas. Besides, MES improved the maximum brake thermal efficiency and the BSFC of the syngas by 30. 2 % and 21. 3 %, respectively. Therefore, MES can be better replacement to CNG in the DISI engine at all load conditions...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{promising}} solutions to rising emission standards is the in-cylinder emission reduction, through low temperature combustion. Low temperature combustion defeats conventional soot-NOx trade off by simultaneous reduction of both emissions by controlling the in-cylinder temperature below the Soot and NOx forming temperature zones. The use of low temperature combustion strategy phases the combustion into the expansion stroke, making the entire combustion process highly sensitive to start of high temperature combustion. Early start of high temperature combustion {{results in the}} advancement of combustion, resulting in higher in-cylinder temperature and pressure promoting the formation of oxides of nitrogen. Delayed start of combustion results in the retardation of the high temperature combustion further into the expansion stroke the first stage combustion, in this case cool flame combustion, has {{an important role to}} play in the phasing of high temperature combustion, associated emissions and efficiency. The focus {{of this study is to}} investigate the difference in the cool flame combustion characteristics between petroleum diesel and soybean biodiesel, when operating in low temperature combustion mode. Previous studies have attributed the absence of the cool flame in biodiesel purely due to oxygen content of the biodiesel. Cycle-to-cycle variation, exhaust gas constituents, rail pressure and fuel penetration length were analyzed to determine the causes for difference in the cool flame characteristic between the two fuels. The result of the analysis was that cool flame combustion is present in all combustion processes and not a product of systematic error or due to the combustion of the partially combusted species in the recirculated exhaust gas. It does not entirely depend on the chemical composition of fuel and rather on the in-cylinder conditions in particular the ambient oxygen concentration. Lower ambient oxygen concentration causes the cool flame to advance with respect to the high temperature heat release, making it visible in the heat release profile. The appearance of the cool flame at increased rail pressure in biodiesel does not cause a change in the trend of ignition delay, unburned hydrocarbon or carbon monoxide with respect to rail pressure. It only results in the retardation of high temperature combustion, further into the expansion stroke. Low temperature combustion defeats conventional soot-NOx trade off by simultaneous reduction of both emissions by controlling the in-cylinder temperature below the Soot and NOx forming temperature zones. In this study, low temperature combustion is achieved with the use of high exhaust gas recirculation circulation and <b>late</b> <b>injection</b> <b>timing,</b> phasing the combustion in the expansion stroke.

40|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines {{have dealt with}} increasingly restricted emissions requirements. After-treatment devices are successful in bringing emissions into compliance, but in-cylinder combustion control can reduce their burden by reducing engine out emissions. For example, oxides of nitrogen (NOx) are diesel combustion exhaust species that are notoriously difficult to remove by after-treatment. In-cylinder conditions can be controlled for low levels of NOx, but this produces high levels of soot potentially leading to increased particulate matter (PM). The simultaneous reduction of NOx and PM can be realized through a combustion process known as low temperature combustion (LTC). In this study, the typical definition of LTC as {{the defeat of the}} inverse relationship between soot and NOx is not applicable as a return to the soot-NOx tradeoff is observed with increasing exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). It is postulated that this effect is the result of an increase in the hot ignition equivalence ratio, moving the combustion event into a slightly higher soot formation region. This is important because a simple emissions based definition of LTC is no longer helpful. In this study, the manifestation of LTC in the calculated heat release profile is investigated. The conditions classified as LTC undergo a two-stage ignition process. Two-stage ignition is characterized by an initial cool-flame reaction followed by typical hot ignition. In traditional combustion conditions, the ignition is fast enough that a cool-flame is not observed. By controlling initial conditions (pressure, temperature, and composition), the creation and duration of the cool-flame event is predictable. Further, the effect that injection timing and the exhaust gas recirculation level have on the controlling factors of the cool-flame reaction is well correlated to the duration of the cool-flame event. These two results allow the postulation that the presence of a sufficiently long cool-flame reaction indicates a combustion event that can be classified as low temperature combustion. A potential method for identifying low temperature combustion events using only the rate of heat release profile is theorized. This study employed high levels of EGR and <b>late</b> <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> to realize the LTC mode of ordinary petroleum diesel fuel. Under these conditions, and based on a 90 percent reduction in nitric oxide and no increase in smoke output relative to the chosen baseline condition, a two part criteria is developed that identifies the LTC classified conditions. The criteria are as follow: the combustion event of conventional petroleum diesel fuel must show a two-stage ignition process; the first stage (cool-flame reaction) must consume at least 2 percent of the normalized fuel energy before the hot ignition commences...|$|E
40|$|In {{the work}} {{presented}} in the thesis laser diagnostics was employed primarily {{in the investigation of}} engines, but was also used to study soot in flames. Quantitative measurements were performed for visualizing both in-cylinder soot formation and DME sprays in a combustion vessel. The DME sprays inside a diesel truck engine were also qualitatively investigated. The combustion process in the HCCI engine was studied as well. Two species, formaldehyde and OH, were detected there simultaneously. Laser-induced incandescence (LII) was used in the work with soot diagnostics to measure soot concentrations, the potential for soot particle sizing also being investigated. Early in the work, various fundamental studies were performed in well-characterized flames in which results using the LII technique were compared with measurements performed by means of the scattering-extinction technique. As an extension of this work, LII was combined with an extinction measurement to provide on-line calibration of quantitative measurements of soot volume fractions. LII was also employed to investigate soot production in the cylinder of a gasoline direct-injection engine. Quantitative soot volume fraction distributions were obtained from the engine after calibrating the LII technique against a small, premixed well-defined flame. In {{the second part of the}} thesis, the use of dimethyl ether (DME) sprays as fuel for diesel engines was investigated. Laser-Rayleigh imaging was applied to obtain quantitative images of the local equivalence ratios for the DME sprays. Before any of the engine measurements were performed, the mixing conditions of both burning and non-burning DME sprays were investigated in a chemically pre-heated combustion vessel. These measurements were followed up by in-cylinder investigation of the use of DME spray in a diesel truck engine. The development of the spray was studied from the start of injection until all the fuel was consumed. In the final part of the work, ignition and combustion processes in the HCCI engine were investigated by means of laser-induced fluorescence (LIF). Two species, formaldehyde and OH, were imaged simultaneously. The formaldehyde formed as an intermediate during an early stage of the combustion process served as an indicator of low-temperature reactions. The OH radical, in turn, an important intermediate formed in high-temperature regions during combustion, was used as an indicator of regions in which HCCI combustion was underway. How the combustion process is affected by changes in the homogeneity of the fuel-air mixture that arises from early versus <b>late</b> <b>injection</b> <b>timing,</b> was investigated.

The analysis was based on images of spray development, spark discharge and combustion to understand the effects of early and <b>late</b> <b>injection</b> strategies on in-cylinder phenomena. Specifically, `single'-injection strategies from early to late intake stroke as well as multiple `split' injection events with triple pulses in the early intake stroke or double pulses in the intake stroke and late compression stroke were investigated. The engine was run at 1500 r/min at part- and full-load conditions (0. 5 and 1. 0 bar inlet plenum pressure, respectively). Engine coolant temperatures of 20 °C– 90 °C were employed to understand how fuel volatility {{was related to the}} phenomena observed. The sprays were imaged over a series of cycles primarily by laser sheet illumination on one vertical and two horizontal planes to identify three-dimensional aspects of the spray's development and its interactions with the incoming flow, valves, piston and liner.

40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} the combustion stratification from conventional compression ignition (CI) combustion to partially premixed combustion (PPC). Experiments are performed in an optical CI engine {{at a speed}} of 1200 rpm for diesel and naphtha (RON = 46). The motored pressure at TDC is maintained at 35 bar and fuelMEP is kept constant at 5. 1 bar {{to account for the}} difference in fuel properties between naphtha and diesel. Single injection strategy is employed and the fuel is injected at a pressure of 800 bar. Photron FASTCAM SA 4 that captures in-cylinder combustion at the rate of 10000 frames per second is employed. The captured high speed video is processed to study the combustion homogeneity based on an algorithm reported in previous studies. Starting from <b>late</b> fuel <b>injection</b> <b>timings,</b> combustion stratification is investigated by advancing the fuel <b>injection</b> <b>timings.</b> For <b>late</b> start of <b>injection</b> (SOI), a direct link between SOI and combustion phasing is noticed. At early SOI, combustion phasing depends on both intake air temperature and SOI. In order to match the combustion phasing (CA 50) of diesel, the intake air temperature is increased to 90 °C for naphtha. The combustion stratification from CI to PPC is also investigated for various level of dilution by displacing oxygen with nitrogen in the intake. The start of combustion (SOC) was delayed with the increase in dilution and to compensate for this, the intake air temperature is increased. The mixture homogeneity is enhanced for higher dilution due to longer ignition delay. The results show that high speed image is initially blue and then turned yellow, indicating soot formation and oxidation. The luminosity of combustion images decreases with early SOI and increased dilution. The images are processed to generate the level of stratification based on the image intensity. The level of stratification is same for diesel and naphtha at various SOI. When O concentration in the intake is decreased to 17. 7 % and 14. 7 %, stratification level is decreased. NO emission for both diesel and naphtha show a decreasing trend from CI to PPC. Comparing diesel and naphtha, the soot emission is lower for naphtha. NO and soot emissions at various SOI are correlated with high speed images of combustion to explain the combustion stratification...|$|R

40|$|Increasing world {{energy demand}} and recent climate change {{due to global}} warming have led us to search for {{sustainable}} energy sources with the lowest possible greenhouse-gas emissions. Our main energy, which sources from fossil fuel, is not sustainable and its combustion produces high content of harmful emissions. Hydrogen is always thought to be an ideal fuel because it is clean, renewable, and has abundant energy sources. Apparently, before hydrogen can be realized as the main energy source, a few major problems, such as the realtime production, safe and convenient storage, efficient combustion of hydrogen gas, and high production cost, need to be addressed. While waiting for the hydrogen technology to mature, the use {{of other types of}} gaseous fuel to combat the greenhouse-gas emissions deem necessary. Natural gas is not a renewable fuel but it has abundant resources and the lowest average specific CO 2 emission among the non-renewable fossil fuel energy resources. Gas engines are typically utilized for electric power generation but are becoming popular in transportation sector. Recent statistical data obtained from NGV Global shows the worldwide growth of NGVs is increasing exponentially. A CNG engine is usually operated in the lean mode where equivalence ratio is between 0. 7 and 1. 0 by employing premixed-type ignition technique. The CNG lean-burn approach has the advantage of high thermal efficiency, low NOX emission, and lower fuel consumption compared to stoichiometric combustion. However, CNG lean combustion has problems such as poor ignitability and poor flame propagation which cause high cyclic variation, misfires and high THC emission. Using the lean-burn approach, the ignitability of the first flame core relies on local fuel-air mixture concentration near the ignition position. Too rich or too lean local mixture will cause the first flame core to quench before it begins to propagate {{to other parts of the}} combustion chamber. It causes poor combustion quality, misfires and higher cycle-to-cycle variations. In this study, a gas-jet direct-ignition method was applied to improve lean CNG engines operation. The gas-jet ignition method employs <b>late</b> <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> technique which is very near to the ignition timing. The injected fuel reaches the ignition point with low jet velocity to ensure ignitability, while at the same time creating enough combustible mixture to support v flame core development. Through experiments, it was found that the gas-jet ignition method was able to operate in ultra lean mode at equivalence ratio less than 0. 3. To enable engine operation at equivalence ratio between 0. 3 and 0. 8, gas-jet ignition with two-stage injection method has to be implemented. The second gas injection followed by ignition similar to the gas-jet ignition, ensures ignitability. The first injection is delivered early similar to the premixed-type ignition method to create non-heterogeneous mixture to sustain flame development from the kernel initiated by the gas-jet ignition. In the application of gas-jet ignition with two-stage injection using a real engine, the ignitability, combustibility and THC formation were investigated by varying the first injection fuel delivery timing. Moreover, the effect of hydrogen addition to CNG fuel on the ignitability, combustibility and THC formation were also investigated. The fuel-air mixture distribution inside the combustion chamber prior to ignition timing was calculated using CFD software to provide hints on the combustion cyclic variability and THC formation found during the engine tests. Furthermore, flame of the gas-jet ignition with two-stage injection combustion was observed using a constant volume chamber. It was found that the gas-jet ignition and gas-jet ignition with two-stage injection methods are effective to extend lean combustible ranges of CNG engines. The first injection timing in the two-stage injection method is a key factor to the better engine performance because it affects flame development after ignition. The combustion cyclic variation and THC emission are sensitive to mixture distribution in clearance space of the combustion chamber around spark position just after ignition. Such mixture distribution is highly dependent on the first fuel delivery. At lean equivalence ratio, early injection produces well-dispersed bulk mixture leaner than CNG lean combustible limit, thus slows flame development. Late injection tends to produce rich mixture in the clearance space preventing initial flame development. Both cause relatively high THC emission. When hydrogen was added to CNG, it was found to effectively improve flame propagation, resulting in low THC emission free from cyclic variation. Hydrogen flame also supports CNG combustion with lean mixture...|$|E

40|$|For {{the purpose}} of researching {{hydrocarbon}} (HC) emissions in a direct-injection spark ignited (DISI) engine, five experiments were performed. These experiments clarified the role of coolant temperature, injection pressure, and <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> in HC emissions; the final two experiments illustrated the effect of coolant temperature and injection pressure on separate sweeps of <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> and the subsequent HC levels. The first three experiments were performed with isopentane. All five of the experiments were repeated with two fuels: UTG 91, a typical research gasoline, and a fuel with a high driveability index (DI), i. e. a less volatile fuel. The results showed less-than intuitive results for the response of HC to varying coolant temperature and varying injection pressure. For the coolant temperature data, the deviation from intuition is discussed and is probably due to vaporization problems. For the injection pressure results, the counterintuitive trend {{is expected to be}} the balance of two negative effects of high and low fuel pressure: high droplet velocities and large droplet diameters. Finally, the <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> results were more logical. The early injections are high for this engine due to late exhaust valve closing, and the <b>late</b> <b>injections</b> have high HC because of a decreasing time to vaporize and poor mixing caused by the lack of intake air motion. by Michael S.

For a diesel engine, <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> {{is one of the major}} parameters that affect the engine performance and emissions.

40|$|Abstract：For a {{sequential}} port {{fuel injection}} natural gas engine, its combustion and emission characteristics at low loads are crucial to meet light‐duty vehicle emission regulations. Fuel <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> is an important parameter related to the mixture formation in the cylinder. Its effect on the combustion and emission characteristics of a natural gas engine were investigated at 0. 2 MPa {{brake mean effective pressure}} (BMEP) / 2000 rpm and 0. 26 MPa BMEP/ 1500 rpm. The results show that early fuel <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> is beneficial to the reduction of the coefficient of variation (COV) of indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) under lean burn conditions and to extending the lean burn limits at the given loads. When relative air/fuel ratio is over 1. 3, fuel <b>injection</b> <b>timing</b> has a relatively large effect on engine‐out emissions.
