25|$|Plaintiffs' <b>lawyers</b> <b>say</b> {{that the}} Texas law {{prevents}} patients from getting compensation or damages {{even in cases}} where the patient clearly deserves it. In particular, the “willful and wanton” negligence standard for emergency care, which requires that the harm to the patient be intentional, makes it impossible to win a case where the harm is clearly negligent but not willful.|$|E
25|$|Abdullah Al-Kidd {{was held}} in a maximum {{security}} prison for 16 days, and in supervised release for 13 months. Al-Kidd was born Lavoni T. Kidd in 1973 in Wichita, Kansas. When he converted to Islam {{as a student at}} the University of Idaho, where he was a prominent football player, he changed his name. He asserts that Ashcroft violated his civil liberties as an American citizen, as he was treated like a terrorist and not allowed to consult an attorney. Al-Kidd's <b>lawyers</b> <b>say</b> Ashcroft, as US Attorney General, encouraged authorities after 9/11 to arrest potential suspects as material witnesses when they lacked probable cause to believe the suspects had committed a crime.|$|E
25|$|A {{panel of}} The Heart Rhythm Society, a {{specialist}} {{organization based in}} Washington, DC {{found that it was}} legal and ethical to honor requests by patients, or by those with legal authority to make decisions for patients, to deactivate implanted cardiac devices. <b>Lawyers</b> <b>say</b> that the legal situation is similar to removing a feeding tube, though there is currently no legal precedent involving pacemakers in the United States of America. A patient in the United States is thought to have a right to refuse or discontinue treatment, including a pacemaker that keeps him or her alive. Physicians have a right to refuse to turn it off, but are advised by the HRS panel that they should refer the patient to a physician who will. Some patients believe that hopeless, debilitating conditions, like those brought on by severe strokes or late-stage dementia, can cause so much suffering that they would prefer not to prolong their lives with supportive measures, such as cardiac devices.|$|E

2500|$|In 2007, {{law student}} Sarah Levy also {{addressed}} the potential {{legal status of}} the image in Cuba. It was her ultimate contention that [...] "in Cuba the copyright protection in Korda's Guevara photograph would have already expired, and despite the claims of ownership from Korda's heirs, the State would now hold any rights associated with the photograph." [...] In regards to the more commonly disseminated stylized version of the photograph, <b>lawyers</b> <b>say</b> {{it will be an}} uphill struggle to deter non-photographic use of such a widely reproduced image, other than in countries like Italy where laws protect image rights.|$|E
2500|$|Defense lawyers {{suggested}} police used intimidation tactics on witnesses. On May 11, Moezeldin Elmostafa, {{an immigrant}} taxi driver {{who signed a}} sworn statement about Seligmann's whereabouts that defense <b>lawyers</b> <b>say</b> provides a solid alibi, was arrested on a 2½-year-old shoplifting charge. Arresting officers first {{asked if he had}} anything new to say about the lacrosse case. When he refused to alter his testimony, he was taken into custody. An arrest and conviction would have destroyed his chance for citizenship and could have led to his deportation. Elmostafa was subsequently tried on the shoplifting charge and acquitted, after a grainy security tape proved that a security guard who was the prosecution's chief witness had [...] "misremembered" [...] events.|$|E
2500|$|The Secret Service {{says it does}} {{establish}} 'public viewing areas' {{to protect}} dignitaries but does not discriminate against individuals based {{on the content of}} their signs or speech. 'Absolutely not,' said Tom Mazur, a spokesman for the agency created to protect the president. 'The Secret Service makes no distinction on the purpose, message or intent of any individual or group.' Civil libertarians dispute that. They cite a Corpus Christi, Texas, couple, Jeff and Nicole Rank, as an example. The two were arrested at a Bush campaign event in Charleston, West Virginia, on July 4, 2004, when they refused to take off anti-Bush shirts. Their shirts read, 'Love America, Hate Bush'... The ACLU found 17 cases since March 2001 in which protesters were removed during events where the president or vice president appeared. And <b>lawyers</b> <b>say</b> it's an increasing trend.|$|E

2500|$|The Guardian {{reported}} in February 2015 that the Chicago Police Department [...] "operates an off-the-books interrogation compound, rendering Americans unable {{to be found}} by family or attorneys while locked inside what <b>lawyers</b> <b>say</b> is the domestic equivalent of a CIA black site." [...] The Guardian added that the facility, the Homan Square Police Warehouse at 1011 S. Homan Ave in Chicago (...) , [...] "has long been the scene of secretive work by special police units." [...] The Guardian said that interviews with local attorneys and one protester [...] "describe operations that deny access to basic constitutional rights ... The secretive warehouse ... trains its focus on Americans, most often poor, black and brown ... Witnesses, suspects or other Chicagoans who end up inside {{do not appear to}} have a public, searchable record entered into a database indicating where they are, as happens when someone is booked at a precinct. Lawyers and relatives insist {{there is no way of}} finding their whereabouts. Those lawyers who have attempted to gain access to Homan Square are most often turned away, even as their clients remain in custody inside." ...|$|E
