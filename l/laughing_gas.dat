5|$|Because Roger {{unfortunately}} {{appears at}} every {{scene of crime}} just as the murders take place, he is ruled as the prime suspect. Roger and Billy Budget then theorize that announcer Dexter Morris is the next to die. Dexter ignores their warning and is killed by electrocution. By going through private documents in WBN's file room, Roger finds that the victims all previously worked together at a radio station in Peoria, Illinois, which he then correlates into a secretive FCC scandal. King (<b>laughing</b> <b>gas)</b> and General Whalen (falls down an elevator shaft) are the next to die after Roger's warning, causing even more suspicion from the police.|$|E
5|$|Nitrous oxide (N2O), {{better known}} as <b>laughing</b> <b>gas,</b> is made by thermal {{decomposition}} of molten ammonium nitrate at 250°C. This is a redox reaction and thus nitric oxide and nitrogen are also produced as byproducts. It is mostly used as a propellant and aerating agent for sprayed canned whipped cream, and was formerly commonly used as an anaesthetic. Despite appearances, it cannot {{be considered to be}} the anhydride of hyponitrous acid (H2N2O2) because that acid is not produced by the dissolution of nitrous oxide in water. It is rather unreactive (not reacting with the halogens, the alkali metals, or ozone at room temperature, although reactivity increases upon heating) and has the unsymmetrical structure N–N–O (N≡N+O−↔−N=N+=O): above 600°C it dissociates by breaking the weaker N–O bond.|$|E
50|$|In Miami, on October 20, 1973, 38-year-old Charles Scales, a {{homeless}} person sleeping outdoors behind an abandoned building, was approached {{by a group of}} teenagers, doused with gasoline, and set on fire. Two other homeless people were also attacked in the same incident, but escaped. A homeless person that survived stated the teenagers “Were <b>laughing</b> and throwing <b>gas</b> and striking matches” at them. The film Fuzz was mentioned in the news reports about the killing, as the attack completely mimicked the movie’s plot. Both the perpetrators and victims were black, ruling out the motivation for the murder may have been racial in nature.|$|R
50|$|Ripper: An Australian {{friend of}} the group and a soul surfer, he tends to make people <b>laugh</b> with his <b>gas</b> (hence his nickname), {{although}} the group just thinks that it is disgusting. He is best friends with Lance and Broseph and is occasionally ridiculed because of his blue hair. He also has very dark blue eyes and speaks with a heavy Australian accent. His ultimate dream is to become the world's best surfer. He is shown to usually be laid-back but is also very serious when it comes to certain things. Ripper works in water sports with Lance and Reef. He is returning staff from last year and is 17. He also happens to be a prankster. In season 2, Ripper and Lance get up to mischief, resulting in Emma injuring her knee. Seeing this, Ripper blows on her grazed knee to soothe the pain, which Emma found quite nice of him to do. This leads to Emma and Ripper dating, but for a brief period. Ripper is voiced by Sergio Di Zio.|$|R
5|$|After {{an armored}} car leaves a bank with ten million dollars, it is {{attacked}} en route by Diabolik who manages {{to steal the}} money and escape with his partner Eva Kant. Leaving the money in their underground hideout, Diabolik and Eva attend a press conference held by the Minister of the Interior which they disrupt by releasing <b>laughing</b> <b>gas.</b> Due to {{the high level of}} crime, the death penalty is brought back. The police cannot find Diabolik, and gang leader Valmont suffers at their hands from a clampdown because of his actions. Realising things can only get worse because of Diabolik's crime spree, Valmont contacts Inspector Ginko and makes a deal to catch him for the police. At his hideout, Diabolik decides to steal the famous Aksand emerald necklace from the Saint Just Castle for Eva's birthday. Valmont builds up an identikit picture of Eva and circulates it as a means of capturing Diabolik. Diabolik scales the walls of Saint Just Castle where he finds the police lying in wait. He manages to steal the necklace by fooling the police officers with mirrors on the road and dummy decoys of himself.|$|E

25|$|Many drugs, {{beyond their}} {{pharmaceutical}} and recreational uses have industrial uses. Nitrous oxide, or <b>laughing</b> <b>gas</b> is a dental anaesthetic, {{also used to}} prepared whipped cream, fuel rocket engines, and enhance the performance of race cars.|$|E
25|$|In 1799 the British chemist Humphry Davy {{performed}} another early blind experiment. In {{studying the}} effects of nitrous oxide (<b>laughing</b> <b>gas)</b> on human physiology, Davy deliberately did not tell his subjects what concentration of the gas they were breathing, or whether they were breathing ordinary air.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in 1772, English {{scientist}} Joseph Priestley {{discovered the}} gas nitrous oxide. Initially, people thought this gas to be lethal, even in small doses, like some other nitrogen oxides. However, in 1799, British chemist and inventor Humphry Davy {{decided to find}} out by experimenting on himself. To his astonishment he found that nitrous oxide made him laugh, so he nicknamed it <b>laughing</b> <b>gas.</b> Davy wrote about the potential anesthetic properties of nitrous oxide, but nobody at that time pursued the matter any further.|$|E
25|$|Nitrous oxide, also {{sometimes}} known as <b>laughing</b> <b>gas,</b> is a legally available gas used for purposes that include anesthesia during certain dental and surgical procedures, {{as well as}} food preparation and the fueling of rocket and racing engines. Substance abusers {{also sometimes}} use the gas as an inhalant. Like all other inhalants, it's popular because it provides consciousness-altering effects while allowing users to avoid some of the legal issues surrounding illicit or illegal drugs of abuse. Abuse of nitrous oxide can produce significant short-term and long-term damage to human health, including a form of oxygen starvation called hypoxia, brain damage, and a serious vitamin B12 deficiency {{that can lead to}} nerve damage.|$|E
500|$|The <b>laughing</b> <b>gas</b> {{has been}} in desperately short supply at Holby of late. [...] What they really need is {{for someone to come}} along and prove that heart transplants can be fun. It's a job for comedy cardiac {{specialist}} Percy Durant (guest star Ade Edmondson), who we last saw working out in Ghana with consultant Ric. You could easily imagine Percy driving around in a van with a big, red, plastic heart on top of it, or cracking open someone's chest and pulling out a bunch of flowers. And when it comes to Lisa (Luisa Bradshaw-White), he magically comes up with the answer to all her problems.|$|E
500|$|When Colt {{returned}} to the United States in 1832, {{he went back to}} work for his father, who financed the production of two guns, a rifle and a pistol. The first completed pistol exploded when it was fired, but the rifle performed well. His father would not finance any further development, so Samuel needed {{to find a way to}} pay for the development of his ideas. He had learned about nitrous oxide (<b>laughing</b> <b>gas)</b> from the factory chemist in his father's textile plant, so he took a portable lab on the road and earned a living performing <b>laughing</b> <b>gas</b> demonstrations across the United States and Canada, billing himself as [...] "the Celebrated Dr. Coult of New-York, London and Calcutta". Colt conceived of himself as a man of science and thought if he could enlighten people about a new idea like nitrous oxide, he could in turn make people more receptive to his new idea concerning a revolver. He started his lectures on street corners and soon worked his way up to lecture halls and museums. As ticket sales declined, Colt realized that [...] "serious" [...] museum lectures were not what the people wanted to pay money to see and that it was dramatic stories of salvation and redemption the public craved. While visiting his brother, John, in Cincinnati, he partnered with sculptor, Hiram Powers, for his demonstrations with a theme based on The Divine Comedy. Powers made detailed wax sculptures and paintings based on demons, centaurs and mummies from Dante. Colt constructed fireworks to complete the show, which was a success. According to Colt historian Robert Lawrence Wilson, the [...] "lectures launched Colt's celebrated career as a pioneer Madison Avenue-style pitchman". His public speaking skills were so prized that he was thought to be a doctor and was pressed into service to cure an apparent cholera epidemic on board a riverboat by giving his patients a dose of nitrous oxide.|$|E
500|$|When {{the special}} was first broadcast, it was watched by 1.7 million viewers, 11% {{of the total}} audience. However, these ratings are poor {{compared}} to other programmes. For example, an episode of Desperate Housewives shown the previous night attracted 2.8 million viewers. Responses from critics were mixed. Matt Baylis said, [...] "Like a homegrown ER on <b>laughing</b> <b>gas,</b> this show will be sorely missed," [...] and Ian Johns said, [...] "It was like a Richard Curtis romcom, albeit one force-fed magic mushrooms." [...] Sam Wollaston in The Guardian wrote {{that it was one}} of the funniest shows on British television, alongside the satirical sitcom The Thick of It, saying, [...] "The Thick of It is clever-funny, Green Wing is mad-funny." [...] Wollaston said that while the dramatic element of the show, such as Mac's death, were good, it was Alan and Joanna's storyline that was most entertaining. [...] "Mark Heap and Pippa Haywood, who play them, have been the shining lights in an already glittering show. They, and it, will be sorely missed," [...] he said. David Butcher in the Radio Times said that, [...] "Green Wing's sublime comic acting and a vein of shrieking madness in the writing make it very hard to beat." ...|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stones Peter Travers {{said the}} film [...] "goes {{on too long}} and {{repetition}} dulls its initial cleverness" [...] but the [...] "junky feel is part of its charm." [...] He praised the cast, particularly Reynolds, as well as Tim Miller's action sequences. At the Boston Globe, Tom Russo gave the film three stars. He criticized the [...] "featherweight" [...] plot, but said that there is enough humor to support it, and that Reynolds was [...] "born to play" [...] Deadpool. Chris Nashawaty graded the film a 'B' for Entertainment Weekly, saying it [...] "doesn’t have the most adrenalized action sequences or the deepest origin story" [...] but makes up for that with R-rated fun. Nashawaty felt Reynolds was the perfect star for the film, and is [...] "a blast of <b>laughing</b> <b>gas</b> in a genre that tends to take itself way too seriously." [...] Tasha Robinson at The Verge felt {{there was too much}} juvenile humor, but was positive that the film did not make homophobic, racist, or sexist jokes, and that its overall tone remained joyous despite the material. She also praised the smaller scope of the film. David Edelstein of Vulture said the film's jokes save it from a lack of subtext and strong villains, and noted the gratifyingly twisty" [...] structure. Manohla Dargi at The New York Times did not give the film a pass for listing its genre cliches in the opening credits before using them, but instead highlighted the [...] "human" [...] elements in the film and the moments where Reynolds and Tim Miller did [...] "more than hit the same bombastic notes over and over again." [...] For IndieWire, Kate Erbland gave the film a 'B-', praising its style, and Reynolds' Deadpool for breaking the superhero mold, but criticizing the overall film for following genre conventions and focusing on [...] "numbing" [...] violence and un-original swearing and nudity.|$|E
2500|$|Nitrous oxide, {{commonly}} known as <b>laughing</b> <b>gas</b> or nitrous, is a chemical compound, an oxide of nitrogen with the formula [...] At room temperature, it is a colorless non-flammable gas, with a slightly metallic scent and taste. At elevated temperatures, nitrous oxide is a powerful oxidizer similar to molecular oxygen.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile Toby, {{putting a}} hand on each knee, bent down his nose to the basket, {{and took a long}} {{inspiration}} at the lid; the grin upon his withered face expanding in the process, as if he were inhaling <b>laughing</b> <b>gas.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suggest that}} we did not really find them at all; that we have all been dreaming. You know that there are certain gases which produce illusions, <b>laughing</b> <b>gas</b> is one of them, and that these gases are {{sometimes}} met with in caves. Now there were very peculiar odours in that place under the statue, which may have worked upon our imaginations in some such way. Otherwise we are up against a miracle, and, as you know, I do not believe in miracles." ...|$|E
60|$|At first these fumes were unpleasant, {{but just}} as I was about to drop the bowl they seemed to become {{agreeable}} and to penetrate to the inmost recesses of my being. The general affect of them was not unlike that of the <b>laughing</b> <b>gas</b> which dentists give, with this difference, that whereas the gas produces insensibility, these fumes seemed to set the mind on fire and to burn away all limitations of time and distance. Things shifted before me. It was as though I were no longer in that room but travelling with inconceivable rapidity.|$|E
6000|$|I {{suppose that}} I swooned {{for a minute}} or two. At any rate I {{remember}} a long and very curious dream, such a dream as is evolved by a patient under <b>laughing</b> <b>gas,</b> that is very clear and vivid at the time but immediately afterwards slips from the mind's grasp as water does from the clenched hand. It was something to the effect that all those hundreds of skeleton elephants rose and marshalled themselves before me, making obeisance to me by bending their bony knees, because, as I quite understood, I was the only human being that had ever escaped from Jana. Moreover, on the foremost elephant's skull Hans was perched like a mahout, giving words of command, to their serried ranks and explaining to them that it would be very convenient if they would carry their tusks, for which they had no further use, and pile them in a certain place--I forget where--that must be near a good road to facilitate their subsequent transport to a land where they would be made into billiard balls and the backs of ladies' hair-brushes. Next, through the figments of that retreating dream, I heard the undoubted voice of Hans himself, which of course I knew to be absurd as Hans was lost and doubtless dead, saying: ...|$|E
60|$|When a man {{has taken}} hashish or certain other drugs, he not {{infrequently}} has the experience that he is standing or floating beside his own body, which he can see stretched senseless upon the couch. So also under anaesthetics, particularly under <b>laughing</b> <b>gas,</b> many people are conscious of a detachment from their bodies, and of experiences at a distance. I have myself seen very clearly my wife and children inside a cab while I was senseless in the dentist's chair. Again, when a man is fainting or dying, and his system in an unstable condition, it is asserted in very many definite instances that he can, and does, manifest himself to others at a distance. These phantasms of the living, which have been so carefully explored and docketed by Messrs. Myers and Gurney, ran into hundreds of cases. Some people claim that by an effort of will they can, after going to sleep, propel their own doubles in the direction which they desire, and visit those whom they wish to see. Thus {{there is a great}} volume of evidence--how great no man can say who has not spent diligent years in exploring it--which vouches for the existence of this finer body containing the precious jewels of the mind and spirit, and leaving only gross confused animal functions in its heavier companion.|$|E
60|$|When a man leaves our dismal, smoky London atmosphere, and breathes, {{instead of}} coal-smoke and yellow fog, this bright, clear, French air, {{he is quite}} {{intoxicated}} by it at first, and feels a glow in his blood, and a joy in his spirits, which scarcely thrice a year, and then only {{at a distance from}} London, he can attain in England. Is the intoxication, I wonder, permanent among the natives? and may we not account for the ten thousand frantic freaks of these people by the peculiar influence of French air and sun? The philosophers are from night to morning drunk, the politicians are drunk, the literary men reel and stagger from one absurdity to another, and how shall we understand their vagaries? Let us suppose, charitably, that Madame Sand had inhaled a more than ordinary quantity of this <b>laughing</b> <b>gas</b> when she wrote for us this precious manuscript of Spiridion. That great destinies are in prospect for the human race we may fancy, without her ladyship's word for it: but more liberal than she, and having a little retrospective charity, as well as that easy prospective benevolence which Mrs. Sand adopts, let us try and think there is some hope for our fathers (who were nearer brutality than ourselves, according to the Sandean creed), or else there is a very poor chance for us, who, great philosophers as we are, are yet, alas! far removed from that angelic consummation which all must wish for so devoutly. She cannot say--is it not extraordinary?--how many centuries have been necessary before man could pass from the brutal state to his present condition, or how many ages will be required ere we may pass from the state of man to the state of angels? What the deuce is the use of chronology or philosophy? We were beasts, and we can't tell when our tails dropped off: we shall be angels; but when our wings are to begin to sprout, who knows? In the meantime, O man of genius, follow our counsel: lead an easy life, don't stick at trifles; never mind about DUTY, it is only made for slaves; if the world reproach you, reproach the world in return, you have a good loud tongue in your head: if your straight-laced morals injure your mental respiration, fling off the old-fashioned stays, and leave your free limbs to rise and fall as Nature pleases; and when you have grown pretty sick of your liberty, and yet unfit to return to restraint, curse the world, and scorn it, and be miserable, like my Lord Byron and other philosophers of his kidney; or else mount a step higher, and, with conceit still more monstrous, and mental vision still more wretchedly debauched and weak, begin suddenly to find yourself afflicted with a maudlin compassion for the human race, and a desire to set them right after your own fashion. There is the quarrelsome stage of drunkenness, when a man can as yet walk and speak, when he can call names, and fling plates and wine-glasses at his neighbor's head with a pretty good aim; after this comes the pathetic stage, when the patient becomes wondrous philanthropic, and weeps wildly, as he lies in the gutter, and fancies he is at home in bed--where he ought to be; but this is an allegory.|$|E
