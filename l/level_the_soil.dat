Other notable sub-regions include the Uco Valley and the Tupungato department. Located in the shadow of Mount Aconcagua, the average vineyards in Mendoza are planted at altitudes 1,970-3,610 feet (600-1,100 meters) above sea <b>level.</b> <b>The</b> <b>soil</b> of the region is sandy and alluvial on top of clay substructures and the climate is continental with four distinct seasons that affect the grapevine, including winter dormancy.|$|E
500|$|Sarnia {{is located}} on the eastern shore of Lake Huron at its extreme {{southern}} point where it flows into the St. Clair River. Most of the surrounding area is flat, and the elevation ranges from [...] and [...] above sea <b>level.</b> <b>The</b> <b>soil</b> mostly comprises clay. [...] Despite this high percentage of clay, the soil is remarkably rich for cultivation. Prior to the Ice Age, glaciers covered most of the area, as can be seen not only by the existence of the Great Lakes themselves but also of alluvial sand deposits, terminal moraines, and rich oil reserves. The entire area was submerged and plant and animal matter formed many layers of sediment as they settled after the waters receded. [...] Sarnia {{is not part of the}} Canadian Shield and is located just beyond its southernmost reaches, [...] west of Toronto and [...] north of Detroit.|$|E

The cliff itself, {{like the rest of}} Brighton's soil, is chalk. Below this are thin layers of Upper and Lower Greensand separated by a thicker band of Gault clay. The land slopes upwards gradually from south to north towards the top of the Downs.|$|E

2500|$|The {{main purpose}} of the test is to provide an {{indication}} of the relative density of granular deposits, such as sands and gravels from which {{it is virtually impossible to}} obtain undisturbed samples. [...] The great merit of the test, and the main reason for its widespread use is that it is simple and inexpensive. The soil strength parameters which can be inferred are approximate, but may give a useful guide in ground conditions where it may not be possible to obtain borehole samples of adequate quality like gravels, sands, silts, clay containing sand or gravel and weak rock. In conditions where the quality of the undisturbed sample is suspect, e.g., very silty or very sandy clays, or hard clays, it is often advantageous to alternate the sampling with standard penetration tests to check the strength. If the samples are found to be unacceptably disturbed, it may be necessary to use a different method for measuring strength like the plate test. [...] When the test is carried out in granular soils below groundwater <b>level,</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> may become loosened. In certain circumstances, it can be useful to continue driving the sampler beyond the distance specified, adding further drilling rods as necessary. Although this is not a standard penetration test, and should not be regarded as such, it may at least give an indication as to whether the deposit is really as loose as the standard test may indicate.|$|E

50|$|Ebullition {{refers to}} the sudden release of bubbles of methane into the air. These bubbles occur {{as a result of}} methane {{building}} up over time in <b>the</b> <b>soil,</b> forming pockets of methane gas. As these pockets of trapped methane grow in size, <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> will slowly rise up as well. This phenomenon continues until so much pressure builds up that the bubble “pops,” transporting the methane up through <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> so quickly that it does not have time to be consumed by the methanotrophic organisms in <b>the</b> <b>soil.</b> With this release of gas, <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of <b>soil</b> then falls once more.|$|R
40|$|Fertilizer {{nutrient}} {{requirements for}} corn {{are based on}} expected yield and nutrient <b>levels</b> in <b>the</b> <b>soil.</b> Crop production in Nebraska typically requires applying nitrogen to supplement that available in <b>the</b> <b>soil.</b> Phosphorus is <b>the</b> second most likely nutrient to be deficient in <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> for good corn yields...|$|R

30|$|This is {{confirmed}} by a German long-term soil study (over a period of 42  years) of PCDD/F and PCB levels in test fields that were continuously treated with sewage sludge or mineral fertilizer [111].
