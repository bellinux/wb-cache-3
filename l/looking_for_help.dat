Santoso later described this incident as inspiring her to work for women's rights.|$|E
5|$|<b>Looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>help,</b> Doggett {{approaches}} FBI Assistant Director Brad Follmer (Cary Elwes) {{for help}} on the case. Doggett's ex-wife, Barbara Doggett, meets up for a lineup at a police station. Barbara does not recognize Regali or anyone else on the lineup. Scully finds some similarities between Luke and the two dead bodies, but no forensic proof. Doggett comes to realize that Regali has had help from someone within the FBI all along. Follmer informs Reyes and Doggett that Cadet Hayes is really Stuart Mimms, a former mental patient. He also informs them that Mimms lived in New York City during the year of Luke's murder, hinting that Mimms is the murderer and not Regali. Doggett and Reyes assemble a SWAT team to raid Mimms apartment. Mimms is taken into police custody and at a new lineup, Barbara recognizes Mimms.|$|E
25|$|With his assault {{schedule}} {{thrown out}} of whack by the PAVN, and his troops consequently in trouble, Vang Pao went <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>help.</b> On 1 September, he made an emergency flight to Vientiane for a tense meeting with Ambassador G. McMurtrie Godley at the airfield. Hoping to cadge more air support, the general blamed a shortage of tactical air for the offensive's lack of success. From Godley's standpoint, the Hmong unit commanders left much to be desired for combat leadership of a force crippled by trench foot. The ambassador {{made it clear that}} U.S. tactical air support was limited to 18 daily sorties. He then asked if Vang Pao would continue the offensive on those terms. At this, Vang Pao returned to battle, knowing that saving Long Tieng was essential for the Royalists.|$|E

[...] They met at a private dinner held at the home of their mutual friend the artist Brett-Livingstone Strong. Knowing that Presley had been <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>help</b> within the music industry, Strong had her play tapes for Jackson, who was impressed with Presley's voice. The pair talked {{for the remainder of the}} night, until it was time for Jackson to leave.

500|$|Later in the investigation, an {{additional}} $4,000 fine was imposed on Monteiro. The coach had {{a salary of}} only about $1,500 per month during the eight months he spent with the Rainmen. He was unable to contact team owner Andre Levingston, who did not assist or help him. Monteiro responded to the charges by claiming that they were unfair. In a statement on May 11, he said, [...] "I am <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>help</b> to fight these unjust sanctions and fines so I can continue to work {{and be able to}} support my family. The investigation was not full. The truth of what happened is being ignored. I have not been contacted by any league representative." ...|$|E
500|$|Two years later, Morley {{was awarded}} the same {{printing}} monopoly that Byrd had held. Morley's pick of Barley as an assignee (rather than experienced printers such as East or Peter Short, both of whom had previously worked with Morley) is surprising. Morley may have been <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>help</b> in challenging the metrical psalter patent of Richard Day and his assignees. At that time, East and Short were stationers, and the Stationers' Company was actively enforcing the Day monopoly. Barley, however, was not a stationer, and in 1599 he and Morley published The Whole Booke of Psalmes and Richard Allison's Psalmes of David in Metre. The former was a small pocket edition that was largely based on East's 1592 publication of the same name. This work, although pirated and filled with small errors, provides some evidence of Barley's editorial skill; musicologist Robert Illing notes that if Barley [...] "is to be discredited for roguery, he must also be applauded for his strokes of musical imagination" [...] for successfully compressing such a large work into a pocket-sized production. In Allison's work, the two claimed that they had exclusive rights on the metrical psalter. Duly provoked, Day sued. The outcome of his lawsuit is not known, but neither Barley nor Morley ever published another metrical psalter.|$|E

500|$|Twenty-two years later, Sam (Jared Padalecki) and {{his girlfriend}} Jessica Moore (Adrianne Palicki) {{celebrate}} his high LSAT score. Later that night, Dean (Jensen Ackles) shows up at Sam's home. Though the brothers have not spoken in years, Dean comes <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>help</b> in finding their father, who disappeared while hunting a supernatural entity. After Sam hears a voicemail from his father that contains electronic voice phenomenon of a woman saying, [...] "I can never go home," [...] he agrees to help Dean in the search. The brothers head to John's last known whereabouts—the town of Jericho—where he had been investigating the disappearances of young men along a single stretch of road over ten years. Sam and Dean discover a local legend of a murdered girl who has returned as a homicidal, hitchhiking ghost. Research points to Constance Welch (Shahi), who jumped to her death off a nearby bridge after drowning her children. While they stakeout the bridge that night, Sam tells Dean {{he does not want}} to return to hunting supernatural creatures. He points out that finding whatever creature killed their mother—a task their father has dedicated his life to—will not bring her back. The two are interrupted by a ghostly woman jumping off the bridge. Sam and Dean later check into a local motel, and discover their father is also renting a room there. They break into it and discover his research scattered all over the room; all his findings point to Constance being a woman in white.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of the {{original}} mod, Wreden was contacted by William Pugh, a player who had experience in creating environments within the Source engine and had previously won a Saxxy Award for his work. Pugh had heard of the mod through word of mouth, and after being impressed with playing it, saw that Wreden was <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>help</b> for improving the mod. The two collaborated each day for two years for the revamped mod. Though initially Wreden wanted to recreate the original game [...] "beat for beat", his discussions with Pugh led to them deciding to alter existing material and add more, an [...] "interpolation" [...] of the original game, and creating a stand-alone title. The game includes the six endings from the original, and the high-definition remake updates the game with several newly created endings. Brighting remains the voice of the narrator in the remaster, as Wreden considers his voice [...] "half the reason this game has been successful".|$|E
