50|$|The {{complicated}} cylinder castings, {{which involved}} tortuous narrow steam passages to provide inside admission for the inside cylinders and outside admission for the outside cylinders, resulted in poor steam flow; this, together with leakages around the piston valves, {{led to a}} high coal consumption which became particularly apparent once the locomotives were being used on trains out of King's Cross. Nigel Gresley, the Chief Mechanical Engineer of the LNER, decided to fit poppet valves, but instead of operating these by Lentz valve gear, {{as he had done}} with some of his other poppet valve fitments (such as Class B12), Gresley chose to use Caprotti valve gear. This was driven from the driving axle by a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>shaft</b> along the centre of the locomotive to a transverse shaft above the cylinders. No. 6168 Lord Stuart of Wortley was modified in September 1929, followed by no. 6166 in December. In December 1929, class B3 was subdivided into two parts, and the locomotives modified with Caprotti valve gear were given the classification B3/2, and the unmodified locomotives became B3/1. On test, they showed a 16% reduction in coal consumption, and as a result, a further two more were modified to B3/2 - no. 6167 in June 1938, and no. 6164 Earl Beatty in June 1939. These used steam to close the valves, instead of the springs fitted to nos. 6166/8. It was intended to convert the remaining two Class B3/1 locomotives, but the outbreak of war meant that they were never modified, and retained Stephenson valve gear until withdrawal.|$|E
50|$|The Heisler {{locomotive}} was {{the last}} variant {{of the three major}} types of geared steam locomotive Charles L. Heisler receiving a patent for the design in 1892, following the construction of a prototype in 1891. Somewhat similar to a Climax locomotive, Heisler's design featured two cylinders canted inwards at a 45-degree angle to form a 'V-twin' arrangement. Power then went to a <b>longitudinal</b> drive <b>shaft</b> {{in the center of the}} frame that drove the outboard axle on each powered truck through bevel gears in an enclosed gearcase riding on the axle between the truck frames. The inboard axle on each truck was then driven from the outboard one by external side (connecting) rods.|$|R
50|$|This {{principle}} of divided drive already being {{established for the}} front of the Trado, it was a minor step for van Doorne to divide the drive to the rear wheels as well. The DAF YA-328 used walking beams where the axle {{was no more than a}} pivot and the drive was supplied entirely by external <b>longitudinal</b> drive <b>shafts,</b> one on each side. As was usual for heavy vehicles of this period, the final drives and right-angle drive to the stub axles were combined through a worm gear box. This also had he advantage that it is easy to connect such boxes in series, using the rear end of the worm shaft as an output.|$|R
50|$|Using rotor {{technology}} licensed {{from the}} Cierva Autogiro Company, a single radial engine drove twin rotors, set on tubular steel outriggers {{to the left}} and right of the fuselage. Each main rotor consisted of three articulated and tapered blades, driven by the engine through gears and <b>shafts.</b> <b>Longitudinal</b> and directional control was achieved using cyclic pitch and asymmetric rotor lift.The counter-rotation of the two rotors solved the problem of torque-reaction as also shown by Louis Bréguet. The small horizontal-axis propeller directly driven by the engine was purely to provide the necessary airflow to cool the engine during low speed or hovering flight and provided negligible forward thrust.|$|R
2500|$|When {{used in this}} way, a {{differential}} couples the <b>longitudinal</b> input <b>shaft</b> (or prop shaft) to the pinion, {{which in}} turn drives the transverse ring gear of the differential. This also works as reduction gearing. On rear wheel drive vehicles the differential may connect to half-shafts inside an axle housing, or drive shafts that connect to the rear driving wheels. Front wheel drive vehicles tend to have the engine crankshaft and the gearbox shafts transverse, and with the pinion {{on the end of}} the main-shaft of the gearbox and the differential enclosed in the same housing as the gearbox. There are individual drive-shafts to each wheel. A differential consists of one input, the drive shaft, and two outputs which are the two drive wheels, however the rotation of the drive wheels are coupled to each other by their connection to the roadway. [...] Under normal conditions, with small tire slip, the ratio of the speeds of the two driving wheels is defined by the ratio of the radii of the paths around which the two wheels are rolling, which in turn is determined by the track-width of the vehicle (the distance between the driving wheels) and the radius of the turn.|$|R
40|$|A {{dynamical}} {{model is}} {{developed for the}} rotating composite shaft with shape-memory alloy (SMA) wires embedded in. The rotating shaft is represented as a thin-walled composite of circular cross-section with SMA wires embedded parallel to <b>shaft’s</b> <b>longitudinal</b> axis. A thermomechanical constitutive equation of SMA proposed by Brinson is employed and the recovery stress of the constrained SMA wires is derived. The equations of motion are derived based on the variational-asymptotical method (VAM) and Hamilton’s principle. The partial differential equations of motion are reduced to the ordinary differential equations of motion by using the Galerkin method. The model incorporates the transverse shear, rotary inertia, and anisotropy of composite material. Numerical results of natural frequencies and critical speeds are obtained. It is shown that the natural frequencies of the nonrotating shaft and the critical rotating speed increase as SMA wire fraction and initial strain increase {{and the increase in}} natural frequencies becomes more significant as SMA wire fraction increases. The initial strain of SMA wires appears to have marginal effect on dynamical behaviors of the shaft. The actuation performance of SMA wires is found to be closely related to the ply-angle...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical method of solving torsional vibration problems concerning a sandwich circular shaft with a viscoelastic soft and light interlayer. The elasticity and damping coefficients of the inter-layer {{are assumed to}} be dependent on its geometrical characteristic and viscoelastic properties of the interlayer material. Complex functions of a real variable are applied in the solution to free and forced vibration problems. Then, the property of orthogonality of complex modes of the free vibration, which is the basis for solving the free vibration problem for arbitrary initial conditions, has been demonstrated. The {{solution to the problem of}} real stationary forced vibration has been obtained on the grounds of the complex stationary modes of vibration.

40|$|The {{sample of}} fossil human bones from the Sima de los Huesos, Atapuerca, has been {{analysed}} to trace parts of its taphonomic history. The work reported here {{is restricted to}} analysis of the skeletal elements preserved and their surface modifications. Preliminary plans of specimen distribution published 6 years ago indicate that the skeletal elements are dispersed within the cave, but more recent data are not yet available. Most of the fossils are broken, with some breakage when the bone was fresh and some when already partly mineralized, both types showing some rounding. There are few <b>longitudinal</b> breaks on <b>shafts</b> of long bones and so very few bone splinters. All skeletal elements are preserved but in unequal proportions, with elements like femora, humeri and mandibles and teeth with greater structural density being best represented. There {{is no evidence of}} weathering or of human damage such as cut marks on any of the human assemblage, but trampling damage is present on most bones. Carnivore damage is also common, with some present on more than half the sample, but it is mostly superficial, either on the surfaces of shafts and articular ends or on the edges of spiral breaks. The sizes and distribution of the carnivore pits indicate extensive canid activity, and this is interpreted as scavenging of the bones in place in the cave. Indications of tooth marks from a larger carnivore indicate the activity possibly of a large felid: the marks are too large to be produced by small canids, with the larger marks concentrated on spiral breaks on the more robust bones, and {{there is no evidence of}} bone crushing and splintering in the manner of hyaenas. The nature of the SH human assemblage is also consistent with accumulation by humans, the evidence for this being the lack of other animals, especially the lack of herbivorous animals, associated with the humans, and the high number of individuals preserved. Part of the documentary material was made by the photo units of the Natural History Museum of London and the Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales. This research was made possible by a grant from the L. S. B. Leakey Foundation. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Presentation, {{peer review}} and public {{discussion}} about the intermediary research output of my Ph. D. TALES FROM THE SUBCONSCIOUS The Hidden Room BLOGGING WITH MYSELF IN WORD[S] … 7 April 2010 : 11. 20 PM GAP ONE: I discovered {{a gap in the}} [my?] lack of direct [embodied] connection with the dimension and the scale of [the site] in the Landscape. Either I did not pay enough attention to it, or I disappeared into the vague cloud of ʻthe unspeakableʼ. Then, I nested myself in this cosy easy unawareness for years. But, little by little, I began to feel uneasy about this: had I done and did I do enough to bridge this gap, this unconforting feeling of: is that all there is in a[n architectural] life? I was pondering for days and weeks and months and years, and gradually, through other people, and especially through [my] cultural mentors, this pondering mutated into conscious reflection, which made me see this gap as something not to simply accept, but as a space that can be bridged. Subsequently, looking back at my own practice, acres of missed Landscape opportunities stretched out vastly behind me. So, the first thing to endeavor was {{to go back to the}} PAST, to clean up unfinished business, starting from that question about the future: what is the projection NOW of the FUTURE architect I want to be in five years. Then I put my favourite pencil on a piece of paper I like, starting to make new sketches and new drawings of a future yet to come close, my right hand moving slowly, sensitively, feeling the measurements of my hand combining in an almost autonomous ritual, through accumulated experience of scale and embodied Landscape both gathered over years of practice and half a liftetime of intense living up till NOW. GAP TWO: But there is another gap to bridge, or are we talking about the same gap here? What are the ways master builders deal with Landscape? What is MY way to deal with Landscape, the small building master I would like to be? Investigating this, what could be my way to deal with the Landscape, the great building master I would like to become in my future practice? And what could this mean for the way to deal with Landscape in future praxis of Making Architecture? 8 April 2010 : 4. 56 PM Designing ʻtales from the Subconscious Oneʼ: GAP THREE: Today I found myself in the middle of nowhere. Feeling alienated from both an embodied connection with the scale and measurements of the Landscape and from the existence of my personal spacial intelligence [Van Schaïk]. So I have to look in both directions, reaching out in the Landscape and measuring both the site and myself, ànd looking inside to trace the eidetic moments in my personal spatial history, going back to my Grandmotherʼs House and a trip to Ostend, on July 14 th 1966. My Grandmother could reveal Tales from the Unconscious through the revelation of spaces up till now hidden safely, while Ostend could bring in the measurement of the pace of walking man, with a conscious step in space over a certain amount of time, introducing embodied measurements of space as a mental awareness in the act of making architecture. 9 April 2010 : 10. 55 AM Pondering hybrid structure: yes or no? I ʻpromisedʼ myself I would make this house completely out of brick. But at some strategic points, I would like to introduce some very visible opposites: thick brick masses only working upon the principle of compression, alternated strategically -both in the spatial and the optical image- with structural elements working on tensile stress. By the principle of contrast these two bearing principles of statics can reinforce one another by the image they provoke, combined with our embodied knowing of opposite forces, and the way we can make them ʻneutraliseʼ each other to obtain a balance in the masses and the sights, resulting in a comforting space-play through readable structural principles. Limiting myself ʻto only brickworkʼ in the design process would lead to a self imposed limitation of spatial potential, so indispensable in what comes hierarchically on top in this house, in which the Tales from the Subconscious prevail. Coming first, they have to be served by the Techné in order to reach Poiesis. So, this option being pondered and being aware of this hierarchy, I can go on. This not only implies a principle for this design, but it could also become a design-principle for future designs. What am I going to do next? Well: itʼs 11. 55 AM now, this consideration has taken some time, and it also kept me awake until 4. 35 AM last night. I might have a sandwich, or I might make some sketches of a steel beam bearing both the brick vault and the light shaft of the living room, and by choosing the steal beam instead of a series of heavy brick arches, I even can disclose the living room and provide it with a <b>longitudinal</b> light <b>shaft,</b> emphasizing the <b>longitudinal</b> spatial characteristic of this space, and by doing so, opening up doors to discover the up till now hidden room, metaphorically, as new space conquered upon the unknown, pre-presuming its existence through my own mental spatial history that feeds my designer intuition. To conclude: this design situation makes me think of Alvaro Sizaʼs Centro Gallego de Arte Contemporaneo in Santiago de Compostela (and in a more direct way, of the simple solution Aldo Rossi aplied to span the window bays in his Berlin appartments), where he introduces an obvious steel beam that bears a huge mass of stone volume. I want to extend this concept into a permanent building site solution, a shoring timber and buttress solution, transscribed in steel as to say out loud: I had to do this, to save the situation from falling down, putting a beam under it, putting a buttress under the beam, and I had no time to waste, so all of it remains in the sight, visibly readable for the users of the building and passers-by in public space, giving access to the lecture of the structure, and by reading the work of gravitation transscribed in the real matter of steel bearing the masses of spanning and vaulting brickwork, being at ease with your own existence while standing with both of your feet in a clay world that will absorb your body one day. Itʼs like reading the structure of a Gothic cathedral during a boring religious ceremony, conducting your own rituals to kill time in a useful way until the priest gives permission to go out in open space. Thank God, the Sun is shining today, so I can feel the light shaft better in my design process. 10 April 2010 : 17. 45 Designing Tales from the Subconscious 1 reveals spaces quite unexpected. This really appears to be the hidden room, a GAP I wanted to bridge since a very long time. On the one hand, I manage to create the ʻhidden roomsʼ by design, by concept, in many ways I could explain by pointing at the drawings. One the other hand, some unexpected opportunities pop up while I investigate the bearing strucutre of the whole. As the cross section reveals, through designing, the necessity to construct buttresses of brick masses becomes obvious [see: cross section, the orthografia layer in the Vectorworks document]. Caused by the volumetric configuration -as the design is growing- these buttress masses themselves form specific intersticed spaces, possibly accessible for walking or storing things. The latter possibility could be applied to form the endless wardrobe, or a hidden cavity to hide during unexpected wartime. I have designed a water well, captured in a water pit, which will be the subject of a separate building mass that will be hooked onto the composition as a whole. The presence of the water pit as a vertical spatiality contrasts with the horizontal stretching of the design in the horizontal ridges in the Landscape. status: publishe...|$|R
