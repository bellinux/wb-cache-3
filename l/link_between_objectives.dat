40|$|Component-based {{software}} development {{is widely regarded}} as a promising approach to improving productivity and quality. However, progress in component-based {{software development}} has been slower than expected. A possible explanation for this slow progress is that there are not enough software components that can satisfy users (consumers). From this perspective, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to increase our knowledge about consumers of software components and to understand what aspects of software components are likely to affect consumer behavior. Specifically, this paper seeks to establish <b>links</b> <b>between</b> <b>objective</b> features of software components and consumers' preferences and purchasing behavior. The pragmatic utility of using objective features as predictors of consumers' behavior in regard to software components can be high. Since these objective features are under the direct control of producers, by understanding the relationship <b>between</b> the <b>objective</b> features and consumer behavior, producers can more effectively develop software components adapted to consumers' needs. We conducted this research in an artificial environment using a system called SofTrade, which was built for the purpose of teaching and studying the design, production, marketing, and purchasing of software components. Our results suggest that objective features of software components can be effective predictors of consumers' preferences and purchasing behavior, and therefore may provide practical guidance to software component producers regarding how to develop more marketable software components...|$|R
40|$|When {{speaking}} about ageing in place, risk of accidents and subsequent injuries {{is an important}} part of individual worries, and risk avoidance or risk minimisation are main concerns of older people and their caregivers. Findings show that older people are more at risk of unintended injuries than younger people (i. e. falls, foodborne diseases). Moreover, individual concerns and associated worries to avoid specific risks may even lead to the decision to move to an institution. In this context it is important to consider that being “as safe as possible” with respect to objective parameters does not necessarily indicate the subjective feeling of being safe. The feeling of safety and the objective degree of safety are not linearly related in a way that increasing one factor will increase the other and conversely. Furthermore, some factors that can contribute to objectively enhance safety may even lead to greater feeling of unsafety. Our review aims to investigate the relationship <b>between</b> <b>objective</b> and subjective safety in the context of ageing in place as well as the underlying mechanisms that help to explain the different <b>links</b> <b>between</b> <b>objective</b> and subjective safety. A further goal is offer a heuristic model presenting factors that may help to enhance older people’s consciousness of safety and thus quality of life.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of vehicle steering perception are decisive factors concerning vehicle safety and overall pleasure behind the wheel. It {{is a challenge}} for vehicle manufacturers to achieve these features and qualities, because usually vehicle tuning almost only relies on subjective evaluation of test drivers, which is costly and time consuming. In order to optimize suspension design and develop a tool {{that can be used}} to evaluate steering with objective metrics instead of subjective assessment, <b>links</b> <b>between</b> them must be confirmed. In this master thesis, both objective and subjective testing data of over 20 vehicles across four different segments are introduced in linear and nonlinear analysis. Linear regression analysis is applied to investigate simply positive or negative correlation between a pair of subjective-objective parameters. However, even if certain linear correlations are obtained, it is still hard to define the optimal value for objective metrics. Considering that the general shape of a correlation function can reveal which objective range give higher subjective rating, it is possible to define these preferred ranges with Neural Network (NN). The best data available is adopted from three drivers who tested 15 sedans, and some interesting results are found. The initial results demonstrate that NN is a powerful tool to uncover and graphically illustrate the <b>links</b> <b>between</b> <b>objective</b> metrics and subjective assessments, i. e., the specific range leading to better steering feel. Given a larger sample size, more reliable and optimal links can be defined by following the same method. These confirmed links would enable vehicle dynamics engineers to more effectively develop new vehicles with nearly perfect steering feel...|$|R

40|$|The {{desire to}} obtain value and justify {{investments}} {{from the different}} Information Systems in place in organizations {{has been around for}} a long time. Organizations constantly theorize and implement different approaches that provide some sort of alignment between their different business objectives and Information Systems. Unfortunately, the environments in which these organizations operate are often dynamic, constantly changing with influence from external and internal factors that require continual realignment of the Information Systems with business objectives to provide value. When businesses evolve, leading to changes in business requirements, it is hard to know what direct Information System changes are needed to respond to the new requirements. Similarly, when there are changes in the Information System, it is not often easy to discern which business objectives are directly affected. Whilst the different Enterprise Architecture frameworks available today provide and propose some form of alignment, in their implementation, they do not show <b>links</b> <b>between</b> business <b>objectives</b> and Information Systems, i. e., indicating what Information System is directly responsible for different business objectives thereby allowing for anticipation and support of changes as the business evolves.

This Business Intelligence - Enabled Adaptive Enterprise Architecture framework allows for anticipating and supporting proactively the adaptation of Enterprise Architecture as and when the business evolves.

40|$|While {{the pattern}} of social {{mobility}} in postwar Britain has been extensively studied, revealing considerable upward mobility, much less {{is known about the}} subjective dimension to mobility. In this article, we employ a new sample of in-depth interviews with 50 -year old men from the National Child Development Study to examine in detail the <b>link</b> <b>between</b> <b>objective</b> mobility patterns and the way the upwardly mobile narrate their life trajectories. In contrast to the mobility ideology suggested by the Oxford mobility survey of the early 1970 s, in which the upwardly mobile recognized and internalized their success as a project of the self, we report how members of this later generation of men with highly successful careers prefer instead to articulate ‘modest’ life stories. By treating the career as a narrative device, we are able to show how the disavowal of the dominant, linear hierarchical career model by these men allows them to tell particular and distinctive stories which establish their individuality and personhood, while, paradoxically, recognizing the cultural power of the dominant model. In particular, we highlight the use of ‘linear contingent’ narratives by these men, in which specific events, especially those connected with occupational and geographical transitions, are deployed as contingent thresholds to mark out key shifts and passages in their lives. We then compare their accounts with those of immobile and downwardly men, who instead deploy ‘ghostly’ stories, preoccupied by the past, or defensive accounts, displaying unease with their failure {{to live up to the}} expectations of the linear career model. Having shown that men's accounts of mobility are suffused with an awareness of their need to establish their own individuality through repudiating the social trope of the instrumental careerist, we conclude that the <b>links</b> <b>between</b> career identities and objective mobility patterns are not straightforward and need careful unravelling...|$|R

40|$|Drowsiness {{is one of}} {{the major}} factors {{explaining}} accidents, particularly in traffic accidents but also in work situations with serious consequences (e. g. medicine). The drowsiness may be assessed by diverse measures that vary from physiological and unconscious data (e. g. EEG) to subjective and conscious evaluation. In their daily life, people are used to evaluate their drowsiness by subjective assessment and research observes a great inter-individual variation in this evaluation. Moreover, the subjective evaluation is dependent on the situation and the risk perceived by the person (e. g., new versus usual situations, simple versus complex environments, etc.). In this theoretical context, our purpose was to investigate the <b>links</b> <b>between</b> 1) <b>objective</b> performance (reaction time) measured by a psychomotor vigilance task (PVT), 2) data from eye movements and 3) subjective assessment of drowsiness (measured with Karolinska Sleepiness Scale, KSS). 12 persons, aged from 20 to 56, participated individually. They were asked to respect a 60 % sleep deprivation during the night before the experiment and to not drink any energy drinks the day of the experiment. The experiment was conducted between 1 and 3 PM after a heavy lunch in order to increase the circadian effect. Moreover, the temperature of the room was 25 ° in order to increase drowsiness. Each participant was asked to perform 4 PVT. However, although 100 % of participants performed the first two PVT, only 66 % were able to perform the third PVT and only 33 % of participants performed the fourth and last PVT. Our results showed an effect of time on objective performance, eye movements and subjective assessment of drowsiness in PVT 1 and 2 : significant increase of reaction time, increase of eye closure and perclos, reduction of pupil diameter and increase of subjective drowsiness estimation (KSS). Only the frequency and duration of blinks remained constant across time. In PVT 3 and 4, data from eye movements and objective performance (reaction time) did not vary anymore across the time. Only the subjective estimation of drowsiness (KSS) continued to increase. Furthermore, subjective estimation of drowsiness was differently correlated with eye movements and objective performance across the PVT; it was significantly correlated with reaction time (PVT 1, 2, 3), blink frequency and duration (PVT 1, 2, 3), perclos (PVT 1, 2, 3, 4), eye closure (PVT 2, 3), pupil diameter (PVT 1, 2, 3, 4). These results are discussed and integrated in an ergonomic approach in order to analyze the <b>links</b> <b>between</b> <b>objective</b> performance, eye movements and subjective assessment of drowsiness.

40|$|Introduction: Rolf Landauer {{declared}} in 1991 that ‘information is physical’. Since then, information {{has come to}} be seen by many physicists as a fundamental component of the physical world; indeed by some as the physical component. This idea is now gaining currency in popular science communication. However, it is often far from clear what exactly this statement means; exactly how is information physical? And why this should matter for information science? The {{purpose of this paper is}} to clarify just what is meant by the physical nature of information, and the significance of these considerations for our discipline. Methods: A selective literature review and conceptual analysis, based on literature from both physical science and information science. Results: The prospect of attempting to make <b>links</b> <b>between</b> <b>objective</b> and subjective conceptions of information has been strongly advocated by some authors and doubted by others. The physical nature of information can be understood from three main perspectives: the relation between information and physical entropy; the strongly informational nature of the quantum view of nature; and the possibility of recasting physical laws in informational terms. Conclusions: Based on this analysis, we muse on the relevance of such issues to information science, with particular reference to emergent properties of information. Apart from the added public awareness of the i-word in a very different context from the norm, it may that that there are general laws and principles, or at least useful metaphors and analogies, linking the concept of information in the physical, biological and social domains...|$|R

By distinguishing perceived ability from actual ability and using theoretical underpinnings from the human capital theory and self-efficacy, the proposed hypotheses are tested on a dataset comprising respondents from the adult population. Methodology: Using 20046 observations from the Adult population survey (APS) collected according to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) methodology, a logistic regression analysis controlling for robust interaction term is {{used to determine the}} direct as well as the moderating effect of perceived entrepreneurial ability and high actual ability in influencing the decision to initiate nascent entrepreneurial activities. Findings: The results reveal that perceived entrepreneurial ability has a distinct positive influence on the decision to initiate entrepreneurial activities and its impact is greater than that of actual abilities. Furthermore, we find evidence of a positive interaction effect suggesting that perceived entrepreneurial ability is key to encouraging nascent entrepreneurial initiatives among those with high ability. Originality and Value: The main contribution of our study is to highlight the role of subjective judgments of ability in influencing entrepreneurial behaviour. Whereas prior research has found that high actual ability influences new venture performance, its influence on entrepreneurial entry was inconclusive. By adding perceived entrepreneurship to our model we not only establish a <b>link</b> <b>between</b> <b>objective</b> (observable) abilities and subjective (unobservable) abilities of individuals but also suggest the mechanism how such abilities drive the business entry decisions of individuals.

Therefore, the purpose of this project, was to contribute to adaptation and validation of an existing simulator for simulation of C-arm X-ray imaging. Firstly, the study of the existing simulation tool was performed to choose further development axes. Afterwards, preliminary estimations of simulation complexity by evaluating the number of photons for a given imaging examination were performed. Previous studies[1] showed the determining impact of focal spot on imaging performance (reducing the limiting spatial frequency in common examination conditions) of X-ray interventional imaging systems.   Therefore, the work focused on the improvements of source model, in particular realistic focal spot was defined and simulations of images with close-to-real sharpness were performed and compared to experimentally acquired images. Finally, a part of this project was dedicated to scatter study.

Although Tasmania has an example of world 1 s best practice planning legislation there are no <b>links</b> <b>between</b> the <b>objective</b> of sustainable development and the decision making process in regard to {{land subdivision}}. A <b>link</b> <b>between</b> the <b>objective</b> of sustainable development and the actual planning schemes which govern how land is used is required. A greater emphasis on how land is used instead of what land is used for is needed. Performance based planning schemes are moving towards addressing the requirements of how developments occur. The legislative process is fundamental in controlling the outcome of subdivision {{in order to meet}} the sustainable development objective. The outcome of a subdivision is dependent on how the land is ultimately used. The process needs to be outcome focussed as many of the consequences of land subdivision are practically impossible to reverse, particularly in the case of the natural environment. It is apparent that once the subdivision has been approved it too late to retro-fit sustainable development principles. The decision needs to be made at a early stage; can or should this parcel of land be subdivided at all? The project has shown that there is a over supply of subdivided land suitable for residential development which clearly does not meet the sustainable development objective of the Land Use Planning and Approvals Act 1993 (LUPAA). The reasons for this situation have been given, along with a historical perspective on the current situation to better understand the issues involved. This historical perspective also gives an understanding of what is possible and how circumstances may be changed. Clearly, urgent action needs to be taken to prevent the oversupply of land and subsequent degradation of the environment.

40|$|Diverse political, {{cultural}} and biological needs epitomise the contrasting demands impacting on {{the mandate of}} the South African National Parks (SANParks) to maintain biological diversity. Systems-based approaches and strategic adaptive management (learn by doing) enable SANParks to accommodate these demands. However, such a management strategy creates new information needs, which require an appropriate analytical approach. We use conceptual <b>links</b> <b>between</b> <b>objectives,</b> indicators, mechanisms and modulators to identify key concerns in the context of and related to management objectives. Although our suggested monitoring designs are based mostly on defined or predicted underlying mechanisms of a concern, SANParks requires inventory monitoring to evaluate its key mandate. We therefore propose a predictive inventory approach based on species assemblages related to habitat preferences. Inventories alone may not always adequately serve unpacking of mechanisms: in some cases population size needs to be estimated to meet the information needs of management strategies, but actual population sizes may indirectly affect how the species impact on other values. In addition, ecosystem objectives require multivariate assessments of key communities, which can be used in trend analysis. SANParks therefore needs to know how to detect and define trends efficiently, which, in turn, requires precision of measures of variables. Conservation implications: Current research needs with regard to monitoring should focus on defining designs to yield optimal precision whilst taking methodology, survey trade-offs and analytical approaches into account. Use of these directives and research will guide monitoring during evaluation of SANParks objectives at various scales.

Loneliness is divided into objective and subjective {{to make it clear}} what is being looked at, and also the connection between the two has been considered. To approach this problem, countries have been chosen to represent liberal, corporatist, and social democratic welfare state regimes by the criteria that the respective characteristics are the most clear. The countries which have been analyzed are Sweden (social-democratic), Poland (corporatist) and Great Britain (liberal). In general, these countries correspond to the theoretical criteria as a whole, but to further the analysis specific policies of the welfare state has been broken down into four aspects; family, housing, unemployment and pension policy. The material is drawn from the European Social Survey and has then been recoded. To analyze this, cross tables has been made to see the spread of both kinds of loneliness, and a linear probability model has been done to look at the difference in the odds of feeling lonely or not between the countries. The results show that subjective loneliness is lower in Sweden, as well as most types of objective loneliness, except living alone. Between the different countries, there was a small difference in chance of feeling lonely even when the composition was taken into account. However, the <b>links</b> <b>between</b> <b>objective</b> and subjective loneliness was not deemed statistically significant when comparing the countries, except one of the types of loneliness.

Both these approaches treated the mother and child as if they and their relationship existed in a vacuum. Therefore a third stream needed to be considered: those studies that attempted an intersubjective description of the social context in which disclosure and response occur. The research then required development of a conceptual frame comprehensive {{enough to hold the}} varying interpretations that emerged from the literature. This frame needed to make conceptual <b>links</b> <b>between</b> <b>objective,</b> subjective and intersubjective descriptions. To do so, I employed four theoretical lenses by which their responses might be reconsidered: attachment theory, trauma theory, loss and grief theory, and caregiving theory. The result of this critical interpretive synthesis is that when all three approaches (objective, subjective and intersubjective) are applied to the women’s experience, a fuller assessment of their capacity to provide care and protection is gained. This assessment also provides a window into what will support women as mothers. I have proposed that attachment theory, trauma theory, grief and loss theory, and caregiving theory are present in the literature reviewed, and I suggest conceptual links by providing interpretations of how I see them positioned to support women when combined with therapeutic knowledge and clinical understanding. The critical interpretive synthesis revealed the complexity of what women and children experience and showed that by identifying and providing women in this context with the appropriate clinical care we provide enduring care and protection of children, families and society...|$|R
40|$|Looking on {{the mass}} media {{industry}} management during economic crisis, we notice that this field is undergoing, even outside economic context, real bursts of crisis. In {{the first part of}} this study, we’lltry to analyse briefly the way in which mass media is perceived and presented in recent articles and interviews written by different journalists or public figures. In the second part, we’ll describe a few performance elements within Romanian mass media industry. In this respect, we suggest three analysis concepts: expansion, audience and income. The third part will focus on management by objectives. We willtry to demonstrate the <b>link</b> <b>between</b> management <b>objectives</b> and results from a quality perspective. If the objectives are political, quality is not really important or is defined in a different way. In the last part of our study, the emphasis is on limits as well as on qualityand performance proposals in mass media industry in times of economic crisis...|$|R
40|$|Online {{communities}} in the enterprise are designed to fulﬁl some economic purpose, for example for supporting products or enabling work-collaboration between knowledge workers. The intentions of such communities {{allow them to be}} labelled based on their type - i. e. communities of practice, team communities, technical support communities, etc. Despite the disparate nature and explicit intention of community types, little is known of how the types differ in terms of a) the participation and activity, and b) the behaviour of community users. Such insights could provide community managers with an understanding of normality and a diagnosis of healthiness in their community, given its type and corresponding user needs. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of community types from the enterprise social software system IBM Connections. We assess the micro (userlevel) and macro (community-level) characteristics of differing community types and identify key differences in the behaviour that users exhibit in these communities. We further qualify our empirical ﬁndings with user questionnaires by identifying <b>links</b> <b>between</b> the <b>objectives</b> of the users and the characteristics of the community types...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} method for pricing {{counterparty}} risk by using good deal bounds. The method imposes a new restriction in the arbitrage free model by setting upper bounds on the Sharpe ratios of the assets. The potential prices which are eliminated represent unreasonably good deals. The constraint on the Sharpe ratio translates into a constraint on the stochastic discount factor. Thus, one can obtain tight pricing bounds. Previ-ous literature on counterparty risk and good deal bounds involved structural models. We allow for counterparty risk to be given by intensity-based models. Also, previous literature on counterparty risk with intensity models uses pricing directly under the risk neutral measure- which is not unique. We provide a <b>link</b> <b>between</b> the <b>objective</b> probability measure {{and the range of}} potential risk neutral measures which has an in-tuitive economic meaning. Also, we study numerically the tightness of the bounds and underline the use of good deal bounds for risk management. In this context, we also study portfolio effects on the good deal bounds prices...|$|R
