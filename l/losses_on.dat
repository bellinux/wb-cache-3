5|$|After {{the end of}} the Battle of France and the {{evacuation}} of British troops from Dunkirk during Operation Dynamo, much of Britain's war production and effort was channeled into RAF Bomber Command and the strategic bombing offensive against Germany. However, bomber <b>losses</b> <b>on</b> each raid began to increase during 1941, which British intelligence concluded was due to German use of advanced radar equipment.|$|E
5|$|All of {{the gains}} {{made by the}} Black Watch and Calgary Highlanders were lost to German counterattacks, which inflicted heavy <b>losses</b> <b>on</b> the Highlanders and the {{previously}} unscathed Black Watch support company. The Black Watch had to be reformed after Verrières Ridge, having sustained more casualties than any Canadian infantry battalion since the disastrous raid on Dieppe.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} with the peasants' arsenals, Egypt's military possessed modern arms and artillery. The use of cannons on open battlefields in particular inflicted heavy <b>losses</b> <b>on</b> the rebels.

5|$|<b>Losses</b> <b>on</b> {{the ground}} {{amounted}} to eight fighters (two Spitfires). Around 28 aircraft of other types were destroyed on the ground. The total destroyed or {{damaged beyond repair}} amounted to 68 aircraft, although 17 of these were trainers or non-operational types.|$|E

5|$|A country's {{external}} {{wealth is}} measured by the value of its foreign assets net of its foreign liabilities. A current account surplus (and corresponding financial account deficit) indicates an increase in external wealth while a deficit indicates a decrease. Aside from current account indications of whether a country is a net buyer or net seller of assets, shifts in a nation's external wealth are influenced by capital gains and capital <b>losses</b> <b>on</b> foreign investments. Having positive external wealth means a country is a net lender (or creditor) in the world economy, while negative external wealth indicates a net borrower (or debtor).|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} the {{southern}} carmine bee-eater in Zimbabwe showed that it was affected by deliberate interference and persecution and loss of woodlands, and that nesting sites are lost though poor water management leading to river bank damage, dam construction and panning for gold. Colonies are becoming concentrated into the national parks and the Zambezi Valley. The well-studied European bee-eater is trapped and shot on migration in countries bordering the Mediterranean, an estimated 4,000–6,000 annually being killed in Cyprus alone, but with a global population of between 170,000 and 550,000 pairs even <b>losses</b> <b>on</b> that scale make little overall impact.|$|E
5|$|Across Micronesia, {{impact from}} the typhoon was fairly limited. Winds on Nukuoro were {{estimated}} at 45–75km/h (30–45mph), resulting in minor {{damage to buildings}} and crops. <b>Losses</b> <b>on</b> the atoll reached $10,000. Lukunor, located farther west, experienced similar winds; however, damage was slightly more severe. Notable coastal impact took place, with portions of the dock and sea wall damaged. Damage across Lukunor and nearby islands amounted to $20,000.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 21st century, the {{landscape}} of large leveraged buyout firms was changing. Several large and storied firms, including Hicks Muse Tate & Furst and Forstmann Little & Company were dragged down by heavy losses in the bursting of the telecom bubble. Although, KKR's track record since RJR Nabisco was mixed, <b>losses</b> <b>on</b> such investments as Regal Entertainment Group, Spalding, Flagstar and Primedia (previously K-III Communications) were offset by successes in Willis Group, Wise Foods, Inc., Wincor Nixdorf and MTU Aero Engines, among others.|$|E
50|$|West was {{suspended}} indefinitely following an argument after a preseason <b>loss</b> <b>on</b> October 15, 2012.

50|$|In pyroprocessing {{industries}} such as lime, calcined bauxite, refractories or cement manufacture, the <b>loss</b> <b>on</b> ignition of the {{raw material}} is roughly equivalent to the loss in mass that it will undergo in a kiln. Similarly for minerals the <b>loss</b> <b>on</b> ignition represents the actual material lost during smelting or refining in a furnace or smelter. The <b>loss</b> <b>on</b> ignition of the product indicates {{the extent to which}} the pyroprocessing was incomplete. ASTM tests are defined for limestone and lime and cement among others.|$|R
50|$|Bruce played three {{official}} full internationals for New Zealand, {{making his}} debut in a 2-3 loss to New Caledonia on 29 July 1969. His other two matches were both losses against Israel, a 0-4 <b>loss</b> <b>on</b> 28 September and a 0-2 <b>loss</b> <b>on</b> 1 October 1969.|$|R
5|$|Cornhusker Ahman Green, who {{had started}} most of Nebraska's games during the regular season, entered the game and ran three {{straight}} plays for 24 yards. On the third play, Green fumbled the ball, which was recovered by a Nebraska player. Frost then completed an 11-yard pass for a first down to the Tech 21-yard line. The Cornhuskers were stopped for <b>losses</b> <b>on</b> two consecutive running plays, but Frost broke free for a 22-yard touchdown run. The score and subsequent extra point gave the Cornhuskers a 4121 lead with 3:26 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|Following the Battle of Berlin, No.467 Squadron {{began to}} {{concentrate}} on targets in France and Belgium as the Allied air campaign shifted focus from strategic bombing to destroying airfields and disrupting lines of communication prior to {{the invasion of the}} continent. On the night of 10/11 April, Balmer led not only his own unit but a total of 148 aircraft of No.5 Group RAF in an assault on Toulouse, striking at an airfield, and aircraft and explosives factories. The bombing was highly accurate, and the Australians suffered no <b>losses</b> <b>on</b> the raid.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of Operations Southeast Croatia and Ozren, German and NDH forces conducted Operation Prijedor in northwest Bosnia. The Germans inflicted considerable <b>losses</b> <b>on</b> the Partisans and captured extensive territory and population centres from them; however, they failed to eliminate them as a military factor and shortly afterwards had to undertake Operation Trio in the region immediately south of the area of operations for Operations Southeast Croatia and Ozren.|$|E

50|$|Many systems allow a {{deduction}} for <b>loss</b> <b>on</b> sale, exchange, or abandonment of both business and non-business income producing assets. This deduction {{may be limited}} to gains from the same class of assets. In the U.S., a <b>loss</b> <b>on</b> non-business assets is considered a capital loss, and deduction of the loss is limited to capital gains. Also, in the U.S. a <b>loss</b> <b>on</b> {{the sale of the}} taxpayer's principal residence or other personal assets is not allowed as a deduction except to the extent due to casualty or theft.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the impact of}} user effects on the {{performance}} of receive antenna diversity systems in flat Rayleigh fading channels. Three diversity combining techniques are compared: maximal ratio combining (MRC), equal gain combining (EGC), and selection combining (SC). User effects are considered in two scenarios: 1) body loss (the reduction of effective antenna gain due to user effects) on a single antenna, and 2) equal body <b>loss</b> <b>on</b> both antennas. The system performance is assessed in terms of mean SNR, link reliability, bit error rate of BPSK, diversity order and ergodic capacity. Our results show that body <b>loss</b> <b>on</b> a single antenna has limited (bounded) impact on system performance. In comparison, body <b>loss</b> <b>on</b> both antennas has unlimited (unbounded) impact and can severely degrade system performance. Our results also show that with increasing body <b>loss</b> <b>on</b> a single antenna the performance of EGC drops faster than that of MRC and SC. When body <b>loss</b> <b>on</b> a single antenna is larger than a certain level, EGC is not a “sub-optimal” method anymore and has worse performance than SC...|$|R
5|$|Having decisively won {{the battle}} and once again turned the tide {{of the war in}} favor of the Communists, the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River {{represented}} the peak of the Chinese military's performance in Korea. However, Mao interpreted the UN ceasefire as a weakness that China should further exploit. Against advice from Peng and other senior military leaders, Mao ordered the PVA to invade South Korea—a mission that was beyond the Chinese military's abilities while breaking the fragile Chinese supply lines. Recognizing the Chinese difficulties, Ridgway then led the Eighth Army to inflict severe <b>losses</b> <b>on</b> the PVA during the Chinese offensives of 1951.|$|E
