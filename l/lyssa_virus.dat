40|$|Rabies, a fatal viral {{zoonotic}} infectious disease, {{persists in}} both {{developed and developing}} countries worldwide in spite of successful preventive public health measures and postexposure therapies. Each year, an estimated 55. 000 people die of rabies in Africa and Asia where infection is endemic in dogs. The World Health Organization (WHO) has indicated that approximately 45 % of these victims are {{children under the age}} of 15 years. The incidence of rabies has decreased significantly in developed countries, following mandatory vaccination of all domestic animals. Rabies is an acute, progressive, viral encephalitis usually resulting in death. The causative agents are neurotropic RNA viruses of the Rhabdoviridea family, genus <b>Lyssa</b> <b>virus.</b> The virus is present in saliva and is transmitted by bites or, rarely, by contamination of mucosa or skin lesions by saliva or other potentially infectious material (eg, neural tissue). In addition, the transmission of rabies has been described in patients receiving organ transplants (eg, corneal transplant). Prevention of the disease is very important because most human cases of rabies are fatal and no specific therapy is available. Rabies postexposure prophylaxis, which is highly effective if given promptly, includes wound cleansing, immunization with modern cell culture vaccine, and administration of human rabies immunoglobulin (HRIG). The aim of this review is to review the current concept of the epidemiology, diagnosis, prevention, and control of rabies...|$|E
40|$|Rabies, a {{viral disease}} caused by <b>lyssa</b> <b>virus</b> of family Rhabdoviridae, is a fatal {{zoonotic}} disease with worldwide occurrence and endemic {{in developing countries}} of Africa and Asia. Rabies generally affects all warm-blooded animals, but it is primarily a disease of dogs in Ethiopia because access to suspected domestic canids and pets are not controlled indoor or by immunization. The major means of transmission of the disease is through any types of bite, scratch, or other situation in which saliva, cerebral, spinal fluid, tear, or nervous tissues from suspected or known rabid animal or person enters an open wound, is transplanted into, or comes in contact with mucus membrane of another animals or person. One of retrospective study of rabies in Addis Ababa from 1990 – 2000 indicated that an average of 2, 200 people per year received post – exposure antirabies treatment while 95 % of the reported fatal human rabies case was due to dog bites. The widespread {{use of traditional medicine}} among urban and rural population of Ethiopia could be attributed to cultural acceptability, physical accessibility and economic affordability. Individuals who are exposed to the rabies virus often see traditional healers for the diagnosis and treatments of the disease. Once the virus entered into body of exposed individuals through wound (abrasion) or direct contact with mucosal surface, then there, it replicates in the site of deposit (bitten site), where local viral proliferation occurs, and get access (viral attachment) to motor endplates. The clinical sign of the disease is nonspecific and difficult to differentiate without laboratory test, but some of signs such as pupil dilation in some case, paralysis (last stage) and hydrophobia are some characteristic signs. The control of access to domestic canid to other suspected animals is not only prevention method but also is treatment measures. Mass vaccination of dogs and removal of stray canids are the best measure of control. In general, this study provides an overview of the current status of Rabies in livestock and human in Ethiopia...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} the ability of rabies virus {{ribonucleoprotein}} (RNP) to induce a protective immune response in animals against lethal challenge with rabies and rabies-related <b>lyssa</b> <b>viruses.</b> Liposomes containing either RNP or the glycoprotein (G protein) of a variant virus with multiple alterations in the G antigenic structure conferred no or poor protection, respectively, against lethal intracerebral challenge with rabies virus. By contrast, liposomes containing RNP and the variant G protein induced a good protective response, comparable to that achieved with inactivated virus vaccine against intracerebral challenge. Moreover, mice or raccoons immunized with RNP alone resisted lethal peripheral challenge with homologous or heterologous virus strains. These {{results indicate that the}} RNP of rabies virus plays a crucial role in induction of protective immunity...|$|R
