He remained also chief editor of the daily, formatted as continuation of La Convicción. During the first decade it followed the Integrist line of Nocedal and Sarda; though after 1888 the daily remained within mainstream Traditionalism, it very much kept pursuing the same intransigent Catholic line. Correo remained a semi-official party paper in Catalonia, publishing orders and dispositions, mobilizing organizational work and disseminating propaganda. It chiefly consisted of 3 sections: news, opinion and fixed columns, dominated by religious subjects. The daily developed weekly mutations in Tarragona, Girona and Lleida. Its circulation is not clear; some sources claim 4,000 copies and some claim as much as 8,000 copies. Personal Llauder's trademark were his Sunday editorials. In 1899 he ceded command of the paper to Salvador Morales.The 1884-launched La Hormiga de Oro was among innovative periodicals on the Spanish market; published in A3, they combined text and high-quality graphics, first drawings and since early 1890s also photographs. The weekly aspired to the role of popular enciclopedia educativa; its contents comprised news, information, history, letters, arts, politics, though it was dominated by religion-related topics. Key difference between Hormiga and likewise reviews was its confessional nature; it was intended to disseminate Christian thought by means of affordable modern media.

We propose one such technique, Dynamic SIMD (DSIMD), which is aimed at reducing instruction fetch power in simultane-ously multithreaded (SMT) processors, which are already considered an area of interest in energy efficiency. In multithreaded workloads that happen to have inde-pendent threads that execute the same code, but not quite simultaneously, DSIMD will stall the <b>leading</b> <b>thread(s)</b> un-til they run in lockstep with those that lag behind. The benefits of this are twofold: first, instruction fetch only needs to be performed once for all threads in lockstep, with the unused fetch units clock gated to save power; sec-ond, contention for the instruction cache is reduced, low-ering the penalty cycles due to misses and thereby boosting performance. We present simulation results for DSIMD showing consistently high fetch savings (and therefore fetch power savings) of 24 % to 46 %, {{while at the same}} time improving performance. We also demonstrate a means of implementing DSIMD with minimal additions to existing fetch hardware. ...|$|R

To give form to these aspirations, the main research question that was {{the starting point of}} this dissertation was: How do people in the Netherlands use television narratives as a resource to develop a capacity for moral imagination in order to become morally mature? To answer this question, a framework derived from the literary culture was developed. The authors from the literary culture emphasise that the content of the narrative, as well as the reader are of importance for the development of moral imagination. In this study the television narrative was considered as a 'cultural toolbox' that offers moral insights that the active viewer still needs to give meaning to and can use to give meaning to everyday life experiences.

40|$|Abstract—Continued CMOS scaling is {{expected}} to make future microprocessors susceptible to transient faults, hard faults, manufacturing defects and process variations causing fault tolerance to become important even for general purpose processors targeted at the commodity market. To mitigate the effect of decreased reliability, a number of fault-tolerant architectures have been proposed that exploit the natural coarse-grained redundancy available in chip multiprocessors (CMPs). These architectures execute a single application using two threads, typically as one <b>leading</b> <b>thread</b> and one trailing thread. Errors are detected by comparing the outputs produced by these two threads. These architectures schedule a single application on two cores or two thread contexts of a CMP. As a result, besides the additional energy consumption and performance overhead that is required to provide fault tolerance, such schemes also impose a throughput loss. Consequently a CMP which is capable of executing 2 n threads in non-redundant mode can only execute half as many (n) threads in fault-tolerant mode. In this paper we propose multiplexed redundant execution (MRE), a low-overhead architectural technique that executes multiple trailing threads on a single processor core. MRE exploits the observation {{that it is possible to}} accelerate the execution of the trailing thread by providing execution assistance from the <b>leading</b> <b>thread.</b> Execution assistance combined with coarse-grained multithreading allows MRE to schedule multiple trailing threads concurrently on a single core with only a small performance penalty. Our results show that MRE increases the throughput of fault-tolerant CMP by 16 % over an ideal dual modular redundant (DMR) architecture. I...|$|E

40|$|With {{reducing}} feature size, increasing chip capacity, {{and increasing}} clock speed, microprocessors {{are becoming increasingly}} susceptible to transient (soft) errors. Redundant multi-threading (RMT) is an attractive approach for concurrent error detection and recovery. However, redundant threads significantly increase {{the pressure on the}} processor resources, resulting in dramatic performance impact. In this paper, we propose reducing resource redundancy as a means to mitigate the performance impact of redundancy. In this approach, all the instructions are redundantly executed, however, the redundant instructions do not use many of the resources used by an instruction. The approach taken to reduce resource redundancy is to exploit the runtime profile of the <b>leading</b> <b>thread</b> to optimally allocate resources to the trailing thread in a staggered RMT architecture. The key observation used in this approach is that, even with a small slack between the two threads, many instructions in the <b>leading</b> <b>thread</b> have already produced their results before their trailing counterparts are renamed. We investigate two techniques in this approach (i) register bits reuse technique that attempts to use the same register (but different bits) for both the copies of the same instruction, if the result produced by the instruction is of small size, and (ii) register value reuse technique that attempts to use the same register for a main instruction and a distinct redundant instruction, if both the instructions produce the same result. These techniques, along with some others, are used to reduce redundancy in register file, reorder buffer, and load/store buffer. The techniques are evaluated in terms of their performance, power, and vulnerability impact on an RMT processor. Our experiments show that the techniques achieve about 95 % performance improvement and about 17 % energy reduction. The vulnerability of the RMT remains the same with the techniques...|$|E
