50|$|The vapors {{from the}} top of the column are a mixture of {{hydrocarbon}} gases and naphtha, at a temperature of 120 °C-130 °C. The vapor stream associated with steam used at bottom of the column is condensed by the water cooler and the <b>liquid</b> <b>collected</b> in a vessel is known as reflux drum which is present at the top of the column. Some part of the liquid is returned to the top plate of the column as overhead reflux, and the remaining liquid is sent to a stabilizer column which separates gases from liquid naphtha. A few plates below the top plate, the kerosene is obtained as product at a temperature of 190 °C-200 °C. Part of this fraction is returned to the column after it is cooled by a heat exchanger. This cooled liquid is known as circulating reflux, and it is important to control the heat load in the column. The remaining crude oil is passed through a side stripper which uses steam to separate kerosene. The kerosene obtained is cooled and collected in a storage tank as raw kerosene, known as straight run kerosene that boils at a range of 140 °C-270 °C. A few plates below the kerosene draw plate, the diesel fraction is obtained at a temperature of 280 °C-300 °C. The diesel fraction is then cooled and stored. The top product from the atmospheric distillation column is a mixture of hydrocarbon gases, e.g., methane, ethane, propane, butane, and naphtha vapors. Residual oil present at the bottom of the column is known as reduced crude oil (RCO). The temperature of the stream at the bottom is 340 °C-350 °C, which is below the cracking temperature of oil.|$|E

40|$|We studied anesthetized sheep to {{determine}} the relationship between increased permeability pulmonary edema and the development and mechanism of pleural effusion formation. In 12 sheep with intact, closed thoraces, we studied {{the time course of}} pleural liquid formation after 0. 12 ml/kg i. v. oleic acid. After 1 h, there were no pleural effusions, even though extravascular lung water increased 50 % to 6. 0 +/- 0. 7 g/g dry lung. By 3 h pleural effusions had formed, they reached a maximum at 5 h (48. 5 +/- 16. 9 ml/thorax), and at 8 h there was no additional accumulation of pleural liquid (45. 5 +/- 16. 9 ml). Morphologic studies by light and electron microscopy demonstrated subpleural edema but no detectable injury to the visceral pleura, suggesting that the pleural liquid originated from the lung and not the pleura. In nine sheep, we quantified the rate of formation of pleural liquid by enclosing one lung in a plastic bag. By comparing in the same sheep the volume of pleural <b>liquid</b> <b>collected</b> from the enclosed lung to the volume found in the opposite intact chest, we estimated the rate of liquid absorption from the intact chest to be 0. 32 ml/(kg. h); we had previously reported a liquid absorption rate of 0. 28 ml/(kg. h) in normal sheep. These studies also supported the conclusion {{that the majority of the}} pleural liquid originated from the lung because we could account for all of the pleural liquid that was formed and cleared. The volume of pleural <b>liquid</b> <b>collected</b> from the enclosed lungs was equal to 21 % of the excess lung liquid that formed after oleic acid-induced lung injury. Thus, the pleural space and parietal pleural lymphatic pathways are important pathways for the clearance of pulmonary edema liquid after experimentally induced increased permeability pulmonary edema...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} and model efficiency during the filtration of a liquid aerosol through a fibrous filter. A series of experiments demonstrated that liquid particle filtration is different from solid particle filtration in that a drainage state appears, characterized by a constant pressure drop at the end of filter clogging. Moreover, during filter clogging, the number efficiency presents a minimum level for particles close to 100 nm in diameter (the most penetrating particle size). The results also reveal that during filter clogging there is a decrease in the medium's performance for particles smaller than 100 nm and an increase in efficiency for particles with a diameter greater than 200 nm. Both effects are induced by the amount of <b>liquid</b> <b>collected</b> in the medium. Finally, a model is proposed to describe filter efficiency during clogging with a liquid aerosol...|$|E
