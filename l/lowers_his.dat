5|$|Springbok mate year-round, though {{females are}} more likely to enter oestrus during the rainy season, when food is more plentiful. Females are able to {{conceive}} at as early as six to seven months, whereas males do not attain sexual maturity until two years; rut lasts 5 to 21 days. When a female approaches a rutting male, the male holds his head and tail at level with the ground, <b>lowers</b> <b>his</b> horns, and makes a loud grunting noise to attract her. The male then urinates and sniffs the female's perineum. If the female is receptive, she urinates, as well, and the male makes a flehmen gesture, and taps his leg till the female leaves or permits him to mate. Copulation consists of a single pelvic thrust.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before {{mating season}} begins, females exhibit {{swelling}} of the sex skin, which reaches its peak around {{the middle of their}} 14.8 day estrous cycle. Male sexual physiology also undergoes its own change, with testicular volume increasing during mating season, peaking around the time of breeding. Aggression also increases during the mating season, both between members of the same sex and by females towards the male attempting to mate with her. Females have been observed grappling, cuffing, and biting the male during copulation. Either sex may approach the other when the female is in estrus. Initially they may roar-shriek with each other. When a male approaches a female he often <b>lowers</b> <b>his</b> head and squeals, inspecting the female's genitalia by licking or sniffing, scent-marking, and offering a submissive chattering vocalization. When a female approaches a male, she may posture herself for mounting. Mating pairs often copulate many times {{during the course of a}} mating bout.|$|E
500|$|In 1972, the Town of Oyster Bay board {{unanimously}} denied LILCO {{a permit}} to further expand the plant with five 50 MW gas turbines, citing air-quality concerns {{and the effects of}} the 1970s energy crisis. [...] Town Supervisor John W. Burke at the time noted the board's recognition that [...] "in view of the fuel shortage, construction of gas turbines just seems {{out of step with the}} direction being taken by the average consumer, who <b>lowers</b> <b>his</b> thermostat and wears a sweater in his home to reduce the amount of fuel burning." ...|$|E

500|$|Apart {{from his}} up-tempo and {{aggressive}} style of play, Ginóbili {{is known for}} his clutch play. This is documented by his numerous European league MVP awards, and his performances in San Antonio's championship-winning campaigns. Ginóbili's modus operandi however, causes concerns for some of his opponents. His go-to move is either a 3-pointer or a fierce attack to the basket, while he often <b>lowers</b> <b>his</b> head when driving to the basket to collapse defenses and create shots or passes to his teammates. [...] Although Ginobili was not the originator or the first to bring the move to the NBA, he is credited for popularizing the Euro step in the league.|$|E
500|$|Castellaneta's normal {{speaking}} voice {{does not}} bear any resemblance to Homer's. To perform Homer's voice, Castellaneta <b>lowers</b> <b>his</b> chin {{to his chest}} and is said to [...] "let his I.Q. go". While in this state, he has ad-libbed several of Homer's least intelligent comments, such as the line [...] "I am so smart, s-m-r-t" [...] from [...] "Homer Goes to College" [...] (season five, 1993) which was a genuine mistake made by Castellaneta during recording. Castellaneta likes to stay in character during recording sessions, and he tries to visualize a scene {{so that he can}} give the proper voice to it. Despite Homer's fame, Castellaneta claims he is rarely recognized in public, [...] "except, maybe, by a die-hard fan".|$|E
500|$|Elsewhere, a {{high-ranking}} assassin, Alan (Tony Leung Chiu-wai), works for Triad boss [...] "Uncle" [...] Hoi (Kwan Hoi-Shan). Alan murders a fellow member of Hoi's gang, {{who had been}} working for Johnny Wong's (Anthony Wong) rival syndicate. Wong is impressed by Alan's skill and attempts to recruit him. Alan reluctantly turns against Hoi when Wong conducts a raid on Hoi's arsenal at a warehouse. At the warehouse, Wong's men kill Hoi's workers and destroy his stock. When Hoi arrives, Wong demands Alan kill Hoi, which he does, {{along with the rest of}} Hoi's men. Just then, smoke grenades explode and Tequila attacks. Alan covers Wong's escape as Tequila battles and kills most of the gangsters. In the end, Tequila finds himself confronting Alan face to face in the smoke, with guns to each other's heads. Tequila tries to shoot Alan, but finds he is out of ammo. Although he has a chance to kill Tequila, Alan slowly <b>lowers</b> <b>his</b> gun and walks away.|$|E

500|$|Kershaw's {{pitching}} style {{relies on}} deception, movement and changes of velocity. He keeps the ball hidden {{so that it}} is hard for the batter to pick up the ball and has a consistent overhand delivery on all of his pitches, he also consistently lands low on the strikezone below the catcher's knees, causing batters to chase the ball even when the ball is clearly going to hit the dirt. Out of the windup, Kershaw <b>lowers</b> <b>his</b> right foot vertically with a slight pause before moving it forward toward the plate. The motion was described during the 2015 National League Division Series as a [...] "kickstand move" [...] drawing comparison with one setting a kickstand on a bicycle. Out of the stretch, he uses a slide step as it makes it difficult for the base runner at first base to get a read on him. He has stated many times that he has modeled his pitching mechanics after his favorite pitcher growing up, Roger Clemens.|$|E
500|$|Castellaneta is {{most famous}} {{for his role as}} Homer Simpson on the longest running {{animated}} television show The Simpsons. The Tracey Ullman Show included a series of animated shorts about a dysfunctional family. Voices were needed for the shorts, so the producers decided to ask Castellaneta and fellow cast member Julie Kavner to voice Homer and Marge Simpson rather than hire more actors. Homer's voice began as a loose impression of Walter Matthau, but Castellaneta could not [...] "get enough power behind that voice" [...] and could not sustain his Matthau impression for the nine- to ten-hour long recording sessions. He tried to find something easier, so he [...] "dropped the voice down", and developed it into a more versatile and humorous voice during the second and third season of the half-hour show. Castellaneta's normal speaking voice has no similarity to Homer's. To perform Homer's voice, Castellaneta <b>lowers</b> <b>his</b> chin to his chest, and is said to [...] "let his IQ go." [...] Castellaneta likes to stay in character during recording sessions, and tries to visualize a scene in his mind so that he can give the proper voice to it. Despite Homer's fame, Castellaneta claims he is rarely recognized in public, [...] "except, maybe, by a die-hard fan." ...|$|E
2500|$|Continuing his {{commentary}} on government indifference toward AIDS, Kramer wrote Just Say No, A Play about a Farce in 1988. [...] He highlights the sexual hypocrisy in the Reagan and Koch administrations that allowed AIDS {{to become an}} epidemic; it concerns a First Lady, her gay son, and the closeted gay mayor of America's [...] "largest northeastern city". Its New York production, starring Kathleen Chalfant, Tonya Pinkens, and David Margulies, was prized by the few who came to see it after its negative review by The New York Times. Social critic and writer Susan Sontag wrote of the piece, [...] "Larry Kramer is one of America's most valuable troublemakers. I hope he never <b>lowers</b> <b>his</b> voice." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bourne {{arrives at}} a {{hospital}} at 415 East 71st Street, having figured out Landy's coded message. Outside, Bourne meets Landy and gives her the Blackbriar files before going inside. Vosen also figures out Landy's code and warns Dr. Albert Hirsch (Albert Finney), who ran Treadstone's behavior modification program, that Bourne is coming. He follows Landy inside the building but {{is too late to}} stop her from faxing the Blackbriar documents out. Meanwhile, Hirsch is confronted by Bourne on an upper floor, who now remembers that he volunteered for Treadstone. As Bourne flees to the roof, he is confronted by Paz, who asks, [...] "Why didn't you take the shot?" [...] Bourne repeats the dying words of The Professor in The Bourne Identity: [...] "Look at us. Look at what they make you give." [...] Paz <b>lowers</b> <b>his</b> gun, but Vosen appears and shoots at Bourne as he jumps into the East River.|$|E
2500|$|Near the conclusion, Draco ambushes and disarms a gravely {{weakened}} Dumbledore at the Astronomy Tower. After Draco disarms him, Dumbledore calmly reasons {{with the}} frightened teenager and persuades him to reveal how he was, according to Voldemort's orders, {{to kill the}} headmaster through the cursed necklace and the poisoned mead. Malfoy reveals that he mended the broken Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirement {{to act as a}} portal enabling Death Eaters to enter Hogwarts. Draco is hesitant to kill Dumbledore and he eventually <b>lowers</b> <b>his</b> wand. Snape arrives, dispatches Dumbledore himself and then flees Hogwarts with Draco in tow. As revealed during his confrontation with Dumbledore, Draco was an insecure boy incapable of committing cold-blooded murder and was forced to do Voldemort's bidding under the threat of his and his parents' deaths. Harry, who was horrified by the result of his duel with Draco in the bathroom incident, feels [...] "the tiniest drop of pity mingled with his dislike" [...] for his old rival.|$|E
2500|$|Urine {{spraying}} is {{a variable}} behaviour. It may consist of simply dribbling {{a few drops}} of urine, or, large rhythmic discharges from an erect penis. [...] A stream may be aimed at the mane on the neck, or, a fine mist might be [...] sprayed against the stomach. The bull usually rub/palpates during this process. The urine can be voided almost at right angles to the erect penis. When a large volume of urine is sprayed, it usually takes place at a wallow. [...] When urine spraying, the bull <b>lowers</b> <b>his</b> head towards the ground. [...] In this position, his mane becomes soaked as he sprays urine forwards, between his legs. Once the wallow has been created, the male elk lowers himself into the area, rolls on his side and rub his mane on the soaked area of the wallow. He rubs the side of his face, his chest, stomach, legs, and flanks, which all become caked with mud. During wallowing, the elk's penis may remain erect and he may continue to spray urine.|$|E

2500|$|To make up {{for this}} disparity, the NKVD worked prisoners harder than ever. To meet rising demand, prisoners worked longer and longer hours, and on lower food-rations than ever before. A camp {{administrator}} said in a meeting: [...] "There are cases when a prisoner is given only {{four or five hours}} out of twenty-four for rest, which significantly <b>lowers</b> <b>his</b> productivity." [...] In the words of a former Gulag prisoner: [...] "By the spring of 1942, the camp ceased to function. It was difficult to find people who were even able to gather firewood or bury the dead." [...] The scarcity of food stemmed in part from the general strain on the entire Soviet Union, but also lack of central aid to the Gulag during the war. The central government focused all its attention on the military, and left the camps to their own devices. In 1942 the Gulag set up the Supply Administration to find their own food and industrial goods. During this time, not only did food become scarce, but the NKVD limited rations in an attempt to motivate the prisoners to work harder for more food, a policy that lasted until 1948.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the third}} day of the chase, Ahab sights Moby Dick at noon, and sharks appear, as well. Ahab <b>lowers</b> <b>his</b> boat for a final time, leaving Starbuck again on board. Moby Dick {{breaches}} and destroys two boats. Fedallah's corpse, still entangled in the fouled lines, is lashed to the whale's back, so Moby Dick {{turns out to be the}} hearse Fedallah prophesied. [...] "Possessed by all the fallen angels", Ahab plants his harpoon in the whale's flank. Moby Dick smites the whaleboat, tossing its men into the sea. Only Ishmael is unable to return to the boat. He is left behind in the sea, and so is the only crewman of the Pequod to survive the final encounter. The whale now fatally attacks the Pequod. Ahab then realizes that the destroyed ship is the hearse made of American wood in Fedallah's prophesy. The whale returns to Ahab, who stabs at him again. The line loops around Ahab's neck, and as the stricken whale swims away, the captain is drawn with him out of sight. Queequeg's coffin comes to the surface, the only thing to escape the vortex when Pequod sank. For an entire day, Ishmael floats on it, and then the Rachel, still looking for its lost seamen, rescues him.|$|E
2500|$|In 219, Lü Meng {{came up with}} a plan to help Sun Quan seize {{control of}} Liu Bei's territories in Jing Province. He pretended to be sick and asked for {{permission}} to return to Jianye to seek medical treatment. Sun Quan played along by pretending to approve his request. Lu Xun went to visit Lü Meng and said, [...] "Guan Yu is near the border. How can we remain far behind the border and not worry about having to guard against him?" [...] Lü Meng replied, [...] "What you've said is true, but I'm seriously ill now." [...] Lu Xun then said, [...] "Guan Yu is proud of his own valour and he scorns others. He may have made great achievements, but he's overly conceited. Besides, he's heading north and he has never seen us a threat. When he knows you're sick, he'll definitely lower his defences. If we attack him when he <b>lowers</b> <b>his</b> guard, we can capture him. I came here to discuss with you a plan to attack him." [...] Lü Meng replied, [...] "Guan Yu is known for his bravery and ferocity in battle, and he's a formidable foe. Besides, he's in control of Jing Province. He governs with virtue and has made great accomplishments, while the morale of his army is at its peak. It won't be easy to defeat him." ...|$|E
