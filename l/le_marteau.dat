25|$|Boulez's first {{recordings}} {{date from}} {{his time with}} the Domaine Musical in the late 1950s and early 1960s and were made for the French Vega label. They document his first thoughts on works which he would subsequently re-record (such as Varèse's Intégrales and Schoenberg's Chamber Symphony No.1), as well as pieces to {{which he did not}} return in the studio (such as Stravinsky's Renard and Stockhausen's Zeitmaße). They also include two of his five recordings of <b>Le</b> <b>Marteau</b> sans maître (with contraltos Marie-Thérèse Cahn in 1956 and Jeanne Deroubaix in 1964). In 2015 Universal Music brought together the recordings from this period in a 10-CD set.|$|E
25|$|Born in Montbrison in the Loire {{department}} of France, {{the son of}} an engineer, Boulez studied at the Conservatoire de Paris with Olivier Messiaen, and privately with Andrée Vaurabourg and René Leibowitz. He began his professional career in the late 1940s as Music Director of the Renaud-Barrault theatre company in Paris. As a young composer in the 1950s he quickly became a leading figure in avant-garde music, playing {{an important role in the}} development of integral serialism and controlled chance music. From the 1970s onwards he pioneered the electronic transformation of instrumental music in real time. His tendency to revise earlier compositions meant that his body of completed works was relatively small, but it included pieces regarded by many as landmarks of twentieth-century music, such as <b>Le</b> <b>Marteau</b> sans maître, Pli selon pli and Répons. His commitment to the modernist project and the trenchant, polemical tone in which he expressed his views on music led some to criticise him as a dogmatist, a reputation which softened in later years.|$|E
25|$|Between 1966 and 1989 he {{recorded}} for Columbia Records (later Sony Classical). Among the first projects were the Paris Wozzeck (with Walter Berry) and the Covent Garden Pelléas et Mélisande (with George Shirley and Elisabeth Söderström). He made a highly praised recording of Le Sacre du printemps with the Cleveland Orchestra {{and a number}} of recordings with the London Symphony Orchestra, including rarities such as Berlioz's Lélio and the first complete recording of Mahler's Das klagende Lied. The LSO also contributed to the Webern edition which Boulez supervised, consisting of all the works with opus numbers. When he took up his posts with the New York Philharmonic and BBC Symphony Orchestras, and later the Ensemble Intercontemporain, he made most of his recordings with them. A particular focus of the Columbia years was a wide-ranging survey of the music of Schoenberg, including Gurrelieder, Moses und Aron, Erwartung and Pierrot lunaire, but also less well-known works such as Die Jakobsleiter and the unaccompanied choral music. As for Boulez's own music, there were two further recordings of <b>Le</b> <b>Marteau</b> sans maître (with Yvonne Minton in 1972 and Elisabeth Laurence in 1985), a first recording of Pli selon pli (with Halina Łukomska as soprano soloist) and recordings of Rituel and Éclat/Multiples. In 2014 Sony Classical issued Pierre Boulez—The Complete Columbia Album Collection on 67 CDs.|$|E

500|$|The {{two sides}} to Poulenc's musical nature caused {{misunderstanding}} during his life and have continued to do so. The composer Ned Rorem observed, [...] "He was deeply devout and uncontrollably sensual"; this still leads some critics to underrate his seriousness. His uncompromising adherence to melody, both in his lighter and serious works, has similarly caused some to regard him as unprogressive. Although he was not much influenced by new developments in music, Poulenc was always keenly interested {{in the works of}} younger generations of composers. Lennox Berkeley recalled, [...] "Unlike some artists, he was genuinely interested in other people's work, and surprisingly appreciative of music very far removed from his. I remember him playing me the records of Boulez's <b>Le</b> <b>marteau</b> sans maître with which he was already familiar when that work was much less well-known than it is today." [...] Boulez did not take a reciprocal view, remarking in 2010, [...] "There are always people who will take an easy intellectual path. Poulenc coming after Sacre [...] It was not progress." [...] Other composers have found more merit in Poulenc's work; Stravinsky wrote to him in 1931: [...] "You are truly good, and that is what I find again and again in your music".|$|E

In the late 20th century, modernist and contemporary composers found new ways to use marimba: notable examples include Leoš Janáček (Jenufa), Carl Orff (Antigonae), Karl Amadeus Hartmann, Hans Werner Henze (Elegy for Young Lovers), Pierre Boulez (<b>Le</b> <b>marteau</b> sans maître) and Steve Reich.|$|E

50|$|Bessière {{also made}} his mark on French science fiction {{through a number of}} non-connected novels that {{featured}} an original blend of horror and science fiction. Monstrous aliens threatening to take over mankind were featured in Escale chez les Vivants Among The Living (1960); evil entities from beyond human ken whose only weakness was sound invaded Earth in Les Maîtres du Silence Masters Of Silence (1965); Cette Lueur Qui Venait Des Ténèbres Light Which Came From The Dark (1967) featured ghastly body-snatching parasites. The ultimately doomed reconquest of a post-cataclysmic Earth ruled by mutants and deadly lifeforms, was the subject of Légion Alpha (1961), Les Sept Anneaux de Rhéa Seven Rings Of Rhea (1962), in which Earth was described as seven concentric spheres with Hell at its core, and Les Jardins de l’Apocalypse Gardens Of The Apocalypse (1963). <b>Les</b> <b>Marteaux</b> de Vulcain Hammers Of Vulcan (1969) described a nightmarish planet where survival was all but impossible.|$|R
2500|$|At the ISCM Festival in Baden-Baden on 18 June 1955, after fifty rehearsals, Hans Rosbaud {{conducted}} the first performance of Boulez's best-known work, <b>Le</b> <b>Marteau</b> sans maître. A nine-movement cycle for alto voice and instrumental ensemble based on poems by René Char, {{it was an}} immediate, international success. William Glock wrote: [...] "even at a first hearing, though difficult to take in, it was so utterly new in sound, texture and feeling {{that it seemed to}} possess a mythical quality like that of Schoenberg's Pierrot lunaire." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some music {{theorists have}} criticized {{serialism}} {{on the basis}} that the compositional strategies employed are often incompatible with the way information is extracted by the human mind from a piece of music. Nicolas Ruwet (1959) {{was one of the first}} to criticise serialism through a comparison with linguistic structures, citing theoretical claims by Boulez and Henri Pousseur, and taking as specific examples bars from Stockhausen's Klavierstücke I & II, and calling for a general re-examination of Webern's music. Ruwet specifically names three works as exempt from his criticism: Stockhausen's Zeitmaße and Gruppen, and Boulez's <b>Le</b> <b>marteau</b> sans maître [...]|$|E
2500|$|Boulez's strongest {{achievement}} in {{this method is}} <b>Le</b> <b>Marteau</b> sans maître (The Hammer without a Master, 1953–55), a [...] "keystone of 20th-century music". Three short poems by René Char form the starting-point for three interlocking cycles. Four movements are vocal settings of the poems (Bel Édifice et les pressentiments is set twice), the other five are instrumental commentaries. According to Hopkins and Griffiths the music is characterised by abrupt tempo transitions, passages of broadly improvisatory melodic style and exotic instrumental colouring. The piece is scored for contralto soloist with alto flute, xylorimba, vibraphone, percussion, guitar and viola. Boulez said that the choice of these instruments showed the influence of non-European cultures, {{to which he had}} always been attracted.|$|E
2500|$|Later {{writers have}} {{continued}} both lines of reasoning. Fred Lerdahl, for example, outlines Ruwet's subject further {{in his essay}} [...] "Cognitive Constraints on Compositional Systems" [...] Lehrdahl has in turn been criticized for excluding [...] "the possibility of other, non-hierarchical methods of achieving musical coherence," [...] and for concentrating on the audibility of tone rows , and the portion of his essay focussing on Boulez's [...] "multiplication" [...] technique (exemplified in three movements of <b>Le</b> <b>Marteau</b> sans maître) has been challenged on perceptual grounds by Stephen Heinemann (1998) and Ulrich [...] Ruwet's critique has also been criticised for making [...] "the fatal mistake of equating visual presentation (a score) with auditive presentation (the music as heard)" [...]|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} years of the Domaine Musical Boulez left most of the {{conducting}} to others, including Hermann Scherchen and Hans Rosbaud. On 21 March 1956 he gave his first full concert as a conductor in a Domaine programme which featured the French première of <b>Le</b> <b>marteau</b> sans maître. When he conducted the work in Los Angeles in early 1957, Stravinsky—who described it as [...] "one of the few significant works of the post-war period of exploration"—attended the performance. Boulez dined several times with the Stravinskys and (according to Robert Craft) [...] "soon captivated the older composer with new musical ideas, and an extraordinary intelligence, quickness and humour". Relations soured somewhat the following year over the first Paris performance of Stravinsky's Threni for the Domaine Musical. Poorly planned by Boulez and nervously conducted by Stravinsky, the performance broke down more than once. According to Glock, who sat between Stravinsky and Boulez at dinner afterwards, [...] "the atmosphere was electric with discontent." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bois {{has shown}} a special {{interest}} in composing for the recorder, an instrument with which he became acquainted initially from the Dutch virtuoso Frans Brüggen, for whom he wrote his first recorder piece, Muziek voor altblokfluit, in 1961. Muziek is clearly influenced by Berio’s flute Sequenza (1958), but also by the supple lyricism found in Boulez's <b>Le</b> <b>marteau</b> sans maître [...] This piece, based on successive transformations of a twelve-tone row, requires a level of skill that was unprecedented at the time: it employs the full chromatic range of the instrument, featuring extremes of range, rapid, difficult fingerings in complex rhythms, large dynamic changes and a modest range of extended techniques: fluttertonguing, glissando, and finger vibrato ( [...] ; [...] ). Initially received even by professional players with dismay over its [...] "unjustifiably" [...] tricky rhythms, as well as its [...] "unintelligible" [...] formal design ( [...] ; [...] ), Muziek has come to be {{regarded as one of the}} best avant-garde works of the 1960s for the instrument , and is considered a central work in the recorder’s 20th-century repertoire, whose technical extravagances have become [...] "a necessary part of the training of every conservatory student" [...]|$|E
2500|$|From 1991 onwards Boulez {{recorded}} {{under an}} exclusive contract with Deutsche Grammophon. It centred on the orchestras of Chicago and Cleveland in the United States and Vienna and Berlin in Europe. He re-recorded {{much of his}} core repertoire—the orchestral music of Debussy, Ravel, Stravinsky and Bartók—and oversaw a second Webern edition, extending this time to the unpublished works. His own late music featured prominently, including Répons, ...explosante-fixe... and sur Incises. There was a fifth recording of <b>Le</b> <b>Marteau</b> sans maître (with Hilary Summers in 2002) {{and a third of}} Pli selon pli (with Christine Schäfer) in its definitive version, incorporating revisions made in the late 1980s. Composers new to his discography included Richard Strauss, Szymanowski and Anton Bruckner—his recording of the Eighth Symphony met with particular acclaim. The most significant addition to his recorded repertoire was the multi-orchestra cycle of the Mahler symphonies and vocal works with orchestra. It began with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra in a 1994 studio recording of the Sixth Symphony and ended with the same orchestra in a live recording from the 2011 Salzburg Festival of Das klagende Lied (this time omitting Waldmärchen). Coupled with Berg's Lulu-Suite, it was his final recording.|$|E
2500|$|In response, [...] {{questioned}} the equivalence made by Ruwet between phoneme {{and the single}} note. He also suggested that, if analysis of <b>Le</b> <b>marteau</b> sans maître [...] and Zeitmaße, [...] "performed with sufficient insight", were to be made {{from the point of}} view of wave theory—taking into account the dynamic interaction of the different component phenomena, which creates [...] "waves" [...] that interact in a sort of frequency modulation—this analysis [...] "would accurately reflect the realities of perception". This was because these composers had long since acknowledged the lack of differentiation found in punctual music and, becoming increasingly aware of the laws of perception and complying [...] better with them, [...] "paved the way to a more effective kind of musical communication, without in the least abandoning the emancipation that they had been allowed to achieve by this 'zero state' that was punctual music". This was achieved, amongst other things, by the development of the concept of [...] "groups", which allows structural relationships to be defined not only between individual notes but also at higher and higher levels, up to the overall form of a piece. This is [...] "a structural method par excellence", and a sufficiently simple conception that it remains easily perceptible [...] Pousseur also points out that serial composers were the first to recognize and attempt to move beyond the lack of differentiation within certain pointillist works [...] Pousseur later followed up his own suggestion, by developing his idea of [...] "wave" [...] analysis and applying it to Stockhausen's Zeitmaße in two essays, [...] and [...]|$|E

5000|$|Writing some 40 {{years since}} <b>Le</b> <b>marteau</b> first appeared, {{composer}} and music psychologist Fred Lerdahl observed, [...] "For one thing, competent listeners to <b>Le</b> <b>Marteau,</b> even after many hearings, still cannot {{even begin to}} hear its serial organization." [...] Lerdahl sees <b>Le</b> <b>marteau</b> as sharing a characteristic with much other contemporary music that “pursues complicatedness as compensation {{for a lack of}} complexity.” In other words, music that is obscure and impenetrable to listeners is not necessarily guaranteed to be significant or profound. Roger Scruton finds Boulez’s preoccupation with timbre and sonority in the instrumental writing has the effect of preventing “simultaneities from coalescing as chords" [...] As a result, Scruton says that, especially where pitches are concerned, <b>Le</b> <b>marteau</b> [...] "contains no recognizable material - no units of significance that can live outside the work that produces them" [...] Scruton also feels that the involved overlapping metres notated in the score beg [...] "a real question as to whether we hear the result as a rhythm at all" [...] Richard Taruskin found [...] "Le Marteau exemplified the lack of concern on the part of modernist composers for the comprehensibility of their music" [...] Equally bluntly, Christopher Small, writing in 1987 said “It is not possible to invoke any ‘inevitable time lag’ which is supposed to be required for the assimilation of …such critically acclaimed works as… <b>Le</b> <b>marteau</b> sans maître… Those who champion 'the new music' await its assimilation into the repertory much as the early Christians awaited the Second Coming" [...]|$|E
