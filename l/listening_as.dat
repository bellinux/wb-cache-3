5|$|Suzanne Jones sees a {{substantive}} difference between active <b>listening</b> <b>as</b> originated by Gordon and empathic <b>listening</b> <b>as</b> recommended by Rosenberg, insofar as active listening involves a specific step of reflecting what a speaker said {{to let them}} know you are listening, whereas empathic listening involves an ongoing process of listening with both heart and mind and being fully present to the other's experience, with an aim of comprehending and empathizing with the needs of the other, the meaning of the experience for that person.|$|E

Times and radio frequencies of the news from Rome, Berlin and Tokyo were published daily on the radio page of The New York Times. Others were dedicated shortwave listeners or DXers who maintained an ongoing interest in long-distance radio <b>listening</b> <b>as</b> a hobby. Still others were licensed amateur radio operators who were, as a group, banned from transmitting due to wartime restrictions, but often kept their listening gear in operation.|$|E

25|$|Stories are {{effective}} educational tools because listeners become engaged and therefore remember. Storytelling {{can be seen}} as a foundation for learning and teaching. While the storylistener is engaged, they are able to imagine new perspectives, inviting a transformative and empathetic experience. This involves allowing the individual to actively engage in the story as well as observe, listen and participate with minimal guidance. Listening to a storyteller can create lasting personal connections, promote innovative problem solving and foster a shared understanding regarding future ambitions. The listener can then activate knowledge and imagine new possibilities. Together a storyteller and listener can seek best practices and invent new solutions. Because stories often have multiple layers of meanings, listeners have to listen closely to identify the underlying knowledge in the story. Storytelling is used as a tool to teach children the importance of respect through the practice of <b>listening.</b> <b>As</b> well as connecting children with their environment, through the theme of the stories, and give them more autonomy by using repetitive statements, which improve their learning to learn competence. It is also used to teach children to have respect for all life, value inter-connectedness and always work to overcome adversity. To teach this a Kinesthetic learningstyle would be used, involving the listeners through music, dream interpretation, or dance.|$|E
500|$|A {{minority}} of apparently more discerning listeners felt that Connotations {{was the right}} music for its time and place. Composer Arthur Berger states, [...] "I think [...] wrote exactly the piece he wanted to write {{because he wanted to}} make a statement about the new Philharmonic Hall in New York—it wasn't going to be a temple of easy <b>listening,</b> <b>as</b> it were, but a place for serious music-making." [...] Minna Lederman Daniel, a music writer and editor of Modern Music magazine, told Copland, [...] "I think Connotations was the right place for the people and the occasion—indeed the only one properly related to them. It sounds a good deal like certain aspects of the building—big, spacious, clear, long-lined, and it sounds very like you... To those familiar with your music, the characteristic, identifying moods are perfectly apparent. The special Copland eloquence is there." ...|$|E
500|$|Collins {{described}} the album {{as not being}} as easy <b>listening</b> <b>as</b> their previous work, and that it contained numerous experiments in songwriting {{that they had not}} put into previous albums. Fanning later said Internationalist was [...] "a better record" [...] than Double Allergic, but acknowledged that it was not as easily likeable—it was just an improvement in songwriting. Collins and Fanning acknowledged that the album's experimental nature could lose them some old fans, but the pair drew parallels with bands such as U2, who Collins said had [...] "constantly re-invented themselves, and with success". He said Powderfinger's reinvention was as much for the band's own interest as it was for the [...] "public's perception". Meanwhile, guitarist Ian Haug {{described the}} album as a [...] "moderation" [...] between Parables for Wooden Ears ("the complicated beast") and Double Allergic ("totally simplified"), Powderfinger's two previous albums. He also agreed that the album was much more experimental, and described the album as the band's [...] "most successful", as well as stating that the album that best replicated [...] "the sound we have live".|$|E

500|$|Fierstein and Lauper {{had both}} gained {{previous}} critical acclaim and honors {{in their respective}} fields. Fierstein had won four Tonys: acting and writing awards for Torch Song Trilogy, an acting Tony for Hairspray, and one for writing the book of La Cage; Lauper is a chart-topping singer-songwriter and actress who had won Grammy, Emmy and many other awards for her songs and performances. Fierstein noted a change in focus between the film [...] "about the saving of a factory" [...] and the musical, which include [...] "drag queens singing as they pass along the assembly line." [...] He said the main {{difference is that the}} musical is, [...] "at its core, about two young men who come from seemingly opposite worlds who figure out that they have a lot in common, beginning with the need to stand up to their dads." [...] Lauper's inspirations ranged from <b>listening</b> <b>as</b> a child to her parents' recordings of South Pacific and West Side Story, as well as musical inspirations as diverse as Aaron Copland's [...] "Appalachian Spring" [...] and pop singer Lana Del Rey. In a broadcast interview with Patrick Healy of The New York Times, Lauper and Fierstein said that, in adapting the film, they stressed themes of community and the universality of the father-son bond as vehicles to explore the issues of tolerance and self-acceptance.|$|E
2500|$|The album's first single, [...] "This Addiction", {{was made}} {{available}} for <b>listening</b> <b>as</b> streaming audio through a dedicated website on January 5, 2010, using a marketing technique in which listeners were required to post an advertisement about the album to Facebook or Twitter in order to access the song. It became available as a download through digital retailers on January 12, and was released as a 7" [...] single exclusively at Hot Topic stores on February 9. [...] "This Addition" [...] impacted radio on February 2. The song's music video premiered February 8. Alkaline Trio toured with Cursive {{in support of the}} album.

This Addiction was released February 22, 2010 in the United Kingdom through Heart & Skull and Hassle Records, and the following day in North America through Heart & Skull and Epitaph Records. It was released in several versions, including a standard eleven-track compact disc and digital download, a limited Deluxe Edition with six bonus tracks and a full-length concert DVD recorded at the House of Blues in Las Vegas, Nevada in 2008, and a gatefold LP.

2500|$|President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, {{which took}} effect on January 1, 1863, {{declared}} {{the freedom of}} all slaves in Confederate-held territory. (Slaves in Union-held areas and Northern states were freed with {{the adoption of the}} 13th Amendment on December 6, 1865.) Douglass described the spirit of those awaiting the proclamation: [...] "We were waiting and <b>listening</b> <b>as</b> for a bolt from the sky ... we were watching ... by the dim light of the stars for the dawn of a new day ... we were longing for the answer to the agonizing prayers of centuries." ...|$|E

2500|$|AT was {{involved}} {{mainly in the}} telephone business and, {{although it was a}} partner with RCA, was reluctant to see radio grow because such growth might diminish the demand for wired services. It established station WEAF in New York as what was termed a toll station. AT could provide no programming, but anyone who wished to broadcast a message could pay a [...] "toll" [...] to AT and then air the message publicly. The original studio {{was the size of a}} telephone booth. The idea, however, did not take hold, because people would pay to broadcast messages only if they were sure that someone was <b>listening.</b> <b>As</b> a result, WEAF began broadcasting entertainment material, drawing amateur talent found among its employees. Opposition to AT's expansion into radio and an agreement with the National Broadcasting Company to lease long distance lines for their broadcasts resulted in the sale of the station and its developing network of affiliates to NBC.|$|E

2500|$|Rosen {{suggested}} they hire [...] "perhaps {{the best known}} (and most feared) litigation lawyer in Hollywood", Patty Glaser, to help grasp the situation. Following discussions on Leno's contract during a post-show conference, Glaser {{turned her attention to}} O'Brien for his opinion. He expressed his desire to write a statement expressing his feelings on the matter, and after hearing what he would possibly say in such a statement, Glaser agreed to the idea, although Ross was initially reluctant. O'Brien went without sleep that night, crafting his statement obsessively. He returned to the studio the following morning, <b>listening</b> <b>as</b> the lawyers and Glaser read over the statement (it remained largely unchanged before publication). According to The War for Late Night, Glaser found [...] "the statement as ideal for their purposes. It laid out Conan’s point of view unequivocally, but without compromising his legal options. Nothing in there overtly said he was quitting, so he could not be accused of forsaking his contractual obligations." ...|$|E
2500|$|Among the {{distinct}} {{elements of the}} Beach Boys' style were their voices' nasal quality {{and the use of}} falsetto in their harmonies over a run-on melody. Jim Miller observed, [...] "On straight rockers they [...] sang tight harmonies behind Love's lead [...] … on ballads, Brian played his falsetto off against lush, jazz-tinged voicings, often using (for rock) unorthodox harmonic structures." [...] Music theorist Daniel Harrison adds, [...] "But even the least distinguished of the Beach Boys' early uptempo rock 'n' roll songs show traces of structural complexity at some level; Brian was simply too curious and experimental to leave convention alone." [...] Lyric collaborator Van Dyke Parks argued that, [...] "Wilson made music as accessible as a cartoon and yet rewarded repeated <b>listening</b> <b>as</b> much as Bach: Just as the best comic books can turn cliché into high art, so can the best pop music. Brian does that. He can take common or hackneyed material and raise it from a low place to the highest, and he can do it with an economy of imagery that speaks to the casual observer—bam! It's no coincidence that he was working {{at the same time that}} [...] Warhol and [...] Lichtenstein were doing pop art." [...] Wilson wrote in 1990: ...|$|E
