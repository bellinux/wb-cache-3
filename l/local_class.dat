25|$|For <b>local</b> <b>class</b> field theory, {{it is also}} {{possible}} to construct abelian extensions more explicitly using Lubin–Tate formal group laws. For global fields, the abelian extensions can be constructed explicitly in some cases: for example, the abelian extensions of the rationals can be constructed using roots of unity, and the abelian extensions of quadratic imaginary fields can be constructed using elliptic functions, but finding an analog of this for arbitrary global fields is an unsolved problem.|$|E
25|$|The Brauer groups H2(E/*) {{of a class}} {{formation}} {{are defined}} to be the direct limit of the groups H2(E/F) as F runs over all open subgroups of E. An easy consequence of the vanishing of H1 for all layers is that the groups H2(E/F) are all subgroups of the Brauer group. In <b>local</b> <b>class</b> field theory the Brauer groups {{are the same as}} Brauer groups of fields, but in global class field theory the Brauer group of the formation is not the Brauer group of the corresponding global field (though they are related).|$|E
25|$|A prototypical question, posed at {{a global}} level, is whether some {{polynomial}} equation has a solution in F. If {{this is the}} case, this solution is also a solution in all completions. The local-global principle or Hasse principle asserts that for quadratic equations, the converse holds, as well. Thereby, checking whether such an equation has a solution can be done on all the completions of F, which is often easier, since analytic methods (classical analytic tools such as intermediate value theorem at the archimedean places and p-adic analysis at the nonarchimedean places) can be used. This implication does not hold, however, for more general types of equations. However, the idea of passing from local data to global ones proves fruitful in class field theory, for example, where <b>local</b> <b>class</b> field theory is used to obtain global insights mentioned above. This is also related {{to the fact that}} the Galois groups of the completions Fv can be explicitly determined, whereas the Galois groups of global fields, even of Q are far less understood.|$|E

The evaluation was carried out in Central Mexico using three maps of <b>local</b> soil <b>classes</b> with contrasting landscape and climatic conditions (desert, temperate, and tropical). In the three areas the precision (56 %) of the CAC maps based on elevation as topographical feature was higher than when based on slope, aspect and profile curvature.

The structure of one SINode {{and the process of}} query reformulation is {{based on the idea that}} an SINode in Sewasie is considered as a data integration system frame-work with a global schema with key and foreign key constraints. Queries are posed in terms of the global schema, in particular as unions of conjunctive queries. Query processing is consti-tuted by several steps. The first step is realized through an algorithm for expanding the query according the integrity con-straints in the global schema. The second step materializes the global classes that are relevant for the query, based on the data stored in the <b>local</b> <b>classes.</b> The third step materializes the corresponding <b>local</b> <b>classes,</b> by accessing the relevant external sources. Finally, the fourth step evaluates the expanded query over the materialized global classes...|$|R
