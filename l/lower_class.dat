5|$|There is {{difficulty}} in labeling the trobairitz as either amateurs or professionals. The distinction {{between these two}} roles was complicated in the medieval era, since professionals were generally <b>lower</b> <b>class,</b> and amateurs had {{as much time as}} professionals to devote to their craft. Joglaresse were <b>lower</b> <b>class,</b> professional composers far less respected than the trobairitz.|$|E

5|$|Panggilan Darah debuted at the Orion Theatre in Batavia on 30 June 1941. It was {{reported}} as a modest success, making {{most of its}} money from <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> audiences. It was screened in Surabaya, East Java, by August, and by September it had been shown in Singapore, then part of British Malaya. A novelisation by Roestam Sutan Palindih was published by the Yogyakarta-based Kolff-Buning Publishers that year.|$|E
5|$|By {{the reign}} of George I, the May Fair had fallen into disrepute and was {{regarded}} as a public scandal. The 6th Earl of Coventry, who lived on Piccadilly, considered the fair to be a nuisance and led a public campaign against it along with local residents. It was abolished in 1764. One of the reasons for Mayfair's subsequent boom in property development was to keep out <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> activities.|$|E
5|$|Various {{scenes in}} the series also show {{existing}} tension between {{the upper and lower}} classes. Anatoray's nobility and military officers generally believe that commoners do not understand their codes of chivalry. On the other hand, the <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> also despise the aristocracy for their monopoly on resources. This tension extends to the accessibility of clean water, which varies in price according to purity grades. In the larger story, the advanced Guild society is portrayed as degenerate and lazy, while the people of Anatoray and Disith are creative and industrious.|$|E

50|$|Many {{members of}} this faction were so {{classified}} because they used {{the backing of the}} aristocracy and the senate to achieve personal goals, not necessarily because they favored the aristocracy over the <b>lower</b> <b>classes.</b> Similarly, the populares did not necessarily champion the <b>lower</b> <b>classes,</b> but often used their support to achieve personal goals.|$|R
50|$|In {{change from}} above, the change usually enters formal speech, not the vernacular. This change usually begins with {{speakers}} in higher social classes and diffuses {{down into the}} <b>lower</b> <b>classes.</b> The upper classes use these new linguistic forms in order to differentiate themselves from the <b>lower</b> <b>classes,</b> while <b>lower</b> <b>classes</b> use these forms in order to sound more formal and similar to the upper class. Change from above is seen in Labov's New York Department Store study exhibiting the social stratification of New York City, where the upper classes reintroduced the word-final pronunciation of /r/ as a prestige form.|$|R

5|$|A {{major feature}} in the early {{development}} of Modern English was the codification of explicit norms for standard usage, and their dissemination through official media such as public education and state sponsored publications. In 1755 Samuel Johnson published his A Dictionary of the English Language which introduced a standard set of spelling conventions and usage norms. In 1828, Noah Webster published the American Dictionary of the English language {{in an effort to}} establish a norm for speaking and writing American English that was independent from the British standard. Within Britain, non-standard or <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> dialect features were increasingly stigmatised, leading to the quick spread of the prestige varieties among the middle classes.|$|E
5|$|Aasiya Noreen {{was born}} and raised in Ittan Wali, a small, rural village in the Sheikhupura District of Punjab, Pakistan, thirty miles outside of Lahore. Christians in the district, and {{elsewhere}} in Pakistan, usually have <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> occupations such as being cleaners and sweepers. Noreen, who is a Roman Catholic, worked as a farmhand in Sheikhupura to support her family. She married Ashiq Masih, a brick laborer who had three children from a previous marriage, and had two more children with him. Noreen and her family were the only Christians in the village. Before her incarceration, she had been repeatedly urged by her fellow workers to convert to Islam.|$|E

Further in the past, another rule stipulated that the <b>lower</b> <b>classed</b> team {{did not need to}} win a tie to advance, a draw being sufficient. This rule was however very unpopular with the stronger clubs and was rescinded after the 1998 final.|$|R
5|$|Class distinction, however, became linked as {{the fashion}} of female homoeroticism passed. Tribades were {{simultaneously}} considered members of the <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> trying to ruin virtuous women, and representatives of an aristocracy corrupt with debauchery. Satirical writers began to suggest that political rivals (or more often, their wives) engaged in tribadism in order to harm their reputations. Queen Anne was rumored to have a passionate relationship with Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, her closest adviser and confidante. When Churchill was ousted as the queen's favorite, she purportedly spread allegations of the queen having affairs with her bedchamberwomen. Marie Antoinette was also the subject of such speculation for some months between 1795 and 1796.|$|E
5|$|Le Père Goriot {{begins in}} June 1819, {{following}} Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo, after the House of Bourbon had been {{restored to the}} throne of France. Tension was mounting between the aristocracy, which had returned with King Louis XVIII, and the bourgeoisie produced by the Industrial Revolution. During this era, France saw a tightening of social structures, with a <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> steeped in overwhelming poverty. By one estimate, almost three-quarters of Parisians {{did not make the}} 500–600 francs a year required for a minimal standard of living. At the same time, this upheaval made possible a social mobility unthinkable during the Ancien Régime of previous centuries. Individuals willing to adapt themselves to the rules of this new society could sometimes ascend into its upper echelons from modest backgrounds, much to the distaste of the established wealthy class.|$|E
5|$|Social {{stratification}} is {{the hierarchical}} arrangement of individuals into social classes, castes, and divisions within a society. Modern Western societies stratification traditionally relates to {{cultural and economic}} classes arranged in three main layers: upper class, middle class, and <b>lower</b> <b>class,</b> but each class may be further subdivided into smaller classes (e.g. occupational). Social stratification is interpreted in radically different ways within sociology. Proponents of structural functionalism suggest that, since the stratification of classes and castes is evident in all societies, hierarchy must be beneficial in stabilizing their existence. Conflict theorists, by contrast, critique the inaccessibility of resources and lack of social mobility in stratified societies.|$|E

5|$|The Anglo-Saxon kingdoms were {{hierarchical}} societies, each {{based on}} ties of allegiance between powerful lords and their immediate followers. At {{the top of}} the social structure was the king, who stood above many of the normal processes of Anglo-Saxon life and whose household had special privileges and protection. Beneath the king were thegns, nobles, the more powerful of which maintained their own courts and were termed ealdormen. The relationship between kings and their nobles was bound up with military symbolism and the ritual exchange of weapons and armour. Freemen, called churls, formed the next level of society, often holding land in their own right or controlling businesses in the towns. Geburs, peasants who worked land belonging to a thegn, formed a <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> still. The very lowest class were slaves, who could be bought and sold and who held only minimal rights.|$|E
5|$|The {{black-and-white}} film starred Rd Soekarno, Oedjang, Boen Sofiati, and Soehaena; it {{also featured}} Ratna Djoewita, Ratnasih, Gamari Fadjar, and Moesa. Oedjang had acted for Union since its first film, Kedok Ketawa (The Laughing Mask; 1940), while Soekarno and Soehaena {{had made their}} debuts in Soeara Berbisa. Sofiati, a stage actress who operated her own troupe, was a newcomer to cinema. This cast was of various socio-economic backgrounds, including noblemen and stage actors. Although Union stated that the film was made along realist lines and aimed at educated viewers, owing to the inclusion of stage actors– people who usually entertained <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> audiences– the Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran suggests that this was untrue.|$|E
5|$|In {{these new}} towns, the {{aristocracy}} was allocated the higher areas, {{where the air}} was cooler and fresher and the views finest. The church was allocated the town centre (Illustration 8), for convenience to all, and to reflect the church's global and central position; round the pairing of cathedral and episcopal Palazzo Vescovile were built the convents. The merchants and storekeepers chose their lots on the planned wider streets leading from the main piazzas. Finally, the poor were allowed to erect their simple brick huts and houses in the areas nobody else wanted. Lawyers, doctors, {{and members of the}} few professions including the more skilled artisans - those who fell between the strictly defined upper and <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> - and were able to afford building plots, often lived {{on the periphery of the}} commercial and upper class residential sectors, but equally often these people just lived in a larger or grander house than their neighbours in the poorer areas. However, many of the skilled artists working on the rebuilding lived as part of the extended households of their patrons. In this way Baroque town planning came to symbolize and reflect political authority, and later its style and philosophy spread as far as Annapolis and Savannah in English America, and most notably Haussmann's 19th century re-designing of Paris. The stage was now set for the explosion of Baroque architecture, which was to predominate in Sicily until the early 19th century.|$|E

5|$|The initial {{shock of}} the Spanish conquest was {{followed}} by decades of heavy exploitation of the indigenous peoples, allies and foes alike. Over the following two hundred years colonial rule gradually imposed Spanish cultural standards on the subjugated peoples. The Spanish reducciones created new nucleated settlements {{laid out in a}} grid pattern in the Spanish style, with a central plaza, a church and the town hall housing the civil government, known as the ayuntamiento. This style of settlement can still be seen in the villages and towns of the area. The civil government was either run directly by the Spanish and their descendents (the criollos) or was tightly controlled by them. The introduction of Catholicism was the main vehicle for cultural change, and resulted in religious syncretism. Old World cultural elements came to be thoroughly adopted by Maya groups, an example being the marimba, a musical instrument of African origin. The greatest change was the sweeping aside of the pre-Columbian economic order and its replacement by European technology and livestock; this included the introduction of iron and steel tools to replace Neolithic tools, and of cattle, pigs and chickens that largely replaced the consumption of game. New crops were also introduced; however, sugarcane and coffee led to plantations that economically exploited native labour. Sixty per cent of the modern population of Guatemala is estimated to be Maya, concentrated in the central and western highlands. The eastern portion of the country was the object of intense Spanish migration and hispanicization. Guatemalan society is divided into a class system largely based on race, with Maya peasants and artisans at the bottom, the mixed-race ladino salaried workers and bureaucrats forming the middle and <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> and above them the creole elite of pure European ancestry. Some indigenous elites such as the Xajil did manage to maintain a level of status into the colonial period; a prominent Kaqchikel noble family, they chronicled the history of their region.|$|E
25|$|Lower-class {{families}} are disproportionately {{made up of}} single mother households. According to Kathryn Edin, {{this is because of}} the lack of incentive to marry other <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> men among <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> women, and the desire to save marriage for more quality prospects. Unlike middle class women, <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> women do not have the same financial and marriage incentives to marry especially in the face of likely divorce. As a result, <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> mothers have less incentive to delay their childbearing to later years. Many of the problems shared by single parents are disproportionately felt by the <b>lower</b> <b>class</b> for these very reasons.|$|E
