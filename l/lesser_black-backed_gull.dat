5|$|As an {{isolated}} island on major migration routes, Lundy has a rich bird life {{and is a}} popular site for birdwatching. Large numbers of black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) nest on the cliffs, as do razorbill (Alca torda), guillemot (Uria aalge), herring gull (Larus argentatus), <b>lesser</b> <b>black-backed</b> <b>gull</b> (Larus fuscus), fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis), shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis), oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus), skylark (Alauda arvensis), meadow pipit (Anthus pratensis), common blackbird (Turdus merula), robin (Erithacus rubecula) and linnet (Carduelis cannabina). There are also smaller populations of peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) and raven (Corvus corax).|$|E
5|$|Aerial predators of the Atlantic puffin {{include the}} {{great black-backed gull}} (Larus marinus), the great skua (Stercorarius skua), and similar-sized species, which can catch a bird in flight, or attack one that is unable to escape fast enough on the ground. On {{detecting}} danger, puffins take off and fly down {{to the safety of}} the sea or retreat into their burrows, but if caught they defend themselves vigorously with beak and sharp claws. When the puffins are wheeling round beside the cliffs it becomes very difficult for a predator to concentrate on a single bird while any individual isolated on the ground is at greater risk. Smaller gull species like the herring gull (L. argentatus) and the <b>lesser</b> <b>black-backed</b> <b>gull</b> are hardly able to bring down a healthy adult puffin. They stride through the colony taking any eggs that have rolled towards burrow entrances or recently hatched chicks that have ventured too far towards the daylight. They will also steal fish from puffins returning to feed their young. Where it nests on the tundra in the far north, the Arctic skua (Stercorarius parasiticus) is a terrestrial predator, but at lower latitudes it is a specialised kleptoparasite, concentrating on auks and other seabirds. It harasses puffins while they are airborne forcing them to drop their catch which it then snatches up.|$|E

Ardea 100 : 113 - 122. We investigated apparent survival (i. e. survival confounded by permanent emigration) {{on the basis}} of a colour-ring programme in which individual <b>Lesser</b> <b>Black-backed</b> <b>Gulls</b> Larus fuscus and Herring Gulls Larus argentatus could be monitored over time. The work was conducted in a large, mixed colony in the western Wadden Sea (Texel), where measures of fecundity were collected simultaneously. In Herring Gulls, we found a mean apparent annual adult survival of 79 % in females and 86 % in males. Additive year effects rather than sex provided highest model support in <b>Lesser</b> <b>Black-backed</b> <b>Gulls,</b> in which apparent survival for both sexes combined varied between 81 % and 100 % (mean approximate to 91 %). Breeding success in <b>Lesser</b> <b>Black-backed</b> <b>Gulls</b> was significantly lower than that of Herring <b>Gulls.</b> <b>Lesser</b> <b>Black-backed</b> <b>Gulls</b> experienced four consecutive breeding seasons with very low fledging rates (2006 - 2009) as a result of cannibalism (60 - 67 % of all hatchlings). Chick predation was generally lower in Herring Gulls. A strong population increase in <b>Lesser</b> <b>Black-backed</b> <b>Gulls</b> coincided with substantial population declines in Herring Gulls in the Wadden Sea in the late 20 st and early 21 st century. In <b>Lesser</b> <b>Black-backed</b> <b>Gulls,</b> apparent survival declined by about 10 % in the last two study years, which could, in combination with the low fecundity, halt the current population increase. We suggest that future work should concentrate on underexplored aspects affecting fecundity and survival such as intermittent breeding and sexual differences in migration, foraging and breeding effort...|$|R

25|$|The {{realm of}} birds is {{particularly}} plentiful. Amrum counts {{among the most}} important hatching areas for seabirds in Germany. It is the only remaining hatching area for the Eurasian curlew in the Wadden Sea, and the main hatching region for the common eider, but also oystercatchers, shelducks, Arctic terns, seagulls like herring gulls, common gull and the <b>lesser</b> <b>black-backed</b> <b>gull</b> as well as many other species use to hatch there on the beach, in between the dunes or at the mud flats. Since the dunes of Amrum are a protected nature reserve, they are the only dunes along the west coast of Schleswig-Holstein where sea gulls and ducks are breeding. In other dune areas of the North Sea coast these birds are usually scared off by tourists. Additionally vast swarms of migratory birds will rest on Amrum during the season, e.g. red knot, brent goose or sanderling, all of whom are able to find sufficient food along the coasts of Amrum. Moreover, a number of songbirds can be found and pheasants which were equally introduced as game are common.|$|E
2500|$|The reserve {{has been}} {{declared}} a Ramsar site and a Special Protection Area (SPA). In summer the salt marsh supports large numbers of breeding birds including black-headed gull, European herring gull, <b>lesser</b> <b>black-backed</b> <b>gull,</b> common tern and common redshank. Skylark, meadow pipit and linnet nest in significant numbers on the grazing marsh. [...] Management of the site involves grazing the salt marsh with cattle to maintain the short sward on which wintering wildfowl (especially Eurasian wigeon and the pink-footed goose) depend. The main area of salt marsh is grazed by approximately 800 cattle from May to October, forming {{one of the largest}} single herds of cattle in the UK. Wildfowling takes place on much of the reserve and improved management has contributed to {{the increase in the number}} of birds visiting the site.

60|$|I {{spent hours}} of rare {{happiness}} at this spot in watching the birds. I {{could not have}} seen and heard them to such advantage if their breeding-place had been shared with other species. Here the herring-gulls had the rock to themselves, and looked their best in their foam-white and pearl-grey plumage and yellow legs and beaks. While I watched them they watched me; not gathered in groups, but singly or in pairs, scattered up and down all over {{the face of the}} precipice above me, perched on ledges and on jutting pieces of rock. Standing motionless thus, beautiful in form and colour, they looked like sculptured figures of gulls, set up on the projections against the rough dark wall of rock, just as sculptured figures of angels and saintly men and women are placed in niches on a cathedral front. At first they appeared quite indifferent to my presence, although in some instances near enough for their yellow irides to be visible. While unalarmed they were very silent, standing in that clear sunshine that gave their whiteness something of a crystalline appearance; or flying to and fro along the face of the cliff, purely for the delight of bathing in the warm lucent air. Gradually a change came over them. One by one those that were on the wing dropped on to some projection, until they had all settled down, and, letting my eyes range up and down over the huge wall of rock, it was plain to see that all the birds were watching me. They had made the discovery that I was a stranger. In my rough old travel-stained clothes and tweed hat I might have passed for a Branscombe villager, but I did no hoeing and digging in one of the cultivated patches; and when I deliberately sat down on a rock to watch them, they noticed it and became suspicious; and as time went on and I still remained immovable, with my eyes fixed on them, the suspicion and anxiety increased and turned to fear; and those that were sitting on their nests got up and came close {{to the edge of the}} rock, to gaze with the others and join in the loud chorus of alarm. It was a wonderful sound. Not like the tempest of noise that may be heard at the breeding-season at Lundy Island, and at many other stations where birds of several species mix their various voices--the yammeris and the yowlis, and skrykking, screeking, skrymming scowlis, and meickle moyes and shoutes, of old Dunbar's wonderful onomatopoetic lines. Here there was only one species, with a clear resonant cry, and as every bird uttered that one cry, and no other, a totally different effect was produced. The herring-gull and <b>lesser</b> <b>black-backed</b> <b>gull</b> resemble each other in language as they do in general appearance; both have very powerful and clear voices unlike the guttural black-headed and common gull. But the herring-gull has a shriller, more piercing voice, and resembles the black-backed species just as, in human voices, a boy's clear treble resembles a baritone. Both birds have a variety of notes; and both, when the nest is threatened with danger, utter one powerful importunate cry, which is repeated incessantly until the danger is over. And as the birds breed in communities, often very populous, and all clamour together, the effect of so many powerful and unisonant voices is very grand; but it differs in the two species, owing to the quality of their voices being different; the storm of sound produced by the black-backs is deep and solemn, while that of the herring-gulls has a ringing sharpness almost metallic.|$|E

40|$|<b>Lesser</b> <b>black-backed</b> <b>gulls</b> Larus fuscus are {{considered}} to be mainly pelagic. We assessed the importance of different landscape elements (open sea, tidal flats and inland) by comparing marine and terrestrial foraging behaviours in <b>lesser</b> <b>black-backed</b> <b>gulls</b> breeding along the coast of the southern North Sea. We attached GPS data loggers to eight incubating birds and collected information on diet and habitat use. The loggers recorded data for 10 - 19 days to allow flight-path reconstruction. <b>Lesser</b> <b>black-backed</b> <b>gulls</b> foraged in both offshore and inland areas, but rarely on tidal flats. Targets and directions were similar among all eight individuals. Foraging trips (n = 108) lasted 0. 5 - 26. 4 h (mean 8. 7 h), and ranges varied from 3. 0 - 79. 9 km (mean 30. 9 km). The total distance travelled per foraging trip ranged from 7. 5 - 333. 6 km (mean 97. 9 km). Trips out to sea were significantly more variable in all parameters than inland trips. Presence in inland areas was closely associated with daylight, whereas trips to sea occurred at day and night, but mostly at night. The most common items in pellets were grass (48 %), insects (38 %), fish (28 %), litter (26 %) and earthworms (20 %). There was a significant relationship between the carbon and nitrogen isotope signals in blood and the proportional time each individual spent foraging at sea/land. On land, gulls preferentially foraged on bare ground, with significantly higher use of potato fields and significantly less use of grassland. The flight patterns of <b>lesser</b> <b>black-backed</b> <b>gulls</b> at sea overlapped with fishing-vessel distribution, including small beam trawlers fishing for shrimps in coastal waters close to the colony and large beam-trawlers fishing for flatfish at greater distances.

40|$|While seabird-fishery {{associations}} are well documented, this research primarily comes from ship-based surveys and consequently individual level responses to discard availability are largely unknown. As {{part of a}} long-term study on <b>lesser</b> <b>black-backed</b> <b>gulls</b> (Larus fuscus) in the Netherlands, the fine-scale movements of adults were tracked with GPS tags throughout the breeding period. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine if <b>lesser</b> <b>black-backed</b> <b>gulls</b> were utilizing fishery discards in the Wadden Sea and to examine possible consequences of this behaviour. Within the Wadden Sea during weekdays, tracked birds predominately associated with zones where fishing vessels are known to operate (deep gullies). Across all individuals combined (n = 40), there was a significantly reduced use of the Wadden Sea during weekends when the fleets were not operating. Eight females, who markedly increased their use of the Wadden Sea during weekdays throughout the breeding period, were largely responsible for this pattern. The loss of discard resources on weekends primarily resulted in these eight individuals switching to terrestrial foraging areas. Nest attendance and total foraging time were consistent between weekdays and weekends, suggesting that resource shifts on weekends did not impact daily time budgets. As such, it appears that <b>lesser</b> <b>black-backed</b> <b>gulls</b> specializing on discard utilization are able to flexibly respond to the temporary loss of discards by switching to alternative resources. </p...|$|R

40|$|Wind energy {{generation}} is increasing globally, and associated environmental impacts must be considered. The risk of seabirds colliding with offshore wind turbines {{is influenced by}} flight height, and flight height data usually come from observers on boats, making estimates in daylight in fine weather. GPS tracking provides an alternative and generates flight height information {{in a range of}} conditions, but the raw data have associated error. * Here, we present a novel analytical solution for accommodating GPS error. We use Bayesian state-space models to describe the flight height distributions and the error in altitude measured by GPS for <b>lesser</b> <b>black-backed</b> <b>gulls</b> and great skuas, tracked throughout the breeding season. We also examine how location and light levels influence flight height. * <b>Lesser</b> <b>black-backed</b> <b>gulls</b> flew lower by night than by day, indicating that this species {{would be less likely to}} encounter turbine blades at night, when birds’ ability to detect and avoid them might be reduced. Gulls flew highest over land and lowest near the coast. For great skuas, no significant relationships were found between flight height, time of day and location. * We consider four ‘collision risk windows’, corresponding to the airspace swept by rotor blades for different offshore wind turbine designs. We found the highest proportion of birds at risk for a 22 – 250 m turbine (up to 9 % for great skuas and 34 % for <b>lesser</b> <b>black-backed</b> <b>gulls)</b> and the lowest for a 30 – 258 m turbine. Our results suggest <b>lesser</b> <b>black-backed</b> <b>gulls</b> are at greater risk of collision than great skuas, especially by day. * Synthesis and applications. Our novel modelling approach is an effective way of resolving the error associated with GPS tracking data. We demonstrate its use on GPS measurements of altitude, generating important information on how breeding seabirds use their environment. This approach and the associated data also provide information to improve avian collision risk assessments for offshore wind farms. Our modelling approach could be applied to other GPS data sets to help manage the ecological needs of seabirds and other species at a time when the pressures on the marine environment are growing...|$|R

40|$|A {{survey in}} 1994 {{recorded}} nearly 14, 000 pairs of Larus gulls of four species nesting on buildings in Britain and Ireland.

Since the last such survey in 1976, <b>Lesser</b> <b>Black-backed</b> <b>Gulls</b> had shown {{the highest rate of}} increase. Despite the sharp decline in the numbers of Herring Gulls breeding in Britain and Ireland since the mid- 1970 s, numbers nesting on roofs had continued increasing, albeit at a lower rate than before. New developments since 1976 included increasing numbers nesting inland and on the roofs of large industrial buildings. The study of a colony of Herring <b>Gulls</b> and <b>Lesser</b> <b>Black-backed</b> <b>Gulls</b> nesting on one such industrial building showed that the breeding success of these birds, although lower than that found for roof-nesting birds at more dispersed colonies, was higher than that at many traditional colonies. Low nest density, shelter for chicks and safety from predators were thought to be important contributors to this success. In addition, die colony was situated very close to the sources of food, agricultural land and urban areas, found to be most important in die diet of Herring Gulls nesting there. A review of dietary studies of roof-nesting Herring Gulls found that, despite the location of such colonies in urban areas, urban sites were not always an important source of food. The reduction in availability of one urban source of food, untreated sewage, was found to have little effect upon the gulls using an urban stretch of river. In particular, neither of the species causing most problems in urban areas, the Herring Gull and Lesser Black- backed Gull, decreased in number; in fact, numbers of these species nesting on buildings in the area increased considerably...|$|R
