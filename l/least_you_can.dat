25|$|Humphries has {{presented}} many successful shows in London, {{most of which}} he subsequently toured internationally. Although he eventually gained worldwide popularity, he encountered stiff resistance {{in the early years}} of his career: his first London one-man show, A Nice Night's Entertainment (1962), received scathing reviews, and it was several years before he made a second attempt. He gained considerable notoriety with his next one-man revue, Just a Show, staged at London's Fortune Theatre in 1969. It polarised the critics but was a hit with audiences and became the basis of a growing cult following in the UK. He built on this with his early '70s shows, including A Load of Olde Stuffe (1971) and At <b>Least</b> <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> Say You've Seen It (1974–75).|$|E
25|$|The news of {{the victory}} was {{received}} in Britain with the warmest enthusiasm. It was the first certain sign that the mutinies of the summer had not destroyed {{the power and the}} prestige of the Royal Navy. Duncan was at once (21 October) raised to the peerage as Viscount Duncan, of Camperdown, and Baron Duncan, of Lundie in the Shire of Perth (with which came the lands now known as Camperdown Park in Dundee), and there was a strong feeling that the reward was inadequate. Even as early as 18 October his aunt, Lady Mary Duncan, wrote to Henry Dundas, at that time secretary of state for war: Report says my nephew is only made a Viscount. Myself it is nothing, but the whole nation thinks the <b>least</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do is to give him an English earldom. … Am sure were this properly represented to our good king, who esteems a brave, religious man like himself, would be of my opinion. …. It was not, however, till 1831, many years after Duncan's death, that his son, then bearing his title, was raised to the dignity of an earl, and his other children to the rank and precedence of the children of an earl.|$|E

You'll love it, and it's such a dense show (in {{the best sense}} of the word) that it rewards repeated viewing. Like Scrubs and the British version of The Office, it {{is the sort of}} show that truly deserves to be seen uninterrupted, several episodes at a time, for maximum enjoyment. The laughs-per-minute quotient here is insanely high, making it great value as a home library purchase." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{liner notes}} of Homework {{pay tribute to}} {{a large number of}} musical artists and contain a quote from Brian Wilson. Bangalter stated: [...] "In Brian Wilson's music you could really feel the beauty—it was very spiritual. Like Bob Marley, too." [...] When {{questioned}} on the success of Daft Punk's debut album and the rising popularity of their associated musical genre, Bangalter responded, [...] "before us you had Frankie Knuckles or Juan Atkins and so on. The <b>least</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do is pay respect to those who are not known and who have influenced people." [...] The Daft Punk track [...] "Teachers", from Homework, refers to several influences, such as Romanthony and Todd Edwards. Homem-Christo stated: [...] "Their music had a big effect on us. The sound of their productions—the compression, the sound of the kick drum and Romanthony's voice, the emotion and soul—is part of how we sound today." [...] A 2011 Bodytonic podcast featured tracks from all of the artists named in [...] "Teachers", the Brian Wilson speech quoted in the liner notes of Homework, and a Kraftwerk-like 1983 track produced by Daniel Vangarde, father of Bangalter.|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of the failed coup, Diệm blamed Durbrow for a {{perceived}} lack of US support, while his brother Nhu further accused the ambassador of colluding with the rebels. Durbrow denied this in later years, saying that he had been [...] "100% in support of Diệm". In January 1961, Diệm told Kahin of his belief the US had been involved, while Nhu told Karnow [...] "the principal culprits in the revolt were the 'western embassies' and individual Americans in particular ... American military advisers were helping the paratroopers during the revolt." [...] In May 1961, Nhu said [...] "he <b>least</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> say ... is that the State Department was neutral between a friendly government and rebels who tried to put that government down ... and the official attitude of the Americans during that coup was not at all the attitude the President would have expected". For Diệm, that Durbrow had called for restraint was an indication he saw Diệm and the rebels as equals, something Diệm saw as anathema. Durbrow called for Diệm to treat the remaining rebel leaders leniently, stressing the need for Diệm to [...] "unify all elements of the country", but Diệm was adamantly opposed to this, angrily rebuffing the ambassador, saying [...] "You apparently do not understand that the rebels caused much blood-letting", accusing them having [...] "duped" [...] innocent people. Diệm also sent Gene Gregory, an American supporter who edited the Times of Vietnaman English-language newspaper operated as a mouthpiece for the Nhus and known for stridently attacking Ngô family opponentsto meet Durbrow with concrete evidence of [...] "American support of and complicity in the coup". From the coup onwards, Diệm became increasingly suspicious of Washington's policies. He was also angry with US media coverage of the coup, which depicted Diệm as authoritarian and the revolt as a manifestation of widespread discontent. Diệm instead viewed opposition simply as troublemakers.|$|E

2500|$|Some authors {{started using}} metaphors: Dawn for Socialism, Spring for Revolution, Vampire for Policeman, etc., which {{made some of}} the works unintentionally poetic, {{something}} that is today remembered with some nostalgia (even today, specially {{in some of the}} smaller newspapers, we can find an overly elaborated prose in everyday subjects). David Mourão Ferreira wrote in the poem that was later sung by Amália Rodrigues as [...] "Fado de Peniche", [...] "At <b>least</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> hear the wind! - At <b>least</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> hear the sea!", in a reference to the political prisoners held in the Forte de Peniche (Peniche fortress), not to the fishermen of the town (fisheries and fish canning have been the most important activity in Peniche for decades). The objective of this coded wording was to induce in the audience the suspicion of everything being reported and officially sanctioned by the authorities, and let the second meaning be imagined even where there were none.|$|E
