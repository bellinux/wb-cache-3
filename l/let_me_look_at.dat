60|$|DAISY. [Seizing {{him by the}} shoulders.] <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> your eyes. George, you're crazy. You can't go.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{returned}} the stranger, smiling. [...] "And certainly not before that interested young lady, Jim. But stop. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Constance--what a change! <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> your dear face again. Oh, how unkind {{of you to}} {{keep your}} address from me all this time!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She only {{expressed}} it by being here and by <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her. That was enough!" [...] he exclaimed with a singular laugh.|$|R
6000|$|... "There, Agnes, I {{will forgive}} you; and now <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>look</b> fairly <b>at</b> you: {{turn to the}} light. Really, I do not think you look a year older." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm glad you're not," [...] exclaimed the downright Hastings, with palpable {{relief in}} his voice that an idol had not been shattered. [...] "I think Humphrey's a fakir, and all {{this sort of thing}} tommyrot. He wouldn't get my vote by giving me {{lemonade}} and cake and <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> his cows. If you ever run for office, I'd like to cast it for you. My father is only a summer resident, but since he has gone out of business he stays here till Christmas, and I'll be twenty-one in a year." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{but nobody}} wants a fire this time o' year. Put these colored things by; <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> your nets, if you've got 'em." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He wouldn't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the pistols," [...] whined the tipsy man, {{collapsing}} {{now that}} he saw he was powerless to do any more injury.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps I was not," [...] she answered, {{putting a}} hand to her head. [...] "Begin again, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> {{something}} else. Stay! Now tell me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will you <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>look</b> again <b>at</b> the pass, Signore?" [...] {{asked the}} Genevese, {{as if he}} thought a {{sufficient}} legal warranty for that which he now strongly desired to do might yet {{be found in the}} instrument itself.|$|R
6000|$|Neumann. Stay! <b>let</b> <b>me</b> but <b>look</b> <b>at</b> {{this second}} quarter. [...] Look there! That is, when at Prague Castle the Imperial [...] Counsellors, Martinitz and Stawata were hurled down head [...] 75 [...] over heels. 'Tis even so! there stands Count Thur who [...] {{commands}} it.|$|R
6000|$|CONJURER. Oh, I quite agree. The {{apparatus}} {{is perfectly}} simple. By the way, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> have a <b>look</b> <b>at</b> those goldfish of yours, will you? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And I {{tell you}} seriously,' rejoined Ralph, 'what I {{told you this}} minute. Stay. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> you. There's a liquorish devilry in your face. What is this?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Rochester, I {{have just}} {{discovered}} {{the sun is}} far declined from its meridian, and Pilot is actually gone home to his dinner. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> your watch." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm glad of it, Giles, for {{it gives}} the {{children}} a chance of seeing something of you. I wish you'd <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> that cut on your shoulder. Do!" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "At {{that age}} I once stabbed my best friend, Fred, {{with a pair}} of pinking shears in the base of the neck, enraged because he had been given the {{comprehensive}} sixty-four-crayon Crayola box—including the gold and silver crayons—and would not <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>look</b> closely <b>at</b> the box to see how Crayola had stabilized the built-in crayon sharpener under the tiers of crayons." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come {{out here}} and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> have a <b>look</b> <b>at</b> you," [...] she said enticingly, for she {{predicted}} an explosion and public disgrace if peace was not speedily restored.|$|R
6000|$|... "That was curious, mother," [...] Harry said, [...] "very curious. Can you fetch me {{the seal}} and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> have a <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it? I don't {{remember}} ever having seen it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Leopold," [...] she faltered, [...] "what {{has changed}} you like this? What has dried {{up all the}} passion in you? You are a {{different}} man. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> you." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{wiped his}} finger and thumb on the tail of his coat. [...] "Now," [...] he resumed, [...] "if you have got your letter with you, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Have the {{goodness}} to draw your chair a little nearer, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> you,' said Mrs Wititterly; 'I am so very nearsighted that I can't quite discern your features.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, don't for a moment. Just <b>let</b> <b>me</b> {{have another}} <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the red. You see, dear, {{it has just}} {{occurred}} to me--that chinchilla would look so well on the red!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Miss Harriet,' he said, {{resuming}} his chair, 'I {{wish you}} would <b>let</b> <b>me</b> serve you. <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> me; I ought to look honest, for I know I am so, at present. Do I?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{a bit of}} a dog-fancier myself," [...] said Smith, still gazing hard at his {{companion}} {{from the corner of his}} eyes. [...] "Perhaps you'll <b>let</b> <b>me</b> have a <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There it is again," [...] he murmured; [...] "the old pipe once more! <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it, Jack Brace; it's not {{the first}} by a long way that I've handled." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Peter!" [...] cried Hester, drying {{her eyes}} {{somewhat}} impatiently; [...] "how {{could you be}} so cruel? Why--why could you not have waited just one minute to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear sir," [...] he {{answered}} very gently, [...] "this is altogether a most unfortunate business, but I'm afraid I must {{ask you to}} <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the duplicate you speak of." ...|$|E
40|$|André Prüm {{has asked}} {{me to talk about}} “La Théorie de l´organe” supposing that this is a German invention. Well, we cannot claim the authorship or {{copyright}} for that, but it is true that this doctrine is still dominating German doctrinal thinking in company law. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> first <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the historical development and background of this theory and then ask for its actual meaning and practical consequences...|$|R
6000|$|... "Form them in line," [...] {{the colonel}} said, [...] "and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> have a <b>look</b> <b>at</b> them. They are all {{ready and willing}} to serve her majesty, I hope," [...] he added with a grim smile.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I wouldn't {{stand there}} and <b>let</b> them see <b>me</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> them as if I couldn't bear them {{out of my sight}} for a moment," [...] said Kate, whisking herself out of the room. [...] "They're {{conceited}} enough, Heaven knows, already." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Suppose you <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> myself," [...] {{said the}} stranger, laughing. [...] "The happy effect on my intellect is perhaps {{obstructed}} {{by a little}} doubt as to the effect on my appearance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{fortunate}} that I {{gave you the}} key!" [...] she declared. [...] "I don't suppose I should ever have heard you. Now please stand there in the light and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Where are they?" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Show me one! Where is the tree? How did the man come {{to write}} this? Where did he write it? <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> {{one of the}} beans!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now <b>let</b> <b>me</b> have a <b>look</b> <b>at</b> you," [...] he said. [...] "My {{eyes are}} not what they once were, and I need these {{powerful}} lenses for my work, or to see distinctly the features of those around me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps I shouldn't," [...] he answered, [...] "but I couldn't help it. I {{said that}} I would keep clear of you, and if I have met you by {{accident}} {{it is not}} my fault. Come, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> have a <b>look</b> <b>at</b> that child." ...|$|R
6000|$|She found Fergus {{watching}} {{for her at}} the gate, with the appeal, 'Aunt Jane, there's been a great downfall of cliff, and I {{want to see what}} formations it has brought to light, but they won't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> through to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it, though I told them White always did.' ...|$|R
