In the model, there is a non-tradable sector (which includes services) and two tradable sectors: the booming sector, and the lagging (or non-booming) tradable sector.

The lagging sector is usually manufacturing or agriculture.|$|R

50|$|In 2004, the Delhi Belly {{space was}} added. The bars were rearranged {{to create more}} space and ease {{congestion}} and queuing. Finally, a brand new large box office was created {{in one of the}} rooms off the front alley, which freed up the old box office to become a larger and more usable publicity office with a sofa and coffee. The shows at the Underbelly venue won a record number of awards, including the Perrier Award for Jackson's Way; Fringe First Awards for The Ignatius Trail, Manchester Girl and The Jammer; Perrier Newcomer Nomination for Joanna <b>Neary</b> <b>in</b> Joanna <b>Neary</b> is Not Feeling Herself; and an Amnesty Award nomination for Someone Who'll Watch Over Me.|$|R
500|$|The {{character}} Roy McComb {{was played}} by actor Zak Orth. Roy's name was inspired from Richard Dreyfuss' character Roy <b>Neary</b> <b>in</b> Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The writers {{noted in the}} audio commentary that Roy was the first guest character the audience could get emotionally invested in. They wanted the actor to shave off his head {{in preparation for the}} experimentation scene in Walter's lab, but Orth successfully [...] "begged" [...] them to change their minds. When casting for the part of Grant, the writers looked for a man similar in appearance to previous character John Scott (Mark Valley), as they wanted [...] "to play into whatever Olivia's feelings about how she was or was not betrayed by John". Peter Hermann won the part.|$|R
5000|$|Regarding {{writing for}} the {{children}} characters of the series, the Duffer Brothers considered themselves as outcasts from other students {{while in high school}} and thus found it easy to write for Mike and his friends, and particularly for Barb. Joyce was fashioned after Richard Dreyfuss's character Roy <b>Neary</b> <b>in</b> Close Encounters of the Third Kind, as she appears [...] "absolutely bonkers" [...] to everyone else as she tries to find Will. Other characters, such as Billy in the second season, have more villainous attributes that are not necessarily obvious from the onset; Matt explained that they took further inspiration from Stephen King for these characters, as King [...] "always has really great human villains" [...] that may be more malicious than the supernatural evil.|$|R

25|$|Welsh {{went on to}} beat Eddie Carter in Philadelphia on Christmas Day 1907, Kid Locke on 2 January {{and then}} Maurice Sayers at the Milwaukee Boxing Club. He then faced local Milwaukee boxer Charley <b>Neary</b> <b>in</b> a ten-round match, the {{decision}} going to the referee Al Bright, who called the encounter a draw. This {{was followed by a}} fight against Chicago boxer Packey McFarland, one of the greatest lightweight boxers of history, which McFarland won on points. The contest caused controversy after Welsh was floored in the fourth round following what is believed to be a low shot. The referee failed to see the offending blow, and the match continued. When the points decision was announced there was jeering from the crowd, and accusations of favouritism were made, as referee Malachy Hogan was a Chicago man and had previously favoured Chicago fighters.|$|R
