50|$|A lightcraft is a space- or air-vehicle {{driven by}} <b>laser</b> <b>propulsion.</b> <b>Laser</b> <b>propulsion</b> is in {{early stages of}} development.

40|$|A <b>laser</b> ignition/ablation <b>propulsion</b> {{system that}} captures the {{advantages}} of both liquid and solid propulsion. A reel system is used to move a propellant tape containing a plurality of propellant material targets through an ignition chamber. When a propellant target is in the ignition chamber, a laser beam from a laser positioned above the ignition chamber strikes the propellant target, igniting the propellant material and resulting in a thrust impulse. The propellant tape is advanced, carrying another propellant target into the ignition chamber. The propellant tape and ignition chamber are designed to ensure that each ignition event is isolated from the remaining propellant targets. Thrust and specific impulse may by precisely controlled by varying the synchronized propellant tape/laser speed. The <b>laser</b> ignition/ablation <b>propulsion</b> system may be scaled for use in small and large applications...|$|R

40|$|This will be {{a survey}} paper of work that was {{performed}} by the Space Environmental Effects Team at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center {{in the area of}} <b>laser</b> energy <b>propulsion</b> concepts. Two types of <b>laser</b> energy <b>propulsion</b> techniques were investigated. The first was ablative propulsion, which used a pulsed ruby laser impacting on single layer coatings and films. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the laser power density that produced an optimum coupling coefficient for each type of material tested. A commercial off-the-shelf multi-layer film was also investigated for possible applications in ablative micro-thrusters, and its optimum coupling coefficient was determined. The second type of study measured the purely photonic force provided by a 300 W CW YAG laser. In initial studies, the photon force resulting from the momentum of incident photons was measured directly using a vacuum compatible microbalance and these results were compared to theory. Follow-on work used the same CW laser to excite a stable optical cavity for the purpose of amplifying the available force from incident photons...|$|R
50|$|<b>Laser</b> <b>propulsion</b> is an {{alternative}} method of propulsion ideal for launching objects into orbit, as this method requires less fuel, meaning less mass must be launched. A nuclear pumped laser is ideal for this operation. A launch using <b>laser</b> <b>propulsion</b> requires high intensity, short pulses, good quality, and a high power output. A nuclear pumped laser would theoretically be capable of meeting these requirements.|$|E
50|$|Kantrowitz's {{interdisciplinary}} {{research in the}} area of fluid mechanics and gas dynamics led to contributions in the field of magnetohydrodynamics and to the development of high-efficiency, high-power lasers. He first suggested a system of <b>laser</b> <b>propulsion</b> to launch bulk payloads into orbit, using energy from ground-based lasers to increase exhaust velocity and thereby reduce the propellant-to-payload mass ratio. His concepts on <b>laser</b> <b>propulsion</b> were published in 1988.|$|E
50|$|The {{limitations}} {{posed by}} the rocket equation can be overcome, if the energy source is not carried by the spacecraft. In the Beamed <b>Laser</b> <b>Propulsion</b> (BLP) concept, the photons are beamed from the photon source to the spacecraft as coherent light. Robert L.

40|$|Beamed energy {{concepts}} {{offer an}} alternative for an advanced propulsion system. The use of a remote power source reduces {{the weight of the}} propulsion system in flight and this, combined with the high performance, provides significant payload gains. Within the context of this study's baseline scenario, two beamed energy propulsion concepts are potentially attractive: solar thermal <b>propulsion</b> and <b>laser</b> thermal <b>propulsion.</b> The conceived beamed energy propulsion devices generally provide low thrust (tens of pounds to hundreds of pounds); therefore, they are typically suggested for cargo transportation. For the baseline scenario, these propulsion system can provide propulsion between the following nodes: (1) low Earth orbit to geosynchronous Earth orbit; (2) low Earth orbit to low lunar orbit; (3) low lunar orbit to low Mars orbit [...] only solar thermal; and (4) lunar surface to low lunar orbit [...] only laser thermal...|$|R
40|$|Propulsion {{within the}} lightcraft concept is {{produced}} via laser induced detonation of an incoming hypersonic air stream. This process requires suitable engine configurations that offer good performance over all flight speeds and angles of attack {{to ensure the}} required thrust is maintained.

This paper will outline the current methodology employed in the inlet design, with a particular focus on the performance of the lightcraft inlet at angles of attack. Fully three-dimensional turbulent computational fluid dynamics simulations have been performed on a variety of inlet configurations. The performance of the lightcraft inlets have been evaluated at differing angles of attack.

40|$|<b>Laser</b> thermal <b>propulsion</b> (LTP) is {{studied for}} the case in which laser power is absorbed by a small very {{high-temperature}} plasma (about 20, 000 K) and transferred to {{the remainder of the}} pure hydrogen propellant by radiation and mixing. This concept could lead to the realization of a lightweight orbital transfer vehicle propulsion system having a specific impulse in the range 1000 - 2000 s. Approximately 12 percent of the input power may be radiated to the thruster walls, and 15 percent of the total propellant flow must be heated to 20, 000 K to provide a bulk temperature of 5000 K prior to expansion. Three principal research issues identified are: (1) conditions for hydrogen plasma ignition, (2) control of the plasma position within the laser beam, plasma stability, and plasma absorption efficiency, and (3) characterization of the mixing of the plasma and buffer flows...|$|R

40|$|The {{technological}} and economical {{impact of a}} large central power station in Earth orbit on the performance and cost of future spacecraft and their orbital transfer systems are examined. It is shown that beaming power to remote users cannot be cost effective if the central power station uses the same power generation system that is readily available for provision of onboard power and microwave transmission and reception of power through space for use in space is not cost competitive with onboard power or <b>propulsion</b> systems. <b>Laser</b> and receivers are required to make central power stations feasible. Remote power transmission for propulsion of orbital transfer vehicles promises major cost benefits.

40|$|An {{review of}} the {{problems}} associated with modeling <b>laser</b> thermal <b>propulsion</b> flows, a synopsis of the status of such models, and the attributes of a successful model are presented. The continuous gaseous hydrogen laser-supported combustion wave (LSCW) thruster, for which a high-energy laser system (preferably space-based) should exist by the time the propulsion technology is developed, is considered in particular. The model proposed by Raizer (1970) is based on the assumptions of one-dimensional flow at constant pressure with heat conduction as the principal heat transfer mechanism. Consideration is given to subsequent models which account for radiative transfer into the ambient gas; provide a two-dimensional generalization of Raizer's analysis for the subsonic propagation of laser sparks in air; include the effect of forward plasma radiation in a one-dimensional model; and attempt a time-dependent (elliptic) solution of the full Navier-Stokes equations for the flow in a simple axisymmetric thruster. Attention is also given to thruster and nozzle flow models and thermodynamic and transport properties...|$|R
