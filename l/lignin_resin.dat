These resins are primarily employed {{in the manufacture of}} wood panels such as plywood, MDF, particle-board and OSB. The most important thermal conversion methods for this purpose are fast pyrolysis and vacuum pyrolysis, pressure liquefaction and phenolysis. Many feedstocks have been tested for their suitability as sources of phenolics including hard and softwoods, bark and residual <b>lignins.</b> <b>Resins</b> have been prepared utilising either the whole liquid product, or a phenolics enriched fraction obtained after fractional condensation or further processing, such as solvent extraction. None of the phenolics production and fractionation techniques covered in this review are believed to allow substitution of 100 % of the phenol content of the resin without impacting its effectiveness compared to commercial formulations based on petroleum derived phenol. This survey shows that considerable progress has been made towards reaching the goal of a price competitive renewable resin, but that further research is required to meet the twin challenges of low renewable resin cost and satisfactory quality requirements. Particular areas of concern are wood panel press times, variability of renewable resin properties, odour, lack of reactive sites compared to phenol and potential for increased emissions of volatile organic compounds.

40|$|A {{cross-linked}} biomass-polymer composite with a lignin {{content of}} up to 60 % was prepared by blending lignin with an epoxy resin and polyamine using a hot press molding process. The characteristics of the curing reaction of <b>lignin</b> with epoxy <b>resin</b> were studied using DSC and FTIR analysis. The effect of molding temperature and molding pressure on the mechanical properties and microstructure of the lignin/epoxy resin composite was also studied by SEM, DMA, and TG analyses. The {{results showed that the}} epoxy resin can be cured by lignin, and the curing temperature for the blends can be reduced by the introduction of a polyamine cure agent. The properties of the composite, such as bending strength, impact strength, glass-transition temperature, and thermal stability, were evidently influenced by the molding process.

The results of mechanical properties test showed that the bending strength of the composites decreases gradually with increasing the content of lignin, while the impact strength increased firstly and then decreased. The bending strength of lignin/epoxy resin composites showed a trend of increasing firstly and then decreasing with the increase {{of the content of}} polyamide, while the impact strength exhibited an opposite trend. The density for the composites increased with the addition of lignin, and polyamide exhibited an inconspicuous effect on density of the composites.

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{renewable}} starting materials, such as sugars and polysaccharides, vegetable oils, <b>lignin,</b> pine <b>resin</b> derivatives, and proteins, {{have so far}} been investigated for the preparation of bio-based polymers. Among the various sources of bio-based feedstock, vegetable oils {{are one of the}} most widely used starting materials in the polymer industry due to their easy availability, low toxicity, and relative low cost. Another bio-based plastic of great interest is poly(lactic acid) (PLA), widely used in multiple commercial applications nowadays. There is an intrinsic expectation that bio-based polymers are also biodegradable, but in reality there is no guarantee that polymers prepared from biorenewable feedstock exhibit significant or relevant biodegradability. Biodegradability studies are therefore crucial in order to assess the long-term environmental impact of such materials. This review presents a brief overview of the different classes of bio-based polymers, with a strong focus on vegetable oil-derived resins and PLA.

40|$|International audienceThe {{aim of this}} {{research}} was a reduction of formaldehyde emission and the improvement of the water resistance of urea formaldehyde (UF) resins by incorporating glyoxalated soda bagasse lignin. For this purpose, various contents of unmodified and glyoxalated lignins (10, 15 and 20 %) were added at pH = 7 instead of second urea during the UF resin synthesis. The properties of the resins as well as water absorption, shear strength, and formaldehyde emission of plywood panels made with these adhesives were measured. Among all the resins synthesized, the resin yielding the best results (based on formaldehyde emission and gelation time as well as water absorption, mechanical strength, and formaldehyde content of the associated panels) was selected, and its properties were further analyzed by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry (FTIR), and X-ray Diffractometry (XRD). The <b>lignin</b> based <b>resins</b> yielded good shear strength of the plywood panels, passing comfortably relevant international standard specifications; the panels also showed lower formaldehyde emission and water absorption when compared to commercial UF adhesives. Based on these findings, it was attempted to improve the performance of soda bagasse <b>lignin</b> in UF <b>resins</b> by glyoxalation. The UF resin containing 15 % glyoxalated lignin (GLUF 15) still exhibited less water absorption and formaldehyde release without significant differences in shear strength and physicochemical properties compared to the UF resin control. DSC analysis indicated that in comparison to UF resin the curing process of GLUF resin shifted to lower temperatures. According to the FTIR spectra, by addition of lignin the proportion of C-N bond in methylene linkages decreases when urea is partly replaced by lignin or glyoxalated lignin.

They are characterized by the abundant presence of n-alkanes (annual average, 340 ng m - 3), fatty acids (769 ng m - 3), sugars (412 ng m - 3), and phthalates (387 ng m - 3). In contrast, fatty alcohols, polyols/polyacids, <b>lignin</b> and <b>resin</b> products, sterols, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and hopanes were detected as relatively minor components. n-Alkanes show a weak odd/even carbon predominance (CPI = 1. 1) and PAHs show a predominance of benzo(b) fluoranthene, suggesting a serious contribution from fossil fuel (mainly coal) combustion. Their concentrations (except for phthalates and polyols/polyacids) were 2 - 15 times higher in winter than summer due to a significant usage of coal burning and an enhancement of atmospheric inversion layers. Phthalates were found to be more abundant in summer than winter, probably due to enhanced vaporization from plastics followed by adsorptive deposition on the pre-existing particles. Concentrations of total quantified compounds are extremely high (∼ 10 μg m - 3) in the midwest (Chongqing and Xi'an) where active industrialization/urbanization is going on.

40|$|Abstract: The polysaccharides are {{important}} materials in food, pharmaceutical, cosmetic and related bio-medical applications. Xanthan gum is a microbial polysaccharide of great commercial significance. It {{is well known}} as one of the best thickening polymers due to its high intrinsic stiffness related to the he-lical conformation stabilized in the presence of excess salt. It is used in a wide variety of foods for a number of important reasons, including emulsion stabilization, temperature stability, compatibility with food ingredients, and its pseudoplastic rheological properties. Due to its properties in thickening aque-ous solutions, as a dispersing agent, and stabilizer of emulsions and suspensions, xanthan gum is used in pharmaceutical formulations, cosmetics, and agricultural products, as well as in textile printing pastes, ceramic glazes, slurry explosive formulations, and rust removers. In this work the crosslinking of a mix-ture of xanthan and lignins in the presence of the epichlorohydrin, leading to superabsorbant hydrogels with high swelling rate in aqueous mediums, was studied. The swelling properties of these composite hy-drogels were investigated. Three different types of lignin have been used namely: aspen wood lignin (L), annual fiber crop lignin (GL) and <b>lignin</b> epoxy-modified <b>resin</b> (LER). Semi-interpenetrating polymer net-work hydrogels in various ratios were prepared. The influence of gravimetric ratio between components of the semi-interpenetrating polymer networks, as well as the kinetics of water sorption will be discussed.

40|$|The {{scope of}} this work is to {{introduce}} the by-product material lignin of the industrial pulping process in a completely new value chain of fiber reinforced polymers. Due to its natural origin the use of lignin in conventional applications is limited because of process impurities such as sulfur contamination, chemical inhomogeneities arising from a non-uniform feedstock and the complexity of its characterization. However, lignin presents a renewable source for bulking agents which possess manifold possibilities compared to conventional wooden derivatives such as wood flour or wood fibers. It is possible to adjust fusibility, glass transition temperatures and solubility by the variation of the molecular weight of the lignin. In addition, the chemical functionality of lignin can be specifically defined as required for an application.

The sandwich system currently developed, in cooperation with our partner from industries C 3 Technologies, consists of lignin based foams of varying density and natural fibre reinforced laminates. The lignin is produced from beech-wood via the organosolv-process. Afterwards it is chemically integrated into the phenolic resin. The proportion of <b>lignin</b> in the <b>resin</b> can be varied from 10 % up to 40 %.

Twelve organic compound classes were {{detected in the}} aerosols, including aliphatic lipids, sugar compounds, lignin products, terpenoid biomarkers, sterols, aromatic acids, phthalates, hopanes, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). At daytime, phthalates {{was found to be}} the most abundant compound class; while at nighttime, fatty acids was the dominant one. Concentrations of total quantified organics were higher in summer (611 – 3268 ng m&minus; 3 , average 1586 ng m&minus; 3 ) than in winter (362 – 2381 ng m&minus; 3 , 1136 ng m&minus; 3 ), accounting for 11. 5 &plusmn; 1. 93 % and 9. 35 &plusmn; 1. 77 % of organic carbon mass in summer and winter, respectively. Di-(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate, C 16 fatty acid, and levoglucosan were identified as the most abundant single compounds. The nighttime maxima of most organics in the aerosols indicate a land/sea breeze effect in tropical India, although some other factors such as local emissions and long-range transport may also influence the composition of organic aerosols. The abundances of anhydrosugars (e. g., levoglucosan), <b>lignin</b> and <b>resin</b> products, hopanes and PAHs in the Chennai aerosols suggest that biomass burning and fossil fuel combustion are significant sources of organic aerosols in tropical India. Interestingly, terephthalic acid was maximized at nighttime, which is different from those of phthalic and isophthalic acids. A positive correlation was found between the concentration of 1, 3, 5 -triphenylbenzene (a tracer for plastic burning) and terephthalic acid, suggesting that field burning of municipal solid wastes including plastics is a significant source of terephthalic acid. This study demonstrates that, in addition to biomass burning and fossil fuel combustion, the open-burning of plastics also contributes to the organic aerosols in South Asia...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate the influence of lignin modified by ionic liquids on physical and mechanical properties of plywood panels bonded with the urea–formaldehyde (UF) resin. For this purpose, soda bagasse lignin was modified by the 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium acetate ([Emim][OAc]) ionic liquid and then the various contents of unmodified and modified lignins (10, 15, and 20 %) were added at pH= 7 instead of second urea during the UF resin synthesis.

40|$|At {{this moment}} in time the {{chemical}} and pharmaceutical industry relies heavily on fossil fuels. About 90 % of all produced goods are made out of or with fossil fuels. Also 97 % of the used fossil fuels get burned to generate energy for the established technical processes. This state of the industry can’t be preserved in the long run, since the fossil fuels will ultimately run out. But before that their price has to rise {{to compensate for the}} increasing difficulty in extracting fossil fuels from the environment. This will lead to increasing prices for the produced goods by the chemical and pharmaceutical industry which will result in dropping sales figures. To avoid this substitutes for fossil fuels need to be found. An attractive alternative for fossil fuels are renewable resources. Some even have the potential to substitute fossil fuels completely. One of those renewable resources is lignin. It is a component of wood and the only biopolymer which includes aromatic structures, just like crude oil. Modified lignins are byproducts of the paper industry und the biorefinery. The dominant process to produce paper is called kraft pulping in which kraft lignin is generated as a by-product. At this time it is only getting burned to produce energy. The organosolv lignin needs to find applications to add value and furthermore increase the ecologically and economically potential of biorefineries. To capitalize on the natural lignin synthesis and the added modification of the aforementioned processes an application in the production of phenolic resins offers an interesting and promising approach to generate a multitude of valuable products. To achieve this, the technical lignins need to fit certain requirements. They need to have little to no odor and must be free of components which could inhibit the polymerization process or the performance of the produced polymers. To accomplish this oxidation processes have shown to be very promising, as seen for example in the bleaching of paper made from kraft pulping. To get a detailed view of the impacts of the used oxidation on the technical lignins the oxidations of monomeric and dimeric aromatic model substrates have been screened using analogue reaction parameters. Characteristic products of dearomatization and oxidation fragments of the propyl group have been found. While succinic acid and its derivatives are products of dearomatization, lactic acid derives from the propyl group. It was also found that glyceric and threonic acid are oxidation products of sugars. Taking these results into account, a method to deodorize technical lignins has been found. Using this method it is possible to generate 3, 6 kg of short chained carboxylic acids from kraft lignin and 9, 4 kg of the same from organosolv lignin per ton of used lignin solution. With the remaining deodorized lignins it is possible to manufacture 41 kg of phenolic <b>resins</b> from kraft <b>lignin</b> and 42, 5 kg of the same from organosolv lignin which contain a mass percentage of up to 82 % of the deodorized technical <b>lignins.</b> The phenolic <b>resins</b> exhibit excellent chemical and mechanical attributes and could be used {{for a wide variety of}} different applications. </p...|$|R

Organic compounds which appear as colour come from extracted <b>lignin,</b> tannins and <b>resin</b> acids. Wood processing effluents are often resistant to degradation using biological methods, and are not removed effectively by conventional physicochemical treatment methods, such as coagulation/flocculation, sedimentation, filtration and ozonation. For processing of those effluents it is often necessary to link different methods of purification, {{and one of the}} alternative methods is sorption. In this work the removal of organic pollutants was tested from effluent of the production of mechanically milled groundwood by using sorption to clinoptilolite tuff and to samples of tuff which were modified using the solutions of cationic surfactant- hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (HDTMA-Br) of different concentrations. The sorption processes of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide were researched on the clinoptilolite tuff from Turkey (Aegean Region Turkey, Bigadic), which contains more than 70 % of clinoptilolite, and in smaller mass fraction quartz and opal-CT are present. The tested effluent has the following characteristics: chemical oxygen demand (COD) : 13200 mg dm- 3, total organic carbon (TOC) : 3010 mg dm - 3, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5) : 470 mg dm- 3, colour: 681 Pt Co, turbidity: 799 NTU, pH 4. 8. All testing was done without the adjustment of pH. The conventional process of pre-processing of effluent by coagulation with aluminum chloride hexahydrate (AlCl 3 · 6 H 2 O) was tested and the application ofHDTMA-modified clinoptilolite tuff with the intention of further decrease in organic burden of wastewater. In the Fig. 1 A the results of the HDTMA uptake onto clinoptilolite tuff are shown, and in Fig. 1 B the pertaining zeta potentials of the samples are shown. HDTMA cations were essentially quantitatively taken up by the clinoptilolite tuff up to loading level of L = 0. 204 mmol g - 1 -(Fig. 1 A). The results of the zeta potential measurements show that the negative surface charge changed to positive after modification with surfactant solutions (Fig. 1 B). HDTMA cations form a stable organophilic coating on the clinoptilolite surface, and above surfactant loading level of 0. 110 mmol g - 1 (isoelectric point), a second layer of HDTMA+ cations reverses the surface charge into positive. The optimal mass concentration of coagulant AlCl 3 · 6 H 2 O for the tested wastewater is γ = 0. 8 g dm - 1 (Figs. 2 A and 2 B). Zeta potential of the solution above sediment received by coagulation with AlCl 3 · 6 H 2 O of mass concentration γ= 0. 8 g dm - 3 is ζ= - 3. 92 mV. The efficiency of removing the turbidity (Table 1) and COD is η = 67 % (from 799 to 263 NTU) and 54 % (from 13 200 to 6 040 mg dm - 3). The efficiency of removing solved organic carbon and colour is significantlylesser: 22. 7 % (from 3010 to 2322 mg dm- 3) and η = 33. 0 % (from 681 to 457 Pt Co). By processing the solutions received after coagulation with AlCl 3 · 6 H 2 O of mass concentration of 0. 8 g dm - 3, with natural tuff and organo-zeolites whose loading are: 0. 074; 0. 123; 0. 164 and 0. 204 mmol g - 1 HDTMA, TOC was decreased from γ= 2322 mg dm- 3 to the following: γ= 2042, 1976, 1945, 1907 and 1821 mg dm - 3 and was sorbed: q = 28. 0; 34. 6; 37. 7; 41. 5; and 50. 1 mg g - 1 TOC (Fig. 3 A). Using the sample of organo-zeolite with loading of 0. 204 mmol g - 1 HDTMA, the efficiency of removing the organic carbon was improved from η= 22. 7 % to 40. 0 %. The efficiency of discolouring the tested solutions also increases with the change of the surface charge of organo-zeolites from negative to positive(Fig. 3 B). The efficiency of removing the colour by using the natural tuff was improved from η= 33. 0 % to η = 40. 0 %, and by using the organo-zeolite with loading of L = 0. 204 mmol g - 1 HDTMA to η= 76. 3 %. In order for the biodegradation of the processes effluents to be tested, the rations of BOD 5 /COD are predetermined (Figs. 4 A and 4 B). According to literature data, the good value of biodegradation is the ratio of BOD 5 /COD higher than 0. 5. The tested effluent was characterized as having particularly poor biodegradation. After processing the effluent with coagulation and organo-zeolite (0. 204 mmol g - 1 HDTMA), the biodegradation has not shown significant improvement. It could be concluded that HDTMA-modified clinoptilolite tuff can be used for discolouring and purification of the examined wastewater in one part of wastewater treatment which combines and some other physicochemical and/or biological purification methods...|$|R

In this work the removal of organic pollutants was tested from effluent of the production of mechanically milled groundwood by using sorption to clinoptilolite tuff and to samples of tuff which were modified using the solutions of cationic surfactant- hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (HDTMA-Br) of different concentrations. The sorption processes of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide were researched on the clinoptilolite tuff from Turkey (Aegean Region Turkey, Bigadic), which contains more than 70 % of clinoptilolite, and in smaller mass fraction quartz and opal-CT are present. The tested effluent has the following characteristics: chemical oxygen demand (COD) : 13200 mg dm- 3, total organic carbon (TOC) : 3010 mg dm- 3, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5) : 470 mg dm- 3, colour: 681 Pt Co, turbidity: 799 NTU, pH 4. 8. All testing was done without the adjustment of pH. The conventional process of pre-processing of effluent by coagulation with aluminum chloride hexahydrate (AlCl 3 · 6 H 2 O) was tested and the application of HDTMA-modified clinoptilolite tuff with the intention of further decrease in organic burden of wastewater. In the Fig. 1 A the results of the HDTMA uptake onto clinoptilolite tuff are shown, and in Fig. 1 B the pertaining zeta potentials of the samples are shown. HDTMA cations were essentially quantitatively taken up by the clinoptilolite tuff up to loading level of L = 0. 204 mmol g- 1 (Fig. 1 A). The results of the zeta potential measurements show that the negative surface charge changed to positive after modification with surfactant solutions (Fig. 1 B). HDTMA cations form a stable organophilic coating on the clinoptilolite surface, and above surfactant loading level of 0. 110 mmol g- 1 (isoelectric point), a second layer of HDTMA+ cations reverses the surface charge into positive. The optimal mass concentration of coagulant AlCl 3 · 6 H 2 O for the tested wastewater is γ = 0. 8 g dm- 1 (Figs. 2 A and 2 B). Zeta potential of the solution above sediment received by coagulation with AlCl 3 · 6 H 2 O of mass concentration γ= 0. 8 g dm- 3 is ζ= - 3. 92 mV. The efficiency of removing the turbidity (Table 1) and COD is η = 67 % (from 799 to 263 NTU) and 54 % (from 13 200 to 6 040 mg dm- 3). The efficiency of removing solved organic carbon and colour is significantly lesser: 22. 7 % (from 3010 to 2322 mg dm- 3) and η = 33. 0 % (from 681 to 457 Pt Co). By processing the solutions received after coagulation with AlCl 3 · 6 H 2 O of mass concentration of 0. 8 g dm [...] 3, with natural tuff and organo-zeolites whose loading are: 0. 074; 0. 123; 0. 164 and 0. 204 mmol g- 1 HDTMA, TOC was decreased from γ= 2322 mg dm- 3 to the following: γ= 2042, 1976, 1945, 1907 and 1821 mg dm- 3 and was sorbed: q = 28. 0; 34. 6; 37. 7; 41. 5; and 50. 1 mg g- 1 TOC (Fig. 3 A). Using the sample of organo-zeolite with loading of 0. 204 mmol g- 1 HDTMA, the efficiency of removing the organic carbon was improved from η= 22. 7 % to 40. 0 %. The efficiency of discolouring the tested solutions also increases with the change of the surface charge of organo-zeolites from negative to positive (Fig. 3 B). The efficiency of removing the colour by using the natural tuff was improved from η= 33. 0 % to η = 40. 0 %, and by using the organo-zeolite with loading of L = 0. 204 mmol g- 1 HDTMA to η= 76. 3 %. In order for the biodegradation of the processes effluents to be tested, the rations of BOD 5 /COD are predetermined (Figs. 4 A and 4 B). According to literature data, the good value of biodegradation is the ratio of BOD 5 /COD higher than 0. 5. The tested effluent was characterized as having particularly poor biodegradation. After processing the effluent with coagulation and organo-zeolite (0. 204 mmol g- 1 HDTMA), the biodegradation has not shown significant improvement. It could be concluded that HDTMA-modified clinoptilolite tuff can be used for discolouring and purification of the examined wastewater in one part of wastewater treatment which combines and some other physicochemical and/or biological purification methods...|$|R
