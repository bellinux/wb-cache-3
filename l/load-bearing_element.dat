50|$|Unlike western architecture, {{in ancient}} Chinese wooden architecture, the wall only defined an enclosure, {{and did not}} form a <b>load-bearing</b> <b>element.</b> Buildings in China have been {{supported}} by wooden frames {{for as long as}} seven millennia. The emergence of the characteristic articulated wooden Chinese frame emerged during the Neolithic period. Seven thousand years ago mortise and tenon joinery was used to build wood-framed houses. (The oldest are at Hemudu site at Zhejiang). Over a thousand of these sites have been identified, usually with circular, square or oblong shaped buildings. During the Yangshao culture in the Middle Neolithic, circular and rectangular semisubterranean structures are found with wooden beams and columns. Wooden beams or earth supported the roofs which were most likely thatched.|$|E
50|$|A simple {{suspension}} bridge (also rope bridge, swing bridge (in New Zealand), suspended bridge, hanging bridge and catenary bridge) is a primitive type of bridge that is supported entirely from anchors {{at either end}} and has no towers or piers. However, it may have saddles. In such bridges, {{the deck of the}} bridge follows the downward and upward arc of the load-bearing cables, with additional light ropes at a higher level used to form a handrail. Alternatively, stout handrail cables supported on short piers at each end may be the primary <b>load-bearing</b> <b>element,</b> with the deck suspended below. Suspended well from two high locations over a river or canyon, simple {{suspension bridge}}s follow a shallow downward catenary arc and are not suited for modern roads and railroads. Owing to practical limitation in the grade (i.e. the deck being an arc, not flat) and the response to dynamic loads of the bridge deck, this type is quite restricted in its load-carrying capacity relative to its span. This type of bridge is considered the most efficient and sustainable design in developing countries, however, especially for river crossings that lie in non-floodplain topography such as gorges.|$|E
40|$|In this work, an {{equation}} is developed {{to allow the}} average length of load-bearing elements within a sheet of paper to be estimated from zero and short-span tensile tests. This was used to examine the effect of drying treatment on {{the average length of}} <b>load-bearing</b> <b>element</b> in five fur-nishes: two radiata pine kraft pulps, a eucalyptus globulus kraft pulp, a eucalypt NSSC pulp and a recycled pulp. For each pulp, three sets of handsheets were made. The first set of handsheets was made from the never-dried pulps. The second set of handsheets was made by forming a set of handsheets and air drying them under restraint. The air-dried handsheets were then reslushed and made into handsheets. The third set was made by oven drying a set of handsheets, reslush-ing them and then forming handsheets. Zero and short span tensile strength measurements were made on the fifteen different sets of handsheets to allow the average length of load-bearing ele-ments in each case to be calculated. For all five furnishes {{it was found that the}} average length of <b>load-bearing</b> <b>element</b> was approximately equal to the measured average fibre length, inde-pendent of the type of drying treatment used to produce the handsheets...|$|E

The supporting structure is made of full interfloor plates, roof plate and the unconnected and connected walls with or without openings. Two dimensioned supporting elements, namely the ceiling panel in the 1 st floor and the wall with openings on the circumference of building, are analyzed in detail. The analysis of the load-bearing structure of the building is carried out by using two computational models. The first model, which serves {{for the analysis of}} the ceiling plates, is planar and is constructed by using the program SAP 2000.

Thatcher {{has been involved in}} several studies of small to very small plates (Thatcher 2007; Hammond and Thatcher 2007). The conclusion of the authors was that plates in which no internal deformation has been seen exist down to very small plate sizes. Thatcher (2009) has suggested that if the brittle-elastic crust is stronger than the ductile lithosphere then a block model is preferable, while if the opposite is true, then continuum models should be used. Thatcher also says in this paper that the upper crust is a <b>load-bearing</b> <b>element</b> in regions that are deforming, and so he prefers the block model, although he points out that there is disagreement about this.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of shaking table tests {{performed}} to assess the response of an object placed on a vibration isolator to intense ground motions whose peak accelerations are close to or over the gravity acceleration in both vertical and horizontal directions. The passive vertical and horizontal vibration isolator, developed by the authors, has rolling <b>load-bearing</b> <b>elements</b> and constant-force springs to provide piecewise-constant restoring forces. First, we performed shaking table tests, wherein only the horizontal vibration was isolated. An unexpected finding from the tests is that, when the vibration isolator was subjected to ground motions with intense vertical accelerations, not only vertical but also horizontal accelerations were amplified. This led to a large rocking response or overturning of the object placed on the vibration isolator. A likely reason for the amplification is rocking of the upper portion of the vibration isolator above the rolling <b>load-bearing</b> <b>elements</b> induced by intense vertical accelerations. Next, we performed shaking table tests, wherein both vertical and horizontal vibrations were isolated. In this case, the vertical as well as horizontal accelerations were significantly reduced and the rocking response of the vibration-isolated object was suppressed. These results suggest potential risks in conventional horizontal vibration isolators having rolling <b>load-bearing</b> <b>elements</b> when they are subjected to ground motions with intense vertical accelerations. The results also demonstrate the effectiveness of vertical vibration isolation to avoid such risks...|$|R

40|$|A {{dynamically}} embedded {{plate anchor}} (DEPLA) is a rocket-shaped anchor that comprises a removable central shaft {{and a set}} of four flukes.

40|$|Membrane ‚Äúmechanoprotection ‚Äù is the {{collection}} of features that ensure plasma membrane tensions remain not only sublytic, but too low {{to interfere with the}} functional activity of membrane proteins. Early expectations about mechanosensitive channels were that membrane skeleton stress would provide mechano-gating energy to channels. In diverse ion channels [1], we have shown that plasma membrane stretch can alter channel behavior, but importantly, disrupted membrane skeleton makes it easier not harder for mechanical stimuli to perturb the channels. This is strong evidence that ‚Äúworking ‚Äù membrane skeleton is mechanoprotective of channels during plasma membrane stress, that is that membrane skeleton acts as a <b>load-bearing</b> <b>element</b> in a way that spares the in-parallel bilayer surround of channels from full loads.

Here, we show that the nonlinear stiffening of reconstituted type I collagen networks is controlled by the applied stress, and that the network stiffness becomes surprisingly insensitive to network concentration. We demonstrate how a simple model for networks of elastic fibers can quantitatively account for the mechanics of reconstituted collagen networks. Our model points to the important role of normal stresses in determining the nonlinear shear elastic response, which can explain the approximate exponential relationship between stress and strain reported for collagenous tissues (Fung YC, Am J Physiol 213 (6), 1967). This further suggests new principles for the design of synthetic fiber networks with collagen-like properties, as well as a mechanism for the control of the mechanics of such networks.

40|$|Progressive {{collapse}} is a {{chain reaction}} of failures propagating throughout {{a portion of the}} structure disproportionate to the original local failure occurring when a sudden loss of a critical <b>load‚Äêbearing</b> <b>element</b> initiates a structural element failure, eventually resulting in partial or full collapse of the structure. Both General Services Administration (GSA) and United States Department of Defense (DoD) guidelines incorporate a threat-independent approach to progressive collapse analysis. Therefore, there is an international trend for updating structural design requirements to explicitly design structures to resist progressive collapse. This paper presents simple analytical approach for evaluating progressive collapse potential of typical concrete buildings, comparing four methods for progressive collapse analysis by studying 5 and 10 -story intermediate moment-resistant reinforced concrete frame buildings, employing increasingly more complex analytical procedures: linear-elastic static, nonlinear static, linear-elastic dynamic, and nonlinear dynamic methodologies. Each procedure is thoroughly investigated and its common shortcomings are identified. The evaluation uses current GSA progressive collapse guidelines and can be used in routine design by practicing engineers. These analyses for three column-removal conditions are performed to evaluate the behavior of RC buildings under progressive collapse. Based on obtained findings, dynamic analysis procedures -easy to perform for progressive collapse determination- yielded more accurate results...|$|E
