40|$|Abstract: The early {{climate of}} Mars (Noachian Period, the first ~ 20 % of its history) {{is thought to}} differ {{significantly}} from that of its more recent history (Amazonian Period, the last ~ 66 %) which is characterized by hyperarid, hypothermal conditions that result in mean annual air temperatures (MAAT) well below 0 °C, a global cryosphere, minimal melting on the ground surface, and a horizontally stratified hydrologic system. We explore {{the nature of the}} fluvial and lacustrine environments in the Mars-like hyperarid, hypothermal McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV), where the MAAT is well below 0 °C (~- 14 to- 30 °C) in order to assess whether the Late Noachian geologic record can be explained by a climate characterized by “cold and icy ” conditions. We find that the MDV hydrological system and cycle provide important insights into the potential configuration of a “cold and icy ” early Mars climate in which MDV-like ephemeral streams and rivers, and both closed-basin and open-basin lakes could form. We review a series of MDV fluvial and <b>lacustrine</b> <b>features</b> to guide investigators in the analysis of the geomorphology of early Mars and we outline a new model for the nature and evolution of a “cold and icy ” Late Noachian climate based on these observations. We conclude that a cold and icy Late Noachian Mars with MAAT below freezing, but peak seasonal and peak daily temperatures above 0 °C, could plausibly account for the array of Noachian-aged fluvial and <b>lacustrine</b> <b>features</b> observed on Mars. Our assessment also provides insight into the potential effects of punctuated warming on a cold and icy early Mars, in which impact crater formation or massive volcanic eruptions cause temperatures in the melting range for decadal to centennial timescales. We outline a set of outstanding questions and tests concerning the nature and evolution of these features on Mars...|$|E

Several features, similar to terrestrial <b>lacustrine</b> and coastal <b>features,</b> were identified {{along the northern}} plains periphery from Viking images. The nature of these features argues for formation in a predominantly liquid, shallow body of standing water. Such a shallow sea would require either relatively rapid development of shoreline morphologies or a warmer than present climate {{at the time of}} outflow channel formation...|$|R
40|$|The inputs of {{industrial}} wastes {{have changed the}} levels and forms of chromium in many lakes, and there is growing concern about the accumulation of Cr(VI), a known carcinogen, in drinking water supplies. This report provides a critical review {{of the effects of}} speciation, transformations, and solubility on the cycling of chromium in <b>lacustrine</b> environments. Unique <b>features</b> of chromium dynamics associated with the decoupling of redox-driven chromium cycle from those of iron and manganese at the sediment–water and air–water interfaces are highlighted. Reductive precipitation is important in the immobilization of pollutant chromium in sediments. Photooxidative dissolution of Cr(III) especially at the air–water interface is identified as a key area for further research. The available database is inadequate for establishing any linkages between the chromium and biological cycles in lakes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The Cerdanya basin {{was formed}} during dextral slip along the NE-SW La Tet fault (eastern Pyrenees) which formed a {{horsetail}} structure at its SW end. The resulting basin is clearly asymmetri-cal, formed by several basement blocks tilted towards the La Tet fault and limited by E-W faults. These faults absorbed the movement along the major strike-slip fault. The early basin evolution (Middle-Late Miocene) resulted from strike-slip, while the later evolution (Early Pliocene) involved a generally extensional regime. A variety of depositional environments {{developed in the}} basin during its early evolution: spatially restricted and widespread alluvial fan, distributary fluvial, marginal and open <b>lacustrine.</b> The structu-ral <b>features</b> of the basin that developed during this evolutionary stage differ from those described from most other basins related to strike-slip faulting. Despite this, the structural and sedimentary features of the Cerdanya basin fit the general model of strike-slip related basins. Numerous features which indicate crustal extension and graben formation are reported from areas affected by strike-slip faults. However, at present no detailed description of basin formation near the termination of strike-slip faults exists. This paper deals with a regional study of the Cerdanya basin that developed at the SW end of the La Tet strike-slip fault (Fig. 1). Extensional conditions {{at the ends of}} strike-slip faults {{can be explained by the}} existence of geometrical and mechanical irregularities that occur at fault terminations...|$|R
40|$|This report {{consists}} of two separate papers: Fernley Basin studies; and Influence of sediment supply and climate change on late Quaternary eolian accumulation patterns in the Mojave Desert. The first study involved geologic mapping of late Quaternary sediments and <b>lacustrine</b> <b>features</b> combined with precise control of elevations and descriptions of sediments {{for each of the}} major sedimentary units. The second paper documents the response of a major eolian sediment transport system in the east-central Mojave Desert: that which feeds the Kelso Dune field. Information from geomorphic, stratigraphic, and sedimentologic studies of eolian deposits and landforms is combined with luminescence dating of these deposits to develop a chronology of periods of eolian deposition. Both studies are related to site characterization studies of Yucca Mountain and the forecasting of rainfall patterns possible for the high-level radioactive waste repository lifetime...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Today, a 34 m global {{equivalent}} water layer (GEL) {{lies in the}} Martian polar-layered {{deposits and}} shallow ground ice. During the Amazonian, 3 m was outgassed, and 31 m was lost to space and to the surface, leaving 62 m {{at the end of}} Hesperian. During the Hesperian, volcanic outgassing added 5 m, 7 m was lost, and 40 m GEL of groundwater was added to form outflow channels, leaving 24 m carryover of surface water from the Noachian into the Hesperian. The Hesperian budget is incompatible with a northern ocean during this era. These figures are for near-surface water; substantial amounts of water may have existed as deep ground ice and groundwater. Our estimate of approximately 24 m near-surface water in the Late Noachian is insufficient to support an ocean at that time also and favors episodic melting of an icy highlands to produce the fluvial and <b>lacustrine</b> <b>features.</b> 1...|$|E
40|$|Carbon dioxide is an {{essential}} atmospheric component in martian climate models that attempt to reconcile a faint young sun with planetwide evidence of liquid water in the Noachian and Early Hesperian. In this study, we use mineral and contextual sedimentary environmental data measured by the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Rover Curiosity to estimate the atmospheric partial pressure of CO_ 2 (P_(CO 2)) coinciding with a long-lived lake system in Gale Crater at ∼ 3. 5 Ga. A reaction–transport model that simulates mineralogy observed within the Sheepbed member at Yellowknife Bay (YKB), by coupling mineral equilibria with carbonate precipitation kinetics and rates of sedimentation, indicates atmospheric P_(CO 2) levels in the 10 s mbar range. At such low P_(CO 2) levels, existing climate models are unable to warm Hesperian Mars anywhere near the freezing point of water, and other gases are required to raise atmospheric pressure to prevent lake waters from being lost to the atmosphere. Thus, either <b>lacustrine</b> <b>features</b> of Gale formed in a cold environment by a mechanism yet to be determined, or the climate models still lack {{an essential}} component that would serve to elevate surface temperatures, at least locally, on Hesperian Mars. Our results also impose restrictions on the potential role of atmospheric CO_ 2 in inferred warmer conditions and valley network formation of the late Noachian...|$|E
40|$|The Hot Spring {{limestone}} is a shallow-water algal carbonate {{within a}} late Tertiary transgressive lacustrine sequence exposed {{in the southwestern}} Snake River Plain. This 5 m thick lensoid sequence crops out over an 80 km 2 area that closely approximates original areal extent of nearshore carbonate accumulation. Reefal bodies consist of closely packed algal cylinders, several decimeters in height, each of which includes a dense laminated carbonate wall surrounding porous digitate carbonate that radiates outward and upward from one or more hollow tubes. These coalesce upsection into separate vertical columns several meters in diameter. Moderately well-sorted terrigenous and molluscan debris deposited between columns during growth indicates these structures were resistant to wave erosion and, therefore, were true reefs. Thick rings of littoral carbonate surrounding the upper walls of each column record {{the final stages of}} reef development. Structural attributes exhibited by these Miocene carbonate bodies are also common to a number of Tertiary and Quaternary algal buildups reported from other <b>lacustrine</b> settings. Although <b>features</b> within the Hot Spring limestone are complex in gross morphology and structural detail, both columnar reefs and algal cylinders display little variation in size, shape, or internal structure between areas of varying water depth and wave energy, thus reflecting the importance of biological processes as well as physical processes during reef development...|$|R
40|$|Th e {{relative}} importance of agricultural land retirement on water quality and aquatic-community health was investigated in the Minnesota River Basin. Eighty-two sites, with drainage areas ranging from 4. 3 to 2200 km 2, were examined for nutrient concentrations, measures of aquatic-community health (e. g., fi sh index of biotic integrity [IBI] scores), and environmental factors (e. g., drainage area and amount of agricultural land retirement). Th e relation of proximity of agricultural land retirement to the stream was determined by calculating the land retirement percent in various riparian zones. Spearman’s rho results indicated that IBI score was not correlated to the percentage of agricultural land retirement at the basin scale (p = 0. 070); however, IBI score was correlated to retired land percentage in the 50 - to 400 -m riparian zones surrounding the streams (p < 0. 05), indicating that riparian agricultural land retirement may have more infl uence on aquatic-community health than does agricultural land retirement in upland areas. Multivariate analysis of covariance and analysis of covariance models indicated that other environmental factors (such as drainage area and <b>lacustrine</b> and palustrine <b>features)</b> commonly were correlated to aquatic-community health measures, as were in-stream factors (standard deviation of water depth and substrate type). Th ese results indicate that although agricultural land retirement is signifi cantly related to fi sh communities {{as measured by the}} IBI scores, a combination of basin, riparian, and in-stream factors act together to infl uence IBI scores...|$|R
40|$|Kaitorete Spit {{is a mixed}} {{sand and}} gravel barrier beach complex that {{is located at the}} northeastern end of the Canterbury Bight. Kaitorete Spit was {{examined}} during this study using a combination of ground penetrating radar surveys, sedimentological and geomorphological examinations of the barrier beach complex. The geomorphology formed on Kaitorete has developed in three different environments. At the northeastern end of Kaitorete low elevation spit recurves are formed. South of these are numerous parallel beach ridges, formed by the tops of prograded storm berms. <b>Lacustrine</b> geomorphic <b>features</b> have developed over the marine geomorphology. Small scale cuspate ridges have formed in shallow lake water and associated with lake bottom sediments. Lacustrine beach ridges, lacustrine beach ridge plains and lacustrine spit complexes all formed along the shore of a higher lake. Nine different radar facies were found developed in the radar profiles collected on Kaitorete Spit. The facies are defined {{on the basis of their}} internal reflector patterns. Generally, the reflector patterns could be predicted by interpreting the geomorphic features over which the radar profiles ran. Three of the radar facies revealed reflector patterns that could not be predicted using geomorphology alone. At the eastern end of Kaitorete Spit, the radar profiles revealed that the marine spit recurves comprise a spit beach overlying a spit platform. It also reveals that the distal end of the spit platform was reworked by tidal currents into a series of seaward prograding foresets. The radar profiles also revealed that immediately the barrier beach reached the edge of the spit platform, a rise in the elevation of the beach crest occurred due to an increase in the wave energy expended on the beach. In the centre of the barrier beach complex the radar profiles revealed that two long overwash barriers developed, which fill two long (up to 12 km), thin lake outlet lagoons. These lagoons developed as a result of breaching due to a large river overfilling the lake basin. After the initial breach, the longshore drift and lake outflow developed a dynamic equilibrium, resulting in the progressive eastward dislocation of the outlet mouth. The large volume of lake water acted to buffer the high flows of the river thereby, maintaining flow conditions at the outlet channel which were conducive to lagoon elongation. Associated with the lacustrine spit complexes are scarp-like ridges which have steep reflectors which dip away from the lake. These developed in a similar way to shore-parallel bars, with material moving up the stoss side and avalanching down the lee side. The combined application of ground penetrating radar and geomorphology reveals a much more complete geological history of an area where outcrop is sparse...|$|R
40|$|Carbon dioxide is an {{essential}} atmospheric component in martian climate models that attempt to reconcile a faint young sun with widespread evidence of liquid water at the planet's surface in the Noachian and Early Hesperian. Current estimates of ancient martian CO levels, derived from global inventories of carbon, and orbital detections of Noachian and Early Hesperian clay mineralbearing terrains indicate CO levels that are unable to support warm and wet conditions. These estimates are subject to various sources of uncertainty however. Mineral and contextual sedimentary environmental data collected by the Mars Science Laboratory rover Curiosity in Gale Crater provide a more direct means of estimating the atmospheric partial pressure of CO (P) coinciding with a long-lived lake system in Gale crater at approximately 3. 5 Ga. Results from a reaction transport model, which simulates mineralogy observed within the Sheepbed member at Yellowknife Bay by coupling mineral equilibria with carbonate precipitation kinetics and rates of sedimentation, indicate atmospheric levels in the 10 's mbar range. At such low P levels, climate models are unable to warm Hesperian Mars anywhere near the freezing point of water and other gases are required to raise atmospheric pressure to prevent lakes from boiling away. Thus, <b>lacustrine</b> <b>features</b> of Gale formed in a cold environment by a mechanism yet to be determined, or the climate models lack {{an essential}} component that would serve to elevate surface temperatures, at least temporally and/or locally, on Hesperian Mars.

40|$|The salar of Uyuni, in {{the central}} Bolivian Altiplano, is {{probably}} the larger salt pan in the world (10000 km 2). A 121 m deep well drilled {{in the central}} salar disclosed a complex evaporitic sequence of 12 salt crusts separated by 11 mud layers. In {{the lower half of}} the profile, thick halite beds alternate with thin mud layers. The mud layers thicken upwards and show clear <b>lacustrine</b> <b>features.</b> The thickness of the salt beds decreases markedly from the base upward. The bromine content of the halite ranges from 1. 3 to 10. 4 mg/kg. The halite does not originate from the evaporation of the dilute inflow waters of the Altiplano, which would lead to Br content of tens of mg/kg. The presence of halite of very low Br content (2 mg/kg) in gypsum diapir strongly suggests that most of the halite deposited at Uyuni originated from the leaching of ancient salt formations associated with the numerous gypsum diapirs of the Altiplano. The deep and thick halite beds were probably deposited in a playa lake, as suggested by their very low and fairly constant Br content (1. 6 - 2. 3 mg/kg) and by the abundance of detrital minerals. Thereafter, perennial salt lakes of increasing duration flooded the central Altiplano. Increasing amounts of dilute inflow waters of low Cl-/Br+ ratio and the exhaustion of diapiric halite lead to an increase of both the thickness of the lacustrine layers and of the bromine content of the salt crusts (5 - 10 mg/kg) deposited as the lakes dried up. Paleolake levels in the central Altiplano rose as those in the northern Altiplano (the Titicaca basin) were simultaneously falling. The progressive fluvial erosion of the threshold between the northern and the central Altiplano lowered the levels of the northern lakes and allowed more dilute waters of low Cl-/Br+ ratio to flood the central Altiplano. Therefore, both the thickness of lacustrine sediments and the bromine content of the salt crust increase to the present [...] . (D'après résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|The Nankai-Suruga Trough, lying {{immediately}} {{south of}} Japan’s densely populated and highly industrialised southern coastline, generates devastating great earthquakes (magnitude > 8). Intense shaking, crustal deformation and tsunami generation accompany these ruptures. Forecasting the hazards associated with future earthquakes along this > 700 km long fault requires a comprehensive understanding of past fault behaviour. While the region benefits {{from a long}} and detailed historical record, palaeoseismology {{has the potential to}} provide a longer-term perspective and additional insights. Here, we summarise the current state of knowledge regarding geological evidence for past earthquakes and tsunamis, incorporating literature originally published in both Japanese and English. This evidence comes {{from a wide variety of}} sources, including uplifted marine terraces and biota, marine and <b>lacustrine</b> turbidites, liquefaction <b>features,</b> subsided marshes and tsunami deposits in coastal lakes and lowlands. We enhance available results with new age modelling approaches. While publications describe proposed evidence from > 70 sites, only a limited number provide compelling, well-dated evidence. The best available records allow us to map the most likely rupture zones of eleven earthquakes occurring during the historical period. Our spatiotemporal compilation suggests the AD 1707 earthquake ruptured almost the full length of the subduction zone and that earthquakes in AD 1361 and 684 were predecessors of similar magnitude. Intervening earthquakes were of lesser magnitude, highlighting variability in rupture mode. Recurrence intervals for ruptures of the a single seismic segment range from less than 100 to more than 450 years during the historical period. Over longer timescales, palaeoseismic evidence suggests intervals ranging from 100 to 700 years. However, these figures reflect thresholds of evidence creation and preservation as well as genuine recurrence intervals. At present, we have not identified any geological data that support the occurrence earthquakes of larger magnitude than that experienced in AD 1707; however, few published studies seek to establish the relative magnitudes of different earthquake and tsunami events. Alongside the paucity of research designed to quantify the magnitude of past earthquakes, we emphasise a number of other issues, including alternative hypotheses for proposed palaeoseismic evidence, the lack of robust chronological frameworks and insufficient appreciation of changing thresholds of evidence creation and preservation over time. These key issues must be addressed by future research...|$|R
