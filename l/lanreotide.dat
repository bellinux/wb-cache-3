50|$|No single {{treatment}} is effective for all patients. Treatment should be individualized depending on patient characteristics, {{such as age}} and tumor size.

If surgery does not normalize hormone levels or a relapse occurs, a doctor will usually begin additional drug therapy. The current first choice is generally octreotide or <b>lanreotide.</b> However, bromocriptine or cabergoline are much cheaper and easier to administer. With both types of medication, long-term therapy is necessary because their withdrawal can lead to rising GH levels and tumor re-expansion.

All patients had been treated with <b>lanreotide</b> (30 mg) for at least 3 months before study entry and had a mean GH level less than 10 ng/ml after at least 4 subsequent im injections every 14 d (48 %), 10 d (32 %), or 7 d (20 %). Treatment was switched from <b>lanreotide</b> 30 mg injected every 14, 10, or 7 d to 60, 90, or 120 mg <b>lanreotide</b> Autogel, respectively, every 28 d. After three fixed dose injections of <b>lanreotide</b> Autogel, mean <b>lanreotide</b> levels were similar to those obtained at steady state with <b>lanreotide</b> 30 mg. During <b>lanreotide</b> Autogel treatment, the control of acromegalic symptoms was comparable with that previously achieved during <b>lanreotide</b> 30 mg treatment. After 3 injections of <b>lanreotide</b> Autogel, mean GH (2. 87 +/- 0. 22 ng/ml) and IGF-I (317 +/- 15 ng/ml) values were comparable with those recorded at the end of <b>lanreotide</b> 30 mg treatment (GH, 2. 82 +/- 0. 19 ng/ml; IGF-I, 323 +/- 16 ng/ml). GH levels below 2. 5 ng/ml and age-/sex-normalized IGF-I were achieved in 33 % and 39 % of patients during <b>lanreotide</b> 30 mg and <b>lanreotide</b> Autogel treatment, respectively. Diarrhea, abdominal pain, and nausea were reported by 38 %, 22 %, and 18 % of patients during <b>lanreotide</b> 30 mg treatment and by 29 %, 17 %, and 9 % of patients, respectively, during <b>lanreotide</b> Autogel treatment.

The objective {{of this study was to}} develop a pharmacokinetic model for the sustained-release formulation <b>lanreotide</b> Autogel after deep subcutaneous administration in healthy subjects, and to explore the potential effect of covariates, especially sex and dose. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This was an open-label, single-centre, randomized, dose-ranging, parallel-group study, with a follow-up period of 4 - 7 months following drug administration in healthy subjects. Healthy Caucasian subjects aged 18 - 45 years were included. Subjects received a rapid intravenous bolus of 7 microg/kg of an immediate-release formulation of <b>lanreotide</b> (<b>lanreotide</b> IRF). After a 3 -day washout period, participants were randomized to receive a single deep subcutaneous injection of <b>lanreotide</b> Autogel at a dose of 60, 90 or 120 mg. PHARMACOKINETIC AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Blood samples for <b>lanreotide</b> determination were obtained during the first 12 hours after the intravenous bolus injection and during the 4 - to 7 -month follow-up period after deep subcutaneous administration of <b>lanreotide</b> Autogel. Data after intravenous and subcutaneous administration were fitted simultaneously using the population approach in NONMEM((R)) version VI software. The model was validated externally using data from patients with acromegaly. RESULTS: In total, 50 healthy subjects (24 women and 26 men) received a single intravenous dose of <b>lanreotide</b> IRF. Of these, 38 subjects (18 women and 20 men) received a single subcutaneous dose of <b>lanreotide</b> Autogel 3 days after intravenous <b>lanreotide</b> IRF. The disposition of <b>lanreotide</b> was described by a three-compartment open model. The estimates of the total volume of distribution and serum clearance were 15. 1 L and 23. 1 L/h, respectively.

Approximately one-third of these tumors {{are associated with}} characteristic hormonal syndromes like flushing and diarrhea in carcinoid syndrome. Most GEPNETs express receptors for somatostatin. The somatostatin analogs octreotide and <b>lanreotide</b> constituted a major therapeutic advance in palliating hypersecretion syndromes. <b>Lanreotide</b> autogel is a viscous aqueous solution of <b>lanreotide</b> that is usually administered deep subcutaneously every 4 weeks, but extended dosing intervals have also been proposed. In recent years, increasing evidence has supported the use of somatostatin analogs (SSA) as antitumor agents. In the double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase III CLARINET trial, <b>lanreotide</b> autogel 120 mg every 4 weeks {{was associated with a}} significant prolongation of progression-free survival in patients with nonfunctioning GEPNETs, with a Ki- 67 of < 10 %.

The first preparations of somatostatin analogs available for clinical use were administered subcutaneously two or three times daily, which was not optimal with respect to patient compliance. The introduction of long-acting formulations of somatostatin analogs has overcome this inconvenience. <b>Lanreotide</b> Autogel, a new viscous, supersaturated, aqueous solution of <b>lanreotide,</b> is available in a prefilled syringe and administered by deep subcutaneous injection every 28 days. <b>Lanreotide</b> Autogel has different pharmacokinetic properties from the earlier <b>lanreotide</b> slow-release (SR) formulation, which may account for its better tolerability. Furthermore, <b>lanreotide</b> Autogel is at least as efficacious as the other somatostatin analogs in lowering growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1) levels in the majority and in restoring safe GH and age-normalized IGF- 1 levels in about 50 - 60 % of patients with acromegaly.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Macroadenomas causing {{acromegaly}} are cured surgically in {{only around}} 50 % of patients. Primary medical treatment with somatostatin analogues {{has been suggested}} to be a means of treating patients with a potentially poor surgical outcome. Previous retrospective studies have also suggested that surgical debulking of pituitary tumours causing acromegaly improves control by somatostatin analogues. No prospective study using <b>lanreotide</b> {{has been carried out}} thus far to assess whether this is the case. OBJECTIVE: We carried out a prospective study to assess whether surgical debulking of pituitary macroadenomas causing acromegaly improved the subsequent control of acromegaly by the somatostatin analogue <b>lanreotide.</b> PATIENTS AND METHODS: We treated 26 consecutive patients [10 males and 16 females [...] median age 53. 5 years (range 22 - 70) ] with macroadenoma causing acromegaly unselected for somatostatin response for 16 weeks with <b>lanreotide,</b> maximizing GH and IGF-I suppression, if necessary, by incremental dosing. Surgical resection was carried out and the patients were re-assessed off medical treatment at 16 weeks following surgery.

40|$|Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (HCC) {{is increasing}} worldwide {{and is the}} third cause of cancer-related death. HCC develops in a preneoplastic organ, the cirrhotic liver. Therefore, chemoprevention could {{play a role in}} the management of HCC. We have previously shown that <b>lanreotide,</b> a somatostatin analogue, inhibits the development of "foci of altered hepatocytes", which represent very early neoplastic changes in rat liver. Here we induced bona fide HCC by means of a different chemically induced model that is known to lead to significant fibrosis before HCC appearance. <b>Lanreotide</b> was given from the beginning of the experiment in one group and from the time when significant fibrosis was present in the second group. <b>Lanreotide</b> decreased the frequency of occurrence of HCC in both groups. In both groups, significant decreases in hepatocyte proliferation and inhibition of fibrosis were demonstrated. When given at the start of the experiment, <b>lanreotide</b> dramatically decreased levels of angiogenic factors and enhanced apoptosis. Further work on the anti-tumoral effect of <b>lanreotide</b> is called for to assess the mechanistic relationships of its anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic actions on liver neoplastic cells...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Polycystic {{liver disease}} (PLD) is a phenotypical {{expression}} of autosomal dominant {{polycystic kidney disease}} and isolated polycystic liver disease. Somatostatin analogues, such as <b>lanreotide,</b> reduce polycystic liver volume. AIM: To establish long-term outcome and safety of <b>lanreotide.</b> METHODS: This was an open-label, observational extension study of a 6 -month, randomised, placebo-controlled trial with <b>lanreotide</b> (120 mg/month) in PLD. The length of total treatment was 12 months. Primary endpoint was relative change in liver volume, as determined by CT-volumetry after 12 months of treatment. We offered patients a CT scan 6 months after stopping <b>lanreotide.</b> RESULTS: A total of 41 / 54 (76 %) patients participated in the extension study. Liver volume decreased by 4 % (IQR - 8 % to - 1 %) after 12 months of treatment. The greatest effect was observed during the first 6 months of treatment (decrease of 4 % (IQR - 6 % to - 1 %)). Liver volume remained unchanged during the following 6 months. We found that liver volume increased by 4 % (IQR 0 - 6 %) 6 months after end of treatment (n = 22). CONCLUSIONS: <b>Lanreotide</b> reduces liver volume within the first 6 months of treatment and the beneficial effect is maintained in the following 6 months. Stopping results in recurrence of polycystic liver growth. This suggests that continuous use of <b>lanreotide</b> is needed to maintain its effect...|$|E
