25|$|Cruyff is {{sometimes}} {{described as a}} typical kind of ‘artist-footballer’ or ‘footballer-thinker’ who considers football, the so-called 'beautiful game', not a purely athletic/physical competition but an artistic-oriented mind-body game. Because of his distinctive footballing views, Cruyff was called ‘the Spinoza of football’ by some. He believed in a certain style of play, which {{has the power to}} put a smile on the people's faces as he described it. When Cruyff, both as a player and as a manager, spoke about football he often mentioned the entertainment value of the game, that there is more to it than winning. In a 2009 interview with Sportmails Martin Samuel, Arsène Wenger, as a devout follower of Cruyff's footballing ideology, once shared his opinion about football's artistic value, “I believe the target of anything in life should be to do it so well that it becomes an art. When you read some books they are fantastic, the writer touches something in you that you know you would not have brought out of yourself. He makes you discover something interesting in your life. If you are living <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>animal,</b> {{what is the point of}} living? What makes daily life interesting is that we try to transform it to something that is close to art. And football is like that. When I watch Barcelona, it is art.” , the author of Cruyff's French biography, called him ‘the greatest actor in the history of football’ because Cruyff was a glorious exception (possibly the only one ever) being the man who ‘played’ outstandingly well multiple roles in the world of football: player, manager, and thinker.|$|E

She completely withdrew from court life, public events, and theater. Throughout her widowhood, she spent the whole of August and the eighteenth of each month alone in her chamber, which negatively affected her mental health.

500|$|Thierrée was {{the only}} actor allowed to improvise. His {{characterisation}} of Taloche was built on spontaneity, and in many instances, Gatlif had no clue how he would act in a scene, such as in [...] the tap scene in which he plunges into a stairwell. In another scene, in which he dances with war music in the background, Thierrée pretended {{to make love to}} the earth <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>animal.</b> Gatlif, who had wanted the character {{to have the ability to}} [...] sense forthcoming danger, like animals often do, stated that Thierrée was suitable [...] for the role because he is very much an animal.

The song's chorus features Kills singing in a falsetto note. Writing for Consequence of Sound, Alex Young opined that the song discusses [...] "the duplicity of identity, hubris, and objectification". [...] "Not In Love" [...] is styled in electronica and influenced by acid house. AllMusic writer Jon O'Brien wrote that it [...] "provides a welcome respite from the album's constant floor-filling leanings".|$|E
500|$|At the hospital, Treves {{examined}} Merrick, {{observing that}} he was [...] "shy, confused, not a little frightened, and evidently much cowed." [...] At this point, Treves assumed that the Elephant Man was an [...] "imbecile". He measured Merrick's head circumference at the large size of , his right wrist at [...] {{and one of his}} fingers at [...] in circumference. He noted that his skin was covered in papillomata (warty growths), the largest of which exuded an unpleasant smell. The subcutaneous tissue appeared to be weakened and caused a loosening of the skin, which in some areas hung away from the body. There were bone deformities in the right arm, both legs, and, most conspicuously, in the large skull. Despite the corrective surgery to his mouth in 1882, Merrick's speech remained barely intelligible. His left arm and hand were not large and were not deformed. His penis and scrotum were normal. Apart from his deformities and the lameness in his hip, Treves concluded that Merrick appeared to be in good general health. Norman later recalled that Merrick went to the hospital for examination [...] "two or three" [...] times and during one of their meetings, Treves gave Merrick his calling card. On one of the visits, Treves had photographs taken, and he provided Merrick with a set of copies which were later added to his autobiographical pamphlet. On 2 December, Treves presented Merrick {{at a meeting of the}} Pathological Society of London in Bloomsbury. Eventually, Merrick told Norman that he no longer wanted to be examined at the hospital. According to Norman, he said he was [...] "stripped naked and felt <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>animal</b> in a cattle market." ...|$|E

Owls and opossums are often featured on hooded vessels.|$|E

2500|$|While he {{was based}} in West Berlin, Cave started working on {{what was to become}} his debut novel, And the Ass Saw the Angel (1989). Significant {{crossover}} is evident between the themes in the book and the lyrics Cave wrote in the late stages of the Birthday Party and the early stage of his solo career. [...] "Swampland", from Mutiny, in particular, uses the same linguistic stylings ('mah' for 'my', for instance) and some of the same themes (the narrator being haunted by the memory of a girl called Lucy, being hunted <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>animal,</b> approaching death and execution). On 21 January 2008, a special edition of Cave's novel And the Ass Saw the Angel was released. Cave's second novel The Death of Bunny Munro was published on 8 September 2009 by Harper Collins books. Telling the story of a sex-addicted salesman, it was also released as a binaural audio-book produced by British Artists Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard and an iPhone app. The book originally started as a screenplay Cave was going to write for John Hillcoat.|$|E

2500|$|According to Beauvoir, {{two factors}} explain the {{evolution}} of women's condition: participation in production and freedom from reproductive slavery. Beauvoir writes that motherhood left woman [...] "riveted to her body" [...] <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>animal</b> and {{made it possible for}} men to dominate her and Nature. She describes man's gradual domination of women, starting with the statue of a female Great Goddess found in Susa, and eventually the opinion of ancient Greeks like Pythagoras who wrote, [...] "There is a good principle that created order, light and man and a bad principle that created chaos, darkness and woman." [...] Men succeed in the world by transcendence, but immanence is the lot of women. Beauvoir writes that men oppress women when they seek to perpetuate the family and keep patrimony intact. She compares women's situation in ancient Greece with Rome. In Greece, with exceptions like Sparta where there were no restraints on women's freedom, women were treated almost like slaves. In Rome because men were still the masters, women enjoyed more rights but, still discriminated against {{on the basis of their}} gender, had only empty freedom.|$|E
2500|$|A {{man called}} Henry Taylor took Sara Baartman to France, from around September 1814. Taylor then sold {{her to an}} animal trainer, S. Réaux, who {{exhibited}} her under more pressured conditions for fifteen months at the Palais Royal. In France she was in effect enslaved. In Paris, her exhibition became more clearly entangled with scientific racism. French scientists were curious about whether she had the elongated labia which earlier naturalists such as François Levaillant had purportedly observed in Khoisan at the Cape. French naturalists, among them Georges Cuvier, head keeper of the menagerie at the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle,and founder of the discipline of comparative anatomy visited her. She {{was the subject of}} several scientific paintings at the Jardin du Roi, where she was examined in March 1815: as Saint-Hilaire and Frédéric Cuvier, a younger brother of Georges, reported, [...] "she was obliging enough to undress and to allow herself to be painted in the nude." [...] This was not literally true: although by his standards she appeared to be naked, in accordance with her own cultural norms of modesty throughout these sessions she wore a small apron-like garment which concealed her genitalia. [...] She steadfastly refused to remove this even when offered money by one of the attending scientists. In Paris, Baartman's promoters didn't need to concern themselves with slavery charges. Crais and Scully state: [...] "By the time she got to Paris, her existence was really quite miserable and extraordinarily poor. Sara was literally treated <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>animal.</b> There is some evidence to suggest that at one point a collar was placed around her neck." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 1934 Abe {{was arrested}} in a police raid on the {{unlicensed}} brothel at which she {{was working at the}} time. Kinnosuke Kasahara, a well-connected friend of the brothel owner, arranged for her release. He was attracted to Abe, finding that she had no debts, and with Abe's agreement, made her his mistress. Kasahara set up a house for Abe on December 20, 1934, and also provided her with an income. In his deposition to the police, he remembered, [...] "She was really strong, a real powerful one. Even though I am pretty jaded, she was enough to astound me. She wasn't satisfied unless we did it two, three, or four times a night. To her, it was unacceptable unless I had my hand on her private parts all night long... At first it was great, but after a couple of weeks I got a little exhausted." [...] When Abe suggested that Kasahara leave his wife to marry her, he refused. She then asked Kasahara to allow her to take another lover, which he also refused to do. Afterwards, their relationship ended, and to escape him Abe left for Nagoya. Kasahara ended his testimony with an angry remark about Abe, [...] "She is a slut and a whore. And as what she has done makes clear, she is a woman whom men should fear." [...] Likewise, Abe remembered Kasahara in less than flattering terms, saying, [...] "He didn't love me and treated me <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>animal.</b> He was the kind of scum who would then plead with me when I said that we should break up." ...|$|E
