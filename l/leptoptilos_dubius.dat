500|$|The greater {{adjutant}} (<b>Leptoptilos</b> <b>dubius)</b> is {{a member}} of the stork family, Ciconiidae. Its genus includes the lesser adjutant of Asia and the marabou stork of Africa. Once found widely across southern Asia, mainly in India but extending east to Borneo, the greater adjutant is now restricted to a much smaller range with only two small breeding populations; one in India with the largest colony in Assam and the other in Cambodia. Populations disperse after the breeding season. This large stork has a massive wedge-shaped bill, a bare head and a distinctive neck pouch. During the day, they soar in thermals along with vultures with whom they share the habit of scavenging. They feed mainly on carrion and offal; however, they are opportunistic and will sometimes prey on vertebrates. The English name is derived from their stiff [...] "military" [...] gait when walking on the ground. Large numbers once lived in Asia, but have declined greatly, possibly due to improved sanitation, to the point of being endangered. The total population in 2008 was estimated at around a thousand individuals. In the 19th century, they were especially common in the city of Calcutta, where they were referred to as the [...] "Calcutta adjutant". Known locally as hargila (derived from the Bengali words for [...] "bone-swallower") and considered to be unclean birds, they were largely left undisturbed but sometimes hunted for the use of their meat in folk medicine. Valued as scavengers, they were once used in the logo of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.|$|E

50|$|Bird species sighted in Thungyai include white-winged {{wood duck}} (Cairina scutulata), kalij {{pheasant}} (Lophura leucomelanos), grey peacock-pheasant (Polyplectron bicalcaratum), green peafowl (Pavo muticus), spot-billed pelican (Pelecanus philippensis), Oriental darter (Anhinga melanogaster), painted stork (Mycteria leucocephala), greater adjutant (<b>Leptoptilos</b> <b>dubius),</b> red-headed vulture (Sarcogyps calvus), mountain hawk-eagle (Nisaetus nipalensis), lesser fish eagle (Ichthyophaga humilis) and all six species of hornbill (Bucerotidae) living in mainland Southeast Asia.|$|E
5000|$|There are 500 {{species of}} {{bird in the}} region {{including}} the critically endangered and possibly extinct white-eyed river martin (Pseudochelidon sirintarae), the endemic grey-faced tit-babbler (Macronous kelleyi) and the endangered or threatened Bengal florican (Eupodotis bengalensis), greater adjutant (<b>Leptoptilos</b> <b>dubius)</b> and white-shouldered ibis (Pseudibis davisoni). Other birds of the remaining woodlands of the area include the silver pheasant (Lophura nycthemera), Siamese fireback (Lophura diardi), Mrs. Hume's pheasant (Syrmaticus humiae), grey peacock-pheasant (Polyplectron bicalcaratum), sarus crane (Grus antigone), great hornbill (Buceros bicornis), Austen's brown hornbill (Anorrhinus austeni), and wreathed hornbill (Aceros undulatus).|$|E
50|$|About 740 {{species of}} bird have been {{recorded}} in Laos. The only known endemic species is the bare-faced bulbul (Pycnonotus hualon). Globally endangered species {{that occur in the}} country include the white-winged duck (Cairina scutulata), green peafowl (Pavo muticus), greater adjutant (<b>Leptoptilos</b> <b>dubius),</b> white-shouldered ibis (Pseudibis davisoni), giant ibis (Pseudibis gigantea), masked finfoot (Heliopais personatus), Nordmann's greenshank (Tringa guttifer), black-bellied tern (Sterna acuticauda), collared laughingthrush (Trochalopteron yersini) and yellow-breasted bunting (Emberiza aureola), as well as four species of vulture; the red-headed vulture (Sarcogyps calvus), white-rumped vulture (Gyps bengalensis), Indian vulture (Gyps indicus) and slender-billed vulture (Gyps tenuirostris).|$|E
50|$|The garuda, biologically {{known as}} greater {{adjutant}} (<b>Leptoptilos</b> <b>dubius),</b> {{is classified as}} endangered on the IUCN Red List 2004 of threatened species and listed under Schedule IV of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. This huge stork has a naked pink head, a very thick yellow bill and a low-hanging neck pouch. The neck ruff is white. The bird looks like a vulture. Other than the pale grey edge on each wing, {{the rest of the}} greater adjutant's body is dark grey. Juveniles have a narrower bill, thicker down on the head and neck, and entirely dark wings. A Garuda bird measures 145-150 cm (about three feet) in length and four to five feet in height.|$|E
50|$|The park {{is home to}} {{a variety}} of migratory birds, water birds, predators, {{scavengers}} and game birds. 47 families of Anatidae, Accipitridae, Addenda and Ardeiae are found in the park with maximum number of species. 222 species of birds have so far been recorded, some of which are: spot-billed pelican (Pelicanus philippensis), great white pelican, black-necked stork (Ephippiorhynchus asiaticus), greater adjutant stork (<b>Leptoptilos</b> <b>dubius),</b> lesser adjutant stork (Leptoptilos javanicus), ruddy shelduck (Tadorna ferruginea), gadwall (Anas strepera), brahminy duck, mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), pintail (Anas acuta), hornbills, Pallas's fish eagle (Haliaeetus leucoryphus), king fisher and woodpecker, in addition to forest and grassland birds. But Bengal florican (Houbaropsis bengalensis), which is in the threatened list of IUCN is one of the flagship species in the park with a population 30-40 (recorded second highest concentration as per Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS)) and is in the threatened list of IUCN. Migratory birds as far as from America such as the milky American white pelicans have also been reported in the park.|$|E
50|$|L. robustus {{most likely}} had a slender body {{characteristic}} of extant members of Leptoptilos, but was much larger in body size and height, with individuals reaching up {{to at least}} 1.8 meters (about 6 feet) tall and weighing approximately 16 kilograms (36 lb). From Liang Bua, fragments of a left ulna, left carpometacarpus, left tibiotarsus, and a nearly complete left femur were discovered and described in 2010. In 2013, {{the tip of a}} maxilla, a left and right prosimal scapula, two furculae, a humeral and ulnar, a right proximal radius, two right ossi carpi radiales, a right femur, four phalanges and long bone fragments were additionally discovered and described. The bone fragments found of this species were indicative of its large size when compared to skeletal measurements from the extant species, <b>Leptoptilos</b> <b>dubius.</b> Due to having heavy bones and a heavy body it is assumed that it rarely, if ever, flew. The thick walled tibiotarsus, constituting the thickest of all other extant and extinct Leptoptilini species, is an unusual feature for flying birds which usually selects for minimum mass. As well as heavier than normal bone structure, measured size ratios suggested that it may have had reduced forelimbs and therefore flight capabilities. The body size was similar in dimension to L. dubius, with the exception of its tibiotarsus. However, the fragmentary nature of the ulna and the carpometacarpus found do not allow an accurate estimate of wingspan length and the question {{as to whether or not}} L. robustus could fly is currently unknown.|$|E
