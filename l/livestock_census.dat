Stating the above, the author was of the opinion that according to all resources, the number of livestock should have increased, and not only in number. He, in fact, suggested that the number of some species should have been reduced, and that noble breeds with significantly higher yield of milk and meat should have been imported. He also thought the number of goats should have been reduced as much as possible. Although the writings were colored by regret for numerical decline in livestock production in BiH, the author pointed out how humans should have realized that the smaller the livestock, the more material benefits through better food (cultivation of fodder), better breeding conditions and modern breeds. This required cheap loans to the farmers for fodder production, building barns, procurement of noble breeds, etc. Key words: livestock, Bosnia and Herzegovina</p...|$|R

The analysis covers activities linked to the collection of <b>livestock</b> <b>census</b> data and its application within the veterinary services. 92 % of the 38 responding countries conduct <b>livestock</b> <b>census,</b> of which 18 follow scheduled programmes.

There was no apparent relationship between absence of legislation, failure to collect tax on livestock (67 %) and the frequency to conduct census. The responsibilities to develop census methods, conduct the actual census, and archiving the information was equally shared between the central statistics authorities and veterinary services.

30|$|The many {{number of}} cows {{at the village}} is {{attributed}} to the wetlands that have grass and cyperus papyrus that the animals feed on throughout the year.

But this is nothing compared the fear of loss of their property (in this case, cows and land).

40|$|The Census of Agriculture {{provides}} a continuing historical {{record of what}} has happened on New York State farms and its wider rural economy. The purpose of this report is to provide readily accessible information on basic historical facts about agriculture in New York State such as land in farms, numbers of farms, acreage of major crops and numbers of <b>livestock</b> for <b>census</b> years dating back to 1992. Census results for 2007 show that 24 percent (7. 5 million acres) of the State’s land area was in farms. This acreage is roughly equal to the land in farms reported in the early 1990 s but far below the peak acreage in the early 1900 s. Much of the land formerly in farms has reverted to forest or brush. Total cropland in 2007 was 4. 31 million acres of which 79 percent was harvested. Some of these results trace to data adjustments made in conjunction with the 2002 and 2007 census tabulations. These adjustments accounted for under enumeration and helped boost harvested cropland acreage above levels reported in the late 1980 s. Looking at farm numbers, New York has not shared in the 2002 - 2007 net increase in farm numbers reported nationally by the USDA for this decade; New York is among 11 states with net farm decreases between 2002 and 2007. This information must be interpreted with care because of important structural changes in acquisition, management, and reporting of census data in the last decade. Current census procedures involve USDA determinations on potential crop/ livestock commodity sales, along with the practice of counting participants in federal conservation programs as farms, if federal payments are sufficient to meet the $ 1, 000 threshold required to qualify such a unit as a farm. In 2007, nearly 10, 000 New York farms (27 % of all farms) had commodity sales below $ 1, 000 during the census year. The comparable percentage for the entire US is 31 %.

40|$|Livestock {{represents}} {{an important component}} of the agricultural sector in Pakistan especially Sindh. Indeed, crop and livestock activities are, to a great extent, interdependent upon each other, for their functioning within the farm sector. The latter provides inputs like farm yard manure (FYM) and draught power for the crop sector and, in turn uses fodder, crop products and residues. The present study has, therefore been undertaken to see the trend and growth rates of cattle, buffaloes, sheep, goats, and camels in Sindh during 1955 to 1996 livestock censuses. The study uses the <b>livestock</b> <b>census</b> data for 1955, 1960, 1972, 1976, 1986, and 1996. The study reveals that the population of cattle, buffaloes, sheep, goats, and camels has become steadily more important in the livestock economy of Sindh during the last two <b>livestock</b> <b>census</b> as compared to other provinces. The two types of livestock that showed relatively high growth rates over the four decades (1955 - 1996) are goats and sheep; the cattle, camels and buffaloes recorded relatively low growth rates. The highest number of cattle, sheep, goats and camels in Tharparkar are mainly glaring because the valley of Nagarparkar is richer in vegetable growth, which supports these types of livestock.

This calculation {{was based on the}} mass flow of total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN). The analysis was performed for all 15 geographical regions in Chile. The definition of livestock subcategories was based on data from the Chilean Agriculture and Forestry Census as well as technical reports published by the Chilean National Statistics Institute. Significant differences were observed among the sources of livestock emissions in Chile's regions, and there was high variability depending on the degree of livestock confinement. In 2013, the total calculated emissions were 69. 1 kt NH 3 /year (± 31. 1). The O’Higgins Region had the highest NH 3 emissions in Chile, representing 45 % of the total. In terms of livestock production, 45 % of the emissions were generated by pigs, 22 % by poultry, 16 % by cattle, 11 % by equines and 4 % by sheep. Emissions from the TAN that was available during manure and slurry management and the degree of animal confinement were the primary sources of uncertainty.

He also describes the [...] "rich and luxuriant" [...] nature around the [...] "Sung-kee-na" [...] mountains (i.e., Mount Songino Khairkhan). Before Khalkha Mongolian nobles went and pledged allegiance to the Manchu emperor at Dolon Nor (formerly Kublai Khan's summer capital Xanadu) in 1691, the area of present-day Ulaanbaatar was under the control of Tusheet Khan Chakhundorj the brother of Zanabazar. In 1691 Chakhundorj's eldest son Galdandorj was given the title Jun Wang at Dolon Nor and given the area of present-day Ulaanbaatar. From that time onwards it became a clearly demarcated hereditary princedom called the Darkhan Chin Wangiin Khoshuu (Banner of the Darkhan Chin Wang). The Banner was centered on Mount Bogd Khan Uul and its boundaries are described in historical records of the period. Galdandorj (1691-1692) was the first Darkhan Chin Wang. His successors are: his eldest son Dondovdorj (1692-1743), Rinchendorj (1743-1755), Khajivdorj (1757-1759), Gejeedorj (1759-1771), Tsevdendorj (1771-1774), Sundevdorj (1774-1798), Nyambuudorj (1799-1832) all the way till Darkhan Chin Wang Puntsagtseren (1914-1921). Starting from 1728 till 1921 the 21 banners of Tusheet Khan Aimag held the [...] "Khan Uuliin Chuulgan" [...] (Assembly of Khan Uul) every three years at the north side of Mount Bogd Khan Uul, the site of Ulaanbaatar. The Assembly discussed {{a wide range of issues}} including finances, military <b>census,</b> <b>livestock</b> tax and legal issues. There were 26 Presidents of the Khan Uul Assembly starting from Tusheet Khan Vanjildorj (1728-1732) till Puntsagtseren (1914-1921). There were also a total 30 Deputy Presidents or Speakers. The 2nd Jebtsundamba Khutuktu was born at Mount Songinokhairkhan in present-day Ulaanbaatar in 1724 as the son of Darkhan Chin Wang Dondovdorj and Tsagaan Dari Bayart. Dondovdorj carried the titles Jun Wang, Darkhan Chin Wang, Khoshoi Chin Wang and Efu and also sat on the Tusheet Khan throne for two years (1700-1702). He played a part in bringing Urga inside his banner territory. From 1733 to 1743 he was both the Said (Minister-governor) of Urga and the President of the Khan Uul Assembly. One of his wives was Amarlingui Hichiyengui the 6th daughter of the Kangxi Emperor whom he received in marriage in 1697. Her tomb the Gunj Temple (1740) is partially intact in the forests north-east of Ulaanbaatar. Dondovdorj, an accomplished poet, composed the song [...] "Tumen Ekh" [...] praising a race horse. In 1696 Zanabazar and the Khalkha Mongolian nobles returned from Dolon Nor and camped at the north side of Mount Bogd Khan Uul. The gorge where khans and princes camped was called Tur Khurakhyn Am (State Gathering Gorge) while the one where monks and abbots camped was named Shajin Khurakhyn Am (Religion Gathering Gorge). Nobles and lamas continued to meet at this place for the next 330 years. Nukhtiin Am, on the south of Ulaanbaatar, was where Zanabazar (1635-1723) consecrated and meditated under a tree called Janchivsembe, the shadow of which was used to choose the location of Gandan Monastery in 1838.|$|R

To {{assess the}} risk of (zoonotic) disease {{transmission}} in developing countries, decision makers generally rely on dis-tribution estimates of animals from survey records or projections of historical enumeration results. Given {{the high cost of}} large-scale surveys, the sample size is often restricted and the accuracy of estimates is therefore low, especially when spatial high-resolution is applied. This study explores possibilities of improving the accuracy of livestock distribution maps with-out additional samples using spatial modelling based on regression tree forest models, developed using subsets of the Uganda 2008 <b>Livestock</b> <b>Census</b> data, and several covariates. The accuracy of these spatial models as well as the accuracy of an ensemble of a spatial model and direct estimate was compared to direct estimates and “true ” livestock figures based on the entire dataset. The new approach is shown to effectively increase the livestock estimate accuracy (median relative error decrease of 0. 166 - 0. 037 for total sample sizes of 80 - 1, 600 animals, respectively). This outcome suggests that the accuracy levels obtained with direct estimates can indeed be achieved with lower sample sizes and the multimodel approach present-ed here, indicating a more efficient use of financial resources...|$|E

It has also been verified that among all human activities, the one with most impact to the environment is agriculture. However, according to the Census of 1980, 1991 and 2001, the population increase was balanced, not having great influence on the increase of deforestation in the region, it can posibly be caused by the increase in number and extension of agricultural establishments.

40|$|To {{assess the}} risk of (zoonotic) disease {{transmission}} in developing countries, decision makers generally rely on distribution estimates of animals from survey records or projections of historical enumeration results. Given {{the high cost of}} large-scale surveys, the sample size is often restricted and the accuracy of estimates is therefore low, especially when spatial high-resolution is applied. This study explores possibilities of improving the accuracy of livestock distribution maps without additional samples using spatial modelling based on regression tree forest models, developed using subsets of the Uganda 2008 <b>Livestock</b> <b>Census</b> data, and several covariates. The accuracy of these spatial models as well as the accuracy of an ensemble of a spatial model and direct estimate was compared to direct estimates and “true” livestock figures based on the entire dataset. The new approach is shown to effectively increase the livestock estimate accuracy (median relative error decrease of 0. 166 - 0. 037 for total sample sizes of 80 - 1, 600 animals, respectively). This outcome suggests that the accuracy levels obtained with direct estimates can indeed be achieved with lower sample sizes and the multimodel approach presented here, indicating a more efficient use of financial resource...|$|E
40|$|We qualitatively {{describe}} {{the condition of}} communally managed rangelands in the Transkei, South Africa, using GIS and high resolution near-infrared imagery. Using <b>livestock</b> <b>census</b> data from 28 magisterial districts in the Transkei, we explored the trends in livestock biomass from 1923 – 1998. The area had been subjected to intensive herbivory by domestic livestock during that period, and the high livestock biomass had been blamed for the perceived degradation or ‘overgrazing’ of the region. Our assessment used the concept rain-use efficiency (RUE) (kg dry matter ha– 1 mm– 1) {{to determine whether there}} is evidence of change in the efficiency of the system to produce domestic livestock. We calculated RUE from annual livestock numbers and the mean annual rainfall for each district. We found no evidence of a decline in rain-use efficiency between the two assessment periods (1923 – 1944, 1945 – 1998). There was evidence of a shift in the ratio of sheep to goats between 1923 and 1998, with goat numbers increasing (greater than twofold) relative to sheep in eight districts. This trend may be associated with changes in the structure of vegetation. We conclude that this region is not showing evidence of system run down that affects domestic livestock production...|$|E
40|$|Dairying {{has become}} an {{important}} secondary {{source of income for}} more than 15 million rural families and has assumed an important role in providing employment and income generating opportunity for the most vulnerable sections of our population. For millions of small and marginal farmers as well as landless labourers, milk production provides ready cash in hand for fulfilling their daily household requirements. According to 2012 <b>livestock</b> <b>census</b> data, Gujarat had 9984 thousand cattle and 10386 thousand buffalo population. The daily milk yield per animal in the state for Cow (Crossbreed), Cow (indigenous) and Buffalo is around 9. 08 kg/day, 4. 19 kg/day & 5. 15 kg/day respectively. The present study was conducted to evaluate the status of Medium Milk Producers in Gujarat state. The study covered all districts of the state and information was collected by using questionnaire. After analyzing the collected data it could be seen that there is enormous opportunity to develop indigenous cattle as it is more suitable to our environment. Further, it can be concluded that the major characteristics of Medium dairy farmers were- “Mixed Farming” is being practiced by significant number of respondents, irrigation facility and educational background of SSC to Post graduation. The main weakness observed was low milk yield lack of awareness of clean milk Production and Scientific Animal Husbandry practices...|$|E
30|$|Cow dung is {{the major}} source of biogas or gobar gas {{production}} in India. The total population of female cows in India is 190.90 million out of which 151 million are indigenous whilst 39 million are crossbreed (<b>Livestock</b> <b>Census</b> 2012). Cow dung generated from 3 – 5  cattle/day can run a simple 8 – 10  m 3 biogas plant which is able to produce 1.5 – 2  m 3 biogas per day which is sufficient for the family 6 – 8 persons, can cook meal for 2 or 3 times or may light two lamps for 3  h or run a refrigerator for all day and can also operate a 3 -KW motor generator for 1  h (Werner et al. 1989). A 1 -m 3 biogas plant has produced 28.78  l/kg (0.028  m 3) and 32.76  l/kg (0.032  m 3) of biogas respectively when daily feed with 22  kg of dung/m 3 which is mixed with equal amount of water with 9 – 10  % of total solids. The maximum production of biogas from that plant is 39.00  l/kg (0.039  m 3) and 40.04  l/kg (0.04  m 3) respectively when operated at the temperature of 23.5  °C (Kalia and Singh 2004). On the other hand, farmer also gains 13.87 metric tons of organic fertiliser per year from the biogas plant. This co-production of biofertiliser also allow farmer to recover the initial investment for setting up of a biogas plant (Sharma 2011).|$|E
