This study aims to find out the correlation between community resilience on <b>long-termed</b> community coping post-earthquake of May 26, 2006. Predictor variable {{in this study is}} community resilience, and the criterium variable is <b>long-termed</b> community coping. The instruments used in this study consisted of Community Coping Scale is modification of the Community Well-Being Scale developed by (Prawitasari et al., 2009; Prawitasari, 2011), and Community Resilience Scale developed by Researcher. This research was held in the earthquake affected areas in Klaten. Data were collected from 60 respondents (34 males and 26 females); age ranges from 15 - 78  years old. Reliability test with Alpha Cronbach indicates both instruments were reliable (αCCS= 0. 930; αCRS= 0. 925). This study hypothesized that there is a correlation between community resilience and <b>long-termed</b> community coping post-earthquake. Pearson-Product Moment Correlation Analysis was used to analyze the data.

5|$|Depending {{upon the}} risk for DVT, {{different}} preventive measures are recommended. Walking and calf exercises reduce venous stasis because leg muscle contractions compress the veins and pump blood up towards the heart. In immobile individuals, physical compression methods improve blood flow. Anticoagulation, which {{increases the risk of}} bleeding, might be used in high-risk scenarios. The risk of major bleeding with <b>long-term</b> anticoagulation is about 3% per year, and the point where annual VTE risk is thought to warrant <b>long-term</b> anticoagulation is estimated to be between 3 and 9%. Usually, only when individuals exceed a 9% annual VTE risk is <b>long-term</b> anticoagulation a common consideration. Antithrombin deficiency, a strong or moderately strong risk factor, carries an annual risk of VTE of only 0.8–1.5%; as such, asymptomatic individuals with thrombophilia do not warrant <b>long-term</b> anticoagulation.|$|E

5|$|A {{growing body}} of {{research}} suggests that self-control is akin to a muscle that can be strengthened through practice. In other words, self-control abilities are malleable, a fact that can be a source of hope for those who struggle with this skill. In psychotherapy, treatment for impulse-control issues often involves teaching individuals to realize the downsides of acting on immediate urges and in turn to practice delaying gratification. In anxiety disorders, this process occurs through exposure to a feared situation – which is very uncomfortable at first, but eventually becomes tolerable and even trains a person's mind and body that these situations are less threatening than originally feared. Exposure therapy is only effective if an individual can delay gratification and resist the urge to escape the situation early on. To shed insight on the tradeoff between short- and <b>long-term</b> gains, therapists might also help individuals construct a pro-con list of a certain behavior, with sections for short-term and <b>long-term</b> outcomes. For maladaptive coping behaviors such as self-injury, substance use or avoidance, there are generally no <b>long-term</b> pros. Meanwhile, abstinence from acting on a harmful urge (i.e., delayed gratification) generally results in <b>long-term</b> benefits. This realization can be a powerful impetus for change.|$|E

40|$|Crude {{oil prices}} have been {{fluctuating}} over time and by a large range. It is the disorganization of oil price series {{that makes it difficult}} to deduce the changing trends of oil prices in the middle- and <b>long-terms</b> and predict their price levels in the short-term. Following a price-state classification and state transition analysis of changing oil prices from January 2004 to April 2010, this paper first verifies that the observed crude oil price series during the soaring period follow a Markov Chain. Next, the paper deduces the changing trends of oil prices by the limit probability of a Markov Chain. We then undertake a probability distribution analysis and find that the oil price series have a log-normality distribution. On this basis, we integrate the two models to deduce the changing trends of oil prices from the short-term to the middle- and <b>long-terms,</b> thus making our deduction academically sound. Our results match the actual changing trends of oil prices, and show the possibility of re-emerging soaring oil prices.
