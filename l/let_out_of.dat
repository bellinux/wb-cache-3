Flo travels to England on an ocean liner, where he runs into Billings again who is {{laughing}} at a newspaper article denouncing him as a fraud.|$|E
5|$|Huseby's demands were {{to talk to}} Prime Minister Kåre Willoch and Minister of Justice Mona Røkke, {{both from}} the Conservative Party. He also wanted to hold a press conference at Fornebu. Huseby was {{unsatisfied}} with his treatment after he left prison. He demanded to receive guarantees for a better treatment and economic security from the authorities. Assisted by a psychologist, the police negotiated with Huseby. One hour after the plane landed, 70 passengers were <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the plane. The first group were those passengers who had or claimed they had transfers to other flights. In exchange, the aircraft was {{moved closer to the}} terminal building. The passengers were picked up by a bus and transported to the domestic terminal, where they were questioned by the police. The remaining passengers were let out thirty minutes later. Only the five crew members remained.|$|E

50|$|In 1996, Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) {{appointed}} receivers over 33 properties mortgaged by Silven Properties to it, {{and proceeded}} to sell them off. The receivers explored planning and <b>letting</b> <b>out</b> the properties, but decided to sell them straight away. Silven alleged that RBS's receivers were under a duty to maximise the value by getting planning permission for development and <b>letting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> vacant properties.|$|R

25|$|After {{the attempt}} to escape into a home of her own with Craig, Rachel Hudson lived in the family home in Overdale Road, Stockhill as a virtual prisoner. She wasn't allowed {{to speak to her}} parents or even her husband. She was only <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the house with 'a minder'. The Hudsons feared she would take Craig away from them. After {{initially}} siding with his wife, Craig joined the other Hudsons in participating in the abuse.|$|E
25|$|Qutb was <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{prison at}} the end of 1964 {{at the behest of the}} Prime Minister of Iraq, Abdul Salam Arif, for only 8 months before being rearrested in August 1965. He was accused of {{plotting}} to overthrow the state and subjected to what some consider a show trial. Many of the charges placed against Qutb in court were taken directly from Ma'alim fi-l-Tariq and he adamantly supported his written statements. The trial culminated in a death sentence for Qutb and six other members of the Muslim Brotherhood. He was sentenced to death for his part in the conspiracy to assassinate the President and other Egyptian officials and personalities, though he was not the instigator or leader of the actual plot. On 29 August 1966, he was executed by hanging.|$|E
25|$|Just {{prior to}} the Ryder Cup in 2004, Mickelson was dropped from his long-standing {{contract}} with Titleist/Acushnet Golf, when he took heat for a voicemail message he left for a Callaway Golf executive. In it he praised their driver and golf ball, and thanked them for their help in getting some equipment for his brother. This memo was played to all of their salesmen, and eventually found its way back to Titleist. He was then <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his multi-year deal with Titleist 16 months early, and signed on with Callaway Golf, his current equipment sponsor. He endured {{a great deal of}} ridicule and scrutiny from the press and fellow Ryder Cup members for his equipment change so close to the Ryder Cup matches. He faltered at the 2004 Ryder Cup with a 1–3–0 record, but refused to blame the sudden change in equipment or his practice methods for his performance.|$|E

25|$|Burroughs {{finished}} high school at Taylor School in Clayton, Missouri, and in 1932, left home to pursue an arts degree at Harvard University, where he was affiliated with Adams House. During the summers, {{he worked as a}} cub reporter for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, covering the police docket. He disliked the work, and refused to cover some events, like the death of a drowned child. He lost his virginity in an East St. Louis, Illinois brothel that summer with a female prostitute whom he regularly patronized. While at Harvard, Burroughs made trips to New York City and was introduced to the gay subculture there. He visited lesbian dives, piano bars, and the Harlem and Greenwich Village homosexual underground with Richard Stern, a wealthy friend from Kansas City. They would drive from Boston to New York in a reckless fashion. Once, Stern scared Burroughs so badly that he asked to be <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the vehicle.|$|E
25|$|Popular fiction often confuses Bligh with Edward Edwards of , who {{was sent}} on the Royal Navy's {{expedition}} to the South Pacific to find the mutineers {{and bring them to}} trial. Edwards is often made out to be the cruel man that Hollywood has portrayed Bligh as being. The 14 men from Bounty who were captured by Edwards' men were confined in a cramped 18′ × 11′ × 5′8″ wooden cell on Pandoras quarterdeck. Yet, when Pandora ran aground on the Great Barrier Reef, three prisoners were immediately <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the prison cell to help at the pumps. And finally Captain Edwards did also give orders to release the other 11 prisoners, to which end Joseph Hodges the armourer's mate went into the cell to knock off the prisoners' irons. But before he could finish the job, the ship sank very quickly. Eventually four of the prisoners and 31 of the crew died during the wrecking. More prisoners would likely have perished, had not William Moulter, a bosun's mate, unlocked their cage before jumping off the sinking vessel.|$|E
25|$|Two plebeian tribunes, Favonius and Cato, led the {{opposition}} to the steps of the consuls. However, they did not get far, due to popular support for the measures. Favonius was given little time to speak before the plebeian council, and Cato applied obstructionist tactics that did not work. He was led away from the assembly, but he kept returning and he was eventually arrested. Gallus, a senator, slept in the senate house intending to join the proceedings in the morning. Trebonius locked the doors and kept him there for most of the day. The comitia (the meeting place of for the assembly) was blocked by a cordon of men. An attempt to pass through was repulsed violently and there were casualties. When people were leaving after the vote Gallus, who had been <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the senate house, was hit when he tried to pass through the cordon. He was presented covered with blood to the crowd. People were upset. The consuls stepped in with a large and intimidating bodyguard, called a meeting and put the measure in favour of Caesar to the vote. It was passed.|$|E

500|$|Dixon {{restructured}} {{portions of}} Hairsprays book to allow {{several of the}} songs to blend more naturally into the plot, in particular [...] "(You're) Timeless to Me" [...] and [...] "I Know Where I've Been". [...] "(You're) Timeless to Me" [...] becomes the anchor of a newly invented subplot involving Velma's attempt to break up Edna and Wilbur’s marriage and keep Tracy off The Corny Collins Show as a result. The song now serves as Wilbur's apology to Edna, {{in addition to its}} original purpose in the stage musical as a tongue-in-cheek declaration of Wilbur and Edna's love for each other. Meanwhile, [...] "I Know Where I've Been", instead of being sung by Maybelle to the kids after being <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> jail, now underscores Maybelle's march on WYZT (which takes place in the stage musical at the end of [...] "Big, Blonde, and Beautiful").|$|E
500|$|Pearl Jam toured relentlessly {{in support}} of Ten. Ament stated that [...] "essentially Ten was just an excuse to tour," [...] adding, [...] "We told the record company, 'We know we {{can be a great}} band, so let's just get the {{opportunity}} to get out and play.'" [...] The band's manager, Kelly Curtis, stated, [...] "Once people came and saw them live, this lightbulb would go on. Doing their first tour, you kind of knew it was happening and there was no stopping it." [...] Early on in Pearl Jam's career, the band became known for its intense live performances. Looking back at this time, Vedder said that [...] "playing music and then getting a shot at making a record and at having an audience and stuff, it's just like an untamed force...But it didn't come from jock mentality. It came from just being <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the gates." ...|$|E
500|$|In contrast, {{historian}} Toh Boon Kwan argues {{at length}} {{the cause of}} the Indonesians, asserting that their claim to victory is equally as valid, if not more than that of the British. He states that British policy makers, in their relief at being <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the spiral towards war, had forgotten that the Lombok Strait was militarily advantageous to Indonesia, as Indonesian warships could screen the task force easily from a nearby naval base. Symbolically, too, the forcing of ships of the vaunted Royal Navy to take the long way around their territory can be regarded as a major diplomatic success. Indonesian politicians gained strength from the Crisis, now believing that they could go toe-to-toe with 'Imperialists' and survive [...] "brushes with danger." [...] This, acknowledged Boon Kwan, oddly contrasts with the defeatist views of the army, who were irritated at how close they had come to war, and who in any case carried out the policies of the Confrontation with little relish. It was the army, he asserts, that sent the peace initiatives to the Tunku in September.|$|E

500|$|Yar's {{death in}} the episode was after Crosby had asked to be <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her contract, and rumors had {{circulated}} of her departure. She later described her time spent on Star Trek: The Next Generation as [...] "miserable", and it was well known {{at the time that}} she was unhappy with the way her role had been developed. She later said that if she'd had more scenes written for her similar to the one she shared with Worf {{at the start of the}} episode then she wouldn't have wanted to leave the show. Yar's memorial scene was filmed twice, the first was with Crosby reciting the lines while looking straight ahead, which was the director's preferred choice. However a version with her looking towards each of the other characters in turn was ultimately used. Scanlan later said [...] "Don't ask me how she knew where they'd be standing". Marina Sirtis's tears in the scene were real, as she was cued by Crosby standing off camera. [...] "Skin of Evil" [...] was not the last episode in the first season in which Denise Crosby appeared. [...] "" [...] was subsequently filmed after this episode, but was aired earlier in the run. In fact, toward the end of [...] "Symbiosis" [...] you can see Crosby waving goodbye to the fans (it is the scene where Picard and Crusher leave the cargo bay). Crosby would also later return to the Yar role in [...] "Yesterday's Enterprise", the two part series finale [...] "" [...] and as Yar's half-Romulan daughter Sela in several episodes. Guest stars in [...] "Skin of Evil" [...] included Walker Boone as Leland T. Lynch, Brad Zerbst as a nurse and Raymond Forchion as Ben Prieto. Even though this episode marked the death of Yar, Crosby would be credited for the remaining three first season episodes.|$|E

2500|$|In August 2005, 18-year-old Joseph Daniel Maldonado hanged {{himself at}} Chaderjian, {{sparking}} yet {{another round of}} outcries about conditions and calls for closure. In the eight weeks before he died, Maldonado had rarely been <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his cell and was denied family visits, mental health care, and educational services. [...] A report by California's Office of the Inspector General states [...] "the effects of this eight-week isolation and service deprivation {{may have contributed to}} the Ward’s suicide."

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s (1973, to be particular) when the {{military}} junta took over power in Uruguay, art suffered in Montevideo. The art studios went into protest mode, with Rimer Cardillo, one of the country's leading artists, making the National Institute of Fine Arts, Montevideo a [...] "hotbed of resistance". This resulted in the military junta coming down heavily on artists by closing the Fine Art Institute and carting away all the presses and other studio equipment. Consequently, the learning of fine arts was only in private studios run by {{people who had been}} <b>let</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> jail, in works of printing and on paper and also painting and sculpture.

50|$|As {{has been}} said earlier, the 1915 Act had disapplied the Act where board, attendance, or {{furniture}} was provided.
