Some members of parliament, such as Miroslav Antl, Chairman of the Senate Constitutional Committee, commented that the <b>licensing</b> <b>process</b> is thorough enough, and pointed out that he considers carrying of concealed firearm as a necessity due to variety of reasons, especially in recent time also due to the rising threat of Islamist terrorist attacks. Roman Váňa, Chairman of the Parliamentary Security Committee and member of Chovanec's own Social Democratic party, refused Chovanec's argument, while some other members of parliament went in the opposite direction, claiming {{that there are too}} few armed people among the Czech population, since a single armed civilian might have stopped Kovář's assault. The sentiment was shared also by, for example, Martin Koller, a former ambassador to Kuvait and Iraq, who said that an armed attacker may be stopped only by armed force, and who pointed out to a past well-known Czech case of a machete attack and to the Charlie Hebdo shooting, stating that both might have ended quite differently had the victims been armed.|$|E

In 1998, Navarro co-founded Centro Familia, a small local nonprofit organization that trained people so they can be licensed in child care. She volunteered for the organization at no pay until the organization received enough state and county grant money that it could pay her a salary and hire four instructors two years later.

25|$|The {{ease with}} which an {{individual}} can acquire an amateur radio license varies from country to country. In some countries, examinations may be offered {{only once or twice}} a year in the national capital and can be inordinately bureaucratic (for example in India) or challenging because some amateurs must undergo difficult security approval (as in Iran). Currently only Yemen and North Korea do not issue amateur radio licenses to their citizens, although in both cases a limited number of foreign visitors have been permitted to obtain amateur licenses in the past decade. Some developing countries, especially those in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, require the payment of annual license fees that can be prohibitively expensive for most of their citizens. A few small countries may not have a national <b>licensing</b> <b>process</b> and may instead require prospective amateur radio operators to take the licensing examinations of a foreign country. In countries with the largest numbers of amateur radio licensees, such as Japan, the United States, Thailand, Canada, and most of the countries in Europe, there are frequent license examinations opportunities in major cities.|$|E

[...] The second is a tax credit parity. [...] Hydropower currently receives half of the rate per kWh under the Production Tax Credit, and the NHA thinks {{that it should be}} increased such that it is equal with other renewable technologies. [...] The third priority calls for incentivizing renewable electricity production and manufacturing (manufacturing tax credits, Clean and Renewable Energy Bonds, Production and Investment Tax Credits should be extended). [...] They also want a federal clean and renewable energy standard which promotes development. [...] The last priority calls for continued investment in research and development for both conventional and non-conventional hydropower projects.|$|E
