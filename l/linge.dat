SS guards brought over {{additional}} cans of petrol to further burn the corpses. <b>Linge</b> later noted the fire did not completely destroy the remains, as the corpses were being burned in the open, where the distribution of heat varies. The corpses burned from 16:00 to 18:30. At approximately 18:30, Lindloff and Reisser covered up the remains in a shallow bomb crater.|$|E
5|$|After 1:00pm on 30 April 1945, Braun and Hitler {{said their}} farewells to staff {{and members of}} the inner circle. Later that afternoon, at {{approximately}} 3:30pm, several people reported hearing a loud gunshot. After waiting a few minutes, Hitler's valet, Heinz <b>Linge,</b> and Hitler's SS adjutant, Otto Günsche, entered the small study and found the lifeless bodies of Hitler and Braun on a small sofa. Braun had bitten into a cyanide capsule, and Hitler had shot himself in the right temple with his pistol. The corpses were carried up the stairs and through the bunker's emergency exit to the garden behind the Reich Chancellery, where they were burned. Braun was 33 years old when she died.|$|E
5|$|Gjems-Onstad {{joined the}} Norwegian {{resistance}} movement after Nazi Germany invaded Norway in 1940. He {{was arrested in}} Sweden for his involvement with Norwegian resistance activity {{in the country in}} 1941, and was sent to the United Kingdom where he joined the Norwegian Independent Company 1 (Kompani <b>Linge)</b> and received British military training. He was deployed to Norway in 1943 as part of Lark, assigned with establishing radio connection with London. He led Lark in Trøndelag between 1943 and 1945, which constituted the leadership of Milorg in the region. His other activities included to assist with weapons smuggling, prepare the sinking of the German battleship Tirpitz and plotting to assassinate Nazi collaborator Ivar Grande. He also founded the Durham organisation for conducting psychological warfare {{towards the end of the}} war, and he took part in blowing up railway tracks. Gjems-Onstad's efforts during the Second World War led him to become one of Norway's highest decorated war heroes.|$|E

50|$|Oslogjengen (lit. The Oslo Gang, {{also called}} Kompani <b>Linge's</b> Oslo Detachment) was a {{sabotage}} group operating in Oslo from May 1944 to May 1945, {{during the last}} year of the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany. The group had its basis in both the British Special Operations Executive and the Norwegian Milorg, was coordinated by Gunnar Sønsteby, and had around ten members. It was the dominant sabotage group in Oslo between May and September 1944, when they performed a series of successful sabotage operations.|$|R
50|$|Bernard {{worked in}} Paris from 1617 to 1621 and, when {{religious}} conflicts {{broke out in}} France, fled to London around 1621, where through connections in the Dutch expatriate community he immediately became employed in a glazier's studio. Abraham joined him around 1623. Abraham van <b>Linge's</b> work can be seen most prominently in the chapels of University College, Oxford and Lincoln College, Oxford, and at Christ Church, Oxford in England, where the lead lining is particularly noticeable. His work {{is supposed to be}} seen in the Duke Humfrey reading room of the Bodleian Library, also in Oxford, although it is not certain whether the painted glass frames are by him or simply done in his style.|$|R
5|$|After {{arriving}} in the UK, Gjems-Onstad joined the Norwegian Independent Company 1 (Kompani <b>Linge)</b> and took British military education. The British decided in 1943 to deploy him to Trøndelag in Norway together with Odd Sørli, Johnny Pevik and Nils Uhlin Hansen. The deployment was necessary as Evald Hansen and Herluf Nygaard had been captured and tortured in December 1942 (Nygaard later escaped, Hansen died at Falstad). Sørli and Gjems-Onstad were set to maintain Lark, establish radio connection with London and get intelligence about the German battleship Tirpitz, at the time located in the Trondheimsfjord. When he was training at Glen More Lodge near Aviemore, Gjems-Onstad was ordered to go to London, where he was supplied with a 20kg radio transmitter and other equipment. Together with Sørli he travelled to Inverness by train, and to Shetland by plane, under stormy weather conditions. They initially set out with the fishing boat Harald II from Scalloway in late February, but due to unusually stormy weather they were driven back to Shetland three times after three unsuccessful attempts to reach Ålesund; the last attempt destroyed their equipment as the boat was bursted open. They had their equipment replaced, and set out for Kristiansund in March instead on a bigger boat. With easier, yet still poor weather, the voyage took two days. When they reached land they noticed that they had reached Kya Lighthouse, much farther {{to the north of}} their original destination, but they decided to make landfall anyway. From there they travelled with fake identification via Namsos to Trondheim, where they reunited with fellow Lark members Johnny Pevik and Nils Uhlin Hansen, the other group sent from London. Gjems-Onstad thereafter assisted Pevik and Hansen with transporting five tons of weapons from an uninhabited island near Lyngvær to Trondheim.|$|E
5|$|When Winkelman {{took over}} command, he {{intensified}} the negotiations, proposing on 21 February that Belgium would man a connecting {{line with the}} Peel Raam Position along the Belgian part of the Zuid-Willemsvaart. The Belgians refused to do this unless the Dutch reinforced their presence in Limburg; the Dutch had no forces available with which to fulfill this request. Repeated Belgian requests to reconsider the Orange Position were refused by Winkelman. Therefore, the Belgians decided to withdraw, {{in the event of}} an invasion, all their troops to their main defence line, the Albert Canal. This created a dangerous gap forty kilometres wide. The French were invited to fill it. Now the French Commander in Chief General Maurice Gamelin was more than interested in including the Dutch in his continuous front as, like Major-General Bernard Montgomery four years later, he hoped to circle around the Westwall when the Entente launched its planned 1941 offensive. But he did not dare to stretch his supply lines that far unless the Belgians and Dutch would take the allied side before the German attack. When both nations refused, Gamelin made it clear that he would occupy a connecting position near Breda. The Dutch did not fortify this area. In secret, Winkelman decided on 30 March to abandon the Peel-Raam Position immediately at the onset of a German attack and withdraw his Third Army Corps to the <b>Linge</b> to cover the southern flank of the Grebbe Line, leaving only a covering force behind. This Waal-Linge Position was to be reinforced with pillboxes; the budget for such structures was increased with a hundred million guilders.|$|E

5000|$|The close {{relationship}} between Rommel and Hitler continued following the Western campaign; after Rommel sent to him a specially prepared diary on the 7th Division, he received a letter of thanks from the dictator (According to Speer, normally, he would send extremely unclear reports which annoyed Hitler greatly). According to Maurice Remy, the relationship, which Remy calls [...] "a dream marriage", only showed the first crack in 1942, and later gradually turned into, {{in the words of}} German writer Ernst Jünger who was in contact with Rommel in Normandy, [...] "liebehass" [...] (a love-hate relationship). Ruge's diary and Rommel's letter to his wife showed his mood to fluctuate wildly regarding Hitler: while he showed disgust towards the atrocities and disappointment towards the situation, he was overjoyed to welcome a visit from Hitler, only to return to depression the next day when faced with reality. Hitler displayed the same emotions. Amid growing doubts and differences, he would remain eager to hear from Rommel's calls (they had almost daily, hour-long, highly animated conversations, with the preferred topic being technical innovations), once almost grabbed the telephone out of <b>Linge's</b> hand. Hitler tried to fix the dysfunctional relationship many times without results, with Rommel calling his attempts [...] "Sunlamp Treatment", although later he said that [...] "Once I have loved the Führer, and I still do." [...] Remy and Der Spiegel remark that the statement was very much genuine, while Watson notes that he believed he deserved to die for his treasonable plan.|$|R
25|$|Herrmann had a {{remarkable}} Mille Miglia race in 1954, when {{the gates of}} a railroad crossing were lowered in the last moment before the fast train to Rome passed. Driving a very low Porsche 550 Spyder, Herrmann decided {{it was too late}} for a brake attempt anyway, knocked on the back of the helmet of his navigator Herbert <b>Linge</b> to make him duck, and they barely passed below the gates and before the train, to the surprise of the spectators.|$|E
25|$|After the war Ulstein {{participated in}} the Independent Norwegian Brigade Group in Germany. When {{returning}} to Norway he was editor-in-chief of the newspaper Fjordabladet from 1948 to 1949. He was an active writer. He co-edited the official two-volume work on the NOR.I.C.1 company, Kompani <b>Linge,</b> issued in 1948, together with Erling Jensen and Per Ratvik. The books had introductions by both King Haakon and Milorg leader Jens Christian Hauge. Ulstein worked as an editor for Filmavisen, and from 1954 as a journalist for various newspapers, including Bergens Tidende and Sunnmørsposten.|$|E

In order to ensure that the First Foundation would be created, Seldon and the Psychohistorians of Trantor placed the Commissioner <b>Linge</b> Chen (then actual if not crowned Emperor) under intense scrutiny, as well as Mentalic influence in order to achieve their aims. This was a clear but vital breach in the limits of psychohistorical theory, as psychostatistics is meaningful only with planetary numbers, and not with individuals.|$|E

The mound is 19 m in diameter and 3.5 m in height. At the top its diameter is 12 m and seen by satellite imagery it is clearly too small to have been a motte, however it may originally have only been an observation post. It is locally known as 'Pinkie Hill' or the 'Jerry's helmet'.|$|E
25|$|As soon as {{the bridge}} was usable, Bülow sent Oppen with three cavalry regiments and a horse {{artillery}} battery after the French. Amey's retreating soldiers met Bigarré's 1st Brigade at Elst where Oppen's troopers found French infantry in position behind the <b>Linge</b> River and the pursuit ended. MacDonald fell back and redeployed his troops {{to hold the line}} of the Waal. Bülow moved west to Utrecht which he occupied on 2 December and paused to consider his next move. Two days later an 8,000-strong British expedition under Thomas Graham, 1st Baron Lynedoch landed in the Netherlands. To his annoyance, Bülow found the newly liberated Dutch people unwilling to volunteer for military service. A cache of 25,000 British muskets intended to arm the Dutch were used to equip the Westphalian Landwehr instead.|$|E
25|$|From there Kayser {{travelled}} to Bergen, {{where he}} involved {{himself in the}} illegal press. After some time {{he decided to take}} part in secret military and sabotage operations. He escaped to England in September 1941, and enrolled in the Norwegian Independent Company 1 led by Martin <b>Linge.</b> Kayser was recruited from the regular training to the so-called Finishing School, where the emphasis was on secret agent skills. His first mission was the Operation Anklet in December 1941. In 1942 he planned Operation Woodcock together with Kasper Idland and Kjell Endresen, two other Norwegian Independent Company 1 soldiers. They were to parachute onto the Nevlandsheia plateau in Gjesdal and from there carry out a sabotage operation against the strategically important Sola Air Station in Western Norway. The team's first attempt to carry out the operation failed due to fog obscuring the drop zone. Further attempts were called off after a French sabotage team was intercepted by the Germans and explosives designed for the operation fell into German hands.|$|E
25|$|After the German {{invasion}} of Norway in 1940 during World War II the mines at Løkken {{became an important}} resource for the Germans. To avoid having to bomb the entire Thamshavn and Løkken areas, the Norwegian government-in-exile chose instead to sabotage key areas instead of large areas, of consideration the civilian population. While the mining company chose {{to cooperate with the}} Germans, but secretly not performed planned production increases, Company <b>Linge</b> performed a total of four sabotage actions against the Thamshavn Line, led by Peter Deinboll. The first targeted the transformer station that was successfully blown up on 4 May 1942. But it was quickly rebuilt by the Germans and a new sabotage was necessary. In the fall of 1943 the idea was to blow up the lift in the mine, but instead the group decided to blow up the locomotives on the railway. On 31 October, four locomotives and one rail car was blown up. This was not enough for the Deinboll, and an attempt to hijack a train at Klingliene and blow up part of the rail at the same stop failed, killing the saboteur Odd Nilsen.|$|E
500|$|Günsche {{left the}} study and {{announced}} that the Führer was dead. The two bodies were carried {{up the stairs to}} ground level and through the bunker's emergency exit to the garden behind the Reich Chancellery, where they were doused with petrol. Eyewitness Rochus Misch reported someone shouting, [...] "Hurry upstairs, they're burning the boss!" [...] After the first attempts to ignite the petrol did not work, <b>Linge</b> went back inside the bunker and returned with a thick roll of papers. Bormann lit the papers and threw the torch onto the bodies. As the two corpses caught fire, a small group, including Bormann, Günsche, <b>Linge,</b> Goebbels, Erich Kempka, Peter Högl, Ewald Lindloff, and Hans Reisser, raised their arms in salute as they stood just inside the bunker doorway.|$|E

500|$|Several {{witnesses}} later {{reported that}} they heard a loud gunshot at approximately 15:30. After waiting a few minutes, Hitler's valet, Heinz <b>Linge,</b> opened the study door with Bormann at his side. <b>Linge</b> later stated that he immediately noted a scent of burnt almonds, which is a common observation {{in the presence of}} prussic acid (the aqueous form of hydrogen cyanide). Hitler's adjutant, SS-Sturmbannführer Otto Günsche, entered the study and found the two lifeless bodies on the sofa. Eva, with her legs drawn up, was to Hitler's left and slumped away from him. Günsche stated that Hitler [...] "... sat... sunken over, with blood dripping out of his right temple. He had shot himself with his own pistol, a Walther PPK 7.65". The gun lay at his feet and according to SS-Oberscharführer Rochus Misch, Hitler's head was lying {{on the table in front}} of him. Blood dripping from Hitler's right temple and chin had made a large stain on the right arm of the sofa and was pooling on the carpet. According to <b>Linge,</b> Eva's body had no visible physical wounds, and her face showed how she had died—by cyanide poisoning. Günsche and SS-Brigadeführer Wilhelm Mohnke stated [...] "unequivocally" [...] that all outsiders and those performing duties and work in the bunker [...] "did not have any access" [...] to Hitler's private living quarters during the time of death (between 15:00 and 16:00).|$|E
500|$|At around 16:15, <b>Linge</b> ordered SS-Untersturmführer Heinz Krüger and SS-Oberscharführer Werner Schwiedel {{to roll up}} the rug in Hitler's {{study to}} burn it. Schwiedel later stated that upon {{entering}} the study, he saw {{a pool of blood}} the size of a [...] "large dinner plate" [...] by the arm-rest of the sofa. Noticing a spent cartridge case, he bent down and picked it up from where it lay on the rug about 1mm from a 7.65 pistol. The two men removed the blood-stained rug, carried it up the stairs and outside to the Chancellery garden. There the rug was placed on the ground and burned.|$|E
500|$|Hitler's valet, Heinz <b>Linge,</b> {{stated in}} his memoirs that Hitler and Braun had two {{bedrooms}} and two bathrooms with interconnecting doors at the Berghof, and Hitler would end most evenings alone with her in his study before they retired to bed.

Public displays of affection or physical contact were nonexistent, even in the enclosed world of the Berghof. Braun took the role of hostess amongst the regular visitors, though she {{was not involved in}} running the household. She regularly invited friends and family members to accompany her during her stays, the only guest to do so.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} {{depiction of}} the arms {{was thought to be}} about 1590, in a document held by the College of Arms, which refers to the stags appearing on a blue (in heraldic terms, azure) background but subsequent examination of this document by Peter Donoghue, Bluemantle Pursuivant shows that the arms were added c.1680 [...] The first known appearance of the arms is therefore on John Speed’s Map of Oxfordshire in 1605 with a blue field. The green field made its appearance by 1619 in an armorial quarry painted by one of the Van <b>Linge</b> brothers. The green background became generally (but not universally) used by the 1730s, still appearing as horizontal hatchings indicating azure were in use on bookplates for the college library as late as 1761.|$|E
500|$|His {{relationship}} with Braun, which lasted nearly 14 years, was {{hidden from the}} public and all but his inner circle. Within that circle (most of whom survived the war), he was open about Braun, and they lived together at Berchtesgaden as a couple. Hitler's valet, Heinz <b>Linge,</b> stated in his memoirs that Hitler and Braun had two bedrooms and two bathrooms with interconnecting doors at the Berghof, and Hitler would end most evenings alone with her in his study before they retired to bed. She would wear a [...] "dressing gown or house-coat" [...] and drink wine; Hitler would have tea. Braun biographer Heike Görtemaker notes that the couple enjoyed a normal sex life. Braun's friends and relatives described her giggling over a 1938 photograph of Neville Chamberlain sitting on a sofa in Hitler's Munich flat with the remark: [...] "If only he knew what goings-on that sofa has seen." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{alternative}} scenario of Fegelein's death {{is based on}} the 1948/49 Soviet NKVD dossier of Hitler written for Joseph Stalin. The dossier {{is based on the}} interrogation reports of Günsche and Heinz <b>Linge</b> (Hitler's valet). This dossier differs in part from the accounts given by Mohnke and Rattenhuber. After the intoxicated Fegelein was arrested and brought back to the Führerbunker, Hitler at first ordered Fegelein to be transferred to Kampfgruppe [...] "Mohnke" [...] to prove his loyalty in combat. Günsche and Bormann expressed their concern to Hitler that Fegelein would desert again. Hitler then ordered Fegelein to be demoted and court-martialed by a court led by Mohnke. At this point the accounts differ, as the NKVD dossier states that Fegelein was court-martialed on the evening of 28 April, by a court headed by Mohnke, SS-Obersturmbannführer Alfred Krause, and SS-Sturmbannführer Herbert Kaschula. Mohnke and his fellow officers sentenced Fegelein to death. That same evening, Fegelein was shot from behind {{by a member of the}} Sicherheitsdienst. Based on this stated chain of events, author Veit Scherzer concluded that Fegelein, according to German law, was deprived of all honours and honorary signs and must therefore be considered a de facto but not de jure recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross.|$|E
500|$|On 30 April, the Soviets {{were less}} than [...] from the bunker. That afternoon, Hitler and Eva Braun {{committed}} suicide fewer than 40 hours after they were married.

After the door was opened, Misch only took a quick [...] "glance". He saw Eva, with her legs drawn up, to Hitler's left on the sofa. Her eyes were open and she was dead. Hitler was also dead. He was either sitting on the sofa or in the armchair by it; his head [...] "had fallen forward slightly". Misch started to leave to report the events to Schädle, but then stopped and returned to the door of Hitler's study. By then Misch observed that Hitler's corpse had been removed from inside the study and wrapped in a blanket. Several men then picked it up and carried it past him. Misch left and reported the events to Schädle, who instructed him to return to his duty station. After returning to the telephone exchange, Misch later recalled Unterscharführer Retzbach proclaiming [...] "So they're burning the boss now!" [...] Retzbach asked Misch if he was going upstairs to watch the events, but Misch declined to go. Thereafter, Günsche came down and told Misch that the corpses of Hitler and Braun had been burned in the garden of the Reich Chancellery.|$|E

2500|$|As a {{reflection}} of his participation in disputes, Georgescu became notorious for his sarcastic puns and the monikers he assigned to his friends and enemies alike. According to Dimisianu: [...] "Granted, he was foul-mouthed, spiteful, always lashing out with his words, the creator of amusing nicknames that were quickly circulated in the literary milieus, and being that way also made him enemies, and even made some regard him as a malevolent, corrosive spirit. He was not." [...] He reportedly braved the authorities by branding the Ceauşescu regime {{a revival of the}} Iron Guard, and habitually referred to the PCR leader as Căpitanul ("The Captain", a title associated with the Iron Guard leader Corneliu Zelea Codreanu), while his moniker for Scînteia editor Nicolae Dragoş was Răcănel ("Tree Frog", but also [...] "Little Soldier"). He also casually referred to Alain Robbe-Grillet, the French Nouveau Roman author, as Rochie-Friptă ("Toasted Gown"), in turn a word-by-word translation of the humorous homonym robe grillé. Other nicknames were structured around obscenities, and included his reference to an unnamed colleague as <b>Linge</b> Cur ("Ass-licker"). He integrated such names in his regular speech, creating a secret system of references that his closest friends were required to learn.|$|E
2500|$|Ulstein {{was born}} in Ulstein, Sunnmøre, {{as the son of}} Johannes Olsson Ulstein (1879–1969) and Borghild Strand (1885–1964). He {{finished}} his secondary education at Volda in June 1940. Later that year he fled to the United Kingdom due to World War II and the German occupation of Norway. Here, Ulstein {{became a member of the}} Norwegian Independent Company 1 (NOR.I.C.1) (...) , led by Martin <b>Linge.</b> He participated in Operation Anklet, a raid at Reine in December 1941. After the raid he returned to the United Kingdom. In 1943 he was a part of the failed operation Vestige I, which involved placing limpet mines on ships in Svelgen harbor. The actual mine placing was performed by Harald Svindseth, but the explosives went off too early, and the ship was docked instead of sinking. Participants in Vestige I fled to England. In 1944 Ulstein was tasked with returning to work as an instructor for Milorg in Sogn og Fjordane. He came via Shetland and landed near Florø together with Harald Svindseth. Svindseth built up a Milorg subgroup near Svelgen with the codename Snowflake, whereas Ulstein led the group Siskin. Siskins basecamp was at Fosskamben in Sogndalsdalen. Important local contacts were Olav Rise in Leikanger as well as Nils Knagenhjelm and Hans H. H. Heiberg in Kaupanger. Norwegian Independent Company 1 men Nils Fjeld and Nils Thorsvik also participated, sharing the military command with Ulstein. Various incidents in February 1945 spelled the end of Siskin. Some, including Olav Rise, were arrested, whereas Ulstein managed to flee from Sogndalsdalen. German forces approached Fosskamben, but local residents secretly slowed down their travel, giving Siskin members time to hide a large weapons cache and to escape. Ulstein, Heiberg and Knagenhjelm met in Fjærland. A new base was started in Frønningen. At most, 480 people had some connection to it. It did not remain operative for long, as it was disbanded at the liberation of Norway on 8 May 1945. Then, Ulstein and 72 others travelled to Gaular to assist the dethroning of German forces. For his war contributions Ulstein was decorated with the St. Olav's Medal with two oak branches, the British Military Medal, the Defence Medal 1940 – 1945, and the Haakon VII 70th Anniversary Medal.|$|E
