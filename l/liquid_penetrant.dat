40|$|The paper {{treats the}} {{application}} of various non-destructive testing methods to preventive examinations of vital elements of thermo-energy systems operating at elevated temperatures and pressures. The elevated pressures and temperatures produce thermal stresses in the material of a device, i. e. a system, which may result in material creep. On the occasion of a preventive inspection of a steam line some critical flaws were detected. They could easily result in a failure of {{an element of the}} device if the system continued to operate. In a visual examination of the link pipeline between two stages of a steam reheater cracks were detected at the surface of the pipeline close to a drillhole for the tube attachment supplying cold water. The presence of such cracks at the steam reheater not being admissible, repair of the pipe was required. The location of the cracks detected had to be confirmed additionally by other methods so that the location and extent of damage and repair could be determined. Based on non-destructive testing performed it was decided to remove the tube attachment supplying cold water to the system.

The relationship between penetrant materials and crack definition capabilities, the optimum penetrant materials evaluation method, and the optimum measurement methods for crack dimensions were investigated. A unique method of precise developer thickness control was envolved, utilizing clear radiographic film and a densitometer. The method of evaluation included five aluminum alloy, 2219 -T 87, specimens that were heated and then quenched in cold water to produce cracks. The six penetrants were then applied, one at a time, and the crack indications were counted and recorded for each penetrant for comparison purposes. Measurements were made by determining the visual crack indications per linear inch and then sectioning the specimens for a metallographic count of the cracks present. This method provided a numerical approach for assigning {{a sensitivity}} index number to the penetrants.

40|$|AbstractSpent fuel {{reprocessing}} for Fast Breeder Reactor (FBR) requires a dissolver {{made of a}} material which is resistant to corrosion as the process involves nitric acid as the process medium. The focus was {{on the use of}} advanced materials with high performance in high concentrations (greater than 8 N) and high temperatures of nitric acid employed in the dissolver. The commercially available materials like SS 316 l, titanium, Ti – 5 % Ta, and Ti – 5 % Ta – 1. 8 % Nb were tried and the corrosion behavior of these materials was studied in detail. It was also decided to try out Zircaloy – 4 as the material of construction due to its excellent corrosion resistance in nitric acid environment. The specifications were stringent and the geometrical configurations of the assembly were very intricate. On accepting the challenge of fabricating the dissolver, NFC made different fixtures for electron beam (EB) welding and TIG welding. Trials were carried out for optimization of various operating parameter for EB welding & TIG welding process es, which were qualified by radiography, <b>liquid</b> dye <b>penetrant</b> testing, and metallographic, mechanical and chemical analys es. Finally the dissolver was subjected to helium leak test. The tests conducted at IGCAR with Zircaloy dissolver assembly revealed that Zircaloy- 4 exhibited the superior corrosion resistance over all other materials tried out so far for this purpose. The results clearly indicates that Zircaloy – 4 is a near-zero corrosion material in comparison to the other materials.

40|$|There is a {{big number}} of church bells from 16 th to 19 th centuries in the {{highlands}} of Northern Chile, which are damaged by use during centuries and by falls due to earthquakes that affect the region. Some of them are cracked or have lost some of their parts. The aim of this work was to use an efficient welding method to repair the pieces lacking some of their parts, leaving a minimum trace of repair and extending their useful life. Restoration of a bell with smelting defects, lacking some parts, is described. The first method employed was an alloy {{similar to that of}} the piece under study, which eliminated the issue of material incompatibility between the filler and the bell. In order to do this, X-ray fluorescence was used to analyze a part of the repair zone. With data obtained from analysis, smelted bars were used for welding and plates of equivalent geometry were used to replace the missing parts. The second method used was commercial silver-tin alloy welding with flux coating. In both cases, results indicated a good joint, however, in the second case cost is higher and the color results make restoration evident. Both of the alloy restorations remained in a phase, which is ductile and has no aging problems. Ultrasonography and <b>penetrant</b> <b>liquids</b> detected no cracks.

50|$|Nondestructive testing or {{non-destructive}} testing (NDT) {{is a wide}} group of analysis techniques used {{in science and technology}} industry to evaluate the properties of a material, component or system without causing damage.The terms nondestructive examination (NDE), nondestructive inspection (NDI), and nondestructive evaluation (NDE) are also commonly used to describe this technology.Because NDT does not permanently alter the article being inspected, it is a highly valuable technique that can save both money and time in product evaluation, troubleshooting, and research. The six most frequently used NDT methods are eddy-current, magnetic-particle, <b>liquid</b> <b>penetrant,</b> radiographic, ultrasonic, and visual testing. NDT is commonly used in forensic engineering, mechanical engineering, petroleum engineering, electrical engineering, civil engineering, systems engineering, aeronautical engineering, medicine, and art. Innovations in the field of nondestructive testing have {{had a profound impact on}} medical imaging, including on echocardiography, medical ultrasonography, and digital radiography.|$|E
50|$|Lack of fusion is {{the poor}} {{adhesion}} of the weld bead {{to the base}} metal; incomplete penetration is a weld bead that does not start {{at the root of}} the weld groove. Incomplete penetration forms channels and crevices in the root of the weld which can cause serious issues in pipes because corrosive substances can settle in these areas. These types of defects occur when the welding procedures are not adhered to; possible causes include the current setting, arc length, electrode angle, and electrode manipulation. Defects can be varied and classified as critical or non critical. Porosity (bubbles) in the weld are usually acceptable to a certain degree. Slag inclusions, undercut, and cracks are usually unacceptable. Some porosity, cracks, and slag inclusions are visible and may not need further inspection to require their removal. Small defects such as these can be verified by <b>Liquid</b> <b>Penetrant</b> Testing (Dye check). Slag inclusions and cracks just below the surface can be discovered by Magnetic Particle Inspection. Deeper defects can be detected using the Radiographic (X-rays) and/or Ultrasound (sound waves) testing techniques.|$|E
50|$|NDT methods may {{rely upon}} use of {{electromagnetic}} radiation, sound, and inherent {{properties of materials}} to examine samples. This includes some kinds of microscopy to examine external surfaces in detail, although sample preparation techniques for metallography, optical microscopy and electron microscopy are generally destructive as the surfaces must be made smooth through polishing or the sample must be electron transparent in thickness. The inside of a sample can be examined with penetrating radiation, such as X-rays, neutrons or terahertz radiation. Sound waves are utilized {{in the case of}} ultrasonic testing. Contrast between a defect and the bulk of the sample may be enhanced for visual examination by the unaided eye by using liquids to penetrate fatigue cracks. One method (<b>liquid</b> <b>penetrant</b> testing) involves using dyes, fluorescent or non-fluorescent, in fluids for non-magnetic materials, usually metals. Another commonly used NDT method used on ferrous materials involves the application of fine iron particles (either liquid or dry dust) that are applied to a part while it is in an externally magnetized state (magnetic-particle testing). The particles will be attracted to leakage fields within the test object, and form on the objects surface. Magnetic particle testing can reveal surface & some sub-surface defects within the part.Thermoelectric effect (or use of the Seebeck effect) uses thermal properties of an alloy to quickly and easily characterize many alloys. The chemical test, or chemical spot test method, utilizes application of sensitive chemicals that can indicate the presence of individual alloying elements. Electrochemical methods, such as electrochemical fatigue crack sensors, utilize the tendency of metal structural material to oxidize readily in order to detect progressive damage.|$|E
