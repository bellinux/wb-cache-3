25|$|The fact of {{the matter}} is that we’re in our thirties now and that breakup {{happened}} ten years ago. As a human being you just don't want that kind of karma. We did a lot of shit talking, and they did a lot of shit talking, so I just called everybody up and invited them to my house and said ‘hey, listen, we’re in our thirties now, I’m sorry for whatever I said, I'm sure you guys didn’t mean what you said–you guys were upset because I split up the band and we were upset because of whatever. Let’s be friends again. But do I want to reunite and play fucking 15-year old songs? Well, it would be like asking you, ‘do you want to get back together with your first girlfriend?’ You learn some amazing things together, but I just shudder at the thought. We were a band that went out on top, which is good, but it’s just a coincidence. We were also a band that had been together for seven years, and for six of those years played to nobody and had a great time but were also on the verge of splitting up many times before that. It’s an old relationship. People would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it as unfinished business because to them we went out when we were most popular, but that has nothing to do with the creative element. As far as the creative element went, it very much was finished business. That’s why I ended the band! Now, thank god, fucking ten years later, we're not holding a grudge and we’re all cool with it. People pick up on the difference of attitude and think 'oh, this could mean a possible reunion', but that’s just them projecting their own desires upon us.|$|E

Spielberg said, [...] "I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it as digital makeup, not augmented animation... Motion capture brings the director back {{to a kind of}} intimacy that actors and directors only know when they're working in live theater." [...] Spielberg and George Lucas were also able to visit the set to watch Cameron direct with the equipment.|$|E

I have traced the {{family history of}} the man who calls himself Freddy Mike, and I find beyond question, and I may say even on his own admission, {{that there is not a}} shred or shadow of foundation for his story from beginning to end. He said that he had a twin brother. He had no twin brother. He said that the twin brother or a friend of the twin brother was in Eastbourne that night. There were no such people, and the whole story is an invention because, having known John Williams in the past, he did not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> his being hanged." ...|$|E

500|$|On his {{retirement}} Lang {{was raised to}} the peerage as Baron Lang, of Lambeth in the County of Surrey. He thus remained in the House of Lords, where he attended regularly and contributed to debates. [...] He worried about money, despite a pension, a large grace and favour house at Kew, and some generous cash gifts from well-wishers. [...] In 1943 he spoke in the House of Lords {{in support of the}} Beveridge Report on social insurance, and on 9 February 1944 he reiterated his earlier opposition to obliteration bombing. In October 1944 Lang was greatly distressed by the sudden death of William Temple, his successor at Canterbury, writing: [...] "I don't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the loss to the Church and Nation... But 'God knows and God reigns'." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{speaking}} with her friend, Swift became deeply fixated {{on the idea}} of how tragic it would be for the person one loved to wed someone else. That night, Swift experienced a dream where one of her own ex-boyfriends married another girl. To her, this signaled that she had to compose a song about interrupting a wedding. In retrospect, she concluded, [...] "For me, I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it as good versus evil. And this girl is just completely – just the evil one." [...] Swift entitled the album after [...] "Speak Now" [...] because it fit the album's concept, with each song being a different confession to a person. [...] "It's called Speak Now, and that pertains to the album as a concept and as an entire theme of the record more than I can even tell you," [...] she said. The song was released as a promotional single on October 5, 2010, as part of Countdown to Speak Now, an exclusive campaign launched by the iTunes Store. During the opening week of Speak Now, Swift performed [...] "Speak Now" [...] on the Late Show with David Letterman.|$|E
500|$|The {{extent to}} which Falstaff is a [...] "Shakespearian" [...] opera has often been debated by critics. Although the action is taken from The Merry Wives of Windsor, some {{commentators}} feel that Boito and Verdi have transmuted Shakespeare's play into a wholly Italian work. The soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf believed there was nothing English or Shakespearian about the comedy: [...] "it was all done through the music". In 1961 Peter Heyworth wrote in The Observer, [...] "Because of Shakespeare we <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Falstaff as a work that has a certain Englishness. In fact the opera is no more English than Aida is Egyptian. Boito and Verdi between them transformed the fat knight {{into one of the}} archetypes of opera buffa." [...] Verdi himself, however, felt that the Falstaff of the opera is not a conventional Italian buffo character, but portrays Shakespeare's fuller, more ambiguous Falstaff of the Henry IV plays: [...] "My Falstaff is not merely the hero of The Merry Wives of Windsor, who is simply a buffoon, and allows himself to be tricked by the women, but also the Falstaff of the two parts of Henry IV. Boito has written the libretto in accordance." [...] A contemporary critic argued that the text [...] "imitated with marvellous accuracy the metre and rhythm of Shakespeare's verse", but Hepokoski notes Boito's use of traditional Italian metric conventions.|$|E

500|$|Salvatore created Drizzt on {{the spur}} of the moment. He was under {{pressure}} to create a sidekick for Wulfgar in the Icewind Dale series. Salvatore had sent an early version of The Crystal Shard (what would become his first published novel) to TSR, and one day Kirchoff called him. She was on her way to a marketing meeting concerning the book, and informed him that they could not use one of the characters. He asked for time to think, but she was already late for the meeting. Off the top of his head, Salvatore said he had a Dark Elf. Kirchoff was skeptical, but Salvatore convinced her it would be fine because he was just a sidekick. She asked his name, and he replied Drizzt Do'Urden. She asked if he could spell it, and he said [...] "not a chance". Recalling Drizzt's creation in an interview, Salvatore said, [...] "I don't know where it came from. I guess that Gary Gygax just did such an amazing job in creating the drow elves that something about them got stuck in the back of my head. Thank God!" [...] Although many readers have assumed that Drizzt is based on one of the many Dungeons & Dragons role-playing campaigns that the author has played, this is not the case. Salvatore's main influences were classical literature and works of J. R. R. Tolkien. [...] "I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Drizzt as a cross between Daryth from Darkwalker on Moonshae and Aragorn from The Lord of the Rings." [...] Salvatore calls Drizzt [...] "the classic romantic hero—misunderstood, holding to a code of ideals even when the going gets tough, and getting no appreciation for it most of the time." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike Angie, Den's first wife, Chrissie [...] "has {{a strong}} will and fights {{for what she}} wants". However, as Oberman noted, [...] "there is enough of Angie in Chrissie to see that Den likes {{a certain type of}} strong woman. Chrissie is Angie with 15 years of {{feminism}} behind her", explaining in an interview with Radio 4: [...] "I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Chrissie as Angie with benefits... She's his [...] equal a bit more than Angie was." [...] Oberman later expanded: [...] "Chrissie, unlike Angie, won't hit the bottle as soon as Den starts playing away. She's proved she's ready to sit and wait for her revenge. She's a great, strong character". Talking to the Daily Mirror shortly after appearing on-screen {{for the first time in}} April, Oberman declared, [...] "Chrissie is the sort of woman I'd really like to be friends with... She's an Essex girl who was brought up in a family of brothers, so she knows how to work men. She understands that what they say is not always what they mean." [...] In her official character profile, Chrissie is portrayed as someone [...] "happy to play mind games" [...] and [...] "often two steps ahead of her husband", being described as [...] "the type of person to be your best friend. But if you cross her, she'll get her own back in the end." [...] Her strong-willed persona has led reviewers to label the character as [...] "venomous", [...] "sinister" [...] "devious", and [...] "hard as nails" [...] in [...] "the grand tradition of landladies of the Queen Vic", manipulating others to ensure matters go her way. As the [...] "scheming" [...] figure of the show, she was described as a [...] "witch" [...] and [...] "super-bitch", but was also represented as [...] "strong" [...] and [...] "clever" [...] woman. Executive producer Kate Harwood characterised Chrissie as a survivor, someone who [...] "thinks on her feet" [...] whatever the situation. Oberman has stated that she was thrilled to be [...] "playing such a strong female character", whom she described as not a bad person at heart but one willing to stand and [...] "fight in her corner".|$|E

2500|$|On {{his return}} to Lancashire from Leicestershire, manager Mike Watkinson was {{impressed}} by Smith's performances with the bat and ball. Smith's contract with the club was renewed, along with nine other young players who were expected to {{form the basis of}} Lancashire's squad in the future. Smith stated his intent to cement his place in the Lancashire side as an all-rounder, saying that [...] "My batting has come on in leaps and I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> myself as more of an allrounder. I batted in the top six at Leicestershire in the limited-over games and at seven in the four-dayers, and I got 50-plus {{a couple of times and}} had a run average of about 40. After the responsibility there I know I can do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{one thing}} these two {{different}} women share is their name: Holly Solomon. Solomon the art dealer {{was one of}} Nelson’s major influences, helping him find his style, which often features shapes, patterns, and words. His 2013 exhibition title “Polka Dots for Holly Solomon," [...] is fitting. Based heavily on pattern and decoration, Nelson uses the polka dot as both object and non-object, while incorporating “affirmations” as text jargon and a nod to society’s obsession with the pursuit of happiness. Taking its cue from its name, Polka Dots For Holly Solomon is a large-scale installation of polka dot patterns and subliminal messages presented across an array of two-dimensional and three-dimensional surfaces. Nelson says that the intention behind his new work is to “mean something and mean nothing at all. I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it as ‘non-conceptualism’.” ...|$|E

He was just, you know, it's, it's hard to describe, couldn't comprehend. I, I shot the boy, killed him and it's—I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it more or less as a mercy killing because somebody else would have killed him in the end, but it wasn't right."

2500|$|In 2002 Navetta and Lombardo joined Stevenson for {{a reunion}} {{performance}} by the Descendents' original power trio lineup at Stevenson's Stockage festival in Fort Collins, Colorado. According to Lombardo, they also recorded some songs for a potential future release: [...] "We recorded some of my songs in 2006 at The Blasting Room. In 2002 we recorded {{a whole bunch of}} songs, mostly Frank's songs. He was a great songwriter. He had such a unique EQ out of his amp. When we recorded later in 2008, we did some more of my songs, but Frank wasn't there for that. We tried to recreate that unique Frank sound. I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> these as songs that if the Descendents had stayed together, this is what we would have sounded like. Those are in Bill's hands. Milo has said from the get-go that he would record it, but he hasn't yet." ...|$|E
2500|$|Haldane (1957 [...] ) drew {{attention}} to the fact that in the process of the evolutionary substitution of one allele for another, at any intensity of selection and no matter how slight the importance of the locus, a substantial number of individuals would usually be lost because they did not already possess the new allele. Kimura (1960, 1961) has referred to this loss as the substitutional (or evolutional) load, but because it necessarily involves either a completely new mutation or (more usually) previous change in the environment or the genome, I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it as a dilemma for the population: for most organisms, rapid turnover in a few genes precludes rapid turnover in the others. A corollary of this is that, if an environmental change occurs that necessitates the rather rapid replacement of several genes if a population is to survive, the population becomes extinct.|$|E
2500|$|Shane Richie {{revealed}} that viewers dislike seeing Kat and Alfie happy. Speaking to Inside Soap Richie commented: [...] "People don't {{like it when}} Kat and Alfie are really happy.

The way that Jessie and I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it is that there's the curtain in the Queen Vic that separates the bar from their home – until you go behind it, you'd never have any idea there were problems. The bar is Kat and Alfie's public stage." [...] With the possibility that Alfie could be the father of Tommy, Richie added: [...] "As soon as I found out, I thought, 'If Alfie isn't infertile, then surely Tommy could be his son'. Jessie and I spoke about the dates of when Alfie was in prison, {{and when he saw}} Kat before she had the fling with Michael. The writers reckon they don't match up, but we think they do. Jessie is quite adamant about it!" ...|$|E
