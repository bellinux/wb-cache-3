25|$|Kurlantzick and Link {{noted that}} through {{cultivating}} {{economic growth and}} Chinese nationalism, the CCP has modernized authoritarianism to maintain their political control. They asserted that elite business <b>leaders,</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> benefited from China's economic growth, have accepted the CCP's authoritarian control as a result, largely preventing the new rich and emerging middle class from challenging their rule. Fenby argues that the latter, rather than accepting the system per se, have learnt {{to use it to}} their advantage. Kurlantzick and Link also noted that dissent still largely exists in the Chinese populace in regards to government policies on the economy, environment and society, particularly in rural areas, as they are becoming more aware of their constitutional rights. A recent poll in 2007 showed that 70% of Chinese consider the new rich to be corrupt and unworthy of respect.|$|E
25|$|Punishments for {{adultery}} {{vary from}} place to place. Where adultery is illegal, the punishment varies from fines (for example in the US state of Rhode Island) to caning in parts of Asia. There are fifteen countries in which stoning is authorized as lawful punishment, although in recent times it has been legally enforced only in Iran and Somalia. Most stoning cases {{are the result of}} mob violence, and while technically illegal, no action is usually taken against perpetrators. Sometimes such stonings are ordered by informal village <b>leaders</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> de facto power in the community. Adultery may have consequences under civil law even in countries where it is not outlawed by the criminal law. For instance it may constitute fault in countries where the divorce law is fault based or it may be a ground for tort.|$|E

Cohen wrote that Smith's thesis, {{that the world has}} entered a new era of conflict, is of [...] "central importance" [...] for the United States military, which Cohen believed would have to undergo significant adaptation if Smith was correct. Cohen criticised the book for its limited historical perspective, noting that conventional wars are still fought (for example the Kargil War in 1999) and that several confrontations in Asia threatened to spill over into conventional warfare. Nevertheless, Cohen concluded [...] "Smith has clearly written {{one of the most important}} books on modern warfare in the last decade. We would be better off if the United States had a few more generals like him".|$|E

The expansion of sustainable business opportunities can contribute to job creation through the introduction of green-collar workers. [...] Research focusing on progressive corporate <b>leaders</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> integrated sustainability into commercial strategy has yielded a leadership competency model for sustainability, and led to emergence of the concept of [...] "embedded sustainability"—defined by its authors Chris Laszlo and Nadya Zhexembayeva as [...] "incorporation of environmental, health, and social value into the core business with no trade-off in price or quality—in other words, with no social or green premium". Laszlo and Zhexembayeva's research showed that embedded sustainability offers at least seven distinct opportunities for business value creation: a) better risk-management, b) increased efficiency through reduced waste and resource use, c) better product differentiation, d) new market entrances, e) enhanced brand and reputation, f) greater opportunity to influence industry standards, and g) greater opportunity for radical innovation.

Large amounts of money are spent on programs designed to have positive personal and professional outcomes, but there is as yet little systematic empirical evidence to support its effects. The current study addresses this gap by exploring the effects of executive coaching on leaders ‟ psychological states and transformational leadership behavior. Participants were {{taking part in a}} year long leadership training program, of which executive coaching was one component. To delineate the effects of executive coaching from the other training interventions, participants were randomly assigned to training and control groups. Measures of self-efficacy, developmental support, positive affect, openness to new behaviors, developmental planning, and transformational leadership were collected after the training group completed executive coaching to enable us to compare the impact of executive coaching on these measures. The data supported our hypotheses- <b>leaders</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> completed executive coaching reported higher self-efficacy, developmental support, openness to new behaviors, and developmental planning than <b>leaders</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not completed coaching.
