25|$|One {{suggestion}} is that the unicorn {{is based on the}} extinct rhinocerus species Elasmotherium, a huge Eurasian mammal native to the steppes, south of the range of the woolly rhinoceros of Ice Age Europe. Elasmotherium looked <b>little</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> horse, but it had a large single horn in its forehead. It became extinct {{about the same time as}} the rest of the glacial age megafauna.|$|E

And he always knew that subconsciously the only person who'd {{be able to give}} him a second look is someone who's not willing to take the first look for granted." [...] On her side, Jorja Fox {{has said that}} [...] "The story of Sara and Grissom is a <b>little</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> fable. And most great fables don't really have 100 percent resolution." ...|$|E
500|$|Wheeler began {{studying}} for a Master of Arts degree in classical studies, which he attained in 1912. During this period, he also gained employment as the personal {{secretary of the}} UCL Provost Gregory Foster, although he later criticised Foster for transforming the university from [...] "a college in the truly academic sense [...] a hypertrophied monstrosity as <b>little</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> college as a plesiosaurus is like a man". It was also {{at this time of}} life that he met and began a relationship with Tessa Verney, a student then studying history at UCL, when they were both serving on the committee of the University College Literary Society.|$|E

500|$|The band {{spent the}} {{remainder}} {{of the year in the}} studio, recording what would become Seventh Star. Warner Bros. refused to release the album as a Tony Iommi solo release, instead insisting on using the name Black Sabbath. Pressured by the band's manager, Don Arden, the two compromised and released the album as [...] "Black Sabbath featuring Tony Iommi" [...] in January 1986. [...] "It opened up a whole can of worms really", Iommi explained, [...] "because I think if we could have done it as a solo album, it would have been accepted a lot more." [...] Seventh Star, which sounded <b>little</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Black Sabbath album, incorporated more hard rock elements popularised by the 1980s Sunset Strip hard rock scene, and was panned by the critics of the era, although later reviewers such as Allmusic gave the album favourable reviews, calling the album [...] "often misunderstood and underrated".|$|E
500|$|... "Spoken For", {{the title}} track, [...] "offers {{a look at}} Jesus {{recognizing}} His children at heaven’s gate" [...] and {{has been referred to}} as 'worshipful'. [...] Among the individual tracks on the album, [...] "The Change Inside of Me" [...] has been described as [...] "firmly on the pop side of adult contemporary music", as well as [...] "upbeat pop/rock". [...] "All The Above" [...] has also been described as 'pop'; lyrically, it describes [...] "the elation that rang through the heavens when we became children of God". [...] "Your Glory Goes On" [...] is also an upbeat pop/rock song. [...] "Crazy" [...] is described as a driving ballad [...] "which explores the merits of heaven over earth", with its opening bars sounding [...] "a <b>little</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> slower version of The Police's [...] "Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic". [...] "Come One, Come All" [...] sounds like a cross between the sounds of Sonicflood and John Mellencamp.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive reviews. Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a B, praising the cinematic {{quality of the}} first two segments while concluding that the third was the poorest. He was impressed by how the Kubrick references in the second segment used originality rather than being a [...] "perfunctory checklist", and how the director's [...] "ow" [...] at the end had [...] "comic aplomb". Writing for the New York Daily News, Don Kaplan gave the episode four stars out of five, singling the third segment out as the best, and deeming the Kubrick homage [...] "smart and silly". A more mixed review came from Alex Strachan on Postmedia News' Canada.com, who found the second segment to be the best and the other two to be average, although he admitted that the Kubrick references were [...] "occasionally a little too inside or self-indulgent for their own good". He concluded that [...] "there’s something in Treehouse of Horror XXV for everyone. A <b>little</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Halloween bag of candy".|$|E

500|$|Arnold {{wanted a}} theme song marrying the [...] "classic Bond sound" [...] with the electronica that would {{influence}} {{most of his}} score. An orchestra would be required as audiences expect traditional elements in a Bond film, and without them The World Is Not Enough {{would be seen as}} a generic action movie. Getting the balance right might be a [...] "poisoned chalice", since the results could sound too much or too <b>little</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Bond theme. Arnold collaborated with lyricist Don Black on the song. Black, with 30 years of experience writing Bond themes, wrote the lyrics to Tom Jones's [...] "Thunderball", Shirley Bassey's [...] "Diamonds Are Forever", Lulu's [...] "The Man with the Golden Gun" [...] and k.d. lang's closing credits theme, [...] "Surrender", from Tomorrow Never Dies. Arnold and Black met several times to discuss lyrics for [...] "The World Is Not Enough", also collaborating by phone, fax and email. According to Arnold, he [...] "strung some la-las together, {{and all of a sudden}} the [...] came to life". By the end of 1998 he and Black finished the music and lyrics, except for the bridge (a contrasting section of about eight bars).|$|E
2500|$|All pizmonim can be {{classified}} under different maqams (musical modes), {{of which there are}} about ten in common use. Maqam ajam, which sounds a <b>little</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Western major scale, is the thematic maqam that contains many holiday melodies. Maqam hijaz, which corresponds to the Phrygian dominant scale, is the thematic maqam that contains many sad melodies. [...] Maqam sikah (or sigah), containing many three-quarter-tone intervals, is used for the cantillation of the Torah. Maqam saba is the maqam used for circumcisions.|$|E
2500|$|The Pei {{solution}} was elegant on paper but, as we know, {{it did not}} work very well in practice. The plaza today is lusterless and very nearly lifeless, and the 10th Street connector, renamed the L'Enfant Promenade, seems just another pretentious, failed dream. ... Much of the fault clearly rests with the plan itself. Life is sucked out of the plaza by an extensive, wrongheaded underground retail mall. The wide, ceremonial roadway is simply too much for too <b>little,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> symphonic fanfare introducing a high school band recital. And there's little reward for taking the road—it leads only to a dreary auto turnaround overlooking the (equally dreary) redeveloped Southwest waterfront.|$|E
