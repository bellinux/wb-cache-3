50|$|Governments and {{regulatory}} authorities have legislated {{about a number}} of information design issues, such as the minimum size of type in financial small print, the labeling of ingredients in processed food, and the testing of medicine labeling. Examples of this are the Truth in Lending Act in the USA, which introduced the Schumer box (a concise summary of charges for people applying for a credit card), and the Guideline on the Readability of the <b>Labelling</b> <b>and</b> <b>Package</b> <b>Leaflet</b> of Medicinal Products for Human Use (European Commission, Revision 1, 12 January 2009).|$|E
40|$|Objective: Recommendations on {{readability}} {{testing of}} Patient Information Leaflets (PILs) {{are described in}} European Commission (EC) as well as national guidelines. However, these recommendations are not obligatory, thus leaving {{the door open for}} market authorization holders and service companies to experiment with different readability testing methods. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate to which extent readability testing companies comply with the EC (1) and UK (2) guidelines and with the Sless & Wiseman info design theory (3) on which the recommendations are built. Methods: A digital survey consisting of 77 items and investigating current practice in readability testing was presented to the representatives of 45 service companies all over Europe. The results were examined against the criteria as presented in the EC and UK guidelines and the Sless & Wiseman theory. Results: Results were obtained from 12 service companies. Generally, we found that all respondents mostly comply with legislative recommendations, as well as with the Sless & Wiseman principles. However, service companies seem to interpret guidelines in different ways with regard to the number and background of test persons and the number of test rounds. Furthermore, respondents formulated some critical remarks on the existing legislation. The survey also revealed that several service companies also use other testing methods than recommended, such as eye tracking, thinking aloud, focus groups and written surveys. Conclusion: The findings of this survey show that service companies are well on their way to meet the criteria of the EC and UK legislations regarding readability testing. It further shows that other testing methods than the face-to-face interview are in place and being used. More in-depth research should assess how these methods function in the field.

40|$|Patient-friendly {{medication}} information: package inserts {{as a case}} {{in point}} The European Union authorization of medicinal products, following the European Medicines Agency guidelines (2009), prescribes package inserts, which are intended to provide understandable and legible scientific information for patients on safe usage of medicines (Fuchs 2009). The informational content of these inserts is derived from the scientific description of a medicinal product’s properties and the conditions attached to its use called Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC). This is a highly specialized document, which is written by and for healthcare professionals. In this paper we aim to investigate how the specialized medical knowledge provided in SmPCs is summarized, re-organized and reformulated in package inserts in order to reach a wider non-specialized group of readers. The following issues will be considered: (1) What are the formal (cf. sentence / paragraph length), stylistic (voice) and linguistic features of SmPCs and package inserts? The latter includes syntactic and terminological questions (technical vs. lay terms, definitions, use of symbols etc.) (2) Which strategies are adopted in the process of rewriting the scientific contents and language of SmPCs into a patient-accessible format? (3) Which language- and culture-specific differences exist between English, French and German patient inserts concerning the transfer of scientific medical information to non-specialists: what kind of knowledge is presupposed vs. what kind of (additional) knowledge is realized linguistically and/or added? The investigation is conducted by means of a (partially contrastive) corpus analysis. The corpus is taken from the EMA (European Medicines Agency) database and consists of a set of SmPCs in the source language English and the package leaflets derived thereof in English, French and German. The study aims to chart the general and language-specific features of package inserts in order to gain better insight into {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the current strategies adopted in the popularized discourse of authorized medicines across Europe.

Discrete areas of concern were identified with <b>labelling</b> <b>and</b> <b>packaging</b> which affected both health professionals and patients and had the potential to result in incorrect administration of medicines thereby causing harm. The working group also considered reports of specific cases of incorrect drug administration. The working group discussed and made recommendations in respect of general <b>labelling</b> <b>and</b> <b>packaging</b> principles, which should apply, to all medicines. The group has also proposed specific labelling requirements for medicines that have previously been implicated in medication errors, some with fatal outcome. The working group acknowledged that <b>labelling</b> <b>and</b> <b>packaging</b> was only part of any overall system to avoid errors with medicines. They recognised that {{some of the issues that}} were discussed were also encompassed in the wider remit of other groups involved in the implementation of an Organisation With A Memory.

It is acknowledged that there are no changes that can eradicate all errors. It is anticipated that CSM may agree that implementation of the proposals put forward by the working group could make a significant contribution to reducing medication errors. wgplm report 8. do...|$|R
