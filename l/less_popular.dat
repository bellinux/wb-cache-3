5|$|Although {{antidepressants}} with anxiolytic properties {{have been}} introduced, {{and there is}} increasing awareness of the adverse effects of benzodiazepines, prescriptions for short-term anxiety relief have not significantly dropped. For treatment of insomnia, benzodiazepines are now <b>less</b> <b>popular</b> than nonbenzodiazepines, which include zolpidem, zaleplon and eszopiclone. Nonbenzodiazepines are molecularly distinct, but nonetheless, they work on the same benzodiazepine receptors and produce similar sedative effects.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{questions}} about his income, no scandal ever touched Sunday. He was sincerely devoted to his wife, who also managed his campaigns, but his three sons disappointed him. His audiences grew smaller during the 1920s as Sunday grew older, religious revivals became <b>less</b> <b>popular,</b> and alternative sources of entertainment appeared. Nevertheless, Sunday continued to preach and remained a stalwart defender of conservative Christianity until his death.|$|E

5|$|Cacti were {{cultivated}} as ornamental {{plants from}} the time they were first brought from the New World. By the early 1800s, enthusiasts in Europe had large collections (often including other succulents alongside cacti). Rare plants were sold for very high prices.

In the late 1800s, collectors turned to orchids, and cacti became <b>less</b> <b>popular,</b> although never disappearing from cultivation.|$|E

5|$|In a 1979 {{interview}} in The Videophile newsletter, Muntz revealed {{the biggest problem}} for the Stereo-Pak business was returned merchandise. He explained that when reproducing the work of major artists like The Beatles, the Stereo-Pak plant had to make {{hundreds of thousands of}} cartridges. But once a popular album became <b>less</b> <b>popular,</b> retailers would return the unsold cartridges, expecting credit towards new titles. Muntz was unprepared for the returns and said the huge cost of unsold merchandise eventually made his Stereo-Pak business unprofitable.|$|E

5|$|In the U.S., {{airports}} {{are required to}} obtain stormwater discharge permits and ensure that wastes from deicing operations are properly collected and treated. Large new airports {{may be required to}} collect 60 percent of aircraft deicing fluid after deicing. Airports that discharge the collected aircraft deicing fluid directly to waters of the U.S. must also meet numeric discharge requirements for chemical oxygen demand. A report in 2000 stated that ethylene glycol was becoming <b>less</b> <b>popular</b> for aircraft deicing in the U.S., due to its reporting requirements and adverse environmental impacts (p.213), and noted a shift to the use of propylene glycol (p.I-3).|$|E

Customers who would not, or could not afford to pay were dealt with severely by being beaten and then thrown out.|$|E
