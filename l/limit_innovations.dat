40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide {{insights}} into how the successors of family-owned manufacturing SMEs view and manage innovativeness. Research into company takeovers mainly focuses on large companies and little is known about innovativeness in research on family-owned businesses, often SMEs. This paper presents findings from ten company successions, five of which describe family successions and five external ones. The paper points to that there is little difference in how various types of successor view and manage innovativeness. A successor is chosen with care and this also influences the view and management of innovativeness; other criteria seem to apply in the succession and radical changes can only be introduced if a number of contextual factors are managed properly. The paper also indicates that while financial constraints may <b>limit</b> <b>innovations,</b> a strong financial situation is not an antecedent for innovativeness.

40|$|Ergonomics {{sometimes}} has {{a negative}} connotation, as it is seen {{to be connected to}} illness or guidelines that <b>limit</b> <b>innovations.</b> This paper is focused on the positive aspects of ergonomics in improvement of the working environment. It consists of a part that studies the literature on success factors in the process towards higher productivity and greater comfort, the formulation of a model and a hypothesis, which is illustrated by four cases. The model distinguishes the success factors in 'goal', 'involvement' and 'process'. Goals: evidence is found in the literature that a positive approach has benefits in terms of shareholder value and productivity, and for comfort. Involvement: the literature shows that participation of end-users and management contributes to success. Process: in the process it is essential to have a good inventory of the problems, a structured approach, a steering group responsible for the guidance, and end-users involvement in testing of ideas and prototypes. It is hypothesized that the chance of success increases by empowerment (making the end-user responsible for deciding on {{the next step in the}} process) and positive experiences of end-users with the potential improvement (end-users feel or see the benefits). The four cases illustrate that the hypothesis can be used in evaluating cases. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Privacy law today faces two interrelated problems. The {{first is}} an {{information}} control problem. Like {{so many other}} fields of modern cyberlaw—intellectual property, online safety, cybersecurity, etc. —privacy law is being challenged by intractable Information Age realties. Specifically, it is easier than ever before for information to circulate freely and harder than ever to bottle it up once it is released. This has not slowed efforts to fashion new rules aimed at bottling up those information flows. If anything, the pace of privacy-related regulatory proposals has been steadily increasing in recent years even as these information control challenges multiply. This has led to privacy law’s second major problem: the precautionary principle problem. The precautionary principle generally holds that new innovations should be curbed or even forbidden until they are proven safe. Fashioning privacy rules based on precautionary principle reasoning necessitates prophylactic regulation that makes new forms of digital innovations guilty until proven innocent. This puts privacy law {{on a collision course}} with the general freedom to innovate that has thus far powered the Internet revolution, and privacy law threatens to <b>limit</b> <b>innovations</b> consumers have come to expect or even raise prices for services consumers currently receive free of charge. As a result, even if new regulations are pursued or imposed, there will likely be formidable push-up not just from affected industries but also from their consumers. In light of both of these information control and precautionary principle problems, new approaches to privacy protection are necessary. We need to invert the process of how we go about protecting privacy by focusing more on practical “bottom-up” solution—education, empowerment, public and media pressure, social norms and etiquette, industry self-regulation and best practices, and an enhanced role for privacy professionals within organizations—instead of “top-down” legalistic solutions and regulatory techo-fixes. Resources expended on top-down regulatory pursuits should instead be put into bottom-up efforts to help citizens better prepare for an uncertain future. In this regard, policymakers can draw important lessons form the debate over how best to protect children from objectionable online content. In a sense, there is nothing new under the sun; the current debate over privacy protection has many parallels with earlier debates about how best to protect online child safety. Most notably, just as top-down regulatory constraints came to be viewed as even be workable in the long-run for protecting online child safety, the same will likely be true for most privacy related regulatory enactments. This article sketches out some general lessons from those online safety debates and discusses their implications for privacy policy going forward...|$|E

40|$|This paper aims to {{identify}} and analyze the main <b>limiting</b> factors of <b>innovation</b> performance in terms of product and process <b>innovation.</b> The <b>limiting</b> factors to <b>innovation</b> make the innovation process of a firm difficult, which influences its innovation performance. The goal of this essay {{is to develop a}} theoretical support based on current reference approaches, corroborated by empirical support, which allows for the identification and analysis of the factors that restrict innovation activity and innovation performance. The database is extracted from the Community Innovation Survey - CIS 2010, which was conducted under the responsibility of the Office of Planning, Strategy, Evaluation and International Relations/Ministry of Science, Technology and Higher Education (GPEARI/MCTES), in collaboration with the National Statistics Institute (INE), under the supervision of EUROSTAT. We have developed a logistic regression model that highlights the barriers to innovation and identifies the factors that <b>limit</b> <b>innovation</b> performance. The analysis suggests that several barriers to innovation influence the Innovative performance of Portuguese firms. These results may be attributed to the fact that perceived barriers stimulate the firm to overcome these difficulties, which promotes the internal propensity to innovate. The most significant barriers identified in the study are the following: high innovation costs and perceived uncertainties in both the demand and market for new goods and services. This study shows that firms that do not have either qualified personnel to carry out innovation activities or sufficient market information are less likely to innovate than firms that do not experience these difficulties...|$|R
