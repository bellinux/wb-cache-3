5|$|The breed {{is prone}} to skin disorders. About a quarter of Westies {{surveyed}} are affected by atopic dermatitis, a heritable chronic allergic skin condition. A higher proportion of males are affected compared to females. An uncommon but severe breed-specific skin condition, hyperplastic dermatosis, may affect West Highland White Terriers, both juveniles and adults dogs. Affected dogs can suffer from red hyperpigmentation, lichenification, and hair loss. In the initial stages, this condition can be misdiagnosed as allergies or <b>less</b> <b>serious</b> forms of dermatitis.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} mercury {{took some time}} – the latent period between {{ingestion}} and the first symptoms (typically paresthesia – numbness in the extremities) was between 16 and 38 days. Paresthesia was the predominant symptom in <b>less</b> <b>serious</b> cases. Worse cases included ataxia (typically loss of balance), blindness or reduced vision, and death resulting from central nervous system failure. Anywhere between 20 and 40mg of mercury has been suggested as sufficient for paresthesia (between 0.5 and 0.8mg/kg of body weight). On average, individuals affected consumed 20kg or so of bread; the 73,000 tonnes provided would have been sufficient for over 3 million cases.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{designed}} to be the most humorous of Torchwoods second series and incorporated elements of broad comedy and soap opera style storytelling to the monster of the week story. It was filmed largely on location in South Wales—prominent locations included the tourist attractions Margam Country Park and Dyffryn Gardens—and featured an ensemble of previously unseen Welsh characters. The episode was seen by an aggregated total of 4.76 million viewers across its three debut showings in the United Kingdom. Critical response was extremely mixed, with some reviewers praising the inclusion of a <b>less</b> <b>serious</b> episode and others expressing the view that the comedy was too overt.|$|E

50|$|This {{omission}} {{of the negative}} verb ei {{is considered one of}} the most recent changes in Finnish. Usually this construction indicates mistrust or frustration. (There is a <b>less</b> than <b>serious</b> text calling this aggressiivi.) However, it can be a neutral negative statement: Tästä artikkelista mitään opi (From this article, you don't learn anything).|$|R
2500|$|NRBQ {{frequently}} performed [...] "The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald" [...] live, {{though in}} a <b>less</b> than <b>serious</b> manner. Video shows vocalist Terry Adams, reading from a lyrics sheet, chuckling as his voice cracks, while audience members throw debris at the stage. They did this to mock the song, not as a serious cover version.|$|R
5|$|Utmost {{necessity}} may {{be invoked}} where an interest {{protected by the}} Criminal Code (such as right to property or right to life) is endangered. An example of necessity would be a defense against a raging dog (unless the dog was directly sent by the owner, which would be case of necessary defense). The necessity may be invoked only in case of imminent danger and only {{if there is no}} other way of avoiding it (subsidiarity), such as locking oneself behind a fence or calling the police. Also, the consequence of the necessity must be <b>less</b> <b>serious</b> than the consequence of the endangering act (proportionality).|$|E
5|$|While {{members of}} the Liliaceae s.s. {{have been used as}} food sources in humans, the bulbs of some species are {{poisonous}} to household pets (bulb toxicosis) if eaten and may cause serious complications, such as renal failure in cats from Lilies, particularly Lilium longiflorum (Easter Lily). Dogs may develop <b>less</b> <b>serious</b> effects such as gastrointestinal problems and central nervous system depression. Most Fritillaria (e.g. Fritillaria imperialis, Fritillaria meleagris) bulbs contain poisonous neurotoxic alkaloids such as imperialin (peiminine), which may be deadly if ingested in quantity, while other species such as Fritillaria camschatcensis and Fritillaria affinis are edible. Tulips can cause skin irritation due to the presence of tuliposides and tulipalins, which are also found in the flowers, leaves and stems of Fritillaria. These are also toxic to a variety of animals.|$|E
5|$|After the 15 September incident, Blackman {{continued}} with his tour of duty, leaving Helmand Province in late October 2011. On 13 October 2012, at {{the decision of}} the Service Prosecution Authority, Marines A–E were charged with the murder of the unnamed Afghan insurgent. The lead came after British civilian police discovered suspicious video footage on a serviceman's laptop. Marines D and E had charges against them dropped on 5 February 2013. Marines A, B and C first appeared in court in August 2013, where they entered a not-guilty plea. The military trial of Marines A, B and C, protected from view in court behind a screen because of an anonymity order, began on 23 October 2013 and lasted two weeks. Their court-martial board (equivalent to a jury in the civilian justice system) was seven members strong, instead of the five used for <b>less</b> <b>serious</b> cases.|$|E

5000|$|Shack's 1988 debut album, Zilch, was a {{commercial}} flop upon its release. Critical consensus was that Head's songwriting was promising {{but that the}} album's production was lacking. In 1990, frontman Mick Head told NME that Shack's second album would be <b>less</b> lyrically <b>serious</b> than Zilch and that the band's influences {{at the time were}} The Stone Roses, Flowered Up, and The Charlatans.

5|$|Dietrich {{was tried}} in the County Court of Victoria in 1988 for a {{trafficking}} offence under the Customs Act 1901 and certain <b>less</b> <b>serious</b> charges. During the lengthy trial the accused had no legal representation. Although he had applied to the Legal Aid Commission of Victoria for assistance, {{they said that they}} would only help him if he pleaded guilty, an option which Dietrich did not want to take. He applied to the Supreme Court of Victoria for legal assistance, but was again turned down. Although Dietrich was acquitted of the fourth charge—regarding the possession of a quantity of heroin separate to that which was involved in the first three charges—he was convicted of the principal charge in the County Court. Dietrich brought an appeal in the Supreme Court, but that court refused to hear his appeal. He then sought leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia.|$|E
5|$|It {{became known}} on 4 September 2015 that ISIL had {{destroyed}} {{three of the}} best preserved tower tombs including the Tower of Elahbel. On 5 October 2015, news media reported ISIL is destroying buildings with no religious meaning, including the Arch of Triumph. On 20 January 2017, news emerged that the militants destroyed the tetrapylon {{and part of the}} theater. Following the March 2017 capture of Palmyra by the Syrian Army, Maamoun Abdulkarim, director of antiquities and museums at the Syrian Ministry of Culture, stated that the damage to ancient monuments may be lesser than earlier believed and preliminary pictures showed almost no further damage than what was already known. Antiquities official Wael Hafyan stated that the Tetrapylon was badly damaged while the damage to the facade of the Roman theatre was <b>less</b> <b>serious</b> in relativity.|$|E
5|$|It is a crime, {{while in}} a {{security}} area, to consort with or {{to be found in}} the company of a person carrying or having possession of or having under his or her control a firearm, ammunition or explosive in contravention of the offence mentioned above, if the circumstances raise a reasonable presumption that the person consorting intends or is about to act or has recently acted with the person having the item in a manner prejudicial to public security or the maintenance of public order. The penalty is either death or life imprisonment. It is a slightly <b>less</b> <b>serious</b> offence to be in a security area and consort with or be in the company of another person if it is reasonable for the person consorting to know that the other person had one of the above items. The penalty for this offence is imprisonment not exceeding ten years. If a person is carrying or has in his or her possession or under his or her control a firearm, ammunition or explosive, there is a rebuttable presumption that the person was acting in contravention of the offence mentioned above.|$|E

30|$|In case {{of serious}} droughts, basis risk {{may be less}} of a problem since the whole region could be {{affected}} more or <b>less</b> uniformly (<b>serious</b> drought as covariate risk). However, the magnitude of the problem depends on how the index is structured (Barnett et al. 2008). Designing the contracts only for big shocks is another solution to reduce basis risk (Turvey 2008; Hazell and Hess 2010; OECD 2011). This allows smallholders to utilize their traditional risk management schemes for smaller and more frequent risks.|$|R
5|$|The {{ability to}} {{categorize}} {{a case of}} epilepsy into a specific syndrome occurs more often with children since the onset of seizures is commonly early. <b>Less</b> <b>serious</b> examples are benign rolandic epilepsy (2.8 per 100,000), childhood absence epilepsy (0.8 per 100,000) and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (0.7 per 100,000). Severe syndromes with diffuse brain dysfunction caused, at least partly, by some aspect of epilepsy, are {{also referred to as}} epileptic encephalopathies. These are associated with frequent seizures that are resistant to treatment and severe cognitive dysfunction, for instance Lennox–Gastaut syndrome and West syndrome. Genetics is believed {{to play an important role}} in epilepsies by a number of mechanisms. Simple and complex modes of inheritance have been identified for some of them. However, extensive screening have failed to identify many single gene variants of large effect. More recent exome and genome sequencing studies have begun to reveal a number of de novo gene mutations that are responsible for some epileptic encephalopathies, including CHD2 and SYNGAP1 and DNM1, GABBR2, FASN and RYR3.|$|E
5|$|The {{sycamore}} is {{susceptible to}} sooty bark disease, caused by the fungus Cryptostroma corticale. This causes wilting of the crown {{and the death of}} branches. Rectangular patches of bark become detached exposing thick layers of black fungal spores. The fungus may be present in the heartwood without symptoms for many years, working its way towards the bark following long, hot summers. The spores are hyper-allergenic and cause a condition called maple bark stripper’s disease, a hypersensitivity pneumonitis. <b>Less</b> <b>serious</b> is the fungus Rhytisma acerinum which often forms the disease known as tar spot, in which black spots with yellow margins form on the foliage. The leaves may fall prematurely but the vigour of the tree is little affected. Sycamore leaf spot, caused by the fungus Cristulariella depraedans, results in pale blotches on leaves which later dry up and fall. This disease can cause moderate leaf loss but trees are little affected in the long run.|$|E
5|$|One {{person was}} struck and injured by an uprooted tree at Atherton, which {{suffered}} {{the loss of}} one house. All residences in Cardwell endured some degree of damage, with six unroofed, and the town itself was without power. Roads in Charters Towers were obstructed, and minor damage was observed at Cowley Beach, Dunk Island, and East Russell. Nearly all buildings in El Arish were damaged, and at Gordonvale, flooding inflicted widespread crop damage and winds toppled trees and power lines. Flood waters cut off the town of Halifax and inundated local businesses. Although no structural damage was recorded in Herberton, the cyclone uprooted trees, crippled Archer Bridge above Kennedy Creek, and halted electrical and telephone service. Mena Creek was completely cut off, and at Malanda, 30homes experienced damage and 20farms were wrecked. At Millaa Millaa, the cyclone damaged 12dwellings, and hundreds of barns, also impeding access to power and water supplies. Meanwhile, at Miriwinni, winds damaged 50houses, toppled electrical wires, and strewed roads with debris. Despite the fact that flooding was <b>less</b> <b>serious</b> at Kurrimine Beach, the storm still damaged dozens of houses and toppled electrical poles, with the towns of Ravenshoe and Silkwood experiencing power outages following the disturbance's passage. Although only inconsequential residential damage occurred at Woopen Creek and Yungaburra, damage at Tully was more serious, with considerable flooding, destruction to six houses, damage to a police station, and a localized blackout.|$|E

50|$|Some {{teachers}} may criticize gamification {{for taking a}} <b>less</b> than <b>serious</b> approach to education. This may {{be a result of}} the historical distinction between work and play which perpetuates the notion that the classroom cannot be a place for games, or a place for fun. Game play has also suffered under misconceptions of being easy, irrelevant to learning, and applicable only to very young children. These negative impressions of play may translate into suspicions regarding the value of game elements which promote fun and a sense of playfulness within a learning context.|$|R

5000|$|Stories {{about the}} Arthurian court were popular in medieval England, and the worn {{condition}} {{of some of}} the manuscripts suggests that they were well read.

Thomas Garbaty sees the poem as a humorous parody of the Arthurian legend, where Arthur is cowed by both the challenging knight and Ragnelle, [...] "passing the buck" [...] to Gawain. The Wedding of Sir Gawain survives in a poorly copied 16th-century manuscript located in the Bodleian Library (Bodleian 11951, formerly Rawlinson C.86) though it was probably written in the 15th century.|$|R
