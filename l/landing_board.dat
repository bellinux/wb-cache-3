50|$|On December 16, 1994, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) penned {{a letter}} to the <b>Land</b> <b>Board</b> asserting the sale of the parcel of land was both unconstitutional and a {{violation}} of state law. The letter stated the <b>Land</b> <b>Board</b> had taken the liberty of refusing bids other than the Jaycee’s. It also accused the <b>Land</b> <b>Board</b> of restricting media coverage, which they claimed had left the general public in the dark. In March 1995 <b>Land</b> <b>Board</b> members voted and rejected the ACLU’s request to void the sale.|$|R
50|$|In {{reaching}} {{its decision to}} lease the Tracts, the <b>Land</b> <b>Board</b> was not required, under state statute, to consider any environmental impacts or consequences that would result from the proposed mine. After the <b>Land</b> <b>Board</b> approved the leases, Northern Plains Resource Council and other conservation groups filed suit in the Sixteenth Judicial District in Broadus, Montana. The groups argued in court documents that the <b>Land</b> <b>Board</b> did not consider the impacts on climate change that the new mine would have and that the <b>Land</b> <b>Board</b> did not consider a single alternative to the full development of the mine, {{as required by the}} Montana Environmental Policy Act. Montana moved the court to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing that lacked legal standing to challenge the <b>Land</b> <b>Board’s</b> decision, that the Montana Environmental Policy Act did not apply to decisions of the <b>Land</b> <b>Board,</b> and that the statute allowing the <b>Land</b> <b>Board</b> to not consider any environmental impacts was constitutional.After hearing argument on the issues, the court denied Montana’s dismissal of the suit and allowed the case to proceed on the merits. As of November 2011, the case is still being litigated in the Sixteenth Judicial District.|$|R

Some applicants {{have been waiting for}} land allocation for over 12 years. Other challenges faced by the <b>Land</b> <b>Board</b> include poor records management that has led to double allocation. After identification of these challenges faced by the <b>Land</b> <b>Board,</b> the researcher was convinced that the challenges faced by the <b>Land</b> <b>Board</b> could be addressed through performance management. The current study therefore focuses on leadership practices at the <b>Land</b> <b>Board</b> and how these impact on performance management. The study was narrowed to Kgatleng <b>Land</b> <b>Board.</b> The study sought to establish the level of understanding with regard to Performance Management System (PMS), roles allocation, explore the link between · leadership and performance management as well as identification of the appropriate leadership model that can enable the organisation to better manage performance. A questionnaire was designed and administered to the employees of Kgatleng <b>Land</b> <b>Board.</b> The findings from the study revealed that employees did not fully understand the PMS concept, that the PMS initiative did not have full top management support, leadership did not have full possession of the required qualities, attributes and characteristics to enable fully managed organisational performance, leadership style practiced by the leadership was undesirable, and the employees did not know how the PMS initiative functioned within the organisation. The findings led {{to the conclusion that the}} employees need to be educated about the importance and rationale of the PMS initiative and how it functions, that there is need for full management support with regard to the implementation of the PMS initiative, a conducive leadership approach should be adopted, and the organisation should ensure that those in leadership positions have the desirable leadership qualities, characteristics and attributes.

40|$|Customary land in Botswana is {{administered}} by <b>Land</b> <b>Boards</b> whose functions are stipulated in the Tribal Land Act of 1968. Tribal land in Botswana constitute {{seventy percent of the}} total land mass and therefore its management is crucial to the way Botswana develops. The tenure characteristics of tribal land together with the limited technical know-how in <b>Land</b> <b>Boards</b> have created unprecedented land problems. Urban villages are seeing a rapid sprawl with the demographic increases of between sixty and seventy percent in a ten year period. Such increase in population alone is a grim reminder to planners and administrators to ensure that land is prudently managed so that planning can be done effectively.
