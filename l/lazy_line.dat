25|$|The <b>Lazy</b> <b>Line</b> Painter Jane EP {{followed}} in July. The track {{was recorded in}} the church where Murdoch lived and features vocals from Monica Queen. The EP narrowly missed out on the UK top 40, peaking at No.41. The last of the 1997 EPs was October's 3.. 6.. 9 Seconds of Light. The EP was made Single of the Week in both the NME and Melody Maker and reached No.32 in the charts, thus becoming the band's first top 40 single.|$|E
50|$|Monica Queen is {{a singer}} from Glasgow, Scotland who has collaborated with Belle & Sebastian (e.g., on <b>Lazy</b> <b>Line</b> Painter Jane from the <b>Lazy</b> <b>Line</b> Painter Jane EP), Chris Coco, James Grant and Jim White, among others. She is {{listed on the}} Fire Records (UK) artists page as a {{contributing}} artist to their Chamber Music album, a 36-part tribute to James Joyce's Chamber Music.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Lazy</b> <b>Line</b> Painter Jane box set was a re-release of Belle & Sebastian's 1997 EPs Dog on Wheels, <b>Lazy</b> <b>Line</b> Painter Jane and 3.. 6.. 9 Seconds of Light. The release {{contained}} original pressings of the CD {{versions of}} the three EPs in a card slipcase with new artwork. The slipcase was also available to purchase via the band's record label, Jeepster, for anyone who already owned the releases.|$|E

5000|$|A [...] "lazy shot" [...] is a shot {{which is}} {{suspended}} above the bottom. It may be {{tethered to the}} main shot line at a convenient depth. It is used for decompression and frees the main shot line for other divers. The <b>lazy</b> shot's <b>line</b> {{does not need to}} be longer than the decompression depth and is often only deep enough for the longer stops. It only needs a weight heavy enough to provide diver buoyancy control and sufficient buoyancy to avoid being dragged down under reasonably foreseeable circumstances.|$|R
40|$|For {{the past}} 15 years my {{practice}} as a textile conservator and artist has stimulated an ongoing dialog between myself as a textile maker and the weavers of ancient textiles. A human hair caught in the web of a cloth, a weaver’s choice of interlacement patterns and the deliberate manipulation of woven motifs all mark the presence of “the weaver. ” Who were these people, why do their creations make us marvel and how can our experience as contemporary weavers add to the scholarship of ancient textiles? Because of the structural simplicity of tapestry weave, analyzing an intricate design from a culture {{such as that of}} Pre-Columbian Peru allows us to {{come face to face with}} an individual weaver’s decision making processes concerning technique and design. In tapestry, the weaver is essentially “drawing” with thread, an individualized act that reflects personal and cultural sensibilities and enhances the immediacy of the medium through time. Through slides gleaned from research and my conservation practice, highlighting the recent conservation of a pictorial Wari tunic, I will elaborate on the following theme: The tapestry medium offers considerable freedom to the creator. Viewed through a continuum of several centuries, the decision-making processes of the weaver, evidenced in such practices as <b>lazy</b> <b>lines,</b> dovetailing, and slits, gives us clues to what these people valued and thought, and offers insights for contemporary tapestry artists and textile scholars...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Lazy</b> <b>Line</b> Painter Jane was Belle & Sebastian's second EP, {{released}} in 1997 on Jeepster Records. The title track features guest vocalist Monica Queen and {{was recorded in}} a church hall. [...] "A Century of Elvis" [...] features bassist Stuart David reading out a story he had written, over music by the band. The backing music from that track was later used on [...] "A Century of Fakers" [...] from 3.. 6.. 9 Seconds of Light. The front cover features Thea Martin holding Reason and Reality: The Relationship Between Science and Theology by John Polkinghorne. The EP was later re-packaged {{as part of the}} <b>Lazy</b> <b>Line</b> Painter Jane box-set, and all four tracks were collected on the Push Barman to Open Old Wounds compilation.

5000|$|Alliteration is {{a figure}} of speech which is stylistic {{literary}} device identified by the repeated sound of the first letter or second {{in a series of}} multiple words, or the repetition of the same letter sounds in stressed syllables of a phrase. [...] "Alliteration" [...] is from the Latin word littera, meaning [...] "letter of the alphabet", and the first known use of the word to refer to a literary device occurred around 1624. Alliteration narrowly refers to the repetition of a letter in any syllables that, according to the poem's meter, are stressed, as in James Thomson's verse [...] "Come…dragging the <b>lazy</b> languid <b>Line</b> along". Another example is [...] "Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers".|$|R

60|$|DEAR HOWELLS,--I have {{to write}} a <b>line,</b> <b>lazy</b> as I am, to say how your Poe article delighted me; {{and to say that}} I am in {{agreement}} with substantially all you say about his literature. To me his prose is unreadable--like Jane Austin's. No, there is a difference. I could read his prose on salary, but not Jane's. Jane is entirely impossible. It seems a great pity that they allowed her to die a natural death.|$|R
40|$|I give {{encouragement}} to David Nickell and the Between the Rivers community by offering {{an account of}} good relations between a government natural resource land management agency and local people: Canada's St. Lawrence Islands National Park {{and the people of}} the Thousand Islands, focusing on Grenadier Island. I speak from my perspective as a descendent of the former year-round community on Grenadier. I describe our diaspora, our heated disagreement with the St. Lawrence Islands National Park's 1970 s expansion plans, and how the local community successfully engaged a dialogue that ended these plans. I recount what I term the double politics of dialogue, a "good-cop/bad-cop" approach used by the community, and its resulting providence of good relations. I conclude with the prospect of such providence for the people of Between the Rivers. REFLEXIVE STATEMENT I consider it a great fortune that I can count David Nickell as a friend. In 2006, I stayed overnight at David's farm, walking the pastures, meeting the horses, picking tunes with his daughter, and drinking moonshine in the machine shop. He also took me to Between the Rivers, and it was a deeply affecting experience for what it taught me about heritage, decency, struggle, and commitment. ad, which one is it?" On a sandy promontory pointing south across the St. Lawrence River toward the United States lies the most wicked place I know. The Grenadier Island graveyard is a wild and windy spot, half-abandoned, {{a mile and a half}} off-shore, eternal home to perhaps a hundred-and-fifty souls, their graves marked out in <b>lazy</b> <b>lines</b> of eroding stone and rotting wood. The location scout for a horror movie could not ask for better. But that is not why I find it wicked. "The family's stones are all over here, " I call back to my son Sam.

[...] SPIN {{said that the}} song was [...] "so sophomoric that borders on surreal, all syncopated dis-gibberish and loony celebrity-baiting." [...] The New York Times said that the song was [...] "brilliantly inane: Dr. Dre lays some curlicued sitars atop a <b>lazy</b> bass <b>line,</b> while Eminem pays tribute to Hilary Duff and the Olsen Twins, {{delivering}} his rhymes in a thick accent that's supposed to be either Triumph the Insult Comic Dog or Arnold Schwarzenegger (apparently, they talk the same)." [...] Slant Magazine called [...] "Ass Like That" [...] "a whole song devoted to Robert Smigel’s Triumph The Insult Comic Dog". The A.V. Club called it [...] "a track so muddled that it's hard to tell whether it's a song-length putdown of Triumph The Insult Comic Dog or an elaborate backhanded homage. The song backfires spectacularly, because Eminem and Triumph essentially share the same shtick—deflating celebrity egos with barbed wisecracks—and because at this point, Triumph is a lot funnier and more pointed in his putdowns than his human counterpart." ...|$|R
40|$|In {{friction}} stir welding (FSWing) {{the actual}} solid state joining takes place between the faying surfaces which form the weld seam. Thus the seam trace is often investigated for clues when {{the strength of the}} weld is reduced. Aluminum and its alloys are known to form a native, protective oxide on the surface. If these native surface oxides are not sufficiently broken up during the FSW process, they are reported to remain in the FSW interior and weaken the bond strength. This type of weld defect has been referred to as a lazy "S", <b>lazy</b> "Z", joint <b>line</b> defect, kissing bond, or residual oxide defect. Usually these defects are mitigated by modification of the process parameters, such as increased tool rotation rate, which causes a finer breakup of the native oxide particles. This study proposes that there may be an alternative mechanism for formation of oxides found within the weld nugget. As the oxidation rate increases at elevated temperatures above 400 C, it may be possible for enhanced oxidation to occur on the interior surfaces during the FSW process from entrained air entering the seam gap. Normally, FSWs of aluminum alloys are made without a purge gas and it is unknown how process parameters and initial fit up could affect a potential air path into the interior during the processing. In addition, variations in FSW parameters, such as the tool rotation, are known to have a strong influence on the FSW temperature which may affect the oxidation rate if internal surfaces are exposed to entrained air. A series of FSWs were made in 3 different thickness panels of AA 2219 (0. 95, 1. 27 and 1. 56 cm) at 2 different weld pitches. As the thickness of the panels increased, there was an increased tendency for a gap to form in advance of the weld tool. If sufficient air is able to enter the workpiece gap prior to consolidation, the weld temperature can increase the oxidation rate on the interior surfaces. These oxidation rates would also be accelerated in areas of localized liquation. Metallographs from the weld panels showed indications of liquation at the grain boundaries. In FSWs of thicker panels, these regions of liquation were found to be heavily oxidized. The quality of the FSWs was evaluated from tensile testing at room temperature. As the panel thickness increased, a slight decrease in tensile strength was observed which was attributed to the presence of oxides. No oxide formation was observed in the thinner workpieces, although there were indications of localized liquation at the grain boundaries. Results from this study will assist in a better understand of the mechanisms of oxide formation in FSW interiors and provide methodology for minimizing their occurrence...|$|R
