500|$|When {{designing}} Dragon Quest, Horii play-tests {{the games}} {{to make certain}} the controls feel right. This includes going into meticulous details such as how fast a page opens or the way a door opens. According to Horii, [...] "... little things <b>like</b> <b>here</b> and there the controls not feeling right and such can really grate the players' nerves if the tempo isn't right." [...] He believes players {{should be able to}} control the game unconsciously, which is not easy to accomplish. Horii tries to design the games {{in such a way that}} players never need to read a manual nor play through a tutorial in order to figure out how to play the game, and tries to create good storylines with short dialogues. Ryutaro Ichimura, who has worked on Dragon Quest titles with Horii since Dragon QuestVIII, has implemented Horii's suggestions even when it is not obvious why his ideas will work. [...] " [...] lot of the time when he [...] points these things out, we cannot see them at first, but eventually you get it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Girly Edition" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by critics. It {{was named the}} fifth best episode with a sports theme of the series by Jerry Greene of the Orlando Sentinel. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, thought well of the episode, calling it [...] "a great episode, full of more than the normal quota of good jokes", adding, [...] "best of all is Lisa's revenge on Bart, and the mad cat-lady who goes around chucking her cats at people." [...] Ryan Keefer of DVD Verdict gave the episode a B rating and stated that he enjoyed the subplot with Mojo more than the main plot. Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide commented that [...] "Girly Edition" [...] takes [...] "a clever concept and turns into something more than expected as it digs into the usual Bart/Lisa rivalry. I’m not quite sure why Bart reacts so sadly to Lisa’s comments about his stupidity when 'Lisa the Simpson' just delved into the dumbness of the male Simpsons. There’s enough to <b>like</b> <b>here</b> to make the episode fun, though." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} leaked onto the {{internet}} in later October 2009 with several preliminary tracks from Raymond v. Raymond. [...] "Hey Daddy (Daddy's Home)", one of the tracks that follows-up Usher's divorce, and the change in content from Here I Stand, back to Confessions-style, was one of six tracks co-written by Rico Love for the album. In an exclusive with Rap-Up, Love said of Usher's return to that style, [...] "I feel like he’s got his mind right and it’s focused. He went through a lot. He had lost his father when he was creating the Here I Stand record, {{a lot of controversy}} with his marriage, he had kids, he parted ways with his mother’s management, and there were just {{a lot of things going}} on and he kind of lost focus. It’s not <b>like</b> <b>Here</b> I Stand wasn’t a good album. I just feel like he lost touch with his demographic." [...] According to MTV News, the song provides the reasons behind Usher's crumbling marriage as narrated in [...] "Papers". The remix version featuring Plies made its way onto {{the internet in}} late November, a few days before the song's radio and digital release.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a review}} for BBC.co.uk, Lisa Haines praised {{the sound of}} Pushing the Senses, stating [...] "The brand of raucous rock anthem which catapulted them to fame is {{virtually}} absent here, the band's new sound is far more thoughtful and understated. 'Feeling A Moment' and 'Tumble And Fall' are prime examples. Both have Coldplay inspired soaring vocals and catchy melodies, but a little of their lyrical hand wringing seems to have crept in too", and later said [...] "That's {{not to say the}} album is bad, because {{there is a lot to}} <b>like</b> <b>here.</b> 'Pilgrim Soul' and title track 'Pushing The Senses' see Feeder thrash furiously away at their instruments, which should appease those who prefer their earlier work".|$|E

I've {{been working on the}} new vault, the Yurchenko double twist and it's paying off, I was really happy with that today." [...] In team finals, she competed on vault, uneven bars, and floor for the British team which placed fourth. [...] "I had good {{performances}} all round and I'm really happy with how the team have done. I was nervous coming into this event but think I've coped really well. To make no mistakes in all my routines so far is brilliant, my floor has been solid all week so I'm looking forward to the final tomorrow."

2500|$|ZMET {{was born}} {{during a trip}} Zaltman took to remote areas of Nepal in 1990. [...] He gave locals, who had never taken photos before, cameras to take {{pictures}} of important things and events in their lives. [...] For example, in some cases, the assignment was: What photos would you take if you wanted to show someone else what life was <b>like</b> <b>here?</b> Two weeks later he returned to the regions covered initially, gave copies to the photographers, and interviewed them about the meaning of their photos. [...] Zaltman realized just how powerful the use of images “owned” by those being interviewed were in gaining a deep understanding of their implicit or tacit assumptions and beliefs. Zaltman noticed, for example, that they often cut off the feet of people appearing in their images. [...] It was discovered that this was deliberate. The Nepalese did not want to embarrass their friends and neighbors by showing their bare feet, which was a sign of poverty, and for this reason deliberately chose to leave it out of the photographic record.|$|E
2500|$|GameSpy's Matthew Freeman {{scored the}} GameCube version 3 out of 5, writing [...] "Sierra has {{produced}} an adventure {{that allows for}} enough puzzling, sidetracking, and combat for both gamers that love the book, and gamers who only love a fun game. The younger crowds and Tolkien fanatics will find a lot to <b>like</b> <b>here,</b> but veteran gamers may feel as if they're in all too familiar territory." [...] Dan Bennett was less impressed with the PC version, scoring it 2 out of 5. He wrote [...] "The Hobbit is {{just as likely to}} disappoint big-time Tolkien fans as its troubled gameplay is likely to disappoint the average gamer." [...] He felt the game failed to appeal specifically to younger gamers, adults or Tolkien fans; [...] "The Hobbit is a game that doesn't know what audience it's going for. Its look and feel is too juvenile for adults, and some of its challenges are too difficult and frustrating for kids. Even rabid Tolkien fans won't care for the game, thanks to its translation of the classic novel into a lightweight, cartoonish platformer. It has a few redeeming qualities, but it's a sad waste of great source material." ...|$|E
