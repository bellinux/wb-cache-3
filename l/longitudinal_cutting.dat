40|$|The {{degree to}} which adult medical male {{circumcision}} (MC) programs can reduce new HIV infections in a moderate HIV prevalence country like Papua New Guinea (PNG) are uncertain especially given the widespread prevalence of longitudinal foreskin cuts among adult males. We estimated the likely impact of a medical MC intervention in PNG using a mathematical model of HIV transmission. The model was age-structured and incorporated separate components for sex, rural/urban, {{men who have sex}} with men and female sex workers. Country-specific data of the prevalence of foreskin cuts, sexually transmitted infections, condom usage, and the acceptability of MC were obtained by our group through related studies. If <b>longitudinal</b> foreskin <b>cutting</b> has a protective efficacy of 20 % compared to 60 % for MC, then providing MC to 20 % of uncut males from 2012 would require 376, 000 procedures, avert 7, 900 HIV infections by 2032, and require 143 MC per averted infection. Targeting uncut urban youths would achieve the most cost effective returns of 54 MC per HIV infection averted. These numbers of MC required to avert an HIV infection change little even with coverage up to 80 % of men. The greater the protective efficacy of longitudinal foreskin cuts against HIV acquisition, the less impact MC interventions will have. Dependent on this efficacy, increasing condom use could have a much greater impact with a 10 percentage point increase averting 18, 400 infections over this same period. MC programs could be effective in reducing HIV infections in PNG, particularly in high prevalence populations. However the overall impact is highly dependent on the protective efficacy of ex isting <b>longitudinal</b> foreskin <b>cutting</b> in preventing HIV. © 2014 Gray et al...|$|R

40|$|Ultrasonic cutting is an {{established}} {{technology in the}} cutting of food products. As the high-cost components of an ultrasonic cutting system are the ultrasonic generator and transducer, some designs have concentrated on running several cutting blades from a single power source. This strategy is undoubtedly economic, but problems remain with reliability. Blade failure during cutting is a common problem in ultrasonic systems and therefore strategies are proposed to reduce stress levels at the failure locations. Many alternative blade profiles are investigated using finite element (FE) models, which are validated by experimental modal analysis (EMA) using a 3 D laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV). Combining three strategies can reduce the stress level at the failure location on cutting blades. The first investigates the blade profile at the failure location {{with the aim of}} incorporating sufficient gain at reduced stress levels. The second concentrates on detuning the block horn and blades in order to move the longitudinal node away from the highest stressed section of the blade. Finally, a redesign of the block horn is studied in order to eliminate the effects of blade flexural vibrations in the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>cutting</b> mode...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the cutting of {{agglomerated}} materials with an abrasive water jet {{from the point of}} view of surface finish undulation. It shows the impact on un-dulation of technical and technological parameters (feed rate and abrasive mass flow) and material parameters (material thickness and cutting direction). The paper also contains a methodology for the assessment of the effect of these parameters on surface finish undulation, and presents the results of experiments using this metho-dology on MDF, OSB boards and on technical beech plywood. MDF boards, out of all the materials monitored, have the most homogeneous structure throughout their whole cross section, which affected the insignificance of parameter Ra. For OSB boards, a lower surface quality with a higher feed rate was found, in contrast to plywood, where a higher feed rate improved the surface quality.

The rapidly advancing floodwater table {{at the onset of}} the aquatic phase interrupts the inward diffusion of oxygen from the atmosphere to submerged plant parts. Salix martiana (Leyb.) (Salicaceae) and Tabemaemontana juruana ((Markgr.) Schumann ex J. F. Maebride) (Apocynaceae), tree species typical of Amazon floodplains, respond to low oxygen concentrations by forming adventitious roots capable of <b>longitudinal</b> oxygen transport. <b>Cuttings</b> of these tree species were subjected to simulated flooding and the oxygen concentration of the root cortex was temporally monitored by oxygen microelectrodes that penetrated the roots. Changes in the floodwater table made it possible to localize precisely the entry points of atmospheric oxygen. Under experimental conditions, mathematical description of the transport kinetics revealed that longitudinal transport Of 02 in both species was mainly attributable to diffusion. Based on the finding that diffusion was inhibited by a small increase in the floodwater table, we conclude that internal oxygen transport during a rising water table is only attainable when adventitious roots are continuously and rapidly developed, as is the case in S. martiana. In T. juruana, slow growth of adventitious roots and low root porosity suggest that other adaptations are required to overcome long flooding periods...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Crack opening {{is one of}} the key {{parameters}} {{affecting the}} UT response of the crack. Tight cracks with small opening tend to be more difficult to detect and characterize than cracks that have wider opening. In particular, the opening of crack tip has marked effect on the crack tip diffraction signal often used for crack sizing. Service-induced cracks found exhibit wide variety of different openings. The opening is affected by the service loads and crack growth mechanism. In general, cracks grown by high loads tend to have wider opening than cracks produced by small loads. Furthermore, residual stresses may alter the opening. In order to simulate the wide variety of openings of the service-induced cracks, a novel method for producing artificial flaws with controlled opening is presented. A set of similar realistic flaws was produced by controlled thermal fatigue loading. The as-produced "baseline " UT response of these cracks was recorded with phased array technique using shear waves. Some of the flaws were then subjected to different loading sequences to manipulate their opening. The UT response of the modified cracks was then recorded and compared to that of the baseline response. The crack tip signals were measured also with <b>longitudinal</b> waves before <b>cutting</b> the specimen. Finally, the sample was carefully sectioned to reveal the opening of the produced flaws and the effect of crack opening to the UT response is analyzed. ...|$|R

The first order cutting force equations were developed utilizing the response surface methodology (RSM) to study the effect of input cutting parameters including the cutting speed, feed rate, radial depth and axial depth of cut. The explicit code was used to estimate the cutting and thrust forces. It {{can be seen that}} the <b>longitudinal</b> component of <b>cutting</b> force predicted by RMS and finite element analysis (FEA) are excellent agreement with the experimental results at 95 % of confident interval.

40|$|Objectives: A high {{incidence}} of failure of transverse thoracosternotomy closure, involving the loops of wire cutting through the sternum, remains a significant morbidity after bilateral lung transplantation. We postulated that placing peristernal wires inside the usual longitudinal wires could prevent the <b>longitudinal</b> wires from <b>cutting</b> through the sternum. The aims {{of this study were}} to investigate the biomechanical and clinical efficacy of the proposed reinforced sternal closure technique. Methods: In vitro, 24 artificial sternal models were wired with the reinforced or conventional wiring techniques and were tested either by means of longitudinal distraction or anterior–posterior shear (n = 6 per group). In vivo, the 6 -month outcomes of 70 bilateral lung transplantations, including 27 reinforced and 43 conventional wiring techniques, were assessed. Results: Reinforced wiring was stronger than conventional wiring for both longitudinal distraction (yield load: 585 ± 60 vs 334 ± 21 N [P =. 03]; maximum load: 807 ± 60 vs 525 ± 34 N [P =. 03]; postyield stiffness: 91. 0 ± 22. 0 vs 32. 8 ± 11. 8 N/mm [P =. 04]) and anterior–posterior shear (yield load: 405 ± 9 vs 364 ± 16 N [P =. 03]; postyield stiffness: 47. 4 ± 6. 1 vs 27. 5 ± 5. 1 N/mm [P =. 04]). In multivariate analysis, the use of the conventional wiring technique (odds ratio, 5. 38; P =. 04) and osteoporosis (odds ratio, 18. 31; P =. 0005) were significant risk factors associated with sternal dehiscence. In the patients with osteoporosis (n = 25), the incidence of sternal dehiscence in the reinforced wiring group (4 / 16 [25 %]) was significantly lower than that in the conventional wiring group (7 / 9 [78 %], P =. 02). Conclusion: Osteoporosis is a significant risk factor for sternal dehiscence after bilateral lung transplantation. The new reinforced sternal wiring technique provides biomechanically superior fixation of the sternum and clinically reduces the incidence of sternal dehiscence in high-risk osteoporotic patients undergoing bilateral lung transplantation...|$|R
40|$|Seismic {{assessment}} of reinforced concrete structures {{as well as}} their rehabilitation and strengthening is dealt with in many experimental and theoretical researches. New trends in seismic assessment essentially refer to “performance based design”. Experimental research both on seismic {{assessment of}} existing elements {{as well as on the}} efficiency of different retrofitting techniques is essential. Much research is currently being directed towards retrofitting solutions for existing reinforced concrete structures under seismic load. Among these, fibre-reinforced polymer (frp) confinement of elements stressed under axial and/or bending action is an increasingly popular solution, with a similar trend in research effort. Confining concrete can in fact significantly enhance both its resistance and stiffness properties; the exterior frp jacket, besides, protects the inner core from temperature and humidity effects, adding to its durability. This paper focuses on current experimental tests at the Laboratory of experiments on materials and structures of the University of Roma Tre on eight 1 : 6 scaled column specimens representative of tall and squat 2, 500 m diameter circular r. c. piers of regular (14 - 21 - 14 m tall) and irregular bridges (14 - 7 - 21 m tall) designed according to EC 8 and Italian Code before 1986. In previous research some columns were tested until collapse by pseudodynamic tests but others are still entire. An accurate study to detect the level of degradation in materials, as the case of real structures after an earthquake, is now performed. Piers designed according to Italian Code show dearth in transverse reinforcement resulting in concrete core crushing in compression and longitudinal bar buckling and rupture. Concrete cover spalling and yielding of hoops are clearly visible at pier base over a height of about 200 - 300 mm. Squat piers are also affected by shear cracking which spread with an about 52 °- 56 ° inclination angle. EC 8 pier damage is restricted to concrete cover spalling and longitudinal bar buckling due to localized hoop arrangement. Based on the evaluation done, EC 8 columns are repaired and Italian ones retrofitted by mean of FRP jacket with the aim of enhancing ductility and shear capacity. Repairing operations are described in detail. Mechanical removal of damaged concrete cover followed by cleaning of substrate from residue particles is performed to provide a good bond. Concrete core is repaired with resin injections. Two different restoring operations are forseen for damaged <b>longitudinal</b> reinforcing bars: <b>cutting</b> of the damaged portion of the bars and restoration with welded stainless bars on one hand, setting of 1 m length stainless bars anchored in foundation to support existing bars on the other hand. New bars are applied in pairs to avoid asymmetries. Casting self compacting concrete is used to restore damaged pier section. Its low shrinkage, elastic modulus not higher than the one of the substrate and high tensile strength allow to reduce tensile stresses in the material. In addition, good workability and resistence to segregation and remarcable filling and passing ability make self compacting concrete suitable to intervene on existing structures, since it’s neccesary to assure that the new material could really restore element continuity and homogeneity (crossing new and existing reinforcing bars without causing hollow spaces inside the element and discontinuity in the contact surface). C-FRP (Mapewrap C UNI-AX 300 / 10) jacket is applied to upgrade ductility in tall piers and to increase shear strength in squat piers to match EC 8 prescriptions. Confinement increases concrete compressive strength and ultimate strain and also provide longitudinal bars constraint against buckling preventing cover spalling. According to Monti et al. approach, using 0. 167 mm thick C-FRP, 1 layer is needed to obtain the required ductility upgrade. FRP jacket to get EC 8 shear strength is designed following guide lines proposals (EC 8, OPCM 2003 n. 3274, CNR 2004 DT 200, FIB 2001 n. 14) either adopting suggested values or considering experimentally measured parameters neglecting safety coefficients: using 0. 167 mm thick C-FRP, 2 layers and 1 layer are needed respectively. Wrapped strips are unidirectional 100 mm wide with interval of 60 mm with the exception of the first one which is only 30 mm. FRP strips are set over the plastic hinge zone in case of tall piers and over the whole height in case of squat piers. The test equipment is composed by a system for the application of vertical loads: the specimen is placed within a testing frame realized using a 1000 kN hydraulic jack fixed to a transverse beam which is linked to the ground by means of two  60 mm steel tendons with hinged connections. A 250 KN MTS hydraulic actuator, connected on one side to the top of the pier and on other side to a reaction wall, is used to impose displacements or loads to pier. The specimen footing is restrained to the laboratory strong floor using two tranverse beams fixed to ground with steel tendonds in order to avoid any base horizontal displacements and rotations. Horizontal displacements (or loads) are applied by using the built-in MTS control system composed by an LVDT with stroke +/- 125 mm (or a 250 kN load cell), the digital controller Testar II and the acquisition software TestWare. The same system is used to acquire horizontal displacements and loads. A parallel acquisition is performed by using an external data acquisition system (DEWETRON DEWE-RACK) with 16 channels togheter with a 500 kS/s National Instruments E-Series DAQ (AT-MIO- 16 E- 1) with 16 analog inputs. In particular, the horizontal displacements of three point of the pier, placed respectively at the hight 230 mm, 450 mm and 1290 mm, are recorded using 3 linear potentiometers (stroke +/- 50 mm), whereas other 12 linear potentiometers are used for the acquisition of vertical displacements of other three different pier sections in order to estimate their curvature along the height. Finally the vertical load is acquired by means of a 1000 kN load cell. Actual cyclic quasi-static tests aim to evaluate existing piers and the effectiveness of the efficiency of repairing and retrofitting techniques. Pseudodynamic tests are foreseen in the next future. Six cyclic tests (5 displacement controlled and 1 force controlled) have been performed on a squat EC 8 pier both to evaluate its elastic stiffness and to check and calibrate test instrumentation equipment functioning. Moment-curvature diagrams and top pier total displacement, distinguishing contributions due to flexure and shear, are presented...|$|R

30|$|Boron nitride nanoribbons (BNNRs) {{which are}} strips of the BN nanosheets (BNNSs) with {{nanoscale}} widths, possess interesting electrical and optical properties {{due to their}} unique edge states and width-related properties. Therefore, a comparison between two dimensional BNNSs with one dimensional tubular BN nanotubes (BNNTs) would be an interesting and significant study [1]. In fact, the BNNRs have adjustable half-metallic property because their bandgaps can be altered by various factors, such as nanoribbon’s width, electric field, and edge functionalization with hydrogen, fluorine, and oxygen atoms [2 – 6]. BNNSs and BNNTs are electrically insulating, and they have large bandgaps (e.g., 5.5  eV) [7, 8]. BNNRs exhibit higher chemical reactivity [9] than those of BNNSs and BNNTs due to their numerous unsaturated edge atoms, which makes BNNRs a potential candidate in the fabrication of gas sensor. Moreover, BNNRs {{can be used as}} fillers in enhancing mechanical property of composites due to strong interfacial interaction between BNNR edges and matrix. Previous study showed that BNNRs exhibited higher electrical conductivity than BNNTs [10]. Accordingly, the BNNRs are highly promising in the fabrication of nanoscale electronic and optoelectronic materials, sensor, catalysts, and functional composites [11 – 15]. Several procedures for producing BNNRs have been developed via the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>cutting</b> of BNNTs using plasma etching with alkali metal intercalation [10], expansion of intercalated potassium [16], and unzipping of BNNTs during the nanotube synthesis under extreme conditions [11].|$|E
40|$|AbstractLaser {{technology}} {{has been used in}} industrial processes for several decades. The most advanced development and implementation took place in laser welding and cutting of metals in automotive and ship building industries. However, there is high potential to apply laser processing to other materials in various industrial fields. One of these potential fields could be paper industry to fulfill the demand for high quality, fast and reliable cutting technology. Difficulties in industrial application of laser cutting for paper industry are associated to lack of basic information, awareness of technology and its application possibilities. Nowadays possibilities of using laser cutting for paper materials are widened and high automation level of equipment has made this technology more interesting for manufacturing processes. Promising area of laser cutting application at paper making machines is <b>longitudinal</b> <b>cutting</b> of paper web (edge trimming). There are few locations at a paper making machine where edge trimming is usually done: wet press section, calender or rewinder. Paper web is characterized with different moisture content at different points of the paper making machine. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of moisture content of paper material on laser cutting parameters. Effect of moisture content on cellulose fibers, laser absorption and energy needed for cutting is described as well. Laser cutting tests were carried out using CO 2 laser...|$|E
40|$|Surgical {{exposure}} of the clivus is difficult because of its proximity to vital neurovascular structures. The anatomic bases of a new surgical approach to this area are discussed. A supra-auricular skin incision is extended toward the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The vertebral artery is exposed from C 2 to the occiput unroofing the foramen transversarium of C 1. The bone removal consists of a posterior temporal craniotomy, a suboccipital craniectomy, including mastoidectomy with sigmoid sinus unroofing, removal of the lateral margin of the foramen magnum, of the medial third of the occipital condyle, and retrolabyrinthine petrous drilling. Posterior retraction of the vertebral artery facilitates occipital condyle drilling. Intradural {{exposure of}} the petroclival region is achieved by L-shaped cutting of the dura with the long branch placed infratentorially anterior to the sigmoid sinus. Intradural {{exposure of the}} craniospinal/upper cervical areas is achieved by cutting of the dura medial to the distal sigmoid sinus and by <b>longitudinal</b> <b>cutting</b> of the dura anterior to the vertebral artery. This approach allows multiple ports of entry to the clivus with full control of the vertebrobasilar system, and of the dural sinuses, and is anatomically suited for controlled removal of tumors located in these areas. This approach, or segments of it, has been used successfully {{in the treatment of}} large neoplasms of the craniovertebral junction...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} geotropic {{stimulation}} on auxin production in Vicia faba root tips was studied. Paper chromatography techniques {{were used to}} separate the growth substances. Three assay methods (oat first internode, oat coleoptile and pea root section tests) {{were used for the}} detection and estimation of growth substances on chromatograms. An assessment was made of a number of sources of error in the preparation of material and the extraction, purification and chromatography of extracts. Geotropic stimulation brought about an increased synthesis of an ether soluble acid auxin in root tips. The maximum amount was formed at 20 minutes stimulation and this fell to the minimum value, recorded after 40 minutes stimulation. The auxin content from longitudinally split root tips was less than the auxin content from whole root tips. This decrease was thought to be an artefact caused by <b>longitudinal</b> <b>cutting</b> of the roots. No difference was found in the auxin content between the upper and lower half of the tip. The water soluble auxins of whole and split roots were investigated. Geotropic stimulation produced a change in content of all the auxins. Colour tests and fluorimetric analyses were made on the water soluble fraction. 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine and tryptophan were identified from the water soluble fraction. Substances giving a phenolic reaction coincided with areas of high growth activity. Alkaline hydrolysis revealed the presence of water soluble indole complexes. <p...|$|E

Area of study : The study area was in the region of the Vale do Rio Doce - Minas Gerais, Brazil. Material and methods : A diametrical board with dimensions of 60 x 18 x 5 cm (length x width x thickness, respectively), with more than 1. 3 m from the ground, was removed. In machining trials, a 400 mm diameter circular saw was used, with 24 “WZ” teeth, feed rate of 10 m. min - 1, cutting speed of 61 m. s - 1, and maximum instantaneous torque of 92. 5 N. m. During cutting, test specimens were removed with alternated and parallel 1. 5 cm edges in 6 radial positions, which were used for biometric determination of cell structure and basic density. Main results : It was observed that wood basic density, vessel diameter, fiber wall thickness, fiber wall fraction and fiber wall portion were directly proportional to the specific cutting force.

40|$|Laser cutting {{implementation}} possibilities into paper {{making machine}} was studied {{as the main}} objective of the work. Laser cutting technology application was considered as a replacement tool for conventional cutting methods used in paper making machines for <b>longitudinal</b> <b>cutting</b> such as edge trimming at different paper making process and tambour roll slitting. Laser cutting of paper was tested in 70 ’s for the first time. Since then, laser cutting and processing has been applied for paper materials with different level of success in industry. Laser cutting can be employed for <b>longitudinal</b> <b>cutting</b> of paper web in machine direction. The most common conventional cutting methods include water jet cutting and rotating slitting blades applied in paper making machines. Cutting with CO 2 laser fulfils basic requirements for cutting quality, applicability to material and cutting speeds in all locations where <b>longitudinal</b> <b>cutting</b> is needed. Literature review provided description of advantages, disadvantages and challenges of laser technology when it was applied for cutting of paper material with particular attention to cutting of moving paper web. Based on studied laser cutting capabilities and problem definition of conventional cutting technologies, preliminary selection {{of the most promising}} application area was carried out. Laser cutting (trimming) of paper web edges in wet end was estimated to be the most promising area where it can be implemented. This assumption was {{made on the basis of}} rate of web breaks occurrence. It was found that up to 64 % of total number of web breaks occurred in wet end, particularly in location of so called open draws where paper web was transferred unsupported by wire or felt. Distribution of web breaks in machine cross direction revealed that defects of paper web edge was the main reason of tearing initiation and consequent web break. The assumption was made that laser cutting was capable of improvement of laser cut edge tensile strength due to high cutting quality and sealing effect of the edge after laser cutting. Studies of laser ablation of cellulose supported this claim. Linear energy needed for cutting was calculated with regard to paper web properties in intended laser cutting location. Calculated linear cutting energy was verified with series of laser cutting. Practically obtained laser energy needed for cutting deviated from calculated values. This could be explained by difference in heat transfer via radiation in laser cutting and different absorption characteristics of dry and moist paper material. Laser cut samples (both dry and moist (dry matter content about 25 - 40 %)) were tested for strength properties. It was shown that tensile strength and strain break of laser cut samples are similar to corresponding values of non-laser cut samples. Chosen method, however, did not address tensile strength of laser cut edge in particular. Thus, the assumption of improving strength properties with laser cutting was not fully proved. Laser cutting effect on possible pollution of mill broke (recycling of trimmed edge) was carried out. Laser cut samples (both dry and moist) were tested on the content of dirt particles. The tests revealed that accumulation of dust particles on the surface of moist samples can take place. This has to be taken into account to prevent contamination of pulp suspension when trim waste is recycled. Material loss due to evaporation during laser cutting and amount of solid residues after cutting were evaluated. Edge trimming with laser would result in 0. 25 kg/h of solid residues and 2. 5 kg/h of lost material due to evaporation. Schemes of laser cutting implementation and needed laser equipment were discussed. Generally, laser cutting system would require two laser sources (one laser source for each cutting zone), set of beam transfer and focusing optics and cutting heads. In order to increase reliability of system, it was suggested that each laser source would have double capacity. That would allow to perform cutting employing one laser source working at full capacity for both cutting zones. Laser technology is in required level at the moment and do not require additional development. Moreover, capacity of speed increase is high due to availability high power laser sources what can support the tendency of speed increase of paper making machines. Laser cutting system would require special roll to maintain cutting. The scheme of such roll was proposed as well as roll integration into paper making machine. Laser cutting can be done in location of central roll in press section, before so-called open draw where many web breaks occur, where it has potential to improve runability of a paper making machine. Economic performance of laser cutting was done as comparison of laser cutting system and water jet cutting working in the same conditions. It was revealed that laser cutting would still be about two times more expensive compared to water jet cutting. This is mainly due to high investment cost of laser equipment and poor energy efficiency of CO 2 lasers. Another factor is that laser cutting causes material loss due to evaporation whereas water jet cutting almost does not cause material loss. Despite difficulties of laser cutting implementation in paper making machine, its implementation can be beneficial. The crucial role in that is possibility to improve cut edge strength properties and consequently reduce number of web breaks. Capacity of laser cutting to maintain cutting speeds which exceed current speeds of paper making machines what is another argument to consider laser cutting technology in design of new high speed paper making machines...|$|E
