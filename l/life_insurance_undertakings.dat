40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided into two parts. The first part {{involves}} the new solvency directive for the insurance industry in the European Union, Solvency II, which will be implemented in 2012. The second part involves valuation strategies under the new directive. First, I investigate the concept of solvency and introduce the current solvency directive, the Solvency I directive. Then I investigate the Solvency II directive especially for <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>undertakings</b> within the European Union, which Norway have agreed to follow. I describe the technical specifications of the Solvency II directive, including its definitions and formulas, and discuss modifications which have to be implemented for Norwegian <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>undertakings.</b> The Solvency II directive requires that the undertakings valuate both the asset side, and liability side in a market consistent way. I therefore investigate a method of achieving a market consistent valuation of both sides. This method links the insurance cash flow to financial instruments. Then by finding the market values of the financial instruments, I can find the value of the insurance portfolio...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{regulation}} reasons, <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>undertakings</b> {{have long}} been struggling with interest rate variations. In the post-ﬁnancial-crisis era, most life insurance ﬁrms in Western countries are facing two major challenges, the one is the dropdown of interest rates {{and the other is}} the increase of longevity. Many supervisory authorities have warned <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>undertakings</b> in their countries that their current portfolios are not adaquate to generate enough returns for future payments to the insured, because most of their assets are made of ﬁxed-income products. The consequence of low interest rates and increasing longevity is that premiums are becoming more expensive and the company s technical provisions are becoming higher than before, which will reduce <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>undertakings</b> competitive conditions compared to other ﬁnancial institutions. The varying nature and crucial importance of interest rates make it unrealistic to assume them as constant in calculating prospective reserves, especially when it is taken into account the fact that most life insurance products last decades long or even life-long. This thesis explores the possibility of calculating prospective reserves when interest rates are assumed varying. Since stochastic interest rates are represented in bond markets, a unit-linked scheme will be utilized to connect the insurance market to the bond market. A more realistic assumption than varying interest rates is varying interest rates with jumps. L´evy processes are a good candidate for modelling stochastic interest rates with jumps, and hence will be applied in this thesis. However, the permission of jumps in the pricing model will destroy the market-completeness assumption, making it necessary to use a speciﬁc criterion for selecting a risk-neutral probability measure for discounting future cash ﬂows. In this thesis, an Esscher transform will be applied since it preserves the L´evy process. The result of the recursive formula for calculating prospective reserves with stochastic interest rates with jumps is an integro-partial diﬀerential equation which in general does not have an analytical solution...|$|E
40|$|The last {{decades have}} been characterised by {{financial}} liberalisation and internationalisation of financial markets. Still, {{the financial sector}} has remained more tightly regulated than most others. Due to financial institutions‟, and especially banks‟, crucial position within financial markets and their systemic nature, financial liberalisation has walked {{hand in hand with}} stricter industry regulation. In the EU a certain overall level of harmonisation is sought in all Member States, also within the financial sector, extending to Norway through its EEA Membership and the EEA Agreement. An important part of this harmonisation, although often set aside in favour of the more pressing questions of capital adequacy and liquidity ratios, is the regulation of the taking-up of businesses and pursuit of holdings within the financial sector. Through a long line of Internal Market directives the European Commission has attempted to provide harmonised prudential assessment regulation and authorisation practices for the taking up and pursuit of businesses within the sector. This article discusses Norwegian private ownership regulation in regards to the taking up and pursuit of the businesses of credit institutions and (<b>life)</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>undertakings</b> and its legitimacy under EEA law. In chapters 2 and 3 we review the legal method of interpretation and the relevant regulatory scenery. Subsequently, chapter 4 discusses Norwegian assessment practice relating to pursuit of the business of financial institutions, while chapter 5 discusses the assessment practice relating to the taking up of these businesses, as well as the Norwegian public offering rules for credit institutions and insurance undertakings...|$|E
40|$|The European Directive Solvency II has {{increased}} the request of stochastic Asset-Liability Management models for <b>insurance</b> <b>undertakings.</b> The Directive has established that <b>insurance</b> <b>undertakings</b> can develop their own “internal models” {{for the evaluation of}} values and risks in the contracts. In this chapter, we give an overview on some computational issues related to internal models. The analysis is carried out on “Italian style” profit-sharing <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> policies (PS policies) with minimum guarantees. We describe some approaches for the development of accurate and efficient algorithms for their simulation. In particular, we discuss the development of parallel software procedures. Main computational kernels arising in models employed in this framework are stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and high-dimensional integrals. We show how one can develop accurate and efficient procedures for PS policies simulation applying different numerical methods for SDEs and techniques for accelerating Monte Carlo simulations for the evaluation of the integrals. Moreover, we show that the choice of an appropriate probability measure provides a significative gain in terms of accuracy...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study {{presents}} {{the legislation that}} regulates the Romanian unit-linked <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> market. The main document that regulates both the insurance business on Romanian market and the organizing and operating of the Insurance Supervisory Commission (CSA) is Law no. 32 / 2000 on <b>insurance</b> <b>undertakings</b> and <b>insurance</b> supervision, as amended and supplemented, which provides: organizing and operating of insurance, insurance/reinsurance and reinsurance undertakings, of mutual undertakings, {{as well as of}} insurance intermediaries; organizing and operating of the CSA; supervision of the <b>insurance</b> and reinsurance <b>undertakings</b> conducting business in or from Romania; supervision of the insurance and reinsurance intermediaries, as well as the supervision of other activities related to the insurance mediation. The legislation which regulates the Romanian insurance market includes: norms issued by CSA; laws and governmental ordinances that regulate the Romanian financial market; CSA draft regulations which are to be submitted to consulting with the players on the market; EU Directives in the insurance field; repealed or no longer in force legislative acts and international sanctions. According to Directive, 2002 / 83 /EC, unit-linked <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> products were defined as insurance contracts where the benefits provided are directly linked to the value of units in undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) or to the value of assets contained in an internal fund owned by the insurance undertaking, usually divided into units, or a share index or some other reference value. The financial supervision shall include verification, with respect to the <b>insurance</b> <b>undertaking's</b> entire business, of its state of solvency, the establishment of technical provisions, including mathematical provisions, and of the assets covering them, in accordance with the rules laid down or practices followed in the home Member State pursuant to the provisions adopted at Community level. Each Member State shall require of every insurance undertaking whose head office is situated in its territory an adequate available solvency margin in respect of its entire business. In general the European Union requirements and the national requirements are common for all <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> products offered by an insurance company and also there is not a very clear distinction between the legislation regarding unit-linked <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> products and the one regarding traditional <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> products. Policyholders want to enjoy the benefits of equity investment in conjunction with mortality protection, and insurers have developed unit-linked contracts to meet this challenge. Unit linked <b>insurance</b> products are <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> policies with investment component. Although some unit-linked contract types pass most of the asset risk to the policyholder and involve little or no investment risk for the insurer, it was natural for insurers to incorporate payment guarantees in these new contracts...|$|R

40|$|Within the Own Risk and Solvency Assessment framework, the Solvency II {{directive}} {{introduces the}} need for <b>insurance</b> <b>undertakings</b> to have efficient tools enabling the companies to assess the continuous compliance with regulatory solvency requirements. Because of the great operational complexity resulting from each complete evaluation of the Solvency Ratio, this monitoring is often complicated to implement in practice. This issue is particularly important for <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> companies due to the high complexity to project <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> liabilities. It appears relevant in such a context to use parametric tools, such as Curve Fitting and Least Squares Monte Carlo in order to estimate, on a regular basis, {{the impact on the}} economic own funds and on the regulatory capital of the company of any change over time of its underlying risk factors. In this article, we first outline the principles of the continuous compliance requirement then we propose and implement a possible monitoring tool enabling to approximate the eligible elements and the regulatory capital over time. In a final section we compare the use of the Curve Fitting and the Least Squares Monte Carlo methodologies in a standard empirical finite sample framework, and stress adapted advices for future proxies users...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We address {{computational}} problems {{deriving from}} Solvency II compliance {{in the context}} of Italian <b>life</b> <b>insurance.</b> Solvency II re-quires <b>insurance</b> <b>undertakings</b> to perform market consistent valuation of technical provisions and continuous monitoring of risks. We examine the case of profit sharing policies with minimum guarantees, which is the most diffused type of life policy in Italy. Market consistent valuation of the complex cash flows generated by these contracts entails modelling of management actions and the use of numerical techniques in a stochastic framework, typically Monte Carlo simulation on a fine grained time grid. Fulfillment of the subsequent highly-demanding computational tasks is possible only by implementing valuation procedures in parallel and dis-tributed architectures. In this work we introduce DISAR, a Solvency II compliant system designed to work on a grid of conventional computers, and discuss its performances. ...|$|R
40|$|ORSA {{requires}} every {{insurance company}} {{to demonstrate that}} it has an effective Risk Management program, with scenario analysis, stress testing and capital solvency models in place that can help it withstand normal and extreme risk events. Each ORSA report should have risk management activities unique to the company and provide a clear explanation as to the policies, processes, and procedures it uses to identify, treat, and monitor risks to the organization {{in a way that}} the report and models used reflect the most likely and accurate picture of the company's financial performance in normal and extreme situations. The bottom line for <b>insurance</b> <b>undertakings</b> in ORSA is to provide their regulators with an insight into their ability to manage risks and stay solvent. This paper uncovers the concerns and respective dangers faced by <b>Insurance</b> <b>undertakings</b> when drawing up and using the ORSA report. It shows that, in practice there are some crucial concerns about this report, which need to be looked into and understood and which seemingly are not always being well addressed by the employees and the respective Boards. Thereby, the results of ORSA, may not be reliable and are prone to dangers and limitations. The aim is to trigger debate among <b>insurance</b> <b>undertakings</b> as to how they can apply and manage these concerns, dangers and limitations. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Conditional {{expected}} shortfalls {{calculated for}} European {{insurance companies and}} banks under stressed market conditions are shown to be of similar magnitudes. Measured at 95 % and 99 % stress levels, on data covering the period from 1995 to 2011, the equity-return tail losses of <b>insurance</b> <b>undertakings</b> and banks are indistinguishable. Granger causality analysis, on all pairs of banks and insurance companies included in the sample, shows that banks and insurance companies have equal propensity to cause each others price movements. Even though the business model of <b>insurance</b> <b>undertakings</b> {{is different from the}} business model typically applied by banks, and even though insurance companies are not depending to a similar degree on short term funding as banks, the empirical results indicate that the financial equity markets in Europe do not differentiate their trading of banks and insurance companies in periods of stress...|$|R
