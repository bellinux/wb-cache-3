As a result of the global expansion of economic liberalization, local gov-ernments around the world have become competitors in the hunt for increas-ingly mobile private capital.

Some <b>local</b> <b>governments</b> in the region have adopted economic development strategies that are similar to those used by <b>local</b> <b>governments</b> in advanced industrial nations. For instance, many Ukrainian <b>local</b> <b>governments</b> have reduced the tax burden in an attempt to attract and retain private enterprises.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to examine the problems of new <b>local</b> <b>governments</b> created by some states in Nigeria despite the challenges facing the old <b>local</b> <b>governments.</b> The constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria empowered the state <b>governments</b> to create <b>local</b> <b>governments</b> but such <b>local</b> <b>governments</b> are subject to recognition by the national assembly. Due to politics and other reasons many states governments embarked on the creation of <b>local</b> <b>governments</b> without recognition by the National assembly which lead to mockery of the state by federal government. Descriptive approach was carried out using secondary data. The findings revealed politics behind the creation of such <b>local</b> <b>governments,</b> lack of continuity as well as inadequate funding.
