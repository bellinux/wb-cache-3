5|$|Triadic joint {{attention}} {{is the highest}} level of joint attention and involves two individuals looking at an object. Each individual must understand that the other individual is looking at the same object and realize that {{there is an element of}} shared attention. For an instance of social engagement to count as triadic joint attention it requires at least two individuals attending to an object or focusing their attention on each other. Additionally, the individual must display awareness that focus is shared between himself or herself and another individual. Triadic {{attention is}} marked by the individual <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the other individual after looking at the object.|$|E

If two individuals are simply looking at an object, it is referred to as shared gaze.|$|E

5|$|Nicholas Tucker {{described}} the early Harry Potter books as <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Victorian and Edwardian children's stories: Hogwarts was an old-style {{boarding school in}} which the teachers addressed pupils formally by their surnames and were most concerned with the reputations of the houses {{with which they were}} associated; characters' personalities were plainly shown by their appearances, starting with the Dursleys; evil or malicious characters were to be crushed rather than reformed, including Filch's cat Mrs Norris; and the hero, a mistreated orphan who found his true place in life, was charismatic and good at sports, but considerate and protective towards the weak. Several other commentators have stated that the books present a highly stratified society including many social stereotypes. However Karin Westerman drew parallels with 1990s Britain: a class system that was breaking down but defended by those whose power and status it upheld; the multi-ethnic composition of Hogwarts' students; the racial tensions between the various intelligent species; and school bullying.|$|E

500|$|The {{majority}} of Roa Bastos' work {{was written in}} exile owing to the oppressive political condition of his country, {{at a time when}} Paraguay was one of the least culturally, economically, and politically developed countries in Latin America. Thus, much of Roa Bastos' important writing is an attempt to [...] "capture the tragic essence, the 'inner weakness' as well as the inner strength of his country's people." [...] His work reveals an intense preoccupation not only with contemporary Paraguay but with its history, <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the beginning of the 19th century and the rule of Dr. Gaspar de Francia (whose life is the focus of Yo, el Supremo). While key historical figures and events interest Roa Bastos, it is the impact of these [...] "socio-historical roots" [...] on [...] "the nature of the masses" [...] that forms the central theme of his literary work.|$|E
500|$|When screenwriter Rajat Aroraa {{initially}} started working, taking {{cues from}} producer Kapoor, {{the scope of}} the film was much smaller, primarily <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the soft-pornography scene of the 1980s. As work progressed, the scope gradually widened to include the controversial romances of Smitha through a fictionalised biopic. While researching for the film, director Luthria and screenwriter Aroraa found little material in magazines of that period, as [...] "women like Silk Smitha were often ignored by film magazines, except for gossip column mentions". Thus they derived many of the details of her life from anecdotes and party gossips, and then fictionalised them. Apart from depicting the pomp of the Telugu/Tamil film industry, the screenplay takes up issues such as money management by actors, [...] "their string of broken relationships", and the way they [...] "led lonely lives and met with tragic ends". For inspiration, instead of looking at South Indian films of the period, the team turned to the work of mainstream Bollywood directors like Manmohan Desai, Vijay Anand, Raj Kapoor, Feroz Khan and G.P. Sippy. To put the global soft-porn industry in context, the team looked into Boogie Nights (1997) and The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996). The final script became a [...] "fictionalised, women-oriented, generalised perspective on the 1980s film industry".|$|E

2500|$|By <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Book XV of Ovid's Metamorphoses, Shakespeare {{also gives}} a modern view (one that {{includes}} minutes) {{of an ancient}} view of time, one that provides a contrast to the more mechanized time of the 1590s. Time, in Ovid's work {{and in the first}} three quatrains of Sonnet 60, is intertwined with the processes of nature, <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> a time before time and nature were fractured. [...] Just as the poem struggles with time, so Shakespeare's modernized use of Ovid struggles to reconcile the past view of time and the present view of time, the world as it was, and the world as it is.|$|E

[...] His policies and most trusted advisers were Legalist, favoring adherents of Shang Yang. However, despite establishing an autocratic and centralized state, Emperor Wu adopted the principles of Confucianism as the state philosophy and code of ethics for his empire and started a school to teach future administrators the Confucian classics. These reforms had an enduring effect throughout the existence of imperial China and an enormous influence on neighboring civilizations. Emperor Wu was also known for his employment of shaman advisers, and for various religious and cultural changes with historical significance of a less directly obvious nature.|$|E

[...] Smuts set great store by the ties of blood and kinship between the Afrikaners; the Transvaal, in common with most of South Africa, had been originally peopled by men from the Cape. [...] Surely the interests of all Afrikaners throughout the region must be essentially the same? [...] Smuts identified two main factors hindering union; the reluctance of the British population to put down roots, to regard South Africa as home rather than <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Britain, and the Afrikaner desire to keep itself apart, relying on its superior numbers to impose its will upon the rest. [...] So far as Smuts could see these two obstacles had been overcome in the Cape, why not in the Transvaal? ...|$|E

She has almost immediately been elected for all the recent flapper parts". In November 1933, <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> this period of her career, Bow described the atmosphere in Hollywood as like a scene from a movie about the French Revolution, where [...] "women are hollering and waving pitchforks twice as violently as any of the guys... the only ladies in sight are the ones getting their heads cut off." ...|$|E

In the same article, reporter Luke Langlands also noted the show's influence of inspiring the creation of other independent online shows. The Nerd's success as an independent celebrity outside of the commercial mainstream of pop culture, popularized the notion of making lifelong careers online. In a survey published by Mediscape, a number of people admitted to being inspired by the Nerd to create and submit their own content in various online spaces, including YouTube, DeviantArt, SourceForge, GameFAQs and ScrewAttack.

2500|$|Music {{performers}} with {{no strong}} links to maritime music have interpreted traditional shanty and sea song compositions, of which widely scattered instances abound. For example, the bawdy sea song [...] "Frigging in the Rigging" [...] was {{recorded by the}} punk band Sex Pistols. Perhaps {{under the influence of}} Irish Folk Revival groups like The Clancy Brothers and The Dubliners, who included some shanties in their repertoires, some association has also been formed between shanties and Irish music. And so, <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> these performers, later Irish-oriented rock groups like The Pogues interpreted traditional shanties and sea songs like [...] "South Australia" [...] and [...] "The Greenland Whale Fisheries." [...] A notable instance where many non-maritime music performers tackled the traditional maritime repertoire stems from the actor Johnny Depp's reported interest in shanties that developed while filming Pirates of the Caribbean. As a result, in 2006 Depp helped facilitate [...] A medley of sea songs performed by concert orchestra, Sir Henry Wood's Fantasia on British Sea Songs, is a popular component of the Last Night of the Proms in Britain.|$|E
