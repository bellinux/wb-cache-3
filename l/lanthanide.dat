5|$|A {{lutetium}} atom has 71 electrons, {{arranged in}} the configuration 4f145d16s2. When entering a chemical reaction, the atom loses its two outermost electrons {{and the single}} 5d-electron. The lutetium atom is the smallest among the <b>lanthanide</b> atoms, due to the <b>lanthanide</b> contraction, {{and as a result}} lutetium has the highest density, melting point, and hardness of the lanthanides.|$|E
5|$|It often also {{falls in}} the same range for {{reaction}} order, resembling terbium and dysprosium in its chemical reactivity. Yttrium is so close in size to the so-called 'yttrium group' of heavy <b>lanthanide</b> ions that in solution, it behaves {{as if it were}} one of them. Even though the lanthanides are one row farther down the periodic table than yttrium, the similarity in atomic radius may be attributed to the <b>lanthanide</b> contraction.|$|E
5|$|The {{electrons}} in the 4f-subshell, which is progressively filled from cerium (element 58) to ytterbium (element 70), {{are not particularly}} effective at shielding the increasing nuclear charge from the sub-shells further out. The elements immediately following the lanthanides have atomic radii that are smaller than would be expected and that are almost identical to the atomic radii of the elements immediately above them. Hence hafnium has virtually the same atomic radius (and chemistry) as zirconium, and tantalum has an atomic radius similar to niobium, and so forth. This {{is known as the}} <b>lanthanide</b> contraction. The effect of the <b>lanthanide</b> contraction is noticeable up to platinum (element 78), after which it is masked by a relativistic effect known as the inert pair effect. The d-block contraction, which is a similar effect between the d-block and p-block, is less pronounced than the <b>lanthanide</b> contraction but arises from a similar cause.|$|E
25|$|The {{ionisation}} energies for the <b>lanthanides</b> can {{be compared}} with aluminium. In aluminium {{the sum of the}} first three ionisation energies is 5139 kJ·mol−1, whereas the <b>lanthanides</b> fall in the range 3455 – 4186 kJ·mol−1. This correlates with the highly reactive nature of the <b>lanthanides.</b>|$|R
5|$|It is {{relatively}} {{difficult to separate}} ytterbium from other <b>lanthanides</b> due to its similar properties. As a result, the process is somewhat long. First, minerals such as monazite or xenotime are dissolved into various acids, such as sulfuric acid. Ytterbium can then be separated from other <b>lanthanides</b> by ion exchange, as can other <b>lanthanides.</b> The solution is then applied to a resin, which different <b>lanthanides</b> bind in different matters. This is then dissolved using complexing agents, and due to {{the different types of}} bonding exhibited by the different <b>lanthanides,</b> it is possible to isolate the compounds.|$|R
5|$|One {{of the few}} notable {{differences}} between the chemistry of yttrium {{and that of the}} <b>lanthanides</b> is that yttrium is almost exclusively trivalent, whereas about half the <b>lanthanides</b> can have valences other than three; nevertheless, only for four of the fifteen <b>lanthanides</b> are these other valences important in aqueous solution (CeIV, SmII, EuII, and YbII).|$|R
5|$|The two layout forms {{originate}} from two graphic forms of {{presentation of the}} same periodic table. Historically, when the f-block was identified it was drawn below the existing table, with markings for its in-table location (this page uses dots or asterisks). Also, a common presentation is to put all 15 <b>lanthanide</b> and actinide columns below, while the f-block only has 14 columns. The fifteenth (rightmost) <b>lanthanide</b> and actinide are d-block elements, belonging to group 3, with scandium and yttrium.|$|E
5|$|Americium is a {{synthetic}} chemical element with symbol Am and atomic number 95. It is a transuranic {{member of the}} actinide series, in the periodic table located under the <b>lanthanide</b> element europium, and thus by analogy was named after the Americas.|$|E
5|$|Bombarding curium-242 with α-particles {{resulted}} in an isotope of californium 245Cf (1950), and a similar procedure yielded in 1949 berkelium-243 from americium-241. The new elements were named after Berkeley, California, by analogy with its <b>lanthanide</b> homologue terbium, which was named after the village of Ytterby in Sweden.|$|E
40|$|AbstractNADH and succinate oxidase {{activities}} of inside-out submitochondrial particles treated with excess oligomycin are inhibited by <b>lanthanides</b> (La 3 + and Dy 3 +). Both inhibition by oligomycin and oligomycin plus <b>lanthanides</b> are completely relieved by an uncoupler. The respiratory control measured as the stimulation of NADH or succinate oxidation {{caused by the}} addition of uncoupler to the oligomycin-treated particles is thus increased in the presence of <b>lanthanides.</b> The coupling effect of <b>lanthanides</b> is completely prevented and rapidly reversed by excess EDTA. La 3 + increases the extent of the aerobic energy-linked succinate-supported NAD+ reduction catalyzed by the oligomycin-treated submitochondrial particles. <b>Lanthanides</b> seem to be useful tools to increase the energy coupling capacity of the submitochondrial particles...|$|R
500|$|As the <b>lanthanides</b> are so similar, {{praseodymium}} {{can substitute}} for most other <b>lanthanides</b> without significant loss of function, and indeed many {{applications such as}} mischmetal and ferrocerium alloys involve variable mixes of several <b>lanthanides,</b> including small quantities of praseodymium.

40|$|Fundamental solvent {{extraction}} {{studies on the}} separation of the <b>lanthanides</b> were carried out by investigating both the hydroxamic acid and phosphinic acid reagent families. In general, the <b>lanthanides</b> were found to extract as self-adducts. It was found that {{the separation of the}} individual <b>lanthanides</b> with both of these reagent families was adversely affected by steric hindrance...|$|R
5|$|The {{bulk modulus}} of a {{material}} {{is a measure}} of its resistance to uniform pressure. Californium's bulk modulus is 50± 5GPa, which is similar to trivalent <b>lanthanide</b> metals but smaller than more familiar metals, such as aluminium (70GPa).|$|E
5|$|A lead atom has 82 electrons, {{arranged}} in an electron configuration of 4f145d106s26p2. The combined {{first and second}} ionization energies—the total energy required to remove the two 6p electrons—is close to that of tin, lead's upper neighbor in the carbon group. This is unusual; ionization energies generally fall going down a group, as an element's outer electrons become more distant from the nucleus, and more shielded by smaller orbitals. The similarity of ionization energies {{is caused by the}} <b>lanthanide</b> contraction—the decrease in element radii from lanthanum (atomic number 57) to lutetium (71), and the relatively small radii of the elements after hafnium (72). This is due to poor shielding of the nucleus by the <b>lanthanide</b> 4f electrons. The combined first four ionization energies of lead exceed those of tin, contrary to what periodic trends would predict. Relativistic effects, which become significant in heavier atoms, contribute to this behavior. One such effect is the inert pair effect: the 6s electrons of lead become reluctant to participate in bonding, making the distance between nearest atoms in crystalline lead unusually long.|$|E
5|$|After production, the fermium must be {{separated}} from other actinides and from <b>lanthanide</b> fission products. This is usually achieved by ion-exchange chromatography, with the standard process using a cation exchanger such as Dowex50 or TEVA eluted with a solution of ammonium α-hydroxyisobutyrate. Smaller cations form more stable complexes with the α-hydroxyisobutyrate anion, and so are preferentially eluted from the column. A rapid fractional crystallization method has also been described.|$|E

25|$|Due {{to their}} sparse {{distribution}} in the earth's crust and low aqueous solubility, the <b>lanthanides</b> have a low availability in the biosphere, {{and for a long}} time were not known to naturally form part of any biological molecules. In 2007 a novel methanol dehydrogenase that strictly uses <b>lanthanides</b> as enzymatic cofactors was discovered in a bacteria from the phylum Verrucomicrobia, Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum was found to survive only if there is presence of <b>lanthanides</b> in the environment. Compared to most other nondietary elements, non-radioactive <b>lanthanides</b> are classified as having low toxicity.|$|R
40|$|Ionophore A 23187 induced {{histamine}} {{release from}} peritoneal rat mast {{cells in the}} presence of lanthanum or terbium as it did {{in the presence of}} calcium. Low concentrations of <b>lanthanides</b> (10 (- 5) to 2 X 10 (- 4) M) were more efficient than similar concentrations of calcium. The effect of low concentrations of calcium and <b>lanthanides</b> were additive. Increasing the concentration of <b>lanthanides</b> above 10 (- 3) M decreased histamine release. This decrease was partly reversed by calcium. Calmodulin inhibitors, phenothiazines, R 24571 and mepacrine, inhibited the histamine release induced by either calcium or <b>lanthanides.</b> Zn 2 +, a calmodulin inhibitor transported by A 23187, inhibited more potently the calcium-dependent histamine release. <b>Lanthanides</b> decrease histamine release induced by 48 / 80 in the absence of added calcium. These data show that ionophore A 23187 can transport <b>lanthanides</b> across the plasma membrane of mast cells, allowing the trivalent cations to substitute for calcium in the activation of calmodulin or calmoduline-like proteins...|$|R
5|$|Cerium is {{the second}} element of the <b>lanthanide</b> series. In the {{periodic}} table, it appears between the lanthanides lanthanum to its left and praseodymium to its right, and above the actinide thorium. It is a ductile metal with a hardness {{similar to that of}} silver. Its 58 electrons are arranged in the configuration 4f15d16s2, of which the four outer electrons are valence electrons. Immediately after lanthanum, the 4f orbitals suddenly contract and are lowered in energy {{to the point that they}} participate readily in chemical reactions; however, this effect is not yet strong enough at cerium and thus the 5d subshell is still occupied. Most lanthanides can use only three electrons as valence electrons, as afterwards the remaining 4f electrons are too strongly bound: cerium is an exception because of the stability of the empty f-shell in Ce4+ and the fact that it comes very early in the <b>lanthanide</b> series, where the nuclear charge is still low enough until neodymium to allow the removal of the fourth valence electron.|$|E
5|$|Elements {{that show}} tripositive ions with {{electronic}} configuration of a noble gas (scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, actinium) show a clear trend in their physical properties, such as hardness. At the same time, if group 3 is continued with lutetium and lawrencium, several trends are broken. For example, scandium and yttrium are both soft metals. Lanthanum is soft as well; all these elements have their outermost electrons quite {{far from the}} nucleus compared to the nuclei charges. Due to the <b>lanthanide</b> contraction, lutetium, the last in the <b>lanthanide</b> series, has a significantly smaller atomic radius and a higher nucleus charge, thus making the extraction of the electrons from the atom to form metallic bonding more difficult, and thus making the metal harder. However, lutetium suits the previous elements better in several other properties, such as melting and boiling points. Very {{little is known about}} lawrencium, and none of its physical properties have been confirmed.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, mendelevium is located {{to the right}} of the actinide fermium, to the left of the actinide nobelium, and below the <b>lanthanide</b> thulium. Mendelevium metal has not yet been prepared in bulk quantities, and bulk preparation is currently impossible. Nevertheless, a number of predictions and some preliminary experimental results have been done regarding its properties.|$|E
5|$|Among the <b>lanthanides,</b> {{lanthanum}} is exceptional as it {{does not}} have any 4f electrons; indeed, the sudden contraction and lowering of energy of the 4f orbital that is important for the chemistry of the <b>lanthanides</b> only begins to happen at cerium. Thus it is only very weakly paramagnetic, unlike the strongly paramagnetic later <b>lanthanides</b> (with the exceptions of the last two, ytterbium and lutetium, where the 4f shell is completely full). Furthermore, since the melting points of the trivalent <b>lanthanides</b> are related to the extent of hybridisation of the 6s, 5d, and 4f electrons, lanthanum has the second-lowest (after cerium) melting point among all the lanthanides: 920°C. The <b>lanthanides</b> become harder as the series is traversed: as expected, lanthanum is a soft metal. Lanthanum has a relatively high resistivity of 615nΩm at room temperature; in comparison, the value for the good conductor aluminium is only 26.50nΩm. Lanthanum is the least volatile of the <b>lanthanides.</b> Like most of the <b>lanthanides,</b> lanthanum has a hexagonal crystal structure at room temperature. At 310°C, lanthanum changes to a face-centered cubic structure, and at 865°C, it changes to a body-centered cubic structure.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe EXAm process aims at {{recovering}} americium alone. The {{principle of}} the EXAm process {{is based on the}} extraction of americium together with some light <b>lanthanides</b> having close values of distribution coefficients in high nitric acidity, while curium and other <b>lanthanides</b> remain in the aqueous phase. The TEDGA amide molecule is added in the aqueous phase to increase Am/Cm and Am/heavy Ln selectivity, because of the preferential complexation of curium and heavy <b>lanthanides</b> by this diglycolamide. The Am is subsequently selectively stripped from the light <b>lanthanides.</b> The full approach aiming at validating this complex process is illustrated in this paper...|$|R
5|$|Lanthanum is {{the first}} element and {{prototype}} of the <b>lanthanide</b> series. In the periodic table, it appears {{to the right of}} the alkaline earth metal barium and to the left of the <b>lanthanide</b> cerium. Lanthanum is often considered to be a group 3 element, along with its lighter congeners scandium and yttrium and its heavier congener, the radioactive actinium, although this classification is sometimes disputed. Similarly to scandium, yttrium, and actinium, the 57 electrons of a lanthanum atom are arranged in the configuration 5d16s2, with three valence electrons outside the noble gas core. In chemical reactions, lanthanum almost always gives up these three valence electrons from the 5d and 6s subshells to form the +3 oxidation state, achieving the stable configuration of the preceding noble gas xenon. Some lanthanum(II) compounds are also known, but they are much less stable.|$|E
5|$|Lutetium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Lu and atomic number 71. It is a silvery white metal, which resists corrosion in dry air, {{but not in}} moist air. Lutetium is the last element in the <b>lanthanide</b> series, and it is traditionally counted among the rare earths. Lutetium is sometimes considered the first element of the 6th-period transition metals, although lanthanum is more often considered as such.|$|E
5|$|Praseodymium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Pr and atomic number 59. It {{is the third}} member of the <b>lanthanide</b> series and is traditionally considered {{to be one of}} the rare-earth metals. Praseodymium is a soft, silvery, malleable and ductile metal, valued for its magnetic, electrical, chemical, and optical properties.

40|$|<b>Lanthanides</b> are biologically non-essential {{elements}} {{with wide}} applications {{in technology and}} industry. Their concentration as environmental contaminants is, therefore, increasing. Although non-essential, <b>lanthanides</b> have been proposed (and even used) to produce beneficial effects in plants, even though their mechanisms of action are unclear. Recently, {{it was suggested that}} they may replace essential elements. We tested the effect of low concentrations of <b>lanthanides</b> on the common freshwater microalga Desmodesmus quadricauda, grown under conditions of metal ion-deficiency (lower calcium or manganese concentrations). Our goal was to test if <b>lanthanides</b> can replace essential metals in their functions. Physiological stress was recorded by studying growth and photosynthetic activity using a pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) fluorimeter. We found that nutrient stress reduced parameters of growth and chlorophyll fluorescence, such as maximal quantum yield, relative electron transport rate, photon capturing efficiency and light saturation irradiance. After adding low concentrations of five <b>lanthanides,</b> we confirmed that they can produce a stimulatory effect on microalgae, depending on the nutrient (metal) deprivation. In the case of a calcium deficit, the addition of <b>lanthanides</b> partly alleviated the effects, probably by a partial substitution of the element. In contrast, with manganese deprivation (and at even lower concentrations), <b>lanthanides</b> enhanced the toxic effect and severely inhibited growth. These results show that <b>lanthanides</b> can replace essential elements, but their effects on microalgae depend on stress and the physiological state of the microalgae, raising the possibility of environmental impacts at even low concentrations...|$|R
5|$|The first {{element of}} the actinides, {{actinium}} gave the group its name, much as lanthanum had done for the <b>lanthanides.</b> The group of elements is more diverse than the <b>lanthanides</b> and therefore {{it was not until}} 1928 that Charles Janet proposed the most significant change to Dmitri Mendeleev's periodic table since the recognition of the <b>lanthanides,</b> by introducing the actinides, a move suggested again in 1945 by Glenn T.

5|$|Some common uses {{of heavy}} metals {{depend on the}} general {{characteristics}} of metals such as electrical conductivity and reflectivity or the general characteristics of heavy metals such as density, strength, and durability. Other uses depend {{on the characteristics of}} the specific element, such as their biological role as nutrients or poisons or some other specific atomic properties. Examples of such atomic properties include: partly filled d- or f- orbitals (in many of the transition, <b>lanthanide,</b> and actinide heavy metals) that enable the formation of coloured compounds; the capacity of most heavy metal ions (such as platinum, cerium or bismuth) to exist in different oxidation states and therefore act as catalysts; poorly overlapping 3d or 4f orbitals (in iron, cobalt, and nickel, or the <b>lanthanide</b> heavy metals from europium through thulium) that give rise to magnetic effects; and high atomic numbers and electron densities that underpin their nuclear science applications. Typical uses of heavy metals can be broadly grouped into the following six categories.|$|E
5|$|Some tables, {{including}} the one published by IUPAC refer to all lanthanides and actinides as being in group 3: 30 <b>lanthanide</b> and actinide elements together with scandium and yttrium.
