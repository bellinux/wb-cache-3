50|$|Hansen twice visited England and {{was twice}} (in 1842 and 1860) the {{recipient}} of the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society. He communicated to that society in 1847 an able paper on a long-period <b>lunar</b> <b>inequality</b> (Memoirs Roy. Astr. Society, xvi. 465), and in 1854 one on the moon's figure, advocating the mistaken hypothesis of its deformation by a huge elevation directed towards the earth (ib. xxiv. 29). He was awarded the Copley Medal by the Royal Society in 1850, and his Solar Tables, compiled with the assistance of Christian Olufsen, appeared in 1854. Hansen gave in 1854 the first intimation that the accepted distance of the sun was too great by some millions of miles (Month. Notices Roy. Astr. Soc. xv. 9), the error of J.F. Encke's result having been rendered evident through his investigation of a <b>lunar</b> <b>inequality.</b> In 1865, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.|$|E
50|$|To the Babylonian {{astronomer}} Kidinnu (in Greek or Latin, Kidenas or Cidenas) {{has been}} attributed the invention (5th or 4th century BC) {{of what is}} now called “System B” for predicting the position of the moon, taking account that the moon continually changes its speed along its path relative to the background of fixed stars. This system involved calculating daily stepwise changes of lunar speed, up or down, with a minimum and a maximum approximately each month. The basis of these systems appears to have been arithmetical rather than geometrical, but they did approximately account for the main <b>lunar</b> <b>inequality</b> now known as the equation of the center.|$|E
50|$|For a {{selected}} {{few of the}} <b>lunar</b> <b>inequalities,</b> Newton showed in some quantitative detail how they arise from the solar perturbing force.|$|R
5000|$|The Variation is {{the second-largest}} solar {{perturbation}} of the Moon's orbit after the Evection, and the third-largest inequality in {{the motion of}} the Moon altogether; (the first and largest of the <b>lunar</b> <b>inequalities</b> is the equation of the centre, a result of the eccentricity [...] - [...] which is not an effect of solar perturbation).|$|R
50|$|Tycho's {{distinctive}} {{contributions to}} lunar theory include his {{discovery of the}} variation of the Moon's longitude. This represents the largest inequality of longitude after the equation of {{the center and the}} evection. He also discovered librations in the inclination of the plane of the lunar orbit, relative to the ecliptic (which is not a constant of about 5° as had been believed before him, but fluctuates through a range of over a quarter of a degree), and accompanying oscillations in the longitude of the lunar node. These represent perturbations in the Moon's ecliptic latitude. Tycho's lunar theory doubled the number of distinct <b>lunar</b> <b>inequalities,</b> relative to those anciently known, and reduced the discrepancies of lunar theory to about 1/5 of their previous amounts. It was published posthumously by Kepler in 1602, and Kepler's own derivative form appears in Kepler's Rudolphine Tables of 1627.|$|R
