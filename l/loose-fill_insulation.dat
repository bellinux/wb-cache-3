5000|$|Wet-spray {{cellulose}} insulation {{is similar}} to <b>loose-fill</b> <b>insulation,</b> but is applied with a small quantity of water to help the cellulose bind {{to the inside of}} open wall cavities, and to make the cellulose more resistant to settling. Spray application provides even better protection against air infiltration and improves wall rigidity. It also allows application on sloped walls, attics, and similar spaces. Wet-spray is best for new construction, as the wall must be allowed to dry completely before sealing with drywall (a moisture meter is recommended). Moist-spray (also called stabilized) cellulose uses less water to speed up drying time.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Settling of attic loose-fill thermal {{insulation}} {{is a long-term}} process. Settling depends {{on the quality of}} the <b>loose-fill</b> <b>insulation</b> and the attic conditions during the service life. The main factors affecting settling of attic <b>loose-fill</b> <b>insulation</b> are density (mass), climate of the attic, and vibrations of the building structure. Analytical models for settling of attic loose-fill {{thermal insulation}} can be helpful for both interpretation and prediction of observed settling behaviour. The prediction of the settling process of loose-fill thermal insulation in a model is valuable when estimating the thermal properties of the <b>loose-fill</b> <b>insulation</b> after a certain lifetime. Efforts to carry out a preliminary analytical model for the settling property have been made in two ways. Firstly, experimental field settling data have been used to fit a common logarithmic mathematical function. Secondly, a four-element linear vis-coelastic model, the Burger model, has been adjusted to experimental field settling data. Comparison of the thirty years settling data calculated with the fitted logarithmic functions and the Burger equations has been performed for cellulose fibre and mineral fibre insulation (Svennerstedt, 1993).

40|$|Vermiculite is {{a mineral}} that expands when rapidly heated. Expanded {{vermiculite}} {{is used in}} construction and consumer materials (e. g., <b>loose-fill</b> <b>insulation,</b> acoustic finishes, spray-on insulation, and concrete mixes for swimming pools), agricultural and horticultural products (e. g., potting mixes and soil conditioners) and in industrial products (e. g., brake shoes and pads, drilling muds, furnaces, and insulation blocks). Expanded vermiculite granules are shaped like small accordions, and vary in color from silver/gold to gray/brown. Vermiculite has been an established commercial commodity for well over 50 years, and is currently used throughout the world. Vermiculite ore mined near Libby, Montana, which {{accounted for more than}} half the worldwide production of vermiculite from 1925 to 1990, was contaminated with asbestos and asbestos-like fibers. Workplace exposure to these fibers caused a serious health problem in local miners and millers, as well as some downstream workers. Mining stopped at the mine near Libby in 1990. However, concerns remain about health effects from environmental and other occupational exposures to asbestos-contaminated vermiculite, especially vermiculite that has been installed as <b>loose-fill</b> <b>insulation</b> in homes and other buildings. Much of the vermiculite from the mine near Libby was used in the manufacture of Zonolite Attic Insulation. However, not all Zonolite product was made with vermiculite from that same mine.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{potential}} of naturally occurring biodegradable fibers for use as building thermal insulation. The use of biodegradable building thermal insulation would alleviate the environmental problems presently associated with the disposal of currently used man-made non-biodegradable thermal insulations. The apparent thermal conductivity(lambda) for biodegradable coconut and sugarcane fiber were investigated in accordance with ASTM C 518 over the density ranges 40 kg/m³ to 90 kg/m³ and 70 kg/m³ to 120 kg/m³ for the test temperature ranges 13. 2 ºC to 21. 8 ºC and 18 ºC to 32 ºC, respectively. The experimental data {{were used to determine}} empirical equations for lambda variation with density and temperature for both coconut and sugarcane fiber. Comparison of l at 24 ºC for coconut and sugarcane fiber were made with seven different conventional insulation from published data. The results indicated that the minimum lambda for both coconut and sugarcane fiber are within the range normally associated with building thermal insulation.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the influence of convection on the thermal performance of loose-fill attic insulation under realistic climate conditions. In order to achieve this, a large-scale attic test model has been constructed in a climate chamber. Heat flows through the attic floor have been determined with a metering box and temperatures on the upper and lower surface of the attic floor have been measured to detect air movements and to determine the thermal resistance of the attic floor. The performance of the attic test model has been assured by gradually increasing the complexity of the studied attic floor. Measurements have been made both with and without joists, with and without attic ventilation and on rockwool boards, rockwool <b>loose-fill</b> <b>insulation</b> and low-density, glasswool <b>loose-fill</b> <b>insulation.</b> The upper surface of the attic floor has been subjected to conditions representing Swedish winter and the lower surface to indoor conditions. When natural convection occurs, it leads to an increase in heat loss through the insulation and, thus, to a decrease in the thermal resistance of the insulation. A number of factors influence natural convection, such as temperature difference over the attic floor, the thickness of the insulation and permeability of the insulation material. Measurements of natural convection showed that the critical modified Rayleigh number for attic insulation, in the studied set-up, was approximately 22. At a modified Rayleigh number of 34, the thermal resistance of the insulation in the attic test model was only 75 % of that obtained at the onset of convection. This means that there was a substantial increase in heat loss through the insulation due to convection. The measurements of natural convection have been compared to simulations and similar tendencies were obtained. There was no indication of a decrease in the total thermal resistance of the whole attic floor due to attic ventilation...|$|E
40|$|Ductwork {{installed}} in unconditioned attics can significantly increase the overall {{heating and cooling}} costs of residential buildings. In fact, estimated duct thermal losses for single-family residential buildings with ductwork {{installed in}} unconditioned attics range from 10 % to 45 %. In a study of three single-story houses in Florida, the Building America research team Consortium for Advanced Residential Buildings (CARB) investigated the strategy of using buried and/or encapsulated ducts (BED) to reduce duct thermal losses in existing homes. The BED strategy consists of burying ducts in <b>loose-fill</b> <b>insulation</b> and/or encapsulating them in closed cell polyurethane spray foam (ccSPF) insulation. There are three possible combinations of BED strategies: (1) buried ducts; (2) encapsulated ducts (with ccSPF); and (3) buried and encapsulated ducts. The best solution for each situation depends on the climate, age of the house, and {{the configuration of the}} HVAC system and attic. For new construction projects, the team recommends that ducts be both encapsulated and buried as the minimal planning and costs required for this will yield optimal energy savings. The encapsulated/buried duct strategy, which utilizes ccSPF to address condensation concerns, is an approach that was developed specifically for humid climates...|$|E
40|$|Buried and/or {{encapsulated}} ducts (BEDs) are a {{class of}} advanced, energy-efficiency strategies intended to address the significant ductwork thermal losses associated with ducts installed in unconditioned attics. BEDs are ducts installed in unconditioned attics that are covered in <b>loose-fill</b> <b>insulation</b> and/or encapsulated in closed cell polyurethane spray foam insulation. This Measure Guideline covers {{the technical aspects of}} BEDs as well as the advantages, disadvantages, and risks of BEDs compared to other alternative strategies. This guideline also provides detailed guidance on installation of BEDs strategies in new and existing homes through step-by-step installation procedures. This Building America Measure Guideline synthesizes previously published research on BEDs and provides practical information to builders, contractors, homeowners, policy analysts, building professions, and building scientists. Some of the procedures presented here, however, require specialized equipment or expertise. In addition, some alterations to duct systems may require a specialized license. Persons implementing duct system improvements should not go beyond their expertise or qualifications. This guideline provides valuable information for a building industry that has struggled to address ductwork thermal losses in new and existing homes. As building codes strengthen requirements for duct air sealing and insulation, flexibility is needed to address energy efficiency goals. While ductwork in conditioned spaces has been promoted as the panacea for addressing ductwork thermal losses, BEDs installations approach - and sometimes exceed - the performance of ductwork in conditioned spaces...|$|E
30|$|The {{survey results}} show the {{potential}} of the proposed 3 D visualization method for assessing the as-is building conditions as an intuitive communication tool. Since the main purpose of the proposed method is to provide guidance for making efficient and effective energy retrofit decisions by diagnosing and visualizing the as-is building conditions, the proposed method only needs to be conducted once per regular building diagnostic process (e.g., annual building inspection) and {{does not need to be}} performed more frequently. Hence, it does not add significant burden to the building practitioners, and allows the proposed method to be repeatable in parallel with thermographic inspection. The proposed method can inspect very small surfaces with potential performance problems (in fact, at the vertex-level of a mesh). This level of granularity, for example, would be helpful when installing blown-in <b>loose-fill</b> <b>insulation</b> is considered as one of the retrofit alternatives to improve the thermal resistance of the defected areas. However, if the detected areas are too small, retrofitting such problems is not likely to be practically feasible due to technical challenges and long payback period. Thus, practical retrofit decisions need to be taken up to a certain minimum size of retroffitable surface. The proposed method chooses not to dictate the minimum size of the retrofittable building area. Rather, by presenting the measurements at the point-level, the proposed method lets the building practitioners set their desired value prior to assessing different energy efficiency retrofit alternatives.|$|E
