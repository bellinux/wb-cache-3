50|$|<b>Lead</b> <b>azide</b> in its pure {{form was}} first {{prepared}} by Theodor Curtius in 1891. Due to sensitivity and stability concerns, the dextrinated form of <b>lead</b> <b>azide</b> (MIL-L-3055) {{was developed in}} the 1920s and 1930s with large scale production by DuPont Co beginning in 1932.

RD-1333 <b>lead</b> <b>azide</b> (MIL-DTL-46225), a version of <b>lead</b> <b>azide</b> with sodium carboxymethylcellulose as a precipitating agent, was developed to meet that need. The Vietnam War saw an accelerated need for <b>lead</b> <b>azide</b> and it was during this time that Special Purpose <b>Lead</b> <b>Azide</b> (MIL-L-14758) was developed; the US government also began stockpiling <b>lead</b> <b>azide</b> in large quantities.

40|$|The {{behavior}} {{of silver and}} <b>lead</b> <b>azides</b> (scaly and threadlike crystals, and compacted powders) in initiation of explosive decomposition by laser pulsed radiation has been investigated. Initiation energy thresholds in irradiation at wavelengths of 1064 nm, 532 nm, 354. 7 nm, 266 nm corresponding to four laser radiation harmonics have been measured. Samples both uncovered {{and covered with a}} transparent dielectric (a quartz plate) with the compressive force of up to 0. 5 GPa were initiated. In the transparent spectral region (the first and second laser harmonics) of the heavy metal azide matrix the effect of covering the sample surface with a plate on initiation energy threshold was insignificant, whereas, in the region of bandgap absorption (the fourth harmonic) strong dependence of the initiation threshold on whether the surface under irradiation is uncovered or covered. The results obtained have been considered with the account of the influence of the transparent plate on gas-dynamic unloading of the thermal site, which is formed in the bandgap absorption of laser radiation in a thin near-surface layer.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{long-term}} exposure (5 h) of Phycomyces blakesleeanus mycelium to 5 mM KCN on respiration and phosphate metabolites were tested. Exposure to cyanide, antimycin A and <b>azide</b> <b>lead</b> to {{a decrease in}} the activity of cyanide-sensitive respiration (CSR), and the ratio of core polyphosphates (PPc) and inorganic phosphates (Pi), which is a good indicator of the metabolic state of a cell. After 5 h of incubation, the activity of CSR returned to control values. For this, the recovery of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) was required. In addition, the PPc/Pi ratio started to recover shortly after initiation of COX recovery, but never reached control values. This led us to conclude that the regulation of polyphosphate (PPn) levels in the cell is tightly coupled to respiratory chain functioning. In addition, acutely applied cyanide caused two different responses, observed by 31 P NMR spectroscopy, that were probably mediated through the mechanism of glycolytic oscillations, triggered by the effect of cyanide on mitochondria.

40|$|The {{treatment}} of a suspension of graphite oxide (GO) with sodium <b>azide</b> <b>leads</b> to a material that, after reduction, features amino groups {{at the top and}} bottom of the sheets. These groups react through microcontact printing with an isothiocyanate monolayer on a silicon oxide substrate to form covalent bonds that strongly attach to the particles on the surface. With ultrasonication it is possible to obtain exfoliation of the sheets that are not covalently bound to the surface leaving single-layer platelets attached to the substrate. The azido derivative can be also used to functionalize the graphene oxide with long alkylic chains through a click chemistry approach. This functionalization results in the exfoliation of this material in dimethylformamide. The novel materials were fully characterized by different techniques including IR spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM), X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and solid state NMR spectroscopy. The material with amino groups, after the reduction step, is conductive with a resistivity only approximately seven times larger than that of unprocessed graphite. This implies that after reduction of the GO, the conjugated sp 2 network is largely restored. We consider this to be an important step towards a chemical approach for forming conducting large-area platelet films of single-layer graphene...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development of transannular iodoamination methodology for the synthesis of pyrrolizidine, indolizidine and tropane alkaloids. Chapter 1 introduces the concept of a ‘transannular cyclisation’ and outlines the utility of such cyclisations in the synthesis of a range of [x. y. z]-azabicyclic alkaloids. Chapter 2 describes the development of a three step lithium amide conjugate addition, ring-closing metathesis and transannular iodoamination protocol for the preparation of the pyrrolizidine scaffold ([3. 3. 0]-azabicycle). Cyclisation of a hexahydroazocine occurs with concomitant N-debenzylation to give a single diastereoisomer of the corresponding C(7) -iodopyrrolizidine product, which is then elaborated to the known pyrrolizidine, (−) - 7 a-epi-hyacinthacine A 1. Chapter 3 delineates an extension of the methodology described in Chapter 2, and an investigation into accessing alternate diastereoisomeric pyrrolizidine scaffolds via the transannular iodoamination process. These studies culminate in the synthesis of two pyrrolizidine alkaloids, (−) -hyacinthacine A 1 and (−) -hyacinthacine A 2. Chapter 4 details investigations into the further elaboration of the C(7) -iodopyrrolizidine scaffold synthesised in Chapter 2. A nucleophilic displacement reaction with <b>azide</b> <b>leads</b> to the synthesis of novel 7 -deoxy- 7 -aminoalexine analogues, whilst radical-mediated substitution of the iodide by oxygen allows the synthesis and isolation of the pyrrolizidine alkaloid (−) - 1 -epi-alexine. Chapter 5 outlines the development of the transannular iodoamination reaction to facilitate the synthesis of the tropane architecture ([3. 2. 1]-azabicycle). A tandem lithium amide conjugate addition and aldol reaction sequence is followed by ring-closing metathesis to give the required aminocycloheptene. Subsequent treatment with iodine results in transannular cyclisation to give a single iodotropane product which, following elaboration culminates in the synthesis of (+) -pseudococaine.

40|$|The novel {{alkoxide}} ligand [OCtBu 2 Ph], or [OR], was synthesized in {{a single}} step as a lithium salt. It was then reacted {{with a series of}} first-row transition metal(II) halides, with widely varying results. Upon reaction with chromium, manganese, iron, or cobalt(II) chloride, dimeric complexes of the form M 2 (OR) 4 Li 2 Cl 2 were formed, which displayed rare seesaw geometry at the metal. This unusual geometry was confirmed by various spectroscopic and computational studies. Computational studies also indicate that the steric bulk of the ligand, as well as the inclusion of lithium atoms in the molecules, are what lead to the seesaw geometry. Reaction of [OR] with nickel(II) halides generates monomeric species of the form Ni(OR) 2 XLi(THF) 2 (X = Cl, Br), which display distorted trigonal planar geometry at three-coordinate nickel. Dimerization likely does not occur for nickel due to its smaller size. DFT studies support preference for nickel to form the monomer. Reaction of [OR] with copper(II) halides leads to reduction of the copper center by one electron, generating the tetramer Cu 4 (OR) 4. Reduction of copper(II) by an alkoxide is a novel transformation. Spectroscopic studies to probe the mechanism suggest that Cu(OR) 2 XLi(THF) 2 may be an intermediate prior to reduction. Observation by NMR of the ketone Ph(C=O) tBu and ROH suggest that alkoxide reduces the copper to give an alkoxide radical, which then decomposes via β-scission. To form the desired bis(alkoxide) system, the halide-containing alkoxide complexes were reacted with thallium(I) hexafluorophosphate. For manganese, iron, and copper, complexes of the form M(OR) 2 (THF) 2 were isolated. The bis(alkoxide) complexes display distorted tetrahedral geometry at the metal, with large RO−M−OR angles. Cyclic voltammetry of these species show that the iron bis(alkoxide) is the most easily reduced of the three. Attempts to form the chromium bis(alkoxide) in a similar fashion led to the reduction of thallium(I) to thallium metal. Formation of the nickel bis(alkoxide) complex was also unsuccessful. Reaction of the iron bis(alkoxide) complex with adamantyl azide led to reductive coupling of the azide moieties to give the bridging hexazene complex (RO) 2 Fe(μ-η 2 :η 2 -AdN 6 Ad) Fe(OR) 2. This complex was confirmed to be stable to explosive decomposition. Computational studies suggest a dimerization mechanism, whereby azide initially coordinates to iron(II), and upon dimerization the iron centers reduce the azides before N−N bond formation occurs. Stoichiometric reaction of the iron bis(alkoxide) complex with mesityl <b>azide</b> <b>leads</b> to nitrene formation followed by nitrene coupling to give the azoarene MesNNMes. Crystallization from a stoichiometric reaction afforded the azoarene and the iron tris(alkoxide) Fe(OR) 3. Catalytic azoarene formation with catalyst loading as low as 1 mol% cleanly generates azoarene at room temperature within a day or two for mesityl azide and 2, 6 -diethylphenyl azide. Asymmetric azoarene can also be formed by reacting mesityl azide and 2, 6 -diethylpheynyl azides together with the iron bis(alkoxide). This process is highly selective: azoarene is the only product formed, even if the reaction is performed in the presence of cyclohexadiene or isocyanide. Other azides (i. e. those not possessing groups in positions ortho to the azide on the ring) do not form azoarene upon reaction with the iron bis(alkoxide) : instead they form bis(imido) complexes of the form (RO) Fe(THF) (μ-NAr) 2 Fe(THF) (OR) (Ar = 4 -(trifluoro) methyl, 3, 5 -dimethylphenyl, or phenyl). These are stable molecules that do not react with additional equivalents of aryl azide. A tentative mechanism is proposed, whereby the iron(III) imido radical Fe(OR) 2 (NAr) comproportionates with another equivalent of iron bis(alkoxide) to give the observed iron(III) tris(alkoxide), and the iron(III) bridging imido dimer. Nitrene coupling to give azoarene can occur from either the iron(III) imido radical complex, or from the bis(imido) dimer. For bulkier aryl azides, the bis(imido) dimer is disfavored to form due to sterics. This likely leads to preferential azoarene formation. Reaction of the iron bis(alkoxide) with diphenyldiazomethane generates the azine Ph 2 CNNCPh 2, suggesting that a reactive iron carbene complex is formed before reacting with another equivalent of the diazoalkane. A similar reaction with the cobalt bis(alkoxide) leads to isolation of the stable carbene complex, Co(OR) 2 (CPh 2). This molecule is the first example of an isolated, structurally characterized high-valent cobalt carbene complex. EPR and DFT studies confirm the electronics of the complex: {{it is likely that the}} cobalt oxidation state lies on a continuum between cobalt(III) and cobalt(IV) but that it displays significant alkylidene character. However, the high-valent cobalt carbene complex is surprisingly unreactive. Combination with both styrene and methyl acrylate at elevated temperatures failed to lead to any significant reactivity of the complex. This is likely due to the steric protection offered by both the bulky alkoxide ligands and the bulky carbene...|$|R
