50|$|This {{large amount}} of <b>lost</b> <b>motion</b> added to the {{torsional}} windup of the gear train, when a tooth enters the cut and relaxes when it exits, induces torsional vibration and must {{be reduced to a}} minimum by using anti-backlash mechanisms or by grinding the gear sets to an absolute minimum play.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{area where}} {{backlash}} matters is in leadscrews. Again, {{as with the}} gear train example, the culprit is <b>lost</b> <b>motion</b> when reversing a mechanism {{that is supposed to}} transmit motion accurately. Instead of gear teeth, the context is screw threads. The linear sliding axes (machine slides) of machine tools are an example application.|$|E
50|$|The {{backlash}} of the gears, {{especially the}} spindle gear set, is also critical. The ratio between an 1800 mm (70”) diameter blade and the approximate 250 mm (10”) pitch {{diameter of the}} spindle gear is about 7/1. Thus, a tooth play of 0.025 mm (.001”) results in a 0.18 mm (.007”) <b>lost</b> <b>motion</b> on the tooth of the blade.|$|E

50|$|When Social Credit <b>lost</b> a <b>motion</b> of no {{confidence}} in the legislature in March 1953, Winch argued that the CCF {{should be allowed to}} try to form a government instead of the house being dissolved for an early election. The Liberals, however, refused to support the CCF's bid to form a government and new elections were called.|$|R

5000|$|In {{mechanical}} engineering, backlash, {{sometimes called}} lash or play, is a clearance or <b>lost</b> <b>motion</b> in a mechanism caused by {{gaps between the}} parts. It {{can be defined as}} [...] "the maximum distance or angle through which any part of a mechanical system may be moved in one direction without applying appreciable force or motion to the next part in mechanical sequence",p. 1-8 and is a mechanical form of deadband. An example, in the context of gears and gear trains, is the amount of clearance between mated gear teeth. It can be seen when the direction of movement is reversed and the slack or <b>lost</b> <b>motion</b> is taken up before the reversal of motion is complete. It can be heard from the railway couplings when a train reverses direction. Another example is in a valve train with mechanical tappets, where a certain range of lash is necessary for the valves to work properly.|$|E
50|$|A pivot saw has {{the highest}} degree of stiffness, because the forces are {{arranged}} in a closed loop (fig.1). If {{we assume that the}} base of such a saw is very rigid, the force will flow from the pivot of the gearbox to the ball screw feed system in a closed loop, whereby the cutting force engages in the middle, approximately, between rotation point and ball screw. This arrangement substantially reduces the <b>lost</b> <b>motion</b> and compliance in the feed system. Furthermore, the ball screw drive which forces the blade into the cut is bolted to the fixture frame which again is clamped to the billet and gives this arrangement additional rigidity.|$|E
50|$|The Ganz {{form was}} {{used on the}} Hungarian-built Les Belles Hongroisses 2BB2 400 {{locomotives}} for the French PO. This had four links forming the triangle, with the two upper vertices mounted to the locomotive frame (through a short swinging link) and to the jackshaft crankpin. The lower apex of the triangle contained a short triangular link, which linked {{the sides of the}} triangle to the wheel crankpin. By tilting this link, the suspension movement was absorbed. This linkage ran well at speed and as it was composed entirely of pivoting joints with no sliding, there was no <b>lost</b> <b>motion.</b> It was however complex, heavy and unbalanced.|$|E

50|$|It {{was neither}} the <b>lost</b> no-confidence <b>motion</b> nor the <b>lost</b> {{parliamentary}} elections that, on 8 May 1973, eventually prompted Barzel {{to resign from}} both the CDU party chair and {{the leadership of the}} CDU/CSU parliamentary group. It was the refusal by the parliamentary group to support a government bill for the accession of both German states to the United Nations.|$|R
50|$|Doll was {{temporarily}} withdrawn from {{service at the}} Leighton Buzzard Narrow Gauge Railway in 19??,. at which point she received a new all welded boiler from Bennett Boiler and a full bottom end overhaul at Alan Keef Ltd. The valve gear was fitted with new eccentrics and repined and bushed to remove the <b>lost</b> <b>motion</b> which had developed. It was seen {{that at some point}} in the locomotive's past the wear had been compensated for by sawing part of the lap from the slide valves and filling in notches in the reversing quadrant near mid-gear. After repair the engine returned to LBNGR and was in regular use from 2004 until the boiler tubes gave out prematurely. It is now undergoing another overhaul and it is expected she will back pulling trains in the summer of 2017.|$|E

50|$|The Baker Locomotive Valve Gear was {{produced}} by the Pilliod Co. of Swanton, Ohio. Subsequent versions were produced {{up to the end}} of steam service. It was particularly popular on the Norfolk and Western Railway, and almost all later N&W engines used it (notably NW 611). Other extensive users included the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad and the Nickel Plate Road. The New York Central Railroad and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad also had large classes which used Baker gear. There was always debate about the advantages of Baker gear, the main criticism being the number of pin joints and possible <b>lost</b> <b>motion.</b> Western United States and British railroads tended to continue with the Walschaerts pattern, as did the Pennsylvania Railroad. In Britain Baker gear was popular amongst model engineers but in full-size practice the length of the yoke and the width of the assembly may have been difficult to accommodate within the restricted loading gauge.|$|E
