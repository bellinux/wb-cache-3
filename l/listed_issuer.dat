S., the Chinese securities regulation applies a bifurcated mandatory-voluntary earnings projection regime. The forecasting issuers are neither protected by any safe harbor nor exposed to any private litigation risk; the forecasts are regulated through public enforcement on an ex post accuracy basis. This Article contributes to extant literature on issuer forward-looking information regulation, by applying U. S. disclosure theories and examining empirical data of the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange <b>listed</b> <b>issuers</b> during the 2013 - 2014 period. It argues that regulation of issuer forecasts solely by means of confidential Fidelity regulation and deprivation of market opportunities for ex post inaccurate forecasts is both ineffective (due to issuer strategic projection behavior) and inefficient (due to inaccurate enforcement induced resource misallocation). It recommends an open legal framework to support an informed market. Key Words Earnings forecast; mandatory disclosure; voluntary disclosure; ex ante; ex post; China; U. S...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{awareness}} on {{the risk}} management and internal control disclosure among the Malaysian public listed firms had increased since {{the global financial}} crisis in 2007 to 2009. In Malaysia, public listed firms must ensure accurate and timely disclosure of material information to the investors under the Companies Act 1965 and the guidelines issued by the Securities Commission and Bursa Malaysia. The current change in the public listed firms reporting is {{the implementation of the}} revised guidance known as Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control: Guidelines for Directors of <b>Listed</b> <b>Issuers</b> which was released on 31 December 2012. The guidelines are intended to guide directors in making disclosures concerning risk management and internal control in their firm's annual report pursuant to paragraph 15. 26 (b) of the Bursa Malaysia Listing Requirement. This study attempts a) to develop an index to measure the level of risk management and internal control disclosures for Malaysian listed firms and b) to measure the relationship between the board characteristics and risk management and internal control disclosures level among Malaysian public listed firms. The sample of this study consists of 150 firms listed in the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia for the year 2013.

40|$|The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) {{recently}} {{adopted a}} series of rules relaxing the restrictions imposed on public offerings. The largest public companies - defined as “well-known seasoned issuers” (WKSIs) - received the most extensive regulatory relief. Canada could adopt a version of WKSI status for the top tier of Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) issuers {{as part of a}} streamlined POP system. Careful consideration must be given, however, as to the appropriate standards for WKSI status in Canada. The standards adopted in the U. S. – US$ 700 million in market capitalization or US$ 1 billion in nonconvertible debt issued over the prior three years – might not be appropriate for the Canadian market, where issuers tend to be smaller. While the U. S. WKSI standards bring 30 % of <b>listed</b> <b>issuers</b> within the WKSI category, applying the same standards in the Canadian context would only bring regulatory relief to 17 % of Canadian companies listed on the TSX, and only 7 % of the total companies listed on the TSX and TSX Venture exchanges. This study analyzes the effect of extending WKSI status to the top 30 % of TSX issuers. Broadening the WKSI category in this fashion would reduce the market capitalization cutoff to approximately $ 330 million and bring in an additional 185 companies. Moreover, it would mean that WKSI status would cover companies representing 93 % of Canada’s total market capitalization...|$|R
