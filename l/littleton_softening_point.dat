40|$|An acrylic {{pressure-sensitive}} adhesive (PSA), bearing octadecyl acrylate, methyl acrylate and acrylic acid groups, and crosslinked by aluminum acetylacetonate (AlACA), displayed behavior unique among acrylic PSAs in that its adhesion, which decreases {{with an increase}} in temperature, began to increase again from around 150 °C. In order to understand this behavior, the structure and thermal properties of the PSA were investigated in detail, along with another PSA crosslinked by a covalent crosslinking agent (Az). From thermal mechanical analysis, the PSA with ionic crosslinks (AlACA) showed three <b>softening</b> <b>points</b> at 20, 60, and 160 °C. In comparison, the PSA covalently crosslinked by Az only exhibited two <b>softening</b> <b>points</b> (at 20 and 60 °C). The <b>softening</b> <b>point</b> at 160 °C is clearly related to ionic chelate crosslinking. DSC measurements indicated that the <b>softening</b> <b>point</b> at 20 °C resulted from melting of the ordered octadecyl group, and the <b>softening</b> <b>point</b> at 60 °C was due to an increase in the mobility of the main chain. The temperature dependence of viscoelastic measurements revealed that the viscosity of the PSA crosslinked by AlACA increased at around 160 °C. From these results, we considered that the distinctive adhesion of the PSA crosslinked by AlACA could be due to ligand exchange at the aluminum crosslinking points, which are chelated by carboxy groups built in the main chain...|$|R

Consequently, milkfat presented lower <b>softening</b> <b>point</b> and consistency.

These resinshave been used extensively {{in a wide variety}} of areas such as adhesives, paint, and printing inks industries. This product is prepared through polymerizing a petroleum fraction containing unsaturated hydrocarbons with the presence of Friedel-Crafts catalyst.

40|$|There is {{substantial}} {{evidence on the}} advantages of using crumb rubber in enhancing conventional bitumen properties, gaining environmental protection and boosting industrial-economical benefits. Thus, {{the use of this}} ingenious additive in bitumen modification through sustainable technology is highly advocated. The main objective of this research is to investigate the effects of different blending conditions (of time and temperature) and various crumb rubber contents on the properties of bitumen binders. Testing was conducted using the Dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) test and <b>softening</b> <b>point</b> test. The results showed that differing crumb rubber contents and blending temperature have significant effects on modified binder properties whereas the blending time showed an insignificant effect. Higher blending temperature and crumb rubber content were found to influence the interaction of bitumen-rubber blends and also increased the swelling rate of rubber particles, resulting in an increase in complex shear modulus (G*), storage modulus (G'), loss modulus (G") and <b>softening</b> <b>point</b> as well as a decrease in phase angle (&# 948;). Thus, the modified bitumen became less susceptible to deformation after stress removals.

Thus, in terms of elasticity for the <b>softening</b> <b>point</b> data, the storage modulus and phase angle were found to be good indicators of binder elasticity.

This study was carried out to design a cost effective and efficient <b>softening</b> <b>point</b> tester to classify bitumen into grades using jatropha oil as fluid bath instead of water.

40|$|The {{phenolic}} resin chemistry {{is an old}} chemistry that started in the late 1800 ’s. A lot of research work to gain understanding of {{phenolic resin}}s has been done and reported in literature. However, {{most of the studies}} are based on phenol novolac resins. It was necessary to acquire more knowledge on specifically o-cresol novolac (OCN) resins because of the interest in the production of these resins. The chemistry in question was new to Sasol and one of the major objectives of doing this work was to build in-house competency in this field. This was achieved by first investigating whether the available feed materials containing certain impurities can be used to synthesise o-cresol novolacs with set specifications of purity and physical characteristics. The suitability of the Sasol o-cresol in terms of its contamination with sulfur (which is sometimes found in relatively higher amounts due to operating conditions) was investigated. The results showed that the sulfur in o-cresol did not have a significant contribution in the sulfur of the OCN. Another contaminant, formic acid, an auto-oxidation product found in formalin solutions was also investigated. It was also observed that, at formic acid levels of up to 4000 ppm, there was no effect on the <b>softening</b> <b>point</b> of the OCN. Secondly, it was important to study and understand the effect of different reaction variables {{on the quality of the}} OCN resins. The effect of formaldehyde: o-cresol molar ratio was investigated, the <b>softening</b> <b>point</b> increased with the increase in the molar ratio. The effects of other reaction variables (catalyst, reaction time, temperature and formaldehyde feed rate) on the <b>softening</b> <b>point</b> of the OCN were also investigated using p-toluenesulfonic acid and oxalic acid as catalysts. With p-toluenesulfonic acid as a catalyst, the temperature had no effect on the <b>softening</b> <b>point,</b> while all the other variables showed an effect on this parameter.
