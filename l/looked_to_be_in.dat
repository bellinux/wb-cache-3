UConn cornerback Jasper Howard {{returned}} the ball 26yards to the Bulls' 41-yard line. The Huskies handed the ball to Donald Brown for five straight running plays, advancing {{the ball to the}} Buffalo 19-yard line as the first quarter clock expired.

5|$|At {{the start}} of the race, Lucas di Grassi {{challenged}} Jarno Trulli for the lead, but Trulli closed the racing line into turn one. As Trulli lost the rear end of the car going into turn three, di Grassi took the lead. The other Audi Sport Abt of Daniel Abt was less fortunate, being sent into a spin at the same corner, dropping {{to the back of the}} field. Nelson Piquet, Jr. immediately made up for ground lost in qualifying, gaining three positions during the first lap, running in tenth place. At turn six on the following lap, he went past Stéphane Sarrazin (Venturi) for ninth. While di Grassi built an early lead, several manoeuvres were made behind him, with Nicolas Prost (e.dams-Renault) losing two positions to Jérôme d'Ambrosio (Dragon Racing) and Vitantonio Liuzzi (Trulli GP), dropping back to seventh. Pole sitter Jarno Trulli <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> trouble with his car and lost positions continuously, running in thirteenth after lap twelve. Third placed Nick Heidfeld was also unable to hold onto his podium position, being overtaken by d'Ambrosio on lap thirteen.|$|E

25|$|After {{winning the}} toss and electing to bat, England {{initially}} <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> a promising position as Gooch and Stewart put on 123 {{for the first}} wicket. This {{turned out to be}} the biggest partnership of the match though, as from that point on, wickets fell at regular intervals. Waqar Younis ripped the heart out of the England middle order, removing Lamb, Botham and Lewis on the way to figures of 5–91. Pakistan's reply featured half-centuries from Aamir Sohail, Asif Mujtaba and Salim Malik, but they could only establish a first innings lead of 38, Malcolm and DeFreitas the pick of England's bowlers.|$|E

Juan Uribe of the White Sox added an RBI single in the 6th inning to {{increase}} the lead for Chicago. B.J. Upton hit a 2-run home run for the Rays in the 7th inning to make the game a bit closer, but the Rays could not get their bats going enough. The White Sox would take Game 3 by a final score of 5–3, living to play another day only down two games to one in the series.|$|E
25|$|Having waited fifteen days to {{play their}} quarter-final, Durham progressed to Finals Day after a 44-run win at the Riverside. Having been put into bat, the {{visitors}} took three early wickets, removing dangermen Phil Mustard, Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Paul Collingwood, with the score only on 26. After Michael Di Venuto fell, Durham <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> some trouble. However, a fifth wicket partnership of 53 between Will Smith and captain Dale Benkenstein pushed the score up. Smith made 51 as Durham set a target of 164, for Glamorgan to chase. It could've been somewhat lower {{had it not been}} for virtuoso innings by Gareth Breese, smashing 20 off just 9 balls, and Liam Plunkett who hit 12* off 3.

However, an excellent run of seven wins from their last eight games saw them secure fifth place and a play-off spot; without the well-publicised points deduction they would have finished second and earned automatic promotion. The deduction was heavily appealed, but this ultimately failed on 1 May 2008 when an independent arbitration panel ruled that the Football League were right to give Leeds this deduction.|$|E

25|$|The first Test {{was noted}} as a {{dramatic}} match with the advantage swinging {{between the two}} sides, culminating in a close result. England's opening innings of 215 all out was considered disappointing, however Australia seemed to be heading to a significant deficit after being reduced to 117/9 in the following innings. The record-breaking 10th-wicket stand revived the tourists to an unexpected 65-run lead {{by the end of}} the innings. England reclaimed the upper hand in the third innings, with Ian Bell's century contributing to a total of 375, setting Australia a target of 311 to win the Test. England <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> a strong position, as there had been only 10 recorded successful fourth-innings run chases of over 300 in Test history. However, Australia had a strong showing with the bat and were only 15 runs short of victory by the time the final partnership was broken in the afternoon session of the fifth day.|$|E
25|$|The Australians {{moved on}} to Bath to take on Somerset, and the weather finally began to look favourable. Australia won the toss and decided to bat on a decent batting wicket. Rick McCosker went cheaply and was soon {{followed}} by Craig Serjeant, but captain Greg Chappell <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> commanding touch. He set about building a strong partnership with Gary Cosier, which saw the tourists pass 150 for 2. Soon after though, Cosier misread a straight one on off-stump from West Indian paceman Joel Garner, and was clean-bowled for 44. Doug Walters made a useful but disappointing 23, but David Hookes and Rod Marsh both failed with 3 apiece. Kerry O'Keeffe added a useful 11 to help see Australia past 200, but a collapsing tail saw Australia all out for 232 off 67.3 overs, with Chappell top-scorer with 113. The Australian captain hit three 6s in his innings, including one into the nearby River Avon. Garner finished with 4 for 66, but local medium-pacer Graham Burgess was the pick of the bowlers with 5 for 25.|$|E
25|$|England headed over to India in 2008 for {{the final}} tour of the year. Optimism was high {{following}} the demolition of South Africa in the ODI series, as much was expected ahead of Kevin Pietersen's first full Test series as captain. The tour started with seven ODI's. England were heavily defeated in the first match, with India posting 387/5 in their 50 overs. England could only manage 229 and the result lead to criticism due to {{the manner of the}} defeat. England improved in the second match although they still lost by 54 runs, although this time they had restricted India to 292. England narrowly lost the third ODI, losing on the DL Method by 16 runs. England lost the fourth ODI on the DL Method again, this time by 19 runs. Both results were controversial as England <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> control in both games and would have probably gone on to win. However, England were now 4-0 down with just three games left to play, meaning they had lost the series. The fifth ODI, resulted in a six wicket defeat for England. After England had posted 270/4, India chased it down within 44 overs. The final two games of the series were cancelled following the 2008 Mumbai attacks.|$|E

25|$|Before {{the start}} of the 2015 season, plenty of changes took place at the club. Matthew Maynard stepped into the role of Director of Cricket after the club parted ways with Nosworthy. With the loss of Kieswetter, Somerset also lost another senior batsman in Compton as he moved back to London. Alfonso Thomas became captain in one-day {{competitions}} with Trescothick remaining as club and First-class captain. Somerset also made some new signings, including Chris Gayle for {{the start of}} the t20 Blast. For the most part the season followed much the same path as the last, with Somerset failing to reach the latter stages of either limited overs competition and battling for the lower places in the Championship. Despite Gayle providing 328 runs in his three innings with the club, Somerset languished second from bottom in the t20 Blast. With Thomas sent out on loan, new signing Jim Allenby took over the captaincy for the One-Day Cup and despite winning their last three matches, Somerset missed out on a quarter-final spot. In the Championship Somerset <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> relegation trouble for much of the season, but led by a late run of form from Trescothick and thanks to a maximum points victory in their final game, Somerset avoided the drop by a margin of 22 points and finished 6th in Division One for the third consecutive year. James Hildreth was the leading Championship run scorer in Division One.|$|E
25|$|Adam Gilchrist {{opened in}} his usual quick-hitting style, making 60 runs from 48 balls, {{including}} nine fours and one six. At one stage, {{in the course of}} three overs, Gilchrist piled on 41 runs. His partner Hayden contributed one run during this time. Chris Cairns was brought into the attack to attempt to slow the run rate, but it took the bowling of Scott Styris to remove Gilchrist from the batting crease, caught by Nathan Astle. The new batsman Ricky Ponting with Hayden put together a useful partnership to be 1/140, before Ponting was dismissed after making 32. It was in Ponting's innings that New Zealand's veteran bowler Chris Harris, in saving four runs, dove to his left, landed awkwardly on his shoulder and tore his rotator cuff, in his 250th ODI. Ponting's dismissal proved to be the precursor to another middle order collapse for Australia, for Hayden was dismissed just a few minutes later for 43, and in even shorter order Damien Martyn was dismissed for 5 and Andrew Symonds for his second consecutive duck. Australia had lost four wickets for eight runs and <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> some bother, which was exacerbated five overs later with the loss of Michael Clarke for just six runs. At six wickets down though, Darren Lehmann and Brad Hogg steadied and put on a partnership of 74 runs before Darren Lehmann was run out with two overs remaining at 7/235. The incoming batsman Brett Lee put on 10 quick runs and Brad Hogg a further 16 to have Australia at 7/261 after 50 overs.|$|E
25|$|After {{winning the}} toss and electing to bat North Otago <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> {{trouble in the}} first innings being 116-9 but a record {{breaking}} 10th wicket partnership of 91 between Duncan Drew and David Sewell bought some respectability to the score. North Otago all out for 207 with Duncan Drew top scoring with 102, notching up his second century at Hawke Cup level and Sewell 37 not out. Bryan Templeman took 6-56 for the home side. At {{the end of the}} first day, the game was even with Manawatu 61-3 at stumps and just after lunch during the second day North Otago had a 48 run lead when the home side was bowled out for 159. Ben Cant (3-29) and David Sewell (3-50) were the main wicket takers with three wickets each. When stumps was called at the end of the second day North Otago was in a strong position, being 138-3 with a lead of 186. the inning was completed just after lunch on the third day and North Otago had 262 on the board to set Manawatu 311 of 58 overs for an outright victory. Darren Broom scored the second century of the game, combining with Drew for an 83 run partnership for the 4th wicket. For Manawatu J Cunningham took the a five wicket bag, finishing with 5-99 of his 33 overs. Manawatu started aggressively in their innings looking to put North Otago under pressure, however with wickets constantly falling and good partnerships failing to materialize they fell short by 159 runs to retain the Hawke Cup. Once again David Sewell picked up three wickets finishing with 3-31 of 8 overs while captain Chirs Smith took 3-23 including the final wicket. North Otago victors in its fourth Hawke Cup Challenge and for the first time in the 99-year history of the cup, holders of the Hawke Cup.|$|E
