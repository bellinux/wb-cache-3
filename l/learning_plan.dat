40|$|Abstract. This paper {{considers}} some of {{the issues}} involved in building a crowd-based system for learning music socially in communities. The effective imple-mentation of building such systems provides several fascinating challenges {{if they are to be}} sufficiently flexible and personal for effective social learning to take place when they are large number of users. Based on our experiences of building the infrastructure for a crowd-based music learning system in Goldsmiths called MusicCircle we address several {{some of the}} challenges using an agent based ap-proach, employing formal specifications to articulate the agent design which can later be used for software development. The challenges addressed are: 1) How can a learner be provided with a personalised learning experience? 2) How can a learner make best use of the heterogenous community of humans and agents who co-habit the virtual learning environment? We present formal specifications for an open learner model, a <b>learning</b> environment, <b>learning</b> <b>plans</b> and a personal learn-ing agent. The open learner model represents the learner as having current and desired skills and knowledge and past and present <b>learning</b> <b>plans.</b> The <b>learning</b> environment is an online platform affording learning tasks which can be carried out by individuals or communities of users and agents. Tasks are connected to-gether into <b>learning</b> <b>plans,</b> with pre and post conditions. We demonstrate how the personal learning agent can find <b>learning</b> <b>plans</b> and propose social connections for its user within a system which affords a dynamic set of <b>learning</b> <b>plans</b> and a range of human / agent social relationships, such as learner-teacher, learner-learner and producer-commentator. ...|$|R

To serve {{the gifted and}} talented student, it needs the whole learning management service. In particular, this research aims to describe the English learning management for acceleration program at SMA Negeri 1 Purworejo. It consists of characteristic of English <b>learning</b> <b>planning,</b> characteristic of English learning processing and characteristic of English learning evaluating. Besides that, this research also aims to describe the superiority of English learning management for acceleration program. This research uses a qualitative approach. The data source informants of this research are English teacher of regular program, English teacher of acceleration program, chairman of acceleration program, vice principle of curriculum, and principle at SMA Negeri 1 Purworejo. The data collection techniques of this research are document study, observation and interview. The data analysis technique that is taken in this research, namely the data comparison of regular program and acceleration program, the combination of comparison result data with interview result, and the data interpretation. This research has shown that English <b>learning</b> <b>planning</b> for acceleration program at SMA Negeri 1 Purworejo has characteristic of time allotment acceleration and enrichment of wide and deep indicator. The time allotment acceleration that is in syllabus and lesson plan of acceleration program seems clearly if two kinds of <b>learning</b> <b>planning</b> are compared with <b>learning</b> <b>planning</b> or regular program. The regular program planning of one semester has time allocation in six months, meanwhile acceleration program planning of one semester has time four months. The enrichment of <b>learning</b> <b>planning</b> for acceleration program appears in wide and deep indicator. The indicator of <b>learning</b> <b>planning</b> for acceleration program is diversified until language application level. The English learning processing of acceleration program has characteristic of trained student to stand-alone. The trained student of acceleration program seems clearly if it is compared the student activity of regular program in learning processing. In the elaboration, student of regular program still needs teacher guidance. The role of teacher in regular program is enough dominant. Meanwhile, in the elaboration activity, student of acceleration program had stood alone. The teacher of acceleration program has role-play as facilitator in learning. The English learning evaluating of acceleration program has characteristic of high claim. The evaluation claim of acceleration program is until using language namely listening, speaking, reading, and writing contextually. ...|$|R
40|$|Student <b>learning</b> <b>plans</b> (SLPs) {{represent}} an emerging practice in how public {{schools across the}} country are supporting the development of students' college and career readiness skills. <b>Learning</b> <b>plans</b> are student-driven planning and monitoring tools that provide opportunities to identify postsecondary goals, explore college and career options and develop the skills necessary to be autonomous, self-regulated learners. Currently, 23 states plus the District of Columbia require that students develop <b>learning</b> <b>plans,</b> and Massachusetts state policymakers are considering whether all {{middle and high school students}} should be required to develop <b>learning</b> <b>plans.</b> Legislation is currently pending that calls for the Executive Office of Education to convene an advisory group to investigate and study a development and implementation process for six-year career planning to be coordinated by licensed school guidance counselors for all students in grades 6 to 12. The purpose of the policy brief Student Learning Plans: Supporting Every Student's Transition to College and Career is to provide policymakers in Massachusetts with a better understanding of what student <b>learning</b> <b>plans</b> are as well as how and to what extent their use is mandated in other states. The brief is organized into five major sections: an overview of SLPs and the rationale for their use in public K- 12 education; an overview of the research on the effectiveness of SLPs on improving a variety of student outcomes, including engagement, responsibility, motivation, long-term postsecondary college and career planning; current state trends in mandating SLPs for all students, including the structure and implementation of SLPs, their connection to other high school reform initiatives and their alignment with state and federal career awareness and workforce development initiatives; promising implementation strategies; and, considerations for state policymakers. Considerations for Massachusetts policymakers include: learn from states that are pioneers in the implementation of SLPs for all students; develop a comprehensive implementation plan; and, strengthen career counseling and career awareness activities in Massachusetts schools. The policy brief was the subject of discussion during a public webinar on June 30, 2011...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{issues that}} arise when integrating a planner {{with a system}} that <b>learns</b> <b>planning</b> operators incrementally, and our approaches to address these issues. During learning, domain knowledge can be incomplete and incorrect in different ways; therefore the planner {{must be able to}} use incomplete domain knowledge. This presents the following challenges for planning: How should the planner effectively generate plans using incomplete and incorrect domain knowledge? How should the planner repair plans upon execution failures? How should <b>planning,</b> <b>learning,</b> and execution be integrated? This paper describes how we address these challenges in the framework of an integrated system, called OBSERVER, that <b>learns</b> <b>planning</b> operators automatically and incrementally. In OBSERVER, operators are learned by observing expert agents and by practicing in a learning-by-doing paradigm.
