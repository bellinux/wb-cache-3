40|$|Background : A {{large body}} of {{research}} has compared relationship satisfaction and quality in cohabiting versus married relationships. Despite increased recognition of couples in living apart together (<b>LAT)</b> <b>relationships,</b> very little research has examined the experiences of couples in <b>LAT</b> <b>relationships</b> compared to co-residential unions. Objective : Our aim is to develop knowledge about the experiences of different union types by investigating relationship satisfaction of people in LAT, cohabiting, and marital relationships. We differentiate those with intentions to marry for cohabiters, and those with intentions to marry or live together in <b>LAT</b> <b>relationships.</b> We also examine differences by gender and country. Methods : Using data from Wave 1 of the Generations and Gender Survey in France, Germany, Australia, and Russia (n = 9, 604), OLS regressions are estimated to investigate a) differences in relationship satisfaction across relationship types, and b) across countries. Results : Married people have {{the highest levels of}} relationship satisfaction. People in non-marital unions with intentions to marry or live together are significantly more satisfied than those without marriage or cohabitation intentions. Those in <b>LAT</b> <b>relationships</b> with no intentions to live together have the lowest levels of relationship satisfaction. There is evidence of cross-national variation with differences in relationship satisfaction by union type most pronounced in Australia and Russia. Gender differences are found with women reporting lower levels of relationship satisfaction than men. Conclusions : <b>LAT</b> <b>relationships</b> are qualitatively different to co-residential unions.

40|$|Living apart {{together}} (<b>LAT)</b> <b>relationships</b> cover a {{range and}} variety of relationship forms and practices. Whether LAT is conceptualised as a new relationship form, or as just another name for traditional ‘special’ boy/girlfriend’, the level of commitment is often seen as weak or insecure. In turn this perception impacts on policy and the socio-legal recognition of <b>LAT</b> <b>relationships.</b> Drawing {{on the results of}} a multi-method study, using national survey information in combination with 50 semi-structured interviews, we assess the nature and level of commitment in <b>LAT</b> <b>relationships.</b> We find that sexual exclusivity is demanded by a majority of participants, regardless of their reasons for living apart. Similarly, nearly all subscribe to ideas of coupledom and maintain dense personal and electronic contact. This indicates at least a basic level of commitment present in almost all <b>LAT</b> <b>relationships.</b> The interview material additionally indicates that despite the increased freedom and autonomy that living apart can offer, many LAT partners also provide significant amounts of care, either to their partner or to children. The degree of commitment was related to a number of factors including: the reason for living apart; whether this was a choice or a result of circumstances; and the stage of the relationship; whether the couple were ready to cohabit. While a few apparently low commitment ‘pure relationships’ are found, these are a small minority. Therefore, while those in <b>LAT</b> <b>relationships</b> can more easily be less committed than those in co-residential relationships, the evidence suggests that they are not...|$|R
40|$|Background and aim : In Germany, {{there are}} {{couples who are}} neither married nor living together. They are called “Living Apart Together (LAT) ”. LAT are {{characterized}} by high degree of instability and of low fertility. This study extends prior researches on the links among LAT and realized fertility. Hypothesis: H 1) LAT is more common among young people with liberal attitudes, among highly educated people and among who lived previous broken relationship’s episodes. H 2) The “leap of faith” needed for moving from a <b>LAT</b> <b>relationship</b> to a cohabiting one {{is greater than the}} one needed to transition from cohabitation to marriage H 3) There is a negative correlation between lat relationships and Desire of a(nother) child H 4) LAT relationships {{have a negative impact on}} realized fertility also in the short term Material and methods : This study uses data collected by the German Family Panel Pairfam (“Panel Analysis of Intimate Relationships and Family Dynamics“). The survey data are collected annually on a national level, in 6 waves (until now) from 2008 - 09 to 2013 - 14. People who have a partner, who are heterosexuals, who answered to be not infertile, were selected for the analysis. Since the Pairfam study has interviewed also the partners of the research persons, a merge between the data bases of anchor persons (Pairfam and Demodiff were appended together) and their partners were created in order to investigate the agreements between partners. Descriptive analysis show the main results. The cohort 1991 - 1993 has been omitted for the analysis of relationships. Dummy and categorical variables were generated for GLM (with the software R) that, because of its flexibility to incorporate multiple quantitative and qualitative independent variables, is an useful method to investigate the interactions among LAT (536 units in the wave 1), desired and realized fertility. Backward elimination method has been employed to obtain the minimal adjusted models for each GLM.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. This is a mixed methods data collection. The research aimed to provide definitive evidence {{about the nature and}} experience of 'living apart together' (LAT) in Britain. While LATs feature in recent sociological literature and popular debate, there has been little systematic social research carried out into this type of relationship. There are also policy implications in how people who live apart together (LATs) live their family and personal lives. The research had six linked objectives: to distinguish different types of <b>LAT</b> <b>relationship,</b> and to map the social location of those in LATs by class, age, and gender to map LAT social practices and relationships to evaluate the complex of biographical, material and psychosocial factors leading individuals to live apart together to examine the meanings, understandings and narratives produced by LATs about partnering, personal life, and caring to examine the benefits, ambivalences and stresses experienced by LATs, both materially and emotionally to establish how far LATs represent a move 'beyond the family' or remain 'within the family' The project used a multi-method analysis based on three methodological strands. This was designed to yield both a detailed and representative description of LAT in Britain, and an in-depth knowledge of the practices, understandings, and feelings of people who live apart together. Strand 1 consisted of a national survey of LATs in 2011. This included combined data from three statistically representative general population surveys. These were the NatCen Social Research Omnibus, the British Social Attitudes Survey (held at the UK Data Archive under GN 33168), and the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Opinions Survey (held at the UK Data Archive under GN 33441). All three constituent surveys used face-to-face interviews, and were based on random probability sample designs in which interviewers were sent to a randomly selected list of addresses and then required to randomly select an individual to take part. The combined sample covers Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland). The surveys identified 572 LATs. Strand 2 took 50 semi-structured, conversational, interviews of around one hour with people in a <b>LAT</b> <b>relationship,</b> which accessed individual practices, meanings and understandings about living apart together in more depth. The sample took the national survey as a sampling frame in which respondents were purposively selected according to the reasons for living apart given in their survey responses. This had the advantage of creating an interview sample which - while not statistically representative – reflected the range and diversity of living apart together in Britain. Two interviews have not been archived due to consent restrictions; therefore the collection comprises of 48 interviews. Strand 3 involved 16 different survey respondents, chosen purposively to reflect a diversity of life experience and LAT type, used biographical narrative interviews, to examine individual histories, subjectivities and narrative meaning-making practices in relation to LAT relationships. These data have a particular advantage of enabling us to look at how issues arose in-vivo in the course of self-directed narratives. Also included are 16 relationship maps which were created by respondents as part of the interview process. In combination these three sources provide a comprehensive database for understanding living apart together relationships in Britain. Further information is available on the Centre for Applied Social Research's Living Apart Together project webpages and the ESRC Living Apart Together: a multi-method analysis webpage. Main Topics : Strand 1 : Survey respondents were asked questions on their relationship history and plans, their relationship practices and understandings, why they lived apart together, and attitudes about LAT. Standard socio-demographic information was also collected. Strand 2 : The semi-structured interviews covered details of current relationship, details of previous relationships, views on commitment, who they would turn to for practical, emotional and financial support, responsibilities in the relationship and views on legal rights of LATs. The interview also included an exercise where respondents were asked to create two lists, one with the people who were most important to the respondent and one with the people with whom they were closest to. Strand 3 : The Biographical Narrative Interpretive Method (BNIM) was used so respondents were asked {{to tell the story of}} their life and personal relationships and to include all the events and experiences which have been important to them. The interview also included an exercise where respondents were asked to create a relationship map by adding the names of people they were close to or who were important in their life to concentric circles...|$|E
40|$|Background : This special {{collection}} {{is the result}} of a collaboration between a group of family scholars from Europe and the United States. It initially developed from the observation that in many Western countries new types of couple relationships have emerged alongside marriage (i. e., cohabitation and living-apart-together [LAT] relationships). Although the trend seems universal, it is likely that the prevalence of different relationship types, and their outcomes in particular, vary across countries. Countries differ in how they institutionalize and confer meaning on new relationship types. Such differences may have important implications for how couples behave and organize their daily lives, in turn affecting the well-being of family members. The articles in this special collection aim to understand the organization and relationship outcomes ofcohabitation, marriage, and <b>LAT</b> <b>relationships</b> across countries. Contribution : Although there has been an upsurge in cross-national research on new relationship types, most studies focus on cohabitation and less so on <b>LAT</b> <b>relationships.</b> In addition, most studies examine how new relationship types differ from marriage in demographic aspects (e. g., childbearing, union stability) or in terms of family members' well-being. Little cross-national evidence exists about differences with regard to how couples negotiate and give form to their relationship in their daily lives, or about dimensions that go beyond the relationship itself, such as people's relationships with their larger family. This special collection contributes to the existing body of knowledge by studying new relationships from a comparative perspective, looking at <b>LAT</b> <b>relationships</b> as well as cohabitation, and examining how couples differ from each other on relationship dimensions that have been relatively understudied...|$|R

Little {{is known about the}} meaning of living apart together (<b>LAT)</b> <b>relationships,</b> and whether <b>LAT</b> is an alternative to marriage and cohabitation or a dating relationship. OBJECTIVE: We examine across Europe: (1) the prevalence of LAT, (2) the reasons for LAT, and (3) the correlates of (a) <b>LAT</b> <b>relationships</b> vis-à-vis being single, married, or cohabiting, and (b) different types of LAT union. METHODS: Using Generations and Gender Survey data from ten Western and Eastern European countries, we present descriptive statistics about LATs and estimate multinominal logistic regression models to assess the correlates of being in different types of LAT unions. RESULTS: <b>LAT</b> <b>relationships</b> are uncommon, but they are more common in Western than Eastern Europe. Most people in LAT unions intend to live together but are apart for practical reasons. LAT is more common among young people, those enrolled in higher education, people with liberal attitudes, highly educated people, and those who have previously cohabited or been married. Older people and divorced or widowed persons are more likely to choose LAT to maintain independence. Surprisingly, attitudinal and educational differences are more pronounced in Eastern Europe than in Western Europe. CONCLUSIONS: A tentative conclusion is that LAT is more often a stage in the union formation process than an alternative to marriage and cohabitation. Yet some groups do view LAT as substituting for marriage and cohabitation, and these groups differ between East and West. In Eastern Europe a cultural, highly educated elite seems {{to be the first to}} resist traditional marriage norms and embrace LAT (and cohabitation) as alternative living arrangements, whereas this is less the case in Western Europe.

40|$|About 10 % {{of adults}} in Britain have a living apart {{together}} (LAT) relationship; they are nearly always administratively and legally defined as single {{but in fact}} they have a partner who lives elsewhere. The question then arises, should LAT couples have access to legal rights and protection {{in the same way}} as proposed (in Britain) or achieved (in other jurisdictions) for unmarried cohabitants? Using both a national survey and in-depth interviews, we find that a significant proportion of LAT partners extend substantial levels of care and support both to each other and, if relevant, to their partners' dependent children. For other LAT partners levels of support are lower, or even absent. Similarly, about a third of our interviewees thought <b>LAT</b> <b>relationships</b> should have given legal rights, a third thought these should depend on circumstances, while the final third were opposed to any extension of legal rights or thought this unnecessary. A number of overarching themes surrounded this issue in interviewees' narratives - the presence of children, the existence of commitment, the longevity of the relationship, the logistics of organising a legal system, and the possibility that some might take advantage. We suggest that ‘opt-in’ legal provisions could provide a model for any extension of legal rights to <b>LAT</b> <b>relationships</b> in the UK...|$|R
40|$|The non-institutionalised, {{flexible}} {{nature of}} living-apart-together (LAT) {{raises questions about}} partner commitment, {{in the context of}} the debate about the individualisation of society. We explored how partner commitment in <b>LAT</b> <b>relationships</b> in the Netherlands is shaped by individuals’ satisfaction with, alternatives to, investments in and social support for their relationship. The underlying theoretical framework is an extended version of the Investment Model of Commitment. We conducted 22 semi-structured, in-depth interviews with men and women. The major themes that were addressed in the analysis were commitment, satisfaction, alternatives, investments, social support, relationship history and future plans. Participants were emotionally highly attached to their partner, but they doubted their commitment to maintaining their relationship in the future. Satisfaction with the current partner and intrinsic investments, such as emotions and effort, were described as contributing the most to feelings of commitment. Social support, quality of alternatives and extrinsic investments, such as material ties, were felt to contribute the least. Relationship history and life experience played an important role in how middle-aged and older individuals, of whom many were divorced, perceived the four determinants and experienced commitment. In this context, LAT expressed fear of commitment and getting hurt, which was further reflected in limited investments. The paper concludes that although emotional attachment appears to be high, people in <b>LAT</b> <b>relationships</b> may have a relatively limited belief and interest in life-long partnerships...|$|R

40|$|Despite recent {{moves in}} family {{sociology}} in the UK towards alternative and more inclusive notions {{of family and}} family relationships (intimacy, personal life, relationality and so on), there remains a pervasive appeal {{to the notion of}} ‘family’ in British public, political and policy discourse. What Gilding (2010) has noted is that the writing out of ‘family’ has also resulted in a writing out of convention as a central part of relationships and family life. What we hope to demonstrate in this paper is both that family is still an important notion for individuals in varying circumstances, and that notions of convention and tradition are pivotal in the constructions of family life. We demonstrate the pervasiveness of ‘family’, ‘families’ and ‘tradition’ through two examples: LAT (living apart together- a potentially ‘troubling’ concept in itself) and marriage. While <b>LAT</b> <b>relationships</b> have been heralded by some as a mark of transformed, individualised lives where individuals can live in relationships free from the conventions that previously restricted them, what we found instead is that LAT is often used as a precursor to more traditional cohabitation or marriage or that LAT is used as a protection or defensive relationship state after bad previous experiences. Neither state suggests individualised lives free from constraints and convention. Similar findings were revealed when talking to young women about marriage who were, on the whole, extremely keen to conform to the traditional norms and conventions of gendered marital roles. What we conclude is that a new discourse is required to talk about the nature of family and personal relationships and we suggest that family relationships and personal life are constructed and reconstructed and invented and re-invented through choice, agency, convention and tradition- of which the appeal to ‘family’ is clearly a part...|$|R
40|$|Few studies exist which {{describe}} the actual initiation and progression of new late-life romantic relationships, particularly within an Australian context. This is surprising, {{as it is}} likely that the dynamics of romance in later life differ from romance amongst younger adults. Previous research which has looked specifically at heterosexual older adults has largely described their sexual functioning rather than the meaning they give to their loving partnerships. Because of this dearth of research, little is known about late life dating and mating habits. This thesis attempts to fill this gap, by investigating romantic relationships which begin in later life [...] -after divorce or widowhood, or for those who have never married [...] -with a special focus on relationships which are mediated via online technology. It presents findings from qualitative semi-structured interviews with 45 older adults, aged 60 years of age and over residing in Australia. The findings show that the older adults in this study found new romantic partnerships as a consequence of their offline social activities and also by deliberately joining online dating websites. These partnerships were meaningful, important and sexually intimate. However, very few progressed to cohabitation or marriage, with most of the older adults preferring to date or live functionally separately, even when their relationships were long-term and committed, in order to avoid providing care-giving and instrumental support. This phenomenon, which is known in Europe as living apart together (LAT; Levin & Trost 1999), is only now coming to the attention of the Australian research community and only in a quantitative sense (see Reimondos, Evans & Gray 2011). With its qualitative focus, the current study therefore presents novel information. The findings indicate that these older adults were looking for and finding egalitarian 'pure'-type relationships (Giddens 1992) based on emotional and sexual equality but not necessarily based on cohabitation or monogamy. The thesis argues that these older adult <b>LAT</b> <b>relationships</b> embody a new family form within Australia and one which will only become more prevalent as society ages...|$|R

It showed that teachers did find that the LATs supported their teaching using AfL strategies, but revealed that a majority of teachers do not use the tasks as formatively as they could be used. From the online questionnaire, a descriptive framework for how the LATs support teaching and learning is proposed. Five case studies where teachers used a LAT were observed. The data collected included a post-lesson pupil questionnaire, an interview with a group of pupils and an interview of the teacher. From these cases, a theory seeking approach to educational case studies through fuzzy propositions (Bassey, 1999) was used to develop a model of the relationship between teacher values and pupil values to assessment tasks. The fuzzy generalisations proposed from the case studies were that: (1) Teacher attitudes to the LATs may influence pupil attitudes to the LATs, (2) Teachers with a „big picture of levels‟ may be more likely to use LATs formatively and (3) Teachers who engage pupils with the notion of „levelness‟ may be more likely to improve conceptual development of pupils. The notion of „levelness‟ is explored. This evolves into three issues being explored: whether grades should be shared with pupils, the <b>LATs</b> <b>relationship</b> with summative and formative assessment practices and why such tasks have become popular with science teachers. The latter is considered in the context of the current target-driven culture of schools in England. Finally, the future of assessments like the LATs is discussed in relation to current policy and recommendations for their use and development are considered...|$|R
40|$|Interpretations {{of living}} apart {{together}} (LAT) have typically counter-posed ‘new’ versus ‘continuist’ perspectives. Recent surveys, however, construct LAT as a heterogeneous category which support a ‘qualified continuist’ position – most people live apart {{as a response}} to practical circumstances or as a modern version of ‘boy/girlfriend’, although a minority represents something new in preferring to live apart as a more permanent family form. This paper interrogates this conclusion by examining in detail why people live apart together, using information from a nationally representative survey from Britain and from interview accounts. Our analysis shows well one important feature of living apart together – its flexible pragmatism. LAT as a category contains different sorts of relationship, with different needs and desires. While overall coupledom remains pivotal and cohabitation remains the goal for most, LAT allows more freedom for manoeuvre in conducting <b>relationships.</b> <b>LAT</b> is both ‘new’ and a ‘continuation’...|$|R
40|$|These policy {{recommendations}} {{are based on}} main findings of the largescale EU Seventh Framework project, Changing families and sustainable societies: Policy contexts and diversity over the life course and across generations (FamiliesAndSocieties). This executive summary highlights {{a few of the}} key {{policy recommendations}}: • Policy makers ought {{to be aware of the}} remarkable diversity of family forms and relationships in contemporary Europe, and aim for a better understanding of the nature and mechanisms of family constellations beyond married couples with children. • Policy measures aiming to prevent/reduce the reproduction of vulnerability in families ought to be broad, complementary and embedded into a comprehensive strategy. They should comprise services addressing the needs of particularly vulnerable children as well as reconciliation policies, educational policies and other policy measures. Family constellations more at risk of vulnerability such as single parents, stepfamilies, large families, same-sex families, immigrant families and living-apart-together (<b>LAT)</b> <b>relationships</b> need to be addressed within their specific parameters. • More direct supports to youth are needed in most European countries, with the state playing an active role in enabling young people in their transition to adulthood. Financial independence is fundamental. However, the achievement of self-sufficiency is a process preferably supported with a social package encompassing education, housing, job market access, family benefits and social aid. • Law, policies and practices have to assess the effects of any privatization or transfer of care (for children, the elderly, frail individuals) back on the family as to all persons concerned, those receiving the care and the caregivers. Reconciliation of care and work should be supported by implementing care leaves not limited to young children, reducing working hours and allowing for greater flexibility in work time for adults in need. • To be able to design policies for sustainable societies we need to extend our knowledge on the new roles of men and women and their implications for families and societies. Family-friendly policies, such as parental leave, should consider both parents, as each of their time investments matters for child development. • Affordable child care, out of school care and recreation should be available, given the positive association between formal child care and positive child outcomes, which is stronger for children living in more disadvantaged environments. Early and universal access to formal child care is also one of the most efficient interventions to reduce disadvantages among immigrant children. • Education and information are key policy issues. Education of children reduces inequality in children’s life chances when they reach adulthood. Information and counselling for parents helps them to cope with parental roles, and raising awareness of employers—and society at large—enhances the understanding of challenges faced by parents. • Both labour market and family policies aimed at better reconciliation of work and family responsibilities are required to be supportive for the reallocation of paid and unpaid work between women and men, to diminish gender inequality in economic positions across the life course, and to promote rewarding contacts between generations. Policies aimed at reducing social and economic inequalities that favour the reconciliation of family life, private life and professional life will also help reduce children’s disadvantages and challenges associated with parents’ divorce or separation...|$|R
40|$|After an {{academic}} career of 35 years, {{most of which}} as ordinary professor, Prof. Dr. Wilfried Dumon became professor emeritus {{at the end of}} September 1998. Together with a few others, he was present at the cradle of Leuven sociology {{in the middle of the}} 1960 s. He participated in the construction of the necessary administrative, logistic, and academic structures as well as in the establishment of the research and educational domains in which Leuven sociology would specialize. Very soon there developed a unique sociological prespective that is known as the Leuven triangle: the integration of sociological theory, methodology, and social policy. Within this framework, the name of Wilfried Dumon is inextricably bound up with the sociology of the family, or more broadly, with the family sciences. Without doubt, he was the standard bearer of Flemish family sociology. Hundreds of students profited from his unusual - others would use much more colorful adjectives - form of teaching, in both form and content. He was directly or indirectly responsible for virtually all the courses in Leuven family sociology, also outside of his own Faculty. And those whose licentiate or doctoral thesis dealt with a theme that was in any way related to subjects like marriage, the family, or sexuality, were invariably confronted with his critical analysis and unique vocabulary. Wilfried Dumon also took on many policy positions such as editorial secretary or editor-in-chief of journals, director or manager of all sorts of institutions, and member, director or chairman of several commissions and associations. And all of this both nationally and internationally. Indeed, Wilfried Dumon had and has an extensive and tightly knit network of warm academic contacts the world over. On the occasion of his retirement, a liber amicorum has been compiled. With this initiative, the Faculty of Social Sciences, the Department of Sociology, and the Section for the Sociology of the Family, the Population and Health Care wish to express deep appreciation and gratitude for an inspirer and standard bearer. More than 20 scholars wish to give an international salute to a highly valued colleague. Koen Matthijs Prof. Dr. Wilfried Dumon: a portrait I. Family theory J.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how people living apart together (<b>LATs)</b> maintain their <b>relationships,</b> and describes how they view this living arrangement. It draws on a 2011 survey on LAT in Britain, supplemented by qualitative interviewing. Most LATs in Britain live {{close to their}} partners, and have frequent contact with them. At the same time most see LAT {{in terms of a}} monogamous, committed couple, where marriage remains a strong normative reference point, and see living apart as not much different from co-residence in terms of risk, emotional security or closeness. Many see themselves living together in the future. However, LAT does appear to make difference to patterns of care between partners. In addition, LATs report advantages in terms of autonomy and flexibility. The paper concludes that LAT allows individuals some freedom to manoeuvre in balancing the demands of life circumstances and personal needs with those of an intimate relationship, but that practices of LAT do not, in general, represent a radical departure from the norms of contemporary coupledom, except for that which expects couples to cohabit...|$|R
40|$|Inbreeding {{results from}} the mating of related {{individuals}} and has negative consequence because it brings together deleterious variants in one individual. Inbreeding is associated with recessive diseases and reduced production or fitness. Until recently inbreeding was estimated with genealogical data, which have some limitations. Genomic estimates of inbreeding can now be obtained thanks to new technologies. Methods based on genomic relationships assume either that identical-by-state markers are identical-by-descent (IBD) or correct for the allele frequencies estimated in a « founder generation ». Similarly, with runs of homozygosity (ROH), the hypothesis is that stretches of homozygous markers longer than a determined threshold (measured in number of markers or in Mb) are IBD. Although sequencing data are more informative, most of the recent studies used genotyping data. Due to high genotyping errors rates with sequencing technologies, ROH are difficult to use on such data. We herein describe an original method to model inbreeding along chromosomes. It relies on a hidden Markov model that determines locally whether a segment is inbred and gives a measure of inbreeding's age. The method uses a function modeling the probability to observe a genotype in an inbred segments. It is well suited for sequencing data because the function incorporates genotyping errors and uncertainty associated with low or moderate coverage. We first determine the properties of our new method with different simulation scenarii. Then, we use it to estimate inbreeding in the Belgian Blue Beef cattle population with either genotyping arrays (of various densities) or whole genome sequencing data. The estimates will be compared to those obtained with other methods (pedigree, ROH, genomic <b>relationship).</b> <b>Latest</b> results will be presented...|$|R
