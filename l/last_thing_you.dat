500|$|When Madonna {{recorded}} it, even as our demo faded out, on the fade {{you could}} hear Tom saying, [...] "When your heart beats, and you hold me, and you love me..." [...] That was the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> heard as our demo faded. Madonna must have listened to it very, very carefully because her record ends with the exact same little ad-libs that our demo did. That rarely happens that someone studies your demo so carefully that they use all that stuff. We were sort of flattered how carefully she followed our demo on that.|$|E
500|$|This [...] "70/30 Law" [...] was {{not only}} applied to the visual designs for the film, {{but also for the}} sound effects and music. Sound {{designer}} Dane Davis mentioned that he and his team [...] "scoured hobby shops and junk stores for antique windup toys and old spinning mechanisms" [...] in order to create the sound effects for John Silver to [...] "avoid sounding slick or sci-fi". The team did some experimentation with the sound used in dialogues, especially with the robot B.E.N., but opted to keep Short's natural voice because everything they tried [...] "affected his comedy", and [...] "the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> want to do in a story like this is affect performances".|$|E
500|$|Horsfield's first Premier League goal {{came in the}} September 2002 local derby {{defeat of}} Aston Villa. He also scored in the return fixture at Villa Park, an eventful game in which he ended up keeping goal when Nico Vaesen was injured after Birmingham had used all their substitutes. Horsfield missed games through {{suspension}} and surgery, and was frustrated by manager Steve Bruce preferring to use him as a specialist substitute; after he came on to score a late winner against local rivals West Bromwich Albion, Bruce described him as [...] "a manager's dream", saying that [...] "when you're tiring, the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> need is Big Horse rampaging at you". Starting alongside World Cup-winner Christophe Dugarry late in the season, the pair formed [...] "an unlikely combination, brilliance from Bordeaux alongside a brickie from Barnsley, but Horsfield's robust approach has complemented Dugarry's more delicate touches"; their partnership produced four wins and a draw from the last six games.|$|E
5000|$|In 1853, James Poole, {{editor of}} The Carleton Place Herald, {{wrote about the}} Chats Falls horse railway: [...] "Certainly {{this is one of}} the <b>last</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> dare to hope for in the heart of the {{wilderness}} far away from either a road or a cow-path - and you must almost doubt whether it is a reality, or like the palace of Aladdin, you are not under the mysterious influence of some kind genii for your present position." ...|$|R

500|$|Also in 2014, Michael Stevens of the YouTube channel Vsauce devoted {{time to the}} {{discussion}} of irony in the episode [...] "Dord". In this video, Stevens considers {{the difference between the}} typically cited [...] "situational" [...] irony, versus [...] "dramatic" [...] irony. According to him, the irony of the song may not necessarily be in the situations themselves, but rather in the dramatic irony – when someone is unaware of the significance of the event while others are. The situations aren't ironic themselves, but life itself is ironic. It is a song about [...] "the difference between what life knows we need, and what life thinks we need. What's ironic is not 10,000 spoons when {{all you need is a}} knife, it's the fact that, as Alanis believes, you have all of those spoons because, unbeknownst to you, but known by life, what you really need right now is only spoons... or the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> need right now is a knife." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 2015, Smith {{was cast}} in the [...] "major {{recurring}} role" [...] of Masters for the second season, having previously worked with Butters and Fazekas on their television series Resurrection. Though the executive producers never thought {{that they would be}} able to get Smith for the series, they developed and wrote Masters with the actor in mind. The character was intended to be killed off at the end of the season, and a version of that was filmed, but the writers ultimately decided to leave Masters' fate [...] "ambiguous" [...] as they enjoyed working with Smith, with Fazekas saying, [...] "The nice thing about that is we could go both ways on it. Maybe we never see him again or maybe we see him again and by the way he's full of Zero Matter now. The <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> saw was Whitney Zero Mattering him and then getting interrupted. But it's still in him. Either way, we wanted to keep our options open." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics also {{commented on}} the Hackney controversy. Sarah Dean of the UK edition of The Huffington Post said: [...] "If having a blonde, leather-clad superstar brandishing a gun at a shop owner's face isn't glamourising violence, I'm not sure what is" [...] and added that, in essence, the video [...] "seems more like an {{opportunity}} for her to live out her sexual fantasies than anything beneficial to music fans." [...] Amanda Dobbins of New York stated that [...] "After viewing the final product, we're guessing [...] probably won't be down with the shower sex, the regular sex, the domestic abuse, the armed robbery, or any of Britney's other questionable activities, either." [...] Katherine St Asaph of Popdust joked about the situation, saying, [...] "Britney Spears’ video for 'Criminal' is out, and gang recruitment is already up 200% since 8 a.m.! This has not happened." [...] Marianne Garvey of the UK website of E!

In fact, most of us think of cancer as a death sentence. Treatments for cancer make many people feel lousy and {{the side effects of}} treatment include fatigue, anxiety, nausea, vomiting and pain.

500|$|Upon its release, Post {{received}} universal acclaim {{from music}} critics. Lorraine Ali of Rolling Stone praised the album for providing a [...] "much-needed escape route" [...] from the alternative rock offerings {{of the early}} 1990s, and for successfully merging disparate styles. She concluded: [...] "When Post comes to an end, it feels like getting back from a good vacation: the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> {{want to do is}} re-enter the real world". Comparing it to Björk's previous studio album Debut, Slant Magazines Eric Henderson felt Post [...] "upped the ante by plugging listeners into the diverse pop mixtape playing inside her mind". In the end, he argued that it [...] "will likely always remain the Björk album that most successfully sustains her winning balance of experimental whimsy and solid pop magic". Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Jim Farber stated that despite Posts [...] "bizarre" [...] combination of diverse genres, the conviction of Björk's delivery and assuring hooks [...] " [...] her most surreal passages as relatable as moon-June standards". Ultimately, he felt that the singer [...] " [...] that tradition, constructing standards for the cyber age".|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the film, {{the camera}} moves slowly towards a wall in the Overlook and a 1921 photograph, {{revealed}} to include Jack Torrance seen at the middle of a 1921 party. In an interview with Michel Ciment, Kubrick overtly declared that the photograph suggests that Jack was a reincarnation of an earlier official at the hotel. Still, this has not stopped interpreters from developing alternative readings, such as that Jack has been [...] "absorbed" [...] into the Overlook Hotel. Film critic Jonathan Romney, while acknowledging the absorption theory, wroteAs the ghostly butler Grady (Philip Stone) tells him during their chilling confrontation in the men's toilet, 'You're the caretaker, sir. You've always been the caretaker.' Perhaps in some earlier incarnation Jack really was around in 1921, and it's his present-day self that is the shadow, the phantom photographic copy. But if his picture has been there all along, why has no one noticed it? After all, it's right {{at the center of the}} central picture on the wall, and the Torrances have had a painfully drawn-out winter of mind-numbing leisure in which to inspect every corner of the place. Is it just that, like Poe's purloined letter, the thing in plain sight is the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> see? When you do see it, the effect is so unsettling because you realise the unthinkable was there under your nose – overlooked – the whole time.|$|E
2500|$|Chemistry {{was largely}} praised by {{contemporary}} music critics upon its release. Talia Kraines of BBC Music {{decided that the}} album was [...] "quirky, modern and dripping with attitude" [...] and [...] "holds no disappointments." [...] Virgin Media gave the album five stars, saying it was [...] "bursting [...] with invention, quirky lyrics, tongue-in-cheek sauciness and [...] appeals to grown-up pop fans and music critics {{as well as to}} the teenyboppers." [...] Yahoo! Music concurred by declaring that Chemistry was [...] "as devilish and quirky and downright uplifting as anything else released by anyone this year." [...] The Guardian was extremely positive in its review, saying it [...] "spends 45 minutes doing the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> expect it to." [...] The New York Times referred to the album as [...] "endlessly entertaining". In comparison to Girls Aloud's previous albums, Entertainment.ie referred to Chemistry as their [...] "best offering yet [...] overflowing with pop hooks, sassy production and choruses just waiting to take up permanent residence in your head." [...] The Daily Telegraph said that Girls Aloud have [...] "simply got much, much better [...] albums will have to get better in order to survive. It's happened here. Judging by Chemistry, Girls Aloud's songwriters are now working as hard as the band are." [...] MusicOMH said it [...] "achieves the almost impossible in bettering its predecessor." [...] Dom Passantino of Stylus Magazine said he did prefer What Will the Neighbours Say?, but gave Chemistry an A-.|$|E
2500|$|After {{an exhilarating}} flight, Carter arrives at last at the abode of the gods, but finds it empty. Finally a great {{procession}} arrives with much fanfare, {{led by a}} pharaoh-like man who explains to Carter that the gods of earth have seen the city of Carter's dreams and decided to make it their home, and have thus abandoned Kadath. The gods walk no more {{in the ways of}} gods, and have become instead mere denizens of the jewelled city Carter had glimpsed in his dreams. The pharaoh commands Carter to find this city, so that the natural order might be restored. [...] "It is not over unknown seas," [...] he says, [...] "but back over well-known years that your quest must go; back to the bright strange things of infancy and the quick sun-drenched glimpses of magic that old scenes brought to wide young eyes.

6000|$|... § 14. Then {{study the}} bit of Turner work: note first its quietness, unattractiveness, {{apparent}} carelessness whether {{you look at it}} or not; next note the subtle curvatures within the narrowest limits, and, when it branches, the unexpected, out of the way things it does, just what nobody could have thought of its doing; shooting out like a letter Y, with a nearly straight branch, and then correcting its stiffness with a zigzag behind, so that the boughs, ugly individually, are beautiful in unison. (In what I have hereafter to say about trees, I shall need to dwell much on this character of unexpectedness. A bough is never drawn rightly if it is not wayward, so that although, as just now said, quiet at first, not caring to be looked at, the moment it is looked at, it seems bent on astonishing you, and doing the <b>last</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> expect it to do.) But our present purpose is only to note the finish of the Turner curves, which, though they seem straight and stiff at first, are, when you look long, seen to be all tremulous, perpetually wavering along every edge into endless melody of change.
