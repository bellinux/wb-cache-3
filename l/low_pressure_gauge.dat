40|$|Over 500 <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges</b> {{were needed}} for {{monitoring}} of total pressures in the {{ultra-high vacuum system}} of the CERN Intersecting Storage Rings for protons (ISR). For analysis of the gas composition 30 residual gas analysers were required. About 200 total <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges</b> of different types were included to {{provide detailed information on}} the pressures during the rough pumping process. The technical specifications for the different instruments are discussed. Some difficulties, which limited the performance at an early stage are treated. Results of the acceptance tests on instruments delivered to CERN are presented. Procedures for total and partial pressure measurements in the ISR are reviewed. The performance of the instruments after final installation is discussed. (7 refs) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Vacuum system set-up is {{presented}} {{and used for}} calibration of <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges</b> {{in the region of}} rough vacuum, from 103 mbar to 10 - 1 mbar, with dry air. The capacitance manometer is used for the calibration of piezoresistant manometer, oil, mercury and mercury micrometers U manometers. The applicability of the experimental set-up and obtained results for the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges</b> calibration in the medium and high vacuum region is approved. It was shown how calibration of some cheaper <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges</b> might be performed and reliable measurements of the pressure may be made in the region that is of interest for atomic and molecular collision physics and low-pressure gas discharges. It was also shown that mentioned calibration procedure could be used for calibration of different U manometer types in order to renormalize older atomic and molecular collision data.

50|$|Measurement of {{high vacuum}} is done using a nonabsolute gauge that {{measures}} a pressure-related {{property of the}} vacuum, for example, its thermal conductivity. See, for example, Pacey. These gauges must be calibrated. The gauges capable of measuring the <b>lowest</b> <b>pressures</b> are magnetic <b>gauges</b> based upon the pressure dependence of the current in a spontaneous gas discharge in intersecting electric and magnetic fields.|$|R

50|$|This term {{can cause}} confusion.

5000|$|Indian Creek Designs {{also made}} a variant of this marker known as the Lasoya Promaster. The Lasoya version has {{slightly}} different milling which is more simplistic and comes in a dust finish two tone fade colour. The aggressive [...] "tail" [...] has been removed, perhaps to decrease {{the weight of the}} marker. The high pressure regulator is different from the standard ProMaster. It is a clone of the well-known Air America Vigilante regulator. Instead of the standard ProMaster blade trigger, a new trigger with two finger groves has been added. The bolt is also different as it is made of teflon, instead of delrin and has a small [...] "ramp" [...] on the top to reduce ball breakage. It also comes with a <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> regulator <b>gauge</b> so the user can see exactly what the LPR is set at. Another change from the regular ProMaster is the feed neck. While it is still not a clamping feed neck, it has a lower profile, resulting in less hopper hits. The board in the Lasoya Promaster was made by Kila products for ICD and is a less adjustable version of their ProMaster Drive board. Hence it has been nicknamed the [...] "Kila Lite" [...] board. It features more firing modes than the original ProMaster board and an adjustable [...] "debounce" [...] setting.|$|R

A 20 ft (1.86 m) deep <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> consolidation grout curtain was installed on the upstream side of the dame and extending into both abutments to improve {{the strength of the}} rock under the dam and prevent leaks.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the use of a new actuator, called Pleated Pneumatic Artificial Muscle, in a one {{dimensional}} set-up, it is build as a footless leg with only the knee powered by a pair of Pleated Pneumatic Artificial Muscles. The main goal of this study is the evaluation of the adaptable passive behaviour of these Artificial Muscles in a leg, which can be exploited for an energy efficient way of walking for legged robots. The new actuator and its specific advantages for the use in legged robots will be discussed as well as the concept of the one dimensional set-up. It will be shown that a large amount of energy during a jump can be recuperated and continuous jumping can easily be achieved with <b>low</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>pressures.</b> ...|$|R

50|$|Oxy-fuel welding {{and cutting}} {{processes}} require gases at specific pressures, and regulators will generally {{be used to}} reduce the high pressures of storage cylinders to those usable for cutting and welding. Oxy-gas regulators usually have two stages: The first stage of the regulator releases the gas at a constant rate from the cylinder despite the pressure in the cylinder becoming less as the gas is released. The second stage of the regulator controls the pressure reduction from the intermediate <b>pressure</b> to <b>low</b> <b>pressure.</b> It is constant flow. The valve assembly has two <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges,</b> one indicating cylinder pressure, the other indicating hose pressure.|$|R

40|$|The valve and the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> {{of a gas}} {{ion laser}} were {{electrically}} insulated from the laser discharge path by connecting them in series with the cathode of the laser. The laser cathode can be grounded and preferably is a cold cathode although a hot cathode may be used instead. The cold cathode was provided with a central aperture to which was connected both the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> and the gas pressure reservoir through the valve.

50|$|When the {{gas in the}} {{cylinder}} {{is to be used}} at <b>low</b> <b>pressure,</b> the cap is taken off and a pressure-regulating assembly is attached to the stop valve. This attachment typically has a pressure regulator with upstream (inlet) and downstream (outlet) <b>pressure</b> <b>gauges</b> and a further downstream needle valve and outlet connection. For gases that remain gaseous under ambient storage conditions, the upstream <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> can be used to estimate how much gas is left in {{the cylinder}} according to pressure. For gases that are liquid under storage, e.g., propane, the outlet pressure is dependent on the vapor pressure of the gas, and does not fall until the cylinder is nearly exhausted although it will vary according to the temperature of the cylinder contents. The regulator is adjusted to control the downstream pressure, which will limit the maximum flow of gas out of the cylinder at the pressure shown by the downstream gauge. The outlet connection is attached to whatever needs the gas supply, such as a balloon for example. For some purposes, such as welding, the regulator will also have a flowmeter on the downstream side.|$|R
