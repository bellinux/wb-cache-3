2500|$|Speedcuffs {{consist of}} two {{conventional}} ratchet handcuffs {{connected by a}} rigid metal bar, which is enclosed in a plastic grip secured with bolts. Removal of the grip offers no advantage to escape, as it is only present to facilitate the comfortable manipulation of the cuffs by the arresting officer. Weighing 390 g (13.75 oz) and with a maximum dilation of 23.2 cm (9.13 inches), the speedcuffs are slightly larger than the chain-linked and hinged handcuffs previously manufactured by Hiatts, and accommodate a greater range of wrist sizes. They feature Hiatt's 'back loading' feature, which allows the ratchet to be pulled backwards for a few [...] "clicks" [...] through the <b>lock</b> <b>casing</b> to set the cuffs in the ideal position for quick application. The locks accept a standard handcuff key, and have a double locking facility which is activated through a small pin {{on the back of}} the cuff. The double locking facility must be depressed with a pointed object, such as the protrusion found on the top of the handcuff key; double locking prevents accidentally or knowingly tightening the cuff once it has been locked, helping to prevent paralysis or other injury.|$|E

50|$|Charles Kendrick {{took over}} as Chief Executive after making a sizable {{investment}} in the company, and served as Chief through his retirement in 1969. During World War II, Schlage <b>Lock</b> manufactured shell <b>casings</b> and bomb rail fuses. After the war, the company supplied lock hardware to the Pan Am Building (1964) and the Bank of America Headquarters (1969) skyscrapers. The company was also busy post-war acquiring smaller hardware manufacturers, including the California Lock Company, Peabody Company, LCN Closers, the Von Duprin Factory, and the General Lock Company (Pontiac, Michigan). In 1974, the year the company was acquired by Ingersoll Rand, Schlage employed 1,600 and was the largest manufacturer in San Francisco. Schlage had just completed a move from the Old Office building to a three-story New Office located nearby, {{at the corner of}} Bayshore and Leland. Schlage remained an Ingersoll Rand subsidiary for nearly 40 years, until Schlage and other security hardware companies were spun off as part of Allegion, formed in December 2013.|$|R
40|$|This {{project was}} carried out at Sandvik Coromant in Sandviken. The {{objective}} was to investigate how the machining dynamics was influences by the workpiece and different positions of the fixtures. The project consisted of two parts: investigation of one simple beam model to gain {{knowledge and understanding of}} the problem and secondly: study of alternative clamping positions for a jet engine turbine exhaust case. For both cases natural frequencies, mode shapes, frequency response functions and machining stability was investigated. For the beam model the natural frequency changes resulting from machining were found to have specific patterns which were dependent on the boundary conditions. The changing natural frequencies were reflected on to the stability lobes. In order to maximize the production rate the spindle speed should be altered to natural frequencies changes. The natural frequencies can change considerably when the beam cross section is machined down. The mode shapes of the beam is however fairly unchanged. This makes it possible to choose a good position of an additional support based on knowledge of the original beam. A position of an additional support at a node point for a particular mode maximizes the natural frequency for the mode one number lower. A position of the support near the middle of the beam minimizes the highest flexibility that occurs and also maximizes the first natural frequency for a prismatic beam. For the jet engine casing six lower and six upper clamping sections with a 30 degree phase shift was found to have both the highest first natural frequencies and the highest machining stability limits of the investigates cases. <b>Locking</b> the <b>casing</b> in three symmetrically positioned sections of its lower flange gives the lowest first natural frequencies, of the investigated cases, followed by six sections and twelve sections.
