Humans get leptospirosis and toxoplasmosis through contact with an environment contaminated with <b>Leptospira</b> <b>bacteria</b> and Toxoplasma protozoa from reservoir hosts, which are rodents and cats, respectively. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the prevalence of Leptospira and Toxoplasma infections in rodents and shrews in Mikese area of Morogoro Rural District in eastern Tanzania. A total of 89 rodents and one shrew from cultivated and fallow land were tested for leptospirosis using six Leptospira serovars: Sokoine, Kenya, Canicola, Lora, Hebdomadis and Pomona. Toxoplasmosis was determined in 46 rodents brain smears. The prevalence of leptospirosis was 25. 8 %, and Leptospira serovar Sokoine was the most prevalent serovar (16. 9 %). Toxoplasma was detected in one rodent (2. 17 %) individual while three rodent individuals had Toxoplasma-like parasites hence were considered suspect positive.

40|$|Background: Leptospirosis is a re-emerging {{zoonotic}} infection. It occurs worldwide but is {{more common}} in temperate and tropical areas of the world. Infection is transmitted primarily through contact with water contaminated with the urine of infected animals, either through ingestion of water or by direct contact with mucosal membranes or abraded skin. Control of infection in livestock and pets reduces the risk of human disease, but the existence of wildlife reservoirs complicates prevention. <b>Leptospira</b> <b>bacteria</b> are maintained in nature by chronically infected reservoir hosts. While our knowledge of the local epidemiology is incomplete, the literature suggests that different animals are reservoirs for different Leptospira serovars: rodents, pigs and horses for Bratislava; rats for Icterohaemorrhagiae; and raccoons for Autumnalis. Recent evidence suggests that seroreactivity to Autumnalis may actually represent cross-reactivity to other serovars. In a 2006 serosurvey of healthy dogs (n = 158) from 15 local health jurisdictions in Washington State, 17 % had serological evidence of exposure to one or more leptospira serovars. 1 The most frequently detected serovars were Autumnalis, Icterohaemorrhagiae, and Canicola.

40|$|Introduction. Leptospirosis is {{an acute}} {{zoonotic}} infection, caused by spirochetes {{of the genus}} Leptospira. It is characterized by extensive vasculitis. It is usually transmitted indirectly, per contaminated water, rarely directly, through contact with infected animals. <b>Leptospira</b> <b>bacteria</b> commonly enter the body through damaged skin or mucous membranes. The clinical syndromes may vary from a subclinical infection and mild febrile condition to severe clinical symptoms with jaundice and renal failure. Case report. This is a case report of a patient with leptospirosis (Weil's disease) whose clinical manifestations included: icterus, renal failure, hemorrhagic syndrome and disturbances of consciousness. After the use of antibiotics, symptomatic and substitution therapy, all symptoms resolved completely. However, in our patient, hemodialysis was necessary due to renal failure, as a palliative measure. Discussion. Weil’s syndrome is a severe form of leptospirosis, which can be fatal. Early clinical diagnosis of the disease, as well as serologic verification of infection, are very important prerequisites, followed by antibiotic and other symptomatic therapy, as soon as possible. Conclusion. This is a case report of a patient with rare clinical manifestations of leptosirosis. Although presenting with severe symptoms, thanks to palliative therapeutic measures, complete and fast recovery was achieved.

40|$|Leptospirosis is {{a global}} public health problem, {{primarily}} in the tropical developing world. The pathogenic mechanisms of the causative agents, {{several members of the}} genus Leptospira, have been underinvestigated. The exception to this trend has been the demonstration of the binding of pathogenic leptospires to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and its components. In this work, interactions of <b>Leptospira</b> interrogans <b>bacteria</b> with mammalian cells, rather than the ECM, were examined. The bacteria bound more efficiently to the cells than to the ECM, and a portion of this cell-binding activity was attributable to attachment to glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains of proteoglycans (PGs). Chondroitin sulfate B PGs appeared to be the primary targets of L. interrogans attachment, while heparan sulfate PGs were much less important. Inhibition of GAG/PG-mediated attachment resulted in partial inhibition of bacterial attachment, suggesting that additional receptors for L. interrogans await identification. GAG binding may participate in the pathogenesis of leptospirosis within the host animal. In addition, because GAGs are expressed on the luminal aspects of epithelial cells in the proximal tubules of the kidneys, this activity {{may play a role in}} targeting the bacteria to this critical site. Because GAGs are shed in the urine, GAG binding may also be important for transmission to new hosts through the environment...|$|R
40|$|Leptospirosis {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{zoonotic}} diseases in the world, resulting in high morbidity and mortality in humans and affecting global livestock production. Most infections are caused by either Leptospira borgpetersenii or <b>Leptospira</b> interrogans, <b>bacteria</b> that vary in their distribution in nature and rely on different modes of transmission. We report the complete genomic sequences of two strains of L. borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo that have distinct phenotypes and virulence. These two strains have nearly identical genetic content, with subtle frameshift and point mutations being a common form of genetic variation. Starkly limited regions of synteny are shared between the large chromosomes of L. borgpetersenii and L. interrogans, probably the result of frequent recombination events between insertion sequences. The L. borgpetersenii genome is ≈ 700 kb smaller and has a lower coding density than L. interrogans, indicating it is decaying through a process of insertion sequence-mediated genome reduction. Loss of gene function is not random but is centered on impairment of environmental sensing and metabolite transport and utilization. These features distinguish L. borgpetersenii from L. interrogans, a species with minimal genetic decay and that survives extended passage in aquatic environments encountering a mammalian host. We conclude that L. borgpetersenii is evolving toward dependence on a strict host-to-host transmission cycle...|$|R
40|$|Pathogenic Leptospira {{species are}} the {{etiological}} agents of leptospirosis, a widespread disease {{of human and}} veterinary concern. In this study, we report that Leptospira species are capable of binding plasminogen (PLG) in vitro. The binding to the leptospiral surface was demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy with living bacteria. The PLG binding to the bacteria seems to occur via lysine residues because the ligation is inhibited by addition of the lysine analog 6 -aminocaproic acid. Exog-enously provided urokinase-type PLG activator (uPA) converts surface-bound PLG into enzymatically active plasmin, as evaluated by the reaction with the chromogenic plasmin substrate D-Val–Leu–Lys 4 –nitroanilide dihydrochloridein. The PLG activation system {{on the surface of}} Leptospira is PLG dose dependent and does not cause injury to the organism, as cellular growth in culture was not impaired. The generation of active plasmin within Leptospira was observed with several nonvirulent high-passage strains and with the nonpathogenic saprophytic organism Leptospira biflexa.

40|$|Bats are {{reservoirs}} {{for several}} zoonotic pathogens of medical importance; however, infection dynamics of pathogens in wild bat populations remain poorly understood. Here, {{we examine the}} influence of host crowding and population age structure on pathogen transmission and diversity in bat populations. Focusing on two pathogen taxa of medical importance, <b>Leptospira</b> <b>bacteria</b> and paramyxoviruses, we monitored host population and pathogen shedding dynamics within a maternity colony of the tropical bat species Mormopterus francoismoutoui, endemic to Reunion Island. Our data reveal astonishingly similar infection dynamics for Leptospira and paramyxoviruses, with infection peaks during late pregnancy and 2 months after the initial birth pulse. Furthermore, although co-infection occurs frequently during the peaks of transmission, the patterns do not suggest any interaction between the two pathogens. Partial sequencing reveals a unique bat-specific Leptospira strain contrasting with the co-circulation of four separate paramyxovirus lineages along the whole breeding period. Patterns of infection highlight the importance of host crowding in pathogen transmission and suggest that most bats developed immune response and stop excreting pathogens.

What DoWe Know, Briefly, about Leptospirosis and Leptospira? Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease of humans and animals caused by pathogenic spirochetes of the genus Leptospira. In humans, leptospirosis is an important (re-) emerging zoonosis of global public health concern [1], although tropical regions display the highest human incidence [2]. Over 500, 000 human cases of severe leptospirosis are thought to occur each year worldwide, with a mortality rate of over 10 %. Asymptomatic or subclinical human infections are common, making leptospirosis likely far more prevalent than currently diagnosed or recognized [3]. Leptospira are a complex of highly diversified bacteria comprising 22 species that include pathogenic (Leptospira interrogans, L. kirschneri, L. borgpetersenii, L. mayottensis, L. santaro-sai, L. noguchii, L. weilii, L. alexanderi, L. kmetyi, and L. alstonii), intermediate (i. e., species o...|$|E

Previous work showed that a human THP- 1 cell line recognized heat-killed leptospires and leptospiral LPS through TLR 2 instead of TLR 4.

Methodology/Principal Findings: We investigated the host response and killing of virulent and non-virulent Leptospira of different serovars by human THP- 1 cells, human PBMC’s and human whole blood. Virulence of each leptospiral strain was tested in a well accepted standard guinea pig model. Virulent leptospires displayed complement resistance in human serum and whole blood while in-vitro attenuated non-virulent leptospires were rapidly killed in a complement dependent manner. In vitro stimulation of THP- 1 and PBMC’s with heat-killed and living leptospires showed differential serovar and cell type dependence of cytokine induction.

40|$|Limited {{research}} has been conducted on the role of transcriptional regulators in relation to virulence in Leptospira interrogans, the etiological agent of leptospirosis. Here, we identify an L. interrogans locus that encodes a sensor protein, an anti-sigma factor antagonist, and two genes encoding proteins of unknown function. Transposon insertion into the gene encoding the sensor pro-tein led to dampened transcription of the other 3 genes in this locus. This lb 139 insertion mutant (the lb 139 mutant) displayed attenuated virulence in the hamster model of infection and reduced motility in vitro. Whole-transcriptome analyses using RNA sequencing revealed the downregulation of 115 genes and the upregulation of 28 genes, with an overrepresentation of gene prod-ucts functioning in motility and signal transduction and numerous gene products with unknown functions, predicted to be lo-calized to the extracellular space. Another significant finding encompassed suppressed expression {{of the majority of the}} genes previously demonstrated to be upregulated at physiological osmolarity, including the sphingomyelinase C precursor Sph 2 and LigB. We provide insight into a possible requirement for transcriptional regulation as it relates to leptospiral virulence and sug-gest various biological processes that are affected due to the loss of native expression of this genetic locus. The genus Leptospira consists of both saprophytic and patho-genic species, with the latter being the causative agents of lep-tospirosis. <b>Leptospira</b> <b>bacteria</b> are capable of infecting numerous mammals and have been detected in animals and humans on all continents, with the exception of Antarctica (1).

40|$|The {{survival}} of many microorganisms, like <b>Leptospira</b> or Spiroplasma <b>bacteria,</b> {{can depend on}} their ability to navigate towards regions of favorable viscosity. While this ability, called viscotaxis, has been observed in several bacterial experiments, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we provide a framework to study viscotaxis of self-propelled swimmers in slowly varying viscosity fields and show that suitable body shapes create viscotaxis based on a systematic asymmetry of viscous forces acting on a microswimmer. Our results shed new light on viscotaxis in Spiroplasma and Leptospira and suggest that dynamic body shape changes exhibited by both types of microorganisms may have an unrecognized functionality: to prevent them from drifting to low viscosity regions where they swim poorly. The present theory classifies microswimmers regarding their ability to show viscotaxis and can be used to design synthetic viscotactic swimmers, e. g. for delivering drugs to a target region distinguished by viscosity...|$|R
40|$|The {{study on}} the {{histological}} structure of Rattus tanezumi liver infected by Leptospira spp was conducted. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the change of hepar tissue structure of R. tanezumi due to the patogenikity of <b>Leptospira</b> spp <b>bacteria.</b> The rats were collected from Miroto region, Central Semarang District, Semarang Municipality. R. tanezumi were caught and their hepar were taken, then histological preparat were made using paraffin and HE staining method. The data were collected qualitatively and then analyzed descriptively by describing histological hepar appearance of R. tanezumi which were infected by Leptospira spp. The results of this research show that 8 individuals of R. tanezumi caught and 2 induvidual infected by Leptospira spp. The results of R. tanezumi histological hepar examination which were infected by Leptospira spp. show fat degeneration in part of hepar cell.

2500|$|Like most <b>bacteria,</b> <b>Leptospira</b> require iron for growth. [...] L. interrogans and L. biflexa {{have the}} ability to acquire iron in {{different}} forms. [...] A TonB-dependent receptor required for utilization of the ferrous form of the iron has been identified in L. biflexa, and an ortholog of the receptor is encoded in the genome of L. interrogans. [...] L. interrogans can also obtain iron from heme, which is bound to most of the iron in the human body. [...] The HbpA hemin-binding protein, which may be involved in the uptake of hemin, has been identified on the surface of L. interrogans [...] Although other pathogenic species of Leptospira and L. biflexa lack HbpA, yet another hemin-binding protein, LipL41, may account for their ability to use hemin as a source of iron. [...] Although they do not secrete siderophores, L. biflexa and L. interrogans may be capable of obtaining iron from siderophores secreted by other microorganisms.|$|R
