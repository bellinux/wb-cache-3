40|$|Research on indoor {{navigation}} models mainly {{focuses on}} geometric and <b>logical</b> <b>models.</b> The models are enriched with specific semantic information which supports localisation, navigation and guidance. Geometric models {{provide information about}} the structural (physical) distribution of spaces in a building, while <b>logical</b> <b>models</b> indicate relationships (connectivity and adjacency) between the spaces. In many cases geometric models contain virtual subdivisions to identify smaller spaces which are of interest for navigation (e. g. reception area) or make use of different semantics. The geometric models are used as basis to automatically derive <b>logical</b> <b>models.</b> However, there is seldom reported research on how to automatically realize such geometric models from existing building data (as floor plans) or indoor standards (CityGML LOD 4 or IFC). In this paper, we present our experiments on automatic creation of <b>logical</b> <b>models</b> from floor plans and CityGML LOD 4. For the creation we adopt the Indoor Spatial Navigation Model (INSM) which is specifically designed to support indoor navigation. The semantic concepts in INSM differ from daily used notations of indoor spaces such as rooms and corridors but they facilitate automatic creation of <b>logical</b> <b>models.</b> OTB ResearchOTB Research Institute for the Built Environmen...|$|R

2500|$|Webern's music {{began to}} be {{performed}} more widely in the 1920s; by the mid-1940s, its effect was decisive on many composers, even as far-flung as John Cage. In part because Webern had largely remained the most obscure and arcane composer of the Second Viennese School during his own lifetime, interest in Webern's music increased after World War II as it came to represent a universally or generally valid, systematic, and compellingly <b>logical</b> <b>model</b> of new composition, with his œuvre acquiring what Alex Ross calls [...] "a saintly, visionary aura". When Webern’s Piano Variations were performed at Darmstadt in 1948, young composers listened in a quasi-religious trance. In 1955, the second issue of Eimert and Stockhausen's journal Die Reihe was devoted to Webern's œuvre, and in 1960 his lectures were published by Universal Edition.|$|E

40|$|The {{identification}} of large regulatory and signalling networks {{involved in the}} control of crucial cellular processes calls for proper modelling approaches. Indeed, models can help elucidate properties of these networks, understand their behaviour and provide (testable) predictions by performing in silico experiments. In this context, qualitative, logical frameworks have emerged as relevant approaches, as demonstrated by {{a growing number of}} published models, along with new methodologies and software tools. This productive activity now requires a concerted effort to ensure model reusability and interoperability between tools.

40|$|Data models {{provide a}} map of the {{components}} of an information system. Prior research has indicated that more expressive conceptual data models (despite their increased size) result in better performance for problem solving tasks. An initial experiment using <b>logical</b> data <b>models</b> indicated that more expressive <b>logical</b> data <b>models</b> also enhanced end-user performance for information retrieval tasks. However, the principles of parsimony and bounded rationality imply that, past some point, increases in size lead to a level of complexity that results in impaired performance. The results of this study support these principles. For a <b>logical</b> data <b>model</b> of increased but still modest size, users composing queries for the more expressive <b>logical</b> data <b>model</b> did not perform as well as users composing queries for the corresponding less expressive but more parsimonious <b>logical</b> data <b>model.</b> These results indicate that, when constructing <b>logical</b> data <b>models,</b> data modelers should consider tradeoffs between parsimony and expressiveness...|$|R

40|$|We here {{expand on}} a {{previous}} paper concerning the role of logic in information retrieval (IR) modelling. In that paper, among other things, we had pointed out how di#erent ways of understanding the contribution of logic to IR have sprung from the (always unstated) adherence to either the total or the partial knowledge assumption. Here we make our analysis more precise by relating this dichotomy {{to the notion of}} vividness, as used in knowledge representation, and to another dichotomy which has had a profound influence in database theory, namely the distinction between the proof-theoretic and the model-theoretic views of a database, spelled out by Reiter in his "logical reconstruction of database theory". We show that precisely the same distinction can be applied to <b>logical</b> <b>models</b> of IR developed so far. The strengths and weaknesses of the adoption of either approach in <b>logical</b> <b>models</b> of IR are discussed. 1 Introduction <b>Logical</b> <b>models</b> of information retrieval have been acti [...] ...|$|R

We describe mechanisms for combining programs, possibly in different languages, from separate components and outline an operational semantics for programmed evolvable systems.
