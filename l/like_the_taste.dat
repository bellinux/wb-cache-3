5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, great white sharks do not mistake humans for seals. Many bite {{incidents}} occur in waters with low visibility or other situations which impair the shark's senses. The species appears to not <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>taste</b> of humans, {{or at least}} finds the taste unfamiliar. Further research shows that they can tell in one bite {{whether or not the}} object is worth predating upon. Humans, for the most part, are too bony for their liking. They much prefer a fat, protein-rich seal.|$|E

50|$|Sources differ {{about the}} {{earliest}} origin of nattō. One {{theory is that}} nattō was codeveloped in multiple locations in the distant past, since it is simple to make with ingredients and tools commonly available in Japan since ancient times. There is also the story about Minamoto no Yoshiie who was on a battle campaign in northeastern Japan between 1086 AD and 1088 AD when one day they were attacked while boiling soybeans for their horses. They hurriedly packed up the beans, and did not open the straw bags until a few days later, by which time the beans had fermented. The soldiers ate it anyway, and <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>taste,</b> so they offered some to Yoshiie, who also <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>taste.</b> It is even possible that the product was discovered independently at different times.|$|R

2500|$|When Glen A. Larson {{claimed that}} it was Coon who had rewritten the {{original}} script {{and it was this}} version that was submitted to the Writer's Guild, Ellison said that [...] "pandas will fly out of Glen Larson's ass!". He explained that as the credited writer, he had the option of which version of the script to submit to the Guild. A further claim was made by writer Don Ingalls, who said that Ellison had admitted in a drunken stupor to him late one night in a bar that he had tidied up and improved the script further prior to submitting it; this was then published in Justman and Solow's Inside Star Trek: The Real Story. Ellison repudiated Ingalls' claim, pointing out that he never drank since he did not <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>taste</b> and had never been drunk and so this could not have occurred. Upon being informed, Solow promised to add a note refuting the claim in a future paperback edition, but then decided to agree with Ingalls version of the story.|$|E
