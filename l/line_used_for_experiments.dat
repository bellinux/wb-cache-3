40|$|Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV- 1) is the {{etiologic}} agent of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). In Japan, {{the number of}} HTLV- 1 carriers {{is estimated to be}} 1. 2 million and more than 700 cases of ATL have been diagnosed every year. Considering the poor prognosis and lack of curative therapy of ATL, it seems mandatory to establish an effective strategy for the treatment of ATL. In this study, we attempted to identify the cell surface molecules that will become suitable targets of antibodies for anti-ATL therapy. The expression levels of approximately 40, 000 host genes of three human T-cell lines carrying HTLV- 1 genomes were analyzed by oligonucleotide microarray and compared with the expression levels of the genes in an HTLV- 1 -negative T-cell line. The HTLV- 1 -carrying T-cell <b>lines</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>experiments</b> had totally different expression patterns of viral genome. Among the genes evaluated, the expression levels of 108 genes were found to be enhanced more than 10 -fold in all of the T-cell lines examined and 11 of the 108 genes were considered to generate the proteins expressed on the cell surface. In particular, the CD 70 gene was upregulated more than 1, 000 -fold and the enhanced expression of the CD 70 molecule was confirmed by laser flow cytometry for various HTLV- 1 -carrying T-cell lines and primary CD 4 + T cells isolated from acute-type ATL patients. Such expression was not observed for primary CD 4 + T cells isolated from healthy donors. Since CD 70 expression is strictly restricted in normal tissues, such as highly activated T and B cells, CD 70 appears to be a potential target for effective antibody therapy against ATL...|$|R

In previous experiments both compounds showed good in vitro antiproliferative, cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic activities against cell lines of different histologic origin.

Although the actual mechanism of this cross-resistance {{has not yet been}} definitively elucidated, our results from immunostaining of microtubules suggest that it may be linked to the presence of a shared target site for taxol and 2 -Naph-DNB on microtubules...|$|R

40|$|We have {{conducted}} a phenotypic and functional analysis of 19 cloned cell lines generated after allogeneic stimulation of circulating lymphocytes from a normal human fetus aged 25 wk. Using a limited series of mAbs (Anti-T 3, WT 31, T 4, T 8, and NKH 1 A), cloned cells {{were found to}} fall in three groups. Three clones have a conventional "inducer" phenotype. Three clones have a phenotype (T 3 +, WT 31 +, T 8 +, and NKH 1 A+) {{similar to that of}} certain NK active mature T lymphocytes present in adult peripheral blood. In contrast, 13 cell lines display surface characteristics that have not been described previously. Indeed, they express T 3 proteins but not the WT 31 determinant. In light of previous studies, these results show that WT 31 mAb is a unique reagent directed at an invariant epitope of the human T cell receptor that is not present on all circulating T 3 + fetal lymphocytes. Functionally the T 3 +, WT 31 +, and NKH 1 A+ clones were found to kill immunizing LAZ 388 cells, as well as K 562, while T 3 +, WT 31 - and NKH 1 A+ clones display NK-like function exclusively. Moreover, only WT 31 + lymphocytes present in the cell <b>line</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> cloning <b>experiments</b> have the capacity to recognize alloantigen-bearing cells.

40|$|The {{induction}} {{and selection}} of valine-resistant mutants from haploid tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) mesophyll protoplast-derived cells have been studied. Using cells from an original mutant plant obtained previously, we performed reconstruction experiments {{in order to}} determine the best conditions for the recovery of resistant cells among a population of sensitive cells. Optimal selective conditions were shown to depend on various factors including cell density, time of addition of valine and seasonal variations affecting the mother plants. —Using cell densities of approximately 10 4 cells/ml, we defined efficient selective conditions: more than 25 % of the putative mutant clones selected from UV-mutagenized protoplasts were reproducibly confirmed to be valine resistant. Further characterization of some regenerated mutant plants indicated that valine-resistance was associated with an uptake deficiency, as in the case of the original mutant plant of the Valr- 2 <b>line</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> reconstruction <b>experiments.</b> Spontaneous mutation rates for valine-resistance were below accurately detectable levels, i. e., less than 10 - 6 per cell per generation. Induced mutation frequency varied nonlinearily with UV dose from 10 - 5 to 5 x 10 - 4 resistant clones per surviving colony. Two independent loci (vr 2 and vr 3) were previously shown to be involved in valine-resistance due to amino acid uptake deficiency. Haploid tobacco plants were produced through anther culture from an F 1 double-heterozygous plant obtained from a cross between the original mutant plant and a wild-type plant. Study of the level of resistance to valine of protoplast-derived cells allowed the classification of these haploid plants in four types: sensitive, resistant and two intermediary resistant types believed to result from the presence of a mutant allele at only one of the two loci involved. The frequencies of UV-induced mutations in cells derived from haploid plants of one of the intermediary types were compared to those observed in wild-type cells. The results are considered in light of the amphidiploid structure of the tobacco genome...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Single-cell level {{studies are}} being used {{increasingly}} to measure cell properties not directly observable in a cell population. High-performance data acquisition systems for such studies have, by necessity, developed in synchrony. However, improvements in sample purification techniques are also required to reveal new phenomena. Here we assessed a cell sorter as a sample-pretreatment tool for a single-cell level assay. A cell sorter is routinely <b>used</b> <b>for</b> selecting one type of cells from a heterogeneous mixture of cells using specific fluorescence labels. In this case, we wanted to select cells of exactly the same size, shape, and cell-cycle stage from a population, without using a specific fluorescence label. Results We used four light scatter parameters: the peak height and area of the forward scatter (FSheight and FSarea) and side scatter (SSheight and SSarea). The rat pheochromocytoma PC 12 cell line, a neuronal cell <b>line,</b> was <b>used</b> <b>for</b> all <b>experiments.</b> The living cells concentrated in the high FSarea and middle SSheight/SSarea fractions. Single cells without cell clumps were concentrated in the low SS and middle FS fractions, and in the higher FSheight/FSarea and SSheight/SSarea fractions. The cell populations from these viable, single-cell-rich fractions were divided into twelve subfractions based on their FSarea-SSarea profiles, for more detailed analysis. We found that SSarea was proportional to the cell volume and the FSarea correlated with cell roundness and elongation, {{as well as with}} the level of DNA in the cell. To test the method and to characterize the basic properties of the isolated single cells, sorted cells were cultured in separate wells. The cells in all subfractions survived, proliferated and differentiated normally, suggesting that there was no serious damage. The smallest, roundest, and smoothest cells had the highest viability. There was no correlation between proliferation and differentiation. NGF increases cell viability but decreases the proliferative ability of the PC 12 cells. Conclusion We demonstrated a pretreatment method to collect well-characterized, viable, single cells without using fluorescent labels and without significant damage to the cells. This method is quantitative, rapid, single-step, and yields cells of high purity, making it applicable for a variety of single-cell level analyses. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background. Temozolomide (TMZ) is a methylating {{drug that}} is {{commonly}} used {{in the treatment of}} glioma. Although many features are still unclear, its general mechanism of action is well described. TMZ induces O 6 -methylguanine (O 6 MeG) lesions in DNA, which, in the absence of repair by O 6 -methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT), mispair with thymine and start a futile cycle of repair-resynthesis events. The resultant DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) activate the components of G 2 checkpoint, and cells with a 4 N DNA content accumulate and remain arrested at the G 2 /M boundary for several days. Cell death subsequently occurs by senescence, necrosis, or mitotic catastrophe, while apoptosis has been ruled out in many studies. Moreover, the effect of multiple TMZ treatments on G 2 arrest and apoptosis induction is not clear. Repair of methylating drug-induced DNA lesions requires monoubiquitination of PCNA and FANCD 2. Loss of either protein or inhibition of their monoubiquitination increases drug toxicity. USP 1 is a hydrolase that removes monoubiquitin from PCNA and FANCD 2, and can potentially play a role in TMZ mechanism of action. Materials and methods. U 87, U 251 (TMZ-sensitive, low MGMT), and GBM 8 (TMZ-resistant, high MGMT) cell <b>lines</b> were <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>experiments.</b> The treatment was scheduled with 100 μM TMZ for 3 hours for 1, 2, or 3 consecutive days. Cell cycle progression was studied with both FACS-based analysis and a novel time-lapse microscopic real-time analysis using FUCCI (Fluorescent Ubiquitination-based Cell Cycle Indicator), and apoptosis was measured with FACS-based Annexin V-PI analysis. To address the possible role of USP 1 in TMZ action, we examined expression of USP 1 at the mRNA levels in expression microarray databases derived from primary GBM. We also used siRNA targeting USP 1 to modulate USP 1 expression, and studied the effect of USP 1 downregulation on TMZ-induced G 2 arrest, cell death, and clonogenicity. Results. Compared to single treatment, multiple TMZ treatments cause a significant reduction of clonogenicity in TMZ-sensitive cells and induce a significant increase of apoptosis, particularly in a late stage. However, multiple treatments don’t have any major effect on cell cycle profile. Time-lapse microscopic analysis with FUCCI system showed that TMZ-sensitive glioma cells arrest at the G 2 checkpoint for less than 48 hours and, in the presence of an activated G 2 checkpoint, they replicate their DNA without cellular division, re-enter the cell cycle at the next G 1 phase, and repeat the cycle, ultimately giving rise to polyploid cells. siRNA-mediated suppression of USP 1 had no effect on cell cycle progression or the extent of temozolomide-induced G 2 arrest. However, while USP 1 knockdown alone had minimal effect on cell death, it increased temozolomide-induced loss of clonagenicity both in TMZ-sensitive and TMZ-resistant cells. Further examination of the mechanism of cell death suggested that while control cells, control cells exposed to TMZ, or USP 1 -suppressed cells rarely underwent apoptotic cell death, temozolomide-treated cells in which USP 1 levels were suppressed underwent high rates of apoptosis. Conclusions. The present studies show that TMZ can induce apoptosis in TMZ-sensitive glioma cells, which is visible after 3 days but significant after 7 days. Multiple TMZ treatments don’t affect cell cycle profile, but significantly increase apoptosis. Moreover, time-lapse studies suggest a novel mechanism of action for TMZ, alternative to the one commonly accepted. These results have significant implications for the development of TMZ resistance. Furthermore, rather than sensitizing cells to DNA damaging agents, USP 1 appears to suppress latent apoptotic pathways and to protect cells from temozolomide-induced apoptosis. These results identify a new function for USP 1 and suggest that suppression of USP 1 and/or USP 1 controlled pathway may be a means to enhance the cytotoxic potential of temozolomide and to sensitize TMZ-resistant GBM cell...|$|R
