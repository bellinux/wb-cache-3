5|$|The large {{diversity}} of the flora around Adams is even more apparent in the herbage and, including the tree and shrub species previously mentioned, totals at least 843 species. This is {{more than any other}} mountain in the Pacific Northwest. The first extensive list of flora from the area around Mount Adams was published in 1896 by William Suksdorf and Thomas Howell and listed 480 species. Suksdorf had taken it upon himself to catalogue as many species around Adams as he could and the list was the result of his extraordinary collection efforts. This was the most complete list for over a century and has finally been updated by David Beik and Susan McDougall to the current 843 species with hundreds of additional species listed. Adams is home to many rare plants including tall bugbane, Suksdorf’s monkeyflower, northern microseris (Microceris borealis), Brewer’s potentilla (Potentilla breweri), and mountain blue-eyed grass. The plant diversity is most evident in the many meadows and wetlands on the flanks of Adams. The notable Bird Creek Meadows includes in its famous display, magenta paintbrush, arrowleaf ragwort, penstemons, <b>lupines,</b> monkeyflowers, mountain heathers, and many others. In wetlands, generally at lower elevations, one can find bog blueberry, highbush cranberry, sundew, purple cinquefoil, and flatleaf bladderwort, in addition to many sedges and rushes. Subalpine and alpine meadows and parklands, while not as prolific as the meadows and wetlands of lower elevations, have a beautiful display as well with partrigefoot, Cascade rockcress, subalpine buttercup, Sitka valerian, alpine false candytuft, elegant Jacob’s ladder, and various buckwheats as prominent players.|$|E

40|$|Background: The use of <b>lupine</b> in {{food has}} been {{increasing}} {{during the last decade}} and allergic reactions to <b>lupine</b> have been reported, especially in peanut-allergic patients. The frequency and the degree of cross-reactivity to other legumes are not known. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the frequency of sensitization to <b>lupine,</b> and in addition to pea and soy, and its clinical relevance, in peanutsensitized patients. Furthermore, to determine the eliciting dose (ED) for <b>lupine</b> using double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges (DBPCFC). Methods: Thirty-nine unselected peanut-sensitized patients were evaluated by skin prick tests (SPT) and ImmunoCAP to <b>lupine,</b> pea, and soy. Clinical reactivity was measured by DBPCFC for <b>lupine,</b> and by history for pea and soy. Results: Eighty-two percent of the study population was sensitized to <b>lupine,</b> 55 % to pea, and 87 % to soy. Clinically relevant sensitization to <b>lupine,</b> pea, or soy occurred in 35 %, 29 %, and 33 % respectively of the study population. None of the patients was aware of the use of <b>lupine</b> in food. The lowest ED for <b>lupine,</b> inducing mild subjective symptoms, was 0. 5 mg, and the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was 0. 1 mg. No predictive factors for <b>lupine</b> allergy were found. Conclusion: In peanut-sensitized patients, clinically relevant sensitization to either <b>lupine</b> or to pea or soy occurs frequently. The ED for <b>lupine</b> is low (0. 5 mg), which is only five fold higher than for peanut. Patients are not aware of <b>lupine</b> allergy and the presence of <b>lupine</b> in food, indicating that education is important to build awareness...|$|R

50|$|Many {{other factors}} may {{influence}} the quality of wild <b>lupine</b> (Lupinus perennis) as a Karner blue butterfly food resource. At Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, wild <b>lupine</b> with Karner blue butterfly feeding damage had significantly larger leaves and longer and thicker stems than plants without feeding damage. In addition, larval length was positively associated with wild <b>lupine</b> height in central Wisconsin. Higher nitrogen concentrations in wild <b>lupine</b> leaves resulted in significantly shorter larval durations in a feeding trial. In 1995, in west-central Wisconsin, significantly more Karner blue butterfly larvae were observed in oak-pine barren plots where mildew infection was delayed compared to areas where wild <b>lupine</b> were infected earlier. However, in a feeding trial larval duration of Karner blue butterflies fed mildew-infected wild <b>lupine</b> was {{not significantly different from}} treatments that resulted in the shortest larval durations. Karner blue butterfly fed water-stressed wild <b>lupine</b> had significantly longer larval durations than many treatments including larvae fed flowering wild <b>lupine,</b> shade-grown wild <b>lupine</b> in seed, or mildew-infected wild <b>lupine.</b> Although Karner blue butterflies have been shown to benefit from their association with ants, wild <b>lupine</b> with Karner blue butterfly larvae in the Allegan State Game Area in Michigan were not detectably closer to ant hills than wild <b>lupine</b> without caterpillars.|$|R

40|$|Background: Reports of <b>lupine</b> allergy are {{increasing}} as {{its use in}} food products increases. <b>Lupine</b> allergy might be the consequence of cross-reactivity after sensitization to peanut or other legumes or de novo sensitization. <b>Lupine</b> allergens have not been completely characterized. Objectives: We sought to identify allergens associated with <b>lupine</b> allergy, evaluate potential cross-reactivity with peanut, and determine eliciting doses (EDs) for <b>lupine</b> allergy by using double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges. Methods: Six patients {{with a history of}} allergic reactions to <b>lupine</b> flour were evaluated by using skin prick tests, CAP tests, and double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges. Three of these patients were also allergic to peanut. <b>Lupine</b> allergens were characterized by means of IgE immunoblotting and peptide sequencing. Results: In all 6 patients the ED for <b>lupine</b> flour was 3 mg or less for subjective symptoms and 300 mg or more for objective symptoms. The low ED and moderate-to-severe historical symptoms indicate significant allergenicity of <b>lupine</b> flour. Two patients allergic to <b>lupine</b> but not to peanut displayed IgE binding predominantly to approximately 66 -kd proteins and weak binding to 14 - and 24 -kd proteins, whereas patients with peanut allergy and <b>lupine</b> allergy showed weak binding to <b>lupine</b> proteins of about 14 to 21 or 66 kd. Inhibition of binding was primarily species specific. Conclusion: <b>Lupine</b> allergy can occur either separately or together with peanut allergy, as demonstrated by 3 patients who are cosensitized to peanut and <b>lupine.</b> Clinical implications: <b>Lupine</b> flour is allergenic and potentially cross-reactive with peanut allergen, thus posing some risk if used as a replacement for soy flour. © 2007 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology...|$|R

An often cited reason for the dependence of larvae, especially 2nd-brood larvae, on shaded habitat is the possibility of early senescence of wild <b>lupine</b> in open areas resulting in a lack of larval food. Shade-grown wild <b>lupine</b> being more nutritious, possibly due to nitrogen content limiting photosynthesis to a greater extent in open areas, was one of several explanations. The size of wild <b>lupine</b> has been positively associated with Karner blue butterfly larval length and amount of feeding damage. In addition, there may be shade-related effects on Karner blue butterflies that are related to the density of wild <b>lupine.</b> Wild <b>lupine</b> are typically more abundant in open areas than in shade. Mildew infection of wild <b>lupine</b> may be increased in denser wild <b>lupine</b> patches. Lower mildew infection rates in shadier areas have been reported. However the implications of mildew infection on Karner blue butterfly are uncertain (see section [...] "Wild lupine"). It has also been suggested that the low density of wild <b>lupine</b> in shadier habitats could provide better larval habitat due to the increased search effort required by predators. This trade-off between <b>lupine</b> quality and quantity is another reason heterogeneous habitat is important for Karner blue butterfly.|$|R
