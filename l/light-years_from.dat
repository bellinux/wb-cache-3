5|$|There {{are several}} naked-eye double stars in Grus. Forming a {{triangle}} with Alnair and Beta, Delta Gruis is an optical double whose components—Delta1 and Delta2—are separated by 45 arcseconds. Delta1 is a yellow giant of spectral type G7III and magnitude 4.0, 309 <b>light-years</b> <b>from</b> Earth, {{and may have}} its own magnitude 12 orange dwarf companion. Delta2 is a red giant of spectral type M4.5III and semiregular variable that ranges between magnitudes 3.99 and 4.2, located 325 <b>light-years</b> <b>from</b> Earth. It has around 3 times the mass and 135 times the diameter of our sun. Mu Gruis, composed of Mu1 and Mu2, is also an optical double—both stars are yellow giants of spectral type G8III around 2.5 times as massive as the Sun with surface temperatures of around 4900 K. Mu1 is the brighter of the two at magnitude 4.8 located around 275 <b>light-years</b> <b>from</b> Earth, while Mu2 the dimmer at magnitude 5.11 lies 265 light-years distant from Earth. Pi Gruis, an optical double with a variable component, is composed of Pi1 Gruis and Pi2. Pi1 is a semi-regular red giant of spectral type S5, ranging from magnitude 5.31 to 7.01 {{over a period of}} 191 days, and is around 532 <b>light-years</b> <b>from</b> Earth. One of the brightest S-class stars to Earth viewers, it has a companion star of apparent magnitude 10.9 with sunlike properties, being a yellow main sequence star of spectral type G0V. The pair make up a likely binary system. Pi2 is a giant star of spectral type F3III-IV located around 130 <b>light-years</b> <b>from</b> Earth, and is often brighter than its companion at magnitude 5.6. Marking the right wing is Theta Gruis, yet another double star, lying 5 degrees east of Delta1 and Delta2.|$|E
5|$|Epsilon Tucanae {{traditionally}} {{marks the}} toucan's left leg. A B-type subgiant, {{it has a}} spectral type B9IV and an apparent magnitude of 4.49. It is approximately 373 <b>light-years</b> <b>from</b> Earth. It is around four times as massive as our Sun.|$|E
5|$|M34 is an {{open cluster}} that appears at {{magnitude}} 5.5, and is approximately 1,500 <b>light-years</b> <b>from</b> Earth. It contains about 100 stars scattered over a field of view larger {{than that of the}} full moon. M34 can be resolved with good eyesight but is best viewed using a telescope at low magnifications. IC 348 is a somewhat young open cluster that is still contained within the nebula from which its stars formed. It is located about 1,027 <b>light-years</b> <b>from</b> Earth, is about 2 million years old, and contains many stars with circumstellar disks. Many brown dwarfs have been discovered in this cluster due to its age; since brown dwarfs cool as they age, it is easier to find them in younger clusters.|$|E

50|$|Located on {{the border}} with Circinus is the unusual {{planetary}} nebula NGC 5189, estimated to be around 1750 <b>light-years</b> away <b>from</b> Earth. Its complex structure is due to multiple ejections of material from the ageing central star, which are distorted by the presence of a likely binary companion. Located 2.4° east of Eta Muscae is the magnitude-12.9 Engraved Hourglass Nebula (MyCn 18), which lies about 8000 <b>light-years</b> distant <b>from</b> Earth. To Eta's west lies IC 4191, a compact bluish planetary nebula of magnitude 10.6, thought to lie around 10,750 <b>light-years</b> away <b>from</b> Earth. West of Epsilon Muscae is NGC 4071, a large, diffuse planetary nebula of magnitude 12.7 with a magnitude 12 central star, thought to lie around 4000 <b>light-years</b> away <b>from</b> Earth.

Also known as Al Dhanab, it has finished fusing its core hydrogen and has begun cooling and expanding, which will see it transform into a red giant.|$|E
5|$|The Apex of the Sun's Way, or {{the solar}} apex, is the {{direction}} that the Sun travels relative to other nearby stars. This motion is towards {{a point in the}} constellation Hercules, near the star Vega. Of the 50 nearest stellar systems within 17 <b>light-years</b> <b>from</b> Earth (the closest being the red dwarf Proxima Centauri at approximately 4.2 light-years), the Sun ranks fourth in mass.|$|E
5|$|There {{are over}} thirty double stars in Coma Berenices, {{including}} 24 Comae Berenices with contrasting colors. Its primary is an orange-hued giant star with a magnitude of 5.0, 610 <b>light-years</b> <b>from</b> Earth, and its secondary is a blue-white-hued star with a magnitude of 6.6.

5|$|Vega, also {{designated}} Alpha Lyrae (α Lyrae, abbreviated Alpha Lyr or α Lyr), is {{the brightest}} star in the constellation of Lyra, the fifth-brightest star in the night sky, and the second-brightest star in the northern celestial hemisphere, after Arcturus. It is relatively close at only 25 <b>light-years</b> <b>from</b> the Sun, and, together with Arcturus and Sirius, one of the most luminous stars in the Sun's neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|A typical core {{collapse}} supernova at {{the distance}} of Eta Carinae would peak at an apparent magnitude around −4, similar to Venus. A SLSN could be five magnitudes brighter, potentially the brightest supernova in recorded history (currently SN 1006). At 7,500 <b>light-years</b> <b>from</b> the star {{it is unlikely to}} directly affect terrestrial lifeforms, as they will be protected from gamma rays by the atmosphere and from some other cosmic rays by the magnetosphere. The main damage would be restricted to the upper atmosphere, the ozone layer, spacecraft, including satellites, and any astronauts in space. At least one paper has projected that complete loss of the Earth's ozone layer is a plausible consequence of a supernova, which would result in a significant increase in UV radiation reaching Earth's surface from the Sun. This would require a typical supernova to be closer than 50 <b>light-years</b> <b>from</b> Earth, and even a potential hypernova would need to be closer than Eta Carinae. Another analysis of the possible impact discusses more subtle effects from the unusual illumination, such as possible melatonin suppression with resulting insomnia and increased risk of cancer and depression. It concludes that a supernova of this magnitude would have to be much closer than Eta Carinae to have any type of major impact on Earth.|$|E

5|$|Algol (from the Arabic رأس الغول Ra's al-Ghul, {{which means}} The Demon's Head), also {{known by its}} Bayer {{designation}} Beta Persei, is the best-known star in Perseus. Representing {{the eye of the}} Gorgon Medusa in Greek mythology, it was called Horus in Egyptian mythology and Rosh ha Satan ("Satan's Head") in Hebrew. Located 92.8 <b>light-years</b> <b>from</b> Earth, it varies in apparent magnitude from a minimum of 3.5 to a maximum of 2.3 over a period of 2.867 days.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} Andromeda Galaxy and its companions, the {{constellation}} also features NGC 891 (Caldwell 23), a smaller galaxy {{just east of}} Almach. It is a barred spiral galaxy seen edge-on, with a dark dust lane visible down the middle. NGC 891 is incredibly faint and small despite its magnitude of 9.9, as its surface brightness of 14.6 indicates; it is 13.5 by 2.8 arcminutes in size. NGC 891 was discovered by the brother-and-sister team of William and Caroline Herschel in August 1783.

5|$|Galaxies are {{categorized}} {{according to}} their visual morphology as elliptical, spiral, or irregular. Many galaxies {{are thought to have}} black holes at their active centers. The Milky Way's central black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, has a mass four million times greater than the Sun. As of March 2016, GN-z11 is the oldest and most distant observed galaxy with a comoving distance of 32 billion <b>light-years</b> <b>from</b> Earth, and observed as it existed just 400 million years after the Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|Gamma Comae Berenices (15 Comae Berenices) is an orange-hued giant {{star with}} a {{magnitude}} of 4.4 and a spectral class of K1III C. In the southwestern {{part of the}} constellation, it is 170 ± 7 <b>light-years</b> <b>from</b> Earth, Estimated to be around 1.79 times as massive as the Sun, it has expanded to around 10 times its radius. It is {{the brightest star in}} the Coma Star Cluster. With Alpha Comae Berenices and Beta Comae Berenices, Gamma Comae Berenices forms a 45-degree isosceles triangle from which Berenice's imaginary tresses hang.|$|E
5|$|Hoag's Object, located 600 million <b>light-years</b> <b>from</b> Earth, is {{a member}} of the very rare class of galaxies known as ring galaxies. The outer ring is largely {{composed}} of young blue stars while the core is made up of older yellow stars. The predominant theory regarding its formation is that the progenitor galaxy was a barred spiral galaxy whose arms had velocities too great to keep the galaxy's coherence and therefore detached. Arp 220 is another unusual galaxy in Serpens. The prototypical ultraluminous infrared galaxy, Arp 220 is somewhat closer than Hoag's Object at 250 million <b>light-years</b> <b>from</b> Earth. It consists of two large spiral galaxies in the process of colliding with their nuclei orbiting at a distance of 1,200 light-years, causing extensive star formation throughout both components. It possesses a large cluster of more than a billion stars, partially covered by thick dust clouds near one of the galaxies' core. Another interacting galaxy pair, albeit in an earlier stage, consists of the galaxies NGC 5953 and NGC 5954. In this case, both are active galaxies, with the former a Seyfert 2 galaxy and the latter a LINER-type galaxy. Both are undergoing a burst of star formation triggered by the interaction.|$|E
