But inception of Euro changed this unique stature and status enjoyed by USD. With introduction of Euro as the common currency, the European Union became USA’s closest competitor {{in terms of economic}} size, performance, indicators and political and economic clout. Over time, value of euro started appreciating and accordingly, Euro/USD exchange rate which is fully floating, started rising. A rising Euro affects the US economy in three ways: directly, indirectly and through a cascading effect caused by an interaction of these direct and indirect influences. This paper attempts to identify and explore the effects of an appreciating Euro on some select economic indicators of the US, both historically and projected. It also establishes the relationship between some of these indicators which are not directly cross-related, by analyzing the impact of the Euro on the economy’s most sensitive economic parameters. Section I briefly touches upon the scope and objective of this paper. Section II introduces the concept of exchange rate, different exchange rate regimes and determinants of exchange rates.

50|$|This is not {{the same}} as the {{mechanisms}} provided by calls such as mmap and Win32's MapViewOfFile, because inter-file pointers do not work when mapping files into semi-arbitrary places. In Multics, a file (or a segment from a multi-segment file) is mapped into a segment in the address space, so files are always mapped at a segment boundary. A file's <b>linkage</b> <b>section</b> can contain pointers for which an attempt to load the pointer into a register or make an indirect reference through it causes a trap. The unresolved pointer contains an indication of the name of the segment to which the pointer refers and an offset within the segment; the handler for the trap maps the segment into the address space, puts the segment number into the pointer, changes the tag field in the pointer so that it no longer causes a trap, and returns to the code where the trap occurred, re-executing the instruction that caused the trap. This eliminates the need for a linker completely and works when different processes map the same file into different places in their private address spaces.|$|E

40|$|CARIM-India: Developing a {{knowledge}} base for policymaking on India-EU migrationIndia has had long-standing investment ties with various EU countries. Many EU countries are significant investors in India and several EU-based MNCs have business operations in India. Of late, Indian {{investments in the}} EU have also gained importance. Leading Indian IT companies have established local presence through branches and subsidiaries in several EU countries. Alongside the growing business relations between India and the EU, there is increased short-term and circular mobility of persons between India and the EU, {{in large part to}} support business operations in each other’s markets. This paper examines the linkages between investment and associated labour mobility between India and the EU. Following the introduction, Section 2 provides a brief literature review of labour mobility and investment relations and their effects on developed and developing nations. Section 3 offers an overview of growing investment relations between India and the EU and accompanying labour flows between India and the EU to underscore the need for studying this <b>linkage.</b> <b>Section</b> 4 discusses immigration and labour market regulations which have a bearing on investment operations and vice versa, for selected EU countries in order to highlight the extent to which regulations on one impinge on the other. It also examines the Schengen treaty and the implications of recent developments such as the EU Blue Card and totalisation agreements (signed or under negotiation) between India and some EU countries for investment-related labour mobility from India to the EU. Section 5 provides the findings from in-depth interviews conducted with senior industry executives from leading EU as well as Indian firms {{to understand the nature of}} the labour flows which accompany investment operations. It also examines the extent to which investment and labour flows in the India-EU context are complementary and how barriers to labour mobility may affect investment operations in each other’s market. The discussion in this section indicates that there is considerable short-term mobility of Indian business visitors, intracorporate transferees, and professionals working from Indian subsidiaries of European firms to the EU countries. There is also movement of skilled Indians working in Indian firms in India, to their EU-based subsidiaries. In both cases, movement from India to the EU is mainly driven by the need to address skill shortages in the EU countries and to facilitate the migration and offshoring of client processes to India. The evidence indicates that investment presence in the EU facilitates mobility from India to the EU, although there are considerable differences in labour market and investment regulations across the different EU member countries. Section 6 examines the nature of movement by EU nationals to Indian subsidiaries of EU MNCs and the associated Indian immigration policies affecting such movement. The discussion indicates that such movement is very limited at present, mostly pertaining to business meetings and training sessions and the problems encountered mostly pertain to issues of transparency, poor institutional mechanisms and delays. Section 7 concludes by noting the main issues concerning labour mobility that would need to be addressed to promote India-EU investment relations.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade {{the focus of our}} group has been {{production}} of polycarbonates through environmentally friendly routes. Continuing with this tradition, one such route is the ring opening polymerization of cyclic carbonates. The aliphatic polycarbonate derived from trimethylene carbonate, (TMC, 1, 3 -dioxan- 2 -one), has been studied extensively for its potential use as a biodegradable polymer in biomedical and pharmaceutical systems. Its important applications include sutures, drug delivery systems and tissue engineering. To date, majority of the literature concerning catalysts for polymerization of TMC has been restricted to the use of simple Lewis acids with a marked absence of well defined and characterized catalysts. Metal salen complexes have been effective in the ring opening of cyclohexene oxide and the copolymerization of epoxide and carbon dioxide. The ability of this system as a catalyst for the polymerization of cyclic carbonates to polycarbonates is reported in this dissertation. The salen ligand is among the most versatile ligands in chemistry. Our attempts to optimize the catalytic activity by manipulating the salen structure and reaction conditions are also discussed. Our initial efforts were concentrated in understanding the efficacy of Lewis acidic metal salen complexes (Al & Sn), as catalysts for this process. This was followed by the utilization of metal salen complexes of biometals as catalysts for the synthesis of these biodegradable polymers, {{as well as for the}} copolymerization of cyclic carbonates with cyclic esters. These copolymers are presently in great demand for their applications as sutures in the medical industry. During the course of our investigations, a novel method of synthesizing polytrimethylene carbonate, by the copolymerization of CO 2 and trimethylene oxide, has come to our attention. Surprisingly this reaction has received very little scientific exposure. We observed that metal salen derivatives, along with n-alkyl ammonium salts, were effective catalysts for the selective coupling of CO 2 and oxetane (trimethylene oxide) to provide the corresponding polycarbonate with only trace quantities of ether <b>linkages.</b> A <b>section</b> is also dedicated to our investigations in this area of research...|$|R

Firstly a review of some of the observations of solar flare dynamics is given, as well as an introduction to the competing theories attempting to explain both particle acceleration and filament formation. An explanation of the numerical FORTRAN code that is used to calculate the trajectories of particle distribution functions in prescribed electromagnetic fields is given. Examples of known fields are used to test the accuracy of the code and the simple example of the well-known Litvinenko current sheet field is investigated. The results of charged particle orbit calculations in prescribed electric and magnetic fields motivated by magnetic reconnection models are then presented. The electromagnetic fields are chosen to resemble a current sheet with a localised reconnection region. The dependence of the model on the important physical parameters is considered. An introduction to the mathematical formulation of a collapsing magnetic trap is given. The same numerical code is used to calculate single electron orbits in this more complicated time dependent electromagnetic field. Consideration of important previous work is given before describing the best attempts to model the movement of flare loops in a realistic fashion. Finally the process of flux cancellation and filament formation is studied using a range of data including ground-based Hα and SoHO MDI magnetograms.

40|$|Introduction] The {{prevailing}} view of {{the world}} economy is strikingly polarised. Analyses of macroeconomic linkages and transmission channels routinely represent the world with the US at the centre and other regions, among which Asia and Europe, at the periphery. Asia and Europe are obviously regarded as important players, but mainly in interaction with the US rather than with each other. In recent assessments of the short 2 ̆ 010 term economic outlook, the US is still widely seen as {{the driving force behind the}} global business cycle. The same bias has been apparent in discussions about exchange rates, as China, Japan, and the euro area have been discussing the relationship between their currencies and the US dollar separately without paying much attention to their bilateral relationships until the end of 2007. From innovation leadership to the issuance of the world 2 ̆ 019 s premier currency there are several objective reasons why the US economy still plays a leading economic role in the world and our intention is not to dispute this reality. But this reality cannot justify retaining an outdated or distorted view of international interdependence. Policymakers in Asia and Europe need to take the full measure of the international role of their economies and of their corresponding global responsibilities. Our aims in this paper are: - to provide an objective assessment of the weight and interdependence of the major regions; - to investigate the Asia 2 ̆ 010 Europe relationship in the context of the world economy; - to contribute to current discussions about the global repercussions of the financial turmoil; - to shed light on the implication of growing cross 2 ̆ 010 border assets and liabilities between the three regions. To this end we adopt a deliberately stylised {{view of the}} world economy and look at broad regions instead of countries. This overlooks many disparities within regions but has the advantage of allowing a consistent and tractable approach to trade and financial linkages in the context of scarce global supply of energy and food commodities. The paper is organised as follows. We start in section 2 from a decomposition of the world economy into four regions (North America, East Asia, Europe and the Rest of the World) and we assemble a number of stylised facts about their size and openness. We turn to bilateral <b>linkages</b> in <b>section</b> 3, looking separately at trade and financial linkages to investigate how the three main regions interact with each other.

40|$|Section I {{challenges}} Schultz's assertions: (1) {{small farmers}} are rational; (2) low income countries saddled with traditional agriculture have {{not the problem}} of many farmers leaving agriculture for nonfarm jobs; (3) part-time farming can be efficient; (4) economies of scale do not exist in agriculture; and (5) investment in human capital counts much more than institutional changes and {{is the key to}} agricultural growth. It reveals that ever since the 1950 s, after the land reform, the irrational and polyopolistic land use by able-bodied part-time and absent (mainly small) farmers earning higher off-farm income but unwilling to lease their insufficiently produced land beyond family consumption need to full-time farmers, has evolutionarily been a global obstacle with both public and private land ownership, traditional and modern agriculture, fragmented small and consolidatorily enlarged land, low and high income economies, food under-self-sufficiency and overproduction, and developing and developed countries, albeit land property rights have been well defined and sale/lease allowed, causing many negative consequences on agriculture, rural development, income distribution, government expenditure, competition, trade, environment, etc. (Polyopoly is designed by the author to mean the control by many sellers in contrast to monopoly and oligopoly). It has become a microeconomic root of the three persisting global macroeconomic problems: under-self-sufficiency, overproduction and agricultural protectionism. Evidence in Asia, Africa, South and North Americas, and Europe is cited. Section II argues that Hirschman ignores that it has hampered the <b>linkage</b> effects. <b>Section</b> III presents that only China has successfully exercised effective and appropriate solutions, but under public land ownership which may be unacceptable to others. Section IV indicates that effective and appropriate solutions have not been adopted under private land ownership world-wide. It presents two effective (but not appropriate) Western European legislations and their shortcomings at the under-self-sufficiency stage, and fundamental and derived dilemmas at the overproduction stage at which, without a solution, the EU (and many other developed nations) has exercised protectionism by a coupling between subsidies and production (which together with price supports, export aids and import restrictions has made their farmers less competitive and harmed their consumers and taxpayers and the developing countries). In July 2002 the EU proposed a complete decoupling, but retreated in June 2003 to allow the Member States to keep the coupling, due to no solution to avoid production abandonment caused by part-time and absent landowners' refusal to lease their irrationally and polyopolistically used land to full-time farmers at low rents, which has just exposed this microeconomic root of protectionism. Section V proposes effective and appropriate solutions for both developing and developed countries at both under-self-sufficiency and overproduction stages without changing private land ownership to achieve the following aims at the same time: minimize/abolish/prevent protectionism, while avoiding production abandonment and overproduction; reinforce full-time large farmers, whereas not crowding part-time and absent small farmers out of agriculture; reach/maintain basic self-sufficiency in cereals, meanwhile promoting multi-functionality of other agricultural and rural sectors and improving the environment. Section VI predicts the promotion of fraternity among nations if the proposed solutions could be adopted globally. The author's analyses and suggestions have received positive responses from the EU, EU accession countries, CABI, OECD, UN, CSD, FAO, UNEP and World Bank. Land Economics/Use,...|$|R
40|$|Approximately 4 % of English-speaking {{children}} {{are affected by}} Specific Language Impairment (SLI); a disorder {{in the development of}} language skills despite adequate opportunity and normal intelligence. Several studies have indicated the importance of genetic factors in SLI; a positive family history confers an increased risk of development, and monozygotic concordance consistently exceeds that of dizygotic twins. However, like many behavioural traits, SLI is assumed to be genetically complex with several loci contributing to the overall risk. This thesis aims to clarify the genetic mechanisms underlying Specific Language Impairment by the exploitation of recent advances in technological, genetic and statistical techniques. This goal is achieved, for the main part, through the completion of the first-ever, systematic genome- wide screen for loci involved in the disorder. A collection of 98 families was drawn from both epidemiological and clinical populations, all with probands who display severe deficits in language skills. Genome-wide linkage analyses were completed for three language-related measures and identified two regions which may harbour susceptibility gene variants for SLI, one on chromosome 16 and a second on chromosome 19. Both of these loci yielded maximum LOD scores of 3. 55 and exceeded the threshold for suggestive linkage under all types of analysis performed. Fine mapping of the chromosome 19 locus with a high-density map of microsatellite markers provided further support for the role of this region in SLI but failed to narrow the area of <b>linkage.</b> The second <b>section</b> of the thesis therefore explores alternative genetic strategies that may facilitate the localisation of susceptibility variants from the genomic regions identified. Mutation screening and association analyses were performed for two candidate genes within a subset of 48 families affected by SLI. The first ⎼ numblike (NBL), or numb-related (NUMB-R) (MIM 604018) ⎼ was selected from the region of linkage on chromosome 19 q and the second ⎼ Forkhead-bOX domain P 2 (FOXP 2) (MIM 605317) ⎼ has recently been shown to be mutated in a family with a severe speech and language disorder. Finally, I describe the mapping of a translocation breakpoint within a child affected by a severe language impairment and orofacial dyspraxia. This breakpoint lies on chromosome 2 q and coincides with a putative region of linkage in both language impairment and autism. In the long-term it is hoped that techniques similar to those described here will allow the identification of the gene variants which underlie SLI allowing to the development of better diagnosis and treatment for those children with language impairments. </p...|$|R

The second section, 2 ̆ 7 Pan Osculans 2 ̆ 7, explores ideas of 2 ̆ 7 nature 2 ̆ 7, human complexity and a desire to find Utopian social forms through the quest of a primatologist to find and identify with a new species of ape. The third novella, 2 ̆ 7 Our Lady of the Sorrows 2 ̆ 7, follows a young girl inside a military bunker as her father contemplates nuclear destruction, acting as a reminder of the d,ire need to continually reconsider the more oppressive of our norms. Exegesis: Heroine and Back Again: Beyond Butler 2 ̆ 7 s Heteronormative Impasse The exegesis works through the stymieing point provided to feminist activism by Judith Butler 2 ̆ 7 s critiques of identity, radicalism and the way oppositional politics always re-invokes the 2 ̆ 7 other 2 ̆ 7 it attempts to deny. However I find that, where normative reiterations attach to interests that can be evaluated and critiqued, 2 ̆ 7 dichotomy 2 ̆ 7 is an insufficient understanding, and a political art practice derived from it (such as ephemeral norm-destabilisation) may prove unnecessarily limiting. For instance, in traditional militarism 2 ̆ 7 s case, I argue that genders are produced specifically {{in the construction of the}} warrior bond (principled around motifs of penetrability), from where they achieve a hegemonic status. This reframing of the discussion to include interests within heteronormativity allows for a reappraisal of radical feminisms as well as postfeminist logic, and to my mind permits political and artistic tactics from all fields to seem at least partially useful. For instance, I try to recoup Utopianism as a potentially powerful constructive tool, and in some parts of the novel I employ what have been called ‘feminist poetics’, including a range of linguistic tactics like elision, misnomer and stream-of-consciousness. In conclusion, my goal is not to produce a singular antiheteronormative fiction (or literary ‘heroine’) but to use the fiction to explore and strengthen the bridge between feminist and postfeminist methodologies in the process of delegitimating (and exposing) heteronorms...|$|R

In meeting these objectives, a further priority for the study was: to elaborate upon the application of field research techniques within an educational setting. This involved the provision of an ongoing autobiographical component to the report, detailing the 'processes, pitfalls, dilemmas, and discoveries' encountered during the development and implementation of methodological and analytic strategies. Throughout the 1984 school year, data was collected from the sample of adult students, school Principal, Dean of Adult Students and classroom teachers, using a selection of field research techniques (e. g., participant observation, interviews, questionnaires, diary accounts, and documentary materials). The data was gathered within a broadly categorised symbolic interactionist perspective and subjected to a 'grounded theory' form of analysis. This 'emergent' form of analysis, combined with the data gathering strategies, provided a basis for the elaboration of the social and cultural landscape necessary in this initial attempt at documenting the processes of becoming an adult student. The outcome of using these two approaches in tandem was the identification of six 'factors of influence' as organizational headings to subsume the day-to-day experiences of becoming an adult student: Returning to School; School Policy, Adult Status and the Role of the Dean; In the School; In the Classroom; Decision Points; and, Goal Achievements. Furthermore, two overriding themes indicated the processes through which the adult student was, at one and the same time, both 'integrated' into the overall school culture and 'differentiated' as a member of the separate adult student subculture. The notion of these processes of becoming was subjected to a theoretical elaboration incorporating the establishment of a conceptual model and explanatory constructs. From this cumulative form of theory development, linkages were indicated suggesting a group of 'common processes' existing across a variety of different comparative contexts. In addition to the recommendation that the further development of theories of such processes need to explore such <b>linkages,</b> the final <b>sections</b> of this report discuss a number of implications and uses which might be derived. For instance, it is suggested that this preliminary, yet extensive, investigation provides both descriptive data and theoretical categories which may be of use to: teachers, adult students, policy-makers and researchers interested in the study of adult students in secondary schools, developments within the areas of methodological and analytical strategies, and in elaborating the processes of becoming. Finally, an overall implication arising from the report is that the complex, dynamic and individualistic nature of the processes involved in becoming an adult student lends little support to deterministic models and theories, or to superficial accounts derived from 'one-shot methodologies and perspectives of such processes and experiences...|$|R
