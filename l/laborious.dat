5|$|Branham {{regarded}} {{his series}} of sermons on the Seven Seals in 1963 as {{a highlight of}} his ministry. In reality, Branham's teaching on this subject revealed very little new doctrine and was essentially a <b>laborious</b> restatement of the dispensationalism espoused in the sermons on the seven church ages.|$|E
5|$|Walt Disney Studios used a Pixar Image Computer {{and custom}} {{software}} written by Pixar {{as part of}} their Computer Animation Production System (CAPS) project, to migrate the <b>laborious</b> ink and paint part of the 2D animation process to a more automated method.|$|E
5|$|The February Revolution {{halted the}} Finnish {{economic}} boom {{caused by the}} Russian war-economy. The collapse in business led to unemployment and high inflation, but the workers who had a job gained an opportunity to resolve long-term problems of their <b>laborious</b> working life. The commoners call for eight-hour-per-day working limits, better working conditions and higher wages led to demonstrations and large-scale strikes in industry and agriculture.|$|E
5|$|The {{decipherment}} {{and recovery}} of the knowledge of Maya writing {{has been a long}} and <b>laborious</b> process. Some elements were first deciphered in the late 19th and early 20th century, mostly the parts having to do with numbers, the Maya calendar, and astronomy. Major breakthroughs were made from the 1950s to 1970s, and accelerated rapidly thereafter. By the end of the 20th century, scholars were able to read the majority of Maya texts, and ongoing work continues to further illuminate the content.|$|E
5|$|The grapes exhibit {{an uneven}} pattern of ripening: a single bunch may contain both raisin-like, {{over-ripe}} grapes and green, unripened grapes. Some winemakers choose to vinify the bunches with these {{varying levels of}} ripeness, while others hand-harvest the bunches, even by single berries, in multiple passes through the vineyards over several weeks. This extensively <b>laborious</b> practice is one component in {{the high cost of}} some Zinfandels.|$|E
5|$|Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic is a 2006 graphic memoir by the American {{cartoonist}} Alison Bechdel, {{author of}} the comic strip Dykes to Watch Out For. It chronicles the author's childhood and youth in rural Pennsylvania, United States, focusing on her complex relationship with her father. The book addresses themes of sexual orientation, gender roles, suicide, emotional abuse, dysfunctional family life, {{and the role of}} literature in understanding oneself and one's family. Writing and illustrating Fun Home took seven years, in part because of Bechdel's <b>laborious</b> artistic process, which includes photographing herself in poses for each human figure.|$|E
5|$|Ruisdael's {{work from}} c. 1646 {{to the early}} 1650s, when {{he was living in}} Haarlem, is characterised by simple motifs and careful and <b>laborious</b> study of nature: dunes, woods, and {{atmospheric}} effects. By applying heavier paint than his predecessors, Ruisdael gave his foliage a rich quality, conveying a sense of sap flowing through branches and leaves. His accurate rendering of trees was unprecedented at the time: the genera of his trees are the first to be unequivocally recognisable by modern-day botanists. His early sketches introduce motifs that would return in all his work: a sense of spaciousness and luminosity, and an airy atmosphere achieved through pointillist-like touches of chalk. Most of his thirty black chalk sketches that survive date from this period.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, in 1791, {{with his}} ideas for {{manufacturing}} being a major influence, Hamilton, along with Coxe and several entrepreneurs from New York and Philadelphia helped form the Society for the Establishment of Useful Manufactures, a private industrial corporation. In May 1792, the directors decided to scope out The Passaic Falls. On July 4, 1792, The society directors met Philip Schuyler at Abraham Godwin's {{hotel on the}} Passaic River, where they would lead a tour prospecting the area for the national manufactory. It was originally suggested that they dig mile long trenches and build the factories away from the falls, but Hamilton argued {{that it would be}} too costly and <b>laborious.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although MalcolmX {{retained}} {{final approval}} of their hybrid text, {{he was not}} privy to the actual editorial processes superimposed from Haley's side. The Library of Congress held the answers. This collection includes the papers of Doubleday's then-executive editor, Kenneth McCormick, who had worked closely with Haley for several years as the Autobiography had been constructed. As in the Romaine papers, I found more evidence of Haley's sometimes-weekly private commentary with McCormick about the <b>laborious</b> process of composing the book. They also revealed how several attorneys retained by Doubleday closely monitored and vetted entire sections of the controversial text in 1964, demanding numerous name changes, the reworking and deletion of blocks of paragraphs, and so forth. In late 1963, Haley was particularly worried about what he viewed as MalcolmX's anti-Semitism. He therefore rewrote material to eliminate a number of negative statements about Jews in the book manuscript, with the explicit covert goal of 'getting them past MalcolmX,' without his coauthor's knowledge or consent. Thus, the censorship of MalcolmX had begun well prior to his assassination.|$|E
5|$|As Thompson began porting {{the game}} to the new system, {{he decided not to}} base the code on any of the {{existing}} software for the computer, and instead write his own. As a result, he implemented his own base code libraries for programs to use, including arithmetic packages and graphics subsystems. These initial subsystems were coded in assembly language on the GECOS system and assembled, then the output physically put on punched tapes to be carried over and inserted into the PDP-7. Thompson then wrote an assembler for the PDP-7 to avoid this <b>laborious</b> process. The game ran very slowly on the new machine, causing Thompson to branch out from there to design his own file system based on some ideas by Dennis Ritchie and Rudd Canaday, rooted in their experience with the Multics file system, with which he then ran Space Travel.|$|E
5|$|Caragiale's legal {{representative}} was the fellow writer Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea, who systematically disproved Caion's allegations, {{and noted that}} the absentee defendant was guilty of numerous forgeries. He also convinced the judge that the similarities between Năpasta and The Power of Darkness were superficial. The court found Ionescu-Caion guilty of slander. He was sentenced to a three-month jail term, a 500 lei fine and 10,000 lei in court costs. However, he appealed the tribunal's decision. The jury selection was a <b>laborious</b> process: Caion's lawyer Danielopol recused writers Nicolae Iorga and Ovid Densusianu, alleging that all Romanian literati had a vested interest to defend plagiarism. Iorga took offense, and reportedly challenged Danielopol to a duel. During the proceedings, Caion backed up on the original accusations, explaining that he had only invented a reason to bring Caragiale in for a trial. The court eventually acquitted Caion.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{creative}} differences, Kuntz {{backed out of}} the project, but created an adventure module that would be published {{at the same time as}} Gygax's first book. Gygax continued to painstakingly put Castle Zagyg together on his own, but even this slow and <b>laborious</b> process came to a complete halt when Gygax suffered a serious stroke in April 2004 and then another one a few weeks later. Although he returned to his keyboard after a seven-month convalescence, his output was reduced from 14-hour work days to only one or two hours per day. Finally in 2005, Castle Zagyg Part I: Yggsburgh, the first book in the six-book series, appeared. Later that year, Troll Lord Games also published Castle Zagyg: Dark Chateau (2005), the adventure module written for the Yggsburgh setting by Rob Kuntz. Jeff Talanian helped with the creation of the dungeon, eventually resulting in publication of the limited edition CZ9: The East Marks Gazetteer (2007).|$|E
5|$|Schnauzers have a {{specific}} groom cut that is standard among the Schnauzer breed. Schnauzers require regular grooming, either by stripping (mostly seen in show dogs), or by clipping (a short-cut usually reserved for family pets). Stripping removes the loose, dead coat; it may be done by hand, called finger stripping, or plucking, or with a stripping knife; either way, it is a <b>laborious</b> process. Many Miniature Schnauzers who are family pets have regular grooming appointments to have their hair clipped; clipping, using a mechanical clippers (or shaver), produces a soft, silky, skin-close trim. Whether stripped or clipped, the coat is close at the body, and falls into a fringe-like foundation on its undercarriage, called furnishings, which can be left to grow, but must be combed regularly. All Schnauzers, whether they are Miniatures, Standards, or Giants, often sport a beard, created by allowing the hair around their noses to grow out. Left unclipped or unstripped, the body hair will grow two to four inches, and will often tangle into mats and curls.|$|E
5|$|The Prussian War Ministry was interested, {{but some}} initial {{skepticism}} {{could only be}} overcome {{through a series of}} successful demonstrations. The pigeons proved relatively indifferent to explosions, but during battle a dovecote may need to be moved, and pigeons can take some time to orient to their new position. The problem of making carrier pigeons accept a displaced dovecote with only a minimum of retraining had been tackled with some success by the Italian army around 1880; the French artillery captain Reynaud solved it by raising the pigeons in an itinerant dovecote. There is no indication that Neubronner was aware of this work, but he knew there must be a solution as he had heard of an itinerant fairground worker who was also a pigeon fancier with a dovecote in his trailer. At the 1909 exhibitions in Dresden and Frankfurt he presented a small carriage that combined a darkroom with a mobile dovecote in flashy colors. In months of <b>laborious</b> work he trained young pigeons to return to the dovecote even after it was displaced.|$|E
5|$|The {{currently}} known {{processes for}} extracting titanium from its various ores are <b>laborious</b> and costly; {{it is not}} possible to reduce the ore by heating with carbon (as in iron smelting) because titanium combines with the carbon to produce titanium carbide. Pure metallic titanium (99.9%) was first prepared in 1910 by Matthew A. Hunter at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute by heating TiCl4 with sodium at 700–800°C under great pressure in a batch process known as the Hunter process. Titanium metal was not used outside the laboratory until 1932 when William Justin Kroll proved that it can be produced by reducing titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) with calcium. Eight years later he refined this process with magnesium and even sodium in what became known as the Kroll process. Although research continues into more efficient and cheaper processes (e.g., FFC Cambridge, Armstrong), the Kroll process is still used for commercial production.|$|E
5|$|The first Australian {{fighting}} patrol into Kalimantan began on 24 May with two platoons, 5 and 11 Platoons, from B Company and a forward observation party, departing the company base at Bukit Knuckle {{under the command}} of Major William Broderick. The patrol—designated Operation Article—involved an ambush patrol along the bank of the Sungei Koemba river. After several days of careful and <b>laborious</b> movement through the thick jungle Broderick established a patrol base on the high ground overlooking the river on 26 May and sent forward a small reconnaissance party of three men with Lieutenant Patrick Beale. The forward element subsequently detected a party of Indonesians in a re-entrant below, talking loudly and firing random shots, seemingly unaware of the proximity of the Australians and unconcerned with basic notions of security.|$|E
5|$|The {{innovation}} of {{movable type}} printing {{was made by}} the artisan Bi Sheng (990–1051), first described by the scientist and statesman Shen Kuo in his Dream Pool Essays of 1088. The collection of Bi Sheng's original clay-fired typeface was passed on to one of Shen Kuo's nephews, and was carefully preserved. Movable type enhanced the already widespread use of woodblock methods of printing thousands of documents and volumes of written literature, consumed eagerly by an increasingly literate public. The advancement of printing deeply affected education and the scholar-official class, since more books could be made faster while mass-produced, printed books were cheaper in comparison to <b>laborious</b> handwritten copies. The enhancement of widespread printing and print culture in the Song period was thus a direct catalyst in the rise of social mobility and expansion of the educated class of scholar elites, the latter which expanded dramatically in size from the 11th to 13th centuries.|$|E
5|$|In {{the story}} group, monsters {{were the first}} thing designed. The monsters' names, skills, and personalities were decided first, after which they were drawn by artist Akira Toriyama. Yuji Horii allowed Toriyama to paint full {{drawings}} rather than directly create the pixel art that would be shown in the game. The artwork was then converted into computer graphics; as Toriyama was unfamiliar with computer graphics technology, other staff took charge of this. Many new monsters needed to be designed to make the game feel real, and the process was <b>laborious</b> for Toriyama. But he has also said that, compared to the manga comics he was used to, he enjoyed painting more, so on balance the experience was positive. Yuji Horii stated that for his process, like other manga and film creators, he quickly outlines the story's plot in his mind. With regard to map design, a blank map was used to create the physical shape of the place, like a castle, cave, or tower, and then the key elements and story were created together afterwards. The scenarios were mainly written by his friend Hiroshi Miyaoka. Compared with write lines in writing paper and design map in graph paper, staff wrote both two in 5mm graph papers of A4, as they felt that's easy for organization; their manuscript thickness is 15cm.|$|E
5|$|The pilot {{episode was}} written by South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker, and was {{directed}} by Parker; it was made on a budget of $300,000. Similarly to Parker and Stone's Christmas shorts, the original pilot was animated entirely with traditional cut paper stop motion animation techniques. This <b>laborious</b> process involved creating hundreds of construction paper cutouts – including individual mouth shapes, {{and many of the}} characters in several different sizes –, and photographing every frame of the show with an overhead camera, to the dialog that had been recorded earlier. Assistants helped with the cutting and pasting of the cutouts, while the animation was primarily done by Parker, Stone, and South Park animation director Eric Stough. The episode took between three and three and a half months to complete, and animation took place in a small room at Celluloid Studios, in Denver, Colorado, during the summer of 1996. Additional animation techniques involved creating the starry night sky by putting holes into a black posterboard and illuminating it from behind, and having the pooling of Kenny's blood simulated by drawing an initial dot with a red marker pen, and drawing more to it with every frame. The characters who are not speaking rarely move, saving time in the animation process.|$|E

25|$|Albert Medal of the Royal Society of Arts, (1880) ‘for having established, after most <b>laborious</b> research, {{the true}} {{relation}} between heat, electricity and mechanical work, thus affording to the engineer a sure guide {{in the application}} of science to industrial pursuits’.|$|E
25|$|Aminotransferase enzymes {{can be used}} to {{synthesize}} chiral amines in non-racemic form either through kinetic resolution of a racemate or reductive amination of a prochiral ketone. Enantioselectivities are often extremely high; however, optimization of the reaction conditions can be <b>laborious.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{impact of}} the Industrial Revolution was first felt in the {{manufacture}} of fly lines. Instead of anglers twisting their own lines, a <b>laborious</b> and time-consuming process, the new textile spinning machines allowed for a variety of tapered lines to be easily manufactured and marketed.|$|E
25|$|The <b>laborious</b> {{processes}} that were required {{at that time}} to sequence such DNA (through bacterial cloning) were an effective brake {{on the development of the}} field of ancient DNA (aDNA). However, with the development of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) in the late 1980s, the field began to progress rapidly.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the tale}} resists {{explication}} as a strict allegory {{of a particular}} Platonic argument, Apuleius drew generally on imagery such as the <b>laborious</b> ascent of the winged soul (Phaedrus 248) and the union with the divine achieved by Soul {{through the agency of}} the daimon Love (Symposium 212b).|$|E
25|$|His {{long and}} <b>laborious</b> work was rewarded by many prizes: the Prix Saint-Vincent (1922-1947-1949), the Prix de la Montagne (‘Prize of the Mountain’, Milan 1927), the Premio Einaudi (1950), the Premio Consiglio dei Ministri (‘Italian Cabinet Prize’, Rome 1959), and the Premio Nazionale d'Arte Sacra (‘National Award for Sacred Art’, Rome 1960).|$|E
25|$|The Southern blot {{technique}} is <b>laborious,</b> and requires {{large amounts of}} undegraded sample DNA. Also, Karl Brown's original technique looked at many minisatellite loci at the same time, increasing the observed variability, but {{making it hard to}} discern individual alleles (and thereby precluding paternity testing). These early techniques have been supplanted by PCR-based assays.|$|E
25|$|The biggest {{challenge}} {{in this type}} of prostheses is the difficulty in its future removal. This is due to the formation of pannus fibrotic around the valve body and sewing ring. To separate the parts is very <b>laborious,</b> keeping intact the sewing ring, which will be used in the coupling of the new valve.|$|E
25|$|The Universal Prayer Hall of Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission, Agartala, {{was inaugurated}} on 7 February 2012 by the Vice-President of the Belur Math, Smaranananda ji Maharaj. This formed {{a part of}} the {{celebrations}} of the 150th birthday of Vivekananda. The project and celebration is the outcome of <b>laborious</b> efforts of Purnatmanandaji Maharaj, Secretary of the Agartala branch of the Belur Math.|$|E
25|$|Deleuze, who had {{suffered}} from respiratory ailments from a young age, developed tuberculosis in 1968 and underwent a thoracoplasty (lung removal). He suffered increasingly severe respiratory symptoms {{for the rest of}} his life. In the last years of his life, simple tasks such as writing required <b>laborious</b> effort. On November 4, 1995, he committed suicide, throwing himself from the window of his apartment.|$|E
25|$|For some {{environmental}} effects cost-benefit analysis {{can be substituted}} with cost-effectiveness analysis. This is especially true when {{there is only one}} type of physical outcome that is sought, such as the reduction of energy use by increasing energy efficiency. Using cost-effectiveness analysis is less <b>laborious</b> and time-consuming as it does not involve the monetization of outcomes, which can be difficult in some cases.|$|E
25|$|Changing {{the pitch}} of a timpani by turning each tension rod {{individually}} is a <b>laborious</b> process. In the late 19th century, mechanical systems to change the tension of the entire head at once were developed. Any timpani equipped with such a system may be considered machine timpani, although this term commonly refers to drums that use a handle connected to a spider-type tuning mechanism.|$|E
25|$|Cryptanalysis {{of the new}} {{mechanical}} devices {{proved to}} be both difficult and <b>laborious.</b> In the United Kingdom, cryptanalytic efforts at Bletchley Park during WWII spurred {{the development of more}} efficient means for carrying out repetitious tasks. This culminated {{in the development of the}} Colossus, the world's first fully electronic, digital, programmable computer, which assisted in the decryption of ciphers generated by the German Army's Lorenz SZ40/42 machine.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1955, the 9km Rimutaka Tunnel between Upper Hutt and Featherston opened, {{bypassing}} the <b>laborious</b> Rimutaka Incline {{and reducing the}} travel time from Wellington to Featherston to just over one hour, and from Wellington to Masterton to one-and-three-quarter hours. The Wairarapa Connection service started nine years later, after morning and afternoon peak services started to exceed the 176-seat capacity of the diesel railcars then used.|$|E
25|$|Compared to scuba diving, {{dressing}} the diver in is {{a relatively}} <b>laborious</b> process, as the equipment is bulky and fairly heavy, and several components are connected together by hoses. This is more so with helmets, and less so with light full-face masks. It is not usual for the diver {{to do all the}} dressing in without the assistance of a diver's tender, who will also manage the umbilical during the dive.|$|E
25|$|The {{possibility}} to intersperse text in Latin letters with Greek letters and mathematical symbols made the machine especially useful for scientists writing manuscripts that included mathematical formulas. Proper mathematical typesetting was very <b>laborious</b> {{before the advent}} of TeX and done only for much-sold textbooks and very prestigious scientific journals. Special type balls also were released for the Athabaskan languages, allowing Navajo and Apache bilingual programs in education to be typed for the first time.|$|E
