5|$|Squadron Leader Roger Bushell {{selected}} {{inmates and}} began planning an escape, at first focused on digging a tunnel. Already experienced from earlier escapes, Bushell became the nominal <b>leader</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> endeavour.

5|$|In 2011, he posted career highs in ERA (2.89), {{opponent}} {{batting average}} (.211) and WHIP (1.03). He was 13–7 in 30 games and {{was selected to}} his third All-Star Game. At {{the end of the}} 2011 season, the Red Sox stumbled and failed to make the playoffs. Beckett and two more starting pitchers (John Lackey and Jon Lester) were {{in the center of a}} controversy where the three drank alcohol during games, where they weren't pitching, and also ate fried chicken and played video games. Beckett was noted as the <b>leader</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> and some cited this behavior as part of the reason for the team's poor play down the stretch.|$|E
5|$|The {{translation}} of the myth of Myrrha as it appeared in Ovid's Metamorphoses is suggested as being {{a critique of the}} political settlement that followed the Glorious Revolution. The wife of the <b>leader</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> revolution, William of Orange, was Mary, daughter of James II. Mary and William were crowned king and queen of England in 1689, and because Dryden was deeply sympathetic to James he lost his public offices and fell into political disfavor under the new reign. Dryden turned to translation and infused these translations with political satire in response - the myth of Myrrha being one of these translations.|$|E

5|$|After Athens' {{defeat in}} the Peloponnesian War, Thrasybulus led the {{democratic}} resistance to the new oligarchic government, known as the Thirty Tyrants, which the victorious Spartans imposed on Athens. In 404 BC, he commanded a small force of exiles that invaded the Spartan-ruled Attica and, in successive battles, defeated first a Spartan garrison and then {{the forces of the}} oligarchy. In the wake of these victories, democracy was re-established at Athens. As a <b>leader</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> revived democracy in the 4th century BC, Thrasybulus advocated a policy of resistance to Sparta and sought to restore Athens' imperial power. He was killed in 388 BC while leading an Athenian naval force during the Corinthian War.|$|E
5|$|The Sauks {{were divided}} {{about whether to}} resist {{implementation}} of the disputed 1804 treaty. Most Sauks decided to relocate west of the Mississippi rather than become involved in a confrontation with the United States. The <b>leader</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> group was Keokuk, who had helped defend Saukenuk against the Americans during the War of 1812. Keokuk was not a chief, but as a skilled orator, he often spoke {{on behalf of the}} Sauk civil chiefs in negotiations with the Americans. Keokuk regarded the 1804 treaty as a fraud, but after having seen the size of American cities on the east coast in 1824, he did not think the Sauks could successfully oppose the United States.|$|E
5|$|The game {{opens with}} {{a vision of the}} player's {{character}} wielding a blade of light to strike down a masked man in black robes. The vision is a dream the player has while on a carriage ride to their chosen starting city—Gridania, Ul'dah, or Limsa Lominsa. Players returning from the original release appear in a forest in a pillar of light—Louisoix's final spell to save their lives from the devastation at Carteneau. Through undertaking various odd jobs, the player character ingratiates him or herself with the local Adventurer's Guild and earns comparisons with the fabled Warriors of Light, brave adventurers who participated in the Battle of Carteneau whose identities have been mysteriously erased from the memories of all who knew them. A pattern emerges amid these quests involving a series of attacks by masked men, as well {{as a member of the}} Scions of the Seventh Dawn who claims to know the origin of the player's visions. The adventurer meets the <b>leader</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> secret society, Minfilia, who reveals that the visions are a manifestation of the Echo and mark the player as a chosen representative of Hydaelyn, the Mothercrystal.|$|E

25|$|Sun Yat-sen {{successfully}} united the Revive China Society, Huaxinghui and Guangfuhui in {{the summer}} of 1905, thereby establishing the unified Tongmenghui (United League) in August 1905 in Tokyo. While it started in Tokyo, it had loose organizations distributed across and outside the country. Sun Yat-sen was the <b>leader</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> unified group. Other revolutionaries who worked with the Tongmenghui include Wang Jingwei and Hu Hanmin. When the Tongmenhui was established, more than 90% of the Tongmenhui members were between 17–26 years of age. Some of the work in the era includes manhua publications, such as the Journal of Current Pictorial.|$|E
25|$|That same spring, Harrison invited three {{families}} from the London temple {{to stay at}} his newly purchased Oxfordshire estate, Friar Park, where they helped restore the property's parkland and formal gardens. The devotees' arrival at Friar Park sated Harrison's love of chanting and inspired themes on his first post-Beatles solo album, All Things Must Pass (1970), but left his wife, Pattie Boyd, feeling increasingly isolated. While Boyd welcomed Shyamsundar's presence, as the <b>leader</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> group, she and others close to Harrison were disturbed by the devotees' approach to childrearing when a young boy twice came close to drowning in the property's fountains.|$|E
25|$|Tyndall {{was to be}} the <b>leader</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> new party, {{with the}} {{majority}} of its members coming from the NNF, although others were defectors from the NF, British Movement, British Democratic Party, and Nationalist Party. The party was formerly launched at a press conference held in a Victoria hotel on 7 April 1982. It was therefore dominated by ex-NF members and inherited that party's tradition of racial nationalism. Tyndall had led the NF on two occasions, and prior to that had been involved in several Neo-Nazi groups, having been involved in the National Socialist Movement during the early 1960s and then founded his own Greater Britain Movement in 1964.|$|E

25|$|In the 1980s {{there were}} a series of coup {{attempts}} against President René, {{some of which were}} supported by South Africa. In 1981, Mike Hoare led a team of 43 South African mercenaries masquerading as holidaying rugby players in the 1981 Seychelles coup d'état attempt. There was a gun battle at the airport, and most of the mercenaries later escaped in a hijacked Air India plane. The <b>leader</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> hijacking was German mercenary D. Clodo, {{a former member of the}} Rhodesian SAS. Clodo later stood trial in South Africa (where he was acquitted) as well as in his home country Germany for air-piracy.|$|E
25|$|His {{mother was}} Nakşidil Valide Sultan (who {{according}} to legend was a cousin of Joséphine de Beauharnais, wife of Napoleon Bonaparte). In 1808, Mahmud II's predecessor, and half-brother, Mustafa IV ordered his execution along with his cousin, the deposed Sultan Selim III, in order to defuse the rebellion. Selim III was killed, but Mahmud was safely kept hidden by his mother and {{was placed on the}} throne after the rebels deposed Mustafa IV. The <b>leader</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> rebellion, Alemdar Mustafa Pasha, later became Mahmud II's vizier. Western historians give Mahmud a bad reputation for simply being the Sultan during a time of deterioration of the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
25|$|However, operatic modernism's use of {{atonality}} also {{sparked a}} backlash {{in the form}} of neoclassicism. An early <b>leader</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> movement was Ferruccio Busoni, who in 1913 wrote the libretto for his neoclassical number opera Arlecchino (first performed in 1917). Also among the vanguard was the Russian Igor Stravinsky. After composing music for the Diaghilev-produced ballets Petrushka (1911) and The Rite of Spring (1913), Stravinsky turned to neoclassicism, a development culminating in his opera-oratorio Oedipus Rex (1927). Well after his Rimsky-Korsakov-inspired works The Nightingale (1914), and Mavra (1922), Stravinsky continued to ignore serialist technique and eventually wrote a full-fledged 18th-century-style diatonic number opera The Rake's Progress (1951). His resistance to serialism (an attitude he reversed following Schoenberg's death) proved to be an inspiration for many other composers.|$|E
