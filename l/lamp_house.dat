25|$|The {{coal mining}} {{industry}} in Canmore boomed {{well into the}} 20th century. In 1965, {{with a population of}} 2,000, Canmore was incorporated as a town. By the 1970s the market for coal was diminished, and in 1979 Canmore Mines Ltd. ceased operations. As a result of safety and reclamation policies instigated by the province of Alberta, all but a few mining structures were demolished in the following year; only the <b>lamp</b> <b>house</b> and a few mine entrances remain today.|$|E
25|$|In 1865, Ward {{relocated}} to Chicago, {{where he worked}} for Case and Sobin, a <b>lamp</b> <b>house.</b> He traveled for them as salesman, and sold goods on commission for a short time. Chicago {{was the center of}} the wholesale dry-goods trade, and in the 1860s Ward joined the leading dry-goods house, Field Palmer & Leiter, forerunner of Marshall Field & Co. He worked for Field for two years and then joined the wholesale dry-goods business of Wills, Greg & Co. In tedious rounds of train trips to southern communities, hiring rigs at the local stables, driving out to the crossroads stores and listening to the complaints of the back-country proprietors and their rural customers, he conceived a new merchandising technique: direct mail sales to country people. It was a time when rural consumers longed for the comforts of the city, yet all too often were victimized by monopolists and overcharged by the costs of many middlemen required to bring manufactured products to the countryside. The quality of merchandise also was suspect and the hapless farmer had no recourse in a caveat emptor economy. Ward shaped a plan to buy goods at low cost for cash. By eliminating intermediaries, with their markups and commissions, and drastically cutting selling costs, he could sell goods to people, however remote, at appealing prices. He invited them to send their orders by mail and he delivered the purchases to their nearest railroad station. The only thing he lacked was capital.|$|E

5000|$|In May 2013, the Fred Rouse Company, a local developer, {{proposed}} {{building a}} six-story apartment {{building to the}} north of the <b>Lamp</b> <b>House</b> that would require the demolition of three adjacent houses constructed between 1872 and 1904. Opposition to the plan prompted district alderperson Ledell Zellers in September 2013 to form an ad hoc committee to advise on plans for the block. The committee recommended that the northern viewscape toward Lake Mendota be preserved. In 2014, four houses east of the <b>Lamp</b> <b>House</b> were demolished to make room for a new residential building.

5000|$|The square, [...] "open" [...] {{floor plan}} without a wall between {{living room and}} dining room devised by Walter Burley Griffin for the <b>Lamp</b> <b>House</b> would become a {{standard}} in the following years, reused in no fewer than 25 of Wright's later projects, including the Barton House (1903-04) in Buffalo, New York, and adapted by Prairie School architects in numerous other projects. Wright adapted it in a plan he published in 1907, titled [...] "A Fireproof House for $5000", which {{became one of the}} exemplary modern residential floor plans of the period up to about 1920. Deficiencies in the exterior design of the <b>Lamp</b> <b>House,</b> such as the patterned brickwork, are probably attributable to the haste with which the project moved from commission to completion. Wright ordered working drawings to be made before a final version was put to paper. The <b>Lamp</b> <b>House</b> nonetheless has great significance in the history of both Wright's and Griffin's development.|$|E

50|$|HMI lamps {{can reach}} {{ignition}} voltages {{of up to}} 70,000 V when striking hot, and are considered very dangerous if miswired. It is good practice to strike {{the light from the}} ballast and not the head, in the event that there is a short circuit in the lamp head. Proper striking procedures should be followed as well, such as calling out a vocal warning whenever a light is turned on to warn persons in the area. Also, the header cable should be properly and securely connected. Nearly all present-day header cables are equipped with 'twist-lock' fittings at either end to ensure a safe and precise connection, both at the ballast and the <b>lamp</b> <b>housing.</b>|$|R

Although completely landlocked, the <b>Lamp</b> <b>House</b> originally provided a viewscape in many ways comparable to that of a lakefront residence.

50|$|Unfortunately, {{this very}} sharp {{switching}} {{on and off}} inherent to the square-waveform causes extremely high frequency vibrations in the lamp. A square wave {{can be thought of}} as an infinite sum of odd-numbered harmonics, which will include frequencies at the resonant frequency of the bulb, causing it to vibrate at that frequency like a bell or whistle. The <b>lamp</b> <b>housing</b> does not help this, acting as a resonating chamber that amplifies the noise and presents a problem for sync-sound recording for film and video. To correct this, most electronic ballasts are equipped with a silent mode that eliminates the higher frequencies, but rounds off the voltage transition, causing the same flicker issue with magnetics, though to a lesser extent. This mode provides safe, flicker-free filming at framerates up to 24 frame/s on most electronic ballasts.|$|R
