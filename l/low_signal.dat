25|$|The {{spectral}} sensitivity of CdS photoresistors peaks for red light (wavelength λ = 640nm) and extends up to 900nm. These devices can control a few mA, {{and have a}} quasilinear dependence of photocurrent on the light intensity at a constant voltage. Their high dark resistance, reaching tens GOhm, provides a high dynamic range {{with respect to the}} light intensity and <b>low</b> <b>signal</b> distortions. However, their reaction time to a change in the light intensity is long, about 140 ms at 25°C.|$|E
25|$|Morse code {{is usually}} heard at the {{receiver}} as a medium-pitched on/off audio tone (600–1000Hz), so transmissions {{are easier to}} copy than voice through the noise on congested frequencies, {{and it can be}} used in very high noise / <b>low</b> <b>signal</b> environments. The transmitted power is concentrated into a limited bandwidth so narrow receiver filters can be used to suppress interference from adjacent frequencies. The audio tone is usually created by use of a beat frequency oscillator.|$|E
25|$|A {{condenser}} microphone, {{also called}} a capacitor microphone or electrostatic microphone, is a microphone containing a capacitor that has two plates with a voltage between them. In the condenser microphone, {{one of these}} plates is made of very light material and acts as the diaphragm. The diaphragm vibrates when struck by sound waves, changing {{the distance between the}} two plates and therefore changing the capacitance. Specifically, when the plates are closer together, capacitance increases and a charge current occurs. When the plates are further apart, capacitance decreases and a discharge current occurs. A voltage is required across the capacitor for this to work. This voltage is supplied either by a battery in the mic or by external phantom power. The condenser microphone was invented in 1916 at Bell Laboratories by Edward Christopher 'E.C.' Wente, which became possible {{with the advent of the}} vacuum tube (valve) to act as an amplifier of the <b>low</b> <b>signal</b> output.|$|E

[...] However, many applications only require comparator outputs at certain instances, such as in A/D converters and memory. By only strobing a comparator at certain intervals, higher accuracy and lower power can be achieved with a clocked (or dynamic) comparator structure, also called a latched comparator. Often latched comparators employ strong positive feedback for a [...] "regeneration phase" [...] when a clock is high, and have a [...] "reset phase" [...] when the clock is low.|$|E
2500|$|RO is {{the first}} and the slowest opto-isolator: its {{switching}} time exceeds 1 ms, and for the lamp-based models can reach hundreds of milliseconds. Parasitic capacitance limits the frequency range of the photoresistor by ultrasonic frequencies. Cadmium-based photoresistors exhibit a [...] "memory effect": their resistance depends on the illumination history; it also drifts during the illumination and stabilizes within hours, or even weeks for high-sensitivity models. Heating induces irreversible degradation of ROs, whereas cooling to below −25°C dramatically increases the response time. Therefore, ROs were mostly replaced in the 1970s by the faster and more stable photodiodes and photoresistors. ROs are still used in some sound equipment, guitar amplifiers and analog synthesizers owing to their good electrical isolation, <b>low</b> <b>signal</b> distortion and ease of circuit design.|$|E

2500|$|In {{spite of}} all this capacity, EchoStar still needed to fulfill the dream of {{nationwide}} high-definition television and conceived the Dish 1000 system to receive signals from 110°W, 119°W, and 129°W orbital locations. Originally, Dish Network high-definition subscribers required two separate satellite dishes. Currently, Dish Network subscribers can receive nationwide HDTV channels using the 129°W orbital location or 61.5°W orbital location. Because of issues with <b>low</b> <b>signal</b> strength, the older model Dish 1000 has been replaced with the Dish 1000.2. The 1000.2 has a 10% larger reflector for better signal strength and an integrated LNB for easier installation. The Dish 1000.2 is [...] in diameter. Even with the larger size, {{there are still many}} reports of customers consistently losing signal on the 129°W orbital location. This has forced some customers to either use a 2nd separate Dish Network brand dish, or an aftermarket 30" [...] dish, aimed specifically at the 129°W orbital location. On several satellite related web support forums, customers have critically suggested that the new Dish 1000.2 wasn't nearly large enough and should have been 20–30% larger to properly deal with rain fade. [...] Later Dish Network took the approach of splitting the US into two regions. [...] Subscribers west of Chicago use Dish 1000.2 antennas aimed at the 110°W, 119°W, and 129°W orbital locations (referred to as the western arc). [...] Subscribers east of Chicago use Dish 1000.4 antennas aimed at the 61.5°W, 72°W and 77°W oribital locations (referred to as the eastern arc).|$|E

60|$|It {{seemed to}} Peter {{that he had}} sat there half the night, but really {{it was only a}} short time, before he heard a <b>low</b> <b>signal</b> out in the Black Shadows which covered the middle of the Big River. It was the voice of Honker. Then Peter saw little silvery lines moving on the water and {{presently}} a dozen great shapes appeared in the moonlight. Honker and his friends were swimming in. The long neck of each of those great birds was stretched to its full height, and Peter knew that each bird was listening for the slightest suspicious sound. Slowly they drew near, Honker in the lead. They were a picture of perfect caution. When they reached the sandy bar they remained quiet, looking and listening for some time. Then, sure that all was safe, Honker gave a <b>low</b> <b>signal</b> and at once a low gabbling began as the big birds relaxed their watchfulness and came out on the sandy bar, all save one. That one was the guard, and he remained with neck erect on watch. Some swam in among the rushes growing in the water very near to where Peter was sitting and began to feed. Others sat on the sandy bar and dressed their feathers. Honker himself came ashore close to where Peter was sitting.|$|E

The Bohemian, who conducted the other female, took the road straight for the postern which opened upon the moat, through the garden wall, close to which the little skiff Was drawn up, by means of which Quentin had formerly observed Hayraddin himself retreating from the castle.|$|E

40|$|Background {{thermal noise}} often becomes the {{limiting}} factor while detecting <b>low</b> <b>signals</b> of photon flux {{from a distant}} thermal source. This cannot be eliminated by simply cooling the photodetector. A general method is developed here to calculate the background thermal noise and the noise equivalent power (NEP) for background source temperature T, with any given frequency-dependent quantum efficiency function eta(v) for the photodetector. Applications of our analysis to some specific model forms of eta(v), with finite bandwidths, show that earlier calculations are highly inadequate for peak efficiency frequencies v(o) < k(B) T/h, where k(B) is the Boltzmann constant and h is the Planck constant. The NEP, which determines the limit on the <b>lowest</b> <b>signal</b> power that can be detected by any given photodetector, is much higher in these frequency regions compared to earlier approximate estimates...|$|R
60|$|Something {{was wrong}} in my call; the birds were suspicious, knowing not what danger had kept their fellows silent so long, and now {{threatened}} {{them out of the}} black alders. A moment's intent listening; then the leader stepped slowly down from his log and came towards me cautiously, halting, hiding, listening, gliding, swinging far out to one side and back again in stealthy advance, till he drew himself up abruptly at sight of my face peering out of the underbrush. For a long two minutes he never stirred so much as an eyelid. Then he glided swiftly back, with a faint, puzzled, questioning kwit-kwit? to where his flock were waiting. A <b>low</b> <b>signal</b> that I could barely hear, a swift movement--then the flock thundered away in scattered flight into the silent, friendly woods.|$|E
6000|$|However, {{do not let}} it be {{imagined}} that {{the path of the}} youthful swain was strewn with flowers. Courting or [...] "sparking" [...] his sweetheart had a painful as well as a joyous side. Many and varied were the tricks played on the fortunate lover by the gallants who had vied with him for the favor of the maid. Brave, indeed, he who won her. If he marched up to her home in the early evening he was made the object of innumerable jests, even the young lady's family indulging in and enjoying the banter. Later, when he come out of the door, it was more than likely that, if it were winter, he would be met by a volley of water soaked snowballs, or big buckets of icewater, or a mountain of snow shoved off the roof by some trickster, who had waited patiently for such an opportunity. On summer nights his horse would be stolen, led far into the woods and tied, or the wheels of his wagon would be taken off and hidden, leaving him to walk home. Usually the successful lover, and especially if he lived at a distance, would make his way only once a week and then late at night to the home of his betrothed. Silently, like a thief in the dark, he would crawl through the grass and shrubs until beneath her window. At a <b>low</b> <b>signal,</b> prearranged between them, she would slip to the door and let him in without disturbing the parents. Fearing to make a light, and perhaps welcoming that excuse to enjoy the darkness beloved by sweethearts, they would sit quietly, whispering low, until the brightening in the east betokened the break of day, and then he was off, happy and lighthearted, to his labors.|$|E
