40|$|The {{object of}} the {{invention}} {{is to provide a}} mechanical force actuator which is lightweight and manipulatable and utilizes linear motion for push or pull forces while maintaining a constant overall length. The mechanical force producing mechanism comprises a linear actuator mechanism and a <b>linear</b> motion <b>shaft</b> mounted parallel to one another. The <b>linear</b> motion <b>shaft</b> is connected to a stationary or fixed housing and to a movable housing where the movable housing is mechanically actuated through actuator mechanism by either manual means or motor means. The housings are adapted to releasably receive a variety of jaw or pulling elements adapted for clamping or prying action.

40|$|An {{autonomous}} anthropomorphic {{robotic arm}} was designed, fabricated and programmed for monitoring of plant tissue grown in a modified in vitro clonal plant propagation system {{being developed by}} The New Zealand Institute for Plant & Food Research. The custom fabricated aluminium robotic arm uses a vertical <b>linear</b> ball <b>shaft</b> and high speed stepper motors to provide arm joints movements enabling the arm to swivel 180 degrees horizontally. Sensors located {{at the end of}} the arm are used to monitor plant growth and the immediate growing environment. This includes a compact colour zoom camera on a pan and tilt mount for image capturing, red, green and blue (RGB) colour sensors to monitor leaf colour as well as temperature, relative humidity and carbon dioxide sensors. The robotic arm is capable of reaching over multiple trays (600 mm x 600 mm) of plantlets. Captured plant tissue images are processed using innovative algorithms to determine tissue or whole plant growth rates over specified time periods. Leaf colour sensors provide information on tissue health status when compared to predetermined optimum values. Custom software fully automates the operation of the arm and the data capture, allowing the arm to return to specified sites (i. e. individual plantlets) at set time intervals to identify subtle changes in growth rates and leaf colour. This allows plant nutrient levels and the immediate environment to be regularly adjusted in response to continuous sensing resulting in optimised rapid growth with minimal human input...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a methodology to synthesize a fuzzy controller to correct the tracking dynamics of the electromechanical positioning drive trajectory. A general framework about topologies in the field of linear electromechanical drives is presented. Special focus is made on parallel manipulators using tubular linear synchronous permanent magnet motors, where computer simulations confirmed large amplitude variations of load forces applied to linear actuators of the six degrees of freedom (6 DOF) parallel manipulator. The 6 DOF parallel manipulators are wide used for the support of the flight simulators, and are projected to emulate the aeronautic motions. The commercial 6 DOF parallel manipulators usually employ hydraulic linear actuators. The hydraulic linear actuators have bigger volume/power ratio than tubular linear synchronous motors and an expensive maintenance cost. The difficulties of these applications are {{in the absence of the}} trajectory planning, which is common in parallel manipulator applications. The fuzzy controller synthesis for the linear position drive is described. Its main goal is to perform the automatic adjustment of the tubular linear motor positioning trajectory, by changing its speed and acceleration references. The resulting motion trajectory obtained from the fuzzy controller is particularly suited to high accuracy applications such as parallels manipulators, robotics systems and factory automation. The electromechanical position drive present in this paper is based on Permanent Magnet Tubular Linear Synchronous Motor (PM-TLSM) as the electromechanical linear actuator fed by a position drive controller and a linear encoder as feedback device of the system. The structure of the laboratory prototype of the fuzzy controller coupled to the electromechanical linear position drive is presented. The experimental results demonstrate that the trajectory correction is made lower than 1 s. Comparing the experimental results with different loads, it is verified that the position errors values does not depend of the load force applied to the tubular <b>linear</b> motor <b>shaft.</b> The experimental results obtained are used to evaluate the performance of the fuzzy controller, which was able to reduce the positioning errors from 40 % to 10 %...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparison}} of space experiments with previous missions shows a common theme. Some {{of the recent}} experiments {{are based on the}} scientific fundamentals of instruments of prior years. However, the main distinguishing characteristic is the embodiment of advances in engineering and manufacturing in order to extract clearer and sharper images and extend the limits of measurement. One area of importance to future missions is providing vibration free observation platforms at acceptable costs. It has been shown by researchers that vibration problems cannot be eliminated by passive isolation techniques alone. Therefore, various organizations have conducted {{research in the area of}} combining active and passive vibration control techniques. The essence of this paper is to present progress in what is believed to be a new concept in this arena. It is based on the notion that if one active element in a vibration transmission path can provide a reasonable vibration attenuation, two active elements in series may provide more control options and better results. The paper presents the functions of a modular split <b>shaft</b> <b>linear</b> actuator developed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and University of Massachusetts Lowell. It discusses some of the control possibilities facilitated by the device. Some preliminary findings and problems are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{proposed}} paper {{deals with}} the development process and initial measurement results of an opposed-piston combustion engine for application in a Free-Piston Linear Generator (FPLG). The FPLG, which is being developed at the German Aerospace Center (DLR), is an innovative internal combustion engine for a fuel based electrical power supply. With its arrangement, the pistons freely oscillate between the compression chamber of the combustion unit and a gas spring with no mechanical coupling like a crank <b>shaft.</b> <b>Linear</b> alternators convert the kinetic energy of the moving piston into electric energy. The virtual development of the novel combustion system {{is divided into two}} stages: On the one hand, the combustion system including e. g. a cylinder liner, pistons, cooling and lubrication concepts has to be developed. On the other hand, 3 D-CFD-simulations are used in the early stage within the virtual development process toward the optimization of the geometry of the scavenging ports and ducts, the gas exchange, injection and ignition. With the high variability of the free piston concept, a strategy for a dual combustion mode operation with spark ignition and HCCI is developed. The new engine is constructed on and implemented at the hydraulic free-piston test bench at DLR and was successfully taken into operation. First measurement results show the engine behavior with dual spark ignition and two opposed injectors...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Largely due {{to their}} {{self-aligning}} and superior loading capabilities, spherical roller bearings have seen extensive application. Compared with the single-row deep-grooved-ball (DGB) bearing, the dynamics involved {{in the operation of}} double-row spherical roller bearings (SRBs) are much more complicated double-row SRBs have at least twice as many degrees of freedom (DoFs) as DGBs. Also, the contact forces between each one of a pair of rollers and the inner race/outer race can be different, resulting in unbalanced axial forces on the moving race and causing axial displacement and angular movements of the moving race. Due to its complexity, modeling efforts carried out so far have not included the effects of the rotational DoFs of the moving race. Aiming at improving the state of the art, a comprehensive dynamic model of SRBs is developed in this investigation. This model takes into account all the DoFs of the moving race, including the angular movements about both the vertical and horizontal axes. Subsequently, the contact angle between each individual roller and the moving race is correlated with each linear and rotational DoF of the moving race. The model developed in this investigation can quantitatively analyze the effects of <b>linear</b> and rotational <b>shaft</b> misalignments. Therefore, it provides guidelines for optimizing system installation requirements/procedure, which will be valuable for high-precision machine systems. The simulation results demonstrate that the rotational DoFs of the moving race have major effects on the force/displacement responses and thus {{should be included in the}} model for a more accurate assessment of the system performance. Extensive case studies are carried out to assess the effects of the loading conditions and radial clearance, as well as shaft misalignment...|$|R
40|$|The Western Australian soldier crab, Mictyris occidentalis Unno, {{spends most}} of its life cycle in- faunal in sandy tidal environments, and {{produces}} up to 16 different types of ichnological products: back-filled burrows, cavities, circular pustular structures, clots, craters, dactyl prints, discard pellets, eruption structures, excavation pellets, exit holes, hollow <b>shafts,</b> <b>linear</b> pustular structures, mat pustular structures, rosettes, scrape marks, and surface-parallel tunnels (with their floors and roofs). These {{are the result of}} the crabs working the sediment at different stages of their life cycle, whether or not they emerge, and their working of the sediment at different times of the tide. Soldier crabs have three phases to their ichnological behaviour corresponding to their life stages. Newly arrived recruits and juvenile crabs are cryptic, and develop sediment surfaces strewn with clots. Crabs in the early to middle stage of their life cycle also are cryptic, and develop subsurface cavities during high water, and subsurface cavities and sediment surfaces covered in pustular structures during low water. Adult crabs exhibit cryptic and emergent phases, and develop the most complex range of ichnological products - during high water, they form subsurface cavities, and during low water they develop cavities in the subsurface as well as sediment surfaces covered in pustular structures, exit holes, dactyl prints (sometimes), discard pellets, and rosettes. Mapping of crab activity and the boundaries of their workings at various scales shows there was a variability in crab behaviour as to whether adult crabs emerged or not, whether working of the sediment surface took place, where in the population emergences or subsurface workings took place, and in the subsurface whether the crabs were active or inactive. Similar variability in crab behaviour was observed in the aquarium. Our study showed a direct correlation between field and aquarium ichnological patterns, and the aquarium observations provided explanation of the field results...|$|R
