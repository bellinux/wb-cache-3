2500|$|In a July 2016 review, Jill Duffy of PC Magazine {{wrote that}} the {{interface}} was best described as [...] "simplicity", and criticized it for offering list and grid views that did not make finding information quick or easy. Adding that [...] "Most of my notes are text-based recipes, which are quite long", Duffy said the <b>list</b> <b>view</b> was [...] "even worse" [...] than the grid view as it only showed [...] "one note at a time, and it's the most recently edited note." [...] She {{wrote that the}} web interface was lacking in functionality present in the apps. The mobile apps offering to take a photo and run optical character recognition to have the scan turned into text {{was described as a}} [...] "shining star", with the comment [...] "It's an amazing feature, and it works very well". She also criticized the lack of formatting options, and that sharing options [...] "is possible but not very refined".|$|E

40|$|Abstract We {{present a}} {{separation}} logic specification and verification of linked <b>lists</b> with <b>views,</b> a data structure from the C 5 collection library for. NET. A view is a generalization of the well-known {{concept of an}} iterator. Linked <b>lists</b> with <b>views</b> form an interesting case study for verification since they allow mutation through multiple, possibly overlapping, views of the same underlying list. For modularity, we build on a fragment of higher-order separation logic and use abstract predicates to give a specification with respect to which clients can be proved correct. We introduce a novel mathematical model of <b>lists</b> with <b>views,</b> and formulate succinct modular abstract specifications of the operations on the data structure. To show that the concrete implementation realizes the specification, we use frac-tional permissions in a novel way to capture the sharing of data between views and their underlying list. We conclude by suggesting {{directions for future research}} that arose from conducting this case study...|$|R
