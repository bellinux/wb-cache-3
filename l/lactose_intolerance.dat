25|$|<b>Lactose</b> <b>intolerance</b> {{does not}} cause damage to the {{gastrointestinal}} tract. There are four types: primary, secondary, developmental, and congenital. Primary <b>lactose</b> <b>intolerance</b> is when the amount of lactase decline as people age. Secondary <b>lactose</b> <b>intolerance</b> is due to injury to the small intestine such as from infection, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, or other diseases. Developmental <b>lactose</b> <b>intolerance</b> may occur in premature babies and usually improves over {{a short period of}} time. Congenital <b>lactose</b> <b>intolerance</b> is an extremely rare genetic disorder in which little or no lactase is made from birth. When <b>lactose</b> <b>intolerance</b> is due to secondary lactase deficiency, treatment of the underlying disease allows lactase activity to return to normal levels. <b>Lactose</b> <b>intolerance</b> is different from a milk allergy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} the addition to milk, 5 min and 10 h before its consumption, of a lactase obtained from Kluyveromyces lactis in <b>lactose</b> malabsorbers with <b>intolerance.</b> DESIGN: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. SETTING: University Hospital. SUBJECTS: In total, 11 male and 19 female (aged from 18 to 65 y, mean age 43. 3 y) <b>lactose</b> malabsorbers with <b>intolerance</b> participated. INTERVENTIONS: Each patient underwent three H(2) breath tests, in a random order. We used 400 ml of cow's semiskimmed milk as substrate and a beta-galactosidase obtained from K. lactis. The test A was carried out adding to the milk the enzyme (3000 UI), 10 h before its consumption; the test B was performed adding the beta-galactosidase (6000 UI) 5 min before milk ingestion and the test C was made using placebo. We evaluated the maximum breath H(2) concentration, the cumulative H(2) excretion and a clinical score based on intolerance symptoms (bloating, abdominal pain, flatulence and diarrhoea). RESULTS: Our study showed a significant reduction of the mean maximum H(2) concentration after both test A (12. 07 +/- 7. 8 p. p. m.) and test B (13. 97 +/- 7. 99 p. p. m.) compared with test C (51. 46 +/- 16. 12 p. p. m.) (ANOVA F = 54. 33, P < 0. 001). Similarly, there was a significant reduction of the mean cumulative H(2) excretion after both test A (1428 +/- 1156 p. p. m.) and test B (1761 +/- 966 p. p. m.) compared with test C (5795 +/- 2707 p. p. m.) (ANOVA F = 31. 46, P < 0. 001). We also observed a significant reduction of the mean clinical score after both test A (0. 36 +/- 0. 55) and test B (0. 96 +/- 0. 85) compared with test C (3. 7 +/- 0. 79) (ANOVA F = 106. 81, P < 0. 001). Moreover, with regard to the mean clinical score, there was a significant reduction after test A with respect to test B (Bonferroni's P = 0. 03). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that in <b>lactose</b> malabsorbers with <b>intolerance,</b> the lactase obtained from K. lactis can represent a valid therapeutic strategy, with objective and subjective efficacy and without side effects...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite the {{reported}} tolerance {{to a low}} dose of lactose, many lactose malabsorbers follow a rigorous lactose-free diet also avoiding lactose-containing drugs. Up to now, only a few case reports have described the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms in lactose malabsorbers following the ingestion of these drugs. It {{has been suggested that}} capsules/tablets contain no more than 400 mg of lactose. AIM: To evaluate breath H(2) excretion and intolerance symptoms after ingestion of a capsule containing 400 mg of lactose or placebo through a randomized, cross-over, double-blind, controlled study. METHODS: Seventy-seven <b>lactose</b> maldigesters with <b>intolerance</b> underwent two H 2 breath tests with both 400 mg of lactose and 400 mg of placebo. Gastrointestinal symptoms occurring in the 8 h following the ingestion of different substrates were evaluated by a visual-analogue scale. RESULTS: Ingestion of 400 mg of lactose did not cause a significant difference in breath H 2 excretion or in the severity of gastrointestinal symptoms compared to placebo. CONCLUSION: In patients with lactase deficiency, drugs containing 400 mg of lactose or less can be used safely...|$|R
40|$|The results {{here are}} the first {{demonstration}} {{of a family of}} carbohydrate fermentation products opening Ca 2 + channels in bacteria. Methylglyoxal, acetoin (acetyl methyl carbinol), diacetyl (2, 3 butane dione), and butane 2, 3 diol induced Ca 2 + transients in Escherichia coli, monitored by aequorin, apparently by opening Ca 2 + channels. Methylglyoxal was most potent (K(1 / 2) = 1 mM, 50 mM for butane 2, 3 diol). Ca 2 + transients depended on external Ca 2 + (0. 1 - 10 mM), and were blocked by La 3 + (5 mM). The metabolites affected growth, methylglyoxal being most potent, blocking growth completely up to 5 h without killing the cells. But there was no affect on the number of viable cells after 24 h. These results were consistent with carbohydrate products activating a La 3 +-sensitive Ca 2 + channel, rises in cytosolic Ca 2 + possibly protecting against certain toxins. They have important implications in bacterial-host cell signalling, and where numbers of different bacteria compete for the same substrates, e. g., the gut in <b>lactose</b> and food <b>intolerance...</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Lactose</b> <b>intolerance</b> is {{distinct}} from milk allergy, an immune response to cow's milk proteins.

40|$|Background: One of {{the main}} problem health care systems are facis is the mis-use and over-use of medical {{resources}} (including useless exams, surgical interventions, medical treatments, screening procedures.) which may lead to high health care related costs without increased patients' benefit and possible harm to the patients themselves. The "Choosing wisely" campaign, in Italy denominated "Doing more does not mean doing better", tries to educate doctors and citizens at a correct use of medical resources. Methods: the Italian Society of Allergy, Asthma and Clinical Immunology (SIAAIC) adhered to the "Doing more does not mean doing better" campaing and {{made a list of}} the 5 allergological procedures with the highest evidence of inappropriateness. Results: the 5 recommendations were: "Do not perform allergy tests for drugs (including anhestetics) and/or foods when there are neither clinical history nor symptoms suggestive of hypersensitivity reactions"; "Do not perform the so-called "food intolerance tests" (apart from those which are validated for suspect celiac disease or <b>lactose</b> enzymatic <b>intolerance)</b> "; "Do not perform serological allergy tests (i. e. : total IgE, specific IgE, ISAC) as first-line tests or as "screening" assays"; "Do not treat patients sensitized to allergens or aptens if there is not a clear correlation between exposure to that specific allergen/apten and symptoms suggestive of allergic reaction"; "Do not diagnose asthma without having performed lung function tests". Conclusions: An important role scientific societies should play is to advise on correct diagnostic and therapeutical pathways. For this reason SIAAIC decided to adhere to the Slow Medicine Italy campaign "Doing more does not mean doing better" with the aim of warning the scientific community and the citizens/patients about some allergological procedures, which, when performed in the wrong clinical setting, may be not only useless, but unnecessarily expensive and even harmful for patients' health...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} {{efficacy of the}} innate immune defence via the mannose binding lectin (MBL) in a cohort of 55 dystonic patients prospectively referred to the clinic with laryngeal mucosal complaints, who were placed on local steroids (budesonid inhaler, 400  μg 2 times daily) and antihistamines (fexofenadin 180  mg mostly 3 times daily) with adjuvant lifestyle corrections. Treatment efficacy of the larynx was assessed based on mucosal findings of the vocal folds examined with phonatory function studies (PhFS) comprising simultaneous high-speed digital images, kymography, electroglottography and voice acoustics combined with a visual score of arytenoids oedema, as these measures are indicative {{of the magnitude of}} laryngitis. <b>Lactose</b> and gluten <b>intolerance</b> and immunological analyses of the innate system were made systematically. Results showed that the genetic aspects of immunology did not reveal a role for the innate immune system, represented by the MBL. But an unexpected positive effect of the larynx treatment on dystonia symptoms was found evidenced by reduction of dystonic complaints and more normative results of PhFS, and a reduction of oedema of the inter arytenoids region. Symptoms relieve and better quality of life was observed on follow-up for the dystonia complaints...|$|R
40|$|<b>Lactose</b> {{and food}} <b>intolerance</b> cause {{a wide range}} of gut and {{systemic}} symptoms, including gas, gut pain, diarrhoea or constipation, severe headaches, severe fatigue, loss of cognitive functions such as concentration, memory and reasoning, muscle and joint pain, heart palpitations, and a variety of allergies ([Matthews and Campbell, 2000], [Matthews et al., 2005] and [Waud et al., 2008]). These {{can be explained by the}} production of toxic metabolites from gut bacteria, as a result of anaerobic digestion of carbohydrates and other foods, not absorbed in the small intestine. These metabolites include alcohols, diols such as butan 2, 3 diol, ketones, acids, and aldehydes such as methylglyoxal ([Campbell et al., 2005] and [Campbell et al., 2009]). These ‘toxins’ induce calcium signals in bacteria and affect their growth, thereby acting to modify the balance of microflora in the gut ([Campbell et al., 2004], [Campbell et al., 2007 a] and [Campbell et al., 2007 b]). These bacterial ‘toxins’ also affect signalling mechanisms in cells around the body, thereby explaining the wide range of symptoms in people with food intolerance. This new mechanism also explains the most common referral to gastroenterologists, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and the illness that afflicted Charles Darwin for 50 years ([Campbell and Matthews, 2005 a] and [Campbell and Matthews, 2005 b]). We propose it will lead to a new understanding of the molecular mechanism of type 2 diabetes and some cancers...|$|R

25|$|In a {{hydrogen}} breath test, {{the most accurate}} <b>lactose</b> <b>intolerance</b> test, after an overnight fast, 25 grams of lactose (in a solution with water) are swallowed. If the lactose cannot be digested, enteric bacteria metabolize it and produce hydrogen, which, along with methane, if produced, can be detected on the patient's breath by a clinical gas chromatograph or compact solid-state detector. The test takes about 2.5 hours to complete. If the hydrogen levels in the patient's breath are high, they may have <b>lactose</b> <b>intolerance.</b> This test is not usually done on babies and very young children, because it can cause severe diarrhea.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lactose</b> <b>intolerance</b> {{generally}} develops {{later in}} life, but can present in young patients in severe cases. It {{is due to}} an enzyme deficiency (lactase) and not allergy, and occurs in many non-Western people.|$|E
25|$|Food {{intolerance}} are {{all other}} adverse reactions to food.

25|$|Regular {{consumption}} of dairy foods containing lactose can promote a colonic bacteria adaptation, enhancing a favorable microbiome, which allows people with primary lactase deficiency to diminish their intolerance and to consume more dairy foods. The way to induce tolerance {{is based on}} progressive exposure, consuming smaller amounts frequently, distributed throughout the day. <b>Lactose</b> <b>intolerance</b> can also be managed by ingesting live yogurt cultures containing lactobacilli {{that are able to}} digest the lactose in other dairy products. This may explain why many South Asians, though genetically lactose intolerant, are able to consume large quantities of milk without many symptoms of <b>lactose</b> <b>intolerance,</b> since consuming live yogurt cultures is very common among the South Asian population.|$|E

25|$|The {{diagnostic}} test, when used, {{is similar}} to that used to diagnose <b>lactose</b> <b>intolerance.</b> It is called a hydrogen breath test and is the method currently used for a clinical diagnosis. Nevertheless, some authors argue this test is not an appropriate diagnostic tool, because a negative result does not exclude a positive response to fructose restriction, implying a lack of sensitivity.|$|E
25|$|A {{deficiency}} in digestive enzymes {{can also cause}} some types of food intolerances. <b>Lactose</b> <b>intolerance</b> {{is a result of}} the body not producing sufficient lactase to digest the lactose in milk; dairy foods which are lower in lactose, such as cheese, are less likely to trigger a reaction in this case. Another carbohydrate intolerance caused by enzyme deficiency is hereditary fructose intolerance.|$|E
25|$|Secondary hypolactasia or {{secondary}} lactase deficiency, also called acquired hypolactasia or acquired lactase deficiency, {{is caused by}} an injury to the small intestine.

25|$|To aid {{digestion}} {{in those}} with <b>lactose</b> <b>intolerance,</b> milk with added bacterial cultures such as Lactobacillus acidophilus ("acidophilus milk") and bifidobacteria ("a/B milk") is available in some areas. Another milk with Lactococcus lactis bacteria cultures ("cultured buttermilk") often is used in cooking to replace the traditional use of naturally soured milk, which has become rare due to the ubiquity of pasteurization, which also kills the naturally occurring Lactococcus bacteria.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} people with <b>lactose</b> <b>intolerance</b> is unknown.
