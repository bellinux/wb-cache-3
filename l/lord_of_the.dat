5|$|A typical Robinsonade– a {{genre of}} fiction {{inspired}} by Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe– {{and one of}} the most popular of its type, the book first went on sale in late 1857 and has never been out of print. Among the novel's major themes are the civilising effect of Christianity, 19th-century British imperialism in the South Pacific, and the importance of hierarchy and leadership. It was the inspiration for William Golding's dystopian novel <b>Lord</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Flies (1954), which inverted the morality of The Coral Island; in Ballantyne's story the children encounter evil, but in <b>Lord</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Flies evil is within them.|$|E

50|$|Any {{association}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lords</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2nd, the 11th, the 5th, and the 9th bhavas, {{strong and}} mutually inclined, indicates gain <b>of</b> wealth. <b>The</b> <b>lords</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dhanasthana and the Labhasthana conjoining in a kendra and vested with strength confer much wealth which increases manifold by these bhava-lords simultaneously associating with <b>the</b> <b>lords</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two trikonas; the trikona-lords are significators of good-fortune, prosperity and great wealth. <b>The</b> <b>lords</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2nd and the 11th in favourable association with Jupiter make one very wealthy. <b>The</b> association <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bhava-lord and the bhava-karaka {{is essential in}} any yoga-formation for <b>the</b> sake <b>of</b> bringing out <b>the</b> best results signified by that bhava, both should be vested with requisite strength and be unafflicted. Moreover, a strong benefic planet occupying its exaltation sign in any one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> afore-stated bhavas makes one rich and prosperous. Ramanuja in his Bhavartha Ratnakara affirms that an exalted planet situated in the 5th or in the 9th house makes one exceptionally fortunate and famous; exalted planets promote <b>the</b> significances <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bhava they happen to occupy.

5|$|Consistent {{accounts}} of Saruman's earlier history appear in Appendix B to The <b>Lord</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rings, {{first published in}} The Return of the King, and in the posthumously published The Silmarillion (1977) and Unfinished Tales (1980). All were written in the mid-1950s. Saruman, like Gandalf and Radagast the Brown, {{is one of five}} 'wizards', known as the Istari, who begin to arrive in Middle-earth circa two thousand years before the beginning of The <b>Lord</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rings. They are Maiar, envoys of the godlike Valar sent to challenge Sauron by inspiring the people of Middle-earth rather than by direct conflict. Tolkien regarded them as being somewhat like incarnate angels. Saruman initially travels in the east; he is later appointed head of the White Council and eventually settles at Gondor's outpost of Isengard. Fifty years before The <b>Lord</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rings, after his studies reveal that the One Ring might be found in the river Anduin near Sauron's stronghold at Dol Guldur, he helps the White Council drive out Sauron in order to facilitate his search.|$|E
