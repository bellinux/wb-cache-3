Kageti is a good cop loose cannon who has to constantly deal with the aforementioned Chief. The Chief and Kageti both enjoy donuts but think that coffee tastes <b>like</b> <b>shit.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{frontman}} {{was more}} involved in the composition of Born Villain than he was for preceding records. Manson has said that this is a result of him beginning the project with a different mindset from that of his chief collaborator, Twiggy. He said he developed a [...] "clear idea" [...] of the album's direction early in its writing stages, which he was reluctant to share {{with other members of the}} band. He worked on the album in a minimally decorated apartment located above a liquor store in Downtown Los Angeles, which was once owned by actor Billy Zane and was the site where Manson created his first painting in 1996. The album contains seven songs which feature the vocalist as a composer, including three where he is listed as the sole writer. At the time of the album's release, Manson distanced himself from the approach he took when creating previous albums, explaining: [...] "On the last two records I made, I was trying to make people feel what I was feeling—which wasn't a good idea, because I was feeling <b>like</b> <b>shit.</b> Check mark number one: don't make records that make people feel bad." ...|$|E

5000|$|During {{the same}} interview, he also {{spoke about the}} album's three-part format, saying: [...] "I mean {{the name of the}} project is Dream.ZONE.Achieve. So I’m trying to give that feeling every time. The first act is Dream, that’s the process, the thought, {{everything}} going into doing what you want to do. So I'm basing that feeling on <b>shit</b> <b>like</b> 'Ghost Of Dipset,' 'City Of Dreams.' Then it goes into ZONE, the hustle, the motivation and that <b>shit</b> <b>like</b> 'Hearses.' That <b>shit</b> <b>like</b> 'Zone,' the joint I put out with CJ Fly. And then Achieve,you know, that’s the basking in the glory and everything else, reaping the benefits of what you do. That goes 'Tropicana Roses,' 'Errthang Valid,' 'Achieve,' the joint that Pete Rock did, so I tried to split up moods." ...|$|R

500|$|Love {{has played}} a variety of Fender guitars {{throughout}} her career, including a Jaguar and a vintage 1965 Jazzmaster; the latter was purchased by the Hard Rock Cafe and is on display in New York City. Love is seen playing her Jazzmaster in the music video for [...] "Miss World". Earlier in Hole's career, between 1989 and 1991, Love primarily played a Rickenbacker 425 because she [...] "preferred the 3/4 neck", but she destroyed the guitar onstage at a 1991 concert opening for The Smashing Pumpkins. In the mid-1990s, she often played a guitar made by Mercury, an obscure company that manufactured custom guitars, {{as well as a}} Univox Hi-Flier. Fender's Vista Venus, designed by Love in 1998, was partially inspired by Rickenbacker guitars as well as her Mercury. During her 2010 and more recent tours, Love {{has played a}} Rickenbacker 360 onstage. She has referred to herself as [...] "a shit guitar player", further commenting in a 2014 interview: [...] "I can still write a song, but [...] sounds <b>like</b> <b>shit...</b> I used to be a good rhythm player but I am no longer dependable." [...] Love's setup has included Fender tube gear, Matchless, Ampeg, Silvertone and a solid-state 1976 Randall Commander.|$|E
500|$|Timberlake {{described}} [...] "SexyBack" [...] as [...] "an experiment gone {{right from}} the sort of synthesizer influence to the distorted vocals", adding that it was [...] "one of the songs that the more you listen to it its just hook after hook after hook. Its {{just one of those}} 'flow off the top of your head' tracks, in terms of melody. We wanted to keep it loose and not too rehearsed, it's one of those very experimental records though." [...] Timberlake revealed that he went [...] "left", regarding going more rock, not in how he developed the song, but in the way he sang the song. [...] "I wanted to sing the song like a rock and roll singer, not an R singer. That's the approach." [...] The day before recording, Timberlake and Timbaland had listened to David Bowie's [...] "Rebel Rebel" [...] and the Rapture's [...] "House of Jealous Lovers". Timberlake wanted to achieve the songs' [...] "raw energy". Timberlake said that he modeled himself on Bowie and Prince, and described the song as Bowie and David Byrne [...] "covering" [...] James Brown's 1970 song [...] "Sex Machine". Timberlake said that the song [...] "doesn't qualify as rock or straight funk" [...] and that he was happy with the description [...] "club funk". He was [...] "keen for a new musical direction" [...] following the release of his first album, Justified. [...] "I listened to the radio for a few months and thought, 'All this sounds <b>like</b> <b>shit,</b> what do I want to hear?'. That's really all I did. Everything's [...] got so repetitive, everything sounds the same. I had to create something unique otherwise there's no point putting it out." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of his announcement, he was second on the team in minutes (30.8) behind Jordan Clarkson and leading the team with 16.7 field goal {{attempts}} per game, while averaging just 15.7 points and shooting a career-low 31.5 percent. His free throw attempts had dropped from his career average, and his game had become over-reliant on pump fakes and long-range shots, making a league-worst 19.5 percent from three-point range while attempting seven a game, almost double his career average. In his press conference after the announcement, he acknowledged his declining skills. [...] "Even though I play <b>like</b> <b>shit,</b> I’ve worked really, really hard not to play like crap and I do everything I possibly can. And I feel good about that", he said.|$|E
5000|$|Martin {{and fellow}} PKO member [...] "Magic" [...] Mark {{recorded}} a diss towards DJ Quik entitled San Antonio Ain't <b>Shit</b> <b>Like</b> Compton {{in response to}} Jus Lyke Compton, a track on which DJ Quik compared San Antonio to Compton. The track San Antonio Ain't <b>Shit</b> <b>Like</b> Compton appeared on 1994's Tha Good, Tha Bad, Tha Mafia.|$|R
5000|$|The {{song was}} parodied by Self {{on the album}} Feels <b>Like</b> Breakin' <b>Shit</b> with a track titled [...] "Titanic". The chorus mimics [...] "Gigantic" [...] with [...] "Titanic, Titanic, Titanic / A big, big boat".|$|R

2500|$|Most {{songs of}} the album exceed nine minutes, {{but there are two}} {{instrumental}} songs of short duration. These two instrumental songs are [...] "Silhouette" [...] and [...] "Requiem". The first song was recorded just hours before they were leaving the studio and is a brief piano interlude. They were impressed that Anders Nordin played the piano very well. Lindgren said, [...] "I remember the look on Dan's face when we said, 'Our drummer can play the piano.' He didn't believe a word we were saying. Dan can play the piano. Most guys play <b>like</b> <b>shit.</b> When Anders started playing, Dan was actually impressed." [...] Åkerfeldt later said, [...] "I'm still quite impressed." [...] The other instrumental is an acoustic epic, according to Lindgren. Åkerfeldt borrowed a Spanish acoustic guitar called a Trameleuc from a guitar store to play the song.|$|E
2500|$|Vietnam Inc. {{had a major}} {{influence}} on American perceptions of the war, and became a classic of photojournalism. The book was the result of Griffiths' work between 1966 and 1971 in the country, and it stands {{as one of the most}} detailed surveys of any conflict. It includes critical descriptions of the horrors of the war as well as a study of Vietnamese rural life, and views from serving American soldiers. Probably one of its most quoted passages is of a US army source discussing napalm: 'We sure are pleased with those backroom boys at Dow. The original product wasn't so hot – if the gooks were quick they could scrape it off. So the boys started adding polystyrene – now it sticks <b>like</b> <b>shit</b> to a blanket. But if the gooks jumped under water it stopped burning, so they started adding Willie Peter (white phosphorus) so's to make it burn better. And just one drop is enough, it'll keep on burning right down to the bone so they die anyway from phosphorus poisoning.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Recording {{sessions}} {{began in}} late 1994, and proceeded midway through 1995 in RZA's basement studio in Staten Island, the same studio {{that many of}} the group's earlier albums were recorded in. In regard to Raekwon and Ghostface Killah's original recording intentions, RZA recounted [...] "They had wanted to go to Barbados. But when they got to Barbados, the racism was so crazy. It was on some slave mentality. The Blacks was being treated <b>like</b> <b>shit.</b> They stopped back, and everything was recorded in my basement. No engineer, no assistant engineer. I did everything on that shit. The only two albums I did with nobody fucking with me was Linx and Liquid Swords. I was on a mission. To make all those early albums took {{three and a half years}} of my life. I didn't come outside, didn't have too many girl relations, didn't even enjoy the shit. I just stayed in the basement. Hours and hours and days and days. Turkey burgers and blunts. I didn't know if it was working. But nobody could hear or say nothing, no comments, no touching the board when I leave. Everything was just how I wanted it." [...] Regarding the recording atmosphere, Raekwon stated [...] "The way RZA had it poppin' back then, we would come into his spot. It was like dudes would come in on their own time and create stuff. I remember I just came in, and the beats was just pumpin'." ...|$|E
5000|$|During the session, Sumlin made a {{point of}} waiting {{for the two of them}} to be alone before saying to Petit [...] "I’ll tell you {{something}} Steve…you can play! You can not only play, but, if a lot of people could play <b>like</b> you, <b>shit,</b> I’d sit back and smile." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{majority}} of the press had disappeared so far up the Old Firm's arses that they could never be objective about English-based players and the Scottish Football Association(SFA) often treated us <b>like</b> the <b>shit</b> on their shoes." [...] McLintock was heavily criticised by the Scottish press after many of his nine caps.|$|R
5000|$|The {{album was}} {{followed}} in 1996 by The Half-Baked Serenade, an album released exclusively through a mail order catalog, and in 1997, an album released for free via the Internet called Feels <b>Like</b> Breakin' <b>Shit.</b> Around this time, bassist Timm Nobles {{was replaced by}} Mac Burrus, formerly of Murfreesboro rock band The Plain.|$|R

50|$|Shit can comfortably {{stand in}} for the terms bad and {{anything}} in many instances (Dinner was good, but the movie was shit. You're all mad at me, but I didn't do shit!).

I'm shit out of luck usually refers {{to someone who is}} at the end of their wits or who has no remaining viable options.
