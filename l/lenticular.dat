40|$|The {{progress}} of the studies on the orientation of galaxies in the Local Supercluster (LSC) is reviewed and a summary of recent results is given. Following a brief introduction of the LSC, we describe the results of early studies based on two-dimensional analysis, which were mostly not conclusive. We describe next the three-dimensional analysis, which is used widely today. Difficulties and systematic effects are explained {{and the importance of}} selection effects is described. Then, results based on the new method and modem databases are given, which are summarized as follows. When the LSC is seen as a whole, galaxy planes tend to align perpendicular to the LSC plane with <b>lenticulars</b> showing the most pronounced tendency. Projections onto the LSC plane of the spin vectors of Virgo cluster member galaxies, and to some extent, those of the total LSC galaxies, tend to point to the Virgo cluster center. This tendency is more pronounced for <b>lenticulars</b> than for spirals. It is suggested that &# 39;field&# 39; galaxies, i. e., those which do not belong to groups with more than three members, may be better objects than other galaxies to probe the information at the early epoch of the LSC formation through the analysis of galaxy orientations.

40|$|In this study, a novel autostereoscopic 3 D display design {{based on}} our patent {{specification}} is proposed and demonstrated.

As a consequence, the low magnification factor reduces distance errors from relative movements of display panel and image splitter. An image processing algorithm was developed to arrange the content and correct display shortcomings of image allocation caused by optical properties of the <b>lenticulars.</b> In addition, this algorithm allows static adjustment and tracking of observer position in a defined area in front of the display.

5|$|When {{the amount}} of copper in the liver overwhelms the {{proteins}} that normally bind it, it causes oxidative damage through {{a process known as}} Fenton chemistry; this damage eventually leads to chronic active hepatitis, fibrosis (deposition of connective tissue) and cirrhosis. The liver also releases copper into the bloodstream that is not bound to ceruloplasmin. This free copper precipitates throughout the body but particularly in the kidneys, eyes and brain. In the brain, most copper is deposited in the basal ganglia, particularly in the putamen and globus pallidus (together called the <b>lenticular</b> nucleus); these areas normally participate in the coordination of movement as well as playing a significant role in neurocognitive processes such as the processing of stimuli and mood regulation. Damage to these areas, again by Fenton chemistry, produces the neuropsychiatric symptoms seen in Wilson's disease.|$|E
5|$|Coma Berenices {{contains}} the northern {{portion of the}} Virgo Cluster (also known as the Coma–Virgo Cluster), about 60 million light-years away. The portion includes five Messier galaxies. M85 (NGC 4382), considered elliptical or <b>lenticular,</b> {{is one of the}} cluster's brighter members at magnitude nine. M85 is interacting with the spiral galaxy NGC 4394 and the elliptical galaxy MCG-3-32-38. M88 (NGC 4501) is a multi-arm spiral galaxy seen at about 30° from edge-on. It has a highly-regular shape with well-developed, symmetrical arms. Among the first galaxies recognized as spiral, it has a supermassive black hole in its center. M91 (NGC 4548), a barred spiral galaxy with a bright, diffuse nucleus, is the faintest object in Messier's catalog at magnitude 10.2. M98 (NGC 4192), a bright, elongated spiral galaxy seen nearly edge-on, appears elliptical because of its unusual angle. The magnitude-10 galaxy has no redshift. M99 (NGC 4254) is a spiral galaxy seen face-on. Like M98 it is of magnitude-10 and has an unusually long arm on its west side. M100 (NGC 4321), a magnitude-nine spiral galaxy seen face-on, is one of the cluster's brightest. Photographs reveal a brilliant core, two prominent spiral arms, an array of secondary arms and several dust lanes.|$|E

50|$|There is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that Hubble believed incorrectly that the tuning fork diagram described an evolutionary sequence for galaxies, from elliptical galaxies through <b>lenticulars</b> to spiral galaxies.

40|$|Abridged) We present morphological, photometric, {{kinematic}} and line-strength data of 48 early-type {{members of}} the rich cluster Abell 2218 at z= 0. 18. This sample is both larger and spans a wider galaxy luminosity range, down to M*_B+ 1, than previous studies. We compare A 2218 with similar samples drawn from local clusters to identify evolutionary changes between the samples which have occured over the last 3 Gyrs. The overall picture is one of little or no evolution in nearly all galaxy parameters. Zeropoint offsets in the Faber [...] Jackson, Mg_b-sigma and Fundamental Plane relations are all consistent with passively evolving stellar populations. The slopes of these relations have not changed significantly. We do however find a significant spread in the estimated luminosity-weighted ages of the stellar populations in the galaxies, based on line diagnostic diagrams. This age spread is seen in both the disky early-type galaxies (S 0) and also the ellipticals. We observe both ellipticals with a strong contribution from a young stellar population and <b>lenticulars</b> dominated by old stellar populations. On average, we find no evidence for systematic differences between the populations of ellipticals and <b>lenticulars.</b> This points to a common formation epoch {{for the bulk of}} the stars in most of the early-type galaxies in A 2218. This result can be reconciled with the claims of rapid morphological evolution in distant clusters if the suggested transformation from spirals to <b>lenticulars</b> does not involve significant new star formation.

NGC 625 is a dwarf irregular galaxy of apparent magnitude 11.0 and lying some 12.7 million light years distant. Only 24000 light years in diameter, it is an outlying member of the Sculptor Group. NGC 625 is thought to have been involved in a collision and is experiencing a burst of active star formation. NGC 37 is a <b>lenticular</b> galaxy of apparent magnitude 14.66. It is approximately 42 kiloparsecs (137,000 light-years) in diameter and about 12.9 billion years old.

It is thought to be a remnant of a dwarf galaxy that was absorbed in a collision with ESO 243-49. Before its discovery, this class of black hole was only hypothesized.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} classifications of beads {{common to the}} Swahili coastal {{settlements}} {{that have been found}} at Gedi. In his examination of beads found at Gedi and the Limpopo Valley (Mapungubwe), Schofield placed beads into three categories: red, blue, green, and yellow cylinders made from cane glass; smaller black, red, green, yellow, and blue biconical and <b>lenticular</b> beads made from wound glass; and spheres of red, black, and yellow pressed glass. Kirkman similarly created eight classifications of beads. All but 25 of the 558 beads categorized as class 1–3 were made from opaque glass. During his excavations at Gedi, Kirkman recovered 631 beads in six stratigraphic layers. Monochrome yellow, green, and black wound and pressed glass beads formed in melon, biconical, globular, barrel, and cylindrical shapes were the most common styles represented in strata from the fourteenth century and sporadically appeared in later levels. Small drawn cane glass beads are also commonly represented in fourteenth and fifteenth century levels with the colors green, opaque red, yellow, and black occurring more frequently than blue, brown, and red. It is believed that Islamic traders brought the majority of glass beads to East Africa, which were traded across the continent, since there is no evidence for local production or trade south or west of Egypt and Nubia {{with the exception of a}} site in Igbo Olokun Grove at Ile-Ife in southern Nigeria.|$|E

40|$|I was one {{of seven}} designer/makers {{commissioned}} to make work for the group show ‘Out of the Ordinary’, at the V&A, {{in conjunction with the}} Crafts Council. The exhibition highlighted makers and designers who push the boundaries of what craft is. My installation challenged traditional ways of showing contemporary craft, and also married craft with design, by presenting my conceptual ideas in multi media and consumable forms. Rather than adorning the body with jewellery, I transformed the museum space with traces of the body, appealing to the senses of vision, taste and hearing. My installation consisted of five elements: sound, objects, <b>lenticulars,</b> film and chocolate masks. A small film loop of my face was set into the wall at eye level. It recorded changes of expression as I talked, smiled, frowned. Fragments of these facial expressions were captured on chocolate lollipops in the shop: a frown, a wink or a smirk was sold as edible expressions. In the gallery space, hidden speakers transmitted the sounds of breathing, clearings one’s throat and swallowing. Glass balls suspended from the ceiling enveloped isolated body parts (a development from the Alexander McQueen pieces, see output 1). A group of <b>lenticulars</b> showed a model turning 360 degrees wearing some of the glass balls. As the viewer circles them the image changes and different things are revealed. My initial process started with sketches, photographs and body casts; I then worked collaboratively with specialists to produce these objects. The <b>lenticulars</b> are illustrated and written about in the exhibition catalogue. Although not a new form, I used them in a new way.

25|$|The {{kinematic}} {{connection between}} spiral and <b>lenticular</b> galaxies is most clear when analyzing the Tully–Fisher relation for spiral and <b>lenticular</b> samples. If <b>lenticular</b> galaxies are an evolved stage of spiral galaxies {{then they should}} have a similar Tully–Fisher relation with spirals, but with an offset in the luminosity / absolute magnitude axis. This would result from brighter, redder stars dominating the stellar populations of lenticulars. An example of this effect {{can be seen in the}} adjacent plot. One can clearly see that the best-fit lines for the spiral galaxy data and the <b>lenticular</b> galaxy have the same slope (and thus follow the same Tully–Fisher relation), but are offset by ΔI ≈ 1.5. This implies that <b>lenticular</b> galaxies were once spiral galaxies but are now dominated by old, red stars.|$|E

25|$|The {{kinematics}} of disk {{galaxies are}} usually determined by Hα or 21-cm emission lines, which are typically {{not present in}} <b>lenticular</b> galaxies due to their general lack of cool gas.

There is also {{a considerable amount of}} difficulty in deriving accurate rotational velocities for <b>lenticular</b> galaxies. This is a combined effect from lenticulars having difficult inclination measurements, projection effects in the bulge-disk interface region, and the random motions of stars affecting the true rotational velocities. These effects make kinematic measurements of <b>lenticular</b> galaxies considerably more difficult compared to normal disk galaxies.|$|E

40|$|Differential K-band {{luminosity}} functions (LFs) {{are presented}} {{for a complete}} sample of 1613 nearby bright galaxies segregated by visible morphology. The LF for late-type spirals follows a power law that rises towards low luminosities whereas the LFs for ellipticals, <b>lenticulars</b> and bulge-dominated spirals are peaked and decline toward both higher and lower luminosities. Each morphological type (E, S 0, S 0 /a-Sab, Sb-Sbc, Sc-Scd) contributes approximately equally to the overall K-band luminosity density of galaxies in the local universe. Type averaged bulge/disk ratios are used to subtract the disk component leading to the prediction that the K-band LF for bulges is bimodal with ellipticals dominating the high luminosity peak, comprising 60 % of the bulge luminosity density in the local universe with the remaining 40 % contributed by <b>lenticulars</b> and the bulges of spirals. Overall, bulges contribute 30 % of the galaxy luminosity density at K in the local universe with spiral disks making up the remainder.

These galaxies are generally red and quiescent, although the distribution contains a tail of blue star-forming galaxies and also shows evidence of dust. The intermediate-type galaxies have higher apparent ellipticities than either disc or elliptical galaxies, most likely {{because some of the}} face-on intermediate types are misidentified as ellipticals. Their physical half-light radii are smaller than the radii of either the disc or elliptical galaxies, which may be evidence that they form from disc fading.
