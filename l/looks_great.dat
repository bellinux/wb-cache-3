Sarah Arthur, the series' costume designer, explained how she achieved the detective's look. [...] "Holmes wouldn't {{have any interest in}} fashion so I went for classic suits with a modern twist: narrow-leg trousers and a two-button, slim-cut jacket. I also went for slim-cut shirts and a sweeping coat for all the action scenes—it <b>looks</b> <b>great</b> against the London skyline." ...|$|E

[...] set up like a digital clock, but it's huge, it's this monstrous thing-like 25 feet tall and who knows how long. I get to hold a flare, which was pretty cool.

500|$|Andy Hunsaker of Crave Online said, [...] "Agent Carter {{is a fun}} treat {{which could}} lead the way for some female-led Marvel films and, if nothing else, it gives its title {{character}} the send-off she deserves." [...] Scott Collura of IGN said, [...] "Atwell's Carter is the big-screen female superhero we've all been waiting for. She kicks so much ass in this short story with such aplomb, using not just brawn but also brains, and it's all very clever and fun." [...] Rosie Fletcher of Total Film said, [...] "Atwell makes a perfect femme fatale-come-special agent, and this '40s noir-style short <b>looks</b> <b>great</b> and packs some euphoric action moments." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{performances}} of the lead characters were generally praised, especially Basset's. In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin said that [...] "Mr. Fiennes gleefully captures Lenny's sleaziness while also showing {{there is something about}} this schlockmeister that is worth saving, despite much evidence to the contrary. As for Ms. Bassett, she <b>looks</b> <b>great</b> and radiates inner strength even without the bone-crunching physical feats to which she is often assigned." [...] Similarly, Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called Strange Days Bigelow's [...] "magnum opus", and added, [...] "In a film of striking performances, Bassett's is the standout—she is fierce, funny and heart rending". In contrast, Sizemore and Lewis were considered miscast in their roles. At the 22nd Saturn Awards, Bassett won Best Actress and Bigelow became the first woman to win the Best Director award.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} received mainly positive {{reviews from}} critics. In October 2000 Howard Rosenberg commented [...] "If pouty faces and sexy walks could destroy, the highly arresting Max would be wiping {{out the entire}} planet. It's actually quite moving. And she <b>looks</b> <b>great</b> on her bike." [...] Hal Boedeker from the Orlando Sentinel gave a positive review of Max, and compared her skills to those of Catwoman, Xena, Emma Peel and Wonder Woman. Time commented favorably on Alba's physical skills portraying Max, though stated she had [...] "an emotional range unusual among action babes." [...] Conversely, Joyce Millman said [...] "Cameron and Eglee give us very little incentive to care about Max as a person, the way we care about Buffy or Faith. And that's because Max {{is little more than}} lips and ass and a premise reminiscent of other, better shows". In December 2000 People listed Alba's portrayal of Max as among the breakthrough performances of 2000.|$|E

500|$|For {{decades after}} the film's {{theatrical}} release, copies of The Brute Man were unavailable, and it became regarded as a lost film. However, the film was eventually discovered and mass-produced by Admit One, a home video distribution company that focused specifically on lesser-known B films. The Brute Man was first released on Betamax and VHS in 1982 by Admit One. It has been reissued on VHS several times since then, and was released on laserdisc format in 1990. The Brute Man was most recently released on VHS by Image Entertainment in 1999, a year which also marked the first DVD release of the film, also by Image Entertainment. In his 2004 DVD guide book, Douglas Pratt complimented both the picture and sound transfers of the 1999 DVD release: [...] "The picture <b>looks</b> <b>great.</b> There are a couple shots where a few speckles pop up, {{but much of the}} time the image is clean, with deep blacks and sharp, finely graded contrasts." [...] An inexpensive DVD version was also released in 2006 by Cheezy Flicks Entertainment, Inc., which primarily markets B films.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Villagomez of Out {{wrote that}} the product {{placement}} seen throughout the video is nothing new, complimented Spears confidence and sex appeal, and that Spears [...] "gives Lana Del Rey a run for her money with a spy-like updo." [...] The Huffington Post journalist Jessica Misener wrote that despite Spears' outfits in the video were [...] "sizzling hot", that [...] "er blonde hair <b>looks</b> <b>great</b> and her body is amazing, and you know we love her oodles of gold bling," [...] {{and that it was}} the [...] "hottest Britney music video look" [...] since [...] "Toxic" [...] (2004). Yahaira Toribio of Terra called the video will.i.am's [...] "high-end technological wonderland" [...] and wrote that [...] "for all the choreography going on in this clip...all we get is [...] standing and sitting pretty." [...] Idolator's Sam Lansky wrote that he was unsatisfied, and that the video [...] "is more boundary-testing than the audio, it's all the things you'd expect: Futuristic, with some unsubtle product placement and a lot of ostensibly cool effects. Cool cars! Speakers! Will.i.am wearing a hat that says [...] "KING"! We’d hoped for more." ...|$|E
500|$|At San Diego Comic-Con 2016, Marvel's Chief Creative Officer Joe Quesada debuted {{the first}} trailer for Legion at his [...] "Cup O'Joe" [...] panel. Response to the trailer was positive, {{particularly}} its unique tone and visuals. Jacob Kastrenakes of The Verge described the trailer as eclectic, while Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone called it manic. Kelly West at Cinema Blend called the trailer [...] "all kinds of weird... {{in a good}} way", and positively compared it to a mix of Fight Club, Mr. Robot, and The Matrix. At New York Comic-Con later that year, the series held its own panel. Hawley, Loeb, Donner, and the series' main cast members were present to promote the series and screen {{the first half of}} the pilot episode. In response to the footage, Deadline.com's Dominic Patten said [...] "we know three things for sure about Legion, it <b>looks</b> <b>great,</b> has top notch pacing and a killer choice of music." [...] Nick Romano, recapping the panel for Entertainment Weekly, called the footage [...] "just as chaotic as the mind of David Haller" [...] and [...] "almost Kubrickian in nature". [...] "Based on what was screened," [...] Romano added, [...] "Legion already seems to have an erratic, hallucinatory tone and style that we’ve never seen before from a superhero TV series." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on DVD in the US [...] on November 23, 1999, with a VHS release initially for rental services only, such as Blockbuster. A traditional retail VHS release followed on May 16, 2000. The DVD contained three theatrical trailers for special features, which many criticized as being typical of [...] "bare-bones" [...] DVD releases. There is also a NTSC laserdisc version that {{was released on}} January 18, 2000; copies are extremely rare. The film was re-released on Blu-ray on June 30, 2009 in celebration of its decade-long anniversary. The film's 1080p AVC encode (at [...] ) {{was taken from the}} original film source as well with random audio sync issues, despite the fact the film was animated entirely digitally. IGN's Scott Lowe explained, [...] "Although clearly aged, South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut <b>looks</b> <b>great</b> and is free of the washed out, compressed imperfections of previous standard definition releases of the film." [...] However, Michael Zupan of DVDTalk notes that an automatic digital scratch removal process may have inadvertently removed some intentional lines from the picture, notably during Cartman's first scene with the V-chip. The disc contained a full-length audio commentary from Parker and Stone, as well as other crew members though most of them had no recollection of making the film due to heavy scheduling.|$|E
500|$|Smith {{has been}} married four times. In 1961, she married Jerry Smith, a ferroanalyst at the Inter-Lake Iron Corporation in Beverly, Ohio. They had one child {{together}} on March 9, 1963, named Darren Justin. (In the late 1970s, Darren went to Europe to become a missionary; he is currently a psychologist.) In the mid-1960s, the couple divorced and Smith married the guitarist in her touring band, Jack Watkins. They had a son, Kerry Watkins, before separating nearly a year after marrying. Shortly afterward, Smith married telephone repairman Marshall Haynes. In the early 1970s, Haynes frequently toured with Connie on her road show. The couple had three daughters: Jeanne, Julie, and Jodi Haynes. After divorcing Haynes in the early 1990s, Smith stated {{that she would never}} marry again, but on July 8, 1997 Smith married country artist Marty Stuart. They met while writing songs for Smith's 1998 comeback album. Twenty-six years before, Stuart had first encountered her after attending her concert: [...] "I met Connie when I was 12 years old. She came to the Indian reservation in my hometown to work at a fair. She hasn't changed a bit. She looked great then and she <b>looks</b> <b>great</b> now." [...] Smith accounts for the fact they have sustained their marriage as follows: [...] "Make the Lord the center … and commit." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout dinner, Will is {{hostile to}} Rachel. Will, like Monica, {{has lost a}} great deal of weight since high school and <b>looks</b> <b>great.</b> When Will keeps {{ignoring}} her advances and is continuously hostile, he reveals that she was horrible to him in high school. Will also eventually reveals that during high school, he and Ross initiated the episode's titular rumor: that Rachel is a hermaphrodite, which was spread throughout their entire high school, and {{even went so far as}} to reach Chandler's high school. Rachel reacts tearfully, claiming she never hurt Ross in high school, until Monica reminds her that she started a rumor of her own that Ross made out with the school's 50-year-old librarian, though Ross shockingly reveals that this is in fact true, much to everyone's amusement and disgust. Monica comforts Rachel, saying that despite the rumor, she was still the most popular girl in their high school and reminds Ross that due to his rumor, he was 'put on the map' in the school. She then reminds Ross and Rachel that they are having a baby together and that some things are more important than high school. Will feels betrayed that Ross had a relationship with Rachel but then that turns to a high five when he discovers that Ross [...] "knocked her up but did not marry her." [...] Ultimately the characters settle their differences. The episode culminates in Joey finishing off the turkey wearing Phoebe's-turned-Rachel's maternity pants and getting the meat sweats. After being extremely full, Joey still had room for pie.|$|E

40|$|People often {{joke about}} the {{certainty}} of death and taxes. Astronomers can add another certainty to that short list: Sooner or later someone will ask, “What {{do you think about}} the possibility of life out there?” Most questioners are looking for a particular answer. Science fiction novels, The Planetary Society, and countless movies, from E. T. to Contact to Planet of the Apes, suggest that extraterrestrial life is a given and help conjure images of how that life looks. To answer questions about such life takes as much diplomacy as answering my wife when she asks, “How do I look?” Experience suggests a strategy for handling both questions. Step one: Make a positive statement, such as “You <b>look</b> <b>great!</b> ” or “That’s a great question! ” Step two: Provide amplification. This part is trickier. It can make or break the interaction. If it lacks sincerity or includes the word but, (e. g., “You <b>look</b> <b>great,</b> but I thought you were going to wear the blue dress”), my wife may walk away feeling hurt and deflated. A better answer adds some specific feedback (e. g., “You <b>look</b> <b>great,</b> and I especially like the way that color goes with your eyes”) ...|$|R
500|$|People writer Chuck Arnold {{wrote that}} Spears [...] "never really hit her old stride [...] {{there was a}} lot more {{strutting}} than real choreographic feats from [...] ". Jeff Montgomery of MTV both praised and dismissed Spears's performance saying, [...] "Yes, welcome to Britney's Circus, a big, huge, loud, funny, nonsensical three-ring affair... She <b>looks</b> <b>great</b> in her myriad of outfits, and she can still move with the best of them. [...] It's just, well, she's almost lost in the sheer hugeness of the production around her". Jane Stevenson of Toronto Sun gave Spears's performance three out of five stars stating there was [...] "so much was going on– there were also martial artists, bicyclists, etc.– there was no time to really assess Spears other than to note that she looked great. [...] She could lip-synch the words (one can assume) and strut around the stage well enough, but there was little in the way of genuine passion, joy, or excitement on her part". The Hollywood Reporters Craig Rosen claimed that [...] "in the end, Britney and company delivered an entertaining spectacle, but one couldn't help but wish that she would strip it all down and show a little more of herself". Sean Daly of St. Petersburg Times summed up all the reviews by stating, [...] "When Britney, touring behind her new Circus album, plays the Times Forum, there will be as many people rooting for her success as her failure. [...] But in the end, we're all envious and thankful, jealous and applauding. We like them/us and hate them/us for the very same reasons".|$|E
500|$|Evan Valentine, {{writing for}} Collider.com, gave the episode a [...] "good" [...] rating of 3 stars out of 5, {{saying that the}} series [...] "certainly {{benefits}} somewhat from taking a page from" [...] Daredevil and Jessica Jones, highlighting the number of more mature elements in the episode's opening as [...] "a nice introduction that shows you this may not exactly be the same show you’ve gotten to know over the years." [...] Valentine called Robbie Reyes [...] "satisfactory" [...] and the Ghost Rider [...] "where things really shined"; [...] "ABC pretty much nail the look , and while he's obviously been tweaked to more accurately portray this new interpretation of the Spirit of Vengeance, he <b>looks</b> <b>great</b> in motion all the same ... his car has a particularly cool scene where it transforms mid air and lands in a fiery blast." [...] He called the Ghost Rider/Quake fight a highlight, and the latter's health issues [...] "an interesting twist". He concluded saying, [...] "the show still has all the flaws and strengths that [...] is known for ... if you're looking to rejoin your favorite agents for another solid romp with the added twist of throwing Ghost Rider into the mix, this one's for you." [...] Marc Buxton, also of Den of Geek, gave the episode 3.5 stars out of 5, calling it [...] "a fun way {{to kick off the}} new season". He criticized the Ghost Rider transformation scene as [...] "way too CGI cartoony" [...] and negatively compared it to Grimm, but otherwise said that [...] "Ghost Rider feels right" [...] and much improved over the Nicolas Cage Ghost Rider films. He also criticized the opening shots of Johnson, calling them [...] "misogynistic" [...] and saying, [...] "Seriously Marvel, you’re better than that." ...|$|E
500|$|Nikita and Maggie Q's {{portrayal}} of the character was met with generally positive reactions from television critics. Nikita was included in TV Guides lists of [...] "TV's Sexiest Crime Fighters" [...] and [...] "TV's Toughest Ladies". Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times felt that Q was suited for the role, stating [...] "she has a solemn, exotic beauty and hauteur that echo the heroine's self-possession and cool relentlessness," [...] adding [...] "Nikita is noticeably more hard-boiled and less girlish than the undercover agent played by Jennifer Garner on Alias, or the C.I.A. rookie that Piper Perabo plays on Covert Affairs." [...] Troy Patterson of Slate felt that [...] "Ms. Q's Nikita is only half so crush-worthy as Bionic Woman's Jaime Sommers or Dollhouse's what's-her-name, but her predicament is no less tasty." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today believed Q's performance was [...] "a fairly sizable incentive" [...] to watch the show, adding she [...] "combines stunt-fighting chops and lithe beauty with an unusual-for-the-genre air of somber intelligence. Her Nikita is not above cracking a joke, but it's clear from Q's eyes and bearing that she has suffered {{at the hands of}} evil men, and she's {{not going to take it}} anymore." [...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix believed that Q [...] "carries herself in a way that makes it believable she could be a hard-core killer, and she has the requisite dramatic chops and charisma for the part." [...] Maureen Ryan of AOL TV said [...] "Maggie Q, has real charisma and presence; she invests Nikita's drive to bring down the secretive Division with potent energy. You have to believe that Nikita would devote her life to wreaking vengeance on the people she views as her former captors, and you also have to buy her as a butt-kicking, gun-toting action heroine who also <b>looks</b> <b>great</b> in a cocktail gown. Maggie Q makes all those things look easy." ...|$|E

500|$|Jason Lipshutz from Billboard {{described}} it as a [...] "motorcycle mayhem meets biblical betrayal." [...] MTV News' James Montogomery called the video as a pure pop clip, [...] "albeit one that <b>looks</b> <b>great</b> and is sure to earn the ire of a few folks on the religious right." [...] He added that [...] "Judas" [...] is, at its sacred heart, an artistic explosion contained within the confines of a traditional pop clip. Christian Blauvelt from Entertainment Weekly did not like the video at first, calling it her weakest effort to date and attributing it to Gibson's choreography and the literal storyline. However, he admitted that after watching the video a few times, he became fond of it. Tris McCall from The Star-Ledger felt that there was neither anything blasphemous about the video, nor anything too daring about it. McCall explained that the dancing in the video is a [...] "pleasure to watch", but would have been better if the camera work was more professional. According to him, the only eye-catching prop in the video was the gun that turned into a lipstick. Matthew Perpetua from Rolling Stone was certain that the video would offend some Christians for its irreverent and highly sexualized take on Jesus Christ; he also said that Gaga interpreted the Biblical story in her own style. Oscar Moralde from Slant Magazine complimented the production of the video by calling it [...] "visually stunning", while adding that [...] "'Judas' is the work of a repertory, not a revolutionary. It takes familiar swatches from Gaga's palette (the leather-and-chain aesthetic of [...] "Telephone"; the plaintive, tear-stained camera stare of [...] "Bad Romance") and puts them all together for a competently executed work." [...] Phil Fox Rose, while reviewing the video for The Washington Post, gave it a positive review stating that he found it [...] "moving, both artistically and spiritually." [...] He then went on to explain how the religion related accusations against Gaga were completely biased. VH1 found that the video was inspired by Madonna's [...] "Like a Prayer", the films Our Lady of the Assassins, The Wild Angels and Romeo + Juliet, and the American television series Lost. NME named 'Judas' the fourth worst music video ever, describing it as [...] "an attempt to jump on the Madonna/Catholicism bandwagon that so incredibly misjudged it's quite comical." ...|$|E
