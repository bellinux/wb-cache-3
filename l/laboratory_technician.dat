25|$|The {{murder of}} Annie Le {{occurred}} September 8, 2009, {{on the campus}} of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, United States. Annie Marie Le (July 3, 1985– September 8, 2009) was a 24-year-old American doctoral student at the Yale School of Medicine's Department of Pharmacology. She was last seen in a research building on the New Haven campus on September 8. On September 13, the day she was to be married, she was found dead inside the building. On September 17, police arrested a suspect, Raymond J. Clark, III, a Yale <b>laboratory</b> <b>technician</b> who worked in the building. Clark pleaded guilty to the murder on March 17, 2011. Clark was sentenced to 44 years imprisonment on June 3. The case generated frenetic media coverage, with a news producer trampled in a rush to a briefing.|$|E

500|$|As Lennon and Cynthia {{were getting}} divorced, {{it became clear}} that Lennon did not wish to keep Kenwood, and Cynthia could not afford to {{maintain}} it on her own, so it was sold in December 1968, for a reputed £40,000, to Bill Martin, writer of songs such as [...] "Puppet on a String" [...] and [...] "Congratulations". Kenwood has subsequently changed hands several times, and been subject to some major renovation work, such that the interior now little resembles the house that Lennon lived in. The exterior and grounds are still recognisable, although the sunroom has been completely rebuilt. After being displayed at the Liverpool International Garden Festival in 1984, the psychedelic eye mosaic was unclaimed, and left in a field. It was rediscovered and restored by Tom Lorimer, a <b>laboratory</b> <b>technician</b> at the Liverpool John Moores University. The mosaic was then displayed at the Museum of Liverpool Life. Items from Lennon's Kenwood period have also appeared for auction, including towels and cutlery, a caviar jar, and the table that sat in the sunroom. Lennon kept the Kenwood house sign after he left, but gave it to Andy Eccles, who was a gardener at Tittenhurst Park, in 1972. It was sold for US$20,400, in 2003. In October 2006, Kenwood went back on the market, with a price of £5.95 million, and was sold in January 2007 for £5.8 million. It has been claimed that every owner after the Lennons has sold it due to divorce.|$|E
40|$|Context: The Workload Indicators of Staffing Need (WISN) human {{resource}} planning and management tool, developed by Shipp (1998) and popularized by the World Health Organization (WHO), gives health managers a way to analyze and calculate correct staffing levels in health facilities. In present study, WISN tool {{was used to assess}} a District Hospital in terms of staffing of <b>laboratory</b> <b>technicians</b> to understand the staffing need against the existing workload of health system. Aims: To assess the staffing needs of <b>laboratory</b> <b>technicians</b> in District Hospital using WISN method. Settings and Design: Hospital-based cross-sectional study. Materials and Methods: The present study is a cross-sectional survey involving observation, record review, and personal interview. Study was performed in a District Hospital of Madhya Pradesh. There were six <b>laboratory</b> <b>technicians</b> in the District Hospital and all of them were included in the study. The staffing pattern and need of <b>laboratory</b> <b>technicians</b> in District Hospital was estimated and WISN indicators calculated. Statistical Analysis Used: Rate ratio and proportions were calculated using Microsoft Excel 2007. Results: WISN calculation showed that District Hospital in which the study was done requires 16 <b>laboratory</b> <b>technicians</b> in order to provide the volume of health services in its annual statistics in accordance with the professional standards (activity standards) for these services, thus having a shortage of 10 <b>technicians.</b> Conclusion: The <b>laboratory</b> <b>technicians</b> in the District Hospital where study was conducted are constantly under pressure to match the existing workload due to shortage of manpower. Appropriate {{human resource}}s management and planning can contribute greatly to the improvement of efficiency of their work by ensuring optimum workload. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Healthcare workers (HCW) {{are very}} prone for {{accidental}} Needlestick Injuries. Inspite of health education and interventions for prevention, needlestick injuries are still common. A production survey {{was performed to}} estimate the magnitude of needlestick injuries (NSI) among <b>laboratory</b> <b>technicians</b> of Kanyakumari district in southern Tamil nadu, India. Methods: We reviewed the surveillance data of NSI {{over a period of}} one year (December 2008 –November 2009). Questionnaire were distributed to a stratified random sample of 1096 <b>Laboratory</b> <b>Technicians</b> in Diagnostic <b>laboratories</b> of Kanyakumari district to collect self reported NSIs. Results: Of the 986 <b>Laboratory</b> <b>Technicians</b> who returned a complete questionnaire, 212 (21. 5 %) sustained one NSI and 76 (7. 7 %) had sustained between one to four injuries in the past 12 months. The devices mainly responsible for NSI’s were hollow bore needles (n= 220, 79 %) solid (18 %) and others (3 %). Almost all injuries were caused during Blood collection procedure and Decapping or recapping of the needles and 96. 4 % of injuries involved fingers. Of the 288 (29. 2 %) <b>laboratory</b> <b>technicians</b> who sustained NSI’s, 204 (70. 8 %) took post exposure prophylaxis and subsequently followed up for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV). Three technicians turned up positive, two for Hepatitis B virus and one for HIV. Conclusion: Proper education and adopting universal precautions are necessary to prevent NSI among <b>laboratory</b> <b>technicians...</b>|$|R
40|$|Membership {{lists of}} {{professional}} bodies {{were used to}} establish study populations of British pathologists (1955 - 73) and medical <b>laboratory</b> <b>technicians</b> (1963 - 73). The standardised mortality ratio (SMR) for pathologists was 60 and for medical <b>laboratory</b> <b>technicians</b> 67. Twenty-seven of the 310 deaths were due to suicide. These numbers gave SMRs of 250 for pathologists and 243 for medical <b>laboratory</b> <b>technicians.</b> Suicide was the commonest {{cause of death in}} female technicians. Access to lethal chemicals at work is a possible factor explaining the high proportion of suicide by poisoning compared with the general population. Suicide rates for pathologists exceed those of all medical practitioners; similary medical laboratory have higher rates than all <b>laboratory</b> <b>technicians.</b> Excess deaths from lymphatic and haemopoietic neoplasms were noted in English male pathologists (observed 8, expected 3 - 3; P less than 0 - 01). This difference is not due to Hodgkin's disease or leukaemia and remains unexplained. No other neoplastic diseases were noted as causing excess mortality in either occupational group but a small, possibly spurious, excess number of deaths was noted for aortic aneurysm in male pathologists (observed 4, expected 1 - 8) ...|$|R

2500|$|NECs {{are not as}} {{analogous}} to MOS in the United States Army and Marine Corps, or AFSC in the Air Force as the rate in the Navy. There are primary NECs, and secondary NECs. For example, a hospital corpsman who completes Field Medical Training Battalion (FMTB) and earns the NEC HM-8404, moves that NEC to primary and has a secondary NEC of HM-0000. If that hospital corpsman attends a [...] "C" [...] School, then the NEC earned at the [...] "C" [...] School becomes their primary and HM-8404 becomes the secondary. Some hospital corpsmen go on to receive more specialized training in roles such as medical <b>laboratory</b> <b>technician,</b> radiology technician, aerospace medicine specialist, pharmacy technician, operating room technician, etc. This advanced education is done through [...] "C" [...] schools, which confer additional NECs. Additionally, hospital corpsmen (E-5 and above) may attend independent duty corpsman training, qualifying for independent duty in surface ships and submarines, with diving teams, and Fleet Marine Force Recon teams, {{as well as at}} remote shore installations. In addition to advanced medical training, these Hospital Corpsmen receive qualification in sanitation and public health.|$|E
2500|$|Webster {{was born}} in 1960 in Doncaster, England. [...] He was raised in Brierley. [...] His first {{instrument}} was piano which he began playing {{at the age of}} 6. [...] Four years later he began playing his current instrument the cornet. [...] The piano was gradually pushed aside as he progressed with the cornet at Grimethorpe Colliery Junior Band. [...] Before becoming a professional musician, he worked down the coal mines and prior to that as a <b>Laboratory</b> <b>technician.</b> However, it wasn't until 1988 that he began to turn his hobby into a job. [...] In this year he was invited to join Black Dyke, one of the world's greatest brass bands, as principal cornet. [...] He stayed here for 5 years before deciding to pursue a solo career. [...] He did however contest during his solo period with CWS Glasgow band, arguably the top band in Scotland. [...] Webster continues to play on occasions with the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra. [...] In 2000 he was once again invited to join Black Dyke Band, and accepted saying it felt as though he had [...] "seven years off for personal development". It was during this time that he received a master's degree in Music at the University of Leeds, and went on to complete his PhD in psychology The stay once again lasted five years with him leaving rather suddenly in December 2005. [...] Within days he joined Grimethorpe Colliery Band after the band manager, invited him to join, as the principal cornet had left only as few days previously. [...] In his first contest for Grimethorpe they came first beating his former band by one point whilst also picking up the best soloist award Roger left Grimethorpe in December 2008 along with several colleagues and is currently busy performing as a soloist and orchestral trumpeter (receiving great critical acclaim for his flugal playing in Mahler 3 and trumpet work in Gregson's Dream Song.). Webster worked for Besson whilst they were situated near London, and continues to work for them following their take-over by Buffet Crampon. Roger rejoined Grimethorpe recently on Principal cornet in a bid to help Grimethorpe become as successful as their recent history, when Webster was last in the band Roger has recently been awarded a Professorship at the RNCM.
