5000|$|On {{a regular}} basis in the 1950s and 60's, Van Dijk not only {{composed}} background music for educational programmes but used his improvisational skills as a pianist live on radio for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. This relationship would later culminate in the World premiere of his Four Epigrams for Symphony Orchestra (1962) with the CBC Symphony conducted by Walter Susskind {{as part of the}} CBC's National School Broadcast series Finding Out about Music. [...] As an original musical work commissioned by the CBC, [...] "The Four Epigrams for Symphony Orchestra point up the two main ingredients in a work composed with young listeners in mind: powerful, shifting rhythms, and dramatic colour contrasts." [...] The Canada Council enabled Van Dijk to further his composition studies in Paris (1964-1965) with Max Deutsch, a pupil of Arnold Schoenberg. [...] During this time, he concluded his piano studies with Kendall Taylor in London. Between 1964-1966, Van Dijk also worked at the British Broadcasting Corporation, London [...] in educational television programmes [...] which were broadcast throughout the world. From 1966 onwards, teaching became part of his musical life. Van Dijk returned with his family to Canada and was appointed teacher of piano at the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto. He was commissioned by the CBC to write a cantata with librettist George Benson Johnston which Van Dijk would entitle Now is the Prophet's Time (1967). Its premiere took place in The Netherlands at the Philharmonie Haarlem with the Boy's choir of St. Bavo Cathedral, Groot Omroepkoor, and the Symfonieorkest Haerlem for Dutch radio broadcast conducted by Jan Stulen. In 1972, Van Dijk was appointed to the Faculty of Music at Indiana University. At this time, his composition Immobile Eden (1972), set to the composer's own text written for the Toronto <b>Lyric</b> <b>Arts</b> Trio, was first performed on National Public Radio in New York City in November 1975. [...] From 1975-1981, Van Dijk taught Composition and Analysis at Berklee College of Music in Boston, and during this time his Movement for Alto saxophone and piano (1960) was given its premiere.|$|E

40|$|In 2007, Martin Heidegger's Gedachtes appeared, as volume 81 of the Gesamtausgabe. It {{contained}} {{more than}} five hundred poems (or, more accurately, texts that may be read as poems), and represented a considerable extension to a small but significant body of poetic work that had already appeared in earlier volumes. These poems were written at important and, occasionally, at critical points throughout his life and career, and they clearly performed a function that was both intellectual and personal. This article argues that these texts form {{an essential part of}} Heidegger's oeuvre, and that they offer new insights into his philosophy and into his continuing struggle to find a language appropriate for developments within that philosophy. Heidegger's poems are, however, far from being simply literary refashionings of philosophical ideas. In their subtle use of poetic form, their modulation of image and symbol and in their control of mood and diction, they stand for themselves as important moments within the canon of the twentieth-century German <b>lyric.</b> <b>Arts,</b> Education & Law Group, School of Humanities, Languages and Social SciencesFull Tex...|$|E
