3000|$|Another {{limitation}} {{concerns the}} uncertainty of <b>proficiency</b> <b>level</b> classifications in general: The reduction of continuous test scores to ordinal <b>levels</b> of <b>proficiency</b> necessarily leads to {{a certain amount of}} misclassification. It is important to bear in mind that due to measurement sampling error the classification of students into <b>proficiency</b> <b>levels</b> is inevitably deficient (Betebenner et al. 2008). Factors such as test length and the number of <b>proficiency</b> <b>levels</b> may increase the rate of misclassifications of student abilities (Ercikan 2006; Ercikan and Julian 2002). For this reason, Ercikan and Julian (2002) set broad guidelines for desired classification accuracy, depending on the number of levels and the test reliability. For a categorization into five <b>proficiency</b> <b>levels,</b> the authors suggest the following percentages of accurate classifications depending on the assumed reliability of the test (in parentheses): [...]. 70 (. 90), [...]. 60 (. 75), [...]. 50 (. 70). For the official German NA EFL tests, Tiffin-Richards (2011) reported an expected classification accuracy of [...]. 76 (. 90) on the five CEFR <b>proficiency</b> <b>levels,</b> based on maximum likelihood estimates of examinee ability and their standard errors. This means that in our study the categorization of test scores into five <b>proficiency</b> <b>levels</b> may inherently lead to a misclassification of about 24 %, without taking divergent classifications (TOEFL/German NA) into account. This general deficiency of <b>proficiency</b> <b>level</b> classifications, however, does not explain the systematic shift we found in our data.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1983 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects that matching the syntactic structure of textual material with the English oral language <b>proficiency</b> <b>levels</b> of high school English-as-a-Second Language (ESL) students has on their reading comprehension of the materials. The hypothesis tested in this study was that when the syntactic structure of textual material "matches", or is similar to, the English syntactic structures (or oral English language patterns) frequently used by high school ESL students who are at given oral language <b>proficiency</b> <b>levels,</b> then reading comprehension achievement is greater than when there is no "match", or similarity. Sixty-four 9 th to 12 th grade Vietnamese English-as-a-Second Language students with one to two years of English and enrolled in history classes at Ballard, Franklin, and Ingraham High Schools in Seattle, Washington, were identified at their schools for participation in the study. The Bilingual Syntax Measure II-E was used to determine the oral <b>proficiency</b> <b>levels</b> of the participants. Then a Cloze Reading Comprehension Test was administered to ascertain their reading ability. Finally, thirty-six participants at levels four and five oral <b>proficiency</b> <b>levels</b> were randomly assigned to the treatment conditions. At the fourth <b>proficiency</b> <b>level,</b> ten students read an adapted ("matched") version of an excerpt from a history textbook used by low fluency students. Ten others read the "unmatched" (original) versions. At the fifth <b>proficiency</b> <b>level</b> eight students read the "matched" version and eight read the "unmatched" version of an excerpt from a more difficult high school history textbook. Two t-tests used to test the research hypothesis supported the hypothesis. The t-test analysis suggested that "matching" is, in general, superior to "not matching", therefore "matching" does affect reading comprehension achievement. The participants in the "matched" groups outperformed those in the "unmatched" groups. The difference between the means of both groups at the fourth <b>proficiency</b> <b>level</b> was significant (p. 05) at the fifth <b>proficiency</b> <b>level.</b> Implications for textbook writers, regular classroom teachers, and ESL teachers as well as suggestions for further research are discussed...|$|R

The thesis consists of two separate studies, one on English speakers learning German and one on Chinese and Korean learners of English. The data for the German study come from 17 oral proficiency interviews based on the ACTFL guidelines; the English data come from 47 oral proficiency exam administered at a large Midwestern university to international graduate students. In order to examine the role of task type and <b>proficiency</b> <b>level,</b> the German data were subdivided into three <b>proficiency</b> <b>levels</b> by the interviewer. Two-minute segments were selected from the interview that corresponded to three different tasks. The English data consist of 10 separate two-minute tasks, from which four were selected. The English learners were classified into five <b>proficiency</b> <b>levels</b> by raters trained by the university’s oral proficiency program. ^ The data were examined for the frequency of discourse markers and conjunctions used on different tasks and at different <b>proficiency</b> <b>levels.</b> The fluency and complexity of the output were also examined. The results show that <b>proficiency</b> <b>level</b> is a significant factor in the use of discourse markers, conjunctions, and fluency. The frequency of discourse markers and conjunctions, as well as fluency, all generally increase at higher <b>proficiency</b> <b>levels</b> in both the German and the English data. The differences between the lowest and highest levels are statistically significant. In the German data, the most structured task (narration) exhibited a rise in conjunction use and drop in discourse marker use. In the English data, one task (leaving a telephone message) was significantly different from the other tasks in the frequency of discourse marker. The anomalous results for these two more structured tasks suggest that the degree of structure in a task may have an impact on a number of performance variables. ...|$|R
