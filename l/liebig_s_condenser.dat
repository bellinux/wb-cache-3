40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{investigated}} {{the effect of the}} oxide layer (Ovreg&# 229;rd 2013) and iron content (Hem 2013) on the nitridation of silicon powders. This report will take a closer look into the growth mechanisms of different parameter such as storage conditions, particle size and impurities under different stages of the process. The main focus was between two samples; Sample B and sample C. Names were given based on a system of purity, worked out by Hem 2013. In short; Sample B has low amount of impurity, while Sample C has higher amount of impurity. Both of these samples have grain sizes of 0. 2 - 0. 8 mm. The growth mechanisms change during the nitridation of silicon, depending on temperature and amount of impurity; Sample B forms cavities on the surface before the growth of wool-like, dense, whiskers. Sample C forms the whiskers before cavities. The wool-like whiskers originates from droplets of molten FeSi 2 and forms &# 945;-Si 3 N 4 whiskers, by a VLS process, which are later retarded and thickened by condensation of SiO 2 (s). At higher temperatures the whole surface of both samples is covered in &# 946;-Si 3 N 4 dendrites with trench like cavities to each side, which form by surface diffusion and evaporation of Si to the reaction sites. The nature of the whiskers change in the C sample at elevated temperatures to longer and straighter whiskers, due to the VLS process is moved away from the surface to the FeSi 2 beads at the whiskers' terminus. This change is almost not noted in the B sample. Due to the geometry of the crucible the surface of the sample is soon covered in a cloud of SiO 2 (<b>s)</b> <b>condensed</b> on the crucible wall. This phenomenon occurs in all samples, and may hinder the nitrogen gas flow to reach the sample surface. This explains the very low amounts of &# 945;-Si 3 N 4 but high amounts of cristobalite detected. Humid storage condition was tested on a pure and fine grained (< 75 &# 181;m) sample named A and showed that the growth of the protective silica layer retards the nitridation process. The fine grained sample A also beat the coarse grained sample B and C in the amount Si converted, proving how important the grain size is for the nitridation process. The role of impurities were discovered; Iron catalyzes the growth of &# 945;-whiskers, aluminum oxidizes and preventing the reestablishment of the protective silica layer and copper acts as a catalyst at very low temperatures. Calcium quantities are too low to give any conclusion. </p...|$|R

Pokušava se razaznati utjecaj ranije historiografije i je li mlađi autor preuzimao građu od starijegSeveral ancient writers {{mentioned}} the revolt of the Pannonian legions that broke out almost immediately upon Augustus 2 ̆ 7 death in AD 14. The evidence is best attested in Tacitus 2 ̆ 7 Annals and, to some extant, in Dio 2 ̆ 7 s Roman History. Placed whithin the broader context of Tiberius 2 ̆ 7 ascension to the imperial throne, the two narratives vividly depict army 2 ̆ 7 s mutinous acts. This paper relies on Tacitus 2 ̆ 7 and Dio 2 ̆ 7 s data and discusses the similarities or {{differences between the}} two sources. More precisely, it examines the way in which their own thoughts influenced the accounts on the Pannoninan revolt. The purpose is to sketch out a coherent picture of what shaped the data attested in Tacitus 2 ̆ 7 and Dio 2 ̆ 7 s writings. Unusually extended and elaborated, Tacitus 2 ̆ 7 account implies that both earlier authors and his previous works left a strong mark on his views on the military disobedience. Despite the pessimistic tone, {{there is no reason to}} assume that Tacitus questioned the very foundations of the Principate nor that he accused troops for such deeds. On the other hand, Dio 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>condensed</b> chapter seemingly fails to offer additional informaton. However, the Greek author provides a number of comparative examples elsewhere in the Roman history. If carefully scritinized, they show that Dio 2 ̆ 7 s views were shaped by his personal experience and by contemporary Greek culture. Even in this short paragraph one can discern following features: Dio avoids details, but preferes accuracy; he is ironic, but well-aware of the threat of military unrest; he offers no comment, but infers conclusions. The similarities between the two narratives are insufficient to assess that Dio relied mainly on Tacitus 2 ̆ 7 data. It seems that the two authors drew from a variety of sources, and that at least some of them were known exclusively to Dio...|$|R

Condensed combustion products were analyzed with advanced techniques (Scanning Electron Microscopy, X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy and X-Ray Diffraction) to determine morphology, chemical composition and crystalline structure. Increasing the fine AP mass fraction, decreasing the coarse AP size, and increasing steady burning rate all lead to decreasing agglomerate average size.

The helium microwave-induced plasma (He-MIP) {{has been shown to be}} an excellent source for nonmetal determination. In this thesis, a description of the analytical characteristics of He-MIPs in different spectral regions using moderate and high power discharges for the determination of nonmetals is presented. Initial investigations using electrothermal vaporization (ETV) for sample introduction showed detection limits in the part-per-billion range for arsenic, selenium and antimony. Samples sizes were 15 μL. A tantalum-coated carbon cup was used to minimize interferences. The determination of metals, nonmetals and metalloids (F, Cl, Br, I, S, P, Se, As, Sb and Pb) in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) was accomplished. To observed atomic emission at wavelengths in the VUV region, a system which contained no N 2 and O 2 in the optical path was designed and implemented. This arrangement was produced by using an optical sampler to couple the plasma discharge with a helium purged monochromator. Sample introduction was accomplished with ultrasonic nebulization. Limits of detection, linear ranges, and matrix effects using groups IA and IIA elements were studied. Detection limits ranged from 0. 06 μg/mL for sulfur to 5 μg/mL for selenium. A study involving sulfur-containing compounds in the near infrared region (921. 3 nm) demonstrated the feasibility of the determination of inorganic and organic sulfur using differential electrothermal vaporization sample introduction. Detection limits were between 3 to 5 parts-per-million, and linear responses greater than two orders of magnitude were obtained. Sulfur detection limits were improved when a reductive pyrolysis of the sample was performed. The analyte was passed through a high temperature region (1050 ∘C) in the presence of hydrogen gas to form H 2 S. The resultant H 2 <b>S</b> was <b>condensed</b> in a liquid nitrogen trap. Following preconcentration, flash vaporization into the stream of flowing helium routed the H 2 S to the plasma for atomic emission detection.

The number of <b>condensed</b> (<b>s)</b> quarks r {{is assumed to be}} in the interval 2 N_f/ 3 < r < N. To pass to N= 1 we introduce an N= 2 -breaking deformation, a mass term μ for the adjoint matter, eventually decoupling the adjoint matter in the limit of large μ. If one starts from a large value of the parameter ξ∼μ m, where the original theory is at weak coupling, and decreases ξ one hits a a crossover transition from weak to strong coupling (here m is a typical value of the quark masses). Below this transition the original theory is described in terms of a weakly coupled infrared-free r dual theory with the U(N_f-r) gauge group and N_f light quark-like dyon flavors. Dyon condensation leads to confinement of monopoles, defying a naive expectation of quark confinement. The quarks and gauge bosons of the original theory are in an "instead-of-confinement" phase. The r and Seiberg dualities are demonstrated to coincide in the r=N vacua. In the (2 / 3) N_f <r<N vacua two dualities do not match. In this window Seiberg's dual is at strong coupling while our r-dual model is at weak coupling. Thus, we can speak of triality.

Nevertheless, intraspecific hybridization is common between many plant species and recent studies have suggested that hybridization may be beneficial to individuals. hybridization is also of interest as it influence species that are interacting with the hybridising species, for example herbivores that need {{to decide whether or not}} to forage on hybrids between host plants and non-host plants. To understand how herbivores are influenced by hybridization, and how herbivory influences hybrid plants, I have studied the inheritance of plant resistance characters, foraging preference and performance of herbivores (leaf beetles and voles) and the degree of herbivore damage on pure and hybrid willows. The studied willow species, Salix caprea, S. repens and S. aurita differ in secondary metabolite composition. The results show that both studied groups of secondary metabolites, phenolic glucosides and condensed tannins, are additively inherited in hybrids between S. repens and <b>S.</b> caprea, while <b>condensed</b> tannins are equal in S. caprea, S. aurita and hybrids between the two parental species (Paper I and II). There is no common response of the studied herbivore community. Instead, it seems that specialist herbivores either discriminate against hybrids and non-host parental species or do not separate between hybrids and host parental species. In contrast, generalists usually show either intermediate preference for hybrids, or do not discriminate between hybrids and parental species. One generalist species shows a preference that indicates a breakdown in resistance (Paper II, III, and IV).

40|$|This {{fascinating}} book foregrounds {{the oral}} history of Chevato (Billy Chiwat), a Lipan Apache who in May 1870 captured eleven-yearold Herman Lehmann near Fredericksburg, Texas. Orphaned when young, Chevato joined the Mescalero Apaches, {{who were the}} ones actually responsible for the kidnapping of Herman and his brother Willie. In middle age, through {{the influence of the}} powerful Comanche Quanah Parker, Chevato became a Comanche and moved to Oklahoma where he lived until his death in 1931. Non-Native captivity narratives, which have been a familiar part of American culture for centuries, usually focus on the crystallizing events of captivity and do not follow the subject 2 ̆ 7 s postcaptivity life. Thus in many captivity narratives the whole experience is decontextualized. Yet the historical record reveals ongoing relationships between Native Americans and European Americans before and after what might be called 2 ̆ 2 a captivity event. 2 ̆ 2 Continued contact was certainly more likely if a non-Native captive became transculturated to Native culture, as Herman Lehmann did, but then returned (perhaps unwillingly) to his culture of origin. Chevato complements and complicates the two popular books published {{in the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth centuries based on Herman Lehmann 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> experiences: A <b>Condensed</b> History of the Apache and Comanche Indian Tribes for Amusements and General Knowledge (1899), also called Indianology, by Jonathan H. Jones, and Nine Years Among the Indians: 1870 - 1879 (1927), by J. Marvin Hunter. Although the subtitle of Chevato seems to define the man by his role as one of Lehmann 2 ̆ 7 s captors, in fact the book focuses on Chevato 2 ̆ 7 s biography and includes Lehmann only when the two men 2 ̆ 7 s lives intersect. Surprisingly, these convergences were more frequent and more friendly than the initial captor/captive relationship might suggest. Indeed, the authors conclude that Chevato 2 ̆ 7 s entire life was 2 ̆ 2 interwoven, in a strange and unfathomable way 2 ̆ 2 with Lehmann 2 ̆ 7 s...|$|R
40|$|I examine three limit-cases {{of poetic}} {{address to the}} social as a {{distinct}} medium. In the background to Zukofsky 2 ̆ 7 s, Andrews 2 ̆ 7 s, and Inman 2 ̆ 7 s social stance is Pound 2 ̆ 7 s, which required a fascist Italy to realize the modernist word—“language charged with meaning to the utmost possible degree”—as ideas in action. These three do not equate the social with the political—nor do they equate it with the aesthetic. Zukofsky uses a secularized esoteric address to the social in order to critique Pound 2 ̆ 7 s exoteric extremism. I turn to Spinoza 2 ̆ 7 s writing method {{as a model for}} understanding Zukofsky 2 ̆ 7 s quotational technique and use of esoteric address. Andrews and Inman continue this Zukofsky mode which is characteristic of Language Writing, theorizing and expanding its use into a broad societal critique. I propose a lineage for Andrews by arguing that he reinvents Mayakovsky 2 ̆ 7 s obscured categorical imperative of a “social command” for poetry, which was intended to resolve contradictions between Formalism and Marxism. I read Andrews 2 ̆ 7 s mid- 1980 s booklength poem, I Don 2 ̆ 7 t Have Any Paper So Shut Up (or Social Romanticism) as a negation and inversion of Socialist Realism, and as posing a crisis for the idea of a social command in poetry. Andrews is a limit-case for the Marxian social in poetry. Inman 2 ̆ 7 s textual opacity continues Zukofsky 2 ̆ 7 s career-long effort to reduce words to seen things. Inman explores what I call a nonce level between letter and word. Nonce-words socially undermine the well-formed sign that neologisms aestheticize. Inman is a limit-case of the nonce-word as language and as social critique. Critics have aligned neologisms with Pound 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> injunction to <b>condense</b> meaning. Nonce-words dis-assemble what neologisms assemble: the visual and phonic axes of the modernist word. The nonce-word is an accident waiting to be recognized as historical contingency, pointing toward economic and linguistic factors structuring language as a social medium prior to authorial intent—from Westernizing products in Beijing markets (dis-assembling the Chinese ideogram) to cryptic ciphers as motivated or arbitrary signs. ...|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedWhen a thin super{{conducting}} film (<b>S</b> film) is <b>condensed</b> onto a thin normal conducting film (N film), {{the first}} {{layers of the}} S film loose their superconductivity. This phenomenon is generally called the "superconducting proximity effect(SPE) ". As an investigation of SPE {{we focus on the}} transition temperature of extremely thin NS double layers in the thin regime. Normal metal is condensed on top of insulating Sb, then Pb is deposited on it in small steps. The transition temperature is plotted in an inverse Tc-reduction 1 /dTc= 1 /(Ts-Tc) versus Pb thickness graph. To compare our experimental results with the theoretical prediction, a numerical calculation of the SN double layer is performed by our group using the linear gap equation. As a result, there are large discrepancies between the experimental and theoretical results generally. The results of the NS double layers can be divided into three groups in terms of their discrepancies between experiment and theory. (1) Non-coupling(Tc= 0 K) :N= Mg, Ag, Cu, Au. There are large deviations between experiment and theory by a factor to the order of 2. 5. (2) Weak coupling (Tc is low(< 2. 5 K) :N=Cd, Zn, Al. Deviation is present, but only by a factor of 1. 5. (3) Intermediate coupling(Tc is around half of Pb's(4. 5 K)) : N=In, Sn. The experimental results agree with the theory.; Next, we examine the detection of the magnetic dead layer (MDL) of Ni thin films in terms of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) with several non-magnetic metal substrates. In our results, when Ni film is contact with a polyvalent metal substrate film, the sandwich film has around 2 to 3. 5 at. lay. of magnetic dead layers. However we have not observed the magnetic dead Ni layers with the alkali and noble metal substrate film.; Finally, we revisit the Pb/Ni system to measure the magnetic scattering of Ni with the method of Weak Localization (WL) to compare with the dephasing rate due to the Tc-reduction. In this series, we use only very thin Pb films between 1. 3 and 5 at. lay. deposited on top of the Ag substrate with about 37 at. lay. thickness, because we make the Ag substrate suppress the superconductivity of the extremely thin Pb film with the SPE and avoid the Azlamazov-Larkin fluctuations. After comparison, it becomes clear that the dephasing rate from the Tc-reduction method is much larger than that measured by the weak localization (the factor is around 120). We consider not only "pair breaking" but also "pair weakening", and conclude that the reduction of the superconducting transition temperature is not due to dephasing by magnetic scattering but due to the resonance scattering of Cooper pairs by non-magnetic d-states...|$|R
40|$|This work {{describes}} the synthesis and properties of new oligmeric, polymeric and macrocyclic ether sulphones bearing carboxylic {{groups in the}} side chains. Linear ether sulphones Several oligo(ether-sulphones) with carboxylic groups in the side chains and either chlorophenyl-endgroups (4 a-h) or phenolic endgroups (5 a, 5 b) were synthesized by polycondensation of different relative amounts of bis(4 -chlorophenyl) sulphone (2) and 4, 4 -bis(4 -hydroxyphenyl) pentanoic acid (1). The molecular weight distributions of the oligo(ether-sulphone) -fractions of 4 a-h were estimated by GPC, elementary analysis and NMR-spectroscopy. The glass transition temperatures of the oligo(ether-sulphones) increase with the molecular weight of the oligomers. Macrocycles New macrocyclic arylene ether sulphones bearing one or two carboxylic groups (8 and 9 respectively) were prepared by use of pseudo high dilution technique. In a first step, 4, 4 -bis(4 (4 -chlorophenylsulphonyl) -phenoxy - 4 -phenyl) pentanoic acid (7) was prepared from 4, 4 -bis(4 -hydroxyphenyl) pentanoic acid (1) and an excess of bis(4 -chlorophenyl) sulphone (3). Then, the purified trimer 7 was cyclocondensed with 4, 4 -bis(4 -hydroxyphenyl) pentanoic acid (1), yielding the bifunctionalized macrocycle (8), and with 2, 2 -bis-(4 -hydroxyphenyl) propan (2) to get the monofunctionalized mocrocycle (9). The existence of the ring shaped molecule was proved by use of MALDI-TOF, NMR- and IR-spectroscopy. The free carboxylic groups of 8 were used {{to build up a}} polyamide (under the conditions of Yamazaki) that contain the macrocycle in the main chain and 4, 4 ´-diaminodiphenylmethane as an aromatic diamine-component. Block copolymers The nucleophilic telechelic oligo(ether sulphone) s with free carboxylic groups in the side chains and phenolic endgroups (5 a, 5 b) have been uesd for building block copolymers. The carboxylic groups were esterified with methanol (16 a, 16 b). As electrophilic prepolymers the OH-endgroups of several poly(ethylene glycol) s and poly(butylene glycol) s were mesylated to incorporate good leaving endgroups. For coupling of these two prepolymers a nucleophilic aliphatic condensation reaction was carried out. The resulting block copolymers contain both, the hydrophilic polyethers as soft segments and the relatively rigid and hydrophobic oligo(ether sulphone) s as hard segments. GPC-, NMR-, FTIR- measurements and the data from thermal investigations of the block copolymers (19 a- 19 h) are discussed. Additionally, the block copolymer 19 h was fractionated and characterized by use of GPC-FTIR spectroscopy. Multilayers The poly(ether-sulphone) s with carboxylic groups in the side chains can also be applied as polyanions. Therefore this poly(ether-sulphone) s and some modified oligo(ether-sulphone) s with carboxylic groups and additionaly sulfonated acid gropus have been used for building multilayers. The method for the multilayer build-up is based on physisorption of the polyelectrolytes. The multilayers obtained are characterized by UV-Vis spectrometry. In dependence of the used polyanions multilayers with more than 30 double layers have been realized. Polymeranalogous reactions Another part of this work {{describes the}} building of graft and hyperbranched polymers. Using the reactivity of the carboxylic groups in the side chains, the oligo(ether-suphone) <b>s</b> have been <b>condensed</b> with different aromatic carbonic acids.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of alkali metals, {{especially of}} potassium, during {{circulating fluidised bed}} combustion of wood-based fuels was studied experimentally in pilot-scale and industrial scale combustors. The fuels included willow, forest residue and waste wood co-combusted with paper mill sludge. As {{a result of this}} work, the main chemical and physical transformation mechanisms of potassium compounds in the combustion chamber and in the convective pass are presented in this thesis. Aerosol measurement techniques were used for sampling fly ash and inorganic vapours from the flue gas, upstream and downstream of the convective pass. Samples were collected with cyclones, impactors and filter samplers. Fly ash size distribution was also measured directly in the superheater section with a low-pressure impactor located in-duct in a region where the gas temperature was 650  °C. The method is described and the factors affecting the impactor operation in elevated temperatures are discussed. Elemental analysis methods were used for analysing samples collected by aerosol measurement methods, as well as for conventional samples of fuel, bottom ash and fly ash. Scanning electron microscopy was applied to the fly ash aerosol samples. Up to 40  % of the ash-forming constituents were retained in the bed and were removed with the bottom ash. The reaction of potassium compounds with quartz sand bed material was found to result in enrichment of K in the bottom ash (relative to Ca) when the fuel Si-content was low (<  0. 2  %). The high Si-content (2. 6  %) in the fuel resulted in depletion of K in the bottom ash, as the amounts of quartz and silicates in the fuel were large enough for efficient capture of potassium to the ash. The fly ash released from the combustion chamber consists of i) coarse particles (1 - 100  μm) that contain all the non-volatile species, including alkali silicates and CaSO 4, as well as of ii) sub-micron K 2 SO 4 particles. KCl is released from the combustion chamber as vapour. The fraction of potassium present as sulphates and chlorides was found to be higher the lower the Si to K ratio in the fuel was. The increased amount of Si in the fuel increases the extent of alkali silicate formation, resulting in a decrease in the mass concentrations of K 2 SO 4 and KCl. The fine particles included 16 - 32  % of K (including KCl vapour condensed in the sampling system) when the fuel Si content was <  0. 2  %, but less than 1  % of K when the Si content was 2. 6  %. About 60 - 70  % of the fly ash entering the convective pass was deposited on the heat exchanger surfaces in the convective pass, and was removed during the soot-blowing period. The deposition efficiency correlated clearly with the ash-particle size. The largest particles, including alkali silicates, were deposited most effectively, and the deposition efficiency decreased with decreasing particle size. The deposition efficiency of the fine mode particles, including alkali chlorides and sulphates, was less than about 25  %. The deposition efficiencies of particles with variable compositions, but with the same aerodynamic diameter were not found to be different. The physical state (vapour, fine particle or coarse particle) of the ash species was shown to have a remarkable effect on the form and rate of ash deposition in the convective pass. When the different fuels were compared, the variation in the deposition efficiency was the most remarkable for sulphur. A majority of the condensed-phase S was present as K 2 SO 4 during combustion of willow, resulting in a deposition efficiency of below 20  %.

40|$|U članku se raspravlja o humanističkim ishodištima kulture renesansnih ljetnikovaca. Posebno se analizira Hektorovićev Tvrdalj koji se po svojoj arhitektonskoj koncepciji i idejnim pretpostavkama odvaja od istovremenih dubrovačkih ladanjskih sklopova. There is {{documentary}} evidence {{that at one}} time, in the surroundings of Dubrovnik, there stood around three hundred of Renaissance summer residences. This represents a cultural phenomenon of European importance, as Croatian art historians {{have been trying to}} show over the last four decades, from the pioneer studies by Cvito Fisković to Nada Grujić 2 ̆ 7 s newest synthesis of the subject. The author adds some fresh evidence to foster the ideas of Nada Grujić on the architecture of the Renaissance villas at Cavtat which were built to animate "that way of life which {{from the point of view}} of the 15 th and 16 th centuries seemed closest to the antique". To this purpose the Republic, after having reacquired it, divided the area of the ancient Epidaurum into 25 plots,distributing them among the aristocratic families of Dubrovnik on the model of the ancient parcelling applied for example in 1296 on the northern suburb of Dubrovnik - Prijeko - and, after 1370, on the western quarters of Ston. Yet, while in the older examples rows of houses were erected on such plots, this time noble villas appeared inside high curtain walls; this - according to the typology of Renaissance residential architecture- was a specific derivation from the Roman domus. The Cavtat villas are unique - as a planned settlement of Renaissance summer residences intentionally rebuilt on the site of the ruined classical city back to which Dubrovnik traces its origin. In the rest of Dalmatia the majority of residential-agricultural complexes included also protective and defensive functions. These were numerous castra and castelli in the surroundings of Split, Trogir, Šibenik and Zadar, mentioned as early as the 14 th and 15 th centuries in numerous documents of the Republic. To illustrate better this aspect of Renaissance country life,determined by the depressive historical reality of the 15 th and 16 th centuries, with the Turkish power on the neck that about that time definitely overcast the chain of ancient Dalmatian towns which, from 1420 on, recognized the Venetian sovereignty, after Ladislas of Naples sold them for 100. 000 ducats, author describes an authentic example of the kind, in order to explain the architectural consequences, as well as the notional premisses, which distinguish them from the contemporary villas of Dubrovnik. He describes Tvrdalj, a fortified summer residence of the eminent Renaissance Croatian poet Petar Hektorović, at Stari Grad on the island of Hvar. Indeed, it would be possible to interpret Tvrdalj as a literary work expressed in the medium of architecture. Tvrdalj is not only the poet 2 ̆ 7 s lifework, it is also one of the most intriguing projects in the history of Croatian architecture as well as an utterly original example in the European Renaissance architecture of villas, in the same way in which Hektorović 2 ̆ 7 s Fishing and Fishermen 2 ̆ 7 s Conversation (Ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje), as acomplex ecloga piscatoria, transcends the rigid framework of that literaryspecies. * It is a poem-epistle in which Hektorović in three parts depicts to Nečujam on the Island of Šolta, the village in which Marko Marulić, the most significant Croatian poet and a model for Hektorović, had earlier found shelter. Tvrdalj in fact combines these two architectural types- a fort and a villa-into a specifically designed fortified Renaissance villa with some unusual characteristics of a convent. In its central part, beneath the crenelated terrace, in a small room that is enclosed by all sides, although linked to the tower with the dovecot, lived a hermit- "pinzocchera" -a Franciscan woman of the Third Order ("a nun living in the outside world with a vow of chastity"). Within the complex there were edifices whose function was described by the inscriptions: PRO ITINERANTIBVS and PRO PAUPERIBVS. The rooms in the building which was called revelin were reserved for the poet 2 ̆ 7 s male and female servants and welcomed the poor. The fish pond holds a place for washing clothes open for the whole town. The entire complex had several dozens of inscriptions of which more than twenty have survived - mostly written in a moralising tone. The style, the graphic quality, and the spirit of the inscriptions seem to have developed in a similar way as the poet himself, and as the building of Tvrdalj advanced. However, some of the texts were created according to the same concept. The inscriptions in Tvrdalj belong to several parallel planes, partly overlapping creating a central core focused on eschatological matters related to the last things. A number of inscriptions directly identify houses of the complex, and specifically wells and water. The sea- the water- the rainwater, these are topics Hektorović is obsessed with. The associations are biblical, but also Horatian and Ovidian. Of special importance are inscriptions which tell us that the poet was occupied by contemporary scholastic explications of the dogma of the Immaculate conception. He was active in the current immaculatistic theological disputation and in those inscriptions he criticizes the "maculatists", mainly the Dominicans (who lived in his immediate vicinity). Finally, there is a series of inscriptions, both Latin and Croatian, expressing thoughts of direct warning of the last things and last moments, of the very Last Judgement. Hence, the image of Tvrdalj as a picturesque Renaissance site of relaxation changes essentially after we have noticed, at each turn on our way, with each new glance, the warnings and morals. Where did Hektorović get the idea to adorn the entire complex, both the inside and the outside, with so many inscriptions making them literally the sole architectural decoration, where his coat of arms can be found nowhere but on the stone table which was once set aside in the garden? Where did he get the idea of transforming the architecture into a place for memorizing moralistic warnings? It is a suggestive hypothesis that the poet 2 ̆ 7 s Tvrdalj represents a materialized example of ideal space meeting the standards of the Renaissance mnemonic theory and praxis, according to which the speaker learns to remember the sequence of paragraphs of his speech, as well as whole groups of sentences, according to rules for artificial, trained memorizing - by placing specific words or sentences in specific imaginary space. Anyhow, we do not know of a Renaissance ambiance so extensively and so densely crowded with written messages, invectives, maxims. In the very center of the complex of Tvrdalj, beneath the fortified terrace (which we have recently freed from the 19 th century additions), in a small room there lived a hermit nun Lucija, the daughter of Hektorović 2 ̆ 7 s mason Stjepan Ključeta. On the ground-story of that building, adjoining the central tower, on the very axis of the entire complex, beneath Lucija 2 ̆ 7 s little chamber, chickens were kept. Petar 2 ̆ 7 s ideas that so clearly unfold from his will, from his epistles, from the Ribanje and from the very architecture that crowns his complete work, may undergo various interpretations. But, if we look closely into the heart of Tvrdalj, a suggestive story is revealed: alongside the gardens full of luxuriant and rare plants (the poet Naljesković from Dubrovnik sends him cypresses,oleanders [...] .) lies a fishpond with grey mullets that presumably were not eaten, but intended to please the eye, and regarded as one of the symbolic attributes of the entire complex. On the ground-story was the henhouse, on the second story Lucija, in the tower the sparrow-roost and the dovecot. Thus the complete structure of God 2 ̆ 7 s world is represented, ranging from plants, from creatures that swim, those that walk, to those that fly. All this lies behind the facade of the fortified building, which bears a monumental inscription, truly the focal one, the largest and longest by its letters, the main dedication of the entire complex: OMNIVM CONDITORI To the Creator of All. Peter himself must have felt completely assimilated to that inscription, since he was the one who reclaimed Tvrdalj from the sea and marsh. An inscription from the facade (which is now lost, but was still seen by Ljubić) reads: OPVS IN MARI TOTVM (The whole edifice is in the sea). The cove with the little harbor was filled up less than 100 years ago. Yet, Petar had already done "such an exhausting work to drain the littoral", to erect walls on the coast, to reclaim land from marshes, to replace the reed with the oleander. Hektorović obviously saw himself as a specific archetype of the Creator himself. This is not an exaggeration. In the center of the western wall of the fishpond, the basic attributes of the Creator (two pairs of compasses, Fortuna 2 ̆ 7 s wheel, the Sun and the Moon) are carved out in relief. It is that same Creator who is mentioned in the well-known sequence of syntagms as Deus geometres, Deus artifex or opifex, aedificator or architectus, fabricator. Below the relief, Hektorović identifies himself with the inscription: CONNVENTIBUSVIRTVTE ET GENIO F(ECIT). (Built with common approval of Virtue and Genius). Through the metaphor of God as artist and the World as a work of art, through medieval platonism, through Augustine and Boethius(Hektorović 2 ̆ 7 s favourite writers) we come to the poet 2 ̆ 7 s time and to his principles. In medieval iconography the representations of Deus-artifex, the creator and appointer of the life`s vertical axis that we have discovered in the centre of Tvrdalj, disappear in the 15 th century, but continue to be present in the literary tradition of the Renaissance and Baroque. This whole interpretation of Tvrdalj may seem too literary. In the rusticated walls of the unfinished small fortress in the south-west corner of the complex, in the architectural ascetism of the fishpond, in the combination of Gothic and Renaissance shapes, we may perhaps search for mannerist elements, since we are already in the time of the Council of Trent, right in the first half of the 16 th century. But, in many ways Tvrdalj stands out. It is a pure literary concept materialized in space. Tvrdalj, built to the poet 2 ̆ 7 s own design is Cistercian by its ascetic tone, without grotesqueries, festoons, or any kind of decorations. In the ground plan and elevation there are no traces of all 2 ̆ 7 antica forms of that period. In this space which is more picturesque than beautiful, which is concentrated and compartmentalized in a Gothic manner, in an essentially didactic and inelegant ambiance, in a sort of sub divo classroom, scenic surprises of Italian gardens are inconceivable. The whole system of Hektorović 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> thoughts is <b>condensed</b> in the inscription on his stone table (the only one in Italian) : FEDE E REA LTÀ, o QVANTOEBELLA (Faith and reality, how beautiful they are). That inscription completes the linguistic triangle of Croatian Renaissance Humanism in a fitting way: inscriptions in Croatian are found in the exterior of Tvrdalj, intended for the poet 2 ̆ 7 s milieu; the above-mentioned Italian inscription is carved into the table in the garden where the poet together with his friends enjoyed summer refreshments; the Latin ones are present in the entire complex. Tvrdalj as we see it is a complete setting. With all reason Petar says that Tvrdalj has "adopted" him...|$|R
