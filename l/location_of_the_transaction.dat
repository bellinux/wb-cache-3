Restrictions are based on selected states laws, executive orders, and other regulations, and generally cover certain locations or certain types of purchases such as alcohol. In some cases, states restrictions are broader than the new federal requirements. These restrictions vary in their degree and means of implementation, including widespread disabling of Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) access at automated teller machines located at certain locations across a state, such as at casinos.

40|$|There {{are growing}} debates about <b>the</b> {{appropriateness}} <b>of</b> offering money {{in exchange for}} <b>the</b> provision <b>of</b> bodily materials for clinical treatment and research. The bioethics literature and many practice guidelines have generally been opposed to such entanglement, depicting <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> money as contaminating, creating undue inducement, exploitation and commodification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human body. However, two elements have been missing from these debates: (i) <b>the</b> perspectives <b>of</b> those people providing bodily materials when money is offered; and (ii) systematic empirical engagement with <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> ‘money’ itself. This article seeks to fill those gaps in knowledge by providing detailed insights from a project investigating the views and experiences of women who volunteered to provide eggs for research in exchange for reduced fees for fertility treatment. Analysis of 29 semi-structured interviews reveals multiple ways in which volunteers reason through <b>the</b> involvement <b>of</b> ‘money’ in this domain and shows how their accounts diverge from pessimistic understandings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> monies in everyday life. When volunteers speak in detail about <b>the</b> monetary aspects <b>of</b> their participation they draw major, recurring, distinctions in five overlapping areas: their depiction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monetized world <b>of</b> fertility treatment; their views <b>of</b> <b>the</b> different forms that money can take; a distancing of their actions from their understandings of how markets and commodities work; their <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>transactions</b> within a particular clinic, and <b>the</b> ongoing importance <b>of</b> their eggs, post-transaction. This article: (i) responds to calls for concrete case studies to assist understandings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inter-relationships <b>of</b> money and specific aspects of social life; (ii) adds to <b>the</b> sociology <b>of</b> money literature by providing empirical insights into how notions of money are deployed; (iii) presents much-needed perspectives from providers of bodily materials; and (iv) contributes to ongoing conversations between bioethics and sociology...|$|R

30|$|Price {{discovery}} can {{be defined}} as a mechanism, which allows a buyer and a seller in a business proposition to move from establishing a general measure of overall prices to agreeing on a specific price (the optimum consumer basket which maximizes the utility function) for their transaction based on many factors including the size, <b>location,</b> and cost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>transaction.</b> Price discovery is always a dynamic process and <b>the</b> true mission <b>of</b> any market or any exchange. The price discovery mechanism can be practically implemented through determining <b>the</b> market price <b>of</b> a security/commodity, good or service or through examining the market supply-demand and analyzing other aspects analogous with transactions. Trading on financial markets aims for obtaining the accurate prices. The price that is detected instantaneously on the ideal efficient market paves the way for a good evaluation of future risk and return. However, this price is usually not fixed, as new information is being perpetually generated in the economy and rapidly incorporated in the market prices. A dynamic market can be characterized as one in which the price discovery mechanism takes place momentarily as price changes are continuous; it will sometimes fall below the average and sometimes exceed the average as a result of market forces and the uncertainties surrounding the market.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedResource allocation problems occur in many applications. One example is bike-sharing systems, which encourage <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> public transport {{by making it}} easy to rent and return bicycles for short transits. With large numbers of distributed kiosks recording <b>the</b> time and <b>location</b> <b>of</b> rental <b>transactions,</b> <b>the</b> system acts like a sensor network for movement <b>of</b> people throughout <b>the</b> city. In this thesis, we studied a range of machine-learning algorithms to predict demand (ridership) in a bike-sharing system, as part of an online competition. Predictions based on the Random Forest and Gradient Boosting algorithms produced results that ranked amongst the top 15 % of more than 3, 000 team submissions. We showed that <b>the</b> mandated use <b>of</b> logarithmic error as the evaluation metric overemphasizes errors made during off-peak hours. We systematically experimented with model refinements and feature engineering to improve predictions, with mixed results. Reduction in cross-validation errors did not always lead to a reduction in test set errors. This could be due to overfitting {{and the fact that the}} competition test set was not a random sample. The approach in this thesis could be generalized to predict use of other types of shared resources. Outstanding ThesisCivilian, Defence Science and Technology Agency, Singapor...|$|R

Results: In modern conditions high-quality products are necessity-term, but not sufficient to achieve <b>the</b> successful operation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> market. To optimize the above goal should be to work out issues such as <b>the</b> definition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> requirements <b>of</b> potential customers, <b>the</b> timing, <b>location</b> and conditions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>transaction,</b> that is, <b>the</b> seller must offer the buyer at a particular moment only the product {{that the best way to}} satisfy existing need for the latter.

I also investigate that has the price effect varied for housing on areas with increasing travel time to Helsinki Central Business District and for areas with varying social status. DATA <b>The</b> housing <b>transaction</b> data set consists of residential apartment transactions done by Finnish real estate agents in the HMA during January 2005 - September 2010. Total number <b>of</b> <b>transactions</b> in <b>the</b> sample is 46, 426. The final sample for the West Metro estimation includes 4, 149 <b>transactions.</b> <b>The</b> demographic data <b>of</b> <b>the</b> residential areas is obtained from <b>the</b> statistical center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Helsinki region. <b>Location</b> coordinates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> housing <b>transactions</b> have been obtained from the Google Maps service using a Java interface. RESULTS Findings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study show that, adjusting for the general appreciation in the HMA, on average housing prices have risen close to the West Metro stations after the metro building decision. However, apartments in immediate proximity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coming West Metro stations are on average cheaper than housing farther away from the metro stations. However, the estimations done for individual West Metro stations show that the metro’s effect on apartment prices varies between station areas. <b>The</b> impact <b>of</b> increasing travel time to Helsinki Central Business District (CBD) increases prices of apartments closest to metro. While in general <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> increasing travel time to CBD on housing prices is negative. High status neighborhoods suffer more from negative price impact caused by living in short distance to a coming West Metro station. <b>The</b> announcement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West Metro building decision and <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> construction works have increased <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> housing <b>transactions</b> and reduced <b>the</b> average selling time of apartments close to West Metro stations...|$|R
