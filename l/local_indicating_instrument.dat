5000|$|In {{addition}} to synchronizing generators to power systems, similar frequency-difference <b>indicating</b> <b>instruments</b> are used on multiengine ships and aircraft {{to allow the}} operators to exactly synchronize the speed of engines. This helps reduce the noise and vibration due to slight differences, for example, in the speeds of two propellers on an aircraft. In this application a synchroscope responds to slight speed differences {{that would not be}} visible on an engine tachometer.|$|R
50|$|In Berlin on March 16, 1910, {{as a boy}} of sixteen, Marcel {{patented}} a maritime compass {{that indicates}} north regardless {{of the presence of}} iron or magnetic forces. He patented an improved version in London on December 20, 1911. This second version was a remote maritime compass device, consisting of ampermeters as the <b>indicating</b> <b>instruments</b> located {{in different parts of the}} ship, resistant to magnetic forces or magnetic masses in their vicinity.|$|R
50|$|Model {{circuits}} were energized {{at relatively}} low voltages {{to allow for}} safe measurement with adequate precision. The model base quantities varied by manufacturer and date of design; as amplified <b>indicating</b> <b>instruments</b> became more common, lower base quantities were feasible. Model voltages and currents started off around 200 volts and 0.5 amperes in the MIT analyzer, which still allowed directly driven (but especially sensitive) instruments {{to be used to}} measure model parameters. The later machines used as little as 50 volts and 50 mA, used with amplified <b>indicating</b> <b>instruments.</b> By use of the per-unit system, model quantities could be readily transformed into the actual system quantities of voltage, current, power or impedance. A watt measured in the model might correspond to hundreds of kilowatts or megawatts in the modeled system. One hundred volts measured on the model might correspond to one per-unit, which could represent, say, 230,000 volts on a transmission line or 11,000 volts in a distribution system. Typically, results accurate to around 2% of measurement could be obtained. Model components were single-phase devices, but using the symmetrical components method, unbalanced three-phase systems could be studied as well.|$|R

They also install and service measuring and <b>indicating</b> <b>instruments</b> to monitor process control variables associated with PLCs, and monitor the operation of PLC equipment. PLC technicians work with final control devices such as valves, actuators and positioners to manipulate the process medium. They install and terminate electrical, pneumatic and fluid connections. They also work on network and signal transmission systems such as fibre optic and wireless.|$|R
50|$|To {{reduce the}} size of the model components, the network {{analyzer}} often was energized at a higher frequency than the 50 Hz or 60 Hz utility frequency. The operating frequency was chosen to be high enough to allow high-quality inductors and capacitors to be made, and to be compatible with the available <b>indicating</b> <b>instruments,</b> but not so high that stray capacitance would affect results. Many systems used either 440 Hz, or 480 Hz, provided by a motor-generator set, to reduce size of model components. Some systems used 10 kHz, using capacitors and inductors similar to those used in radio electronics.|$|R

50|$|Laboratory {{investigations}} of the stability of multiple-machine systems were constrained {{by the use of}} direct-operated <b>indicating</b> <b>instruments</b> (voltmeters, ammeters, and wattmeters). To ensure that the instruments negligibly loaded the model system, the machine power level used was substantial. Some workers in the 1920s used three-phase model generators rated up to 600 kVA and 2300 volts to represent a power system. General Electric developed model systems using generators rated at 3.75 kVA. It was difficult to keep multiple generators in synchronism, and the size and cost of the units was a constraint. While transmission lines and loads could be accurately scaled down to laboratory representations, rotating machines could not be accurately miniaturized and keep the same dynamic characteristics as full-sized prototypes; the ratio of machine inertia to machine frictional loss did not scale.|$|R
5000|$|The finite lumped {{system is}} {{composed}} {{of a number of}} simple parts, each of which has known dynamical properties which can be defined by equations using two types of scalar variables and parameters of the system. Variables of the first type represent quantities which can be measured, at least conceptually, by attaching an <b>indicating</b> <b>instrument</b> to two connection points of the element. Variables of the second type characterize quantities which can be measured by connecting a meter in series with the element. Relative velocities and positions, pressure differentials and voltages are typical quantities of the first class, whereas electric currents, forces, rates of heat flow, are variables of the second type. Firestone has been the first to distinguish these two types of variables with the names across variables and through variables.|$|R
