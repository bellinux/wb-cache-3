5|$|E.T. is an {{adventure}} {{game in which}} players control an alien (E.T.) from a top-down perspective. The objective {{of the game is}} to collect three pieces of an interplanetary telephone. The pieces are found scattered randomly throughout various pits (also referred to as wells). The player is provided with an on-screen energy bar, which decreases when E.T. performs any actions (including moving, teleporting, or falling into a pit, as well as levitating back to the top). To prevent this, E.T. can collect Reese's Pieces, which are used to restore his energy or, when nine are collected, E.T. can call Elliott to obtain a piece of the telephone, or the player can save the candy pieces for bonus points at the end. After the three phone pieces have been collected, the player must guide E.T. to an area where he can use the phone, which allows him to call his home planet. When the call is made, E.T. must reach the spaceship in a given time limit. Once E.T. gets to the forest where his ship abandoned him and stands and waits in the designated area for the ship to come, the ship will appear on screen and take him back to his home planet. Then the game starts over, with the same difficulty level, while changing the location of the telephone pieces. The score obtained during the round is carried over to the next iteration. The game ends when the energy bar depletes. E.T. has three lives and if he dies within those three lives Elliot will come in and revive him. E.T. can get a fourth life if the player is <b>lucky</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> find a geranium in one of the wells. It turns into a sprite from some games that Howard Scott Warshaw made, such as Raiders of the Lost Ark.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} pioneer days of Western Canada's prairie towns, when a good farming spot being settled, many {{people wanted to}} make money by {{building}} their own grain elevators. This brought in droves of private grain companies. Towns boasted dozens of elevator companies which all stood in a row along the railway tracks. If a town was <b>lucky</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> have two railways, {{it was to be}} known as the next Montreal. In many elevator rows there would be two or more elevators of the same company. Small towns bragged of their large elevator rows in promotional pamphlets to attract settlers. With so much competition in the 1920s, consolidation began almost immediately, and many small companies were merged or absorbed into larger companies.|$|E
25|$|Sailors might hope to {{supplement}} their meager diets with fish if they were <b>lucky</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> catch them. The islands frequented were plentiful with potential foods, such as turtle, seafowl, shellfish, and fish. Sea turtle was considered {{some of the best}} meat possible. While at sea, when supplies were low, fresh fish such like snapper, shark, catfish, grouper, albacore were caught and often barbecued, though one would have to be certain not to let the deck on fire. When food was scarce, a rationing system may be put in place similar to legal sailors. In some cases, the only items there were requested of the looted victim from pirates was food and drink. When gold or silver was found, food was a popular item to barter for when bartering was easier than fighting.|$|E
25|$|Though some {{television}} series were already being filmed in Hollywood, most used the single-camera format familiar from movies, {{with a laugh}} track added to comedies to simulate audience response. Arnaz and I Love Lucy creator Jess Oppenheimer decided, however, that Lucy needed to work {{in front of an}} audience to create the kind of comic energy she had displayed on radio. The idea of a film studio that could accommodate an audience was a new one for the time, as fire safety regulations made it difficult to allow an audience in a studio. Arnaz and Oppenheimer were <b>lucky</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> find the financially struggling General Service Studios located on Las Palmas Avenue in Hollywood. Studio owner Jimmy Nasser was eager to accommodate the Desilu company and allowed them, with financial backing of CBS, to renovate two of his studios so that they could accommodate an audience and be in compliance with local fire laws.|$|E

25|$|After {{the release}} of the album, Deaf Havana {{spent a lot of time}} touring as a support band; they would not play a {{headline}} tour until April 2012, 5 months after {{the release of}} Fools and Worthless Liars. They began by supporting Skindred on their headline tour across Europe, followed by acting as support, alongside Tek-One, to Architects on their UK tour. Speaking before their April 2012 headline tour, which featured The Swellers and The Dangerous Summer as support, James Veck-Gilodi said: 'We are so excited to finally get out on the road and headline again. We've spent the last year or so writing and recording the album and been <b>lucky</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> have some amazing support shows... but to be able to go out and play songs from Fools and Worthless Liars and headline is going to be great'. The band are due to play another headline tour, at larger venues, in November 2012. Support will come from There For Tomorrow and Canterbury. Deaf Havana had been due to travel to the USA to support There For Tomorrow in September 2012, but due to a problem with the arrival of their visas, this did not take place.|$|E
25|$|From {{the early}} Christians, early medieval Christians {{inherited}} a church united by major creeds, a stable Biblical canon, and a well-developed philosophical tradition. The history of medieval Christianity traces Christianity during the Middle Ages—the period {{after the fall}} of the Roman Empire until the Protestant Reformation. The institutional structure of Christianity in the west during this period is different from what it would become later in the Middle Ages. As opposed to the later church, the church of the early Middle Ages consisted primarily of the monasteries. The practice of simony has caused the ecclesiastical offices to become the property of local princes, and as such the monasteries constituted the only church institution independent of the local princes. In addition, the papacy was relatively weak, and its power was mostly confined to central Italy. Individualized religious practice was uncommon, as it typically required membership in a religious order, such as the Order of Saint Benedict. Religious orders wouldn't proliferate until the high Middle Ages. For the typical Christian at this time, religious participation was largely confined to occasionally receiving mass from wandering monks. Few would be <b>lucky</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> receive this as often as once a month. By the end of this period, individual practice of religion was becoming more common, as monasteries started to transform into something approximating modern churches, where some monks might even give occasional sermons.|$|E
25|$|Two {{developments}} {{dominated the}} decade that followed: the increasingly apparent crumbling of the Soviet Union's {{economic and political}} structures, and the patchwork attempts at reforms to reverse that process. After the rapid succession of former KGB Chief Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko, transitional figures with deep roots in Brezhnevite tradition, Mikhail Gorbachev announced perestroika {{in an attempt to}} modernize Soviet communism, and made significant changes in the party leadership. However, Gorbachev's social reforms led to unintended consequences. Because of his policy of glasnost, which facilitated public access to information after decades of government repression, social problems received wider public attention, undermining the Communist Party's authority. In the revolutions of 1989 the USSR lost its allies in Eastern Europe. Glasnost allowed ethnic and nationalist disaffection to reach the surface. Many constituent republics, especially the Baltic republics, Georgian SSR and Moldavian SSR, sought greater autonomy, which Moscow was unwilling to provide. Gorbachev's attempts at economic reform were not sufficient, and the Soviet government left intact most of the fundamental elements of communist economy. Suffering from low pricing of petroleum and natural gas, ongoing war in Afghanistan, outdated industry and pervasive corruption, the Soviet planned economy proved to be ineffective, and by 1990 the Soviet government had lost control over economic conditions. Due to price control, there were shortages of almost all products, reaching their peak in the end of 1991, when people had to stand in long lines and to be <b>lucky</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> buy even the essentials. Control over the constituent republics was also relaxed, and they began to assert their national sovereignty over Moscow.|$|E

All insurance stock, state obligations and other commercial papers were nullified. The economic situation of many people got worse, and many petitions and demonstrations broke out, the largest of which took place in Plzeň, where 472 people were arrested.|$|R

25|$|The {{reason for}} the sad state of public transit is a very basic one - the transit systems just do not offer a service which will attract people away from their automobiles. Consequently, their {{patronage}} comes very largely from those who cannot drive, either because they are too young, too old, or because they are too poor to own and operate an automobile. Look {{at it from the}} standpoint of a commuter who lives in a suburb and is trying to get to work in the central business district (CBD). If he is going to go by transit, a typical scenario might be the following: he must first walk to the closest bus stop, let us say a five or ten minute walk, and then he may have to wait up to another ten minutes, possibly in inclement weather, for the bus to arrive. When it arrives, he may have to stand unless he is <b>lucky</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> find a seat. The bus will be caught up in street congestion and move slowly, and it will make many stops completely unrelated to his trip objective. The bus may then let him off at a terminal to a suburban train. Again he must wait, and, after boarding the train, again experience a number of stops {{on the way to the}} CBD, and possibly again he may have to stand in the aisle. He will get off at the station most convenient to his destination and possibly have to transfer again onto a distribution system. It is no wonder that in those cities where ample inexpensive parking is available, most of those who can drive do drive.|$|E
25|$|The {{night of}} 30 January 1895 was stormy. In the North Sea, {{conditions}} were freezing {{and there were}} huge seas. SS Elbe had left Bremerhaven for New York {{earlier in the day}} with 354 passengers aboard. Also at sea on this rough night was the steamship Crathie, sailing from Aberdeen in Scotland, heading for Rotterdam. As conditions grew worse, the Elbe discharged warning rockets to alert other ships to her presence. The Crathie either did not see the warning rockets or chose to ignore them. She did not alter her course, with such disastrous consequences, that she struck the liner on her port side with such force that whole compartments of the Elbe were immediately flooded. The collision happened at 5.30 am and most of the passengers were still asleep.The Elbe began to sink immediately and the captain, von Goessel, gave the order to abandon ship. Amid great scenes of panic the crew managed to lower two of the Elbes lifeboats. One of the lifeboats capsized as too many passengers tried in vain to squeeze into the boat. Twenty people scrambled into the second lifeboat, of whom 15 were members of the crew. The others were four male second-class passengers and a young lady’s maid by the name of Anna Boecker, who had been <b>lucky</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be pulled from the raging sea after the first boat had capsized. Meanwhile, {{on the other side of}} the Elbe, Captain von Goessel had ordered all the women and children to assemble there but no other lifeboats were launched because the ropes on the derricks were all frozen up, and so they perished along with the captain. Within 20 minutes of the collision, the Elbe had sunk and the only survivors were the 20 people in the one surviving lifeboat. These people now had to endure mountainous seas and below-zero temperatures and they were 50 miles from land. Things looked bleak; the Elbes distress rockets had not been seen by any passing vessels and so no one knew of their predicament. After five hours in the raging storm, their luck changed. A fishing smack from Lowestoft called the Wildflower found them. In desperate conditions the crew of the Wildflower struggled to pull the 20 survivors from the lifeboat, which had begun to break up. The skipper, William Wright, said later that the survivors would not have lasted another hour in those conditions, and believed that the only reason they had stayed alive for five hours was the expertise of the Elbes crewmen aboard the lifeboat.|$|E

Both crowds received a tip of the hat at the ACC on Friday, although the set list had a definite tilt toward the far more mannered and ordinary Peppers of recent memory". Scott Mervis (Pittsburgh Post-Gazette) gave {{the show at}} the Consol Energy Center a positive review, stating Flea was {{the highlight of the}} entire show. He continues, [...] "From the moment they hit the stage, with the first of many mini-jam sessions, the Peppers were an instrumental powerhouse. They are essentially a funk power trio led by Flea, who, at 49, is still a rock 'n' roll animal unleashed on the stage. His bass was cranked to max volume and was the dominant instrument throughout the show, as it should be".|$|R

Or, might you have ignored it, <b>lucky</b> <b>enough</b> not <b>to</b> have a blister later?

Such issues might include ethnicity, culture, gender, class, sexuality and (dis) ability that interlace with the discourses of social justice and inclusion. Ellen Singleton and Aniko Varpalotai as editors of this text have coordinated fifteen chapters to present provocative and sometimes disquieting insight into such issues that face individuals, schools and communities. In their words (2006, p. ix), "each chapter represents the many 'stones' that trouble us in our day-to-day teaching and interaction with students". what is assumed in this is that teachers do recognise the "stones", although we know several either don't see them and operate via routined practices, or choose to ignore. However, this text aims to develop a more open awareness of these critical pedagogical issues for student teachers...|$|R
