40|$|Diploma thesis {{deals with}} relict <b>land</b> <b>border</b> between Bohemia and Moravia {{in the context}} of Moravistic {{movement}} which appeared in Czechia after 1989. Aim of the thesis is to assess the existence of relict <b>land</b> <b>border</b> in the minds of people and to reflect the role of the <b>land</b> <b>border</b> in relation to the revival of regionalism and nationalism. The first part of the thesis discusses the theory of relict border, regional identity and nation in the literature. The second part compares the course of the <b>land</b> <b>border</b> with territorial reach of declaring Moravian nationality by inhabitants of the districts adjacent to the border in contemporary censuses and also with the range of the success of Moravistic politic parties in elections. The objective is to compare the border with one of the possible contemporary zones which could delimitate Moravia. The third part of the thesis analyzes the forms and contexts of Moravian identity in two selected municipalities adjacent to the <b>land</b> <b>border.</b> These municipalities represent distinct types of the Czech-Moravian borderland which differ by declaring the nationality, achievements of Moravistic parties in elections, population change after 1945 and inclusion to administrative units in Bohemia or in Moravia.
