25|$|The Mae West was {{a common}} {{nickname}} for the first inflatable <b>life</b> <b>preserver,</b> which was invented in 1928 by Peter Markus (1885–1974) (US Patent 1694714), with his subsequent improvements in 1930 and 1931. The nickname originated because someone wearing the inflated <b>life</b> <b>preserver</b> often appeared to be as large-breasted as the actress Mae West. It was popular during the Second World War with U.S. Army Air Forces and Royal Air Force servicemen, who were issued inflatable Mae Wests {{as part of their}} flight gear. Air crew members whose lives were saved by use of the Mae West (and other personal flotation devices) were eligible for membership in the Goldfish Club.|$|E
25|$|Ibrahim Abdallah, another sailor on the Sima Com 2, {{recalled}} Bakari's recovery:When {{the girl}} saw us approaching, {{she let go}} of the piece of debris she had been using as a <b>life</b> <b>preserver.</b> Suddenly, a large wave flipped her over and she disappeared from view, until she reappeared a few minutes later. It was at this exact moment that Maturaffi jumped into the water to save her.|$|E
25|$|As soon as Bakari was sighted, {{a member}} of the rescue team threw her a <b>life</b> <b>preserver,</b> but the waters were too rough, and she was too {{exhausted}} to grab it. One of the sailors, Maturaffi Sélémane Libounah, jumped into the water and handed her a flotation device, after which they were both pulled safely aboard the Sima Com 2, where she was given dry blankets and a hot drink.|$|E
2500|$|On Monday August 7, 1905, a {{reporter}} searched among the passenger-carrying gasoline launches serving the Portland area, {{and found that}} only one of them, Gloria, carried any <b>life</b> <b>preservers</b> on board. [...] Gloria often carried 35 to 40 people and had only two <b>life</b> <b>preservers</b> fastened to two long lines.|$|R

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the manager of the <b>life</b> <b>preserver</b> manufacturer placed iron bars inside the cork preservers to meet minimum weight requirements at the time. Many of the life preservers had been filled with cheap and less effective granulated cork and brought up to proper weight by the inclusion of the iron weights. Canvas covers, rotted with age, split and scattered the powdered cork. Managers of the company (Nonpareil Cork Works) were indicted but not convicted. The life preservers had been manufactured in 1891 and had hung above the deck, unprotected from the elements, for 13 years.|$|E
25|$|On Sunday 9 November 1913 {{at around}} 10:30a.m. the H. B. Hawgood was running {{before the storm}} when they spotted the Isaac M. Scott, still heading North and making heavy weather of it, off Tawas Point, Michigan, just hours before {{the brunt of the}} storm struck. When {{communication}} was restored and newspapers began carrying accounts of the storm the Isaac M. Scott was only listed as missing. The body of Capt. A. McArthur washed up at Southampton, Ontario, Canada on 11 December 1913 while still wearing his <b>life</b> <b>preserver.</b> One of her lifeboats was found 23 miles north of the Chantrey Island lighthouse, off Southampton, Ontario. All 28 crew members perished in the disaster.|$|E
25|$|Fiction {{and plays}} about pirates were {{ubiquitous}} in the 19th century. Walter Scott's The Pirate (1822) and James Fenimore Cooper's The Red Rover were key {{sources for the}} romanticised, dashing pirate image {{and the idea of}} repentant pirates. Both Gilbert and Sullivan had parodied these ideas early in their careers. Sullivan had written a comic opera called The Contrabandista, in 1867, about a hapless British tourist who is captured by bandits and forced to become their chief. Gilbert had written several comic works that involved pirates or bandits. In Gilbert's 1876 opera Princess Toto, the title character is eager to be captured by a brigand chief. Gilbert had translated Jacques Offenbach's operetta Les brigands, in 1871. As in Les brigands, The Pirates of Penzance absurdly treats stealing as a professional career path, with apprentices and tools of the trade such as the crowbar and <b>life</b> <b>preserver.</b>|$|E

50|$|Only {{six of the}} ship's 12 {{lifeboats}} were launched: boats 1, 3, 5, 9, and 11 on {{the starboard}} side, and boat 10 on the port side. Although the combined capacity of these boats was 408, they carried only 85 people, most of them crew members. Many passengers died for {{lack of knowledge of}} how to use the <b>life</b> <b>preservers.</b> As they hit the water, <b>life</b> <b>preservers</b> knocked many persons unconscious, leading to subsequent death by drowning, or broke victims' necks from the impact, killing them instantly.|$|R
2500|$|Telephone No. 1 was {{equipped}} with three lifeboats and 315 <b>life</b> <b>preservers.</b> [...] The steamer {{was reported to have}} cost $15,000 to build, and was insured for $30,000.|$|R
500|$|Poropat recounts {{that after}} the {{shipyard}} workers departed, the crew were told to pack all their personal belongingsexcept for toiletries and one change of clothesto be sent ashore. Each crewman was issued a backpack with K-rations, a special <b>life</b> <b>preserver,</b> and survival equipment. West Honaker departed Cardiff on 24 April for Oban where she arrived on 5 May. She was now {{a part of the}} [...] "Corncob Fleet," [...] the group of ships to be sunk to form the [...] "gooseberries," [...] shallow-water artificial harbors for landing craft. Once at Oban, Poropat reports that the ship's crew was told of their mission, but to preserve secrecy, they were not permitted to leave the ships.|$|E
500|$|Hiram B. Shaw {{had just}} {{returned}} to the beach when this casualty occurred. After supplying his small rescue boat with more rope lines, he and Edward DeCourcy removed their outer clothing and prepared to embark. The men on the Cobb, who had just witnessed Waterhouse's drowning, prompted {{the captain of the}} schooner to give an impassioned address in which he said, [...] "They have sacrificed one man in their efforts to save us; now I'll risk my life in an attempt to get ashore." [...] The captain tied a rope around his waist and jumped into the water, just as the rescue boat had set out from shore. After battling against the current and waves, he was met by Shaw's rescue boat and clung to its stern until they reached land. Making use of the captain's line, the men on shore tied a <b>life</b> <b>preserver</b> to it. One at a time, the five stranded crewmen pulled the flotation device out to the schooner, fastened it to their bodies and were pulled to safety by the people on the shore. [...] After receiving a cup of hot coffee, a drink of whiskey and a blanket, the Cobb's crew were taken to Coquina, Ormond Beach's area hospital.|$|E
500|$|Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian {{gave the}} film a {{negative}} review, likening it to [...] "being mugged {{by a professional}} whose skills in mixed martial arts you can't help but notice and appreciate, even as you are savagely beaten, then dragged upright, bruised and bleeding, and forced to watch as your assailant gives fully 45% of your money to charity." [...] Christy Lemire writing for Roger Ebert's website gave it two stars out of four and criticized the film for being [...] "emotionally inert, despite its many moments that are meant to put a lump in our throats." [...] Lemire criticized Elgort's performance and praised Woodley's [...] "abiding, disarming naturalism." [...] Robbie Collin writing for The Daily Telegraph said: [...] "Gus {{is something of a}} manic pixie dreamboat: the lesser-spotted male version of the kooky, adoring girlfriend-type sometimes played by Kirsten Dunst, Natalie Portman, and Zooey Deschanel." [...] David Edelstein of NPR said: I know people who cried at the trailer of the romantic teen cancer movie The Fault in Our Starsat the movie they'll need a <b>life</b> <b>preserver</b> to keep from drowning in a flood of tears. Me, I didn't cry, though at times my tear ducts tingled; I was on the verge. The film is a little slick for my taste, too engineered. But it's gently directed by Josh Boone and beautifully acted. Whatever the faults, it's not in the stars. Shalini Langer of The Indian Express gave the film {{two and a half stars}} and said: [...] "The film is faithful to a fault from the dialogues to the clothes, the setting and the food, even while skipping over some of the unpleasant details." [...] Dana Stevens writing for Slate Magazine said: [...] "What in the name of God is wrong with me that I didn't cry onceI, who just the day before wept through the entirety of my child's thoroughly upbeat school play." ...|$|E

2500|$|During World War II, Allied aircrews {{called their}} yellow inflatable, vest-like <b>life</b> <b>preserver</b> jackets [...] "Mae Wests" [...] partly from rhyming slang for [...] "breasts" [...] and [...] "life vest" [...] {{and partly because}} of the {{resemblance}} to her torso.

2500|$|The life preservers, [...] {{hardwood}} planks, [...] {{long and}} [...] wide, were never used. [...] Two boats {{with a total}} of 18 persons reached shore.
