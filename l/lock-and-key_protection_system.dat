40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} fast breaker failure backup {{protection}} algorithm for HVDC grids. The main requirement for HVDC grid protection is the operation speed due to fast rising dc fault currents.

Conventional ac backup protection uses extensive time delays that ensure operation of the backup <b>protection</b> <b>system</b> only after failure of the primary <b>protection</b> <b>system.</b> The breaker failure backup protection proposed in this paper minimizes the fault clearing time by initiating backup protection actions and discrimination between cleared and uncleared faults before full fault clearance by the primary <b>protection</b> <b>system.</b> Reliable discrimination is achieved by using both voltage and current measurements.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. Eng.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2005. HVDC {{transmission}} is today {{widely used in}} modem Power Systems {{as an alternative to}} HVAC. Current trends indicate that many future conventional HVDC systems will be systems of increasing power ratings, delivered over larger distances as well as multi-terminal systems. In order to ensure the security and dependability of such <b>systems,</b> the current <b>protection</b> schemes need to be evaluated to assess their ability to provide adequate protection for the envisaged HVDC systems. This research work firstly reviews the present HVDC transmission line <b>protection</b> <b>systems,</b> and highlights their advantages and disadvantages, including factors that adversely influence their performance. The author critically evaluates the current protection schemes and reveals the drawbacks and other factors that render them unsuitable for the protection oflong dc transmission lines. The author then goes on to propose and develop an HVDC line <b>protection</b> <b>system</b> that will be able to provide adequate protection for proposed long HVDC transmission lines. The proposed <b>protection</b> <b>system</b> is able to make decisions based solely on local detection increasing its overall reliability. The author then recommends that the proposed <b>protection</b> <b>system</b> be used in conjunction with the existing main <b>protection</b> <b>system</b> in order to optimise the protection response times for both close in and distant faults. The author also proposes and develops a method of further enhancing the reliability of the <b>protection</b> <b>system</b> by the use of the telecommunication infrastructure when available. Finally the performance and feasibility of the proposed <b>protection</b> <b>system</b> is evaluated using the results obtained from the extensive fault simulations performed in EMTDC and Matlab. The simulations are performed using a bipole model of an HVDC System on which the required line and <b>protection</b> <b>systems</b> are modelled. The simulation results obtained are very favourable and promote the use of this proposed <b>protection</b> <b>system,</b> for the <b>protection</b> of long HVDC transmission lines...|$|R
