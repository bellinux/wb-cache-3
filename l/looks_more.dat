5|$|Pterobranchs {{may be a}} {{sub-group}} of enteropneusts ("acorn worms"). This {{suggests that}} the ancestral deuterostome <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> like a mobile worm-like enteropneust than a sessile colonial pterobranch. The fact that lophophorates and pterobranchs both use tentacles for feeding is probably not a synapomorphy of lophophorates and deuterostomes, but evolved independently as convergent adaptations to a sessile lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|The fifth book <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> to the future; for example, Monteverdi {{employs the}} concertato style with basso continuo (a device {{that was to}} become a typical feature in the {{emergent}} Baroque era), and includes a sinfonia (instrumental interlude) in the final piece. He presents his music through complex counterpoint and daring harmonies, although at times combining the expressive possibilities of the new music with traditional polyphony.|$|E
5|$|The east front <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> medieval {{than the}} other sides but {{probably}} dates from about 1900, however the south end cross-wing appears to be mostly sixteenth century. To {{the north of the}} house stands the well-preserved sixteenth century stable courtyard. This has timbered gabled dormer windows, and a tall clock-tower at the west side of its north range. These buildings have mullion windows, and Tudor arched-doorways. Also beside the courtyard are the brew house, one of the oldest in Britain, and the bakehouse. The two lodges are seventeenth century and the carriage-houses are eighteenth century.|$|E
5000|$|The {{documentary}} takes a {{look into}} the trend of black women {{all over the world}} investing in the multibillion dollar business of skin bleaching creams. Duke and Berry also examine how black women are trying to <b>look</b> <b>more</b> Caucasian while white women are trying to <b>look</b> <b>more</b> ethnic. “White women are risking skin cancer and tanning booths twice a week, Botoxing their lips, getting butt lifts to <b>look</b> <b>more</b> ethnic and crinkling up their hair.” ...|$|R
50|$|Wastri is said {{to dwell}} deep in the Vast Swamp, where he is served by bullywugs and warped humans in a fortress-temple called the Sacred Polystery. There, they breed frogs to <b>look</b> <b>more</b> human, and humans to <b>look</b> <b>more</b> like frogs.|$|R
50|$|The show {{features}} {{young adults}} who undergo plastic surgery {{with the goal of}} <b>looking</b> <b>more</b> like a famous person. Celebrities that participants have chosen to <b>look</b> <b>more</b> like include Pamela Anderson, Jennifer Lopez, Jessica Simpson, Britney Spears, Brad Pitt, Ricky Martin and Victoria Beckham.|$|R
5|$|At the {{juvenile}} stage, a teleost <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> like its adult form. At this stage, its axial skeleton, internal organs, scales, pigmentation and fins are fully developed. The transition from larvae to juvenile can be short and fairly simple, lasting minutes or hours as in some damselfish, while in other species, like salmon, squirrelfish, gobies and flatfishes, {{the transition is}} more complex and takes several weeks to complete. At the adult stage, a teleost is able to produce viable gametes for reproduction. Like many fish, teleosts continue to grow throughout their lives. Longevity depends on the species with some gamefish like European perch and largemouth bass living up to 25 years. Rockfish {{appear to be the}} longest living teleosts with some species living over 100 years.|$|E
5|$|When Brian {{approaches}} Stewie {{about helping}} him find {{a tennis ball}} he'd buried, Stewie asks if Brian remembers the date that he lost it. Brian tells him that he buried it on January 31, 1999 (the day of the series' premiere on Fox). Using Stewie's time machine to travel back to that date, the two soon come upon the Griffin family, but notice that their past <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> strange than they remembered it: The family continually pauses for cutaways, and Meg's voice sounds different. Telling Brian that he mustn't alter the past by getting the tennis ball {{and that he should}} instead memorize its location, Stewie goes into his room to set up their return to the present before Past Stewie suddenly enters. The two Stewies then meet, and Stewie tells Brian to come out from his hiding place after explaining himself to Past Stewie. However, hanging outside the window, Brian fell onto Past Peter's car as he drives to the bachelor party at past Glenn Quagmire's house. Stewie finds Brian and the two then attempt to return to the present, but find that the transportation device's batteries are running low and moved only a bit forward in time towards their destination. Later, the two manage to take advantage of Peter dumping his extra welfare money out of a blimp above Super Bowl XXXIII to collect the money needed to purchase new batteries. It was only after the two return to the present that Stewie learns that Brian intentionally told his past self about the September 11 attacks ahead of time, allowing the Past Brian to beat American Airlines Flight 11 hijackers Mohamed Atta and Abdulaziz al-Omari with a baseball bat, and then preventing the other three planes from leaving the airports.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{examine a}} {{generalized}} version of Flam and Helpman’s (1987) model of vertical differentiation that maps cross-country differences in income distributions to variations in import variety and price distributions. The theoretical predictions are examined and confirmed using micro data on {{income from the}} Luxemburg Income Study for 30 countries over 20 years. The pairs of importers whose income distributions <b>look</b> <b>more</b> similar have more export partners in common and more similar import price distributions. Similarly, the importers whose income distributions <b>look</b> <b>more</b> like the world buy from more exporters and have import price distributions that <b>look</b> <b>more</b> like the world...|$|R

25|$|The Gol Henai small repeating {{pattern is}} named after the Henna plant, which it does not much resemble. The plant <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> like the Garden balsam, and in the Western {{literature}} is sometimes compared to the blossom of the Horse chestnut.|$|E
25|$|A rock {{arch and}} several notable bluffs are formed of late Whaingaroan Ahirau Sandstone formed about 28 million years ago. Although {{classified}} as sandstone, it <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> like limestone, with 40-60% calcium carbonate content and lapiez features in massive (lacking internal structures), blue-grey, calcareous, fine sandstone.|$|E
25|$|The rostrum (snout) {{is unlike}} that of undisputed crown mammals; in fact it <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> {{like that of a}} pelycosaur, such as Dimetrodon. The multituberculate rostrum is box-like, with the large flat maxillae forming the sides, the nasal the top, and the tall premaxilla at the front.|$|E

25|$|Bartlett met John Miller in 1928, {{and they}} {{commenced}} building the new ride. When the ride went into production, {{much of the}} idea was the same, but the cars <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> like monoplanes, which Bartlett designed. Miller worked on the loading station, supporting structure, braking system and incline.|$|E
25|$|A {{more recent}} {{discovery}} is {{of a series}} of new types of carbon molecule, known as the fullerenes (see Curl, 1991). Although C60, the most easily produced fullerene, <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> or less spherical, some of the larger varieties (such as C240, C480 and C960) are hypothesised to take on the form of slightly rounded icosahedra, a few nanometres across.|$|E
25|$|A {{transfer}} caboose <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> like a {{flat car}} with a shed bolted {{to the middle of}} it than it does a standard caboose. It is used in transfer service between rail yards or short switching runs, and as such, lacks sleeping, cooking or restroom facilities. The ends of a transfer caboose are left open, with safety railings surrounding the area between the crew compartment {{and the end of the}} car.|$|E

25|$|The {{movement}} of the human body, and most other objects, needs time to accelerate and slow down. For this reason, animation <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> realistic if it has more drawings near {{the beginning and end}} of an action, emphasizing the extreme poses, and fewer in the middle. This principle goes for characters moving between two extreme poses, such as sitting down and standing up, but also for inanimate, moving objects, like the bouncing ball in the above illustration.|$|E
25|$|Stage 4 <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> male than female, with {{an empty}} scrotum and a phallus {{the size of a}} normal penis, but not quite free enough of the {{perineum}} to be pulled onto the abdomen toward the umbilicus (i.e., what is termed a chordee in a male). The single small urethral/vaginal opening at the base or on the shaft of the phallus would be considered a hypospadias in a male. X-rays taken after dye injection into this opening reveal the internal connection with the upper vagina and uterus. This common opening can predispose to urinary obstruction and infection.|$|E
25|$|Die {{deterioration}} doubling is {{a result}} of a few simple causes, but {{it can be difficult to}} positively identify. There are a number of different features which appear similar, but the characteristic traits of each are easy to identify with practice. Die deterioration doubling is often mistaken for hub doubling. The causes of the two types of doubling are different, but their appearance on the finished coin is often similar. Die deterioration doubling appears most often around the mintmark and date because they are alone in the field. When it occurs in other features, like an image of a bust, it <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> like a weak strike than doubling.|$|E

25|$|The Atlantis DHD is {{more similar}} to the Earth's dialing {{computer}} than an actual DHD, and <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> like a set of crystal panels. It can block out certain gate addresses. The Atlantis DHD also has an extra control-crystal allowing the dialing of an eighth chevron during the dialing sequence {{and is the only}} DHD in the Pegasus Galaxy capable of dialing Earth. A similar DHD is also used on Puddle Jumpers, where the set of used glyphs corresponds to the galaxy of the Puddle Jumper. The Wraith also travel through Stargates in small spacecraft called darts and have some means of remote-dialing them {{in a manner similar to}} Ancient ships.|$|E
25|$|Based on this, Burley's account <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> {{like one}} of mistaken {{identity}} because, while his story matches {{the account of the}} Cordova's demise and subsequent rescue of four crew members in September 1888, the date of the Cordova's foundering was about 26 July 1888. The crew of the Cordova were rescued {{a year and a half}} before the Marlborough might have sailed through the area. Burley, who was born in England in 1871 arrived in Washington in 1890. He may have got the two dates muddled as the report was over 20 years after the event. Even as far back as 1913 Burley's account was thought to have been one of mistaken identity.|$|E
25|$|In non-breeding (eclipse) plumage, the drake <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> {{like the}} hen; {{it is more}} uniform in colour, with a dark head and vestigial facial markings. The hen itself is yellowish-brown, {{somewhat}} darker on wings and back. It has a dark greyish-brown upper head, hindneck, eyestripe and feather pattern. The pattern is dense short streaks {{on the head and}} neck, and scaly spots {{on the rest of the}} body; overall they look much like a tiny mallard (A. platyrhynchos) hen when at rest. The wings are coloured similar to the drake's, but with brown instead of grey upperwing coverts that have less wide tips, and wider tips of the speculum feathers. The hen's rectrices have yellowish-white tips; the midbelly is whitish with some dark streaking.|$|E
