McIlrath also noted that his criticism of the United States government's handling of various disasters influenced the lyrics; he called Hurricane Katrina [...] "as much a man-made disaster as it was a natural disaster", and lambasted the fact that no legislation was passed to prevent another oil spill following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010.|$|E
500|$|When {{designing}} {{the game from}} an artistic viewpoint, the team took various pieces of work as inspiration.

[...] " [...] did these amazingly beautiful, horrific photos... it's not just decay and rot and post-apocalyptic grey, it's a human world that we're playing with when we portray this destruction," [...] said Straley. The concept of post-apocalyptic environments was considered a [...] "starting point" [...] for the artists. The art team also strived to achieve realism within every piece of art. Straley explained that the artists [...] "would be like, I'm {{going to make this}} the most awesome fucking wall ever," [...] in terms of creating attractive environments. The art department were forced to fight for things that they wished to include, due to the high demand during development. Ultimately, the team settled on a balance between simplicity and detail; while Straley and Druckmann preferred the former, the art team preferred the latter. The artistic composition of the game's locations was also a feature strongly focused on, in order to evoke varying emotions from players. In the final weeks of development, roles from the art department were undertaken by other members of the team; for example, Straley hand-arranged the texts on the game's training screens, a task that lead artist Nate Wells found unusual. [...] "I have never even heard of a game director doing that! That's like... an intern task," [...] Wells said.|$|E
50|$|The bass trumpet {{is a type}} of low trumpet {{which was}} first {{developed}} during the 1820s in Germany. It is usually pitched in 8' C or 9' B today, but is sometimes built in E and is treated as a transposing instrument sounding either an octave, a sixth or a <b>ninth</b> <b>lower</b> than written, depending on the pitch of the instrument. Having valves and the same tubing length, the bass trumpet is quite similar to the valve trombone, although the bass trumpet has a harder, more metallic tone. Certain modern manufacturers offering 'valve trombones' and 'bass trumpets' use the same tubing, valves, and bell, in different configurations - in these cases the bass trumpet is virtually identical to the valve trombone.|$|R

It is also sometimes used, along with tenor clef, for the highest notes played by bass-clef instruments such as the cello, double bass (which sounds an octave lower), bassoon, and trombone. The viola also sometimes uses treble clef for very high notes. Treble clef is used for the soprano, mezzo-soprano, alto, contralto and tenor voices. The tenor voice sounds an octave lower, and is often written using an octave clef (see below) or double-treble clef.|$|R

Strategic planning {{is a tool}} for organizations to identify those challenges and opportunities. Every organization needs to evaluate itself, determine its mission and its role. We are no different, so every five years we conduct a strategic planning process. Early this year we will conduct a strategic planning session and ask some basic questions, including: “How are we doing, what is our future role in the Region, and what challenges will we need to address? ” If you have any thoughts or ideas on this topic let me know. The findings of this effort {{will be used to}} guide our organization in 2011 and beyond. Our organization continues to operate with the mantra of doing more with less. As you may know the annual levy rate for 2011 was <b>lowered</b> again, the <b>ninth</b> consecutive decrease. The levy now makes up about 28 percent of the overall budget, while several years ago it peaked at over 45 percent of the overall budget. The NCWRPC is committed to providing real cost savings to its members, while still providing a high level of service. Later this year the Association of Wisconsin Regional Planning Commissions will sponsor its second “Capital Days ” in Madison. This is an opportunity to meet with many of the Region’s newly elected officials and promote the needs of our Region and the efforts of Regional Planning to assist our communities reach their goals.
