25|$|If {{the disks}} are {{connected}} to a RAID controller, it is most efficient to configure it as a HBA in JBOD mode (i.e. turn off RAID function). If a hardware RAID card is used, ZFS always detects all data corruption but cannot always repair data corruption because the hardware RAID card will interfere. Therefore, the recommendation is to not use a hardware RAID card, or to flash a hardware RAID card into JBOD/IT mode. For ZFS {{to be able to}} guarantee data integrity, it needs to either have access to a RAID set (so all data is copied to at least two disks), or if one single disk is used, ZFS needs to enable redundancy (copies) which duplicates the data on the same <b>logical</b> <b>drive.</b> Using ZFS copies is a good feature to use on notebooks and desktop computers, since the disks are large and it at least provides some limited redundancy with just a single drive.|$|E

5000|$|Using RPM it is {{possible}} to convert logical drives to primary partitions. In RPM this is done by [...] "deleting" [...] the <b>logical</b> <b>drive,</b> moving the beginning of the [...] "extended partition" [...] (type 0x0F) forward, recreating a primary [...] "partition" [...] in the same location as the <b>logical</b> <b>drive,</b> then saving the changes. The process is reversed to convert a primary partition to a <b>logical</b> <b>drive.</b> However, before or after these conversions the partition must deviate from a standard CHS alignment, because logical drives usually start on the second head (head 1) while primary partitions usually start {{at the beginning of a}} cylinder.|$|E

This makes it {{impossible}} to add a partition when the partition table has approximately 3 primary partitions, plus an [...] "extended partition" [...] with 28 <b>logical</b> <b>drives.</b> <b>Logical</b> <b>drives</b> require two lines minimum. Free spaces between drives usually use a line each.|$|R

50|$|The {{consistency}} group (CG) term {{is used for}} grouping several LUNs together {{in order to ensure}} write-order consistency over several volumes. This is used for example with a database that stores its data and journal on different <b>logical</b> <b>drives.</b> These <b>logical</b> <b>drives</b> must be kept in-sync on the replica if data-consistency needs to be preserved. Other examples are multi-volume file systems such as ZFS or Windows' Dynamic Disks.|$|R

5000|$|OS/2: Under OS/2, {{if you use}} the [...] parameter, which {{specifies}} a long format, then format will overwrite {{the entire}} partition or <b>logical</b> <b>drive.</b> Doing so enhances the ability of CHKDSK to recover files.|$|E

50|$|The system {{supported}} up to 4 physical {{disk drives}} (the actual number was {{limited by the}} disk ROM installed) and as many hard disk partitions {{as the number of}} letters in the Latin alphabet, which could be used as separate <b>logical</b> <b>drives,</b> each with a volume of up to 32 MB (See also: drive letter assignment). Starting from version 3.0 the system also supported mounting disk images as <b>logical</b> <b>drives.</b> When booted on a BK-0011 or BK-0011M the system automatically created a RAM disk in the computer's memory.|$|R
5000|$|Starting primary {{partitions}} on head 1 (instead of head 0) {{has another}} advantage. It allows bit-identical cloning of these primary partitions, to logical drives, making completely normal (usual) logical drives. That is, the EBRs of the logical drives {{are at the}} beginning of a cylinder, the <b>logical</b> <b>drive</b> begins on the very next head, and the <b>logical</b> <b>drive</b> ends on a cylinder boundary. However this author has not tested installing or booting operating systems from primary partitions beginning on the head 1, which were not the first partition.

50|$|A {{parallel}} {{development in}} MS-DOS / PC DOS which allowed {{an increase in}} the maximum possible FAT size was the introduction of multiple FAT partitions on a hard disk. To allow the use of more FAT partitions in a compatible way, a new partition type was introduced in PC DOS 3.2 (1986), the extended partition (EBR), which is a container for an additional partition called <b>logical</b> <b>drive.</b> Since PC DOS 3.3 (April 1987), there is another, optional extended partition containing the next <b>logical</b> <b>drive,</b> and so on. The MBR of a hard disk can either define up to four primary partitions, or an extended partition in addition to up to three primary partitions.|$|E
50|$|In {{redundant}} {{array of}} independent disks (RAID) devices and storage area networks (SANs) and where <b>logical</b> <b>drives</b> (<b>logical</b> unit numbers, LUNs) are composed via LUN virtualization and aggregation, LBA addressing of individual disk should be translated by a software layer to provide uniform LBA addressing {{for the entire}} storage device.|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} support Java applications, the FlexOS-based IBM 4690 OS version 2 {{introduced}} its own virtual file system (VFS) architecture to store long filenames in the FAT file system in a backwards compatible fashion.

50|$|Information {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{valuable}} assets in today's business environments. Once virtualized, the meta-data are the glue in the middle.

5000|$|APFS {{adds the}} ability to have {{multiple}} <b>logical</b> <b>drives</b> (referred to as Volumes) in the same container where free space is available to all volumes in that container.

50|$|In {{the context}} of {{computer}} operating systems, a volume or <b>logical</b> <b>drive</b> is a single accessible storage area with a single file system, typically (though not necessarily) resident on a single partition of a hard disk. Although a volume might be different from a physical disk drive, it can still be accessed with an operating system's logical interface. However, a volume differs from a partition.|$|E
5000|$|High-level {{formatting}} {{creates the}} file system format within a disk partition or a logical volume. This formatting includes the data structures {{used by the}} OS to identify the <b>logical</b> <b>drive</b> or partition's contents. This may occur during operating system installation, or when adding a new disk. Disk and distributed file system may specify an optional boot block, and/or various volume and directory information for the operating system.|$|E
5000|$|DL is {{supported}} by IBM BIOSes {{as well as most}} other BIOSes. The Toshiba T1000 BIOS is known to not support this properly, and some old Wyse 286 BIOSes use DL values greater or equal to 2 for fixed disks (thereby reflecting the <b>logical</b> <b>drive</b> numbers under DOS rather than the physical drive numbers of the BIOS). USB sticks configured as removable drives typically get an assignment of DL = 80hex, 81hex, etc. However, some rare BIOSes erroneously presented them under DL = 01hex, just as if they were configured as superfloppies.|$|E
50|$|RPM {{may show}} an error if the EBRs {{are not on}} the {{beginning}} of a head (relative {{to the beginning of the}} extended partition—type 0F). If partition alignments of this sort, are ignored, and the partition is edited by Windows XP disk manager, XP may delete the <b>logical</b> <b>drives.</b> This can happen if the extended partition is first edited by Windows Vista or Windows 7.|$|R
5000|$|CP/CMS uses drive {{letters to}} {{identify}} minidisks {{attached to a}} user session. A full file reference (pathname in today's parlance) consists of a filename, a filetype, and a disk letter called a filemode (e.g. A or B). Minidisks can correspond to physical disk drives, but more typically refer to <b>logical</b> <b>drives,</b> which are mapped automatically onto shared devices by the operating system as sets of virtual cylinders.|$|R

5000|$|Unlike the fdisk {{programs}} for other operating systems, the fdisk {{programs for}} DOS and Windows 9x/Me not only alter {{data in the}} partition table, but will also overwrite many sectors of data in the partition itself.

5000|$|Greyhole, a disk-pooling application, {{implements}} what {{it calls}} a [...] "storage pool".

Greyhole also provides data redundancy through software - the user can configure, per share, the number of file copies that Greyhole is to maintain. Greyhole will then ensure that for each file in such shares, the correct number of extra copies are created and maintained on multiple physical drives. The user will only ever see one copy of each file.|$|E

50|$|Unlike primary partitions, {{which are}} all {{described}} by a single partition table within the MBR, and thus limited in number, each EBR precedes the logical partition it describes.
