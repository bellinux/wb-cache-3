40|$|One {{response}} to the Frankfurtian attack on the Principle of Alternate Possibilities is to advert to the observation that the agent’s actual action (or the particular event resulting <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>action)</b> is numerically distinct from the corresponding action (or the resultant event) he would have generated in the relevant counterfactual scenario. Since this response is based on taking actions and events to be fragile, I shall call it the fragilist account of alternative possibilities.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of interorganizational networks {{is shaped by}} an endogenous dynamic between embedded organizational action and the social structure <b>that</b> emerges <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>action.</b> Organizations enter ties to access critical resources, but they rely on signals from the emerging network to decide with whom to form partnerships. Consistent with this image, the authors show that {{the probability of a}} new alliance between specific organizations increases with their interdependence, but also with their prior mutual alliances, common third parties, and centrality in the alliance network. The structural differentiation of the emerging network mitigates the effect of interdependence and enhances the effect of network centrality on new alliance formation...|$|R

Nothing is more evident than that the epithet of virtue is inapplicable to the refraining <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>action</b> on account of the evil arbitrarily attached to it.

5000|$|Although not all deontologists are religious, {{some believe}} in the 'divine command theory'. The divine command theory is a cluster of related {{theories}} that state <b>that</b> an <b>action</b> is right if God has decreed that it is right. William of Ockham, René Descartes and eighteenth-century Calvinists all accepted versions of this moral theory, according to Ralph Cudworth, as they all held that moral obligations arise from God's commands. The Divine Command Theory {{is a form of}} deontology because, according to it, the rightness of any <b>action</b> depends upon <b>that</b> <b>action</b> being performed because it is a duty, not because of any good consequences arising <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>action.</b> If God commands people not to work on Sabbath, then people act rightly if they do not work on Sabbath because God has commanded that they do not do so. If they do not work on Sabbath because they are lazy, then their action is not truly speaking [...] "right", even though the actual physical action performed is the same. If God commands not to covet a neighbour's goods, this theory holds that it would be immoral to do so, even if coveting provides the beneficial outcome of a drive to succeed or do well.|$|R
