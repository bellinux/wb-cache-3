25|$|In 1985, Masson {{edited and}} {{translated}} Freud's complete correspondence with Wilhelm Fliess after having convinced Anna Freud {{to make it}} available in full. He also <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> original places and documents in La Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris, where Freud had studied with Charcot. Masson writes that the scientific community has been largely silent about his views. Several Freud scholars have disputed the traditional story that Freud's seduction theory patients reported having been sexually abused in early childhood, the basis on which Masson built his case.|$|E
25|$|Whilst {{discussing}} the organic nature of Kikutake's theoretical Marine City project, Kawazoe used the Japanese word shinchintaisha as being {{symbolic of the}} essential exchange of materials and energy between organisms and the exterior world (literally metabolism in a biological sense.) The Japanese {{meaning of the word}} has a feeling of replacement of the old with the new and the group further interpreted this to be equivalent to the continuous renewal and organic growth of the city. As the conference was to be a world conference, Kawazoe felt that they should use a more universal word and Kikutake <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> definition of shinchintaisha in his Japanese-English dictionary. The translation he found was the word Metabolism.|$|E
25|$|In Norden's {{version of}} the system, the bombardier first <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{expected}} time {{it would take for}} the bombs to fall from the current altitude. This time was set into a countdown stopwatch, and the bombardier waited for the target to line up with a set of iron sights {{at the front of the}} bombsight. When the target passed through the sights, the timer was started, and the bombardier then rotated the telescope around its vertical axis to track the target as they approached it. This movement was linked to a second sight through a gearing system that caused the second to move twice as fast as the first. The bombardier continued moving the telescope until the timer ran out. The second sight was now at the correct aiming angle, or range angle; the bombardier moved his eyes to look through this second set of sights to time the drop.|$|E

500|$|The album's {{title is}} a {{reference}} to the binaural recording techniques that were utilized on several tracks. Binaural literally means [...] "having or relating to two ears."

So it seemed like a fitting title for the album." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite its scale, {{the customs}} line and {{associated}} hedge were not widely known in either Britain or India, the standard {{histories of the}} period neglecting to mention them. Roy Moxham, a conservator at the University of London library, wrote {{a book on the}} customs line and his search for its remains that was published in 2001. [...] This followed his finding, in 1995, of a passing mention of the hedge in Major-General Sir William Henry Sleeman's work Rambles and Recollections of an Indian Official. [...] Moxham <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> hedge in the India Office Records of the British Library and determined to locate its remnants.|$|E
500|$|Naming {{the train}} was a task that was very seriously taken by Budd.

[...] The name of the new train came from The Canterbury Tales, which Budd had been reading. The story begins with pilgrims setting out on a journey, inspired by the budding springtime and by Zephyrus, the gentle and nurturing west wind. Budd thought that would be an excellent name for a sleek new traveling machine—Zephyr.|$|E

500|$|Incorporating Nixon {{into the}} plot was accidental; Moffat {{wanted to set}} the story during the moon landing and <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> United States {{president}} during the time. He was initially disappointed that {{it was such a}} [...] "rubbish one" [...] and briefly considered using a generic, unnamed president, such as the one seen in [...] "The Sound of Drums". However, he thought it [...] "didn't feel right for a story partly about real events" [...] and realized it could be fun to use Nixon. He believed there was something [...] "comically awkward" [...] about him, and it would be interesting for the Doctor to have to work with someone he did not like. The episode makes references to the Watergate scandal and David Frost.|$|E
500|$|During the 1920s and 1930s many skyscrapers were {{designed}} in an Art Deco style. This architectural approach typically combined what Carol Willis terms an [...] "aesthetic of simple, sculptural mass" [...] {{with the use}} of rich colour and ornamentation on the surfaces of the buildings. The aim was {{to call attention to the}} increasingly complex three-dimensional shape of the skyscraper, in contrast to earlier styles which could be critiqued, as historian Larry Ford suggests, as being merely [...] "short buildings made taller with additional stories". Windows were de-emphasised in favour of creating a strong sense of shape and mass, the surrounding walls treated as textured fabric, dressing the building underneath. Skyscrapers of this period typically lost their ornamental horizontal divisions, being broken up by physical changes in their shape as one <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> building, the whole forming a striking silhouette.|$|E

Zayat's son, Justin, ran a contest on social media in which fans could submit names for the horse. The winning entry had [...] "Pharaoh" [...] misspelled, she said. [...] "Justin cut and pasted the name from [...] email, {{and sent it to}} the Jockey Club." [...] Marsha Baumgartner of Barnett, Missouri, who submitted the winning entry, told The New York Times, [...] "I don't want to assign blame," [...] but [...] "I <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> spelling before I entered." [...] Nonetheless, Baumgartner minimized the controversy, stating, [...] "Horses can't spell, anyway." [...] Ultimately, Justin Zayat accepted responsibility for the error, stating, [...] "I didn't happen to realize at the time that it was misspelled wrong... Most English teachers in the world now are unhappy with me, but I'll live with that." ...|$|E

He claimed to {{not use the}} bathroom any more than usual and that several others did so too without penalty. Bindrich denied {{that he went to}} the toilet on his turn, saying that there were witnesses there who could confirm this. He stated that, in his game with Tregubov, [...] "... after reaching a clear advantage I didn't play the best way possible, as anyone who plays through the game at home can easily establish" [...] and Tregubov had played the same opening three weeks earlier against Andrei Istratescu, and that he'd <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> theory to the line that was played.

500|$|Two {{scenes in}} which Stewie {{graphically}} beats up Brian using a glass filled with orange juice, various household objects, and guns polarized people who viewed it. Several production members were offended. Cast members—as well as MacFarlane's mother and an animal rights advocate—enjoyed the scene; MacFarlane quoted his mother: [...] "I don't {{see what the}} problem is? He (Brian) owed him (Stewie) money!", {{and so it was}} kept in the final cut. When Lois gives the finger to the camera during the interview with Peter and Brady, her hand was blurred out on Fox airings of the episode. However, reruns on Adult Swim and TBS left the gesture intact. The gesture was also left intact on the DVD of [...] "Volume Four"; the production team enjoyed having this level of freedom. After the initial airing of the episode, where newscaster Tom Tucker announces a report on a fictional curse word, clemen, many viewers <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> word on the Internet {{to try to find a}} definition. MacFarlane stated in the episode's DVD commentary that if someone invents an obscene definition for the word, the show will have to stop using it (it has not been used since this episode).|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{about the}} season's use of 1940s terminology, Fazekas stated that terms like [...] "broad" [...] and [...] "dame" [...] were preferably avoided, while {{research}} {{was done to}} ensure terms {{that were used in}} the series were actually in use during that time, with Fazekas giving the example, [...] "you know what didn't exist in 1946? Smart ass. I <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> etymology on that, didn't exist in 1946. Turns out it was a term that came around in the 60s. But for instance, I wrote a line that said, [...] "Oh I think someone's yanking your chain." [...] And I had to look it up, did that exist in 1946? And actually it did; it's a mining term that exists from a long time ago. That's our research that we do." [...] Research was also done on radio shows of the time to ensure realism when creating the fictional Captain America Adventure Program, with details discovered and replicated on the series including the use of lobsters and ham to create sound effects for the radio show. The Griffith Hotel, the all-women boarding house where Carter lives, is based on the real-life Barbizon Hotel for Women. Butters felt that while working in the time period, it became an issue to not sound [...] "too period". Additionally, it was difficult to write British people from the time in order to avoid stereotypes such as the [...] "typical British butler". However, D'Arcy, who is British, felt the writing staff wrote the British characters better than anyone else he had worked with, despite there not being any British writers on the staff.|$|E

2500|$|The {{question}} of who fired first remained unresolved years after the massacre. The Mexican government said gunfire from the surrounding apartments prompted the army's attack. But the students said that the helicopters appeared to signal the army to fire into the crowd. Journalist Elena Poniatowska culled interviews from those present and described events in her book Massacre in Mexico: [...] "Flares suddenly appeared in the sky overhead and everyone automatically <b>looked</b> <b>up.</b> <b>The</b> first shots were heard then.

2500|$|Rick Rubin {{produced}} [...] "The Greatest Man That Ever Lived" [...] {{with the}} band between April 2007 and February 2008. In the liner notes of the deluxe edition of The Red Album, Cuomo stated that the song did not originally have the subtitle [...] "Variations on a Shaker Hymn", but when guitarist Brian Bell's mother came into the studio to see them, she mentioned that the melody from the song sounded similar to a Shaker hymn that the choir sang in her church. Cuomo wrote that he realised that people might notice the resemblance: [...] "I knew {{people were going to}} come at us after and say 'Hey, you guys ripped off that hymn.' So I put the credit in there off the bat." [...] As a result, the band <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> hymn and indeed the melody was so similar to Joseph Brackett's [...] "Simple Gifts" [...] that they credited the hymn with the subtitle.|$|E
2500|$|... "Iqbal Qasim came in, {{a little}} left-hander. I {{chose to go}} round the wicket and {{obviously}} we put men round the bat, 'Brears' (Mike Brearley the captain) at first slip, Graham Roope, Bob Willis, 'Both' all round the bat. I just bowled it right and it was magic really; it just turned a fraction and bounced, and 'Iqqie' nicked it. Brears just dived to his left and caught the ball about a foot off the ground, landed in front of Roopey and Willis, Iqqie just <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> wicket at me, nodded, said, 'Well bowled'; the umpire went bananas, shaking hands and saying, 'I've never seen a hat-trick before, well bowled.' And ironically this was on my debut. 12 months previously, on the same ground, Peter Petherick of New Zealand had just done the first hat-trick ever on debut, so {{it would have been}} 12 months to the day {{and it would have been}} a unique place in history." [...] "But Mike in landing got a lot of gravel on the back of his hand. Iqqie left the field and all the lads were up there when suddenly Brears started saying, ‘I’m going to bring him back because I don't think I caught it cleanly.' All the lads around him were adamant he had caught it a foot off the ground, but he said, 'No, for the best interests of this series I'm going to bring him back.' So he brought him back – and for the best interests of the series, six of us were lbw in our first innings. It happened, but it was a moment of disappointment because something like that on a Test debut is very special. As somebody once said, 'If bad luck hadn't been invented, we'd have had none at all!'" ...|$|E
