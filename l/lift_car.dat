500|$|During the 1880s, Antony had Henry Woodyer {{redesign}} {{the hallway}} staircase. This allowed more light to permeate the lower floors from the glazed lantern roof, and hence turn the hallway into a reception room. Woodyer also extended the Dining Room by taking {{in part of}} the original housekeeper's room. Crace's original wallpaper– a British imitation of Japanese paper, that itself imitated Spanish tooled leather– was lightened by a 14-year-old apprentice who hand-painted in a cream background. The sideboard, which had been commissioned from Collier and Plucknett, was further extended. New items were also ordered from Collier and Plucknett. Simultaneously, Antony had electricity installed, an early UK example of houses being lit in this way. Antony spent the first night after turning on the electrical system watching the main entrance light, to ensure that it did not create a fire and was hence safe for his family. At some point between 1868 and 1884 a water hydraulic lift was installed by Waygood and Co., the remains of which were discovered in 2008. A wooden <b>lift</b> <b>car</b> was discovered on the ground floor and a [...] spanning sheave in the roof space.|$|E

5000|$|The {{internal}} lift of {{the building}} is clearly audible, and Clegg surveys Klein's movements, when he arrives. She interrupts his inspections when {{he is about to}} open the roof door. She takes him to the lift, sending him downwards. However, just as she is talking him off, she sees Waxman sitting on top of the <b>lift</b> <b>car.</b> He mounts a bomb on the <b>lift</b> <b>car</b> and, when the car begins moving, nearly falls down the shaft. He is saved by Clegg, and they both attempt keeping up the [...] "just business"-facade, although some romantic appreciation is apparent.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, {{the firm}} Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates began {{renovation}} work {{in consultation with}} English Heritage and the City of London to make alterations to the interior work space.

50|$|The {{original}} lifts for {{the journey}} between {{the second and third}} levels were supplied by Léon Edoux. A pair of 81 m hydraulic rams were mounted on the second level, reaching nearly halfway up to the third level. One <b>lift</b> <b>car</b> was mounted on top of these rams: cables ran from the top of this car up to sheaves on the third level and back down to a second car. Each car only travelled half the distance between the second and third levels and passengers were required to change lifts halfway by means of a short gangway. The 10-ton cars each held 65 passengers.|$|E
50|$|It is a three-storey brick {{building}} with a pitched corrugated iron roof concealed behind an elaborate parapet. The facade has a painted stucco finish, round-headed timber windows and door openings arched with false stonework, attached columns, pilasters, triangular pediments and projecting mouldings, all in Federation Free Classical style. It features an elegant first floor balcony, cantilevered out over the pavement on both street frontages, supported on cast iron decorative brackets, cast iron columns and lacework with a bullnosed corrugated iron roof. The interior features include timber floor and roof construction, plastered wall finishes, timber joinery and mouldings, and decorative plaster ceilings, a decorative timber staircase, a metal <b>lift</b> <b>car</b> with leadlight doors and some leaded glass in fanlights to windows in the Hay Street facade.|$|E
50|$|Upstairs, {{the two are}} {{engaging}} the target. As before, Waxman hesitates and doesn't take the shot. As history repeats itself for the two, Clegg pulls her sidearm and implores Waxman to do his duty. Before the situation escalates, another shooter shoots the target four times and, when finished, takes aim for Clegg and Waxman. Waxman quickly throws himself and Clegg away from the shot, grabs his rifle and shoots the adversary. Waxman and Clegg defend themselves from Special Forces personnel raiding the skyscraper. Waxman and Clegg are surprised by Klein, who has stealthily entered the room. He shoots Waxman in the chest with his shotgun, but is threatened by Clegg who has picked up an MP5 submachine gun. He takes the <b>lift</b> <b>car</b> and leaves when the planted bomb explodes.|$|E

50|$|During the 1950s, a {{manufacturing}} {{was started in}} Solna (Sweden) by chain-driven hoists with <b>lift</b> <b>car</b> for rated loads between 200 to 1000 kg. Manufacturing and sales amounted to approx. 30 lifts / year under the brand name Elektroborg. MSc Bertil Svedberg founded the company Cibes in 1947, took over the business Elektroborg during the 1950s.Stenfors Industries in Skillingaryd, Sweden, contract manufactured in the mid-1960s, a housing adapted lift for disabled, the product consisted of a lift table with guardrails, Cibes handled the sales activities of the lift during the 1970s, developed the product and made it accessible {{for the use of}} wheelchairs. This lift was a pioneering product in the disability field, with a design where the car was driven with a screw rod, built on a tripod with legs. This wheelchair lift had a design with inbuilt safety aspects as early as the late 1970s, and was recommended in buildings by the Swedish Work Environment Authority.|$|E
5000|$|The {{exterior}} scenes on New Earth {{were shot}} at Worm's Head on the Gower Peninsula on 26 September 2005. The hospital basement scenes were recorded at Tredegar House in Newport. The {{location for the}} pods containing the human specimens was a disused paper mill previously used as {{the base of the}} Nestene Consciousness in [...] "Rose". The hospital scenes were filmed inside the Wales Millennium Centre. When the Doctor asks about the shop and points to where he would put it, he points to the location of the centre's own Portmeirion shop. The nightclub the Doctor and Rose take Cassandra (as Chip) to at the end was filmed at the restaurant Ba Orient in Cardiff Bay. As it was filmed during the day, the building was covered with black drapes. The exterior shots of the <b>lift</b> <b>car</b> as Rose descends to the basement are reused footage from [...] "Rose". Cassandra's face and body was put in during post-production by The Mill.|$|E

50|$|From {{the time}} it was built one shaft was {{specifically}} used by the British Standards Institution (BSI) for type testing of lift safety components at the time under the BS5655 and BS EN81 standards. Safety Gear testing involved putting the <b>lift</b> <b>cars</b> (frame) into free fall conditions with rated mass at tripping speeds as required by the designers of the safety gear to ensure the <b>lift</b> <b>cars</b> decelerated and stopped within the requirements of the standard. Buffer testing involved impacting them with the maximum and minimum mass at tripping speeds to ensure decelerations were within that requirement by the standard in both cases the aim was to ensure if the lift ever went into free fall or uncontrolled downward movement the safety components stopped the lift without causing any serious injury to the occupant. BSI ceased using the test tower soon after the site was acquired for housing in 1997-98.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{kinetic energy}} of <b>lift</b> <b>car</b> will be {{consumed}} by the friction between the safety gear and guide rail in emergent braking process. This will lead to remarkable temperate increase of frictional surface. Due to the explosive atmospheres in which the explosive-proof lift servers, the high temperature may result in severe explosion accident. In this paper, an finite element model is developed to analysis this progress. The transient heat flux density is derived from energy transformation progress in safety gear action, and applied as boundary condition to the finite element model. Experiments are carried out to measure the temperature increase of safety gear frictional surface, and the results show good coincidence of temperature increase tendency between experiments and simulations...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} two digital filters {{are applied to}} {{elaborate}} acceleration data acquired from two accelerometers fixed in a lift frame during safety gears tests. The experimental tests consist in free falls of a test <b>lift</b> <b>car</b> and the subsequent gripping phases initiated by the safety gears activation due to over-speed condition. Unfortunately, the reliability of acceleration data is heavily impaired by measurement noise, which needs to be suppressed to the largest extent possible {{in order to use}} the data for comfort evaluation. To this end, two classes of digital filters are tested: the Savitzky–Golay and the Butterworth filters. This choice is motivated by the key features of these filters, including their computational simplicity and high suitability to represent time varying features in acceleration measurements. A tuning procedure is proposed for these filters, such that the measurement noise corrupting the experimental data is maximally dumped...|$|E
