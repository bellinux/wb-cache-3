5|$|Blake {{arrived at}} St Helen's Pool in April 1651 {{and set about}} taking the island of Tresco, attacking the harbour of Old Grimsby and the blockhouse. Blake {{deployed}} a force of men in small boats, but they <b>landed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wrong island {{and had to be}} recalled to the ships. The next day the men <b>landed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> beaches below the blockhouse; fighting ensued and the attackers were driven back. Blake's men made another landing which also saw fierce resistance, and the guns of the blockhouse were probably turned on the landing parties. Around 15 of the assault force were killed, but the guns of Blake's ships guns had a longer range than those of the blockhouse and Old Grimsby fell. Blake went on to use Tresco as a basis for taking St Mary's.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Morotai, {{part of the}} Pacific War, {{began on}} 15 September 1944, and {{continued}} {{until the end of}} the war in August 1945. The fighting started when United States and Australian forces <b>landed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> southwest corner of Morotai, a small island in the Netherlands East Indies (NEI), which the Allies needed as a base to support the liberation of the Philippines later that year. The invading forces greatly outnumbered the island's Japanese defenders and secured their objectives in two weeks. Japanese reinforcements <b>landed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island between September and November, but lacked the supplies needed to effectively attack the Allied defensive perimeter. Intermittent fighting continued {{until the end of the}} war, with the Japanese troops suffering heavy loss of life from disease and starvation.|$|E

5|$|After {{having won}} {{control of the}} seas, a Roman force <b>landed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> African coast under Marcus Regulus, who was at first victorious, winning the Battle of Adys and forcing Carthage to sue for peace. However, the terms of peace that Rome {{proposed}} were so heavy that negotiations failed, and in response, the Carthaginians hired Xanthippus of Carthage, a mercenary from the martial Greek city-state of Sparta, to reorganise and lead their army. Xanthippus managed {{to cut off the}} Roman army from its base by re-establishing Carthaginian naval supremacy and then defeated and captured Regulus at the Battle of Tunis.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the castle}} could be completed, however, the French attacked. Admiral Claude d'Annebault crossed the Channel and arrived off the Solent with 200 ships on 19 July, where the local {{authorities}} feared Sandown Castle might be {{the target of a}} night attack. 2,000 French soldiers men <b>landed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Isle of Wight and attacked Sandown, where labourers were still present. Their advance soon stalled, however, and the French retreated back to their fleet, bringing the invasion threat to an end; the castle was finally completed after their departure.|$|E

In 1946, {{after the end of}} the war, Lady Wraxall applied to the Ministry of Defence for a repair grant, but was turned down. As a result damp, and latterly birds, entered the house through the roof light, until the house came into the {{ownership}} of the National Trust and was repaired.|$|E
