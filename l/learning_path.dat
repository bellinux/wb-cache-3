40|$|AbstractAdaptive {{e-learning}} {{materials can}} help teachers to educate heterogeneous student groups. This study provides empirical {{data about the}} way academic students differ in their learning when using adaptive e-learning materials. Ninety-four students participated in the study. We determined characteristics in a heterogeneous student group by collecting demographic data and measuring motivation and prior knowledge. We also measured the <b>learning</b> <b>paths</b> students followed and learning strategies they used when working with adaptive e-learning material in a molecular biology course. We then combined these data to study if and how student characteristics relate to the <b>learning</b> <b>paths</b> and strategies they used. We observed that students did follow different <b>learning</b> <b>paths.</b> Gender {{did not have an}} effect, but (mainly Dutch) BSc students differed from (international) MSc students in the intrinsic motivation they had and the <b>learning</b> <b>paths</b> and strategies they followed when using the adaptive e-learning material...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{e-learning}} systems {{have promised to}} change the way people learn. However open issues still remain, in particular actual e-learning environments do not consider learning activities as {{part of the process of}} learning. Thus, it is not possible to define structured courses and specify precise <b>learning</b> <b>paths</b> apt to guide learners through learning materials. In our approach, we define courses as workflows. By so doing we can exploit powerful procedural rules in order to define precise while flexible <b>learning</b> <b>paths.</b> In this paper we present Virtual Campus, a research project sponsored by Microsoft Research (UK) and developed at Politecnico di Milano, that exploits a workflow engine to enacts the fruition of structured courses. Our platform provides both an authoring and a fruition environment. The former allows teachers to define and customize <b>learning</b> <b>paths,</b> publishing them as workflows. The fruition environment enacts the workflows and guides learners through the related <b>learning</b> <b>paths.</b> We also describe an experience in using the platform during a Software Engineering course composed by heterogeneous activities (lectures, studying activities, cooperative sessions of work, and exams) ...|$|R

40|$|How {{teachers}} {{think about}} student thinking informs {{the ways in}} which teachers teach. By examining teachers’ anticipation of student thinking we can begin to unpack the assumptions teachers make about teaching and learning. Using a “mathematics for teaching” framework, this research examines and compares the sorts of assumptions teachers make in relation to “student content knowledge” versus actual “learning paths” taken by students. Groups of teachers, who have advanced degrees in mathematics, education, and mathematics education, and tenth grade students engaged in a common mathematical task. Teachers were asked to model, in their completion of the task, possible <b>learning</b> <b>paths</b> students might take. Our findings suggest that teachers, in general, had difficulty anticipating student <b>learning</b> <b>paths.</b> Furthermore, this difficulty might be attributed to their significant “specialized content knowledge” of mathematics. We propose, through this work, that examining student <b>learning</b> <b>paths</b> may be a fruitful locus of inquiry for developing both pre-service and in-service teachers’ knowledge about mathematics for teaching...|$|R
