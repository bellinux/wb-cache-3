40|$|<b>Lung</b> <b>diseases</b> are {{described}} by {{a wide variety of}} developmental mechanisms and clinical manifestations. Accurate classification and diagnosis of <b>lung</b> <b>diseases</b> are the bases for development of effective treatments. While extensive studies are conducted towards characterization of various <b>lung</b> <b>diseases</b> at molecular level, no systematic approach has been developed so far. Here we have applied a methodology for pathway-centered mining of high throughput gene expression data to describe a wide range of <b>lung</b> <b>diseases</b> in the light of shared and specific pathway activity profiles. We have applied an algorithm combining a Pathway Signal Flow algorithm for estimation of pathway activity deregulation states in <b>lung</b> <b>diseases</b> and malignancies, and a Self Organizing Maps algorithm for classification and clustering of the pathway activity profiles. The analysis results allowed clearly distinguish between cancer and non-cancer <b>lung</b> <b>diseases.</b> <b>Lung</b> cancers were characterized by pathways implicated in cell proliferation, metabolism, while non-malignant <b>lung</b> <b>diseases</b> were characterized by deregulations in pathways involved in immune/inflammatory response and fibrotic tissue remodeling. In contrast to lung malignancies, chronic <b>lung</b> <b>diseases</b> had relatively heterogeneous pathway deregulation profiles. We identified three groups of interstitial <b>lung</b> <b>diseases</b> and showed that the development of characteristic pathological processes, such as fibrosis, can be initiated by deregulations in different signaling pathways. In conclusion, this paper describes the pathobiology of <b>lung</b> <b>diseases</b> from systems viewpoint using pathway centered high-dimensional data mining approach. Our results contribute largely to current understanding of pathological events in lung cancers and non-malignant <b>lung</b> <b>diseases...</b>|$|R

5|$|A primary {{pneumothorax}} is {{one that}} occurs without an apparent cause {{and in the absence}} of significant <b>lung</b> <b>disease,</b> while a secondary pneumothorax occurs in the presence of existing <b>lung</b> <b>disease.</b> Smoking increases the risk as do lung diseases including COPD, asthma, and tuberculosis.

40|$|Purpose: Orphan <b>lung</b> <b>diseases</b> {{are defined}} as <b>lung</b> <b>diseases</b> with a {{prevalence}} of 1 or less in 2, 000 individuals.

To obtain epidemiologic and demographic data on these diseases, we systematically reviewed reports on pediatric orphan <b>lung</b> <b>diseases</b> in Korea over the last 50 years. Methods: We reviewed 223 articles that have appeared since 1958 on orphan <b>lung</b> <b>diseases</b> in Korean children. These articles described a total of 519 patients aged between 0 and 18 years. We classified patients by year of publication, diagnosis, geographic region, and journal. Results: Of 519 patients, 401 had congenital cystic <b>lung</b> <b>diseases</b> and 66 had bronchiolitis obliterans.

40|$|AbstractThe lung is {{a unique}} {{interface}} between the antigen and the circulating blood volume.
