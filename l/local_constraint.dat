Affine-invariant {{properties}} are an abstract class of properties that generalize some central algebraic ones, such as linearity and low-degree-ness, {{that have been}} studied extensively {{in the context of}} property testing.

40|$|Structural {{topology}} optimization {{problems have been}} traditionally stated and solved by means of maximum stiffness formulations. On the other hand, some effort {{has been devoted to}} stating and solving this kind of problems by means of minimum weight formulations with stress (and/or displacement) constraints. It seems clear that the latter approach is closer to the engineering point of view, but it also leads to more complicated optimization problems, since a large number of highly non-linear (<b>local)</b> <b>constraints</b> {{must be taken into account}} to limit the maximum stress (and/or displacement) at the element level. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of defining a so-called global constraint, which basic aim is to limit the maximum stress (and/or displacement) simultaneously within all the structure by means of one single inequality. Should this global constraint perform adequately, the complexity of the underlying mathematical programming problem would be drastically reduced. However, a certain weakening of the feasibility conditions is expected to occur when a large number of <b>local</b> <b>constraints</b> are lumped into one single inequality. With the aim of mitigating this undesirable collateral effect, we group the elements into blocks. Then, the <b>local</b> <b>constraints</b> corresponding to all the elements within each block can be combined to produce a single aggregated constraint per block. Finally, we compare the performance of these three approaches (local, global and block aggregated constraints) by solving several {{topology optimization}} problems.
