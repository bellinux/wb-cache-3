500|$|Jeremy Egner of The New York Times {{criticized the}} episode in his review, writing, [...] "It's just {{not all that}} satisfying. After endless weeks of stick-beating and the events of <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> <b>it</b> all seemed a little too tidy," [...] and {{additionally}} called Arya's story [...] "anticlimactic." [...] However, Egner also praised the episode's continuation with the King's Landing story, {{as well as the}} follow up with Sandor Clegane and the Brotherhood Without Banners. TV Guides Damian Holbrook criticized as implausible the fact that Arya, after being stabbed multiple times in the previous episode by the Waif, was able to outrun and kill her faster, stronger nemesis in this episode. Hanh Nguyen of Indiewire also felt the Riverrun sequence ended in an anticlimactic fashion as well.|$|E
500|$|Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph {{was more}} {{critical}} with the episode, stating, [...] "having {{set up an}} interesting cliffhanger <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> <b>it</b> was a tad annoying that Steven Moffat did his trick again of taking a swerve with the pre-credits section of this week's episode, and more supposed shock value with the shootings of Amy and Rory," [...] but also more annoyed [...] "that what exactly was going on here, {{and how it was}} influenced by the events of the previous episode, were never exactly explained, leaving the audience to fill in the blanks." [...] Fuller believed that the plot and ending [...] "only raised more questions than answers," [...] believing that the overarching storyline would [...] "require the audience's concentration over many weeks; any casual viewer tuning in this week, and I suspect not a few fans, will have been left baffled by the goings-on," [...] but still felt the episode [...] "was interesting and showed just how, when the writers use their imagination, Doctor Who can tell stories in a way little else on television can." ...|$|E

500|$|Twenty-nine riders {{abandoned}} the three-week race before reaching Rome. Denis Menchov of the [...] {{team won the}} race; after taking the lead in a long individual time trial in stage 12, he did not let his closest challenger and second-place finisher Danilo Di Luca of [...] escape during the mountain stages of the <b>last</b> <b>week.</b> <b>It</b> was announced on 22 July that Di Luca's A-sample {{tested positive for the}} erythropoietin (EPO) derivative, continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (CERA), on 20 May and 28 May.

500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} television critics, with Rudd's {{performance and the}} various subplots being generally well-received, although some disliked the main mystery. Eric Goldman of IGN graded the episode a 7.8 out of 10, indicating that it was [...] "good". He generally praised Rudd's performance and the case-of-the week, but he was critical of its ending, stating that [...] "after <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> <b>it</b> was {{a bit too much}} of another 'and that's one to grow on' conclusion." [...] He was also mixed towards the episode's subplots, enjoying Mac's romantic storyline but disliking Logan's continued interest in Veronica. He also referred to Vinnie running for Sheriff as [...] "a bit ridiculous". Reviewer Alan Sepinwall, on his blog What's Alan Watching?, lauded the episode, particularly Rudd's performance. He stated that Rudd, despite playing a stock character, [...] "made me feel like I hadn't seen it a thousand times before." [...] He also enjoyed the pairing of Mac and Max, while he believed that the impact of Vinnie and Leo's reappearances was blunted by the knowledge that the show would likely not return for a fourth season. Television Without Pity graded the episode a [...] "B".|$|E
500|$|... "Tallahassee" [...] {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} critics, with many {{noting that the}} Florida story-line gave the series a focus. TV Equals noted that the episode was [...] "one of the best episodes of The Office this the season and [...] {{one of the better}} episodes from the last couple of seasons." [...] Brian Marder from Hollywood.com wrote a largely positive review, noting that [...] "Overall, tonight represented a significant step back in the right direction – and hope that maybe the series still has hope... More promisingly, the humor was top-notch, funnily similar to the effortless comedy of early seasons and refreshingly dissimilar to the forced, uncharacteristic stuff that has pervaded season 8." [...] Bret Davinger from the California Literary Review noted that [...] "A couple of weeks ago, I complained about The Office spending too much time away from the office. How was I to know that taking a trip to Tallahassee would produce probably the best episode of the season and maybe one of the best episodes of the past couple of seasons?" [...] Davinger went on to note that the change in scenery from the office set to Tallahassee was working for the series. In addition, he noted that episode did not feature any hints of Erin's desire to stay in Florida or Cathy's attempt to seduce Jim, a move he hoped would be permanent. [...] Jeffrey Hyatt from Screencrave awarded the episode an 8 out of 10 and wrote that [...] "between 'Special Project' and 'Tallahassee' it’s fair to say that The Office is on a nice little run. Everything good and funny about last week's episode spilled over to 'Tallahassee'." [...] TV Fanatic reviewer Dan Forcella awarded the episode four out of five stars. Despite praising the episode for coming [...] "together {{as one of the best}} Office episodes of the season," [...] he criticized Dwight's main plot, calling it [...] "not funny." [...] The Filtered Lens reviewer Matt Dougherty called the episode [...] "solid" [...] and noted [...] "While 'Tallahassee' was not quite as good as <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> <b>it</b> still is a step in the right direction for this struggling show." [...] He ultimately awarded the episode a 7 out of 10. Many reviews praised the episode's cold opening, with many critics calling it one of the funniest openings of the eighth season. What Culture! reviewer Jeffrey Kratzer, despite awarding the episode three out of five stars, wrote, Tallahassee' was so enjoyable (for the most part) that [...] next few episodes look to be the excitement and focused momentum we've been waiting for all season." ...|$|E
