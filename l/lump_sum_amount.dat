Thus, a member will lend' money to other members through his regular monthly contributions.

40|$|Although {{the common}} law system in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong is remarkably {{different}} from the civil law system in the PRC, the two legal systems share a similar ideological basis concerning assessment of damages in tort. When an innocent party is injured in a tort-based system of law {{as the result of}} the negligence of another party, the innocent party should be awarded adequate compensation. The innocent party should receive proper damages to recompense him/her for the wrong suffered, so that he/she may live as fulfilling a life as possible after injury. How this ideological belief is put in practice sparks off both similarities and dissimilarities. In both legal systems, multipliers have played an indispensible role in the determination of damages in personal injury litigation. The objective is to calculate a <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> <b>amount</b> to compensate the victim for future loss of earnings and to cover future expenses. The multiplier is used to discount the future pecuniary values into a presentday <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> <b>amount.</b> For many years, the multiplier figures were difficult to determine on any scientific basis due to insufficient interdisciplinary research in law, economics and actuarial mathematics. Analyzing the relevant data from UK, HK and PRC, and systematically presenting the comparative analysis, the authors of this paper argue that the multipliers adopted in most cases are unduly suppressed, leading to under-compensation of the victims. Proposals for reform are put forward for consideration by judges and legislators in all three jurisdictions.

40|$|In {{personal}} injury litigation, claimants may seek their compensation for future losses or expenses as {{a lump sum}} that {{is determined by the}} product of a multiplicand and a multiplier. The multiplicand represents the annual loss in earnings and other benefits, as assessed at the trial date, while the multiplier discounts future pecuniary values into a single present-day <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> <b>amount.</b> At present, multipliers in the UK are calculated using actuarial methods and based on assumed mortality and interest rates. However, it is entirely possible that these assumptions are incorrect, and if they are, then all claimants who rely on the same set of actuarial multipliers will be affected. In this article, we investigate how the uncertainty surrounding mortality and interest rate assumptions affects the precision of actuarial multipliers.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{volatility}} of growth rates and find that it differs systematically across countries. Our empirical investigation reveals {{that there is a}} high correlation between disparity in political regimes across countries and differences in volatility. This is not the case for some of the commonly cited reasons like initial income, inequality or instability of regimes. We find that less democratic countries are more volatile. To explain this observation we use a dynamic model in which democracy is parameterized by the fraction of people who benefit from being in power. The government in this model maximizes the utility of the group in power using a redistributive tax scheme - setting uniform income taxes but transferring <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> <b>amounts</b> and providing goods and services to the favored group only. When there is a bad shock in this economy, the marginal utility of consumption of agents in power is high. When the transfer is divided among a few, gains from increased transfer outweigh distortionary costs of higher tax. Thus, the optimal tax policy in non-democratic countries, in contrast to that in democratic countries, is such that tax rates are high when there is a bad shock and low when there is a good shock (we refer to this as procyclical tax policy). Further, we show that procyclical tax rates will lead to higher volatility of growth rates than under alternative tax policies. Thus, our model is successful in explaining why tax policies are pro-cyclical in some countries, a commonly observed phenomenon, in addition to providing reasons for differences in volatility of growth rates across countries. The model’s predictions are borne out by data {{in a number of other}} dimensions also. ...|$|R

The PSMC contract is based around the contractor meeting various performance standards {{in return for a}} <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> <b>amount.</b> This paper illustrates the benefits of a PSMC style asset maintenance solution in managing a network such as that proposed in the Challenge. A PSMC maintenance solution offers benefits to the road maintenance authority through the ability of the Contractor to programme work at the optimum time, rather than being constrained to relatively even annual budgets. In this paper, a 15 % saving was predicted over the 20 year analysis period with no loss of level of service, through the ability to fund maintenance works in a more optimal fashion. This paper concludes that PSMC contracts offer an attractive asset maintenance solution. The lump sum contract price also provides greater certainty of long term expenditure levels than a more traditional year by year approach.

The {{objective is to}} calculate a <b>lump</b> <b>sum</b> <b>amount</b> to compensate the plaintiff for a stream of future lost earnings and/or a stream of future expenses. Conventionally, the Hong Kong Courts followed the English authorities in choosing multipliers. Most judges select the multipliers by reference to a spread of multipliers in comparable English and Hong Kong cases. This conventional approach was first challenged in the Hong Kong Court of First Instance in 1995 (Chan Pui Ki (An Infant) v Leung On [1995] 3 HKC 732). The trial judge abandoned the conventional method of choosing multipliers and admitted actuarial evidence to calculate the appropriate multiplier. However, this decision was subsequently reversed by the Hong Kong Court of Appeal in 1996 which held that the conventional multipliers for the calculation of loss of future earnings should be maintained. The Court of Appeal also discouraged any further use of expert evidence given by economists and actuaries in Hong Kong personal injury litigation. On the contrary, the House of Lords in England made a landmark decision (Wells v Wells [1999] AC 345). It approved actuarial evidence as the primary method of assessing future pecuniary loss.
