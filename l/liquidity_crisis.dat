After Obama declined McCain's suspension suggestion, McCain went ahead with the debate on September 26. On October 1, McCain voted in favor of a revised $700 billion rescue plan. Another debate was held on October 7; like the first one, polls afterward suggested that Obama had won it. A final presidential debate occurred on October 15.|$|E
5|$|The {{positive}} {{economic outlook}} for Greece—based {{on the return}} of seasonally adjusted real GDP growth across {{the first three quarters}} of 2014—was replaced by a new fourth recession starting in Q4-2014. This new fourth recession was widely assessed as being direct related to the premature snap parliamentary election called by the Greek parliament in December 2014 and the following formation of a Syriza-led government refusing to accept respecting the terms of its current bailout agreement. The rising political uncertainty of what would follow caused the Troika to suspend all scheduled remaining aid to Greece under its current programme, until such time as the Greek government either accepted the previously negotiated conditional payment terms or alternatively could reach a mutually accepted agreement of some new updated terms with its public creditors. This rift caused a renewed increasingly growing <b>liquidity</b> <b>crisis</b> (both for the Greek government and Greek financial system), resulting in plummeting stock prices at the Athens Stock Exchange while interest rates for the Greek government at the private lending market spiked to levels once again making it inaccessible as an alternative funding source.|$|E
40|$|The paper's {{contribution}} {{is to suggest}} that an attempt to solve <b>liquidity</b> <b>crises</b> by rollovers will promote moral hazard, and conversely, that the more that one can deal with such moral hazard problems the more one ought to solve all <b>liquidity</b> <b>crises</b> by rollovers. The basic argument is set out in Section 1 of these comments. We are here at this meeting to discuss both <b>liquidity</b> <b>crises</b> and solvency crises. This paper is almost entirely about <b>liquidity</b> <b>crises</b> – it goes {{into the details of}} the moral hazard issue in the face of liquidity shortfalls, which can give rise to such crises.

40|$|How do {{volatility}} and <b>liquidity</b> <b>crises</b> affect growth?

Financial development however dampens the growth cost of volatility, {{but only in the}} case of normal volatility. The growth cost of volatility therefore depends critically on the composition of normal and abnormal volatility, the latter being more costly for growth. Copyright The Author 2007.

The ex-post application of official financial rescue packages of sufficient size {{is a perfect}} cure for <b>liquidity</b> <b>crises</b> but amounts to an ineffective and costly bailout of private investors {{in the case of}} solvency crises. The anticipation of the rescue program encourages borrowing offsetting any solvency improvement.

25|$|On Friday 14 September 2007, {{the first}} day {{branches}} opened following the news, many customers queued outside branches to withdraw their savings (a run on the bank). This bank run was not the traditional form, where depositors withdraw money in a snowball effect, leading to a liquidity crisis; instead, it occurred {{in the aftermath of}} the <b>liquidity</b> <b>crisis.</b> It was estimated that £1 billion was withdrawn by customers that day, about 5% of the total bank deposits held by Northern Rock. In one incident, police were called to the branch in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, when two joint account holders barricaded the bank manager in her office after she refused to let them withdraw £1 million from their account. Their money was held in an internet-only account, which they were unable to access after the Northern Rock website failed due to the volume of customers trying to log on. Journalists such as the BBC's Robert Peston, who broke the news on his blog, have been seen as one of the main causes of the bank run.|$|E
25|$|From 1780 on, however, a new conjuncture of {{internal}} and external conditions and forces conspired to bring {{the economy and the}} political structure of the Republic to a crisis that they could not survive. The Fourth Anglo-Dutch War ended the cloak of neutrality which had protected Dutch shipping for most of the century, in that period obviating the need for naval protection that was now lacking due to many years of neglect of the navy. Trade came temporarily to a standstill, because the British blockade could not be broken, despite the relative success of the Dutch navy in the Battle of Dogger Bank (1781). The trade of the VOC was devastated, even apart from the loss of some of its colonies. It experienced a <b>liquidity</b> <b>crisis</b> which exposed its inherent insolvency. The company was too important to let it fail (also because of the importance of its outstanding debt in the Dutch financial system), so that it was kept afloat {{for more than a decade}} by emergency aid from the States of Holland, before it was finally nationalized in 1796.|$|E

After the financial crises of the 1990 s many voices rose to explain that the causes of these crises were new (Radelet and Sachs 1998; Corsetti, Pesenti, and Roubini 1999). Indeed, the usual features known to trigger crises (unsustain-able government economic policies; Krugman 1979) were absent or could not by themselves imply such severe crises (Baig and Goldfajn 2002).

2500|$|The {{most direct}} threat to the {{survival}} of the States Army in the months after the lightning advance of the French into the Dutch heartland was a financial one: the three occupied provinces Gelderland, Overijssel, and Utrecht no longer paid the troops that were on their [...] "repartition," [...] which would soon have resulted in the loss of these regiments. Holland therefore agreed to temporarily take over the financing of these troops, on top of the 58% of the costs of the war that it normally already paid. But on the level of the company a different <b>liquidity</b> <b>crisis</b> threatened to ruin the captains. First of all, many [...] "sollicitors-military," [...] afraid they would not be repaid, refused to extend further credit. At the same time the confusion caused by the hasty retreat of the field army behind the Dutch Water Line, combined with the haphazard return of the garrisons of the Dutch fortresses that had so ignominiously capitulated to the French, caused large apparent diminutions of the effective strength of the companies that the captains had to replenish for their own account under the system described above. This threatened to bankrupt many captains, just when they were needed the most. At the behest of William III the government now stepped in to avert this danger which might have resulted in a breakdown of the army. The States of Holland agreed to compensate the captains for the loss of soldiers at a fixed rate, which enabled the captains to bring their companies up to strength again without courting financial ruin. A soldier killed in action would bring 33 guilders (later increased to 50 guilders); a trooper with his horse 150 guilders. This system was continued {{until the end of the}} Dutch Republic in 1795. Henceforth the government bore the [...] "business risk" [...] of war. In exchange the captains lost their entrepreneurial status and were transformed to professional officers in the modern sense, with all that entailed for tightened discipline. The advantage for the army was that its losses (for instance after battles) were much more rapidly replenished, enabling it to maintain a heightened state of readiness.|$|E
