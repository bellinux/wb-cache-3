50|$|NASA has {{proposed}} use of highly capable telerobotic systems for future planetary exploration using human exploration from orbit. In a concept for Mars Exploration proposed by Landis, a precursor mission to Mars {{could be done}} in which the human vehicle brings a crew to Mars, but remains in orbit rather than landing on the surface, while a highly capable remote robot is operated in real time on the surface. Such a system would go beyond the simple <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> robotics and move to a regime of virtual telepresence on the planet. One study of this concept, the Human Exploration using Real-time Robotic Operations (HERRO) concept, suggested that such a mission could be used to explore a wide variety of planetary destinations.|$|E
50|$|Sturgeons {{have adopted}} a {{temporal}} strategy to controlling risks. Sturgeons live a <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> <b>delay</b> maturation to large sizes, and spawn multiple times over their lifespan. The sturgeon’s long life span and repeat spawning in multiple years allows them to outlast periodic droughts and environmental catastrophes. The high fecundity that comes with large size allows them to produce large numbers of offspring when suitable spawning conditions occur and {{to make up for}} years of poor conditions. Adult green sturgeon do not spawn every year and {{only a fraction of the}} population enters freshwater where they might be at risk of a catastrophic event in any year. The widespread ocean distribution of green sturgeon ensures that most of the population at any given time is dispersed among areas where they are not vulnerable to catastrophic losses.|$|E
50|$|The GC-EI-MS is {{also used}} in {{forensic}} science. One example is the analysis of five local anesthetics in blood using headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-electron impact ionization selected ion monitoring (GC-MS-EI-SIM). Local anesthesia is widely used but sometimes these drugs can cause medical accidents. In such cases an accurate, simple, and rapid method {{for the analysis of}} local anesthetics is required. GC-EI-MS was used in one case with an analysis time of 65 minutes and a sample size of approximately 0.2 g, a relatively small amount. Another application in forensic practice is the determination of date-rape drugs (DRDs) in urine. These drugs are used to incapacitate victims and then rape or rob them. The analyses of these drugs are difficult due to the low concentrations in the body fluids and often a <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> between the event and clinical examination. However, using GC-EI-MS allows a simple, sensitive and robust method for the identification, detection and quantification of 128 compounds of DRDs in urine.|$|E

Near the operation frequency, the energy transport velocity has a rather peculiar distribution. The transport velocity along the direction {{pointing at the}} center of the cloak is found to be a constant, while the transport velocity approaches zero at the inner boundary of the cloak. A ray pointing right into the center of the cloak will experience abrupt changes in velocities when it impinges on the inner surface of the cloak.

This seems {{a consequence of the}} <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> between completing the batch processes, and the availability of the laboratory tests. Thus, the feedback loop to operators is not fast and perhaps also not fully effective. This leads to a recommendation to provide more immediate feedback to operators via run/control charts.|$|E

Low equivalent short period frequencies and relatively <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>delays</b> are tolerated only when the pilot is located at considerable distance forward {{of the center of}} rotation. The control problem experienced by the pilots, when seated behind the center of rotation, tended to occur at low altitude when they were using visual cues of rate of sink and altitude.

40|$|Based on {{a general}} {{controller}} evaluation method, taking both performance and robustness in different frequency regions into account, an analytical PID design method is presented. It {{is related to}} the well known and often used lambda tuning approach, which is based on internal model control (IMC) for a specific second-order non-minimum phase plant model. The analytical method introduced in this paper includes two tuning parameters, one that guarantees a specified stability margin for the given model, and one that is also able to adjust the control activity to a desired level. The suggested method, called robust IMC, gives the user the important freedom to control both mid- and high-frequency robustness. An extended evaluation procedure also illustrates how efficiently PI and PID controllers including a Smith predictor (SP) can control <b>time</b> <b>delayed</b> plants. More specifically, it is shown to be more profitable to provide a PI controller with derivative action than with a SP for plants with <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>delays...</b>|$|R
