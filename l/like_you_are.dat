500|$|Niffenegger {{began writing}} the novel in 1997; the last scene, {{in which an}} aged Clare is waiting for Henry, was written first, {{because it is the}} story's focal point. The {{narrative}} was originally structured thematically. Responding to comments from readers of early drafts of the manuscript, Niffenegger reorganized the narrative so that it largely followed Clare's timeline. The work was finished in 2001. With no history of commercial publication, Niffenegger had trouble finding interested literary agents—25 rejected the manuscript. In 2002, she sent it unsolicited to the small, San Francisco-based publisher MacAdam/Cage, where it reached Anika Streitfeld. Streitfeld, who became Niffenegger's editor, [...] "thought it was incredible. Right from the very beginning you feel <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> in capable hands, that this is someone who has a story to tell and who knows how to tell it." [...] She gave it to David Poindexter, the founder of the publishing firm, [...] "who read it overnight and decided to buy the book". However, Niffenegger had acquired an agent by this time, and several publishing houses in New York City were interested in the novel. The manuscript was put up for auction and MacAdam/Cage bid US$100,000, by far the largest sum it had ever offered for a book. Although another publisher outbid them, Niffenegger selected MacAdam/Cage because they were so dedicated to her work. Also, Niffenegger explains that her [...] "own natural inclination is to go small. My background is in punk music—I'd always pick the indie company over the giant corporation." ...|$|E
2500|$|GameSpot's Chris Watters scored it 6.5 out of 10, writing [...] "Deadlight draws you in {{with its}} rich, {{pervasive}} atmosphere, but doesn't give you {{much to do}} once you're there", calling the game [...] "an alluringly dark, but disappointingly shallow experience." [...] He praised the graphics, arguing [...] "the artistic elements work in harmony to make Deadlight a visually compelling game." [...] However, he was critical of the gameplay, writing [...] "linearity isn't inherently negative, but performing the same few moves to progress down a clearly marked path doesn't hold its appeal for long." [...] He concluded [...] "In the three or so hours {{that it takes to}} complete the game, you feel less <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> trekking through a dangerous world, and more <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> acting out a script. Deadlights engrossing visuals make it fun to play the part, but you'll wish you had more lines." ...|$|E
2500|$|Count Basie {{introduced}} {{several generations}} of listeners to the Big Band sound and left an influential catalog. Basie is remembered by many who worked for him as being considerate of musicians and their opinions, modest, relaxed, fun-loving, dryly witty, and always enthusiastic about his music. In his autobiography, he wrote, [...] "I think the band can really swing when it swings easy, when it can just play along <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> cutting butter." ...|$|E

2500|$|This [...] "opaque" [...] {{technique}} has been Godard's trademark style for many years. In 1995 Jean-Michel Frodon described the same complexities as Bordwell and wrote that when viewing a Godard film {{there are moments}} when one has the tendency to resist the experience. As the film unfolds you are suddenly confused, you don't quite grasp something and you feel <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> losing your footing. On the point of drowning one is liable to think Godard is vague and obscure but then there is a maritime movement/shift and if one lets oneself be carried by the next wave that comes one soon recovers the drift of the film.|$|E
2500|$|Mr. Hogan advocates {{the use of}} a waggle {{not only}} because it helps you loosen your muscles, but also because it allows for your hands and arms to {{remember}} where to go for the first part of your backswing. The angle of the swing should feel <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> swinging under a slanting plane of glass. [...] The [...] "glass" [...] has a hole for your head while it rests on your shoulders and touches the ground on top of your ball. Also, the backswing should be slightly steeper than the downswing. [...] At the top of your backswing, your back should be facing the target.|$|E
2500|$|Jari Mäenpää began Wintersun in 2003 [...] "to make {{songs that}} make you feel <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{floating}} in space." [...] Mäenpää chose the name [...] "Wintersun" [...] from a list a friend had produced, later explaining, [...] "Winter reflects the cold and stormy side of the album and also the Finnish melancholy and magic. Sun is related to the 'universe, space and stars'-feel of the album, which is also strongly connected to the lyrics." [...] Although the songs that would appear on Wintersun had collectively been written between 1995 and 2004 (see each track's respective composition dates here), Mäenpää kept his songwriting efforts primarily focused on folk metal band Ensiferum, with whom he'd been playing since 1996.|$|E

2500|$|Jamie Todd Rubin, {{reviewing}} {{the issue of}} Astounding in which the story originally appeared, writes [...] "f all the stories in the issue, de Camp’s is the best written. There is no feeling of pulp writing or story-telling. It is a smooth tale that comes alive in your imagination so that you feel <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> right there with the characters on their journey. Abou the only weakness in the story was the ending, which returns to the father and his adopted son. I didn’t think the ending {{lived up to the}} full potential of the story, and almost would have liked to seen the beginning and ending left off, and just go on the wonderful journey through the African wilderness." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 12, 2006, Turner had a {{physical}} altercation with Jaime Vazquez, a former Jersey City Deputy Mayor {{and a member}} of the Jersey City Council, who was the Jersey City Commissioner of Veterans Affairs at the time. The North Bergen Reporter quoted Turner as saying [...] "(t)he illegal immigrants are breaking the law, and people like me should break the law as well by shooting them down." [...] In response, Vazquez picketed with a sign reading [...] "Hal Turner — shoot me! Racists and bigots <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> cowards." [...] This was followed by {{a physical}} confrontation, during which Vazquez suffered a back injury and a fractured wrist. Turner and Vazquez later filed criminal charges against each other. On July 16, 2006 North Bergen Municipal Court Judge Joseph Romano found both men to be equally credible and thus neither criminally liable.|$|E
2500|$|Ghostbusters: The Video Game was {{met with}} a {{generally}} positive reception. Greg Miller of IGN gave both the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions an 8.0 out of 10. Miller describes the game as a [...] "love letter to Ghostbusters fans", saying that it [...] "makes you feel <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> really a Ghostbuster". He lauds the CGI cutscenes as a positive feature, but finds fault with stiff character animation and bad lip sync in the other cutscenes. Miller gave the Wii version a 7.8 out of 10. Unlike Miller, fellow reviewer Matt Casamassina believed that the aiming system in Ghostbusters {{was better than the}} aiming system in Resident Evil 4. PSM3 gave the game a score of 85 out of 100, stating that the game was [...] "too short, but packed with quality and imagination." [...] The A.V. Club gave the game a B-, concluding that [...] "It’s the best Ghostbusters game of all time, though that really isn’t saying much." [...] Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot rated the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions of the game a 7.5 out of 10, listing the ghost-trapping gameplay and multiplayer mode as positives and frustrating spots in the game and repetitive gameplay as negatives. He also reviewed the Wii version and gave it an 8 out of 10 stating that [...] "Ghostbusters is such riotous fun that you'll forgive its short length." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{his text}} Buddho Ajahn Thate {{describes}} {{what it is}} like when the mind has finally rid itself of preoccupation with sensual distractions and is able to focus on the breath, mantra, or a part of the body, in meditation: [...] "When you first enter concentration, this is what it's like: [...] You'll have no idea at all of what concentration or one-pointedness of mind is going to feel <b>like.</b> <b>You</b> <b>are</b> simply intent on keeping mindfulness firmly focused on one object – and the power of a mind focused firmly on one object is what will bring you to a state of concentration. You won't be thinking at all that concentration will be like this or like that, or that {{you want it to be}} like this or like that. It will simply take its own way, automatically. No one can force it. At that moment you will feel as if you are in another world (the world of the mind), with a sense of ease and solitude to which nothing else in the world can compare. When the mind withdraws from concentration, you will regret that that mood has passed, and you will remember it clearly. All that we say about concentration comes from the mind which has withdrawn from that state. As long as it is still gathered in that state, we aren't interested in what anyone else says or does. You have to train the mind to enter this sort of concentration often, so as to become skilled and adept, but don't try to remember your past states of concentration, and don't let yourself want your concentration to be like it was before – because it won't be that way, and you will just be making more trouble for yourself." ...|$|E
