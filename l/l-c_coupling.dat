40|$|M. Ing. (Electrical and Electronic Engineering) This {{research}} project {{sets out to}} investigate passive <b>L-C</b> <b>coupling</b> circuits {{as an alternative to}} transformer-capacitor couplers, with the prime intention to reduce the cost of coupling in power-line communications, hence the title “Compact, Economical Coupling Circuits for Low-Voltage Power-line Communications”. This chapter first presents a short introduction to Power-Line Communications, and then briefly reviews relevant topics surrounding this project. Also discussed, in general, are the standards and regulations for power-line communications i. e. the CENELEC EN 50065. 1 Standard and the IEEE 1901. 2 Standard. This information intends to give the reader guidelines and relevant protocols and/or rules when designing and building communication devices for PLC. This information will also help us in our designs and experimental set-ups as we proceed with this project. The reader will also be introduced to the concept of filtering and impedance matching in communication systems. Emphasis will be laid on the required output signal frequency profile of a coupling band-pass filter. The chapter will define filtering in terms of communications and also discuss the more significant and important parameters in filter circuits. The last section of this chapter will touch on impedance matching and the concept of maximum power transfer, so as to attain maximum signal transfer to the receiver-end...|$|E
40|$|A {{flexible}} metamaterial RF detector for {{magnetic resonance}} imaging is described. The circuit consists of a polygonal arrangement of magnetically <b>coupled</b> <b>L-C</b> resonators with rectangular inductors, which supports magneto-inductive waves. The elements are mechanically linked to allow adjacent elements to rotate as the ring is flexed. The pivot is optimised to hold the nearest neighbour coupling coefficient κ 1 invariant to small changes in angle so resonances are unaffected. Theory is developed to find the optimum pivot and verified using PCB elements. The method is also applicable to flexible waveguides. 1...|$|R
40|$|Magneto-inductive (MI) waveguides are linear {{arrangements}} of magnetically <b>coupled</b> <b>L–C</b> resonators that propagate electrical energy at radio frequency without direct connection. To achieve the strong magnetic coupling needed for low-loss propagation, adjacent elements {{must be in}} such close proximity that electric coupling arises. In contrast to electric coupling in split ring resonators, the coupling occurs between the inductive tracks of adjacent resonant loops. Parasitic capacitance is demonstrated in flexible magneto-inductive cable, and shown to introduce additional propagation bands above the MI band. Simple models are developed to predict this effect, and strategies discussed to improve high-frequency isolation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a spurious suppressed microstrip dual mode bandpass filter (BPF). High selectivity and good adjacent channel interference rejection are required of modern transmitting and receiving devices. Conventionally, square resonator with orthogonal {{input and output}} feedlines is employed to achieve a quasi-elliptic type of bandpass response with two transmission zeros near its passband edges. However, this resulted in spurious response of unwanted harmonics at higher frequencies. The proposed spurious suppressed dual mode BPF utilized novel M-shaped defected ground structures (DGS) etched in the ground plane beneath a square resonator input and output feedlines to attain spurious suppressed bandpass responses. The presence of DGS leads to the increment in the current path and effective permittivity, and also decrement of the effective phase velocity and effective wavelength. In addition, DGS of different sizes, patterns and positioning, equivalent <b>L-C</b> ratio, <b>coupling</b> coefficients and other electrical parameters will result in various spurious suppression responses. It can be represented by a parallel tuned circuit arranged in series with the main circuit transmission line {{to which it is}} coupled. The prototyped BPF is fabricated on a Ro 4003 C substrate with relative permittivity of 3. 38 and loss tangent of 0. 0021. The center frequency is 2. 55 GHz. The best measured S₁₁ is obtained at 2. 58 GHz with a value of - 23. 76 dB and the corresponding S₂₁ is - 3. 7 dB which is slightly lower as compared to the simulated response. This is mainly due to fabrication tolerance and misalignment loss. One transmission zero is obtained at 2. 25 GHz and 2. 85 GHz respectively. The lower and upper stopband attenuation is greater than 20 dB/GHz. The bandwidth of the passband response at - 3 dB level is 3. 2 %. Validation of the BPF design is obtained via good agreement between the simulated and measured results...|$|R
