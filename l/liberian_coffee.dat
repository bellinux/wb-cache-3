25|$|Liberia has a long, {{rich history}} in textile arts and quilting, as the {{settlers}} {{brought with them}} their sewing and quilting skills. Liberia hosted National Fairs in 1857 and 1858 in which prizes were awarded for various needle arts. One of the most well-known Liberian quilters was Martha Ann Ricks, who presented a quilt featuring the famed <b>Liberian</b> <b>coffee</b> tree to Queen Victoria in 1892. When President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf moved into the Executive Mansion, she reportedly had a Liberian-made quilt installed in her presidential office.|$|E
60|$|The {{citizens}} gave me sundry {{details about}} the 'rubber'-trade, which began in 1877. Monrovia now exports to England and the Continent some 100,000 lbs., which sell at 1s. 4d. each. Gum-elastic is gathered chiefly by the Bassá people, who are, however, too lazy to keep it clean; they store it in grass-bags and transport it in canoes. <b>Liberian</b> <b>coffee</b> is, or rather would be, famous if produced in sufficient quantities to satisfy demand. At present it goes chiefly to the United States, where, like Mocha, it serves to flavour burnt maize. Messieurs Spiers and Pond would buy any quantity of it, and of late years Brazilian coffee-planters have taken shoots to be grown at home. Here it fetches 1s. per lb.; in England the price doubles. This coffee requires keeping for many months, or the infusion is potent enough to cause the 'shakes;' {{it is the same}} with Brazilian green tea. The bouquet is excellent, and the flavour pretty good. There is a great difference {{in the shape of the}} beans, which range between the broad flat Harar and the small, round, horny Mocha.|$|E
50|$|Coffea liberica (or <b>Liberian</b> <b>coffee)</b> is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is a coffee that is native to western and central Africa from Liberia to Uganda and Angola. It is also naturalized in the Seychelles, the Andaman & Nicobar Islands, French Polynesia, Central America, the West Indies, Venezuela, Colombia and Brazil.|$|E
40|$|AbstractCoffea (coffee) {{species are}} grown {{in almost all}} {{countries}} along the Equator. Many members of the genus have a large production history and an important role both in the global market and researches. Seeds (Coffeae semen) are successfully used in food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries due to its caffeine and high polyphenol content. Nowadays, the three best-known coffee species are Arabic (Coffea arabica L.), Robusta (Coffea robusta L. Linden), and <b>Liberian</b> <b>coffees</b> (Coffea liberica Hiern.). Even though, many records are available on coffee in scientific literature, wild coffee species like Bengal coffee (Coffea benghalensis Roxb. Ex Schult.) could offer many new opportunities and challenges for phytochemical and medical studies. In this comprehensive summary, we focused on the ethnomedicinal, phytochemical, and medical significance of coffee species up to the present...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{investigate}} the antioxidant activity, total phenolic and total tannin {{content of the}} pericarp and the seed of Coffea benghalensis (C.  benghalensis) and Coffea liberica compared to Coffea arabica (C.  arabica). MethodsThe antioxidant potential, total tannin and polyphenol contents of the immature and mature seed and pericarp of C.  benghalensis and Coffea liberica were quantified and compared to C.  arabica. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL), 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), oxygen radical absorbance capacity, Folin-Ciocalteau method and total tannin content assays were used. ResultsTrolox equivalent (TE/g plant material) values obtained by ECL and DPPH methods showed loose correlation (r 2  =  0. 587) while those measured by oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay were higher without correlation in each plant. A closer correlation was detected between the ECL method and the percentage antioxidant activity of the DPPH technique (r 2  =  0. 610 7) in each species, however the immature pericarp of C.  benghalensis showed much higher DPPH scavenging potential than {{was seen in the}} ECL assay. The immature pericarp of C.  benghalensis expressed the highest tannin and polyphenol content, and a high polyphenol level was also detected in the immature seed of C.  arabica. The immature pericarp of Bengal and <b>Liberian</b> <b>coffees</b> showed the largest amount of phenolic contents. ConclusionsThe obtained data highlight the potential role of C.  benghalensis as a new source of natural antioxidants and polyphenols compared to C.  arabica...|$|R
50|$|Sternotomis pulchra {{can reach}} a body length of 20 - 25 mm. Head, thorax and elyra are orange-coloured. The thorax bears {{transversal}} black rings and a spine on each side. Elytra shows some black markings and light green patches. Femora and tibiae are green. Antennae {{are black and}} longer than the beetle. These cerambycids feed on <b>Liberian</b> <b>Coffee</b> (Coffea liberica).|$|E

50|$|The {{director}} of the company was the Geheimer Kommerzienrat (councillor) Adolph von Hansemann. He also headed the New Guinea Company, from which the company first took over some tobacco plantations in Stephansort and Erima. The following year, an additional tobacco plantation was founded in Jomba, and another in 1893 in Maraga. In that year, 108,600 pounds of tobacco was exported to Europe. In addition to the tobacco growing and export, Astrolabe also shipped exotic woods and experimented with the cultivation of coconut palms, <b>Liberian</b> <b>coffee</b> and natural rubber. In 1896, the company ran tobacco and coffee plantations in Stephansort and tobacco plantations in Erima, Jomba, and Maraga.|$|E
