5|$|During {{the late}} 1930s Frunze {{was used as}} a barracks hulk while she was {{stripped}} for parts, until she was formally discarded 1 December 1940, after scrapping had already begun at a leisurely pace. After the German invasion she was towed to Kronstadt and run aground in late July 1941 near the <b>Leningrad</b> Sea Canal. During the Siege of <b>Leningrad</b> her hull {{was used as a}} base for small ships. Frunze raised on 31 May 1944, towed to <b>Leningrad</b> and scrapped beginning in 1949.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Leningrad</b> première of Shostakovich's Symphony No. 7 {{took place}} on 9 August 1942 during the Second World War, while the city of <b>Leningrad</b> (now St. Petersburg) was under siege by Nazi German forces.|$|E
5|$|After {{the capture}} of Sevastopol, Hitler felt Manstein was the right man to command the forces at <b>Leningrad,</b> which had been under siege since September 1941. With {{elements}} of the 11th Army, Manstein {{was transferred to the}} <b>Leningrad</b> front, arriving on 27 August 1942. Manstein again lacked the proper forces to storm the city, so he planned Operation Nordlicht, a bold plan for a thrust to cut off Leningrad's supply line at Lake Ladoga.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the Narva Offensive (July 1944), the <b>Leningrad</b> Front {{deployed}} 136,830 troops, 150 tanks, 2,500 assault guns and 800+ aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Dmitri Shostakovich had {{intended}} the piece to be premièred by the <b>Leningrad</b> Philharmonic Orchestra, {{but because of}} the siege, that group was evacuated from the city, as was the composer himself. The world première of the symphony was held on 5 March in Kuybyshev with the Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra. The <b>Leningrad</b> première was performed by the surviving musicians of the <b>Leningrad</b> Radio Orchestra, supplemented with military performers. Most of the musicians were suffering from starvation, which made rehearsing difficult: musicians frequently collapsed during rehearsals, and three died. The orchestra was able to play the symphony all the way through only once before the concert.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} {{setbacks}} of the Russian army at {{the hand of}} Nazi Germany, Novikov and the <b>Leningrad</b> air forces {{took part in a}} number of strikes against the advancing German armies, including the first Soviet air operation of the war, from June 25 – 30, 1941, which cost the Germans 130 aircraft. During this time, Novikov was noted for his skill in command and for his innovation, particularly the then unknown use of radio to coordinate bomber flights. In July 1941, Novikov expanded his command from <b>Leningrad</b> to include air forces of the Northern Front, Northwestern Front and the Baltic Fleet, and as the Germans approached <b>Leningrad,</b> Novikov and his forces flew 16,567 sorties.|$|E
5|$|Gorky {{had a new}} bow section {{fabricated}} in Kronstadt and it was mated {{with the}} ship on 21 July. Kirov provided gunfire support during the defense of Tallinn and served as the flagship of the evacuation fleet from Tallinn to <b>Leningrad</b> {{at the end of}} August 1941. For {{most of the rest of}} the war both cruisers were blockaded in <b>Leningrad</b> and Kronstadt by Axis minefields and could only provide gunfire support for the defenders during the Siege of <b>Leningrad</b> and support for the Soviet Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive in mid—1944. Both ships were damaged by German air and artillery attacks, but were repaired during the war.|$|E

5|$|Renamed Petropavlovsk in September 1940, work on {{the ship}} was delayed by poor German-Soviet {{co-operation}} in crew training and provision of technical literature to enable completion of the ship, which was being {{carried out in the}} <b>Leningrad</b> shipyards. Still unfinished when Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, the ship briefly took part in the defense of <b>Leningrad</b> by providing artillery support to the Soviet defenders. She was heavily damaged by German artillery in September 1941, sunk in April 1942, and raised in September 1942. After repairs were effected, the ship was renamed Tallinn and used in the Soviet counter-offensive that relieved <b>Leningrad</b> in 1944. After the end of the war, the ship was used as a stationary training platform and as a floating barracks before being broken up for scrap sometime between 1953 and 1960.|$|E

5|$|The Finns assured Yartsev that Finland was {{committed}} to a policy of neutrality, and the country would resist any armed incursion. Yartsev was {{not satisfied with the}} reply, given Finland's military weakness. He suggested that Finland could cede, or lease, some islands in the Gulf of Finland along the seaward approaches to <b>Leningrad,</b> a suggestion the Finns rejected. Earlier in the mid-1930s, the Soviet ambassador in Helsinki, Eric Assmus, and the <b>Leningrad</b> Bolshevik party leader Andrei Zhdanov, had presented a similar proposal.|$|E
5|$|After {{finishing}} his studies, Kosygin was {{employed as a}} textile mill director. Three years later, he was elected Chairman of the Executive Committee of the <b>Leningrad</b> City Soviets of Working People's Deputies by the <b>Leningrad</b> Communist Party, and the following year he was appointed People's Commissar for Textile and Industry and earned {{a seat on the}} Central Committee (CC). In 1940 Kosygin became a Deputy chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, and was appointed in 1943 as Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Russian SFSR.|$|E

5|$|Following his {{retirement}} in 1958, Novikov accepted an offer to become head of the Higher Civil Aviation School in <b>Leningrad,</b> where he worked for ten years. He became a professor, and was awarded the Order of the Red Banner in 1961.|$|E
5|$|Germany had {{pressured}} Finland {{to enlarge}} its offensive activities in Karelia {{to aid the}} Germans in their <b>Leningrad</b> operation. Finnish attacks on <b>Leningrad</b> itself remained limited. Finland stopped its advance just short of <b>Leningrad</b> and had no intentions to attack the city. The situation was different in eastern Karelia. The Finnish government agreed to restart its offensive into Soviet Karelia to reach Lake Onega and the Svir River. On 4 September this new drive was launched on a broad front. Albeit reinforced by fresh reserve troops, heavy losses elsewhere on the front meant that the Soviet defenders of the 7th Army {{were not able to}} resist the Finnish advance. Olonets was taken on 5 September. On 7 September, Finnish forward units reached the Svir River. Petrozavodsk, the capital city of the region fell on 1 October. From there the Army of Karelia moved north along the shores of Lake Onega to secure the remaining area west of Lake Onega, while simultaneously establishing a defensive position along the Svir River. Slowed by winter's onset they nevertheless continued to advance slowly during the following weeks. Medvezhyegorsk was captured on 5 December and Poventsa fell the next day. On 7 December Finland called a stop to all offensive operations, going onto the defensive.|$|E
5|$|His {{greatest}} {{and most}} famous wartime contribution was the Seventh Symphony. The composer {{wrote the first}} three movements in <b>Leningrad</b> and completed the work in Kuibyshev (now Samara) {{where he and his}} family had been evacuated. It remains unclear whether Shostakovich really conceived the idea of the symphony with the siege of <b>Leningrad</b> in mind, it was officially claimed as a representation of the people of Leningrad’s brave resistance to the German invaders and an authentic piece of patriotic art at a time when morale needed boosting. The symphony was first premiered by the Bolshoi Theatre orchestra in Kuibyshev and was soon performed abroad in London and the United States. The most compelling performance was the <b>Leningrad</b> premiere by the Radio Orchestra in the besieged city. The orchestra had only fourteen musicians left, so the conductor Karl Eliasberg had to recruit anyone who could play a musical instrument to perform the symphony.|$|E
5|$|In his lighter moods, {{sport was}} one of his main recreations, {{although}} he preferred spectating or umpiring to participating (he was a qualified football referee). His favourite football club was Zenit <b>Leningrad,</b> which he would watch regularly. He also enjoyed playing card games, particularly patience.|$|E
5|$|Novikov was {{expelled}} from {{the party and the}} armed forces in 1937; however he was re-admitted by the Commissioner of the Belarussian Military District, A. I. Mezis, who was in turn arrested. Novikov served as chief of the air force staff of the <b>Leningrad</b> Military District prior to serving in the Soviet-Finnish War during 1939 and 1940. For his service in the conflict he was promoted to Major General and earned the Order of Lenin. He continued to command the Air Forces of the <b>Leningrad</b> Military District until the outbreak of World War II.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{were well}} aware that {{breaking}} the blockade was {{very important for the}} Soviet side. However, due to the reverse at Stalingrad and the Soviet offensive at Velikiye Luki to the south of <b>Leningrad,</b> Army Group North was ordered to go on the defensive and was stripped of many troops. The 11th Army, which was to lead the assault on <b>Leningrad</b> in September 1942, and which had thwarted the last Soviet offensive, was transferred to Army Group Center in October. Nine other divisions were also reassigned to other sectors.|$|E
5|$|A {{new edition}} was planned {{beginning}} in 1914 by Walther von Dyck (1856–1934). Dyck compiled copies of Kepler's unedited manuscripts, using international diplomatic contacts {{to convince the}} Soviet authorities to lend him the manuscripts kept in <b>Leningrad</b> for photographic reproduction. These manuscripts contained several works by Kepler {{that had not been}} available to Frisch. Dyck's photographs remain the basis for the modern editions of Kepler's unpublished manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|As the war progressed and Germany's lighter {{tanks were}} {{replaced}} by the Panzer III, Panzer IV and heavier tanks, such as the Panther, the T-26 was gradually replaced through attrition by the vastly superior T-34. The remaining T-26s participated in battles with the Germans and their allies during the Battle of Moscow from 1941–42, the Battle of Stalingrad and the Battle of the Caucasus from 1942–1943. Some tank units of the <b>Leningrad</b> Front used their T-26 tanks until 1944.|$|E
5|$|Attacks by the <b>Leningrad</b> Front {{had pushed}} Army Group North west of Lake Peipus, {{resulting}} {{in a series of}} operations around Narva. In the south, Soviet forces had advanced towards the Baltic coast at the end of Operation Bagration the Belorussian strategic offensive (June–August 1944) against Army Group Centre. The Soviet Tallinn Offensive was designed {{as a part of the}} Baltic Offensive to eliminate the positions of Army Group North along the Baltic.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1930s {{there were a}} variety of spaniels in Moscow, <b>Leningrad</b> and Sverdlovsk that did not fit any {{specific}} spaniel breed standard, but were not yet standardised into the modern Russian Spaniel. Purposeful breeding after World War II led to the original Russian Spaniel standard in 1951. Further revised standards were issued in 1966 and 2000.|$|E
5|$|Chatwin {{enrolled}} in October 1966 at the University of Edinburgh to study Archaeology. He had regretted not attending Oxford {{and had been}} contemplating going to university for a few years. A visit in December 1965 to the Hermitage in <b>Leningrad</b> sparked {{his interest in the}} field of archaeology. Despite winning the Wardrop Prize for the best first year's work, he found the rigour of academic archaeology tiresome, and he left after two years without taking a degree.|$|E
5|$|From November 1943, {{during the}} seven-week Battle of Changde, the Chinese forced Japan {{to fight a}} costly war of attrition, while {{awaiting}} Allied relief. In January 1944, the Allies launched a series of attacks in Italy against the line at Monte Cassino and tried to outflank it with landings at Anzio. By the end of January, a major Soviet offensive expelled German forces from the <b>Leningrad</b> region, ending the longest and most lethal siege in history.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, before Soviet forces {{attempted}} to invade Finland, the Party Secretary of <b>Leningrad</b> Andrei Zhdanov commissioned a celebratory piece from Shostakovich, entitled Suite on Finnish Themes {{to be performed}} as the marching bands of the Red Army would be parading through the Finnish capital Helsinki. The Winter War was a bitter experience for the Red Army, the parade never happened, and Shostakovich would never lay claim to the authorship of this work. It was not performed until 2001.|$|E
5|$|In 1965 Shostakovich {{raised his}} voice in defense of poet Joseph Brodsky, who was sentenced to five years of exile and hard labor. Shostakovich co-signed protests {{together}} with Yevtushenko and fellow Soviet artists Kornei Chukovsky, Anna Akhmatova, Samuil Marshak, and the French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre. After the protests the sentence was commuted, and Brodsky returned to <b>Leningrad.</b>|$|E
5|$|In November 1965, {{soon after}} her Oxford visit, Akhmatova {{suffered}} a heart attack and was hospitalised. She was moved to a sanatorium in Moscow in the spring of 1966 and died of heart failure on March 5, at the age of 76. Thousands attended the two memorial ceremonies which were held in Moscow and in <b>Leningrad.</b> After being displayed in an open coffin, she was interred at Komarovo Cemetery in St Petersburg.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, Estonian {{oil shale}} was {{described}} by several scientists and used as a low-grade fuel. Its use in industry commenced in 1916. Production of shale oil began in 1921 and oil shale was first used to generate electrical power in 1924. Shortly thereafter, systematic research into oil shale and its products began, and in 1938 a department of mining was established at Tallinn Technical University. After World War II, Estonian oil shale gas was used in Saint Petersburg (then called <b>Leningrad)</b> and in northern cities in Estonia {{as a substitute for}} natural gas. Increased need for electricity in the north-west of the Soviet Union led to the construction of large oil shale-fired power stations. Oil shale extraction peaked in 1980. Subsequently, the launch of nuclear reactors in Russia, particularly the <b>Leningrad</b> Nuclear Power Station, reduced demand for electricity produced from oil shale, and, along with a post-Soviet restructuring of the industry in the 1990s, led to a decrease in oil shale mining. After decreasing for two decades, oil shale mining started to increase again {{at the beginning of the}} 21st century.|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} {{at this time that}} Shostakovich {{composed}} the first of his string quartets. His chamber works allowed him to experiment and express ideas which would have been unacceptable in his more public symphonic pieces. In September 1937 he began to teach composition at the <b>Leningrad</b> Conservatory, which provided some financial security but interfered with his own creative work.|$|E
5|$|Khrushchev founded several {{academic}} towns, such as Akademgorodok. The premier {{believed that}} Western science flourished because many scientists lived in university {{towns such as}} Oxford, isolated from big city distractions, and had pleasant living conditions and good pay. He sought to duplicate those conditions in the Soviet Union. Khrushchev's attempt was generally successful, though his new towns and scientific centers tended to attract younger scientists, with older ones unwilling to leave Moscow or <b>Leningrad.</b>|$|E
