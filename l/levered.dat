5|$|Chetro Ketl's {{walls were}} {{constructed}} using three bulk materials: stone, clay-sand, and water. Two types of stone were used: a hard gray-brown tabular sandstone {{that forms the}} bench above Chaco Canyon's cliffs, and a softer, tan, massively bedded sandstone that forms the cliffs themselves. Chacoans preferred the harder, tabular stone as {{it was easier to}} shape, but much of it had to be dug up and <b>levered</b> out of the ground with wooden poles. Because the massive tan stone of the cliff faces was easier to procure, but much more difficult to work, the Chacoans probably used it only after the more easily quarried gray-brown stone beds had been depleted.|$|E
5|$|It was {{important}} {{to keep track of}} the amount of ice being loaded onto a ship for both commercial and safety reasons, so ice blocks were each weighed before they went onto a ship, and a total tally of the weight of the ice was recorded. Initially a crude method of loading involving ice tongs and a whip was used to lower the separated blocks of ice into the hold, but an improved method was developed by the 1870s involving a <b>levered</b> platform, superseded by a counterweighted platform device by 1890. Ships were loaded quickly to prevent the ice from melting and, in U.S. ports, an average cargo could be loaded in just two days. Freight charges were paid on the intake, or departure, weight of the cargo, and conditions were laid down on the handling of the ice along the route.|$|E
5|$|Risk parity advocates {{assert that}} the unlevered risk parity {{portfolio}} is quite close to the tangency portfolio, as close as can be measured given uncertainties and noise in the data. Theoretical and empirical arguments are made {{in support of this}} contention. One specific set of assumptions that puts the risk parity portfolio on the efficient frontier is that the individual asset classes are uncorrelated and have identical Sharpe ratios. Risk parity critics rarely contest the claim that the risk parity portfolio is near the tangency portfolio but they say that the leveraged investment line is less steep and that the <b>levered</b> risk parity portfolio has slight or no advantage over 60% stocks / 40% bonds, and carries the disadvantage of greater explicit leverage.|$|E

50|$|The <b>lever</b> tumbler lock, {{which uses}} a set of <b>levers</b> to prevent the bolt from moving in the lock, was perfected by Robert Barron in 1778. His double acting <b>lever</b> lock {{required}} the <b>lever</b> to be lifted to a certain height by having a slot cut in the <b>lever,</b> so lifting the <b>lever</b> too far was as bad as not lifting the <b>lever</b> far enough.

A large difference in rates can be highly profitable for the trader, especially if high leverage is used. However, with all <b>levered</b> investments this is a double edged sword, and large exchange rate price fluctuations can suddenly swing trades into huge losses.|$|E

These acquisitions included Folgers Coffee, Norwich Eaton Pharmaceuticals (the makers of Pepto-Bismol), Richardson-Vicks, Noxell (Noxzema), Shulton's Old Spice, Max Factor, the Iams Company, and Pantene, among others. In 1994, the company made headlines for big losses resulting from <b>levered</b> positions in interest rate derivatives, and subsequently sued Bankers Trust for fraud; this placed their management in the unusual position of testifying in court that they had entered into transactions that they were not capable of understanding. In 1996, P again made headlines when the Food and Drug Administration approved a new product developed by the company, Olestra. Also known by its brand name 'Olean', Olestra is a lower-calorie substitute for fat in cooking potato chips and other snacks.|$|E
25|$|Tiên Sơn cave {{is located}} in Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park. The cave was {{discovered}} by a local inhabitant by accident in 1935. It {{is located in}} Sơn Trach Commune in Bố Trạch. The entry mouth of Tiên Sơn is 1km from Phong Nha cave, {{at an altitude of}} 200 m. This cave is 980 m in length. A 10 m deep hole is situated 400 m from the entry mouth, then a 500 m long underground cave, dangerous for tourists and open to professional expeditionists only. Like Phong Nha cave, this cave features spectacular stalactites and stalagmites shaped like several fairy-tales. Stalactite and stalagmite columns and walls here create strange sounds like that of gong and drum if they are knocked with the hand. According to British cave scientists, Tiên Sơn cave was created tens of million years ago when a water current holed this limestone mount in Kẻ Bàng. Following a series of landforms and movement of rocks, this mass was <b>levered</b> or lowered, blocking the current and creating what is now Tiên Sơn cave while the underground river redirected its current to Phong Nha cave. Although Phong Nha and Tiên Sơn caves are located next to each other, there are no linking grottos between them.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>lever</b> arm {{uses the}} [...] {{to lift the}} load using and intensifying an applied force. In practice, {{conditions}} may prevent {{the use of a}} single <b>lever</b> to accomplish the desired result, e.g., a restricted space, the inconvenient location of the point of delivery of the resultant force, or the prohibitive length of the <b>lever</b> arm needed. In these conditions, combinations of simple <b>levers,</b> called compound <b>levers,</b> are used. Compound <b>levers</b> can be constructed from first, second and/or third-order <b>levers.</b> In all types of compound <b>lever,</b> the rule is that force multiplied by the force arm equals the weight multiplied by the weight arm. The output from one <b>lever</b> becomes the input for the next <b>lever</b> in the system, and so the advantage is magnified.|$|R

500|$|The I-250 was a low-wing, {{all-metal}} aircraft with a monocoque fuselage. Other {{than the}} VRDK the aircraft was largely conventional in layout, although the cockpit was set very {{far back in}} the fuselage, almost {{to the base of}} the vertical tail. The two-spar wings had a thickness of 10% to preserve aileron control and avoid tip stall. They were fitted with Frise ailerons and slotted flaps. Fuel was contained in a [...] fuselage tank and a [...] tank in each wing. The conventional landing gear mainwheels had a <b>levered</b> suspension and retracted inwards. The tail wheel retracted aft into the very small ventral fin. The VK-107A engine initially drove a [...] VISh-105SV propeller.|$|E
500|$|A single wagon {{containing}} five tons of ore {{could be}} lowered down {{the plane in}} twelve minutes. Railway-type signals were used to indicate that an ascending wagon had been attached to the rope; the brakesman at the upper level then <b>levered</b> the descending, loaded wagon to the brow of the hill, and the descent and ascent began. The descent was controlled by braking. The WSMR line was leased to the Brendon Hills Iron Ore Company for seven years from 1859, and the latter was to work the line. The lease was extended and transferred to the Ebbw Vale Iron Company on 24 June 1864. In the same year an advertisement {{was placed in the}} Somerset County Gazette announcing that [...] "coal, culm, lime corn, flour, manure, building materials and other goods" [...] would be carried on the railway at reduced rates.|$|E
500|$|The shot of Dr. Secare {{resurfacing}} out of {{the water}} was created by the visual effects unit.

According to Goodwin, the timing was not quite right, but that failed shot [...] "worked" [...] on a different level and proved to be a [...] "fascinating shot". The scene had to be re-shot later, however. When filming the episode the production crew did not know that Webb had a phobia towards water. The first test shot of Scully removing the alien fetus doll from liquid nitrogen went right, but under the hot studio lights the model started falling apart, leading the following take to flash the lighting in another direction.|$|E
50|$|To {{assist the}} {{operator}} in determining their functions, each <b>lever</b> in a frame will generally be uniquely labelled, one common method being to number the <b>levers</b> in order {{from left to}} right. A <b>lever's</b> identification may be painted on its side or engraved on a badge or plate fitted either to the <b>lever</b> or behind it. This may {{be accompanied by a}} description of the <b>lever's</b> function. Usually, a large track diagram is positioned within easy view of the operator, which clearly shows each <b>lever</b> number adjacent to symbols representing the items of equipment that they operate. <b>Levers</b> are commonly coloured according to the type of equipment they control, the code of colours varying between different railway administrations. For example, in British practice, the following code generally applies: a red <b>lever</b> controls a stop signal or shunt signal, a yellow <b>lever</b> controls a distant signal, a black <b>lever</b> controls a set of points, a blue <b>lever</b> controls a facing point lock, and a white <b>lever</b> is spare. Brown <b>levers</b> are used to lock level crossing gates.|$|R

500|$|When {{co-owner}} Smith died in July 1950, O'Malley {{convinced his}} widow {{to turn over}} control of the shares to the Brooklyn Trust Company, which O'Malley controlled as chief legal counsel. Rickey's contract as general manager was set to expire on October 28, 1950. Rickey's Dodgers stock was held on margin and he had fully <b>levered</b> life insurance policy. O'Malley lowballed Rickey with an offer of $346,000 (the purchase price). Rickey demanded $1 million ($ today). O'Malley eventually pursued a complicated buyout of Rickey, who had received an outside offer from William Zeckendorf of $1million for his interests. [...] There were varying accounts about the sincerity of the offer because Zeckendorf and Pittsburgh Pirates owner John Galbreath were fraternity brothers, but {{there is a lot of}} evidence that he had a sincere interest in acquiring the team. The outside offer triggered a clause in the partnership agreement whereby the asking price of a [...] had to be matched if a current owner wanted to retain control and the third party would be compensated $50,000. The canceled $50,000 check would later include Rickey's signature showing that Zeckendorf turned over the $50,000 to Rickey.|$|E

2500|$|After the inventions of the {{combination}} lock, James Sargent—an employee of Yale—developed the [...] "theft proof lock." [...] This {{was a combination}} lock that worked on a timer. The vault or safe door could only be opened after a set number of hours had passed, thus a kidnapped bank employee could not open the lock {{in the middle of}} the night even under force. Time locks became widespread at banks in the 1870s. This reduced the kidnappings, but set bank robbers to work again at prying or blasting open vaults. Thieves developed tools for forcing open a tiny crack between the vault door and frame. As the crack widened, the thieves <b>levered</b> the door open or poured in gunpowder and blasted it off. Vault makers responded with a series of stair-stepped grooves in the door frame so the door could not be <b>levered</b> open. But these grooves proved ideal for a new weapon: liquid nitroglycerin. Professional bank robbers learned to boil dynamite in a kettle of water and skim the nitroglycerin off the top. They could drip this volatile liquid into the door grooves and destroy the door. Vault makers subsequently redesigned their doors so they closed with a thick, smooth, tapered plug. The plug fit so tightly that there was no room for the nitroglycerin.|$|E

Forward traction is added by rotating the <b>lever</b> counter-clockwise, or [...] "forward". As the <b>lever</b> translates linear motion by the operator into rotary motion of the <b>lever,</b> the level is normally topped with a rotating knob at the right end. This allows the operator to slide the <b>lever</b> without twisting their wrist.
