5|$|Contador {{continued}} to be troubled by his injury during stage 8, which finished on the climb of the Campitello Matese. The stage was won by Beñat Intxausti (Movistar), {{who was in the}} day's early breakaway and attacked on the final climb. Astana again rode hard to put pressure on the other riders; eventually a group formed of Contador, Aru, Porte and <b>Landa.</b> <b>Landa</b> then attacked and finished second on the stage, 15 seconds ahead of the other three riders. He therefore moved up into fifth place overall, while Contador increased his lead over Aru by winning bonus seconds at an intermediate sprint. Stage 9 was also won by a rider from a breakaway: Paolo Tiralongo (Astana) took a solo victory. Aru, Contador, Porte and <b>Landa</b> were again alone in a group {{towards the end of the}} stage; although they came to the finish together, Aru took a second out of the others in the sprint. This moved him to three seconds behind Contador. The following day was the first rest day of the race.|$|E

5|$|Rubén Plaza (Lampre-Merida) led the {{breakaway}} {{over the}} second climb of the day, with Fraile second. The breakaway was around two minutes {{ahead of the}} peloton. Imanol Erviti (Movistar) attacked on the descent and led the race solo for some distance; he was first to reach {{the summit of the}} next climb, the Coll de la Rabassa, with Fraile again second. He was eventually brought back by work from Mikel <b>Landa</b> (Astana) on the descent.

Fraile was first over the summit.

Froome lost two minutes on the climb. Nicolas Roche was also dropped from the lead group and Mikel Nieve took over the leadership of Team Sky.|$|E
5|$|The codex {{has played}} a key role in the {{deciphering}} of Mayan hieroglyphs. Dresden librarian Ernst Wilhelm Förstemann published the first complete facsimile in 1880. He deciphered the calendar section of the codex, including the Maya numerals used therein. Förstemann determined that these numbers, along with deities and day names, related to the Mayan calendar and the Mayan Long Count calendar. In the 1950s Yuri Knorozov used a phonetic approach based on the De <b>Landa</b> alphabet for decoding the codex, which was followed up in the 1980s by other scholars that did additional deciphering based on this concept.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{opposing}} theories regarding {{the origins of}} ancient Filipinos. F. <b>Landa</b> Jocano theorizes that the ancestors of the Filipinos evolved locally. Wilhelm Solheim's Island Origin Theory postulates that the peopling of the archipelago transpired via trade networks originating in the Sundaland area around 48,000 to 5000BC rather than by wide-scale migration. The Austronesian Expansion Theory explains that Malayo-Polynesians coming from Taiwan began migrating to the Philippines around 4000BC, displacing earlier arrivals.|$|E

5|$|Use and {{knowledge}} of the Maya script continued until the 16th century Spanish conquest at least. Bishop Diego de <b>Landa</b> Calderón of the Catholic Archdiocese of Yucatán prohibited the use of the written language, effectively ending the Mesoamerican tradition of literacy in the native script. He worked with the Spanish colonizers to destroy the bulk of Mayan texts as part of his efforts to convert the locals to Christianity and away from what he perceived as pagan idolatry. Later he described the use of hieroglyphic writing in the religious practices of Yucatecan Maya in his Relación de las cosas de Yucatán.|$|E

Then Yolanda Ordaz de la Cruz was killed (July 2011), followed by Martínez Pérez (April 2012). Just {{a few days after}} her death, the mutilated bodies of four media professionals were discovered. There would be still another journalist murdered in Veracruz: Víctor Manuel Báez (June 2012). Although not officially counted in the death toll of journalists, at least three journalists have been kidnapped and have remained in captivity since 2010: Manuel Gabriel Fonseca Hernández (September 2011), Miguel Morales Estrada (July 2012), and Sergio <b>Landa</b> Rosales (November 2012).|$|E
5|$|The {{team had}} a {{successful}} Vuelta a Burgos in August. Defending champion Sánchez won the first stage, atop , by outkicking Joaquim Rodríguez in sight of the line as the two finished four seconds {{better than any other}} riders. However, he lost the race lead to Rodríguez when the latter won stage 2 in the city of Burgos. The stage 3 team time trial then dropped Sánchez to fifth overall, before he improved to fourth after stage 4. <b>Landa</b> won stage 5 from a breakaway, his first professional victory. Winning the final climb also gave him enough points to take the race's mountains classification. The squad placed three riders in the top ten, with Sánchez fourth, Antón eighth, and Nieve tenth. Antón rounded out the team's season by winning the climber's prize at the inaugural Tour of Beijing.|$|E
