25|$|Natural {{gas heating}} systems may cause carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning if unvented or poorly vented. In 2011, natural gas furnaces, space heaters, water heaters and stoves were blamed for 11 carbon monoxide deaths in the US. Another 22 deaths were attributed to appliances running on <b>liquified</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas,</b> and 17 deaths on gas of unspecified type. Improvements in natural gas furnace designs have greatly reduced CO poisoning concerns. Detectors are also available that warn of carbon monoxide and/or explosive gas (methane, propane, etc.).|$|E

On the evening of 27 February 2002, Vishwa Hindu Parishad declared a statewide strike in response to the Godhra train burning incident, starting from 28 February. On {{the first day of the}} strike, a mob of approximately 5,000 people, allegedly led by the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Bajrang Dal, attacked and attempted to burn the entire Muslim community of Naroda Patiya. The rioting began at 9 am when the Noorani Mosque was destroyed by exploding <b>liquified</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> (LPG) cylinders.|$|E
50|$|Some oils burn {{in liquid}} or aerosol form, {{generating}} light, and heat {{which can be}} used directly or converted into other forms of energy such as electricity or mechanical work. To obtain many fuel oils, crude oil is pumped from the ground and is shipped via oil tanker or a pipeline to an oil refinery. There, it is converted from crude oil to diesel fuel (petrodiesel), ethane (and other short-chain alkanes), fuel oils (heaviest of commercial fuels, used in ships/furnaces), gasoline (petrol), jet fuel, kerosene, benzene (historically), and liquefied <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas.</b> A 42-gallon barrel (U.S.) of crude oil produces approximately 10 gallons of diesel, 4 gallons of jet fuel, 19 gallons of gasoline, 7 gallons of other products, 3 gallons split between heavy fuel oil and <b>liquified</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gases,</b> and 2 gallons of heating oil. The total production of a barrel of crude into various products results in an increase to 45 gallons. Not all oils used as fuels are mineral oils, see biodiesel and vegetable oil fuel.|$|R
40|$|The Saudi Arabian {{natural gas}} {{industry}} and its downstream activity, particularly petrochemicals, {{is characterized by}} its dependence on the country's crude oil production. This is because the main input into these industries is associated natural gas. Most of the Saudi gas-based petrochemical products are sold in international markets where their cost advantage over naphtha-based products is directly proportional to the crude oil price. The profits from Saudi natural gas and its dependent industries are influenced by two countervailing factors. The first {{is that of the}} level of crude oil production which determines the utilization level of the gas industry. The second is the international crude oil price on which the returns from petrochemicals, <b>liquified</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gases</b> and natural gasoline are directly proportional. This creates a tradeoff situation and necessitates finding a crude oil production level subject to optimizing the country's gas utilization system. A linear programming model is constructed to establish this level and to investigate possible ways to satisfy the country's future gas requirement. The results of the model indicate that the associated gas produced in conjunction with 6. 78 million barrels of crude oil per day is needed to operate the gas utilization system at capacity. However, the model estimates that gas associated with a daily crude oil production level of 4. 35 million barrels produces the highest returns from the system. Furthermore, to meet the country's gas requirements for 1990 and 2000, based on 4. 35 million barrels per day of crude oil, the current daily nonassociated gas capacity should be expanded to 2. 27 and 3. 15 billion cubic feet, respectively...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT A {{comprehensive}} {{survey was}} made to determine the type, amount, and cost of fuel used in growing poultry in the United States. Information was obtained from many sources including 16 broiler, 13 layer, 9 turkey and 4 duck integrators, individual growers, Cooperative Extension poultry specialists, state, regional, and national poultry associations, the Alabama Power Company, and USDA statistics. The type and amount of fuel used varied among {{regions of the country}} and with the type of poultry. <b>Liquified</b> <b>petroleum</b> (LP) <b>gas</b> was used in growing slightly more than four-fifths of the poultry. Other fuels used were natural gas, fuel oil, and coal. Total fuel used for brooding all types of poultry produced 1. 95 X 101 6 joules (1. 85 X 101 3 BTU) of energy per year. Estimated cost of fuel for growing poultry was approximately 55 million dollars. Follow-up studies during die winter of 1976 — 77 indicated an approximately 2 % reduction in total fuel usage and a 10 % increase in price. Further reductions in amount used are possible and are occurring each year. However, the rate of improvement will be influenced by severity of weather and management trends...|$|R
