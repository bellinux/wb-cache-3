5|$|The Castellania was {{the supreme}} court of justice of the islands, hence called Gran Corte or the {{variants}} in legal documents. The Grand Master had the absolute power to preside over the institution. The Papacy quarreled for a superior decision, such as when there was conflict with the court of the Bishop, but citing sovereignty of the princely Grand Master it was never conceded. With the presence of the Inquisition, the Holy See considered Malta similar to a colony, but through the Castellania the Order kept rigid control and sovereignty over Malta. Though the Inquisition had the power to issue a death penalty in cases related to religion, such as heresy, fornication and sodomy, it generally <b>left</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> the discretion of the Castellania. In its time, the Castellania was considered to be a secular court, and the law was amended with the issue of a Bando by the Grand Master. In military context the knights were not subject to the Castellania, and were instead prosecuted at the Military Tribunal (Tribunale Militare), however it received assistance from the higher hierarchy of the Castellania such as from the judge of the criminal court.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{considered}} [...] "Subtle Invitation" [...] {{to be one}} of the album's strongest songs {{because of}} its [...] "well executed" [...] jazz influence. The song begins with the sounds of people dining, then introduces the strong bassline and drums. Towards the end of the song, Carey belts out the climax. Sarah Rodman from The Boston Herald described it as fascinating and wrote, [...] "it sounds as though Carey is singing in falsetto while still in her chest voice." [...] "Clown" [...] drew strong media attention, and its lyrical content led critics to speculate that Carey aimed it at rapper Eminem, who had publicly announced that he had had a relationship with Carey. Rodman said [...] "Clown" [...] was [...] "languidly sinister", with lyrics such as, [...] "I should've <b>left</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> 'I like your music too'...You should never have intimated we were lovers / when you know very well we never even touched each other." [...] Critics compared [...] "I Only Wanted" [...] with [...] "My All"s instrumentation and structure of verse, chorus and guitar solo. According to Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine, Carey makes vague allusions to her ex-husband Tommy Mottola with the line, [...] "Wish I'd stayed beneath my veil". The song uses Latin-inspired guitar instrumentation and wind sounds as an additional backbone to the melody, and dripping water as its percussion.|$|E
