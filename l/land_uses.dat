We have collected 12 papers in this special issue “Sustainable <b>Land</b> <b>Use</b> in China” to show the varied application of sustainable <b>land</b> <b>use</b> studies and to provide meaningful decision-making information and policy implications for <b>land</b> <b>use</b> planners. We summarize the contributions to this special issue on sustainable <b>land</b> <b>use</b> and place them in perspective. Several studies focus on sustainable urban <b>land</b> <b>use,</b> some focus on sustainable rural <b>land</b> <b>use,</b> and others on environmental issues on <b>land</b> <b>use.</b> These studies have analyzed a broad array of topics related to <b>land</b> <b>use,</b> including the dynamic changes and driving forces of <b>land</b> <b>use</b> spatial patterns, sustainable <b>land</b> <b>use,</b> <b>land</b> <b>use</b> policy and optimization, and the environmental problems related to certain types of <b>land</b> <b>use...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Land</b> <b>use</b> {{classification}} {{is important}} as a standard for <b>land</b> <b>use</b> description and management. However, current <b>land</b> <b>use</b> classification systems are problematic. Labels such as "residential use" and "commercial use" do not fully reveal how the <b>land</b> <b>use</b> is used in terms of function, mix use and changes over time. As a result, <b>land</b> <b>use</b> planning is often a natural prompt of segregation; <b>Land</b> <b>use</b> is poorly connected with other fields of urban studies such as transportation and energy consumption. The problems of <b>land</b> <b>use</b> are partly because <b>land</b> <b>use</b> classification has been an expediency rather than of rigorous thought. However, recent researches about <b>land</b> <b>use</b> classification have mainly focused on the methods of estimating <b>land</b> <b>use</b> types, without challenging the conventional instructional definition of <b>land</b> <b>use</b> typology itself. In contrast, this thesis aims to ask a more fundamental question: what are the elements, the principles, and the process to build the <b>land</b> <b>use</b> typology for given purposes. This thesis accordingly proposes the syntax of developing a <b>land</b> <b>use</b> typology, where five basic elements compose the framework of <b>land</b> <b>use</b> description: <b>land</b> <b>use</b> function, <b>land</b> <b>use</b> intensity, <b>land</b> <b>use</b> connectivity, probability and scale. While the elements are abstract concepts, when developing a <b>land</b> <b>use</b> typology, each {{of them could be}} defined with specific measures for purposes such as <b>land</b> <b>use</b> planning, <b>land</b> <b>use</b> management, energy analysis, transportation study. After the <b>land</b> <b>use</b> typology is composed with the defined elements, it can be applied to examine <b>land</b> mixed <b>use,</b> <b>land</b> <b>use</b> conflict, <b>land</b> <b>use</b> change and estimation. The syntax then proposes the basic principles and process to develop a satisfied <b>land</b> <b>use</b> typology, with respect to the reliability and validity, the significance and necessity, the measurability and operability, and the adaptability and flexibility. With that, this thesis argues that beyond the theoretical definition, the practical context, such as data availability or planning schema will influence the feasibility of a <b>land</b> <b>use</b> typology. While the scope of the syntax could be limited by practical tools and availability of data, the coming age of big data provides a changing context of <b>land</b> <b>use</b> typology. The followed case study illustrates such a process of developing <b>land</b> <b>use</b> typology with geo-social network data. The case develops a social media based <b>land</b> <b>use</b> typology, collects data for two example cities: Boston, U. S and Shenzhen, China, and applies the defined <b>land</b> <b>use</b> typology to classify their <b>uses</b> of <b>land.</b> As a result, Boston's <b>land</b> <b>use</b> I classified by its function, intensity and the level of mix use; Shenzhen <b>land</b> <b>use</b> is classified by its intensity, connectivity and the level of mix use. Compared with the conventional <b>land</b> <b>use</b> classification systems, the social media based typology provides a more comprehensive description of <b>land</b> <b>use,</b> with its focuses on human activities of the city and multiple dimensions of urban <b>land</b> <b>use.</b> It also has advantages with the flexibility and efficiency of data collection. In conclusion, the syntax of <b>land</b> <b>use</b> typology highlights the process of building <b>land</b> <b>use</b> typology, by defining the basic components of <b>land</b> <b>use</b> typology. It enables many possibilities of <b>land</b> <b>use</b> description with the help of big data, and reserves enough space to go beyond the existing tools and techniques. At last, the thesis proposes for future studies on the different interpretations of the syntax, its application on planning tools and systems, and potential for new types of <b>land</b> <b>use.</b> by Liqun Chen.

The proposed models were applied to assess the impacts of different <b>land</b> <b>use</b> scenarios that include various spatial and non-spatial policies in the Wu-Tu watershed in northern Taiwan.

A new stop at Rockaway Beach Boulevard and Beach 84th Street would replace stops at Beach 81st Street and Beach 86th Street on the Q52. In Broad Channel two stops would be relocated: the northbound stop at Cross Bay Boulevard and East 9th Road would be moved north to Noel Road to be symmetrical with the southbound stop, and the southbound stop at West 15th Road would be moved south to West 17th Road to be symmetrical with the northbound stop, and to be adjacent to a crosswalk. Stops on Woodhaven Boulevard would be modified as well: the stop at Atlantic Avenue would be moved north to 91st Avenue, allowing Q52 and Q53 service to use the overpass over Atlantic Avenue using the bus lane, as opposed to using the slow service road. Two SBS stops will be added–at 101st Avenue and Woodhaven Boulevard, and at Pitkin Avenue and Cross Bay Boulevard–to provide transfers to the Q8 and Q11, respectively.

However, no single model is able to capture all of key processes essential to explore <b>land</b> <b>use</b> change at different scales and make a full assessment of driving factors and impacts. Based on the multi-scale characteristics of <b>land</b> <b>use</b> change, combination and integration of currently existed models of <b>land</b> <b>use</b> change could be a feasible solution. Taken Sangong watershed as a case study, this paper describes an integrated methodology in which the conversion of <b>land</b> <b>use</b> and its effect model (CLUE), a spatially explicit <b>land</b> <b>use</b> change model, has been combined with a system dynamic model (SD) to analyze <b>land</b> <b>use</b> dynamics at different scales. A SD model {{is used to calculate}} area changes in demand for land types as a whole while a CLUE model is used to transfer these demands to <b>land</b> <b>use</b> patterns. Without the spatial consideration, the SD model ensures an appropriate treatment of macro-economic, demographic and technology developments, and changes in economic policies influencing the demand and supply for <b>land</b> <b>use</b> in a specific region. With CLUE model the <b>land</b> <b>use</b> change has been simulated at a high spatial resolution with the spatial consideration of <b>land</b> <b>use</b> suitability, spatial policies and restrictions to satisfy the balance between <b>land</b> <b>use</b> demand and supply. The application of the combination of SD and CLUE model in Sangong watershed suggests that this methodology have the ability to reflect the complex behaviors of <b>land</b> <b>use</b> system at different scales to some extent and be a useful tool for analysis of complex <b>land</b> <b>use</b> driving factors such as <b>land</b> <b>use</b> policies and assessment of its impacts on <b>land</b> <b>use</b> change.
