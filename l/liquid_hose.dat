40|$|Pneumatic {{sprayers}} {{are widely}} used in vineyards due to their very fine droplet size, which makes the drift risk to become an important problem to be considered. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the effect of the spout diameter at the release point on the spray droplet size and uniformity achieved for different liquid flow rates (LFR) and air flow rates (AFR). A test bench was developed to simulate a real pneumatic sprayer under laboratory conditions, and it was empirically adjusted to match the air pressure conditions as closely as possible to real working conditions. Two positions of insertion of the <b>liquid</b> <b>hose,</b> the conventional position (CP) and an alternative position (AP), were tested for three LFRs, 1. 00, 1. 64, and 2. 67 Lmin- 1, and four AFRs, 0. 280, 0. 312, 0. 345, and 0. 376 m 3 s- 1. The air speed decrease between the two insertion points of the <b>liquid</b> <b>hose</b> was measured. A Malvern SprayTec® instrument was used to measure the droplet size, and the D 50, D 10, and D 90 parameter values were obtained. The relative SPAN factor (RSF) was also calculated. A model to predict variations in D 50 was fitted using the aforementioned parameters. The results show that variations in the diameter of the spout significantly change the droplet size, producing a mean increase of 59. 45 % in D 50 and similar increases in D 10 and D 90. The model developed to predict variations in D 50 has a very high degree of accuracy (R 2 = 0. 945). The relative decrease in the air speed along the spout did not present significant differences for the different airflow rates tested. The results of the study show that the droplet size produced in pneumatic spraying can be modified easily by varying the air spout dimensions. This should be taken into account by manufacturers from a design point of view. Postprint (author's final draft...|$|E
50|$|<b>Liquid</b> <b>hoses</b> for LPG are {{specifically}} designed and rated for the pressures that exist in LPG systems, and are made from materials designed to be compatible with the fuel.

50|$|Nick, Monroe, Renard and Markus {{go to the}} {{mountain}} and take the rocks to a warehouse {{to wait for the}} Volcanalis to arrive. Using Markus as a bait, the Volcanalis appears and while advancing towards him, Nick, Monroe and Renard use the <b>liquid</b> nitrogen <b>hoses</b> to wash him and freeze him as a solid rock. Seeing he is still alive, Nick gives Markus a hammer to kill it so he can avenge his wife. Markus hits the Volcanalis until its eyes freeze over. Meanwhile, Juliette decides to remake the previous memories of Nick and she manages to control the problem. The episode ends as she now remembers the memory of Nick proposing to her.|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{behaviour}} of liquid in a flexible hose {{is difficult to}} model because of complex interactions between the <b>liquid</b> and the <b>hose</b> wall. This results in two sets of coupled axial waves in the liquid and in the wall travelling at two different wavespeeds. A method for time domain modelling is described which represents wave propagation at the two different wavespeeds, including viscoelastic damping. Good agreement between model and measurement is obtained. Simple corrections are included for low-frequency and static effects including viscoelastic relaxation and non-linearities...|$|R
5000|$|A {{hydration}} pack {{is a type}} of hydration system {{built as}} a backpack or waistpack containing a reservoir or [...] "bladder" [...] commonly made of rubber or flexible plastic. The reservoir contains a capped mouth for filling with <b>liquid</b> and a <b>hose</b> that allows the wearer to drink hands-free. Most hoses end with a [...] "bite valve" [...] that opens when the user bites down on it; the valve may be protected by a dust cover. Some hydration packs are insulated to keep water from freezing or becoming warm.|$|R
5000|$|Because {{the hose}} {{attaches}} {{to the bottom of}} the bladder, in order to let the last of the <b>liquid</b> into the <b>hose,</b> air that reaches the opening bubbles to the top of the bladder, and is trapped there until the liquid is nearly drained. Each time more air is blown into the bladder than the amount of liquid contained inside the hose, the pressure inside the bladder increases, and the more effort blowing back involves. Therefore, the technique profits from enough attention to develop a sense of when the hose is nearly full of air.|$|R

50|$|Dantec’s FIRESAFE hose is fire {{resistant}} for {{in excess of}} 30 minutes at temperatures up to 1,200 °C. It is designed to carry highly flammable liquids in environments where there is increased risk of explosion.FIRESAFE is made {{of a series of}} specially designed ceramic cloths and heat reflective films which counter the radiant heat effects of fire. This construction allows vapour to burn off slowly as the increased heat of the <b>liquid</b> inside the <b>hose</b> vaporises and seeks to escape. The fire retardant hose remains intact under fire attack and will not forcefully expel its contents. This construction retains the advantages of composite hose including flexibility and durability.|$|R
5000|$|Advocates {{point out}} that <b>liquid</b> in the <b>hose</b> (where it is all within 3/16 inch (5 mm) of the air) warms or cools {{relatively}} rapidly toward the ambient temperature, and value the reduction of this when nearly all the liquid is in the bladder. There it is as much as several inches (10 cm) from the bladder surface, {{and it may be}} still further insulated by a pack and its other contents. When the air temperature is below freezing if the hose isn't cleared it can rapidly freeze blocking the hose. This often occurs skiing where high wind speed and low temperatures are combined.|$|R
5000|$|Skylab had a zero-gravity shower {{system in}} the work and {{experiment}} section of the Orbital Workshop. [...] The shower that had a cylindrical curtain that went from the floor to ceiling, and inside water was dispensed at {{the push of a}} button from a nozzle {{at the end of a}} flexible hose. In addition there was a vacuum system to suck away water. The floor of the shower (in the usual orientation of this module) had foot restraints. The user had to bring a bottle of pressurized water, which was dispensed through the flexible <b>hose.</b> <b>Liquid</b> soap was used with this shower, and the use of both this soap and the water for showers were carefully planned out as with most items on the station. The first astronaut to use the space shower was Paul J. Weitz (On Skylab 2, the first manned mission [...] ) The system was designed for up to 6 pints (3/4 of a gallon or about 2.84 liters) of water per shower. The water was dispensed from a push button nozzle attached to flexible hose, which took water from the personal hygiene tank.|$|R

Because it is lines on paper when I do it in the comic book series. It's like, 'Oh, okay, Charlie Adlard ... doesn't have to draw that arrangement of lines anymore, that person is dead.' But it's very uncomfortable for me to be on set, because I see these actors that are there and, in the source material, I have killed all but two of them. I walk through the set and I'm like, 'Yep, killed that one, killed that one, killed that one.' And it is firing those people. I feel really bad for Emma Bell, just because she was great and I {{would have liked to have}} had her in the show. But, you know, this is The Walking Dead, characters have got to die. Thankfully, Emma was brought onto the show with the understanding that she was only going to be in a certain number of episodes and she knew that she was going to die from the very beginning. But it doesn't really make it any easier. When they were shooting those scenes, I had to fly to Comic-Con and so I wasn't actually there for when she died. But it was very emotional on set and I know that she was very upset about having to leave the crew and the actors. You kind of become a family when you're doing a TV show and it's a little upsetting to have to get rid of somebody.|$|R
5000|$|Principal {{photography}} for {{the episode}} transpired at the Goat Farm Arts Center in the West Midtown neighborhood of Atlanta, Georgia. [...] "Vatos" [...] features a sequence near {{the conclusion of}} the episode, in which a horde of walkers invades and attacks the campgrounds. The scene was written by Robert Kirkman, who based it closely on a similar sequence in the comics. Kirkman stated that he was very excited to develop the sequence and added that it was a familiar task for him:It was very exciting. I got to write the attack {{at the end of the}} episode—which was very much something that happened in the comic book series—so I knew I would be revisiting something I had already written. But as we were in the writers' room, when things started shifting which led to all this new stuff that wasn't in the comic book series, I thought that was great because it wasn't me writing the same-old same-old or rewriting something I had already done and trying to make it interesting for myself. It was really an entirely new story: getting the gang members in there and getting to write Daryl ... which is one of my favorite characters on the show, despite the fact that he’s not in the comic book. It was a blast.This episode marked the last regular appearance of Emma Bell (Amy), whose character was killed off in {{the conclusion of the}} installment.
