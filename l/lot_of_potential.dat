5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jennifer Crittenden. She came into the writers' room and pitched {{the idea that there}} should be a teachers' strike in an episode. Then-show runner David Mirkin thought the episode had a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>potential,</b> and much of it is based on his {{experience}} as a child with schools running out of money. Despite the title of the episode, at no point does the PTA (Parent-Teacher Association) actually disband. The title was suggested by Mirkin and was intended to poke fun at Crittenden, who thought the most exciting part of the teachers going on strike would be that the PTA might disband. In addition to this, Mirkin added a character to the episode who, on thinking the PTA has disbanded, jumps panicking out of a window. He jumps back in the same window when he is told the PTA has not disbanded.|$|E

25|$|Andrija Hebrang accused his party's dissidents, Vidošević and Primorac, {{as well as}} most right-wing {{candidates}} for 'stealing' his votes saying the result was that two left-wingers would face-off in the second round. Despite this, he called the election a great victory of the right claiming that right-leaning candidates combined achieved better results that left-leaning candidates combined. In making this assertion, he failed to consider Bandić as left-leaning, and ignored Vidošević's appeal to the left-leaning voters as well. Vidošević conceded defeat saying that one should never blame his failures on others, but himself. He urged the public to continue believing in a better tomorrow saying that Croatia should be a country of knowledge and justice, not of corruption and divisiveness. Pusić gave a short teary speech calling Croatia a country with a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>potential</b> with only the right leadership.

Clive Sinclair was [...] "amused and gratified" [...] by the attention the machine received but other than what Clarke described as [...] "a few remarkably poor programs on cassette" [...] made little effort to exploit the demand, effectively ceding a very lucrative market to third party suppliers, a decision that undoubtedly forfeited a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>potential</b> earnings.

500|$|Nick Pino of TechRadar, {{giving it}} four stars out of five, {{similarly}} {{felt that the}} Xbox One [...] " [...] more like a media titan today than it did 12 months ago," [...] citing OneGuide, Upload Studio, and Microsoft's decision to drop the Xbox Live Gold requirement for multimedia streaming apps, and that [...] "there's still a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>potential</b> locked away inside the hardware {{of the system that}} developers are just beginning to figure out. So while PlayStation might have the upper hand for now when it comes to certain third-party titles, it may not always remain that way. Just how Microsoft will get it to that point, though, is still a mystery." [...] However, he disfavored the console's dependence upon a subscription for most of its functionality, Kinect's voice recognition, and that some games do not natively run at 1080p resolution, but are upscaled. In an August 2016 review of the Xbox One S model, TechRadar further commended Microsoft's recent improvements to Xbox One, citing a strong lineup of first-party titles in 2015 and further improvements to the console's interface.|$|E

Elaborating on the title's meaning, he told MTV, [...] "No {{matter who you}} are or what your band is about, you can't put a record out without people saying it's derivative of something else. So by saying the record's already been heard, it's kind of like saying, 'Yeah, you're right. We're doing something that's already been done before.'"

500|$|... "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] {{features}} {{the deaths of}} Patricia and Jimmy, who were both consumed by walkers. Alongside {{the deaths of the}} aforementioned characters, the episode's script initially called for the deaths of Hershel, as well as Shane Walsh and Randall, both of whom had died in the previous installment. Since Kirkman felt that there was a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>potential</b> development in Hershel, his death was scrapped from the script. Although plans to write off the character commenced earlier in the season, Mazzara opined that his hypothetical death would have carried no emotional resonance. [...] "The plan was always to whack Hershel, and I actually told Scott Wilson, 'Thanks for everything you've done, but in the next script we're going to kill off your character.' We started writing that and it felt like Hershel's death was playing as a plot device and we were getting no emotional resonance. It was just playing as a gratuitous death. This was one of those examples where we won't play a shocking death for the sense of death; we have to get something out of it. We got nothing out of it. If you look at the shot of Hershel looking back and seeing that barn burning and his farm completely lost to the zombies, that shot was well worth it because we see the farm was really a character and you can only see that through Hershel's eyes. So it was the right call to keep him alive." ...|$|E

About a week after release, Fils-Aimé said the company is in [...] "fact-finding mode" [...] to try to diagnose these issues. In late March, Nintendo reported that the Joy-Con L desync issue was a [...] "manufacturing variation" [...] on a small number of the units, which could be easily fixed; as noted by CNet's Sean Hollister, Nintendo repaired affected controllers by placing a bit of foam near the antenna within the unit to better shield it. Going forward, Nintendo said they do not anticipate any other problems with connectivity issues.

She called the season [...] "a confused, choppy mix of the supernatural seen {{through the lens of}} {{business}} casual... Despite a very good cast and a great origin story, Iron Fist is predictable, a little hammy, and has no real sense of how to tell a cohesive story. As such, it has a few moments that are great and many that are not." [...] Keene also noted the [...] "glacial pace forces plot points and character interactions to be drawn out to a ludicrous degree. Even when things do pick up from there, the editing is choppy, the narrative doesn’t connect particularly well, and Danny’s personality and decision making abilities are split somewhere between an adult man and a 12-year-old boy (which is no real fault of Jones’ — he comes off as charming). It leaves the show with a lot of moving parts and a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>potential,</b> but ultimately without a central drive or clear motivations." [...] Keene agreed with Fienberg on the lack of villain the season presented as well as, [...] "a very awkwardly shoe-horned Claire Temple", noting at this point it is [...] "less and less believable as each show wears on that the eventual Defenders haven’t run into each other, or that these connecting characters don’t bother mentioning other supers they know [...]" [...] She concluded that instead of presenting [...] "what could have been the boldest" [...] of the Marvel Netflix series, it instead [...] "doubled-down on the problems" [...] the other series had instead of learning from them.|$|E

[...] However, he was critical {{of the lack of}} an autosave feature, the implementation of the Ring, which he felt was completely optional, and the combat system, which he called [...] "basic and repetitive." [...] He concluded [...] "what this game has that the EA game doesn't have - chapters, characters and events from the book - is important to a Tolkien fan, and it warrants playtime [...] but without this license, this game is very, very average." [...] GameZone's Michael Knudson scored it 7.4 out of 10 arguing [...] "the game has a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>potential,</b> but a few gameplay quirks ruin it." [...] He concluded [...] "this game will only suit hardcore fans of the J.R.R. Tolkien series." [...] GameSpot's Brad Shoemaker scored it 5.5 out of 10 calling it [...] "an average adventure game with a high-profile license attached." [...] GameSpy's Bryan Stratton scored it 1.5 out of 5, comparing it unfavorably with the film; [...] "the reason that the movie worked was that Peter Jackson knew what to keep from the book, what to fast-forward through, and what to cut altogether.
