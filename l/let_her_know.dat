Brian uses Jillian's wedding as this opportunity, interrupting the ceremony to passionately profess his love for her. Jillian, however, tells Brian (gently) that he had his chance and blew it, as she decided to move on and he needs to as well. Brian is now a miserable, single dog, unable even to go back to Lauren, who has dumped him because he gave her worms.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} few months, Day {{returned}} to moulding Sabrina to meet his requirements for the ideal woman, choosing what she would wear, and pushing his ideas of frugality upon her. Sabrina took on all the ideas willingly and Day believed he had finally created a woman who would meet all his requirements. He was so confident that he talked openly of marrying Sabrina, though she was unaware of his intentions. Eventually one of Day's friends <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>know</b> that he hoped to marry her. Sabrina confronted Day about the rumours and he admitted they were true, neglecting to mention that {{he had hoped to}} marry her since the day he met her.|$|E
5|$|Quatermass II {{received}} positive newspaper {{reviews in}} the Daily Mail and the Daily Express, although the BBC's Radio Times listings magazine published letters of both praise and criticism for the serial. The serial was also criticised internally at the BBC by Cecil McGivern, who felt {{it to be}} {{not as good as}} the original. One letter received by the production team before the transmission of episode five came from a woman in Haverfordwest who was concerned that she would never find out what happened in the end as the week before the final episode's transmission she was due to move to Ireland {{to spend the rest of}} her life in a convent; she wondered if the BBC could possibly write to her and <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>know</b> how the story resolved. After some debate as to whether the letter was a journalistic trick to uncover advance story details, Kneale eventually decided that it was genuine, and allowed Cartier to send a reply outlining the storyline's conclusion. Following episode six, some viewers wrote in to the BBC concerned at Quatermass's survival, as he had not been seen to definitely return to Earth in the experimental rocket ship.|$|E

She was briefly the acting Headmistress after Mrs Trout was sent back to Teacher Training School, but returned to her old post when Mrs Bogart took over as Headmistress. As a teacher she was incompetent - she never made the children do any work and just let them play games all day when she was acting Headmistress.|$|E

I would like the expert physicians who are condemning me for my action, which has proven their ability, to take a perfectly sane and healthy woman, shut her up and make her sit from 6 a.m. until 8 p.m. on straight-back benches, do not allow her to talk or move during these hours, give her no reading and <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>know</b> nothing of the world or its doings, give her bad food and harsh treatment, and see {{how long it will}} take to make her insane.

500|$|From {{the mid-1950s}} rumours began to {{circulate}} that Blyton had not written {{all the books}} attributed to her, a charge she found particularly distressing. She published an appeal in her magazine asking children to <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>know</b> if they heard such stories and, after one mother informed {{her that she had}} attended a parents' meeting at her daughter's school during which a young librarian had repeated the allegation, Blyton decided in 1955 to begin legal proceedings. The librarian was eventually forced to make a public apology in open court early the following year, but the rumours that Blyton operated [...] "a 'company' of ghost writers" [...] persisted, as some found it difficult to believe that one woman working alone could produce such a volume of work.|$|E
500|$|In 1774, Day visited Sabrina {{to inform}} {{her that she}} would be apprenticed to the Parkinsons, a family of dressmakers, as Day {{believed}} the profession would not expose her to temptation. She was delivered to the family with the stipulation that she should work hard at chores and be denied luxuries. The Parkinsons, however, treated Sabrina well, to the extent that Day later chastised them for not instilling [...] "industry and frugality" [...] in her. Less than a year later the Parkinsons' business went bankrupt, leaving Sabrina without an apprenticeship and nowhere to live. Day arranged for her to stay with his friends, the Keir family, and implied that she could take on the role of housekeeper at his own home. Day again considered Sabrina, who was now 18, a potential wife, but did not <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>know</b> of his intentions, nor that her upbringing was part of his experiment.|$|E

500|$|Because Poe did {{not have}} visitors, Moran was {{probably}} {{the only person to}} see the author in his last days. Even so, Moran's credibility has been questioned repeatedly, if not considered altogether untrustworthy. Throughout the years after Poe's death, his story changed as he wrote and lectured on the topic. He claimed (in 1875 and again in 1885, for example) that he had immediately contacted Poe's aunt (and mother-in-law), Maria Clemm, to <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>know</b> about Poe's death; in fact, he wrote to her only after she had requested it on November 9, almost a full month after the event. He also claimed that Poe had said, quite poetically, as he prepared to draw his last breath: [...] "The arched heavens encompass me, and God has his decree legibly written upon the frontlets of every created human being, and demons incarnate, their goal will be the seething waves of blank despair." [...] The editor of the New York Herald, which published this version of Moran's story, admitted, [...] "We cannot imagine Poe, even if delirious, constructing [...]" [...] Poe biographer William Bittner attributes Moran's claim to a convention of assigning pious last words to console mourners.|$|E

500|$|In 1890, the Queen had Karim's {{portrait}} {{painted by}} Heinrich von Angeli. According to the Queen, von Angeli was keen to paint Karim {{as he had}} never painted an Indian before and [...] "was so struck with his handsome face and colouring". On 11 July 1890, she wrote to Lansdowne, and the Secretary of State for India Lord Cross, for [...] "a grant of land to her really exemplary and excellent young Munshi, Hafiz Abdul Karim". The ageing Queen did not trust her relatives and the Royal Household {{to look after the}} Munshi after she was gone, and so sought to secure his future. Lansdowne replied that grants of land were given only to soldiers, and then only in cases of long and meritorious service. [...] Nevertheless, the Viceroy agreed to find a grant for Karim that would provide about 600 rupees annually, the same amount that an old soldier could expect after performing exceptionally. [...] Victoria wrote to Lansdowne repeatedly between July and October, pressuring him on the land grant. Apart from wasteland, there was little government-controlled land near Agra; thus Lansdowne was having trouble finding a suitable plot. On 30 October, the Munshi left Balmoral for four months' leave in India, travelling on the same ship as Lady Lansdowne. On the same day, Lord Lansdowne telegraphed the Queen to <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>know</b> that a grant of land in the suburbs of Agra had been arranged.

"'97 Bonnie & Clyde", {{which was}} {{formerly}} {{featured on the}} Slim Shady EP as [...] "Just the Two of Us", was rerecorded for The Slim Shady LP to feature his daughter Hailie's vocals. Because the song focuses on disposing of his girlfriend's corpse, Eminem was not comfortable with explaining the situation to Kim, and instead {{told her that he}} would be taking Hailie to Chuck E. Cheese's. However, he really took her to the recording studio. He explained, [...] "When she found out I used our daughter to write a song about killing her, she fucking blew. We had just got back together for a couple of weeks. Then I played her the song and she bugged the fuck out." [...] Eminem also said, [...] "When she (Hailie) gets old enough, I'm going to explain it to her. I'll <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>know</b> that Mommy and Daddy weren't getting along at the time. None of it was to be taken too literally, although at the time I wanted to fucking do it." [...] The song [...] "Guilty Conscience" [...] contains a humorous reference to an occasion in which Dr. Dre assaulted rapper Dee Barnes. [...] Having only known Dr. Dre for a few days, Eminem was anxious about how he would react to such a line, and to his relief, Dr. Dre [...] "fell out of his chair laughing" [...] upon hearing the lyric. [...] "Ken Kaniff", a skit involving a prank call to Eminem, featured fellow Detroit rapper Aristotle. [...] After a falling out between the two in the wake of Eminem's breakthrough success, Eminem instead played Ken Kaniff on skits on future albums.|$|E
500|$|Disagreements between female rapper Remy Ma and Minaj {{originated}} in 2007, when Remy {{took note of}} Minaj's freestyle record, nicknamed [...] "Dirty Money", from her mixtape Playtime Is Over (2007).

When the two encountered each other at an industry party, Remy asked Minaj who she was dissing in the song. Nicki Minaj reportedly never confirmed or denied that the song was about Remy, however Remy Ma remarked in a 2010 interview, [...] "To this day I still feel like [...] is a stab at me; I'm gonna [...] back for that one". Since 2011, Remy Ma has stated that she supports Nicki Minaj and her success, [...] but added {{that she would be}} [...] "a problem" [...] to Minaj once she is released from prison. On March 3, 2017, during a visit to The Wendy Williams Show, Remy Ma affirmed that her option in releasing a blatant Minaj diss track titled [...] "Shether" [...] was considered after allegations were brought forward to Ma's camp about Minaj [...] "trying to keep [...] off of red carpets, trying to make sure awards don't go to [...] " [...] and [...] "trying to make people make bad reports about Plata O Plomo album sales." [...] Ma's opinion of Minaj not being a [...] "nice person" [...] and past incidents with Mariah Carey, Taylor Swift, and Lil' Kim were also factors in [...] "Shether"'s release.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} well {{received}} by television critics. Ology writer Josh Harrison gave the episode a {{nine out of}} ten rating, and opined that the episode was a [...] "home run episode" [...] for the series. Harrison continued: [...] "Its central conflict is intense, its action is solid, and its new arrivals are engaging characters in their own right. Light on the gore and heavy on the drama—just how I like my Sunday night zombie adventures." [...] Scott Meslow from The Atlantic gave the episode a positive review, deeming it as an improvement from the previous episode, and appreciated that the episode had opened up new plot points for future episodes to come. Meslow wrote, [...] "At the bare minimum, The Walking Dead should be exciting, and the final moments of [...] "Bloodletting" [...] provides more than enough action." [...] Echoing similar sentiments, Catherine Gee of The Daily Telegraph gave the episode a 3.5 out of 5 stars, and compared it to the second season premiere, opining: [...] "It may have been a calmer episode but there was no shortage of story to chew on." [...] Joe Oesterle of Mania.com commended the opening sequence of the episode, and praised the performances of Lincoln and Bernthal. Oesterle wrote, [...] "Andrew Lincoln and Jon Bernthal [...] gave a fine bit of acting, and I found it interesting how the character Rick started looking and walking a little bit zombish after giving blood. The scenes between the two men were moving, and if you listened close you could decipher the main differences between these two cowboy cops. Rick is bound and determined to get back to his wife and <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>know</b> their son is in mortal danger, without ever doubting his own ability to successfully complete the mission, while Shane on the other hand is not quite as automatically selfless and heroic." [...] In conclusion, Oesterle gave [...] "Bloodletting" [...] a 'B' grade. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode an 8.5 out of ten, signaling a [...] "great" [...] response. Goldman stated that it was an improvement over the last episode, and that it had a great scare moment and cliffhanger. Similarly, Paste Josh Jackson gave the episode an 8.3 out of ten rating, signifying a [...] "commendable" [...] rating. Steve West of Cinema Blend expressed that [...] "Bloodletting" [...] was superior to the previous episode, opining that it was [...] "a character strengthening episode." [...] He continued: [...] "Even those throwaway threads are immensely important to what’s about to go down at the Green farm." ...|$|E
