5|$|Holby City has {{attracted}} comparisons to other medical dramas, often unfavourable, and figures within {{the television and}} entertainment industry including Broadcasting Standards Commission director Paul Bolt have accused the BBC of squandering the television <b>licence</b> <b>fee</b> on the programme. The series employs {{a team of researchers}} to ensure medical accuracy, and utilises surgeons from different disciplines to check scripts. Cast members are taught to perform basic medical procedures, and given the opportunity to spend time on real hospital wards for research. Holby City has, however, been criticised for its lack of realism, with the British Medical Association denouncing its portrayal of organ donation and unrealistic impression of resuscitation, and an accident and emergency nurse at the 2008 Royal College of Nursing conference accusing the show of fostering unrealistic expectations of the NHS and fuelling compensation culture.|$|E
25|$|Even though {{commercial}} quotas {{have been}} removed, commercial revenue and the license fee each contribute {{roughly half of}} the organization's income.

25|$|If {{you could}} {{demonstrate}} that the BBC was grossly extravagant {{there might be a}} case for saying OK take it away. But in fact the BBC per minute in almost every category is as cheap as you can find anywhere in the world and produces the best quality. If you take the money away, which part of the BBC will you remove? The BBC has gone through swingeing staff cuts. It has been cut to the bone, if you divert <b>licence</b> <b>fee</b> money elsewhere, you cut quality and services. There is always that threat from politicians who will say your <b>licence</b> <b>fee</b> is up for grabs. We will take it. There {{is a lot of people}} who want to see the BBC weakened. They talk of this terrible tax of the <b>licence</b> <b>fee.</b> Yet it is the best bargain that is going. Four radio channels and god knows how many TV channels. It is piffling.|$|E

25|$|RTÉ is {{financed by}} a {{television}} <b>licence</b> <b>fee</b> and through advertising. Some RTÉ services are only funded by advertising, while other RTÉ services are only {{funded by the}} <b>licence</b> <b>fee.</b> RTÉ is a statutory body, run by a board appointed by the Government of Ireland. General management of the organisation {{is in the hands}} of the Executive Board headed by the Director-General. RTÉ is regulated by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland. Radio Éireann, RTÉ's predecessor and at the time a section of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, was one of 23 founding organisations of the European Broadcasting Union in 1950.|$|E

50|$|Radio <b>licence</b> <b>fees</b> were {{introduced}} in Australia in the 1920s to fund the first privately owned broadcasters, which were not permitted to sell advertising. With {{the formation of the}} government-owned Australian Broadcasting Commission in 1932 the <b>licence</b> <b>fees</b> were used to fund ABC broadcasts while the privately owned stations were permitted to seek revenue from advertising and sponsorship. Television <b>licence</b> <b>fees</b> were also introduced in 1956 when the ABC began TV transmissions. All <b>licence</b> <b>fees</b> were abolished in 1974 by the Australian Labor Party government led by Gough Whitlam on the basis that the near-universality of television and radio services meant that public funding was a fairer method of providing revenue for government-owned radio and television broadcasters. The ABC has since then been funded by government grants, now totalling around A$1.13 billion a year, and its own commercial activities (merchandising, overseas sale of programmes, etc.).|$|R

25|$|Unlike some {{well-established}} public broadcasters {{such as the}} BBC and NHK, {{which are}} primarily funded via a <b>licence</b> <b>fee</b> system, RTHK is directly funded by an annual government allocation, and operates as a department of the government (similar to the CBC) under the Communications Authority.|$|E

25|$|Sky News {{objected to}} the {{breaking}} of its monopoly, complaining about {{the costs associated with}} running a channel that only a minority could view from the <b>licence</b> <b>fee.</b> Sky News claimed that a number of British cable operators had been incentivised to carry News 24 (which, as a licence-fee funded channel was made available to such operators for free) in preference to the commercial Sky News. However, in September 1999 the European Commission ruled against a complaint made by Sky News that the publicly funded channel was unfair and illegal under EU law. The Commission ruled that the <b>licence</b> <b>fee</b> should be considered state aid but that such aid was justified due to the public service remit of the BBC and that it did not exceed actual costs.|$|E

25|$|Commercial Revenue {{including}} {{the sale of}} advertising and sponsorship. In the early 1990s Minister Ray Burke imposed commercial revenue quotas to {{limit the amount of}} revenue that RTÉ could procure through advertising, in view of the corporation's <b>licence</b> <b>fee</b> income. While such quotas were later removed RTÉ Radio and Television is still limited to 6 minutes of advertising per hour. The commercial division owned 0.086% of the Intelsat satellite firm, which they sold in 2005.|$|E
