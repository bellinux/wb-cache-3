5|$|From {{the work}} of Heaviside (1887) it had become clear that the {{performance}} of telegraph lines, and most especially telephone lines, could be improved {{by the addition of}} inductance to the line. George Campbell at AT implemented this idea (1899) by inserting loading coils at intervals along the line. Campbell found that as well as the desired improvements to the line's characteristics in the passband there was also a definite frequency beyond which signals could not be passed without great attenuation. This was a result of the loading coils and the line capacitance forming a low-pass filter, an effect that is only apparent on lines incorporating lumped components such as the loading coils. This naturally led Campbell (1910) to produce a filter with ladder topology, a glance at the circuit diagram of this filter is enough to see its relationship to a loaded transmission line. The cut-off phenomenon is an undesirable side-effect as far as loaded lines are concerned but for telephone FDM filters it is precisely what is required. For this application, Campbell produced band-pass filters to the same ladder topology by replacing the inductors and capacitors with resonators and anti-resonators respectively. Both the <b>loaded</b> <b>line</b> and FDM were of great benefit economically to AT and this led to fast development of filtering from this point onwards.|$|E

5000|$|Once a DC {{operating}} point {{is defined by}} the DC <b>load</b> <b>line,</b> an AC <b>load</b> <b>line</b> can be drawn through the Q point. The AC <b>load</b> <b>line</b> is a straight line with a slope equal to the AC impedance facing the nonlinear device, which is in general different from the DC resistance. The ratio of AC voltage to current in the device is defined by this line. Because the impedance of the reactive components will vary with frequency, the slope of the AC <b>load</b> <b>line</b> depends on the frequency of the applied signal. So there are many AC <b>load</b> <b>lines,</b> that vary from the DC <b>load</b> <b>line</b> (at low frequency) to a limiting AC <b>load</b> <b>line,</b> all having a common intersection at the DC {{operating point}}. This limiting <b>load</b> <b>line,</b> generally referred to as the AC <b>load</b> <b>line,</b> is the <b>load</b> <b>line</b> of the circuit at [...] "infinite frequency", and can be found by replacing capacitors with short circuits, and inductors with open circuits.|$|R

This kind of block makes a <b>loaded</b> <b>line</b> easier to hold by hand, and is sometimes used on smaller boats for lines like main and jib sheets that are frequently adjusted.|$|E

5000|$|Sources {{that produce}} direct current, such as solar panels must be {{coupled with an}} {{electrical}} inverter to convert the output to alternating current, for use with conventional appliances. The phase of the outgoing power must be synchronized with the grid, and a mechanism must be included to disconnect the feed {{in the event of}} grid failure. This is for safety for example, workers repairing downed power lines must be protected from [...] "downstream" [...] sources, in addition to being disconnected from the main [...] "upstream" [...] distribution grid. Note: A small generator simply lacks the power to energize a <b>loaded</b> <b>line.</b> This can only happen if the line is isolated from other loads, and is extremely unlikely. Solar inverters are designed for safety while one inverter could not energize a line, a thousand might. In addition, all electrical workers should treat every line as though it was live, even when they know it should be safe.|$|E
5000|$|Permalloy was {{initially}} {{developed in the}} early 20th century for inductive compensation of telegraph cables. [...] When the first transatlantic submarine telegraph cables were laid in the 1860s, {{it was found that}} the long conductors caused distortion which reduced the maximum signalling speed to only 10-12 words per minute. The right conditions for transmitting signals through cables without distortion were first worked out mathematically in 1885 by Oliver Heaviside. [...] It was proposed by Carl Emil Krarup in 1902 in Denmark that the cable could be compensated by wrapping it with iron wire, increasing the inductance and making it a <b>loaded</b> <b>line</b> to reduce distortion. However, iron did not have high enough permeability to compensate a transatlantic-length cable. After a prolonged search, permalloy was discovered in 1914 by Gustav Elmen of Bell Laboratories, who found it had higher permeability than silicon steel. [...] Later, in 1923, he found its permeability could be greatly enhanced by heat treatment. [...] A wrapping of permalloy tape could reportedly increase the signalling speed of a telegraph cable fourfold.|$|E

5000|$|In {{single-ended}} single-phase systems {{where the}} Earth and neutral are combined (TN-C, and {{the part of}} TN-C-S systems which uses a combined neutral and earth core), {{if there is a}} contact problem in the PEN conductor, then all parts of the earthing system beyond the break will rise to the potential of the L conductor. In an unbalanced multi-phase system, the potential of the earthing system will move towards that of the most <b>loaded</b> <b>line</b> conductor. Such a rise in the potential of the neutral beyond the break is known as a neutral inversion. Therefore, TN-C connections must not go across plug/socket connections or flexible cables, where there is a higher probability of contact problems than with fixed wiring. There is also a risk if a cable is damaged, which can be mitigated by the use of concentric cable construction and multiple earth electrodes. Due to the (small) risks of the lost neutral raising 'earthed' metal work to a dangerous potential, coupled with the increased shock risk from proximity to good contact with true earth, the use of TN-C-S supplies is banned in the UK for caravan sites and shore supply to boats, and strongly discouraged for use on farms and outdoor building sites, and in such cases it is recommended to make all outdoor wiring TT with RCD and a separate earth electrode.|$|E

40|$|A closed-form {{solution}} for the downwash in the plane of symmetry of an elliptically <b>loaded</b> <b>line</b> is given. This theoretical result is derived from Prandtl's lifting-line theory and assumes that: (1) a three-dimensional wing can {{be replaced by a}} straight lifting line, (2) this line is elliptically loaded, and (3) the trailing wake is a flat-sheet which does not roll up. The first assumption is reasonable for distances greater than about 1 chord from the wing aerodynamic center. The second assumption is satisfied by any combination of wing twist, spanwise camber variation, or planform that approximates elliptic loading. The third assumption is justified only for high-aspect-ratio wings at low lift coefficients and downstream distances less than about 1 span from the aerodynamic center. It is shown, however, that assuming the wake to be fully rolled up gives downwash values reasonably close to those of the flat-sheet solution derived in this paper. The wing can therefore be modeled as a single horseshoe vortex with the same lift and total circulation as the equivalent ellipticity <b>loaded</b> <b>line,</b> and the predicted downwash will be a close approximation independent of aspect ratio and lift coefficient. The flat-sheet equation and the fully rolled up wake equation are both one-line formulas that predict the upwash field in front of the wing, as well as the downwash field behind it. These formulas are useful for preliminary estimates of the complex aerodynamic interaction between two wings (i. e., canard, tandem wing, and conventional aircraft) including the effects of gap and stagger...|$|E
