40|$|<b>Liaison</b> without enchaînement is a {{phenomenon}} found most often in political speech. However, in discussions of <b>liaison</b> in French phonology, it is often ignored or trivialized. The present study seeks to rectify this by taking the steps to explore a few facets of the phenomenon. This study acoustically analyzes the durations of <b>liaison</b> consonants and the vowels which precede them. It was discovered that due to pre-pausal lengthening, <b>liaison</b> non-enchaînée consonants are categorically longer than <b>liaison</b> enchaînée consonants. From {{the evidence of the}} acoustic study, it was also postulated that prosodically <b>liaison</b> is restricted within the domain of the Intonational Phrase. The next major part of the work looks at the frequency of optional <b>liaison</b> and <b>liaison</b> without enchaînement in order to determine if there has been a change in frequency over time. It was discovered that since the 1980 s the realization of optional <b>liaison</b> seems to have increased while the frequency of <b>liaison</b> non-enchaînée has remained stagnant. ...|$|R
40|$|How do French {{listeners}} recognise {{words in}} <b>liaison</b> environments? This article presents a literature review on <b>liaison</b> processing by French adults. First, {{we will see}} that despite phonological variations and resyllabification associated to the <b>liaison</b> phenomenon, lexical access is not impaired for bound words. We will then examine various factors {{that are involved in}} lexical access for words that undergo <b>liaison.</b> We will see that the resolution of <b>liaison</b> depends partly on acoustic cues that distinguish <b>liaison</b> consonants from non-liaison consonants, and partly on the availability of lexical support for a <b>liaison</b> interpretation.

40|$|This paper {{suggests}} that traditional models of <b>liaison</b> librarianship, which focus on <b>liaison</b> with academic units such as teaching departments and specific colleges within institutions, should be adapted and then {{expanded to include}} nonacademic units as well. Although the literature demonstrates that understandings of <b>liaison</b> work have evolved, it still contains almost no examples of how to extend library <b>liaison</b> beyond traditional academic units in a systematic way. As a result, existing <b>liaison</b> programs are too narrowly conceived, and {{the strengths of the}} <b>liaison</b> model are not being fully exploited. By adapting the structures in place to support traditional <b>liaison,</b> such programs can be expanded to include nonacademic units as well. As a result, libraries gain opportunities for broader collaboration on campus. Suggestions for identifying targets for formal nonacademic <b>liaison</b> are provided, as are guidelines for determining suitable <b>liaison</b> activities and ensuring administrative support within the library...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{discuss the}} problem of whether arithmetically Gorenstein schemes are in the Gorenstein <b>liaison</b> class of a {{complete}} intersection. We present some axamples of arithmetically Gorenstein schenes that are indeed in the Gorenstein <b>liaison</b> class of a complete intersection. In the recent research on Gorenstein <b>liaison</b> theory, the question whether any arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay scheme is in the Gorenstein <b>liaison</b> class of a complete intersection, has been of main importance. The intention of this question is to fully generalize Gaeta theorem to arbitrary codimension. Gaeta theorem says that in codimension 2 any arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay scheme is in the complete intersection <b>liaison</b> class of a complete intersection. As {{it has been shown}} in the recent papers on <b>liaison</b> theory, it is likely that in arbitrary codimension Gorenstein <b>liaison</b> behaves better than complete intersection <b>liaison.</b> Indeed, some of the theorems of complete intersection <b>liaison</b> in codimension 2, do not hold for complete intersection <b>liaison</b> in arbitrary codimension but hold when we link by means of arithmetically Gorenstein schemes instead of complete intersection schemes. So it is natural to ask if any arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay scheme is in the Gorenstein <b>liaison</b> class of a complete intersection or briefl...|$|R

Schumacher and Marceau, who have both been expelled from the estate after a fight over Lisette, watch Octave and Christine in the greenhouse.

5|$|In 1932 Waugh {{embarked}} on an extended voyage to South America.

The choice of South America was probably influenced by Peter Fleming, the literary editor of The Spectator. Fleming had recently returned from an expedition to Brazil seeking traces of Colonel Percy Fawcett who, in 1925, had disappeared in Brazil while searching for a fabled lost city.|$|E

5|$|The mid-1880s {{marked a}} turning point in Shaw's life, both {{personally}} and professionally: he lost his virginity, had two novels published, and began a career as a critic.

Shaw's sex life has caused much speculation and debate among his biographers, but there is a consensus that the relationship with Patterson was one of his few non-platonic romantic <b>liaisons.</b>|$|E

5|$|Following {{the first}} Bayreuth Festival, Wagner {{began work on}} Parsifal, his final opera. The {{composition}} took four years, much of which Wagner spent in Italy for health reasons.

Wagner was also much troubled by problems of financing Parsifal, and by the prospect of the work being performed by other theatres than Bayreuth. He was once again assisted by the liberality of King Ludwig, but was still forced by his personal financial situation in 1877 to sell the rights of several of his unpublished works (including the Siegfried Idyll) to the publisher Schott.|$|E

The 21-year-old Alexander was smitten, and was so determined to seduce her that he followed her to the island of Spetses where she holidayed that year. Initially, Aspasia was resistant to his charm; although considered very handsome by his contemporaries, Alexander had a reputation as a ladies' man from numerous past <b>liaisons.</b> Despite this, he finally won her over, and the couple were engaged in secret. However, for King Constantine I, Queen Sophia and much of European society of the time, it was inconceivable for a royal prince to marry someone of a different social rank.|$|E
