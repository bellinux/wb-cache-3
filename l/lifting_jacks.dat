2500|$|Before 1840 {{the firm}} had {{manufactured}} at least two steam engines, the first for Hayward of Yeovil, Somerset and the second for a mill in Glossop, Derbyshire. In that year they were successful in gaining much work {{in the manufacture of}} gas pipes and equipment for gasworks, a new and burgeoning industry. From 1842 until June 1847 the brothers were in partnership, as Galloways & Company, with Joseph Haley, in Manchester and Paris, as [...] "Manufacturers of Patent Screw or <b>Lifting</b> <b>Jacks,</b> and as Patentees of Machines for cutting, punching and compressing Metals, and of the Rivets and other articles constructed by the said last-mentioned Machines... as Cotton Banding Manufacturers". In that month the partnership was dissolved and the Galloways continued to manufacture the machines and rivets in Manchester and Haley continued with the rivets in Paris. By 1856 they had six of these machines in their factory and [...] manufactured two tons of rivets per machine per day, the devices being operated by one man and 20 boys. An example of a wooden-bodied Galloway-Haley lifting jack is in Museo del Ferrocarril (railway museum) in Madrid. The patents were Haley's; for example, patent number 8768 of 31 December 1840 for an improved lifting jack and compressor.|$|E

The gun was complete in every detail, ready for firing, with 37 rounds of ammunition in the trucks. Each shell weighed over 320 kg (704 lbs).|$|E
5000|$|The {{swing bridge}} section is {{approximately}} 26 m long, with an off-centre slewing bearing and an underslung counterweight box. The total slew bridge weight was 354 LT, including the counterweight. The counterweight {{was made from}} almost 90 LT of cut up railway track used to precisely balance the structure during the commissioning works. It was necessary for the swing bridge to be balanced about the centre of slew to give equal loading of the 4 main <b>lifting</b> <b>jacks</b> and the span was accurately weighed by 4 x 100 LT electronic load cells (certified to ±0.5%) February 1987, during the bridge's final installation and commissioning trials.|$|E

50|$|National and {{international}} standards {{have been developed}} to standardize the safety and performance requirements for <b>jacks</b> and other <b>lifting</b> devices. Selection of the standard is an agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer, and has some significance {{in the design of the}} jack. In the United States, ASME has developed the Safety Standard for Portable Automotive Service Equipment, last revised in 2014, including requirements for hydraulic hand jacks, transmission jacks, emergency tire changing jacks, service <b>jacks,</b> fork <b>lift</b> <b>jacks,</b> and other <b>lifting</b> devices.|$|R
50|$|Jamalpur Workshop, {{the first}} {{full-fledged}} railway workshop facility in India, was opened on 8 February 1862, {{at a time}} when the Howrah-Delhi main line, passing through Jamalpur was under construction. It was felt that communities of gun smiths and other craftsmen in the area handling mechanical engineering jobs could pick up the skills required in a railway workshop. It undertook repairs of wagons, coaches, cranes and tower cars, and locomotives, as well as manufacture of some tower cars, break-down cranes and various kinds of heavy-duty <b>lifting</b> <b>jacks.</b> They also produced their own locomotives, starting with the CA 764 Lady Curzon in 1899. It has also produced ticket printers and other ticket machines (slitting, counting, and chopping). With fairly extensive workshop facilities, it was a fairly self-contained.|$|E
5000|$|Later off the peg buses {{such as the}} Daimler Fleetlines {{were less}} suited to this style of {{maintenance}} due to the bodies distorting if removed from their chassis. These vehicles would be overhauled but without separating the body/chassis - indeed, many of them {{did not last long}} enough in London Transport service to receive overhauls. Overhauls of vehicles of this type were therefore carried with the vehicle in [...] "built up" [...] form. LT had to set aside a separate area of the works for this type of work away from the [...] "normal" [...] work. <b>Lifting</b> <b>jacks</b> to raise vehicles were installed to enable access beneath. This type of overhaul resulted in the bus being off the road for weeks or even months, and was a very inefficient use of vehicle fleets.|$|E
5000|$|In March 1857, Richard Tangye, with {{brothers}} James and Joseph, {{started a}} manufacturing business in Mount Street {{under the title}} of James Tangye and Bros. Principally manufacturing hydraulic appliances and particularly <b>lifting</b> <b>jacks,</b> on 31 January 1858, their jacks were successfully employed in the launching of Brunel's steamship [...] Tangye said of the project: We launched the Great Eastern and she launched us In 1859, brothers Edward and George joined, together with George Price. The company acquired the patent of the differential pulley-block in 1861, and in 1862 James Tangye invented the Tangye Patent Hydraulic Jack. This resulted in the 1862 purchase and demolition of Soho-located Smethwick Hall, {{on the site of}} which was built the Cornwall Works. In 1867 the patent for a new type of Direct-acting Steam Pump was acquired, and in 1870 the company commenced the manufacture of steam engines.|$|E
5000|$|The new styling {{increased}} the trunk capacity of both coupes and sedans to [...] This increase was also partially achieved with a now-standard compact spare tire on a 16 in wheel.

2500|$|A <b>lift</b> <b>jack</b> is {{fundamentally}} a lever that {{attaches to the}} scenery wagon platform with a hinge, with a caster mounted to {{the underside of the}} lever near the hinge. When no downward force is applied to the lever handle, the wagon rests securely on the stage; this effectively locks the wagon in place due to friction between the wagon platform and the stage. When the lever handle is forced downward, however, the caster serves as a [...] to lift the wagon slightly above the stage, thus enabling the unit to be rolled.|$|R
50|$|The {{transformer}} {{was mounted}} in the centre part of the locomotive. For removing the transformer {{the roof of the}} centre locomotive body was detachable. The roofs of the outer parts of the locomotive body were detachable separately from the left or right side. The side elements of the three parts of the locomotive body were detachable in segments. The centre body, including the bridging slab, was removable as a whole. The cabinet of cab 1 contained two compressors, while the cabinet of cab 2 contained the brake transformer, a <b>lifting</b> <b>jack</b> and a toolbox.|$|R
5000|$|The diesel shed was in {{reinforced}} concrete and comprised three adjoining buildings. The servicing and maintenance building that covers roads 1-4 {{is on the}} western side of the shed; number 1 road is equipped with a wheel lathe and <b>lifting</b> <b>jacks</b> for bogie changes. The central building was the Heavy Maintenance Shed; engines can be removed and repainting undertaken on the two roads, numbers 5 and 6. The final three roads were in the servicing shed on {{the eastern side of the}} site, where locomotives could be inspected and refuelled. There were covered fuelling points outside in the yard, supplied by a 45,000 gallon fuel tank. A small group of buildings house stores and a workshop for shed equipment and is situated between the main shed and the curve of the Sutton Harbour branch (now realigned to the west of the shed and known locally as the [...] "Speedway"). Carriage washing takes place south of the shed at Mount Gould, alongside the line to Plymouth Friary.|$|E
50|$|Jamalpur Workshop {{has enjoyed}} the {{distinction}} of being the largest and the oldest locomotive repair workshop with the most diversified manufacturing activities on the Indian Railways. At first the Jamalpur shops were merely repairing locomotives and also assembling locomotives from parts salvaged from other or damaged locomotives. By {{the turn of the century}} they had progressed to producing their own locomotives. In year 1899, CA 764 Lady Curzon was produced by the Jamalpur Workshop.In 1893, the first railway foundry in India was set up at Jamalpur Workshop. It also had a boiler workshop for repairing and building boilers. A captive power plant of 5MVA was also developed in the Jamalpur Workshop. In 1870 it was equipped with a rolling mill of its own; unfortunately it’s not working at present.In addition to various repairs of wagons, coaches, cranes and tower cars, and locomotives, Jamalpur also undertakes repair and production of permanent-way fixtures. It also manufactures some tower cars such as Mark II, Mark III and break-down cranes of 10, 20, and 140 tone capacities, besides various kinds of heavy-duty <b>lifting</b> <b>jacks.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{project was}} a {{follow-up}} to Earl's famous 1938 Y-job. Like all his projects, it was built to be roadworthy, and became Earl's personal automobile for two years after finishing its tour of the auto show circuit. With a body made of aluminium, magnesium, and fiberglass, it was powered by a supercharged 215 cuin L V8 able to run on gasoline (petrol) or methanol (like Indy roadsters of the period did), and had an unusually-placed rear-mounted Buick Dynaflow automatic transmission. This was later changed to a GM Hydramatic. In addition to its jet inspired design, the 1951 Le Sabre also featured numerous advanced features, including a 12-volt electrical system (most cars of the period were 6-volt), heated seats, electric headlights concealed behind the center oval [...] "jet intake", front bumper dagmars (later made famous on 1957-9 Cadillacs), a water sensor to activate the power top, and electric <b>lifting</b> <b>jacks</b> integral to the chassis to aid tire changes.

60|$|The two {{children}} <b>lifted</b> <b>Jack's</b> body, {{which was not}} at all heavy, and placed it upon the saddle. Then they climbed up behind it and the Sawhorse immediately turned and trotted back along the path he had come, bearing all three with ease. However, when the path began to branch into many paths, all following different directions, the wooden animal became puzzled and soon was wandering aimlessly about, without any hope of finding the right way. Toward evening they came upon a fine fruit tree, which furnished the children a supper, and at night the little ones lay upon a bed of leaves while the Sawhorse stood watch, with the limp, headless form of poor Jack Pumpkinhead lying helpless across the saddle.|$|R
5000|$|Part of the Ford Fairlane 500 range, the Skyliner had {{a complex}} {{mechanism}} which folded {{the front of}} the roof and retracted it under the rear decklid. No hydraulic mechanisms were used as in regular convertibles of the era. The Skyliner top has seven reversible electric motors (only six for 1959 models [...] ), four <b>lift</b> <b>jacks,</b> a series of relays, ten limit switches, ten solenoids, four locking mechanisms for the roof and two locking mechanisms for the trunk lid, and a total of 610 ft of wiring. The large top took up vast amounts of trunk space, limiting the car's sales (however, unlike what most people believe, the mechanism had decent reliability). Production totaled 20,766 units in 1957, declining to 14,713 in 1958 and to 12,915 in 1959. An electric clock was standard. Fuel consumption was around 14 mpg overall. The fuel tank was placed vertically in back of the rear seat, which inadvertently added safety in rear collisions.|$|R
