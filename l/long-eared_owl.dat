5|$|Less {{powerful}} woodland owls such as {{the little}} owl and the <b>long-eared</b> <b>owl</b> cannot usually co-exist with the stronger tawny owls, which may take them as food items, and are found in different habitats; in Ireland {{the absence of the}} tawny owl allowed the <b>long-eared</b> <b>owl</b> to become the dominant owl. Similarly, where the tawny owl has moved into built-up areas, it tends to displace barn owls from their traditional nesting sites in buildings.|$|E
5|$|The {{tawny owl}} has a {{distribution}} stretching discontinuously across temperate Eurasia from Great Britain and the Iberian Peninsula eastwards to western Siberia. The subspecies S. a. mauritanica extends the range into northwest Africa. This essentially non-migratory owl is absent from Ireland (probably because of {{competition from the}} <b>long-eared</b> <b>owl),</b> and only a rare vagrant to the Balearic and Canary Islands.|$|E
5|$|Predators of {{the tree}} sparrow include a variety of accipiters, falcons and owls, such as the Eurasian sparrowhawk, common kestrel, little owl, and {{sometimes}} <b>long-eared</b> <b>owl</b> and white stork. It {{does not appear to}} be at an increased risk of predation during its autumn moult, despite having fewer flight feathers at that time. Nests may be raided by Eurasian magpies, jays, least weasels, rats, cats and constricting snakes such as the horseshoe whip snake.|$|E

5|$|A {{majority}} of starling predators are avian. The typical response of starling groups {{is to take}} flight, with a common sight being undulating flocks of starling flying high in quick and agile patterns. Their abilities in flight are seldom matched by birds of prey. Adult common starlings are hunted by hawks such as the northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) and Eurasian sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus), and falcons including the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), Eurasian hobby (Falco subbuteo) and common kestrel (Falco tinnunculus). Slower raptors like black and red kites (Milvus migrans & milvus), eastern imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca), common buzzard (Buteo buteo) and Australasian harrier (Circus approximans) tend to take the more easily caught fledglings or juveniles. While perched in groups by night, they can be vulnerable to owls, including the little owl (Athene noctua), <b>long-eared</b> <b>owl</b> (Asio otus), short-eared owl (Asio flammeus), barn owl (Tyto alba), tawny owl (Strix aluco) and Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo).|$|E

Red grouse, once common, are now {{extremely}} scarce. The species {{has been in}} decline for some decades. Threats include habitat degradation, disease, predation and over-hunting. Red grouse in Ireland are now considered threatened. The corncrake, also once very common, is now almost never seen. Smaller birds—such as crows, swallows, robins, wrens and so on—are very common. The first magpies in Ireland were recorded by Robert Leigh, of Rosegarland, County Wexford, as having appeared in the County of Wexford about 1676.|$|E
25|$|The Salmon Falls Creek {{watershed}} {{varies widely}} {{in terms of}} different habitats. Along the lower section of the creek, plentiful water flow and numerous springs create a rich riparian environment compared to an oasis, lined with coyote willow, dogwood, golden currant, cattail, mint and poison ivy. The upper section is a slow-moving waterway that supports a small wetland and extensive meadows. In contrast, {{the vast majority of}} the upper undeveloped watershed is a shrub-steppe sagebrush grassland, much of which is used for grazing. Many bird species use the Salmon Falls Creek canyon, including white-throated swift, canyon and rock wrens, cliff swallow, violet-green swallow, barn swallow, screech owl, <b>long-eared</b> <b>owl,</b> great horned owl, kestrel, red-tailed hawk, golden eagles and prairie falcon.

500|$|The most {{significant}} predators {{of the gray}} mouse lemur are the Madagascar <b>long-eared</b> <b>owl</b> and barn owl. [...] Studies conducted in Beza Mahafaly Reserve and Kirindy Mitea National Park indicate a predation rate of around 25% (percent population taken by predators per year), the highest known for any primate species. [...] However, given the species' high reproductive potential, predation {{does not appear to}} have a drastic effect on its populations. [...] Other raptors, such as Henst's goshawk and other owls, also prey upon this species. Snakes, such as Ithycyphus miniatus (a native colubrid snake) and the Madagascar tree boa, as well as mammalian predators, such as the ring-tailed mongoose, narrow-striped mongoose, fossa, and domestic dogs are also known to prey on the gray mouse lemur. [...] Mammalian predators often discover tree holes serving as nests, and enlarge the opening so they can catch and eat the occupant. This puts strong selective pressure on the choice of nest hole opening diameter and deepness.|$|E
2500|$|Equally or {{even more}} so than the great horned owl, the Eurasian eagle-owl is a threat to any smaller type of raptor it encounters, whether other owls or diurnal birds of prey. All told, more than 20 species of accipitrid, 15 species of owl and 9 species of falcon have been found amongst their prey. The Eurasian eagle-owl is the primary {{predator}} of other birds of prey throughout Eurasia, not even the prolific raptor-killing northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) equals the sheer number of raptors taken. Up to 6% of the overall food by number and 36% by prey biomass for Eurasian eagle-owls can be comprised by other raptorial birds. The primary raptorial prey taken by Eurasian eagle-owls in Europe are two species: the [...] <b>long-eared</b> <b>owl</b> and the [...] common buzzard. Both are taken in such large numbers that they rank in the top five most regularly hunted bird species in Europe. In Luxembourg, the <b>long-eared</b> <b>owl</b> and common buzzard were the fourth and fifth most regularly hunted prey species. Other high rankings have included the <b>long-eared</b> <b>owl</b> being the fourth most regular prey species in Bavaria and the buzzard being the third most regular prey species in a study from the Czech Republic. While migrating, long-eared owls appear to select areas to move through partially based on whether or not eagle-owls are detected, thus eagle-owls have a very serious influence on the behaviour of this prey. Despite the large numbers taken of both of these, the more scarce eagle-owl {{does not seem to have}} a serious deleterious effect on their overall population, especially compared to anthropogenic factors.|$|E

2500|$|Meadow voles are an {{important}} prey for many hawks, owls, and mammalian carnivores, and they are also taken by some snakes. [...] Almost all species of raptors take microtine (Microtus spp.) rodents as prey. Birds not usually considered predators of mice do take voles; examples include gulls (Larus spp.), northern shrike (Larius borealis), black-billed magpie (Pica pica), common raven (Corvus corax), American crow (C. brachyrhynchos), great blue heron (Ardea herodias), and American bittern (Botaurus lentiginosus). In Ohio, meadow voles comprised 90% of the individual prey remains in <b>long-eared</b> <b>owl</b> (Asio otus) pellets on a relict wet prairie, and in Wisconsin, meadow voles comprised 95% of short-eared owl (A. flammeus) prey. [...] Most mammalian predators take microtine prey. The American short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda) is major predator; meadow voles avoid areas frequented by short-tailed shrews.

60|$|This {{incident}} {{serves to}} remind me of an experience I had one evening in King's Copse, an immense wood of oak and pine in the New Forest near Exbury. It was growing dark when I heard on or close to the ground, some twenty to thirty yards before me, a low, wailing cry, resembling the hunger-cry of the young, <b>long-eared</b> <b>owl.</b> I began cautiously advancing, trying to see it, but as I advanced the cry receded, as if the bird was flitting from me. Now, just after I had begun following the sound, a fox uttered his sudden, startlingly loud scream about forty yards away on my right hand, and the next moment a second fox screamed on my left, and from that time I was accompanied, or shadowed, by the two foxes, always keeping abreast of me, always at the same distance, one screaming and the other replying about every half-minute. The distressful bird-sound ceased, and I turned and went off in another direction, {{to get out of the}} wood on the side nearest the place where I was staying, the foxes keeping with me until I was out.|$|E
60|$|One summer {{there was}} a great drought, and the rooks, unable to get their usual food from the hard, sun-baked pasture-lands, {{attacked}} the roots and would have pretty well destroyed them if the farmer had not protected his swedes by driving in stakes and running cotton-thread and twine from stake to stake all over the field. This kept them off, just as thread keeps the chaffinches from the seed-beds in small gardens, and as it keeps the sparrows from the crocuses on lawn and ornamental grounds. One day Caleb caught sight of an odd-looking, brownish-grey object {{out in the middle of}} the turnip-field, and as he looked it rose up two or three feet into the air, then dropped back again, and this curious movement was repeated at intervals of two or three minutes until he went to see what the thing was. It turned out to be a <b>long-eared</b> <b>owl,</b> with its foot accidentally caught by a slack thread, which allowed the bird to rise a couple of feet into the air; but every such attempt to escape ended in its being pulled back to the ground again. It was so excessively lean, so weightless in his hand, when he took it up after disengaging its foot, that he thought it must have been captive for the space of two or three days. The wonder was that it had kept alive during those long midsummer days of intolerable heat out there in the middle of the burning field. Yet it was in very fine feather and beautiful to look at with its long, black ear-tufts and round, orange-yellow eyes, which would never lose their fiery lustre until glazed in death. Caleb's first thought on seeing it closely was that it would have been a prize to anyone who liked to have a handsome bird stuffed in a glass case. Then raising it over his head he allowed it to fly, whereupon it flew off a distance of a dozen or fifteen yards and pitched among the turnips, after which it ran a little space and rose again with labour, but soon recovering strength it flew away over the field and finally disappeared in the deep shade of the copse beyond.|$|E
