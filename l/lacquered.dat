5|$|For {{protection}} and preservation, a polished Japanese sword needs a scabbard. A fully mounted scabbard (koshirae) may {{consist of a}} <b>lacquered</b> body, a taped hilt, a sword guard (tsuba) and decorative metal fittings. Though the original purpose was to protect a sword from damage, from early times on Japanese sword mountings became a status symbol and were used to add dignity. Starting in the Heian period, a sharp distinction was made between swords designed for use in battle and those for ceremonial use. Tachi long swords were worn edge down suspended by two cords or chains from the waist belt. The cords were attached to two eyelets on the scabbard.|$|E
5|$|Liubo: The {{now defunct}} board game liubo {{for the most}} part remains an enigma for modern {{scholars}} still deciphering exactly how it was played; its association with both gambling and divination make it a unique game. The earliest two liubo game boards are found in the Zhongshan Tomb 3 at Shijiazhuang, Hebei. Similar finds, dating from the mid 4th century BC, are also found in the Chu Tomb 197 and 314 at Jiangling, Hubei. Liubo game boards have been found in several Western Han (202 BC– 9 AD) tombs; 1 wooden board at Jiangdu in Jiangsu; 1 wooden board in Tomb 8 at Fenghuangshan in Hubei; 1 <b>lacquered</b> set of liubo in Tomb 3 at Mawangdui Han tombs site in Hunan; 1 <b>lacquered</b> board in Tomb 1 at Dafentou in Yunnan; 1 bronze board at Xilin in Guangxi. During the Han Dynasty, an argument over the divination portents of the game {{as a result of a}} playing session led to a fight between a Western Han crown prince and Liu Xian (劉賢), where the latter was killed in the scuffle which (in part) prompted his father Liu Pi (劉濞), the King of Wu, to rebel against central Han authority in the Rebellion of the Seven States (154 BC). The British sinologist and historian Michael Loewe asserts that the set pieces of liubo were symbolic of the forces of the Chinese Five Elements, wu xing.|$|E

5|$|Saddles {{were made}} of wood and were {{designed}} as a standing platform for archers. They were not suited for riding long distances or at high speed. Early saddles of the Nara period were of Chinese style karagura and later modified for local tastes, resulting in Japanese style saddles from the Heian period onward. Artisans and carpenters {{became involved in the}} saddle production as saddles became more elaborate in the Kamakura period, with decorations in mother of pearl inlay, gold leaf and multiple coats of lacquer. Saddles ceased to be primarily utilitarian, instead serving as adornment showing the owner's status in processions. Three Japanese style <b>lacquered</b> wooden saddles and a complete set of a Chinese style ritual saddle, dating to the late Heian and Kamakura periods, have been designated as National Treasures.|$|E
5|$|The 14-story Centurion Tower was {{completed}} in 1970 {{at a cost of}} $4.2 million. In 2011 it was announced that the tower would be renovated and be renamed to Nobu, and to operate as the first Nobu Hotel with a restaurant. The concept was that the tower was to be a boutique hotel within the resort. Because the exterior was unchanged, the interior with only 181 rooms, small by Vegas standards, is more spacious with bigger rooms than the standard hotel. The motif is Asian luxury with high end amenities, including a sake bar and strict security which uses optical scanners. Each room has a sitting area, a spacious bedroom with black <b>lacquered</b> furniture and artworks. The bathroom contains a double-sized stall with a teak shower stall, black tiles and a large rain-style showerhead.|$|E
5|$|Armour {{has been}} {{employed}} in battles in Japan since the Yayoi period. Some {{of the oldest}} extant items from the 4th to the 7th centuries were excavated from kofun and have been designated as archaeological National Treasures. These ancient armours were of two types: a tight fitting solid plate cuirass (tankō) and a skirted lamellar type (keikō), both believed {{to be based on}} Chinese or Korean prototypes. This list includes more recent pieces of armour, developed as result of a trend toward (lamellar) scale armour that began in Japan in the 6th to the 7th centuries and matured in the mid-Heian period (9th to 10th centuries). Combining materials such as leather and silk with iron or steel parts, these armours had the advantage of being light, flexible, foldable and shock absorbent. They were generally <b>lacquered</b> to protect them from the humid climate and were used widely from the late Heian period to the mid-14th century. A complete set consisted of a helmet, mask, neck guard, throat protector, breastplate with shoulder guards, sleeve armour, skirt, greaves, shoes and a pennant attached to the back.|$|E
50|$|The word <b>lacquer</b> {{is derived}} from lac (Sanskrit: lākshā, लाक्षा), a {{resinous}} substance obtained from lac insects that was once used as a <b>lacquer.</b> The best known <b>lacquer,</b> an urushiol-based <b>lacquer</b> common in East Asia, {{is derived from}} the dried sap of Toxicodendron vernicifluum. Other types of <b>lacquers</b> are processed from a variety of plants and insects.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to health}} risks and {{environmental}} considerations {{involved in the}} use of solvent-based <b>lacquers,</b> much work has gone into the development of water-based <b>lacquers.</b> Such <b>lacquers</b> are considerably less toxic and more environmentally friendly, and in many cases, produce acceptable results. While water-based <b>lacquer's</b> fumes are considerably less hazardous, and it does not have the combustibility issues of solvent based <b>lacquers,</b> the product still dries fairly quickly. Even though its odor is weaker, water-based <b>lacquer</b> can still produce airborne particulates that can get into the lungs, so proper protective wear still needs to be worn. More and more water-based colored <b>lacquers</b> are replacing solvent-based clear and colored <b>lacquers</b> in under hood and interior applications in the automobile and other similar industrial applications. Water based <b>lacquers</b> are used extensively in wood furniture finishing as well.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to inventing {{the form of}} urushi-e, painting with <b>lacquer,</b> Zeshin also experimented greatly with the technical elements of using <b>lacquer.</b> He mixed his <b>lacquers</b> {{with a variety of}} substances to achieve different colors and textures, and to control the consistency and flexibility of the <b>lacquer.</b> He mixed certain substances with the <b>lacquer</b> to ensure it would not crack when his urushi-e scroll paintings were rolled up. He used bronze in his <b>lacquer</b> to simulate the appearance and texture of iron, and cereal starch to thicken his <b>lacquer</b> to simulate, at least in some respects, the effect of Western oil painting.|$|R
5|$|Naval mine: The Huolongjing {{military}} manuscript {{written by}} Ming dynasty military writer Jiao Yu (fl. 14th to early 15th century) and Liu Bowen (1311–1375) also describes naval mines used at sea or on rivers and lakes; made of wrought iron and enclosed in an ox bladder, {{it was a}} timed device in that a burning joss sticks floating above the mine determined when the fuse was to be ignited; the text explicitly mentions that without air and doused in water the fuse would not burn, so the fuse was protected by a long waterproof tube made out of goat's intestine; a later model shown in Ming Chinese scientist and encyclopedist Song Yingxing's (1587–1666) encyclopedia of 1637 shows the ox bladder replaced with a <b>lacquered</b> leather bag while the mine is ignited by a rip cord pulled from the shore to rotate a flint-and-steel firing mechanism.|$|E
5|$|Through use of {{the land}} trade along the Silk Road and {{maritime}} trade by sail at sea, the Tang were able to gain many new technologies, cultural practices, rare luxury, and contemporary items. From the Middle East, India, Persia, and Central Asia the Tang were able to acquire new ideas in fashion, new types of ceramics, and improved silver-smithing. The Chinese also gradually adopted the foreign concept of stools and chairs as seating, whereas the Chinese beforehand always sat on mats placed on the floor. To the Middle East, the Islamic world coveted and purchased in bulk Chinese goods such as silks, lacquerwares, and porcelain wares. Songs, dances, and musical instruments from foreign regions became popular in China during the Tang dynasty. These musical instruments included oboes, flutes, and small <b>lacquered</b> drums from Kucha in the Tarim Basin, and percussion instruments from India such as cymbals. At the court there were nine musical ensembles (expanded from seven in the Sui dynasty) representing music from throughout Asia.|$|E

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{investigates the}} problematic of indoor air pollution. There were tested low emitting types of <b>lacquers</b> – UV and waterborne <b>lacquers.</b> The {{work has been}} splitted in to two parts. In the first part samples of <b>lacquers</b> were applied on the particle board with beech veneer on the surface. Samples of air with VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds) from <b>lacquers</b> were taken 3 and 24 hours after application. Tests proved that film layer of UV <b>lacquer</b> emit much smaller volumes of VOCs than acrylic waterborne <b>lacquers</b> or than 2 –component epoxide waterborne <b>lacquer.</b> Acrylic waterborne lacquers’ materials emitted especially butoxyethylene, epoxide <b>lacquer</b> emitted a lot of butoxyethanol and methoxypropanol and UV <b>lacquers</b> particularly emitted toluene, benzene and xylene. Se­cond part of testing consists of VOCs’ measuring of chosen <b>lacquers</b> applied on different base materials – inertial material glass and particle board with beech veneer. Tested criterion was the impact of different base material on emitted amount of VOCs. The results showed that <b>lacquer</b> coated on glass emit much more chemicals than <b>lacquer</b> on wood material. All materials were also tested on total amount of organic compounds emitted in to the air – on the TVOC. Measuring showed the same results as the first parts of research...|$|R
40|$|UV-cured (ultra violet), {{water-based}} and epoxyphenolic <b>lacquers</b> {{have been}} characterized as coatings for possible application in vegetable canning industry. These <b>lacquers</b> {{were applied to}} three different types of tinplates and tin free steel (TFS). The behaviour of <b>lacquers</b> was monitored applying porosity, flexibility and infrared (IR) reflectance spectroscopy tests. With IR reflectance spectroscopy test, {{we were able to}} determine the composition of <b>lacquers.</b> Using porosity and flexibility tests, performed by electrochemical methods, it was possible to characterize the best <b>lacquer</b> for food canning. In this work the variables involved in <b>lacquering,</b> e. g. the weight of coating and the degree of polymerization of <b>lacquers</b> were also taken into account...|$|R
25|$|Design motifs {{can vary}} from purely {{indigenous}} to mostly European with some other elements thrown in. Geometric designs are prevalent and the most directly connected to Mexico’s pre-Hispanic past and/or items made by the country’s remaining purely indigenous communities. Motifs from nature are as popular, if not more so, than geometric patterns in both pre-Hispanic and European-influenced designs. They are especially prevalent in wall-hangings and ceramics. Mexican artesanía also shows influence from cultures other than European. Puebla’s famous Talavera pottery {{is a mix of}} Chinese, Arab, Spanish and indigenous design influences. <b>Lacquered</b> furniture was unknown in Mexico until the Manila galleons brought <b>lacquered</b> wood products here, which local craftsmen copied.|$|E
25|$|Laca is {{the making}} of wooden items which are then painted and coated with a {{high-gloss}} lacquer. The best pieces of this type are made of a wood called linalóe (Bursera aloexylon) which is aromatic. Cheaper ones are made of pine, treated to smell like linalóe. The making of <b>lacquered</b> items is centered in the municipality of Olinalá, but also {{can be found in}} Temalcalcingo, Ocotepec and Acapetlahuaya. Olinalá’s <b>lacquered</b> items are traditional made with a wood called linaloe, with has a distinctive odor, but due to its relatively scarcity, pine is also being used.

50|$|The word <b>lacquer</b> {{refers to}} quick-drying, {{solvent-based}} varnishes or paints. Although their names may be similarly derived, <b>lacquer</b> {{is not the}} same as shellac and is not dissolved in alcohol. <b>Lacquer</b> is dissolved in <b>lacquer</b> thinner, which is a highly flammable solvent typically containing butyl acetate and xylene or toluene. <b>Lacquer</b> is typically sprayed on, within a spray booth that evacuates overspray and minimizes the risk of combustion.|$|R
50|$|These <b>lacquers</b> {{are also}} used on wooden products, {{furniture}} primarily, and on musical instruments and other objects. Nitrocellulose <b>lacquers</b> {{are also used}} to make firework fuses waterproof. The nitrocellulose and other resins and plasticizers are dissolved in the solvent, and each coat of <b>lacquer</b> dissolves some of the previous coat. These <b>lacquers</b> were a huge improvement over earlier automobile and furniture finishes, both in ease of application and in colour retention. The preferred method of applying quick-drying <b>lacquers</b> is by spraying, {{and the development of}} nitrocellulose <b>lacquers</b> led to the first extensive use of spray guns. Nitrocellulose <b>lacquers</b> produce a hard yet flexible, durable finish that can be polished to a high sheen. Drawbacks of these <b>lacquers</b> include the hazardous nature of the solvent, which is flammable and toxic, and the hazards of nitrocellulose in the manufacturing process. <b>Lacquer</b> grade of soluble nitrocellulose is closely related to the more highly nitrated form which is used to make explosives. They become relatively non-toxic after approximately a month since at this point, the <b>lacquer</b> has evaporated most of the solvents used in its production.|$|R
50|$|After metalisation, the discs {{pass on to}} a spin-coater, where UV curable <b>lacquer</b> is {{dispensed}} {{onto the}} newly metallized layer. By rapid spinning, the <b>lacquer</b> coats the entire disc with a very thin layer (approx. 70 nm). After the <b>lacquer</b> is applied, the disks pass under a high intensity UV lamp which cures the <b>lacquer</b> rapidly. The <b>lacquer</b> also provides a surface for a label, generally screen printed or offset printed. The printing ink(s) must be chemically compatible with the <b>lacquer</b> used. Markers used by consumers to write on blank surfaces can lead to breaks in the protective <b>lacquer</b> layer, which may lead to corrosion of the reflective layer, and failure of the CD.|$|R

40|$|The lustre and {{luminous}} qualities {{inherent in}} <b>lacquer</b> objects {{speak of a}} revered historic technology chronicled by remarkable achievements. Sophisticated <b>lacquer</b> objects from East Asia and Vietnam are products of the integrated histories, technologies, and cultural expressions of these territories. The application of <b>lacquer</b> as a decorative medium originally developed in China. Through exchange and trade, the material was transmitted to neighbouring countries where each region explored the material and developed distinctive styles and techniques. Although <b>lacquer</b> from East Asia and Vietnam share similar material natures, the cultural attributes of <b>lacquer,</b> it's aesthetics, design, form, and symbolism provide for marked distinctions across the zone. Vietnamese <b>lacquer</b> contributes surface techniques and motifs to the <b>lacquer</b> repertoire. The aim {{of this research is}} to investigate the materiality and processes of Vietnamese <b>lacquer</b> as a surface ornamentation integral to the design and making of objects. The published material is dominated by descriptions of the aesthetic achievements of <b>lacquer</b> objects with little coverage of the technology, techniques, and practices employed. There is a scarcity of contemporary research on Vietnamese <b>lacquering</b> processes written in the English language. This research was fuelled by a research field trip to Vietnam during 2004 workil, 1 g with Vietnamese <b>lacquer</b> artists on traditional <b>lacquering</b> techniques. During a residency at Hue the <b>lacquer</b> working processes were observed, documented and techniques sampled. This traineeship incorporated the preparation of traditional tools, of the substrate, and the application of <b>lacquer</b> painting techniques. Preparatory samples and templates were made in Australia for later experimentation in Vietnam. These samples were treated with <b>lacquer</b> and illustrate the possible exploration of Vietnamese <b>lacquering</b> techniques in a contemporary context. The research is a material investigation of traditional Vietnamese <b>lacquering</b> processes applied to jewellery and object making. The studio practice aims to reinterpret the traditional material language of <b>lacquer</b> by allying it with contemporary methods and techniques. This synthesis combining traditional art methods and digital technology is expressed as a series of objects inspired by floral motifs. The seasonal floral images are significant, evoking concepts of creation and renewal. The interpretation of these graphic florals provides a contemporary representation, aesthetic, and cultural reading for the material, maker, and motif...|$|R

50|$|Diluents (or thinners) {{are usually}} added to <b>lacquers</b> {{to reduce their}} {{viscosity}} (they are used to adjust the rheology).
