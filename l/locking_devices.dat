Both beams are fitted with ratchets or similar <b>locking</b> <b>devices.</b> Once a section of the carpet is completed, is rolled on to the lower beam. On a roller beam loom, any length of carpet can be produced. In some areas of Turkey several rugs are woven in series on the same warps, and separated from each other by cutting the warps after the weaving is finished.|$|E
25|$|The {{two most}} common {{factory-installed}} locking differentials use either a computer-controlled multi-plate clutch or viscous coupling unit {{to join the}} shafts, while other differentials more commonly used on off-road vehicles generally use manually operated <b>locking</b> <b>devices.</b> In the multi-plate clutch the vehicle's computer senses slippage and locks the shafts, causing a small jolt when it activates, which can disturb the driver or cause additional traction loss. In the viscous coupling differentials the shear stress of high shaft speed differences causes a dilatant fluid in the differential to become solid, linking the two shafts. This design suffers from fluid degradation with age and from exponential locking behavior. Some designs use gearing to create a small rotational difference that hastens torque transfer.|$|E
500|$|When the Bureau of Prisons {{took over}} the area to {{establish}} the Alcatraz Island Federal Penitentiary on January 1, 1934, it {{marked the beginning of}} a series of measures to strengthen the security of the prison cells to make Alcatraz an [...] "escape-proof" [...] maximum security prison, and also improving the living conditions for the operation and maintenance staff and officers, apart from the prisoners. Modern technological innovations available at the time for enhancing security and comfort were built into the buildings. Security guard towers were built outside at four strategic locations, cells were rebuilt and fitted with [...] "tool-proof steel cell fronts and <b>locking</b> <b>devices</b> operated from control boxes", and windows were made secure with iron grills. Electromagnetic metal detectors placed in the entrance of the dining hall and workshops, with remote controlled tear gas canisters at appropriate locations, remote controlled gun galleries with machine gun armed guards were installed to patrol along the corridors. Improvements were made to the toilet and electricity facilities, old tunnels were sealed up with concrete to avoid hiding and escape by prisoners, and substantial changes and improvements were made to the housing facilities of guards, wardens and Captain to live with their families, with quality relative to rank. Warden Johnston, U.S. Attorney General Homer Cummings, and Sanford Bates first Director of the Bureau of Prisons, collaborated very closely to create [...] "a legendary prison" [...] suited to the times, which resulted in the Alcatraz Island Federal Penitentiary being nicknamed [...] "Uncle Sam's Devil's Island." ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a {{new kind}} of <b>locking</b> <b>device</b> is introduced. Aiming at the 1 # {{centrifuge}} of CAEP(China Academy of Engineering Physics), the mechanical design of <b>locking</b> <b>device</b> has been done, and its maximum locking torque is 8000 N·M. The simulation model has been established in ANSYS to obtain key parameters of the <b>locking</b> <b>device,</b> such as the thickness of shaft, the distribution of circular groove, the working pressure of oil source and so on. Through the test, the feasibility of the <b>locking</b> <b>device</b> is validated. Introduction[1, 2] Generally used <b>locking</b> <b>device</b> includes key connection, interference connection and so on. For these devices, many disadvantages are included such as inconvenient assembly, difficult processing and so on. At present, the nacelle of the 1 # centrifuge is locked with bolts, and the nacelle can only be locked in several special angles. Therefore, it’s not able to meet the requirement of acceleratio...|$|R

500|$|After the U.S. Army's use of {{the island}} for over 80 years (1850–1933), the island came under the {{jurisdiction}} of the U.S. Department of Justice for use by the Federal Bureau of Prisons. The purpose of this transfer was to punish those involved in the rampant crime which prevailed in the country in the 1920s and 1930s. The United States Disciplinary Barracks on Alcatraz was acquired by the United States Department of Justice on October 12, 1933, and the island became a Federal Bureau of Prisons federal prison in August 1934. The $260,000 conversion to the federal prison took place from January 1934. George Hess of the United States Public Health Service was appointed the chief medical officer of the prison and Edward W. Twitchell became a consultant in psychiatry for Alcatraz in January 1934. The hospital facilities were checked by three officials from the Marine Hospital of San Francisco. The Bureau of Prisons personnel arrived on Alcatraz in early February; among them was Loring O. Mills, acting chief clerk. In April 1934, the old material was removed from the prison, holes were cut in the concrete and 269 cell fronts were installed, built using four carloads of steel ordered from the Stewart Iron Works. A legend at the works is that a shipment of cells and iron accidentally fell into San Francisco Bay during transportation from San Francisco Dock to Alcatraz and were never recovered, and thus had to be reordered. Two of four new stairways were built, as were 12 doors to the utility corridors and gratings at the top of the cells. On April 26, an accidental small fire broke out on the roof and an electrician injured his foot by dropping a manhole cover on it. Fencing around Alcatraz was added by the Anchor Post Fence Company and emergency lighting in the morgue and switchboard operations were added by the Enterprise Electric Works. In June 1934, the Teletouch Corporation of New York began the installation of an [...] "electro-magnetic gun or metal detecting system" [...] at Alcatraz; detectors were added on the wharf, at the front entrance into the cellblock, and at the rear entrance gate. The correctional officers were instructed how to operate the new <b>locking</b> <b>devices</b> on July 30, 1934, and the new radio equipment was tested by both the United States Coast Guard and the San Francisco Police Department on the same day. Final checks and assessments were made on the first two days of August.|$|E
2500|$|The cell had two access points: a {{hinged door}} that weighed 500kg (1,100lb) which {{is thought to}} have become {{unusable}} over the years because of its weight, and a metal door, reinforced with concrete and on steel rails that weighed 300kg (650lb) and measured [...] high and [...] wide. It was located behind a shelf in Fritzl's basement workshop, protected by an electronic code entered using a remote control unit. In order to reach this door, five locking basement rooms had to be crossed. To get to the area where Elisabeth and her children were held, eight doors in total needed to be unlocked, of which two doors were additionally secured by electronic <b>locking</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|E

5000|$|An {{electromagnetic}} lock, magnetic lock, or maglock is a {{locking device}} {{that consists of}} an electromagnet and an armature plate. There are two main types of electric <b>locking</b> <b>devices.</b> <b>Locking</b> <b>devices</b> can be either [...] "fail safe" [...] or [...] "fail secure". A fail-secure locking device remains locked when power is lost. Fail-safe <b>locking</b> <b>devices</b> are unlocked when de-energized. Direct pull electromagnetic locks are inherently fail-safe. Typically the electromagnet portion of the lock {{is attached to the}} door frame and a mating armature plate is attached to the door. The two components are in contact when the door is closed. When the electromagnet is energized, a current passing through the electromagnet creates a magnetic flux that causes the armature plate to attract to the electromagnet, creating a locking action. Because the mating area of the electromagnet and armature is relatively large, the force created by the magnetic flux is strong enough to keep the door locked even under stress.|$|E

40|$|The {{dimensioning}} of the <b>locking</b> <b>device</b> of {{a switch}} is made essentially {{as a function}} of the applied loads during the switch rails movement or considering a false route. The phenomena related to the vibrations induced by the track are therefore normally not taken into account. Such vibrations are particularly accentuated by the ballast bed deconsolidation in the sleeper panel supporting the <b>locking</b> <b>device.</b> Unfortunately, there is no specific technical reference in order to control these aspects, even though the most frequent cause of <b>locking</b> <b>device</b> components failures is relied to the vertical oscillations induced by the trains, rather than to the effort to commute the switch rails. In this study, the results of a field investigation carried out at two levels of ballast tamping are reported and discussed. It is found that the ballast compaction plays a fundamental role for the component to be prone to the early attainment of critical mechanical conditions. Procedures for the monitoring of the stability and efficiency of the ballast bed to ensure the required reliability of the <b>locking</b> <b>device</b> are also envisaged...|$|R
