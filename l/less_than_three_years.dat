5|$|In 1974, Led Zeppelin took a {{break from}} touring and {{launched}} their own record label, Swan Song, named after an unreleased song. The record label's logo, based on a drawing called Evening: Fall of Day (1869) by William Rimmer, features a picture of Apollo. The logo {{can be found on}} Led Zeppelin memorabilia, especially T-shirts. In addition to using Swan Song as a vehicle to promote their own albums, the band expanded the label's roster, signing artists such as Bad Company, the Pretty Things and Maggie Bell. The label was successful while Led Zeppelin existed, but folded <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> after they disbanded.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his deformities, {{at some point during}} his childhood, Merrick suffered a fall and damaged his left hip. This injury became infected and left him permanently lame. Although affected by his physical deformities, Merrick attended school and enjoyed a close relationship with his mother. She was a Sunday school teacher, and his father worked as an engine driver at a cotton factory, as well as running a haberdashery business. On 29 May 1873, <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> after the death of her youngest son William, Mary Jane Merrick died from bronchopneumonia. Joseph Rockley Merrick moved with his two children to live with Mrs. Emma Wood Antill, a widow with children of her own. They married on 3 December 1874.|$|E

5|$|The {{father was}} {{eventually}} fired by his Russian supervisors for pro-Polish sentiments, {{and forced to}} take lower-paying posts; the family also lost money on a bad investment, and eventually chose to supplement their income by lodging boys in the house. Maria's mother Bronisława operated a prestigious Warsaw boarding school for girls; she resigned from the position after Maria was born. She died of tuberculosis in May 1878, when Maria was ten years old. <b>Less</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> earlier, Maria's oldest sibling, Zofia, had died of typhus contracted from a boarder. Maria's father was an atheist; her mother a devout Catholic. The deaths of Maria's mother and sister caused her to give up Catholicism and become agnostic.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} ovoviviparous, with females {{giving birth to}} one to 16 live young and {{possibly}} as many as 20. However, litters of six to eight are the most common. Neonates are 22–35cm in length (excluding runts), with the largest being A. p. conanti and A. p. leucostoma the smallest. If weather conditions are favorable and food is readily available, growth is rapid and females may reproduce at <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> of age and a total length of as little as 60cm. The young are born in August or September, while mating may occur during any of the warmer months of the year, at least {{in certain parts of}} its range.|$|E
5|$|Władysław's {{mother died}} on 10 February 1598, <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> {{after giving birth}} to him. He was raised by one of her former ladies of the court, Urszula Meierin, who {{eventually}} became a powerful player at the royal court, with much influence. Władysław's Hofmeister was Michał Konarski, a Polish-Prussian noble. Around early 17th century Urszula lost much of her influence, as Władysław gained new teachers and mentors, such as priests Gabriel Prowancjusz, Andrzej Szołdrski and Marek Łętkowski, and in the military matters, Zygmunt Kazanowski. Much of his curriculum was likely designed by priest Piotr Skarga, much respected by Sigmismund III. Władysław studied for several years in the Kraków Academy, and for two years, in Rome.|$|E

5|$|Although not a {{director}} or significant shareholder {{of the new}} company, Pearson continued to promote the project {{over the next few}} years and use his influence to help the company raise the £1 million of capital needed for the construction of the line. He issued a pamphlet, A twenty minutes letter to the citizens of London, in favour of the Metropolitan Railway and City Station, encouraging investment and he even persuaded the City of London to invest on the basis that the railway would alleviate the City's congestion problems. Once the railway was in operation, the City sold its shares at a profit. By 1860, the funds had been collected and the final route decided. Work on the railway started; taking <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> to excavate through some of the worst slums of Victorian London and under some of the busiest streets.|$|E
5|$|During Dunderdale's {{tenure as}} premier the Fisheries {{portfolio}} {{has seen a}} significant overturn at the ministerial level. In <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> Dunderdale had appointed her fourth Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture. Keith Hutchings became that fourth minister after his appointment on October 9, 2013. Following his appointment a representative with the Fish, Food and Allied Workers union said he hoped to see the minister stay in his portfolio {{for a longer period}} of time, as he was the seventh minister in the portfolio in ten years. Dunderdale's first Fisheries minister was Clyde Jackman, who had been the minister when Dunderdale succeeded Williams as premier. Jackman remained minister until after the 2011 provincial election, when Darin King took over the portfolio. Eleven months later King was succeeded by Derrick Dalley who was minister for the next year. Opposition parties criticized government after Hutchings appointment saying the overturn in ministers showed that there was no plan for the fishery.|$|E
5|$|Eutharic died in 522 {{at the age}} of 42, <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> {{after his}} consulship. His death caused {{problems}} for Theoderic who never succeeded in his desire to establish a strong Gothic dynasty. Though Eutharic and Amalasuintha had a son, Athalaric born in 516, and a daughter, Matasuntha, the dynasty was never established convincingly. Theoderic named Athalaric as his heir in 526, and Athalaric's mother Amalasuintha acted as regent for her son following Theoderic's death that year. Athalaric died in October 534 {{at the age of}} 18. To maintain her power, Amalasuintha brought her cousin, and a nephew of Theoderic, named Theodahad to the throne. Though he was made to swear fealty to Amalasuintha, Theodahad felt insecure and in December 534 had her imprisoned on an island in Lake Bolsena where she was eventually murdered on 30 April 535.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Imbudo was {{the strongest}} typhoon to strike Luzon since Typhoon Zeb five years prior, and was the fifth storm in eight weeks to affect the country. The typhoon left {{widespread}} areas flooded for several days. Cagayan Valley was largely isolated after a bridge was damaged in Ilocos Norte. Damage was heavy in the region, totaling P2.2billion (PHP, $40million USD), and over 80,000people were displaced by the storm. Damage was heaviest in Isabela, where damage was estimated at P1.9billion (PHP, $35million USD), mostly to crops and killed livestock. There, winds and rain knocked down trees and caused a province-wide power outage. Most trees <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> old fell during the high winds. In Isabela province, the banana crop was almost entirely destroyed, {{and most of the}} corn and rice crops were heavily damaged. The high damage caused the gross regional product, or overall economy of the Cagayan Valley, to decrease by 0.3% than what would have happened without the typhoon.|$|E
5|$|Jackson's Weta Digital {{created the}} visual effects, which {{included}} computer-generated imagery, {{as well as}} scale models (which were necessary to make Wellington look American), prosthetic makeup and practical effects with help from Weta Workshop. Visual effects supervisor Richard Taylor explained that effects work on The Frighteners was complex due to Weta's inexperience with computer technology in the mid-1990s. Prior to this film, Weta worked largely with physical effects. With so many ghosts among its main cast, The Frighteners required more digital effects shots than almost any movie made up till that time. For a special effects company {{that had been in}} existence <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>years,</b> the eighteen-month period for completing The Frighteners was largely stressful. Some shots were handled by a small New Zealand company called Pixel Perfect, many of whose employees would eventually join Weta Digital. Rick Baker was hired to design the prosthetic makeup for The Judge, portrayed by John Astin (the detachable jawbone was later added digitally). However, Baker was not able to apply Astin's five hours of makeup himself due to his commitment on The Nutty Professor. Makeup artist Brian Penikas (Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) fulfilled Baker's duties.|$|E
5|$|The {{flagship}} Bonwit Teller store {{remained as}} one of Trump Tower's retail offerings until March 1990, when Bonwit Teller's parent company declared bankruptcy and closed the Trump Tower location. In July of that year, Galeries Lafayette {{announced that it would}} sign a 25-year lease to move into the space previously occupied by Bonwit Teller, a move that expanded Galeries Lafayette's business to the United States while helping Trump pay off the debts incurred by the tower's construction and operation. The new store opened in September 1991 after a $13.7 million renovation, but was unprofitable upon opening, losing a net $3.6 million in the first year alone because it had only made $8.4 million in sales. Galeries Lafayette announced that it would be closing the Trump Tower location in August 1994, <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> after it opened, due to an inability to pay off the $8 million annual rent and taxes. However, critics cited other factors, including the decision to not include merchandise from top French designers as the company's French locations had done.|$|E

25|$|Like {{the other}} Canary Islands, and {{volcanic}} ocean islands in general, Tenerife {{was built by}} accretion of three large shield volcanoes, which developed {{in a relatively short}} period. This early shield stage volcanism formed the bulk of the emerged part of Tenerife.

50|$|The castle at Sully was the {{smallest}} in Glamorgan {{by a very}} long way. It covered a site of only about half an acre and stood in a location that was, until only recently, called Castle Wood. Occupation of the castle lasted <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> hundred <b>years</b> till around the mid 14th century, probably {{as a result of}} the extinction of the de Sully family line. The present church dates from around the same time as the castle and is dedicated to St. John the Baptist. The resident Sully clergyman has always been referred to as the Rector which indicates the tithes that produced his annual income were never appropriated by a monastery and he was therefore probably supported by the Lord of the Manor directly, although appointed by the Bishop.|$|R
50|$|These carvings are {{reputed to}} perhaps {{originate}} from Celtic fertility symbology. The concentric circular {{lines of the}} carvings {{could be interpreted as}} the 'tree of life?' As we cannot possibly know, this is a matter for further interpretation.Rock carvings discovered in 1948 are believed by some to be from the early Bronze Age (1800-1400 BC). The two carvings take the form of circular labyrinths. Modern scholars believe that, as the labyrinths were carved on a quarried wall with a metal tool, {{they are likely to be}} <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>three</b> hundred <b>years</b> old. In 2005 it was claimed that another carving can be seen, much fainter than the first two, leading to speculation that the two well-defined carvings are copies of ones that are much earlier: this has yet to be proved.|$|R
