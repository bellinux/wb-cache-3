5000|$|The {{log phase}} (sometimes called the <b>logarithmic</b> <b>phase</b> or the {{exponential}} phase) {{is a period}} characterized by cell doubling. The number of new bacteria appearing per unit time {{is proportional to the}} present population. If growth is not limited, doubling will continue at a constant rate so both the number of cells and the rate of population increase doubles with each consecutive time period. For this type of exponential growth, plotting the natural logarithm of cell number against time produces a straight line. The slope of this line is the specific growth rate of the organism, which {{is a measure of the}} number of divisions per cell per unit time. The actual rate of this growth (i.e. the slope of the line in the figure) depends upon the growth conditions, which affect the frequency of cell division events and the probability of both daughter cells surviving. Under controlled conditions, cyanobacteria can double their population four times a day. Exponential growth cannot continue indefinitely, however, because the medium is soon depleted of nutrients and enriched with wastes.|$|E
50|$|The {{bactericidal}} {{effects of}} β-lactam antibiotics are achieved through inhibition of the {{bacterial cell wall}} synthesis. The cell wall of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria is a tight covalently bound and cross-linked peptidoglycan network and essential for bacterial growth, cell division and cellular structure. Therefore, bacteria need enzymes that can cleave the cell wall during bacterial growth and cell division. The cell wall of bacteria is built up in two steps from {{the outside of the}} cell. In the first step, molecules of disaccharide units linked with peptides on their ends are transported from the cytoplasm of the bacteria and joined together {{on the outside of the}} wall by a transglycolase. In the second step, a transpeptidase links together long polysaccharide chains which are linked together through peptide bonds. The amino acid sequence of D-alanyl-D-alanine is recognized by the transpeptidase at the end of the peptide chain. The enzyme cleaves off the alanine on the terminal end and joins the remainder to a peptide chain from an adjacent polysaccharide. This transpeptidation reaction is inhibited by β-lactam antibiotics like cephalosporins. Because of this inhibition the antibiotics are most effective when the bacteria are in the <b>logarithmic</b> <b>phase</b> of growth, were then they are synthesizing the cell wall. If the bacteria are in the stationary phase of growth then there is no wall synthesizing in progress and the antibiotics have much lower effect.|$|E

The activity of Guerin’s carcinoma microsomal NADH-cytochrome b 5 reductase, the content and the rate of cytochrome b 5 oxidation-reduction, the content and the rate of cytochrome Р 450 oxidation-reduction have been investigated in rats with tumor under conditions of ω- 3 PUFAs administration. ω- 3 PUFAs supplementation before and after transplantation of Guerin’s carcinoma resulted in the increase of NADH-cytochrome b 5 reductase activity and decrease of cytochrome b 5 level in the Guerin’s carcinoma microsomal fraction in the <b>logarithmic</b> <b>phases</b> of carcinogenesis as compared to the tumor-bearing rats. Increased activity of NADH-cytochrome b 5 reductase facilitates higher electron flow in redox-chain of MOS. Under decreased cytochrome b 5 levels the electrons are transferred to oxygen, which leads to heightened generation of superoxide (O 2 •-) in comparison to control. It was shown, that the decrease of cytochrome P 450 level in the Guerin’s carcinoma microsomal fraction in the <b>logarithmic</b> <b>phases</b> of oncogenesis under ω- 3 PUFAs administration may be associated with its transition into an inactive form – cytochrome P 420.

40|$|Background: In Paramecium primaurelia, an exconjugant cell {{can produce}} two Lines with {{different}} mating capacities. Mating type II cells can form a higher food vacuole number and digest the nutrient {{taken up in}} a shorter time; thus, mating type II cells grow {{at a faster rate}} than do mating type I cells. The present study was done to determine whether cells that ingest more nutrients also have a larger amount of storage lipids. Methods: Quantitative and qualitative determinations of neutral lipids were obtained by means of cytofluorometry and fluorescence confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), respectively, by using nile red on cells in different physiologic states. Results: Lipid droplet number and neutral lipid content were higher in mating type II cells than in mating type I cells in the early <b>logarithmic</b> growth <b>phase</b> (i. e., immature well-fed cells). These values were reversed during the middle and the late <b>logarithmic</b> <b>phases</b> and became equal in the stationary phase (i. e., mature starved cells).

Conclusions: Although differences between mating type I and mating type II lines were not correlated to cell size, a relation was found between lipid content and food ingestion capacity. A depletion of bacteria in the culture medium could be responsible for the lack of differences in mature starved cells.
