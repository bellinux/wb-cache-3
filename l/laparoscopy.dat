5|$|Pheochromocytomas are {{tumors of the}} {{adrenal medulla}} that arise from chromaffin cells. They can produce a variety of nonspecific symptoms, which include headaches, sweating, anxiety and palpitations. Common signs include {{hypertension}} and tachycardia. Surgery, especially adrenal <b>laparoscopy,</b> {{is the most common}} treatment for small pheochromocytomas.|$|E
5|$|Surgical {{exploration}} may {{be necessary}} to obtain a suitable biopsy and to accurately stage a patient with cholangiocarcinoma. <b>Laparoscopy</b> can be used for staging purposes and may avoid the need for a more invasive surgical procedure, such as laparotomy, in some patients. Surgery is also the only curative option for cholangiocarcinoma, although it is limited to patients with early-stage disease.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} of the loggerhead {{sea turtle}} is only apparent in adults. Adult males have longer tails and claws than females. The males' plastrons are shorter than the females', presumably to accommodate the males' larger tails. The carapaces of males are wider and less domed than the females', and males typically have wider heads than females. The sex of juveniles and subadults cannot be determined through external anatomy, but can be observed through dissection, <b>laparoscopy</b> (an operation performed on the abdomen), histological examination (cell anatomy), and radioimmunological assays (immune study dealing with radiolabeling).|$|E
30|$|There were 1, 723 {{patients}} (1, 224 <b>laparoscopies</b> and 499 laparotomies) {{who were}} preoperatively diagnosed with benign ovarian tumor and underwent surgery at our hospital from January 1995 to December 2010. Among these, there were 54 patients (25 <b>laparoscopies</b> and 29 laparotomies, 29 adnexectomies and 25 ovarian tumorectomies) who underwent surgery because of acute abdomen {{and who were}} diagnosed with tumor-related ovarian torsion based on the intraoperative findings.|$|R

40|$|The laparoscopic {{approach}} of pediatric surgery emergencies represents a specific preoccupation in hospitals {{everywhere in the}} world. Nowadays, when confronted with this pathology, pediatric surgeons are able to apply certain well-defined therapeutic protocols, depending on the technical equipment at their disposal and their laparoscopic expertise and training. We hereby present some of the surgical pediatric emergencies that {{have been subjected to}} minimally invasive celioscopic techniques, in the Department of Pediatric Surgery “Maria Sklodowska Curie ” Hospital, from August 1999 to July 2007. Out of 83 exploratory <b>laparoscopies,</b> 12 were performed for emergency pathology, other than acute appendicitis (in its various forms, including peritonitis) or acute cholecystitis. However, during the above-mentioned period, the number of therapeutic <b>laparoscopies</b> for emergencies has grown significantly (239 from a total of 663 <b>laparoscopies),</b> reflecting to a large extent the activity of a clinic with an emergency surgery profile. The authors conclude that exploratory <b>laparoscopies</b> in pediatric surgery emergencies are suited for surgical teams with a solid experience in celioscopy and a certain professional maturity, necessary to correctly appreciate the surgical and anesthetic risks involved by each individual case. It is not recommended that inexperienced laparoscopic surgeons embark on the “adventure ” of this minimally invasive approach for this type of pathology. Only when the training and learning process is fully and correctly completed, specialists ar...|$|R
5|$|Another area of {{interest}} is in assessing whether keyhole surgery (<b>laparoscopy)</b> {{would be better than}} Whipple's procedure in treating the disease surgically, particularly in terms of recovery time. Irreversible electroporation is a relatively novel ablation technique that has shown promise in downstaging and prolonging survival in persons with locally advanced disease. It is especially suitable for treatment of tumors that are in proximity to peri-pancreatic vessels without risk of vascular trauma. The limited success of outcomes after surgery has led to a number of trials that were running in 2014 to test outcomes using chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy before surgery. This had previously not been found to be helpful, but is being trialed again, using drug combinations which have emerged from the many trials of post-operative therapies, such as FOLFIRINOX.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{treatment}} for endometrial cancer is surgery; 90% {{of women with}} endometrial cancer are treated with some form of surgery. Surgical treatment typically consists of hysterectomy including a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, which is {{the removal of the}} uterus, and both ovaries and Fallopian tubes. Lymphadenectomy, or removal of pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes, is performed for tumors of histologic grade II or above. Lymphadenectomy is routinely performed for all stages of endometrial cancer in the United States, but in the United Kingdom, the lymph nodes are typically only removed with disease of stage II or greater. The topic of lymphadenectomy and what survival benefit it offers in stage I disease is still being debated. In stage III and IV cancers, cytoreductive surgery is the norm, and a biopsy of the omentum may also be included. In stage IV disease, where there are distant metastases, surgery can be used as part of palliative therapy. Laparotomy, an open-abdomen procedure, is the traditional surgical procedure; however, <b>laparoscopy</b> (keyhole surgery) is associated with lower operative morbidity. The two procedures have no difference in overall survival. Removal of the uterus via the abdomen is recommended over removal of the uterus via the vagina because it gives the opportunity to examine and obtain washings of the abdominal cavity to detect any further evidence of cancer. Staging of the cancer is done during the surgery.|$|E
25|$|When <b>laparoscopy</b> is performed, {{the surgeon}} may note the {{distended}} tubes, identify the occlusion, {{and may also}} find associated adhesions affecting the pelvic organs. <b>Laparoscopy</b> not only allows for the diagnosis of hydrosalpinx, but also presents a platform for intervention (see management).|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Our {{purpose was}} to test the {{hypothesis}} that menstruation and intrapelvic injection of endometrium for the induction of endometriosis affect inflammatory parameters in peritoneal fluid from baboons. STUDY DESIGN: In {{the first part of this}} study, 107 <b>laparoscopies</b> were performed in 62 female baboons with a normal pelvis during menstruation, the follicular phase, and the luteal phase. In the second part of this study, 21 baboons were studied during paired <b>laparoscopies</b> in the follicular phase and the luteal phase of the cycle. In the third part of this study, 11 baboons were studied by paired <b>laparoscopies</b> during menses and during the nonmenstrual phase of the cycle. In the fourth part of this study, paired <b>laparoscopies</b> were performed in 7 baboons before and after intrapelvic injection of endometrium. Peritoneal fluid was aspirated and measured in all <b>laparoscopies</b> and assessed for leukocyte concentration. In the third and fourth parts of the study, peritoneal fluid was analyzed for the concentrations of inflammatory cytokines and for the proportions of cells with immunohistochemical staining positive for these cytokines. RESULTS: During menstruation, in comparison with nonmenstrual phases of the cycle, the leukocyte concentration of the peritoneal fluid was increased significantly, as were the proportions of peritoneal fluid cells with positive staining for tumor necrosis factor alpha, transforming growth factor beta(1), and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and the peritoneal fluid concentrations of transforming growth factor beta(1) and interleukin 6. After intrapelvic injection of endometrium, the peritoneal fluid leukocyte concentration and the proportions of peritoneal fluid cells with positive staining for tumor necrosis factor alpha, transforming growth factor beta(1), CD 3, and human leukocyte antigen (DR locus) significantly increased. CONCLUSION: Subclinical peritoneal inflammation occurs in baboons during menstruation and after intrapelvic injection of endometrium. status: publishe...|$|R
