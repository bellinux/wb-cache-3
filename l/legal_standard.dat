In June 2013, the OCR dismissed the case on the basis that the <b>legal</b> <b>standard</b> required not only harm, but the intent to do harm, which was not established.|$|E
5|$|After a small {{quantity}} {{was struck}} for circulation, the Mint received complaints regarding the prominent placement of Gobrecht's {{name on the}} dollar, and the design was modified to incorporate his name in a less conspicuous position. In January 1837, the <b>legal</b> <b>standard</b> for the percentage of precious metal in silver coins was changed from 89.2% to 90%, and the Gobrecht dollars struck after that point reflect this change. In total, 1,900 Gobrecht dollars were struck during the official production run. Production of the Seated Liberty dollar, which utilized the same obverse design as the Gobrecht dollar, began mintage in 1840. In the 1850s, Mint officials controversially re-struck the coins without authorization.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in the competition law jurisprudence in the EU indicate continuous movement towards a more economics-based assessment of the effects on competition in eventually all areas of competition law enforcement. Facing new challenges of increased complexity of the economic theories and economic evidence Commission and Community Courts attempted to develop workable <b>legal</b> <b>standards</b> in order to assure the efficiency and predictability of the competition law enforcement. However, the quest for clearly formulated <b>legal</b> <b>standards</b> wasn’t always productive. Present paper addresses these issues on {{the example of the}} assessment of coordinated effects (tacit collusion/collective dominance) under the EC Merger Regulation. Author takes the position that in this particular area of competition law enforcement, search for a general, and catch-all <b>legal</b> <b>standards</b> has in fact delayed the incorporation of the economic assessment in the respective legal procedures. While the impact of the recent Impala litigation remains uncertain, the author argues that it represents an important milestone in the development of economically sound <b>legal</b> <b>standards</b> in this field...|$|R

Although uncertainty over whether executions in the United States would be put on hold during the period in which the United States Supreme Court considers the constitutionality of lethal injection initially arose after the court agreed to hear Baze, no executions took place during the period between when the court agreed to hear the case and when its ruling was announced, {{with the exception of one}} lethal injection in Texas hours after the court made its announcement.|$|E

The following year, the Office of Special Masters of the United States Court of Federal Claims {{held a series of}} meetings to decide how to deal with these claims, and that July, issued an order establishing the Omnibus Autism Proceeding. According to the Cedillos, Michelle was developmentally normal until she received her MMR vaccine at the age of 15 months, at which point she developed a 105-degree fever, began vomiting and developed diarrhea. Michelle was diagnosed with autism 18 months after receiving her MMR vaccine. According to the Washington Post, the <b>legal</b> <b>standard</b> to which the cases were subjected in this trial meant that [...] "the outcome will hinge not on scientific standards of evidence but on a <b>legal</b> <b>standard</b> of plausibilitywhat one lawyer for the families called '50 percent and a feather'." [...] It was in 2002 that, given the large number of litigants seeking compensation from the NVICP, the Omnibus Autism Proceeding was established. Its aim was to resolve pending vaccine-autism claims [...] "aggressively but fairly." ...|$|E
500|$|When the {{full-scale}} production began, {{the reverse}} eagle {{was surrounded by}} 26 stars rather than 24 as Patterson had originally requested of Sully, as the states of Arkansas and Michigan had been admitted to the Union since Patterson's letter was penned in 1835. Some of the Gobrecht dollars produced were struck with 'medal alignment', meaning that the obverse and reverse images both face upward when the coin is rotated around its vertical axis. For the 1837 production (which kept the 1836 date), Patterson ordered that the coins be struck in coin alignment, the opposite of medal alignment, and the practice with current US coins (the two faces both are upright when the coin is rotated about its horizontal axis). An act of January 18, 1837, officially changed the <b>legal</b> <b>standard</b> for silver coins from 89.2% to 90% silver. Numismatic historian Walter Breen asserts that those pieces struck before the passage of this act are technically patterns (or coins created to test their design, composition or other points), as they were not authorized by Congress. In total, 1,000 pieces dated 1836 were struck in 89.2% silver and 600 in 90% silver. Gobrecht dollars struck prior to passage of the act weighed , while those struck later weighed [...]|$|E

500|$|The law in {{this area}} is often criticised because it sets a <b>legal</b> <b>standard</b> for insanity, not a medical one. In R v Quick and Paddison [...] QB 910, for example, the courts decided that an assault {{committed}} when the defendant was suffering from hypoglycemia due to the taking of insulin was not insane in nature, while in R v Hennsey [...] 1 WLR 287 it was held that a crime committed while the defendant was suffering from hyperglycemia did constitute insanity. As a result, the existing law allows some diabetics to be acquitted while others are declared insane, something one academic describes as [...] "absurd". In R v Sullivan, a man was charged with grievous bodily harm under the Offences against the Person Act 1861 after assaulting his friend during an epileptic seizure. The House of Lords ruled that Sullivan was indeed insane, and that [...] "it does not lie within the power of the courts to alter [...] ". Some critics have professed [...] "unease" [...] at the powers of the courts to confine people found {{not guilty by reason of}} insanity in mental hospitals, arguing that discussion of mental health should be limited to the mens rea of the crime; if the mental condition of the defendant voided the offence's mens rea, he should be acquitted.|$|E
500|$|FBI Special Agent Robert Sawyer {{initially}} {{said there}} was probable cause to believe the trio were conspiring to kill Obama, based on searches of their hotel rooms and cars. However, United States Attorney Troy Eid said the racist statements the suspects made following their arrests had not risen to the <b>legal</b> <b>standard</b> {{that would have allowed}} the filing of federal charges for threatening a presidential candidate, an offense that falls under the same statute as threatening the President of the United States. Prosecutors also said they had insufficient evidence that they had the means to carry out a plot to kill Obama. Eid said the searches of the suspects' rooms and computers turned up no evidence of a plot or conspiracy. Eid and his aides said the decision not to press charges of threatening a presidential candidate was at least in part because they did not believe a jury would convict them based on the reliability of Johnson's testimony. Jeffrey Dorschner, Eid's spokesman, said a defense attorney “would tear him apart”. Although Eid would be accused of racism and political posturing for not seeking the charge, Eid said, [...] "The 'political' thing to have done in this case, of course, would have been to charge all three defendants with making a threat against Obama and then quietly drop those charges later — expedient, Machiavellian and self-serving, but also illegal, unethical and immoral." ...|$|E
