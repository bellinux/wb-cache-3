5|$|Because of {{new ideas}} about the {{treatment}} of alcoholism, the lifetime suspension was downgraded to a 10-year suspension in 1952. DUI prosecutions remained difficult in cases when drivers refused to take a Breathalyzer test, and so in 1966, the state authorized the suspension of a person's driver's license for refusing to submit a breath sample. In 1977, the BAC <b>limit</b> was reduced to 0.10%, but the law was modified to differentiate between {{the second and third}} offenses, with lesser penalties for first and second convictions. In 1983, the state established a per se rule wherein a person over the <b>limit</b> was considered drunk in all cases (that is, not merely a presumption). Nine years later, the 0.01% BAC <b>limit</b> for drivers under 21 was instituted, and in 2003, the 0.10% BAC <b>limit</b> was reduced to 0.08% to comply with federal highway funding requirements.|$|E
