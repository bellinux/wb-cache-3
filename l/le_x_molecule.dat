40|$|Abstract Background Treatment {{decisions}} in colorectal cancer subsequent to surgery are based {{mainly on the}} TNM system. There {{is a need to}} establish novel prognostic markers based on the molecular characterization of tumor cells. Evidence exists that sialyl <b>Le</b> <b>X</b> expression is correlated with an unfavorable outcome in colorectal cancer. The aim {{of this study was to}} establish a simple sialyl <b>Le</b> <b>X</b> staining score and to determine a potential correlation with the prognosis in a series of advanced colorectal carcinoma patients. Methods In order to implement routine use of sialyl <b>Le</b> <b>X</b> immunohistology, we established a new, easily reproducible score and defined a cutoff which discriminated groups with better or worse outcome, respectively. We then correlated sialyl <b>Le</b> <b>X</b> expression of 215 UICC stage III and IV patients with disease-free and cancer-related survival. Results A five-stage score could be established based on automated immunohistochemical stainings. Using a statistical model, we calculated a cutoff to discriminate between weak and strong staining positivity of sialyl <b>Le</b> <b>X.</b> Patients with strong positive specimens had a worse cancer-related survival (P = 0. 004) but no difference was observed for disease-free survival (P = 0. 352). Conclusions These results demonstrate a strong correlation between high sialyl <b>Le</b> <b>X</b> -expression in colorectal carcinomas and cancer-related survival. Our highly standardized and easy-to-use staining score is suitable for routine use and hence it could be recommended to evaluate sialyl <b>Le</b> <b>X</b> -expression as part of the standard histopathological analysis of colorectal carcinomas and to validate the score prospectively based on a larger population. </p...|$|R

This coupling was performed at 40 &# 176;C under excess of BF 3 &# 183;OEt 2 activation and proceeded best if the acceptor carried a 6 -chlorohexyl rather than a 6 -azidohexyl aglycon. The 6 -chlorohexyl disaccharide was then converted to an acceptor and submitted to fucosylation yielding the corresponding protected 6 -chlorohexyl <b>Le</b> <b>x</b> trisaccharide.

Under these conditions, the 6 -chlorohexyl and 6 -azidohexyl intermediates led respectively to the n -hexyl and 6 -aminohexyl trisaccharide targets.

Objective To compare the expressive patterns of the isoantigenic determinants of histo-blood groups ABH and Lewis in squamous and simple epithelium and in precursors and cancers of the cervix. Methods A total of 36 lesions and neoplasms (10 LG-SIL, 16 HG-SIL and 10 invasive carcinomas) have been studied with immunohistochemical techniques, using monoclonal antibodies (MoAb BG 1 to BG 8) for precursor chains, blood-group ABH and Lewis group Le a, <b>Le</b> b, <b>Le</b> <b>x,</b> and <b>Le</b> y, and four types of lectins.

In this study we asked whether Helicobacter pylori whole cells and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) utilize sugar moieties of Lewis (Le) antigenic determinants to interact with DC-SIGN (dendritic cell specific ICAM grabbing nonintegrin) receptor on dendritic cells (DCs). For this purpose the soluble DC-SIGN/Fc adhesion assay and the THP- 1 leukemia cells with induced expression of DC-SIGN were used. We showed that the binding specificity of DC-SIGN with H. pylori Le X/Y positive whole cells and H. pylori LPS of Le X/Y type was fucose dependent, whereas in Le XY negative H. pylori strains and LPS preparations without Lewis determinants, this binding was galactose dependent.

40|$|In mammals, an {{elaborate}} series of physiological events take place before fertilization {{of the female}} gamete. Upon insemination, {{a small fraction of}} the sperm deposited in the female reproductive tract is transported to the lower oviduct (isthmus) to form a functional sperm reservoir. The sperm reservoir extends sperm lifespan, prevents polyspermic fertilization, and is implicated in the regulation of capacitation. Once capacitated, a small number of sperm is released from the storage site to form a pool that can bind to the egg. The precise identity of the molecules that mediate the interactions between spermatozoa and epithelial cells of the isthmus are not currently known. Similarly, the molecules and mechanisms involved in the sperm release from the reservoir are poorly understood. It has been proposed, however, that oviduct glycans play a major role in the molecular interaction that leads to the formation of the sperm reservoir. A glycan array previously demonstrated that porcine sperm bound predominantly to motifs containing either biantennary α 2, 6 sialylated lactosamine (SiLN) or LewisX (LeX) trisaccharide present in the luminal epithelium of the isthmus. Functional data generated by blocking the interaction between uncapacitated sperm and isthmic oviduct cells in vitro strongly suggests that the glycoconjugates containing SiLN and <b>Le</b> <b>X</b> are at least partially involved in the formation of sperm reservoir in swine. These glycans, involved in binding, are also implicated in the regulation of the capacitation process by extending sperm lifespan.

This 32 -kD fragment, however, has a Tm of 43 degrees C due to a very high amino acid content, and thus remains helical at physiologic core temperature.

However, this collagenase-generated fragment can be readily degraded to completion by cathepsin B at 37 degrees C and pH 4. 4. Interestingly, even under acidic conditions, cathepsin B cannot effectively attack the whole 59 -kD type <b>X</b> <b>molecule</b> at 37 degrees C, but only the 32 -kD collagenase-generated fragment. Most importantly, the 32 -kD fragment was also degraded at acid pH by cell lysates isolated from murine osteoclasts.

Based upon these data, we postulate that during in vivo endochondral bone formation type X collagen is first degraded at neutral pH by interstitial collagenase secreted by resorbing cartilage-derived cells.
