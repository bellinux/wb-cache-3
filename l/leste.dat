40|$|Identifying key {{traits that}} shape {{trade-offs}} that restrict species {{to only a}} subset of environmental gradients is crucial to understanding and predicting species turnover. Previous field experiments have shown that larvae of <b>Lestes</b> damselfly species segregate along the entire gradient of pond permanence and predator presence and that differential predation risk and life history constraints together shape their distribution. Here, we report laboratory experiments that identify key differences in behavior and physiology among species that structure their distributions along this gradient. The absence of adaptive antipredator behavioral responses against large dragonfly larvae and fish of <b>Lestes</b> dryas, the only species to inhabit predator-free vernal ponds that dry each year, is consistent with its high vulnerability to predation and probably the key trait that excludes it from parts of the gradient with predators. The reciprocal dominance of two other <b>Lestes</b> species in permanent waters dominated by either dragonflies or fish {{can be explained by}} the lack of effective antipredator behaviors against dragonflies and fish, respectively. Maximal growth rates did not differ among <b>Lestes</b> along the gradient. However, in the natural predator environment of vernal ponds (only conspecific cannibals), the vernal-pond <b>Lestes</b> had higher growth rates than the other <b>Lestes</b> suggesting that this excludes other <b>Lestes</b> from vernal ponds. Similarly, <b>Lestes</b> species that inhabit temporary ponds (i. e., ponds that dry intermittently every few years but not every year) had a higher growth rate than the fishless permanent-pond <b>Lestes</b> in the presence of the syntopic dragonfly predator. These growth differences among <b>Lestes</b> in predator treatments were not due to differences in food intake, but due to differences in physiology. The vernal-pond <b>Lestes</b> converted more assimilated food into body mass compared to the other <b>Lestes</b> in the presence of conspecific larvae, and the temporary-pond <b>Lestes</b> had a higher conversion efficiency than the fishless permanent-pond <b>Lestes</b> in the presence of the syntopic dragonfly predators. In contrast, reductions in growth rate within species in the presence of syntopic predators were both physiologically and behaviorally mediated. The interplay between behavior and physiology may be a common feature of the growth/predation-risk trade-off, and their joint study is therefore critical to mechanistically link phenotype, performance, and community assembly along the freshwater habitat gradient. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Survey {{data from}} New England showed that assemblages of <b>Lestes</b> damselflies are {{organized}} {{along the entire}} gradient of pond permanence and predator presence. One assemblage occupies vernal ponds lacking large dragonfly predators and fish; four are largely confined to temporary ponds that typically contain dragonfly predators; one dominates fishless permanent ponds and lakes where dragonflies are the top predators; and one dominates permanent ponds and lakes where fish are the top predators. We determined the role of life history and predation in maintaining this striking pattern by conducting a series of transplant experiments {{in the field and}} a laboratory experiment manipulating presence and absence of local predators. Life history (1) shaped the ability of species to cope with drying regime, thereby excluding temporary-pond <b>Lestes</b> from vernal ponds and permanent-water <b>Lestes</b> from temporary ponds, and (2) generated size differences among species due to differences in the timing of hatching. This mediated the exclusion of temporary-pond <b>Lestes</b> from permanent water bodies through asymmetric intraguild predation by permanent-water <b>Lestes.</b> Dragonfly predation on permanent-water <b>Lestes</b> had an indirect positive effect on the survival of temporary-pond Lestes; however, this effect apparently is too small to allow coexistence of both <b>Lestes</b> groups. Predation by large dragonfly larvae excluded the <b>Lestes</b> species of vernal ponds from temporary ponds, and differential vulnerability to large dragonfly larvae and fish shaped the reciprocal dominance of L. eurinus and L. vigilax in fishless and fish-containing permanent water bodies, respectively. Taken together, these results show that life history constraints and predation both shape the distributions of <b>Lestes</b> species along the pond permanence gradient in New England. We discuss the importance of this freshwater habitat gradient in shaping local and regional species diversity. status: publishe...|$|R
5|$|The F-FDTL's {{primary role}} is to protect East Timor from {{external}} threats.

5|$|In May 2006, 2,000 ADF {{personnel}} were again deployed to East Timor {{as part of}} Operation Astute, following unrest between elements of the Timor <b>Leste</b> Defence Force.

However, by early-2010 the security situation had been stabilised and just 400 Australian personnel remained to train the local security forces as part of a small international force. Following a drawdown, the International Stabilisation Force commenced withdrawing from Timor-Leste in November 2012, a process which was completed in April 2013.|$|E
40|$|The Enallagma and <b>Lestes</b> damselflies {{have both}} diversified and adapted {{over the past}} 10 - 15 million years to the various {{ecological}} milieus found along the pond permanence gradient among North American ponds and lakes. Previous articles have explored this diversification process for Enallagma. In this article, we present a phylogenetic hypothesis for the North American <b>Lestes,</b> use this hypothesis to reconstruct <b>Lestes</b> diversification, and compare the diversification processes inferred for <b>Lestes</b> and Enallagma. The {{results of this study}} suggest that <b>Lestes</b> began in temporary ponds where large dragonflies are the top predators, while Enallagma began in permanent lakes where fish are the top predators. Starting from these different ancestral habitats, both genera have invaded and adapted to habitats already occupied by the other genus. Moreover, these adaptive habitat shifts involved substantial convergence on the behaviors used to deal with fish and dragonfly predation in both genera and a major life-history shift from diapausing to directly developing eggs in <b>Lestes.</b> However, in <b>Lestes</b> lineages invading fish lakes, swimming speed and morphology did not change to match those of Enallagma species, illustrating that reciprocal shifts between alternative selection regimes are not necessarily evolutionary opposites. Also, the greater sizes and growth rates of <b>Lestes</b> species compared to Enallagma species, which should impart substantial ecological advantages in competition between the genera, were shown to result from phylogenetic inheritance and not from adaptive diversification. This historical analysis of diversification raises new questions about the relationship between the macroevolutionary mechanisms driving lineage diversification and the ecological mechanisms structuring local food webs and regional species assemblages. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|The Special Air Service Regiment {{owes its}} {{heritage}} to the RAR. Originally formed as the 1st SAS Company in 1957, in 1960 {{it became an}} independent company of the RAR and was tasked with providing the army's special operations capability. The SASR became a regiment {{in its own right}} on 20 August 1964, severing the link with the RAR at this time. Re-raised as a commando battalion from 1997, 4 RAR (Commando) served in East Timor as a conventional light-role battalion in 2001, before focusing on the development of its special operations capability. In this role the battalion was designed to be a flexible, self-contained force element able to deploy at short notice to undertake offensive operations in support of Australia's national interests. Once full operational capability was reached, elements of 4 RAR (Commando) would serve in Timor <b>Leste,</b> Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as providing a domestic counter terrorism capability as part of Tactical Assault Group (East). In 2009, 4 RAR (Commando) was renamed the 2nd Commando Regiment, and as such is no longer part of the RAR. Rather than being formally disbanded, 4 RAR remained on the Army's order of battle with its colours and traditions maintained and protected, ready to be re-raised in the future if required.|$|E
