If lightning strikes an aluminum alloy surface, the current generated by the lightning can easily flow without interruption or diversion to {{the interior of the}} aircraft. Today, fiber-reinforced polymer composites have been widely utilized in aircraft. In order to protect fiber-reinforced composites against lightning strikes, copper (Cu) and aluminum (Al) meshes or metal sheets are used in the uppermost layer. As it is known, carbon fibers are nobler than both Cu and Al meshes, resulting in galvanic corrosion when these dissimilar materials interact with each other under certain environmental conditions. Consequently, corroded metal mesh areas will lose conductivity on the composite surface. For this reason, <b>lightning</b> <b>strike</b> <b>protection</b> is vitally important for the new generation of composite aircraft. In the present study, we systematically studied the galvanic corrosion effects of carbon fibers and metal (Al and Cu) meshes in acidic and salty conditions. We found that environmental conditions had a big impact on the galvanic corrosion between carbon fibers and metal meshes used for fiber-reinforced composites. This paper discusses current <b>lightning</b> <b>strike</b> <b>protection</b> techniques and provides some experimental evidence of graphene and indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) -based nanocomposite coatings on carbon fiber-reinforced composites.

40|$|Traditional {{methods to}} protect {{composite}} aircraft from lightning strike damage {{rely on a}} conductive layer embedded on or within {{the surface of the}} aircraft composite skin. This method is effective at preventing major direct effect damage and minimizes indirect effects to aircraft systems from lightning strike attachment, but provides no additional benefit for the added parasitic weight from the conductive layer. When a known lightning strike occurs, the points of attachment and detachment on the aircraft surface are visually inspected and checked for damage by maintenance personnel to ensure continued safe flight operations. A new multi-functional <b>lightning</b> <b>strike</b> <b>protection</b> (LSP) method has been developed to provide aircraft <b>lightning</b> <b>strike</b> <b>protection,</b> damage detection and diagnosis for composite aircraft surfaces. The method incorporates a SansEC sensor array on the aircraft exterior surfaces forming a "Smart skin" surface for aircraft lightning zones certified to withstand strikes up to 100 kiloamperes peak current. SansEC sensors are open-circuit devices comprised of conductive trace spiral patterns sans (without) electrical connections. The SansEC sensor is an electromagnetic resonator having specific resonant parameters (frequency, amplitude, bandwidth & phase) which when electromagnetically coupled with a composite substrate will indicate the electrical impedance of the composite through a change in its resonant response. Any measureable shift in the resonant characteristics can be an indication of damage to the composite caused by a lightning strike or from other means. The SansEC sensor method is intended to diagnose damage for both in-situ health monitoring or ground inspections. In this paper, the theoretical mathematical framework is established for the use of open circuit sensors to perform damage detection and diagnosis on carbon fiber composites. Both computational and experimental analyses were conducted to validate this new method and system for aircraft composite damage detection and diagnosis. Experimental test results on seeded fault damage coupons and computational modeling simulation results are presented. This paper also presents the shielding effectiveness along with the lightning direct effect test results from several different SansEC LSP and baseline protected and unprotected carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) test panels struck at 40 and 100 kiloamperes following a universal common practice test procedure to enable damage comparisons between SansEC LSP configurations and common practice copper mesh LSP approaches. The SansEC test panels were mounted in a LSP test bed during the lightning test. Electrical, mechanical and thermal parameters were measured during lightning attachment and are presented with post test nondestructive inspection comparisons.

40|$|This work {{describes}} a successful attempt toward {{the development of}} composite materials based on nanofilled epoxy resins for the realization of structural aeronautic components providing efficient <b>lightning</b> <b>strike</b> <b>protection.</b> The epoxy matrix is prepared by mixing a tetrafunctional epoxy precursor with a reactive diluent which allows the moisture content to be reduced and facilitates the nanofiller dispersion step. The reactive diluent also proves to be beneficial for improving the curing degree of nanofilled epoxy mixtures. It increases the mobility of reactive groups resulting in a higher cure degree than the epoxy precursor alone. This effect is particularly advantageous for nanofilled resins where higher temperature treatments are needed, compared to the unfilled resin, to reach the same cure degree.

The specimens and support for the project was provided by The Boeing Company (Structures Damage and Technology Group). Several methods of crack investigation were considered for this study; it was determined that visual inspection through digital photography at evenly spaced intervals throughout the test provided the best method for the characterization of crack initiation and growth. Visual analysis of the specimen images was performed. This led to precise estimates of the cycles to crack initiation as well as crack length versus cycle count throughout each experiment. The results clearly demonstrated reduced crack growth rates throughout each experiment, which is likely attributed to fiber bridging. Crack growth versus cycles for various experiments were well represented by a single reference curve with appropriate cycle count scale factors.
