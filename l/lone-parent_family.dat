Abstract This paper introduces the topic of families and households. The shift of attitudes and social values which are connected with single-parent family households is studied based on statistical surveys. This work elaborates changes in number and structure of single-parent family {{households in}} Czech and Slovak Republic since 1970 till present. The first part outlines the view of experts on a broad concept of family and the family cycle. The next part evaluates the long-term evolution of marriage, divorce, fertility and changes in society values. The changes in society values are correlated with formation, structure and number of single parent family households in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic before and after 1990.

Women more often than men form a <b>lone-parent</b> <b>family,</b> while men enter a new union. The economic conditions worsen for women more than for men and so the general standards of living. Findings are supported by a micro level analysis of life course data collected in the OECD countries trhough the Family and Fertility Surveys (1990 s). The ways in which the two genders face the period after a marital dissolution are strongly dependent on the starting family conditions, the available resources and personnel characteristics, not to mention the Countries' specific institutional and cultural context...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{some issues}} {{with regard to}} the problems in definition and measurement of poverty, both theoretically and empirically. Another objective is to identify some of the important factors related to child poverty in Canada. Poverty and inequality are examined from three theoretical perspectives: functionalist, conflict and feminist, in order to see which theory is better supported by the empirical evidence. Family type, residing in different provinces, age and number of children, age of the head of the family were found to be important factors in the literature. The three theories' central arguments were supported by the literature. In addition, regression analysis from the General Social Survey Cycle 10 was used to identify the most important factors with regard to child poverty, while other factors are controlled. The analysis indicated that age of the household head was the most important factor, followed by the number of children in the household, living in a <b>lone-parent</b> <b>family,</b> receiving income from work or government, education, and residing in Atlantic Canada. The results show that human capital factors such as age and education, considered important in the functionalist theory, were the most significant, followed by structural factors such as residing in different regions, emphasized in the conflict perspective. Gender, central to the feminist paradigm, was not significant, but could be important through other processes such as number of children and full or part-time work...|$|E
40|$|The report {{examines}} {{income and}} low income in census metropolitan areas between 1980 and 2000. It examines {{the situation of}} families and the neighbourhoods they live in. It also examines the situation of recent immigrants, Aboriginal people and <b>lone-parent</b> <b>family</b> members. Median pre-tax income rose in virtually all Canadian census metropolitan areas (CMAs) over the 1980 to 2000 period. Incomes increased at both {{the top and bottom}} of the income distribution, but tended to rise faster at the top. In nearly all cities, income increased faster in the higher income neighbourhoods - measured at the census tract (CT) level - than it did in lower income neighbourhoods. The incidence of low income was at similar levels in 1980 and 2000, but the demographic composition of low income changed, reflecting rising low-income rates among some 'at-risk' groups, as well as demographic changes in the CMA. By 2000, recent immigrants comprised more of the low-income population, and a greater share of the residents in low-income neighbourhoods than they did in 1980. Recent immigrants had much higher low-income rates in 2000 than in 1980. In 2000, Aboriginal people and people in single-parent families had much higher low-income rates than others and were over-represented in low-income neighbourhoods. The share of income that low-income families received from government transfers rose over the period. The location of low-income neighbourhoods changed in some CMAs, reflecting a decline in low-income neighbourhoods in the city centre and a rise in low-income neighbourhoods in more suburban areas. The report examines before-tax income in CMAs using the 1981, 1986, 1991, 1996 and 2001 censuses of Canada.

40|$|Who must {{feed the}} child when its parents are separated? Its mother, with her work; its father, by paying alimony; the {{community}} (local, national) with social rights or assist-ance; {{or a combination}} of these various sources? This is the question posed m this article, which attempts to understand and to compare {{the ways in which the}} debate is approached and how social measures and pol-icies are justified in France and in Britain. Several interpretations can be put forward in order to explain the gap between the situation in the two countries. On the one hand, there is a difference in the intensity of the economic problems experienced by one-parent families. In England, in the United States and in Canada, lone-parenthood is an element of poverty, while the link between lone-parenthood and poverty is much less clear in France, where ’only ’ one <b>lone-parent</b> <b>family</b> out of five can be considered as poor or totally dependent on the redistribution system. A sec-ond explanation refers to the fact that France has developed an explicit family policy, aimed not only at families in general but also at one-parent families, and endeavouring to make family life and professional life compatible for women. Thus in European comparisons, it is usual to consider France as the country which was first to accept the principle of public inter-vention in the family sphere, and Britain as one of those countries which reject this principle, for the sake of protecting the private sphere. After presenting a general overview of the balance between public and private obli-gations, and between family and state support, this article provides the main data available concerning family reconstitution. It then deals with the elements of the debate which arose, and are still arising, due to lone-parent ben-efits, which are still the main measure to combat economic insecurity for one-parent households...|$|E

This paper considers five sets of hypotheses that may be relevant to the cross-national variability of child poverty. The tentative conclusion from this analysis in 20 countries is that reducing child poverty, and in <b>lone-parent</b> <b>families</b> in particular, requires several approaches. Provisions that would discourage teenage childbearing would have their importance, as would opportunities for lone mothers to work. More important is the generosity of social expenditure applying to individuals and especially to families.

40|$|The {{study of}} <b>lone-parent</b> <b>families</b> has been {{high on the}} agenda of social science {{research}} for some time now. The rapid {{growth in the number of}} families headed by a lone adult and the higher incidence of poverty and other social problems among such families have attracted the attention of demographers, sociologists and others interested in social policy. Not surprisingly, most of this attention has centred on the situation of lone-mother families. More than four-fifths of lone parent families in most industrialized countries are headed by a woman. And it is among these mother-only families that the incidence of low income reaches strikingly high levels. The 1996 census indicates that 73 % of families headed by a woman less than 35 years of age fell below the Statistics Canada Low Income Cut-Off. The limited attention paid to male <b>lone-parent</b> <b>families</b> has usually been excused for two reasons. First, there are relatively few such families. In 1976, there were fewer than 100, 000 in Canada. Not only did the small number of these families make them appear an unimportant topic of study, it also made it difficult for interested researchers to learn much about them since studies based on national samples would find very few cases for analysis. Beyond their small numbers, however, lone-father families were also seen as less problematic from a social policy perspective...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} Finnish working mothers’ experiences of the effects of non-standard working schedules (NSWS) on family time in two family forms, coupled and <b>lone-parent</b> <b>families.</b> Furthermore the aim is to find out what meanings mothers with NSWS attached to family time paying particular attention to the circumstances in which mothers experienced NSWS positively. Design/methodology/approach – Thematic analysis of 20 semi-structured interviews was used to investigate mothers’ experiences of the effects of NSWS on family time. Findings – The key factor generating positive experiences was the ability to maintain regularity and togetherness, which was enhanced by specific features of work, such as autonomy and regularity, and successful child care arrangements. Also important were the values mothers associated with family time. The results highlighted the more problematic situation of <b>lone-parent</b> <b>families.</b> Research limitations/implications – The main limitation of this study was the small sample size. Practical implications – The findings show how the parents of small children benefit from the regularity and flexibility in their working hours. Owing to irregular and varying working times, flexible around-the-clock childcare is needed. In Finland, an important question is how to organize the care of small school-aged children. Lone mothers, especially, may need services to help with domestic chores and childcare. Social implications – A non-resident parent can also be an important source of childcare. Therefore policymakers should take into account family type, including consideration of the rights to childcare of non-resident parents. Originality/value – This study adds to the literature by explaining more in depth, through the richness of qualitative data, the circumstances in which mothers experience NSWS positively...|$|R

40|$|Concern about {{community}} decline, a prominent {{theme in the}} social capital literature, is often {{based on the assumption}} that changes in family life, such as the increased number of marriages ending in separation and divorce, the growth of <b>lone-parent</b> <b>families,</b> and the increased workforce participation of women, have led to declining levels of social capital in communities. Yet while this idea features in the work of influential social capital thinkers (Putnam 1995;, Bourdieu 1993; Fukuyama 1999), and is common among politicians, policy makers and the media, the relationship between family change and community life has rarely been the focus of empirical scrutiny.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the lifetime incidence {{and duration of}} lone motherhood and stepfamilies in Great Britain using both retrospective and panel information contained in the British Household Panel Survey, 1991 - 1995. We find that about 40 per cent of mothers will spend some time as a lone-parent. The duration of lone parenthood is often short, one-half remaining lone-mothers for 4. 6 years or less. About three-fourths of these lone-mothers will form a stepfamily, with 80 per cent of these stepfamilies being started by cohabitation and 85 per cent following the dissolution of a union.
