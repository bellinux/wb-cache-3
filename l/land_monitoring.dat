40|$|Collect Earth is a {{free and}} open source {{software}} for <b>land</b> <b>monitoring</b> developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Built on Google desktop and cloud computing technologies, Collect Earth facilitates access to multiple freely available archives of satellite imagery, including archives with very high spatial resolution imagery (Google Earth, Bing Maps) and those with very high temporal resolution imagery (e. g. Google Earth Engine, Google Earth Engine Code Editor). Collectively, these archives offer free access to an unparalleled amount of information on current and past land dynamics for any location in the world. Collect Earth draws upon these archives and the synergies of imagery of multiple resolutions to enable an innovative method for <b>land</b> <b>monitoring</b> that we present here: augmented visual interpretation. In this study, we provide a full overview of Collect Earth's structure and functionality, and we present the methodology used to undertake <b>land</b> <b>monitoring</b> through augmented visual interpretation.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} the EAGLE concept, an object-oriented data model for land moni-toring. It highlights the background {{situation in the}} field of <b>land</b> <b>monitoring,</b> identifies the team in-volved, explains the technical and strategic considerations behind the concept, {{describes the}} cur-rent status of the harmonization and the developments made and outlines the future activities and requirements. After the structure and the content of the data model and matrix are explained, ex-amples are given on how to use the matrix. Besides its possible function as a semantic translation tool between different classification systems, it also can help to analyze class definitions to find semantic gaps, overlaps and inconsistencies and can serve as data model for new mapping initia-tives. On the long-term, the EAGLE concept aims at sketching a vision of a future integrated and harmonized European <b>land</b> <b>monitoring</b> system, which is designed to store all kinds of environmen-tally relevant information on the Earth´s surface, coming from both national and European data sources.

40|$|ROSIS is an {{airborne}} {{imaging spectrometer}} {{which has been}} primary developed for oceanographic and limnologic applications, but <b>land</b> <b>monitoring</b> has been aspired as well. For the detection of water constituents a high radiometric sensitivity is required, for small-scale monitoring of land features a high geometric resolution is necessary, and for studying of certain spectral features (e. g. chlorophyll fluorescence) both high radiometric and high spectral resolution is demanded. Since any instrument optimisation {{for the benefit of}} one demand is to the disadvantage of the others, the technical realisation was challenging. Since ROSIS met hitherto only the requirements for <b>land</b> <b>monitoring,</b> but not those for quantitative analyses of water constituents, the instrument electronics was replaced in 1997.

It was compiled for the Global Land Indicators Initiative (GLII) {{as part of}} the technical assistance that the Natural Resources Institute at the University of Greenwich provided to GLTN / UN-Habitat in the GLII process from January to May 2015. Its purpose is to assist agreement on a set of commonly agreed global land indicators intended to monitor key aspects of land governance and land tenure security, so that all concerned stakeholders can contribute to a common monitoring effort at global, country, project and local levels. It includes clarification of the meanings of key land tenure terms and concepts, discussion of purposes and objectives of <b>land</b> <b>monitoring,</b> analysis of feasibility issues and a theory of change of how <b>land</b> <b>monitoring</b> to support improved tenure security and land governance improvements can support development goals. Since the conceptual framework and an associated list of indicators was continuing discussions have focussed on incorporation of headline indicators proposed to measure land tenure security into the framework of indicators for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which resulted in acceptance of GLII’s proposed indicators of tenure security at Indicator 1. 4. 2 in the SDG framework under Goal 1, Ending Poverty.
