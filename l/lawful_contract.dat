When other research discussed the business’ fraud schemes through the document alteration, this research focused on a case showing how a business could make the wrong statement to the investors through real and <b>lawful</b> future <b>contracts</b> with unqualified audit opinion. Structurally, this research was done through the action research method in pointing out all the directors’ failures in their function to hold the fiduciary duty to exercise their responsibility. Based on the analysis with the accordance with the framework used, it is highlighted that directors in the aspect of (1) governance decisive, they fail to set proportional target, provide ethical value, and react positively to maintain the company sustainability; (2) compliance submissive, they do not submit the accounting standards through undisclosed third-party agreement, misrepresentation of revenue recognition, and mistreatment of expense omission; (3) risk preventive, they fail to assess the risk occurs from legal aspect of conflict of interest, long-term contractual and engagement risks, and insufficient future cash flow. </p...|$|R
50|$|The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit {{noted that}} it would be {{impossible}} for the Sherman Act to prohibit every restraint of trade for that would even encompass employment contracts, which, by their nature, restrain the employee from working elsewhere while they are being paid to work for the employer.

5000|$|In the US, {{the first}} {{significant}} discussion occurred in the Sixth Circuit's opinion by Chief Judge (later US President and still later Supreme Court Chief Justice) William Howard Taft in United States v. Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. Judge Taft explained the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 as a statutory codification of the English common-law doctrine of restraint of trade, as explicated in such cases as Mitchel v Reynolds. The court distinguished between naked restraints of trade and those ancillary to the legitimate main purpose of a <b>lawful</b> <b>contract</b> and reasonably necessary to effectuation of that purpose. An example of the latter would be a non-competition clause associated with the lease or sale of a bakeshop, as in the Mitchel case. Such a contract should be tested by a [...] "rule of reason," [...] meaning {{that it should be}} deemed legitimate if [...] "necessary and ancillary." [...] An example of the naked type of restraint would be the price-fixing and bid-allocation agreements involved in the Addyston case. Taft said that [...] "we do not think there is any question of reasonableness open to the courts to such a contract." [...] The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment. During the following century, the Addyston Pipe opinion of Judge Taft has remained foundational in antitrust analysis.|$|E
40|$|Thesis(LL. M. (Labour Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. A {{temporary}} employment service (hereafter TES), {{also referred to}} as a labour broker is defined as a person or entity that provides workers to others, (their clients) to perform duties {{for the benefit of the}} client for compensation. The Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995 makes legal provision for a TES to exist. A threefold relationship between the TES and the client, and the TES and the worker is created. In this dissertation the relevant sections of the Labour Relations Act are examined and the agreements and the consequences that flow from the relationship that is created by this threefold relationship are discussed. The situation often occurs where workers are informed that their services are no longer required on a client’s site. No procedures for dismissals or retrenchment are followed. The worker is then under the impression that he or she has been dismissed. When the matter is referred to the Commission for Conciliation Mediation and Arbitration for adjudication, the client is cited as the employer. The application is then dismissed as the client is not the employer. The worker only has recourse against his employer, being the TES, and not a third party. This then leaves the worker confused and frustrated. Employees of TES typically work longer hours and are also underpaid. TES and their clients escape labour obligations and standards as their contracts allow for this. The question that arises is whether this situation is fair to the employees that are being subjected to this type of treatment which is justified by the contracts between the TES and the client, and the TES and the worker. The relationship is weighed against the provisions of the Constitution and the common law requirements for a <b>lawful</b> <b>contract.</b> A comparison with international standards as well as the legal position of TES in other countries is done to establish whether employees of TES in South Africa are treated fairly. The position will be studied further by examining the findings of courts and tribunals. Courts have begun to intervene and in decisions, that are discussed in the dissertation, the courts have found that the clauses in the contracts between the TES, its clients and the workers that allow for the “automatic dismissal” without having to follow the prescribed steps, are regarded as against public policy. It has also found that TES are not permitted to contract out of their obligations. The South African Government has introduced proposed amendments to the current labour legislation. These proposed amendments and the effect thereof on TES is studied to determine whether it will better the current issues experienced with TES. Trade unions in South Africa articulate their opinions regarding TES and push for the banning of the practice. The situation is more complicated; however, as a large number of people in South Africa are employed by TES and the TES assist them in finding work. When the situation is examined on the background of international standards, the ILO and the rights that are guaranteed to everyone in the Constitution, 1996, a complete ban will not be feasible as it will have an enormous effect on the South African employment sector. Regulation of the practice of TES is suggested as the most practicable solution to the problems that flow from TES contracts. The suggestion is that the clauses permitting the unlawful treatment of employees are deleted and sanctions for non–compliance with labour standards are implemented...|$|E

5000|$|Government {{procurement}} in the United States is {{the process}} by which the Federal Government of the United States acquires goods, services (notably construction), and interests in real property. Contracts for Government procurement usually involve appropriated funds spent on supplies, services, and interests in real property by and {{for the use of the}} Federal Government through purchase or lease, whether the supplies, services, or interests are already in existence or must be created, developed, demonstrated, and evaluated. See 48 C.F.R. § 2.101 ("Acquisition" [...] defined, as to goods and services only). Federal Government contracting has the same legal elements as contracting between private parties: a <b>lawful</b> purpose, competent <b>contracting</b> parties, an offer, an acceptance that complies with the terms of the offer, mutuality of obligation, and consideration. However, Federal contracts are much more heavily regulated, subject to volumes of statutes dealing with Federal contracts and the Federal contracting process, mostly in Titles 10, 31, 40, and 41 of the United States Code.|$|R
40|$|Cash Waqf is {{a viable}} form of Islamic {{endowment}} whose prime goal is providing relief to the less privileged citizens especially the Muslims in the society. Quite incontrovertibly, Waqf has inherent potential to ensure redistributive justice in the society given its numerous benefits. Waqf endowment provides human relief, dignity, financial support, and social needs to alleviate the struggles faced by needy Muslims such as poverty, unemployment, and lack of support. However, it is indeed ironical that despite Nigeria, an apparent Muslim dominated country, rich in both human and natural resources is still plagued by the social menace of poverty. Quite worrying is the intergenerational dimension {{that the incidence of}} the social menace of poverty is assuming in Nigeria. Educational and health problems are among other social problems confronting many Muslims in Nigeria. The rate of unemployment among the youths and adults is skyrocketing across the nation and contribute to the abject poverty. Many Muslim children, for example, are victims of exploitation, while some of them often work under unhealthy and hazardous conditions due to their parents’ inability to provide for their means of sustenance. The objective of this thesis is to examine the administration of Waqf in Nigeria from the existing legal provisions. To study the predicaments facing the Nigerian Muslims and how Islamic finance Waqf can be applied through the commercialization of cash Waqf and its implementation. In addition, it discusses how cash Waqf instrument can be used to empower lessprivileged Nigerian Muslims. It further discusses useful suggestions and solutions to the multifaceted problems facing Nigerian Muslims. The research applied qualitative and quantitative approaches to examine the applicability of commercialization of cash Waqf funds in Nigeria and its implementation. Three hundred questionnaires were distributed and collected between April and September, 2012 to Nigerian Muslims while nine iv Nigerians were selected based on expert sampling and interviewed on the commercialization of cash Waqf in Nigeria as an instrument for Nigerian Muslims empowerment. The thesis proposes strategies through which cash Waqf can be used for the creation of resources and tools for empowerment of less privilege Nigerian Muslims across the nation. The research is based on hypothesis that cash Waqf can play commendable efforts in empowering Nigerian Muslims through the <b>lawful</b> lucrative <b>contract</b> or transaction. It argues that cash Waqf can be used for educational funds, creation of employment opportunities, agriculture, and provision of tools for entrepreneurial activities. As a result, many Nigerian youths and adults would be fully empowered educationally, financially and socially. Finally, it is discovered from the findings that Waqf is viable and able to reduce poverty among less-privileged Nigerian Muslims. Similarly, there are many lucrative and profitable businesses and transactions that Waqf management can transact with cash Waqf endowment...|$|R
