40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to find the effects of Creatin Monohydrate (CrH 2 O) on athlete {{performance}} (isokinetic power measured as a total workout) used as an ergojenic aid in long-term (6 weeks) supplementation. There are 38 participants willing to join to the study. Their ages are between 20 and 27. All of them are choosed from active athletes. From the findings of this study; all the participants’ in the creatin group have increased the total workout production in all cycles of isokinetic exercise. The difference between the values in the first and fifth cycles, (both before and after loading) are statistically significant. In the creatin group the difference between before loading and 15 th day values are statistically significant. But the difference between before loading and 50 th day values does not have statistical difference. In placebo group, before and after values in all 5 cycles, there is no statistical difference between the total workout production values. There is also no statistical difference between the before loading and 15 th day values. As the same there is no statistical difference between the before loading and the 50 th day values. The most important finding in this study is that, there is no affect of long term creatin loading (50 days) on maximal voluntary knee extansion, as a total muscle workout values. But the change in values before <b>loading</b> <b>day</b> and 15 th day are significantly improved.

AOT products retrieved from POLDER on low aerosol <b>loading</b> <b>days,</b> and products from a radiometric instrument (MODIS) on high and low aerosol <b>loading</b> <b>days,</b> are presented for comparison. Our study reveals that for high aerosol days, the monitoring capability of the polarized instrument is lower than that of the traditional instrument. The accuracy of matched POLDER fine-AOTs is lower than that of MODIS-matched AOTs. On low aerosol <b>loading</b> <b>days,</b> the performance of the polarized instrument is good when monitoring the aerosol optical thickness. Further analysis reveals that for the high aerosol <b>loading</b> <b>days,</b> the mean relative errors of matched POLDER fine AOTs and MODIS AOTs with respect to AERONET measurements are 44 % and 16 %, respectively.

This investigation was designed to determine if muscle glycogen levels can be supercompensated utilizing {{a combination of a}} depletion-taper sequence and diets of 15 % carbohydrate (CHO, LC), 50 % CHO (M), and 70 % CHO (HC) in 3, 000 kcal. Each depletion-taper sequence was conducted on a treadmill at 73 % V 02 max and consisted of runs of 90, 40, 40, 20, 20 minutes and a day of rest on the six days prior to a 13 mile performance run. Trial C consisted of 3 days LC and 3 days HC; Trial B, consisted of 3 days M and 3 days HC; and Trial C, 6 days M. Muscle biopsies were obtained from the gastrocnemius prior to <b>loading</b> (<b>day</b> 4) and before and after the performance run. Trials A, B and C elevated muscle glycogen to 207, 203 and 160 mmoles/ kg wet tissue, respectively. Trials A and B resulted in significantly more glycogen utilization (105 and 107 mmoles/kg wet tissue, respectively) than did Trial C (65 mmoles/kg wet tissue). The times during the performance runs were not significantly different between the Trials. It is concluded that: 1. muscle glycogen levels can be supercompensated to levels comparable to previous investigations by employing a depletion-tapering sequence and less severe alteration in diet prior to competition; 2. carbohydrate loading is not necessary for trained runners preparing for a race of 13 miles.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} {{the timing of}} an applied strain influences callus morphology during bone fracture repair, and how this load effects the migration of systemically delivered mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to the fracture site. Six-month-old, male, Sprague-Dawley rats underwent a 2 mm segmental osteotomy in the mid-diaphysis of each femur. A two-piece external fixator with locking plate was fixed to each femur, an osteotomy created with an oscillating saw, and the surrounding tissues closed. Systemic injections of green fluorescent protein (GFP) labeled MSCs were performed via the tail vein on the first <b>loading</b> <b>day.</b> Axial mechanical stimulation occurred for five consecutive days at 0, 3, 10, or 24 days post-operative at a magnitude of ± 8 % strain and a rate of 0. 313 Hz for 510 cycles. Rats were euthanized 10, 24, or 48 days post-op. Through a micro-CT analysis, mineralization {{was found to be}} increased in animals that underwent the applied displacement at day ten when compared to the other groups. Histology showed that by day 48, these animals had almost no cartilage remaining, indicating advanced remodeling in comparison to other groups. The animals stimulated at day three showed the opposite trends, with less mineralization and larger, less remodeled calluses by day 48. Planar gamma imaging of 111 indium tagged MSCs showed that injected cells migrate from the lungs and liver, and a certain percentage of them are available to the limbs. Axial displacement created some difference in MSC migration to the limbs, but these disappeared by day three. As analyzed by immunohistochemistry, there were significant numbers of MSCs in the marrow spaces by day 48, and a qualitative analysis suggests that stimulation may encourage the cell to preferentially migrate. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array examined the genetic expression of 80 genes in the fracture gap tissue implicated in migration of MSC migration. It showed that the expression of many different genetic factors is influenced by mechanical stimulation. This effect also appears to not just be localized, but can be seen systemically as well. Overall, the timing of displacement had a significant effect on fracture healing, both locally and systemically...|$|E
40|$|The Wnt {{signaling}} pathway {{has been shown}} {{to play a role in}} bone homeostasis and carcinogenesis. On the one hand, a decrease in signaling has been associated with a decrease in bone mass, on the other, an increase in signaling with cancer development. LGK 974 is a Wnt signaling inhibitor currently being investigated as a potential cancer therapeutic agent. This molecule inhibits Porcupine, a transmembrane protein necessary for Wnt ligand secretion. In light of the above and based on our preliminary data, treatment with LGK 974 leads to bone mass loss. Our investigation aims to address whether such bone loss can be prevented by mechanically inducing stress to the bone during the treatment. We treated twelve 16 -week old C 57 Bl/ 6 J male mice with LGK 974 (chemical Porcupine inhibitor) and twelve with a vehicle (0. 5 % Methyl Cellulose, 0. 5 % Tween- 80 in water) on weekdays for two weeks. During that time, under isoflurane-induced anesthesia, all animals underwent right forearm mechanical loading at 60 cycles per day for 3 consecutive days using a 2 -Hz haversine waveform at a peak force of 2. 4 N. The non-loaded left forearm served as an internal control. Both loaded and control limbs were harvested 15 days post first <b>loading</b> <b>day</b> and processed for micro-computed tomography (microCT). Also, for dynamic histomorphometry (quantitative study of the microscopic organization and structure of the bone), we injected a small group of animals with two doses of 1 % calcein solution on two different days to allow for measurement of bone formation rate and matrix apposition rate (a measure of the amount of bone matrix deposited per osteoblast cluster). All procedures performed in this experiment were in accordance with the Van Andel Research Institute Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. So far, we have analyzed half of the collected ulnas, and even though, at this point, our results have not reached statistical significance, we see a trend of increased bone area, as well as cross sectional thickness in the loaded ulnas. We are currently in the process of analyzing the rest of the samples in order to determine if, all combined, our results reach statistical significance. If not, the next step would be processing the samples for histomorphometry. In conclusion, we have successfully established a mechanical ulnar loading model in order to study if mechanical loading can offset drug induced bone loss...|$|E

This paper presents a study of short-term load forecasting using neuro-fuzzy approach to electric load forecasting. The neuro-fuzzy is used to learn the relationship among past, current and future temperatures and loads. In order to provide the forecasted load, the neuro-fussy interpolates among the load and temperature data in a training data set. We analyze the problem domain and choose the most adequate set of attributes in our model. To obtain the best performance in prediction we follow an experimental approach analysing the entire neuro-fuzzy technique.
