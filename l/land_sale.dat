Bernier continues to sit as an MP, and is currently a candidate for the Conservative Party leadership. Stemming from Couillard's actions during the entire affair, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) launched investigations on how she obtained the secret documents; on whether Couillard's mother was offered a patronage appointment by a Conservative Party official to the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada; and on whether there was influence peddling during the <b>land</b> <b>sale</b> between the Kevlar Group and Public Works.|$|E

He removed a section of the fence for platform access after meeting with the MBTA, but disputed whether he was required to provide access and station facilities according to the terms of the 1960 <b>land</b> <b>sale.</b> Despite intervention by state legislators and a postcard campaign by residents, an agreement was not reached in 2014.
