40|$|An {{infinite}} Bernoulli-Euler beam (representing the “combined rail” {{consisting of}} the rail and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>sleeper)</b> mounted on periodic flexible point supports (representing the railpads) has already {{proven to be a}} suitable mathematical model for the floating ladder track (FLT), to define its natural vibrations and its forced response due to a moving load. Adopting deliberately conservative parameters for the existing FLT design, we present further results for the response to a steadily (uniformly) moving load when the periodic supports are assumed to be elastic, and then introduce the mass and viscous damping of the periodic supports. Typical support damping significantly moderates the resulting steady deflexion at any load speed, and in particular substantially reduces the magnitude of the resonant response at the critical speed. The linear mathematical analysis is then extended to include the inertia of the load that otherwise moves uniformly along the beam, generating overstability at supercritical speeds - i. e. at load speeds notably above the critical speed predicted for the resonant response when the load inertia is neglected. Neither the resonance nor the overstability should prevent the safe implementation of the FLT design in modern high speed rail systems. Roger J. Hosking and Fausto Milinazz...|$|E

5000|$|The {{earliest}} tracks {{consisted of}} wooden rails on transverse wooden sleepers, which helped maintain the spacing of the rails. Various developments followed, with cast iron plates laid {{on top of}} the wooden rails and later wrought iron plates or wrought iron angle plates (angle iron as L-shaped plate rails). Rails were also individually fixed to rows of stone blocks, without any cross ties to maintain correct separation. This system also led to problems, as the blocks could individually move. The first version of Isambard Kingdom Brunel's [...] broad gauge system used rails laid on <b>longitudinal</b> <b>sleepers</b> whose rail gauge and elevation were pinned down by being tied to piles (conceptually akin to a pile bridge), but this arrangement was expensive and Brunel soon replaced it with what became the classic broad gauge track, in which the piles were forgone and transoms, similar to sleepers, maintained the rail gauge. Today, most rail track uses the standard system of rail and sleepers; ladder track is used in a few applications.|$|R

5000|$|His name is {{identified}} with the introduction and development of tramways in Great Britain and Ireland; his first was a horse-tramway from Dublin to Black Rock. These early tramways were constructed with a shallow rail spiked to <b>longitudinal</b> wood <b>sleepers,</b> but Kincaid recognized the defects of this and introduced a metallic system, which became known by his name, consisting of channel shaped rails fixed on cast-iron chairs embedded in concrete.

50|$|The {{track gauge}} was 4 foot 8½ inches, {{intentionally}} to match {{that of the}} other Liverpool-Hull lines and that of the London-Birmingham and North Midland railways.

50|$|As built, {{the line}} had 43 bridges and around 16 level crossings. Ballast was of stone chips; the rails {{were held in}} place by keys lodged into iron chairs which rested on and were fixed to stone blocks or larch sleepers. On some parts of the line, a ladder track {{arrangement}} of sleepers was used, with <b>longitudinal</b> stone <b>sleepers</b> of 3 ft held in gauge by transverse cast-iron rods. T or bar-shaped malleable iron rails of 35 lb per yard (about 17.4 kgm−1) were initially used, within a few years 42 lb/yd (about 20.8kgm−1) rails were being introduced.|$|R
5000|$|The tunnel {{was built}} in a shallow trench of 4 ft in depth; the {{contemporary}} illustration (right) showing the line disappearing beneath the landscape {{seems to be no}} more than artistic licence although, as built, earth may have been drawn up around the structure. In the tunnel the bridge-profile rails were on <b>longitudinal</b> <b>sleepers</b> whereas in the platform sections conventional [...] cross sleepers were used. Rammell included a curve of 8 chain m radius and a gradient of 1 in 15 (7 per cent) to demonstrate the capabilities of his design. The power was provided by a large fan, some 22 ft in diameter, like a paddle-wheel in an iron case (see image) that was powered at 300rpm by a former steam locomotive, mounted on a plinth, acting through leather belts. [...] The carriage at the upper terminus was allowed to enter the tunnel under its own weight, when [...] "a pair of iron doors, hinged like lock gates" [...] was closed behind it. Air at a pressure of [...] "2&frac12; ounces per square inch" [...] was then admitted through a grating, propelling the vehicle to the other terminus. As the vehicle approached the lower terminus it was slowed by a short, uphill section of track and the release of the propelling air pressure as it passed a grating open to the atmosphere; the only intervention required from the operator was the application of the brake.|$|R
50|$|Brunel {{also looked}} at novel track forms, and decided to use a {{continuously}} supported rail. Using longitudinal timbers under each rail, he achieved a smoother profile while not requiring such a strong rail section, and he used a shallow bridge rail for the purpose. The wider, flat foot also meant that the chair needed by the bullhead section could be dispensed with. The longitudinal timbers needed to be kept at the proper spacing to retain the gauge correctly, and Brunel achieved this by using timber transoms - transverse spacers - and iron tie-bars. The whole assembly {{was referred to as}} the baulk road - railwaymen usually call their track a road. Initially, Brunel had the track tied down to timber piles to prevent lateral movement and bounce, but he had overlooked the fact that the made ground, on which his track was supported between piles, would settle. The piles remained stable and the ground between them settled so that his track soon had an unpleasant undulation, and he had to have the piles severed, so that the track could settle more or less uniformly. A variant of the baulk road can still be seen today on many older under-bridges where no ballast was provided. The design varies considerably, but in many cases longitudinal timbers are supported directly on the cross-girders, with transoms and tiebars to retain the gauge, but of course with modern rails and base-plates or chairs. The <b>longitudinal</b> <b>sleepers</b> are somewhat similar to modern-day Ladder track.|$|R

The gauge is preserved by angle iron cross-ties, nine feet apart; and a strip of wood has been inserted between the rails and sleepers to prevent rigidity. This description of permanent way has been already tried on the Bristol & Exeter Railway, and with such success as to induce the Company to lay down an additional portion of it.|$|R
