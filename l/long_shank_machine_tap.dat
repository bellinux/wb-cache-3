End-plate connection with using superelastic <b>long</b> <b>shank</b> SMA bolts is proposed in this paper. By using strong beam-weak bolt cluster design methodology and special configurations to strength beam ends, a superelastic hinge is expected to form in column flange. To validate the mechanical behavior of the proposed beam-to-column connection, both quasi-static tests and numerical analysis are conducted with cyclic transverse loads applied on the beam ends. The results indicate the connection deformations concentrate on the <b>long</b> <b>shank</b> SMA bolts upon loading and the bolt cluster rotates around the axis near beam flange. By using the super elastic effect, the SMA bolts recover most elongations and the connection recovers to its original shape after experiencing 0. 02 rad interstorey drift angle.

40|$|International audiencePrevious {{research}} on the standard <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> {{has shown that the}} impact on a floor depends strongly on the combined system of floor and tapping hammers. This means that in general, a particular measure to reduce the impact sound pressure level can be advantageous with one impact source and disadvantageouswith another. Conversion from one impact source to another has to be made for each floor individually, provided there is a sufficient knowledge of the dynamic properties of the source and floor. So, if the standard <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> is to be used to characterise a floor with respect to walking noise, the only simple way out of the problem is to make it 'behave like a walker'. That means it should have the same source impedance. Investigations at the Fraunhofer-Institut für Bauphysik Stuttgart showed that this could be achieved by small modifications to the standard <b>tapping</b> <b>machine.</b> Comparisons using a concrete floor and a wooden joist floor have proved that results using such a modified <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> are much closer to walking noise than the results using the standard <b>tapping</b> <b>machine...</b>|$|R

40|$|Impact sound {{insulation}} {{is one of}} the most important aspects when assessing {{sound insulation}} of floor constructions in buildings. For assessing the impact sound insulation of aconstruction, a standard <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> is used as a sound source. However, the use of the current standard <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> has been criticised, especially with regard to measurement of wooden joist floors since the noise spectrum generated by a <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> differs from the spectrum generated by actual footfall. There are insufficient low frequency components in the noise spectrum produced by the <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> and it does not, therefore, accurately reflect low frequency noise from the construction. Reduce impact sound level from wooden joist floors are the main object of our study. It is important to be able to predict the sound insulation properties of wooden joist constructions at the design stage. To reduce the noise level in the receiving room, the input power transmitted through the construction must be estimated where the appropriate sound- and vibration-insulation can be designed. This study has investigated the waveform and frequency spectra of human footfall (walking, rum- ingand jumping); of the dropping of sand balls, sand bags and tires; and of the standard <b>tapping</b> <b>machine.</b> The impact sound power radiation from a wooden joist construction while applying different impact sources, such as actual footfall and the standard <b>tapping</b> <b>machine,</b> have also been studied.

The characteristics with regard to mechanical properties of floor construction was calculated using the impedance method. The impact sound level inside the sound receiving room was determined.
