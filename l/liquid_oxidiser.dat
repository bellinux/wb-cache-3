50|$|In its {{simplest}} form {{a hybrid}} rocket {{consists of a}} pressure vessel (tank) containing the <b>liquid</b> <b>oxidiser,</b> the combustion chamber containing the solid propellant, and a mechanical device separating the two. When thrust is desired, a suitable ignition source is introduced in the combustion chamber and the valve is opened. The liquid propellant (or gas) flows into the combustion chamber where it is vaporized and then reacted with the solid propellant. Combustion occurs in a boundary layer diffusion flame adjacent {{to the surface of}} the solid propellant.|$|E
40|$|Worldwide, {{the hybrid}} rocket {{propulsion}} technology gained in importance recently. A new innovative hybrid rocket engine concept is {{developed at the}} German Aerospace Center (DLR) within the program “AHRES”. This rocket engine is based on hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene with metallic additives as solid fuel and rocket grade hydrogen peroxide (high test peroxide: HTP) as <b>liquid</b> <b>oxidiser.</b> Instead of a conventional ignition system, a catalyst chamber with a silver mesh catalyst is designed, to decompose the HTP to steam and oxygen at high temperatures up to 615 °C. The newly modified catalyst chamber is able to decompose up to 1. 3 kg/s of 87, 5...|$|E

40|$|Regression ra tes of a hypergolic {{combination}} {{of fuel and}} oxidiser have been experimentally measured {{as a function of}} chamber pressure, mass flux and the percentage component of the hypergolic compound in natural rubber. The hypergolic compound used is difurfurylidene cyclohexanone (DFCH) which is hypergolic with the oxidiser red fuming nitric acid (RFNA) with ignition dela y of 60 - 70 ms. The data of weight loss versus time is obtained for burn times varying between 5 and 20 seconds. Two methods of correlating the data using mass flux of oxidiser and the total flux of hot gases have shown that index n of the regression law r=aGoxn or r=aGnxn- 1 (x the axial distance) is about 0. 5 or a little lower and not 0. 8 even though the flow through the port is turbulent. It is argued that the reduction of index n is due to heterogeneous reaction between the <b>liquid</b> <b>oxidiser</b> and the hypergolic fuel component on the surface...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. For soft {{landing on}} the moon or Mars deep-throttling rocket engines are an {{essential}} technology requirement. Highly reliable engines {{could be used for}} ascent as well as descent. A simple engine cycle with no required turbo machinery and without the thermal stresses of a regeneratively cooled combustion chamber can potentially achieve this reliability. The German Aerospace Center (DLR) currently develops a partially ceramic injector head. The current test bench version INJEX 01 (INJector EXperiment) consists of concentric circular slits. The slits are alternating open (for use of gaseous fuel) and closed and filled with porous ceramics (for use of <b>liquid</b> <b>oxidiser).</b> The walls of the open slits can be axially moved, thus making the channel wider or narrower. Each slit may be operated individually. Thereby the mass flow through the injector can be regulated and the thrust can be modified. The paper focuses on the injector as a core component of an engine with deep throttling capability. It provides an overview over the current injector concept INJEX 01. The current status and recent experimental results are described. This paper addresses near term feasibility and long term application scenarios of this engine concept, based on technology currently under development at the DLR...|$|E
40|$|Student Number : 0105159 R - MSc(Eng) Dissertation - School of Electrical and Information Engineering - Faculty of Engineering and the Built EnvironmentThis {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} design of a re-usable rocket for use in triggered-lightning experiments. It is intended that the rocket will tow a thin wire to sufficient height so that the lightning mechanism will attach onto the wire and follow it to ground. The rocket design is inherently safe as it does not use explosive materials for its propulsion system, and hence conforms to South African explosive legislation. The designed rocket consists of a hybrid motor, which uses a solid combustion chamber and <b>liquid</b> <b>oxidiser</b> rather than solid motors which use a single solid fuel or a liquid motor which uses two liquid propellants. The mechanical performance of the oxidiser stage is critical in containing the pressurised oxidiser and regulating the flow of the oxidiser into the combustion chamber. The design of the combustion chamber and {{the rate at which the}} solid material burns is key to the generation of the pressure which is expelled through the nozzle to produce thrust. The design of the nozzle is covered in which the material from which it is made must withstand temperatures in excess of 1600 ◦C. The entire system was modelled to calculate the parameters of the various subsystems. The simulation study shows that the rocket will be able to reach 1 km with a complete section of wire towed behind it. A cost analysis, against other commercial rocket systems, was performed. The analysis concludes from the total cost of ownership that it is significantly cheaper to operate the designed rocket, over the course of the experiment, than other rocket systems...|$|E

40|$|After briefly {{outlining}} {{the recent developments}} in hybrid rockets, the work {{carried out by the}} author on self-igniting (hypergolic) solid fuel-liquid oxidiser systems has been reviewed. A major aspect relates to the solid derivatives of hydrazines, which have been conceived as fuels for hybrid rockets. Many of these N-N bonded compounds ignite readily, with very short ignition delays, on coming into contact with <b>liquid</b> <b>oxidisers,</b> like HNO 3 and N 2 O 4. The ignition characteristics have been examined {{as a function of the}} nature of the functional group in the fuel molecule, in an attempt to establish a basis for the hypergolic ignition in terms of chemical reactivity of the fuel-oxidiser combination. Important chemical reactions occurring in the pre-ignition stage have been identified by examining the quenched reaction products. Hybrid systems exhibiting synergistic hypergolicity in the presence of metal powders have been investigated. An estimation of the rocket performance parameters, experimental determination of the heats of combustion in HNO 3, thermal decomposition characteristics, temperature profile by thin film thermometry and and product identification by the rapid scan FT-IR, are among the other relevant studies made on these systems. A significant recent development has been the synthesis of new N-N bonded viscous binders, capable of retaining the hypergolicity of the fuel powders embedded therein as well as providing the required mechanical strength to the grain. Several of these resins have been characterised. Metallised fuel composites of these resins having high loading of magnesium are found to have short ignition delays and high performance parameters...|$|R

25|$|From September 1953 onwards, {{both the}} Avro 720 and the SR.53 {{projects}} were subject increasingly levels of scrutiny amid an overall requirement within the Ministry to implement cuts {{in order to}} reduce costs. However, the Avro 720 was dealt an effective death blow when the Screamer rocket engine which powered the interceptor was cancelled during late 1956. Reportedly, official concerns regarding the practicality of using liquid oxygen, which boils at -183°C (90 K) and is a fire hazard, within an operational environment had heavily contributed to the Screamer's cancellation. The loss of the main engine in turn ultimately led to the termination of the Avro 720. One {{of the reasons for the}} Ministry's preferment of the SR.53, despite its development programme being comparatively behind and having suffered greater delays, was its rocket engine's use of hydrogen peroxide as an oxidiser had been viewed as less problematic than the Screamer's <b>liquid</b> oxygen <b>oxidiser,</b> and the Ministry did not want to support two separate rocket fuel programmes.|$|R
