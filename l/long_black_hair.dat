5|$|Anggun's {{image has}} been {{compared}} to that of Pocahontas. At the early stage of her career as a rock singer, Anggun was known for her tomboy look—wearing a crooked beret, shorts, studded jacket, and large belt; this set a trend during the early 1990s. Later, she has focused on femininity and sexuality, emphasising her <b>long</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> and brown skin. For this look she utilises the work of fashion designers like Azzedine Alaïa, Dolce & Gabbana, and Roberto Cavalli. In 2001, Anggun was dubbed as the sixth Sexiest Women of Asia by FHM magazine. Later in 2010, she was ranked at number 18 on the French version of FHMs list of 100 Sexiest Women in the World.|$|E
5|$|Munch (Richard Belzer) is {{reluctant}} {{to follow up on}} the case of murdered drug addict Jenny Goode, who was run over by a car. The case has been cold for three months, but he is made to feel guilty by his partner Bolander (Ned Beatty) into reexamining it. Munch makes no progress after speaking with the family and reexamining notes. Based on witness accounts of a man with long blond hair and a black car, Munch spends all night looking through suspect photos until he finds a man with a black car with front end damage and <b>long</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair,</b> but blond eyebrows. Munch and Bolander question him, believing the suspect (Joe Hansard) to have dyed his hair to change his appearance after killing the woman. He quickly confesses to having hit her accidentally while driving drunk.|$|E
5|$|The Malaysian Penanggalan is a {{woman who}} {{obtained}} her beauty through the active use of black magic or other unnatural means, and is most commonly described in local folklore to be dark or demonic in nature. She is able to detach her fanged head which flies around in the night looking for blood, typically from pregnant women. Malaysians hung jeruju (thistles) around the doors and windows of houses, hoping the Penanggalan would not enter for fear of catching its intestines on the thorns. The Leyak is a similar being from Balinese folklore of Indonesia. A Kuntilanak or Matianak in Indonesia, or Pontianak or Langsuir in Malaysia, {{is a woman}} who died during childbirth and became undead, seeking revenge and terrorising villages. She appeared as an attractive woman with <b>long</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> that covered a hole {{in the back of her}} neck, with which she sucked the blood of children. Filling the hole with her hair would drive her off. Corpses had their mouths filled with glass beads, eggs under each armpit, and needles in their palms to prevent them from becoming langsuir. This description would also fit the Sundel Bolongs.|$|E

25|$|Despite exotic {{claims of}} her nationality, she was later {{identified}} as one Émilie Poupon of Nantey, France. This image—an enticing woman with <b>long,</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> {{and a large}} snake slithering up between her breasts—apparently caught the imaginations of the Africans who saw it; it was the definitive image of the spirit. Before long, Mami Wata posters appeared in over a dozen countries. People began creating Mami Wata art of their own, much of it influenced by the lithograph.|$|E

500|$|The video {{begins with}} Aguilera {{wearing a black}} velvet kimono, with a pale {{complexion}} and <b>long</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair,</b> refers to a larva. Initially, she is trapped in a glass box, and her kimono is billowing like a balloon. Three Gothic ballerinas eat fruit and then collapse. Aguilera then breaks free from the box by pounding on it until it shatters. She furiously removes three moth pins from her back, and then tosses aside her kimono. A tattered, white, moth-covered dress is revealed, symbolizing her metaphoric evolution from the larva to a pupa. In addition, her hair becomes white, and moths fly around her. Near the end, Aguilera wears an Elvira-type spider dress, again proclaiming {{that she is a}} [...] "fighter".|$|E

500|$|Mouton {{broke off}} her {{contract}} with Audi in late 1985 to join Peugeot {{for the coming}} season. She contested the German Rally Championship and two WRC events in a Peugeot 205 Turbo 16, with which the marque had captured last year's world titles. To replace the newly-wed Pons, Mouton recruited Terry Harryman who had been left jobless after Ari Vatanen's accident. Mouton, nicknamed [...] "der schwarze Vulkan" [...] (The Black Volcano) due to her temperament and <b>long</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair,</b> won six of the eight events in the German championship, including the Rallye Deutschland. Although the Hessen Rallye was stopped after the severe accident of Formula One driver Marc Surer, which claimed the life of his co-driver Michel Wyder, Mouton was declared the winner. She secured the German national title on the seventh and penultimate round, the Sachs Baltic, after taking her fifth win of the season. She became the first female driver {{to win a major}} championship in rallying.|$|E

500|$|Vincent {{is shown}} as a tall, lean {{young man with}} <b>long</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> and a ragged red cloak and mantle over black underclothes. He wears a metallic, golden {{gauntlet}} on his left forearm. Vincent's cloak covers {{the lower half of}} his face and is held closed by a series of buckles. His eyes are naturally red. His crimson cloak was added to symbolize the idea of Vincent carrying a heavy weight connected to death. While other characters were given simple costumes in Advent Children, Vincent was given something more complex. Nomura felt that changing his design to something complicated would [...] "conflict with his personality," [...] which is relatively straightforward, and he was thus given attire consisting of [...] "various, complex parts." [...] His cloak was difficult to animate due to it being very organic; the overall complexity of Vincent's design led to his scenes being [...] "especially hard to create." [...] These scenes were constantly being adjusted so as [...] "to convey [...] elusive nature of seemingly having shape, but not." [...] These adjustments concluded six months before the films completion.|$|E
500|$|Vocalist MayKay {{has been}} {{described}} as one of Ireland's [...] "most mesmerising front women" [...] in recent history, with her <b>long</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> and banshee wail provoking male fans to confess simultaneous feelings of terror and attraction online. She is known to vociferate lyrics such as [...] "you're like Kentucky Fried Chicken but without the taste" [...] and [...] "you're a fucking disappointment to the human race", taken from the song [...] "Jake Summers", a song inspired by former teen idol of California Dreams fame. Pockets writes most of the band's songs, plays the keyboard and provides vocals for some of the band's songs. Adrian and Tom tend to remain in the background, choosing not to be photographed. The band have never written anything fictional and their lyrics have been described by Nadine O'Regan in The Sunday Business Post as [...] "occasionally literally gynaecological in their detail and regularly relatively shocking in their honesty". MayKay and Pockets claim that most of their lyrics are shaped by one person who has broken each of their hearts.|$|E

500|$|Having just {{recently}} animated two previous Disney heroines – Ariel from The Little Mermaid and Belle from Beauty and the Beast, respectively – Henn initially {{suffered from a}} severe case of [...] "artist's block" [...] while attempting to design his third heroine, Jasmine. While working on the character at Disney-MGM Studios in Florida, Henn noticed a young female amusement park guest with <b>long</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair,</b> and ultimately decided to use her as his initial inspiration for Jasmine; the guest's identity remains anonymous to-date. Earliest sketches of Jasmine were based on various exotic-looking supermodels {{in addition to her}} namesake Jasmine Guy, but the actress' facial features were ultimately considered to be too [...] "severe" [...] for an animated character. In search of [...] "something fresh to help with the physical look of her", Henn was eventually inspired by a high school graduation photograph of his younger sister Beth Allen, who wore her hair in a style similar to what would ultimately become Jasmine's. Henn credits his sister with helping him overcome his artist's block, and the directors ultimately approved of Henn's concept design. The character's facial features were further inspired by actress Jennifer Connelly, specifically her eyebrows. Additionally, some of Larkin's own mannerisms and physical traits were incorporated into the character. Henn credits one particular dinner conversation he had shared with Larkin with proving very inspirational in terms of helping him discover Jasmine's emotional side.|$|E
