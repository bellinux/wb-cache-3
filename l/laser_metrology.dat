Efficient nonlinear photonic chips have myriad applications including high speed optical signal processing, on-chip multi-wavelength <b>lasers,</b> <b>metrology,</b> molecular spectroscopy, and quantum information science. Aluminium gallium arsenide (AlGaAs) exhibits very high material nonlinearity and low nonlinear loss when operated below half its bandgap energy. However, difficulties in device processing and low device effective nonlinearity made Kerr frequency comb generation elusive.

A baseline design for a Lunar Optical Interferometer (LOI) which exploits these features is presented. The instrument operates in the visible to mid-IL region, and is designed for both astrometry and synthesis imaging. The design uses a Y-shaped array of 12 siderostats, with maximum arm lengths of about 1 km.
