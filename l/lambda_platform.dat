50|$|The {{automotive}} {{press has}} speculated that some GMT900 SUV models may {{move to the}} GM <b>Lambda</b> <b>platform.</b>|$|E
50|$|The GMT 960 {{series are}} based on the GM <b>Lambda</b> <b>platform,</b> and hence are unibody {{vehicles}}, rather than vehicles with frames, and are unrelated to the GMT 900 series.|$|E
50|$|The 2009 Saturn {{models were}} the Sky roadster, the AURA sedan, the Astra hatchback, the VUE small {{crossover}} SUV and the Outlook full-size crossover SUV built off the GM <b>Lambda</b> <b>platform.</b>|$|E
50|$|C1XX is the {{crossover}} {{variant of}} the E2XX platform, replacing the Theta Premium and <b>Lambda</b> <b>platforms.</b> It underpins the 2017 Cadillac XT5 and soon to be followed the 2017 GMC Acadia in regular wheelbase form, while the 2018 Chevrolet Traverse and 2018 Buick Enclave will utilize the long wheelbase variant.|$|R
5000|$|Lambda {{vehicles}} feature {{easily accessible}} three-row seating. They were supplied with the LY7 3.6-liter V6. Starting with the 2009 model year all Lambda vehicles have GM LLT 3.6-liter {{gasoline direct injection}} engine for improved fuel efficiency, horsepower and torque. With the cancellation of GM's next-generation DOHC V8, it appears unlikely that GM will offer a V8 engine for <b>Lambda.</b> The <b>platform</b> has been designed for front and all-wheel drive applications.|$|R
40|$|When {{developing}} mobile applications, {{the tradition}} {{has been to}} write code specific (native) for each platform they are running on. Usually itâ€™s about writing two separate applications for the biggest platforms, Android and iOS. There exist alternatives to this approach that uses the same code for different platforms. React Native {{is a relatively new}} cross-platform development framework that makes it possible to use the same code for application to Android and iOS. It also uses native UI-elements as a possible solution for performance issues that is often associated with cross-plattform development. This thesis evaluates React Native and compares it against native Android. The implementation is done by replicating the main functionality from a social media application written as a native Android application. However, the application is not made as an exact replica since that could limit the solutions in React Native. The evaluation is done in a Startup company and therefore focuses on aspects important in a Startup. Another issue when developing a mobile application is what type of backend that shall be used. Performance, scalability and complexity are all important aspects when choosing a framework or language as a base for the backend architecture. There do exist theoretical frameworks that could be used when building the backend. However, these frameworks require resources that are often missing in a Startup. AWS <b>Lambda</b> is a <b>platform</b> that claims to be a cost-effective way of building a scalable application. In this thesis AWS Lambda is evaluated to see if {{it can be used to}} create an automatically scaled backend for this type of social media application. The conclusion of the React Native evaluation is that it can be a suitable alternative to native Android development. If the team has previous experience in web development but lack experience in mobile application development it can be a wise choice since it removes the need to learn two frameworks in native Android and native iOS development. React Native is also good to fast create functional prototypes which can be shown to potential investors. The biggest drawback is performance in animations. However, there are often ways to work around that. In our case this drawback did not affect the user experience of the end application. The evaluation of AWS Lambda concludes that it is not for every project. In this thesis, the application was a bit too database heavy and therefore the autoscaling ability did not work properly. However, for a service that needs a lot of computing power, AWS Lambda could be a good fit. It could also be a suitable alternative if someone in the team has previous experience in the AWS environment...|$|R
50|$|GM was {{considering}} replacing the U-body minivans with new minivans using the <b>Lambda</b> <b>platform</b> for the 2009 model year, {{but due to}} the decline of minivan sales the plan was cancelled.|$|E
50|$|The GMT 201 {{names are}} applied to the GM U-based minivans. These include the Chevrolet Uplander, Pontiac Montana SV6, Buick Terraza and Saturn Relay. North American vans were phased out in 2005 with the {{introduction}} of vehicles based on the GM <b>Lambda</b> <b>platform.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Chevrolet Traverse is a {{full-size}} crossover SUV built by General Motors. The Traverse {{is built on}} the GM <b>Lambda</b> <b>platform</b> that is also used on the GMC Acadia and on the Buick Enclave. It is the successor to the Chevrolet Uplander, the Chevrolet TrailBlazer, the Chevrolet HHR, the Chevrolet Astro (passenger van), and the Saturn Outlook.|$|E
50|$|The GMT 510 series were to {{be based}} on the GM <b>Lambda</b> <b>platform,</b> and hence are unibody {{vehicles}}, rather than vehicles with frames, and are unrelated to the GMT 530/560 series. They would have complemented the GMT 960 series, which are Lambda sport wagons. Due to poor sales of all U-Body vans, this series has been cancelled.|$|E
5000|$|The Ascender ended {{production}} on June 6, 2008, {{as part of}} Isuzu's withdrawal from the United States market. [...] The Ascender (along with the related GMC Envoy) were both replaced by the 2010 GMC Terrain, based on the GM Theta platform. 7-passenger versions of both SUVs were indirectly replaced by the GMC Acadia in 2007, based on the GM <b>Lambda</b> <b>platform.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Buick Enclave is a {{full-size}} luxury crossover SUV launched in 2007. The Enclave, the GMC Acadia, and Chevrolet Traverse all share the GM <b>Lambda</b> <b>platform.</b> The Enclave was previewed at the 2006 North American International Auto Show, officially {{as a concept}} car, making it the first Lambda vehicle to be displayed. The Enclave is partially based on the Buick Centieme concept shown at the 2003 Detroit Auto Show.|$|E
50|$|Prior to GM's 2009 bankruptcy, all GMT 360 {{products}} were discontinued and the Moraine, Ohio plant {{that produced the}} GMT 360 series was closed. Simultaneous with the cancellation of the GMT 360 program, development of the GMT 361 replacements were also suspended. A new body-on-frame midsize SUV retaining the Chevrolet TrailBlazer name and built in Thailand was launched {{as part of the}} GMT 700 program; however, it will not be sold in North America, as the GM <b>Lambda</b> <b>platform</b> crossovers fill the market's need.|$|E
50|$|The Saturn Outlook is a {{full-size}} crossover SUV that debuted at the New York International Auto Show, and {{was based on}} the GM <b>Lambda</b> <b>platform,</b> which it shared with the Buick Enclave, Chevrolet Traverse and GMC Acadia. The Outlook went on sale on May 24, 2006 as a 2007 model. The Outlook featured the lowest sticker price among GM's Lambda crossover SUVs, slotting below the GMC Acadia and Buick Enclave. The Chevrolet Traverse would ultimately take the place of the Outlook as the family-oriented model following the introduction of the Traverse for the 2009 model year, and the demise of the Outlook, {{along with the rest of}} the Saturn brand in 2010, with the 2010 model year being the final model year for the Outlook. The Saturn Outlook was discontinued after the 2010 model year.|$|E
50|$|The GMC Acadia is a {{mid-size}} crossover SUV (full-size until 2016) from GMC. The {{first generation}} GMC Acadia shared the GM <b>Lambda</b> <b>platform</b> with the Chevrolet Traverse, and Buick Enclave. The Acadia {{went on sale}} in 2006 as a 2007 model in the United States and in Canada. The Acadia replaces three of the 7- or 8-seater vehicles on the Pontiac-Buick-GMC dealership network, the mid-size GMC Safari van, the GMC Envoy, and the Pontiac Montana SV6 minivan for the domestic market. As of 2009, the Lambda vehicles have replaced the Buick Rainier, Buick Rendezvous, and the Buick Terraza, and then subsequently the GMC Envoy and the Chevrolet TrailBlazer. A Denali version of the Acadia debuted in 2010 as a 2011 model. In 2016, the second generation Acadia was repositioned as a mid-size crossover utility vehicle (as a 2017 model) in order to compete within the growing mid-size CUV market against the likes of the Ford Edge and Dodge Journey.|$|E
40|$|Lambda {{architecture}} {{is a novel}} event-driven serverless paradigm that allows companies to build scalable and reliable enterprise applications. As an attractive alternative to traditional service oriented architecture (SOA), Lambda architecture {{can be used in}} many use cases including BI tools, in-memory graph databases, OLAP, and streaming data processing. In practice, an important aim of Lambda&# 039;s service providers is devising an efficient way to co-locate multiple Lambda functions with different attributes into a set of available computing resources. However, previous studies showed that consolidated workloads can compete fiercely for shared resources, resulting in severe performance variability/degradation. This paper proposes a resource allocation mechanism for a <b>Lambda</b> <b>platform</b> based on the model predictive control framework. Performance evaluation is carried out by comparing the proposed solution with multiple resource allocation heuristics, namely enhanced versions of spread and binpack, and best-effort approaches. Results confirm that the proposed controller increases the overall resource utilization by 37 % on average and achieves a significant improvement in preventing QoS violation incidents compared to others...|$|E
