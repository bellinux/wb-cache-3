5|$|In his writing, Su Song credited, as the {{predecessor}} of his working clock, the hydraulic-powered armillary sphere of Zhang Heng (78–139 AD), an earlier Chinese scientist. Su Song was also {{strongly influenced by}} the earlier armillary sphere created by Zhang Sixun (976 AD), who also employed the escapement mechanism and used liquid mercury instead {{of water in the}} waterwheel of his astronomical clock tower (since liquid mercury would not freeze during winter and would not corrode and rust metal components over time). However, Su Song stated in his writing that after Zhang's death, no one was able to replicate his device, much <b>like</b> <b>his</b> <b>own.</b>|$|E
5|$|Michael (Steve Carell) {{wants to}} throw a party to {{celebrate}} his fifteenth anniversary working at Dunder Mifflin. He becomes unnerved when Charles Miner (Idris Elba), the new company vice president, exhibits a no-nonsense attitude towards him, making Michael not feel <b>like</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> boss. Charles seems to establish {{a good relationship with}} the rest of the staff; he buys everyone lunch and reveals the truth about their 401(k) plans and the possibility of layoffs, which Michael withheld so as not to worry the staff. Taking advice from Chief Financial Officer David Wallace (Andy Buckley), Michael tries to become better acquainted with Charles, but is unsuccessful. Michael attempts to contact Wallace on the phone, one attempt leading to getting transferred to Charles. When Charles catches the Party Planning Committee planning Michael's party during office hours, he dissolves the committee and cancels Michael's party. Michael decides to drive to New York to talk to Wallace.|$|E

25|$|If Captain Lynch {{had known}} that the Federal fleet faced a {{shortage}} of ammunition very much <b>like</b> <b>his</b> <b>own,</b> he perhaps would have altered his tactics, although the outcome would likely have been the same. As it was, Rowan ordered the captains in his fleet to conserve their ammunition. They were told to use ramming and boarding, so far as was possible, to disable or capture the enemy ships.|$|E
25|$|To {{consolidate}} {{his political}} power in the Équateur Province, Bolikango summoned a congress to Lisala that lasted from 24 March to 3 April. <b>Like</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> party, the other political groups of the Équateur lacked the necessary support to make significant gains in the upcoming independent elections. Bolikango was eager to win a prominent government office and aimed to form a broad coalition with the Ngombe, Mongo, and Ngwaka peoples and other minorities in the province to achieve it. This could be best accomplished, in his view, through an alliance of his own groups, the FUB and ASSORECO, with UNIMO, FEDUNEC, UNILAC, and local chiefs who had not already put their support behind the PNP.|$|E

25|$|Following World War II, the character's {{popularity}} {{began to}} fade along with {{the decline of the}} Golden Age of Comic Books, leading to cancellation. After 12 years out of print, DC chose to reinvent Green Lantern as science fiction hero Hal Jordan in 1959. Later, DC would again revisit Alan Scott, establishing that Alan and Hal were the Green Lanterns of two different parallel worlds, with Alan residing on Earth-Two and Hal on Earth-One. Stories set on Earth-Two thereafter showed that Alan became the father to two superheroic children, the twins Obsidian and Jade, each with powers a bit <b>like</b> <b>his</b> <b>own.</b> When in 1985 DC chose to reboot its internal continuity, it merged the worlds of Earth-One and Earth-Two, and Alan was again reimagined as an elder statesman of the DC Universe, the magical Green Lantern of an earlier generation who coexists with the more science fiction-oriented heroes of the Green Lantern Corps. When DC brought back its internal Multiverse concept in the 2000s, it reintroduced a new, young version of Alan on the new Earth-Two, this time as a gay man and the owner of a media conglomerate whose magical powers stem from his role as champion of the Green, an entity embodying plant life on Earth.|$|E
500|$|Conspiracy {{theories}} circulated {{about the}} suicide, with some holding that Colt {{had in fact}} escaped from prison and staged a body to look <b>like</b> <b>his</b> <b>own.</b> One publication alleged that a family member smuggled the knife used in the suicide into his cell. [...] Others stated that Colt was living in California with his wife, Caroline. [...] None of these allegations were ever proven. Edgar Allan Poe may have based a short story, [...] "The Oblong Box", partly on the murder of Adams, and Herman Melville alluded to the case in his novella [...] "Bartleby, the Scrivener".|$|E

500|$|In a {{memorial}} volume {{published by the}} Mises Institute, Rothbard's protégé and libertarian theorist Hans-Hermann Hoppe wrote that the work Man, Economy, and State [...] "presented a blistering refutation of all variants of mathematical economics," [...] and included it [...] among Rothbard's [...] "almost mind-boggling achievements". Hoppe lamented that, <b>like</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> mentor Ludwig von Mises, Rothbard died without winning the Nobel Prize that Hoppe says Rothbard deserved [...] "twice over." [...] Though Hoppe acknowledged that Rothbard and his work were largely ignored by academia, he called Rothbard an [...] "intellectual giant," [...] comparable to Aristotle, Locke and Kant.|$|E
500|$|Ravel was not by {{inclination}} a teacher, {{but he gave}} {{lessons to}} a few young musicians he felt could benefit from them. Manuel Rosenthal was one, and records that Ravel was a very demanding teacher when he thought his pupil had talent. <b>Like</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> teacher, Fauré, he was concerned that his pupils should find their own individual voices and not be excessively influenced by established masters. He warned Rosenthal {{that it was impossible}} to learn from studying Debussy's music: [...] "Only Debussy could have written it and made it sound like only Debussy can sound." [...] When George Gershwin asked him for lessons in the 1920s, Ravel, after serious consideration, refused, on the grounds that they [...] "would probably cause him to write bad Ravel and lose his great gift of melody and spontaneity". The best known composer who studied with Ravel was probably Ralph Vaughan Williams, who was his pupil for three months in 1907–08. Vaughan Williams recalled that Ravel helped him escape from [...] "the heavy contrapuntal Teutonic manner... Complexe mais pas compliqué was his motto." ...|$|E
2500|$|George Adamski, {{who later}} became {{probably}} the most prominent contactee of the UFO era, was one contactee with an earlier interest in the occult.

Greater Manchester Police reported that his identity had been confirmed {{as a result of}} a DNA match with a relative and said that Lytton [...] "was a bit of a loner" [...] and that [...] "he <b>liked</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> company". <b>His</b> family was informed and a full inquest was scheduled for 14 March 2017.|$|R

60|$|Lytton {{returned}} to and elaborated his {{idea in the}} Margrave of A Strange Story, who has no 'soul,' and prolongs his physical and intellectual life {{by means of an}} elixir. Margrave is not bad, but he is inferior to the hero, less elaborately designed, of The Haunters and the Haunted. Thackeray's tale is written in a tone of mock mysticism, but he confesses that he <b>likes</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> story, in which the strange hero, through all his many lives or reappearances, and through all the countless loves on which he fatuously plumes himself, retains a slight German-Jewish accent.|$|R
5000|$|A liberated {{person is}} Jivanmukta, states the text, and is {{characterized}} by one who is untouched whether joy or grief befalls him, doesn't get angry at anyone or anything, neither is mean to anyone nor fears anyone, is free from desire and non-desire, is introverted and <b>likes</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> company, is silent and without arrogance, acts without envy or agitation, is detached and functions without cravings, is quiet and calm, active and full in spirit. He is self-restrained, driven by inquiry, in company of good people, studies the Shastras, asks, [...] "Who am I? How did Samsara develop?" [...] The drink of immortality for him, states the Upanishad, is his delight in the Self (soul, Atman), experiencing the joy of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> inner awareness and nature.|$|R
2500|$|Under {{the care}} of Rodríguez-Zocca's family, Reverón {{established}} {{a close relationship with}} Josefina, the daughter of the couple, and came to appreciate her <b>like</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> sister. The walls of the house were some of the first paintings of Reverón, where he attempted to portray the family maid, Juanita Carrizales. Rodríguez-Zocca's described Reverón´s temperament as [...] "sad, angry and melancholic".

2500|$|Glover is an only child, born in New York City, {{and moved}} to Los Angeles with his family {{at the age of}} five. His father is actor Bruce Glover and his mother, Mary Elizabeth Lillian Betty Krachey (née Bloom Koerber), was an actress and dancer who retired upon his birth. He was named after the Saint Crispin's Day speech from William Shakespeare's play Henry V, which his parents enjoyed.

2500|$|Thus, a {{few years}} later, Hazltt saw fit to {{conclude}} his assessment of the [...] "spirit of the age" [...] with a nod to Knowles. Acknowledging his long friendship with the dramatist, he puts forth his belief that Knowles's Virginius is [...] "the best acting tragedy that has been produced on the modern stage." [...] Knowles himself is [...] "the first tragic writer of the age" [...] because he keeps his ego out of his plays; following no rules and having read few plays, he has observed closely what little of life he has experienced, and then, aided by the practice of having been an actor himself, he focuses intensely on his subject and pours into his plays the [...] "impulses of [...] natural feeling, and produces a perfect work of art." [...] On a personal basis, Hazlitt concludes, the man is so self-effacing that you {{would never be able}} to connect his plays with his personality without knowing the fact that he is their author. In a brief version of the kind of personal focus he adds to most of the essays in The Spirit of the Age, Hazlitt reflects that, when not focused on his drama, Knowles lives a retired life: he modestly [...] "divides his time and affections between his plots and his fishing tackle, between the Muses' spring, and those mountain-streams which sparkle <b>like</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> eye, that gush out <b>like</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> voice at the sight of an old friend." ...|$|E
