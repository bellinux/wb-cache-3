40|$|AbstractThe rate of iron {{release from}} HepG 2 liver cells was {{increased}} {{not only by}} extracellular apotransferrin, but also by diferric transferrin, in a non-additive, concentration-dependent manner and to a similar magnitude. This suggests that rapid equilibration between receptor-mediated uptake and the release process determines net iron retention by the liver. Release was also accelerated by ceruloplasmin; most importantly, {{the effect of this}} protein was greatest when iron release was occurring rapidly, stimulated by apotransferrin, or under conditions of <b>limited</b> <b>oxygen.</b> Thus iron release involves both apotransferrin and ferrotransferrin, with ceruloplasmin playing a role in tissues with <b>limited</b> <b>oxygen</b> supply, as in the liver in vivo...|$|R

40|$|The {{cardiorespiratory}} {{responses to}} maximal treadmill exercise were compared in matched groups {{of patients with}} chronic renal anaemia or treated chronic heart failure, and in normal controls. Exercise capacity was similarly reduced in both patient groups compared to normal controls, the raised respiratory exchange ratio at peak exercise implying anaerobic metabolism due to <b>limited</b> <b>oxygen</b> delivery in heart failure and <b>limited</b> <b>oxygen</b> carrying capacity in anaemia. Minute ventilation (VE) was related linearly to minute CO 2 production (VCo 2) in all subjects (each r> 0. 92) from all three groups.

30|$|Respiratory {{muscle fatigue}} appears {{to result from}} {{increased}} respiratory muscle work combined with competition with the locomotor muscles of the limbs for blood flow (Romer and Polkey 2008). Additionally, respiratory muscle fatigue can increase sympathetic vasoconstrictor outflow to the working skeletal muscles through a respiratory muscle metaboreflex (Katayama et al. 2012). Legrand et al. (2007) reported that an accelerated drop in accessory respiratory muscle oxygenation {{was related to the}} attenuated fall in leg muscle oxygenation detected with NIRS in heavy exercise. These data suggest that the high oxygen requirement of respiratory muscle leads to <b>limited</b> <b>oxygen</b> use by locomotor muscles (Legrand et al. 2007). Thus, IM work might <b>limit</b> <b>oxygen</b> use by the locomotor muscles (Katayama et al. 2012; Legrand et al. 2007; Romer and Polkey 2008).|$|R

50|$|A {{property}} of a material {{needed to be}} considered before putting it into application is flammability, which demonstrates how easily one material can ignite and combust under the realistic operating conditions. This may affect its application in varied areas, such as in construction, plant design, and interior decoration. The quantitative assessment of flammability is based on <b>limiting</b> <b>oxygen</b> index(LOI), i.e., the minimum oxygen concentration at which a given sample can be induced to burn permit a comparison of flammability. Data show that PBI are highly flame resistant material compared to common polymers.|$|E
50|$|The heat {{stability}} of raw PVC is very poor, so {{the addition of}} a heat stabilizer during the process is necessary in order to ensure the product's properties.

50|$|In other areas, the {{operation}} resulted in improved data or reduced uncertainties. The 233U capture-to-fission ratio {{in a typical}} MSR neutron spectrum {{is an example of}} basic data that was improved. The effect of fissioning on the redox potential of the fuel salt was resolved. The deposition of some elements (ânoble metalsâ) was expected, but the MSRE provided quantitative data on relative deposition on graphite, metal, and liquid-gas interfaces. Heat transfer coefficients measured in the MSRE agreed with conventional design calculations and did not change {{over the life of the}} reactor. <b>Limiting</b> <b>oxygen</b> in the salt proved effective, and the tendency of fission products to be dispersed from contaminated equipment during maintenance was low.|$|E
40|$|During diving, {{marine mammals}} must balance the {{conservation}} of <b>limited</b> <b>oxygen</b> reserves with the metabolic costs of swimming exercise. As a result, energetically efficient modes of locomotion provide an advantage during periods of submergence and will presumably increase in importance as the animals perform progressively longer dives. To {{determine the effect of}} a <b>limited</b> <b>oxygen</b> supply on locomotor performance, we compared the kinematics and behavior of swimming and diving bottlenose dolphins. Adult bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) were trained to swim horizontally near the water surface or submerged at 5 m and to dive to depths ranging from 12 to 112 m. Swimming kinematics (preferred swimming mode, stroke frequency and duration of glides) were monitored using submersible video cameras (Sony Hi- 8) held by SCUB...|$|R
40|$|The {{protein kinase}} PknI {{is one of}} 11 {{functional}} serine/threonine protein kinases in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

The pknI mutant grows better under acidic pH and <b>limited</b> <b>oxygen</b> availability. We observed a modest increased growth of pknI mutant within macrophages during an in vitro infection and a hypervirulence phenotype in severe combined immunodeficiency mice. The internal signals used to activate PknI are most likely the host-associated signals such as low pH associated with <b>limited</b> <b>oxygen</b> availability.

50|$|In {{addition}} to being a carbon fiber precursor, Oxidized PAN Fiber is also used to produce inherently flame resistant (FR) fabrics. Commonly when it is used in FR fabrics for protective apparel it is referred to as OPF (Oxidized Polyacrylonitrile Fiber) and is a high-performance & cost-effective flame and heat resistance solution. OPF can be {{considered one of the most}} FR fabrics commercially produced since it has an LOI (<b>Limiting</b> <b>Oxygen</b> Index) in the range of 45%-55% which is one of the highest LOI ranges available as compared with other common FR fabrics which have lower LOI values (e.g. Nomex @ 28%-30%, Kevlar @ 28%-30%, Modacyrlic @ 32%-34%, PBI @ 41%, and FR-Viscose @ 28%); and OPF also demonstrates the lowest toxic gas generation upon burning as compared with other common fabrics (e.g. Nomex, FR Polyester, and Cotton).|$|E
50|$|Vinyl siding {{features}} a chlorine base, making it inherently slow to ignite and flame retardant. All organic materials (that is, anything containing carbon) will ignite, but {{the higher the}} temperature a material has to reach before it flames, the safer it is. PVC wonât ignite, even from another flame, until it reaches about 730Â°F (387Â°C) and wonât self-ignite until about 850Â°F (454Â°C). Those ignition temperatures are significantly higher than common framing lumber, which ignites from a flame at 500Â°F (260Â°C) and self-ignites at 770Â°F (410Â°C). Also, ASTM D2863 tests show that rigid PVCâs high <b>Limiting</b> <b>Oxygen</b> Index means that it needs unusually high amounts of oxygen to burn and stay burning. Rigid PVC (vinyl siding) will not independently sustain combustion in air with a normal concentration of oxygen (about 21 percent) â so it extinguishes more easily.|$|E
50|$|Suicide by {{suffocation}} is {{the act of}} inhibiting one's {{ability to}} breathe or <b>limiting</b> <b>oxygen</b> uptake while breathing, causing hypoxia and eventually asphyxia. This may involve an exit bag (a plastic bag fixed over the head) or confinement in an enclosed space without oxygen. These attempts involve using depressants to make the user pass out due to the oxygen deprivation before the instinctive panic and the urge to escape due to the hypercapnic alarm response.It is impossible for someone to commit suicide by simply holding their breath, {{as the level of}} oxygen in the blood becomes too low, the brain sends an involuntary reflex, and the person breathes in as the respiratory muscles contract.

5000|$|The partner choice {{hypothesis}} {{proposes that}} the plant uses prenodulation signals from the rhizobia {{to decide whether to}} allow nodulation, and chooses only noncheating rhizobia. There is evidence for sanctions in soybean plants, which reduce rhizobium reproduction (perhaps by <b>limiting</b> <b>oxygen</b> supply) in nodules that fix less nitrogen. Likewise, wild lupine plants allocate fewer resources to nodules containing less-beneficial rhizobia, limiting rhizobial reproduction inside. This is consistent with the definition of sanctions, although called [...] "partner choice" [...] by the authors. However, other studies have found no evidence of plant sanctions, and instead support the partner choice hypothesis. While both mechanisms no doubt contribute significantly to maintaining rhizobial cooperation, they do not in themselves fully explain the persistence of the mutualism. The partner choice hypothesis is not exclusive from the host sanctions hypothesis, as it is apparent that both of them are prevalent in the symbiotic relationship.|$|E

Back inside the Dome, the few people remaining discover that someone they trusted isn't who they appeared to be, and as a result, they destroy the mysterious egg, which is the Dome's power source. Everyone outside the Dome is actually revealed to have been trapped in weird cocoons, and when the egg is destroyed, they escape from the cocoons to find out the year they lived was completely false; an alternate reality created by [...] "The Kinship", an alien civilization. The Kinship takes over the minds and bodies of the townspeople, turning them into emotionless robot-like individuals with a shared goal to take over Chester's Mill, and then the whole Earth, for the purpose of evolving and spreading their civilization after their home planet was destroyed. With only very few people not having entered the alternate reality and not having been cocooned, a war inside the Dome is set up between The Kinship and the so-called Resistance.
