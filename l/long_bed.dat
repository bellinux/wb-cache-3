5|$|Commercially, {{the song}} topped the Polish and Slovakian charts, {{achieved}} the top-five in Australia, Austria, Czech Republic and Portugal, while also reaching the top-ten in Germany, New Zealand, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and others. In the United States, {{it reached the}} top-forty on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and topped the Dance Club Songs. The accompanying music video for the track was directed by Rihanna's longtime collaborator and director Anthony Mandler. Its tropical and romantic setting features an eighteen foot <b>long</b> <b>bed</b> designed specifically for the video. Rihanna promoted the track with live performances at the ACM Awards, along with Sugarland front woman Jennifer Nettles, {{as well as on}} American Idol, NBC's Today show, and on her Loud Tour (2011). The song is a playable track in the video game Guitar Hero Live.|$|E
25|$|Women {{were the}} primary vehicle for rumors that touched upon issues of family and {{everyday}} life. Fears that collectivization {{would result in the}} socialization of children, the export of women’s hair, communal wife-sharing, and the notorious common blanket affected many women, causing them to revolt. For example, when it was announced that a collective farm in Crimea would become a commune and that the children would be socialized, women killed their soon-to-be socialized livestock, which spared the children. Stories that the Communists believed short hair gave women a more urban and industrial look insulted peasant women. After local activists in a village in North Caucasus actually confiscated all blankets, more fear dispersed among villagers. The common blanket meant that all men and women would sleep on a seven-hundred meter <b>long</b> <b>bed</b> under a seven-hundred-meter long blanket. Historians argue that women took advantage of these rumors without actually believing them so they could attack the collective farm “under the guise of irrational, nonpolitical protest.” Women were less vulnerable to retaliation than peasant men, and therefore able to get away with a lot more.|$|E
