40|$|Based on the {{decoupled}} {{control method}} of levitation and thrust {{forces in a}} single-sided linear induction motor (SLIM), a compact combined-levitation-and-propulsion SLIM Maglev vehicle can be realized without any additional levitation magnet. When the vehicle runs, the <b>levitation</b> <b>and</b> <b>propulsion</b> forces varies depending on the phase of primary current because of the short primary end effect. Especially the fluctuation of the levitation force causes the vertical vibration of the vehicle. To realize a high performance <b>levitation</b> <b>and</b> <b>propulsion</b> control by only SLIM, these fluctuations must be restrained. In this paper, <b>levitation</b> <b>and</b> <b>propulsion</b> forces were analyzed by using space harmonic analysis method and combined-levitation-and-propulsion control taking the fluctuation of the <b>levitation</b> <b>and</b> <b>propulsion</b> forces into consideration was proposed.

Intensive studies involving MagLev trains using superconductivity have been carried out in Japan since 1970. The construction of a 43 km long track is to be the next step. In 1991 a six year programme was launched in the United States to evaluate the performances of MagLev systems for transportation.

40|$|A {{new concept}} in Urban Maglev {{transportation}} design {{is in the}} testing phase. The vehicle uses permanent magnets (PM) for both the electro-dynamic suspension (EDS) and linear synchronous motor (LSM) propulsion. Because of the 3 D coupled non-linear velocity-dependent magnetic levitation, the LSM must provide stabilizing forces to the vehicle. To do this, Vector Control is used to modulate the inverter voltage, frequency and angle. The inverter angle is adjusted to maintain vertical stability. The controls architecture was developed and tested in a 2 D simulation and verified in a 3 D six dof dynamic model of the vehicle and guideway; the same magnetic <b>levitation</b> <b>and</b> LSM <b>propulsion</b> algorithms were used in both with the 2 D simulation model providing the common control system. Control programming was implemented in C-code, which talks to the inverter pulse width modulation (PWM) card via an intermediate control box.

This paper presents its stable levitation control in repulsive-mode underwater during standstill. The repulsive-mode levitation can be realized under a condition that the buoyancy of the water is smaller than {{the weight of the}} vehicle, which means that the ME 02 can simulate the ME running on land. Because ME 02 is a combined <b>levitation</b> <b>and</b> <b>propulsion</b> system, positioning control at a demand standstill-point is simultaneously carried out by the help of thrust force to levitate steadily at the standstill point.

40|$|With the {{ever-increasing}} cost {{of getting}} to space {{and the need for}} safe, reliable, and inexpensive ways to access space, NASA is taking a look at technologies that will get us there. One of these technologies is Magnetic Launch Assist (MagLev). This is the concept of using both magnetic <b>levitation</b> <b>and</b> magnetic <b>propulsion</b> to provide an initial velocity by using electrical power from ground sources. The use of ground based power can significantly reduce operational costs over the consumables necessary to attain the same velocity. The technologies to accomplish this are both old and new. The concept of MagLev {{has been around for a}} long time and several MagLev Trains have already been made. Where NASA's MagLev diverges from the traditional train is in the immense power required to propel this vehicle to 600 feet per second in less than 10 seconds. New technologies or the upgrade of existing technologies will need to be investigated in areas of energy storage and power switching. Plus the separation of a very large mass (the space vehicle) and the aerodynamics of that vehicle while on the carrier are also of great concern and require considerable study and testing. NASA's plan is to mature these technologies in the next 10 years to achieve our goal of launching a full sized space vehicle off a MagLev rail...|$|R

As the United States of America accounts for over 75 % of global space spending, we focus on the impact of its internal policy and legislation such as the International Traffic in Arms Regulations and the United States munitions list that have a direct impact on collaborative and cooperative efforts made by public and private entities within the United States. The thesis goes on to describe how a new global space policy for civil and commercial projects could potentially pave the way for new avenues of collaboration and inclusion of actors who for the time being are unable to participate in the space arena either due to lack of available funds or technology inputs.

40|$|The NASA John H. Glenn Research Center has {{developed}} a revolutionary 32 in. diameter Levitated Ducted Fan (LDF) conceptual design. The objective of this work {{is to develop a}} viable non-contact propulsion system utilizing Halbach arrays for all-electric flight, and many other applications. This concept will help to reduce harmful emissions, reduce the Nation s dependence on fossil fuels, and mitigate many of the concerns and limitations encountered in conventional aircraft propulsors. The physical layout consists of a ducted fan drum rotor with blades attached at the outer diameter and supported by a stress tuner ring at the inner diameter. The rotor is contained within a stator. This concept exploits the unique physical dimensions and large available surface area to optimize a custom, integrated, electromagnetic system that provides both the <b>levitation</b> <b>and</b> <b>propulsion</b> functions. The rotor is driven by modulated electromagnetic fields between the rotor and the stator. When set in motion, the time varying magnetic fields interact with passive coils in the stator assembly to produce repulsive forces between the stator and the rotor providing magnetic suspension. LDF can provide significant improvements in aviation efficiency, reliability, and safety, and has potential application in ultra-efficient motors, computers, and space power systems...|$|E
40|$|Draper Laboratory, {{with its}} {{internal}} {{research and development}} budget, has {{for the past two}} years been funding a joint effort with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for the development of a large scale, high speed wheel test facility. This facility was developed to perform experiments and carry out evaluations on <b>levitation</b> <b>and</b> <b>propulsion</b> designs for MagLev systems currently under consideration. The facility was developed to rotate a large (2 meter) wheel which could operate with peripheral speeds of greater than 100 meters/second. The rim of the wheel was constructed of a non-magnetic, non-conductive composite material to avoid the generation of errors from spurious forces. A sensor package containing a multi-axis force and torque sensor mounted to the base of the station, provides a signal of the lift and drag forces on the package being tested. Position tables mounted on the station allow for the introduction of errors in real time. A computer controlled data acquisition system was developed around a Macintosh IIfx to record the test data and control the speed of the wheel. This paper describes the development of this test facility. A detailed description of the major components is presented.

It's ability to deliver satellites at reasonable costs has made us dependent on this delivery mechanism to fulfill our daily tasks, be it communications, satellite navigation, visual entertainment or weather forecasting. Scientifically, advances in rocketry have enabled us to view the ever-expanding universe. It's most significant impact however {{comes in the form of}} manned spaceflight vehicles such as the Space Shuttle, Soyuz and now Space Ship One. A significant development is greater commercialization of manned rocketry, helping provide widespread access to space. Most rocket designs use some form of chemical propellant as their dominant fuel source, primarily as combustion of these propellants provides ample power at limited costs. However, over the last decade as the price of chemical propellants continues to soar and their detrimental effect on our environment comes to light, there has been significant interest in developing an alternative propulsion mechanism to power a new generation of space vehicles.
