5|$|Author Robert Rodriguez {{writes that}} {{the content of the}} five <b>loops</b> has {{continued}} to invite debate among commentators, however, and that the manipulation applied to each of the recordings has made them impossible to decipher with authority. Based on the most widely held views, he says that, aside from McCartney's laughter and the B flat major chord, the sounds were two <b>loops</b> of sitar passages, both reversed and sped up, and a loop of Mellotron string and brass voicings. In their book Recording the Beatles, Kevin Ryan and Brian Kehew list two <b>loops</b> of sitar recordings yet, rather than Mellotron, list a mandolin or acoustic guitar, treated with tape echo.|$|E
5|$|Over its history, US27 {{had several}} {{business}} <b>loops</b> associated with it. Since {{the conversion of}} the highway into a freeway starting in the 1950s, these business <b>loops</b> served Marshall, Charlotte, Lansing, St. Johns, Ithaca, Alma, St. Louis, Mount Pleasant, Clare and Harrison. The business <b>loops</b> north of Lansing were redesignated as business <b>loops</b> of US127 in 2002 while the Charlotte loop had been reassigned BL I-69 with the completion of I-69 through the area. In addition, Michigan had a US27A designation through Alma and a Truck US27 in Lansing.|$|E
5|$|After {{handling}} audio engineering for {{the recording}} of Achtung Baby, Robbie Adams was invited by U2 to manage sound mixing on the Zoo TV Tour. Adams also recorded the group's tour soundchecks. In January 1993, the band asked him to compile these recordings and create <b>loops</b> of interesting parts that they could play to in the studio. After Adams spent a few weeks assembling <b>loops,</b> the group entered The Factory in Dublin that February to begin composing rough demos. Bono and The Edge were most involved during this initial demoing process, which lasted six weeks.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, US27 was shifted {{to run through}} St. Louis instead of Alma, and the former route was renumbered US27A. US127 was realigned near Mason in the mid-1940s, and a {{business}} loop was created out of the former routing there. A similar bypass of Jackson in the late 1950s also spawned a business loop. In the early 1960s, a new expressway (later freeway) for US27 through Central Michigan {{led to the creation}} of several business <b>loops.</b> Other bypasses opened in the 1980s and 1990s and created the last two business <b>loops.</b> The 2002 extension of US127 to replace US27 also led to the redesignation of business <b>loops</b> to their current monikers.|$|E

30|$|The {{current of}} TCC <b>loop</b> or OCS-R <b>loop</b> is {{inversely}} proportional to the <b>loop</b> impedance. From the above analysis about the wave impedance, it can be inferred that the TCC <b>loop</b> impedance will be {{much smaller than the}} OCS-R <b>loop</b> impedance and the current in TCC will be larger. Moreover, if OCS-R <b>loop</b> is imputed to TCC <b>loop</b> side, the imputed impedance modulus value of OCS-R <b>loop</b> will be the square of its turn ratio. For example, when the TT primary voltage is 35  kV, its turn ratio would be no less than 10 if the chosen OCS voltage does not exceed 3.5  kV, and the impedance modulus value of TCC <b>loop</b> will be less than 1  % of the impedance modulus value of OCS-R <b>loop</b> imputed to TCC <b>loop</b> side. The OCS-R <b>loop</b> between two nearest TTs can be called short <b>loop</b> (the i-th segment in Fig.  2). And the parallel connection of the TCC <b>loop</b> and the OCS-R <b>loop</b> from the short <b>loop</b> to the main traction busbar can be called long <b>loop</b> (from the 1 st to the (i −  1)th segments in Fig.  2). If so, the short <b>loop</b> will take the train load while the OCS on the long <b>loop</b> will hardly bear any burden for power supply (less than 1  %). The TCC on the long <b>loop</b> will bear almost all power supply burden (larger than 99  %). That is, the OCS on the short <b>loop</b> is mainly responsible for the power supply of the train in the current segment, and the TCC on the long <b>loop</b> is responsible for the power supply of the entire traction network.|$|R

5|$|The tape <b>loops</b> {{were played}} on BTR3 tape {{machines}} located in various studios of the Abbey Road building {{and controlled by}} EMI technicians in Studio Two at Abbey Road on 7 April. Each machine was monitored by one technician, who had to hold a pencil within each loop to maintain tension. The four Beatles controlled the faders of the mixing console while Martin varied the stereo panning and Emerick watched the meters. Eight of the tapes were used at one time, changed halfway through the song. The tapes were made (like {{most of the other}} <b>loops)</b> by superimposition and acceleration. According to Martin, the finished mix of the tape <b>loops</b> could not be repeated because of the complex and random way in which they were laid over the music.|$|E
5|$|There are {{currently}} eight business routes of Interstate 94 (I-94) in the US state of Michigan. These business routes connect I-94 to the downtown business districts of neighboring cities. These eight routes are all business <b>loops</b> which bear the Business Loop I-94 (BL I-94) designation. These <b>loops</b> are former routings of I-94's two predecessors in Michigan: US Highway12 (US12) or US25.

The <b>loops</b> in Kalamazoo, Battle Creek, Marshall, Albion, and Jackson were also formerly segments of US12 which were later designated as separate version of Business US Highway12 (Bus. US12) through their respective cities before becoming BL I-94s in 1960. The route of the business loop through Ann Arbor was previously US12 and then later M-14 before receiving its current moniker.
