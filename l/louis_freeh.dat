5|$|David Kaczynski {{had once}} admired and {{emulated}} his older brother, but had later {{decided to leave}} the survivalist lifestyle behind. He had received assurances from the FBI that he would remain anonymous and that his brother would not learn who had turned him in, but his identity was leaked to CBS News in early April 1996. CBS anchorman Dan Rather called FBI director <b>Louis</b> <b>Freeh,</b> who requested 24 hours before CBS broke the story on the evening news. The FBI scrambled to finish the search warrant and have it issued by a federal judge in Montana; afterwards, an internal leak investigation was conducted by the FBI, but the source of the leak was never identified. In 1996 the Evergreen Park Community High School was also placed on lockdown while FBI agents searched Kaczynski's school records. At the end of that school day, students were greeted by reporters asking how they felt about going to the same high school the Unabomber had attended. That night the news story was released to public.|$|E

50|$|Corbett {{convened a}} grand jury in 2009 to {{investigate}} longstanding allegations {{of child sexual abuse}} by former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky. The grand jury uncovered evidence of criminal misconduct, and a 40-count indictment against Sandusky was issued in 2011, ultimately leading to Sandusky's criminal conviction in 2012. Corbett has been criticized for the three year time span between the grand jury investigation and Sandusky's indictment, and for his gubernatorial staff approving a $3 million grant to Sandusky's Second Mile charity for children, which, according to the grand jury findings, served as a repository for potential sex-abuse victims. Former FBI Director <b>Louis</b> <b>Freeh's</b> report on the Penn State scandal did not fault Corbett's handling of the Sandusky case.|$|R

25|$|Giuliani {{spoke in}} support of the removal of the People's Mujahedin of Iran (MEK, also PMOI, MKO) from the United States State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations. The group was on the State Department list from 1997 until September 2012. They were placed on the list for killing six Americans in Iran during the 1970s and {{attempting}} to attack the Iranian mission to the United Nations in 1992. Giuliani, along with other former government officials and politicians Ed Rendell, R. James Woolsey, Porter Goss, <b>Louis</b> <b>Freeh,</b> Michael Mukasey, James L. Jones, Tom Ridge, and Howard Dean, were criticized for their involvement with the group. Some were subpoenaed during an inquiry about who was paying the prominent individuals' speaking fees. Giuliani and others wrote an article for the conservative publication National Review stating their position that the group should not be classified as a terrorist organization. They supported their position by pointing out that the United Kingdom and the European Union had already removed the group from their terrorism lists. They further assert that only the United States and Iran still listed it as a terrorist group. However, Canada did not delist the group until December 2012.|$|E
25|$|Shortly before 10 a.m. on June 25, 1996, {{members of}} a {{terrorist}} group detonated a truck bomb outside building 131 (also known as Khobar Towers) of the King Abdul Aziz Air Base. Inside the building were almost exclusively members of the US Air Force who were there to patrol the southern Iraqi no-fly zone enacted after the Gulf War. In the attack, 19 US military personnel and a Saudi local were killed and 372 were wounded, making this the most deadly terrorist attack on Americans abroad since the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing. <b>Louis</b> <b>Freeh</b> said in his book My FBI that he felt the deepest about the Khobar Towers investigation, {{and it was not}} until his last day in office, June 21, 2001, a federal grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia returned a 46-count indictment against 14 defendants charged with the Khobar Towers attack. This was just before some of the counts would have expired due to a five-year statute of limitations. In the book, Freeh maintains that he was obstructed by the Clinton Administration for political reasons in investigating the bombing and bringing the terrorists to justice.|$|E
500|$|On June 18, 1996, Attorney General Janet Reno {{asked the}} FBI {{to look into}} it; FBI Director <b>Louis</b> <b>Freeh</b> {{acknowledged}} that both the FBI and especially the White House had committed [...] "egregious violations of privacy" [...] (in some cases the background reports contained information about extramarital affairs, trangressions with the law, and medical issues). On June 21 Reno decided it was {{a conflict of interest}} for the U.S. Department of Justice to further investigate the matter, and thus recommended that it be folded into the overall umbrella of the Whitewater investigations, under charge of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. In any case, Starr had already begun looking into it.|$|E
5000|$|On May 17, 2002, {{the court}} rebuffed Attorney General John Ashcroft, {{releasing}} an opinion that {{alleged that the}} FBI and Justice Department officials had [...] "supplied erroneous information to the court" [...] in more than 75 applications for search warrants and wiretaps, including one signed by FBI Director <b>Louis</b> J. <b>Freeh.</b> Whether this rejection {{was related to the}} court starting to require modification of significantly more requests in 2003 is unknown.|$|R

500|$|There was {{controversy}} as {{to whether}} the document should be published, but the Department of Justice headed by Attorney General Janet Reno, along with FBI Director <b>Louis</b> <b>Freeh,</b> recommended publication out of concern for public safety and in hopes that a reader could identify the author. Bob Guccione of Penthouse volunteered to publish it, but Kaczynski replied that, since Penthouse was less [...] "respectable" [...] than the other publications, he would in that case [...] "reserve the right to plant one (and only one) bomb intended to kill, after our manuscript has been published." [...] The pamphlet was published by The New York Times and The Washington Post on September 19, 1995. Penthouse never published it.|$|E

In so doing, Freeh stated that the most senior leaders at Penn State showed a [...] "total disregard for the safety and welfare of Sandusky's child victims" [...] for 14 years and [...] "empowered" [...] Jerry Sandusky to continue his abuse.|$|E
2500|$|A {{subcommittee}} of the Board of Trustees engaged former FBI director <b>Louis</b> <b>Freeh</b> to head an independent investigation on the university's handling of the incidents.

After the application of the Levi guidelines, only eight groups were classified as requiring full investigation. Of them, five were based in Puerto Rico and besides the EPB also included the FARP, FALN, COR and MLN.

According to an unsigned {{article in the}} Los Angeles Times, Los Macheteros was “a terrorist group seeking Puerto Rico's independence.” The group campaigned for, and supported, the independence of Puerto Rico from the United States. In 2001, FBI Director <b>Louis</b> J. <b>Freeh</b> claimed the group was linked to acts of terrorism, but Ronald Fernandez, scholar of Puerto Rican history, suggests such labeling {{was an act of}} political convenience by the United States Government, intended to [...] "shift the blame for any attacks on U.S. policy or personnel from us to them". [...] Ríos was also a founder of the FALN. In a 1983 New York Times article, Robert McFadden described the FALN as a Puerto Rican terrorist organization responsible for bombings during the 1970s and early 1980s [...] "in the name of Puerto Rican independence".|$|R
