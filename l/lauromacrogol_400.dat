40|$|BACKGROUND: Visual and {{neurological}} disturbances {{have always}} been reported following liquid sclerotherapy (LS) for venous insufficiency. In 1993 Cabrera introduced foam sclerotherapy (FS) using a detergent sclerosant as <b>Lauromacrogol</b> <b>400</b> or sodium tetradecyl sulphate. Several authors have reported with FS an increased incidence of such transient visual disturbances and neurological complications. This {{has been associated with}} gas or air used to generate the sclerosing foam. The frequent association of the presence of a patent foramen ovale, a common condition in normal population, and such complications has led several authors to consider neurological and visual disturbances as paradoxical gas embolism. OBJECTIVE: We are introducing a new pathogenetic hypothesis for sclerotherapy complications. Medical literature shows evidence of a clear relationship among cerebral and retinal vasospasm, migraine and intimal irritation. We think that the irritating sclerosant agent may stimulate a significant release of vasoactive substances from the venous wall, specifically endothelin 1 (ET- 1), the most powerful vasoconstricting agent. METHOD: We have studied systemic ET- 1 levels after LS and FS with <b>Lauromacrogol</b> <b>400</b> in a group of 13 rats at one and five minutes after injection. RESULTS: While ET- 1 levels did not change significantly in control and in the LS group, a significant increase was detected after FS at one and five minutes. CONCLUSION: We conclude that should the same results be found in patients treated using sclerosing foam (SF), ET- 1 levels may closely correlate to the onset of visual or cerebral complications. Due to the bronchoconstrictor activity of ET- 1, a relationship with post-treatment cough can be also postulated...|$|E
40|$|Background: Foam {{sclerotherapy}} {{has been}} {{proven to be a}} safe and effective treatment for superficial venous insufficiency, but transient visual and neurological disturbances continue to be reported. These side effects have been postulated {{to be related to the}} presence of air or gases in the sclerosing foam. We present a differing hypothesis where significant Endothelin release from the treated varices is capable of generating such complications. Material and methods: we have tested the release of Endothelin 1 in 12 rats where a sclerotherapy was performed with liquid or foamed sodium tetradecylsulphate. Moreover we have measured Endothelin 1 in the systemic circulation and in a draining vein from the treated area in a group of 11 patients treated with foam sclerotherapy with <b>Lauromacrogol</b> <b>400</b> Results: Rats treated with STS showed significant increase in ET 1 levels at 1 and five minutes after foam sclerotherapy. Patients treated with foam sclerotherapy showed significant increase in ET 1 levels and this significantly correlated with local ET 1 levels. Conclusions: Evidence of Endothelin 1 release after sclerotherapy represents a plausible relationship explaining neurological and visual disturbances...|$|E
