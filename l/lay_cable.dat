50|$|Modern cable ships differ {{greatly from}} their predecessors. There {{are two main}} types of cable ships: cable repair ships and cable-laying ships. Cable repair ships, like the Japanese Tsugaru Maru, tend to be smaller and more maneuverable; {{they are capable of}} laying cable, but their primary job is fixing or {{repairing}} broken sections of cable. A cable-laying ship, like the Long Lines, is designed to lay new cables. Such ships are bigger than repair ships and less maneuverable; their cable storage drums are also larger and are set in parallel so one drum can feed into another, allowing them to <b>lay</b> <b>cable</b> much faster. These ships are also generally equipped with a liner cable engine (LCE) that helps them <b>lay</b> <b>cable</b> quickly.|$|E

50|$|GCI {{provides}} {{access to}} the Internet via multiple means. As of January 2015, GCI provides cable modem services in major cities in Alaska with download speeds up to 250 megabits per second or Mbps(re:D Plan). In mid 2015 GCI will be deploying its fiber re:D network in the Anchorage area first, with download speeds up to 1 gigabit per second(1,000Mbit/s). To start that campaign, GCI has increased its highest home internet plan (re:D) from 50MMbps to 100Mbit/s and then to 250Mbit/s for free in all available areas that {{has access to the}} re:D plan. The re:D plan is currently to this date $174.99 and when the re:D 1Gbit/s Fiber network launches, the price will remain the same. In the rural cities of Nome, Cordova, Bethel, and Barrow, GCI provides high-speed cable modem services but uses a satellite for the backhaul connection, as the cost to <b>lay</b> <b>cable</b> to these remote areas is prohibitively expensive. In some rural communities where GCI does not have a cable TV infrastructure, it provides lower-bandwidth (56-512 kbit/s) wireless Internet access over a satellite backhaul.|$|E
5000|$|Ordered {{activated}} in 1951, LSM-275 was redesignated as a {{cable laying}} and repair ship ARC-1 on 14 December, and recommissioned 2 July 1952. She operated off California ports {{for the next}} 11 months, then, on 1 June 1953, got underway for the U.S. East Coast. The ship was named Portunus 13 July 1953. Attached to the 3rd Naval District, she laid cable off Cape May, New Jersey, and off Bermuda before conducting ocean bottom surveys and cable operations off Colombia’s Atlantic and Pacific coasts, 13 October to 31 October. Returning to New York, Portunus underwent overhaul and on 8 March 1954 resumed cable operations, first in the approaches to New York, off Sandy Hook, New Jersey, then off Bermuda. From 1955 to 1959 she continued to <b>lay</b> <b>cable,</b> off Key West, off Sandy Hook, off Bermuda, off Wood Island, Maine, off Nantucket Island, in the Narragansett area, and off Little Creek, Virginia. During this period she continued to base at the New York Shipyard, Brooklyn, and to periodically pick up cable at Newington, New Hampshire.|$|E

40|$|Present {{trend of}} <b>laying</b> <b>cables</b> for various {{purposes}} is to lay underground.

This paper is about the robot that is designed by us which is capable of finding where the complaint lies, so the engineer can directly get the hole dug at that point and fix the issue. The basic principle of Electromagnetic Theory is employed to detect the discontinuity in the cable. Using a signal injector, a low frequency signal is passed through the wire and the induced magnetic field is used to detect the fault. </p...|$|R

On 5 August, Niagara's boats carried the end of the cable ashore at Bay Bulls Arm , Newfoundland, and the same day Agamemnon landed her end of the cable. The first message flashed across 16 August, when Queen Victoria sent a cable to President James Buchanan. This first cable operated for three weeks; ultimate success came in 1866.|$|E
