5|$|Since 1980, the {{surviving}} members have sporadically collaborated {{and participated in}} one-off reunions, the most successful being the 2007 Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert, with Jason Bonham taking his late father's place behind the drums. After {{the release of the}} concert film Celebration Day, Page announced the remastering of the band's discography in the form of deluxe editions. The first wave of albums, <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin,</b> <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin</b> II, and <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin</b> III, were released on 2 June 2014. The next two albums, <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin</b> IV and Houses of the Holy, were released on 27 October 2014.

The film grossed $2 million in one night, and the live album peaked at number 4 and 9 in the UK and US, respectively. Following the film's premiere, Page revealed {{that he had been}} remastering the band's discography. The first wave of albums, <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin,</b> <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin</b> II, and <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin</b> III, were released on 2 June 2014. The second wave of albums, <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin</b> IV and Houses of the Holy, were released on 27 October 2014.

5|$|In 1968, the Stones, {{following}} a suggestion by pianist Ian Stewart, put a control {{room in a}} van and created a mobile recording studio {{so that they would}} not be limited to the standard 9–5 hours most recording studios operated by. The band lent the mobile studio out to other artists, including <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin,</b> which used it to record <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin</b> III(1970) andLed Zeppelin IV(1971).|$|E
5|$|In 1974, <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin</b> took a {{break from}} touring and {{launched}} their own record label, Swan Song, named after an unreleased song. The record label's logo, based on a drawing called Evening: Fall of Day (1869) by William Rimmer, features a picture of Apollo. The logo {{can be found on}} <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin</b> memorabilia, especially T-shirts. In addition to using Swan Song as a vehicle to promote their own albums, the band expanded the label's roster, signing artists such as Bad Company, the Pretty Things and Maggie Bell. The label was successful while <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin</b> existed, but folded less than three years after they disbanded.|$|E
5|$|<b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin</b> II is the eponymous second studio album by the English {{rock band}} <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin,</b> {{released}} on 22 October 1969 in the United States and on 31 October 1969 in the United Kingdom by Atlantic Records. Recording sessions for the album {{took place at}} several locations in both the United Kingdom and North America from January to August 1969. The album's production was credited to the band's lead guitarist and songwriter Jimmy Page, and it also served as Led Zeppelin's first album to utilise the recording techniques of the engineer Eddie Kramer. Incorporating several elements of blues and folk music, <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin</b> II exhibited the band's evolving musical style of blues-derived material and their guitar riff-based sound. It {{has been described as}} the band's heaviest album.|$|E
5|$|Because of Plant's injuries, <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin</b> did not tour in 1976. Instead, {{the band}} {{completed}} the concert film The Song Remains the Same {{and the accompanying}} soundtrack album. The film premiered in New York City on 20 October 1976, but was given a lukewarm reception by critics and fans. The film was particularly unsuccessful in the UK, where, unwilling to tour since 1975 because of their tax exile status, <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin</b> faced an uphill battle to recapture the public's affection.|$|E
5|$|Early on Black Sabbath were {{influenced}} by Cream, the Beatles, Fleetwood Mac, Jimi Hendrix, John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers, <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin</b> and Jethro Tull.|$|E
5|$|Early {{visitors}} to the new campus were <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin,</b> who performed their very first gig at the university on 25 October 1968.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of their second album, <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin</b> {{completed}} several more US tours. They played initially in clubs and ballrooms, and then in larger auditoriums as their popularity grew. Some early <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin</b> concerts lasted more than four hours, with expanded and improvised live versions of their repertoire. Many of these shows have been preserved as bootleg recordings. It was {{during this period of}} intensive concert touring that the band developed a reputation for off-stage excess.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, art {{director}} David Juniper {{was nominated for}} a Grammy Award in the category of best album package for <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin</b> II. On 10 November 1969, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America and in 1990 it was certified 5x platinum reflecting shipping of five million copies. By 14 November 1999, <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin</b> II had shipped twelve million copies and was certified 12x platinum by the RIAA. The 2014 reissue of the album helped itself get back into the Billboard Top 10 when it got to #9.|$|E
5|$|In 2015 it was {{revealed}} that the Pixies would go on tour as a supporting act to former <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin</b> frontman Robert Plant for a series of dates across North America.|$|E
5|$|In an Impericon interview, Shinoda stated his 'non-definitive' {{top three}} bands {{of all time}} to be Nine Inch Nails, <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin,</b> and Creedence Clearwater Revival.|$|E
5|$|July 24, 1973: <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin</b> (Footage {{from this}} show {{was used in}} the 1976 film The Song Remains the Same). Little Feat was the opening act.|$|E
5|$|<b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin</b> II was a {{commercial}} success, {{and was the}} band's first album to reach number one on charts in the UK and the US. In 1970, the album's cover designer David Juniper {{was nominated for a}} Grammy Award for Best Recording Package. On 15 November 1999, the album was certified 12× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales passing 12 million copies. Since its release, various writers and music critics have regularly cited <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin</b> II {{as one of the greatest}} and most influential albums of all time.|$|E
5|$|<b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin</b> II was {{conceived}} during a hectic and much-travelled period of Led Zeppelin's career from January through August 1969, when they completed four European and three American concert tours.|$|E
5|$|By this time, <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin</b> {{were the}} world's number one rock attraction, having outsold most bands of the time, {{including}} the Rolling Stones. Presence, released in March 1976, marked {{a change in}} the <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin</b> sound towards more straightforward, guitar-based jams, departing from the acoustic ballads and intricate arrangements featured on their previous albums. Though it was a platinum seller, Presence received a mixed reaction among fans and the music press, with some critics suggesting that the band's excesses may have caught up with them. Page had begun using heroin during recording sessions for the album, a habit which may have affected the band's later live shows and studio recordings, although this has been denied by Page.|$|E
5|$|Itchy Brother {{was almost}} signed to Swan Song Records, an {{independent}} label {{founded by the}} band <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin,</b> in 1980. The label closed after <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin</b> drummer John Bonham died, and Itchy Brother never recorded a full album on Swan Song. Itchy Brother broke up in 1982. After their disbanding, Richard started writing songs for Acuff-Rose Music, and Fred became a backing musician for country singer Sylvia, {{who at the time}} was recording on RCA Records. Martin played bass guitar and sang backing vocals for Ronnie McDowell, then a recording artist for Curb Records, and Kenney stopped performing, although he continued to write songs with the Young brothers.|$|E
5|$|Led Zeppelin's {{untitled}} fourth album, {{often called}} <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin</b> IV and released on 8 November 1971, is their most commercially successful album. It received a 23 times multi-platinum certification from RIAA, the third-highest of all albums. The band's fifth album, Houses of the Holy, {{was released in}} 1973. Again a transatlantic chart-topper, it has received an 11 times multi-platinum certification from RIAA. In 1974, the band {{set up their own}} vanity label, Swan Song Records, which would release the rest of Led Zeppelin's studio albums. The first was the 1975 double album Physical Graffiti, which has received a 16 times platinum certification from RIAA. However, Zeppelin's seventh album, Presence (1976), did not perform as well as their previous releases, receiving a triple Platinum certification from RIAA. On 20 October 1976 <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin</b> released their first concert film The Song Remains the Same. The recording of the film took place during three nights of concerts at Madison Square Garden in New York City, during the band's 1973 concert tour of the United States. The band's eighth album, In Through the Out Door, received a sextuple platinum certification. This was the last album released by the band before Bonham died of alcohol intoxication in 1980; <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin</b> disbanded immediately afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Many {{musicians and}} bands, {{such as the}} Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix, AC/DC and <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin,</b> have been {{influenced}} by his electric sound and used this and his greatest hits album in creating a hard rock sound. At Newport 1960 {{was one of the first}} live blues albums.|$|E
5|$|Musically, DecembeRadio {{is heavily}} {{influenced}} by hard rock and blues-rock from the 1970s, owing to early exposure to family members' record collections. Their sound {{has been compared to}} that of Aerosmith, <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin,</b> The Black Crowes and Lenny Kravitz, among others.|$|E
5|$|The band {{concentrated}} on playing arenas and stadiums as their drug use escalated. In 1974, the band were regularly making $100,000 per show, and were renting the Starship, a customized Boeing 720B used by <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin</b> and the Rolling Stones.|$|E
5|$|The band {{have sold}} over 200million albums {{worldwide}} {{according to some}} sources, while others state that they have sold in excess of 300million records, including 111.5million certified units in the United States. According to the Recording Industry Association of America, <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin</b> are the second-highest-selling band, the fourth highest selling music act in the US, and {{one of only three}} acts to earn five or more Diamond albums. They achieved eight consecutive number-ones on the UK Albums Chart, a record for most consecutive UK number-one albums shared with ABBA. <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin</b> remain one of the most bootlegged artists in the history of rock music.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} between the release of Wish {{and the start of}} {{sessions}} for the Cure's next album, the band's line-up shifted again. Thompson left the band once more during 1993 to play with Robert Plant and Jimmy Page of <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin,</b> and Bamonte took over as lead guitarist. Boris Williams also left the band, and was replaced by Jason Cooper (formerly of My Life Story).|$|E
5|$|Melua {{has said}} on {{numerous}} occasions how Queen were a huge influence on her as a child/teenager, {{with one of her}} memories of music being her uncle playing records by Queen and <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin.</b> She performed with Queen at the 46664 concert in South Africa in March 2005.|$|E
5|$|Morraine, Baelfire, and the Dark One are {{inspired}} by the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan. A large Mickey Mouse figurine and small Minnie Mouse figurine are visible during Emma's confrontation with Gold over the fire. Zoso, {{the name of the}} Dark One, is a reference to the band <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin,</b> as it is a nickname for the guitarist Jimmy Page.|$|E
5|$|Recorded {{after an}} unreceptive tour {{with the band}} Tool, Mit Gas has been {{described}} by critics as a more focused and unified album than its predecessor, Tomahawk. The album was supported by a tour alongside Melvins, Skeleton Key and Dälek. Mit Gas has garnered positive reviews, drawing comparisons to the works of Frank Zappa, Pink Floyd and <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{generally}} well received by critics, who remarked on its diversity and significantly different musical style {{to that of}} drummer Crahan's other band Slipknot. They noted that it features music inspired by The Beatles, <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin,</b> Pink Floyd and Weezer, among others. However the album did not appear on any sales charts.|$|E
5|$|Abbey Road sold {{four million}} copies in its first two months of release. In the UK, the album debuted at number 1, where it {{remained}} for 11 weeks before being displaced for one week by the Rolling Stones' Let It Bleed. The following week (which was Christmas), Abbey Road returned to the top for another six weeks (completing a total of 17 weeks) before being replaced by <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin</b> II. In all it spent 81 weeks on the UK albums chart.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of Axiomatic, Wild and Singh began to write new songs, {{accompanied}} by Hall. The band's first live album, Electrophobia, was released on 16 September 2006 on Australian record label Liberation. It features songs from the band's first three albums, all recorded in a standalone session in a Melbourne church on 26 May 2006. The production was arranged by Rob John (producer for <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin</b> and The Tea Party).|$|E
5|$|Harry {{arranged}} for the future Beatles' manager, Brian Epstein, to see them perform a lunchtime concert at the Cavern Club on 9 November 1961. Epstein subsequently asked Harry to create a national music paper, the Music Echo, but after disagreements with Epstein about editorial control, he {{decided to become a}} P.R. agent; working for many solo artistes and groups, including Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, Procol Harum, David Bowie, <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin</b> and the Beach Boys, as well as many others.|$|E
5|$|The University of Kent {{has hosted}} concerts by bands {{including}} <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin</b> and The Who. During {{the late seventies}} and early eighties the Canterbury Odeon hosted {{a number of major}} acts, including The Cure and Joy Division. The Marlowe Theatre is also used for many musical performances, such as Don McLean in 2007, and Fairport Convention in 2008. A regular music and dance venue is the Westgate Hall.|$|E
5|$|United Abominations was {{recorded}} in 2006 at SARM Hook End Studios, London, England; the Steakhouse, Studio City, California; Big Fish Encinitas, California and Backstage Productions. Additional overdubs were recorded at S.I.R. rehearsal studio, Hollywood, California and Mustaine Music, Fallbrook, California. Most of the record was tracked in England because Mustaine admired {{the fact that his}} favorite band, <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin,</b> previously recorded there many times. Mustaine produced the album, with additional production handled by Jeff Balding and Andy Sneap.|$|E
5|$|As a {{young boy}} in India, Mercury {{received}} formal piano training up {{to the age of}} nine. Later on, while living in London, he learned guitar. Much of the music he liked was guitar-oriented: his favourite artists at the time were The Who, The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, David Bowie, and <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin.</b> He was often self-deprecating about his skills on both instruments and from the early 1980s began extensively using guest keyboardists. Most notably, he enlisted Fred Mandel (a Canadian musician who also worked for Pink Floyd, Elton John and Supertramp) for his first solo project, and from 1985 onward collaborated with Mike Moran (in the studio) and Spike Edney (in concert).|$|E
5|$|Between 1972 and 1975, {{what is now}} the B {{store in}} Great Stone Road was the 3,000-capacity Hardrock Theatre and Village Discothèque, hosting some of that period's major artists in their prime. <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin,</b> David Bowie, Bob Marley, Elton John, Hawkwind, Yes, Chaka Khan, Curved Air and Lou Reed were amongst those who appeared. Tangerine Dream was the last band to perform at the Hardrock, on 19 October 1975. In more recent years, Lancashire Cricket Club's Old Trafford ground, next door, has {{provided}} a concert venue for bands such as Oasis, Foo Fighters, The Cure, Radiohead, Coldplay, Arctic Monkeys and Take That.|$|E

5|$|English {{rock band}} <b>Led</b> <b>Zeppelin</b> {{recorded}} 108 songs during their career. Between 1969 and 1980, they released eight studio albums, one live album, and sixteen singles. After their breakup, a final studio album, three live albums, nine compilation albums, {{as well as}} deluxe editions of the original nine studio albums have been released. The band pioneered the concept of album-oriented rock and often refused to release popular songs as singles, instead viewing their albums as indivisible, complete listening experiences, and disliked labels re-editing their songs for single releases.|$|E
