5|$|After the Rye House Plot of 1683, {{an attempt}} to assassinate both Charles and James, Monmouth went into self-imposed exile in the Netherlands, and {{gathered}} supporters in The Hague. Monmouth was a Protestant and had toured the South West of England in 1680, {{where he had been}} greeted amicably by crowds in towns such as Chard and Taunton. So long as Charles II remained on the throne, Monmouth was content to <b>live</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> pleasure in Holland, while still hoping to accede peaceably to the throne. The accession of James II and coronation at Westminster Abbey on 23 April 1685 put an end to these hopes.|$|E

5|$|She rekindled {{her studies}} {{too late in}} life to become a truly {{exceptional}} dancer, but she obsessively insisted on grueling daily practice (up to eight hours a day) that contributed to her subsequent physical and mental exhaustion. In September 1929, she was {{invited to join the}} ballet school of the San Carlo Opera Ballet Company in Naples, but, as close as this was to the success she desired, she declined the invitation. While the public still believed the Fitzgeralds to <b>live</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> glamor, friends noted that the couple's partying had somewhere gone from fashionable to self-destructive—both had become unpleasant company.|$|E
5|$|The first philosopher {{to outline}} these themes was Antisthenes, {{who had been}} a pupil of Socrates in the late 5th century BC. He was {{followed}} by Diogenes, who lived in a tub on the streets of Athens. Diogenes took Cynicism to its logical extremes, and came to be seen as the archetypal Cynic philosopher. He was followed by Crates of Thebes, who gave away a large fortune so he could <b>live</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> Cynic poverty in Athens. Cynicism spread with the rise of the Roman Empire in the 1st century, and Cynics could be found begging and preaching throughout the cities of the empire. It finally disappeared in the late 5th century, although similar ascetic and rhetorical ideas appear in early Christianity.|$|E
25|$|A {{point of}} ongoing {{controversy}} about courtly love is {{to what extent}} it was sexual. All courtly love was erotic to some degree, and not purely platonic—the troubadours speak of the physical beauty of their ladies and the feelings and desires the ladies arouse in them. However, {{it is unclear what}} a poet should do: <b>live</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> perpetual desire channeling his energies to higher ends, or physically consummate. Scholars have seen it both ways.|$|E

She is also pursued by the shy but persistent Jeff (Peter Stormare), who also works at the factory.|$|E
25|$|A final {{distinctive}} tradition common across Britain and Ireland was {{the popularity}} of peregrinatio pro Christo ("exile for Christ"). The term peregrinatio is Latin, and referred {{to the state of}} living or sojourning away from one's homeland in Roman law. It was later used by the Church Fathers, in particular Saint Augustine of Hippo, who wrote that Christians should <b>live</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> peregrinatio in the present world while awaiting the Kingdom of God. Augustine's version of peregrinatio spread widely throughout the Christian church, but it took two additional unique meanings in Celtic countries.|$|E
25|$|Among {{those whom}} the early Theosophists claimed as Masters were Biblical figures like Abraham, Moses, Solomon, and Jesus, Asian {{religious}} figures like Gautama Buddha, Confucius, and Laozi, and modern individuals like Jakob Bohme, Alessandro Cagliostro, and Franz Mesmer. However, {{the most prominent}} Masters to appear in Theosophical literature are Koot Hoomi (sometimes spelled Kuthumi) and Morya, with whom Blavatsky claimed to be in contact. According to Theosophical belief, the Masters approach those deemed worthy to embark on an apprenticeship or chelaship. The apprentice would then undergo several years of probation, during which they must <b>live</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> physical purity, remaining chaste, abstinent, and indifferent to physical luxury.|$|E

25|$|There {{always have}} been {{brothers}} in the charterhouse. When Saint Bruno retired to the Chatreuse, two of his companions were secular ones: Andrew and Guerin. They also <b>live</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> solitary prayer and join in the communal prayer and Mass in the chapel. However, the lay brothers are monks under slightly different types of vows and spend less time in contemplative prayer and more time in manual labour. The lay brothers provide material assistance to the choir monks: cooking meals, doing laundry, undertaking physical repairs, providing the choir monks with books from the library and managing supplies. The life of the brothers complements that of the choir monks, and makes the fathers' lives of seclusion possible.|$|E
25|$|With Outworld driven {{back during}} Mortal Kombat Gold, Kung Lao {{decided not to}} return to Shaolin, instead {{allowing}} everyone {{to believe that he}} was dead and went on to <b>live</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> peace in respect to the beliefs of his ancestors. This would not last long however, as he was drawn away from his newfound peace to help fight against Shinnok's forces, when word reached him that Goro was still alive. After Shinnok's defeat, Kung Lao attacked Goro, who had signed a peace treaty with the Centaurs under the mediation of Kitana. Instead of being an attempted assassination, however, the blow was a ceremonial strike of vengeance for the Great Kung Lao's death. With this act, the two warriors shook hands, ending their conflict.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after {{returning}} to the camp, Barnsby attacks. The Apache are massacred; Ray, Thomas and Running River escape, but Seeing Farther is taken hostage.

Assuming William and Marisa are dead, Ray and Thomas attempt to rescue Seeing Farther, but Barnsby mortally wounds him. Dying, he says William and Marisa are still alive, and are being held captive by Mendoza in his alcázar. The brothers leave Running River to kill Barnsby, as they head to rescue William and Marisa. Speaking to his dead son, Running River renounces of his life of violence and hatred, stating that from now on, he shall <b>live</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> peace, and be known as Calm Water.|$|E

25|$|Leni (Kalki Koechlin) is a Delhi {{student of}} half-European descent. A date with her much older boyfriend turns sexual and lands Leni in an MMS sex scandal.

Refusing to <b>live</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> shame and ridicule, she returns to Delhi where she works as a prostitute at night, while continuing with her studies during the day. She adopts the name 'Chanda' for her profession. Her 'foreign' looks mean her services are reserved for the highest-paying customers and she finds some dignity and independence in the new way of living. One night, an inebriated, half-conscious customer is brought to her room - {{it turns out to be}} Dev.|$|E
25|$|In Montfermeil, the duplicitous innkeepers, the Thénardiers, use Cosette as {{a servant}} and treat her cruelly while extorting money from Fantine by {{claiming}} that Cosette is regularly and seriously ill, as well as demanding money to feed and clothe Cosette, all the while indulging their own daughter, Éponine. Cosette dreams of a life with a mother where she is not forced to work and is treated lovingly ("Castle on a Cloud"). The Thénardiers cheat their customers, stealing their possessions and setting high prices for low-quality service, and <b>live</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> criminal depravity ("Master of the House"). Valjean meets Cosette while she's on an errand drawing water and offers the Thénardiers payment to adopt her ("The Bargain"). The Thénardiers feign concern for Cosette, claiming that they love her like a daughter and that she is in fragile health, and bargain with Valjean, who pays them 1,500 francs in the end. Valjean and Cosette leave for Paris ("The Waltz of Treachery").|$|E
500|$|Crates of Thebes (c. 365–c. 285 BC) is {{the third}} figure who dominates Cynic history. [...] He is notable because he renounced a large fortune to <b>live</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> Cynic poverty in Athens. [...] He {{is said to have}} been a pupil of Diogenes, but again this is uncertain. Crates married Hipparchia of Maroneia after she had fallen in love with him and {{together}} they lived like beggars on the streets of Athens, where Crates was treated with respect. Crates' later fame (apart from his unconventional lifestyle) lies in the fact that he became the teacher of Zeno of Citium, the founder of Stoicism. The Cynic strain to be found in early Stoicism (such as Zeno's own radical views on sexual equality spelled out in his Republic) can be ascribed to Crates' influence.|$|E

500|$|Webster's {{appearance}} and behaviour {{were seen as}} key signs of her inherently criminal nature. Crimes {{were thought to be}} committed by a social [...] "residuum" [...] at the bottom of society who occupied themselves as [...] "habitual criminals", choosing to <b>live</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> drink and theft rather than improving themselves through thrift and hard work. Her strong build, partly a result of the hard physical labour that was her livelihood, ran counter to the largely middle-class notion that women were meant to be physically frail. Some commentators saw her facial features as indicative of criminality; O'Donnell commented upon her [...] "obliquely set eyes", which he declared [...] "are not infrequently found in homicides... this peculiarity, which I consider was sufficient in itself, as one of nature's danger signals, to have warned people to steer clear of her".|$|E
500|$|The emperor said, 'The life of man is short. Happiness is to {{have the}} wealth and means to enjoy life, and then to be able to leave the same {{prosperity}} to one's descendents.

So that no shadow of suspicion shall remain between prince and ministers, we will ally our families with marriages, and thus, ruler and subject linked in friendship and amity, we will enjoy tranquility'...The following day, the army commanders all offered their resignations, reporting (imaginary) maladies, and withdrew to the country districts, where the emperor, giving them splendid gifts, appointed them to high official positions.|$|E
500|$|Charles Jennens {{was born}} around 1700, into a prosperous landowning family whose lands and {{properties}} in Warwickshire and Leicestershire he eventually inherited. His {{religious and political}} views—he opposed the Act of Settlement of 1701 which secured the accession to the British throne for the House of Hanover—prevented him from receiving his degree from Balliol College, Oxford, or from pursuing any form of public career. His family's wealth enabled him to <b>live</b> <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> leisure while devoting himself to his literary and musical interests. Although the musicologist Watkins Shaw dismisses Jennens as [...] "a conceited figure of no special ability", Donald Burrows has written: [...] "of Jennens's musical literacy {{there can be no}} doubt". He was certainly devoted to Handel's music, having helped to finance the publication of every Handel score since Rodelinda in 1725. By 1741, after their collaboration on Saul, a warm friendship had developed between the two, and Handel was a frequent visitor to the Jennens family estate at Gopsall.|$|E
