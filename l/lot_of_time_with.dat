5|$|The actual Burnt Norton is a manor {{located near}} the village of Aston Subedge in Gloucestershire that Eliot visited with Emily Hale during 1934. The {{original}} Norton House was a mansion burned down in 1741 by its owner, Sir William Keyt, who died in the fire. Even though Eliot was married, he spent a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> Hale and might possibly have become involved with her had he not been married. Even after their time at Burnt Norton, Eliot stayed in close correspondence with her and sent her many of his poems. The actual manor does not serve as an important location within the poem. Instead, it is the garden surrounding the manor that became the focus.|$|E

[...] The church purchased adjoining property and in 1958 constructed the parsonage, a -story brick Colonial Revival building. [...] By 1959, there were eight Unitarian congregations in Washington, D.C.'s suburbs, with the Arlington church being the largest.

[...] A church committee wrote that it was [...] "confident that Mr. Goodman’s concept of design, his wide experience, and his original and creative genius promise for us a distinctive building which will portray in structural form the spirit and aspiration of this congregation." [...] Church leaders invited the congregation to give suggestions for Goodman's design which included [...] "an architectural style which would express the inspiring tradition of Unitarianism in Virginia" [...] and a [...] "free form and no stained glass, [...] a building to represent our cleavage with the past." [...] The congregation wanted the building to [...] "reflect their liberal, progressive beliefs and that would signify the UUCA's leadership position within the denomination." [...] According to one UUCA minister, [...] "Charles Goodman spent a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> the congregation and incorporating the values and theology of the congregation into the design of the building." [...] Goodman finished his design in late 1961 and the church began seeking financing shortly thereafter. [...] His design included plans for a main sanctuary and adjoining wing, the latter which was not built at the time due to budget concerns. [...] Construction of the sanctuary was carried out by the Martin Brothers contracting firm. [...] The total cost was approximately $300,000, and the dedication was held on March 22, 1964, with a sermon by Dana McLean Greeley entitled [...] "Building a Faith for the Future." [...] UUCA's sanctuary is one of only three churches designed by Goodman and his only church building in Virginia. [...] His other two church designs are Bethesda United Church of Christ in Bethesda, Maryland, and Christ Church of Washington (now called Embassy Church) in Washington, D.C.|$|E
