40|$|This {{exploratory}} research attempted to devise an additional simple means to predict economic change in South Africa. It was envisaged that economic turnaround could be predicted {{at an earlier}} stage than the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index, the FNB/BER Consumer Confidence Index and the South African Reserve Bank’s <b>Leading</b> <b>Indicator</b> using calculus and existing economic indicators. This research used the inflection point of {{the rate of change}} of the South African Reserve Bank’s <b>Leading</b> <b>Indicator</b> as the possible predictor of possible economic change in South Africa. This calculation produced what was referred to as the Leading-Leading Indicators. The research also analysed, using graphical and statistical methods, the ability of the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index, the FNB/BER Consumer Confidence Index and the South African Reserve Bank’s <b>Leading</b> <b>Indicator</b> to predict economic change in South Africa. The research indicated that the proposed Leading-Leading Indicators were a poor predictor of economic change. It also indicated that whilst the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index, the FNB/BER Consumer Confidence Index and the South African Reserve Bank’s <b>Leading</b> <b>Indicator</b> appeared to have good predicting possibilities when analysed graphically, due to autocorrelation, statistically, these economic indicators are also poor predictors of economic change.

The Electric utility faces a number of options how to procure the necessary volumes of electric energy.

Depending on the production capacity of the company, a major part of the outstanding volume is acquired, or sold via long-term bilateral contracts. The rest can be obtained via the OTC market and the short-term demand is covered via day-ahead, or even intra-day trading. The relative rigidity of the production, which cannot be flexibly adjusted and the relative uncertainty about the actual consumption, which depends on a number of factors such as weather, industrial production levels etc., are bound to create unpredicted spikes in electricity prices.|$|E

Overview Jobs Online measures changes in job vacancies advertised by businesses on the two main internet job boards – SEEK and Trade Me Jobs. The trend series is used as the <b>lead</b> <b>indicator</b> as it reduces the month-to-month volatility. Highlights 	Online job vacancies were steady in October. Online vacancies for skilled jobs showed little change (with a slight fall of 0. 2 per cent).    All vacancies increased by 0. 6 per cent over the month. 	Skilled vacancies results were mixed across industry groups. A fall in vacancies in the construction and engineering industry (down 0. 6 per cent), was partly offset by rises in several other industries, including the hospitality and tourism industry (up 1. 3 per cent). 	Skilled vacancies results were also mixed across occupation groups. Likewise, a fall in vacancies in the managers’ occupation group (down 0. 4 per cent) was partly offset by rises in technician and trades workers (up 0. 6 per cent).

40|$|Psychosocial safety climate (PSC) {{is defined}} as shared {{perceptions}} of organizational policies, practices and procedures {{for the protection of}} worker psychological health and safety, that stem largely from management practices. PSC theory extends the Job Demands–Resources (JD-R) framework and proposes that organizational level PSC determines work conditions and subsequently, psychological health problems and work engagement. Our sample was derived from the Australian Workplace Barometer project and comprised 30 organizations, and 220 employees. As expected, hierarchical linear modeling showed that organizational PSC was negatively associated with workplace bullying and harassment (demands) and in turn psychological health problems (health impairment path). PSC was also positively associated with work rewards (resources) and in turn work engagement (motivational path). Accordingly, we found that PSC triggered both the health impairment and motivational pathways, thus justifying extending the JD-R model in a multilevel way. Further we found that PSC, as an organization-based resource, moderated the positive relationship between bullying/harassment and psychological health problems, and the negative relationship between bullying/harassment and engagement. The findings provide evidence for a multilevel model of PSC as a <b>lead</b> <b>indicator</b> of workplace psychosocial hazards (high demands, low resources), psychological health and employee engagement, and as a potential moderator of psychosocial hazard effects. PSC is therefore an efficient target for primary and secondary intervention. ...|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{is made of}} private sector construction demand (quarterly new orders) grouped into housing, commercial and industrial construction respectively, and their relationship with a priori selected leading indicators of GNP, price level, real interest rate, unemployment and manufacturing profitability over the period 1974 to 1988. The results indicate that different variables explain the trends in these private sector construction demand sub-sectors. While construction price {{appeared to be an}} important elastic influence in housing investment, it was not found to be an important factor in respect to commercial and industrial construction. Trends in commercial and industrial constructions are explained by manufacturing profitability and economic conditions. The level of unemployment influences commercial construction only and with a negative inelastic relationship. <b>Lead</b> <b>indicator</b> forecasts of the groupings of private sector investment are above 10 percent of accuracy due to the unusual deep cut in private construction {{as a result of the}} recession although the models except increasing trends in these series.

40|$|Purpose – How can organisations {{and their}} key stakeholders, {{including}} the financial markets, {{benefit from the}} increased {{understanding of the role}} of intangibles in value creation in listed firms? One response is to challenge the finance industry to create innovative investment products based on analysis of intangibles, including human capital (HC), which can act as a <b>lead</b> <b>indicator</b> of future financial performance. This may require qualitative research specialist expertise in finance houses. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses qualitative data from the trading floor of Merrill Lynch in Sydney and Hong Kong, drawing on participatory action research, by the first author. It also draws on field research interview data with biotechnology executives, using a case study approach, by the second author. Findings – The findings suggest that finance industry may need to move beyond the use of indices and ethical investment screens to more clearly understand the role of intangibles, such as HC, in value creation. Originality/value – This paper described the evolution of a set of HC analysis models, and applies them to the biotechnology industry. The results indicate that more qualitative information on listed companies can be analysed and interpreted to make the investment process more transparent to all stakeholders, including securities analysts. This may influence other researchers to extend these approaches to improve the quality of intangibles analysis. 16 page(s...|$|E
40|$|A key {{objective}} of the National Strategy for Sustainable Development of Romania is the eco-efficient management of resource consumption to maximize outputs, by promoting a model of production and consumption allowing for longterm sustainable economic growth and convergence to the average performance of EU states in resource productivity. In this paper, we aim to emphasize and analyze {{the importance of the}} new concepts and policies called for implementing the SDS in the EU and in Romania and also for transition to a green economy. We shall explain more in detail the significance and relationships between the main features of sustainable development, focusing on the concept of resource efficiency, with its <b>lead</b> <b>indicator</b> resource productivity, offering a way to measure progress towards a ‘green economy’. The time-series data computations and analysis show that the evolution of the Romanian economy {{in recent years has been}} inconsistent with the principles of sustainable development model and the gap towards the EU- 27 average level of resource efficiency (productivity) has widened, in recent years. As such, the continuation of this trend in the Romanian economy may threaten the sustainability of economic growth in the long term, due to excessive and irrational resource consumption, with negative consequences for the state of natural capital, but also for the desired resource-efficient economic and social development. Some suggestions, conclusions and policy recommendations are made in the end, in order to eventually restructure and reshape the Romanian industry so as to improve the performance of resource-efficiency and productivity, to advance towards a greener economy and an information society. ...|$|E
