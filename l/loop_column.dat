40|$|The {{evolution}} of nonthermal electrons accelerated in magnetic loops {{is determined by}} solving the kinetic equation, including magnetic field convergence and Coulomb collisions {{in order to determine}} the effects of these interactions on the induced cyclotron maser and plasma wave growth. It is found that the growth rates are larger and the possibility of cyclotron maser action is stronger for smaller <b>loop</b> <b>column</b> density, for larger magnetic field convergence, for a more isotropic injected electron pitch angle distribution, and for more impulsive acceleration. For modest values of the column density in the coronal portion of a flaring loop, the growth rates of instabilities are significantly reduced, and the reduction is much larger for the cyclotron modes than for the plasma wave modes. The rapid decrease in the growth rates with increasing <b>loop</b> <b>column</b> density suggests that, in flare loops when such phenomena occur, the densities are lower than commonly accepted...|$|E

Fresh and spent powder and monolith samples were characterized by elemental analysis, surface area, hydrogen chemisorption, scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX), and transmission electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (TEM/EDX). Three reactor configurations were compared including the slurry and monolith batch reactors as well as the bubble <b>loop</b> <b>column</b> resulting in 100, 70, and 72 % sample toxicity reduction, respectively, after 5 h of reaction.

HXR RHESSI data on loop dimensions and nonthermal electron parameters and GOES soft X-ray data on hot loop plasma parameters are used to model coronal thick-target physics for two "discovery" events (2002 April 14 [23 : 56 UT] and 2002 April 15 [23 : 05 UT]).

A short pre-column containing 10 μm octadecylsilane mounted into the sample loop position of an injection valve was used as the primary clean-up step.

40|$|Chromatographic peaks are {{generally}} asymmetric owing to extra- and intra-column effects. This {{implies that the}} experimental retention time, t(R,p), and variance, σ 2 /(p), do not properly describe {{the shape of a}} peak under the experimental conditions used, nor do they allow one to predict how this shape will change when the composition of the eluent is varied. Consequently, some of the conclusions drawn from these experimental parameters may contain an extent of error that cannot be evaluated. This may occur for instance when some of the lower order statistical moments are used to estimate thermodynamic properties related to the solute-eluent- chromatographic column system. The aim {{of this paper is to}} test whether and to what extent information can be improved in ion chromatography when the moments estimated by some suitable fitting functions are compared to the experimental ones. The following fitting functions were tested: the exponentially modified Gaussian (EMG) (the peak deconvolution leads to the Gaussian curve which would be obtained in the absence of distortion), the bi- Gaussian (bi-G) (the deconvolution leads to the sum of two half-Gaussians), and the two-Gaussians (2 -G) (the deconvolution leads to two Gaussians). The last one is proposed in this paper for the first time. Once we had evaluated how each component of a modern IC chromatograph (namely <b>loop,</b> <b>column,</b> post- column conditioning module and detector) affects the peak shape, the three fitting models were tested: (i) to compute β 1, and β 2 stability constants for the Cd + 2 /Cl - system from the measurement of the first-order moments at a variable Cl - concentration and constant ionic strength (0. 22). It was found that: β 1 = 28. 86 (EMG), 28. 53 and 28. 59 (2 -G), 28. 99 (bi-G) and β 2 = 57. 96 (EMG), 59. 01 and 58. 98 (2 -G), 53. 92 (bi-G). The β values calculated from the experimental retention times referred to the peak maximum were: β 1 = 27. 89 and β 2 = 64. 95; (ii) to evaluate, for the various solutes, the dependence on the first order moment (m 1) of some parameters of the i fitting functions, such as τ (the time constant of the exponential modifier in the EMG), σ(i) (the square root of peak variance) and the asymmetry a/b (graphically measured as the ratio of the distances of the peak contour from the abscissa of peak maximum, at 0. 1 peak height). A linear dependence on m 1 was found for: σ(i) with a slope which depends on the fitting model used and not on the type of solute: τ and a/b with a slope which depends on the solute type. These findings are of interest: (i) to provide a sound tool for the accurate IC estimate of stability constants based on the Gaussian first order moment computed from the deconvolution of the experimentally distorted peak (ii) to evaluate how the shape of the solute peak changes with m 1 when the shift of the peak along the time (or volume) scale due to variations in the eluent composition can be thermodynamically predicted. In the last case the optimized peak separation conditions, which take the effect of peak shape variation into account, might be more efficiently found...|$|E

The problem 	 may be overcome by using a technique based on iterations. In a real-life case, when one has to deal with 	 numerous parameters and time periods, a numerical solution seems to be the only feasible approach. It is a 	 chain of formulae that becomes so integrated that the information between cash flows and cost of capital moves 	 freely. <b>Loops</b> run along <b>columns</b> (from V to WACC, and from E to k) and lines (from one year to another). The 	 cost of capital “tracks” the capital structure and changes accordingly. The valuation is recursive, going 	 backwards in time. In general, the recursive method of company evaluation overcomes a fundamental problem 	 that is often ignored by many other methods: the fact that the cost of capital depends on the financial structure. 	 Here in the paper, the valuation of Emcinsmed S. A. company is done in order to present the i-DCF valuation 	 method. The company is highly leveraged, hence it serves as a good example...|$|R
40|$|The {{interfacial}} area a {{was measured by}} the sulfite oxidation method in a three-phase external <b>loop</b> airlift bubble <b>column</b> suspending completely the different concentrations of ion exchange resin particles in aqueous carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) solutions {{with a wide range of}} viscosity. The column had been previously studied for the circulating liquid velocity UL, gas holdup G and volumetric gas-liquid oxygen transfer coefficient kLa in the two- and three-phase systems. The average bubble size dB and oxygen transfer coefficient kL were obtained as dB = 6 G/a and kL = (the previous kLa) /a, respectively. The similar studies were carried out in the internal loop airlift and normal bubble columns for comparison. The a values in the external loop airlift were found to be little affected by the column height and particles concentrations, and to decrease with increasing viscosity. All the three columns showed a linear dependence of a on G. A simple correlation of a, dB or kL was proposed as a function of G and viscosity for the external loop airlift as well as both internal loop airlift and normal columns. A well-known relationship between kL and dB was confirmed to hold independent of column types and operating conditions for a given two or three phase system...|$|R
40|$|Analytical {{transfer}} function matrices are developed for describing the dynamic behaviour of the compositions within the rectifying and stripping sections of both very short and very long distillation columns, {{in response to}} changes in energy and liquid throughout. Matrices of first-order lags are shown to describe both situations very closely and the simple structure of the models demonstrates the need to consider only steady-state operating curves {{for the elimination of}} interaction problems arising in twin product control. The models are useable directly by the plant or design engineer who merely needs to substitute basic design data to obtain good estimates of all the model parameter values. An elementary inverse Nyquist approach is presented which predicts precisely the extent of the detuning of one composition control loop by closing the other <b>loop.</b> The long <b>column</b> model is shown to have much in common with models produced by other authors who have used widely different and usually partly-empirical approaches to column modelling. The analytical approach here proves, for specified conditions, the empirical observations relied upon by these previous workers. The modelling method used here involves the solution of the process partial differential equation at high frequency and the discrete process equations at low frequency. The two resulting models join together quite naturally because of their structural similarity. It is believed that the approach could find application in separation processes generally. ...|$|R
30|$|Citric, malic, succinic and tartaric acids were {{analysed}} using {{ion exchange}} chromatography (Metrohm International, CH- 9101, Herisau, Switzerland) with inverse suppression and conductivity detection. Reference {{samples of the}} organic acids (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were injected via a 20 [*]μl <b>loop</b> onto a <b>column</b> (250 [*]mm × 7.8 [*]mm, 9 [*]μm, polystyrene/divinylbenzene copolymer, Metrosep 6.1005. 200, Switzerland) and eluted isocratically at a flow rate of 0.5 [*]mL[*]min- 1 and a pressure 3.8 MPa. The suppressor system was regenerated by pumping a solution of 10 [*]mM LiCl, together with Millipore water, through the system. Different ratios of the mobile phase (0.5 [*]mM sulphuric acid and acetone) were tested, as well as different column temperatures (30, 40 and 50 °C). The optimal conditions for separation of the organic acids were 0.5 [*]mM sulphuric acid and acetone (85 : 15, v/v) and 30 °C. Stock standard solutions (1 [*]mg/mL) of the organic acids were prepared and kept at + 4 °C. Different dilutions of the stock solutions {{were used for the}} calibration curves. Fruits collected in 2009 in Manhiça were used for this analysis. About 500 [*]mg fruit pulps were mixed with 5 [*]ml sulphuric acid (Ultra Turrax TP 18 / 10) for 2 [*]minutes and then centrifuged at 2000 [*]rpm for 15 minutes. The supernatants were filtered through 0.45 [*]μm membrane filters and diluted with Millipore water to appropriate concentrations. The retention time and peak areas were compared with reference samples run under the same conditions and used to calculate the concentration of the organic acids in the fruit samples. All experiments were performed at least in triplicates.|$|R
