40|$|To {{know the}} {{frequency}} of Todd <b>s</b> <b>paralysis</b> during the video EEG monitoring studies, to investigate in its pathophysiology, and to confirm its value to localise the epileptic focus. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed 114 monitoring studies, in 102 patients. RESULTS: Sixty patients had epileptic seizures. An obvious paresis was noted in four seizures of two patients (3 and 1, respectively). Both patients had frontal epilepsy. During the paralysis, in the first patient the EEG showed ictal discharges on the contralateral centrotemporal area. In the second patient, the EEG demonstrated slow waves in the contralateral frontal region. The ictal onset was contralateral to the paresis in all cases. No patient with pseudoseizures had paralysis. CONCLUSIONS: Postconvulsive paralysis are not frequent in video EEG monitoring studies. However, if present it points out to a contralateral seizure onset. In our series it happened in patients with frontal seizures. The EEG may help to clarify if it correspond to a true postictal phenomenon or to a ictal paralysis...|$|R

40|$|International society 2 ̆ 7 s {{failure to}} respond in a timely and decisive fashion to the crisis in Syria has been widely {{described}} as {{a failure of the}} Responsibility to Protect (RtoP). One of the principal explanations for this apparent failure was the political fallout from the NATO-led intervention in Libya. This article examines the proposition that failure in Syria stemmed from controversy in Libya. It finds that there is relatively little evidence to support this view because: first, Russian and Chinese explanations of their own position have not been consistent in emphasising the legacy of Libya; second, several states that were very critical of the NATO-led action in Libya supported for draft resolutions on Syria and did not identify Libya as a particular influence; third, both the Security Council and General Assembly have exhibited signs of deeper comfort with RtoP post-Libya than they had prior to it. This suggests that the Council 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>paralysis</b> on Syria owes more to the politics surrounding this specific case than to more generalised concerns about RtoP...|$|R

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} in a large wave flume where the interaction between water waves and a movable sand bed were investigated. Monochromatic and poly- chromatic waves of specified amplitudes and period were generated under cases of weak (R= 0. 2) and/or strong (R= 0. 9) reflections. Experiments included one of two mean grain sand sizes (0. 2 mm and O. mm) {{to examine the effects}} of different sediment transport modes (bed load and suspended load), on the over all evolution of the sand bed. Throughout the experiments, conductivity probes measured the surface wave envelope, charged-coupled device (CCD) cameras recorded small scale (ripple) formations and migrations, while a digital camera was employed to capture large scale variations (bars) and ripples over the entire sand bed. A final experiment was conducted using a mixture of the two uniform grain size to observe sediment sorting within the sand bed. Numerous sieve analysis and measurements of the active sorting sand depth were performed on sediment samples from various positions along the flume to quantitatively study the phenomena of sediment sorting. by Blake Jude <b>Landry.</b> Thesis (<b>S.</b> M.)

40|$|Photostress {{has to be}} {{considered}} during optical micromanipulation of gametes. Ultraviolet light, including low-energy UVA (320 - 400 nm) radiation, as well as high-intensity near infrared (NIR) laser radiation may induce cell damage. A total number of 580 light-exposed sperm cells were studied in single-cell photostress experiments. Low-power (1. 5 mW, 5. 3 W/cm 2) UVA exposure with 365 nm radiation of a standard mercury microscopy lamp to human spermatozoa resulted within 109 ± 30 <b>s</b> in <b>paralysis</b> and within 310 ± 110 s in cell death. Cytotoxic effects during cell manipulation with laser microbeams {{were found to be}} partly based on non-linear excitation phenomena, in particular two-photon absorption by endogenous cell chromophores. Two-photon absorption will be more intense in the case of pulsed laser microradiation, but occur also during micromanipulation with highly focused continuous wave (cw) microbeams used as laser tweezers ('optical traps'). In particular, short-wavelength NIR traps < 800 nm induce UVA-like biological effects (oxidative stress). For example, sperm trapping with 760 nm microbeams resulted in UVA-like autofluorescence modifications, paralysis within 35 ± 20 s and cell death within 65 ± 20 s. In contrast, laser microbeams at 800 - 1064 nm may act as relatively safe micromanipulation tools. In most optical traps multifrequency cw lasers are employed. Radiation of these lasers can magnify cytotoxic effects. Therefore, single-frequency laser operation should be preferred. In general, laser-assisted cell micromanipulation requires a new understanding of microbeam-cell interaction, including aspects of non-linear optics...|$|R
40|$|The {{ocean is}} a complex, {{constantly}} changing, highly dynamical system. Prediction capabilities {{are constantly being}} improved {{in order to better}} understand and forecast ocean properties for applications in science, industry, and maritime interests. Our overarching goal is to better predict the ocean environment in regions of complex topography with a continental shelf, shelfbreak, canyons and steep slopes using the MIT Multidisciplinary Simulation, Estimation and Assimilation Systems (MSEAS) primitive-equation ocean model. We did this by focusing on the complex region surrounding Taiwan, and the period of time immediately following the passage of Typhoon Morakot. This area and period were studied extensively as part of the intense observation period during August - September 2009 of the joint U. S. - Taiwan program Quantifying, Predicting, and Exploiting Uncertainty Department Research Initiative (QPE DRI). Typhoon Morakot brought an unprecedented amount of rainfall within a very short time period and in this research, we model and study the effects of this rainfall on Taiwan's coastal oceans as a result of river discharge. We do this {{through the use of a}} river discharge model and a bulk river-ocean mixing model. We complete a sensitivity study of the primitive-equation ocean model simulations to the different parameters of these models. By varying the shape, size, and depth of the bulk mixing model footprint, and examining the resulting impacts on ocean salinity forecasts, we are able to determine an optimal combination of salinity relaxation factors for highest accuracy. by Jennifer Jacobs <b>Landry.</b> Thesis: <b>S.</b> M., Joint Program in Applied Ocean Science and Engineering (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Mechanical Engineering; and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution), 2014.

40|$|A b s t r a c t The aim of our {{research}} was to describe {{the characteristics of the}} intra-abdominal pressure curve following elective rectal resection in the first 48 hours after the operation. We wanted to prove the hypothesis that intra-abdominal pressure rises within 48 hours after the procedure and correlates well with the postsurgical bowel paralysis. We evaluated the relationship of the maximal intra-abdominal pressure to the body mass index and to precisely defined width of anastomosis. The intra-abdominal pressure was measured indirectly at intervals of 4 hours. The statistical evaluation was made by means of regression analysis at 5 % significance level. We compared dependent variable curves of intra-ab-dominal pressure in 24 patients. We proved that intra-abdominal pressure within the first 48 hours following the procedure rises and can thus be accepted as objective correlation to postsurgical bowel paralysis. We proved dependence of the maximal intra-abdominal pressure level on the body mass in-dex and independence on a diameter of anastomosis of 21 – 33 mm. We would like to use our findings further for evaluation of the influence of early enteral feeding on postoperative bowel paralysis after elective rectal resection.

The addition of exogenous PnC to the plaquing mixtures of spleen cells from S 6 -, S 19 -, or PnC-immunized mice inhibited the appearance of most (greater {{than or equal to}} 85 %) of the plaque-forming cells. Furthermore, the addition of monoclonal antibody specific for the dominant (TEPC 15) idiotype of anti-phosphorylcholine (a component of PnC) antibodies also inhibited the appearance of most of the plaque-forming cells.

Cochlear implants, which completely replace {{the functioning of the}} inner ear, are now a common treatment for deafness.

These devices completely replace parts of human anatomy we would normally consider to be performing cognitive processing. Are these devices themselves part of the cognitive system or do they just facilitate it? Are they parts of our minds or just sophisticated tools? More philosophically, these are metaphysical questions about where the boundary between the mind and the environment lies. Ultimately, this work establishes a principled way to set down such a boundary by developing a methodology for modeling potentially cognitive processes using graph theory and applying graph-theoretical analytics to rigorously delineate mind from environment. ...|$|R

40|$|Although it {{suffered}} a serious setback when, in 1991, three senior commanders tried to wrestle control from its leader, John Garang, the SPLM/A {{has remained the}} main rebel organisation in the southern Sudan {{since the start of}} the second civil war in 1983. At a national level the SPLM/As influence over political development in the south has been matched only by the government in Khartoum and its armed forces, and at a local level only by chiefs, who derive their power from the old system of indirect rule, established by the British during the colonial period. An understanding of the changes and processes within the SPLM/A is, therefore, essential to an analysis of the Sudans contemporary history and current events, which includes continuing peace negotiations, and the planning of post-war southern Sudan. This volume analyses the main events leading up to the SPLM/As current position of supremacy and follows the process of internal reform that has brought about a nascent state structure amidst a devastating civil war and continuous humanitarian crisis. The book consists of three chronologically ordered, integrated parts, where the first part discusses the effect of the split in 1991 and the movements political and administrative structures prior to its National Convention in 1994. The activities of southern rebels, traditional structures and humanitarian agencies are described, and the study shows how the interaction between these institutions constituted a unique political system. The 1994 Convention is discussed in the second part. The Convention was, and to some extent still is, regarded by most members of the SPLM/A as one of the Movement’s greatest achievements. Here the processes leading up to the National Convention is recaptured; preparations and the event itself are discussed thoroughly. Finally, the book analyses the significance of the Convention and its reforms in the light of later attempts at implementation when, in the last part of the 1990 <b>s,</b> political <b>paralysis</b> set in as the Movement experienced unprecedented military success. The discussion is brought to a conclusion with a brief summary of events during the period 2000 – 2004 and presents some thoughts on the future government of the south Sudan. Guerrilla Government is of interest to academics, humanitarian workers and diplomats concerned with the Sudan’s contemporary history, civil wars and humanitarian operations in a war-zone. The book contributes towards documenting the experience of the southern Sudanese and the pretext for the current peace process, and provides ample case material for students of insurgencies and internal conflicts. Explaining the political and military background to today’s complex situation in the South, Guerrilla Government should be studied by everyone who wishes to contribute to the rebuilding of a war-torn Sudan...|$|R
40|$|To {{elucidate}} {{the true nature}} of flaccid paralysis of infant polyradiculoneuritis with Guillain-Barres syndrme (G. N. S.), which occurred intermittently in the coast regions of the Inland Sea from 1950 to 1955, the author made comparative studies on the electromyograms of this disease with those of paralytic poliomyelitis (H. M.), and obtained the following results: 1. In 23 cases with G. B. S. and 41 cases of H. M. electromyographical examinations were carried out 76 and 102 times up to 10 weeks after the onset of disease, and their tested total number of muscles came up to 884 and 716 respectively. Among them 686 muscles of G. B. S. and 510 of H. M. showed abnormal electromyographic findings. These abrormal electromyograms were classified into 6 types, namely, those at the maximum voluntary contraction: electrical silence, low amplitude NAIU voltage (L. A. NAUV.), synchronization voltage (S. V.), complex NMU voltage, and decreased spike number of normal NMU voltage; and those at rest, fibrillation voltage. The two diseses showed some differences in the percentage of each abnormal elect romyograms in these various muscles. Namely, of them the most marked difference was the L. A. NMU V. at the maximum contraction; and it was observed in 25. 3 per cent of G. B. S. and in 1. 1 per cent of H. M., while electrical silence was observed in 8. 9 per cent of the former and in 28. 6 per cent of the latter. On the other hand, synchronization voltage was noticed in 17 per cent of G. B. S. while in 12. 6 per cent of H. M., showing slightly more in the former. The normal NMU voltage was cassified into three grades; the let to the third degree according to the discharge frequency, that is to say, the number of discharges 1 - 15 (Ⅲ). 16 - 30 (Ⅱ), and 31 - 50 /sec(Ⅰ). Summing them up, these discharges were found in 48. 4 per cent of G. B. S. while in 57. 2 per cent in H. M., As for the complex NMU voltage it was found in 0. 43 per cent of the former, while in 0. 4 per cent of the latter; and fibrillation voltage at rest was in 1. 7 per cent and 0. 4 per cent respectively, showing no significant difference in either case. 2. Follow-up examinations were studied on the 20 cases with G. B. <b>S.</b> presenting limb <b>paralysis</b> at the extreme stages one to six years after the onset of disease and on the eight cases with H. M., presenting bilateral paralysis within ten weeks, at the three years after the onset. Only 28 out of 250 muscles in G. B. S. (10 Cases out of 20) showed abnormal electromyographic findings, namely, 11. 2 per cent were found to be ahnormal. While 37 muscles out of 46 of H. M. examimed within 10 weeks after the onset namely, 80. 4 per cent showed the abnormality. All electromyographic findings of 28 muscles from G. B. S. were of incomplete synchronization voltage, presenting a desynchronization tendency, while in H. M. 7 muscles out of 46 (15. 2 %) were of electrical silence. But these 46 muscles revealed it in 50 per cent of them within 10 weeks after the onset of disease. As for the decreased number of normal NMU voltage concerned, 17 muscles (36. 9 %) were positive, while within 10 weeks after the onset 40 per cent recognized. On the other hand, S. V. of H. M. was recognized in 13 muscles out of 46 (28. 2 %), though within 10 weeks after the onset it was in 19. 6 per cent of 46 muscles, moreover 10 muscles out of 13 revealed complete S. V., 3. 119 muscles out of 884 from G. B. S. and 81 muscles out of 716 from H. M. tested eletromyographicaly were negative tendon reflex. But the electrical activity at the maximum voluntary contraction was recognized in 86 muscles (72. 3 %) out of the total of 119 muscles in the former and 17 muscles (20. 9 %) out of 81 muscles in the latter. After 8 weeks the elctrical activity in G. B. S. came out in all muscles, while on the contrary none in H. M [...] The relationship between the degree range of tendon reflex and the S. V. as well as L. A. NMU voltage was examined, and S. V. was found most often in those muscles with sluggish tendon reflex in both diseases. In G. B. S. those muscles either with normal tendon reflex or without it showed more S. V. than in H. M [...] L. A. NMU voltage was found much more in the muscles without tendon reflex rather than in those with normal tendon reflex. 4. In the electrical evainiuation studied up to seven weeks after the onset in 15 cases of G. B. S. in 8 cases of H. M., hardly typical reaction of degeneration could be recognized in G. B. S. but only traces of atypical reaction of degeneration, showing reduction of excitability in the majority, while in H. M. typical and atypical reaction of degeneration could still be recognized in 50 per cent of the cases after seven weeks from the onset. 5. Above mentioned results, i. e. the electromyographical change, its relation between tendon reflex and electrical excitability, show that G. B. S. consists mainly of pathologic changes in peripheral nerves and muscles and their spinal changes are slight and transient, whereas in H. M. the main pathologic changes are held in the anterior horn of the spine...|$|R
