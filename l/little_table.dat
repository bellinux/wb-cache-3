After about 15months—while her mother was attempting to administer arrowroot—Ellen's jaw locked closed. Subsequently, according to Hayman, she was fed [...] "wine, gruel and other things" [...] using the [...] "spout of a toy teapot inserted between two broken teeth". The Daily Telegraph journalist expanded on Ellen's feeding: [...] "The feeding implements stand on a <b>little</b> <b>table</b> {{by the side of the}} stump bedstead, and, at first sight, give you the idea that they are toys placed there to attract her attention should she, by a merciful termination of her trance, presently awake to life. The toys in question are two tiny 'teapots', each not much larger than a full-sized walnut and holding four small teaspoonfuls. One of these is filled with port wine, and the other with milk... this quantity of liquid nourishment... cannot weigh more than half an ounce..." [...] At this time, it was considered [...] "manifestly out of the question to think of moving her". How the family dealt with Ellen's passing of urine and faeces is unclear, but in 1880, Hayman said that Ann Frewen told him that no bowel movements had occurred for five years, and that approximately every four days [...] "a somewhat large amount would pass from the bladder".|$|E
2500|$|In Puerto Rico, Epiphany is an {{important}} festive holiday, and is commonly referred as Dia de Los Tres Reyes Magos, or Three Kings' Day. [...] It is traditional for children to fill a box with fresh grass or hay and put it underneath their bed, for the Wise Men's camels. [...] The three kings will then take the grass to feed the camels and will leave gifts under the bed as a reward. [...] These traditions are analogous to the customs of children leaving mince pies and sherry out for Father Christmas in Western Europe or leaving milk and cookies for Santa Claus in the United States. On {{the day before the}} feast (January 5), the [...] "Rosario de Reyes" [...] or [...] "Promesa de Reyes" [...] is celebrated with songs (aguinaldos) promised to be sung to the Kings, usually before a <b>little</b> <b>table</b> with figures of the Nativity and the Kings or with the Kings alone and their camels. This celebration is accompanied with a chicken soup, snacks, and drinks.|$|E
