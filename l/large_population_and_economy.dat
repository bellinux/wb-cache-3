25|$|The Qianlong Emperor (25 September 1711– 7 February 1799) was {{the sixth}} emperor of the Manchu-led Qing dynasty, {{and the fourth}} Qing emperor to rule over China proper. Born Aisin Gioro Hongli, {{sometimes}} referred to simply as Hongli, the fourth son of the Yongzheng Emperor, he reigned officially from 11 October 1735 to 8 February 1796. On 8 February, he abdicated in favour of his son, the Jiaqing Emperor – a filial act {{in order not to}} reign longer than his grandfather, the illustrious Kangxi Emperor. Despite his retirement, however, he retained ultimate power as the Emperor Emeritus (or Retired Emperor) until his death in 1799; he thus was the longest-reigning de facto ruler in the history of China, and dying at the age of 87, the longest-living. As a capable and cultured ruler inheriting a thriving empire, during his long reign the Qing Empire reached its most splendid and prosperous era, boasting a <b>large</b> <b>population</b> <b>and</b> <b>economy.</b> As a military leader, he led military campaigns expanding the dynastic territory to the largest extent by conquering and sometimes destroying Central Asian kingdoms.

5000|$|From 1919 to 1932, British defense {{spending}} {{was based upon}} the Ten Year Rule, which assumed that {{there was to be}} no major war for the next ten years, a policy that led to the British military being cut to the bone. Amongst British decision-makers, the idea of the [...] "continental commitment" [...] of sending a large army to fight on the European mainland against Germany was never explicitly rejected, but was not favored. The memory of the heavy losses taken in the Great War had led many to see the [...] "continental commitment" [...] of 1914 as a serious mistake. For most of the inter-war period, the British were extremely reluctant to make security commitments in Eastern Europe, regarding the region as too unstable and likely to embroil Britain in unwanted wars. At most, Britain was willing to make only limited security commitments in Western Europe, and even then tried to avoid the [...] "continental commitment" [...] as much as possible. In 1925, the British Foreign Secretary, Sir Austen Chamberlain had famously stated in public at the Locarno conference that the Polish Corridor was [...] "not worth the bones of a single British grenadier". As such, Chamberlain declared that Britain would not guarantee the German-Polish border {{on the grounds that the}} Polish Corridor should be returned to Germany. That the British did not take even their Locarno commitments seriously could be seen in Whitehalls prohibition of the British military chiefs holding staff talks with German, French and Italian militaries about what to do if a [...] "flagrant violation" [...] of Locarno occurred. In general, for most of the 1920s-30s, British foreign policy was based upon appeasement, under which the international system established by Versailles would be revised in Germanys favor, within limits in order to win German acceptance of that international order, and thereby ensure the peace. One of the main British aims at Locarno was to create a situation where Germany could pursue territorial revisionism in Eastern Europe peacefully. The British viewpoint was that if Franco-German relations improved, France would gradually abandon the cordon sanitaire. Once France had abandoned its allies in Eastern Europe as the price of better relations with the Reich, this would create a situation where the Poles and Czechoslovaks having no Great Power ally to protect them, would be forced to adjust to German demands, and hence would peacefully hand over the territories claimed by Germany such as the Sudetenland, the Polish Corridor and the Free City of Danzig (modern Gdańsk, Poland). British policy-makers tended to exaggerate French power with the normally Francophile Sir Robert [...] "Van" [...] Vansittart, the Permanent Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office writing in 1931 that Britain was faced with an [...] "unbearable" [...] French domination of Europe, and what was needed was a revival of German power to counterbalance French power.

At the end of 1943 the Army's strength was set at six infantry divisions and two armoured brigades, although further reductions were ordered in August 1944 and June 1945. The Australian Army generally had a long-standing policy of using British-designed equipment, but equipment from Australia, the United States and some other countries was introduced into service in the war's later years. Pre-war doctrine was focused on conventional warfare in a European environment and the Army did not have any doctrine for jungle warfare prior to 1943.

Next, we standardize the values of all indicators and calculate the sub-indices of conservation culture in three dimensions, economic and social structure, resources and environmental function, and coordination degree between human and nature. Then, we weight the three sub-indices, comprise the conservation culture index of each of the 17 cities, and assess their conservation culture development levels.

40|$|Air {{pollution}} {{is one of}} the most important environmental problems in developing Asian countries like China. Nanjing (32. 06 o N, 118. 80 o E) is a megacity with a <b>large</b> <b>population</b> <b>and</b> a developed <b>economy</b> in eastern China. In this region, knowledge gaps still exist in the understanding of the source and transport of air pollutants because only few measurement studies have been conducted. From April 2013, A miniature Multi-Axis - Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (Mini-MAX-DOAS) instrument was installed in the Station for Observing Regional Processes of the Earth System (SOPRES) in Nanjing. One-year measurements from June 2013 till May 2014 are applied in this study. These measurements enable the retrieval of aerosol and trace gas profiles like Nitrogen dioxide (NO 2). Multi-Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) is a novel technique to measure key trace gas species and aerosols simultaneously. The MAX-DOAS instrument is based on optical Ultraviolet (UV) – Visible (VIS) spectrometer that observes scattered sunlight from multiple viewing directions. By combining the zenith sky and different viewing directions, Differential Slant Column Densities (DSCDs) are acquired from the record spectra (F. Hendrick et al., 2014; U. Platt,J. Stutz, 2008). Then the vertical profiles can be retrieved by means of bePRO inversion algorithm (K. Clémer et al., 2010) on these DSCDs. The retrieval results include total Aerosol Optical Depths (AODs), aerosol extinction vertical profiles, NO 2 total Vertical Column Densities (VCDs), and NO 2 near surface(0 200 m layer) Volume Mixing Ratios (VMRs).

Global sea levels are rising due to climate change and this will accelerate through this century: a rise of more than 1 m is possible. In some locations these changes may be exacerbated by (1) increases in storminess due to climate change, although this is less certain, and (2) human-induced subsidence due to ground fluid withdrawal from and drainage of susceptible soils, especially in deltas and alluvial plains. Sea-level rise has a range of potential impacts including higher extreme sea levels (and flooding), coastal erosion, and salinization of surface and ground waters. This threatens the loss of large areas of land and associated assets and economic activity, the displacement of millions of people, and significant coastal habitat degradation. However, adaptation can greatly reduce these impacts and promote prosperous and desirable coasts. Adaptation measures {{can be characterized as}} (1) protect, (2) accommodate, or (3) retreat approaches. The provision of information measures such as warnings is improving significantly, while novel methods such as ecosystem-based approaches are attracting interest. Adaptation to sea-level rise should be viewed as a process that requires an integrated coastal management philosophy to be consistent with wider coastal activities and other stresses. Hence, in addition to technical skills, adaptation requires an appropriate institutional capacity. The success or failure of measures of adaptation, especially protection, is contested and this influences our view of sea-level rise as a problem. Adaptation can be best analyzed in the context of understanding the coastal system that includes the effects of all drivers, including sea-level rise, their interactions, and feedbacks: these types of analyses are only just beginning. Some proactive adaptation plans are already being formulated, such as around London and in the Netherlands. Coastal cities will be a major focus for adaptation efforts due to their concentrations of people and assets. However, there are important challenges for adaptation in developing countries, most especially in deltaic areas and small island...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} consequence of a crucial and not yet fully explored problem: the reluctance of the United States to sign and ratify international agreements, like Kyoto, that aim to mitigate climate change and its underlying social and ecological impacts. This unwillingness has inspired local governments, mayors, metropolitan area governance consortia, state governments, and governors {{to take on the}} climate challenge without the directive of the federal government. Local areas of the U. S. are experiencing climate-change-related impacts such as receding beach lines due to sea level rise and intense storms, fresh water shortages, and extreme weather events. As a result, researchers have begun to explore the human dimensions of climate change through an inquiry in: among many other topics, the vulnerability of local areas to the impacts of climate change and the forces shaping local areas 2 ̆ 7 contribution to climate change. This study addresses the latter issue using the STIRPAT framework - a reformulated version of the I=(P) (A) (T) formulation that relates environmental impacts (I) to population growth (P), affluence (A), and technology (T). I address three questions that have thus far been poorly answered in prior research: 2 ̆ 2 across the U. S., do local areas differ in the extent of their contribution to climate change? 2 ̆ 2, 2 ̆ 2 what are the causes of variation in energy use and carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions across local areas? 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 which social theories best explain the causes of variation in energy use and CO 2 emissions across local areas? 2 ̆ 2 To make strides in answering these questions and contribute to the understanding of local level drivers of energy consumption and emissions, this research analyzes the causes of variation in: energy use and CO 2 emissions in the 100 largest U. S. metropolitan areas in chapter 4, the change in energy consumption between 2000 and 2005 for these metropolitan areas in chapter 5, and CO 2 emissions in all U. S. counties in chapter 6. The STIRPAT method is used to test four social theories of environmental degradation - the treadmill of production, ecological modernization, urban ecological transitions, and human ecology theories - by quantifying variables associated with energy use and CO 2 emissions drawn from each theory. The specific findings demonstrate that various demographic, economic, and governmental factors are related strongly to metropolitan area energy consumption and county-level CO 2 emissions. The human ecology, treadmill of production, and urban ecological transitions theories are important to explaining how and why climate-related impacts differ {{for a wide variety of}} local areas in the United States. Related to human ecology and treadmill of production theory, environmental degradation is highest in metropolitan areas <b>and</b> counties with <b>large</b> <b>populations</b> <b>and</b> <b>large</b> <b>economies</b> that have various mechanisms in place to facilitate economic growth. By contrast, some U. S. counties are beginning to remedy their impact on the environment by applying economic and governmental resources toward the mitigation of CO 2 emissions, which provides evidence of support for urban ecological transitions theory. However, because climate change is a complex cross-scale global environmental problem and the results in this dissertation confirm that this problem is locally driven by similar <b>population</b> <b>and</b> economic factors also affecting the climate at larger spatial scales, mitigation efforts to reduce energy use and emissions at the local level will be fruitless without a well-coordinated, cross-scale (local to global) ideological shift that puts less priority on economic goals and more on environmental sustainability. These results, and the methodological and theoretical framework applied in this dissertation, thus provide a useful platform for the successful application of future research that specifically addresses mitigation strategies to reduce local-level environmental impacts. This dissertation research, therefore, contributes to the environmental sociology, general demography, and environmental demography disciplines by exploring ways in which population-environment relationships work at the local scale...|$|R
