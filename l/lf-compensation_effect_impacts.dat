Analysis {{shows that the}} <b>effect</b> of <b>impact</b> ionization can not be neglected in subthrshold region of operation of MOSFET. This effect is enhanced at larger drain voltage. Gate bias can control the <b>effect</b> of <b>impact</b> ionization. The <b>effect</b> of <b>impact</b> ionization is through the gate and drain bias dependence of the maximum electric field.

The <b>Effect</b> <b>impact</b> is what SnpEff uses to determine how deleterious the variant is on genes. For example, a HIGH impact output means that SnpEff predicts that the variant causes deleterious gene effects.|$|R

40|$|Summary. This paper {{provides}} {{new evidence}} on the <b>effects</b> of <b>impact</b> fees on housing prices, using an inventory of single-family housing sale transactions in the 38 cities and towns within King County, Washington, for the period 1991 – 2000. Although the <b>effect</b> of <b>impact</b> fees on housing prices has been examined previously, earlier studies have been limited by methodological deficiencies. This paper examines the <b>effect</b> of <b>impact</b> fees on new housing and their differential effect on housing price based {{on the quality of}} housing, and finds that the <b>effect</b> of <b>impact</b> fees on the price of new housing is quite significant and elastic, raising new home prices by about 166 per cent of the amount of the fee. The increase is 358 per cent for the higher-quality homes and is statistically insignificant for the lower-quality homes...|$|R

40|$|The wear of pipelines, used in slurry transport, {{results in}} high costs for {{maintenance}} and replacement. The wear mechanism involves abrasion, corrosion, impact, {{and the interaction}} among them. In this work, we study the <b>effect</b> of <b>impact</b> on the wear mechanism and wear rate. Results show that when the <b>effect</b> of <b>impact</b> is small, the wear mechanism is dominated by electrochemically induced surface modification, {{which leads to a}} lower wear rate in a corrosive environment than in a non-corrosive environment. By contrast, when the <b>effect</b> of <b>impact</b> is large, the wear mechanism is drastically altered. In that regime plastic deformation is important. The influence of corrosion in the high impact regime can be neglected. Our findings show the importance of including <b>impact</b> <b>effect</b> in the distinction of wear of slurry pipes...|$|R

40|$|Application of {{chemical}} dispersants or mechanical dispersion on surface oil is a trade-off between surface <b>effects</b> (<b>impact</b> of floating oil) and sub-surface <b>effects</b> (<b>impact</b> of suspended oil). Making an informed decision regarding such response, requires insight in the induced change in fate and transport of the oil. We aim to identify how natural, chemical and mechanical dispersion could be quantified in oil spill models. For each {{step in the}} dispersion process, we review available experimental data {{in order to identify}} overall trends and propose an algorithm or calculation method. Additionally, the conditions for successful mechanical and chemical dispersion are defined. Two commonly identified key parameters in surface oil dispersion are: oil properties (viscosity and presence of dispersants) and mixing energy (often wind speed). Strikingly, these parameters play a different role in several of the dispersion sub-processes. This may explain difficulties in simply relating overall dispersion effectiveness to the individual parameters. </p...|$|R

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{expansion}} of offshore wind power capacity in the world in the last decade, innovative offshore solutions are designed {{in order to meet the}} upcoming power capacity installations. As in all other energy sectors, offshore wind power has certain conditions that have to be met to increase the efficacy of the outcome. In this thesis, wake <b>effect</b> <b>impact</b> on the production results of Hexicon AB’s innovative floating and rotating offshore wind power platform project with 3 turbines located in the southern part of Sweden are analyzed through the application of “Analytical wake models” and the “Actuator Disc method”, with the help of WindSim. The results of Analytical models and Actuator Disc method were found to be independent of one another. Even though analytical wake models did not find any wake <b>effect</b> <b>impact</b> among the turbines, the results can be considered as logical. However, the Actuator Disc method created unexpected results which might stem from the WindSim – AD combination. It is therefore recommended to further explore these scenarios with other (more) advanced simulation tools...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} dynamic multi-region, multi-good dynamic CGE model, which reacts {{sensitive}} {{to changes in}} regional climate. In the assessment of economic effects of global warming we distinguish between direct <b>effects</b> (<b>impacts</b> in the considered region) and spillover <b>effects</b> (<b>impacts</b> from foreign regions which spillover into the domestic region). This paper shows how these spillover effects work and quantifies the contributions of such spillover effects to the total costs of climate change for a region. Climate scenarios are exogenous given by output of a General Circulation Model. The decision makers will minimize the costs of a given scenario and adapt trade relationships. We observe {{for the end of}} century very heterogeneous costs for different regions between 23 and 50 % of regional GDP, compared with a scenario without climate change. The application of the Harrison, Horridge, and Pearson (2000) decomposi-tion procedure shows a significant contribution of spillover effects for the total costs of climate change of a region. This result underline the fact that climate change is a real global problem and that international trade makes it even more global...|$|R

40|$|Background: Health {{technology}} assessment (HTA) is increasingly {{performed at the}} local or hospital level where the costs, impacts, and benefits of health technologies can be directly assessed. Although local/hospital-based HTA has been implemented {{for more than two}} decades in some jurisdictions, little is known about its <b>effects</b> and <b>impact</b> on hospital budget, clinical practices, and patient outcomes. We conducted a mixed-methods systematic review that aimed to synthesize current evidence regarding the <b>effects</b> and <b>impact</b> of local/hospital-based HTA. Methods: We identified articles through PubMed and Embase and by citation tracking of included studies. We selected qualitative, quantitative, or mixed-methods studies with empirical data about the <b>effects</b> or <b>impact</b> of local/hospital-based HTA on decision-making, budget, or perceptions of stakeholders. We extracted the following information from included studies: country, methodological approach, and use of conceptual framework; local/hospital HTA approach and activities described; reported <b>effects</b> and <b>impacts</b> of local/hospital-based HTA; factors facilitating/hampering the use of hospital-based HTA recommendations; and perceptions of stakeholders concerning local/hospital HTA. Due to the great heterogeneity among studies, we conducted a narrative synthesis of their results. Results: A total of 18 studies met the inclusion criteria. We reported the results according to the four approache...|$|R
