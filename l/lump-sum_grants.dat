The main sources for the study are petitions of mine employees to the named society about determining their pensions or issuance of <b>lump-sum</b> <b>grants.</b> The author makes an attempt to compare the social and economic position of the staff with the same one of the mining workers, using the results of the V.

During research the author {{came to the conclusion that}} the main indications such as social class background, work experience, financial status of staff of gold mining companies in Western Siberia and of workers were the same. This fact allows to make a conclusion that the majority of mining employees was made up mainly from the working environment. Also the analysis of petitions about setting of pensions allows to make a conclusion that at the turn of XIX–XX centuries took place the forming of personnel of professional industrial workers who had worked a long time in the gold mining sector and often were so-called «skilled» workers, i. e. workers not in the first generation. Another conclusion is that the material position of gold mining employees in Siberia was at a very low level, as well as the degree of their social security.

40|$|A {{lump-sum}} intergovernmental transfer has a "price effect", {{as well as}} an "income effect", {{because it}} allows the recipient government to reduce its tax rate, which lowers its marginal cost of public funds, while still providing the same level of public service. This reduction in the effective price of providing the public service helps to explain the "flypaper effect" - the empirical observation that a lump-sum grant has a much larger effect on spending than an increase in personal income. Contrary to the assertions of Mieszkowski (1994) and Hines and Thaler (1995), a model of a benevolent local government financing its expenditures with a distortionary tax predicts flypaper effects from <b>lump-sum</b> <b>grants</b> that are similar to those observed in many econometric studiesflypaper effect; marginal cost of public funds; intergovernmental grants; fiscal federalism...|$|E

To incorporate the regional government function of income redistribution, we extend the tax system from the stylized proportional capital income tax to the linear capital income tax with a uniform lump-sum grant: the revenue collected from capital taxation in each region is used not only to provide the regional public good but also to offer a uniform <b>lump-sum</b> <b>grant</b> to each individual in the region. In contrast to Hoyt’s (1991) finding that {{the extent to which}} public goods are undersupplied is monotonically increasing in the number of competing regions, we show that, regardless of the number of competing regions, all heterogeneous individuals concur with each other on the first-best provision of public goods; on the other hand, the size of income redistribution is monotonically decreasing in the number of competing regions...|$|R

The response to a decrease in categorical <b>lump-sum</b> <b>grants</b> from the central to local governments might result in an asymmetrical response to intergovernmental grants: local spending is highly responsive to increases in grants, but it is relatively insensitive to grants reduction [Stine, 1994; Gramkhar and Oates, 1996]. In our paper we have estimated this hypothesis using a sample of cross-sectional and time- observations covering the 20 Italian regions over the period 1989 - 1993.

40|$|The Hawaiian Home Lands program {{enacted by}} the U. S. Congress in 1921 placed 200, 000 acres of {{government}} land in trust {{for the use of}} native Hawaiians. This program - now with assets valued at well over $ 700 million - long ago evolved into a special type of public housing program in which the Hawaii territorial and then state governments developed, assigned and controlled the use of residential land. This article investigates the extent to which reform of the program could increase the value of benefits delivered to native Hawaiians. It builds on the economic literature on land and housing policy reform and Native American property rights. The reform alternatives that we analyze all employ the same total amount of program resources. The first alternative is <b>lump-sum</b> <b>grants</b> that provide fee title to existing homeowners, and money from the sale of other program assets to other native Hawaiians. Additional alternatives provide financial assistance for the rental and purchase of housing. The existing program and the proposed alternatives yield both private and public benefits. The public benefits are the inalienability of land which yields cultural and political externalities, and the more equitable distribution of program resources. Our quantitative estimates of private benefits reveal the extent of potential inefficiency in each program. We also determine the minimum value of the existing program's public benefits that would make it more beneficial to native Hawaiians than a lump-sum grant program. ...|$|E
40|$|Are there {{ways that}} {{contemporary}} capitalism can be rendered a dramatically more egalitarian economic system without destroying its productivity and capacity for growth? This book explores two proposals, {{unconditional basic income}} and stakeholder grants, that attempt just that. In a system of basic income, as elaborated by Philippe van Parijs, all citizens are given a monthly stipend sufficient {{to provide them with}} a no-frills but adequate standard of living. This monthly income is universal rather than means-tested, and it is unconditional — receiving the basic income does not depend upon performing any labor services or satisfying other conditions. It affirms the idea that as a matter of basic rights, no one should live in poverty in an affluent society. In a system of stakeholder grants, as discussed by Bruce Ackerman and Anne Alstott, all citizens upon reaching the age of early adulthood receive a substantial one-time <b>lump-sum</b> <b>grant</b> sufficiently large so that all young adults would be significant wealth holders. Ackerman and Alstott propose that this grant be in the vicinity of $ 80, 000 and be financed by an annual wealth tax of roughly 2 percent.

40|$|Economic theory {{predicts that}} {{unconditional}} intergovernmental grant income and private income are perfectly fungible. Despite this prediction, {{the literature on}} fiscal federalism documents that grant and private income are empirically non-equivalent. A large scale school finance reform in New Hampshire [...] the typical school district experienced a 200 percent increase in grant income [...] provides an unusually compelling test of the equivalence prediction. Most theoretical explanations for non-equivalence focus on mechanisms which produce public good provision levels which differ from the decisive voter's preferences. New Hampshire determines local public goods provision via a form of direct democracy [...] a setting which rules out these explanations. In contrast to the general support in the literature for non-equivalence, the empirical estimates in this paper suggest that approximately 92 cents per grant dollar are spent on tax reduction. These results not only document that equivalence holds in a setting with a strong presumption that public good provision decisions reflect the preferences of voters, but also directly confirm the prediction of the seminal work of Bradford and Oates (1971) that <b>lump-sum</b> <b>grant</b> income is equivalent to a tax reduction. In addition, the paper presents theoretical arguments that grant income capitalization and heterogeneity in the marginal propensity to spend on public goods may generate spurious rejections of the equivalence prediction.

Using U. S. data, I find that firms’ agency problems attract large institutional holdings for monitoring purpose, and provide evidence that the large institutions are indeed doing monitoring. The study thus {{contributes to the literature}} on investor activism, which is usually limited to studying the effect of an existing large investor. In the second essay, we use the introduction of the US 1996 Telecommunications Act as our empirical setting to examine the dynamics of the role of peer performance in managerial compensation. We adopt a difference-in-differences design using size- and performance matched manufacturing firms as the benchmarks. The results indicate that, relative to the benchmark firms, telecommunications firms strengthened the tie between managerial compensation and peer performance after the Act. The results suggest that relative performance evaluation became more valuable for telecommunication firms after the Act. The third essay analyzes the response of state spending to windfall revenues using tobacco settlements in the U. S. in the late 1990 s as a natural experiment. The “flypaper effect” in the public finance literature refers to an empirical puzzle that an increase in <b>lump-sum</b> <b>grants</b> from the higher level government boosts spending of a lower level government more than an equivalent increase in private income. Most of the early work relies on policy variations in fiscal grants across jurisdictions over time, and is subject to price or policy endogeneity problem. This study overcomes these limitations by exploiting the tobacco settlements between the U. S. states and tobacco manufactures in the late 1990 s as a natural experiment. We find that state direct spending increases by about $ 1 on average in response to one dollar increase in the settlement funds and by about 8 cents to one dollar increase in private income, strong evidence for the “flypaper effect”. Results suggest that states with the higher adult smoking rate or those with heavy reliance on the tobacco manufacturing industry for economic growth have lower spending propensity from the windfall revenue...|$|E
40|$|Essay I: Employment Security Agreements, {{which are}} {{elements}} of Swedish collective agreements, offer {{a unique opportunity}} to study very early job search counselling of displaced workers. These agreements provide individual job search assistance to workers who are dismissed due to redundancy, often as early as during the period of notice. Compared to traditional labor market policies, the assistance provided is earlier and more responsive {{to the needs of the}} individual worker. In this study, I investigate the effects of the individual counseling and job search assistance provided through the Employment Security Agreement for Swedish blue-collar workers on job finding and subsequent job quality. The empirical strategy is based on the rules of eligibility in a regression discontinuity framework. I estimate the effect for workers with short tenure, who are dismissed through mass-layoffs. My results do not suggest that the program has an effect on the probability of becoming unemployed, the duration of unemployment, or income. However, the results indicate that the program has a positive effect on the duration of the next job. Essay II: The well-known positive relationship between the unemployment benefit level and unemployment duration can be separated into two potential sources; a moral hazard effect, and a liquidity effect pertaining to the increased ability to smooth consumption. The latter is a socially optimal response due to credit and insurance market failures. These two effects are difficult to separate empirically, but the social optimality of an unemployment insurance policy can be evaluated by studying the effect of a non-distortionary <b>lump-sum</b> severance <b>grant</b> on unemployment durations. In this study, I evaluate the effects on unemployment duration and subsequent job quality of a <b>lump-sum</b> severance <b>grant</b> provided to displaced workers, by means of a Swedish collective agreement. I use a regression discontinuity design, based on the strict age requirement to be eligible for the grant. I find that the <b>lump-sum</b> <b>grant</b> has a positive effect on the probability of becoming unemployed and the length of the completed unemployment duration, but no effect on subsequent job quality. My analysis also indicates that spousal income is important for the consumption smoothing abilities of displaced workers, and that the grant may have a greater effect in times of more favorable labor market conditions. Essay III: Evidence from around the world suggest that individuals who are awarded disability benefits in some cases still have residual working capacity, while disability insurance systems typically involve strong disincentives for benefit recipients to work. Some countries have introduced policies to incentivize disability insurance recipients to use their residual working capacities on the labor market. One such policy is the continuous deduction program in Sweden, introduced in 2009. In this study, I investigate whether the financial incentives provided by this program induce disability insurance recipients to increase their labor supply or education level. Retroactively determined eligibility to the program with respect to time of benefit award provides a setting resembling a natural experiment, which could be used to estimate the effects of the program using a regression discontinuity design. However, a simultaneous regime change of disability insurance eligibility causes covariate differences between treated and controls, which I adjust for using a matching strategy. My results suggest that the financial incentives provided by the program have not had any effect on labor supply or educational attainment...|$|R

40|$|Proposals {{aimed at}} {{improving}} {{the welfare of the}} poor often include indicator targeting, in which non-income characteristics (such as race, gender, or land ownership) that are correlated with income are used to target limited funds to groups likely to include a cincentration of the poor. Previous work shows that efficient use of a fixed budget for poverty reduction requires such targeting, either because agents'income cannot be observed or to reduce distortionary incentives arising from redistributive interventions. Inspite of this, the authors question the political viability of targeting. After constructing a model that is basically an extension of Akerlof's 1978 model of"tagging", they derive three main results: 1) Akerlof's result continues to hold: that, ignoring political considerations, not only will targeting be desirable but recipients of the targeted transfer will receive a greater total transfer than they would if targeting were not possible. 2) A classical social-choice analysis-in which agents vote simultaneously about the level of taxation and the degree of targeting-shows that positive levels of targeted transfers will not exist in equilibrium (an unsurprising finding, given Plott's 1968 theorem). It also shows that a voting equilibrium often will exist with no targeting but with non-zero taxation and redistribution. 3) In a game in which the policymaker chooses the degree of targeting while voters choose the level of taxation, the redistributive efficiency gains from tagging may well fail to outweigh the resulting reduction in funds available for redistribution. These results may be extended readily to account for altruistic agents. The authors stress that even when these results hold, the alternative to targeted transfers - a universally received <b>lump-sum</b> <b>grant</b> financed through a proportional tax - will nonetheless be supported politically and will be quite progressive relative to the pretransfer income distribution.

I find that public funding to stations has a positive impact on private giving, but this impact rapidly decreases as the level of government subsidies increases, ultimately becoming negative.

The empirical relevance of liquidity constraints and income effects is evaluated in two ways.

UI benefits have a pure substitution effect only for those who have sufficient resources to smooth con-sumption while unemployed. The empirical relevance of borrowing constraints and income effects is evaluated in two ways. First, I classify households into groups that are likely to be constrained and unconstrained based on their asset holdings, mortgage payments, and spouse’s labor force status. Non-parametric and semi-parametric tests reveal that unemployed benefits raise durations much more sharply in the constrained groups.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 125 - 130) Microfiche. xi, 130 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmThis monograph presents policy {{simulation models}} {{for the evaluation of}} alternative fiscal policies for the provision of local public services where equity is relatively emphasized. For this framework, we propose four equalizing grant-in-aid schemes (the lump-sum general and the lump-sum specific grant-in-aid, the matching grant-in-aid, and the foundation aid plan), and compare them with perfectly decentralized and perfectly centralized fiscal schemes. Our models are characterized by an endogenous central government acting as a grantor cum tax collector. The central government is also subject to a full financing constraint (revenue from central taxation = expenditures for equalizing grants), which makes the central tax rate indicate the relative scale of financial cost (or the degree of decentralization) of each fiscal scheme. We simulate the six fiscal models with various values of five selected system parameters: income and price elasticities of the service concerned, alternative evaluating criteria, share of expenditures for the service, and welfare cost of central taxation. The simulation study primarily searches for any systematic relations between the five parameters and the two key variables: the central tax rate and relative priority rankings of each fiscal scheme. The simulation results provide valuable guidance in selecting a particular fiscal scheme for the provision of a particular public service. In the simulation, Korean elementary education is selected as an example. The simulation results show that income elasticity is the most important parameter that affects the relative priority rankings of each fiscal scheme as well as the financial cost. The lump-sum general grant-in-aid scheme turns out to require the highest, while the foundation aid plan requires the lowest intervention rate. It is also found that matching grants are more stimulative than <b>lump-sum</b> general <b>grants.</b> Based on the results of policy priority rankings and the endogenous central tax rates in each fiscal scheme, we select the foundation aid plan as the optimal policy scheme for the provision of elementary education in Korea...|$|R
40|$|We {{address the}} {{questions}} on what determines local government proliferation, specifically {{on the impact of}} intergovernmental transfers on proliferation. On exploring the determinants of proliferation, we provide a more elaborate empirical technique than exists in the literature by employing panel binary outcome, survival regression, as well as count analysis to capture the time varying effect from intergovernmental transfers. We also examine the impact of proliferation on service delivery outcomes and construct channels by which the policy may affect the outcomes in the education and health sectors. We apply panel difference-in-difference estimation and we uniquely identify the different treatment group and thus control for the plausible differential impact on outcomes in regards to changes in intergovernmental transfers. On the determinants of local government formation, there are likely competing effects across transfers on the decision to proliferate {{as well as on the}} extent of fragmentation given that we find (1) the <b>lump-sum</b> conditional <b>grants</b> positively influence the probability of proliferation, (2) a province with higher median share of equalization grants associates with higher number of local governments, (3) higher equalization grants implies a longer duration to the proliferation event, and (4) higher tax sharing in the proliferated local governments reflects higher stability where stability refers to the longer duration to the sequential proliferation event. The findings suggest the tactical central-local behavior may be present, however, the support of rent-seeking hypothesis on proliferation should not be generalized to overall system of transfers. On the impact from the proliferation policy, the education and health outcomes estimations provide mixed results within the treatment group. The findings shed light on the current practice of administrative or political decentralization, specifically on the competing local-central preferences within each sector on measured service delivery outcomes. The results from difference-in-difference (DID) estimations show support on attainment of education outcome in new local governments represented by a reduction in the dropout rate but not on the quality of education in terms of higher students’ tests scores even though there is a relatively higher conditional grants allocated to the proliferated local governments. Meanwhile, in terms of infant mortality rate, we only find evidence of improvement in infant mortality on the originating local government but not on the new local governments. Controlling for selectivity and production function covariates have not changed the pattern of the impact...|$|R
40|$|One of {{challenges}} facing competitive {{higher education in}} South Korea is {{how to make a}} good balance between autonomy and accountability of higher education institutions by effectively utilizing limited public funds. Faced with this challenge, careful consideration of financial reform and allocation measures on higher education institutions from the government is needed and the financial resources from the private sectors should also be reconsidered.  This paper focuses on the financial autonomy and external accountability of higher education institutions under the Brain Korea 21 Phase II Project and identifies the relationship between the funding agency, the Brain Korea 21 and New University for Regional Innovation Committee, and the higher education institutions as to how the allocation mechanism of the Brain Korea 21 Project has been applied in the context of autonomy and accountability. In this study, a purposive sampling is used in order to access those people who have in-depth knowledge in a single case of Brain Korea 21 Project. The arguments for more market-oriented or new forms of governance can be understood in the context of analytical framework. But whether decentralization, openness, performance-based, and selective support to strengthen diversity and accountability produce quality or not remains a visible question. In a formula-driven and block <b>grant</b> <b>lump-sum</b> budget from the Brain Korea 21 and New University for Regional Innovation Committee under the Brain Korea 21 Phase II Project has provided the minimum condition for education and research and somewhat enhanced the institutional autonomy of higher education institutions but financial autonomy has not been given too much compared with the Brain Korea 21 Phase I Project because most resources sticks to the stipends for graduate students as usual. And the external accountability of higher education institutions has been increased in a form of self-evaluation and self-reporting based on performance index and external audit of the Brain Korea 21 and New University for Regional Innovation Committee. This paper will help state policymakers and higher education administrators in making more informed decisions when designing and implementing performance indicators, reflecting on the trends toward innovative allocation mechanisms in the lights of international cases.
