5|$|I <b>liked</b> <b>them</b> {{both because}} they were ironic and provocative {{at the same time}} but also unlike me. I am not a materialistic person, and I {{certainly}} wasn't a virgin, and, by the way, how can you be like a virgin? I liked the play on words; I thought they were clever. They're so geeky, they're cool. I never realized they would become my signature songs, especially the second one.|$|E
5|$|Falk, Heine, Takemura, Zhang and Hsu {{investigated}} {{the validity of}} implicit self-esteem measures to assess cultural differences. They subjected Canadian and Japanese participants {{to a series of}} tests, one of which was rating the numbers to 40 by how much participants <b>liked</b> <b>them.</b> Because the researchers saw little to no correlation between the various implicit self-esteem measures, they did not draw any conclusions about cultural differences. Stieger and Krizan explored cross-cultural differences in number preferences, specifically the day on which Christmas is celebrated as a contributor to number preference. They asked participants from six countries to rate numbers between 1 and 36. They found that in countries where gifts are exchanged on 24 December participants disproportionately preferred the number 24, whereas in countries that do this on 25 December participants preferred 25. They concluded that cultural influences need {{to be taken into account}} if these preferences are used to reflect individual differences.|$|E

On the set, the actors would {{sometimes}} crack jokes, and if director Ricky Lau <b>liked</b> <b>them,</b> he would retain those scenes in the film.

25|$|In Aliens, {{the adult}} creatures {{have a more}} {{textured}} head rather than a smooth carapace. In the commentary for Aliens, it was speculated that {{this was part of}} the maturation of the creatures, as they had been alive far longer than the original Alien, although James Cameron stated that he simply left the carapace off because he <b>liked</b> <b>them</b> better that way. The smooth design of the carapace would be used again in Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection, although made narrower with a longer muzzle and more prominent chin. This design would be kept in Alien versus Predator, and abandoned in Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem in favor of the ribbed design.|$|E
25|$|The 1975 season saw the {{introduction}} of the Astros' new uniforms. Many teams were going away from the traditional uniform and the Astros were no exception. The uniforms had multishade stripes of orange, red and yellow in front and in back behind a large dark blue star over the midsection. The same stripes ran down the pant legs. Players numbers not only appeared {{on the back of the}} jersey, but also on the pant leg. The bright stripes were meant to appear as a fiery trail like a rocket sweeping across the heavens. The uniforms were panned by critics, but the public <b>liked</b> <b>them</b> and versions started appearing at the high school and little league level. The uniform was so different from what other teams wore that the Astros wore it both at home and on the road until 1980.|$|E
25|$|Numerous famous {{guests have}} {{stayed at the}} hotel. Claude Monet and James Whistler both stayed at the hotel and painted or drew views, from their rooms, of the River Thames. The Savoy {{featured}} prominently in guest Oscar Wilde's trial for gross indecency. Other celebrity guests in the hotel's early decades included the future King Edward VII, Sarah Bernhardt, Enrico Caruso, Lillie Langtry, H. G. Wells, George Bernard Shaw, Nellie Melba, Charlie Chaplin, Al Jolson, Errol Flynn, Fred Astaire, Marlene Dietrich, Lionel Barrymore, Harry Truman, Audrey Hepburn, Judy Garland, Josephine Baker, Cary Grant, Babe Ruth, Ivor Novello and Noël Coward. The hotel kept records of its guests' preferences, {{so that it could}} provide for them in advance. For Coward, the staff made history by taking the first photographs of a hotel guest's toilet articles so that they could lay them out in his bathroom exactly as he <b>liked</b> <b>them.</b> They made sure to provide a fireproof eiderdown quilt to Barrymore, as he always smoked while reading in bed.|$|E

If he does not <b>like</b> <b>them,</b> why should he <b>like</b> <b>them</b> because they are forwarded by me?

500|$|Robert Zajonc, {{a social}} psychologist, {{published}} research in 1968 into preferences between pairs of words (e.g. [...] "on" [...] or [...] "off"): in {{the overwhelming majority}} of trials the preferred word was also the most common. Zajonc also tested preferences for nonsense words and found that people <b>liked</b> <b>them</b> the more they heard them. He interpreted these results as evidence that mere repeated exposure to a stimulus is sufficient to enhance its attractiveness.|$|E
500|$|By January 29, {{all four}} artists had {{submitted}} bronze casts of their proposals. [...] Dewey forwarded them to McAdoo, who solicited {{advice from the}} Commission of Fine Arts (which <b>liked</b> <b>them),</b> his Assistant Secretary, William Malburn (who did not), and Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber {{and others at the}} Philadelphia Mint (who offered suggestions). [...] McAdoo had asked that the Mint prepare alternative designs for all the coins, and Barber did so, starting with the half dollar. [...] Rejections to all four of the outside artists were sent on February 5 over McAdoo's signature. [...] The reasons for this are uncertain, as the rejections are terse–Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen, in their volume on commemoratives, assert that Malburn's opposition was decisive.|$|E
500|$|A second remix {{features}} Fabolous, a third features B.G., and little-known Torontonian producer Satya Rock arranged {{an extended}} underground remix to feature E-40, Method Man, Lyrics Born, One Be Lo, Dres, Joe Budden, Talib Kweli, [...] Beanie Sigel, Edan, and MF DOOM. [...] Siik remixed [...] "1 Thing" [...] by using instrumentals from a song by Japanese producer Nujabes. [...] Stylus Magazine listed Siik's remix seventh on {{its list of}} the top ten remixes of 2005 and commented that [...] "it's enough to warrant a whole change of venue, from the sizzling pep of the dance floor to the silk luxury of the bedroom." [...] Most of the unofficial remixes were released on mixtapes, and Amerie said that she <b>liked</b> <b>them</b> all, particularly those by Fabolous, B.G., and Juelz Santana.|$|E

500|$|Although Meeker {{had not had}} a dog in his wagon in 1852, he {{knew that}} people <b>liked</b> <b>them,</b> and sought to add one to his crew. [...] Jim, a large, {{friendly}} collie who became an expedition member and Meeker's companion for the next six years, had belonged to one of Meeker's neighbors, a Mr. James. [...] Meeker was impressed by the way Jim drove James' chickens out of the area where the family grew berries, by moving slowly. [...] Five dollars to one of James' children secured the purchase. Some of Meeker's friends tried {{to talk him out of}} the trip; one local minister warned against this [...] "impracticable project", stating that it was [...] "cruel to let this aged man start on this journey only to perish by exposure in the mountains".|$|E
500|$|Santos {{said that}} the series' [...] "pseudoscience" [...] felt dubious, but noted the illusory [...] "Di-Swords" [...] as well-designed and a useful way to portray {{characters}} battling {{through the use of}} their thoughts; Carroll also enjoyed the use of [...] "Di-Swords" [...] in action scenes, but thought that it occurred too rarely. Beveridge similarly liked the detailed visuals for the special abilities some characters use. Santos and Carroll both disliked the character designs, calling them bland and stereotypical; Beveridge, however, <b>liked</b> <b>them,</b> and appreciated their [...] "solid feel". Santos, Carroll and Meek disliked the animation, with the former two citing off-model characters, frozen crowds, static conversation scenes and a lack of fluidity, and Meek calling it [...] "a black mark on Madhouse's usually stellar record". Rose, however, felt that the animation was [...] "fairly strong".|$|E
500|$|The initial jam {{sessions}} were problematic, as McIlrath was unaccustomed to Principe and Wleklinski's fast-paced style of play. McIlrath described these early sessions as [...] "the meeting of different worlds and worlds colliding", and noted {{how many of}} his friends questioned {{the future of the}} band. Despite these early issues, they were able to self-publish the extended play (EP) Transistor Revolt in 2000. The EP attracted the attention of the local punk community, including Fat Mike, the lead vocalist of NOFX and co-founder of the independent record label Fat Wreck Chords. Fat Mike offered to sign the band to a recording contract, with the stipulation that they change their name. He gave some suggestions, like Jimmy Cracked Corn And The I Don't Cares, although none of the band members <b>liked</b> <b>them.</b> Tintari suggested Rise Against, to which the band agreed upon.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{had mixed}} {{opinions}} on the Amiga version's graphics and sound: [...] and French magazine [...] reviewers <b>liked</b> <b>them,</b> but CU Amiga criticised the graphics as [...] "poorly detailed" [...] and the sound as [...] "simple". Other comments from critics included The One reviewer's lauding of the two-player mode, described as [...] "the best two-player racing game we've ever seen", Stuart Campbell of Amiga Power praising of the locations and control, although he criticised the [...] "limited" [...] single-player mode and lack of parallax scrolling. Paul Roundell of Amiga Action praised the originality, but criticised the head-to-head mode, saying it [...] "breaks the excitement", and a reviewer from Amiga Computing believed the tracks were [...] "entertaining" [...] and liked that they were made up of [...] "silly things". The vehicles racing in the environments was described by Steve Bradley of Amiga Format as [...] "absolutely bloody brilliant", and he also praised the addictiveness.|$|E
500|$|NWMP Commissioner Acheson G. Irvine ordered 200 Mark IIs in 1882, {{priced at}} C$15.75 each, which were shipped by London's Montgomery and Workman in November that year, {{arriving}} in December. They replaced the Adams. Irvine <b>liked</b> <b>them</b> so much that, {{in one of}} his final acts as Commissioner, he ordered another 600, which were delivered in September 1885. His replacement, Lawrence W. Herchmer, reported the force was entirely outfitted with Enfields (in all 1,079 were provided) and was pleased with them, but concerned about the [...]476 round being too potent. The first batch was stamped NWMP-CANADA (issue number between) after delivery; later purchases were not. They were top-break single- or double-action, and fitted with lanyard rings. Worn spindle arms would fail to hold empty cases on ejection, and worn pivot pins could cause barrels to become loose, resulting in inaccuracy. Its deep rifling would allow firing of slugs of between [...] diameter. Complaints began arising as early as 1887, influenced in part by the British switching to Webleys, and by 1896, hinge wear and barrel loosening were a real issue.|$|E
500|$|... "Material Girl" [...] {{was written}} by Peter Brown and Robert Rans, while Nile Rodgers {{produced}} the track. In 1986, Madonna told Company magazine, that although she did not write or create the song, the lyrical meaning and concept did apply to her situation at that point of time. She elaborated, [...] "I'm very career-oriented. You are attracted {{to people who are}} ambitious that way, too, like in the song 'Material Girl'. You are attracted to men who have material things because that's what pays the rents and buys you furs. That's the security. That lasts longer than emotions." [...] During a 2009 interview with Rolling Stone, Madonna was asked by interviewer Austin Scaggs, regarding her first feelings, after listening to the demos of [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] and [...] "Material Girl". Madonna responded by saying, [...] "I <b>liked</b> <b>them</b> both because they were ironic and provocative at the same time but also unlike me. I am not a materialistic person, and I certainly wasn't a virgin, and, by the way, how can you be like a virgin? I liked the play on words, I thought they were clever.

500|$|During an {{appearance}} on Top of the Pops, Morrissey appeared waving gladioli. A 2004 BBC Radio 2 feature on the song noted that the performance was most people's introduction to The Smiths and, [...] "therefore, to the weird, wordy world of Morrissey and the music of Johnny Marr". Uncut magazine, commentating on the nationally televised debut, wrote that [...] "Thursday evening when Manchester's feyest first appeared on Top of the Pops would be an unexpected pivotal cultural event {{in the lives of}} a million serious English boys. His very English, camp glumness was a revolt into Sixties kitchen-sink greyness against the gaudiness of the Eighties new wave music, as exemplified by Culture Club and their ilk. The Smiths' subject matter may have been 'squalid' but there was a purity of purpose about them that you messed with at your peril." [...] Noel Gallagher said of the performance: [...] "None of my mates <b>liked</b> <b>them</b> — they were more hooligan types. They came into work and said 'Fuckin' hell, did you see that poof on [...] "Top of the Pops" [...] with the bush in his back pocket?' But I thought it was life-changing." ...|$|E
500|$|Personal {{accounts}} of the battle frequently magnified an individual's own role or minimised those of rivals. The politics of the time were complex and complicated by ethnic divisions between native Russian nobility and those having second and third-generation German descent, leading to rivalry for positions {{in command of the}} army. Not only does a historian {{have to deal with the}} normal problem of a veteran looking back and recalling events as he or she would have <b>liked</b> <b>them</b> to have been, but in some cases outright malice was involved. Nor was this strictly a Russian event, as bickering and sabotage were known amongst the French marshals and their reporting generals. To [...] "lie like a bulletin" [...] was not just a French affair either, with Kutuzov in particular promoting an early form of misinformation that has continued to this day. Further distortions occurred during the Soviet years, when an adherence to a [...] "formula" [...] was the expectation during the Stalin years and for some time after that. The over-reliance of western histories on the battle and of the campaign on French sources, has been noted by later historians.|$|E
500|$|The studio {{recording}} on The Piper at the Gates of Dawn is the {{one that}} most listeners are familiar with, yet several other versions survive from both the recording studio and the stage. It was first recorded as a demo on 31 October 1966, recorded live-in-studio at Thompson Private Recording Company. This version was used as the audio sound to the film San Francisco, which was made by a friend of Barrett's, Anthony Stern. While filmmaker Peter Whitehead and his secondhand Stern were having a discussion, the topic about Pink Floyd was brought about by Stern, to which Whitehead told him, [...] "yeah, terrible music". Stern said that [...] "they're successful now", and suggest the pair go watch Pink Floyd, at their gig at the Royal College of Art. Whitehead recalled that they [...] "went to UFO and I <b>liked</b> <b>them.</b> Not connected to pop music, a long improvisatory quality, ideal for what I wanted." [...] Whitehead convinced Pink Floyd to record [...] "Interstellar Overdrive" [...] for a film he was working on. Before turning up at the recording studio, the band held a rehearsal, and the next day, 11 January 1967, went to Sound Techniques studios. The studio, which was originally a dairy factory, was run by engineers Geoff Frost and John Wood.|$|E
