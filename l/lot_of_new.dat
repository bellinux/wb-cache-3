25|$|The next {{album was}} delayed {{for almost three}} years as the band {{was looking for a}} new record label after {{finishing}} their deal with Delerium. In the meantime, they launched Metanoia (1998), a compilation of improvisations recorded during the Signify sessions, some of which were later shaped into songs. Finally, they signed to Snapper/K-Scope and the album Stupid Dream (1999) was issued. The album was a departure in style from all their previous works, in favour a more song-oriented direction, as a consequence this alienated some older fans but brought a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> ones. Its follow-up, Lightbulb Sun (2000), assured the fan base and solidified the ground of its predecessor. For this one, they worked with Dave Gregory of XTC, who provided string arrangements. A collection of EP tracks and out-takes from the previous two albums was launched a year after under the title of Recordings (2001).|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} part of the decade, sales were strong, thanks in no small part to the company's history of {{building}} small cars, which came into vogue in 1961. In both 1960 and 1961, Ramblers ranked in third place among domestic automobile sales, up from third on the strength of small-car sales, even in the face of a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> competition. Romney's strategic focus was very successful as reflected in the firm's healthy profits year after year. The company became completely debt-free.

Its new three-year labor contract also included generous annual improvement pay increases, as well as automatic cost-of-living raises.

25|$|While some whites {{responded with}} {{violence}} or exploitation of Mexicans, another recurring effort was Americanization. Since many Mexicans were now {{a part of}} the United States, it was expected that they would act like Americans. The national language in the U.S. is English, so it was thought that the Mexican Americans should be speaking English like the rest of Americans. In 1907, United States’ President Theodore Roosevelt wrote, “We have room for but one language in this country, and that is the English language, for we intend to see that the crucible turns our people out as Americans, of American nationality, and not as dwellers in a polyglot boarding house”. It was clear that a lot of Americans were hostile towards Spanish speaking Mexicans. The English Only movement is a political movement for establishing English as the only official language in the U.S., and using only English in official government operations. Learning a new language as an adult is a very difficult thing to do, so this effect of imperialism was challenging for a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> Americans.|$|E

I think we played a lot of texture instead of substance." [...] Series creator Chris Carter on the other hand claimed the episode {{was one of the most}} popular first-season episodes and thought the teaser and the scene with Mulder meeting Deep Throat at a shark tank were memorable.

500|$|Spielberg courted Jack Nicholson for {{the role}} of Edward Bloom, Sr. and towards this end, had August compose two {{additional}} drafts for Nicholson's part. August recalls: [...] "There was this thought that there wasn't enough for Jack Nicholson to do in the movie so we built new sequences.

[...] They included working class antiques such as a Hoosier cabinet, an old gas stove, and a Bakelite radio.
