5|$|Another $500,000 {{study was}} ordered in 2003 by the legislature, {{creating}} a new commerce corridor to link <b>Lewis</b> <b>County</b> {{in the south to}} the Canada–US border in the north. However the study showed that a highway existing north of I-90 was not economically feasible. The study proposed a toll road only for trucks, since the presence of passenger cars would discourage truck drivers from using the new alternate route. The highway was estimated to cost between $13.5 and $19 billion.|$|E

NY177 originally began at US11 when it was assigned in 1930. It was extended west to its present terminus in the 1950s following the construction of I-81.|$|E

5|$|In Black River, {{northeast}} of Watertown, NY3 intersects NY342 at the southwestern {{tip of the}} Fort Drum Military Reservation. NY3 follows {{the southern edge of}} the base to Deferiet, where NY3 turns south to follow the Black River while NY3A continues along the border of Fort Drum. NY3 follows the river to Carthage, where it overlaps NY126 briefly before heading northeast to rejoin NY3A at Fargo. NY3 forms the southern boundary of the base from NY3A east to just west of the Jefferson-Lewis County line; however, near Natural Bridge, the Fort Drum boundary heads due north before becoming delimited by the Indian River. NY3, meanwhile, traverses the river and enters <b>Lewis</b> <b>County.</b>|$|E

5|$|NY177 {{continues}} winding {{itself to}} the southeast through the town of Rodman, as a rural two-lane highway. After Williams Road, the route makes several bends in {{to the south and}} east, straightening out eastward at an intersection with the northern terminus of CR95. This eastward progression remains stagnant as NY177 continues eastward past CR189. After a short, empty stretch of roadway, NY177 crosses the county line into <b>Lewis</b> <b>County,</b> where it enters the town of Pinckney. Through Pinckney, the route turns to the northeast, crossing Old State Road before bending and turning southeastward into the hamlet of Barnes Corners. In Barnes Corners, the dense forest retreats for a rural community, where NY177 intersects with CR21 and CR2 (Seven-by-Nine Road). CR21 is the former southern terminus of NY194, a designation eliminated in 1980.|$|E

2500|$|Due to {{the lower}} wind speeds than those that {{occurred}} in western New York, the snow in northern New York was not as hard packed according to Ben Kolker of the NWS office in Buffalo. Northern New York did have significant snowfall, though, along with significant drifting. On February 1, Jefferson and <b>Lewis</b> <b>counties</b> were among the counties added to the initial federal emergency declaration, and on February 5, were among the counties declared major disaster areas. The New York District of the USACE assisted with snow clearing by having contractors clear a total of [...] of roadway in Jefferson and <b>Lewis</b> <b>counties.</b> U.S. Marines were at Camp Drum (near Watertown) for cold-weather training, {{and some of them}} assisted in Jefferson and <b>Lewis</b> <b>counties</b> with fourteen 25-ton Amtrack vehicles, The National Guard assisted with track vehicles; U.S. Army troops from Camp Drum also helped with disaster relief.|$|R
5|$|When NY812 {{was first}} assigned, it was locally {{maintained}} from NY126 in Croghan to NY3 in Diana and from NY3 in Pitcairn to NY58 in Fowler. The {{section of the}} route between NY126 and the Croghan village line was maintained by the village of Croghan; however, {{the rest of the}} two locally maintained sections were maintained by Lewis and St. Lawrence counties. Most of the Lewis County-owned section was co-designated as CR11; however, the short piece between the Croghan village line and Belfort Road was part of CR10. In St. Lawrence County, NY812 was overlaid on the existing CR73 from NY3 to Stone Road, CR99 between Stone Road and Balmat, and CR56 from Balmat to Fowler. The state of New York assumed ownership and maintenance of NY812 between Croghan and Diana on April1, 1980, as part of a highway maintenance swap between the state and <b>Lewis</b> <b>County</b> that transferred NY194 to the county. Ownership of NY812 from Pitcairn to Fowler was transferred to the state on September1, 1982, as part of a highway maintenance swap between the state and St. Lawrence County.|$|E
5|$|Alexander F. Reichert was {{appointed}} by the Supreme Court to argue the case for Lara. Reichert argued that an Indian tribe had no inherent sovereignty in regards to non-member Indians, but only the power that Congress decided to give the tribe, citing Duro, Wheeler, and Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe to support his argument. He stated {{that it was the}} place of the Supreme Court, not Congress, to determine the inherent sovereignty of the tribe. Lara argued that since the tribe had no such inherent sovereignty, it could only prosecute a non-member Indian based upon federal sovereignty, which would make a subsequent Federal prosecution a violation of the prohibition of double jeopardy. It was noted that members of Indian tribes were at the same time United States citizens, and protected under the constitution {{in the same manner as}} any other citizen. Reichert stated that Duro was decided as a constitutional issue, not as a matter of common law, and it was the Court's place to determine the issue, not the place of Congress. To subject Lara to a prosecution by a tribal court, which was not subject to the Bill of Rights, would deprive Lara of his rights as a United States citizen. Lara's position was supported by amicus curiae briefs filed by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, <b>Lewis</b> <b>County,</b> Idaho, (along with several other counties), the Citizen's Equal Rights Foundation, and T. Morris, E. Morris, and R. Morris (individual Indians).|$|E
