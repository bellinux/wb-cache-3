At one point, from 1959 to 1983, Penn State had won 25 consecutive meetings between the two. The series ended in 1992 with Penn State commencing Big Ten Conference play in 1993.

5|$|Notably, {{both the}} highest and lowest judges' scores are omitted to cancel out any discrepancy, giving a maximum of 60 style points. A perfect jump on a K200 hill would {{therefore}} garner a minimum of 180 points (120 distance points + 60 style points) or more, depending on bonus points. However, such a scenario is only an example and not representative of the highly variable nature of the sport. Gaining one or more scores of 20 is very rare, and five is extremely rare. Generally, a good to excellent jump {{can be expected to}} receive judges' scores of 18 to 19.5. While a lower score for style puts an athlete at the risk of being <b>less</b> <b>competitive,</b> this may be mitigated or even nullified if they have attained substantial bonus points for distance.|$|E

5|$|The {{population}} of Western Pennsylvania was 17,000 in 1790. Among the {{farmers in the}} region, the whiskey excise was immediately controversial, with many people on the frontier arguing that it unfairly targeted westerners. Whiskey was a popular drink, and farmers often supplemented their incomes by operating small stills. Farmers living west of the Appalachian Mountains distilled their excess grain into whiskey, which was easier and more profitable to transport over the mountains than the more cumbersome grain. A whiskey tax would make western farmers <b>less</b> <b>competitive</b> with eastern grain producers. Additionally, cash was always in short supply on the frontier, so whiskey often served as a medium of exchange. For poorer people who were paid in whiskey, the excise was essentially an income tax that wealthier easterners did not pay.|$|E
5|$|Addressing the mercantilist {{belief that}} {{monetary}} intervention {{could cause a}} perpetually favourable balance of trade, Cantillon developed a specie-flow mechanism foreshadowing future international monetary equilibrium theories. He suggested that in countries with a high quantity of money in circulation, prices will increase and therefore become <b>less</b> <b>competitive</b> in relation to countries {{where there is a}} relative scarcity of money. Thus, Cantillon also held that increases in the supply of money, regardless of the source, cause increases in the price level and therefore reduce the competitiveness of a particular nation's industry in relation to a nation with lower prices. However, Cantillon did not believe that international markets tended toward equilibrium, and instead suggested that government hoard specie to avoid rising prices and falling competitiveness. Furthermore, he suggested that a favourable balance of trade can be maintained by offering a better product and retaining qualitative competitiveness. Cantillon's preference towards a favourable balance of trade possibly stemmed from the mercantilist belief in exchange being a zero-sum game, in which one party gains at the expense of another.|$|E
5|$|The new Holden WB {{commercial}} vehicles and the Statesman WB limousines {{were introduced in}} 1980. However, the designs, based on the HQ and updated HJ, HX and HZ models from the 1970s were <b>less</b> <b>competitive</b> than similar models in Ford's lineup. Thus, Holden abandoned those vehicle classes altogether in 1984. Sales of the Commodore also fell, {{with the effects of}} the 1979 energy crisis lessening, {{and for the first time}} the Commodore lost ground to the Ford Falcon. Sales in other segments also suffered when competition from Ford intensified, and other Australian manufacturers: Mitsubishi, Nissan and Toyota gained market share. When released in 1982, the Camira initially generated good sales, which later declined because buyers considered the 1.6-litre engine underpowered, and the car's build and ride quality below-average. The Camira lasted just seven years, and contributed to Holden's accumulated losses of over A$500million by the mid-1980s.|$|E

40|$|A {{firm has}} {{competitive}} relationships with its rivals, which themselves have competitive {{relationships with other}} rivals. Dyadic competitive relationships between firms compose competition networks among firms. The {{purpose of this study}} is to explain competitive dynamics from a network perspective. By integrating an awareness-motivation-capability perspective, which primarily theorizes the dyadic competitive relationships between two firms, with a social network perspective, which mainly scrutinizes the influence of network ties and structure on firm behavior, I have investigated the influence of a firm 2 ̆ 7 s relational and structural embeddedness in competition networks on the intensity of the firm 2 ̆ 7 s competitive activity, which is composed of action frequency, variety, and magnitude. The main thesis is that a focal firm will engage in <b>less</b> intense <b>competitive</b> activity when it is embedded in a competition network that induces more intense rivals 2 ̆ 7 competitive activity. Since intense retaliation by rivals decreases the focal firm 2 ̆ 7 s performance, it will intend to avoid provoking this rivals 2 ̆ 7 intense retaliation. By using a sample of petrochemical companies in Japan from 1986 to 1994, as predicted, I found that a focal firm engages in <b>less</b> intense <b>competitive</b> activity in conditions of stronger inward competitive ties or more betweenness centrality in its competition network. ...|$|R
30|$|For South America, {{with primary}} {{commodity}} booms and {{high interest rates}} attracting huge inflows of speculative capital, appreciation may have made most of its manufactured products <b>less</b> internationally <b>competitive.</b> In some cases cheaper manufactured imports may have been partially controlled through the countervailing effect of stimulated demand for domestic manufactured goods through temporary sales tax cuts (as happened in Brazil in 2011 – 2012, {{or in some cases}} through the lower costs of imported intermediate goods). The final effect of such appreciation in the industrial sector remains therefore inconclusive.|$|R

40|$|This paper compares {{unit cost}} {{competitiveness}} of the world's 22 major airlines over the 1986 - 93 period. First, a unit cost index for aggregate output is computed via a multilateral index procedure. A translog variable cost function is estimated {{and used to}} decompose the unit cost differentials into potential sources: input prices, network and output attributes, and efficiency. The results of the unit cost decomposition are used to construct a cost competitiveness indicator after removing the effects of network and output attributes. Our results for 1993 are: (a) Asian carriers (except Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways) were generally more cost competitive than the major U. S. carriers, mostly due to their substantially lower input prices; (b) Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways were over 50 % <b>less</b> cost <b>competitive</b> than American Airlines mainly because of their high input prices; (c) major European carriers were 7 % (British Airways) - 42 % (Scandinavian Airlines Systems) <b>less</b> cost <b>competitive</b> than American Airlines, because of higher input prices and lower efficiency; (d) among the U. S. carriers, American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta were similar in cost competitiveness, while Northwest and Continental enjoyed, respectively, 5 and 12 % cost competitiveness over American Airlines; (e) exchange rate fluctuation has had considerable effects on the cost competitive position of Japan Airlines and Lufthansa. ...|$|R

In our April 2004 report on competitive foods (GAO- 04 - 673), we reported that several states had enacted competitive food policies that were more restrictive than federal regulations. However, these policies differed widely in the type and extent of restrictions. In addition, it was unclear how and to what extent states were monitoring compliance with these policies.
