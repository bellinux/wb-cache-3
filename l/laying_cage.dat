40|$|SEVERAL {{investigators}} have shown sulfaquinoxaline {{to be an}} effective coccidiostatic agent against Eimeria te-nella and Eimeria necatrix infections. This report deals with the effect of sulfaquinox-aline against Eimeria acervulina infection in young pullets in egg production. PROCEDURE Sixty-five White Leghorn pullets were reared under controlled conditions to keep them free of coccidial infection. At about 10 weeks of age each bird was placed in an individual <b>laying</b> <b>cage.</b> When they were laying about 50 percent egg production they were divided into 5 lots of 13 birds each. An effort was made to make an equal distribution of the birds on the basis of body weight and the time of laying the first egg. Beginning at this period of lot designation the birds were weighed individually twice each week at 3 or 4 day intervals. The pullets were fed an all-mash ration which was supple-mented with oyster shell, when egg pro-duction started. * Sulfaquinoxaline was supplied through the courtesy of the Medical Department, Merck an...|$|E
40|$|In {{their journey}} from the <b>laying</b> <b>cage</b> to {{shipments}} out of an egg production operation, table eggs encounter multiple shock events. While all agricultural commodities run the possibility of damage {{during the course of}} production, shell eggs are particularly susceptible to being cracked or broken during the production operation. A typical egg production facility experiences 2 % to 7 % checks (a partial mechanical failure to the egg shell) during handling, packaging and transportation of shell eggs. It has been estimated that the total losses to the U. S. egg industry due to checks and breakage of eggs during production amounts to over $ 247 million per year. Research was conducted using a data recorder at Cal Poly Eggs (San Luis Obispo, California) to evaluate shocks sustained by the eggs going through the production operation. The production line for this operation resembles a typical commercial egg production facility. This study evaluated shock levels sustained by the eggs going through a typical production operation. The results and recommendations to help decrease damage due to shocks are presented in this paper. This data can be used to improve production lines at any egg production facility to decrease the amount of checks or breakage and to increase the profits...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: There {{has been}} growing social and {{scientific}} interest {{in recent years in}} laying hen welfare. Stress is an animal welfare parameter that has been found to alter laying hens ’ physiology and social behaviour. Our study aims to test the effects of the different housing systems (<b>laying</b> <b>cage,</b> barn and free range) on the laying hens ’ welfare. In this study we have taken a new approach to determine stress levels by measuring corticosterone and androgen concentrations in the eggs laid by hens housed in different farming systems. We found no relationship between commercial egg production type and androgen (testosterone and androstenedione) levels. Contrary to our expectations, we observed an almost significant positive trend between corticosterone levels and welfare quality: free range eggs contained the highest corticosterone concentrations. This would initially suggest that free range hens are more stressed than battery or barn hens. However, considering that chronic stressors can reduce an organism’s hormonal output, our results could suggest that the low levels of corticosterone in battery hens are an indication of a chronic stress situation. Our data suggest that measuring corticosterone in eggs is a novel non-invasive method to determine stress levels in laying hens. This study would however need to be combined with a number of parameters (health, production and behaviour) to get an encompassing measure of laying hen welfare...|$|E

40|$|Since the {{publication}} of Animal Machines (Harrison, 1964), there has been wide-spread public pressure in Europe—supported by European institutions—to “ban the battery cage. ” The European Union (EU) and national governments (particularly in Northern Europe) funded research on noncage systems for egg production and en-riched cages. In 1986, the EU passed a Directive specifying a minimum size for cages, but public opinion—again particularly in the North—continued to require more. A market sector emerged that would pay more for noncage eggs. Denmark, Sweden, and Switzerland passed more stringent legislation {{than the rest of}} Europe. A 1999 Direc-tive with details based on advice from the EU’s Scientific Veterinary Committee will phase out conventional <b>laying</b> <b>cages</b> but allow enriched cages. Implementation de-pends on various factors, including negotiations in the World Trade Organization. In the next 10 years, however, major changes to the housing of most laying hens in Eu-rope almost certainly will occur. Similar changes in other countries will follow. As in Europe, change probably will be piecemeal, affected both by public pressure and by all sectors of society: producers, retailers, consumers, legislators, and the media. On June 15, 1999, the new European Union (EU) Directive on welfare of laying hens was passed, which requires conventional <b>laying</b> <b>cages</b> to be phased out by 2012.

The dietary regimens consisted of either a step-down protein, high energy feeding program; a step-down protein, low energy program; a step-up protein, high energy program; or a step-up protein, low energy program. At 150 days of age all pullets were housed 2 birds per 25. 4 X 45. 7 cm <b>laying</b> <b>cage</b> and fed a standard layer diet (16 % protein). The experiment utilized 2880 birds grown on the floor in a conventional growing house. At 140 days of age, birds subjected to the step-up protein feeding programs were 82 g smaller in mean body weight, had higher mortality, and consumed less feed than the birds on the step-down protein feeding programs. Body weights at 140 days of age were 1. 17 and 1. 09 kg for the step-down and step-up feeding programs, respectively. Energy levels fed had no significant effect on pullet weight, feed consumed, or mortality to 140 days of age. During the laying phase, hens that had been on the step-down protein feeding program reached 50 % production 2. 0 days earlier than birds subjected to the step-up protein feeding program. Hen-day production for the step-down and step-up pullet feeding systems based on 308 days' records was 76. 09 and 76. 86 %, respectively. Feed efficiency and mature body weight were not significantly affected by grower feeding programs.

Two years old White Leghorn hens were used in these experiments. They were kept in uncontrolled environment which consisted of individual <b>laying</b> <b>cages</b> without artificial light and were fed a commercial all-mash laying ration as a basal diet. All eggs that were broken out were scored using Roche yolk colour fan and the serum xanthophyll content was determined by the method of Wilson. A declines in egg production and feed consumption were observed as the fall months went by, and then egg production paused steadily almost to the end of the experimental period. It was observed during this period that hens which lay at a heigh rate of production deposit fewer xanthophyll in the blood serum than hens lay at a low rate. About pause in laying the yolk colours were still different but the depth decreased somewhat, while the serum xanthophyll content increased relatively at high level. The great increase in serum xanthophyll content was when the hens paused in laying. This increase occurred because of dietary xanthophyll that could not be deposited in the egg yolk.

Although the effects of lactose on calci-um absorption of laying hens have not been studied as yet, we have tested its effect on the general calcium metabolism as reflected in the deposition of this mineral in the egg shell. If lactose were to stimulate calcium absorption in the laying hen, and if calcium absorption were the limiting factor in the transfer of calcium to the shell, then lac-tose supplementation should result in in-creased egg shell deposition.

In a second experiment, pullets from the four strains were selected based on body weight at 18 wk of age (approximately 1, 270 vs 1, 650 g). Each weight group and strain was again represented by eight replicate groups of four birds. In Experiment 1, there were no strain or rearing diet effects on egg production (P> 0. 05). Rearing diet had little long-term effect on any adult characteristics. There were significant (P < 0. 01) strain effects on body weight, feed intake, and egg weight, although these were independent of rearing diet. In Experiment 2, regardless of bird strain, the pullets with smaller body weight matured more slowly (P < 0. 01) and produced less total egg mass to 70 wk age (P < 0. 05). These smaller birds ate less feed and produced smaller eggs (P < 0. 01). There were strain effects, independent of 18 -wk body weight, for egg weight and eggshell quality (P < 0. 01).

The birds were housed as pairs in <b>laying</b> <b>cages</b> at 22 and 20 wk of age (Hatches 1 and 2, respectively). The laying phase was divided into 28 -day periods. In Periods 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11, samples of hens were video recorded for 8 h. In Period 13, direct visual observations were made {{of the behavior of}} individually identified hens. Eleven production-related variables were recorded throughout the laying phase. Feather scores were assessed in Periods 3, 6, 9, and 12. Body weight, lesions to the feet, and claw length were recorded in Periods 6 and 13. Spearman rank correlations were calculated between video-recorded behavioral variables and measures of production and physical condition. The data from direct visual observations were used for heritability estimates of behavioral traits. Eating and standing were positively correlated with egg production, whereas sitting and, for hens derived from male parental Stock 1, resting were negatively correlated with production. Inactivity also coincided with poorer plumage condition and higher body weight. For the offspring of male parental Stock 2, behavioral actions frequently performed in stereotyped manner, e. g., cage pecking and toe pecking, were positively associated with egg production. No significant additive genetic variation for behavior was evident among sires; however, for dams, fairly large heritability estimates occurred for a number of behavioral states. The apparent absence of additive genetic variability among sires for behavior may have been due to genetic fixation at gene loci which control behavior in the stocks acquired from the commercial breeder.

In broiler production worldwide, birds are mainly kept on litter. Recently the EU agreed on a new Directive to set standards for maximum bird density. However, this is not considered likely to have a great impact on global trade. At present, the difference in animal conditions, including bird density, in Brazil and Thailand is limited compared to the EU. In egg production the majority of commercial layers are kept in <b>laying</b> <b>cages.</b> There is wide variation in space allowance per bird from 300 to 400 cm in Brazil, Ukraine and India towards the current minimum of 550 cm(2) per hen in the EU. After 2012, hens in the EU will be kept in enriched cages with a minimum space allowance of 750 cm(2) per hen. It is expected that this {{will have an impact on}} world trade in egg products and especially egg powder. Trade in table eggs will continue to be limited to the local region. The EU is considering the use of labelling to provide consumers with more information concerning the standard of production. Another option could be to use financial mechanisms such as taxes or tariffs to prevent imports from other countries with lower standards. The likelihood of a measure being challenged would depend on how difficult it was for exporters outside the EU to meet the requirements...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} was conducted at Bangladesh Agricultural University Poultry Farm, Mymensingh to evaluate the effect of different levels and sources of calcium on egg production and egg shell quality of Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) up to 23 weeks of age. For that purpose a total number of 108 Japanese quails aged 20 week were fed on diets containing different levels (2. 5 %, 2. 75 % and 3. 0 %) of dietary calcium from different sources eg. Oyster shell, limestone and Calcium premix. They {{were placed in the}} experimental cages. Six birds were considered for a replication of each treatment. The birds were reared in clean <b>laying</b> <b>cages</b> an open sided house. The experimental quails were exposed to identical care and management throughout the experimental period. Feed and water were offered ad libitum. Eggs were collected twice daily at morning and evening. The number of eggs laid by birds in each replication was recorded daily. The external quality of collected eggs were measured weekly from each treatment and level randomly. No significant difference (p> 0. 05) in egg weight, shell weight, shell percentage, except egg production and shell thickness was noted due to variation of different levels and calcium sources. But as the birds were getting older calcium premix produced better shell quality than oyster shell and limestone. It was concluded that any of these calcium sources can be considered for laying Japanese quail but calcium premix produces better shell quality at later age. This result also suggested that a level of 2. 5 % calcium increases egg weight and shell thickness, while 2. 75 % increases body weight and shell weight and 3 % increases egg production and shell percentage...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the effects of different dietary vitamin combinations on the egg quality and vitamin concentrations in the eggs of commercial laying hens. A total of 1, 800 25 -week-old Lohman pink-shell hens {{were randomly assigned to}} four dietary vitamin treatments as follows: NRC(1994) level, NRC (1994) level with Hy. D® (25 -hydroxy-cholecalciferol), Local level (current average industry level in China) and OVN® level (optimum vitamin nutrition level), with 10 replicates per treatment and 45 layers per replicate. Hens were housed in commercial <b>laying</b> <b>cages</b> with three birds per cage and given ad libitum access to feed. Results showed the hens that received the fortified vitamin levels in the OVN® treatment had a significantly (p< 0. 05) lower number of cracked (. 47 %) and dirty eggs (. 27 %), and increased egg deposition of vitamin B 12, folic acid, vitamin A, vitamin D, 25 -OH-D 3, vitamin E, vitamin B 1, biotin and pantothenate (p< 0. 05). Treatments had no significant effect on egg-shape index, egg specific gravity, Haugh units and eggshell thickness. Hens fed the NRC-Hy. D® combination also experienced a significant decrease in cracked and dirty eggs (. 70 % and. 44 %, respectively) and an increased deposition of 25 -OH-D 3 in comparison with the NRC treatment. Results of the present study suggest that that the Local treatment was able to improve egg quality parameters of laying hens, but resulted in more cracked and dirty eggs. OVN® reduced the number of cracked eggs and dirty eggs, and improved the deposition of several vitamins in eggs. With the addition of Hy. D®, eggshell strength and 25 -OH-D 3 deposition in eggs were also improved, and cracked and dirty egg rates declined...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Experiments were {{conducted}} to determine the kind and amount of endogenous hormonal activity present in various sources of poultry excreta processed for use as livestock feed. These experiments {{were conducted}} to determine: 1) the presence of both androgenic and estrogenic activity in poultry excreta; 2) the amount of activity found; and 3) the effect of processing methods, such as dehydration, upon the level of hormonal activity. Experiments in which chick comb growth was bioassayed showed that <b>caged</b> <b>laying</b> hen excreta processed by house fly larvae contained androgenic activity that ranged from 2. 18 to 9. 36 jug- of testosterone equivalents per gram of dried excreta. This activity was not present in fresh excreta and was not affected by drying times or temperatures up to 48 hr. at lOCPC. In rat uterine growth assays, fresh, dried <b>caged</b> <b>laying</b> hen excreta contained up to 1. 6 Mg- of estradiol equivalents per gram of dried excreta. Holding excreta for 5 to 7 days under wither aerobic or anaerobic conditions reduced estrogenic activity, but drying temperatures up to 100 ° C. {{did not appear to}} affect the level of these hormones in excreta...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Effects of {{sequential}} {{changes in}} dietary protein on growth from 0 to 20 weeks {{of age and}} on egg production from 20 to 72 weeks of age were evaluated with White Leghorn chick-ens. Four dietary treatments were compared. They consisted of three dietary regimens wherein an 18 % crude protein (CP) diet was fed to 1, 2, or 3 weeks of age (Treatments 1, 2, and 3, respec-tively) and then common 12, IS, and 18 % CP diets to 8, 14, and 20 weeks, respectively. These three regimens were compared with a control regimen (Treatment 4) that consisted of feeding 18, 15, and 12 % CP diets to 6, 14, and 20 weeks of age, respectively. At 20 weeks of age, 144 birds from each treatment were moved into <b>laying</b> <b>cages</b> for the subsequent 52 weeks of egg production. In comparison with birds on the control feeding regimen, those reared under Treatments 1, 2, and 3 consumed significantly less feed during the 20 -week growing period. Birds of Treatments 2 and 3 consumed significantly more protein than those of Treatments 1 and 4. By feeding a 12 % CP diet from 1, 2, and 3 to 8 weeks of age, body weights were {{significantly lower than the}} average body weight of the control birds, approximately 20, 17, and 13 %, respectively, by 6 weeks of age, but only 2 to 4 % at 16 weeks of age, and by nonsignificant amounts at 28 weeks of age. Treatment 1 birds consumed 1. 8 % (significantly) less feed per unit body weight and were 2. 6 % (significantly) lighter at 20 weeks of age compared with the control birds. Mortality during the growing period was not influenced by dietary treatment. Treatment differences for hen-housed production, hen-day production, livability, egg weight, feed/gram egg, feed/hen-day, shell quality, and Haugh unit scores over the 52 weeks of production were not significant. Birds fed the 12 % CP diet from 1 and 2 to 8 weeks of age subsequently consumed 4. 8 and 3. 7 % less feed per dozen eggs than the conventionally fed birds during the production year...|$|R

Feed deprivation caused an immediate loss in breaking force of the tibia (P < 0. 05). Although bone strength increased during subsequent re-feeding, values {{did not return to}} prefast levels (P < 0. 05). Feed withdrawal did cause a reduction in modulus of elasticity of the tibia (P < 0. 05), which is a potential benefit for bones that are more resilient to damage; this character-(Key words: layer, bone integrity, bone histology...|$|R
