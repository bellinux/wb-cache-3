5|$|The agents {{track down}} Weems, a {{handyman}} at an apartment building. He refuses {{to testify against}} Cutrona. Weems has a fascination with Rube Goldberg machines. As such, his apartment is filled with them. After meeting with Weems, Scully concludes {{that there is no}} X-File, but Mulder believes that his <b>luck</b> <b>is</b> the X-File in question. As the agents begin to leave the complex, one of Cutrona's enforcers comes to kill Weems. However, the assassin dies in an improbable cascade of events reminiscent of a Rube Goldberg machine: after being distracted when Mulder buzzes the intercom (when he forgot the car keys), he accidentally shoots a lamp that knocks over an ironing board, then trips over the ironing board and ends up getting strangled in a fan. The two agents rush back up stairs and find Weems unscathed. Mulder notes that Weems was the sole survivor of a commuter jet crash that killed 20 people in December 1989, where he was placed in Seat 13 of Flight 7: lucky numbers.|$|E

25|$|Warren Buffett {{has also}} argued against EMH, {{most notably in}} his 1984 {{presentation}} The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville, saying the preponderance of value investors among the world's best money managers rebuts the claim of EMH proponents that <b>luck</b> <b>is</b> the reason some investors appear more successful than others.

25|$|In {{round-robin}} tournaments, {{each participant}} plays every other participant {{an equal number}} of times. Round-robin tournaments involving four participants are known as quads. Round-robin tournaments are often used for small groups because the element of <b>luck</b> <b>is</b> reduced when every player plays everyone else. Rating categories are sometimes used to separate players of different levels into different round-robin groups. The World Chess Federation, the Australian Chess Federation, and the United States Chess Federation all use different categorization scales to distinguish player ability. Similar to the Round-robin style is the Scheveningen system. The Scheveningen system is often used to face two chess teams against each other, where each player on one team plays each player on the other team.|$|E
25|$|Several {{movies were}} filmed, either {{completely}} or partly about Murrow. 1986, HBO broadcast the made-for-cable biographical movie, Murrow, with Daniel J. Travanti {{in the title}} role, and Robert Vaughn in a supporting role. In the 1999 film The Insider, Lowell Bergman, a television producer for the CBS news magazine 60 Minutes, played by Al Pacino, is confronted by Mike Wallace, played by Christopher Plummer, after an exposé {{of the tobacco industry}} is edited down to suit CBS management and then, itself, gets exposed in the press for the self-censorship. Wallace passes Bergman an editorial printed in The New York Times, which accuses CBS of betraying the legacy of Edward R. Murrow. Good Night, and Good <b>Luck</b> <b>is</b> a 2005 Oscar-nominated film directed, co-starring and co-written by George Clooney about the conflict between Murrow and Joseph McCarthy on See It Now. Murrow is portrayed by actor David Strathairn, who received an Oscar nomination. In the film, Murrow's conflict with CBS boss William Paley occurs immediately after his skirmish with McCarthy.|$|E
500|$|Chapter five, [...] "Survivals, revivals and reinterpretations", {{continues}} Merrifield's {{exploration of}} ritual practices in Christian Europe. He examines Late- and Post-Medieval items {{that have been}} deposited in rivers, including swords and pilgrimage souvenirs, speculating that their deposition might represent a survival from the pagan tradition of casting votive offerings into water. He speculates that the contemporary practice of throwing a coin into a fountain for good <b>luck</b> <b>is</b> a further survival of the custom. He then discusses the evidence for ritual foundation deposits under buildings, noting the widespread Medieval deposition of an animal's head or jaw in a construction's foundations, presumably for protective magical purposes. Proceeding {{to deal with the}} Late- and Post-Medieval deposition of pots under foundations, he looks at their place in churches, where it was believed that they aided the acoustics. Continuing with this theme, he discusses the British folk custom of burying a horse's head under the floor to improve a building's acoustics, speculating as to whether this was a survival of the pagan foundation deposit custom. Rounding off the chapter, Merrifield examines at magical items that have been intentionally placed in the walls, chimneys and roofs of buildings in Britain, in particular the widespread use of dead cats and old shoes.|$|E

50|$|<b>Luck</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} two settlements, Luck on Big Butternut Lake, and West Denmark further west, {{founded by}} Danish immigrants in 1869 {{on the north}} and west shores of Little Butternut Lake and extending out for a few miles. The two settlements knew it was impractical to remain as separate entities, but disagreed about which would be the center of town. The railroad settled the issue when it laid tracks near the eastern settlement. <b>Luck</b> <b>was</b> not incorporated until 1905, several years later than most surrounding villages. <b>Luck</b> <b>was</b> once home to the Duncan Toys Company Yo-Yo factory headquarters.|$|R

[...] Ron Reed, leading Australian sports writer, in a syndicated piece for all News Corporation tabloids including the Melbourne Herald Sun wrote: ‘Miller’s <b>Luck</b> <b>is</b> an excellent biography. It’s an honest portrayal of the imperfect human being behind the heroic legend.’ AAP’s Jim Morton wrote: ‘Keith Miller is an enlightening biography of the test all-rounder, who was a cool and carefree match-winner on the field and a playboy philanderer off it.’ Jim Rosenthal in the UK Daily Mail ranked the book as the number one sports book of 2006. The UK Cricket Society named it as the cricket biography of the year and it was short-listed for the Cricket Writers’ book of the Year. Archie Mac on Cricket Web’s book review wrote: ‘This is Roland Perry’s eighth book on cricket, and for my money his best…the result is not just a great cricketing book, but also a complete portrait of a fascinating life.’ ...|$|E

Reflecting on his performance at his seventh consecutive national championships, he said [...] "I think persistence plays a little part in it. <b>Luck</b> <b>is</b> remnant of desire. Just hanging in there". After making appearances at European meets, he prepared for the 200m at the 1995 World Championships in Athletics. After winning his heat and quarter-final races, he stepped up his performance to run 20.32seconds for second place in the semi-finals behind Frankie Fredericks. In the final he ran a personal record time of 20.18seconds and was rewarded with the bronze medal, having finished behind Fredericks and Johnson. Williams had won his first world medal at a major championships at the age of 29. He closed the season with a fifth place at the IAAF Grand Prix Final.|$|E
2500|$|Felix Felicis, more {{commonly}} known as Liquid Luck, grants whoever drinks it unusually good luck. The time span of this luck depends on the amount imbibed. Liquid <b>Luck</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the hardest}} potions to make, as noted by Horace Slughorn; [...] "It has to be cooked for 6 months on an extremely complicated formula, and if you make a tiniest mistake, the consequences are severe". Because of its properties, it is banned in all sporting events, competitions and examinations. In Rowling's original narrative, the potion looks akin to liquid gold. However, in the movie adaptation it is clear and water-like. Slughorn also noted that excessive consumption results in side effects that include giddiness and overzealousness, among other effects that are related to overconfidence. In Half-Blood Prince, Harry pretends to give some to Ron so that he will do well at Quidditch. Ron's luck turns for the better, with the confidence working as a placebo. Harry does use most of it later in the same novel in order to extract the true memory about Tom Riddle and Horcruxes from Slughorn (though it also has the pleasant side effect of causing Dean Thomas and Ginny Weasley to end their relationship), and the rest is shared between Ron, Hermione, Neville Longbottom and Ginny the night Death Eaters break into Hogwarts.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} luck, or Fortune, is {{frequently}} referenced throughout Antony and Cleopatra, portrayed as an elaborate [...] "game" [...] that the characters participate in. An element of Fate lies within the play's concept of Chance, {{as the subject}} of Fortune/Chance's favour at any particular moment becomes the most successful character. Shakespeare represents Fortune through elemental and astronomical imagery that recalls the characters' awareness of the [...] "unreliability of the natural world". This {{calls into question the}} extent to which the characters' actions influence the resulting consequences, and whether the characters are subject to the preferences of Fortune or Chance. Antony eventually realises that he, like other characters, is merely [...] "Fortune's knave," [...] a mere card in the game of Chance rather than a player. This realization suggests that Antony realises that he is powerless in relation to the forces of Chance, or Fortune. The manner in which the characters deal with their <b>luck</b> <b>is</b> of great importance, therefore, as they may destroy their chances of luck by taking advantage of their fortune to excessive lengths without censoring their actions, Antony did. Scholar Marilyn Williamson notes that the characters may spoil their Fortune by, [...] "riding too high" [...] on it, as Antony did by ignoring his duties in Rome and spending time in Egypt with Cleopatra. While Fortune does play a large role in the characters' lives, they do have ability to exercise free will, however; as Fortune is not as restrictive as Fate. Antony's actions suggest this, as he is able to use his free will to take advantage of his luck by choosing his own actions.|$|E
