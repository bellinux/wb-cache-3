5|$|The ship's crew {{compartments}} {{were arranged}} {{such that the}} officers were accommodated in the forecastle. This arrangement {{was found to be}} unsatisfactory, and not repeated in later classes. Von der Tann was designed to be fitted with a <b>lattice</b> <b>mast,</b> but the ship received standard masts instead. In 1914, spotting posts were attached to the masts in order to observe the fall of artillery fire. In 1915, seaplane trials were conducted on Von der Tann, and a crane was attached on the aft deck to lift the seaplane aboard the ship. Von der Tann had originally been equipped with anti-torpedo nets, but these were removed towards the end of 1916.|$|E
5|$|In early 1924, Florida {{took part}} in the Fleet Problem III maneuvers, where she and her sister Utah acted as stand-ins for the new s. In June 1924, Florida was taken out of service for a {{modernization}} at the Boston Navy Yard, which lasted from 1 April 1925 to 1 November 1926. During the reconstruction, her deck armor was strengthened and anti-torpedo blisters were installed to increase her resistance to underwater damage. Her secondary battery was rearranged to improve its efficiency, and four of her 5-inch guns, which were mounted in sponsons, were removed. She was also reboilered with four White-Forster oil-fired models that had been removed from the battleships and battlecruisers scrapped {{as a result of the}} Washington Naval Treaty. Her Parsons turbines were replaced with new Curtis geared turbines and her two funnels were trunked into one stack. The rear <b>lattice</b> <b>mast</b> was replaced with a pole mast, which was moved further aft. Her two submerged torpedo tubes were also removed.|$|E
5|$|In March 1901 the {{battleship}} grounded again, {{this time in}} the harbor of Pensacola, Florida, but the ship was able to continue her trip. A more serious accident occurred during target practice in January 1903, when an explosion in an 8-inch turret killed nine crew members. They were the first fatalities aboard a United States battleship since the sinking of the Maine. Another accident happened in August of that year, when Massachusetts grounded on a rock in Frenchman Bay, Maine. The ship was seriously damaged and had to be repaired in drydock. In December 1904 yet another lethal accident took place aboard Massachusetts: three men were killed and several others badly burned when a broken gasket caused steam to fill the boiler room. On 8 January 1906 {{the battleship}} was decommissioned and her crew was transferred to her sister ship Indiana, which had completed a three-year modernization. Massachusetts now received the same upgrades, including twelve 3"/50 caliber gun single-purpose guns to replace the 6-inch and most of the lighter guns, new Babcock & Wilcox boilers, counterweights to balance her main turrets, a <b>lattice</b> <b>mast</b> and electric traversing mechanisms for her turrets.|$|E
50|$|Some navies {{considered}} <b>lattice</b> <b>masts</b> {{for their}} ships. Following {{their experience with}} the Andrei Pervozvannys, the Russians initially designed the four s with <b>lattice</b> <b>masts,</b> but constructed with pole ones. The German Imperial Navy designed its first battlecruiser, , with <b>lattice</b> <b>masts,</b> but she was instead completed with pole masts.|$|R
50|$|Only four battleships were {{completed}} with <b>lattice</b> <b>masts</b> for other navies. The two s of the Imperial Russian Navy had <b>lattice</b> <b>masts</b> {{until they were}} replaced with conventional masts {{in the beginning of}} the First World War. The two United States-built s of the Argentine Navy, ARA Rivadavia and ARA Moreno, had <b>lattice</b> <b>masts.</b> They were the only dreadnought-type battleships built for export by the USA. Two other battleships, the US pre-dreadnoughts Mississippi and Idaho were sold to Greece in 1914; they retained their <b>lattice</b> <b>masts</b> until their sinking by the Germans in 1941.|$|R
5|$|The ships {{initially}} {{carried a}} pole mast above the conning tower, though shortly after commissioning, both ships had <b>lattice</b> <b>masts</b> added aft, and in 1910, the forward masts were also replaced with <b>lattice</b> <b>masts.</b>|$|R
25|$|As {{part of the}} 1964 naval program, the Royal Canadian Navy {{planned to}} improve the attack {{capabilities}} of the Restigouche class. Unable to convert the vessels to helicopter-carrying versions like the St. Laurents due to budget constraints, instead the Restigouches were to receive variable depth sonar (VDS) to improve their sonar range, placed on the stern, and the RUR-5 anti-submarine rocket (ASROC). The destroyers also received a stepped <b>lattice</b> <b>mast.</b> Called the Improved Restigouche Escorts (IRE), Terra Nova {{was the first to}} undergo conversion, beginning in May 1965. The conversion took ten months to complete, followed by sea trials. The sea trials delayed the conversion of the next ship for four years. By 1969, the budget for naval programs had been cut and only four out of the seven (Terra Nova, Restigouche, Gatineau and Kootenay) would get upgraded to IRE standards and the remaining three (Chaudi√®re, Columbia, and St. Croix) were placed in reserve.|$|E
500|$|She left San Francisco on 15 April 1925 for {{war games}} held off Hawaii, after which {{she went on}} a cruise to Australia, {{returning}} to California on 26 September. The ship returned to the east coast in early 1931 for a major modernization that began on 30 March. This overhaul significantly changed the ship's profile by removing the original fore and aft <b>lattice</b> <b>mast.</b> The former was replaced with a tower. Modernization also included replacement of earlier 3-inch/50 cal anti-aircraft guns with eight 5-inch/25 caliber guns. Further training exercises followed in September 1933. On 24 October 1934, she passed through the Panama Canal {{on her way back}} to the Pacific Fleet, where she remained through mid-1941, apart from the normal winter cruises in the Caribbean. By this time, World War II had broken out in Europe, spawning the Battle of the Atlantic. In response, President Franklin D. Roosevelt initiated the Neutrality Patrols to protect American shipping. On 7 May 1941, Admiral Harold Rainsford Stark, the Chief of Naval Operations, transferred Mississippi, the battleships [...] and , the aircraft carrier , four light cruisers, and two destroyer squadrons to the Atlantic to reinforce the Neutrality Patrols. On 15 June, Mississippi arrived back in Norfolk, where she prepared to make her first patrol in the North Atlantic, which consisted of escorting a convoy from Newport, Rhode Island to Hvalfjordur, Iceland. She began another convoy escort mission on 28 September, also to Iceland. Mississippi remained there through November to protect American shipping in the area. During this period, she was assigned to the [...] "White Patrol", a special task group, along with the other two battleships and a pair of heavy cruisers.|$|E
2500|$|Early in the Second World War, Shikari, {{along with}} several other S-class destroyers based in the UK, was {{modified}} as a dedicated anti-submarine escort. After conversion, armament consisted of a single 4-inch gun forward, with a 12-pounder anti-aircraft gun amidships. Close-in anti-aircraft armament consisted of two quadruple Vickers [...]50 machine gun mounts. Both sets of torpedo-tubes were removed, allowing a heavy depth charge armament, with 112 depth charges carried, with sufficient depth charge throwers and racks to allow 14-charge patterns of charges to be used. Type 286 radar and Type 133 Sonar was fitted. Later in the war, the depth charge armament was reduced, with a 10-charge pattern substituted (as this {{was found to be}} as effective as the earlier 14-charge pattern). The [...]50 machine guns were eventually replaced by four single Oerlikon 20 mm cannon, and the 12 pounder anti-aircraft gun removed to allow Type 271 radar to be fitted on a <b>lattice</b> <b>mast</b> aft.|$|E
5000|$|All American battleships, {{up to the}} [...] battleships were {{equipped}} with <b>lattice</b> <b>masts,</b> although in the 1920s to 1930s, the older battleships had their <b>lattice</b> <b>masts</b> replaced with more modern tripod masts, concomitant {{with the addition of}} larger, much heavier fire-control director tops.

2500|$|From mid-1957 until December 1960, {{the carrier}} {{underwent}} a massive refit and reconstruction in the Netherlands. The work {{was carried out}} by Verolme Dock in Rotterdam, and cost US$27 million. The most visible change was the installation of an 8.5-degree angled flight deck. The size of the angle required that an accessway be built around the starboard side of the island superstructure; the weight acting as a counterbalance for the flight deck's portside overhang. Combined with the fitting of a more powerful steam catapult, stronger arresting gear, reinforced hangar elevators, and a mirror landing aid, these modifications permitted the operation of jet aircraft up to [...] in weight. The carrier's island superstructure was replaced, and a <b>lattice</b> <b>mast</b> was fitted to support the new fire control system and radar suite. The ship's boiler capacity was increased, and internal electricity was converted to AC through the installation of four turbo generators and one diesel generator.|$|E
2500|$|Vengeance was not {{reactivated}} for RN use, and on 14 December 1956, {{the carrier}} was {{sold by the}} Admiralty to Brazil for US$9 million. From mid-1957 until December 1960, the carrier underwent a massive refit and reconstruction at Verolme Dock in Rotterdam, which cost US$27 million. Modifications included the installation of an 8.5-degree angled flight deck, a more powerful steam catapult, stronger arresting gear, reinforced hangar elevators, and a mirror landing aid. This was to allow the operation of jet aircraft, which were larger, faster, and heavier than the propeller aircraft previously operated by the carrier. A new superstructure was fitted, including a large <b>lattice</b> <b>mast</b> to support a new radar suite and fire control system. Boiler capacity was increased, and the internal electrics were converted to AC power. The length of the modernisation refit meant that while the carrier was the first purchased by a Latin American nation, she was the second to enter service; another Colossus-class carrier entered service with the Argentine Navy as [...] in July 1959.|$|E
