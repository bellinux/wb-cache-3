5000|$|In {{a nation}} with heavy {{government}} censorship, e-democracy could not be utilized to its full extent. Governments often implement internet crackdowns during widespread political protests. In the middle-east in 2011, for example, the multiple cases of internet blackouts were dubbed the [...] "Arab Net Crackdown". The list of countries that {{have been reported to}} have initiated internet <b>lockdowns</b> is a long one. Libya, Egypt, Bahrain, Syria, Iran, and Yemen are all countries whose leaders implemented complete censorship of the internet in response to the plethora of pro-democracy demonstrations in their respective nations.

5000|$|Michael {{was one of}} {{the first}} prisons to no longer use the [...] "telephone-pole" [...] layout, which has central pickets with {{dead-end}} cell blocks extending from them.

Instead Michael uses a modular pod design, which allows for riot control and visual surveillance. Most pods have double-bunk, reinforced concrete cells with security features such as slit windows and bolted-down metal toilets. Some pods have dormitories. Michael was one of several new prisons to have the ability to have many prisoners in extended <b>lockdowns.</b> State officials said that Michael's features allowing for extended <b>lockdowns</b> of prisoners were modeled on the United States Penitentiary, Marion.|$|R
