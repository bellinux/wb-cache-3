25|$|Since May 2009, {{district}} courts try capital cases {{using the}} <b>lay</b> <b>judge</b> system, where three professional judges sit with six randomly chosen citizens. Five votes of nine-member court, {{including at least}} one professional judge, are required for issuing a conviction and any punishment, including death.|$|E
25|$|Only {{days before}} the trial began, {{one of the three}} {{appointed}} lay judges was discovered {{to be a member of}} a composers' association that among others works on protecting copyright. After discussing with judge Tomas Norström the problem the membership could pose to the trial, the composer recused himself from acting as a <b>lay</b> <b>judge</b> in the case and he was replaced with another.|$|E
25|$|This is a fragmentary {{case from}} Henry VI of England which {{indicates}} that there were sacks of flour left by the plaintiff to be stored and cared for by the defendant. The plaintiff had paid the defendant for this arrangement. The sacks of flour had been carried off by a third party. Counsel for the defence argued that action on the case did not lie, because detinue <b>lay.</b> <b>Judge</b> Prisot opined it was an action on the case. An action similar to trover was allowed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lay</b> <b>judges</b> {{also serve}} during {{criminal}} {{cases in the}} appellate courts. For smaller cases, the court is convened with three professional and four <b>lay</b> <b>judges.</b> If the crime carries a maximum sentence of six years imprisonment or more, the <b>lay</b> <b>judges</b> are replaced with a jury. The jury is chosen from the same list as the <b>lay</b> <b>judges,</b> meaning that <b>lay</b> <b>judges</b> in the appellate courts also serve as jurors. If the jury finds the defendant guilty, the jury spokesperson, and three other jurors selected at random, serve as <b>lay</b> <b>judges</b> during the sentencing. In the few cases where the professional judges overturn the jury's verdict, {{regardless of whether the}} original verdict was one of guilt or innocence, the case is re-tried with three professional <b>judges</b> and four <b>lay</b> <b>judges.</b>|$|R
25|$|Juries are {{not used}} in other {{criminal}} and civil cases. For most other cases {{in the first and}} second tier courts <b>lay</b> <b>judges</b> sit alongside professional <b>judges.</b> <b>Lay</b> <b>judges</b> participate in deciding both {{the facts of the case}} and sentencing. <b>Lay</b> <b>judges</b> are appointed by local authorities, or in practice by the political parties represented on the authorities. <b>Lay</b> <b>judges</b> are therefore usually selected from among nominees of ruling political parties.|$|R
5000|$|In most cases, {{the bench}} {{constitutes}} a quorum with one legally qualified <b>judge</b> and three <b>lay</b> <b>judges.</b> However, some simpler cases may be decided on without any <b>lay</b> <b>judges,</b> and in more complicated cases the <b>lay</b> <b>judges</b> may {{be replaced by}} specially appointed experts.|$|R
25|$|During the {{preparation}} for the appeal trial, bias allegations were also made on the court of appeal. In Swedish appeal proceedings for criminal cases where the sentence is greater than a fine, the court usually consists of three professional judges and two lay judges. Judge Ihrfelt, again appointed to the case, informed the parties in mid September 2009 {{that one of the}} appointed lay judges is working for the music streaming service Spotify, which is partly owned by record companies. The <b>lay</b> <b>judge</b> himself didn't feel biased because of his work, but prosecuting attorney Danowsky commented that anyone both judging the case and working for Spotify has a conflict of interest. Later on the same week, defense attorney Samuelsson submitted allegations to the appeal court of Ihrfelt and another professional judge being biased for their membership in the same interest groups judge Norström was investigated for. In the court's opinion, the judges' memberships did not constitute bias, whereas the lay judges's impartiality was questionable and he was dismissed. The court's decision was appealed, and in May 2010 the supreme court affirmed the appeal court's decision on the bias question.|$|E
2500|$|Although single murderers rarely face a death {{sentence}} in Japan, Takeshi Tsuchimoto, a criminal law scholar at Hakuoh University and former prosecutors of the Supreme Public Prosecutors' Office, expected that the recent trend toward harsher punishments, backed by the growing public support for capital punishment, would encourage the court to sentence Kanda and Hori (of the Rie Isogai case) to death. Major national newspapers published editorials {{in support of this}} unorthodox judgment on the premise that capital punishment is retained. The Asahi Shimbun and the Mainichi Shimbun, both major national liberal newspapers, wrote in editorials that the general public favored the judgment, and the Nikkei lent his support to it. The Sankei Shimbun, a major national paper on the right, aggressively evaluated the judgement with a phrase [...] "a natural and down-to-earth judgment of great significance". The Tokyo Shimbun expressed that capital punishment would be the inevitable sentence in consideration of the brutality of the murder and the pain that the victim's family felt. They also noted, however, that {{it would be difficult for}} citizen judges to determine whether death penalty would be appropriate in this kind of case under the <b>lay</b> <b>judge</b> system, which would be started in May 2009. Hiroshi Itakura, a criminal law scholar at Nihon University, said that this decision could be a new criterion for capital punishment under the <b>lay</b> <b>judge</b> system. However, one of the two men sentenced to death in the Isogai case had his sentence reduced to life imprisonment on appeal, and the Supreme Court refused to raise the punishment to death (but he was later sentenced to death in another murder case). The other defendant sentenced to death did not appeal and was hanged in 2015.|$|E
2500|$|In Italy, a Civil law jurisdiction, untrained {{judges are}} present {{only in the}} Corte d'Assise, where two career magistrates are {{supported}} by six so-called Lay Judges, who are raffled from the registrar of voters. Any Italian citizen, with no distinction of sex or religion, between 30 and 65 years of age, can be appointed as a lay judge; {{in order to be}} eligible as a <b>lay</b> <b>judge</b> for the Corte d'Assise, however, there is a minimum educational requirement, as the <b>lay</b> <b>judge</b> must have completed his/her education at the Scuola Media (junior high school) level, while said level is raised for the Corte d'Assise d'Appello (appeal level of the Corte d'Assise) to the Scuola Superiore (senior high school) degree. In the Corte d'Assise, decisions concerning both fact and law matters are taken by the stipendiary judges and [...] "Lay Judges" [...] together at a special meeting behind closed doors, named Camera di Consiglio ("Counsel Chamber"), and the Court is subsequently required to publish written explanations of its decisions within 90 days from the verdict. Errors of law or inconsistencies in the explanation of a decision can and usually will lead to the annulment of the decision. A Court d'Assise and a Court d' Assise d'Appello decides on a majority of votes, and therefore predominantly on the votes of the lay judges, who are a majority of six to two, but in fact [...] lay judges, who are not trained to write such explanation and must rely on one or the other stipendiary judge to do it, are effectively prevented from overruling both of them. [...] The Corte d'Assise has jurisdiction to try crimes carrying a maximum penalty of 24 years in prison or life imprisonment, and other serious crimes; felonies that fall under its jurisdiction include terrorism, murder, manslaughter, severe attempts against State personalities, as well as some matters of law requiring ethical and professional evaluations (ex. assisted suicide), while it generally has no jurisdiction over cases whose evaluation requires knowledge of Law which the [...] "Lay Judges" [...] generally don't have. Penalties imposed by the court can include life sentences.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are also}} more than 5,000 <b>lay</b> <b>judges</b> (...) linked to the {{district}} courts. <b>Lay</b> <b>judges</b> are laymen, not legally qualified representatives of the people, appointed by the municipal assembly, serving four years at a time.

40|$|<b>Lay</b> <b>judges</b> fulfill {{important}} {{functions for}} {{the justice system}} of a country. In the European Union member states, scholars have analysed the use of <b>lay</b> <b>judges</b> in criminal cases. However, {{little is known about}} lay participation in civil justice. The paper introduces commonly cited reasons to have <b>lay</b> <b>judges</b> as well as the principal forms of lay participation and then surveys the EU countries for its implementation in civil cases. Mixed tribunals, involving <b>lay</b> <b>judges</b> under the leadership of a professional judge, are relatively frequent. Several countries have special labour courts or commercial courts with lay members and others have single <b>lay</b> <b>judges,</b> or all-lay judge panels. Roughly a third of the 28 EU member states have no lay participation in civil justice but only three of those have no <b>lay</b> <b>judges</b> in any branch of the courts. Almost all the reasons for including lay decision makers are served somehow by the existing forms, including providing different experiences and perhaps expert knowledge. The article concludes, citing non-EU states and lay participation in criminal and administrative courts as further evidence, that <b>lay</b> <b>judges</b> {{in one form or another}} are an element of European legal systems...|$|R
50|$|In the {{district}} courts of Norway, <b>lay</b> <b>judges</b> sit alongside professional judges in mixed courts in most cases. In most cases, 2 <b>lay</b> <b>judges</b> sit alongside 1 professional judge. The court leader (Sorenskriver) may decree that a case have 3 <b>lay</b> <b>judges</b> sitting alongside 2 professional judges if its workload is particularly large {{or if there}} are other significant reasons. Decisions are made by simple majority.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lay</b> <b>judges</b> are {{appointed}} by local municipal councils, in practice by negotiations between political parties, from volunteers. Each municipality elects {{a number of}} <b>lay</b> <b>judges</b> depending on its size, or two at minimum. The minimum qualifications are Finnish citizenship, full citizenship rights (i.e. {{may not be a}} dependent or in bankruptcy), 25-64 years of age when elected, and general suitability for the position. <b>Lay</b> <b>judges</b> must resign at the age of 68 at the latest. Officials of the judicial, law enforcement or corrections authorities, such as prosecutors, attorneys, policemen, distrainers or customs officers may not be elected as <b>lay</b> <b>judges.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{participation}} of citizens in criminal procedure {{as a part}} of mixed trial councils is a concept existing in almost all European countries, although there are diverging opinions on the quality and real contribution that can be expected from <b>lay</b> <b>judges.</b> One has to agree with the findings that the {{participation of}} <b>lay</b> <b>judges</b> reflects the role of citizens’ involvement, as well as citizens’ access to justice as an important and essential component of a democratic society. The modest {{purpose of this paper is}} to present the dilemmas related to the criteria for selection of <b>lay</b> <b>judges</b> and their role in the criminal procedure as determined by the legislative provisions on one side, and lay judges’ perception of their position during the proceedings, on another side. It is also important to evaluate the domestic legislation in the light of the recommendations deriving from the European Charter for <b>lay</b> <b>judges.</b> Finally, the paper aims to present research conclusions and to give recommendations on the system of <b>lay</b> <b>judges,</b> having in mind the newly adopted amendments on the Law on courts. Equally, it aims to reconsider the participation of <b>lay</b> <b>judges</b> when the most complicated crimes are tried. Key words: <b>lay</b> <b>judges,</b> Republic of Macedonia...|$|R
25|$|In a sense, {{the concept}} of being judged by one's peers exists on both {{the first and second}} tier of the Norwegian court system: In Tingretten, one <b>judge</b> and two <b>lay</b> <b>judges</b> preside, and in Lagmannsretten three <b>judges</b> and four <b>lay</b> <b>judges</b> preside (if a jury is not used). The <b>lay</b> <b>judges</b> do not hold any legal qualification, and {{represent}} the peers of the person on trial, as members of the general public. As a guarantee against any abuse of power by the educated elite, the number of <b>lay</b> <b>judges</b> always exceeds the number of appointed judges. In the Supreme Court, only trained lawyers are seated.|$|R
5000|$|The only {{statutory}} criteria is {{that lay}} judges must be citizens {{that have not}} been convicted of, or be under investigation for, a serious crime. However, people [...] "ought not" [...] to be chosen if they are under 25 years old or over 70 years old, very high government officials, judges, prosecutors, lawyers, policemen, ministers, priests, don't live in the community at the time of election, or have been a <b>lay</b> <b>judge</b> in the past two terms. In addition, people may refuse to serve if they are over 65 years old, members of the federal or state legislatures, doctors, nurses, druggists if working alone, housewives if overburdened, or have served as a <b>lay</b> <b>judge</b> in the preceding term. Applications can be made to become a <b>lay</b> <b>judge</b> by interested citizens, but this does not occur often, and welfare institutions, sports clubs, financial and health insurance institutions, trade unions, industrial companies and other public authorities are primarily called upon to nominate candidates, and it appears that motivation includes social responsibility, image cultivation, advertising, and participation in fine allocation.|$|E

25|$|Judges {{may work}} alone in smaller cases, but in criminal, family and other {{significant}} cases, {{they work in}} a panel. In some civil law systems, this panel may include <b>lay</b> <b>judges.</b> Unlike professional <b>judges,</b> <b>lay</b> <b>judges</b> are not legally trained, but unlike jurors, <b>lay</b> <b>judges</b> are usually volunteers and may be politically appointed.

50|$|In {{criminal}} proceedings, <b>lay</b> <b>judges</b> sit alongside professional {{judges on}} cases carrying a maximum punishment {{of more than}} five years, {{as well as for}} political crimes. <b>Lay</b> <b>judges</b> are also used in labor, social, and commercial law disputes.|$|R

50|$|New {{legislation}} (2009) {{has limited}} {{the role of}} <b>lay</b> <b>judges.</b> They are employed only in serious criminal cases, which comprised 6% of cases in 2013. Instead, 29% of cases were handled in writing and 65% with a single professional judge. Almost all (>94%) cases concerning homicides, child molestations and vandalism are handled with <b>lay</b> <b>judges.</b> Formerly they always sat in for instance family law proceedings.

50|$|<b>Lay</b> <b>judges</b> have {{historically}} been predominantly middle-aged men from middle class socio-economic backgrounds.

A study published in 2009 put this number at 27% civil service employees versus 8% of the general population, and noted the relatively high numbers of housewives, the relatively low number of private sector employees, and relative old age of <b>lay</b> <b>judges.</b>|$|R
