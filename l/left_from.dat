5|$|The Brazilian Army entered Uruguay {{in three}} groups: the main force, {{consisting}} of the 1st and 2nd divisions <b>left</b> <b>from</b> Santana do Livramento—around 12,000 men under Caxias's personal command. The second force, {{under the command of}} Colonel David Canabarro departed from Quaraim, comprising the 4th division, protecting Caxias' right flank. The third force, the 3rd Division under Brigadier General José Fernandes, <b>left</b> <b>from</b> Jaguarão, protecting Caxias' left. Canabarro's 4th Division joined Caxias's troops shortly after arriving at the Uruguayan town of Frutuoso, the combined force then joining up with Fernandes just before reaching Montevideo.|$|E

5|$|A popular workmen's train (one penny per journey) ran between Ludgate Hill and Victoria via Herne Hill from 1865. Trains <b>left</b> <b>from</b> both termini at 04:55 and {{returned}} at 18:15.

Regular one-way fares to Ludgate Hill were eightpence, sixpence and fourpence for first, second and third class respectively (or return for one shilling, ninepence and sevenpence respectively), with journey times of 15 minutes on express trains and 26 minutes when calling at all stops.|$|E

5|$|After {{securing}} the island, the Allied forces developed Labuan into a significant base. The 24th Brigade <b>left</b> <b>from</b> {{the island to}} capture {{the eastern shore of}} Brunei Bay in late June, and the island's airfield was repaired and expanded to host Royal Australian Air Force units. While occupying Labuan, the Allies had to reconstruct the island's infrastructure and provide assistance to thousands of civilians who had been rendered homeless by the pre-invasion bombardment. Following the war, a major Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery was established on Labuan.|$|E
5|$|Anthony Neil Wedgwood Benn (3 April 1925 – 14 March 2014), {{originally}} {{known as}} Anthony Wedgwood Benn, but later as Tony Benn, was a British politician, writer, and diarist. He was a Member of Parliament (MP) for 47 {{years between the}} 1950 and 2001 general elections and a Cabinet minister in the Labour governments of Harold Wilson and James Callaghan in the 1960s and 1970s. Originally a moderate, he was identified as being on the party's hard <b>left</b> <b>from</b> the early 1980s, and was widely seen as a key proponent of democratic socialism within the party.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{only two}} players <b>left</b> <b>from</b> the {{championship}} team, McNamara and Syracuse struggled through the 2005–2006 regular season. Two highlights were the 38 points McNamara scored against Davidson College, the second-most points ever scored by a Syracuse player at the team's home arena, the Carrier Dome, and a 30-point performance against the visiting Louisville Cardinals. Syracuse finished with a losing record in the Big East; the team was in danger of missing the NCAA Tournament unless it secured the conference's automatic bid by winning the Big East's postseason tournament.|$|E

5|$|In 1913 a Suffrage Pilgrimage was organised, to {{end with}} a rally in Hyde Park, London on 26 July. It {{was an attempt to}} remind the public of the larger {{constitutional}} and non-militant wing of the movement, and routes were planned from 17 British towns and cities, including Wales. Twenty-eight members from Welsh NUWSS branches <b>left</b> <b>from</b> Bangor on 2 July travelling through Wales where they were met with both support and hostility.

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1147, the Pope {{authorized}} {{the expansion of the}} crusade into the Iberian peninsula, {{in the context of the}} Reconquista. He also authorized Alfonso VII of León and Castile to equate his campaigns against the Moors with the rest of the Second Crusade. In May 1147, the first contingents of crusaders <b>left</b> <b>from</b> Dartmouth in England for the Holy Land. Bad weather forced the ships to stop on the Portuguese coast, at the northern city of Porto on 16 June 1147. There they were convinced to meet with King Afonso I of Portugal.|$|E

5|$|According to Chapter I, Article 28, {{paragraph}} 2 of the Constitution, {{the national}} colors of Poland are white and red.

5|$|After {{the guns}} were fired, each rifle barrel {{had to be}} cleaned. Unlike small caliber guns which can be field-stripped, the guns aboard an Iowa-class {{battleship}} could not be disassembled, so the gunners mates assigned the job of cleaning the rifles required a full day or more {{to ensure that the}} barrels were correctly and adequately cleaned. To clean the rifles, a bore brush was lifted by two sailors and inserted into the gun barrel, where it was pulled through the rifle with the same equipment used to load the shells. Within the turret, crewmen checked to ensure that the breech fittings were properly cleaned and lubricated, while sailors outside the turret scraped off soot, and painted over flash burns <b>left</b> <b>from</b> the explosive expulsion of the 16-inch shells from the gun barrels.|$|E

5|$|Attached to the Fourth Division of the Second Squadron, {{and under}} command of Captain Hamilton Hutchins, she sailed on 16 December 1907 with the Great White Fleet. The fleet <b>left</b> <b>from</b> Hampton Roads, passed by Trinidad and Rio de Janeiro, and then {{passed through the}} Straits of Magellan. From there she passed by {{the west coast of}} South America, visiting Punta Arenas and Valparaíso, Chile, Callao, Peru, and Magdalena Bay, Mexico. The fleet reached San Diego on 14 April 1908 and moved on to San Francisco on 6 May. Two months later the {{warships}} sailed for Honolulu, Hawaii, and from there to Auckland, New Zealand, arriving 9 August. The fleet made Sydney, Australia, on 20 August, and after a week sailed for Melbourne.|$|E
5|$|Balaenids rely {{on their}} huge heads, {{as opposed to the}} rorquals' throat pleats, to feed effectively. This feeding {{behavior}} allows them to grow very big and bulky, without the necessity for a streamlined body. They have callosities, unlike other whales, {{with the exception of the}} bowhead whale. Rorquals have a higher proportion of muscle tissue and tend to be negatively buoyant, whereas right whales have a higher proportion of blubber and are positively buoyant. Gray whales are easily distinguished from other extant cetaceans by their sleet-gray color, dorsal ridges (knuckles on the back), and their gray-white scars <b>left</b> <b>from</b> parasites. As with the rorquals, their throat pleats increase the capacity of their throats, allowing them to filter larger volumes of water at once. Gray whales are bottom-feeders, meaning they sift through sand to get their food. They usually turn on their sides, scoop up sediment into their mouths and filter out benthic creatures like amphipods, which leave noticeable marks on their heads.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to {{the common}} understanding, the {{crossing}} of the Andes {{was not the first}} time that a military expedition crossed the mountain range. The difference from previous operations was the size of the army, and that it had to be ready for combat right after the crossing. The army was divided in six columns, each taking a different path. Colonel Francisco Zelada in La Rioja took the Come-Caballos pass towards Copiapó. Juan Manuel Cabot, in San Juan, moved to Coquimbo. Ramón Freire and José León Lemos led two columns in the south. The bulk of the armies <b>left</b> <b>from</b> Mendoza. San Martín, O'Higgins and Soler led a column across the Los Patos pass, and Juan Gregorio de Las Heras another one across the Uspallata Pass.|$|E
