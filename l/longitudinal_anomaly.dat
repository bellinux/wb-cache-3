40|$|An upper tropospheric and hemispheric scale data set, {{resulting}} from the EOLE constant density balloon experiment (conducted between August 1971 and July 1972) is used to study the spatial variation of various measured and derived fields. The quality and density of the data set is shown to be sufficient for such a study during the Southern Hemisphere spring, summer and autumn of the data period but inadequate during winter. The stationary modes of the Southern Hemisphere are shown to be relatively weak compared to their Northern Hemisphere counterparts and possess distinct seasonal phase shifts. The transient fields, on the other hand, show definite <b>longitudinal</b> <b>anomalies</b> in their seasonal mean properties with magnitudes up to thrice the zonal average. The transient fields show little seasonal variability in position. Furthermore, it appears that most of their magnitude results from the contribution of a relatively few but extremely intense disturbances which appear to possess a fairly regular variability in the 18 - 23 day range...|$|R
40|$|Longitudinal {{inhomogeneity}} {{of total}} ozone distribution is investigated {{in association with}} dynamical variations in the troposphere and the stratosphere. First, {{in order to see}} the spatial correlation between the total ozone and dynamical fields we do a statistical analysis using 10 years of the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) total ozone data and the Stratospheric Sounding Unit (SSU) geopotential height and temperature data. Correlation coefficients between <b>longitudinal</b> <b>anomalies</b> of total ozone and lower stratospheric temperature are positive and significantly large in mid-and high latitudes, though the seasonality is much stronger for the planetary scale (wavenumbers 1 and 2) variations than for the synoptic scale (wavenumbers 4 to 6). Next, by using the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) ozone profile data, we do case studies to investigate where the main contribution to the wave structure in the total ozone field comes from. It is found in mid-and high latutudes that the synoptic disturbances in total ozone are mainly due to the variation of ozone around the bottom of the stratosphere and that the planetary scale disturbances are due to that over the lower stratosphere. During the spring in the southern hemisphere, however, there are some exceptional situations in which chemical reactions in the polar vortex decrease ozone in a thin layer of the lower stratosphere...|$|R
40|$|The {{hydrological}} continuum in rivers can {{be altered}} {{by the presence of}} small dams that modify the water residence time (WRT) and prevailing habitat, turning lotic river sections into lentic ones and influencing downstream reaches. The structure and activity of the microbial community occurring in the benthic and planktonic compartments can be modified by these small dams. We studied the microbial community processing of organic C along a sequence of 4 lentic-lotic sections in a medium-size Mediterranean river during base flow (spring) and low flow (summer). We hypothesized that <b>longitudinal</b> <b>anomalies</b> in WRT would influence the relative contribution of benthic vs planktonic compartments and their relevance in C processing along the river network, particularly during low flows. The biomass of free-living and particle-associated bacterioplankton was higher in the lentic sections, which had longer WRT, resulting in higher organic C processing (enzymatic activities and respiration). Microbial aggregates occurred in the lentic sections especially during the low-flow period and resulted in hotspots of organic C processing. The lotic reaches received a significant contribution of C in the form of bacterio- and phytoplankton. The small dams subsidized the lotic sections downstream and increased their respiration activity. Our results reveal the influence of small dams on organic C processing along the river network. Accounting for their effect, together with that of large dams, may be essential for accurate estimations of organicmatter transformation in river networks.

The second mode (Fig.  13 f) shows a positive variation at latitudes higher than 40 ° during solstices (larger in June than in December); the opposite happened during the equinoxes (Fig.  13 e, f). There is a weak <b>longitudinal</b> <b>anomaly,</b> and {{it can only be}} explained by a slightly higher mean value of vTECIRI for the eastern coast during the 3 -year period (Table  3), as the contributions of mode 1 and 2 are nearly zero (Fig.  13 k).

40|$|Sr doping in the charge-ordered {{compound}} Nd 0. 3 La 0. 2 Ca 0. 5 −x Sr x MnO 3 {{has been}} systematically studied to examine {{its effect on}} ultrasonic velocity and elastic moduli as well as magnetic and electrical transport properties. DC electrical resistivity, ρ and AC susceptibility, χ′ measurements showed all samples exhibit metal-insulator (MI) behavior accompanied by ferromagnetic-paramagnetic (FM-PM) transition where the MI transition temperature, T MI and FM-PM transition temperature, T C increased with Sr content indicating the enhancement of double-exchange mechanism. Analysis of the resistivity change with respect to temperature, dlnρ/dT − 1 versus T indicates onset of charge-ordering (CO) state where its CO transition temperature, T CO decreased with Sr content indicating weakening of the CO state. On the other hand, both absolute longitudinal and shear velocities as well as elastic moduli measured at 80 K increased significantly with Sr doping indicating improvement in elastic properties, which is suggested {{to be due to}} the increase in formation of ferromagnetic domains. A <b>longitudinal</b> velocity <b>anomaly</b> characterized by a slope change around the vicinity of T CO was observed for all samples. The <b>longitudinal</b> elastic <b>anomaly</b> is attributed to the Jahn–Teller (JT) effect of Mn 3 + ions where analysis of the anomaly using the mean-field theory suggests involvement of the JT effect in the samples, which transforms from dynamic to static type with decreasing temperature.

For NCMCO series, resistivity and susceptibility measurements for the x= 0 sample showed an insulating behavior and an anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) transition at 230 K {{as well as}} a charge-ordering (CO) transition at 280 K. The substitution of Cr induces a ferromagnetic-paramagnetic (FM-PM) and metal-insulator (MI) transition as well as gradually suppressing the CO state due to weakening of the Jahn-Teller (JT) effect. Quenching to reduce the oxygen content of the x= 0. 05 sample caused the MI transition temperature to shift to lower temperatures most likely due to oxygen reduction. On the other hand, both longitudinal and shear velocities at 100 K increased significantly with Cr substitution indicating improvement in elastic properties. However, quenching of the x= 0. 05 sample slightly decreased both velocities and related elastic moduli. A step-like <b>longitudinal</b> velocity <b>anomaly</b> characterized by a slope change suggests the existence of CO state for x= 0, 0. 02 and 0. 05 samples. The step-like anomaly shifts to lower temperatures from 266 K (x= 0) to 222 K (x= 0. 05) with Cr substitution indicating the weakening of the CO state. Absence of the step-like anomaly for the quenched x=O. 05 sample suggests suppression of the CO state due to oxygen reduction. For the NLCSMO series, resistivity and susceptibility measurements showed all samples exhibit MI behavior accompanied by FM-PM transition where the MI transition temperature, TM 1 and FM-PM transition temperature, TC increased with Sr content indicating the enhancement of double-exchange mechanism. Analysis of the resistivity change with respect to temperature, dlnp/dT¹ versus T indicates onset of CO state where its CO transition temperature, TCO decreased with Sr content indicating weakening of the CO state. On the other hand, both absolute longitudinal and shear velocities as well as elastic moduli measured at 80 K increased significantly with Sr doping indicating improvement in elastic properties. A <b>longitudinal</b> velocity <b>anomaly</b> characterized by a slope change around the vicinity of TCO was observed for all samples. The <b>longitudinal</b> elastic <b>anomaly</b> is attributed to the JT effect of Mnᵌ⁺ ions. For the DEBCO series, resistivity and susceptibility measurements for the z= 0 sample exhibited an insulating behavior and an AFM transition, TN at 198 K as well as FM transition, TC at 260 K. Increasing of Er content suppressed the FM and AFM state {{may be due to the}} increase in size disorder arising from the size mismatch between A-site cations. On the other hand, both absolute velocities and related elastic moduli measured at 210 K decreased with Er content in conjunction with the declining in the FM domain indicating a weakening in elastic properties. A <b>longitudinal</b> velocity <b>anomaly</b> characterized by a drop in velocity upon cooling before hardening with further cooling was observed for all samples. This abnormal elastic anomaly can be attributed due to JT distortion of intermediate-spin Coᵌ⁺ ions. Analysis of the elastic anomaly using the mean-field theory in the NCMCO, NLCSMO and DEBCO series suggests involvement of the JT effect which transforms from dynamic to static type with decreasing temperature. The elastic anomaly shifted to lower temperature from 266 K (x= 0) to 222 K (x= 0. 05) for NCMCO, 222 K (y= 0) to 205 K (y= 0. 05) for NLCSMO and 129 K (z= 0) to 124 K(z= 0. 05) for DEBCO, indicating a weakening of the static JT effect...|$|R

40|$|The {{temperature}} dependencies of the ultrasonic velocities and attenuation coefficients are {{studied in}} the vicinity of the incommensurate phase transitions of BCCD and AHSe crystals. The largest contribution to the <b>longitudinal</b> ultrasonic <b>anomalies</b> is due to the coupling to the amplitude mode, whose relaxation time τ diverges as the transition temperature Ti is approached with the temperature dependence given by : τ=τoTi/T-Ti). The amplitudon relaxation time for AHSe crystal (τo= 5. 1. 10 - 12 s) was found to be considerably longer than for BCCD (τo= 1. 3. 10 - 13 s). From the measurements of shear ultrasonic wave velocity in incommensurate phase below Ti = 164 K the critical exponent that describes the order parameter temperature behaviour has been calculated for BCCD.

The vTECIRI variation increases to the east during the equinoxes (Fig.  14 e, f). There {{is no evidence of}} a winter anomaly. The <b>longitudinal</b> <b>anomaly</b> can be explained by a higher mean value of vTECIRI for the eastern coast during the 3 -year period (Table  3) and the contribution of mode 1.

On the contrary, vTECIRI does not show the remnant of the winter anomaly. As was mentioned previously, the change in the winter to summer ratio [O]/[N 2] is one of the drivers of the winter anomaly. The IRI 2012 uses the NRLMSIS- 00 model to generate this relation (Bilitza et al. 2014), and Burns et al. (2014) demonstrated that this model has some problems in reproducing the change in [O]/[N 2].

The second important feature is a longitudinal variation in vTECIRI (Fig.  11 f), with larger values at the east coast than the west coast during both equinoxes, higher in April.

Since this original observation, great advances have been made, leading to the molecular understanding of this altered <b>longitudinal</b> bone growth <b>anomaly.</b> A PSACH canine model suggested that abatement of cumulative vertical growth of growth plate chondrocytes seen in PSACH results from (1) altered extracellular matrix constraints for horizontal growth and (2) uncoupling of endochondral and perichondral growth that causes metaphyseal flaring. PSACH, an autosomal dominant disease, is linked to mutation of the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) gene. Amino acid substitutions, deletions, or additions is proposed to alter COMP structure that cause its retention in the rough endoplasmic reticulum of growth plate chondrocytes, leading to (1) compositional and structural change of the extracellular matrix, and (2) altered cellular proliferation and volume expansion.

The other important feature in the second mode is the strong latitudinal variation (Fig.  12 e, f) between longitudes −  50 ° and −  100 °; the values are positive for latitudes higher than −  50 ° and negative for lower latitudes during the equinoxes, and the opposite occurs during the solstices.

40|$|Equatorial {{total ozone}} {{variations}} with time scales of annual, quasi-biennial, and about 4 -year periodicities are described by {{paying attention to}} their longitudinal structure. Analyses are made for 11 years from 1979 to 1989, using the global total ozone data derived from the {{total ozone mapping spectrometer}} on board the Nimbus 7 satellite. Over the equator an annual cycle in total ozone is conspicuous. Zonal mean values are maximum around September and minimum around January. The longitudinal structure shows a zonal wavenumber 1 pattern with minimum values around 140 °E to the date line all year-round, indicating a close relationship to a region where the convective cloud activity is vigorous. By removing the climatological annual cycle from the original data, there appears the quasi-biennial oscillation in total ozone. This variation is characterized by zonally uniform phase changes and is strongly coupled with the quasi-biennial oscillation of the equatorial zonal wind in the lower stratosphere. Moreover, subtracting zonal mean values from the anomaly data mentioned above, we see an east-west seesaw variation with a nodal longitude around the date line. This east-west variation, having a characteristic time scale of about 4 years, is clearly related to the El Niño and the Southern Oscillation cycle. During El Niño events the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>anomaly</b> field in total ozone is positive in the western Pacific and negative in the eastern Pacific; the anomaly pattern is reversed during anti-El Niño events.

The monthly median hourly value of h ´ F, particularly in the post-sunset period (18 – 20 LT), are positively correlated with the monthly average S. The value of h ´ F can be deduced from an empirical formula: h ´ F = 0. 68 S + 218. 3, with the correlation coefficient (r) between h ´ F and S being 0. 78. The diurnal distribution of r during daytime (06 – 14 LT) was radically different for the African and Asian longitudinal sectors during 1980 - 1991, with the most pronounced difference in the post-noon period (12 – 14 LT) when the correlation coefficients r for the Asian and African sectors are 0. 8 and 0. 2, respectively. Thus, the daytime F-region in the African sector responded far less to changes in solar activity than the Asian F-region during this cycle. This <b>longitudinal</b> <b>anomaly</b> was however absent in the preceding cycle (1969 – 1979) when the African and Asian sectors were both characterised by low daytime and pronounced post-sunset correlation coefficient r.

40|$|International audienceSea surface {{temperature}} (SST) changes constitute a major indicator and driver of climate changes induced by greenhouse gas increases. The {{objective of the}} present study is to investigate the role played by the detailed structure of the SST change on the large-scale atmospheric circulation and the distribution of precipitation. For that purpose, simulations from the Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace Coupled Model, version 4 (IPSL-CM 4) are used where the carbon dioxide (CO 2) concentration is doubled. The response of IPSL-CM 4 is characterized by the same robust mechanisms affecting the other coupled models in global warming simulations, that is, an increase of the hydrological cycle accompanied by a global weakening of the large-scale circulation. First, purely atmospheric simulations are performed to mimic the results of the coupled model. Then, specific simulations are set up to further study the underlying atmospheric mechanisms. These simulations use different prescribed SST anomalies, which correspond to a linear decomposition of the IPSL-CM 4 SST changes in global, longitudinal, and latitudinal components. The simulation using a globally uniform increase of the SST is able to reproduce the modifications in the intensity of the hydrological cycle or in the mean upward mass flux, which also characterize the double CO 2 simulation with the coupled model. But it is necessary (and largely sufficient) to also take into account the zonal-mean meridional structure of the SST changes to represent correctly the changes in the Hadley circulation strength or the zonal-mean precipitation changes simulated by the coupled model, even if these meridional changes by themselves do not change the mean thermodynamical state of the tropical atmosphere. The <b>longitudinal</b> SST <b>anomalies</b> of IPSL-CM 4 also {{have an impact on the}} precipitation and large-scale tropical circulation and tend to introduce different changes over the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The longitudinal SST changes are demonstrated to have a smaller but opposite effect from that of the meridional anomalies on the Hadley cell circulations. Results indicate that the uncertainties in the simulated meridional patterns of the SST warming may have major consequences on the assessment of the changes of the Hadley circulation and zonal-mean precipitation in future climate projections...|$|R

For T 10. 9 Bi 0. 1 Sr 1. 8 Yb 0. 2 Ca 1. xCdxCu 1. 99 Fe 0. 01 O 7 -o (x - 0 - 0. 4) ceramics, substitution of Cd caused Tc zero increasing from 40. 0 K (x = 0) to 76. 4 K (x = 0. 3) before decreasing to 74. 8 K (x = 0. 4) with increasing Cd 2 + contents. FTIR analysis in conjunction with XRD results indicates improved J that is evidenced in the form of decreased c-axis length and softening of the apical oxygen mode with Cd concentration. Excess conductivity analyses showed cross-over between 2 D to 3 D SFB transition for all the samples (x = 0. 1 - 0. 4) with the highest T 2 D- 3 D was observed at x = 0. 3. Similar calculation revealed longest value of §c(0) and the highest J at x = 0. 3. Ultrasonic velocity measurements was performed on longitudinal and shear velocities at 9 MHz in temperature ranges of 80 - 280 K and 80 - 220 K, respectively, for T 10. 9 Bi 0. 1 Sr 1. 8 Yb 0. 2 Ca 1. xCdxCu 1. 99 Fe 0. 01 O 7 -o (x - 0 - 0. 4) and T 10. 9 Bi 0. 1 Sr 2 -xCexCa 0. 9 Y 0. 1 Cu 1. 99 Fe 0. 01 O 7 -o (x = 0 - 0. 20) ceramics to study the influence of Cd and Ce substitutions on elastic properties and elastic anomaly. For the former series, ultrasonic velocity measurements at 80 K showed a non-linear increase in both absolute longitudinal and shear velocities as well as elastic moduli with Cd substitution with the largest increase observed for the x = 0. 3 sample. Temperature dependant longitudinal modulus showed elastic anomaly characterized by a step-like slope change at around 230 K for x = 0 & x = 0. 3 and at around 250 K for x = 0. 4 with the x = 0. 3 sample showing the sharpest slope change. For T 1. 09 Bi 0. 1 Sr 2 -xCexCa 0. 9 Y 0. 1 Cu 1. 9 9 Fe 0. 01 O 7. g series, Ce was observed to influence elastic moduli at 80 K which showed the largest value obtained at x = 0. 10. A <b>longitudinal</b> velocity <b>anomaly</b> was observed at around 260 K for the unsubstituted sample (x = 0). Ce substitution caused the temperature of the elastic anomaly to shift to 250 K (x = 0. 1) and 262 K (x = 0. 2). The existence of the step-like elastic anomaly was suggested to be due to oxygen ordering taking place in Tl- 0 planes. The analysis of the elastic behavior {{in the vicinity of the}} elastic anomalies using Landau free-energy model for both T 10. 9 Bi 0. 1 Sr 1. 8 Yb 0. 2 Ca 1. xCdxCu 1. 99 Fe 0. 01 O 7 -o (x - 0 - 0. 4) and T 10. 9 Bi 0. 1 Sr 2 -xCexCa 0. 9 Y 0. 1 Cu 1. 99 Fe 0. 01 O 7 -o (x = 0 - 0. 20) series suggests that the anomaly is due to a phase transition which involves oxygen ordering...|$|R
