50|$|Atmospheric radio {{occultation}} {{relies on the}} detection {{of a change in}} a radio signal as it passes through a planet's atmosphere, i.e. as it is occulted by the atmosphere. When electromagnetic radiation (light) passes through the atmosphere, it is refracted (or bent). The magnitude of the refraction depends on the gradient of refractivity normal to the path, which in turn depends on the density gradient. The effect is most pronounced when the radiation traverses a long atmospheric <b>limb</b> <b>path.</b> At radio frequencies the amount of bending cannot be measured directly; instead the bending can be calculated using the Doppler shift of the signal given the geometry of the emitter and receiver. The amount of bending can be related to the refractive index by using an Abel transform on the formula relating bending angle to refractivity. In the case of the neutral atmosphere (below the ionosphere) information on the atmosphere's temperature, pressure and water vapour content can be derived giving {{radio occultation}} data applications in meteorology.|$|E

The SAGE II measurements are compared with correlative aerosol measurements taken during January 1985, August 1985, and July 1986 with impactors, laser spectrometers, and filter samplers on a U- 2 aircraft, an upward pointing lidar on a P- 3 aircraft, and balloon-borne optical particle counters.

40|$|The {{infrared}} limb {{spectra of}} the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) {{on board the}} Envisat satellite include detailed information on tropospheric clouds and polar stratospheric clouds (PSC). However, no consolidated cloud product is available for the scientific community. Here we describe a fast prototype processor for cloud parameter retrieval from MIPAS (MIPclouds). Retrieval of parameters such as cloud top height, temperature, and extinction are implemented, {{as well as of}} microphysical parameters, e. g. effective radius and the integrated quantities over the <b>limb</b> <b>path</b> (surface area density and volume density). MIPclouds classifies clouds as either liquid or ice cloud in the upper troposphere and polar stratospheric clouds types in the stratosphere based on statistical combinations of colour ratios and brightness temperature differences. Comparison of limb measurements of clouds with model results or cloud parameters from nadir looking instruments is often difficult due to different observation geometries. We therefore introduce a new concept, the limb-integrated surface area density path (ADP). By means of validation and radiative transfer calculations of realistic 2 -D cloud fields as input for a blind test retrieval (BTR), we demonstrate that ADP is an extremely valuable parameter for future comparison with 3 -D model data of ice water content, when applying limb integration (ray tracing) through the model fields. In addition, ADP is used for a more objective definition of a cloud detection threshold. Based on BTR, a detection threshold for ADP of 10 7 μm 2 cm− 2 and an ice water content of 10 &minus; 5 g m− 3 is estimated, depending on the horizontal and vertical extent of the cloud. Intensive validation of the cloud detection methods shows that the limb-sounding MIPAS instrument has a sensitivity in detecting stratospheric and tropospheric clouds similar to that of space- and ground-based lidars, with a tendency for higher cloud top heights and consequently higher sensitivity for some of the MIPAS detection methods. For the high cloud amount (HCA, pressure levels below 440 hPa) on global scales the sensitivity of MIPAS is significantly greater than that of passive nadir viewers. This means that the high cloud fraction will be underestimated in the ISCCP dataset compared to the amount of high clouds deduced by MIPAS. Good correspondence in seasonal variability and geographical distribution of cloud occurrence and zonal means of cloud top height is found in a detailed comparison with a climatology for subvisible cirrus clouds from the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment II (SAGE II) limb sounder. Overall, validation with various sensors shows the need to consider differences in sensitivity, and especially the viewing geometries and field-of-view size, to make the datasets comparable (e. g. applying integration along the <b>limb</b> <b>path</b> through nadir cloud fields). The simulation of the <b>limb</b> <b>path</b> integration will be an important issue for comparisons with cloud-resolving global circulation or chemical transport models...|$|E
40|$|With the {{increasing}} number of remote sensing satellites using the GPS radio occultation technique for atmospheric sounding, the estimation of higher order ionospheric effects and their mitigation have become relevant and important. Due to long ionospheric <b>limb</b> <b>paths,</b> GPS signals are strongly affected by ionospheric refraction during radio occultation. Standard dual-frequency GPS measurements may be used to estimate the first order term of the refractive index. However, non linear terms such as the second and third order ionospheric terms and ray path bending effects are not considered in occultation measurements so far. Analysing selected CHAMP-GPS occultation events different higher order ionospheric terms are estimated and their effects on dual-frequency range estimation and total electron content (TEC) estimation are discussed. We have found that the separation between the GPS L 1 and L 2 ray paths exceeds the kilometer level during occultation for a vertical TEC level of more than 160 TEC units. Corresponding errors in the GPS dual-frequency range estimation and TEC estimation are found to exceed the meter and 10 TEC units level, respectively...|$|R

40|$|SOFIE (the Solar Occultation For Ice Experiment) {{has been}} {{operating}} since May 2007 onboard AIM (the Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere satellite). SOFIE measurements target the polar mesosphere, where noctilucent clouds form each summer. Increases in the frequency and brightness of these ultra-high clouds {{have been attributed to}} global climate change, but conclusive evidence is lacking, and relatively {{little is known about the}} processes governing their formation. SOFIE is now providing key measurements to advance our understanding of these clouds and their environment. The instrument acquires <b>limb</b> <b>path</b> transmittances in 16 spectral bandpasses from the UV to the IR. Vertical profiles of cloud properties, temperature, water vapor, ozone, methane and nitric oxide are inverted from these transmittance measurements.

40|$|Extinction {{coefficients}} for stratospheric aerosols at 8 HALOE (HALogen Occultation Experiment) wavelengths {{are determined by}} comparing transmittances data for two adjacent solar occultation measurements, where one <b>limb</b> <b>path</b> is loaded with aerosols but the other path is free of aerosols. These extinction coefficients are used to infer the aerosol properties such as composition and size distribution parameters. Mie theory {{has been used to}} calculate the extinction coefficients, and a nonlinear least square method is applied to determine the aerosol properties. Sixteen cases are selected for the retrieval in southern hemisphere at latitudes from 21 to 48 deg S for the period of 29 Mar - 31 May 1992.

40|$|Here {{we present}} {{observations}} of the Cryogenic Infrared Spectrometers and Telescopes for the Atmosphere (CRISTA) of cirrus cloud and water vapour in August 1997 in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) region. The observations indicate a considerable flux of moisture from the upper tropical troposphere into the extra-tropical lowermost stratosphere (LMS), resulting in the occurrence of high altitude optically thin cirrus clouds in the LMS. The locations of the LMS cloud events observed by CRISTA {{are consistent with the}} tropopause height determined from coinciding radiosonde data. For a hemispheric analysis in tropopause relative coordinates an improved tropopause determination has been applied to the ECMWF temperature profiles. We found that a significant fraction of the cloud occurrences in the tropopause region are located in the LMS, even if a conservative overestimate of the cloud top height (CTH) determination by CRISTA of 500 m is assumed. The results show rather high occurrence frequencies (∼ 5 %) up to high northern latitudes (70 ° N) and altitudes well above the tropopause (> 500 m at ∼ 350 K and above) in large areas at mid and high latitudes. Comparisons with model runs of the Chemical Lagragian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS) over the CRISTA period show a reasonable consistency for the retrieved cloud pattern. For this purpose a limb ray tracing approach was applied through the 3 -D model fields to obtain integrated measurement information through the atmosphere along the <b>limb</b> <b>path</b> of the instrument. The simplified cirrus scheme implemented in CLaMS seems to cause a systematic underestimation in the CTH occurrence frequencies in the LMS with respect to the observations. The observations together with the model results demonstrate the importance of isentropic, quasi-horizontal transport of water vapour from the sub-tropics and the potential for the occurrence of cirrus clouds in the lowermost stratosphere and tropopause region...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} higher order ionospheric effects on GPS radio occultation measurements onboard Low Earth Orbiting (LEO) satellites. Due to long ionospheric <b>limb</b> <b>paths,</b> GPS measurements are strongly affected by ionospheric refraction during radio occultation. Since the ionospheric refractive index depends {{mainly on the}} electron density, the inversion of the measured total electron content (TEC) from the radio occultation or limb sounding data provides the vertical electron density profile from the LEO height {{down to the bottom}} side of the ionosphere. In general, the TEC along a GPS-LEO path is calculated using the GPS dual frequency measurements. However, in the common practice only the first order ionospheric term in the expansion of the refractive index is taken into account for the TEC estimation, i. e., higher order ionospheric terms such as the second and third order terms, and ray path bending effects are ignored. The resulting error in TEC estimation leads thus to an erroneous reconstruction of the vertical profile of electron density. Additionally, due to the bending, the tangential height of the curved path deviates from that defined by the straight line of sight propagation. This leads to an erroneous determination of the reference height in the retrieval technique. A schematic view of GPS frequencies geometric paths during radio occultation is shown in Fig. 1 (not scaled). When the GPS signal approaches the Earth, the closest point of approach to the Earth’s surface is defined as the tangential point and the altitude corresponding to this point is defined as the tangential height. The perpendicular distances of the signal path from the straight line of sight (LoS) or vacuum path are defined as the ray path deviations. Using a two dimensional ray tracing program, higher order ionospheric terms such as the second and third order ionospheric phase delays, and ray path bending related terms such as the ray path deviation, excess path length of the signal and TEC difference between the GPS L 1 and L 2 signal paths have been computed. In addition, higher order propagation effects on the dual-frequency range estimation and TEC estimation during occultation will be presented...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The gently {{curved paths}} evident in {{point-to-point}} arm movements {{have been attributed}} to both an imperfect execution of a planned straight-hand path or as an emergent property of a control strategy in which an intrinsic cost, dependent on arm dynamics, is minimised. We used a virtual visual feedback system to test whether path curvature was mainly determined by the visually perceived or actual location of the moving <b>limb.</b> Hand <b>paths</b> were measured for movements between three pairs of targets under both veridical and uniformly translated visual feedback. This allowed us to decouple the actual and perceived hand location during movement. Under different conditions of visual feedback the curvature of the hand paths did not correlate with either the visually perceived location of the limb or the actual location but rather with the relative displacement between the actual and visually perceived limb locations. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that in planning a move-ment the internal estimate of intrinsic coordinates, such as joint angles, is at least partially derived from visual information...|$|R

40|$|International audienceBias errors for {{retrieved}} temperature profiles T(p) {{from the}} Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) are evaluated by pairing with nearby soundings from ground-based Rayleigh lidar and from inflatable falling spheres. Findings for the mesosphere {{must be based}} on large sets of pairings because an individual HALOE T(p) measurement is somewhat noisy and may not view the same atmospheric structure. Simulated estimates of total bias errors for the HALOE profiles are of the order of 2 % (or 5 K). The average biases with the lidar profiles at 44 °N, 6 °E are within 3 K from 33 to 66 km and 4 K to 74 km, at least when zonal easterlies (and reduced wave activity) prevail. Tidal effects can account for most of that difference. Comparisons with shipboard lidar soundings that begin near 100 km indicate no significant bias even in the 77 to 85 km range. Similar comparisons with falling sphere profiles at Cape Canaveral and Wallops Island indicate no significant bias from 40 to 66 km and 71 to 85 km. HALOE profiles are warmer than sphere values from 67 to 70 km, but this is also the altitude region where the sphere profile has greater uncertainties. For those months when the lidar soundings indicate inversion layers the sets of profiles paired with lidar indicate that the HALOE T(p) is somewhat colder in the upper mesosphere, in part owing to the effects of <b>limb</b> <b>path</b> averaging of horizontal structure by HALOE and its inability to completely resolve the inversion layer maximum. On the basis of the combined sets of findings it is concluded that most of the error in a single HALOE T(p) is random, except where there is a sharp inversion. Daily zonal averages of the HALOE profiles are accurate and useful for defining the seasonal and longer-term variations of T(p) in the mesosphere. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{discuss the}} intercomparison between the Karlsruhe Optimized and Precise Radiative {{transfer}} Algorithm (KOPRA) and the Reference Forward Model (RFM) codes, {{which have been}} designed for analysis of MIPAS-ENVISAT data. The purpose of this intercomparison is to validate the KOPRA algorithm, i. e. to identify and to remove possible errors in the KOPRA (or RFM) code and to quantify the reason of remaining differences. Similar comparisons between the MIPAS Optimised Forward Model (OFM) and the RFM {{as well as between}} KOPRA and the RFM have already been performed(Ref. (1, 2)). To be able to relate on these results, this validation is similarly organised: we perform subsequently more complex tests of ray-tracing, integrated column amounts, homogeneous and <b>limb</b> <b>path</b> calculations of unapodised, apodised and held-of-view (FOV) convolved spectra, using the same isolated CO 2 line as well as the same six MIPAS microwindows. Additionally we compare modelling of CO 2 line-mixing non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE), trace gas continua and cross-section spectra. The KOPRA-RFM residuals are below a quarter of the noise-equivalent spectral radiance (NESR) for the isolated CO 2 line {{as well as for the}} MIPAS microwindows, i. e. KOPRA fulfils the acceptance criteria requested for the OFM. In most cases the deviations are even clearly below 1 nW/(cm(2) sr cm(- 1)), that is more than one order of magnitude below the acceptance threshold. This is valid for unconvolved as well as for ALS (apodised line shape) and FOV convolved spectra. There is also good agreement in modelling of the H 2 O-, O- 2 - and N- 2 -continua and of CO 2 line-mixing. Larger deviations of up to several nW/(cm(2) sr cm(- 1)) occured for NLTE calculations on the basis of "default" atmospheric profiles with vertical resolution of I or 2. 5 km. These differences were found to be due to different layer-averaging of the vibrational temperatures and could be considerably reduced by calculations with a higher vertical resolution of 250 m. Cross-section spectra agree well, if the tabulated data are given independent of pressure, e. g. for ClONO 2 and N 2 O 5, and cover the atmospheric temperatures. Due to different temperature extrapolation the deviations increase up to 10 nW/(cm(2) sr cm(- 1)) for atmospheric temperatures outside the measuring range. The RFM is not yet adjusted to cross-sections tabulated for non-equidistant temperatures and for atmospheric pressures, like CFC-data in the HITRAN 96 database. If these data are used, larger differences arise, e. g, up to 30 nW/(cm(2) sr cm(- 1)) between CFC- 12 spectra. Avoidance of interpolation by performing homogeneous path calculations for p,T of one of the tabulated cross-section datasets reduces the deviations to below 0. 5 nW/(cm(2) sr cm(- 1)) ...|$|E

Quantifying metabolic demand is an essential step for revealing the many mechanisms of physical performance decrement, but accurate predictive models do not exist.

5|$|Although stiff {{wheels are}} more energy {{efficient}} than {{other means of}} locomotion when traveling over hard, level terrain (such as paved roads), wheels are not especially efficient on soft terrain such as soil, because they are vulnerable to rolling resistance. In rolling resistance, a vehicle loses energy to the deformation of its wheels and the surface on which they are rolling. Smaller wheels are especially susceptible to this effect. Softer surfaces deform more and recover less than firm surfaces, resulting in greater resistance. Rolling resistance on medium to hard soil can be five to eight times greater than on concrete, and on sand it can be ten to fifteen times greater. While wheels must deform the surface along their entire <b>path,</b> <b>limbs</b> induce only a small, localized deformation around the region of foot contact.|$|R

However, accurate measurement has previously been out of reach of the clinician due to the costly equipment and technical expertise required. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the test-retest reliability of WBA data obtained using an inexpensive and simple to use dual force plate system incorporating unmodified Nintendo Wii Balance Boards (NWBB) and customized software. A secondary outcome measure, individual <b>limb</b> COP <b>path</b> velocity, which represents the postural sway under each limb was also examined. Twenty-three participants performed squats both with and without visual WBA feedback on two separate occasions. Weight-bearing asymmetry as a percentage of body mass and individual limb center of pressure (COP) path velocity were recorded during these trials, with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC 2, 1) analysis performed to assess test-retest reliability. This system provided reliable values for both outcome measures when performed with and without real-time visual feedback of WBA (ICC 2, 1 range= 0. 75 - 0. 91). In conclusion, recording WBA and COP path velocity data using NWBB is reliable. Given that tens of millions of NWBB have been sold worldwide, and that reprogramming them for clinical purposes is within the reach of most software developers, similar systems may soon become commonplace in the clinical setting. © 2011 Elsevier B.
