25|$|Fuel {{efficiency}} for the RX 450h, {{according to}} EPA testing, is increased by twenty {{percent over the}} previous RX 400h. Initial manufacturer data pointed to an increase of at least eight percent over the prior model. In the U.S., the RX 450h is certified with a 2009 EPA fuel economy rating of 32 mpg city, 28 highway for the FWD model, and 30 mpg city, 28 highway for the AWD model. This 30 mpg combined rating compares with the 20 mpg combined rating of the non-hybrid RX model. The powertrain is linked to an instrument panel Eco <b>light</b> <b>indicator,</b> which enables drivers to monitor their fuel efficiency as it correlates with accelerator modulation.|$|E

50|$|That spring, Yazoo {{pulled a}} large Navy cargo vessel {{off the beach}} at Davisville, Rhode Island between 22 and 25 April 1948 and then made a cruise to Terceira, in the Azores, during September and October of that year, to lay a fleet mooring there. She {{spent much of the}} year {{following}} her return to the eastern seaboard serving as a target ship for submarines and towing targets for surface battle practices. She conducted similar operations in 1950., with time out in June of that year for laying a <b>light</b> <b>indicator</b> net during Operation Martex. After an overhaul at the Charleston Naval Shipyard (South Carolina) from July to September 1950, Yazoo trained out of Norfolk, Virginia, before she resumed extensive work with nets off Newport. During March 1951, Yazoo took part in U.S. Atlantic Fleet mining exercises out of Key West, Florida, and then spent the remainder of the year performing mine tests and exercises out of Charleston. Between February and April 1952, Yazoo laid nets off Cape Henry during exercises in the Chesapeake Bay. In January 1953, semi-permanent mine tracks were installed on the net-layer, enabling the ship to lay 24 moored-type naval mines. On 9 January, the ship's home port was changed to, to enable her to commence a schedule of tests and exercises {{under the auspices of the}} Operational Development Force.|$|E

40|$|Based on {{statistical}} data in Indonesia train collisions occur each year. The solution {{to prevent these}} accidents is to create early warning detection devices for locomotive driver before the collision or accident occurred so that locomotive drivers can avoid them (preventive).

40|$|This {{research}} {{is centered on}} the design of a diesel fired heat-treatment furnace using locally sourced materials. The design philosophy is to eliminate the use of heating elements requiring electric power which is poorly supplied in the country. Design drawings were produced and mild steel was used for the fabrication of the furnace casing, while the other components needed for the design were selected based on functionality, durability, cost and local availability. The furnace was assembled by lining the inner wall of the casing with refractory blocks made from heated mixture of kaolin, clay, sawdust and water after which the inner pot and electro technical devices (temperature controller, <b>light</b> <b>indicator</b> etc) were positioned. Testing was subsequently performed to evaluate the performance of the furnace. It was observed that the furnace has a fast heating rate (61. 240 C/min to attain a pre-set temperature of 9000 C); and a fuel consumption rate less than 1. 41 litres/hr. It was also observed that the furnace has good heat retaining capacity; can be easily maintained and safe for use...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} manage model risk, {{financial}} institutions {{need to set}} up validation processes so as to monitor {{the quality of the}} models on an ongoing basis. Validation can be considered from both a quantitative and qualitative point of view. Backtesting and benchmarking are key quantitative validation tools, and the focus of this paper. In backtesting, the predicted risk measurements (PD, LGD, EAD) will be contrasted with observed measurements using a workbench of available test statistics to evaluate the calibration, discrimination and stability of the model. A timely detection of reduced performance is crucial since it directly impacts profitability and risk management strategies. The aim of benchmarking is to compare internal risk measurements with external risk measurements so as to better gauge the quality of the internal rating system. This paper will focus on the quantitative PD validation process within a Basel II context. We will set forth a traffic <b>light</b> <b>indicator</b> approach that employs all relevant statistical tests to quantitatively validate the used PD model, and document this approach with a real-life case study. The set forth methodology and tests are the summary of the authors' statistical expertise and experience of world-wide observed business practices...|$|E
