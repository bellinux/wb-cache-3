5|$|From a {{strategic}} point of view, by defending Thermopylae, the Greeks {{were making the}} best possible use of their forces. As <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> prevent a further Persian advance into Greece, they {{had no need to}} seek a decisive battle and could, thus, remain on the defensive. Moreover, by defending two constricted passages (Thermopylae and Artemisium), the Greeks' inferior numbers became less of a factor. Conversely, for the Persians the problem of supplying such a large army meant they could not remain in the same place for very long. The Persians, therefore, had to retreat or advance, and advancing required forcing the pass of Thermopylae.|$|E

5|$|Sometimes {{arms were}} {{purchased}} {{on the black}} market from German soldiers or their allies, or stolen from German supply depots or transports. Purchases were made by individual units and sometimes by individual soldiers. As Germany's prospects for victory diminished and the morale in German units dropped, the number of soldiers willing to sell their weapons correspondingly increased and thus made this source more important. All such purchases were highly risky, as the Gestapo was well aware of this black market in arms and tried to check it by setting up sting operations. For the most part this trade was limited to personal weapons, but occasionally light and heavy machine guns could also be purchased. It was much easier to trade with Italian and Hungarian units stationed in Poland, which more willingly sold their arms to the Polish underground as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> conceal this trade from the Germans.|$|E

25|$|The {{inadequate}} {{control of}} tuberculosis {{can be linked}} to a malfunctioning health system. From 1978 to 2002, the government's share of total health expenditure fell from 32% to 16%. This reduction forced many Chinese health-care facilities and providers to focus on the generation of revenue, with little concern for public health. Hospitals and clinics essentially functioned (and continue to function) as for-profit entities. In 2000, nearly 90% of patients with tuberculosis initiated their diagnostic and treatment process in hospitals and non-public health-care facilities, where they were given tests and drugs as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> pay. Many patients who improved or ran out of money discontinued treatment. Thus, only 20% of patients with tuberculosis treated outside the public health system took their tuberculosis medications regularly in 2000. Such irregular treatment breeds drug-resistant tuberculosis.|$|E
60|$|Ermines {{were found}} in {{considerable}} numbers, {{and in the first}} week four fine sables were killed, as well as two martens and a bear; the latter was specially prized.

The bodies of the ermines were but a mouthful for one of the dogs, while the sables and martens gave them a mouthful all round. The bear, however, contained a large quantity of excellent food, and setting aside the hams for their own consumption they hung {{up the rest of the}} meat on a tree to serve out gradually among the dogs. They soon found, however, that they need be under no anxiety as to food, as foxes abounded, principally red, though two of the valuable black foxes fell to Godfrey's gun. They found many paths in the woods completely trodden down by animals. Here they used the Ostjak method of catching them: putting up a screen of branches across the track. Looking at these objects with suspicion, the animals invariably refused to try either to jump over or crawl through them, but went round at one end or the other. Here accordingly traps were fixed and many animals were taken.|$|R

25|$|It {{was only}} in 1855 that the idea was raised of {{founding}} a school specifically {{for the education of}} sons of ministers like the Methodist Church in England had at Kingswood School in Bath. Funds were raised with significant amounts coming from the US and England. The original site for the school was to be in Portadown but the location was changed, first of all to Dublin. Land was acquired in Dublin but proceedings stalled. Several prominent Belfast Methodists began a campaign to have the school built in Belfast.

A last attempt was made 1863 for the building to take place in Portadown but this failed. The necessary money had been raised by 1864 to satisfy the Conference’s stipulations but it was held that £10,000 would not be sufficient. Further fundraising missions were made to the United States and England in 1866. These were led by Robinson Scott, the Rev Robert Wallace and William McArthur. Wallace would die on this mission in Cincinnati from Cholera. However an additional £10,000 was raised. Several subsequent missions took place to fund building work.|$|E

2500|$|Firearms: Modern cowboys {{often have}} access to a rifle, used to protect the {{livestock}} from predation by wild animals, more often carried inside a pickup truck than on horseback, though rifle scabbards are manufactured, and allow a rifle to be carried on a saddle.

The modern ranch hand often uses a [...]22 caliber [...] "varmit" [...] rifle for modern ranch hazards, such as rattlesnakes, coyotes, and rabid skunks. In areas near wilderness, a ranch cowboy may carry a higher-caliber rifle to fend off larger predators such as mountain lions. In contrast, the cowboy of the 1880s usually carried a heavy caliber revolver such as the single action [...]44-40 or [...]45 Colt Peacemaker (the civilian version of the 1872 Single Action Army). The working cowboy of the 1880s rarely carried a <b>long</b> arm, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> get in the way when working cattle, plus they added extra weight. However, many cowboys owned rifles, and often used them for market hunting in the off season. Though many models were used, Cowboys who were part-time market hunters preferred rifles that could take the widely available [...]45-70 [...] "Government" [...] ammunition, such as certain Sharps, Remington, Springfield models, as well as the Winchester 1876. However, by far the single most popular long arms were the lever-action repeating Winchesters, particularly lighter models such as the Model 1873 chambered for the same [...]44/40 ammunition as the Colt, allowing the cowboy to carry only one kind of ammunition.|$|R
5000|$|In 1882 {{he was the}} Democratic {{nominee for}} the U.S. House seat {{representing}} Iowa's 5th congressional district in the Forty-eighth Congress.

Although the House was controlled by Fredrick's own party, the contest was not resolved until the last hours of the second session. [...] On the morning of inauguration day (March 4, 1885), Frederick was declared the winner of the 1882 race, and was seated minutes before the Forty-eighth Congress ended. Until that day, Republicans had successfully filibustered to prevent a vote by the House on the contest, until continuation of the filibuster would have prevented the House from acting in a popular bill to permit former President Ulysses S. Grant, then on the verge of death, to retire with the benefits of a general. Indeed, that was exactly what opponents of the Grant retirement bill had in mind. By drawing out debate on every contested election case <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> possible, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> prevent the bill from coming to a vote, where the pressure to vote in its favor would be irresistible. Well aware of this, Wilson rose amid intense silence. Since the rules could not be suspended to bring up the Grant bill until his own case had been determined, he announced, he resigned his claim to Frederick immediately. At that the House rose to its feet cheering. The Grant bill sailed through almost instantly.|$|R
500|$|In {{the distant}} past, a {{powerful}} race called the Forerunners fought an alien parasite {{known as the}} Flood. The Flood, which spread through infestation of sentient life, overran much of the Milky Way Galaxy. One of the races affected was humanity, who came into conflict with the Forerunners as a result. Exhausted by their war and after having explored all other options, the Forerunners conceived a weapon of last resort to combat the Flood, called the Halo Array. Using an installation known as the Ark, they built large ring-shaped megastructures known as Halos. The Halo Array, when activated, would destroy all sentient life in the galaxy– depriving the Flood of their food, after which samples of the lost lifeforms would be reseeded. Delaying as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could,</b> the Forerunners activated the rings and disappeared.|$|E

After a little while the British were reinforced, and Glover ordered a retreat, which was done without confusion. The British troops began to advance at the retreating Americans. However, the 200 troops of the 13th Continentals that Glover had stationed behind the stone wall stood up and fired at the British when there were only 30 yards away.

40|$|In {{his study}} on people's morals {{and the right}} to vengeance in the Low Countries, a highly urbanised and {{populated}} area, in the 15 th century (1908), Charles Petit-Dutaillis established a distinction between two trends: whereas public action was superseding vengeance in Flanders as a way to settle conflicts, vengeance was still to endure {{a long time in the}} counties of Namur and Hainaut, as well as in Brabant. The “Haute Cour” of Namur, the court in charge of judicial matters in the capital of the County, has produced many archives from the 14 th century until the end of the Ancien Regime. These archives shed light on vengeance appearing within physical violence cases. A true right to vengeance indeed still existed at the end of the Middle Ages in the County. The court knew the rules according to which vengeance was allowed to be carried out, and many examples show how families asked the court for advice when they had doubts on it. Concurrently, urban authorities tried to restrict the use of vengeance, at least from the 14 th century onwards. By punishing less serious cases of violence through a fine system according to which vengeance was more expensive, they made an attempt for stopping the process escalating <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> still <b>could.</b> <b>They</b> allowed and encouraged peaceful solutions to conflicts and restricted the possibilities for carrying out vengeance, notably as for homicidal vengeance. This restriction implies that the right to homicidal vengeance's legitimacy was to endure in the countryside until a later period. This seems to be confirmed by the analysis of some sources. The clemency of the prince was only granted for homicides committed in town that avenged personal harms or harms to family honour. This did not apply to vengeance that followed a relative's homicide. By contrast, in rural areas, remission letters were granted for homicidal vengeance until the early 16 th century. Later on, vengeance was no longer mentioned as a mitigating circumstance in letters of remission. The Namur's case testifies to the part that towns, at first, played in framing vindicatory violence. Chronologically speaking, the State was the second actor to come into play with an attempt for eradicating vengeance. I will therefore consider the trails left by vengeance in urban judicial sources, the way urban justice framed it, and how population and urban/state authorities' perception of vengeance changed from the 14 th century until the beginning of the 17 th century...|$|R
