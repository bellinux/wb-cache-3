The {{earliest}} gold-seekers {{were people who}} lived near California or people who heard the news from ships on the fastest sailing routes from California. The first large group of Americans to arrive were several thousand Oregonians who came down the Siskiyou Trail. Next came people from the Sandwich Islands, and several thousand <b>Latin</b> <b>Americans,</b> including people from Mexico, from Peru and {{from as far away}} as Chile, both by ship and overland. By the end of 1848, some 6,000 Argonauts had come to California.|$|E
5|$|During World WarII, Brundage {{wrote to}} other IOC members {{that he had}} no {{objection}} to Soviet involvement in international sports, with representation on the IOC, if the USSR joined the international sports federations (ISFs). The IOC required that an NOC be independent of the government of the territory which it represents; there were concerns a Soviet NOC would not be. This was a problem not unique to communist states; a number of <b>Latin</b> <b>Americans</b> countries were starting to bring the local NOCs into the political structure, with an official naming the NOC chair—who might even be the country's political leader. This mixture of sports and politics worried Brundage.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the report}} {{produced}} by the OIR, by 1957 the CIA realized that its version {{of the history of}} the Árbenz government and the coup were not gaining traction. Books written by defenders of the Árbenz government, which were strongly critical of the US intervention, were generally better received. Nationalist <b>Latin</b> <b>Americans</b> were inclined to view the Castillo Armas government as a creation of the US. As a result, the US government decided to allow Ronald Schneider, a historian who was in the process of completing his Ph.D, to access the PBHistory archive. Scheider published Communism in Guatemala: 1944 to 1954 in 1959. Later observers have stated that the publication may have been subsidized in some way by the CIA: both the Foreign Policy Research Institute, where Schneider worked, and Frederick A. Praeger, who published Schneider's book, received CIA funds. Schneider stated in his book that the Comite was responsible for collecting the documents he accessed, but did not mention the CIA's role in funding the Comite, nor did he explain how the documents came to the US. Schneider's book did not rely on PBHistory material alone, but also on information that Schneider gathered during a trip to Mexico and Guatemala in 1957. The book was generally well received.|$|E

50|$|Barbero (2008) {{examines}} {{the development of}} the field of <b>Latin</b> <b>American</b> business history, from the 1960s to 2007. <b>Latin</b> <b>American</b> business history developed in the 1960s, but until the 1980s it was dominated by either highly politicized debates over <b>Latin</b> <b>American</b> underdevelopment or biographies of <b>Latin</b> <b>American</b> entrepreneurs. Since the 1980s, <b>Latin</b> <b>American</b> business history has become a much more professionalized and an integrated part of <b>Latin</b> <b>American</b> academia. It is much less politicized and has moved beyond entrepreneurial biography to histories of companies and industries. However, <b>Latin</b> <b>American</b> business historians have still not devoted enough attention to agricultural enterprises or comparative histories between the many countries. Probably most importantly, <b>Latin</b> <b>American</b> business historians have to become much more versed in business history theory and methodology so as to get beyond mere summation of the region's economic past.|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we examine}} the {{response}} of <b>Latin</b> <b>American</b> stock markets to movements in cross-country <b>Latin</b> <b>American</b> macroeconomic variables. We find little evidence that <b>Latin</b> <b>American</b> stock markets are responsive to these changes. Alternatively, we find that Mexico’s stock market affects other <b>Latin</b> <b>American</b> stock markets but not vice-versa. We also find that the exchange rate of a <b>Latin</b> <b>American</b> country affects its own stock market, suggesting that currency risk is {{an important source of}} risk in Latin America. We conclude that the use of cross-country macroeconomic variables is not very useful for forecasting <b>Latin</b> <b>American</b> stock market movements...|$|R
