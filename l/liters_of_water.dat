5|$|The flaw in Dalton's {{theory was}} {{corrected}} in principle in 1811 by Amedeo Avogadro. Avogadro had proposed that equal volumes of any two gases, at equal temperature and pressure, contain {{equal numbers of}} molecules (in other words, the mass of a gas's particles {{does not affect the}} volume that it occupies). Avogadro's law allowed him to deduce the diatomic nature of numerous gases by studying the volumes at which they reacted. For instance: since two liters of hydrogen will react with just one liter of oxygen to produce two <b>liters</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> vapor (at constant pressure and temperature), it meant a single oxygen molecule splits in two in order to form two particles of water. Thus, Avogadro was able to offer more accurate estimates of the atomic mass of oxygen and various other elements, and made a clear distinction between molecules and atoms.|$|E

50|$|The {{difference}} between osmolarity and molarity {{can be easily}} explained by an example. A physiological saline solution {{can be made by}} 9 g of sodium chloride dissolved in 1 <b>liter</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> or 50 grams of glucose in 1 liter. Salt has a molar mass of 58.44 g/mol, glucose of 180.15 g/mol. 50 grams of glucose results in 278 millimoles of glucose. 9 g of sodium chloride correspond to 154 millimoles of sodium chloride. The osmolarity of the solution of sodium chloride, however, is 308 milliosmoles / liter. This difference is due to the number of particles after solvation: one molecule of sodium chloride in water splits into two ions. Glucose, however, remains one molecule after dissolvation. As a result, the osmolarity of 50 g of glucose in 1 <b>liter</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> is approximately equal to 9 g of sodium chloride in 1 <b>liter</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b>|$|R

25|$|Animals {{that feed}} on grain or rely on grazing require more water than grain crops.

Animals raised for food in the US consume 90% of the soy crop, 80% of the corn crop, and 70% of its grain. However, where an extensive farming system (as opposed to a feedlot) is used, some water and nutrients are returned to the soil to provide a benefit to the pasture. This cycling and processing of water and nutrients is less prevalent in most plant production systems, so may bring the efficiency rate of animal production closer to the efficiency of plant based agricultural systems. In tracking food animal production from the feed through to the dinner table, the inefficiencies of meat, milk, and egg production range from a 4:1 energy input to protein output ratio up to 54:1. The result is that producing animal-based food is typically much less efficient than the harvesting of grains, vegetables, legumes, seeds, and fruits.|$|E
