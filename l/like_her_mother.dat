5|$|Also <b>like</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> whose Letters from Sweden was {{foundational}} to {{the writing}} of both History of a Six Weeks' Tour and Rambles, Shelley emphasised her maternal role in the text. She describes herself as a conventional figure, worrying about her son. Rather than the scandal-ridden young woman of her youth, which she wrote about in the Tour, she is now a demure, respectable, middle-aged woman.|$|E

5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> the Duchess of Argyll was a {{prominent}} opponent of slavery. The pair helped write a letter titled An Affectionate and Christian Address of Many Thousands of Women of Great Britain and Ireland to Their Sisters, the Women of the United States of America, calling for an end of slavery; it attracted signatures from 562,848 British women. The two often hosted the American abolitionist and author Harriet Beecher Stowe when she visited England. Lady Campbell and Beecher Stowe were friends and maintained a correspondence.|$|E
5|$|Ned was so {{supportive}} {{of her career}} plans that Mary reconsidered marriage, although she knew both their parents would disapprove. With her studies completed, Mary and Ned became formally engaged at Easter in 1921, and they were married on 6 April 1922 at Toorak Presbyterian Church. They had three daughters: Mary Cecile (Molly) in 1924, Judith Ann (Judy) in 1926, and Margaret Lyle in 1933. Molly would later become a doctor <b>like</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother.</b>|$|E
5|$|As a spouse, surgeon, and mother, Meredith has cited {{a number}} times {{that she did}} not want to be like either of her parents: her father had {{followed}} her mother around pathetically before leaving to be happy, while her mother valued her career over her family. Meredith is frequently conflicted trying to balance between the two, and fears her family are hindering her medical aspirations, as much as she fears becoming <b>like</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> whenever she's tempted to choose surgery over family. Meredith and Cristina have a huge rift when Cristina confirms Meredith's fears by stating that Meredith's skills have fallen behind Cristina's due to her familial obligations taking her away from OR time.|$|E

Blair explains to Serena that after completing high school with Nate, he feels like simply a high school boyfriend. The girls reminisce about growing up together through crazy times, like sisters. Lily apologizes to Rufus and CeCe. Rufus expresses concern that Lily is too unpredictable and too much <b>like</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother.</b> CeCe remains indifferent, but agrees to return to Lily's home.|$|E

5|$|Beatrice was the shyest {{of all of}} Queen Victoria's children. However, {{because she}} {{accompanied}} Queen Victoria almost wherever she went, she became among the best known. Despite her shyness, she was an able actress and dancer {{as well as a}} keen artist and photographer. She was devoted to her children and was concerned when they misbehaved at school. To those who enjoyed her friendship, she was loyal and had a sense of humour, and as a public figure she was driven by a strong sense of duty. She was Patron of the Isle of Wight Branch of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution from 1920 until her death. Music, a passion that was shared by her mother and the Prince Consort, was something in which Beatrice excelled, and she played the piano to professional standards. <b>Like</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> she was a devout Christian, fascinated by theology until her death. With her calm temperament and personal warmth, the princess won wide approval.|$|E
5|$|Dearly Stars occurs {{prior to}} the events in The Idolmaster 2, and {{revolves}} around characters related to the talent agency 876 Production (876 Pro), a rising studio located in a small office. The three main characters are Ai Hidaka, Eri Mizutani and Ryō Akizuki—three prospective pop idols introduced in Dearly Stars. In Ai's story, she is an energetic girl {{who wants to be}} an idol <b>like</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> Mai had been, but she becomes discouraged after failing to pass several idol auditions. One of the judges at her most recent audition was 765 Production's (765 Pro) Haruka Amami, who catches up with Ai in a nearby park and decides to introduce her to 876 Pro. The president of 876 Pro, Minori Ishikawa, immediately hires Ai and wants to promote her as Mai's daughter, but Ai insists on becoming a popular idol on her own.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> Ellen Ewing Sherman was {{a devout}} Roman Catholic, and the Shermans' eight {{children}} were reared in that faith. In 1864, Ellen took up temporary residence in South Bend, Indiana, {{to have her}} young family educated at the University of Notre Dame and St. Mary's College. In 1874, with Sherman having become world-famous, their eldest child, Marie Ewing ("Minnie") Sherman, also had a politically prominent wedding, attended by President Ulysses S. Grant and commemorated by a generous gift from the Khedive of Egypt. (Eventually, one of Minnie's daughters married a grandson of Confederate general Lewis Addison Armistead.) Another of the Sherman daughters, Eleanor, was married to Alexander Montgomery Thackara at General Sherman's home in Washington, D.C., on May 5, 1880. To Sherman's great displeasure and sorrow, his oldest surviving son, Thomas Ewing Sherman, joined the religious order of the Jesuits in 1878 and was ordained as a priest in 1889.|$|E
2500|$|Further extrasensory {{communication}} ensued. The automatic writing {{gradually became}} easier and the handwriting became that of <b>her</b> <b>mother's.</b> According to Vera and her father, Vera's handwriting [...] "had always been rounded, loopy and backward-sloping." [...] Vera had struggled {{to correct this}} having been repeatedly told at school that such penmanship was [...] "a sign of bad character". But {{no matter how often}} school masters implored her, she could not remedy matters. But whilst transmitting messages from <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>her</b> own handwriting became sharp, pointed and italic, sloping [...] "steeply forwards" [...] <b>like</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother's.</b>|$|R
60|$|He gave Imogene a droll glance, {{and then}} bent it upon Effie's {{discreet}} face. The child dropped {{her eyes with}} a blush <b>like</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother's,</b> having first sought provisional counsel of Imogene, who turned away. He rightly inferred that they all had been talking him over at breakfast, and he broke into a laugh which they joined in, but Imogene said nothing {{in recognition of the}} fact.|$|R

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} influences on History of a Six Weeks' Tour was Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark (1796), written by Mary Shelley's mother Mary Wollstonecraft. A travel narrative that reflects on topography, politics, society, aesthetics, and the author's personal feelings, it provided a model for Mary Shelley's work. <b>Like</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> Mary Shelley revealed her liberalism by boldly discussing politics; however, this political tone was unusual for travel works at the time and was considered inappropriate for women writers. Like Wollstonecraft's Letters, History of a Six Weeks' Tour blurs the line between private and public spheres by using intimate genres such as the journal and the letter, allowing Mary Shelley to present political opinions through personal anecdote and the picturesque.|$|E
5|$|Rodham's {{mother wanted}} her to have an independent, {{professional}} career, and her father, who was otherwise a traditionalist, felt that his daughter's abilities and opportunities should not be limited by gender. Raised in a politically conservative household, Rodham helped canvass Chicago's South Side at age 13 following the very close 1960 U.S. presidential election, where she saw evidence of electoral fraud (such as voting list entries showing addresses that were empty lots) against Republican candidate Richard Nixon. She then volunteered to campaign for Republican candidate Barry Goldwater in the U.S. presidential election of 1964. Rodham's early political development was shaped most by her high school history teacher (like her father, a fervent anti-communist), who introduced her to Goldwater's The Conscience of a Conservative and by her Methodist youth minister (<b>like</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> concerned with issues of social justice), with whom she saw and afterwards briefly met, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. at a 1962 speech in Chicago's Orchestra Hall.|$|E
5|$|Maria, <b>like</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> {{was likely}} a carrier of the {{hemophilia}} gene {{and might have}} passed on the disease to another generation if she had survived to have the children she dreamed of. One of Alexandra's brothers and two of her nephews, {{as well as one}} of her maternal uncles and two children of one of her first cousins were all hemophiliacs, as was Maria's brother Alexei. Maria herself reportedly hemorrhaged in December 1914 during an operation to remove her tonsils, according to her paternal aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia, who was interviewed later in her life. The doctor performing the operation was so unnerved that he had to be ordered to continue by Maria's mother, Tsarina Alexandra. Olga Alexandrovna said she believed all four of her nieces bled more than was normal and believed they were carriers of the hemophilia gene like their mother. Symptomatic carriers of the gene, while not hemophiliacs themselves, can have symptoms of hemophilia including a lower than normal blood clotting factor that can lead to heavy bleeding during childbirth or surgical procedures such as a tonsillectomy. DNA testing on the remains of the royal family proved in 2009 that Alexei suffered from hemophilia B, a rarer form of the disease. The same testing proved that his mother and one of the four Grand Duchesses were carriers. Russians identify the grand duchess who carried the gene as Anastasia, but American scientists identified the young woman as Maria.|$|E

Mary Harding's {{brother was}} Joseph Harding who standardised {{the production of}} modern Cheddar Cheese. They were the children of Joseph Harding and Mary Yeoman. The parents of this Mary Yeoman were the diarists John Yeoman [...] and Mary Yeoman, both of Wanstrow.|$|R
60|$|So indeed she was. Her head, {{large and}} shapely {{and her eyes}} wide, dark and curiously reflective, were <b>like</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother's.</b> True, she hadn't much nose, but her hair was {{abundant}} and her fingers exquisite. She lay in my big paws with what {{seemed to me to}} be tranquil confidence, and though her legs were comically rudimentary, her glance manifested an unassailable dignity. My father insisted she resembled her grandmother.|$|R

She is the [...] "golden thread" [...] after whom Book the Second is named, so called because she holds her father's and her family's lives together (and because of <b>her</b> blond hair <b>like</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother's).</b> She also ties nearly every character in the book together.|$|R
5000|$|Francesca Shaw: The heiress of her family's company, Shaw Foods. She is Nick's vain, snobbish, and socialite ex-girlfriend who doesn't <b>like</b> Rachel. <b>Her</b> <b>mother,</b> Nadine, is {{also good}} friends with Eleanor.|$|R
5000|$|Riva, a {{depressed}} retail manager, visits {{the hospital where}} <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> receives treatment for mental illness. During these visits, Riva convinces herself that <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> would be fine without the hospital, but Riva’s view of reality is warped because she also wishes her life was better, <b>like</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother’s.</b> <b>Her</b> <b>mother</b> expresses <b>her</b> wish for Riva to get back together with her boyfriend Phillip, but she forgets that Riva has been married to another man, Tom, for six years. Riva is stuck on losing Phillip, hinting that {{the title of the}} story, [...] "To Fill," [...] may be a letter “to Phillip,” as a play on words. Riva’s life goes in a downward spiral, and when she catches Tom with his mistress, she stabs him in the stomach.
