For more specific applications, where the requirement is {{to locate the}} position of a fast moving, single <b>luminous</b> <b>spot</b> over a delimited area (single particle positioning, beam spot monitoring, …) such kind of devices is somewhat cumbersome to use, due to the huge number of pixels needed to be read in order to get high resolution the spatial position of the luminous signal. The data throughput limits the use of pixel arrays to those applications where a time resolution of a few hundred frames per second is sufficient. In this contribution we propose a novel device, based on solid state sensors, able to perform two dimensional imaging of a <b>luminous</b> <b>spot</b> with a frame rate (first prototype) of about 10 kHz and a spatial resolution better than 800 * 800 points over a 25 mm diameter circular field of view.

The underestimation imposes little memory load and does not require tracking of the trajectory.

40|$|AbstractPrevious {{studies have}} shown that low amplitude/high {{frequency}} mechanical vibration applied to the human eye muscles results in the illusory movement of a <b>luminous</b> <b>spot</b> fixated in total darkness. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate whether a vibration-induced motor response also occurs in eye muscles, and to check whether the visual illusions actually result from the proprioceptors being activated by the vibration, or whether they are simply due to the retinal slip induced by the reflex eye movement. The effects of the vibratory stimuli on the inferior rectus (IR) and lateral rectus (LR) muscles were evaluated by recording subjects' eye position changes. When applied to the IR muscle, vibration effectively elicited an upward visual illusion accompanied by a small downward ocular rotation, whereas when applied to the LR muscle, it also induced horizontal visual illusion, which was less frequent and weaker than the vertical one, but no ocular rotation. We concluded that visual illusions of this kind cannot be attributable to the retinal motion of the image of the fixated point. The difference between the vertical and horizontal vibratory motor responses is discussed as regards the particular role that oculo-muscular proprioception may play in the vertical muscles...|$|E

40|$|Charge-coupled devices (CCDs) {{are widely}} used in {{astronomy}} {{to carry out a}} variety of measurements, such as for flux or shape of astrophysical objects. The data reduction procedures almost always assume that ther esponse of a given pixel to illumination is independent of the content of the neighboring pixels. We show evidence that this simple picture is not exact for several CCD sensors. Namely, we provide evidence that localized distributions of charges (resulting from star illumination or laboratory <b>luminous</b> <b>spots)</b> tend to broaden linearly with increasing brightness by up to a few percent over the whole dynamic range. We propose a physical explanation for this "brighter-fatter" effect, which implies that flatfields do not exactly follow Poisson statistics: the variance of flatfields grows less rapidly than their average, and neighboring pixels show covariances, which increase similarly to the square of the flatfield average. These covariances decay rapidly with pixel separation. We observe the expected departure from Poisson statistics of flatfields on CCD devices and show that the observed effects are compatible with Coulomb forces induced by stored charges that deflect forthcoming charges. We extract the strength of the deflections from the correlations of flatfield images and derive the evolution of star shapes with increasing flux. We show for three types of sensors that within statistical uncertainties,our proposed method properly bridges statistical properties of flatfields and the brighter-fatter effect...|$|R
40|$|Flakes {{in effect}} coatings, which are {{responsible}} for its color shift, are not perfectly horizontally oriented, producing a non uniform texture when observed {{from a distance of}} around one meter or less. If the coating is illuminated by a diffuse source, a granular appearance is observed, called graininess. But when the coating is illuminated by unidirectional light, some <b>luminous</b> <b>spots</b> on a dark background appear, effect that is known as sparkle. The characterization of these two textures is getting more important for automotive industry because of the high percentage of cars with effect coatings and because improvements in imaging technology allows this effect to be measured by, for instance, commercial instruments as BYK-mac. A single analytical model to understand and radiometrically characterize both sparkle and graininess in effect coatings is presented and studied in this work. It allows both patterns to be explained and, despite its simplicity, includes variables related to the optical system (Point Spread Function (PSF) and size of the entrance pupil), its distance to the coating, the diffusion grade of the illumination, the illumination and observation directions, and coating parameters. © 2013 Optical Society of AmericaAuthors are grateful to “Plan Nacional de Física” for funding this work FIS 2010 - 19756 -E, to CSIC’s JAE Program and ”European Social Fund” for awarding us a research trainee.

40|$|In 1979, Voyager I {{provided}} the first strong {{evidence for the}} existence of lightning on another planet. Two pictures taken while the spacecraft was in Jupiter's shadow reveal about three dozen <b>luminous</b> <b>spots</b> on the night side of the planet. After careful examination of these spots, we conclude that they are lightning flashes occurring somewhere within Jupiter's atmosphere. A search through the additional Voyager I and II images of Jupiter's night hemisphere failed to locate any additional lightning flashes. The lower limit for the planetary lightning rate on Jupiter is found to be 10 ⁻⁴ km⁻² yr⁻¹. It must be noted that the spacecraft could only detect lightning discharges at least 1000 times higher than typical terrestrial flashes. Furthermore, due to attenuation, any discharges occurring deep within the atmosphere could not have been imaged. Calculations suggest that the actual flash rate could be about 0. 1 km⁻² yr⁻¹. Analysis of the lightning images reveals that the flashes group near 50 °N latitude. High-resolution photographs of the lightning region made in daylight about 65 hours before the discovery images show long, light ribbon-like clouds. Almost every flash appears to be associated with one of these clouds. Calculations made with a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code that computes the luminosity distribution of the spot {{on the top of the}} ammonia cloud that is produced by a point source within the atmosphere indicate that the lightning production region is near the top of the lower cloud deck. The average optical energy radiated by a discharge is calculated to be about 10 ⁹ J. The total electrical energy is estimated to be about 3 x 10 ¹² J.

40|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} of the retina affected by photoreceptor loss (e. g., cases of retinitis pigmentosa) elicits the perception of <b>luminous</b> <b>spots</b> (so-called phosphenes) in the visual field. This phenomenon, attributed to the relatively high survival rates of neurons comprising the retina's inner layer, serves as the cornerstone of efforts to provide a microelectronic retinal prosthesis [...] a device analogous to the cochlear implant. This thesis concerns phosphenes [...] their elicitation and modulation, and, in turn, image analysis {{for use in a}} prosthesis. This thesis begins with a comparative review of visual modelling of electrical epiretinal stimulation and analogous acoustic modelling of electrical cochlear stimulation. The latter models involve coloured noise played to normal listeners so as to investigate speech processing and electrode design for use in cochlear implants. Subsequently, four experiments (three psychophysical and one numerical), and two statistical analyses, are presented. Intrinsic signal optical imaging in cerebral cortex is canvassed appendically. The first experiment describes a visual tracking task administered to 20 normal observers afforded simulated prosthetic vision. Fixation, saccade, and smooth pursuit, and the effect of practice, were assessed. Further, an image analysis scheme is demonstrated that, compared to existing approaches, assisted fixation and pursuit (but not saccade) accuracy (35. 8 % and 6. 8 %, respectively), and required less phosphene array scanning. Subsequently, (numerical) information-theoretic reasoning is provided for the scheme's superiority. This reasoning was then employed to further optimise the scheme (resulting in a filter comprising overlapping Gaussian kernels), and may be readily extended to arbitrary arrangements of many phosphenes. A face recognition study, wherein stimuli comprised either size- or intensity-modulated phosphenes, is then presented. The study involved unpracticed observers (n= 85), and showed no 'size' [...] versus [...] 'intensity' effect. Overall, a 400 -phosphene (100 -phosphene) image afforded subjects 89. 0 % (64. 0 %) correct recognition (two-interval forced-choice paradigm) when five seconds' scanning was allowed. Performance fell (64. 5 %) when the 400 -phosphene image was stabilised on the retina and presented briefly. Scanning was similar in 400 - and 100 -phosphene tasks. The final chapter presents the statistical effects of sampling and rendering jitter on the phosphene image.

From the dimensions, the radial field at {{the surface of the}} filament was 228 times the applied potential difference. The electron currents pulled from the tungsten by the high fields (field currents) rise steadily from 10 ^- 12 to 10 ^- 3 amp. as the field is increased from about 400 to 1100 kv/cm. In the dark, <b>luminous</b> <b>spots</b> were seen on the anode, indicating that these currents come from a few active surface spots. The field current (for a given voltage) depends on the value of the maximum field current previously drawn from it (conditioning current), being reversibly reproducible below the conditioning current. The higher the conditioning current, the lower the field current. A previous heating to high temperatures (2400 °C) decreases the field current and also decreases the slope of the current-voltage curve. Both effects (current and heating) show fatigue. Variation with temperature of the filament, to 800 °C. The field currents are completely independent of temperature up to 700 °, but a temperature of 800 ° increases the currents due to a given field when this is sufficiently large, by a factor which is roughly independent of the current (10 - 8 to 10 - 4 amp.). Electron theory. In explanation of these results, it is suggested that the field currents are due to conduction electrons pulled from minute peaks on the surface, the fatigue effects of both current treatment and heat treatment being due to the rounding off of these peaks by positive ion bombardment or by temperature. Chemical changes may also alter the surface. The lack of dependence of field currents upon temperature furnishes strong evidence that most of the conduction electrons do not share in the energy of thermal agitation. The thermions, however, do share in this energy; they are presumably responsible for the Peltier and thermo-electric effects. In this theory it is assumed that conduction electrons follow the same sort of quantum laws in their escape from the solid as do atoms of a light element at temperatures far below the boiling point...|$|R

40|$|Radiative {{characteristics}} of large optically thick pool fires (d = 3. 4 m) of two organic peroxides [(tert-butyl peroxybenzoate (TBPB) and tert-butyl peroxy- 2 -ethylhexanoate (TBPEH) ] are experimentally investigated and predicted with CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulation. Time averaged flame temperatures T and irradiances E of TBPEH {{are higher than}} of a TBPB flame due to 1. 4 times higher burning rate. The instantaneous maximum surface emissive power (SEPmax) {{is found to be}} three times of time averaged (SEP) values. A method of sphere analogy for calculating SEPmax is suggested for TBPEH flame. CFD predicted values of E and T are good in agreement with measurements provided T of three different zones (hot <b>spot,</b> <b>luminous</b> zone, flame surface) are used for calculation. Grey gas pool fire model of Fay is used for the estimation of SEP for TBPB and TBPEH...|$|R
40|$|We present Nubble Space Telescope Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 {{broadband}} red and {{linear ramp}} filter (isolating redshifted [O II] lambda 3727) observations and subarcsecond-resolution 15, 22, and 43 GHz VLA {{observations of the}} radio-loud quasar 3 C 380. We confirm the report of de Vries et ai. that there is good correspondence between the locations of two optical and radio knots/hot spots in the jet. We show that the optical knots are continuum rather than line emission. The radio-optical spectrum can be fitted either by a normal radio spectrum (alpha similar to - 0. 8) with a break somewhere in the infrared or by a steeper single power law (alpha similar to - 1) (where S-v proportional to v(alpha)). We suggest that the two knots are radiating optical synchrotron emission. This would make the knots in 3 C 380 the most <b>luminous</b> optical knots/hot <b>spots</b> currently known...|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 12 mm. The forewings are yellowish brown, crossed by oblique whitish streaks mixed with shining steel-like metallic scales, some minute blackish scales intermixed along their margins. A slender steely line, commencing {{at the base}} of the costa, crosses the fold obliquely outward to the dorsum, beyond it is a broader whitish costal streak, also crossing the fold obliquely outward, but scarcely reaching the dorsum. A third steely streak, from the costa before the middle, tending obliquely outward, is enlarged at the lower end of the cell and reverts to the middle of the dorsum, it is preceded by a pale plical spot margined on its inner side by black scales. Beyond this, about the middle of the costa, an oblique whitish streak tends outward to the end of the cell where it meets a more conspicuous white streak inverted from the costal cilia, both mixed with pale steel and blackish scales. Beyond the last white costal streak the costal cilia are greyish fuscous, with two inverted whitish streaklets at their base, a third shining white streak following the termen {{at the base of}} thewhitish cilia through which run two dark shade-lines terminating before the tornus where a yellowish white line in the tornal cilia interrupts them. Near the base of this is a <b>luminous</b> steely <b>spot,</b> with some minute black scales along the margin. The hindwings and cilia are tawny greyish.|$|R
