5|$|South Park was {{the first}} weekly program to be rated TV-MA rating, and is {{generally}} intended for adult audiences. The boys and most other child characters use strong profanity, with only the most taboo words being bleeped during a typical broadcast.

5|$|The {{landscape}} of the Catlins features in many poems by celebrated poet Hone Tuwhare. Born in Northland, Tuwhare lived in Kaka Point from 1992 {{until his death in}} 2008, and became one of the area's best-known inhabitants. His family plan to establish a writers' retreat at his crib there. The film Two <b>Little</b> <b>Boys,</b> starring comedians Bret McKenzie and Hamish Blake, was filmed in the Catlins early in 2011.|$|E
5|$|According to E. P. Sanders, {{the birth}} {{narratives}} in Matthew and Luke are the clearest case of invention in the Gospel narratives of Jesus' life. Both accounts have Jesus born in Bethlehem, {{in accordance with}} Jewish salvation history, and both have him growing up in Nazareth. But Sanders points that the two Gospels report completely different and irreconcilable explanations for how that happened. Luke's account of a census in which everyone returned to their ancestral cities is not plausible. Matthew's account is more plausible, but the story reads {{as though it was}} invented to identify Jesus as like a new Moses, and the historian Josephus reports Herod the Great's brutality without ever mentioning that he massacred <b>little</b> <b>boys.</b>|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, across town, Honest John and Gideon meet a coachman who {{promises}} {{to pay them}} money if they can find naughty <b>little</b> <b>boys</b> {{for him to take}} to Pleasure Island. Encountering Pinocchio on his way home, they convince him that he needs to take a vacation there. On the way to Pleasure Island, he befriends Lampwick, a delinquent boy. Without rules or authority to enforce their activity, Pinocchio and the other boys soon engage in smoking tobacco, gambling, vandalism, and getting drunk, much to Jiminy's dismay. Later, while trying to get home, Jiminy discovers that the island hides a horrible curse: the boys brought to Pleasure Island are transformed into donkeys and sold into slave labor. Jiminy runs back to warn Pinocchio, only to discover that Lampwick has transformed into a donkey; Pinocchio manages to escape, only partially transformed.|$|E
5|$|When the war ended, {{it was not}} {{expected}} that the inefficient Little Boy design would ever again be required, and many plans and diagrams were destroyed. However, by mid-1946 the Hanford Site reactors were suffering badly from the Wigner effect. Faced {{with the prospect of}} no more plutonium for new cores and no more polonium for the initiators for the cores that had already been produced, Groves ordered that a number of <b>Little</b> <b>Boys</b> be prepared as an interim measure until a cure could be found. No Little Boy assemblies were available, and no comprehensive set of diagrams of the Little Boy could be found, although there were drawings of the various components, and stocks of spare parts.|$|E

25|$|In late 1967 {{or early}} 1968, the penniless Driscoll left The Factory and {{disappeared}} into Manhattan's underground. On March 30, 1968, about three weeks after his 31st birthday, two <b>little</b> <b>boys</b> playing in a deserted East Village tenement at 371 East 10th St. found his body lying on a cot, with two empty beer bottles and religious pamphlets scattered on the ground. The medical examination determined that he had died from heart failure caused by an advanced hardening of the arteries because of his longtime drug abuse. There was no identification on the body, and photos taken of it and shown around the neighborhood yielded no positive identification. When Driscoll's body went unclaimed, he was buried in an unmarked pauper's grave in New York City's Potter's Field on Hart Island.|$|E
25|$|As {{children}} grow older they slowly grow into their roles within their society. Both genders learn from adults {{how to do}} certain things that later will help the tribe. For example, girls learn how to make doll clothing, which teaches them how to make real garments. Boys, on the other hand, are given miniature bows for them to practice hunting very small game with. Children at young ages are integrated into society evenly. They are given small tasks based on their age to follow. Boys practice hunting and follow men on some hunting events. Having <b>little</b> <b>boys</b> follow the men into hunting events lets them learn firsthand how to hunt, receive tips on what to do while hunting, and gain experience for when they do events when they are older. Girls learn the same way. They watch the women of the society do their daily routines and mimic them on smaller scales. Like the example given above with the doll making. Having a little girl make the clothes for themselves teaches them how to make clothing they would want in the future.|$|E
500|$|Tunis' next novel, Go Team Go, set in 1954, {{returns to}} Indiana basketball. Again a coach risks {{the support of}} fans by cutting players, {{including}} the team star. The hero, Tom Williams, comes to see that his coach was right, and gets his father's respect – and the girl – by helping the new team move forward. Buddy and the Old Pro is a 1955 novel about Pop Warner football. Tunis disliked organized sports for young children, saying [...] "I've always believed Little League is harmful to the extreme. It's for the parents, and that's what I object to... I don't {{like the idea of}} having <b>little</b> <b>boys</b> playing in front of their parents and friends. <b>Little</b> <b>boys</b> should be playing their sports by themselves." [...] In what Michelle Nolan in Ball Tales calls a [...] "remarkable book", Tunis uses his only non-Dodgers baseball novel to emphasize a favorite theme when the young protagonist admits to his father [...] "it's better to lose, much as it hurts, than to play dirty".|$|E
50|$|The harlot {{takes one}} of the men home and when another man sees him in the house, the other man is murdered. Unbeknownst to both parties, both the middle-aged man's group and the blind man's group are in the same house. The <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> wakes up and hears his father's voice and runs out to him. He again leaves in a haste, but this time the <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> follows him. The blind man wakes up hearing the <b>little</b> <b>boy's</b> cries and stumbles upon the murdered man.

The <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> is stranded on {{an island in the}} chaotic, bustling street, surrounded by horses, bicycles, pedestrians, and cars. A police officer stops traffic and walks the <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> across the street into the police office. Meanwhile, the blind man is sliding along a wall, looking desperately for the <b>little</b> <b>boy.</b> He mistakenly steps too far into the street and falls down onto the sidewalk after being nearly run over by a car.

500|$|Uranium-235 {{was derived}} from {{enrichment}} of natural uranium at the Y-12 plant and K-25 site in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Improvements in the processes and procedures of the electromagnetic and gaseous isotope separation between October 1945 and June 1946 led {{to an increase in}} production to around [...] of uranium-235 per month, which was only enough for one of the very wasteful <b>Little</b> <b>Boys.</b> A Fat Man was 17.5 times as efficient as a Little Boy, but a ton of uranium ore could yield eight times as much uranium-235 as plutonium, and on a per-gram basis, plutonium cost somewhere between four and eight times as much to produce as uranium-235, which at this time cost around $26 per gram.|$|E

500|$|Desmond Ryan of The Philadelphia Inquirer {{thought that}} Leslie Nielsen was deceptively portrayed {{in a major}} role {{similar to that of}} Lieutenant Frank Drebin from The Naked Gun films, instead having merely [...] "a running and unfunny gag about his {{malfunctioning}} answering machine and generally wasted otherwise". [...] Ryan also found the film's dialogue to be [...] "painful" [...] and considered Surf Ninjas to be [...] "beyond airheaded". [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle considered the story of Surf Ninjas to be [...] "harmless and painfully dull". LaSalle thought that the pacing of the film was too long with only [...] "two smirks over the course of 90 minutes". [...] Sean Piccoli of The Washington Times thought that the film's [...] "dull stretch" [...] was buoyed by the presence of Rob Schneider. [...] Piccoli compared the martial arts choreography in the film to the [...] "cartoon fantasies that <b>little</b> <b>boys</b> re-enact on neighbors' lawns: the good guys, alone and outnumbered by the charging horde, air-punch their way to glory".|$|E
500|$|As a boy Demosthenes had {{a speech}} impediment: Plutarch {{refers to a}} {{weakness}} in his voice of [...] "a perplexed and indistinct utterance and a shortness of breath, which, by breaking and disjointing his sentences much obscured the sense and meaning of what he spoke." [...] There are problems in Plutarch's account, however, and {{it is probable that}} Demosthenes actually suffered rhotacism, mispronouncing ρ (r) as λ (l). Aeschines taunted him and referred to him in his speeches by the nickname [...] "Batalus", apparently invented by Demosthenes' pedagogues or by the <b>little</b> <b>boys</b> with whom he was playing and corresponding {{to the way in which}} a person with that variety of rhotacism would pronounce Battaros, the name of a legendary Libyan king who spoke quickly and in a disordered fashion. Demosthenes undertook a disciplined programme to overcome his weaknesses and improve his delivery, including diction, voice and gestures. According to one story, when he was asked to name the three most important elements in oratory, he replied [...] "Delivery, delivery and delivery!"* G. Kennedy, [...] "Oratory", 517–18. It is unknown whether such vignettes are factual accounts of events in Demosthenes' life or merely anecdotes used to illustrate his perseverance and determination.|$|E
500|$|In October 1954, {{flooding}} {{caused by}} Hurricane Hazel caused {{the destruction of}} bridges and buildings in the valley. As {{a consequence of the}} destruction on the Don and other rivers, the provincial government of Ontario banned development on river floodplains. In 1957, the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (MTRCA) was formed, merging all conservation authorities responsible for Toronto watersheds (including the DVCA), with greater powers to manage valley lands. The MTRCA began expropriating privately owned land in the valley for flood control, often creating or conserving open space uses. Sauriol, who was by then an employee of the MTRCA, {{was one of the few}} to speak out against the parkway project. Sauriol's cottage at the Forks of the Don would be expropriated by Metro Toronto for the parkway, although much of his land is now part of the Charles Sauriol Conservation Reserve, which extends from the Forks of the Don, along the East Don to Milne Hollow at Lawrence Avenue, visible from the parkway. By contrast, Metro chairman Gardiner had an opposite opinion of the Don Valley and was quoted [...] "I'll tell you what the Don Valley was.

Baradwaj Rangan of The Hindu said, [...] "My interest in Karnan (apart from the critic's mandate that I see everything) was primarily the songs", and noted that Sirkazhi Govindarajan's [...] "liquid diction and brass-throated conviction makes today's male singers sound like tentative <b>little</b> <b>boys</b> in a parent's day recital". Meera Srinivasan, another critic from The Hindu praised the film for the [...] "music score and songs by the inimitable Viswanathan-Ramamoorthy duo with Kannadasan's striking lyrics". Malathi Rangarajan said, [...] "The illustrious composing duo of Viswanathan and Ramamurthy has worked magic with music". M. Suganth of The Times of India stated [...] "The songs are one too many (but what songs they are!)". K. N. Vijayan of The New Straits Times said, [...] "Instead of trooping out, the audience sat through the 14 songs composed by the Viswanathan-Ramamoorty pair. They are that famous and many can sing along to the lyrics as the songs have been heard countless times on the radio". Writing for The Hindu, C. V. Vasudevan wrote that Karnan [...] "stood out for its brilliant orchestration by Viswanathan-Ramamoorthy and Kannadasan’s lyrical beauty." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1993, despite not seeing or {{speaking}} to Jackson {{for a number of}} years, La Toya Jackson claimed that her brother was a pedophile and that she had proof, which she was prepared to disclose for a fee of $500,000. A bidding war between US and UK tabloids began, but fell through when they realized that her revelations were not what she had claimed them to be. Then in Israel, she stated, [...] "I cannot and will not be a silent collaborator in his crimes against young children... Forget about the superstar, forget about the icon. If he was any other 35-year-old man who was sleeping with <b>little</b> <b>boys,</b> you wouldn't like this guy". She also claimed that checks had been made out to several boys and that Jackson's own physical abuse as a child had turned him into an abuser. She would later claim that Jackson had tried to kidnap and kill her. The rest of the family disowned her, and in subsequent years she would insist that she was forced to make the allegations by her then husband for financial gain. Just prior to making the allegations, her husband was arrested for striking her in the face, arms and legs with a chair. By the turn of the millennium Jackson had forgiven his sister.|$|E
500|$|Blair Marnell of Crave Online {{noted that}} [...] "Night Terrors" [...] was {{reminiscent}} of the second series episode [...] "Fear Her", but said that this episode [...] "fared {{a little bit better}} because it didn't rely on Jamie Oram's George to be anything more than a scared little boy". She also praised Matt Smith's performance and Arthur Darvill's Rory, who was [...] "quickly becoming one of the funniest companions of the new Doctor Who", though she commented that Amy's transformation into a doll was [...] "kind of glossed over within the story itself" [...] and [...] "there was never any doubt that it would be reversed". Overall, the episode was given a 7 out of 10 rating. Sam McPherson, writing for Zap2it, called [...] "Night Terrors" [...] the [...] "worst episode of series 6 so far" [...] that was an [...] "incoherent mess of an episode that was utterly unenjoyable" [...] and gave it an overall grade of a C+. He criticised the idea to follow up a story arc-heavy episode with a standalone one, as he felt it [...] "served as a speed bump for the forward momentum started in [...] "A Good Man Goes to War" [...] and continued through [...] "Let's Kill Hitler". He thought that its [...] "biggest flaw" [...] was that George was sidelined in favour of Alex, which missed an opportunity to make it a story [...] "about <b>little</b> <b>boys</b> overcoming fear and fighting off the monsters in their closets". However, he did praise dialogue delivered by Smith and Darvill.|$|E
