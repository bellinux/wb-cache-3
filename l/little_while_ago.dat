500|$|Kimura {{eventually}} {{spoke with}} Marvelous Entertainment's Yoshiro Wada {{about creating a}} game mixing a [...] "flare of [...] and Japan a <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>ago</b> (say about 40 years ago)". Kimura wanted Chulip to be localized {{to show the world}} certain aspects of Japanese culture and [...] "all the kind of interesting stuff that you can see every day". He also wanted to display a real, modern truancy problem for Japanese students with the game's cast of underground dwellers. Norikazu Yasunaga designed many of the game's mechanics. According to Kimura, [...] "for efficient procedure, [...] set it up so that the personality and the characteristics for each NPC had to be one-by-one". The character designs were done by Ryuji Nouguchi, who used items from Kimura's personal scrapbook and [...] "made them funny". The musical score to Chulip was composed by Hirofumi Taniguchi, another former member of Love-de-Lic. The soundtrack was released by King Records in Japan on a single disc on November 22, 2002. Songs 35 through 44 represent the [...] "Tsurukame Movie Soundtrack", consisting of music for each of the game's short films, while songs 45 and 46 are bonus tracks.|$|E
2500|$|On 3 January 2017 Cartwright was {{presented}} his baggy green cap by former Australian cricketer Tom Moody {{to make his}} debut in third Test match against Pakistan, replacing Nic Maddinson. Cartwright averaged over 44.50 with the bat and had taken 15 wickets from 16 games at 44. Captain Steve Smith said Cartwright's bowling had [...] "improved a lot {{over the last year}} or so. I remember facing him a <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>ago</b> and I think since then he's probably gained 10ks and got a lot more consistent with his areas. I think he's improved a lot. I guess it depends how much we'll use him, how the game goes. But he's certainly improved over the last year." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{have also}} to {{acknowledge}} receipt of a letter from Mr. H.E. Holmes of Durban, enclosing the text of a pronouncement made by the South African Board of Control to the effect that, {{in the opinion of}} that body, the contest between the MCC team and The Reef at Vogelfontein on 22 and 23 December 1909, was not a first-class match. In the course of this encounter Hobbs scored 70 runs which are counted in his first-class aggregate. Seeing that the game was regarded, {{at the time it was}} played, as first-class and until a <b>little</b> <b>while</b> <b>ago</b> had been left in undisputed possession of that rank, the need for raising any question about the matter after more than twenty years is not at all obvious. In any circumstances, I should not advise the dragging up of what, with all due respect to the recent ruling of the South African Board, must remain a debatable matter. The Reef team included some Test match players and others who had appeared in Inter-State games so it certainly had considerable claims to be regarded as first-class and from that standing, I cannot, all things considered, agree after such a long lapse of time to reduce it. Outside the merits of the case, is there not something rather grotesque in the idea of a controlling body sitting in solemn conclave over so small a matter and deciding to upset what had been accepted for twenty years? ...|$|E

60|$|He judged it more {{prudent to}} confront than to flee from these considerations; looking the more hardily {{in the dead}} face, bending his mind to realise the nature and greatness of his crime. So <b>little</b> a <b>while</b> <b>ago</b> that face had moved with every change of sentiment, that pale mouth had spoken, that body had been all on fire with governable energies; and now, and by his act, that piece of life had been arrested, as the horologist, with interjected finger, arrests the beating of the clock. So he {{reasoned}} in vain; he could rise to no more remorseful consciousness; the same heart which had shuddered before the painted effigies of crime looked on its reality unmoved. At best, he felt a gleam of pity for one who had been endowed in vain with all those faculties that can {{make the world a}} garden of enchantment, one who had never lived and who was now dead. But of penitence, no, not a tremor.|$|R
