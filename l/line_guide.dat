40|$|This {{research}} {{was designed to}} address important issues for the effective prescription of, and training in the use of, magnifiers for reading patients with visual impairment. The emphasis was {{on the development of}} simple methods of assessment and training that could be easily implemented, at no great cost, by low vision practitioners in clinical practice. To ensure that the results would be widely applicable, the research focused on subjects with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) using stand magnifiers (being {{the most common cause of}} low vision and the most commonly prescribed magnifiers respectively). From this research, modifications to the current methods of reading rehabilitation are suggested to more effectively improve low vision reading for the millions of people with low vision around the world. The magnification and reading performance achieved with the magnifier determined by the fixed acuity reserve method was as valid as that achieved with the magnifier determined by the individual acuity reserve method. The fixed acuity reserve is a simpler method to calculate the required magnification, as it requires only near visual acuity and the patient's goal reading task. This method was primarily used to select the appropriate illuminated stand magnifiers for the subjects participating in the subsequent studies and is recommended for use as the starting point in clinical low vision practice. The main study of this thesis was a longitudinal investigation of the benefit of large print reading practice on reading performance with stand magnifiers. Instead of the intensive training programs on magnifier use which have been suggested by previous studies, this study aimed to investigate the effect of simple large print reading practice, under either full or restricted field of view (the latter simulated by a practice stand), on reading rate with stand magnifiers for subjects with AMD. The experimental hypothesis was that reading practice prior to the prescription of stand magnifiers would improve reading performance with the stand magnifiers for subjects with AMD. As previous studies have shown, reading rate reduced when a stand magnifier was first introduced. One week of reading practice on large print, with or without a reduced field of view, gave an improvement in reading rate with the stand magnifier for passages of text (such that the reading rates with and without magnifiers were not significantly different). There was a suggestion that this practice may give a more rapid improvement in reading rate than that achieved by the control subjects who did not do any large print reading practice, but this did not reach statistical significance. Even very brief reading with the stand magnifiers by the control subjects gave some improvement in reading rate. Therefore, home or in-office reading practice on large print or with magnifiers is recommended for patients with AMD before magnifiers are prescribed. Subjects who had neither reading practice nor exposure to the magnifier prior to its prescription required two weeks practice using their stand magnifiers to achieve their maximum reading rate. This suggests that home practice in using stand magnifiers is beneficial and a follow up visit is recommended two weeks after the provision of a magnifier to assess any change in reading rate. If no improvement in the magnifier reading rate is found or the rate is less than the reading rate on large print without a magnifier, further investigations of the patients' vision and/or their magnifier manipulation strategy are necessary. In the last study, a simple method aimed at alleviating difficulties with magnifier manipulation and navigation, the attachment of a <b>line</b> <b>guide</b> to the base of the stand magnifier, was investigated using both objective methods (recording magnifier movements and reading rate measures) and subjective methods (simple questionnaire). Although there was no improvement in the objective measures of reading or navigation performance with the <b>line</b> <b>guide,</b> more than half of the subjects with low vision preferred to have the <b>line</b> <b>guide</b> on their stand magnifiers. This suggests that the objective measures might not be sensitive enough to predict the subjective response, or that other factors that were not measured in this study influenced subjects' preferences in selecting the <b>line</b> <b>guide</b> (e. g., psychological support provided by the <b>line</b> <b>guide</b> in reading orientation). Clinically, the subjective response of patients to the use of low vision aids as well as their motivation are important criteria for success in low vision rehabilitation. There was a tendency for less experienced users to prefer the <b>line</b> <b>guide</b> to assist their use of the stand magnifier for reading. Therefore, a <b>line</b> <b>guide</b> could be offered as a preliminary training aid when stand magnifiers are first prescribed for AMD patients. Possible improvements to the design of the <b>line</b> <b>guide</b> were identified. Further research is required to assess the benefits of this or similar devices for new magnifier users and to understand the difficulties that people with visual impairment have with page navigation in order to determine improved methods of training navigation strategies. The unique contribution of this study to the field of low vision rehabilitation is that the benefit of short-term reading practice, on large print or with magnifiers, as simple, cheap methods of enhancing reading performance with stand magnifiers was demonstrated. The results of this study have led to the development of recommendations for assessing and training AMD patients who are prescribed stand magnifiers...|$|E

40|$|Em 2006, durante as eleições para o Congresso americano, o YouTube e outras redes sociais registraram os primeiros sinais de ciberativismo político organizado por políticos e eleitores no âmbito da Internet. Em 2008, esse movimento se intensificou com a experiência de Barack Obama e a política passou a integrar amplamente a esfera das novas mídias digitais, com o aumento da interatividade nos processos de comunicação política via Web. Nesse contexto, o presente trabalho investiga, de um lado, como a sociedade {{americana}} utilizou o Youtube durante as eleições de 2008, e de outro, como se estruturou a chamada campanha on-line do então candidato Obama. Por meio da análise do discurso de campanha de Obama e de cinco vídeos postados por eleitores no Youtube durante o período eleitoral, este estudo busca explicações para o fenômeno que ficou conhecido como a primeira campanha em rede de toda história.

40|$|Based on {{experience}} from practical work in school science, it is argued, that practical work {{has to be}} realised in a problem based learning framework including reflections on the selective focussing on the curriculum subject. Experience from library courses for non-specialised undergraduates show {{on the one hand}} that students get higher scores and lower drop out rates, but on the other hand, that {{less than half of the}} students are able to carry out a basic subject search. This paradox has until now no solutions and is not reflected in many information literacy campaigns. The development of a 10 hours problem based information literacy course for science undergraduates at Roskilde University Centre is described in terms of exemplarity, project work, and the relation to faculty. Methods, experiences, and materials are described by examples and an on <b>line</b> <b>guide</b> to information retrieval and information literacy is copied in an appendix. To evaluate this development, we made an extensive test of the students basic information retrieval skills during the year 1999 / 2000, where the students were offered 1 ½ hours library introduction - including basic information retrieval - in autumn. After the instruction they were all asked to answer two questions on basic information retrieval. In spring 2000 we offered these students a 10 hours information literacy course still including – among others - basic information retrieval. The science students joined a problem based learning approach, the students from the social sciences and the humanities were offered a more traditional approach based on lectures on bibliographic tools and exercises. We made a pre- and a post-test of basic information retrieval skills with exactly the same type of questions as they had ½ a year before. 742 undergraduates at Roskilde University Centre in Denmark joined a library introduction at 1 ½ hours including basic information retrieval in autumn 1999. 493 or 66 % of the students answered the questionnaire. 73 science students and 441 students from the social sciences and the humanities started the spring course. 70 science students answered the pre-test and a test sample at 94 from the social sciences and the humanities answered the pre-test. 52 science students and 276 students from the social sciences and the humanities finished the spring course. 33 science students answered the post-test and a test sample at 45 from the social sciences and the humanities answered the post-test. We found no significant differences between the science students, exposed to the PBL-approach, and students from the social sciences and the humanities exposed to a more traditional pedagogical method. More than 80 % of the students were – relatively constant through the period - able to find a book in the library catalogue from author and title. But too few students learned to make a subject search in the library catalogue, using the subject classification – and they even forgot it! After the library introduction in autumn 1999 only 50 % were able to make an extremely simple subject search. ½ a year later in spring 2000 this has dropped to 30 % just before the 10 hours course to raise again to 50 % after 10 hours instruction. Finally we found, whereas all teachers were able to teach how to find a known book in the library catalogue, only 2 out of 10 teachers were able to teach subject search during the 1 ½ hours library introduction. The ‘best’ teacher learned 3 times as many students subject search as the ‘worst’ teacher. An interpretation is, that these results stress the pedagogical skills of ‘the teaching libraries’ to be raised dramatically - not only by offering librarians in-service training, but also by introducing a heavy pedagogical structure in the library organisation like the library of Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, and by allocating resources for exchange and development of experience and expertise...|$|E
