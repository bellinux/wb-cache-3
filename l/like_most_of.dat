5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> {{the species}} of the order Phallales, Clathrus ruber is saprobic—a {{decomposer}} of wood and plant organic matter—and is commonly found fruiting in mulch beds. The fungus grows alone or clustered together near woody debris, in lawns, gardens, and cultivated soil.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota's winters are {{the setting}} of several {{television}} programs and Hollywood films, including the 1996 film Fargo which features the backdrop of a Minnesota winter, but <b>like</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> {{the characters in the}} movie, the climate is portrayed as bleak and inhospitable.|$|E

5|$|As {{with all}} of his Brushstrokes works, it is in part a satirical {{response}} to the gestural painting of Abstract Expressionism. <b>Like</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> Lichtenstein's Ben-Day dots works it is a depiction of mechanical reproduction via painterly technique. In this case, the satire comes from the depiction of the graphical depiction of the spontaneous painting motion in painstaking painterly detail.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 7th centuryBC, the Iron-Age Etruscan civilization (Latin: Etrusci) was dominant in the region. <b>Like</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the other peoples in the region, the Romans warred against the Etruscans. By the close of the century, the Romans had lost their struggle for independence, and the Etruscans had conquered Rome, establishing a military dictatorship, or kingdom, in the city.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Switzerland's {{population}} slightly exceeded eight million. In {{common with}} other developed countries, the Swiss population increased rapidly during the industrial era, quadrupling between 1800 and 1990. Growth has since stabilised, and <b>like</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> Europe, Switzerland faces an ageing population, albeit with consistent annual growth projected into 2035, due mostly to immigration and a fertility rate close to replacement level.|$|E

Route 2 operates every 30 minutes until 6pm and hourly from 6pm to 11 pm. On weekends and public holidays, route 932 provides an hourly service along the same streets as route 2.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> Saturn's larger satellites, Enceladus rotates {{synchronously}} {{with its}} orbital period, keeping one face pointed toward Saturn. Unlike Earth's Moon, Enceladus {{does not appear}} to librate more than 1.5° about its spin axis. However, analysis of the shape of Enceladus suggests that at some point it was in a 1:4 forced secondary spin–orbit libration. This libration could have provided Enceladus with an additional heat source.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> South Korea's smaller cities, Gyeongju {{has seen}} a steady drop in {{population}} in recent years. From 2002 to 2008, the city lost 16,557 people. This is primarily due to the migration of workers seeking employment in the major South Korean cities. In 2007, about 1,975 more people {{moved away from the}} city each year than moved in. During the same period, births exceeded deaths by roughly 450 per year, a significant number but not enough to offset the losses due to migration.|$|E

5|$|The best-known {{figure in}} the {{movement}} was Grégoire Kayibanda. <b>Like</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the Hutu counter-elite Kayibanda had trained for the priesthood at the Nyakibanda seminary, although he was not ordained. After completing his education in 1948, he became a primary-school teacher. In 1952 Kayibanda succeeded Alexis Kagame {{as editor of the}} Catholic magazine, L'Ami. During the late 1950s he was a Travail, Fidélité, Progrès (TRAFIPRO) food-cooperative board member, edited the pro-Hutu Catholic magazine Kinyamateka, and founded the Mouvement Social Muhutu (MSM).|$|E
5|$|Their fur is {{darker than}} other spaniels {{and they have}} no {{undercoat}} <b>like</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the other field type spaniels. Their coats come mostly in solid colours with some occasional markings on the chest. They can make good family dogs and are patient with children, but can require some sort of purpose, be it hunting or agility work in order to prevent them from becoming bored and destructive.|$|E
5|$|This nuthatch, <b>like</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> its genus, is non-migratory, and {{the adults}} {{normally}} {{stay in their}} territory year-round. There may be more noticeable dispersal due to seed failure or high reproductive success in some years, and this species has occurred as a vagrant to Vancouver Island, Santa Cruz Island, and Bermuda. One bird landed on the RMS Queen Mary six hours sailing east of New York City in October 1963.|$|E

5|$|Wulfhelm {{also went}} to Rome to receive his pallium in person from Pope John X. Why he chose to go to Rome in person for his pallium rather than having it sent to him <b>like</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> his {{predecessors}} is unknown. One suggestion has been that {{because he had been}} translated from another see, Wulfhelm felt the need to have papal approval of his translation made explicit. Given the low status of the papacy at the time, {{it is unlikely that the}} impetus for the change in tradition came from the pope.|$|E
5|$|Blakeney Point, <b>like</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the {{northern}} part of the marshes in this area, is part of the parish of Cley next the Sea. The main spit runs roughly west to east, and joins the mainland at Cley Beach before continuing onwards as a coastal ridge to Weybourne. It is approximately 6.4km (4mi) long, and is composed of a shingle bank which in places is 20m (65ft) in width and up to 10m (33feet) high. It has been estimated that there are 2.3millionm3 (82millionft3) of shingle in the spit, 97per cent of which is derived from flint.|$|E
5|$|During the 2008 United States presidential election, <b>like</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the New York State Democratic establishment, Brown was a {{supporter}} of Hillary Clinton, the United States Senator from New York. This marked a break from his earlier political organization, Grassroots, which supported Barack Obama from the outset. He even ran to be a delegate for Clinton at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. In July 2008, Golisano {{announced that he would}} attempt to create change in Albany by spending $5million on targeted campaigns. During the New York state September primary elections for state office, The New York Times alleged that Brown was aiding Golisano's attempt to unseat Sam Hoyt in the New York State Assembly.|$|E

5|$|For {{financial}} and scripting reasons the last book {{was divided into}} two films, shot back to back, which drew criticism from the series' fanbase. Radcliffe defended the split, stating {{that it would have}} been impossible to properly adapt the final novel into a single film. He added that the last movie was going to be extremely fast-paced with a lot of action, while the first part would be far more sedate, focusing on character development; he added that, had they combined them, those things would not have made it to the final cut. Filming lasted for a year, concluding in June 2010 and on the last day of shooting, <b>like</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the cast and crew, Radcliffe openly wept.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, Scottish people, <b>like</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> Catholic Europe, were {{increasingly}} concerned with prayers for the dead, necessary to speed passage from Purgatory to Heaven. The upper nobility {{began to turn}} from patronage for monasteries to the establishing collegiate churches to pray for them, such as Lord Dummond's foundation at Innerpeffray in 1508 and Lord Fleming's re-establishment at Biggar in 1546. Those lower down in society paid for shrines, priests and masses, leading to a proliferation of altars, clergy and services within existing churches. In the burghs the primary function of craft guilds was {{to pay for the}} funerals and masses of their members. By the early sixteenth century St. Mary's in Dundee had perhaps 48 altars and St Giles' in Edinburgh over 50.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> India, {{agriculture}} {{is one of}} the most significant sectors of the economy of Uttarakhand. Basmati rice, wheat, soybeans, groundnuts, coarse cereals, pulses, and oil seeds are the most widely grown crops. Fruits like apples, oranges, pears, peaches, litchis, and plums are widely grown and important to the large food processing industry. Agricultural export zones have been set up in the state for leechi, horticulture, herbs, medicinal plants, and basmati rice. During 2010, wheat production was 831 thousand tonnes and rice production was 610 thousand tonnes, while the main cash crop of the state, sugarcane, had a production of 5058 thousand tonnes. As 86% of the state consists of hills, the yield per hectare is not very high. 86% of all croplands are in the plains while the remaining is from the hills.|$|E
