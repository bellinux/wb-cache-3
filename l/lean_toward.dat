25|$|Each Singaporean's {{behaviours}} {{and attitudes}} are influenced by, among other things, {{his or her}} home language and his religion. Singaporeans who speak English as their native language tend to <b>lean</b> <b>toward</b> Western culture, while those who speak Chinese as their native language tend to <b>lean</b> <b>toward</b> Chinese culture and Confucianism.

25|$|The figurine was cleaned {{after the}} discovery, thus all organic traces {{which could have}} been dated with {{conventional}} methods were destroyed. For this reason, any dating was controversial since the beginning and can only be done by comparisons with other figurines. Thanks to these comparisons, it is now generally assumed that the Venus of Savignano belongs to the Gravettian culture and that it can be roughly dated back to 25,000–20,000 BP, although some sources tend to <b>lean</b> <b>toward</b> an earlier dating, up to c. 28,000 BP, and some sources favor a much later dating.|$|E
25|$|A picornavirus-like causes {{sacbrood}} disease. Affected larvae {{change from}} pearly white to gray and finally black. Death {{occurs when the}} larvae are upright, just before pupation. Consequently, affected larvae are usually found in capped cells. Head development of diseased larvae is typically retarded. The head region is usually darker {{than the rest of}} the body and may <b>lean</b> <b>toward</b> the center of the cell. When affected larvae are carefully removed from their cells, they appear to be a sac filled with water. Typically, the scales are brittle but easy to remove. Sacbrood-diseased larvae have no characteristic odor.|$|E

25|$|Platformers went {{portable}} in {{the late}} 1980s with games such as Super Mario Land, and the genre continued to maintain its popularity, with many titles released for the handheld Game Boy and Game Gear systems. Because of their small size, technical constraints, and blurring associated with early LCD technology, fast-paced action-based platformers {{are more difficult to}} develop for these handheld systems. Because of this, many handheld platformers <b>lean</b> <b>toward</b> slower-paced play styles and a greater emphasis on puzzles. After the transition of home consoles to three-dimensional (3D) displays, handhelds became a bastion for 2D platform games, where they remain popular. New Super Mario Bros. (2006) is a very successful traditional platform game, selling more than five million copies in Japan and North America during its first year of release.|$|E
500|$|The {{instrumental}} demos {{were primarily}} written in majorchords, which Byrne considered slightly [...] "ominous" [...] and surprising from Eno. In spite of this, Byrne's lyrics {{ended up being}} hopeful and spiritual, with themes of redemption—what he considers [...] "optimism {{in spite of the}} dread." [...] The tension between optimism and pessimism and the spiritual themes quickly emerged {{over the course of a}} year in which Byrne was writing lyrics, which he has speculated might be an antidote to being [...] "completely pessimistic and cynical about politics and the state of the world;" [...] for instance, [...] "TheRiver" [...] is about the effects of HurricaneKatrina. He has also cited the political climate of the IraqWar, the beginning of the late-2000s recession, the policies of the GeorgeW.Bush administration, and his 2004 divorce from AdelleLutz as factors that inspired him to create uplifting music. As he explained, [...] "I was surprised that's what came out... The tracks are very different from what I would have done myself. I <b>lean</b> <b>toward</b> things that are more complicated." [...] Eno also thinks the album is much better than the songs he imagined when composing them solo.|$|E
500|$|The {{third season}} of the show {{saw some of the}} biggest changes; in {{addition}} to Richie's superhero powers and a new opening, Static changed his costume. Cowan stated that the change was done to give his clothes a [...] "feel of the comic book", while McDuffie said it represented a growth that Virgil was passing through. This maturation made possible to [...] "explore some of the darker places in his world," [...] to have more varied conflicts, as the villains have also become more mature. He described it is as [...] "a natural outgrowth of all that, as is the new, more naturalistic look of the show." [...] This change was followed by the second season premiere—"The Big Leagues"—when Static meets Batman and Robin. Burnett said, [...] "after that show, everybody went, 'Let's go in that direction.'" [...] Writer John Semper, Jr. commented, [...] "of course, I always <b>lean</b> <b>toward</b> the dramatic ... But the same old light-hearted Static spirit is still there." [...] Richie gains superhero powers because it was becoming hard to fit him into the story and the producers wanted to keep the [...] "chemistry" [...] between voice actors LaMarr and Marsden. There was also a positive response from children in focus groups so [...] "he answer seemed pretty obvious." ...|$|E

After {{developing}} {{a crush on}} Grace, Tony asked her to jam when he was between bands, and the [...] "punkgrass" [...] sound that evolved was a natural fusion of their music backgrounds: playing punk rock tunes on acoustic instruments such as guitar, banjo, mandolin, and ukulele.

500|$|In Swedish folk music, {{songs are}} monophonic, unemotional, and solemn in character, though working and festive songs {{might be more}} lively and rhythmic. Danish songs melodies tend to <b>lean</b> <b>toward</b> the major. In Icelandic folk music, the rímur, a form of epic poem {{dating back to the}} medieval era and Viking Age, is prominent. Faroese music {{contains}} dances directly descended from medieval ballad and epic poems, particularly from literature in the Icelandic tradition, and often follows unusual time signatures. Many Norwegian folk ballads follow a four-stanza structure known as stev. Stev alternate a trochaic tetrameter with a trimeter, and lines typically rhyme following an ABCB scheme, though stev are not standardized. Finnish folk music tends to be based on Karelian traditions and the meter and thematic material found in the Kalevala. These themes include magic, mysticism, shamanism, Viking sea voyages, Christian legends, and ballads and dance songs. The older runo song tradition follows meters such as , , or [...] Under Swedish and German influence, a newer, round-dance tradition based on the runo emerged – the rekilaulu – and these usually follow a [...] or [...] time. Sami music traditions (music from the Sami people throughout Fennoscandia) historically were rather insular, exerting little influence on the music surrounding cultures. Sami music is known for joiking, improvised singing particular to the performer. These songs are often sung accompanied by a drum.|$|E
500|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety said, [...] "what seemed, in theory, the least-necessary {{revival of}} a big screen superhero emerges as {{perfectly}} solid summer action fare in The Incredible Hulk." [...] He emphasized [...] "it's all par-for-the-course cinematic demolition and destruction, staged efficiently and {{with a hint of}} enthusiasm," [...] and [...] "penned with sporadic wit [...] Visuals <b>lean</b> <b>toward</b> the dark and murky, but editing by three—actually six—hands is fleet, and Craig Armstrong's ever-present score is simultaneously bombastic and helpfully supportive of the action. Effects are in line with pic's generally pro but not inspired achievements." [...] Rene Rodriguez of The Miami Herald applauded that the film [...] "does a lot of things [...] Lee's Hulk didn't: It's lighter and faster-paced, it's funnier and it embraces (instead of ignoring) the 1970s TV series that furthered the character's popularity". Mark Rahner of The Seattle Times wrote that, [...] "The relaunch of Marvel's green goliath is an improvement over director Ang Lee's ponderous 2003 Hulk in nearly every way – except that the actual Hulk still looks scarcely better than something from a video game, and he still barely talks". Lou Lumenick of the New York Post said, [...] "What lingers in my memory ... is the lengthy, essentially animated climactic battle between the Hulk and the Abomination on the streets and rooftops of Harlem, and an earlier showdown between the title creature and the U.S. Army, which is deploying high-tech weapons including sound-wave cannons. These are expertly staged by director Louis Leterrier, who disposes of the backstory under the opening credits and wraps up the whole thing in twenty-four minutes less than [...] Lee took". Roger Ebert was not a fan of the film stating, [...] "The Incredible Hulk is no doubt an ideal version of the Hulk saga for those who found Ang Lee's Hulk too talky, or dare I say, too thoughtful. But not for me. It sidesteps the intriguing aspects of Hulkdom and spends way too much time in, dare I say, noisy and mindless action sequences." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Episcopal Church {{follows the}} via media or [...] "middle way" [...] between Protestant and Roman Catholic {{doctrine}} and practices: {{that is both}} Catholic and Reformed.

2500|$|This {{division}} {{does not}} just break down along Jewish v. Christian lines (as the previous difference did). [...] In general, {{those that are}} more likely to [...] <b>lean</b> <b>toward</b> the [...] "already view", or salvific knowledge view, are those Christians that do not believe in the indivisible Church (the indivisible Church is a belief of Catholics and Orthodox) and Christians that practice believer's baptism, because both believe the New Covenant is more present reality than future reality. [...] Also in general, those that <b>lean</b> <b>toward</b> the [...] "not yet view", or complete knowledge view, practice infant baptism for covenantal reasons, and dispensationalistic Christians (even though they tend to practice believer's baptism), because they believe the New Covenant is more future reality than present reality.|$|E
