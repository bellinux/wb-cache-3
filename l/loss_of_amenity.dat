50|$|Although {{monetary}} compensation {{cannot be}} directly equated with physical deprivation {{it is generally}} accepted that compensation should also be awarded for <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>amenities,</b> reflecting the decrease in expected standard of living due to any injury suffered and pain and suffering.

It would be contrary to ‘common sense’ and unreasonable. So we must look to ‘the loss truly suffered by the promisee’.|$|E

50|$|In Heil v.

Lewis and others have long argued that a no-fault approach to compensation would be more appropriate. The Heil case simply reinforces the tort system for the award of damages (in January 1996 the Law Commission had published a Consultation Paper (No. 140) Damages for Personal Injury: Non-Pecuniary Loss, followed by Commission Report No. 257).|$|E

50|$|The Southport to Liverpool line {{also had}} a through service to London Euston on weekdays, when a steam hauled train, {{generally}} {{of two or three}} carriages, would call at selected stations on the line including Blundellsands & Crosby and Waterloo. The train would leave the line after Bootle Oriel Road, to take the line round the city to join the main line into Lime Street. The through coaches were discontinued in 1966 when the Liverpool Lime Street to London Euston line converted to electric powered locomotives from steam power. To compensate for this <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>amenity,</b> British Rail introduced a diesel multiple unit service between Southport Chapel Street and Liverpool Lime Street. Generally five trains a day ran on weekdays. This service operated until Liverpool Exchange Station closed in 1977, when the trains from Southport were diverted, proceeding under the city to Liverpool Central Low Level.|$|E
50|$|On 21 September 1951 {{he was one}} of 35 people {{injured by}} the Weedon rail crash, the {{derailment}} of a passenger train on the West Coast Main Line near to Weedon Bec which killed 15 people. He was partially handicapped as a result and was awarded £47,720 damages by Mr Justice Pearce in the Queen's Bench Division in a judgment delivered on 1 April 1954, comprising £37,720 for loss of earnings, £9,000 for pain, suffering and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>amenity,</b> and £1,000 for out-of-pocket expenses. The damages awarded for loss of earnings were not subject to tax, but the amount awarded did not take account {{of the fact that the}} net earnings retained by Gourley - if he had not been injured - would have been reduced substantially by tax. An appeal against the damages was dismissed by the Court of Appeal, but the House of Lords reduced the damages for loss of earnings to £6,695, to take account of the hypothetical income tax and surtax that would have been due on the actual earnings, setting a legal precedent known as the Gourley principle that remains important in English law.|$|E

5000|$|The {{evidence}} shows that CAFOs may be contributing to the drop in nearby property values. There are many reasons for the decrease in property values, such as <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>amenities,</b> potential risk <b>of</b> water contamination, odors, air pollution, and other health related issues. One study shows that property values on average decrease by 6.6% within a 3 mi radius of a CAFO and by 88% within 1/10 of a mile from a CAFO. Proponents of CAFOs, including those in farm industry, respond by arguing that the negative externalities of CAFOs are limited. One executive in the pork industry, for instance, claims that any odor or noise from CAFOs is limited to an area within a quarter-mile of the facility. [...] Proponents also point to the positive effect they believe CAFOs have on the local economy and tax base. CAFOs buy feed from and provide fertilizer to local farmers. And the same executive claims that farmers near CAFOs can save $20 per acre by using waste from CAFOs as a fertilizer.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} of citizens living {{in the area of}} the investment is the bad air quality of Silesia region and Rybnik city in particular. On 21 November 2011 European Commission has sued Poland to the European Court of Justice for lack of progress in transposition of the Ambient Air Quality and Cleaner Air for Europe (CAFE) Directive (2008/50/EC), which should have been implemented in Poland by 11 June 2010. The directive requires in particular that the PM10 (larger dust particles) level does not exceed 50 miligrams/m³ more than 35 times a year. However this PM10 level is breached with much higher frequency in most Polish metropolitan areas including Rybnik and Jaworzno in the Silesia region. Recently a group of residents of Rybnik have taken the Polish state to court over the bad air quality and the lack of clear plans to improve the situation in the perceivable future. The local health effects from coal mining, transportation and combustion are also of a significant concern, and communities living in a proximity to these activities are experiencing adverse social effects, such as <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>amenity,</b> displacement, and loss of social capital as well as facing increased risks of respiratory disease, heart disease, and lung cancer.|$|E
50|$|From 1860, {{the railway}} {{operating}} companies desired to extend services from London Bridge Station into new stations at Cannon Street and Blackfriars in the City and {{link to the}} West End at Charing Cross Station. This required a viaduct, but legally, it was impossible by the 1756 Borough Market Act for the Trustees to alienate their property. The compromise was that only a flying leasehold {{was given to the}} railway company for the permanent way, but only for as long as a railway operates on it. The Market continues to trade underneath the arches of the viaduct. Each time there is a railway expansion requiring widening of the viaduct, the Trustees receive a full compensation payment. The last major such expansion was the 1901 extended bridge widening; the 21st-century works programme will also make its contribution. These windfalls have assisted in the finances of the market without any <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>amenity</b> to it. A new viaduct was erected above the market and a bridge across Borough High Street completed in 2014. As part of the Thameslink Programme, a large number of listed buildings in the Borough Market area have been altered or demolished, affecting the historic fabric of the area. This includes parts of the market itself and much of the area appearing in the aforementioned films. This was unpopular locally and became a contentious issue in the resulting public inquiry, which resulted in delays to the project. Eventually, the inquiry inspector was satisfied with the plans to restore as much of the market and surrounding area as possible. The overriding need to remove a major bottleneck in the national rail network and improve transport options over a large portion of London meant that he accepted that some damage to the fabric of the market and surrounding area was unavoidable in order for the scheme to achieve its objectives. Disruption to the market activities was kept to a minimum.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the centuries}} before 1909, {{the law of}} {{planning}} how land would be used was largely confined {{to the law of}} nuisance, and agreements to between neighbours for easements and covenants. This was not always true, because from the Magna Carta 1215, and the subsequent development of the Charter of the Forest ("forest" [...] being an old term for crown land) there was a significant body of law regarding the use of the commons: the public land that common folk could use for gathering food, wood, hunting, or herding. Statutes and case law regulated the types of activity the people could perform, {{and the extent to which}} they could use common property. But gradually over the 15th century and 16th century, the aristocracy began the enclosure movement, in effect privatising almost all property that had been common. The public law of land had passed into insignificance, it was common to hear the 19th century judiciary proclaim the importance of private rights, with barely detectable minimum of responsibility. For example, in 1865 in Taplin v Jones, Lord Cranworth proclaimed that every [...] "man... has a right to use his own land by building on it as he thinks most to his interest". Claimants could sue for a public or private nuisance from neighbours, but the case based definition of what counted as a nuisance was usually unfavourable to ordinary people. For example, there could be no objection for <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>amenity</b> if a loud railway was run past one's house. In Sturges v Bridgman the Court of Appeal held that what counted as a nuisance would depend on the character of the locality, and this meant that 'what would be a nuisance in Belgrave Square would not necessarily be so in Bermondsey'. Inadvertently this meant that the rich, like those in Belgrave Square might be protected, while the poor, in places like Bermondsey, had little control over their local environments. For this reason it was thought that democratically elected local councils ought to be given the power to determine how the land around them would be used. In modern jurisprudence, it has become a basic principle that property does carry social responsibility, and that the extent of property rights that are recognised in law must be 'considered in relation to their social function'. The first major Act in the UK, the Housing, Town Planning etc Act 1909, recognised this by giving local governments the authority to develop planning schemes, and employ inspectors, with appeal to a Local Government Board, initially regarding sanitary conditions. The Town and Country Planning Act 1947, however, made the most critical change, requiring that any development of land required permission from the local government, unless there was a relevant exception. Since then modern legislation has grown into a local, regional and national system of planning law. Together with rules on compulsory purchase, it is designed to ensure the use of property is determined by the people in society who are most affected.|$|E

Although the accidents rate {{has dropped from}} 350 per 1000 workers in mid 1980 to 60 per 1000 workers in 2007, it still accounted for nearly one-fifth of all the industrial accidents in Hong Kong. Contractors were economically pressed and battered by exorbitant compensation over the years. This paper presents a comprehensive study of non-fatal accidents compensation court cases from 2004 to 2008. Although approximately one-third of the cases with injured persons aged between 47 and 56, the percentage of court cases over construction employees by age group was highest in age group 17 - 26. In terms of trade of workers, General laborers/causal workers stood the highest, then came electrical technicians and painters/decorators/plasterers. The highest rates of injury were falling from height and hitting by falling objects. Increasing from HK$ 10, 997, 637 in 2004, the total compensation reached the peak of HK$ 39, 643, 353 in 2006. The heaviest compensation was HK$ 13, 800, 000 among 101 cases. Most {{of the victims were}} compensated under <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> earnings and Pain Suffering and <b>Loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>Amenities.</b> While general labourers marked the highest number of cases, less than one-fourth of them were awarded compensation which exceeded HK$ 1, 500, 000.
