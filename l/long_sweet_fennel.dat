40|$|Arid {{regions in}} Egypt are {{characterized}} by poor nutrients such as macro and microelements and unfavorable environmental conditions which negatively affect growth and productivity of medicinal and aromatic plants including anise (Pimpinella anisum L.), coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.) and <b>sweet</b> <b>fennel</b> (Foeniculum vulgare var. Dolce) plants. Thus, the main objective of the present investigation was to study the effect of different levels of NP fertilizers, trace elements and their interactions on the morphological and biochemical contents of these three plants under arid regions conditions. The effects of NP and trace elements on the growth (height, leaf number, branch number, umbel number, fresh weight, dry weight and fruit yield per plant) was measured and quantitative analysis of essential oils, fixed oil, total carbohydrates, soluble sugars and nutrient content of anise, coriander and <b>sweet</b> <b>fennel</b> were performed. The most effective rate was N 3 P 3 x trace elements interaction, resulting in a positive increase in vegetative growth characters. The highest values of vegetative growth characters were 53. 4, 45. 9, 10. 3, 33. 5, 36. 8, 11. 8 and 7. 9, respectively for anise; 83. 0, 69. 3, 9. 8, 29. 0, 34. 0, 17. 5 and 14. 4, respectively for coriander; 89. 8, 32. 6, 7. 8, 22. 9, 257. 8, 99. 1 and 27. 8, respectively for <b>sweet</b> <b>fennel.</b> As well as N 3 P 3 x trace elements led to higher biochemical contents than the control. The increases were 0. 9, 0. 3 and 0. 9 % in essential oil; 5. 4, 4. 4 and 3. 7 % in fixed oil, 9, 7. 9 and 8. 2 % in total carbohydrates; 2. 4, 2. 8 and 1. 6 % in soluble sugars; 5. 0, 7. 5 and 14. 4 % in crude protein; 0. 8, 2. 0 and 2. 3 % in nitrogen; 1. 5, 0. 6 and 0. 4 % in phosphorous; 1. 3, 1. 2 and 1. 7 % in potassium for anise, coriander and <b>sweet</b> <b>fennel,</b> respectively...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{research}} was aimed to determine relationships between seed yield and some yield components of 20 <b>sweet</b> <b>fennel</b> (Foeniculum vulgare Mill. var dulce) lines. The highest positive correlation (r= 0. 915) was recorded between biological yield and single plant yield. Plant height, number of branches, number of umbels and umbellets {{had a positive}} effect on single plant yield. One thousand seed weight was negatively correlated with essential oil percentage. The highest positive and direct effect on seed yield was shown by number of umbellets, while maximum negative and direct contribution to it was made by biological yield. In addition, single plant yield, plant height and one thousand seed weight affected seed yield positively. Single plant yield had maximum direct effect (32. 95 %) on essential oil percentage followed by plant height (24. 60 %) and number of branches (15. 11 %). In conclusion, it could be suggested that single plant yield, number of umbellets and plant height are good phenotypic selection criteria to improve seed yield and essential oil percentage of <b>sweet</b> <b>fennel...</b>|$|R

Results strongly showed that {{there were significant differences}} between <b>sweet</b> <b>fennel</b> cultivars. Generally the highest values of all parameters were obtained when fennel plants were supplemented with 50 % NPK+ 50 % organic fertilizer and bio fertilizer when compared with control treatment. The highest values of TPC, TFC and Vit. C were recorded by Zefa fino cultivar when received 50 % NPK+ 50 % organic treatment. The antioxidant activities of both cultivars were evaluated and Dolce cultivar showed the highest DPPH scavenging activity expressed as IC 50 compared with Zefa fino cultivar. In addition, Dolce cultivars exhibited the highest value for Fe 2 +-chelating activities for organic and bio-organic fertilizers followed by Zefa fino when compared to control treatment. Dolce cultivar generally showed superiority than Zefa fino in all measured parameters...|$|R

40|$|Studies {{show that}} Apiaceae may provide {{concentrated}} vital resources for predator insects,stimulating their abundance, diversity and persistence in agricultural systems, thereby increasing their effi ciency as biological control agents. Among the predatory insects, Coccinellidae (Coleoptera) on many different species both as larvae and adults, complementing their diet with pollen and/or nectar. This study aimed {{to determine the}} diversity and relative abundance of Coccinellidae species visiting plants of Anethum graveolens (dill), Coriandrum sativum (coriander) and Foeniculum vulgare (<b>sweet</b> <b>fennel)</b> (all Apiaceae), particularly in their blooming seasons, and to evaluate the potential of these aromatic species for providing the resources for survivorship and reproduction of coccinelids. Coccinellids were collected by removal of samplings from September to October, 2007. Besides one unidentifi ed species of Chilocorinae, five species of Coccinellinae were collected: Coleomegilla maculata DeGeer, Coleomegilla quadrifasciata (Schönherr), Cycloneda sanguinea (L.), Eriopis connexa (Germar) and Hippodamia convergens Guérin-Meneville. Dill provided a signifi cant increase in the abundance of coccinellids as compared to coriander and <b>sweet</b> <b>fennel.</b> These aromatic species were used by coccinellids as survival and reproduction sites, providing food resources (pollen and/or prey), shelter for larvae, pupae and adults, and mating and oviposition sites as well...|$|R

2500|$|Absinthe ( [...] or French: [...] ) is {{historically}} {{described as a}} distilled, highly alcoholic (45–74% ABV / 90–148 U.S. proof) beverage. It is an anise-flavoured spirit derived from botanicals, including the flowers and leaves of Artemisia absinthium ("grand wormwood"), together with green anise, <b>sweet</b> <b>fennel,</b> and other medicinal and culinary herbs. Absinthe traditionally has a natural green colour but may also be colourless. It is commonly referred to in historical literature as [...] "" [...] (the green fairy). Although it is sometimes mistakenly {{referred to as a}} liqueur, absinthe is not traditionally bottled with added sugar; it is therefore classified as a spirit. Absinthe is traditionally bottled at a high level of alcohol by volume, but it is normally diluted with water prior to being consumed.|$|R
50|$|Lucid is {{distilled}} {{entirely from}} all natural ingredients {{and is the}} first genuine absinthe distilled with real Grande Wormwood (Artemisia absinthium) available in the United States in more than 95 years. Lucid is made with historically accurate volumes of Grande Wormwood, {{as well as other}} botanicals, such as green anise and <b>sweet</b> <b>fennel</b> that are traditional to the spirit. The recipe was developed by T.A. Breaux, an absinthe expert and historian. Lucid’s green color is derived directly from the botanicals, without any artificial coloring added - a key feature of genuine absinthe. Lucid’s natural color requires a dark bottle because exposure to light will cause the natural color to fade, which explains why so many traditional absinthes were bottled in dark glass.|$|R

It has also nutritional values (Renna and Gonnella 2012). It belongs to the family Apiaceae (formerly the Umbelliferae) (Qiu et al. 2012). In Ethiopia, the plant is called Ensilal. It is native to Southern Europe and the Mediterranean region and is cultivated mainly in India, China, Guatemala, Sri Lanka, Greece, and many other countries in Europe and America (Parthasarathy et al. 2008; He and Huang 2011; Rather et al. 2012; Rahimi and Ardekani 2013; Chéry et al. 2008).

Here, we show that sub-bactericidal concentration of anet-hole, a component of <b>sweet</b> <b>fennel</b> seed, could suppress virulence potential in O 1 El Tor biotype strains of toxigenic Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of the ongoing 7 th cholera pandemic. The expression of cholera toxin (CT) and toxin coregulated pilus (TCP), the major virulence factors of V. cholerae, is controlled through a regulatory cascade involving activation of ToxT with synergistic coupling interaction of ToxR/ToxS with TcpP/TcpH. We present evidence that anethole inhibits in vitro expression of CT and TCP in a toxT-depen-dent but toxR/toxS-independent manner and through repression of tcpP/tcpH, by using bead-ELISA, western blotting and quantitative real-time RT-PCR assays. The cyclic AMP (cAMP) -cAMP receptor protein (CRP) is a well-studied global signaling system in bacterial pathogens, and this complex is known to suppress expression of tcpP/tcpH in V. cholerae.
