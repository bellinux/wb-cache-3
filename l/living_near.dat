5|$|Lead is {{a common}} {{environmental}} pollutant. Causes of environmental contamination include industrial use of lead, such as is found in facilities that process lead-acid batteries or produce lead wire or pipes, and metal recycling and foundries. Children <b>living</b> <b>near</b> facilities that process lead, such as lead smelters, {{have been found to}} have unusually high blood lead levels. In August 2009, parents rioted in China after lead poisoning was found in nearly 2000 children <b>living</b> <b>near</b> zinc and manganese smelters. Lead exposure can occur from contact with lead in air, household dust, soil, water, and commercial products. Leaded gasoline has also been linked to increases in lead pollution. Some research has suggested a link between leaded gasoline and crime rates. Man made lead pollution has been elevated in the air for the past 2000 years. Lead pollution in the air is entirely due to human activity (mining and smelting).|$|E

5|$|Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard is {{a poem by}} Thomas Gray, {{completed}} in 1750 and first published in 1751. The poem’s origins are unknown, but it was partly inspired by Gray’s thoughts {{following the death of}} the poet Richard West in 1742. Originally titled Stanzas Wrote in a Country Church-Yard, the poem was completed when Gray was <b>living</b> <b>near</b> St Giles' parish church at Stoke Poges. It was sent to his friend Horace Walpole, who popularised the poem among London literary circles. Gray was eventually forced to publish the work on 15 February 1751, to pre-empt a magazine publisher from printing an unlicensed copy of the poem.|$|E
5|$|Followers of Hinduism {{were also}} present {{to some extent}} during the Anuradhapura Kingdom. There {{were a number of}} them in Rajarata during Elara's reign.

By the end of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, large Hindu temples such as the Konesvaram temple had been constructed. Historical sources indicate that there were also Jains in Anuradhapura during the reign of Valagamba.|$|E

5|$|In 1956 Kim started Kim Ki-young Productions, {{and began}} making melodramas, {{the most popular}} film genre in South Korea at the time. His first {{independent}} production was Touch-Me-Not (1956). In 1957, Kim was <b>living</b> <b>near</b> the red-light district of Yongsan, and the atmosphere of this neighborhood influenced his films, A Woman's War and Twilight Train (both 1957). With First Snow (1958), Kim moved from melodrama to a more socially conscious realism. Defiance of a Teenager (1959) and Sad Pastorale (1960) followed in this style. Defiance of a Teenager was one of Kim's most successful and respected early works, and he attended the San Francisco International Film Festival in 1960 for a showing of this film.|$|E

Instead of serving as a full-time residence, Wright treated Taliesin like an art museum for his collection of Asian works.

Fearing significant loss of life and property, the Red Cross began preparations for the approaching hurricane in Belize. The following day, the Mexican Army rushed to set up emergency operation centers and shelters in five cities.
