5|$|Ale can be {{defeated}} by zmajeviti men, {{who have a}} human mother, but a dragon father. They look like ordinary people except for little wings beneath their armpits; such men are always born at night after a twelve-month term. Much like a zduhać, a zmajeviti man <b>lives</b> <b>like</b> everybody else {{when the weather is}} nice, but when an ala leads threatening clouds into sight, he falls into a trance and his spirit comes out of his body and flies up to the clouds to fight with the ala, just like a dragon would do. A story from Banat, which was held as true until the 1950s, says that before World War I, an exhausted ala {{in the form of a}} giant snake fell from the clouds onto a road. The explanation of the event was that the ala was defeated in her fight with a zmajeviti man; people gave her milk to help her recover.|$|E

Disability activists are working to break institutional, physical, and societal barriers that prevent people with disabilities from living their <b>lives</b> <b>like</b> other citizens.|$|E
25|$|The {{description}} of Nebuchadnezzar II in the Book of Daniel (2nd century BC) greatly influenced the medieval European concepts. Daniel 4 depicts God humbling the Babylonian king for his boastfulness; stricken mad and ejected from human society, he grows {{hair on his}} body and <b>lives</b> <b>like</b> a beast. This image was popular in medieval depictions of Nebuchadnezzar. Similarly, late medieval legends of Saint John Chrysostom (died 407) describe the saint's asceticism as making him so isolated and feral that hunters who capture him cannot tell if he is man or beast.|$|E

500|$|Crossing the Saruwaged Range {{proved to}} be a gruelling test of {{endurance}} for the Japanese soldiers. They started out with ten days' rations but this was exhausted {{by the time they reached}} Mount Salawaket. The 51st Division had already abandoned most of its heavy equipment; now, many soldiers threw away their rifles. [...] "The Sarawaged crossing", wrote Lieutenant General Kane Yoshihara, [...] "took far longer than had been expected, and its difficulties were beyond discussion. Near the mountain summits the cold was intense and sleep was quite impossible all the cold night; they could only doze beside the fire. Squalls came, the ice spread and they advanced through snow under this tropical sky. Gradually the road they were climbing became a descending slope, but the inclination was so steep that if they missed their footing they would fall thousands and thousands of feet— and how many men lost their <b>lives</b> <b>like</b> that!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Charlotte Napier [...] The modern-day {{protagonist of}} L'Engle's adult novel The Love Letters (1966), republished in 1996 as Love Letters, [...] ), is the {{daughter}} of writer James Clement and the daughter-in-law of Dame Violet Napier. After the death of her son Andrew and the hateful words of her husband, Patrick, Charlotte flees to Portugal where Violet <b>lives.</b> <b>Like</b> L'Engle, Charlotte lost a parent at an early age (Charlotte's mother, L'Engle's father) and subsequently was sent away from her remaining family to live abroad (Charlotte in a series of convents, L'Engle in a series of boarding schools). Also like L'Engle, Charlotte has a brief stage career as an actress. [...] A scene from Charlotte's life also appears in a play performed by actress Emma Wheaton in Certain Women (1992), which suggests that Charlotte's story may be outside the continuity of the L'Engle corpus.|$|E
2500|$|Once captured, the kidnapped {{victims were}} forced {{to fight to the}} death with other victims. Men were given knives, hammers and machetes and were ordered at gunpoint to fight for their <b>lives</b> <b>like</b> a [...] "gladiator-style contest." [...] The winners of the fights were ordered to go on suicide {{missions}} and shoot at rival drug cartel members in other towns and cities. Those who did not win the [...] "fight-to-the-death gladiator matches" [...] were buried in clandestine mass graves. The idea behind this tactic was to find new recruits willing to kill without mercy. Almost all the corpses found in the mass graves had evidence of [...] "blunt force trauma." [...] Juan, the alleged cartel member, confessed that the game is called [...] "Who {{is going to be the}} next hitman?" [...] Peter Hana, a retired FBI agent with years of experience in the development of the Mexican drug cartels, said the re-enactments of gladiator contests, where victims [...] "cut guys to pieces" [...] for the [...] "amusement" [...] of the drug lords, was something that people a few years ago would not even think possible, but that now is [...] "commonplace." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Moss, {{socioeconomic}} {{factors that}} affect impoverished populations such as education, income inequality, and occupation, represent the strongest and most consistent predictors of health and mortality. [...] The inequalities in the apparent circumstances of individual's <b>lives,</b> <b>like</b> individuals' access to health care, schools, their conditions of work and leisure, households, communities, towns, or cities, affect people's ability to lead a flourishing life and maintain health, according to the WHO. The inequitable distribution of health-harmful living conditions, experiences, and structures, is {{not by any means}} natural, [...] "but {{is the result of a}} toxic combination of poor social policies and programmes, unfair economic arrangements, and bad politics". Therefore, the conditions of individual's daily life are responsible for the social determinants of health and a major part of health inequities between and within countries. Along with these social conditions, [...] "Gender, education, occupation, income, ethnicity, and place of residence are all closely linked to people's access to, experiences of, and benefits from health care." [...] Social determinants of disease can be attributed to broad social forces such as racism, gender inequality, poverty, violence, and war. This is important because health quality, health distribution, and social protection of health in a population affect the development status of a nation. Since health has been considered a fundamental human right, one author suggests the social determinants of health determine the distribution of human dignity.|$|E
