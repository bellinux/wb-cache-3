Echo surrendered after a sharp engagement of 20 minutes duration. In the action, the Dutch lost three men killed and seven wounded; the British lost four men killed and three wounded.|$|E
25|$|The first pojama {{was built}} in 1764 (the same year as the larger version turumas and the {{earliest}} hemmema). It was a low-hulled vessel with two masts, a main and a mizzen, rigged like a bomb ketch with two square sails, a <b>lug</b> <b>sail,</b> and three staysails supported between the mainmast and the bowsprit. The first pojama was 23.8 m (78 ft) long, 5.5 m (18 ft) wide, with a draft of 1.8 m (6 ft). The three later pojamas built for the Swedish navy varied in size from 20 m (65.5 ft) up to 27.6 m (90.5 ft). Its main armament was two heavy guns in the bow and stern (ranging from 12-pounders up to 24-pounders). These could also be dragged towards {{the center of the}} vessel and aimed sideways, though with considerable effort. It also had up to 10 swivel guns along the railings for close-range defense. For maneuverability, it carried 14 pairs of oars which operated through oarpoarts attached to a rectangular outrigger which improved the leverage for the oarsmen.|$|E
2500|$|Munroe, however, was {{a talented}} boat {{designer}} {{who was able}} to work around the problems with the drawings. [...] His adaptations can be seen in successive proas. [...] Rather than the deep, asymmetric hull of a traditional proa, Munroe created flat-bottomed hulls (similar to the fisolera referred to by Pigafetta), with keels or centerboards for lateral resistance. [...] His first iteration had an iron center fin with a half-oval profile. [...] Rather than the traditional crab-claw sail's spars which meet at the front, Munroe's sails used what could be described as a triangular <b>lug</b> <b>sail</b> or spritsail with a boom, similar to the modern lateen sail with a shorter upper spar.|$|E

6000|$|... 'On Friday, at 8.30, I started, {{not quite}} knowing whither I should go, but soon saw that I could fetch round {{the south end}} of Vanua Lava, which was well. The sea, when it comes through the passage between Mota and Valua, is heavy, but the boat had great way on her, sailing very fast, so that I could steer her well, and we did not take very long {{crossing}} to the small reef islands. I passed between Pakea and Vanua Lava (Dudley Passage), and then we had unexpectedly a very heavy sea, a strong tide up. I did not like it, but, thank God, all went well. One very heavy sea in particular I noticed, which broke some twenty yards ahead, and about the same distance astern of us, while the exact part of it which came down upon us was only a black wall of water, over which we rode lightly and dry. I think that it might have swamped us had it broken upon the boat. My boat is an open four-oared one, 26 feet long, and about five wide, strong but light. She sails admirably with a common <b>lug</b> <b>sail.</b> I had one made last summer, very large, with two reefs, so that I can reduce it to as small a sail as I please. By 4 or 5 P.M. I neared Aruas, in the bay {{on the west side of}} Vanua Lava; the same crowd as usual on the beach, but I did not haul the boat up. I had a grapnel, and dropped it some fifty yards from the beach.|$|E

60|$|Ere Harry replied, {{a bright}} flash of {{lightning}} shot athwart the sky, followed by a loud roar of thunder, {{and in a moment}} the wind rushed, like a fiend set suddenly free, down upon the boats, tearing up the smooth surface of the water as it flew, and cutting it into gleaming white streaks. Fortunately the storm came down behind the boats, so that, after the first wild burst was over, they hoisted a small portion of their <b>lug</b> <b>sails,</b> and scudded rapidly before it.|$|R

The painting depicts several fishermen and fishwives in traditional dress - the men wearing sou'wester hats, rough jumpers, oilskin trousers, and heavy leather boots. The women wear heavy aprons known as a [...] "towser" [...] and woollen shawls. The work was probably painted on the beach near the old medieval harbour of Newlyn, shortly before the new south and north quays were constructed in 1885-6 and 1888-94, followed by a new covered fish market that opened in 1908.|$|R

25|$|On 5 October 1967 Dampier {{finally left}} Singapore {{to return to}} the UK, {{arriving}} at Simon's Town, South Africa, on 17 November. A week later, after local exercises, it was discovered that the ship's starboard propeller shaft was broken. The ship was obliged to continue her voyage on only one shaft. At Freetown, Sierra Leone, she found that there was no suitable equipment available to make repairs. With only three weeks remaining to make the 3,000 miles back to England in time for Christmas, the ship took the unusual step of manufacturing and hoisting a set of <b>sails.</b> Three <b>lug</b> <b>sails</b> made from awning canvas were hoisted on 11 December, and four days later a set of square sails. With the assistance of this rig, Dampier arrived at Chatham on 23 December to be greeted by Flag Officer Medway and the Hydrographer of the Navy.|$|R
5000|$|The Trabaccoló, Trabaccalo, Trabacalo or Trabakul in Croatian, {{is a type}} of Adriatic Sea sailing coaster. The {{name comes}} from the word trabacca, which means tent, which in turn recalls the vessel's sails. The trabaccoló was a typical Venetian boat-form that dates back to {{the first half of the}} 15th Century and that spread {{throughout}} the Adriatic. Built of oak and larch, trabaccolós were slow but reliable cargo vessels ranging between 50 and 200 deadweight tons. They had round bows and sterns, and were wide, compact, and with good stowage. Other characteristics included a large rudder that extended below the depth of the keel, two masts with <b>lug</b> <b>sails</b> and rigging, a bowsprit, and a carved and colorfully painted stern. The usual such vessel was about 20 metres long, with a breadth equal to about a third of the length. Typically a trabaccoló would have a crew of 10 to 20 sailors.|$|R
50|$|A lugger is a two-masted vessel, {{with for}} each mast a sail plan {{similar to a}} gaff rig. The lug sails it uses, however, do not have gaffs, that attach {{directly}} to its masts. Instead, the spars are allowed to move forward and aft of the mast and are managed {{through a series of}} lines that attach to the yards and to the corners of the sails. Each sail {{may or may not have}} a boom along its foot. In Scotland, when constructed with a main dipping <b>lug</b> <b>sail</b> and a mizzen standing <b>lug</b> <b>sail,</b> such vessels are known as fifies, sailing fifies, or herring drifters; they were often used for herring fishing.|$|E
50|$|The {{boat was}} fitted with two sliding or drop-keels and two water-ballast tanks. The {{lifeboat}} had two masts {{of which the}} fore-mast carried a dipping <b>lug</b> <b>sail</b> and the mizzen mast a standing <b>lug</b> <b>sail.</b> The boat had two drop keels and was fitted out with water ballast tanks. She pulled 16 oars which were double banked for heavy weather. Her Launching carriage was built by the Bristol Wagon & Carriage Works Company, which was delivered separately by rail to Sheringham. This carriage was constructed with larger front wheels installed {{with a series of}} flat metal plates around circumference of each wheel. Their purpose was to help prevent the boat sinking into areas of soft sand.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} sprit-boom is {{found on a}} sprit-boomed leg-of-mutton sail. Sprit booms have been {{combined}} with a leech spar called a club; they have been used on foresails, like the jib. Some sailors have used a sprit boom on the standing <b>lug</b> <b>sail.</b>|$|E
500|$|The South Georgia boat {{party could}} expect to meet hurricane-force winds and waves—the notorious Cape Horn Rollers—measuring from trough to crest as much as [...] Shackleton {{therefore}} selected the heaviest and strongest of the three boats, the [...] long James Caird. It had been built as a whaleboat in London to Worsley's orders, designed on the [...] "double-ended" [...] principle pioneered by Norwegian shipbuilder Colin Archer. Shackleton asked the expedition's carpenter, Harry McNish, if he could make the vessel more seaworthy. Using improvised tools and materials, McNish raised the boat's sides and built a makeshift deck of wood and canvas, sealing his work with oil paints, lamp wick, and seal blood. The craft was strengthened by having the mast of the Dudley Docker lashed inside, {{along the length of}} her keel. She was then fitted as a ketch, with a mainmast and a mizzenmast, rigged to carry <b>lug</b> <b>sails</b> and a jib. The weight of the boat was increased by the addition of approximately 1 long ton (1,016kg) of ballast, to lessen the risk of capsizing in the high seas that Shackleton knew they would encounter.|$|R
2500|$|One of {{the issues}} Western {{designers}} have with the proa {{is the need to}} manipulate the sail when shunting. Even Munroe's early sails discarded the curved yards of the traditional crabclaw for the more familiar straight yards of the lateen and <b>lug</b> <b>sails.</b> Munroe's designs likely lacked the tilting mast because he was unaware of it, but many designers since have use a fixed mast, and provided some other way of adjusting the center of effort. [...] Most sailboats are designed with the center of effort of the sails slightly ahead of the center of area of the underwater plane; this difference is called [...] "lead." [...] In a proa hull, and in all fore and aft symmetric foils, the center of resistance is not at or even {{near the center of the}} boat, it is well forward of the geometric center of area. Thus the center of effort of the sails needs to also be well forward, or at least needs to have a sail which is well forward which can be sheeted in to start the boat moving, allowing the rudders to bite and keep the boat from heading up when the entire sail area is sheeted in. [...] Jzero, for example, and all of Russell Brown's other designs, use a sloop rig and hoist a jib on whichever end is the current [...] "bow". Other designs use a schooner rig for the same effect.|$|R
5|$|The southward {{expansion}} of the Han dynasty led to new trade routes and diplomatic contact with foreign kingdoms. In 111 BCE, Emperor Wu conquered the Kingdom of Nanyue {{in what is now}} modern northern Vietnam and Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan; thereafter he opened up maritime trade to both Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean, as foreign merchants brought lapis lazuli, pearls, jade, and glasswares to the Han Empire from this southern sea route. When a group of travelers from the Roman Empire (allegedly diplomats of Marcus Aurelius but most likely Roman merchants) came to the Han court in 166 CE, they allegedly came from this southern trade route. By at least the 1st century CE— as proven by Eastern Han ceramic miniature models of ships found in various tombs— the Chinese {{would have been able to}} brave distant waters with the new steering invention of the stern-mounted rudder. This came to replace the less efficient steering oar. While ancient China was home to various ship designs, including the layered and fortified tower ship meant for calm waters of lakes and river, the junk design (jun 船) created by the 1st century CE was China's first seaworthy sailing ship. The typical junk has a square-ended bow and stern, a flat-bottomed hull or carvel-shaped hull with no keel or sternpost, and solid transverse bulkheads in the place of structural ribs found in Western seacrafts. Since the Chinese junk lacked a sternpost, the rudder was attached to the back of the ship by use of either socket-and-jaw or block and tackle (which differed from the later European pintle and gudgeon design of the 12th century). As written by a 3rd-century author, junks had for-and-aft rigs and <b>lug</b> <b>sails.</b>|$|R
