Scheduled tasks may include processes on the accounting server to extract validation information, transferring validation information to the LAN, updating a vendor’s validation tables on the cost recovery system (such as employee IDs, accounting codes and cost-types), transferring cost transactions from the LAN to the accounting server and processing cost transactions into the billing system. Transaction processes can then be automated to minimize administrative overhead and reduce delays updating transactions into the billing system.|$|R

40|$|Address {{information}} {{is essential for}} people’s daily life. People often need to query addresses of unfamiliar location through Web and then use map services to mark down the location for direction purpose. Although both address information and map services are available online, they are not well combined. Users usually need to copy <b>individual</b> <b>address</b> from a Web site and paste it to another Web site with map services to locate its direction. Such copy and paste operations have to be repeated if multiple addresses are listed on a single page such as public school list or apartment list. Furthermore, associated information with <b>individual</b> <b>address</b> has to be copied and included on each marker for better comprehension. Our research is devoted to automate the above process and make the combination an easier task for users. The main techniques applied here include postal address extraction and associated information extraction. We apply sequence labeling algorithm based on Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to train models for address extraction. Meanwhile, using the extracted addresses as landmarks, we apply pattern mining to identify the boundaries of address blocks and extract associated information with each <b>individual</b> <b>address.</b> The experimental result shows high F-score at 91 % for postal address extraction and 87 % accuracy for associated information extraction. 1...|$|R

50|$|Geocoding is interpolating spatial {{locations}} (X,Y coordinates) from street addresses or {{any other}} spatially referenced data such as ZIP Codes, parcel lots and address locations. A reference theme is required to geocode <b>individual</b> <b>addresses,</b> such as a road centerline file with <b>address</b> ranges. The <b>individual</b> <b>address</b> locations have historically been interpolated, or estimated, by examining address ranges along a road segment. These are usually provided {{in the form of}} a table or database. The software will then place a dot approximately where that address belongs along the segment of centerline. For example, an address point of 500 will be at the midpoint of a line segment that starts with address 1 and ends with address 1,000. Geocoding can also be applied against actual parcel data, typically from municipal tax maps. In this case, the result of the geocoding will be an actually positioned space as opposed to an interpolated point. This approach is being increasingly used to provide more precise location information.|$|R
