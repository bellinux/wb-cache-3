5|$|Ebert {{occasionally}} accused some {{films of}} having an unwholesome political agenda, such as claiming that the 1971 film Dirty Harry had a fascist moral position. He was wary of films passed off as art, but which he saw as lurid and sensational. He <b>leveled</b> this charge against such films as The Night Porter.|$|E
5|$|In the Florida Keys, {{multiple}} {{buildings that}} had been damaged by Hurricane Georges were <b>leveled</b> by Mitch.

Despite this, it was generally well reviewed by critics, who praised Jim McKay's commentary and the game's graphics and atmosphere. Criticism was <b>leveled</b> against its lack of multiplayer or course creation functionality, and some reviewers found fault with its brevity.|$|E
5|$|The storm slowly {{strengthened}} {{over the}} warm {{waters of the}} eastern Atlantic thereafter as it tracked west-northwest. Some dry air from the Saharan Air Layer continued to slow development on September 14 as Helene remained a low-end tropical storm. However, a bout of intensification took place on September 15 as shear diminished. The storm became much better organized with well-defined banding, and <b>leveled</b> off that evening at just under hurricane intensity. On the morning of September 16, the storm began to develop a ragged eye, and the storm strengthened to hurricane status. The intensity <b>leveled</b> off for a while as a marginal Category 1 hurricane, as the intensification was slowed {{by the presence of}} moderate wind shear despite the absence of significant dry air. Late that evening, the storm began to slowly intensify once again.|$|E
5|$|The storm then {{crossed the}} Tennessee state line at 8:28p.m. EDT (0028 UTC), {{and moved into}} Hamilton County, Tennessee, {{striking}} {{the small town of}} Apison at high-end EF4 strength, where multiple large homes were <b>leveled</b> or swept away, 150 others were damaged, and thousands of trees were snapped and uprooted. The tornado then crossed into Bradley County at low-end EF4 strength, moving across the southern and eastern fringes of Cleveland and affecting mainly residential areas, though a few businesses were damaged or destroyed as well. Subdivisions {{in the southern part of}} the city sustained major damage, with numerous houses destroyed and a few that were <b>leveled.</b> Four people were killed in Cleveland, and many others were injured. Several trees were felled in Polk County (as the tornado had weakened to EF1-strength), before the tornado crossed into McMinn County. The tornado re-strengthened to an EF2 and destroyed two houses and a mobile home before lifting south of Athens.|$|E

5|$|As part of Muhammad Ali's {{modernization}} policies, Ibrahim Pasha, the Egyptian {{governor of}} the Levant, issued conscription orders for a fifth of all Muslim males of fighting age. Encouraged by rural sheikh Qasim al-Ahmad, the urban notables of Nablus, Hebron and the Jerusalem-Jaffa area did not carry out Ibrahim Pasha's orders to conscript, disarm and tax the local peasantry. The religious notables of Safad followed suit. Qasim and other local leaders rallied their kinsmen and revolted against the authorities in May 1834, taking control of several towns. While {{the core of the}} fighting was in the central mountain regions of Palestine (Samaria and Judea), the revolt also spread to the Galilee, Gaza and parts of Transjordan. Jerusalem was briefly captured by the rebels and plundered. Faced with the superior firepower and organization of Ibrahim Pasha's troops, the rebels were defeated in Jabal Nablus, Jerusalem and the coastal plain before their final defeat in Hebron, which was <b>leveled.</b> Afterward, Ibrahim Pasha's troops pursued and captured Qasim in al-Karak, which was also <b>leveled.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the tornado, roughly 1,000 people lived in the hamlet of Chappaqua. Five homes and three barns were {{destroyed}} by the tornado and two people, 80-year-old Mrs. Mary Hibbs and an unknown woman, were killed; six additional people were injured. Orchards {{in the path of the}} tornado were completely destroyed and greenhouses were <b>leveled.</b> The severity of lightning during the storm caused many women to faint according to The New York Times.|$|E

Characters can swap materia among themselves, with unequipped materia being used mid-battle for such things as healing party members, compensating for the limited amount of healing items.|$|E
5|$|In Martin and St. Lucie counties, {{the storm}} was {{considered}} among the worst on record. The storm <b>leveled</b> some homes and swept many others off their foundations. At Stuart, winds removed or badly damaged 75% of the roofs in town. The storm destroyed {{the third floor of}} the building that housed a bowling alley and the Stuart News, a local newspaper. At Olympia, an abandoned settlement also known as Olympia Beach, strong winds <b>leveled</b> the old Olympia Inn, a gas station, and the second floor of a pharmaceutical building. Winds also tore the roof off an ice plant. A bridge leading to the barrier island from Olympia was partly wrecked; the bridge tender survived by gripping the railing during the storm. Winds <b>leveled</b> his nearby home. According to the Monthly Weather Review, some of the most severe damage from the storm in Florida was at Olympia. The storm left many homes in Hobe Sound uninhabitable, forcing crews to tear them down. Winter estates on the island, however, were better built and little damaged. While Stuart and Hobe Sound sustained significant damage, Port Salerno suffered minimally. In Stuart, the storm left 400 to 500 people homeless, up to nearly 10% of the population, which was 5,100 at the time. Between Jupiter and Fort Pierce, the storm knocked down power and telegraph lines. In the latter city, high waves washed out a portion of the causeway. In the 1980s, an elderly resident recalled that {{the storm was}} the most severe on record in Fort Pierce.|$|E
5|$|In the announcement, McHugh {{denied that}} the move was made in {{response}} to several high-profile misconduct allegations <b>leveled</b> against soldiers from the base in the Afghanistan War such as the Maywand District murders and the Kandahar massacre.

He then scored 124, his only century of the tour, in a non-first-class match against Western Union.|$|E
5|$|October 3, 1979: The Windsor Locks, Connecticut Tornado, an {{extremely}} destructive F4 tornado, {{one of the}} worst in Connecticut history, killed three and injured 500 in northern Hartford County. The tornado struck without warning, tearing through Bradley International Airport, destroying more than a dozen airplanes, and narrowly missing a Boeing 727 which was attempting to land. About 100 homes were completely <b>leveled.</b> Most of the $200+ million in damage was done in Windsor Locks and Suffield. This was the sixth-most damaging tornado in US history.|$|E
5|$|Providence {{is one of}} {{many cities}} claimed to be founded on seven hills like Rome. The more {{prominent}} hills are: Constitution Hill (near downtown), College Hill (east of the Providence River), and Federal Hill (west of downtown and containing New England's largest Italian district outside of Massachusetts). The other four are: Tockwotten Hill at Fox Point, Smith Hill (where the State House is located), Christian Hill at Hoyle Square (junction of Cranston and Westminster Streets), and Weybosset Hill {{at the lower end of}} Weybosset Street, which was <b>leveled</b> in the early 1880s.|$|E
5|$|Quatermass {{agrees to}} {{accompany}} Dillon on an {{investigation and the}} pair visit the farmer, who refuses to talk and sends them away.

Temples were looted and vandalized, with the remains of venerated monks confiscated. In Huế, violent street battles erupted between government forces and rioting pro-Buddhist, anti-government civilians.|$|E
5|$|The 1960 SOLAS Convention {{sought to}} control {{this sort of}} problem. These {{regulations}} required the upper ballast tanks designed in a manner to prevent shifting. They also required cargoes to be <b>leveled,</b> or trimmed, using excavators in the holds. The practice of trimming reduces {{the amount of the}} cargo's surface area in contact with air which has a useful side-effect: reducing the chances of spontaneous combustion in cargoes such as coal, iron, and metal shavings.|$|E
5|$|The Invalidenfriedhof, where Mölders is buried, lay in East Berlin and in 1975 East German {{officials}} {{ordered all}} the graves <b>leveled.</b> After the 1990 German reunification, Mölders' grave was rebuilt and rededicated on 11 October 1991 by Mölders' school friend and Domherr of the St. Hedwig's Cathedral, Heribert Rosal. The ceremony was witnessed by guests from the United States, Great Britain, Austria, Spain and Hungary.|$|E
5|$|The only {{television}} series Murphy starred in was the 1961 Whispering Smith {{in which he}} played the title character. Based on the film of the same name, the show was about a 19th-century Denver railroad investigator. Episodes were gleaned from real-life cases of the Denver Police Department. The United States Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency {{was concerned about the}} violent content in the show and <b>leveled</b> charges against the network. 26 episodes had been filmed, but not all of them aired.|$|E
5|$|Undaunted by {{this lack}} of {{confidence}} from his peers, Johnson continued to campaign to retain his office. Although his campaign was more vigorous than that of Van Buren, his behavior {{on the campaign trail}} raised concern among voters. He made rambling, incoherent speeches. During one speech in Ohio, he raised his shirt in order to display to the crowd the wounds he received during the Battle of the Thames. Charges he <b>leveled</b> against Harrison in Cleveland were so poorly received that they touched off a riot in the city.|$|E
5|$|Yaw (oscillations), begun at {{the time}} of missile detonation, {{continue}} decreasingly {{until the end of the}} minute 44 second section of the tape. The Boeing did not break up, explode or plummet immediately after the attack; it continued its gradual descent for four minutes, then <b>leveled</b> off at 16,424feet (5,006 m) (18:30–18:31UTC), rather than continue descending to 10,000 (3,000 m) as previously reported to Tokyo Area Control Center, continuing at this altitude for almost five more minutes (18:35UTC).|$|E
5|$|After the {{supercell}} {{moved through}} Nashville {{and the environment}} became favorable again, a tornado touched down to the southwest of Castalian Springs in Sumner County, Tennessee, just after 10:00 pm CST (0400 UTC). This {{was the beginning of}} a devastating, long-track EF3 tornado that would go on to kill 22 people and become the deadliest of the outbreak. At the beginning of the path, damage was relatively minor and limited to snapped trees and damaged roofs. However, the tornado rapidly intensified to EF3 strength as it tore directly through Castalian Springs, destroying numerous homes and businesses. The town's post office was completely <b>leveled,</b> mobile homes were obliterated, and several block-foundation homes were <b>leveled</b> or swept away. The 19th century Wynnewood Inn, a national historical landmark and stagecoach stop, suffered major damage to its second floor and grounds during the storm. 11-month old Castalian Springs resident Kyson Stowell survived being thrown from his family's home and carried through the air by the tornado as the structure was completely destroyed. Kyson was found unharmed in an open field, nearly 500 feet away from where he originated. Kyson's mother, Kerri Stowell, was killed in the tornado. A total of 85 homes were destroyed along this portion of the tornado's path. Seven fatalities were confirmed in Castalian Springs, and 14 other people were injured.|$|E
5|$|Air force experts raised {{questions}} and the Malaysian opposition <b>leveled</b> criticisms {{about the state of}} Malaysia's air force and radar capabilities. Many criticized the failure of the Royal Malaysian Air Force to identify and respond to an unidentified aircraft (later determined to be Flight 370) flying through Malaysian airspace. The Malaysian military became aware of the unidentified aircraft only after reviewing radar recordings several hours after the flight's disappearance. The failure to recognise and react to the unidentified aircraft was a security breach, and was also a missed opportunity to intercept Flight 370 and prevent the time-consuming and expensive search operation.|$|E
5|$|Also, {{electrical}} {{lines and}} drinking water supplies were cut in La Paz. Also, communication lines were extensively damaged. The La Paz airport received damage during the hurricane; however, by {{the afternoon of}} October1, the airport re-opened, thus allowing the military to provide much-needed aid to victims. Wood, tarpaper, and cardboard were all scattered throughout La Paz. By October 2, rescue teams had covered 38sqmi (100sqkm) to configure the damage. Throughout the city, a total of 412 people had been killed, 150 were missing people within the resort city, five of which were later presumed dead. Overall, {{nearly a third of}} the houses in La Paz were <b>leveled.</b>|$|E
5|$|Applewhite and Nettles sent {{advertisements}} {{to groups}} in California and {{were invited to}} speak to New Age devotees there in April 1975. At this meeting, they persuaded {{about half of the}} 50 attendees to follow them. They also focused on college campuses, speaking at Cañada College in August. At a meeting in Oregon in September 1975, they saw further recruitment success—about 30 people left their homes to follow the pair, prompting interest from media outlets. The coverage was negative: commentators and some former members mocked the group and <b>leveled</b> accusations of brainwashing against Applewhite and Nettles. Balch and Taylor state that Applewhite and Nettles eschewed pressure tactics, seeking only devoted followers.|$|E
5|$|April {{opened with}} United playing the {{defending}} MLS Cup champions, Colorado Rapids {{at their home}} ground, DSG Park on 2 April. The match was almost postponed due to snow earlier in the day. However, the match was still called on, as a smaller crowd of around 9,000 braved the wintry conditions. The match saw Colorado take a first half lead off recently purchased Irish-international Caleb Folan. In the 67th minute of play, the United <b>leveled</b> the score thanks to a strike from Santino Quaranta.The tie was short-lived, as the Rapids immediately struck back with a 68th-minute goal from Scottish-international Jamie Smith. Ten minutes later, Folan gave the Rapids a 3–1 lead, and in injury time, Jamaican-international Omar Cummings gave a sucker punch goal, resulting in a 4–1 defeat for United to the Rapids.|$|E
5|$|At the end {{of season}} five, Ross and Rachel drunkenly get married while vacationing with their friends in Las Vegas. In season six, their {{annulment}} request is denied because of Rachel having <b>leveled</b> unfounded allegations against Ross, forcing the two to file for a divorce instead. In season seven, Ross and Rachel unwittingly conceive a child when their birth control fails. Rachel gives birth to a girl in season eight, naming the baby Emma Geller-Green; the name Emma is a gift from Monica, who had previously been reserving the name for her own child. Rachel and Ross live together as non-romantic roommates {{during the first half}} of season nine.|$|E
