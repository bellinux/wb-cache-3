The <b>load</b> <b>flow</b> study usually uses simplified notations like a single-line diagram and focuses on various forms of AC power rather than voltage and current.

40|$|In {{this article}} {{distribution}} of monthly phosphorus <b>loads</b> <b>flowing</b> {{out of two}} agricultural catchments which are located in different physiographic conditions of Lower Silesia was analysed. Loads of phosphorus runoff from the catchment located in the piedmont part of Lower Silesia in each month rarely exceed 0. 10 kg P ∙ ha - 1. The size of annual load is determined by loads obtained in two months of early spring. Much lower loads obtained for lowland catchment, located near Wroclaw. Values ​​calculated for each month rarely exceed the value of 0. 01 kg P ∙ ha - 1. Culmination of loads bringing away {{is a bit more}} extended in a time compared to the catchment located on Sudety Mts. Foreland. Much higher loads are observed during the period from January to April – this period has a major impact on the size of phosphorus <b>load</b> that <b>flows</b> out from this catchment during whole hydrological year. The obtained results clearly indicate that the threat of watercourses and water reservoirs supply in phosphorus compounds from agricultural land is periodic and it is particularly high during early spring. Phosphorus <b>load</b> <b>flowing</b> out from the analyzed catchments is very diverse. From facility located on Sudety Foothill in hydrological year, during research period, flowed away average 0. 81 kg P ∙ ha - 1. Significantly lower values were obtained for second facility and it was average 0. 15 kg P ∙ ha - 1 during a year. The size of load discharged during a year is largely determined by amount of phosphorus <b>load</b> <b>flowing</b> out during winter half of the year (from XI to IV).

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of relativistic magnetized mass loaded outflows carrying {{toroidal magnetic field}} is analyzed {{in the context of}} Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWNs). Mass loading is very efficient in slowing down super-relativistic magnetized flows and weakening of relativistic shocks. We suggest that weakening of relativistic reverse shocks by mass loading in PWNs is responsible for the low radiative efficiencies {{of the majority of the}} PWNs. Mass loading may also result in a shock transition near the fast magnetosonic point; this is unlikely to happen in majority of PWNs. The evolution of magnetized mass <b>loaded</b> <b>flows</b> beyond the reverse shock is complicated: after initial deceleration to the minimal velocity required to transport the magnetic flux, the mass <b>loaded</b> <b>flows</b> have to accelerate. In order to be able to expand to infinity, magnetized flows should either become time dependent or destroy the toroidal magnetic flux by developing internal instabilities. Destruction of the magnetic flux initiated by mass loading may allow for the flow to slow down to sub-relativistic velocities and resolve the σ paradox of the pulsar wind nebula. 1...|$|R

The first part of the theory is actually the Newton-Raphson algorithm. This is expanded by including the second order terms from the Taylor expansion to produce a quasi-second order Newton-Rahpson solution method. The theory is then further modified to yield the more general alpha-modified method. Extensive testing is performed using the new method for seven different power systems. The same systems are rerun with the Newton-Raphson so that a comparison can be made and the new method's relative merit judged. The rate of convergence is studied, as well as the mismatch values which occur during the <b>load</b> <b>flows.</b> This is done for many different values of alpha and for the different systems.

40|$|The heavily <b>loaded</b> <b>flows</b> usually occupy more {{bandwidth}} {{than that}} of the lightly <b>loaded</b> <b>flows</b> under congested traffic conditions. Without effective bandwidth management mechanisms, malicious users may violate congestion control principles in order to get maximum bandwidth. Therefore, how to provide fair bandwidth sharing with low implemen-tation complexity is a critical issue for high-speed networks. An active queue management mechanism, stateless fair admission control (SFAC), is proposed in this paper, which can provide good fairness on bandwidth allocation. Furthermore, the SFAC does not have to maintain per-flow state in each router. The main idea of the SFAC is that two admission thresholds can optimally change according to traffic variations. By comparing the admission thresholds with the hit number of each arrival packet, the SFAC is able to guarantee fair buffer occupancy for each flow. The SFAC employs a single first in, first out buffer, so that it can provide fair bandwidth sharing. In a word, the SFAC is completely stateless, so it possesses the great advantage of being easy to implement. Computer simulations concluded that the SFAC is capable of providing good fair bandwidth sharing under a range of traffic conditions...|$|R

50|$|Based {{on these}} values, a bus may be {{classified}} into the above-mentioned three categories as -Real and reactive powers (i.e. complex power) cannot be fixed. The net complex power {{flow into the}} network is not known in advance, and the system power losses are unknown until the study is complete. It is necessary to have one bus (i.e. the slack bus) at which complex power is unspecified so that it supplies {{the difference in the}} total system load plus losses and the sum of the complex powers specified at the remaining buses. The complex power allocated to this bus is computed as part of the solution. In order for the variations in real and reactive powers of the slack bus to be a small percentage of its generating capacity during the solution process, the bus connected to the largest generating station is normally selected as the slack bus. The slack bus is crucial to a <b>load</b> <b>flow</b> problem since it will account for transmission line losses. In a <b>load</b> <b>flow</b> problem, conservation of energy results in the total generation equaling to the sum of the loads. However, there still would be a discrepancy in these quantities due to line losses, which are dependent on line current. Yet to determine line current, angles and voltages of the buses connected to the line would be needed. Here, the slack bus will be required to account for line losses and serve as a generator, injecting real power to the system.|$|E
