50|$|The {{following}} {{drugs can}} be used for treatment of coccidiosis in cattle: amprolium, sulfaquinoxaline, and sulfamethazine. However, it is often more effective to prevent this disease in cattle, which can be aided by the products <b>lasalocid,</b> decoquinate, and monensin.|$|E
50|$|Ideally {{pastures}} {{should be}} used before they become overly lush and protein-rich. If this is not possible, the new diet should be introduced slowly by grazing the cattle {{just a few hours}} each day and increasing gradually, over a period of a fortnight. Cutting the pasture immediately before putting the cattle out may help. Drugs are available (monensin or <b>lasalocid)</b> which change the rumen biochemistry in preparation for high tryptophan levels, inhibiting the bacteria that convert L-tryptophan to 3-methylindole. Care must be taken to keep these products away from horses, for which, since horses have no rumen, they are toxic.|$|E
5000|$|Measures for {{preventing}} lactic acidosis in ruminants include avoidance of excessive amounts of grain in the diet, and gradual introduction of grain {{over a period}} of several days, to develop a rumen population capable of safely dealing with a relatively high grain intake. [...] Administration of <b>lasalocid</b> or monensin in feed can reduce risk of lactic acidosis in ruminants, [...] inhibiting most of the lactate-producing bacterial species without inhibiting the major lactate fermenters. [...] Also, using a higher feeding frequency to provide the daily grain ration can allow higher grain intake without reducing the pH of the rumen fluid.|$|E

40|$|Background: Topical {{antimicrobial}} preparations are {{of utmost}} importance in treating suspected and confirmed meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) infections due to the increasing incidence of widespread resistance to systemic antimicrobials. <b>Lasalocid</b> is active against MRSP in vitro and this may become an important topical antimicrobial {{for the treatment of}} canine pyoderma. Hypothesis/Objectives: To determine effects of various formulation types on penetration and retention of <b>lasalocid</b> applied to canine skin in vitro. Animals: Normal canine skin was collected from the thorax of five dogs that had been euthanized on the basis of health and/or intractable behavioural issues. Methods: Solution, lotion and ointment containing 2 % <b>lasalocid</b> were applied to ex vivo canine skin. Transdermal penetration was assessed for a 24 h period and retention of <b>lasalocid</b> was assessed {{at the conclusion of the}} study.

Given the recent {{emergence}} of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus {{as a cause of}} bovine mastitis, new intramammary (IMA) treatments are urgently required. <b>Lasalocid,</b> a member of the polyether ionophore class of antimicrobial agents, has not been previously administered to cows by the IMA route and has favorable characteristics for development as a mastitis treatment. This study aimed to develop an IMA drug delivery system (IMDS) of <b>lasalocid</b> for the treatment of bovine mastitis. Methods: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined applying the procedures recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. Solid dispersions (SDs) of <b>lasalocid</b> were prepared and characterized using differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. IMDSs containing <b>lasalocid</b> of micronized, nano-sized, or as SD form were tested for their IMA safety in cows. Therapeutic efficacy of <b>lasalocid</b> IMDSs was tested in a bovine model involving experimental IMA challenge with the mastitis pathogen Streptococcus uberis. Results: <b>Lasalocid</b> demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the major Gram-positive mastitis pathogens including S. aureus (MIC range 0. 5 – 8  µg/mL). The solubility test confirmed limited, ion-strength-dependent water solubility of <b>lasalocid.</b> A kinetic solubility study showed that SDs effectively enhanced water solubility of <b>lasalocid</b> (21 – 35 -fold). Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) -lasalocid SD caused minimum mammary irritation in treated cows and exhibited faster distribution in milk than either nano or microsized <b>lasalocid.</b> IMDSs with PVP-lasalocid SD provided effective treatment with a higher mastitis clinical and microbiological cure rate (66. 7 %) compared to cloxacillin (62. 5 %).

As the trypanocidal mechanism of action of polyether ionophore antibiotics is due to a sodium influx-induced cell swelling, the effect of <b>lasalocid</b> acid on cell volume change in bloodstream-form trypanosomes was investigated. Interestingly, <b>lasalocid</b> acid induced a much faster cell swelling in trypanosomes than the more trypanocidal related ionophore salinomycin. These results support further investigations of <b>lasalocid</b> acid and derivatives thereof as potential agents against African trypanosomiasis...|$|E
40|$|<b>Lasalocid</b> is an {{antibiotic}} {{from the group}} of carboxylic ionophores, produced by Streptomyces lasaliensis. But there was limited information of <b>lasalocid</b> on human prostate cancer cells. In the present studies, to better understand its effect in human prostate cancer cells, apoptosis and autophagy associated with possible signal pathways in vitro was examined. Our study showed that <b>lasalocid</b> mediated cell cycle arrest in G 0 /G 1 phase by reducing G 1 phase dependent proteins, indicating entering into apoptotic cell death pathway. Lasalocid-induced apoptosis was involved with reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and mitochondrial hyperpolarization. In addition, <b>lasalocid</b> induced autophagy through microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC- 3) -II conversion, acidic vesicular organelles formation and GFP-LC- 3 punctuate, which was inhibited by 3 -methyladenine (3 -MA), a widely used pharmacological inhibitor of autophagy. Furthermore, the autophagic phenomena were mediated by production of ROS, confirming that inhibition of ROS with N-acetyl-L-cysteine, a ROS inhibitor, attenuated lasalocid-triggered autophagy. Inhibition of autophagy with 3 -MA enhanced the lasalocid-induced apoptosis through enhanced ROS generation. Taken together, <b>lasalocid</b> should be useful {{in the search for}} new potential chemotherapeutic agents for understanding the molecular mechanisms of anticancer in prostate cancer cells. clos...|$|E
40|$|It {{is thought}} that {{monensin}} increases the efficiency of feed utilization by cattle by altering the rumen fermentation. We studied the effect of monensin and the related ionophore antibiotic lasalocid-sodium (Hoffman-LaRoche) on the growth of methanogenic and rumen saccharolytic bacteria in a complex medium containing rumen fluid. Ruminococcus albus, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens were inhibited by 2. 5 μg of monensin or <b>lasalocid</b> per ml. Growth of Bacteroides succinogenes and Bacteroides ruminicola was delayed by 2. 5 μg of monensin or <b>lasalocid</b> per ml. Populations of B. succinogenes and B. ruminicola that were resistant to 20 μg of either drug per ml were rapidly selected by growth {{in the presence of}} each drug at 5. 0 μg/ml. Selenomonas ruminantium was insensitive to 40 μg of monensin or <b>lasalocid</b> per ml. Either antibiotic (10 μg/ml) inhibited Methanobacterium MOH, Methanobacterium formicicum, and Methanosarcina barkeri MS. Methanobacterium ruminantium PS was insensitive to 40 μg of monensin or 20 μg of <b>lasalocid</b> per ml. The methanogenic strain 442 was insensitive to 40 μg of monensin but sensitive to 10 μg of <b>lasalocid</b> per ml. The results suggest that monensin or <b>lasalocid</b> acts in the rumen by selecting for succinate-forming Bacteroides and for S. ruminantium, a propionate producer that decarboxylates succinate to propionate. The selection could lead to an increase in rumen propionate formation. Selection against H 2 and formate producers, e. g. R. albus, R. flavefaciens, and B. fibrisolvens, could lead to a depression of methane production in the rumen...|$|E

40|$|The {{transport}} kinetics {{of three}} lanthanide ions {(Pr^{ 3 +}, Nd^{ 3 +}, and {Eu^{ 3 +}}) } across dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine unilamellar vesicles {{mediated by the}} 2 carboxylic ionophores <b>lasalocid</b> A and A 23187 were studied by proton NMR spectroscopy. Time-dependent changes in the chemical shifts of head group choline signals were measured to calculate apparent rate conststants of transport. These experiments were done at different ionophore concentrations to determine the stoichiometry of the transporting species. The rates of transport were faster {{in the absence of}} intravesicular {La^{ 3 +}} compared to those obsserved in its presence. The stoichiometry of the transporting species was 2 : 1 (ionophore:cation) for both <b>lasalocid</b> A and A 23187 in dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine vesicles. However, stoichiometries of > 2 were obtained for <b>lasalocid</b> A-mediated lanthanide ion transport across dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine vesicles. Possible reasons for the observation of such noninteger stoichiometries are discussed. Also, A 23187 is a more efficient carrier ionophore than <b>lasalocid</b> A...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>lasalocid</b> over milk, milk fat content, live weight and body condition, were {{analysed}} on 18 “Mantiqueira” cows, 75 days after parturition {{in the begining}} of the trial. Cows were fed 1 kg concentrate mixture for each 2, 5 kg of milk produced over the first 4. 0 kg of milk, chopped elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum, Napier var), and Brachiaria brizantha pasture. A randomized block design was used with 0, 200 or 300 mg of lasalocid/animal/day as treatments. The experimental period lasted 17 weeks, and first four weeks were used as an adaptation period to the ionophore. <b>Lasalocid</b> had no effects on milk or fat corrected milk production, but the 200 mg <b>lasalocid</b> group presented higher milk fat percentages (P < 0. 05).
