5000|$|Methamphetamine (MA), {{a potent}} {{central nervous system}} stimulant, causes a rush of dopamine, norepinephrine, and {{serotonin}} release in the brain when ingested. Street methamphetamine is referred to by many names, such as “speed,” “meth,” and “chalk”. [...] The drug can be injected, smoked, snorted, and even taken by oral or anal routes. The neurotransmitter release from MA ingestion (especially dopamine) leads to feelings of euphoria, decreased appetite and fatigue, and increased alertness, wellbeing, and exhilaration. More specifically, MA mechanism of action is to stimulate the release of dopamine into the synaptic cleft while preventing the reuptake of dopamine and norephinephrine. Long-lasting functional impairments in the monoamine system are likely to result from <b>long-term</b> <b>abuse</b> of MA.|$|E

50|$|Naltrexone is also {{a partial}} inverse agonist, and this {{property}} is exploited in treatment of opioid addiction, as a sustained course of low-dose naltrexone can reverse the altered homeostasis which results from <b>long-term</b> <b>abuse</b> of opioid agonist drugs. This is the only treatment available which can reverse the long-term after effects of opioid addiction known as post acute withdrawal syndrome, which otherwise tends to produce symptoms such as depression and anxiety {{that may lead to}} eventual relapse. A course of low-dose naltrexone is thus often used as the final step in the treatment of opioid addiction after the patient has been weaned off the substitute agonist such as methadone or buprenorphine, in order to restore homeostasis and minimize the risk of post acute withdrawal syndrome once the maintenance agonist has been withdrawn.|$|E

40|$|In {{a series}} of event-related {{potential}} (ERP) studies, we have consistently demonstrated an ERP component correlate of visual short-term memory. There have been frequent reports on the deficits of information encoding, retention, and retrieval in chronic alcoholics. In the present study, we investigated that the ERP mnemonic effects could be influenced by <b>long-term</b> alcohol <b>abuse.</b> ERP data were recorded from 48 controls and 77 alcoholics while the subjects performed a modified delayed matching to sample paradigm using {{a series of}} object pictures as stimuli. The alcoholics completed the task with more errors and longer response times than the controls. The major differences in the evoked potentials {{between the two groups}} are found at the temporo-occipital and frontal regions in the sample and nonmatching trials, and mostly prominent in the right hemisphere. The current study indicates that the ERP technique can be a useful tool to index short-term memory.

50|$|It {{is evident}} that <b>long-term</b> Cocaine <b>abuse</b> alters brain {{structures}}. Research {{has shown that the}} brain structures that are immediately affected by <b>long-term</b> cocaine <b>abuse</b> include: cerebral hypoperfusion in the frontal, periventricular and temporal-parietal. These structures play a role in various memory systems. Furthermore, the drug cocaine elicits its desirable effects by blocking the DRD1 dopamine receptors in the striatum, resulting in increased dopamine levels in the brain. These receptors are important for the consolidation of procedural memory. These increased dopamine levels in the brain resultant of cocaine use is similar to the increased dopamine levels in the brain found in schizophrenics. Studies have compared the common memory deficits caused by both cases to further understand the neural networks of procedural memory. To learn more about the effects of dopamine and its role in schizophrenia see: dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia. Studies using rats have shown that when rats are administered trace amounts of cocaine, their procedural memory systems are negatively impacted. Specifically, the rats are unable to effectively consolidate motor-skill learning. With cocaine abuse being associated with poor procedural learning, research has shown that abstinence from cocaine is associated with sustained improvement of motor-skill learning (Wilfred et al.).|$|R
5000|$|Toxic Stress {{can occur}} when {{experiences}} are long in duration and intensity. Children need caring and supportive adults {{to help them}} because {{it is difficult for}} children to handle this type of stress on their own. Therefore the stress response may be activated from weeks to months or even years.Prolonged stress leads to adverse effects such as permanent emotional or developmental damage.If the sufficient support is not available, the results of this type of stress can lead to permanent changes in brain development. Research has found that children experiencing severe and <b>long-term</b> <b>abuse</b> have smaller brain sizes. If the situation is not as severe, toxic stress will still alter the stress response system. [...] The changes in the system will cause children to react to a wider variety of stressors. [...] However, with sufficient care and support from adults, children can return their stress levels to tolerable or good. Examples of toxic stress are abuse, neglect, violence and overall hardships without adult support. Toxic stress can have a cumulative effect on physical and mental health.|$|E
50|$|One {{major effort}} {{designed}} to achieve gender-specific {{substance abuse treatment}} include the implementation and monitoring of therapeutic communities (TCs), which are characterized by the National Institute for Drug Abuse as “drug-free residential settings that use a hierarchical model with treatment stages that reflect increased levels of personal and social responsibility”. TCs have been a national model for drug abuse treatment historically found in male facilities, but have appeared in female facilities. While male-oriented TCs tend to use authoritarian and aggressive approaches, female-oriented TCs take a more relaxed, and less confrontational approach. In both cases, TCs {{have been successful in}} reducing recidivism. For example, the Stay’n Out program was shown to reduce recidivism rates for both women and men. Furthermore, women who stayed in the program for 9 to 12 months were more likely to successfully complete their parole compared to their male counterparts. For women suffering from severe and <b>long-term</b> <b>abuse,</b> a more intense TC, residential TC, was implemented. Women in these residential programs lived together, and away from the general prison population. Despite this being most needed form of treatment for women, in 1994, most prisons lacked this type residential programming, with less than nine percent of women receiving such treatment while incarcerated.|$|E
5000|$|In Australia, Tasmania {{became the}} first state to abolish the partial defence of {{provocation}} in case of murder which acted by converting what would otherwise have been murder into manslaughter. The next state to abolish it was Victoria, in 2005, however it was replaced by a new defensive homicide law. The 2005 defensive homicide laws were subsequently repealed in 2014 [...] Western Australia abolished the partial defence of provocation in 2008. [...] The ACT and the Northern Territory amended the law in 2004 and 2006 respectively to exclude a non-violent sexual advance as a sufficient basis for a defence of provocation in itself; such conduct {{must be taken into account}} with other conduct of the deceased to determine whether the defence has been established. By contrast in New South Wales, the law of provocation was amended in 2014 to assert that a non-violent sexual advance to the accused does not constitute extreme provocation. It was also made clear in the amendments that the conduct of the deceased may constitute extreme provocation, even if the conduct did not occur immediately before the act causing death. This was done in order to provide protection for victims of <b>long-term</b> <b>abuse,</b> or [...] "slow burn" [...] situations. In Queensland the partial defence of provocation in section 304(1) of the Criminal Code was amended in 2011, in order to [...] "reduce the scope of the defence being available to those who kill out of sexual possessiveness orjealousy". In 2014, New South Wales law on provocation was amended to the defence of extreme provocation; the provocative conduct of the deceased must also have constituted a serious indictable offence, and the loss of self-control test must be measured by the objective test of the [...] "ordinary person".|$|E
