5000|$|The A and B wires of an {{analogue}} {{phone line}} {{appear in a}} structured cabling system usually on the centre pins of the 8P8C connector (pins 4 and 5; the blue/white TIA/EIA-568 pair 1 in Cat5 cables). In most other countries, those two wires are {{all that is needed}} to connect an analogue telephone. In the UK, however, many telephones expect the 25 Hz ring signal on a third wire. But such a 3-wire interface is not the symmetric interface needed for balanced twisted-pair transmission lines, and therefore prone to electromagnetic interference and crosstalk with nearby other wiring. Therefore, the capacitor that separates the bell signal from the A/B wires should be located close to the telephone. Any bell wire provided by the master socket is therefore not connected to the structured cabling, and the telephone is plugged at the other end into the structured cabling via a <b>line</b> <b>adapter</b> <b>unit</b> (LAU) / Mod-Tap / Molex that contains the capacitor needed to create the separate bell signal.

The receptacle (10) comprises receiving elements (11, 12), which are immovable when acting as a holder at a temperature for cryoconservation and secure the sample chamber and which are deformed and/or moved at a temperature above the cryoconservation temperature when released. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The <b>adapter</b> <b>unit</b> (100) comprises a receptacle (10) designed to detachably secure a sample chamber, a coupling unit (30) designed to connect the receptacle to a base part that is secured in a refrigeration device, and a memory chip, a visual identification unit, a transponder element and/or a data interface. The receptacle (10) comprises receiving elements (11, 12), which are immovable when acting as a holder at a temperature for cryoconservation and secure the sample chamber and which are deformed and/or moved at a temperature above the cryoconservation temperature when released, so that the sample chamber is detached from the <b>adapter</b> <b>unit</b> or is inserted into the <b>adapter</b> <b>unit.</b> The coupling unit is designed to form the connection with the base part in the holding condition of the receptacle, and designed {{for the formation of}} a screw-connection, a latching-connection or plug-connection. The receiving element comprises two retaining arms, between which the sample chamber is enclosable. The retaining arms have first ends (14), which are connected over a plate and/or joint, and second ends (16), at which the coupling unit is provided. The plate and/or the joint are fixed at the cryoconservation temperature. The receptacle has a changeable size, so that the sample chambers with different sizes and/or shapes are secured to the <b>adapter</b> <b>unit,</b> and/or so that the sample chamber is restrained from the receiving element. The receptacle is designed for coupling a further receptacle. The receiving elements comprise sleeve sections, between which the sample chamber is enclosable, for holding the sample chamber, have a lateral distance, so that a surface area of the sample chamber lies in a free manner, and/or are partially transparent. The receptacle is formed, so that it has a visible damage or destruction in the case of separation of the sample chamber from the receptacle at the cryoconservation temperature.

The blade architecture is robust and flexible enough to enable the design of general-purpose Intelprocessor-based two-way and four-way blades, IBM POWEReprocessor-based blades, blades based on AMD Opterone processors, and common expansion blades. In addition, the processor blades, expansion <b>adapters,</b> and <b>units</b> use a serialized– deserialized (SerDes) interface for the internal I/O fabrics, thus giving blades the flexibility to support virtually any I/O protocol that supports SerDes. Support for I/O fabrics beyond the base Gigabit Ethernet is accomplished via optional I/O expansion adapters for Fibre Channel, Myricom Myrinet t, InfiniBand t, or additional Gigabit Ethernet.

50|$|The {{price of}} a DOF adapter ranges from tens of {{thousands}} of US dollars for a professional solution to less than a hundred by using parts available from a local hardware store. The pricing of a DOF <b>adapter</b> <b>unit</b> also depends on the material and technologies used. For instance, a relay lens system must be added if the adapter is to be directly mounted to a camera's body (bypassing the standard lens, as if on a Canon XL1 or XL2 and the Sony EX3). Also, a prism system that is used on some adapters that correctly reorients the image rightside-up adds to the cost.|$|R

The new system {{consists of a}} torsional vibration damper, a cardan axle, a torque flange, and an <b>adapter</b> <b>unit,</b> together with a new dynamometer. To ensure another failure would not occur {{a study of the}} new system was conducted. A general methodology for simulating the behaviour of a test rig powertrain was developed using AVL Excite Designer and applied to the redesigned system. The simulated results were then used to evaluate the new components for durability. The loads obtained from AVL Excite were used for load based analysis, and used as boundary conditions in finite element models in Abaqus of components where load analysis was not sufficient. Based on the results it was recommended that continuous operation at high loads in the RPM range below ⇡ 1650 is to be avoided to reduce the following risks: • Overloading of the torsional vibration damper, which will result in excessive wear of the unit shortening its life-span. • Overloading of the torque flange, which can result in risk of fatigue failure.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} in unlimited. The Janus simulation model was initially designed {{to operate in}} a stand-alone mode. There is an ongoing research project to link Janus to other constructive simulations and virtual simulators. The present standard used to connect different models is Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS). Janus can operate in a DIS environment using a cell <b>adapter</b> <b>unit</b> called the World Modeler. The combination of Janus and the World Modeler is known as JLink. A goal of the JLink system is to replicate the analytical and training fidelity of stand-alone Janus in a distributed exercise. The purpose of this thesis is to assess {{the current state of}} JLink development. The experiment simulated three scenarios: armored, armored coalition, and light infantry battalions attacking against a defending company. All scenarios were executed in two contrasting environments. The simulation included the recently developed JLink features Family of Scatterable Mine (FASCAM) and chemical artillery. The thesis used five Measures of Performance to base the assessment: (1) FASCAM kills, (2) Chemical Artillery Kills, (3) Detection Ranges, (4) Kill Ranges, and (5) Loss Exchange Ratio. The statistical tests used for analysis were the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test, two-sample t-test, and Wilcoxon test. The results of the analysis show that JLink requires adjustments to artillery delivery methods in order to correct chemical artillery discrepancies and detection range issues.

5000|$|Swi5 is a {{transcriptional}} activator of Sic1, which inhibits S-phase CDKs. Thus, Sic1 protein degradation {{is necessary}} to enter S-phase. SCF (Cdc4) complex’s regulatory function concerning S-phase entry comprises not only degradation of Sic1, but also degradation of Swi5. In order for the substrate <b>adapter</b> <b>unit</b> Cdc4 to bind to Sic1, a minimum of any six of the nine cyclin-dependent kinase sites on Sic1 have to be phosphorylated. In other words: There is a threshold number of phosphorylation sites {{in order to achieve}} receptor-ligand binding. As recently stated, this [...] "suggests that the ultrasensitivity in the Sic1-Cdc4 system may be driven at least in part by cumulative electrostatic interactions". In general, an ultrasensitive enzyme requires less than 81-fold increase in stimulus to drive it from 10% to 90% activity. [...] "Ultrasensitivity" [...] highlights that the upstroke of the stimulus/response curve is steeper than the one that is obtained for a hyperbolic Michaelis-Menten enzyme. Thus, ultrasensitivity allows a highly sensitive response: A graded input can be transformed into a sharply thresholded output. The development of B-type cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase activity, as well as the onset of DNA replication, requires degradation of Sic1 in the late G1 phase of the cell cycle. The WD domain of Cdc4 binds to the phosphorylated form of Sic1. Each bond to a Sic1-Phosphate is weak, but together the binding is strong enough to enable Sic1-degradation via the pathway described before. Hence, in this case ultrasensitivity allows precise definition ("fine tuning") of the time point in which destruction of Sic1 occurs, leading to initiation of {{the next step in the}} cell cycle (-> DNA replication).|$|R
