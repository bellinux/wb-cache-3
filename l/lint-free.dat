5000|$|The wax is evenly {{and lightly}} applied over the surface, then lightly buffed {{with a smooth}} <b>lint-free</b> cloth to give a sheen. Where {{the shape of the}} item requires, a brush may be used instead. It is also used in jewelry making to {{preserve}} the patina of the metal.|$|E
5000|$|Insert a {{piece of}} silver wire into {{concentrated}} HCl then allow the wire to dry on a <b>lint-free</b> cleaning cloth. This forms an insoluble layer of AgCl {{on the surface of}} the electrode and gives you an Ag/AgCl wire. Repeat dipping every few months or if the QRE starts to drift.|$|E
5000|$|Jek carpets (Cek xalçaları) - is a {{term used}} for <b>lint-free</b> and pile carpets woven by Jek people living in Quba Rayon, Azerbaijan. These carpets are {{included}} in the Kuba group of Shirvan type and are named in honour of Jek village of Quba Rayon. Foreign art critics mistakenly called these carpets [...] "Dagestani".|$|E
50|$|When {{objects are}} in good condition, normal surface dirt and grime is removed safely by a few {{different}} ways. One way is using a soft brush to lightly dust the object, dislodging dust and debris. To remove surface dust a variable speed vacuum, soft <b>lint-free</b> cloths, vinyl eraser crumbs, volcanized rubber sponges, and micro-attachments are also tools that can be utilized.|$|E
5000|$|In {{recent decades}} {{researchers}} have developed <b>lint-free</b> tack cloths, made from continuous filament (non-fibrous) synthetic yarns and finished edges (similar to electronics cleanroom wipers, this design is commonly required for paint process in automotive assembly plants). Another innovation has been modification of common tack cloths that are normally electrically resistive {{to perform at}} antistatic levels, defined by independent standards organizations (like ASTM, IEEE, MIL-SPEC, etc.).|$|E
50|$|After the {{identified}} dwell time has passed, penetrant {{on the outer}} surface of the material is then removed. This highly controlled process is {{necessary in order to}} ensure that the penetrant is removed only from the surface of the material and not from inside any identified flaws. Various chemicals can be used for such a process and vary by specific penetrant types. Typically, the cleaner is applied to a <b>lint-free</b> cloth that is used to carefully clean the surface.|$|E
50|$|The {{printing}} {{depends on}} the smooth flow of ink, which can be hindered if the ink begins to dry at the print head, as can happen when an ink level becomes low. Dried ink can be cleaned from a cartridge print head using isopropyl alcohol or water. Isopropyl alcohol will damage the printing head, melting the plastic at the connections and rubber gaskets. Tap water contains contaminants that may clog the print head, so distilled water and a <b>lint-free</b> cloth is recommended.|$|E

5000|$|Linen fabric feels cool to the touch, a {{phenomenon}} which indicates its higher conductivity (the same principle that makes metals feel [...] "cold"). It is smooth, making the finished fabric <b>lint-free,</b> and gets softer {{the more it}} is washed. However, constant creasing {{in the same place}} in sharp folds will tend to break the linen threads. This wear can show up in collars, hems, and any area that is iron creased during laundering. Linen has poor elasticity and does not spring back readily, explaining why it wrinkles so easily.|$|E

It is also used in rigid gas permeable contact lens fitting to evaluate the tear layer under the lens. It is available as sterile single-use sachets containing <b>lint-free</b> paper applicators soaked in fluorescein sodium. Intravenous or oral fluorescein is used in fluorescein angiography in research and to diagnose and categorize vascular disorders including retinal disease macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, inflammatory intraocular conditions, and intraocular tumors. It is also being used increasingly during surgery for brain tumors.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{pipettes}} are calibrated [...] "to deliver" [...] (TD) and not [...] "to contain" [...] (TC). If {{they are}} TD pipettes {{they should not}} be rinsed after they have delivered their contents. If the pipette were calibrated TC it should be rinsed to obtain the correct amount of material. If the fluid to be measured is quite viscous or sticky (such as glycerol solutions) the pipette must be calibrated and in this case the outside of the tip must be carefully wiped with a <b>lint-free</b> tissue to remove the adhering liquid - while being careful to not touch the opening of the pipette tip, which may require some practice. Accuracy in delivering liquids with high or low viscosity may require a [...] "positive displacement" [...] pipettor, which is quite distinct from an air displacement pipettor.|$|E
5000|$|UV curing {{refers to}} the {{chemical}} process that occurs when photoinitiators within the gel itself {{are exposed to the}} UV or blue light. The energy from the light causes certain bonds in the initiator molecules to break, forming free radicals. The radicals begin attacking double bonds in the gel's component molecules, beginning a polymerization reaction which eventually encompasses all the molecules of the gel. Gels usually contain a mixture of acrylic monomers and oligomers, which combine to form long, interlocking chains during the polymerization, a process known as cross-linking. These long, bonded chains make the gel hard and chemically resistant. Usually, once the nail extension and/or gel manicure has been finished, there is a residual tacky layer, referred to as the [...] "inhibition layer," [...] that is removed by wiping with a preferably <b>lint-free</b> wipe soaked in high concentrate alcohol.|$|E
5000|$|The excess {{penetrant}} is then {{removed from}} the surface. The removal method {{is controlled by the}} type of penetrant used. Water-washable, solvent-removable, lipophilic post-emulsifiable, or hydrophilic post-emulsifiable are the common choices. Emulsifiers represent the highest sensitivity level, and chemically interact with the oily penetrant to make it removable with a water spray. When using solvent remover and <b>lint-free</b> cloth it is important to not spray the solvent on the test surface directly, because this can remove the penetrant from the flaws. If excess penetrant is not properly removed, once the developer is applied, it may leave a background in the developed area that can mask indications or defects. In addition, this may also produce false indications severely hindering the ability to do a proper inspection. Also, the removal of excessive penetrant is done towards one direction either vertically or horizontally as the case may be.|$|E
50|$|Because {{of their}} portability, laptops {{are subject to}} more wear and {{physical}} damage than desktops. Components such as screen hinges, latches, power jacks, and power cords deteriorate gradually from ordinary use, and {{may have to be}} replaced. A liquid spill onto the keyboard, a rather minor mishap with a desktop system (given that a basic keyboard costs about US$20), can damage the internals of a laptop and destroy the computer or result in a costly repair. One study found that a laptop is {{three times more likely to}} break during the first year of use than a desktop. To maintain a laptop, it is recommended to clean it every three months for dirt, debris, dust, and food particles. Most cleaning kits consist of a <b>lint-free</b> or Microfiber cloth for the LCD screen and keyboard, compressed air for getting dust out of the cooling fan, and cleaning solution. Harsh chemicals such as bleach should not be used to clean a laptop, as they can damage it.|$|E
50|$|Optical media disks {{often require}} {{professional}} preventative or routine cleaning to ensure data accuracy and accessibility; {{those with no}} professional experience may scratch the disk surface {{in their attempt to}} clean the disk. Build up of dust and oily contaminants on the disk surface, and fingerprints can typically impede the laser beam’s ability to penetrate the substrate to read the data layer, and more often impede writing. Minor interferences with reading is handled by error correction technology. If an audio CD (with a much lower accuracy threshold than a data disk) becomes dirty, it can be cleaned safely with a dry, soft <b>lint-free</b> cloth, holding the disc by the edges or by the center hole. Light dirt that is not removed by this method can be removed with a cloth dampened with water or a suitable optical disc-cleaning fluid. It has been advised that excess dust be blown off an optical disc before reading, to avoid buildup of dust in the reader, particularly on the laser.|$|E
5000|$|Both {{the optical}} flat {{and the surface}} to be tested need to be {{extremely}} clean. The tiniest bit of dust settling between the surfaces can ruin the results. Even the thickness of a streak or a fingerprint on the surfaces can be enough to change {{the width of the}} gap between them. Before the test, the surfaces are usually cleaned very thoroughly. Most commonly, acetone is used as the cleaning agent, because it dissolves most oils and it evaporates completely, leaving no residue. Typically, the surface will be cleaned using the [...] "drag" [...] method, in which a <b>lint-free,</b> scratch-free tissue is wetted, stretched, and dragged across the surface, pulling any impurities along with it. This process is usually performed dozens of times, ensuring that the surface is completely free of impurities. A new tissue will need to be used each time, to prevent recontamination of the surfaces from previously removed dust and oils.|$|E
50|$|Synthetic ATF is {{available}} in aftermarket brands, offering better performance and service life for certain applications (such as frequent trailer towing).The use of a <b>lint-free</b> white rag to wipe the dipstick on automatic transmissions is advised so that {{the color of the}} fluid can be checked. Dark brown or black ATF can be an indicator of a transmission problem, vehicle abuse, or fluid that has far exceeded its useful life. Over-used ATF often has reduced lubrication properties and abrasive friction materials (from clutches and brake bands) suspended in it; failure to replace such fluid will accelerate transmission wear and could eventually ruin an otherwise healthy transmission. However color alone is not a completely reliable indication of the service life of ATF as most ATF products will darken with use. The manufacturer's recommended service interval is a more reliable measure of ATF life. In the absence of service or repair records, fluid color is a common means of gauging ATF service life.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{recommended}} that discs be cleaned before—and after—each playback, carbon-fibre brushes are quite effective. Records should be cleaned in a circular motion, {{in the direction of}} the grooves. Distilled water (not tap water as it will leave behind mineral deposits) and a soft, <b>lint-free</b> cloth is a common method of cleaning. Another method is to clean the LP on the turntable with a disc cleaning brush (the Discwasher system is frequently recommended by the audio press). A simple [...] "cleaning bath" [...] device called the Spin Clean gives good results, and there are also vacuum machines on the market such as the Nitty Gritty, Keith Monks, Clearaudio, and VPI, which are recommended for more a thorough cleaning. In recent years, ultrasonic cleaning machines from manufacturers such as Klaudio (Korea) and Audio Desk Systeme (Germany) have also been used with great success. The effectiveness of the ultrasonic machines coupled with their premium price tags (both $4,000 US in January 2015) has opened the door for companies to offer professional ultrasonic cleaning at an affordable cost of just a few dollars per record. Another cleaning product recently released called Record Revirginizer uses a polymer that is applied to record surface then left to dry, the polymer is then peeled from the surface taking the microscopic contaminants with it. Though in the past, using alcohol on vinyl LPs was considered safe, experts now caution against it unless absolutely necessary, as alcohol threatens the loss of the plasticizer or stabilizer. As vinyl is often prone to electrostatic charges that cause dust and debris to be attracted to its surface, anti-static products can be used if needed.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the influence of moistening on the stents’ surface wettability, contact angle determinations were performed twice, first with dry specimens, second with moistened specimens; the latter were thoroughly soaked in physiological NaCl-solution for 30  min to ensure a complete wetting. Before applying the sessile drop method, any surplus NaCl-solution was carefully removed with <b>lint-free</b> absorbent paper (KimtechScience® Kimwipes™, Kimberly-Clark, USA).|$|E

40|$|The present {{invention}} is {{a process}} for cleaning a cathode tube and other subassemblies in a hollow cathode assembly. In the disclosed process, hand covering elastomer gloves are used for handling all cathode assembly parts. The cathode tube and other subassemblies are cleaned with a <b>lint-free</b> cloth damped with acetone, then wiped with alcohol, immersed in ethyl alcohol or acetone, and ultrasonic agitation is applied, heating to 60 C. for ethyl alcohol or 56 C. for acetone. The cathode tube and other subassemblies are dried by blowing with nitrogen gas...|$|E
30|$|The {{contamination}} by {{the hydraulic}} oil {{was carried out}} with a syringe; a drop {{was placed on the}} sample and was subsequently wiped off with a conventional <b>lint-free</b> cloth. This procedure was repeated until no residues were {{visible to the naked eye}} and only an oil film remained. In order to have different levels of concentration, two different methods of wiping the oil off were applied, based on scenarios likely to be encountered during production. In the first method, the oil was wiped off with a little pressure, and in the other method, the pressure applied to the cloth was increased.|$|E
30|$|Approximately 2  mg of homogenized {{freeze-dried}} mango pulps {{were transferred}} to the DRIFT sample holder cup. The mixture filled the DRIFT accessory sample holder cup, and the top was leveled off. The samples were scanned in the mid-IR on a Bruker Fourier transform spectrometer (Alpha) equipped with a KBr detector (ICRAF laboratory). Samples were scanned from 4000 to 400  cm− 1 (2500 to 25, 000  nm) at 4  cm− 1 resolution and corrected against the background spectrum of the gold standard. The sample holder cup was cleaned between measurements with deionized water and dried with a <b>lint-free</b> tissue.|$|E
30|$|The {{characterization}} of the as-grown free-standing carbon black powder {{was carried out by}} field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM; JSM- 7600 -F, JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) operating at 10 -kV electron high tension coupled to an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX). The protocol used for the sample preparation prior to FESEM {{characterization of}} each sample is as follows: The <b>lint-free</b> glove was used when touching the sample, sample holder, or stage to avoid contaminant and moisture. Small amounts of as-grown free-standing carbon black powder were mounted using carbon tape (carbon tape sticks on the top surface of the sample holder). Since our sample has good electrical properties, it was not coated with gold or platinum. An EDX analysis was based on dot mapping, which depends on the sample structure, to investigate the elemental analysis of the sample.|$|E
30|$|For bonding of the {{polyethylene}} woven ribbon, {{the ribbon}} retainer was fabricated {{according to the}} manufacturer's instruction. The anterior segment was isolated by rubber dam. All the fibers were cut to the appropriate length, using a pair of special scissors (Ribbond fiber cutter, Ribbond; Seattle).This has been practiced in the laboratory by using dental floss on the plaster casts. The ribbon was pretreated with adhesive bis-GMA sealant (Fluoro Bond, Ormco), and the excess sealant was removed using <b>lint-free,</b> non-cotton gauze. Tooth conditioning and isolation, and bonding agent application and curing were {{carried out in the}} same way described for the multi-stranded retainers. The adhesive bis-GMA sealant (Fluoro Bond, Ormco) was applied on all teeth and light-cured with the light-emitting diode for 5 s per tooth, followed by the application of the Heliosit® orthodontic resin composite over the sealant. The ribbon was loosely adapted to the lingual surface of the anterior teeth and then bonded directly to each individual tooth passively. This was followed by the application of a thin layer of the Heliosit® orthodontic resin composite covering the fibers. Each tooth was light-cured for 10 s after adjusting the retainer correctly.|$|E
40|$|When {{covered by}} {{moistened}} <b>lint-free</b> gauze, the larvae (ammocoetes) of the lampreyGeotria australis survived, without apparent discomfort, for 4 days in water-saturated air at 10, 15 and 20 °C. In air, the mean standard rates of O 2 consumption of medium to large ammocoetes ofG. australis (000000000;= 0. 52 g) at 10, 15 and 20 °C were 14. 5, 35. 7 and 52. 1 μl·g− 1 ·h− 1, respectively. At 15 °C, {{the slope of}} the relationship between log O 2 consumption (μlO 2 ·h− 1) and log body weight for ammocoetes over a wide range in body weight was 0. 987. TheQ 10 s for rate of O 2 consumption between 10 and 15 °C, 15 and 20 °C and 10 and 20 °C were 4. 9, 2. 9 and 3. 6, respectively. Our results and observations of the ammocoetes suggest that, when out of water, larvalG. australis derives most of its O 2 requirements from cutaneous respiration, particularly at lower temperatures. This would be facilitated by the small size and elongate shape (and thus a relatively high surface-to-volume ratio), low metabolic rate, thin dermis, extensive subdermal capillary network and high haemoglobin concentration of larvalG. australis...|$|E
30|$|Cfree {{of seven}} PCBs (PCB 28, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153, 180) and 12 PAHs (phenanthrene, anthracene, fluoranthene, pyrene, benzo[a]anthracene, chrysene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, benzo[a]pyrene, indeno[cd- 1, 2, 3]pyrene, dibenzo[a]anthracene and benzo[ghi]perylene) were {{determined}} in pore water of sediment and SPM samples. Equilibrium sampling of HOCs in sediment and SPM was performed as described previously [2, 6] with minor modifications. Briefly, 7 – 10  g of thawed and homogenised sediments or SPM was filled in 12 -mL round-bottom glass vials with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) septum caps. Three 10 -cm SPME fibres (Fiberguide Industries Inc.) with a 10 -µm PDMS coating {{were placed in}} each vial. All vials were agitated on an overhead shaker in darkness at 20  °C for 14  days. SPME fibres were removed and immediately cleaned with Milli-Q water, dried with <b>lint-free</b> tissue and stored at −[*] 20  °C in pre-cleaned aluminium foil. The HOCs in the fibres were analysed using thermal desorption in a GC–MS system. After the measurement, analyte concentrations in PDMS (CPDMS) were calculated {{based on the measured}} length and the specific volume of the fibre (0.0877  µL cm− 1). Cfree was then calculated with Eq.  2 using PDMS to water partitioning coefficients (KPDMS:water) obtained from Witt et al. [8].|$|E
40|$|For {{the first}} time a {{biocompatible}} calcium carbonate vateritic polymorph was recrystallized from eggshell waste and its application for the extraction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in water samples was demonstrated. This nanoporous calcium carbonate was used as sorbent in dispersive micro-solid-phase extraction method. In this approach 50 [*]mg of the calcium carbonate material having about 25 [*]nm pores was placed in a 5 [*]mL of water sample and ultrasonicated for 30 [*]min. The cloudy sample was centrifuged at 13500 [*]rpm for 2 [*]min. The aqueous layer was then discarded and the CaCO 3 material was dabbed dry with a <b>lint-free</b> tissue. The analytes were then desorbed with 100 [*]μL of dichloromethane by ultrasonication for 5 [*]min. Finally, the extract was analyzed by gas chromatography flame ionization detector. Experimental parameters affecting the extraction recoveries were optimized. Using optimum extraction conditions, calibration curves were linear with correlation coefficients of 0. 9853 to 0. 9973 over the concentration range of 0. 05 to 30 [*]ng/mL. This method showed a detection limit as low as 0. 004 [*]ng/mL (at signal-to-noise ratio of 3). Performance of the dispersive micro-solid-phase extraction was compared with a previously optimized solid-phase extraction technique. The developed method displayed good extraction recoveries (85 ± 8 – 110 ± 4 %) with high enhancement factors (388 – 1433 -fold) and good repeatability (% RSD < 13) and involved the use of minimal solvents. Analysis of seawater from Dammam Port revealed the presence of the analytes at concentrations between 0. 15 ± 0. 01 and 13. 43 ± 1. 54 [*]ng/mL...|$|E
40|$|AB Purpose. To {{investigate}} pH and osmolality {{changes in}} the solutions stored in contact lens (CL) cases, when different case rinsing and drying methods are used on a daily basis. Methods. Four multipurpose solutions (Opti-Free Express, Solo-Care Aqua, Re-Nu Multiplus, and Complete) and two hydrogen peroxide systems (AOsept and Oxysept) were studied. Cases were filled with the solutions and kept sealed. After 8 h, the cases underwent different rinsing (rinsing; non-rinsing) and drying (air drying-AD; <b>lint-free</b> tissue drying-LFTD; non-drying-ND) procedures on a daily basis. Five cases of each rinsing/drying combination for each solution were evaluated. The pH and osmolality of the case-contained solution were evaluated on the 1 st, 7 th, 15 th, and then, 30 th day. Results. pH and osmolality increased significantly from day 1 to 30, except for Complete in which {{a significant decrease in}} pH was found. Rinsing vs. non-rinsing CL cases did not have any influence on the pH or osmolality, except for Oxysept, which showed a significantly higher osmolality value when cases were not rinsed. However, the drying procedure did influence both measurements; pH was significantly higher in the AD compared with the ND group (p < 0. 05), and {{there was a significant difference}} in osmolality between the three drying conditions (p < 0. 05), with the AD group showing the highest values, and the LFTD group showing the lowest. Conclusions. Osmolality and pH values are time and drying process-dependent in a CL case cleaning schedule. Regarding drying conditions, LFTD causes less increase in osmolality. Future studies should determine whether these changes might affect bacterial growth, lens parameters, or subject comfort during CL wear.

40|$|Abstract 1 -cell embryo {{transfer}} is best performed after allowing injected embryos a little recovery time in culture. This allows better {{evaluation of the}} cells' survival - {{those that have been}} damaged during the injection process will undergo cytoplasmic condensation, causing the cellular material to become less glossy and darker in color as the cytoplasm shrinks away from the zona pellucida. This should be balanced against the increased survival rate with decreased in vitro exposure. ### The Recipient Careful selection of the recipient is most important as the pups are the end result of a lot of hard work. I personally use Swiss Webster mice, as they are quiet and make excellent mothers, although do become overweight quickly and exhibit bad planes of anesthesia when heavy. This is also a very inexpensive mouse to use. As an alternate, another strain I have used with considerable success is B 6 D 2 F 1. These mice are hardy and display hybrid vigor. ### The Equipment For surgery, I clean (with 70 % alcohol) the following (all Roboz instruments) : 1. 5 pairs of forceps - 1 pair Pattern 3 c - 2 pairs Pattern 55 superfine - 1 pair straight serrated, 3. 5 " - 1 pair curved serrated, 3. 5 " - 1 pair of 3. 5 " sharp / sharp scissors (Surecut) - Autoclip metal wound clipper - 1 serafin clip - 1 mouth pipetter and hand-pulled transfer pipette ### The Anesthetic Avertin (2, 2, 2 tribromoethanol) is found to be quite effective. For method of preparation, see "Manipulating the Mouse Embryo", CSHL Press, ISBN 0 - 87969 - 384 - 3. Store wrapped in tin foil at 4 oC as this reagent is light sensitive. Test after making a new batch. Shake well before use. ### The Transfer 1. Select a mouse that has been plugged by a vasectomized male where the plug has been visualized in the early morning of the injection day. Do not use an mouse that appears lighter than 25 g, as underweight mice tend to re-absorb the embryos as they are not physically ready to support a pregnancy. Overweight mice can make surgery difficult by the absorption of anaesthetic into the fat reducing the potency of the anesthetic; also, the presence of fat means the presence of blood vessels, and cutting through all the extra fat causes a lot of unnecessary bleeding. This makes it difficult to see what you are doing and may also clog up the tip of your transfer pipette. - Anesthetise mouse with Avertin, administered intraperitoneally. After administering the anesthetic, put the mouse back into the cage from which it came. The mouse will be more relaxed when placed in a familiar environment and the anesthetic will act more quickly than it would on a distressed mouse. - To check that the mouse is fully anesthetised, press or squeeze the pads of the feet. If the mouse can feel this it will try to withdraw its leg from your grasp (Pedal reflex). Do not commence surgery until there is no reflex reaction to this test. - Take the anesthetised mouse and lay it on it's belly on a petri dish lid, taking care to keep the airway clear by resting the teeth {{on the edge of the}} petri dish. This makes it easier to move the mouse around without having to actually touch it. Swab the incision area with 70 % ethanol. ### The Surgery 1. Incision site Use the pair of Surecut scissors and one pair of serrated, curved forceps for cutting the skin. The incision should be made approximately 0. 5 cm away from the midline and between the natural hump of the back and the point where the rear leg joins the abdomen. Using a (<b>lint-free)</b> tissue dampened with 70 % ethanol, carefully wipe the incision site, sweeping away the cut hair. Wipe the scissors with a 70 % ethanol dampened tisue to remove any hair. Grasping one side of the incision at a time, carefully introduce the blades of the scissors (while closed) between the inside of the pelt and the body wall for approximately 1 cm. Open and close the blades to clear the connective tissue in this area. Move the skin around until the nerve (a white line, usually seen with associated capillary) can be seen running across the body wall. The light color of the ovarian fat pad can be seen under the body wall in this area. Using a pair of pattern 3 c forceps, pinch the body wall and nick to give an incision 0. 5 cm across. Reach in with the straight serrated forceps (while holding the body wall with another pair of curved forceps) and grasp the ovarian fat pad, and remove to the exterior where it can be anchored using a serafin clip. - Rest the serafin clip across the mouse's back to hold the uterus in place. If the uterus or uterine horn continually slip back into the cavity it may be necessary to gently lie the mouse on the side being careful not to block the airway. The transfer pipette should now be loaded. A minimum of 12 embryos total must be transferred, any less than this and the chances of a pregnancy resulting are severely reduced. Embryos may be implanted in both oviducts or unilaterally. The transfer pipette can be loaded a number of different ways; the following is one popular method. Take up an amount of Hepes buffered medium in the tip of the transfer pipette, then make a small bubble by taking up a little air. Then take up some more medium - roughly the same volume as the air bubble, then another air bubble, same size as before. Then take up about 2 - 3 cm of buffered media and then a tiny air bubble once more. Take your embryos in the smallest possible volume of medium, lining them up side by side in the transfer pipette. Introduce another tiny air bubble when all the eggs are loaded. Some people use mineral oil instead of or in conjunction with air bubbles for pressure control. This is a perfectly acceptable practice; however care must be taken to avoid introducing mineral oil into the oviducts as this can dramatically reduce litter size by interfering with the ciliary-driven egg transport in this structure, as well as predisposing the animal to uterine infection. - Bursa siteOnce the pipette is loaded and the uterus positioned, move the petri dish lid supporting the mouse to the microscope and turn on the overhead light source. Once the lights and focus have been adjusted and the mouse positioned to suit yourself, use the pattern 55 superfine forceps to gently tear open a small hole in the transparent bursa membrane at the point btween the ovary and oviduct where the infundibulum is located. Take care to avoid rupturing the small capillaries that run across the bursa as these will obscure your view of the infundibulum. You may drop some epinephrine on the ovary / oviduct / bursa before tearing the hole to reduce any bleeding that may occur. Once there is a hole of sufficient size to reach the infundibulum, grasp it at the end with one pair of pattern 55 forceps while inserting one blade of the other set into the tube itself. This will ensure that the mouth of the infundibulum will be open and accessible to your transfer pipette. Introduce the transfer pipette into the infundibulum as far as possible (until the tube's natural curve allows no more forward progress without risk of damage) and expel the eggs into the structure, chasing them with the air bubbles used for pressure regulation. These bubbles will prevent the eggs from flowing backwards easily and drive them forward into the ampulla region of the oviduct. - Wound clip With the transfer complete, the serafin clip can now be removed and the uterus gently eased back into the body. Do not touch the uterus, but ease it back by the edges of the incision in the body wall and allowing the uterus to fall back in, without actually handling it. This procedure is then repeated on the other uterine horn if doing a bilateral transfer. The incision in the body wall is not sutured. The skin is closed with Autoclips - two per incision is usually sufficient. Autoclip wound clips are used on the skin instead of suture as the mice frequently will chew at the suture thread and effectively open their wounds. - Once surgery is complete, the mouse is placed in a box of clean autoclaved sawdust. Under anesthetic, mammals are unable to retain heat as effectively as when conscious. For this reason, the mouse should be wrapped in a tissue to help keep it warm. Use of a heating pad or even indirect heat from a slide warmer can be used to care for the animal post-operatively until it regains conciousness. All animals should have recovered sufficiently from anesthetic before being returned to the animal room and left unattended. Recipient mice should be handled with care as pregnant mice become easily stressed, sometimes leading to abortion, or even cannibalism of pups. If all goes well and a pregnancy results, the pups should be born approximately 19 - 21 days after the transfer, dependent upon strain...|$|E
