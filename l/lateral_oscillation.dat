Furthermore, it was a number of other accidents involving suspected poor riding of CemFlo wagons that resulted in progressively more severe speed restrictions being placed on any trains containing this type. At the Thirsk crash, the oscillation built up to such a state that it eventually threw the rear wheel-set of one wagon off the rails, even though the train was travelling below the maximum 45 mph permitted for four-wheeled wagons. Indeed, the pronounced waddling of this very train was noted by the signalman at Pilmoor in his log as he recorded its passing about 6 minutes before the derailment. Also at Pilmoor, two men were watching the trains pass. One of them had noted that the leading wheel-set of a wagon [...] "somewhere just forward of the halfway point" [...] had dropped heavily into the gap on a cross-over then rebounded higher than the rest.

40|$|International audienceVariations of travel-times (TT), directions-of-arrival (DOA) and directions-of-departure (DOD) of {{acoustic}} {{waves are}} conventional observables used to recover information on local underwater sound speed perturbations. To compute these variations, acoustic waves are propagated between a source array and a receiver array, {{in both the}} unperturbed and perturbed states of the medium. The recorded signals undergo a two-step processing: 1) the acoustic-arrival separation and 2) the observable extraction, where precision is essential. We propose contributions for both steps. For the acoustic-arrival separation, we propose {{a version of the}} double beamforming (DBF) method, which we have modified by introducing oscillations along the angle dimensions. As suggested by studies done in the field of medical ultrasound imaging, <b>lateral</b> <b>oscillations</b> can be obtained in DBF by using specific aperture apodization functions. It has been shown that this feature facilitates the observable extraction later on. For the observable extraction, we propose two displacement estimators, both working with phase information.

These estimators have been tested on simulations with a double-array configuration. Different waves travelling through mediums having homogenous and inhomogeneous sound speed were considered.

40|$|Background: During lateral acceleration, the {{addition}} of an appropriate roll motion can improve comfort, but some combinations of lateral and roll motion increase motion sickness. Objectives: To determine how motion sickness caused by <b>lateral</b> <b>oscillation</b> fully compensated by roll oscillation (so subjects feel no lateral acceleration) depends on the frequency of oscillation and compare sickness with that caused by uncompensated <b>lateral</b> <b>oscillation.</b> Method: A total of 160 subjects (8 groups of 20) were exposed for 30 min to fully roll-compensated sinusoidal <b>lateral</b> <b>oscillation</b> at one of 8 frequencies (0. 05, 0. 08, 0. 125, 0. 16, 0. 20, 0. 315, 0. 5, 0. 8 Hz). A further 60 subjects (3 groups of 20) were exposed to <b>lateral</b> <b>oscillation</b> (at 0. 315, 0. 5, or 0. 8 Hz) to allow comparison of sickness with that caused by uncompensated <b>lateral</b> <b>oscillation</b> at frequencies not previously studied.

Results: With fully roll-compensated <b>lateral</b> <b>oscillation,</b> illness ratings tended to increase with increasing frequency of oscillation from 0. 05 to 0. 2 Hz (with peak lateral velocity, ± 1. 0 m · s? 1) and tended to decrease from 0. 315 to 0. 8 Hz (with peak lateral jerk, ± 1. 96 m · s? 3).

This paper presents a study of motion sickness with <b>lateral</b> <b>oscillation</b> at frequencies between 0. 0315 Hz and 0. 20 Hz. Method: there were 120 subjects, in 6 groups of 20, who were exposed for up to 30 min to sinusoidal <b>lateral</b> <b>oscillation</b> with a peak velocity of 1. 0 ms- 1 at one of six frequencies (0. 0315, 0. 05, 0. 08, 0. 125, 0. 16, 0. 20 Hz). Subjects provided ratings of their motion sickness symptoms at 1 -min intervals. Results: there was a highly significant effect of the frequency of <b>lateral</b> <b>oscillation</b> on the occurrence of mild nausea. Discussion: the present results have been combined with those from a previous experiment conducted with higher frequencies of oscillation to produce a frequency weighting for motion sickness caused by <b>lateral</b> <b>oscillation</b> over the range 0. 0315 to 0. 8 Hz.

Objectives: We investigated how motion sickness caused by combined lateral acceleration and roll displacement depended on the percentage compensation. Method: There were 8 groups of 20 subjects who were exposed for up to 30 min to various conditions of combined lateral and roll oscillation: 3 groups of 20 subjects experienced 0. 2 Hz oscillation with 1 of 3 compensations (0, 50, or 100 %) and 5 groups of 20 subjects experienced 0. 1 Hz oscillation with 1 of 5 compensations (0, 25, 50, 75, or 100 %). With both frequencies of sinusoidal oscillation, the peak Earth-lateral acceleration was 1. 26 m · s? 2. Subjects provided ratings of their motion sickness symptoms at 1 -min intervals. Results: The percentage compensation had significant effects on motion sickness.

40|$|Passengers of land {{transport}} {{are exposed to}} horizontal and rotational oscillations at frequencies less than 1 Hz which may cause vibration discomfort and motion sickness. Previous knowledge of human responses to motion is insufficient for predicting the discomfort caused by low frequencies. The objective of this thesis is to improve understanding of subjective responses to lateral and roll oscillation (presented in isolation and in combination) at frequencies less than 1 Hz {{in order to establish}} a predictive model of comfort. The first of five experiments tested the predictions of a conceptual model of motion sickness. Illness ratings were obtained over a 30 -minute exposure to 0. 2 Hz fully roll-compensated <b>lateral</b> <b>oscillation</b> where the point of full roll-compensation was either at the seat surface (i. e. ‘seat compensation’) or at head height (i. e. ‘head compensation’). Median illness ratings were greater during ‘head compensation’, showing some support for the motion sickness model, but differences were not statistically significant. Age, stature and body weight had no effect on illness ratings, but Asians were more than three-times as likely to experience ‘mild nausea’ than Europeans. It is concluded that differences in the position of full roll-compensation in transport vehicles are less important for motion sickness than inherent differences in passenger populations. The next four experiments used the method of magnitude estimation to determine the vibration discomfort caused by <b>lateral</b> <b>oscillation,</b> roll oscillation, and fully roll-compensated <b>lateral</b> <b>oscillation</b> with a variety of seating configurations. In the second experiment, lateral acceleration between 0. 2 and 1. 0 Hz caused less discomfort when sitting with a backrest than when sitting without a backrest on both a rigid seat and on a cushioned train seat; contrary to the predictions of current standards. In the third experiment, 0. 25 to 0. 4 Hz lateral acceleration in the plane of the seat caused similar discomfort regardless of whether the acceleration was due to <b>lateral</b> <b>oscillation</b> or roll oscillation through the gravitational vector, but above 0. 4 Hz, discomfort from the roll was far greater. At frequencies less than 0. 5 Hz, fully compensating the lateral acceleration with roll improved comfort compared to uncompensated lateral acceleration, but at greater frequencies, roll-compensation worsened comfort and caused discomfort similar to pure roll oscillation at 1 Hz. The fourth and fifth experiments examined differences in discomfort caused by the rigidity of the seat pan and the height of the backrest. In the fourth experiment, discomfort was greater on a soft foam seat than on a rigid seat during <b>lateral</b> <b>oscillation</b> below 0. 63 Hz, during roll oscillation below 0. 5 Hz and during fully roll-compensated <b>lateral</b> <b>oscillation</b> between 0. 315 and 0. 5 Hz. In the fifth experiment, discomfort was greater without a backrest than with a short backrest for <b>lateral</b> <b>oscillation</b> between 0. 315 and 0. 5 Hz. Contrary to current standards, discomfort was also greater without a backrest than with a high backrest for <b>lateral</b> <b>oscillation</b> below 1 Hz and for roll oscillation below 0. 5 Hz. In addition, sitting with a backrest was beneficial for comfort with fully roll-compensated <b>lateral</b> <b>oscillation</b> between 0. 4 and 0. 63 Hz. The results of the five experiments were collated to provide recommendations for the improvement of current vibration standards. On the basis of experiment 1, a new multiplying factor for the prediction of vomiting incidence in an unadapted group of male Asian adults is offered.

Seated subjects judged the discomfort caused by <b>lateral</b> <b>oscillation,</b> roll oscillation and fully roll-compensated <b>lateral</b> <b>oscillation</b> at each of seven frequencies (0. 25 - 1. 0 Hz). Irrespective of whether it was caused by pure lateral acceleration or gravitational acceleration due to pure roll, acceleration in the plane of the seat caused similar discomfort at frequencies less than 0. 4 Hz. From 0. 4 to 1. 0 Hz, with the same lateral acceleration in the plane of the seat, there was greater discomfort from roll oscillation than from lateral acceleration. With fully roll-compensated <b>lateral</b> <b>oscillation,</b> discomfort was less than with either the lateral component or the roll component of the motion from 0. 2 to 0. 5 Hz, but discomfort increased with increasing frequency and caused similar discomfort to pure roll oscillation at 1. 0 Hz.

40|$|At {{the request}} of the Air Material Command, U. S. Air Force, a {{theoretical}} study has been made of the dynamic lateral stability characteristics of the MX- 838 (XB- 51) airplane. The calculations included the determination of the neutral-oscillatory-stability boundary (R = 0), the period and time to damp to one-half amplitude of the <b>lateral</b> <b>oscillation,</b> end the time to damp to one-half amplitude for the spiral mode. Factors varied in the investigation were lift coefficient, wing incidence, wing loading, and altitude. The results of the investigation showed that the <b>lateral</b> <b>oscillation</b> of the airplane is unstable below a lift coefficient of 1. 2 with flaps. deflected 40 deg but is stable over the entire speed range with flaps deflected 20 deg or 0 deg. The results showed that satisfactory oscillatory stability can probably be obtained for all lift coefficients with the proper variation of flap deflection and wing incidence with airspeed. Reducing the positive wing incidence improved the oscillatory stability characteristics. The airplane is spirally unstable for most conditions but the instability is mild and the Air Force requirements are easily met...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{the quartz}} crystal {{microbalance}} (QCM) {{has been established}} as a sensitive analytical tool to monitor the attachment and spreading of mammalian cells to in vitro surfaces. Due to its superior time resolution, the device is capable of reading even subtle differences in cell adhesion kinetics. However, thickness shear mode piezoresonators, which are the core component of the QCM approach, can be used {{not only as a}} sensor but also as an actuator when the oscillation amplitude of the crystal is increased so that molecular recognition at the solid-liquid interface is disturbed. In this study, we have addressed the impact of elevated <b>lateral</b> <b>oscillation</b> amplitudes on the adhesion kinetics of three mammalian cell lines. We used AT-cut piezoresonators with a fundamental resonance frequency of 5 MHz, and the analytical readout was performed by impedance analysis. Formation of stable cell-substrate contacts is retarded or entirely blocked when the <b>lateral</b> <b>oscillation</b> amplitude (in the center of the resonator) exceeds values higher than 20 nm. Shear oscillations of similar amplitude were, however, not sufficient to displace attached cells from the surface. Moreover, the experimental data prove that the normal QCM readout with oscillation amplitudes smaller than 1 nm is, indeed, non-invasive with respect to mammalian cells...|$|E
50|$|In service, {{difficulty}} was {{experienced with}} the trailing bogie wheels fouling the firebox and {{the heads of}} stays and rivets. This was partially overcome by fitting stops to the engine frame, but this restriction of the sideways movement of the bogie wheels resulted in derailments in tight curves such as on diverging points. The engines performed well at relatively low speeds, but were prone to serious <b>lateral</b> <b>oscillations</b> at higher speeds. Cases of derailment on straight track at speed demonstrated the limitations of a design {{where there was no}} leading carrying wheel to stabilise the engine and considerable overhang of the cylinders.|$|R

The damping device has been applied to a modern fighter-type jet-powered airplane. The rudder was made to float with the relative wind by the addition of trailing-edge strips. In order to amplify the floating tendency (by reducing the restoring moment), a highly geared balancing tab was incorporated.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the estimated high-speed flying qualities of the Chance Vought XF 7 U- 1 airplane in the Mach number range from 0. 40 to 0. 91 has been made, based on tests of an 0. 08 -scale model of this airplane in the Langley high-speed 7 - by 10 -foot wind tunnel. The analysis indicates longitudinal control-position instability at transonic speeds, but the accompanying trim changes are not large. Control-position maneuvering stability, however, is present for all speeds. Longitudinal lateral control appear adequate, but the damping of the short-period longitudinal and <b>lateral</b> <b>oscillations</b> at high altitudes is poor and may require artificial damping...|$|R
