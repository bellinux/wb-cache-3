We find that, when firms sell products with the same reservation <b>price,</b> <b>loss-leader</b> <b>pricing</b> obtains only when differentiation is low. However, when reservation prices differ, equilibrium may entail <b>loss-leader</b> <b>pricing</b> when differentiation is high. This enables us to {{shed some light on}} the seemingly paradoxical empirical findings in the marketing literature that <b>loss-leader</b> <b>pricing</b> fails to increase store traffic, loss-leader sales and hence to increase profits.

40|$|When market {{information}} such as price is difficult to communicate, consumers and firms {{may be unable to}} take advantage of mutually beneficial scale economies so that coordination failures arise. Ostensibly uninformative advertising expenditures can be used to eliminate coordination failures by allowing an efficient firm to communicate implicitly that it offers a low price. This provides a theoretical explanation for L. Benham's (1972) empirical association of the ability to advertise with lower prices and larger scale. Advertising becomes necessary for optimal coordination when the identity of the efficient firm is uncertain. An application to <b>loss-leader</b> <b>pricing</b> is developed.

40|$|The authors study {{pricing and}} {{advertising}} strategies of retailers {{competing for the}} demand of an assortment of goods. In a model where uninformed rational consumers decide where to buy each product, they find that firms advertise prices below marginal cost to attract consumers into the store and profit from other goods that consumers plan to buy at the store. Incorporating product-line decisions indicates that firms do not restrict their product assortment even when they make a loss {{on one of the}} goods. Finally, products with lower reservation prices are shown to be more natural candidates for <b>loss-leader</b> <b>pricing.</b> Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press. ...|$|R
40|$|For many {{products}} {{the average price}} paid by consumers during peak demand periods is lower than traditional economic theory would predict. We use digital camcorder sales data to investigate supply-side and demand-side behavior to analyze the low average price phenomenon. This analysis is done on a consumer electronic good, which is extremely seasonal and rife with product entry and exit, unlike previous research in this area. We find that an increase in demand elasticity partially explains lower than expected average prices but not entirely. We are also able to rule out <b>loss-leader</b> and <b>price</b> rigidity theories of low prices. Finally, we find that entry and exit of camcorders does not significantly change average prices. ...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2013. Major: Economics. Advisor: Amil Petrin. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 70 pages, appendices A-C. This dissertation {{consists of two}} related chapters. In Chapter 1, I {{examine the effects of}} measurement errors in price expectation and shopping plans on the estimates of a consumer demand model. To this end, I estimate a household level store choice model in the supermarket industry. Errors in forecasting expected costs of planned shopping lists are prevalent in estimating a demand system for multi-product retail stores because price beliefs and shopping plans of individual households are not observed by researchers. Previous studies parsimoniously use realized shopping bundles as a proxy for the unobserved shopping list and assume homogeneous price expectation for all households and over the entire sample periods. This measurement errors introduce attenuation biases in the estimates of price elasticities toward zero. I improve on this approach in earlier studies by modeling endogenous shopping bundles by estimating good-household-time specific good purchase probability and quantity of purchased goods. I also construct household-time-store-good specific price expectation based on households' previous trips to the store. I show that heterogeneity in price expectation substantially reduces attenuation biases in the estimates of own price elasticities. In Chapter 2, I estimate the effects of pricing on storewide profitability in the supermarket industry. I use the estimated store choice model in Chapter 1 to measure the effects of price promotions on store choice decisions. Household-, time-, store-, and good-specific price expectation introduced in this model allows me to understand how price changes affect price beliefs of households over time and this facilitates measuring the dynamic effects of price promotions on store sales or profits. A straightforward extension of this analysis is to measure the effects of <b>loss-leader</b> <b>pricing</b> with price advertising of stores. I show that storewide effects of price discounts are larger and last longer when price promotions are offered for a long period and deteriorate over time. Also, price promotions more effectively attract customers to the store when they are applied {{to a wide variety of}} products even with a moderate level of price reduction than deeper price cuts over a small group of products. Lastly, feature advertising has substantial effects of boosting store traffics and this result supports the loss-leader stories where deep price cuts in a selected set of products lure customers to the store and improve storewide profits...|$|R
40|$|Alcohol Action Ireland, the {{national}} charity for alcohol-related issues, has welcomed {{the decision by}} the Government to increase excise duty on alcohol in Budget 2014, but has warned that tax alone cannot effectively target the very cheapest alcohol products being sold in the off-trade. “We welcome the increase in excise duty on a pint of beer or cider, and a standard measure of spirits by 10 cent and on a 75 cl bottle of wine by 50 cent. Following on from last year’s increases, we believe it will help contribute to a reduction in alcohol consumption in Ireland,” said Suzanne Costello, CEO of Alcohol Action Ireland. “Tackling pricing {{is one of the most}} effective ways a Government can reduce alcohol consumption and, simply put, if the price of alcohol goes up, alcohol-related harm – and the financial burden it places on the State - goes down,” said Ms Costello. “We have seen in the past that increases in excise duty have led directly to a reduction in alcohol consumption, while when excise duty has been cut, as it was in 2009, our alcohol consumption has increased. This shows just how important pricing is when trying to reduce alcohol-related harm. ” However, Ms Costello pointed out that even with an excise duty increase, large multiple retailers can still sell deeply discounted alcohol, such as “slabs” of cheap beer, as a draw to attract customers, absorbing the excise duty increases and off-setting it by increasing the prices of other goods. “Even when excise duty is increased, once the retailer pays the tax owed to the Government, they are under no obligation to pass this on to consumers, so alcohol could still be sold as a <b>loss-leader.</b> Minimum <b>pricing</b> would set a ‘floor price’ for alcohol that cannot be undercut,” said Ms Costello. “While tax affects all alcohol products and outlets – and therefore all consumers - minimum pricing directly targets the cheapest and strongest alcohol products, which are favoured by the most harmful drinkers and young people, so it would only affect the price of these very cheap products in the off-trade, primarily supermarkets, and would not have any affect the price of drinks in pubs, clubs or restaurants. “Minimum pricing has the potential to significantly reduce alcohol-related harm in Ireland, resulting in a reduction of the substantial costs incurred by the State and the number of lives lost due to alcohol in Ireland every year. It would do this by effectively targeting those drinkers choosing the cheapest and strongest alcohol products, who would benefit most from a reduction in their consumption, while having little or no effect on low-risk drinkers. ...|$|R
