From 1866 to 1869 he was also on the editorial staff of the Baltimore American. In June 1867, he was appointed Register in Bankruptcy, and as an early fruit of his studies published in 1868 a work on The Law and Practice of Bankruptcy, which became the leading textbook on that subject, and passed through ten editions in as many years. In 1870 he edited the U. S. Annotated Internal Revenue Laws, and in 1872 issued a valuable Treatise on Fraudulent Conveyances. He was also employed in 1872 to assist in the revision of the Statutes of the United States.

40|$|The <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> claim {{interpretation}} {{articulated by}} the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is commonly {{supposed to be}} markedly indeterminate, and {{to be responsible for}} a lack of certainty and predictability in patent infringement litigation. But there has been no attempt to measure objectively the indeterminacy associated with patent claim interpretation, or, for that matter, of any other field <b>of</b> <b>law.</b> This Article shows that under appropriate conditions the indeterminacy of a legal regime may be measured empirically by the frequency of judicial dissents. Application of this method to the Federal Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s jurisprudence demonstrates that while patent litigation as a whole is less determinate than other bodies <b>of</b> <b>law</b> overseen by the Federal Circuit, {{there is little or no}} evidence that claim interpretation is any more or less indeterminate than other aspects <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> <b>law</b> over time. Nor is the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> claim interpretation any less determinate than that of another interpretive regime, contract interpretation. When the indeterminacy <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> <b>law</b> is taken into account, the district courts perform as well, or better, than the specialized tribunals reviewed by the Federal Circuit. These findings call into question the notion that specialized trial courts are necessary to bring certainty or predictability to patent infringement litigation...|$|R
40|$|This essay raises {{questions}} about the Patent Harmonization Treaty. addressing the overall direction of harmonization in this country and the processes that are being applied to the harmonization effort. Section I of the essay compares the underlying goals of patent harmonization with those of the current United States patent system. The article contends that the legal rules relating to patents in this country evidence a specific intent to promote domestic industry. The aims of harmonization, in contrast, are fundamentally different. To be valid, then, patent harmonization may require a basic shift in the social consensus in this country concerning the use of patents. Section II examines the lawmaking processes that WIPO has used to arrive at the current text of the Patent Harmonization Treaty. The essay concludes that when viewed {{from the perspective of the}} national interests of the United States, WIPO 2 ̆ 7 s mechanisms have been neither careful nor inclusive. Section III addresses the general feasibility of using legislative lawmaking methods to define the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>patents</b> in this country. It argues that proper efforts to legislate harmonization are likely to be difficult and time consuming. The great majority of the current <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>patents</b> in the United States is the result of significant common law development. Recent legislation relating to patents has shown that legislated rules of patent law often have unintended effects. The current harmonization effort, moreover, is much more comprehensive than any patent legislation we have attempted to date. As a result, there are substantial reasons to decline the opportunity to design a harmonized set of patent laws through legislation...|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the present inquiry is to {{determine}} whether second thoughts support or undermine the instinctive supposition that the doctrines surrounding cooperative use <b>of</b> <b>patents</b> should be federal. The original creator <b>of</b> a <b>patented</b> invention is seldom in a position to exploit its commercial potential alone; even if the invention is created by the employee of a vast enterprise, it is almost inevitable that the patent will be assigned to his employer. Patent licensing plays a vitally important {{role in the development of}} many inventions. The contract doctrines surrounding such transactions, and various other consensual undertakings relating to patents, can obviously affect the value <b>of</b> the <b>patent</b> in significant ways. Unduly restrictive state laws, or wide divergences between the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> different states, could pose a very real danger of unduly diminishing the value <b>of</b> federally granted <b>patents.</b> And conversely, we are repeatedly reminded that there is a strong public interest in ensuring that private arrangements affecting patents not be allowed to make the patents too valuable by improperly increasing the rewards the patentee is able to extract from his statutory 2 ̆ 2 monopoly. 2 ̆ 2 To some extent, indeed, misuse and antitrust doctrines have already federalized the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> transactions in response to this second danger. Similar dangers of undue extension or restriction <b>of</b> <b>patent</b> rights, moreover, may be found whenever state courts rule on the scope or validity <b>of</b> a <b>patent...</b>|$|R
40|$|The <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>patents</b> {{has long}} {{struggled}} with the status of intent in determining liability for infringement. This struggle has recently been given a sharper edge {{by the emergence of}} biotechnological products with the inherent ability of auto-dispersal and regeneration. The question thus is whether a person on whose backyard a patented genetic organism has grown without the active intervention of that person is liable in infringement to the patentee of that organism. This article examines the ramifications of the legal conundrum and argues that upon a proper construction of the theories of liability in patent law, intent to infringe is necessarily crucial if the nature of the subject-matter of the patent makes it unjust and absurd to argue otherwise...|$|E

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the legal and}} policy deliberations on gene patenting that have occurred since the issue {{came to the fore}} in the early 1990 s.

In the interim, it is argued that other mechanisms are also available for dealing with gene patents, negating the desirability of a radical overhaul of gene patenting laws...|$|E
