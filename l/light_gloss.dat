2500|$|With the {{likelihood}} of the United States entering the war, and after experiments with various paint schemes conducted in association with the 1940 Fleet Problem (exercise), the Bureau of Ships (BuShips) directed in January 1941 that the peacetime color of overall #5 Standard Navy Gray, a <b>light</b> <b>gloss</b> shade with a linseed-oil base, be replaced with matte Dark Gray, #5-D, a new paint formulation with a synthetic alkyd resin base. [...] Rather than waste the large quantities of Standard Gray already in inventory and aboard ships, BuShips directed the issuance of a black tinting paste (5-BP) which when mixed in stated proportions with Standard Gray would yield a close approximation of 5-D, with issue of the new paint in pre-mixed form to follow. BuShips also issued Ship Camouflage Instructions (SHIPS-2), laying out 9 painting schemes to be used throughout the Navy. Rather than issue premixed quantities of the less-used new shades, Light Gray (5-L) and Ocean Gray (5-O), yards and supply depots were directed to issue an untinted base paint (5-U) together with a blue-black tinting material (5-TM) which when mixed according to instructions would turn 5-U into either Light or Ocean Gray.|$|E
30|$|Haku Maki is {{recognized}} as an innovator of Japanese woodblock printing techniques, and his prints are highly sought after. His use of bright colours, {{as well as his}} unusual embossing technique, creates works that blend traditional Asian subject matter with a fresh, visually appealing style. All of these artistic traits arise from a masterful manipulation of <b>light,</b> <b>gloss,</b> contrast, and color. However, in the works studied here, light scattering from a now dormant mold has compromised Maki’s aesthetic, and the removal of the fungi without impacting the underbound matte black paint remains a conservation challenge.|$|E
40|$|Wood {{finishes}} {{protect the}} surface of wood from external agents, enhance its looks and improve its gloss (luster). On constant external exposure, UV rays gradually degrade the film coating resulting in loss of gloss. In this study, two commonly used finishes namely spirit shellac and polyurethane finish were used to investigate the pattern of loss of gloss due to UV interference. Two coatings of polyurethane (PU) and spirit shellac finish were applied on {{the surface of}} eucalyptus samples. The gloss levels of these and unfinished samples were monitored for different times of exposure of them to UV <b>light.</b> <b>Gloss</b> was measured at 600 gloss head using a Tri micro gloss meter regularly for 20 hours durations of UV exposure. Observations and analysis revealed that the natural gloss of uncoated samples of eucalyptus were least affected on UV exposure with only 8, 3 %- 10 % loss in gloss. The PU and shellac coated surfaces also showed very little reduction in gloss (6, 9 %- 15, 4 %) most of which happened in the first 40 hours of exposure. Thus both the finishes in this study were found effective to a good extent in maintaining the gloss of the finished surface against exposure to UV light...|$|E

50|$|The {{appearance}} and {{perception of a}} tooth {{is the result of}} a complex interaction of factors such as lighting conditions, translucency, opacity, <b>light</b> scattering, <b>gloss</b> and the human eye and brain. Of these, the intrinsic pigmentation of a tooth is the most influential, which in turn is determined by genetic and natural factors. Light hitting a tooth undergoes reflection, absorption and transmission by varying degrees in each tissue layer of the tooth substance. Reflected light detected by the human eye determines the perceived appearance of a tooth.|$|R
50|$|The {{perception}} of tooth color {{is the result}} of a complex interaction of factors such as lighting conditions, translucency, opacity, <b>light</b> scattering, <b>gloss</b> and the human eye and brain. Teeth are composed of a surface enamel layer, which is whiter and semitransparent, and an underlying dentin layer, which is darker and less transparent. These are calcified, hard tissues comparable to bone. The natural shade of teeth is best considered as such; an off-white, bone-color rather than pure white. Public opinion of what is normal tooth shade tends to be distorted. Portrayals of cosmetically enhanced teeth are common in the media. In one report, the most common tooth shade in the general population ranged from A1 to A3 on the VITA classical A1-D4 shade guide.|$|R
60|$|His {{features}} and expression were genial and gentle, and yet {{his mouth was}} the cruellest gash I had ever seen in a man's face. It was a gash. There {{is no other way}} of describing that harsh, thin-lipped, shapeless mouth that uttered gracious things so graciously. Involuntarily I glanced at his hands. Like the mate's, they were thick-boned, broken-knuckled, and malformed. Back into his blue eyes I looked. On the surface of them was a film of <b>light,</b> a <b>gloss</b> of gentle kindness and cordiality, but behind that gloss I knew resided neither sincerity nor mercy. Behind that gloss was something cold and terrible, that lurked and waited and watched--something catlike, something inimical and deadly. Behind that <b>gloss</b> of soft <b>light</b> and of social sparkle was the live, fearful thing that had shaped that mouth into the gash it was. What I sensed behind in those eyes chilled me with its repulsiveness and strangeness.|$|R
50|$|The {{measurement}} scale, Gloss Units (GU), of a glossmeter is a scaling {{based on}} a highly polished reference black glass standard with a defined refractive index having a specular reflectance of 100GU at the specified angle.This standard is used to establish an upper point calibration of 100 with the lower end point established at 0 on a perfectly matte surface. This scaling is suitable for most non-metallic coatings and materials (paints and plastics) as they generally fall within this range. For other materials, highly reflective in appearance (mirrors, plated / raw metal components), higher values can be achieved reaching 2000 Gloss Units. For transparent materials, these values can also be increased due to multiple reflections within the material. For these applications {{it is common to}} use % reflection of incident <b>light</b> rather than <b>Gloss</b> Units.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of aging protocols on surface gloss of composites. Cylindrical resin composite specimens (6 [*]mm in diameter, 1 [*]mm thick) were fabricated and divided into three groups (N= 60) : microfilled (MiFi), nanohybrid (NaHy), and nanofilled (NaFi). Specimens were distributed into four aging subgroups: thermocycling (5 ° to 55 °C, 15, 000 cycles); ethanol immersion (15 days); brushing (10, 750 cycles); and light aging (216 [*]h). Surface gloss readings (Novo-Curve, Rhopoint TM, England) were performed at baseline (R 0) and after every one-third of aging protocols (R 1 to R 3). Data were submitted to one-way repeated measures ANOVA and Tukey’s test (5 %). Overall, surface gloss alterations were detected over time (p< 0. 001). Thermocycling reduced surface gloss, except for NaHy. Ethanol immersion resulted in surface gloss reduction after R 1 for MiFi and NaFi, while reduction after R 1 and R 2 was detected for NaHy. For brushing, gloss reduction was detected after R 1 and R 3 for all composites. For <b>light</b> aging, <b>gloss</b> was reduced after R 1 and R 2 for MiFi and NaFi, while a reduction only after R 1 was detected for NaHy.

5|$|In {{animals such as}} on the {{feathers}} of birds and the scales of butterflies, interference is created by a range of photonic mechanisms, including diffraction gratings, selective mirrors, photonic crystals, crystal fibres, matrices of nanochannels and proteins that can vary their configuration. Some cuts of meat also show structural coloration due to the exposure of the periodic arrangement of the muscular fibres. Many of these photonic mechanisms correspond to elaborate structures visible by electron microscopy. In the few plants that exploit structural coloration, brilliant colours are produced by structures within cells. The most brilliant blue coloration known in any living tissue {{is found in the}} marble berries of Pollia condensata, where a spiral structure of cellulose fibrils produces Bragg's law scattering of <b>light.</b> The bright <b>gloss</b> of buttercups is produced by thin-film reflection by the epidermis supplemented by yellow pigmentation, and strong diffuse scattering by a layer of starch cells immediately beneath.|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn the past, globes were {{varnished}} {{with natural}} resins that get brown and brittle during ageing. Their replacement sometimes appears necessary. This operation is invasive and risky, {{especially when the}} former varnish has penetrated into the paper. Paper sizing was commonly practiced before varnishing in order to limit the penetration of the varnish and thus facilitate its removal. This study aims to evaluate the efficiency of this operation, using purified bovine gelatine (Bloom 225) as a reference. All tests were performed on an original 18 th century laid paper. Sizing with 2 % to 6 % w/v gelatine solutions was tested in association with varnishes (Dammar, Regalrez® 1094, Laropal® A 81, Paraloid® B 72) and solvents (isopropanol, acetone, xylene, Shellsol® D 70) commonly used {{in the field of}} easel painting conservation. The affinity between the solvents and the paper was estimated by measuring the time necessary for a drop of solvent to be absorbed. The penetration of the varnish was estimated by transmitted <b>light</b> observation and <b>gloss</b> measurements. This work shows that sizing with a 4 % w/v gelatine solution effectively prevents the varnishpenetration into the paper.

40|$|Global {{production}} of coated paper for printing is currently about 45 - 50 million tonnes annually, with a predicted {{growth rate of}} between 3 and 4 %. In order to remain competitive, coated paper producers have had to increase productivity and reduce cost. One way this has been achieved is through developments in technology which make the papermaking, coating and finishing operations much more efficient. Coated papers give much better printing quality than uncoated grades. The coating layer {{is made up of}} mineral particles (kaolin and calcium carbonate) with a latex binder, formulated above the cpvc so that the pores are filled with air. This controls the ink setting process and generates <b>light</b> scattering and <b>gloss,</b> important for the appearance of the sheet. The coating layer is typically about 10 to 20 µm thick on a basepaper of thickness between 50 and 100 µm. In this paper we will illustrate some of the benefits to be obtained by reducing the physical impact of the coating application method on the basepaper. Starting from blade metering, the newer coating application methods including metered size press, spray and curtain coating will be compared. Blade metering applies a large stress on the basepaper.

40|$|The {{understanding}} of how human observers evaluate and interpret surface gloss has received increased attention during the last decades. Several studies were conducted that confirm the multi-dimensional nature of gloss perception [1 - 6]. From a study with digital image representations, Pellacini et al. [2] reported that two dimensions were sufficient to characterize apparent gloss differences; contrast gloss and distinctness of image gloss (DOI). In accordance with Pellacini et al., we recently showed that for high-gloss samples with invariant DOI, {{the contrast between the}} reflected image of the source and the sample background affects gloss perception. Consequently, the sample glossiness could be drastically influenced by introducing a light source that is positioned out of the specular field of view [7]. This notion agrees with other recent studies that emphasize the influence of the <b>light</b> field on <b>gloss</b> perception [8 - 10], and was further exploited in a magnitude estimation experiment from which a psychophysical scaling function was derived. The function relates visual gloss estimations to the measured luminance of both the reflected image and the off-specular sample background [11, 12]. In the present study samples with a different DOI are introduced, in order to investigate both the interaction between and the integration of multiple visual cues for the perception of surface gloss. Spectral and spatial reflectance characteristics of the samples are determined by measurement of the BRDF with a home-built spectroradiometer [13]. A test booth with two tunable light sources [7] is utilized to change the apparent gloss of the samples by adjusting the luminance of both the specular highlight and the sample background. This makes it possible to generate samples with conflicting cues, e. g. a strong highlight yet low DOI vs. a weak highlight yet high DOI. Through paired comparisons, the importance of each cue in the overall gloss evaluation process is investigated. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Viewing {{paintings}} and drawings is a dynamic experience where observers can move about the object discerning surface structure such as brushwork and gloss in addition to color and composition. Conventional studio photography reduces the experience to a single viewpoint where the photographer uses experiential learning and aesthetic judgments. This dissertation had several research goals: {{improving the quality of}} estimated surface normal maps using only four studio strobe lights, evaluating the viability of a virtual viewing experience using computer graphics rendering software, understanding how gloss and texture are perceived through psychophysical experiments, and using this understanding to inform image rendering using computer graphics or conventional photography. This research improved the four strobe imaging technique by replacing the previously used polarizers on the camera and strobes with a mathematical thresholding technique. This reduced the number of images required to estimate surface normal and diffuse color by half while creating surface normal and color maps {{that could be used in}} a rendering software to generate virtual fine art images. With the need to improve fine art rendering practices in mind, a series of psychophysical experiments were performed. Observers were asked to assess the amount of perceived gloss and texture in sets of images that used different lighting configurations of the same samples. It was determined that observers have difficulty separating gloss and texture while performing discrimination tasks. From the results of the observations, it is assumed that texture influences gloss perception largely at raking <b>lighting</b> angles and <b>gloss</b> influences texture perception primarily at near normal lighting angles. Further exploring the perceived amount of gloss and texture in fine art images with different lighting geometries, observers were asked to rate the aesthetic appeal of these images. On average, observers preferred images with small amounts of both perceived gloss and texture. This research resulted in a successful imaging and rendering protocol that used a limited amount of studio equipment without sacrificing the capture of surface texture information as well as additional knowledge regarding the desirable amount of perceived gloss and texture that can be used in making lighting and rendering choices that are pleasing to observers while still representing the physical features of a work of art...|$|R
40|$|Coating {{shrinkage}} upon drying is {{a phenomenon}} well known to the paper coating industry, where it often causes changes in the final structure of the coating layer leading to poor results in terms of <b>gloss,</b> <b>light</b> scattering, surface strength, coverage, uniformity and printability. Such shrinkage has in previous studies been wrongly associated with shrinkage of the polymeric binders used in the coating formulation, by making erroneous comparison with solvent-based paint systems. Natural binders, as starch or proteins, which come from renewable resources and are therefore environmentally friendly, suffer more from this shrinkage phenomenon than synthetic binders. The aim of this research project was to improve {{the understanding of the}} processes involved in the drying of a coating layer and to create a model able to describe them. Shrinkage while the coating layer dries has been successfully measured by observing the deflection of coated strips of a synthetic elastically-deformable substrate. Ground calcium carbonate was used as the coating pigment, together with latex binders of both low and high glass transition temperature, Tg, respectively, and also with starch which is a natural film-forming water soluble binder. The final dry coatings were studied with mercury porosimetry and by scanning electron microscopy in order to characterise their porous structure. The flow and rheological properties of the coating colour formulations were measured in order to probe the particle-particle interaction between the different species in the wet coating colour. The void space of the dry coating layers was modelled using Pore-Cor, a software which generates simulated porous networks. A new algorithm was developed to model, within the simulated void space, the effective particles or "skeletal elements" representative of the solid phase of the dried porous system. The water-filled porous structures {{at the beginning of the}} shrinkage process (first critical concentration, FCC) were subsequently modelled by creating Pore-Cor structures with the same solid skeletal elements distribution as at the second critical concentration (at which the particles lock their positions), but with higher given porosity to account for the water present The capillary forces acting on the surface of the simulated coating were calculated, and found to be several orders of magnitude larger than the measured shrinkage forces. The shrinkage process was thus described as resulting from the effect of capillary forces in the plane of the coating layer resisted by a stick-slip process, where the capillary forces yield shrinkage only if a resistance force within the drying coating layer holds the structure in place and allows the menisci to form. The stick-slip theory was strongly supported by quantitative comparisons between the experimental forces required to intrude mercury, and the capillary forces within the simulated void structure.
