40|$|Information on {{nutritive value}} of locally {{available}} feed ingredients is scarce, therefore chemical composition, TAA, ANF and OSI for eleven feed ingredients {{commonly used in}} Tanzania were determined. Standard AOAC Official Methods were performed at the US headquarters of Novus International, Inc. The ingredients were cereals/byproducts (BR, RS, WS 1, WS 2 and MB), <b>leaf</b> <b>meals</b> (MOLM, GLM and LLM) and oil seed meals/by products (SBM, SCM and CSM). Significant differences for CP, NDF, ADF, minerals, TAA and ANF were observed between nutrient groups. Apart from energy most of the chemical components were lower in cereals; CP and TAA were highest in SBM. CSM contained the highest fat content (35. 82 %) with high oleic (22. 63 %) and linoleic (50. 59 %). The observed chemical differences between (BR and MB) were probably due to their differences in physical composition. Low levels (Ca, Na and P) and EAA were noted in all groups emphasizing the need of using synthetic sources during feed formulation. Total phenols and tannins were (7. 71 - 7. 26 %) and (2. 55 - 1. 02 %) for GLM and RS, respectively, but negligible in other feed ingredients. Both HCN and OSI were highest in <b>leaf</b> <b>meals</b> but negligible in other feed ingredients. The chemical composition of ingredients obtained {{in this study was}} comparable to values reported elsewhere. This means that optimum diets for livestock can be formulated using ingredient values from established tables and other sources.

40|$|Poultry {{can be an}} {{important}} source of food following drought and crop failure. Unfortunately, reduced staple crop production also affects the chickens so that they become scrawnier and less able to produce eggs thereby detracting from their potential contribution to human diet. The article below suggests one rather innovative means by which the nutrition of poultry may be safeguarded in times of drought and food scarcity. Eds Chickens are unable to manufacture 10 necessary amino acids or the B vitamins. 1 They therefore require a diet high in protein. In addition, they require fats and carbohydrates, and cannot exist on high fibre diets. When NGOs or the FAO have taken a role in the improvement of family poultry farming in the developing world, the diet endorsed is varied, comprised of grains and tubers "for energy " (millet, sorghum, maize, sweet potatoes, and even cassava); meals for protein (sunflower cake, fish meal, cotton seed cake, maize germ, soya cake, meat and bone meal) and vegetables "for vitamins " (green grass, green kale, and cabbage) 2 and green seaweed. 3 The grains are given as a supplement to foraging 4 with millet recommended as the best grain for protein supplementation in chickens. Where these are unavailable, <b>leaf</b> <b>meals</b> have been used, 5 and recent research suggests that the seeds of the Croton tree are valuable in supplying necessary oils and proteins. 1 In the search for less expensive, natively available food for chickens, recent studies suggest that tobacco seed cakes, 6 or even molasses from sugar cane residue, 7 can be reasonably and productively utilised, and that meal from azolla, snails or rice polishings are comparable to maize-soybean meal diets. 8 In Haiti, however, farmers often are unable to purchase any form o...|$|R

The TLM contained from 8 · 5 to 12 · 0 MJ digestible energy per kg dry matter (DM) and from 60 to 125 g digestible protein per kg DM. The digestibility was not affected (P. 0 · 05) by their rate of incorporation in the diet. The apparent ileal protein digestibility of the diets containing 300 g TLM per kg was also determined by the slaughtering method. It reached 80 % for the basal diet and 54, 70 and 74 % for the Trichanthera-, mulberry- and cocoyam-based diets, respectively. No diet effect (P. 0 · 05) was observed on the weight and length of the gastro-intestinal tract, {{with the exception of}} a heavier caecum in sows given the Trichanthera-based diet (P, 0 · 01).

Early studies on the nutrient requirements were mainly on protein, lipid and carbohydrate. Studies on essential amino acids and fatty acids, and optimum proteln:energy ratio in the diets for cultured species were conducted later. Likewise, requirements for other essential nutrients in shrimps, like phospholipid and cholesterol, were studied. Dietary calcium and phosphorus required to prevent soft-shelled shrimps were determined. Requirements for water-soluble vitamins and bioavailability of stable forms of vitamin C were evaluated. Little is known of the vitamin and mineral requirements. The major digestive enzymes in milkfish have been studied. The apparent digestibility of common feedstuffs were determined in vivo and in vitro for milkfish and tiger shrimp, and presently, for sea bass.

40|$|Fish {{production}} from aquaculture in Asia has steadily increased {{during the past}} decade. In 2012, Asia s share in the total world aquaculture production was about 89 % with 60 M metric tons valued at US$ 120 B. ASEAN Member States such as Viet Nam, Indonesia, Thailand, Myanmar, and the Philippines are among the top producers in Asia contributing 9 M metric tons of {{production from}} aquaculture valued at US$ 19 B (FAO, 2014). To sustain the production and profitability of aquaculture operations, reducing costs is needed mainly through feeds and feeding which represent up to 60 % of operational costs. Reductions in feeding costs can be realized through optimizing nutrient levels of diets, feeding strategies, and by using plant protein sources as fish meal substitutes. As more intensive methods for production {{of the top five}} commodities (carps, tilapia, milkfish, catfish, and Pangasius sp.) become popular in ASEAN Member States, practical feeds need to be formulated using plant protein sources that are locally available. Plant protein sources such as soy proteins and corn gluten have been used as partial or total replacements for fish meal quite extensively in aquafeed for the top aquaculture commodities because of their high protein content (40 - 60 %) and good digestibility. Other alternative dietary protein sources with emphasis on oilseed meals, peas and other leguminous seed <b>meals,</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>meals</b> from terrestrial plants, aquatic plants, plant protein concentrates, single cell proteins, cereal by products, fermentation and other products have been or are currently being evaluated as fish meal substitutes for their nutritive values, inclusion levels, constraints in processing mainly to reduce the effects of anti-nutritional factors as well as economic value. The proper use of these ingredients would promote good fish growth, survival, production, and boost the income of small scale farmers. Testing of aquaculture feeds containing these local ingredients will help the regional as well as worldwide research and development efforts and ultimately benefit the local small scale fish farmers and other stakeholders...|$|R
40|$|The {{growth rate}} and {{survival}} of two white shrimps, Penaeus indicus and P. merguiensis, fed diets in which fishmeal was partially replaced with plant protein sources were investigated in three trials. In trial 1 with P. indicus, soybean, yeast and <b>leaf</b> <b>meals</b> of kangkong, papaya and Cassia tora L. were screened as partial substitutes for fishmeal. The total biomass of shrimp fed 20 % yeast (20 yeast) was highest but {{not significantly different}} than that of shrimp fed 10 yeast and 10 papaya. Survival was highest with 20 yeast, 10 papaya and 10 yeast. Shrimp fed Cassia tora L. had the highest weight gain and SGR but their survival was similar to those fed poor performing diets. In trial 2 with P. merguiensis, the ingredients were modified by decreas- ing fishmeal and increasing the yeast and soybean substitution. The biomass of the shrimp fed 10 yeast {{was similar to that}} of the shrimp fed 20 yeast and 26 soybean, the weight gain and SGR were similar to shrimp fed 20 yeast while survival was highest but not different from 20 yeast and 26 soybean. In trial 3 with P. indicus, weight gain and SGR were best with 20 yeast and 34 soy- bean. However, biomass and survival did not differ among replacement levels. The performance of the white shrimp varied with different levels of yeast and soybean meal incorporation. The response of P. indicus was best with 20 yeast (15 % by weight) or 34 soybean meal (34 % by weight) while that of P. merguiensis was with 10 yeast (7 % by weight), 20 yeast (15 % by weight) or 26 soybean meal (26 % by weight). Partial replacement of fishmeal with yeast or soybean meal would result in lower feed costs but the use of these feeds needs further refine- ment since survival was low in all treatments. Rearing techniques, such as increasing the feed- ing frequency, simulating deep pond conditions or using adequate substrates, should be refined...|$|R
