5|$|The {{interior}} region bordering Spanish and Portuguese territories in South America was <b>largely</b> <b>unexplored</b> {{at the end}} of the 17th century. Dispatched by the Spanish Crown, Jesuits explored {{and founded}} eleven settlements in 76 years in the remote Chiquitania – then known as Chiquitos – on the frontier of Spanish America. They built churches (templos) in a unique and distinct style that combined elements of native and European architecture. The indigenous inhabitants of the missions were taught European music as a means of conversion. The missions were self-sufficient, with thriving economies, and virtually autonomous from the Spanish crown.|$|E
5|$|The {{synthesis}} of the heavy isotopes 294Lv and 295Lv could be accomplished by fusing the heavy curium isotope curium-250 with calcium-48. The cross section of this nuclear reaction would be about 1picobarn, {{though it is not}} yet possible to produce 250Cm in the quantities needed for target manufacture. After a few alpha decays, these livermorium isotopes would reach nuclides at the line of beta stability. Additionally, electron capture may also become an important decay mode in this region, allowing affected nuclei to reach the middle of the island. For example, 295Lv would alpha decay to 291Fl, which would undergo successive electron capture to 291Nh and then 291Cn which is expected {{to be in the middle}} of the island of stability and have a half-life of about 1200years, affording the most likely hope of reaching the middle of the island using current technology. A drawback is that the decay properties of superheavy nuclei this close to the line of beta stability are <b>largely</b> <b>unexplored.</b>|$|E

40|$|The ‘rollback argument,’ {{pioneered by}} Peter van Inwagen, purports {{to show that}} indeterminism in any form is {{incompatible}} with free will. The argument has two major premises: the first claims that certain facts about chances obtain in {{a certain kind of}} hypothetical situation, and the second that these facts entail that some actual act is not free. Since the publication of the rollback argument, the second claim has been vehemently debated, but everyone seems to have taken the first claim for granted. Nevertheless, the first claim is totally unjustified. Even if we accept the second claim, therefore, the argument gives us {{no reason to think that}} free will and indeterminism are incompatible. Furthermore, seeing where the rollback argument goes wrong illuminates how a certain kind of incompatibilist, the ‘chance-incompatibilist,’ ought to think about free will and chance, and points to a possibility for free will that has remained <b>largely</b> <b>unexplore...</b>|$|R

5|$|Recently, {{several studies}} have shown that archaea exist not only in {{mesophilic}} and thermophilic environments but are also present, sometimes in high numbers, at low temperatures as well. For example, archaea are common in cold oceanic environments such as polar seas. Even more significant are the large numbers of archaea found throughout the world's oceans in non-extreme habitats among the plankton community (as part of the picoplankton). Although these archaea can be present in extremely high numbers (up to 40% of the microbial biomass), almost none of these species have been isolated and studied in pure culture. Consequently, our understanding of the role of archaea in ocean ecology is rudimentary, so their full influence on global biogeochemical cycles remains <b>largely</b> <b>unexplored.</b> Some marine Crenarchaeota are capable of nitrification, suggesting these organisms may affect the oceanic nitrogen cycle, although these oceanic Crenarchaeota may also use other sources of energy. Vast numbers of archaea are also found in the sediments that cover the sea floor, with these organisms making up the majority of living cells at depths over 1 meter below the ocean bottom. It has been demonstrated that in all oceanic surface sediments (from 1000- to 10,000-m water depth), the impact of viral infection is higher on archaea than on bacteria and virus-induced lysis of archaea accounts for up to one-third of the total microbial biomass killed, resulting in the release of ~0.3 to 0.5 gigatons of carbon per year globally.|$|E

40|$|Background Bile salts are {{produced}} and secreted by {{the liver and}} are required for intestinal absorption of fatty food components and excretion of endobiotics and xenobiotics. They are reabsorbed in the terminal ileum and transported back to the liver via the portal tract. Dedicated bile salt transporters in hepatocytes and enterocytes {{are responsible for the}} unidirectional transport of bile salts in the enterohepatic cycle. Aim To give an overview of the function and regulations of proteins involved in bile salt synthesis and transport. Methods Data presented are obtained from PubMed-accessible literature combined with our own recent research. Result Hepatocytes and enterocytes contain unique bile salt importers (sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide and apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter, respectively) and exporters (bile salt export pump and organic solute transporter alpha-beta, respectively). Enzymes involved in bile salt biosynthesis reside in different subcellular locations, including the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, cytosol and peroxisomes. Defective expression or function of the transporters or enzymes may lead to cholastasis. The bile salt-activated transcription factor Farnesoid X receptor controls expression of genes involved in bile salt biosynthesis and transport. Conclusions Detailed knowledge is available about the enzymes and transporters involved in bile salt homeostasis and how their defective function is associated with cholestasis. In contrast, the process of intracellular bile salt transport is <b>largely</b> <b>unexplore...</b>|$|R

25|$|During {{the tenure}} of mayor Dragan Đilas (2008–13), the idea of {{expanding}} the zoo to Donji Grad, which it occupied prior to the World War II, resurfaced, but the experts were against it. The urban plan for the fortress from 1965 already projected the complete relocation of the zoo outside of the fortress, {{on some of the}} suburban locations, which in later plans included Veliko Blato, Stepin Lug or Jelezovac. The expansion of the zoo would cut the pedestrian communication between the Danube's and Sava's parts of the fortress, which was already cut in 1949 but was restored in 2009 with the reconstruction and opening of the Sava Gate. Also, it would prevent the exploration of Donji Grad, which is still <b>largely</b> <b>unexplored</b> and leave the Gate of Charles VI, a masterpiece of Balthasar Neumann, within the zoo itself. As of 2017, the zoo was not relocated but the idea of expansion was dropped, too.|$|E
25|$|Germany had {{established}} a protectorate over Kamerun by 1884 during the Scramble for Africa. In 1911, France ceded Neukamerun (New Cameroon), a large territory {{to the east of}} Kamerun, to Germany {{as a part of the}} Treaty of Fez, the settlement that ended the Agadir Crisis. In 1914, the German colony of Kamerun made up all of modern Cameroon as well as portions of Nigeria, Chad, Gabon, the Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic. Kamerun was surrounded on all sides by Allied territory. British-held Nigeria was to the north-west. The Belgian Congo bordered the colony to the south-east and French Equatorial Africa lay in the east. The neutral colony of Spanish Guinea was bordered by German Kamerun on all sides but one, which faced the sea.

In 1911–1912 the border with the French colonies of Gabon, Middle Congo, Ubangi-Shari and Chad was established and in 1913 the border between the colonies of Nigeria and Kamerun was defined.|$|E
25|$|Nonlinear {{two-dimensional}} {{infrared spectroscopy}} is the infrared version of correlation spectroscopy. Nonlinear two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy {{is a technique}} that has become available {{with the development of}} femtosecond infrared laser pulses. In this experiment, first a set of pump pulses is applied to the sample. This is followed by a waiting time during which the system is allowed to relax. The typical waiting time lasts from zero to several picoseconds, and the duration can be controlled with a resolution of tens of femtoseconds. A probe pulse is then applied, resulting in the emission of a signal from the sample. The nonlinear two-dimensional infrared spectrum is a two-dimensional correlation plot of the frequency ω1 that was excited by the initial pump pulses and the frequency ω3 excited by the probe pulse after the waiting time. This allows the observation of coupling between different vibrational modes; because of its extremely fine time resolution, {{it can be used to}} monitor molecular dynamics on a picosecond timescale. It is still a <b>largely</b> <b>unexplored</b> technique and is becoming increasingly popular for fundamental research.|$|E
