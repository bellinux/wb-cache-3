5|$|Han van Meegeren {{knew that}} white <b>lead</b> <b>was</b> used during Vermeer’s time, {{but of course}} he had to obtain his stocks through the modern colour trade, which had changed {{significantly}} since the 17th century. During Vermeer’s time, Dutch <b>lead</b> <b>was</b> mined from deposits located in the Low Countries; however, by the 19th century, most <b>lead</b> <b>was</b> imported from Australia and the Americas, and differed from the white lead that Vermeer would have used both in the isotope composition of the lead and in the content of trace elements found in the ores. Dutch white <b>lead</b> <b>was</b> extracted from ores containing high levels of trace elements of silver and antimony, while the modern white lead used by Van Meegeren contained neither silver nor antimony, as those elements are separated from the lead during the modern smelting process.|$|E
5|$|By lap 56, Harvick and Labonte {{were running}} in nineteenth and twentieth, while Stewart's <b>lead</b> <b>was</b> 1.7 seconds by lap 63. Three laps later, Kahne's car {{suffered}} an engine problem, causing the first caution of the race. During the caution, {{all of the}} leaders elected to make pit stops. Montoya reclaimed the lead during the caution and maintained it at the restart. On lap 79, Jeff Gordon passed Martin for the seventh position. By the 83rd lap, Montoya's <b>lead</b> <b>was</b> 1.8 seconds over Stewart. Two laps later, the second caution was given because of debris on the track at turn three. None of the leaders elected to make pit stops. Montoya maintained his lead at the restart, followed by Stewart and Hamlin.|$|E
5|$|In the New World, <b>lead</b> <b>was</b> {{produced}} {{soon after}} the arrival of European settlers. The earliest recorded lead production dates to 1621 in the English Colony of Virginia, fourteen years after its foundation. In Australia, the first mine opened by colonists on the continent was a lead mine, in 1841. In Africa, lead mining and smelting were known in the Benue Trough and the lower Congo Basin, where <b>lead</b> <b>was</b> used for trade with Europeans, and as a currency by the 17th century, well before the scramble for Africa.|$|E

40|$|HTS <b>leads</b> <b>are</b> {{increasingly}} used on superconducting magnets. In {{most cases the}} magnet <b>leads</b> <b>are</b> shielded from the magnetic field by iron or the magnet is actively shielded, so that the stray field at HTS <b>leads</b> <b>is</b> low. There are magnets where the HTS <b>leads</b> must <b>be</b> located in a magnetic field. The two general types of HTS <b>leads</b> that <b>are</b> commercially available <b>are</b> either <b>leads</b> fabricated from bulk HTS materials or leads fabricated from oriented HTS materials that {{have one or two}} planes of favorable current density.

5|$|Alexis Sánchez was one {{of three}} players who made their {{competitive}} debuts for Arsenal in the match; for Manchester City, goalkeeper Willy Caballero was selected ahead of Joe Hart. Arsenal began the game more strongly and took the lead when Santi Cazorla scored in the 22nd minute. Their <b>lead</b> <b>was</b> extended two minutes before half time, as Aaron Ramsey finished off a counter-attacking move. Arsenal scored their third of the match soon after the hour mark; Olivier Giroud's shot from outside the penalty box dipped over Caballero and into his goal.|$|E
5|$|Another {{high-profile}} clash came {{more than}} 20 years later, {{in the final}} of the FA Cup on 12 May 1979. A capacity crowd saw Arsenal take a 2–0 lead in the first half thanks to goals from Brian Talbot and Frank Stapleton, and with just five minutes left on the clock their <b>lead</b> <b>was</b> still intact. Then, in the 86th minute, Gordon McQueen pulled a goal back for United, and two minutes later they equalised with a goal from Sammy McIlroy. However, barely a minute after United equalised, Arsenal's Alan Sunderland scored an 89th-minute goal to win the cup 3–2 for Arsenal.|$|E

5000|$|In {{contract}} bridge, the Rule of 10-12 {{is applied}} when the opening <b>lead</b> <b>is</b> {{the third or}} the fifth best from the defender's suit. By subtracting the rank of the card led from 10 or 12 respectively, a defender can determine how many cards are higher than the card partner has led. Ten is used if the <b>lead</b> <b>is</b> fifth best [...] and 12 is used if the <b>lead</b> <b>is</b> the third best. The Rule of 11 applies when the <b>lead</b> <b>is</b> the 4th best.|$|R

5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the race, Michael Schumacher's remained the leader in the World Drivers' Championship though his <b>lead</b> <b>was</b> reduced by ten points to twelve. Coulthard's victory moved him into second place on 34 points, ahead of teammate Häkkinen on 29 points. Barrichello and Fisichella remained fourth and fifth, with 22 and 14 points respectively. In the World Constructors' Championship, McLaren reduced the lead of Ferrari to five points. Benetton in fourth closed the points gap to their rivals Williams to one point. Jordan remained fifth on 9 points, with ten races of the season remaining.|$|E
5|$|Blitz {{conceived}} a rough storyline for {{the film}} while making Spellbound, a documentary about 1999's Scripps National Spelling Bee, but an HBO Films executive persuaded him to write the film based on his own adolescence {{when he told her}} about his experiences as a stutterer. The film's producers visited several cities in the United States and Canada; Thompson was cast based on a tape which his agent had sent and a follow-up audition after the first actor cast in the <b>lead</b> <b>was</b> forced to pull out. The film was shot over 30 days in Baltimore, Maryland and Trenton, New Jersey.|$|E

5|$|Research on a cleaner, less {{energy-intensive}} lead {{extraction process}} continues; a major drawback is that either too much <b>lead</b> <b>is</b> lost as waste, or the alternatives {{result in a}} high sulfur content in the resulting lead metal.

The race restarted on lap 162 with Biffle in the lead, ahead of Kenseth and Jeff Gordon. By the 190th lap, Biffle's <b>lead</b> <b>was</b> three seconds.|$|E

Alabama opened a 21–0 lead after the first quarter with {{touchdown}} scores on their first three offensive possessions. Touchdowns were scored on a nine-yard Mark Ingram run, a 68-yard Julio Jones reception from Greg McElroy and on a 12-yard Darius Hanks reception from McElroy.

5|$|In {{the same}} year, hostility towards Dissenters increased. A Bill against {{occasional}} conformity was {{passed through the}} House of Commons and debated in the Lords. Figures such as Henry Sacheverell, a High church clergyman, warned against Dissenters assuming positions of political power.

In December, Defoe published his own pamphlet, The Shortest Way, assuming the same stylistic conventions as the Sacheverell and the Tory publications.|$|E

5|$|Most drivers {{stayed on}} the track during the caution, {{allowing}} Bowyer to remain the leader on the restart. On lap 48, Michael McDowell drove to the garage because of engine problems. Five laps later, Bowyer led the race, with McMurray 1.3 seconds behind him. Landon Cassill went to the garage due to failing brakes on lap 56. Johnson moved into sixth, as Edwards passed McMurray five laps later for second. By lap 64, Bowyer's <b>lead</b> <b>was</b> over 3.5 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The 20th century saw an {{increase}} in worldwide lead exposure levels due to the increased widespread use of the metal.

Blood lead levels worldwide have been declining sharply since the 1980s, when leaded gasoline began to be phased out.
