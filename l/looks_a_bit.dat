5|$|Madonna looks both {{older and}} younger than she does in the photos and the videos: a little more lined and {{possibly}} tired, but also less mature and grand. Her manner is quite teenaged, not femme fatale. She seems up for mischief, and yet quite conscious of her power. At the same time, her very frankness is almost innocent. These combinations are odd, and they give her {{the air of a}} prematurely wise child. Her current style is 1930s Hollywood meets early 1970s flash: Jean Harlow and Angie Bowie. She is not bewitching, but is certainly beautiful. She wears the nose stud that so troubled Norman Mailer in a recent interview. If you saw her in the street, you'd think: she looks like a girl who <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> like Madonna.|$|E
25|$|The 200 to 350foot (60 to 105m) thick Brushy Basin Member is {{composed}} of claystone, mudstone, and siltstone with small amounts of conglomerate and sandstone. Clays in this member are rich in smectite and thus tend to swell when wet and dry to a crumbled surface that <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> like popcorn. Fossilized dinosaur bones are abundant in this member in several places located in Utah and western Colorado. The bones are usually scattered and are thus hard to identify but nearly complete skeletons {{have been found in}} lake floor and flood-plain clays. Good exposures of the Brushy Basin Member {{can be seen in the}} Bentonite Hills.|$|E
500|$|The book's {{endpapers}} {{had been}} overlooked. Potter {{wrote to the}} firm: [...] "I conclude {{there is no time}} to get an end-paper design done—unless Mr. Stokoe has already designed one—I do not mind one way or another; I had begun to scribble something but it <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> stiff." [...] Mr. Stokoe apparently did not design one because the endpapers were either plain white or mottled lavender. Several years later, they were replaced with a design featuring a pie and a patty-pan and the cover illustration changed to Ribby sitting by the fire. In the 1930s, the book's size was reduced to bring it into line {{with the rest of the}} Peter Rabbit books. The title was changed at that time to The Tale of the Pie and the Patty-Pan.|$|E

500|$|Y and H {{cylinder}} valves {{have two}} outlets, {{each with its}} own valve, allowing two regulators to be connected to the cylinder. If one regulator [...] "freeflows", which is a common failure mode, or ices up, which can happen in water below about 5°C, its valve can be closed and the cylinder breathed from the regulator connected to the other valve. The difference between an H-valve and a Y-valve is that the Y-valve body splits into two posts roughly 90° to each other and 45° from the vertical axis, looking like a Y, while an H-valve is usually assembled from a valve designed as part of a manifold system with an additional valve post connected to the manifold socket, with the valve posts parallel and vertical, which <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> like an H. Y-valves are also known as [...] "slingshot valves" [...] due to their appearance.|$|E
500|$|Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury responded {{negatively}} to Jacqui's Promiscuity in 2010 by stating: [...] "I DON'T like to bandy names about but...that Jacqui McQueen {{is a right}} trollop." [...] Rhiannon Vivian of the Sunday Mirror describe Jacqui as a [...] "hard-bitten" [...] character. Men's lifestyle magazine FHM brand Jacqui a [...] "notoriously sexy bad-girl". On a separate occasion Olly Richards of the magazine stated: [...] "In the soap she always <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> hard and like she could definitely beat us up." [...] Josie Ensor of WalesOnline spoke about Cooper stating: [...] "feisty jailbird character Jacqui has made her infamous on and off screen." [...] Colin Robertson of newspaper The Sun also agreed with the [...] "feisty brunette" [...] tag. Kris Green of Digital Spy branded Cooper {{as one of his}} favourite Hollyoaks actresses due to her portrayal of Jacqui. Dawn Collinson of the Liverpool Echo refers to Jacqui as a [...] "brassy character".|$|E
500|$|The video {{focuses on}} Rowland {{walking through the}} streets of Venice Beach while Guetta gathers his DJ {{equipment}} and pushes it towards the beach. Through the video a number of street performers join the gathering crowd, including a motocross bicycler, a skateboarder, and a BBoy Cloud. The last scene, sees Rowland and Guetta unite on the beach for a late night party which sees the duo performing together. Capital FM described the video as [...] "lots of shots of people having fun in the sun". Melinda Newman from Hitfix praised Rowland's role in the clip saying that [...] Some criticism did follow the video. Capital FM radio station felt that Guetta's appearance in the clip was slightly disappointing. [...] "Guetta <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> like a binman pushing his gear round the streets in some of the earlier shots in the video". Newman said that the video's director, Jonas Åkerlund, had removed something from the song. [...] "The video could have built on the great beat that builds within the song and the feeling of abandon that falling in love can bring you, but, instead, we get a telegenic couple making out who seem to drop in from nowhere." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{older one}} sees White {{attack in the}} centre with moves like b2–b3, Bc1–b2, Qd1–d5, Nc3–e4 and c4–c5. White gets an {{important}} space advantage in the centre, but Black can attack the kingside with rook lifts. After 10.b3 a5 White can try to capture the Bc5 with 11.Na4 or 11.Ne4, one point being that the retreat 11...Ba7 would lock the Ra8 because Black has not played Ra8–a6 already. Lalic still thinks 11...Ba7 is the right move after 11.Ne4 due {{to the importance of}} the a7–g1 diagonal, but Black can also reroute the bishop with 11...Bf8 and [...] "White has no obvious path to even a minute advantage". After 11.Na4 Black can also simply react by 11...b6 when the loss of the bishop pair is compensated by the semi-open b-file and improved control of the central squares. Tseitlin considers that after the exchange on c5 Black has the better position. Hence the main continuation is 11.Bb2, keeping the knight jumps for later. Then the most common plan for Black is a rook lift: the plan Ra8–a6–h6 was tried in the much-commented game Åkesson–Tagnon (Berlin Open 1984). Black duly won, but after the game continuation 11...Ra6 12.Qd5! Qe7 13.Ne4 Ba7 14.c5 Rg6 15.Rac1 Bb8 16.f4 authors do not agree on which side had the advantage. Borik and Tseitlin both consider White to have a positional advantage, with Tseitlin recommending instead 15...Nc6!, with dangerous threats. However Lalic writes of 15...Bb8, [...] "it is true that the bishop pair <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> pathetic lined up on the back rank just now, but {{there is no way to}} stop them breaking out later".|$|E
2500|$|The National Stadium (...) is a cricket {{stadium in}} Karachi, Pakistan. It is {{currently}} used for cricket matches, {{it is the}} home ground of Karachi Kings, Pakistan Super [...] League second expensive team and is home to many other Karachi's domestic cricket teams. The stadium is able to hold 34,228 spectators, Its widely criticised that the city of this size {{with a population of}} over 15 million having such a small capacity stadium. In the recent past, PCB has announced on different occasions that the capacity of the stadium will be increased to 90,000 but this approval <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> stale at the moment.|$|E
2500|$|The {{large-scale}} {{structure of}} the Universe also looks different if one only uses redshift to measure distances to galaxies. For example, galaxies behind a galaxy cluster are attracted to it, and so fall towards it, and so are slightly blueshifted (compared to how they would be {{if there were no}} cluster) On the near side, things are slightly redshifted. Thus, the environment of the cluster <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> squashed if using redshifts to measure distance. An opposite effect works on the galaxies already within a cluster: the galaxies have some random motion around the cluster center, and when these random motions are converted to redshifts, the cluster appears elongated. This creates a [...] "finger of God" [...] the illusion of a long chain of galaxies pointed at the Earth.|$|E

2500|$|During production, Lucas and Taylor—whom Kurtz called [...] "old-school" [...] and [...] "crotchety"—had {{disputes}} over filming. With {{a background in}} independent filmmaking, Lucas was accustomed to creating most {{of the elements of}} the film himself. His lighting suggestions were rejected by Taylor, who felt that Lucas was overstepping his boundaries by giving specific instructions, sometimes even moving lights and cameras himself. Taylor refused to use the soft-focus lenses and gauze Lucas wanted after Fox executives complained about the look. Kurtz stated that [...] "In a couple of scenes [...] rather than saying, 'It <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> over lit, can you fix that?', [...] say, 'turn off this light, and turn off that light.' And Gil would say, 'No, I won't do that, I've lit it the way I think it should be—tell me what's the effect that you want, and I'll make a judgment {{about what to do with}} my lights.|$|E
2500|$|The {{municipality}} {{contains a}} number of tourist attractions but these not fully are not taken advantage of. One {{of these is the}} ex monastery of Oxtotipac, which was established by the Franciscans over what was a teocalli, or Aztec sacred precinct. The complex is in Plateresque style and consecrated to San Nicolas de Bari. The facade <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> like a reliquary with its two rose windows, with a portería, or main entryway, consists of five arches with finely carved columns. This facade dates from 1675, and breaks with the usual austerity of Franciscan monasteries decorated with vegetable motifs. The interior columns are delicately worked in stone and contain interlinked Renaissance and Romance style ornamentation as well as Otomi elements. The monastery contains two baptismal fonts, one of which is from the 16th century. [...] It recently underwent a four-year restoration projects costing approximately 700,000 pesos.Work on this monastery was sponsored by a civil association called Adopte una Obra de Arte (Adopt a Work of Art) along with the State of Mexico. One of the major causes of damage to the monastery was the theft of its religious art, so security measures were installed. Indoor and outdoor walls were repaired and three altarpieces were cleaned and restored, along with {{a number of}} other sculptures and paintings. The cloister area holds a collection of art works original to the monastery.|$|E
2500|$|Phase 2: 1877, spring: In September 1876 Yakub {{learned that}} a Chinese army was 700 miles to the east. He spent the winter making {{preparations}} and by February 1877 he was at Turfan building forts. (The geography <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> odd. Yakub would have marched south of the Tien Shan to reach the Turfan oasis south of the Bogda Shan mountains. [...] If the Chinese supply line ran from Hami north of the Bogda Shan this would explain why Yakub was east of the Chinese. If the Chinese wanted to move south of the mountains {{they would have to}} pass just west of Turfan.) [...] Aleksey Kuropatkin visited Yakub at Turfan and reported that he had 17000 troops spread over a large area, that there were many desertions and that Yakub had little hope. [...] In spring the Chinese attacked the fort of 'Davanchi' (probably Dabancheng on the road from Urumchi to Turfan). Meanwhile, in mid-April Chang Yao marched from Hami and took [...] Pichuan 50 miles east of Turfan. [...] Yakub fought near Turfan and lost, withdrew to Toksun, was defeated, withdrew to Karashar, stayed there a few days and moved to Korla. [...] This withdrawal demoralized the troops and there were many desertions. [...] In April or May Yakub met Nikolay Przhevalsky near Korla. In May 1877 Yakub Beg died near Korla, possibly murdered.|$|E
