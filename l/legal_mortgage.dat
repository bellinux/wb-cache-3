50|$|Recourse debt is a {{debt that}} {{is backed by}} {{collateral}} from the borrower. Also known as a recourse loan, this type of debt allows the lender to collect from the debtor and the debtor's assets {{in the case of}} default as opposed to foreclosing on a particular property or asset as with a home loan or auto loan. Nonpayment of recourse debt allows the lender the right to collect assets or pursue <b>legal</b> action.

Neither implied power of sale requires a court order, although the court can usually also order a judicial sale. The secured party has a duty to get the best price reasonably obtainable, however, this does not require the sale to be conducted in any particular fashion (i.e. by auction or sealed bids). What the best price reasonably obtainable will be will depend upon the market available for the assets and related considerations. The sale must be a true sale - a mortgagee cannot sell to himself, either alone or with others, even for fair value; such a sale may be restrained or set aside or ignored.

50|$|The first revenue stamps in the United States {{were used}} briefly during colonial times, {{among the most}} notable usage {{involved}} the Stamp Act. Long after independence, the first revenue stamps printed by the United States government were issued {{in the midst of}} the American Civil War, prompted by the urgent need to raise revenue to pay for the great costs it incurred. After the war ended however, revenue stamps and the taxes they represented still continued. Revenue stamps served to pay tax duties on items that came under two main categories, Proprietary and Documentary. Proprietary stamps paid tax duties on goods like alcohol and tobacco, and were also used for various services, while Documentary stamps paid duties on <b>legal</b> documents, <b>mortgage</b> deeds, stocks and a fair number of other legal dealings. Proprietary and Documentary stamps often bore these respective designations, while in several of the issues they shared the same designs, sometimes with minor variations. Beginning in 1862 the first revenue stamps were issued, and would continue to be used for another hundred years and more. For the first twelve years George Washington was the only subject featured on U.S. revenue stamps, when in 1875 an allegorical figure of Liberty finally appeared. Revenue stamps were printed in many varieties and denominations and are widely sought after by collectors and historians. Revenue stamps were finally discontinued on December 31, 1967.|$|R

They found Trophimowsky in poor health, suffering from throat cancer and traumatised by the loss of Eberhardt's mother and Vladimir, who had committed suicide the previous year. Eberhardt nursed her father, growing closer to him. She also commenced a relationship and became engaged to Rehid Bay, an Armenian diplomat with whom she had been friends and possibly lovers when she was seventeen. Though Trophimowsky approved of the engagement, the relationship soon ended. Historian Lesley Blanch attributes the relationship's downfall to Bey being assigned to Stockholm. Trophimowsky died in May. Blanch attributes the death to a chloral overdose, with which Eberhardt may have intentionally euthanised him. Eberhardt intended to sell the villa, although Trophimowsky's legitimate wife opposed the execution of the will. After several weeks of <b>legal</b> contentions, Eberhardt <b>mortgaged</b> the property and returned to Africa on the first available ship.

The plights exist in the reform are analyzed, among which the plights of buying shares of contract management rights are introduced from the following five aspects: the conflict with the present land contract laws, the possible new round of massive scale land loses, the confounded functions of government and enterprise caused by risk transference and the difficulties of handling assets when the contract management rights expired. Besides, the plights of the transforming from rural residents to urban residents are analyzed from four aspects, which include the particularity of reform, high financial pressure, emergence of interbedded people and difficulties of payoff of village-based companies.

Data obtained were analyzed through simple frequency distribution tables and bar charts.   Among major findings of the research include the following: that the PMIs nature of business transactions include commercial banking, LPO financing, merchandising, property agency and sales and transport.   Existing departments in the PMIs are corporate/administration, human resources operations, <b>legal,</b> marketing and <b>mortgage.</b> Services and products of the PMIs are National Housing Fund (NHF) loan, estate development loan, pension-linked loan, LPO financing and overdraft facilities for their customers.   Major challenges confronting the operations of the PMIs are NHF policy, structure of PMIs, the national economic climate, high cost of building materials and public apathy, difficulty of access to land and land documentation constraints, poor collateral, high interest rates and competitive finance market.   The study suggests that the NHF policy should be reviewed and that government should provide incentives such as tax rebate for building materials manufacture, encourage the re-training of labour to improve their skills and speed.   The Nigerian land law should be reviewed to make access to land less cumbersome while cheap funding sources should be provided specifically for housing finance.

40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis [...] which arose in great measure from millions of bundled mortgage loans which randomly commingled arrays of toxic subprime mortgages with soundly underwritten “normal” loans and marketed securities derived from these bundles—led {{directly to the}} foreclosure epidemic we continue to face. The bursting of the derivatives bubble which spawned this epidemic has now revealed a major <b>legal</b> pitfall in <b>mortgage</b> foreclosure laws. A traditional legal rule forces the foreclosing lender to produce the original signed mortgage note {{to prove that it}} holds the legal right to foreclose or otherwise enforce remedies on the defaulted debt. This is the so-called “payment rule” of negotiable instruments law. But because of the bundling, securitization, and global remarketing of mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”) the normal chain of current ownership of any particular mortgage debt is now often unable to be traced. However, if the modern mortgage industry is to survive—and many believe that its survival is an essential goal of society—while protecting the rights of all involved in mortgage enforcement cases, {{there needs to be a}} solution to this problem. This timely article demonstrates how the nation’s courts have struggled to put a bandage on the problem. In the course of that struggle our courts have given disparate, even self-contradictory treatment to the “payment rule. ” The Court of Appeals of North Carolina is one of many such courts, handing down two schizophrenic holdings regarding the “payment rule” within weeks of one another. This article examines these inconsistent holdings, their implications for mortgage enforcement law, and presents various proposed solutions. The article offers a new fair and balanced solution the problem, which meets the three essential goals: (1) public transparency in harmony with policy underlying nearly two centuries of states’ recording acts; (2) fairness to individual mortgage debtors; (3) promoting the certainty and efficiency of the financial industry’s ability to enforce borrowers’ obligations by foreclosure. Regarding the solutions available, some are fatally complex or politically impossible, but some are more readily at hand. This article spotlights how the adoption of the Uniform Commercial Code’s revised Section 3 - 602 could alleviate the problem but state legislatures may continue to balk at this step. In the years since 2002 only 10 state legislatures have adopted this sensible solution, illustrating the political problem. This otherwise sensible solution would likely be blocked by intense lobbying from the lending industry as it seeks to avoid notice and filing delays in bundling and transferring of MBS. Some national commentators propose removing mortgages from the realm of negotiable instruments law altogether, the two laws being mutually irrelevant. Although removing mortgages from the realm of negotiability has some minor impact on Holder in Due Course rules, it does not render them untransferrable. Such a change merely requires reasonable notice to the note debtor of each such transfer. This article concludes that instead of trying to motivate the Legislature to eliminate negotiability from all mortgage notes, the optimal solution is to encourage legislators to enact the revised U. C. C. Section 3 - 602, which would eliminate the double payment threat embodied in the payment rule Regardless of the political outcome—pro or con—of a UCC reform, state legislatures should take the minimal step of mandating that notice of transfer of mortgage notes must be accomplished by mail to the borrower and recording of that notice in the land records of the county where the mortgage itself is recorded. In accord with the best national thinking on the matter, this will give the mortgage ownership status much needed transparency. Moreover, recording all such transfers would provide notice of the transfer and give much needed transparency to mortgage note ownership, thereby preventing the “lost in the MBS bundling” that has created our present crisis...|$|R
