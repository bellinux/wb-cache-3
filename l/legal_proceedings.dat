5|$|During the Genêt episode, Washington, after {{consulting}} his Cabinet, issued a Proclamation of Neutrality on April 22, 1793.

Washington eventually recognized that supporting either Great Britain or France was a false dichotomy. He would do neither, thereby shielding the fledgling U.S. from, in his view, unnecessary harm.|$|E

Persons with mental health problems are particularly affected by such regimes that are instituted by independent authorities through <b>legal</b> capacity <b>proceedings.</b> In order to allow the person to express their will and preferences throughout the proceedings, the right to be heard is of primary importance for the person concerned. The objective of this paper is to review the essential support mechanisms as well as procedural accommodations for the implementation of an equal and effective right to be heard for persons with mental health problems. Fulfilling the right to be heard in <b>legal</b> capacity <b>proceedings</b> is a step towards more individualized regimes that promote the autonomy of the person...|$|R

However, Braco was a stubborn opponent, and dragged out the proceedings, which were not resolved until just before Adam's death.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the <b>legal</b> {{capacity}} <b>proceedings,</b> which are the procedural reflection of legislation of restriction on legal capacity included in the Civil code. The legal capacity is the key legal institution for the human possibility to make a juridical acts. In some cases, it is neccessary, for the reason of protection of human, to restrict on the legal capacity, eventually to choose another preferable measure. Procedural regulation of these proceedings is, with effect from 1. 1. 2014, contained in the Code on Special Court Proceedings (Act No. 292 / 2013 Coll.), as it comprises certain derogations from classic contentious proceedings. The aim of the thesis is to comprehensively summarise and interpret this legislation including her relation on the substantive regulation, point out her faults and propose options, how to remove them. To this purpose, opinions of experts and present case law regarding these matters are in the thesis also confronted. The thesis consists of three main chapters, which are subdivided into some subchapters and sections. The content of this three chapters is the general delimitation of legal capacity, the excursion {{into the history of}} legal capacity and the procedural regulation of the <b>legal</b> capacity <b>proceedings.</b> The aim of the first chapter is to introduce the concept of [...] ...|$|R
5|$|A {{declaration}} is a pronouncement {{by a court}} {{stating the}} legal position between the parties to an action, based on the facts that have been presented to the court. Before 1 May 2011, {{it was not possible}} to apply for prerogative orders and declarations in the same set of <b>legal</b> <b>proceedings.</b> Following that date, changes to Order 53 of the Rules of Court permitted an application for a declaration to be made together with an application for one or more prerogative orders. However, the application for a declaration cannot be made unless the court grants leave for the prerogative orders to be applied for.|$|E

The Board included Tony Newton, Baron Newton of Braintree; Prof Dougal Drysdale, an authority on fire safety; and Dr Peter Baxter, a medical expert. Environment Agency and HSE staff were also on the board. Its aim was to identify the immediate causes of the explosion, rather than consider who was to blame for any deficiencies, {{so as not to}} prejudice further <b>legal</b> <b>proceedings.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{mandatory}} order is {{an order of}} the High Court which commands a public body to perform a public duty, and is usually employed to compel public bodies to exercise the powers given to them.

In such a case, the quashing order will set aside the unlawful decision, and the {{mandatory order}} will require the public body to reconsider the matter. A person who complies with a mandatory order cannot have <b>legal</b> <b>proceedings</b> taken against him or her for doing so.|$|E

5|$|According to {{customary}} law, noblemen {{could not}} be sued outside the province until the 15thcentury.

Nevertheless, legal actions between Transylvanians and the inhabitants of {{other parts of the}} kingdom remained outside the jurisdiction of the voivodes. Litigants could appeal to the royal court against the decision of the voivode from the 14thcentury, but the voivode often remained involved in the proceedings. Legislation prescribed that appeals against decisions of the voivodes were to be addressed to the judge royal only from 1444.|$|E
5|$|Although Ethel made {{a return}} visit to England in 1948 to shop and visit family and friends, Wodehouse never left America {{after his arrival}} in 1947.

The biographers Benny Green and Robert McCrum both take the view that this exile benefited Wodehouse's writing, helping him to go on depicting an idealised England seen in his mind's eye, rather than as it actually was in the post-war decades.|$|E
5|$|An {{injunction}} is {{an equitable}} private law remedy that restrains a public body from doing {{an act that}} is wrongful or ultra vires.
