5|$|Adult frogs {{lay their}} eggs in moist places, {{including}} on <b>leaves,</b> <b>in</b> plants, among exposed roots, and elsewhere. Once the eggs hatch, the adult piggybacks the tadpoles, one at a time, to suitable water, either a pool, or the water gathered in the throat of bromeliads or other plants. The tadpoles remain there until they metamorphose, fed by unfertilized eggs laid at regular intervals by the mother.|$|E

It's not obscene as long as they burn to death with their clothes on.|$|R

5|$|Fossil Nothofagus <b>leaves</b> <b>in</b> the Meyer Desert Formation of the Sirius Group {{show that}} {{intermittent}} warm periods allowed Nothofagus shrubs {{to cling to}} the Dominion Range as late as 3–4 Ma (mid-late Pliocene).

5|$|In 2006, {{researchers}} of Oman's Sultan Qaboos University published {{their findings}} from a chemical {{investigation into the}} <b>leaves</b> <b>in</b> which they found it contained semiglabrin, semigalbrinol, and a new flavanone named apollineanin. One 2014 study revealed that pseudosemiglabrin extracted from the aerial parts of Tephrosia apollinea had an antiproliferative effect on cancer cell lines.|$|E

5|$|One author {{regarded}} C.dentatus as {{a synonym}} of Coccomyces coronatus, although later authors have treated them separately. In 1923, Carlos Luigi Spegazzini tentatively reported {{the presence of}} C.dentatus on fallen Nothofagus <b>leaves</b> <b>in</b> Tierra del Fuego (southern South America); this species was later identified as a distinct species, C.australis.|$|E
5|$|Several viruses {{are known}} to infect the plant, {{including}} seed-borne strawberry latent ringspot virus, parsnip yellow fleck virus, parsnip leafcurl virus, parsnip mosaic potyvirus, and potyvirus celery mosaic virus. The latter causes clearing or yellowing of {{the areas of the}} leaf immediately beside the veins, the appearance of ochre mosaic spots, and crinkling of the <b>leaves</b> <b>in</b> infected plants.|$|E
5|$|Squire Thornhill <b>leaves</b> <b>in</b> a {{carriage}} with Olivia, whose departure is soon {{reported to the}} rest of the family. Stricken with grief, the vicar heads off to reclaim his wayward daughter. At the end of the marriage ceremony the farmer receives his payment, and the squire and Olivia embrace. The vicar arrives shortly afterwards, but after failing to persuade his daughter to return home with him <b>leaves</b> <b>in</b> despair. Olivia learns later that the marriage was a sham, but continues to live in Thornhill's house until he offers her as a prostitute to an acquaintance of his. Olivia flees in a rage and returns home, where she is reunited with her family. Thornhill, now out for revenge, has the vicar arrested and thrown into jail for unpaid debts.|$|E

5|$|The lichen {{typically}} {{grows on}} rough bark in sheltered and shaded habitats in moist and dense subtropical forests. More rarely, {{it is found}} on rocks or on <b>leaves.</b> <b>In</b> the USA it occurs in hammocks (hardwood forests) and swamps which have standing water, {{at least part of}} the year. It is also common in oak or oak-pine scrub vegetation. The species is often associated with Cryptothecia striata in the USA.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} faced by research on the gendered transition to parenthood is how to dismantle the interconnected nature of biology, gender and economic reasoning. We contribute to this aim by comparing division of parental <b>leave</b> <b>in</b> different-sex couples (DSC) and female same-sex couples (SSC). Motherhood identity formation appears to be strong in DSC as well as SSC. Net of this, gender is an important predictor of parental <b>leave</b> <b>in</b> DSC. To some extent, SSC seem to divide the <b>leave</b> <b>in</b> a more long-term financially rational way than DSC do. Sociologisk Forsknings digitala arkiv</p...|$|R

5|$|After 400–500 {{accumulated}} degree-days above , adults {{begin to}} emerge from trees in late spring, and peak emergence occurs around 1000 degree-days. After emergence, adults feed for one week on ash <b>leaves</b> <b>in</b> the canopy before mating, but cause little defoliation in the process. Males hover around trees, locate females by visual cues, and drop directly onto the female to mate; mating can last 50 minutes, and females may mate with multiple males over their lifespan. A typical female can live around six weeks and lay approximately 40–70 eggs, but females that live longer can lay up to 200 eggs.|$|E
5|$|After {{the story}} is printed, the {{neighborhood}} learns of Mac's past, and members of a local country–western band visit him to show their respect. Although he greets them politely, Mac remains reluctant to open up about his past. Later, he secretly attends Dixie's concert. She passionately sings several songs that Mac wrote years earlier, and he <b>leaves</b> <b>in</b> {{the middle of the}} performance. Backstage, he talks to Dixie's manager, his old friend Harry (Wilford Brimley). Mac gives him a copy of a new song he has written and asks him to show it to Dixie. Mac tries to talk to Dixie, but she becomes angry upon seeing him and warns him to stay away from their 18-year-old daughter, Sue Anne (Ellen Barkin).|$|E
5|$|Argo Tea {{primarily}} sells {{a variety}} of hot and cold tea-based signature drinks. In addition, it offers about three dozen international varieties of loose-leaf tea (tea brewed from loose tea leaves, as opposed to tea <b>leaves</b> <b>in</b> bagged tea), coffee, baked goods, small entrées, and teaware. The tea menu includes {{a variety of}} black, green, white teas, and natural herbal teas, served hot or iced. Argo Tea has formed a special relationship with Whole Foods Market to distribute Argo products. According to the description in Bloomberg Businessweek, Argo's specialty foods include pastries, sandwiches, salads, and quiches.

5|$|Eggs {{are almost}} {{invariably}} laid on plants. Each species of butterfly {{has its own}} host plant range and while some species of butterfly are restricted to just one species of plant, others use a range of plant species, often including members of a common family. In some species, such as the great spangled fritillary, the eggs are deposited close to {{but not on the}} food plant. This most likely happens when the egg overwinters before hatching and where the host plant loses its <b>leaves</b> <b>in</b> winter, as do violets in this example.|$|E
5|$|In {{the knot}} of {{highways}} that is the Genesee County seat, NY33 crosses and briefly overlaps with not only NY5, the other east–west route in town, but both north–south routes, NY63 and NY98. While concurrent with NY98 on Oak Street Extension, NY33 passes over Tonawanda Creek, which travels through Batavia on a roughly northwest–southeast alignment. The brief overlap with NY98 ends at Main Street, which carries NY5 and NY63 through the western portion of the city. NY33 turns east here, overlapping with NY5 and NY63 for five blocks along the four-lane, mostly commercial Main Street. NY63 <b>leaves</b> <b>in</b> downtown Batavia at Ellicott Street; however, NY5 and NY33 continue to follow Main Street {{through much of the}} city's eastern half.|$|E
5|$|Oil {{from the}} flowers was used against catarrhs, colics and, in Germany, earaches, frostbite, eczema and other {{external}} conditions. Topical application of various V.thapsus-based preparations was recommended {{for the treatment}} of warts, boils, carbuncles, hemorrhoids, and chilblains, amongst others. Recent studies have found that great mullein contains glycyrrhizin compounds with bactericide and potential anti-tumoral action. These compounds are concentrated in the flowers. The German Commission E sanctioned medicinal use of the plant for catarrhs. It was also part of the National Formulary in the United States and United Kingdom. The plant's <b>leaves,</b> <b>in</b> addition to the seeds, have been reported to contain rotenone, although quantities are unknown.|$|E
