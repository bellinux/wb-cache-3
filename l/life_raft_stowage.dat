50|$|USN {{inflatable}} <b>life</b> <b>rafts</b> are serviced {{every five}} years. Each <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> is test inflated before repacking. The USN <b>life</b> <b>rafts</b> {{have a high}} reliability rate of inflation.|$|R
50|$|The United States Navy uses five {{types of}} custom {{inflatable}} <b>life</b> <b>rafts</b> {{as well as}} a number of commercially available Coast Guard approved <b>life</b> <b>rafts.</b> The 25-person MK-6 and MK-7 are used on surface ships, the 50-person MK-8 on aircraft carriers and LRU-13A and LRU-12A on aircraft and submarines respectively. Smaller combatant craft often use 6, 10 or 15-person commercial <b>life</b> <b>rafts.</b> The number of <b>life</b> <b>rafts</b> carried on USN ships is determined based on the maximum number of personnel carried aboard plus 10% as a safety margin. Aircraft carriers carry either 254 MK7 <b>life</b> <b>rafts</b> or 127 MK8 <b>life</b> <b>rafts.</b> While both are similar to heavy-duty commercial <b>life</b> <b>rafts,</b> USN <b>life</b> <b>rafts</b> use breathable air as the inflation gas rather than carbon dioxide to ensure full inflation within 30 seconds in Arctic environments.|$|R
50|$|Base {{material}} used on MK7 <b>life</b> <b>rafts</b> is polyurethane {{coated fabric}} which has very high durability. Old MK6 {{and a few}} MK8 <b>life</b> <b>rafts</b> are manufactured of neoprene-coated fabric, however, the majority of MK8 <b>life</b> <b>rafts</b> are also manufactured of polyurethane fabric. The lifeboat is compact and made of separate compartments, or tubes, as a redundancy against puncture. Two air cylinders containing dry, breathable compressed air provide initial inflation. Depending on the model <b>life</b> <b>raft,</b> each cylinder may contain up to 5000 psi of compressed air. Each <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> is equipped with an external, automatically actuated light beacon and internal lighting. Power is provided by lithium batteries.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Inflatable <b>life</b> <b>rafts</b> are {{the primary}} {{evacuation}} units used {{by the majority of}} vessels at sea. In the event of an emergency evacuation from a vessel, all passengers don the provided survival equipment and enter the <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> from the vessel or water. If the passengers do not have additional thermal protection (such is the case of many passenger vessels) they are largely dependent on the thermal protection of the <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> to prevent or minimize heat loss to the environment. Although current <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> standards require every <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> to provide sufficient insulation against cold (IMO, 1996), the standard lacks performance standards. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the thermal response of <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> occupants with no additional thermal protection in cold conditions. Methods: Five male and three female participants (26. 3 ± 6. 1 yrs, 84. 4 ± 18. 5 kg, 175. 7 ± 9. 6 cm, 23. 7 ± 9. 1 BF...|$|R
5000|$|Abandon Ship: Teams have to race a <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> from a ship to the shore. First, {{at least}} one player has to pull off three buoys from a line resting 25, 20 and 15 {{feet below the surface}} of the <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> buoy, which is five feet below the water. After the last buoy is pulled, the <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> {{immediately}} inflates above the water, and each team races in their <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> to the shore. A team is given a five-minute penalty is a player does not pull off a buoy before a teammate jumps off the ship into the water. The team that advances their <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> to the shore in the fastest time wins Power Team, while the team with the slowest time is automatically sent to the Arena.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Evacuation from a ship or {{offshore}} installation is a hazardous undertaking, even in controlled situational and environmental circumstances. <b>Life</b> <b>rafts</b> {{are used in}} abandonment situations and are preferred to individual cold water entry. <b>Life</b> <b>rafts</b> can be self-launching and self-inflating and protect the occupants from extreme heat or cold. In high seas or winds, <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> motion could affect the performance of survival tasks, even while being towed. Despite the regulated and required use of <b>life</b> <b>rafts,</b> there is an absence of quantitative knowledge about <b>life</b> <b>rafts</b> and human performance in motion conditions. [...] Methods: Twenty-four healthy male participants (23. 8 ± 3. 1 yrs, 177. 7 ± 6. 9 cm, 78. 5 ± 11. 4 kg) were given two hours of basic training by survival training experts prior to the data collection sessions. Canopy closure, movement within the <b>life</b> <b>raft,</b> sea anchor deployment and retrieval, paddling, and bailing were all demonstrated during the training session. Participants were asked to repeat these tasks {{during the data collection}} sessions whilst in a 16 -person <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> that was being towed in either calm sea or controlled sea state 2 conditions in a self-contained tow tank facility. [...] Results: In movements within the <b>life</b> <b>raft,</b> sea anchor retrieval, paddling, and bailing tasks {{there was a significant difference}} between the no wave condition and the wave condition. In canopy closure the quality and speed of completion showed improvement with practice. [...] Conclusion: Quantitative data and qualitative observations for five tasks showed that motion, experience with the task, <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> design and equipment can all affect performance. Several recommendations to the current sea survival training standards are presented...|$|R

40|$|Inflatable <b>life</b> <b>rafts</b> are {{currently}} used on almost all passenger, fishing and commercial vessels, and offshore oil installations. Worldwide, <b>life</b> <b>rafts</b> {{are the primary}} evacuation system from fishing vessels with relatively small crews to large Roll on/Roll off passenger vessels with over a thousand passengers and crew. While International Maritime Organization (IMO) standards currently require inflatable <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> components to ?provide insulation? or ?be sufficiently insulated?, there are no performance criteria for these requirements (IMO, 1996). In a passenger ship abandonment situation in cold water, passengers may be wearing very little personal protective clothing. Therefore, <b>life</b> <b>rafts</b> provide the only significant thermal protection against the cold ocean environment while they await rescue. Manufacturers equip <b>life</b> <b>rafts</b> with an insulated floor to reduce heat loss from {{direct contact with the}} cold ocean water. The insulation provided is critically important for <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> occupants who have little protective clothing. The heat loss of unprotected persons is drastically increased if there is a layer of water on the floor as would likely be the case when someone climbs into the <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> from the ocean or if water is splashed into the <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> in heavy weather. Experiments were conducted in mild cold (16 water temperature and 19 air temperature) and cold conditions (5 water temperature and 5 air temperature) to assess the thermal protection of a 16 -person, Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) approved, commercially available <b>life</b> <b>raft.</b> This paper presents results in the mild cold condition only. It has been found that the wave height effect may be ignored as a first approximation {{to reduce the number of}} environmental variables because the results demonstrated that wave height effect is less important with leeway.

5000|$|The {{airborne}} life boats {{used by the}} USAF at {{the start}} of the 1950s had two major flaws; they required specially modified aircraft to drop them, and in heavy weather and high winds when dropped they could drift away from the exhausted survivors or be swamped and over turned. The USAF, [...] "Air Sea Rescue Unit of the Air Material Command", was tasked with studying the problem and coming up with a solution. Their solution was an air dropped life boat which before it inflated in the water, looked like a torpedo and could be carried by almost any aircraft in service that had heavy wing pylons. [...] When the boat was dropped near the survivors, on impacting the water large inflatable tubes which were connected to the rescue torpedo inflated, resulting in a radio controlled self-propelled <b>life</b> <b>raft.</b> The pilot would then start the <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> engine by radio control and steer the <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> to the survivors. When the survivors had boarded the <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> one of the rescue aircraft circling above would continue to control and steer the <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> to a safe zone for pick up, or allow the survivors to take over control. The <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> contained its own autopilot, water, dehydrated food, a two way rescue radio and enough fuel for 300 miles of travel.|$|R

40|$|Current IMO {{regulations}} require <b>life</b> <b>rafts</b> to be tow tested only in calm water. In real evacuation situations, <b>life</b> <b>rafts</b> {{are deployed}} in the prevailing environmental conditions, with wind and waves. Added wave resistance is small at low wave heights but increases nonlinearly with increased wave height. If <b>life</b> <b>rafts</b> are to be towed in moderate seas (up to 4 m significant wave height), tow force estimates based only on calm water tow resistance become less reliable. Tow patches, towline, towing craft etc. {{also need to be}} designed to withstand dynamic wave loading in addition to mean load. Therefore, mean tow force, tow force variation and maximum tow force are important. A full-scale 16 -person, commercially available, SOLAS approved <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> was towed in the tank, in upwind, head seas with significant wave height of 0. 5 m. The measured tow force showed that it could be treated as a linear system with wave amplitude, by demonstrating that tow force is mainly inertial and follows a Rayleigh distribution. Therefore, extreme-value statistics used for waves can be applied to developing equations for predicting tow force. A method is proposed to predict <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> tow force at different tow speeds and in various sea states, with waves and wind. The method involved using tank experiments to obtain tow force response for one sea state. The information can then be used to predict <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> tow force in wind and waves for different sea states. Three equations are proposed to demonstrate that a simple tank experiment could provide valuable information necessary to empirically estimate the mean tow force, tow force variation and maximum tow force for a specific <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> in different sea states. The equations are developed for upwind, head seas. These equations were extensively validated using tow force measured in the tank. They were partially validated with limited sea trial data, by towing the same 16 -person <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> and a 42 -person <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> in upwind, head seas with significant wave height of 1. 3 m. The equations were able to predict maximum tow forces to within 15 % of the measured. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

40|$|Inflatable <b>life</b> <b>rafts,</b> {{introduced}} in World War II, {{are commonly used}} today on oilinstallations, merchant ships, cruise ships, ferries, military vessels and small vessels as evacuation systems.

While operators find the compact and lightweight features of <b>life</b> <b>rafts</b> attractive, these features also make them less stable in waves and wind.
