5|$|For VTOL {{operations}} {{the aircraft}} {{was expected to}} sit pointed up, supported by long <b>landing</b> <b>legs</b> that extended out of the spine. Landing would be accomplished {{at a very high}} angle, making visibility during the approach very difficult. A number of other VTOL experiments of the era attempted various solutions to this problem, including rotating pilots seats and cockpits, but none proved very effective. Another problem with various VTOL experiments was that stability in a hover was difficult to arrange, although not entirely unexpected. A solution to this problem would require the thrust to be directed downward from a larger area, as it is in a helicopter, where the lift is supplied over the entire area of the rotor disk. Most designers turned to bleeding off air from the engine's compressor, and directing that through pipes arranged around the aircraft. Frost's engine design used such a large number of nozzles that such an arrangement would not be to easy to build.|$|E

50|$|<b>Land</b> <b>Legs</b> (Tempête) is a 2015 French drama film {{written and}} {{directed}} by Samuel Collardey. It was screened at the 72nd Venice International Film Festival, where Dominique Leborne was awarded best actor in the Horizons section.|$|R
50|$|This is the {{combination}} of a crescent 540 and a jacknife, essentially executing three separate kicks during the same motion. One with the <b>landing</b> <b>leg</b> and two with the other. The kicks and their execution {{are similar to those of}} a 720 triple.|$|R
25|$|The Falcon9v1.1 {{includes}} {{several aspects of}} reusable launch vehicle technology included in its design, as of the initial v1.1 launch in September 2013 (throttleable and restartable engines on the first stage, a first-stage tank design that can structurally accommodate the future addition of <b>landing</b> <b>legs,</b> etc.). The Falcon 9 v1.1's launch occurred two years after SpaceX committed to a privately funded development program with the goal to obtain full and rapid reusability of both stages of the launch vehicle.|$|E
25|$|The in-game astronauts, {{known as}} Kerbals, are {{physically}} simulated while performing extra vehicular activities (EVA). For example, hitting an object {{with only the}} Kerbal's feet will cause them to tumble. While on EVA, Kerbals may use their EVA suit propellant system to maneuver in space and around crafts and space stations, similar {{to the use of}} NASA's Manned Maneuvering Unit. Actions that can be performed while on EVA include repairing <b>landing</b> <b>legs,</b> wheels, and solar panels. Kerbals can also collect material from science experiments, allowing them to bring back data without carrying unwieldy parts or risking destruction of the product during atmospheric entry.|$|E
2500|$|Version 1.0 was {{the first}} full release of Kerbal Space Program. It was nicknamed We Have Liftoff! and {{released}} on 27 April 2015. Version 1.0 completely overhauled the flight and drag model for a more realistic simulation, now ignoring drag on rocket parts which were occluded from air flow. It also allowed for body lift, so that parts that were not specifically designed as wings (such as structural panels) could still generate lift. 1.0 added shock heating and heat shields, making atmospheric entry much more dangerous, as well as air brakes and procedurally generated fairings. All parts received internal modeling. Resource mining was added to refine into fuel or monopropellant. 1.0 also brought several improvements to Kerbals, who could now have various specializations. For example, [...] "Engineer" [...] Kerbals are able to repair wheels and <b>landing</b> <b>legs.</b> Female Kerbals were also added to the game. Version 1.1, nicknamed Turbo Charged, was released on 19 April 2016, almost {{one year after the}} last major update. The game engine was upgraded from Unity 4 to Unity 5, resulting in a massive increase in performance, as well as a stable 64-bit client, removing memory constraints caused by too many mods being installed. Much of the game was rewritten to accomplish this.|$|E

50|$|The {{landing gear}} was fixed and conventional, with each mainwheel, fitted with brakes, on a hinged faired V-strut {{from the side}} of the fuselage. A tall, faired <b>landing</b> <b>leg</b> with a Messier shock {{absorber}} was attached to the wing root. The track was 4.0 m. Its tailwheel also had a shock absorber.|$|R
2500|$|For several reasons, a {{different}} landing system {{was chosen for}} MSL compared to previous Mars landers and rovers. Curiosity was considered too heavy to use the airbag landing system as used on the Mars Pathfinder and Mars Exploration Rovers. A legged lander approach would have caused several design problems. It would have needed to have engines high enough above the ground when landing not to form a dust cloud that could damage the rover's instruments. This would have required long <b>landing</b> <b>legs</b> that would need to have significant width to keep {{the center of gravity}} low. A legged lander would have also required ramps so the rover could drive down to the surface, which would have incurred extra risk to the mission on the chance rocks or tilt would prevent Curiosity from being able to drive off the lander successfully. Faced with these challenges, the MSL engineers came up with a novel alternative solution: the sky crane. The sky crane system lowered the rover with a [...] tether to a soft landing—wheels down—on the surface of Mars. This system consists of a bridle lowering the rover on three nylon tethers and an electrical cable carrying information and power between the descent stage and rover. As the support and data cables unreeled, the rover's six motorized wheels snapped into position. At roughly [...] below the descent stage the sky crane system slowed to a halt and the rover touched down. After the rover touched down, it waited two seconds to confirm that it was on solid ground by detecting the weight on the wheels and fired several pyros (small explosive devices) activating cable cutters on the bridle and umbilical cords to free itself from the descent stage. The descent stage flew away to a crash landing [...] away. The sky crane concept had never been used in missions before.|$|E

Trailer <b>landing</b> <b>legs,</b> both manual and hydraulic, were developed and added to the company’s line of products.|$|E

50|$|The {{undercarriage}} of the Styx was fixed, {{with a wide}} track, large {{wheels and}} no cross-axle, making it suitable for roughly prepared landing fields.

Undercarriage legs and struts were enclosed in dural fairings. There was a steel-shod, castoring, rubber cord sprung tailskid.|$|R
