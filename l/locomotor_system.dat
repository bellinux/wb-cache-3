60|$|And {{now there}} is another idea which I should like to throw out, if you will not think it too tedious and too special. It is an old saying that, after all, the great end and aim of the British Constitution is to get twelve honest men into a box. That is really a very {{sensible}} way of putting the theory, that the first end of government is to give security to life and property, and to make people keep their contracts. But with this view {{it is not only}} important that you should get twelve honest men into a box: the twelve honest men must have in their heads some notions as to what constitutes Evidence. Now it is surely a striking thing that while we are so careful to teach physical science and literature; while men want to be endowed in order to have leisure to explore our spinal cords, and to observe the <b>locomotor</b> <b>system</b> of Medusæ--and I have no objection against those who urge on all these studies--yet there is no systematic teaching, very often no teaching at all, in the principles of Evidence and Reasoning, even for the bulk of those who would be very much offended if we were to say that they are not educated. Of course I use the term evidence in a wider sense than the testimony in crimes and contracts, and the other business of courts of law. Questions of evidence are rising at every hour of the day. As Bentham says, {{it is a question of}} evidence with the cook whether the joint of meat is roasted enough. It has been excellently said that the principal and most characteristic difference between one human intellect and another consists in their ability to judge correctly of evidence. Most of us, Mr. Mill says, are very unsafe hands at estimating evidence, if appeal cannot be made to actual eyesight. Indeed, if we think of some of the tales that have been lately diverting the British Association, we might perhaps go farther, and describe many of us as very bad hands at estimating evidence, even where appeal can be made to actual eyesight. Eyesight, in fact, is the least part of the matter. The senses are as often the tools as the guides of reason. One of the longest chapters in the history of vulgar error would contain the cases in which the eyes have only seen what old prepossessions inspired them to see, and were blind to all that would have been fatal to the prepossessions. 'It is beyond all question or dispute,' says Voltaire, 'that magic words and ceremonies are quite capable of most effectually destroying a whole flock of sheep, if the words be accompanied by a sufficient quantity of arsenic.' Sorcery has no doubt been exploded--at least we assume that it has--but the temper that made men attribute all the efficacy to the magic words, and entirely overlook the arsenic, still prevails in a great host of moral and political affairs, into which it is not convenient to enter here. The stability of a government, for instance, is constantly set down to some ornamental part of it, when in fact the ornamental part has no more to do with stability than the incantations of the soothsayer.|$|E

40|$|System {{identification}} of rhythmic <b>locomotor</b> <b>systems</b> is challenging {{due to the}} time-varying nature of their dynamics. Even though important aspects of these systems can be captured via explicit mechanics-based models, {{it is unclear how}} accurate such models can be while still being analytically tractable. An alternative approach for rhythmic <b>locomotor</b> <b>systems</b> is the use of data-driven system identification in the frequency domain via harmonic transfer functions (HTFs). To this end, the input-output dynamics of a locomotor behavior can be linearized around a stable limit cycle, yielding a linear, time-periodic system. However, few if any model-based or data-driven identification methods for time-periodic systems address the problem of input and measurement delays in the system. In this paper, we focus on data-driven system identification for a simple mechanical system and analyze its dynamics in the presence of input and measurement delays using HTFs. By exploiting the way input delays are modulated by the periodic dynamics, our results enable the separate, independent estimation of input and measurement delays, which would be indistinguishable were the system linear and time invariant. © 2015, IFAG...|$|R

Reciprocal inhibition produces alternating motor patterns; however, the mechanisms that generate other phasic relationships between intrasegmental motor pools are unknown.

We find that two motor pools that are sequentially recruited during locomotion have identical excitable properties. In contrast, they receive input from divergent premotor circuits. We find that this motor pattern is not orchestrated by differential excitatory input but by a GABAergic interneuron acting as a delay line to the later-recruited motor pool. Our findings show how a motor pattern is generated {{as a function of the}} modular organization of locomotor networks through segregation of inhibition, a potentially general mechanism for sequential motor patterns.

40|$|The {{biomechanics}} of adiposity – {{structural and}} functional limitations of obesity {{and implications for}} movement Relative to the extensive literature now available on {{many aspects of the}} obese condition there is a dearth of information pertaining to the structural and functional limitations imposed by overweight and obesity.

50|$|The common raven migrates long {{distances}} {{for food and}} mating. Since ravens, and birds in general, travel to such extents, they have a unique adaptation for flying in high altitude environments. Specifically, neural mediating reflexes increase breathing. The <b>locomotors</b> <b>system</b> stimulates breathing directly from feed forward stimulation from brainstem centers and feedback stimulation from exercising muscles. In the carotid body, the bird’s chemoreceptors detect low oxygen and stimulate breathing during hypoxia. Also, if breathing is hypoxic, the bird can use CO2/pH-sensitive chemoreceptors to restrain breathing. Due to ventilatory responses, this process leads to secondary hypocapnia. Because birds are exposed {{to a wide variety}} of toxic gases and air borne particles in the environment, studies have used birds to measure air quality. Not only is a bird’s respiration adapted to handle high-altitude flight, but so too is the circulatory system. In general, birds have larger heart sizes and higher cardiac output. During flight, birds can sustain their heart rates, and their myosin flight muscles have better oxygen diffusion because of a high degree of branching between the capillaries.|$|R

40|$|Fish develop {{morphological}} specializations {{in their}} trophic and <b>locomotor</b> <b>systems</b> {{as a result}} of varying functional demands in response to environmental pressures at different life stages. These specializations should maximize particular performances in specialists, adapting them to their trophic and habitat niches at each ontogenetic stage. Because differential growth rates of the structural components comprised in the head are likely to be linked to the diet of a fish throughout its development, we investigated the ontogenetic development of two haplochromine cichlid species belonging to different trophic guilds. We employed geometric morphometric techniques to evaluate whether starting from morphologically similar fry they diverge into phenotypes that characterize trophic guilds and locomotor types. Our examination of overall body shape shows that certain specialized morphological features are already present in fry, whereas other traits diverge through ontogeny due to differences in species-specific allometric variation. Allometric shape variation was found to be more relevant for the biter specialist than for the sucker morphotype. Our results confirm that phenotypic changes during ontogeny can be linked to dietary and habitat shifts in these fish. Furthermore, evidence for an integrated development of trophic and locomotor specializations in morphology was observed. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|SYNOPSIS. Animals {{can lower}} the {{metabolic}} cost of swimming by using appropriately tuned, elastic springs. Jet-powered invertebrates use springs that lie in functional parallel to their swimming muscles to power half the locomotor cycle. The parallel geometry constrains the spring to be non-linearly elastic; muscle power is diverted {{to load the}} spring only when swimming muscles are not capable of producing maximal hydro-dynamic thrust. The springs of jellyfish and scallops are forced at or near their resonant frequency, producing large energy savings. Measuring the contribution of elastic energy storage to jet-powered locomotion has been facilitated by the relatively simple geometries of invertebrate <b>locomotor</b> <b>systems.</b> In contrast, complex musculoskeletal systems and kinematics have complicated the study of springs in swimming vertebrates. Skins, tendons and axial skeletons of some vertebrate swimmers have appropri-ate mechanical properties to act as springs. To date, though, there exist {{just a handful of}} studies that have investigated the mechanical behaviors of these locomotor structures in swimming vertebrates, and these data have yet to be integrated with measures of swimming power. Integrating mechanical, kinematic, hydrodynamic and metabolic data are required to understand more fully the role of elastic springs in vertebrate swimming energetics...|$|R
