5000|$|A {{guaranteed}} {{maximum price}} (also known as GMP, not-to-exceed price, NTE, or NTX) contract is a cost-type contract (also {{known as an}} open-book contract) where the contractor is compensated for actual costs incurred plus a fixed fee subject to a ceiling price. The contractor is responsible for cost overruns, unless the GMP has been increased via formal change order (only {{as a result of}} additional scope from the client, not price overruns, errors, or omissions). Savings resulting from cost underruns are returned to the owner. This is different from a fixed-price contract (also known as stipulated price contract or <b>lump-sum</b> <b>contract)</b> where cost savings are typically retained by the contractor and essentially become additional profits.|$|E
40|$|During {{the next}} three years, the ST/CV group will be deeply {{involved}} in the installation works for the LHC project. During this period the need for maintenance activity will decrease. The minimum level will be reached during the “long shutdown” of the PS and SPS machines in 2005. The budget for the maintenance will decrease accordingly, thus the CV group had to review its maintenance strategy. The new contract, which started on January 1 st 2003, has been defined to cope with these workload variations during the next years and to guarantee the minimum maintenance activity on the existing equipment. A <b>lump-sum</b> <b>contract</b> based on a win-win strategy has been discarded. The contractor no longer has to guarantee the performance of the CERN cooling and ventilation systems. A new price list strategy based on performance indicators and penalties has been chosen. The contractor now has to guarantee the performance of every maintenance operation demanded by CERN. This modification obliged the Operation section of the CV group to undergo a reorganisation during 2002 and is going to force deep changes in its work organisation...|$|E
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Contracts have {{traditionally}} been used to coordinate expectations and structure relations, with clients using them to define and manage commercial relationships with suppliers. Whilst extant literature is concerned with large capital projects of a ‘one-off’ nature, this research is concerned with individual contracts within ‘on-going’ strategic infrastructure maintenance programmes. Whereas relational contracting strategies are associated with better client-supplier relations, ‘on-going’ strategic infrastructure maintenance programmes tend not to use such contracts. This presents a problematic contextual backdrop for the successful delivery of such programmes. This research seeks to understand {{the conditions under which}} collaborative working arrangements can be achieved within non-collaborative commercial frameworks. An in-depth case study is used to explore collaboration within transactional lump-sum arrangements. The research reveals how the interpretation of a <b>lump-sum</b> <b>contract</b> led to the prioritisation of cost savings over quality and initially stimulated behaviours that inhibited collaboration. However, over time informal working practices and a collaborative working philosophy emerged reminiscent of that expected under relational contracts. Collaboration was established in an informal project culture that ran counter to a persistent adversarial commercial framework. Formal performance measures were resolved and performance appeared satisfactory to the client, even though it was enabled by informal working practices running counter to the client’s chosen contract. Contra much previous work that deterministically positions relationships as a product of the contract, this study reveals that collaborative behaviours can thrive even in unfavourable contractual conditions. This, in turn, calls for a re-theorisation of the relationship between contracts and behaviours within long-term programme arrangements...|$|E
40|$|In {{a dynamic}} setting, we compare {{procurement}} schemes {{in the form}} of a lump-sum payment with an optimal information-revealing menu ofcontracts without commitment. We nd that <b>lump-sum</b> <b>contracts</b> generate two bene ts. First, they always provide optimal levels of e ort. Second, they `tie the hands' of the procurer, and avoid the ratchet e ect. These bene ts must be weighed against the costs of higher rent in the second period. For a low discount factor such costs dominate, but for a high discount rate, when the ratchet e ect becomes acute, the welfare gap becomes small and lump-sum payments may even welfare-dominate an optimal menu.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} successes and {{failures}} of privatization and other contract reform initiatives within the DOE Weapons Complex {{over the past seven}} years. The paper concludes that the {{successes and failures}} of these project delivery methods depend largely on the risks attendant with the project itself. For example, where the wastes to be remediated defy characterization and the technology is innovative, the Department ordinarily should bear most of the risk, and some specie of cost-reimbursable contracting should be employed. On the other hand, where the risks are readily quantifiable and the technology is proven, more of the risk and responsibility can and should be placed on the contractor. This form of risk transference runs the continuum from <b>lump-sum</b> <b>contracting</b> to design/build, to privatization, depending on the circumstances. The preferred contracting form, however, is not dictated solely by project-related risk. Onto this risk must be overlain a set of risks that derive from the project management capabilities and the institutional biases of the oversight M&O or M&I contractor. Foremost among this additional set of risks is the ability of the oversight contractor to employ a level of contractual interface that is commensurate and proportionate with the selected project delivery method...|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} contract is a document which governs the business relationship of Contractor and Employer {{for the duration}} of a construction project. However, the selection of the contract type for the project tends to be performed too shallowly. The present thesis aims to analyse how the contract type is chosen among the three paradigmatic <b>contracts</b> considered here: <b>lump-sum</b> <b>contracts,</b> target-cost contracts and cost-plus contracts. The basis of the study is a case study performed on Project X, a large mine construction project in Western Europe. The relevant literature to the subject was reviewed, mainly the principal-agent theory, literature on risk allocation and on contract selection. After identifying several factors which may influence the contract selection in the literature and in a preliminary interview, a survey was conducted to assess their relative influence in general and in particular for the Project X. The survey was responded by a small sample of highly qualified and experienced managers. and was complemented with in-depth interviews with the majority of them. Some research on the project and on contract documents of the NEC standard contract was also performed in order to provide a context of the characteristics of Project X. The findings of the three sources made it possible to confirm the influence on the selection of the contract type of many of the factors proposed. It was possible to shortlist a small number of factors which influenced the most the selection of the contract type for Project X. These were the preferred risk allocation by the parties, the ability to adapt the contract to scope changes, the knowledge of each contract type by the contracting parties, the improvement of the project delivery by the contract type and the aim to enhance cooperation between the parties. Factors not present in previous research were also discovered, such as the different financial costs of the contract types and the requirement of financial information by the funders of the parties. The very different opinions of the respondents to the survey and interviews regarding the selection of the contract type confirm that the parties should consider in more detail that complex process, because by now the parties are not really sure why they are choosing a certain contract type. Further research should be performed in the future to analyse the factors which influenced the contract type selection in other projects. The projects could also be analysed during their whole duration. Other contract types or variants of the three contract types studied in this thesis could also be added to the analysis...|$|R
40|$|In {{light of}} {{increasing}} project complexity, constraints on programme schedule and limited budget, {{there exists a}} strong call for changes in contracting procedures in construction. Both the Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) and Target Cost Contracting (TCC) approaches with a gain-share/pain-share arrangement have been advocated to achieve better value for money and more satisfactory project performance. This paper aims to review the prevailing practices of GMP/TCC in general, and explore the motives and benefits of implementing the GMP/TCC scheme {{in comparison with the}} traditional fixed price <b>lump-sum</b> <b>contract</b> in particular. The research study is based on a comprehensive literature review and an industry-wide empirical questionnaire survey for evaluating the relative importance of motives and benefits associated with GMP/TCC in Hong Kong. The survey data collected from 45 valid completed questionnaires were analysed using the mean score ranking technique, Kendall's concordance test, Spearman's rank correlation test and one-way ANOVA test. The perceived benefits were measured and ranked from the perspectives of the client, contractor and consultant for cross-comparison. The survey findings indicated that the three most common motives of clients behind their decision of adopting GMP/TCC include: (1) to generate an incentive for contractor to achieve cost saving; (2) to develop better working relationship within the project team; and (3) to tap in contractor's expertise in design and innovation. The top three perceived benefits of applying GMP/TCC were found to be: (1) early settlement of final project account; (2) improved partners' working relationship under a partnering arrangement; and (3) capability of integrating contractor's expertise in building designs and innovations prior to construction. The research results are particularly essential in assisting key project stakeholders to realise the potential benefits derived from the use of GMP/TCC contracts and in generating more useful insights into alternative integrated contracting strategies for the construction industry, so as to drive for excellence in overall project performance. postprin...|$|E
50|$|The BMA {{contracted}} the British company Mott Macdonald and Thai companies Epsilon and P & Cigna {{to perform the}} preliminary survey and designs. Bidding on the project began in 1996, but was halted due to the 1997 Asian financial crisis.

40|$|Within {{numerous}} {{production and}} distribution environments, maintenance of effective customer service is central to securing competitive benefits. Globalised industries are becoming more commonplace as well, further increasing the competitive pressure. Companies, as a result, are forced to expand product availability and deliver to the demand on schedule. As part of a supply chain, service levels are an important measure of performance in operations management and are widely used to evaluate and manage supplier performance. This thesis examines the SLA for the supplier under two types of contracts to guarantee the agreed customer service level. Specifically, this dissertation will {{shed light on the}} two most important (SLA) measurements for inventory systems: fill rate and ready rate. Both SLA measurements are commonly used as performance measures in SLAs between customers and suppliers. Throughout this thesis, we examine performance-based contracts in which the supplier has either: a single customer with a large demand, or multiple customers with a smaller demand. Our experiments were designed so that the demand distribution for the single customer case was similar to the aggregated demand distribution in the multiple customer case. The thesis primarily focused on four main questions, with each question being examined in its own chapter. The first research problem is addressed in Chapter 3. Earlier studies of finite horizon fill rate only consider the situation {{in which there is a}} single customer in the supply chain. In Chapter 3, we develop a model to analyse the fill rate distributions for a supplier that has multiple customers, each with its own SLA. In particular, we examine the impacts of performance review period length and the correlation between customer demands on the average fill rate and the probability of overreaching the target fill rate when a supplier has multiple customers. Under the multiple customer contracts, two service policies for demand fulfilment. In the first policy, First-Come-First-Served (FCFS), demand is filled with no prioritization (e. g., in the case of two customers, there is a 50 % chance that the first customer is served first). In the second policy, Prioritized Lowest Fill Rate (PLFR), customers are prioritized so that the customer with the highest negative deviation from its target fill rate in the current performance review period is served first. The results and findings in Chapter 3 provide insights that can assist suppliers in the design and negotiation of SLAs. The second research problem is addressed in Chapter 4. Previous studies on the finite horizon fill rate are limited and assume a zero lead time for the supplier. We create a model to examine the impact of different supplier lead times on the finite horizon fill rate, considering either single customer or multiple customers. As lead time exists in reallife supply chains, we explore the effect of various lead times on the fill rate distribution and required base stock over finite horizons with a variety of review period lengths. The results revealed that to fix the long-run fill rate, as the lead time increases, more stock is required; however, the probability of exceeding the target fill rate (the probability of success) increases as the lead time increases. The results indicate that the increase in the probability of success as the lead time increases is higher when the review period is shorter. For the third research problem Chapter 5 presents further results related to the fill rate, an important measure of supply chain performance, specifically ensuring that a customer&rsquo;s service need is met with maximum reliability. These results mainly concentrate on variability, an aspect that is largely ignored in the literature on fill rate. Related results concerning consistency and asymptotic normality extend the range of application of the fill rate in evaluating reliability and determining the optimal stock level of a supply chain. Chapter 6 explores the fourth research problem which considers the ready rate, a widely used performance measure in SLAs. The ready rate considered in this study is defined as the long-run fraction of periods in which all customer demand is filled immediately from on-hand stock. Previous studies of SLAs have been solely concerned with one supplier serving one customer, whereas in practice, a supplier usually deals with more than one customer. In multiple customer cases, the supplier has an SLA with each customer, and a penalty is incurred whenever the agreement is violated. In this chapter, we create a model to examine the impacts of various factors such as the base-stock level, the type of penalty (lump-sum and linear penalty), and the review period duration on the supplier&rsquo;s cost function when the supplier deals with multiple customers. The results show that dealing with more customers is preferable for a supplier (assuming the overall demand is the same) and that under a <b>lump-sum</b> penalty <b>contract,</b> a longer performance review is beneficial. Finally, Chapter 7 closes with a brief review, discussion on the models constructed and suggests areas for future studies...|$|R
