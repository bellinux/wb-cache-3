25|$|From 1828 to 1839 Babbage was Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge. Not a {{conventional}} resident don, and inattentive to teaching, he wrote three topical books {{during this period}} of his life. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1832. Babbage was out of sympathy with colleagues: George Biddell Airy, his predecessor as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge, thought an issue should be made of his lack of interest in lecturing. Babbage planned to lecture in 1831 on political economy. Babbage's reforming direction <b>looked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> university education more inclusive, universities doing more for research, a broader syllabus and more interest in applications; but William Whewell found the programme unacceptable. A controversy Babbage had with Richard Jones lasted for six years. He never did give a lecture.|$|E
