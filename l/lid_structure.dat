50|$|Within the cell, {{the process}} of GroEL/ES {{mediated}} protein folding involves multiple rounds of binding, encapsulation, and release of substrate protein. Unfolded substrate proteins bind to a hydrophobic binding patch on the interior rim of the open cavity of GroEL, forming a binary complex with the chaperonin. Binding of substrate protein in this manner, in addition to binding of ATP, induces a conformational change that allows association of the binary complex with a separate <b>lid</b> <b>structure,</b> GroES. Binding of GroES to the open cavity of the chaperonin induces the individual subunits of the chaperonin to rotate such that the hydrophobic substrate binding site {{is removed from the}} interior of the cavity, causing the substrate protein to be ejected from the rim into the now largely hydrophilic chamber. The hydrophilic environment of the chamber favors the burying of hydrophobic residues of the substrate, inducing substrate folding. Hydrolysis of ATP and binding of a new substrate protein to the opposite cavity sends an allosteric signal causing GroES and the encapsulated protein to be released into the cytosol. A given protein will undergo multiple rounds of folding, returning each time to its original unfolded state, until the native conformation or an intermediate structure committed to reaching the native state is achieved. Alternatively, the substrate may succumb to a competing reaction, such as misfolding and aggregation with other misfolded proteins.|$|E

40|$|Developers are {{increasingly}} {{looking for the}} best management practices {{to reduce the risk}} of floods in rapidly growing urban areas. Low impact development (LID) is regarded as one of the most suitable solutions for urban stormwater management and thus the U. S. EPA’s (Environmental Protection Agency) SWMM 5. 1 (Storm Water Management Model) added the hydrological simulation function for LID structures in 2009. However, SWMM 5. 1 cannot consider the optimal or best physical specifications of LID design and planning fitted to a study area, nor can it instantly derive the best combination for multiple LID designs and plans. Therefore, in this study, a web-based decision support system (DSS) for the EPA’s SWMM 5. 1, referred to as the Water Management Analysis Module (WMAM) is used to decide the most effective specifications of design and planning parameters for <b>LID</b> <b>structure.</b> This study was carried out over an urban catchment of University Technology Malaysia campus located in Johor, Malaysia. The hydrologic cycles with and without LID were simulated using EPA SWMM 5. 1. The sensitivity analysis and multiple scenario analysis were performed using WMAM.

40|$|Low-impact {{development}} (LID) comprises a {{broad spectrum}} of stormwater management technologies for mitigating the impacts of urbanization on hydrological processes. Among these technologies, green roofs {{are one of the most}} adopted solutions, especially in densely populated metropolitan areas, where roofs take up a significant portion of the impervious surfaces and land areas are scarce. While the in situ hydrological performance of green roofs—i. e., reduction of runoff volume and peak discharge—is well addressed in literature, less is known about their impact on stormwater management and reuse activities at a catchment or city scale. This study developed an integrated urban water cycle model (IUWCM) to quantitatively assess the effect of uniform green roof deployment (i. e., 25, 50, and 100 % conversion of traditional roofs) over the period 2009 – 2011 in the Marina Reservoir catchment, a 100 -km 2, highly urbanized area located in the heart of Singapore. The IUWCM consists of two components: (1) a physically based model for extensive green roofs integrated within a one-dimensional numerical hydrological-hydraulic catchment model linked with (2) an optimization-based model describing the operation of the downstream, stormwater-fed reservoir. The event-based hydrological performance of green roofs varied significantly throughout the simulation period with a median of about 5 % and 12 % for the catchment scale reduction of runoff volume and peak discharge (100 % conversion of traditional roofs). The high variability and lower performance (with respect to temperate climates) are strongly related to the tropical weather and climatic conditions—e. g., antecedent dry weather period and maximum rainfall intensity. Average annual volume reductions were 0. 6, 1. 2, and 2. 4 % for the 25, 50, and 100 % green roof scenarios, respectively. The reduction of the stormwater generated at the catchment level through green roof implementation had a positive impact on flood protection along Marina Reservoir shores and the energy costs encountered when operating the reservoir. Vice versa, the drinking water supply, which depends on the amount of available stormwater, decreased due to the evapotranspiration losses from green roofs. Better performance in terms of stormwater reuse could only be obtained by increasing the time of concentration of the catchment. This may be achieved through the combination of green roofs with other <b>LID</b> <b>structures...</b>|$|R

40|$|The African superswell is an {{extensive}} topographic anomaly comprising {{the eastern and}} southern African plateaus, and an area of elevated bathymetry in the southeastern Atlantic Ocean basin. By comparing the P-wave velocity structure of unrifted Proterozoic lithosphere beneath (e. g., southern Africa) and away from (e. g., central Africa) the African superswell, we investigate the hypothesis that uplift within the superswell distal to the Cenozoic East African rift-valleys has been caused by lithospheric reheating.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two separate parts. Part I (Chapter 1) is concerned with seismotectonics of the Middle America subduction zone. In this chapter, stress distribution and Benioff zone geometry are investigated along almost 2000 km of this subduction zone, from the Rivera Fracture Zone in the north to Guatemala in the south. Particular {{emphasis is placed on}} the effects on stress distribution of two aseismic ridges, the Tehuantepec Ridge and the Orozco Fracture Zone, which subduct at seismic gaps. Stress distribution is determined by studying seismicity distribution, and by analysis of 190 focal mechanisms, both new and previously published, which are collected here. In addition, two recent large earthquakes that have occurred near the Tehuantepec Ridge and the Orozco Fracture Zone are discussed in more detail. A consistent stress release pattern is found along most of the Middle America subduction zone: thrust events at shallow depths, followed down-dip by an area of low seismic activity, followed by a zone of normal events at over 175 km from the trench and 60 km depth. The zone of low activity is interpreted as showing decoupling of the plates, and the zone of normal activity as showing the breakup of the descending plate. The portion of subducted lithosphere containing the Orozco Fracture Zone does not differ significantly, in Benioff zone geometry or in stress distribution, from adjoining segments. The Playa Azul earthquake of October 25, 1981, M s = 7. 3, occurred in this area. Body and surface wave analysis of this event shows a simple source with a shallow thrust mechanism and gives M o = 1. 3 x 10 27 dyne-cm. A stress drop of about 45 bars is calculated; this is slightly higher than that of other thrust events in this subduction zone. In the Tehuantepec Ridge area, only minor differences in stress distribution are seen relative to adjoining segments. For both ridges, the only major difference from adjoining areas is the infrequency or lack of occurrence of large interplate thrust events. Part II involves upper mantle P wave structure studies, for the Canadian shield and eastern North America. In Chapter 2, the P wave structure of the Canadian shield is determined through forward waveform modeling of the phases P nl, P, and PP. Effects of lateral heterogeneity are kept to a minimum by using earthquakes just outside the shield as sources, with propagation paths largely within the shield. Previous mantle structure studies have used recordings of P waves in the upper mantle triplication range of 15 - 30 °; however, the lack of large earthquakes in the shield region makes compilation of a complete P wave dataset difficult. By using the phase PP, which undergoes triplications at 30 - 60 °, much more information becomes available. The WKBJ technique is used to calculate synthetic seismograms for PP, and these records are modeled almost as well as the P. A new velocity model, designated S 25, is proposed for the Canadian shield. This model contains a thick, high-Q, high-velocity lid to 165 km and a deep low-velocity zone. These features combine to produce seismograms that are markedly different from those generated by other shield structure models. The upper mantle discontinuities in S 25 are placed at 405 and 660 km, with a simple linear gradient in velocity between them. Details of the shape of the discontinuities are not well constrained. Below 405 km, this model is not very different from many proposed P wave models for both shield and tectonic regions. Chapter 3 looks in more detail at recordings of P nl in eastern North America. First, seismograms from four eastern North American earthquakes are analyzed, and seismic moments for the events are calculated. These earthquakes are important in that they are among the largest to have occurred in eastern North America in the last thirty years, yet in some cases were not large enough to produce many good long-period teleseismic records. A simple layer-over-a-halfspace model is used for the initial modeling, and is found to provide an excellent fit for many features of the observed waveforms. The effects on P nl of varying <b>lid</b> <b>structure</b> are then investigated. A thick lid with a positive gradient in velocity, such as that proposed for the Canadian shield in Chapter 2, will have a pronounced effect on the waveforms, beginning at distances of 800 or 900 km. P nl records from the same eastern North American events are recalculated for several <b>lid</b> <b>structure</b> models, to survey what kinds of variations might be seen. For several records it is possible to see likely effects of <b>lid</b> <b>structure</b> in the data. However, the dataset is too sparse to make any general observations about variations in <b>lid</b> <b>structure.</b> This type of modeling is expected to be important in the future, as the analysis is extended to more recent eastern North American events, and as broadband instruments make more high-quality regional recordings available. </p...|$|E

By comparison with the previous structures of Kex 2 and furin, this structure of the acylated enzyme provides {{a basis for the}} observed decrease in the acylation rate with substrates containing a lysine at P 1 and the absence of an effect on the deacylation rate without involving mobility of the S 1 <b>lid.</b> The <b>structure</b> of the complex shows that a secondary subsite in the S 1 pocket is present, and that this site recognizes and binds the P 1 lysine in a more shallow fashion than arginine. This results in a displacement of the bound peptide away from the S 385 nucleophile relative to substrates containing a P 1 arginine. It is concluded that this alternate binding site and resultant displacement of the scissile bond in the active site results in the observed decrease in the acylation rate. Studies of the inactivation kinetics of Kex 2 by two peptidyl chloromethylketone inhibitors demonstrates that the selectivity between lysine and arginine at the P 1 position arises at the acylation step, consistent with what was observed with peptidyl substrates [Rockwell NC, Fuller RS (2001) J Biol Chem 276 : 38394 – 38399]...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Pn-wave energy refracts {{through the}} {{uppermost}} mantle, {{with the first}} seismic wave arrival at distances of ∼ 200 to ∼ 1500 km from crustal sources. The Pn phase provides important constraints on source type, location, and magnitude, but its propagation is complicated by frequency-dependent sensitivity to the Earth’s sphericity and lithospheric velocity structure. Converging on an acceptable Pn geometric spreading correction and specifying its uncertainties, a requirement for accurately determining frequency-dependent attenuation models for Pn, depends on improved understanding {{of the behavior of}} Pn geometric spreading for various heterogeneous models. We investigate the effects of radial mantle lid velocity gradi-ents, mantle lid random volumetric velocity heterogeneities, and Moho topography on Pn geometric spreading using reflectivity and two-dimensional (2 D) finite-difference 1 -Hz wave propagation calculations for elastic Earth models. Mantle lid velocity gra-dients systematically modify the frequency-dependent geometric spreading from that found for models with constant velocity but retain the same overall functional form. Pn amplitudes are also sensitive to the presence of modest 2 D random lateral velocity heterogeneities within the uppermost mantle, with geometric spreading approaching a power-law behavior as the root mean square strength of heterogeneity increases. 2 D Moho topography introduces scatter into the amplitude of Pn, but the overall behavior remains compatible with that for a laterally homogeneous model. Given the lack of knowledge of specific small-scale structure for any particular Pn path, the preferred geometric spreading parameterization is the frequency-dependent model for a constant mantle <b>lid</b> velocity <b>structure</b> unless Pn travel-time branch curvature can constrain the radial gradient in the mantle lid...|$|R
30|$|Lipase (EC 3.1. 1.3) is {{regarded}} as one of the most important commercial enzymes, and has been attracting enormous attention in the rapidly growing biotechnological area. It catalyzes the hydrolysis of triacylglycerols to release diacylglyceride, monoacylglycerol, long-chain fatty acids (>[*] 8 carbons) and glycerol at the interface of oil and water (Brockerhoff 1974). According to the protein structure similarity, lipase belongs to the family of α/β hydrolases, in which a catalytic triad (usually serine, histidine, and aspartic or glutamic acid) and an oxyanion hole (just like a catalytic pocket) are crucial for catalysis (Gupta et al. 2015), and a <b>lid</b> <b>structure</b> involves in the substrate accessibility and binding in the active site (Woolley and Petersen 1996). During hydrolysis, the hydroxy group of the catalytic serine attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ester bond of the substrate, while the catalytic histidine acts as a general-base catalyst and abstracts a proton from the catalytic serine. The alcohol group of the substrate is released and an acyl-enzyme intermediate is formed, which is stabilized in the oxyanion hole by hydrogen bonds. The acyl-enzyme intermediate can be attacked by a water or alcohol molecule, leading to the formation of acid or new ester, respectively (Beer et al. 1996).|$|E
40|$|Molecular chaperones are a {{class of}} {{proteins}} responsible for proper folding {{of a large number}} of polypeptides in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Newly synthesized polypeptides are prone to nonspecific interactions, and many of them make toxic aggregates in absence of chaperones. The eukaryotic chaperonin CCT is a large, multisubunit, cylindrical structure having two identical rings stacked back to back. Each ring is composed of eight different but similar subunits and each subunit has three distinct domains. CCT assists folding of actin, tubulin, and numerous other cellular proteins in an ATP-dependent manner. The catalytic cooperativity of ATP binding/hydrolysis in CCT occurs in a sequential manner different from concerted cooperativity as shown for GroEL. Unlike GroEL, CCT does not have GroES-like cofactor, rather it has a built-in <b>lid</b> <b>structure</b> responsible for closing the central cavity. The CCT complex recognizes its substrates through diverse mechanisms involving hydrophobic or electrostatic interactions. Upstream factors like Hsp 70 and Hsp 90 also work in a concerted manner to transfer the substrate to CCT. Moreover, prefoldin, phosducin-like proteins, and Bag 3 protein interact with CCT and modulate its function for the fine-tuning of protein folding process.

A CRL chimera enzyme obtained by replacing its lid with that of another C. rugosa lipase isoform (CRL 1 LID 3) was found to be affected in both activity and enantioselectivity in organic solvent. Variants of the PFL protein in which three polar lid residues were replaced with amino acids strictly conserved in homologous lipases displayed altered chain length preference profile and increased thermostability. On the other hand, insertion of lid structures from structurally homologous enzymes into BSLA, a lipase that naturally does not possess such a <b>lid</b> <b>structure,</b> caused a reduction in the enzyme activity and an altered substrate specificity.

MN DNR records from 2009 indicate that after over three decades there are only 32 active Lake Improvement Districts (LIDs) in Minnesota. Using LIDs as an inroad to study the connection between water policy and citizen participation in water stewardship activities, the project’s findings expose {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} <b>LIDs</b> in <b>structuring</b> citizen participation in lake management activities. These findings broadly inform future water policies aiming to have citizen participation in water resource management activities as a policy outcome. This research is timely as Minnesota, with the assistance of the University of Minnesota, begins to build a 25 -year framework to guide the protection, conservation and enhancement of surface water quality and quantity. A key finding is that the citizens who attempted LID formation often found themselves attempting to be recognized stakeholders in a complex water governance system that they perceived to be as impenetrable as it was intimidating. As indicated by project interviews, it took a threat to either their homes or way of life to motivate citizens to overcome their aversion to policy and government to pursue formation of a LID and take responsibility for local lake management. Findings therefore provide a useful starting point for understanding citizen perceptions of the state’s water governance system and perceived challenges to actively participating in surface water management activities...|$|R

ForsythLow Impact Development (LID) is an {{emerging}} ecological method {{for planning and}} designing stormwater management. The main goal of LID is that post development hydrology mimic predevelopment hydrology or that of the natural land pattern. The difference between LID and conventional end of pipe engineering is that LID is designed for on-site infiltration. LID was developed in Maryland and has since been adapted to other ecoregions. The introduction and background offer {{a review of the}} importance of ecological stormwater management and the basic principles and techniques of LID. Ecological stormwater management involves understanding and applying ecoregion factors such as: climate, physiography/ landform, geology, soils, and plant associations. This thesis begins with a brief overview of the ecoregional factors associated with the Topeka, Kansas (KS) area. Two case studies of <b>LID</b> type stormwater <b>structures</b> are investigated. The case studies, Jackson Street and Hillcrest, are projects of the City of Topeka Water Pollution Control Division (Topeka, KS). The primary topics investigated include: background, political approval process, condition of site before implementation, general project design, stormwater design, soil, plants, LID principles and techniques used, lessons learned, and a critique of each project. Investigation methods include: personal communication with key individuals involved, and a review of site visits, drawings, specifications, and other projects documents...|$|R

This paper extends the analysis of processes that led to convection initiation (CI), i. e. the transition from shallow to deep convection, on this day with the data from several COPS instruments that have not been considered in previous studies. In particular, the boundary-layer <b>structure,</b> <b>lids</b> and the water-vapour field in the pre-convective environment of the event are discussed. For this purpose, we investigated measurements of water-vapour lidars, temperature lidars and wind lidars, profiles from radiosondes, in situ aircraft data and gridded data of weather stations as well as GPS integrated-water-vapour data and satellite imagery. Thermally driven circulation systems formed over both the Black Forest and the Vosges mountain ranges which resulted in local convergence zones. These superimposed with the large-scale convergence in the Black Forest area. In the presence of sufficient moisture and updraught, clouds formed close to the mountain crests. The related latent-heat release allowed larger thermals to be produced, which may have had a positive feedback on stabilizing these convergence zones as a whole. We believe that differences in the moisture field explain why convection remained shallow and sparse over the Vosges mountains because these differences were responsible for differences in convective inhibition (CIN). The stationary location of the convergence zone over the southern Black Forest was probably decisive for CI because it constantly transported sensible and latent heat into the area in which CI took place...|$|R

Molecular chaperones are a class of proteins responsible for proper folding {{of a large number}} of polypeptides in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Newly synthesized polypeptides are prone to nonspecific interactions, and many of them make toxic aggregates in absence of chaperones. The eukaryotic chaperonin CCT is a large, multisubunit, cylindrical structure having two identical rings stacked back to back. Each ring is composed of eight different but similar subunits and each subunit has three distinct domains. CCT assists folding of actin, tubulin, and numerous other cellular proteins in an ATP-dependent manner. The catalytic cooperativity of ATP binding/hydrolysis in CCT occurs in a sequential manner different from concerted cooperativity as shown for GroEL. Unlike GroEL, CCT does not have GroES-like cofactor, rather it has a built-in <b>lid</b> <b>structure</b> responsible for closing the central cavity. The CCT complex recognizes its substrates through diverse mechanisms involving hydrophobic or electrostatic interactions. Upstream factors like Hsp 70 and Hsp 90 also work in a concerted manner to transfer the substrate to CCT. Moreover, prefoldin, phosducin-like proteins, and Bag 3 protein interact with CCT and modulate its function for the fine-tuning of protei...|$|E
40|$|Mismatch Repair System corrects {{mutations}} {{arising from}} DNA replication that escape from DNA polymerase proofreading activity. This system {{consists of three}} main proteins, MutS-L-H, responsible for lesion recognition and repair. MutL {{is a member of}} GHKL ATPase family and its ATPase cycle has been proposed to modulate MutL activity during the repair process. Pseudomonas aeruginosa MutL (PaMutL) contains an N-terminal (NTD) ATPase domain connected by a linker to a C-terminal (CTD) dimerization domain that possesses metal ion-dependent endonuclease activity. With the aim to identify characteristics that allow the PaMutL NTD allosteric control of CTD endonuclease activity, we used an in silico and experimental approach to determine the interaction surfaces of P. aeruginosa NTD (PaNTD), and compared it with the well characterized Escherichia coli MutL NTD (EcNTD). Molecular dynamics simulations of PaNTD and EcNTD bound to or free of adenosine nucleotides showed that a significant difference exists between the behavior of the EcNTD and PaNTD dimerization interface, particularly in the ATP <b>lid.</b> <b>Structure</b> based simulations of MutL homologues with endonuclease activity were performed that allowed an insight of the dimerization interface behavior in this family of proteins. Our experimental results show that, unlike EcNTD, PaNTD is dimeric in presence of ADP. Simulations in mixed solvent allowed us to identify the PaNTD putative DNA binding patch and a putative interaction patch located opposite to the dimerization face. Structure based simulations of PaNTD dimer in presence of ADP or ATP suggest that nucleotide binding coul...|$|E
40|$|Triacylglycerol lipases (EC 3. 1. 1. 3) {{catalyze}} both hydrolysis {{and synthesis}} reactions {{with a broad}} spectrum of substrates rendering them especially suitable for many biotechnological applications. Most lipases used today originate from mesophilic organisms and are susceptible to thermal denaturation whereas only few possess high thermotolerance. Here, we report on the identification and characterization of two novel thermostable bacterial lipases identified by functional metagenomic screenings. Metagenomic libraries were constructed from enrichment cultures maintained at 65 to 75 °C and screened resulting in the identification of initially 10 clones with lipolytic activities. Subsequently, two ORFs were identified encoding lipases, LipS and LipT. Comparative sequence analyses suggested that both enzymes are members of novel lipase families. LipS is a 30. 2 kDa protein and revealed a half-life of 48 h at 70 °C. The lipT gene encoded for a multimeric enzyme with a half-life of 3 h at 70 °C. LipS had an optimum temperature at 70 °C and LipT at 75 °C. Both enzymes catalyzed hydrolysis of long-chain (C 12 and C 14) fatty acid esters and additionally hydrolyzed a number of industry-relevant substrates. LipS was highly specific for (R) -ibuprofen-phenyl ester with an enantiomeric excess (ee) of 99 %. Furthermore, LipS was able to synthesize 1 -propyl laurate and 1 -tetradecyl myristate at 70 °C with rates {{similar to those of the}} lipase CalB from Candida antarctica. LipS represents the first example of a thermostable metagenome-derived lipase with significant synthesis activities. Its X-ray structure was solved with a resolution of 1. 99 Å revealing an unusually compact <b>lid</b> <b>structure...</b>|$|E
40|$|Flavonoids {{represent}} a large class of secondary metabolites produced by plants. These polyphenolic compounds {{are well known}} for their antioxidative abilities, are antimicrobial phytoalexins responsible for flower pigmentation to attract pollinators and, {{in addition to other}} properties, are also specific bacterial regulators governing the expression of Rhizobium genes involved in root nodulation (Firmin et al., 1986). The bacterial chalcone isomerase (CHI) from Eubacterium ramulus catalyses {{the first step in a}} flavanone-degradation pathway by ring opening of (2 S) -naringenin to form naringenin chalcone. The structural biology and enzymology of plant CHIs have been well documented, whereas the existence of bacterial CHIs has only recently been elucidated. This first determination of the structure of a bacterial CHI provides detailed structural insights into the key step of the flavonoid-degradation pathway. The active site could be confirmed by co-crystallization with the substrate (2 S) -naringenin. The stereochemistry of the proposed mechanism of the isomerase reaction was verified by specific $^ 1 H/^ 2 H$ isotope exchange observed by 1 H NMR experiments and was further supported by mutagenesis studies. The active site is shielded by a flexible <b>lid,</b> the varying <b>structure</b> of which could be modelled in different states of the catalytic cycle using small-angle X-ray scattering data together with the crystallographic structures. Comparison of bacterial CHI with the plant enzyme from Medicago sativa reveals that they have unrelated folds, suggesting that the enzyme activity evolved convergently from different ancestor proteins. Despite the lack of any functional relationship, the tertiary structure of the bacterial CHI shows similarities to the ferredoxin-like fold of a chlorite dismutase and the stress-related protein SP 1...|$|R

40|$|The class kinetoplastida include parasites {{responsible}} for devastating diseases like African sleeping sickness, Chagas’s disease and Leishmaniases, mainly effecting {{people in the}} developing world. Current treatments are highly toxic and inefficient, leading to an urgent need of novel anti-parasitic compounds. This thesis focuses on the structural characterisation of potential drug targets against these parasites, namely adenosine kinase from Trypanosoma brucei (TbAK), thymidine kinases from T. brucei (TbTK) and Leishmania major (LmTK) and the leucyl aminopeptidases from T. brucei (TbLAP-A), T. cruzi (TcLAP-A) and L. major (LmLAP-A). Structures of TbAK were solved in two conformations, open (apo) and closed (in complex with adenosine and ADP), both to 2. 6 Å. Comprised of a big α/β-domain and a small <b>lid</b> domain, the <b>structures</b> confirm the large conformational change of the lid domain upon substrate binding. The structures of C-terminally truncated versions of LmTK and TbTK were determined as ligand-bound complexes with resolutions up to 2. 4 Å and 2. 2 Å, respectively. They show high similarity to structures of homologues in the PDB. The structures solved in this thesis give valuable information about ligand binding and aid rational drug design. Leucyl aminopeptidase (LAP-A) was evaluated as a potential drug target in T. brucei parasites. It is not essential for T. brucei parasites grown in vitro, shown by generation and analysis of LAP-A-depleted parasites. Although this does not support LAP-A as a drug target in T. brucei, no conclusions can be drawn about the potential in T. cruzi and L. major. Several structures of the LAP-As were solved, the highest resolution ones to 2. 3 Å, 2. 3 Å and 2. 5 Å for TbLAP-A, TcLAP-A and LmLAP-A, respectively. These enzymes are hexameric and show the typical two-domain architecture of M 17 LAPs. Although the physiological function remains elusive, the work in this thesis provides a firm basis for future studies...|$|R
