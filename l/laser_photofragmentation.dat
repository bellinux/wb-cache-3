40|$|This lecture {{will focus}} on several {{experimental}} approaches under development in our laboratory to address relevant problems of interest for both homogeneous and heterogeneous atmospheric chemistry. <b>Laser</b> <b>Photofragmentation</b> (LPF) and Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) are used to study the oxidation mechanism of Dimethyl Sulphide (DMS), leading {{to the formation of}} sulphuric acid aerosols. These aerosols, generated in the laboratory by homogeneous nucleation, are characterised with a Differential Mobility Analyser before entering the laser excitation volume. Time resolution of the resu;lting emission, which could be ascribed to sulphur dioxide adsorbed on the aerosol surface, is performed with a gated Optical multichannel Analyser. JRC.

40|$|<b>Laser</b> <b>photofragmentation</b> of Si, Ge, and GaAs {{positive}} cluster ions {{prepared by}} laser vaporization and supersonic beam expansion {{has been investigated}} in a tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Si n + up to size 80, Ge n + and Ga xAs y + up {{to a total of}} 31 atoms have been studied. Ga xAs y + fragment in a nearly uniform pattern probably via a step-loss of atoms pattern with odd fragments being more prominent than their even neighbors. Both Si n + and Ge n + of all sizes show as one fragmentation channel loss of one atom to produce Sin- 1 + or Gen- 1 +. In addition, Si n + and Ge n + in the size range n = 10 - 30 photofragment to produce positive ions of about one half the mass of the parent. For Ge n + as n becomes greater than 30, this fragmentation becomes a pattern in which positive ions containing 10 (or 7) fewer atoms are the principal products at low laser fluence. Increased fluence seems to fragment these daughters {{in the same way as}} they would behave as primary ions. The Si n + ions of greater than 30 atoms do not show this 10 or 7 atom neutral loss. Both Si n + and Ge n + for n > 30 show an additional channel in which small positive ion fragments in the n = 6 to 11 size range are produced. This channel requires high fluence and is shown to involve at least two 6. 4 eV (ArF) photons for Si 60 +. The absence of intermediate fragments in this channel suggests that these large cluster ions break down into several clusters because the positive charge would be expected to stay with the larger fragment in a fission into two clusters as the ionization potentials of the neutral clusters decrease with size. A reflectron tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometer has been designed and constructed. The resultant high resolution makes the apparatus a highly efficient instrument for fragmentation and spectroscopic studies...|$|E
40|$|The {{energetic}} and dissociation dynamics of (C(, 2) H(, 4)) (, 2) (2 ̆ 7 +), (C(, 2) H(, 4)) (, 3) (2 ̆ 7 +), (C(, 3) H(, 6)) (, 2) (2 ̆ 7 +) and (c-C(, 3) H(, 6)) (, 2) (2 ̆ 7 +) complexes {{have been studied}} by photoionization of neutral van der Waals ethylene dimers and trimers, propylene dimers and cyclopropane dimers. Photoionization efficiency studies of C(, 2) H(, 4), C(, 3) H(, 6) and c-C(, 3) H(, 6) and their clusters yield the ionization energies of (C(, 2) H(, 4)) (,n= 1, 2, 3), (C(, 3) H(, 6)) (,n= 1, 2) and (c-C(, 3) H(, 6)) (,n= 1, 2) and the appearance energies of C(, 3) H(, 5) (2 ̆ 7 +) and C(, 4) H(, 7) (2 ̆ 7 +) from (C(, 2) H(, 4)) (, 2). With the estimated values of (C(, 2) H(, 4)) (,n= 2, 3, 4), (C(, 3) H(, 6)) (, 2) and (c-C(, 3) H(, 6)) (, 2), the bond dissociation energies of (C(, 2) H(, 4)) (,n= 1, 2, 3) (2 ̆ 7 +) C(, 2) H(, 4), C(, 3) H(, 6) (2 ̆ 7 +) C(, 3) H(, 6) and c-C(, 3) H(, 6) (2 ̆ 7 +) c-C(, 3) H(, 6) are deduced. It is concluded that the (C(, 2) H(, 4)) (, 3) (2 ̆ 7 +), (C(, 3) H(, 6)) (, 2) (2 ̆ 7 +) and (c-C(, 3) H(, 6)) (, 2) (2 ̆ 7 +) loose complexes arrange to the common C(, 6) H 12 + collision complexes prior to fragmentation by comparing the major product channels in the unimolecular decompositions of these species. A new molecular beam laser photofragment time-of-flight mass spectrometer with rotatable beam source and movable detector has been constructed for studying photofragmentation dynamics of polyatomic molecules. The design considerations detailed assembly, and initial tests of this machine are described. The time-of-flight data of carbon disulfide <b>laser</b> <b>photofragmentation</b> at 193 nm have been taken at various beam source angles and fragment flight path lengths. The results give insight into {{the dynamics of the}} photofragmentation process;*USDOE Report IS-T- 1260. This work was performed under Contract No. W- 7405 -Eng- 82 with the U. S.

40|$|In the {{photodissociation}} of acetophenone (C 6 H 5 COCH 3) at 193 nm, {{two major}} primary processes, C 6 H 5 COCH 3 + h[nu] → C 6 H 5 CO + CH 3 (process 1) and C 6 H 5 + COCH 3 (process 2), are observed. Data analysis shows that excited C 6 H 5 CO and CH 3 CO thus formed further decompose, yielding secondary products C 6 H 5 + CO and CH 3 + CO, respectively. For 248 nm excitation, the C 6 H 5 CO-CH 3 bond energy {{has been determined}} to be 80. 2 ± 3 kcal/mol. Evidence is {{also found that the}} dissociation reaction C 6 H 5 COCH 3 + hv→ C 6 H 5 CH 3 + CO occurs for excitation at both 193 and 248 nm;In the photodissociation of dimethylsulfoxide [(CH 3) 2 SO] at 193. 3 nm, in addition to CH 3 and SO, CH 3 SO is observed as a stable primary product, indicating that CH 3 SO + CH 3 is an important product process. Analysis of the TOF data provides evidence that SO is formed via a stepwise mechanism: (CH 3) 2 SO + h[nu](193. 3 nm) → CH 3 SO + CH 3 → 2 CH 3 + SO.;In the photodissociation of HSCH 2 CH 2 SH at 193. 3 nm, {{on the basis of the}} observed maximum kinetic energy for the formation of HS + CH 2 CH 2 SH, a value of 74 ± 2 kcal/mol is derived for the bond dissociation energy of HS- CH 2 CH 2 SH at 0 K [D 0 (HS- CH 2 CH 2 SH]. Angular distribution measurements for SH yield an anisotropic parameter [beta] = - 0. 4 ± 0. 1 for the HS + CH 2 CH 2 SH process, indicating that the C-S bond fission is fast with respect to molecular rotation;In the photodissociation of thiophene at 193. 3 nm, the thiophene biradical decay dynamics has been studied as the primary <b>laser</b> <b>photofragmentation</b> product. The derived P(Ec. m) for these processes show characteristics of unimolecular decay;In the scattering cross section measurements for O(3 P) [SO(X, 3 [sigma]-) ] + He[Ne, Ar, Kr], the scattering behavior for O(3 P) + He[Ne, Ar, Kr] obeys the rigid sphere model at high velocities. The measurements for SO(X, 3 [sigma]-) + He[Ne, Ar, Kr] show that the interaction potential is of the form V(r) = ±Cn/rn. Values for Cn and n were also determined...|$|E
