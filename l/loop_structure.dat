5|$|The {{first step}} in fusion {{involves}} the high-affinity attachment of the CD4 binding domains of gp120 to CD4. Once gp120 is bound with the CD4 protein, the envelope complex undergoes a structural change, exposing the chemokine receptor binding domains of gp120 and allowing them {{to interact with the}} target chemokine receptor. This allows for a more stable two-pronged attachment, which allows the N-terminal fusion peptide gp41 to penetrate the cell membrane. Repeat sequences in gp41, HR1, and HR2 then interact, causing the collapse of the extracellular portion of gp41 into a hairpin. This <b>loop</b> <b>structure</b> brings the virus and cell membranes close together, allowing fusion of the membranes and subsequent entry of the viral capsid.|$|E

The method constructively segments credible <b>loop</b> <b>structures</b> by exploiting the Gaussian-like shape of loop cross-sectional intensity profiles.

25|$|Evidence {{supporting}} this claim identified that decreased m6A {{levels in the}} transcriptome lead to significantly reduced HNRNPC binding, thus alternative splicing is co-regulated by methylation and HNRNPC binding activity. However, the m6A modification does not directly cause protein binding. Rather, it alters the <b>loop</b> <b>structure</b> to regulate gene expression by acting as a switch that exposes the HNRNPC region. It is essentially a two-step, co-regulatory mechanism prevalent in biochemistry in controlling alternative splicing. Note that demethylase enzyme can indeed “erase” the methyl group, thus inhibiting alternative splicing which is the reverse of the two-step regulation mechanism.|$|E

2500|$|In this group, primer-dependent RNA {{synthesis}} utilizes a small 22–25 {{amino acid}} long viral protein {{linked to the}} genome (VPg) to initiate polymerase activity, where the primer is covalently bound to the 5’ end of the RNA template. [...] The uridylylation occurs at a tyrosine residue at the third position of the VPg. A cis-acting replication element (CRE), which is a RNA stem <b>loop</b> <b>structure,</b> serves as a template for the uridylylation of VPg, resulting in the synthesis of VPgpUpUOH. Mutations within the CRE-RNA structure prevent VPg uridylylation, and mutations within the VPg sequence can severely diminish RdRp catalytic activity. While the tyrosine hydroxyl of VPg can prime negative-strand RNA synthesis in a CRE- and VPgpUpUOH-independent manner, CRE-dependent VPgpUpUOH synthesis is absolutely required for positive-strand RNA synthesis. CRE-dependent VPg uridylylation lowers the Km¬ of UTP required for viral RNA replication and CRE-dependent VPgpUpUOH synthesis, and is required for efficient negative-strand RNA synthesis, especially when UTP concentrations are limiting. The VPgpUpUOH primer is transferred to the 3’ end of the RNA template for elongation, which can continue by addition of nucleotide bases by RdRp. Partial crystal structures for VPgs of {{foot and mouth disease}} virus and coxsackie virus B3 suggest that there may be two sites on the viral polymerase for the small VPgs of the picornaviruses. NMR solution structures of poliovirus VPg and VPgpU show that uridylylation stabilizes the structure of the VPg, which is otherwise quite flexible in solution. [...] The second site may be used for uridylylation, after which the VPgpU can initiate RNA synthesis. It {{should be noted that the}} VPg primers of caliciviruses, whose structures are only beginning to be revealed, are much larger than those of the picornaviruses. Mechanisms for uridylylation and priming may be quite different in all of these groups.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose the}} use of cyclic {{interval}} graphs as an alternative representation for register allocation. The "thickness" of the cyclic interval graph captures the notion of overlap between live ranges of variables relative to each particular point {{of time in the}} program execution. It is effective in capturing the regular periodic nature of loop-carried dependent live ranges found in loops. As most scientific code {{spend a lot of time}} executing <b>loop</b> <b>structures,</b> it is most crucial to perform well when register allocating for it. A good spilling algorithm and a close to optimal coloring algorithm is invaluable in minimizing the cost that may be incurred while performing register allocation for <b>loop</b> <b>structures.</b> Minimization of spill code often greatly increases the performance of the code. Our proposed spilling and coloring scheme is very well suited to these <b>loop</b> <b>structures,</b> and could be used to reap maximum benefit when used in tandem with loop scheduling algorithms (NG 93, Nin 93).
