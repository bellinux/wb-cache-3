5000|$|Kewlstart is a {{coined term}} for an {{extension}} of <b>loop</b> <b>start</b> (FXO and FXS) signaling which adds disconnect supervision {{through the use of}} an open switching interval (OSI). In addition to the operation afforded by <b>loop</b> <b>start,</b> the CO (central office) signals the terminal (user) end that the distant party has hung up. The CO switch will remove battery voltage from the loop for about 250 ms, within 6 seconds after the far-end party disconnects.|$|E

5000|$|CAP {{involves}} six steps, {{combined in}} a [...] "Learning Loop". Once all six steps are completed, a milestone is reached and the <b>loop</b> <b>starts</b> over again. The loop is constantly repeated as {{the business is}} developing.|$|R
50|$|Some buses in the Blue Mountains {{area are}} tourist buses (such as Trolley Tours {{which is part}} of Blue Mountains Transit, and the Blue Mountains Explorer Bus) running <b>loops</b> <b>starting</b> at Katoomba through various attractions or lookouts.|$|R
50|$|<b>Loop</b> <b>start,</b> ground start, reverse {{battery and}} revertive pulse systems are all DC, thus out of band, {{and all are}} channel-associated, since the DC {{currents}} are on the talking wires.|$|E
50|$|Telephone {{companies}} typically provide {{two types}} of dial tone switched circuits - ground start and <b>loop</b> <b>start.</b> Private branch exchanges (PBX) work best on ground start trunks because those trunks can give them an on hook signal allowing for timely clearing.|$|E
50|$|For old, analog PBX trunks, glare {{would be}} reduced by using ground start signalling, which offered better answer and {{disconnect}} supervision. IE: Nortel BSP discouraged using <b>loop</b> <b>start</b> trunks for this and other reasons. Long Distance exchanges in the 1950s and 60s incorporated Glare Detectors to alleviate the problem.|$|E
25|$|In the Henry {{system of}} classification, {{there are three}} basic {{fingerprint}} patterns: loop, whorl, and arch, which constitute 60–65%, 30–35%, and 5% of all fingerprints respectively. There are also more complex classification systems that break down patterns even further, into plain arches or tented arches, and into loops that may be radial or ulnar, depending {{on the side of}} the hand toward which the tail points. Ulnar <b>loops</b> <b>start</b> on the pinky-side of the finger, the side closer to the ulna, the lower arm bone. Radial <b>loops</b> <b>start</b> on the thumb-side of the finger, the side closer to the radius. Whorls may also have sub-group classifications including plain whorls, accidental whorls, double loop whorls, peacock's eye, composite, and central pocket loop whorls.|$|R
30|$|Then a <b>loop</b> <b>starts</b> at line 9. In each {{iteration}} of this loop, at line 12 {{the status}} of a machine is set to open (i.e. “not scheduled”), and at line 14 the sub-problem corresponding to that machine is given to the Carlier procedure to be solved.|$|R
50|$|The {{marathon}} makes a <b>loop,</b> <b>starting</b> {{and ending}} in the City of Brussels, in {{the proximity of}} Brussels Park. Initially the runners head eastwards, to Tervuren. Alongside the track, the participants pass several green areas: the Cinquantenaire Park, the Woluwe Park, the Capuchin Forest, the Royal Belgian Golf Club and the Bois de la Cambre.|$|R
50|$|<b>Loop</b> <b>start</b> {{signaling}} cannot detect simultaneous {{seizure of}} the line on both ends, commonly called glare, when used on trunk lines. The protocol imposes no requirement to the central office end to inform the subscriber end of distant far-end disconnection conditions. Such conditions are properly recognized in ground start signaling, a protocol primarily used on trunks between switching systems.|$|E
50|$|With Super Frame framing, the robbed bits {{are named}} A and B. With Extended Super Frame, the same stream {{is divided into}} four bits, named A, B, C, and D. The {{meanings}} of these bits depend on what type of signaling is provisioned on the channel. The most common types of signaling are <b>loop</b> <b>start,</b> ground start, and E&M.|$|E
50|$|<b>Loop</b> <b>start</b> is a {{telecommunications}} supervisory protocol between a central office or {{private branch exchange}} (PBX) and a subscriber telephone {{for the purpose of}} starting and terminating a telephone call. It is the simplest of the telephone signaling systems, and uses {{the presence or absence of}} loop current to indicate the off-hook and on-hook loop states, respectively. It is used primarily for subscriber line signaling.|$|E
40|$|Inference on factor graphs with loops {{with the}} {{standard}} forwardbackward algorithm, can give unpredictible results as messages can travel indefinitely in the system with no guarantee on convergence. We apply the exact method of cutset conditioning to Factor Graphs with <b>loops</b> <b>starting</b> from a fully developed three-variable example and providing comments and suggestions for distributed implementations...|$|R
50|$|The {{most famous}} route at Glentrool is the 'Big Country' trail, based entirely on minor public roads and forest roads. The trail follows 58 km of {{road in a}} <b>loop,</b> <b>starting</b> and {{finishing}} at the Glentrool visitor centre. There are no areas of off-road biking allowing riders of all experiences and age ranges {{to have a good}} time.|$|R
5000|$|Each {{iteration}} of the <b>loop</b> <b>starting</b> at line B09 either adds {{to a tree}} T in F (line B10) or {{finds an}} augmenting path (line B17) or finds a blossom (line B20).

50|$|If {{the call}} {{originates}} on a POTS line (a standard <b>loop</b> <b>start</b> line), then caller ID {{is provided by}} the service provider's local switch. Since the network does not connect the caller to the callee until the phone is answered, generally the caller ID signal cannot be altered by the caller. Most service providers however, allow the caller to block caller ID presentation through the vertical service code *67.|$|E
5000|$|In a nutshell, an FXO {{device is}} any device that, {{from the point}} of view of a {{telephone}} exchange, appears to be a regular telephone. As such, it should be able to accept ringing signals, go on-hook and off-hook, and send and receive voice frequency signals. It may use <b>loop</b> <b>start</b> or ground start signaling. FXO channel units were invented and named in the middle 20th century for service at the [...] "Office" [...] end of an FX line via carrier system.|$|E
50|$|Modern <b>loop</b> <b>start</b> trunks {{often provide}} {{additional}} methods supervision {{to avoid the}} far-end-disconnect problem. Answer supervision and disconnect supervision are extensions to alert a foreign exchange office (FXO) interface that the remote party has answered or hung up. Answer supervision usually {{takes the form of}} the central office reversing the polarity of the line (battery reversal) {{for the duration of the}} call when it has been answered. For disconnect supervision the polarity may reverse back, or the battery voltage may be removed from the line for a short period of time.|$|E
50|$|Loops {{were like}} Facebook groups, and based around friendships and shared {{interests}} such as sports, crafts, music and fan groups. Kids could join existing <b>loops</b> or <b>start</b> <b>loops</b> of their own. Parents used the parent dashboard to approve each loop their child joins.|$|R

50|$|The railway {{consisted}} of two separate <b>loops</b> both <b>starting</b> and ending at Union Station.|$|R
50|$|Line ferrods {{were also}} {{provided}} in pairs, {{of which the}} even numbered one had contacts brought out {{to the front of}} the package in lugs suitable for wire wrap so the windings could be strapped for <b>loop</b> <b>start</b> or ground start signaling. The original 1ESS packaging had all the ferrods of an LSF together, and separate from the line switches, while the later 1AESS had each ferrod at the front of the steel box containing its line switch. Odd numbered line equipment could not be made ground start, their ferrods being inaccessible.|$|E
50|$|A managed facilities-based voice network, or MFVN, is a {{physical}} network {{owned and operated by}} a voice service provider that delivers traditional telephone service via a <b>loop</b> <b>start</b> analog telephone interface. MFVNs are interconnected with the public switched telephone network (PSTN) and provide dialtone to end users. Historically, this was provided by equipment at Bell company central offices, however today's MFVNs can include a combination of access network (last mile network of copper, coaxial cable, or fiber optics), customer premises equipment (CPE), network switches and routers, network management systems, voice call servers, and gateways to the larger PSTN.|$|E
5000|$|Instrument pages {{would be}} prefixed by {{clicking}} a Mode (Load, Command, or Edit) -- yielding functions relating to loading, editing, and tweaking EPS sampled instruments. Instruments could contain {{a number of}} discrete samples which were patched into Layers - each with their own ADSR-like envelopes and keyboard ranges. A loop editor allowed you to define envelopes, cross-fades, and sample start-end, and loop points in real-time. It was possible to modulate the <b>loop</b> <b>start</b> with any source to give complex evolving sounds. On the EPS-16+ the Transwave loop mode allowed the start point to be modulated in exact [...] "single-cycle" [...] steps, giving effects similar to the PPG Wave. The Ensoniq manuals were famous for including quality tutorials for sampling and editing new sounds.|$|E
30|$|Use of {{optional}} vena cava filters {{has steadily}} increased. In {{the majority of}} cases removal is successful using standard techniques. In cases of tilting and migration of the filter however, more advanced techniques are necessary. The “loop-snare” technique has been described for such cases. Difficulties arise when the <b>loop</b> <b>starts</b> to slip around the legs and arms of the filter.|$|R
50|$|Buses {{were one}} of the main methods of {{transport}} for passengers and staff until the opening of Changi Airport station. Services operated by SBS Transit, SMRT Buses and Go-Ahead Group uses the bus terminals in the basement level of the three main terminals, making a <b>loop</b> <b>starting</b> from Terminal 3 to Terminals 1, and 2, and back to their destination of origin.|$|R
