500|$|The act {{of hiring}} a ship to carry cargo is called chartering. [...] Tankers are hired by {{four types of}} charter agreements: the voyage charter, the time charter, the bareboat charter, and {{contract}} of affreightment. In a voyage charter the charterer rents the vessel from the <b>loading</b> <b>port</b> to the discharge port. In a time charter the vessel is hired for a set period of time, to perform voyages as the charterer directs. In a bareboat charter the charterer acts as the ship's operator and manager, taking on responsibilities such as providing the crew and maintaining the vessel. Finally, in a contract of affreightment or COA, the charterer specifies a total volume of cargo to be carried in a specific time period and in specific sizes, for example a COA could be specified as [...] of JP-5 in a year's time in [...] shipments. A completed chartering contract {{is known as a}} charter party.|$|E
5000|$|This firearm {{features}} a unique <b>loading</b> <b>port</b> {{on the left}} side of the receiver. [...] As the first round is loaded, the shell is lifted by a mechanism and chambered by the bolt; once the bolt is closed, the lifting mechanism returns to the resting position below the <b>loading</b> <b>port,</b> where the next round can then be loaded. Upon firing the chambered round, the shell in the <b>loading</b> <b>port</b> is automatically chambered. The total capacity is 2 with 1 chambered round and 1 in the <b>loading</b> <b>port.</b>|$|E

40|$|International {{audience}} Scheduling {{decisions in}} the diffusion area of a semiconductor manufacturing facility have an important impact on the overall performance of a plant. Consequently, we want to optimize those decisions while taking real-world constraints into account. The problem we address is a generalization of a job shop with multiple resources per operation. We aim to optimize several objectives that comprise throughput and waiting time. The operations to be performed in the diffusion area are cleaning or furnace operations that need specific machines. To obtain practicable schedules, we consider complex machines of that area in detail and include their components as resources in our model. Complex machines consist of tubes, boats and a <b>load</b> <b>port.</b> A tube {{is the place where}} processes are conducted. A boat is a moveable carrier for wafers needed for all operations in a machine. The <b>load</b> <b>port</b> is the place where wafers are loaded and unloaded. For those resources, we are given synchronization constraints that can be explained using two characteristic examples: Firstly, if a loading operation uses the <b>load</b> <b>port</b> of a machine, the corresponding unloading operation must use the <b>load</b> <b>port</b> of the same machine. Secondly, after a specific boat is loaded, it cannot be used elsewhere before being unloaded. So, a resource can be blocked even if no operation is currently using it. Many approaches from literature extend the job shop problem to the needs of realworld problems. However, we are not aware of any work that addresses resource dependencies as described above. For the given problem, we present a construction algorithm to find an initial solution. We propose a suitable disjunctive graph representation that adapts ideas from Dauzère-Pérès and Paulli (1997) and introduce moves that form a basis for different metaheuristics. Finally, we present results of an implementation. </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the problem of}} modelling an LNG supply chain efficiently. The production, processing, transportation and consumption of LNG (Liquid National Gas) and the associated products are a topic of major interest in the energy industry. While the problem is apparently continuous, analysis suggests that this problem can be modelled using discrete, deterministic techniques. A method involving a modification of the Three Phase discrete technique was used. Analysis {{of the way in}} which the effects of an event spread leads to a method by which excessive recalculation can be avoided, yielding a model that is computationally very efficient. 1 OVERVIEW OF THE PROBLEM An LNG supply chain consists at the highest level of <b>loading</b> <b>ports</b> shipping LNG to one or more receiving ports.
