40|$|The {{divergence}} of archaea, {{bacteria and}} eukaryotes was a fundamental step in evolution. One marker {{of this event}} is a major difference in membrane lipid chemistry between these kingdoms. Whereas the membranes of bacteria and eukaryotes primarily consist of straight fatty acids ester-bonded to glycerol- 3 -phosphate, archaeal phospholipids consist of isoprenoid chains ether-bonded to glycerol- 1 -phosphate. Notably, the mechanisms underlying the biosynthesis of these <b>lipids</b> <b>remain</b> <b>elusive.</b> Here, we report {{the structure of the}} CDP-archaeol synthase (CarS) of Aeropyrum pernix (ApCarS) in the CTP- and Mg(2 +) -bound state at a resolution of 2. 4 Å. The enzyme comprises a transmembrane domain with five helices and cytoplasmic loops that together form a large charged cavity providing a binding site for CTP. Identification of the binding location of CTP and Mg(2 +) enabled modeling of the specific lipophilic substrate-binding site, which was supported by site-directed mutagenesis, substrate-binding affinity analyses, and enzyme assays. We propose that archaeol binds within two hydrophobic membrane-embedded grooves formed by the flexible transmembrane helix 5 (TM 5), together with TM 1 and TM 4. Collectively, structural comparisons and analyses, combined with functional studies, not only elucidated the mechanism governing the biosynthesis of phospholipids with ether-bonded isoprenoid chains by CTP transferase, but also provided insights into the evolution of this enzyme superfamily from archaea to bacteria and eukaryotes.

40|$|Obesity is {{characterized}} by accumulation of excess body fat, while lipodystrophy {{is characterized}} by loss or absence of body fat. Despite their opposite phenotypes, these two conditions both cause ectopic lipid storage in non-adipose tissues, leading to lipotoxicity, which has health-threatening consequences. The exact mechanisms underlying ectopic <b>lipid</b> storage <b>remain</b> <b>elusive.</b> Here we report the analysis of a Drosophila model of the most severe form of human lipodystrophy, Berardinelli-Seip Congenital Lipodystrophy 2, which is caused by mutations in the BSCL 2 /Seipin gene. In addition to reduced lipid storage in the fat body, dSeipin mutant flies accumulate ectopic lipid droplets in the salivary gland, a non-adipose tissue. This phenotype was suppressed by expressing dSeipin specifically within the salivary gland. dSeipin mutants display synergistic genetic interactions with lipogenic genes {{in the formation of}} ectopic lipid droplets. Our data suggest that dSeipin may participate in phosphatidic acid metabolism and subsequently down-regulate lipogenesis to prevent ectopic lipid droplet formation. In summary, we have demonstrated a tissue-autonomous role of dSeipin in ectopic lipid storage in lipodystrophy...|$|R
40|$|Yeast phosphatidylinositol {{transfer}} protein (Sec 14 p) coordinates {{lipid metabolism}} with protein-trafficking events. This essential Sec 14 p requirement for Golgi function is bypassed by mutations {{in any one}} of seven genes that control phosphatidylcholine or phosphoinositide metabolism. In addition to these “bypass Sec 14 p” mutations, Sec 14 p-independent Golgi function requires phospholipase D activity. The identities of lipids that mediate Sec 14 p-dependent Golgi function, and the identity of the proteins that respond to Sec 14 p-mediated regulation of <b>lipid</b> metabolism, <b>remain</b> <b>elusive.</b> We now report genetic evidence to suggest that two ADP ribosylation factor-GTPase–activating proteins (ARFGAPs), Gcs 1 p and Age 2 p, may represent these lipid-responsive elements, and that Gcs 1 p/Age 2 p act downstream of Sec 14 p and phospholipase D in both Sec 14 p-dependent and Sec 14 p-independent pathways for yeast Golgi function. In support, biochemical data indicate that Gcs 1 p and Age 2 p ARFGAP activities are both modulated by lipids implicated in regulation of Sec 14 p pathway function. These results suggest ARFGAPs are stimulatory factors required for regulation of Golgi function by the Sec 14 p pathway, and that Sec 14 p-mediated regulation of lipid metabolism interfaces with the activity of proteins involved in control of the ARF cycle...|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{infection}} with the hepatitis C virus frequently induces steatosis, {{which is a}} significant risk factor for liver pathogenesis. Steatosis {{is characterized by the}} accumulation of lipid droplets in hepatocytes. The structural protein core of the virus induces lipid droplet formation and localizes {{on the surface of the}} lipid droplets. However, the precise molecular mechanisms for the core-induced formation of <b>lipid</b> droplets <b>remain</b> <b>elusive.</b> Recently, we showed that the expression of the core protein in yeast as a model system could induce lipid droplet formation. In this study, we probed the cellular factors responsible for the formation of core-induced lipid-droplets in yeast cells. We demonstrated that one of the enzymes responsible for triglyceride synthesis, a phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (Lro 1), is required for the core-induced lipid droplet formation. While core proteins inhibit Lro 1 degradation and alter Lro 1 localization, the characteristic localization of Lro 1 adjacent to the lipid droplets appeared to be responsible for the core-induced lipid droplet formation. RNA virus genomes have evolved using high mutation rates to maintain their ability to replicate. Our observations suggest a functional relationship between the core protein with hepatocytes and yeast cells. The possible interactions between core proteins and the endoplasmic reticulum membrane affect the mobilization of specific proteins...|$|R
40|$|Studies of detergent-resistant {{membrane}} (DRM) rafts in mature erythrocytes have facilitated {{identification of}} proteins that regulate formation of endovacuolar {{structures such as}} the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane (PVM) induced by the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. However, analyses of raft <b>lipids</b> have <b>remained</b> <b>elusive</b> because detergents interfere with lipid detection. Here, we use primaquine to perturb the erythrocyte membrane and induce detergent-free buoyant vesicles, which are enriched in cholesterol and major raft proteins flotillin and stomatin and contain low levels of cytoskeleton, all characteristics of raft microdomains. Lipid mass spectrometry revealed that phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol are depleted in endovesicles while phosphoinositides are highly enriched, suggesting raft-based endovesiculation {{can be achieved by}} simple (non–receptor-mediated) mechanical perturbation of the erythrocyte plasma membrane and results in sorting of inner leaflet phospholipids. Live-cell imaging of lipid-specific protein probes showed that phosphatidylinositol (4, 5) bisphosphate (PIP 2) is highly concentrated in primaquine-induced vesicles, confirming that it is an erythrocyte raft lipid. However, the malarial PVM lacks PIP 2, although another raft lipid, phosphatidylserine, is readily detected. Thus, different remodeling/sorting of cytoplasmic raft phospholipids may occur in distinct endovacuoles. Importantly, erythrocyte raft lipids recruited to the invasion junction by mechanical stimulation may be remodeled by the malaria parasite to establish blood-stage infection...|$|R
