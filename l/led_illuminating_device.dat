40|$|With current technology, UV {{filters are}} {{essential}} to ensure long-term dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) stability. Blocking photons, however, will have an obvious effect on device performance and upon its incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE). Filters have been applied to DSC devices {{with a range of}} cut-off wavelengths in order to assess how different levels of filtering affect the performance and IPCE of devices made with three different dyes, namely N 719, Z 907, and N 749. It is shown that dyes that extend their IPCE further into the NIR region suffer lesser relative efficiency losses due to UV filtering than dyes with narrower action spectra. Furthermore, the results are encouraging to those working towards the industrialisation of DSC technology. From the results presented it can be estimated that filtering at a level intended to prevent direct band gap excitation of the TiO 2 semiconductor should cause a relative drop in cell efficiency of no more than 10 % in forward <b>illuminated</b> <b>devices</b> and no more than 2 % in reverse <b>illuminated</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|R

The difference between two face images captured when the LED light is on and off respectively, {{is the image of}} a face under just the LED illumination, and is independent of ambient illumination. In preliminary experiments with various ambient illuminations, significantly better results are achieved for both automatic and semi-automatic face recognition experiments on <b>LED</b> <b>illuminated</b> faces than on face images under ambient illuminations. ...|$|R

50|$|In {{underwater}} conditions, particles such as sand {{or small}} sea life {{close to the}} lens, invisible to the diver, reflect light from the flash causing the orb artifact in the image. A strobe flash, which distances the flash from the lens, eliminates the artifacts. The effect is also seen on infrared video cameras, where superbright infrared <b>LEDs</b> <b>illuminate</b> microscopic particles {{very close to the}} lens. The artifacts are especially common with compact or ultra-compact cameras, where the short distance between the lens and the built-in flash decreases the angle of light reflection to the lens, directly illuminating the aspect of the particles facing the lens and increasing the camera's ability to capture the light reflected off normally sub-visible particles.|$|R

The display's LED {{illumination}} is first P-polarized and then shines through the in-coupling polarizing beam splitter (PBS) to the LCoS panel.

The in-coupling PBS then reflects the S-polarized areas of light at 45° through the out-coupling beam splitter to a collimating reflector at the other end. Finally, the out-coupling beam splitter (which is a partially reflecting mirror, not a polarizing beam splitter) reflects the collimated light another 45° and into the wearer's eye.|$|R

The advantage of this novel approach is the possibility of illuminating the backside of the thin (2 - 3 Pm) device. The contact metal (of gate, source and drain) is not hindering the light, penetrating into the semiconductor.
