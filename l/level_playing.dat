5|$|As of 2012, {{renewable}} energy {{plays a major}} role in the energy mix of many countries globally. Renewables are becoming increasingly economic in both developing and developed countries. Prices for {{renewable energy}} technologies, primarily wind power and solar power, continued to drop, making renewables competitive with conventional energy sources. Without a <b>level</b> <b>playing</b> field, however, high market penetration of renewables is still dependent on a robust promotional policies. Fossil fuel subsidies, which are far higher than those for renewable energy, remain in place and quickly need to be phased out.|$|E

5|$|The {{content is}} divided into five parts. The first part, Ancient Balances, {{considers}} psychological and historical aspects of debt. Atwood calls debt an imaginative human construct derived {{from a sense of}} need or greed and a sense of fairness in reciprocity and equivalent values. She cites a study by Frans de Waal that suggests a sense of fairness may be a genetic trait shared with other primates, and a study by Robert Axelrod which illustrates, given a <b>level</b> <b>playing</b> field, that the tit-for-tat strategy (or 'Do unto others as they have done onto you' strategy) was the most superior strategy in game theory. Debt and borrowing mechanisms from ancient and biblical societies are compared, including provisions from the Code of Hammurabi, Ancient Egyptians, and the Greco-Roman mythologies.|$|E
5|$|The {{goal of this}} {{executive}} order is to help address questions about favoritism in city contracting by preventing conflicts of interest, or even the appearance of such conflicts.... There should be a <b>level</b> <b>playing</b> field, where no one has an advantage—or a disadvantage—in obtaining city contracts, simply because they know me or anyone else in government.... Under the steps I'm taking today and recommending to the City Council, the public can easily learn {{everything there is to}} know about a city contract: who is involved, who will benefit and whether the city is paying a fair price. I and every other city official must be prepared to defend every contract on its merits.|$|E

5|$|U.S. diplomats were {{concerned}} that the move {{would be seen as}} a power grab, as Diệm was organising and driving an electoral process in which he was a candidate. The Americans felt that a legislature should be formed first and that the body should oversee the referendum, but Diệm ignored their advice. Ambassador G. Frederick Reinhardt informed Washington that Diệm had no intention of allowing a <b>level</b> <b>playing</b> field for the opposition, and that the foreign press had already made much of Diệm's democratic pronouncements being a facade. The Department of State agreed and opted to avoid trumpeting the referendum as an exercise in democracy for fear of attracting negative reactions to their foreign policy. Nevertheless, U.S. officials in Vietnam were pleased with the referendum, as they saw it as an opportunity to strengthen South Vietnam and avoid defeat to the communists, as they saw a republican model as being more robust.|$|E
5|$|Following his draft, Bowman {{participated in}} his first NHL {{training}} camp in September 2007 before being returned to Spokane to continue playing at the junior <b>level.</b> <b>Playing</b> in his third full WHL season, Bowman recorded a team-leading 82 points in 66 games.

The league title earned the Chiefs a berth in the 2008 Memorial Cup in Kitchener, Ontario. Bowman notched a hat trick in the opening game of the tournament, including the game-tying goal late {{in the third period}} of a 5–4 overtime win over the Belleville Bulls. He went on to score in all four games of the tournament, including game-winners against the Kitchener Rangers in the round-robin and final.

5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{was intended}} to stay true to the Dragon Quest formula within the design necessities and limitations of an MMORPG. During an earlier development phase, the UI featured {{a large amount of}} information showing the various player statuses, but seeking to streamline and simplify the game, they removed most of the display. A different gameplay challenge was presented by the move from turn-based to real-time battles, which went against the traditions of the Dragon Quest series. Fujisawa wanted to implement the classic battle system, but was opposed by Horii and other staff members, who successfully pushed for a real-time combat system. Elements of that battle system, such as the ability to halt enemy momentum as a battle mechanic, proved extremely challenging for the developers. Speaking about the difference between Dragon Quest X and Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn, Yoshida said that they needed to preserve the atmosphere of a normal Dragon Quest title despite MMORPGs not being designed for solo playing. It was for this reason that the loaning of player characters as NPC party members was incorporated. During later development, and following the game's release, the main focus was on balancing the various elements, items and weapons so as to create a <b>level</b> <b>playing</b> field, in addition to keeping the in-game economy balanced. Several features featured in earlier entries, such as the Casino and Coliseum, needed to be kept back for a later time.|$|E
