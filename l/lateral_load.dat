2500|$|Khan pioneered {{several other}} {{variations}} of the tube structure design. One of these was the concept of X-bracing, or the [...] "trussed tube", first employed for the John Hancock Center. This concept reduced the <b>lateral</b> <b>load</b> on the building by transferring the load into the exterior columns. This allows for a reduced need for interior columns thus creating more floor space. This concept {{can be seen in}} the John Hancock Center, designed in 1965 and completed in 1969. One of the most famous buildings of the structural expressionist style, the skyscraper's distinctive X-bracing exterior is actually a hint that the structure's skin is indeed part of its 'tubular system'. This idea is one of the architectural techniques the building used to climb to record heights (the tubular system is essentially the spine that helps the building stand upright during wind and earthquake loads). This X-bracing allows for both higher performance from tall structures and the ability to open up the inside floorplan (and usable floor space) if the architect desires.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with analysis for the strengthening effect of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) on steel columns under cyclic <b>lateral</b> <b>loading</b> in thermal environment. Based on the finite element theory of thermo-elastic problem and steel structure stability theory, the hysteretic behavior of axial compression steel columns was studied by using Ansys software. The main variables investigated are:  cyclic <b>lateral</b> <b>loading,</b> temperature, axial compression ratio and ductility. The {{results show that the}} CFRP wraps can improve the ultimate cyclic <b>lateral</b> <b>loading</b> and ductility of steel columns prominently in thermal environment which benefit to the anti-seismic capacity of steel structure. The effect of axial compression ratio on ultimate cyclic <b>lateral</b> <b>loading</b> is very obvious, more enhancements achieved with the axial compression ratio increased. While effect of temperature on ultimate cyclic <b>lateral</b> <b>loading</b> is not very obvious below 300 ℃. </p...|$|R
50|$|In {{structural}} engineering, {{a diaphragm}} is a structural element that transmits <b>lateral</b> <b>loads</b> to the vertical resisting {{elements of a}} structure (such as shear walls or frames). Diaphragms are typically horizontal, but can be sloped such as in a gable roof on a wood structure or concrete ramp in a parking garage. The diaphragm forces tend {{to be transferred to}} the vertical resisting elements primarily through in-plane shear stress. The most common <b>lateral</b> <b>loads</b> to be resisted are those resulting from wind and earthquake actions, but other <b>lateral</b> <b>loads</b> such as <b>lateral</b> earth pressure or hydrostatic pressure can also be resisted by diaphragm action.|$|R

40|$|Concrete-filled steel tubular (CFT) columns {{are widely}} used as columns in many {{structural}} systems and a common failure mode of such tubular columns is inelastic outward local buckling near a column end. The use of fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) jackets/wraps for the suppression of such local buckling has recently been proposed and has been proven to possess excellent potential in both retrofit/strengthening and new construction. This paper {{presents the results of}} an experimental study into the behaviour of large-scale FRP-confined CFT (CCFT) columns under combined axial compression and <b>lateral</b> <b>loading.</b> The test parameters included the stiffness of the FRP jacket and the loading scenario. The test results showed that the FRP jacket can effectively delay or even prevent outward local buckling {{at the end of a}} cantilevered CFT column, leading to significantly improved structural performance under combined constant axial compression and cyclic <b>lateral</b> <b>loading.</b> Compared to monotonic <b>lateral</b> <b>loading,</b> cyclic <b>lateral</b> <b>loading</b> was found to introduce more severe localized deformation near the column end and may lead to earlier FRP rupture within that region.

40|$|In the {{previous}} paper, authors proposed the unified equivalent frame method (UEFM) for the lateral behavior {{analysis of the}} flat plate structure subjected to the combined gravity and <b>lateral</b> <b>loads,</b> in which the rotations of torsional members were distributed to the equivalent column and the equivalent slab according to the relative ratio of gravity and <b>lateral</b> <b>loads.</b> In this paper, the lateral behavior of the multi-span flat plate structures under various levels of combined gravity and <b>lateral</b> <b>loads</b> were analyzed by the proposed UEFM, which were compared with test results {{as well as those}} estimated by existing models. In addition, to consider the stiffness degradation of the flat plate system after cracking, the stiffness reduction factors for torsional members were derived from the test results of the interior and exterior slab-column connection specimens, based on which the simplified nonlinear push-over analysis method for flat plate structures was proposed. The simplified nonlinear analysis method provided good agreements with test results and is considered to be very useful for the practical design of the flat plate structures under the combined gravity and <b>lateral</b> <b>loads.</b> ope...|$|R

50|$|Mercedes-Benz S-Class Active Body Control {{system uses}} another approach: the {{computer}} uses sensors to detect <b>lateral</b> <b>load,</b> lateral force, and height {{difference in the}} suspension strut, then uses hydraulic pressure to raise or lower the spring to counter roll.

In this study, firstly, field <b>lateral</b> <b>loading</b> tests on a rigid pile and a number of finite element analyses are comparably investigated. Then, a detailed evaluation of current P-y models is performed and discussed. Finally, a refined design guideline is presented for laterally loaded piles with a wider range of dimensions...|$|R
50|$|Anti-roll bars provide {{two main}} {{function}}s. The first function is {{the reduction of}} body lean. The reduction of body lean {{is dependent on the}} total roll stiffness of the vehicle. Increasing the total roll stiffness of a vehicle does not change the steady state total load (weight) transfer from the inside wheels to the outside wheels, it only reduces body lean. The total <b>lateral</b> <b>load</b> transfer is determined by the CG height and track width.|$|E
50|$|Some {{characteristics}} of LECA are: lightness, thermal insulation by low conductivity coefficient (as low as 0.097 W/mK), soundproofing by high acoustic resistance, moisture impermeable, incompressible under permanent pressure and gravity loads, non-decomposition against severe condition, fire resistant, Ph of nearly 7, freezing and melting resistance, easy movement and transportation, lightweight backfill and finishing, reduction of construction dead load and earthquake <b>lateral</b> <b>load,</b> perfect sweet soil for plants, material for drainage and filtration.|$|E
50|$|Lowering the CoM {{towards the}} ground is one method of {{reducing}} load transfer. As a result load transfer is reduced in both the longitudinal and lateral directions. Another method of reducing load transfer is by increasing the wheel spacings.

In addition to capacity and behaviour of post tension system by bolts for the column to beam connection under cyclic <b>lateral</b> <b>loads.</b> A six cycle of a push over tests was carry {{out on a}} scaled model of 1 : 5 two-story one-bay specimen frame, four post-tensioned (PT) precast columns and two precast concrete beams components are fabricated.
