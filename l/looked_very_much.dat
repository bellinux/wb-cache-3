5|$|In 1831, the Indiana General Assembly {{approved}} {{construction of}} a new statehouse. The building was to be funded by the sale of lots of land in Indianapolis. A commission was established and Commissioner James Blake offered a $150 prize to the architect who could design the best statehouse. The firm of Ithiel Town and Alexander Jackson Davis created the winning design. Their plans were for a structure that was inspired by the ancient Greek Parthenon. The building <b>looked</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> like the Parthenon except for a large central dome. Town and Davis was awarded the contract to construct the building, and completed it ahead of schedule in 1835.|$|E

25|$|United {{failed to}} build on the {{momentum}} of the Kansas City win, suffering a crushing 0-2 home loss to Seattle, on late goals by rookie Jordan Morris and Joevin Jones. The entire MLS went on break for the Copa América Centenario. Birnbaum and Saborio were called up to their respective national team squads for the USA and Costa Rica. During the league break, the team made an unusual move, adding 16-year old youth national team captain Chris Durkin as a Homegrown Player signing. Durkin was one of the youngest signings in league history, but the unusual deal did not add Durkin to D.C. United's MLS roster. Instead, he was available to play in a U.S. Open Cup match the next day, and would go out on loan after the match, first to Richmond Kickers, and then to resume his residency with the national team program in Bradenton as least until the USA U-17s finished their run at the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup. Durkin did make his debut in the USOC match and by all accounts <b>looked</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> as if he belonged. However, the team was unable to break through against the Ft. Lauderdale Strikers defense, and the D.C. squad made a quick exit from the competition, after losing to the Strikers in a penalty kick shootout. When MLS league action resumed, United claimed 4 points in their final 2 matches of the month, including a dreary 0-0 draw in Houston that produced no excitement until stoppage time, when Bill Hamid was forced into two spectacular reaction saves. D.C. United turned in a stronger performance with some home cooking against the New England Revolution, as Neagle and Franklin turned in highlight reel goals, and the home team cruised to a 2-0 win.|$|E

500|$|Developments in Russia posed {{another set}} of issues for the monarchy. Tsar NicholasII of Russia was King George's first cousin and the two monarchs <b>looked</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> alike. When Nicholas was overthrown in the Russian Revolution of 1917, the liberal Russian Government asked that the tsar and his family be given asylum in Britain. [...] The cabinet agreed but the king was worried that public opinion was hostile and said no. [...] It is likely the tsar would have refused to leave Russia in any case.

2500|$|The third aircraft, {{designated}} 707A, WD280 {{was built}} for higher speed testing. [...] Experience with the dorsal intake of the earlier 707 and 707B had shown that as speed increased, the cockpit induced turbulence which interrupted the intake airflow, so the intakes were moved to the wing roots. When the Vulcan appeared, it <b>looked</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> like an enlarged 707A. Later, this 707A {{was used to test}} the compound leading edge sweep subsequently used on all Vulcans. Although the first Vulcan prototype was already flying, a second 707A WZ736 was built to speed the development programme, making its maiden fight on 20 February 1953.|$|E

However he did indeed patent the design for the [...] "Discopter" [...] in January 1944 with the U.S. Patent Office and it served as the prototype for other similar aircraft that have been developed up to the present day.|$|E

Jenkins Sr., called Daddy Ni by the family, was a coal miner, while his mother worked as a barmaid at a pub called the Miner's Arms, which was also {{the place where she}} met and married her husband.

2500|$|From 1953 onwards, {{the first}} three {{prototype}} aircraft were hand-built at Samlesbury. These aircraft had been assigned the aircraft serials WG760, WG763, and WG765 (the static airframe). The prototypes were powered by un-reheated Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire turbojets, as the selected Rolls-Royce Avon engines which would power subsequent production aircraft had fallen behind schedule due to their own development problems. Due to the limited internal space of the fuselage the fuel capacity was relatively small, giving the prototypes an extremely limited endurance, and the narrow tyres housed in the thin wings would rapidly wear out. Outwardly, the prototypes <b>looked</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> like the production series, but they were distinguished by the rounded-triangular intakes, short fins and lack of operational equipment.On 9 June 1952, it had been decided {{that there would be}} a second phase of prototypes built to develop the aircraft towards achieving these were designated P.1B while the initial three prototypes were retroactively reclassified as P.1A.|$|E
2500|$|In 1962, Chrysler-Fevre Argentina S.A. started {{building}} the 1960 {{version of the}} US Plymouth Valiant under the Chrysler nameplate (although later most of the cars were sold under the [...] "Valiant" [...] nameplate as an independent brand).

2500|$|Tolstoy was {{a master}} of prose; both his novella The Vampire (praised by Vissarion Belinsky) and his novel Prince Serebrenni {{received}} a lot of good press. The latter, though, was criticised for being tendentious; many argued that both the main character and Yelena Morozova <b>looked</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> like people of the 19th, rather than 16th century. On the other hand, Ivan Grozny and the oprichnina horrors were depicted with great vividness and passion; the novel's masterfully built structure, its rich musical language made it a perfect Walter Scott-type of book for adolescents, according to Vengerov. [...] "The novel is highly involving… finely structured and well-written," [...] Ivan Turgenev wrote, recommending it to a French publisher. Still, as a prosaic Tolstoy made much less of an impact than as a poet. He’s been lauded as a classic of the 19th century Russian historical drama. D. S. Mirsky regarded Tolstoy as a dramatist superior to Aleksander Ostrovsky, describing his plays as [...] "full of intriguing ideas and brilliantly crafted characters. They impress us with intelligence and insight rather than [...] with flights of imagination, but in Tsar Fyodor Tolstoy managed to create {{one of the most interesting}} characters in Russian literature: that of a kind and weak ruler who has a keen sense of justice but is unable to make his evil aids implement his good will." ...|$|E

2500|$|Prior to the {{publication}} of Home of the Gentry, Goncharov took {{an opportunity to get}} acquainted with the original text at recitals held by Turgenev for a circle of friends. He pointed to its author that many ideas, fragments of a plotline and situations <b>looked</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> like they've been copied from The Precipice, the novel which was yet unpublished but very familiar to Turgenev in every detail. On March 27, 1860, Goncharov reminded Turgenev in a letter: [...] "Remember, there was the time when you agreed that the general plan of your novel and characters' interactions had been similar you even excluded one scene, too obviously similar to mine, which made me feel totally satisfied." [...] In another letter, dated March 28, Goncharov specified the scene similar to that which involved Vera and grandmother (in The Precipice), which, being [...] "a weak one", had been [...] "magnanimously sacrificed" [...] by Turgenev. The scene mentioned was absent from the final version of Home of the Gentry, but references to it have been found in rough copies of the novel; this [...] corroborated Goncharov's claim that Turgenev indeed had been making some cuts so as to make parallels less obvious. According to N. Budanova, [...] "it is important to bear in mind that parallels between the two novels were for all to see and Turgenev at one point conceded as much, blaming his 'over-impressionability' for this." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Old South's church {{opened in}} 1875 it <b>looked</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> {{as it does}} today, based upon the design of Cummings and Sears. The walls were {{decorated}} in polychrome stenciling in shades of complex tertiary colors: a rose madder background with overlays of ochre, bay leaf green, warm gray, and persimmon, and highlights of metallic gold. Most of the interior structure, except for the carved wood frieze along the balconies, was already in place by 1875. High above the crossing of the transepts and nave is the lantern, or cupola. The ceiling of the lantern was painted a deep Prussian blue with a pattern of gilded stars to represent the firmament of God. The limestone tracery of the west wall of the sanctuary, with its foliage and animals, combined with the highly carved foliated woodwork and the overhead representation of the nighttime sky was intended to echo God's creation. Above the doors on the east chancel walls are glass mosaics of {{the tree of life}} by Antonio Salviati. A third mosaic by Salviati originally hung in the tympanum above the tower's front doors. That mosaic was relocated to the vestibule when the tower was rebuilt 1922-1937. The combined effect was extremely rich; at once a spiritual and sensuous experience, and in great contrast to the chaste interior of Old South Meeting House on Washington Street. Stylistically the 1875 interior was in harmony with the Ruskinian Gothic exterior, and expressed Ruskin's ideal that it is “in art that the heart, the head, and the hand of a man come together.” ...|$|E
