5|$|Native mascots {{are also}} part of the <b>larger</b> <b>issues</b> of {{cultural}} appropriation and the violation of indigenous intellectual property rights, which includes all instances where non-natives use indigenous music, art, costumes, etc. in entertainment and commerce. It has been argued that harm to Native Americans occurs because the appropriation of Native culture by the majority society continues the systems of dominance and subordination that have been used to colonize, assimilate, and oppress indigenous groups. Some see the use of caricatures of Native Americans as sports mascots as contributing to their political and economic marginalization. Where other minorities would be consulted, decisions impacting Native Americans, such as building the Dakota Access Pipeline, are made while excluding Native concerns.|$|E
5|$|The Schiavo case {{involved}} 14 appeals and numerous motions, petitions, and hearings in the Florida courts; five suits in federal district court; extensive political intervention at {{the levels of}} the Florida state legislature, Governor Jeb Bush, the U.S. Congress, and President George W. Bush; and four denials of certiorari from the Supreme Court of the United States. The case also spurred highly visible activism from the pro-life movement, the right-to-die movement, and disability rights groups. Since Schiavo's death, both {{her husband and her}} family have written books on their sides of the case, and both have also been involved in activism over its <b>larger</b> <b>issues.</b>|$|E

40|$|This study investigates underpricing of IPOs in Sri Lanka. On average, IPOs are underpriced by 34 %. Small {{issues are}} more underpriced than <b>large</b> <b>issues,</b> and {{privatization}} issues are more underpriced than conventional issues. Investor sentiment is positively related with underpricing and affects small and <b>large</b> <b>issues</b> similarly. Small privatization issues are more underpriced than <b>large</b> privatization <b>issues</b> and partially explain the asymmetry in underpricing between small and <b>large</b> <b>issues.</b> However, even {{after controlling for}} investor sentiment, privatization, hot-market conditions, underwriter-size, and industry, small issues remain more underpriced than <b>large</b> <b>issues.</b> The results strongly support the uncertainty hypothesis for larger underpricing of small issues, and privatization issues.

In 2007, the controversy resulted in a book by science journalist Vanna Beckman, with a focus on the <b>larger</b> <b>issues</b> of biologism and sociologism as they played out in the debate, a book which also described the ideological battle against research in psychology and psychiatry driven by various religious groups.

25|$|Service councils {{were created}} as {{governance}} councils in 2001, {{in response to}} complaints {{about the effectiveness of}} Metro service in suburban areas. Communications between sectors and riders was poor, {{according to a report by}} the California State Auditor which was released one year into the new structure. In addition, each sector had its own scheduling, operations, and maintenance divisions, causing effort duplication, organizational silos, and inefficiency. Thus, in 2009, the sectors were eliminated, and transportation, maintenance, service planning, and administration were recentralized under the guidance of Metro's Chief Operations Officer. Governance councils, renamed service councils, now have more responsibility over local issues such as stop placement and service changes, while <b>larger</b> <b>issues</b> are handled by the Metro board.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, Dick Wolf {{developed}} a concept {{for a new}} television series that would depict a relatively optimistic picture of the American criminal justice system. He initially {{toyed with the idea}} of calling it Night & Day but then hit upon the title Law & Order. The first half of each episode would follow two detectives (a senior and a junior detective) and their commanding officer as they investigate a violent crime. The second half of the episode would follow the District Attorney's Office and the courts as two prosecutors, with advice from the District Attorney himself, attempt to convict the accused. Through this, Law & Order would be able to investigate some of the <b>larger</b> <b>issues</b> of the day by focusing on stories that were based on real cases making headlines.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other {{conflicts}} to {{have occurred}} in French colonies, the Kongo-Wara rebellion was relegated to relative obscurity amongst the public in France and few politicians and commentators remarked of it. What little news of the rebellion that was made known in Europe helped bring attention to the conditions faced by Central African workers. This led to criticism of French rule in Africa from communists and other groups, leading to French suspicions of the rebellion itself being instigated by communists. Though not achieving independence from the French colonial administration, the Kongo-Wara rebellion achieved an improvement in the conditions which initially sparked resistance, as the administration reduced the worse forms of oppression in a self-interested reaction to negative press the rebellion had caused. The rebellion also exposed several <b>larger</b> <b>issues</b> endemic to the French colonial system; the effect of unchecked, unrestricted capitalism upon native populations, {{and the fact that}} stability was dependent on a fragile, rural elite. Calls for fundamental reform in the wake of these revelations were silenced once order had been restored.|$|E

500|$|Advocacy {{efforts are}} not only limited to science funding, but <b>larger</b> <b>issues</b> of public policy as well. Over the years, the LSA {{membership}} have passed a number of resolutions regarding issues of public policy. In 1987, the LSA officially took a stand against the English-only movement in the United States stating that [...] "English-only measures ... are based on misconceptions {{about the role of}} a common language in establishing political unity, and ... are inconsistent with basic American traditions of linguistic tolerance." [...] Furthering that stance, the membership ratified a statement on linguistic rights in 1996 declaring [...] "the government and people of the United States have a special obligation to enable indigenous peoples to retain their languages and cultures" [...] and declared 7 fundamental linguistic rights including the right [...] "to have their children educated in a manner that affirmatively acknowledges their native language abilities..." [...] which includes the possibility of education in a language other than English. 5 years later, the LSA lent its support for the recognition of sign languages as equal to that of other languages. The resolution, passed in 2001, [...] "affirm that sign languages used by deaf communities are full-fledged languages with all the structural characteristics and range of expression of spoken languages" [...] and urged that sign languages be given the same respect as other languages in academic and political life.|$|E
500|$|There were complaints, however, {{that the}} {{documentary}} did not depict {{enough of the}} political aspects of the Iraqi War. Farhi said, [...] "The 90-minute documentary doesn't say much about the <b>larger</b> <b>issues</b> facing Iraq, but it does capture some small and captivating human stories.... They happen to live in what one boy describes as 'the most dangerous city on Earth.' You don't see much of Iraq's violence in Baghdad High, but you surely feel its gravity and their dread." [...] The Boston Heralds Mark Perigard said that he felt the documentary was [...] "a personal story, not a political one". In The New York Times, Mike Hale commented, [...] "While the boys talk frequently about violence and despair, they rarely discuss politics or ethnic differences (with the exception of Anmar, the Christian) and they almost never directly address the American presence. We do hear some parental opinions, which are surprisingly neutral. One mother says: 'We shouldn't blame the Americans for everything. There {{is something wrong with}} us too'." [...] Jennifer Marin, a culture columnist from the Los Angeles Times, wrote at About.com, that while it was innovative, informative and a noble experiment, the footage is [...] "undistinguished and rough because the hands holding the cameras weren't skilled and the eyes framing the shots were not those of artists or keen observers." [...] She thought that, with the exception of Mohammad, the boys lacked charisma, and that the film failed to capture the drama of living in a war-zone, {{due to the lack of}} a director calling the shots. Perigard said, [...] "After the time you've invested , it's not nearly satisfying enough. For all the questions this fascinating film raises, it might as well be written in sand." ...|$|E
500|$|Though Hemmings did {{not think}} of his work as a biography, Richard L. Hopkins (Comparative Education Review) said it {{essentially}} was strongest as one. Hopkins wrote in 1976 that Hemmings's book was the best biography of Neill available at the time, and called it [...] "comprehensive", [...] "objective", and [...] "sympathetically thoughtful". In comparison, Neill's autobiography [...] "rambles" [...] and Skidelsky's biography [...] "preens" [...] over [...] "small insights", while Hemmings unpacks <b>larger</b> <b>issues</b> to contextualize [...] "a complex man in a complex world". Reflecting on these three biographies of Neill, Hopkins added that Hemmings's book would interest [...] "comparative educators" [...] most, as that it addressed the two points readers would find most interesting about Neill: the role of his history on his ideas, and the role of his ideas in the outside world. Still, Hopkins thought many readers would find the work [...] "too long and detailed". Hopkins himself found Hemmings's book [...] "a struggle to work through", though more complete compared to Neill's [...] "easy", [...] "stream-of-consciousness" [...] prose. Leonard W. Cowie (British Journal of Educational Studies) said that Fifty Years was written with [...] "great competence" [...] and would be both [...] "interesting and essential" [...] for those interested in understanding Neill. [...] recommended the [...] "excellent volume" [...] for [...] "all readership levels", and considered it more telling than Neill's own autobiography. Shelley Neiderbach (Library Journal) agreed that Hemmings's [...] "admiring ... historical biography" [...] remained [...] "clear, cool, and evenhanded". [...] Sarah Curtis (The Times Literary Supplement) wrote in 1972 that Hemmings's account of Neill was [...] "the most lucid, dispassionate yet sympathetic" [...] published. No system, she wrote, has reconciled the needs for individual freedom and societal regulation.|$|E

2500|$|I {{found some}} aspects of this chapter to be interesting, challenging, and logical.

2500|$|Another {{commentator}} {{took it upon}} {{herself to}} address the issues the Court left unresolved, even before it had heard oral arguments.

She agreed with Ikuta's criticism of the panel decision, but argued that the panel should have devoted more attention to the <b>larger</b> <b>issues</b> of Quon's expectation of privacy.

2500|$|A rift {{develops}} and widens between Dan and Laura as they firmly {{disagree on}} the question of an implant. Dan's hearing parents favor the surgery because it would help them communicate better with their grandson, as they never learned much sign language, living far away. Laura's deaf parents are strongly opposed, especially her father, a fierce advocate of Deaf Pride and an author on the subject. Soon, the <b>larger</b> <b>issues</b> of Deaf Pride and the overall ethics of cochlear implants become the focus of the argument, as implants are viewed to have a potentially detrimental effect on Deaf culture. Laura's father, Max, says, [...] "The majority always thinks each minority wants to be like them", as he doesn't consider deafness to be a disability. Dan, who feels his father-in-law never accepted him, sees this attitude as deaf prejudice against him and all hearing people, when all Dan wants is to give his son a fuller life and a better future.|$|E
2500|$|The Charlotte Three {{case was}} {{an event that}} epitomized the <b>larger</b> <b>issues</b> of politics, race, {{and the civil rights}} {{movement}} in the South. The commuting of the sentences for the men may not have actually been purely due to the reasons publicly stated, but instead for hidden political ones. In 1979, an election year, {{there was a lot of}} turmoil and Governor Hunt and the Democratic party were worried about the backlash that would ensue if the men were still imprisoned at the time of the election. Herbert N. Lape who was serving as the vice-chairman of the North Carolina state democratic party stated in a letter to Hunt that many people in the state view [...] "the Charlotte Three [...] as [...] primarily white witch [...] that involved racial bigotry".

40|$|To {{investigate}} the liquidity of <b>large</b> <b>issues,</b> this study tests for yield differences between corporate bonds and medium-term notes.
