50|$|The plot of {{this series}} focuses on Cybertronian Autobot Fortress Maximus, who despite his success as a {{military}} commander, longs to find peace by leaving Cybertron's civil war altogether. To that end, he gathers a large crew of followers, and they rocket off to the planet Nebulos, which has not seen war in over 10,000 years. Unfortunately, the Autobots' first encounters with the Nebulans are misinterpreted. Intimidated by the robots' size, the Nebulans initiate aggressions against the Autobots. To end hostilities and show his willingness to protect the planet's fragile peace, Fortress Maximus {{and a few of}} his followers discard their weapons in front of the Nebulan capital. When that failed to dissuade them, he made the ultimate sacrifice by offering them his head. Four more Autobots did the same, while the remained returned to their camp unarmed.Intending to use the situation to his advantage, corrupt Nebulan politician Lord Zarak learned more about the Autobots and the war they left behind and used this information to contact Cybertron. Zarak's message was received by Fortress Maximus's Decepticon equal, Scorponok. After lying to Zarak about the intentions of the Autobots, Scorponok led an invasion force to the planet. Armed only with weapons that had not seen use in millennia, the Nebulan defense were no match for the intentionally aggressive Decepticons. With <b>little</b> <b>options</b> left, Galen, leader of the Nebulan world council, made arrangements for himself and others to become Autobot Headmasters. Although the Headmaster process made them able to drive off the Decepticons, all Galen had succeeded in doing was re-igniting the Transformers' war on Nebulous. After Scorponok and now-captive Lord Zarak developed a way to duplicate the process (as well as a later Targetmaster Process), the Nebulos theatre of the Transformers' war escalated. After casualties and collateral damage mounted, Galen eventually convinced Zarak to take their conflict off-world, with nearly all Transformers from both factions following a distress beacon sent by Goldbug from Earth.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this project {{was to develop a}} hybrid version of a work place safety course for use at Ivy Tech Community College.

With the creation of a hybrid course, students who take this class are required to drive to campus less each week, resulting in additional savings to the students. A hybrid course also gives the students another option to the traditional delivery model, resulting in increased learning potential for those students looking for an alternative to in-class instruction. For this project the current course material was evaluated to determine which material would be appropriate for hybrid delivery using BlackBoard as the classroom management software. Once the content was determined, the material was modified to run on BlackBoard and the course shell was developed. Lastly, the course outline and syllabus was created for the new hybrid course. The result of this project helped determine the effectiveness and future need for additional hybrid course offerings in the Industrial Technology program at Ivy Tech...|$|E

To allow developers to get familiar with the CSE, we have also designed a C++ servlet API and a syntax for C++ Server Pages that closely resembles that used by Java servlet environments. To illustrate the use of the CSE, we have also implemented the Record Store, a sample web application. On the basis of this example, we describe how servlets can be developed using our environment. To demonstrate the benefits that can be gained by using the CSE, we evaluate its performance and compare it to that of other popular servlet environments...|$|E

Natural resources-wise, Hong Kong has too little to offer, as almost all its agricultural lands have been converted into building land, leaving no alternative but to import drinking water and daily supplies from across the Hong Kong-Mainland border on a daily basis. Insatiable demands for housing due to an ever-increasing population growth left the government with <b>little</b> <b>options</b> but to embark on an unprecedented urban form of hyper-density. In 1997, the Hong Kong government commissioned a study known as Sustainable Development for the 21 st Century in Hong Kong (SUSDEV 21). The Study jump-started the city's participation in a worldwide endeavor to embrace sustainable development. The three years expedition guided the city through a world tour and studies on sustainable development from an international frontier, regional frontier, to a local frontier, and ended with a definition of sustainable development for Hong Kong, as well as a policy-making mechanism to achieve sustainability. Institutional efforts to promote sustainability has been complimented by efforts from professionals in the construction and building sector in an equally thorough and holistic manner, which include law-enforcers, developers, architects and builders.

40|$|High-rise {{and high}} density living {{is a way}} of life for most of the 6. 7 Million {{population}} of Hong Kong. The merits and demerits affiliated with Hong Kongis compact urban form continues to attract academic deliberations and debates over the acceptability of such urban form as an alternative to urban sprawl for future city and urban life-style. This paper traces the development and causes for Hong Kongis high-rise and high-density urban form over the past fifty years or so, and focuses its discussions on the pros and cons of high-rise living based on subjective user survey in late 2001 and early 2002. Because of an articulated land shortage, acute topography, escalating population growth, and shortage of time, Hong Kong government and planners have <b>little</b> <b>options</b> left but to adopt vertical development, resulted in a densely and mixed use urban habitat packed with closely built high-rise residences and commercial buildings. From the survey, it is clear that mixed and intensive land use, high quality of living and recreation infrastructure, efficient public transportation network, and segregation of pedestrian and traffic can facilitate the performance of compact urban form. In addition, most of Hong Kong families have been accustomed to high-rise living pattern and the disadvantages such living pattern might cause on its residentis social communication and children education are readily ignored by most of the people. Based on the analysis of current living situation and development trends in Hong Kong, new pattern of future city form is conceived to be a likely applicable development way in a coastal city with such high density as Hong Kong in the next 50 years. Design countermeasures are presented in this paper to suggest ways of alleviating the pressure of the forever-increasing house requirements in Hong Kong.
