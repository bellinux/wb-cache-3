40|$|The antiquity of the {{practice}} of grazing on and/or foddering with seaweed is of interest in terms of understanding animal management practices in northwest Europe, where provision had to be made for overwintering. Orkney holds a special place in this discussion, since the sheep of North Ronaldsay have been confined to the seashores since the early nineteenth century, and are entirely adapted to a diet consisting mainly of seaweeds. Here, we report the results of stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis of twenty-five faunal specimens from the Neolithic chambered tomb of Quanterness, Orkney. Three of the 12 sheep analysed show elevated δ 13 C values that can only be explained by the consumption of seaweed. Radiocarbon dates place two of the three animals in the Neolithic, coeval {{with the use of the}} monument for burial, while the third animal dates to the Chalcolithic/Early Bronze Age. The findings are placed into the wider context of previous isotopic analyses of domestic fauna from prehistoric Orkney.

Breast feeding duration and the early exposure to milk substitutes are environmental factors associated to etiology of type 1 diabetes. Aim To study {{the frequency of the}} anti-GAD, anti-IA- 2 e ICA antibodies in Chilean type 1 diabetic patients and determine the possible modulator effect of the breast feeding. Patients and methods: One hundred thirty four type I diabetic patients, aged one to 15 years old, were studied at the moment of their diagnosis. Patients were classified according to the duration of exclusive breast feeding. IA- 2 and GAD were determined by radio immuno assay and ICA by means of indirect immunofluorescence. Results: Subjects with <b>three</b> <b>months</b> or less and those with more <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> of breast feeding were positive for ICA in 78. 8 and 90. 6 % of cases respectively, for GAD in 75 and 54. 6 % of cases respectively (p= 0. 024) and for IA- 2 in 73 and 43. 8 % of cases respectively (p= 0. 001).

40|$|Restricted until 30 Apr. 2010. Despite {{progressive}} {{documentation of}} the effectiveness of community-based psychosocial rehabilitation programs, relatively little progress has been made during the past twenty years in delineating the treatment process variables related to successful psychosocial outcomes for persons with schizophrenia. Studies and narratives demonstrate that a strong working alliance is a prerequisite to treatment regardless of the type of therapy being provided. Moreover, the hope that individuals with schizophrenia derive through the consumer-provider relationship appears essential to achieving successful outcomes. Working alliance and hope are also highlighted as important elements in the current recovery and empowerment literature. Although often discussed singularly or in pairs, to date researchers have not examined the confluence of working alliance, hope, and psychosocial functioning with respect to persons with schizophrenia who are involved in community-based psychosocial rehabilitation programs.; This study examined the relationship and causal ordering between consumer working alliance, hope, and psychosocial functioning outcomes of individuals with schizophrenia participating in community-based psychosocial rehabilitation services. The study used a mixed methods sequential explanatory design which featured the consecutive collection and analysis of quantitative data and qualitative data, with the two methods combined during the final interpretation phase. The selection of sequential explanatory design for the study arose from the use of the qualitative results to enhance the exploration, explanation, and interpretation of the mainly quantitative investigation.; The study had five aims: 1) Investigate the empirical relationship between consumer working alliance, consumer hope, and consumer psychosocial functioning; 2) Evaluate if consumer hope mediates the relationship between consumer working alliance and psychosocial functioning; 3) Examine if the abovementioned mediation relationship is moderated by the study participants' length of attendance (<b>less</b> / more <b>than</b> <b>three</b> months); 4) Gain insight into issues and contexts related to consumers' working alliance, hope, and psychosocial functioning through qualitative semi-structured interviews; and 5) Explore and explain the quantitative results with the qualitative results to better understand the relationship and causal ordering between consumer working alliance, consumer hope, and consumer psychosocial functioning.; 100 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia stratified by their length of attendance (<b>less</b> / more <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>months)</b> were randomly selected from a community-based psychosocial rehabilitation program. The ten participants for the qualitative study were purposefully sampled from the parent sample on the basis of race, gender, and ability to articulate their experiences.; Findings revealed a statistically significant association between working alliance and hope as well as among hope and psychosocial functioning. The second critical finding from this study was the statistically significant one-tailed mediation results that indicated a trend for hope to be the mechanism through which working alliance affects psychosocial functioning. This trend was substantiated in the qualitative phase as participants emphasized that the relationship between consumer working alliance and psychosocial functioning was driven by hope, which was influenced by spiritual and religious beliefs, encouragement from others, improvement of self-concept, and successful attainment of goals. The hypothesis that the mediation relationship from consumer working alliance to hope to psychosocial functioning may be moderated by length of attendance (<b>less</b> / more <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>months)</b> was not demonstrated.

Materials and Methods: The files of patients treated with 100 U of onabotulinumtoxinA injected at 20 sites with sparing of the trigone were retrospectively analysed. Nearly all patients completed voiding-incontinence diaries and the King’s Health Questionnaire (KHQ) pre- and post-operatively. Cystometric and pressure-flow studies were done in the majority of patients. Success was defined as the patient’s and clinician’s joint choice for re-treatment with the same dose of onabotulinumtoxinA after a period of at least six months of clinical satisfaction. Results: Twenty-six women were treated. On average, the improvement in most voiding diary parameters and in most KHQ categories lasted <b>less</b> <b>than</b> six and <b>three</b> <b>months,</b> respectively. Eight patients (31 %) were scheduled for re-treatment with 100 U again after at least six months. No prognostic cystometric parameters were found. Six patients (23 %) needed CISC. None of the bladder contraction strength parameters derived from the the pressure-flow studies appeared predictive of the need of CISC. Conclusions: We obtained a success rate of 31 % after six months with 100 U of onabotulinumtoxinA, while 23 % of the patients applied CISC. We consider this success rate low and find the balance between the success rate and the rate of patients needing CISC inadequate...|$|R
