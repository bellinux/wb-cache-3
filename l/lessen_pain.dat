40|$|Ostracism causes social {{pain and}} is known to {{activate}} regions {{of the brain that}} are involved in the representation of physical pain. Previous research has observed that acetominophen (a common pain reliever) can reduce the pain of exclusion. The taste and consumption of glucose can also relieve physical pain, and the purpose of the cur- rent study was to examine whether it might also reduce the negative emotional effects of ostracism. In an appro- priately powered experiment, participants were given 25 g of glucose or a sucralose placebo before being ostracized while playing Cyberball. Strong effects of ostracism were observed, however, there was no effect of glucose on immediate or delayed self-reported needs or mood.

40|$|Background: Pain is {{processed}} and experienced differently {{on the left}} (L) and right (R) sides of the body; however, L/R pain asymmetry with cosmetic treatments of the face has not been evaluated. Objectives: The authors compared patient ratings of L/R facial pain during and immediately after injectable cosmetic treatments. Methods: In this cross-sectional multicenter pragmatic study, pain levels were evaluated for 302 patients who underwent facial treatments with botulinum toxin (BTX) and/or impermanent soft-tissue filler (STF). Patients indicated pain intensity {{on each side of}} the face with a visual analogue scale (VAS; 0, no pain; 10, worst pain). Results: Combined mean VAS scores for BTX and STF treatments (L, 3. 79 vs R, 3. 42), and individual scores for BTX (L, 3. 60 vs R, 3. 30) or STF (L, 4. 22 vs R, 3. 69) treatments were significantly different, with pain rated as worse on the L side of the face (all P < 0. 01). When treatments were performed first on the L side, patients rated the overall experience as significantly less painful than when treatments were begun on the R side. BTX treatments with a 29 -gauge (G) needle were significantly more painful than with a 33 -G needle. Conclusions: To <b>lessen</b> <b>pain</b> with injectable facial treatments, the authors recommend placing the first injection on the L side of the face and, when possible, employing a high-G needl...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{discusses}} specific {{techniques for}} reha-bilitation of chronic {{low back pain}} through aggressive physical therapy with behavioral support. The rationale for approaching the outcome dimensions of impairments in back function and pain-related disability as opposed to chronic pain symptoms is explained. This approach requires that impairments in back function are systematically identified through the quantifica-tion of trunk flexibility, straight leg raising, back extensor strength, lifting ability, and endurance. The described treatment approach focuses on eliminating those impairments through aggressive, quota-based exercise and is usually completed within 8 weeks. It requires only a modest amount of space and equipment. Useful behavioral techniques for extinguishing <b>pain</b> behaviors, <b>lessening</b> <b>pain</b> beliefs, and for promoting well-ness are described. Results from a treatment program using these techniques demonstrate normal back function and reduced disability {{for a majority of}} treated persons. Applying such a program to the VA population is an important challenge. Key words: disability, low back pain, pain-rehabilitation, rehabilitation.

40|$|Chitosan-Hyaluronate hybrid gel (CHHG) is a self-forming thermo-responsive hydrogel. The {{current study}} was {{undertaken}} {{in order to assess}} the effect of CHHG on rat's surgically induced osteoarthritis. Methods. Thirteen rats were included in the study. In all rats weight-bearing was assessed using a Linton Incapacitance tester. All rats underwent bilateral medial partial meniscectomy. Four rats received a saline injection in the control knee and a 200 -microliter injection of CHHG in the experimental knee. Five rats received a high-molecular weight hyaluronate injection to the control knee and a 200 -microliter injection of CHHG in the experimental knee. Four rats underwent the same surgical procedure, allowed to recuperate for seven days and then CHHG and hyaluronate were injected. The animals were followed for 6 weeks. Two weeks after injection of a therapeutic substance the amount of weight-bearing on each knee was evaluated using a Linton Incapacitance meter. Results. Two weeks after induction of osteoarthritis there is less pain in the CHHG-treated knee than in the control-treated knee, as determined using a Lintron Incapacitance meter. After six-weeks the histological appearance of the CHHG-treated knee was superior to that of the controls. This is indicated by thicker cartilage remaining on the medial femoral condyle as well as less cyst formation in the CHHG-treated knee. Discussion. CHHG appears to delay progression of osteoarthritis and <b>lessen</b> <b>pain</b> in a rat surgically-induced knee osteoarthritis model. These results support other published results, indicating that there is an ameliorative effect of chitosan on human and rabbit osteoarthritis...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Chronic pain {{arising from}} {{degenerative}} {{diseases of the}} joint such as osteoarthritis (OA) has a strong peripheral component {{which is likely to}} be mediator driven. Current treatments which reduce the production of such mediators i. e. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), can help to <b>lessen</b> <b>pain</b> in OA patients. However, this is not always the case and complete pain relief is rarely achieved, suggesting that additional unidentified mediators play a role. Here we have investigated the notion that chemokines might act as such pain mediators in OA. RESULTS: Using the monosodium iodoacetate (MIA) model of chronic joint pain the expression of over 90 different inflammatory mediators, mainly cytokines and chemokines, were measured in tissues taken from the femorotibial joint (cartilage, subchondral bone, fat pad) using custom-made quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) array cards. At both the day 3 and 14 time points, numerous inflammatory mediators were significantly up-regulated in these tissues, although {{it was clear that the}} largest transcriptional dysregulation occurred in the cartilage. Using individual qPCR to measure immune cell markers, a significant infiltration of macrophages was measured in the cartilage and fat pad at day 3. Neutrophil infiltration was also measured in the fat pad at the same time point, but no infiltration was observed at day 14. Combination of mRNA expression data from different time points and tissues identified the chemokines, CCL 2, 7 and 9 as being consistently up-regulated. The overall increase in CCL 2 expression was also measured at the protein level. CONCLUSION: Chemokines in general and CCL 2, 7 and 9 in particular, represent promising targets for further studies into the identification of new pain mediators in chronic joint pain...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Colonoscopy is {{generally}} {{performed with the}} patient sedated and receiving analgesics. However, {{the benefit of the}} most often used combination of intravenous midazolam and pethidine on patient tolerance and pain and its cardiorespiratory risk have not been fully defined. METHODS: In this double-blind prospective study, 150 outpatients undergoing routine colonoscopy were randomly assigned to receive either (1) low-dose midazolam (35 micrograms/kg) and pethidine (700 micrograms/kg in 48 patients, 500 micrograms/kg in 102 patients), (2) midazolam and placebo pethidine, or (3) pethidine and placebo midazolam. RESULTS: Tolerance (visual analog scale, 0 to 100 points: 0 = excellent; 100 = unbearable) did not improve significantly more in group 1 compared with group 2 (7 points; 95 % confidence interval [- 2 - 17]) and group 3 (2 points; 95 % confidence interval [- 7 - 12]). Similarly, pain was not significantly improved in group 1 as compared with the other groups. Male gender (p < 0. 001) and shorter duration of the procedure (p = 0. 004), but not amnesia, were associated with better patient tolerance and less pain. Patient satisfaction was similar in all groups. Oxygen desaturation and hypotension occurred in 33 % and 11 %, respectively, with a similar frequency in all three groups. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the combination of low-dose midazolam and pethidine does not improve patient tolerance and <b>lessen</b> <b>pain</b> during colonoscopy as compared with either drug given alone. When applying low-dose midazolam, oxygen desaturation and hypotension do not occur more often after combined use of both drugs. For the individual patient, sedation and analgesia should be based on the endoscopist's clinical judgement...|$|E
