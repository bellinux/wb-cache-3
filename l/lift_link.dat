2500|$|All {{aircraft}} in the UH-1 family have similar construction. [...] The UH-1H is the most-produced version, and is representative of all types. The main structure consists of two longitudinal main beams that run under the passenger cabin to the nose {{and back to the}} tail boom attachment point. The main beams are separated by transverse bulkheads and provide the supporting structure for the cabin, landing gear, under-floor fuel tanks, transmission, engine and tail boom. The main beams are joined at the lift beam, a short aluminum girder structure that is attached to the transmission via a <b>lift</b> <b>link</b> on the top and the cargo hook on the bottom and is located at the aircraft's center of gravity. The lift beams were changed to steel later in the UH-1H's life, due to cracking on high-time airframes. The semi-monocoque tail boom attaches to the fuselage with four bolts.|$|E

50|$|The Rotenfluebahn, a gondola <b>lift,</b> <b>links</b> Rickenbach {{with the}} summit of the Rotenfluh mountain, which is, in summer, a popular vantage point over the Lake Lucerne region, and, in winter, a ski area.|$|R
25|$|<b>Lifts</b> <b>linking</b> the {{concourse}} to the Subway platforms {{were to be}} installed {{as part of this}} project because the necessary land is not owned by SPT. The future provision of lifts has, however, been safeguarded.|$|R
50|$|Taxis are {{available}} for transport within the village. Gondola lifts and chair <b>lifts</b> <b>link</b> the village to Grotzenbüel, Kleiner Gumen, Seblengrat and Bächital, principally for winter sports activities {{but in some cases}} operating in summer as well.|$|R
50|$|The steam is fed to {{the rear}} {{cylinders}} first and from there it passes along flexible pipes to the front cylinders. All cylinders have flat slide valves and outside Heusinger valve gear with <b>lifting</b> <b>links</b> and Kuhn slides.|$|R
50|$|A {{cable car}} {{runs from the}} town of Meiringen in the valley below to Reuti. A system of Gondola lifts runs from Reuti to Planplatten, at over 2200 m elevation, via Mägisalp. Other similar <b>lifts</b> <b>link</b> Wasserwendi to Käserstatt.|$|R

50|$|Several large {{cable cars}} and <b>lifts</b> <b>link</b> {{to the summit}} regions and high skiing areas: The Bavarian Zugspitze Railway (a metre gauge rack railway from Garmisch to the Zugspitzplatt), the Eibsee Cable Car (from the Eibsee to the Zugspitzplatt), the Tyrolean Zugspitze Cable Car (from Ehrwald to the Zugspitzplatt) and the Ehrwalder Almbahn.|$|R
5000|$|The {{station has}} two platforms, with a {{footbridge}} and <b>lifts</b> <b>linking</b> them. A bus stop, 127 car parking spaces and secure cycle storage were also constructed {{along with the}} station. [...] Ticket vending machines are available and there are digital information screens and a P.A system provided for train running information provision.|$|R
50|$|Unlike the {{prototype}} locomotives, corner valve pressure compensators were {{omitted from the}} production locos and Nicolai pressure compensating tubular valves (later Karl Schultz valves) were used to give a better ride when running light. On the valve gear, the normal <b>lifting</b> <b>link</b> (Hängeeisen) replaced the Kuhn slides of {{the prototype}}s which were expensive to manufacture.|$|R
5000|$|It was pacified by the Pacifying Police Unit in 2009, and on June 30, 2010, the Rubem Braga Complex {{was inaugurated}} in it, {{composed}} of two towers, an overlook (named by {{the inhabitants of the}} region [...] "Mirante da Paz", or the [...] "Peace Overlook") and two <b>lifts</b> <b>linking</b> the favela to the General Osório Metro Station.|$|R
50|$|Bradford Interchange has {{separate}} bus {{and train}} ticket outlets. The bus and Metro office, which also deals with National Express coach enquiries from a separate desk, {{is located in}} the central concourse. The train ticket office is next to the pedestrian entrance to the train platforms and is open seven days per week (except late evenings). Escalators and <b>lifts</b> <b>link</b> the two levels and there is step-free access to all platforms.|$|R
50|$|The Kanzanji Ropeway (Kanzanji Rōpuwei) is Japanese {{aerial lift}} line in Nishi, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, {{operated}} by Entetsu Tourism Development (遠鉄観光開発). The Entetsu Group company also operates hotels, {{an amusement park}} Hamanako Palpal (浜名湖パルパル), and Hamanako Musical Box Museum (浜名湖オルゴールミュージアム), all around Kanzanji Onsen (舘山寺温泉) hot spring resort in Lake Hamana (浜名湖). Opened in 1960, the aerial <b>lift</b> <b>links</b> Kanzanji Onsen and Mount Ōkusa, across the northern cove of Lake Hamana.|$|R
2500|$|The Mason Bogie was still, though, {{plagued by}} one of the biggest {{problems}} of the Fairlie - the jointed steam pipes to the driven truck leaked far too much steam. Mason eventually changed to a different scheme, in which the pivot point for the leading truck became a hollow ball joint through which the live steam for the cylinders passed. [...] Mason also developed a sliding seal for the exhaust from the moving cylinder saddle into the smoke box. Although better, Mason's improvements took up much valuable space in between the driving wheels, forcing Mason to use an outside valve gear, generally the Walschaerts valve gear. Additionally, the reversing shaft had to be mounted atop the boiler, with a long <b>lifting</b> <b>link</b> dropping down to the radius rod, a feature unique to Mason Bogies (this was necessary because the <b>lifting</b> <b>link</b> would swing to the side as the truck pivoted, lifting the radius rod and changing the valve setting. [...] Lengthening the link, and thus increasing the radius of its swing, minimized the amount of change.).|$|R
2500|$|Bradford Interchange has {{separate}} bus {{and train}} ticket outlets. The bus and Metro office, which also deals with National Express coach enquiries from a separate desk, {{is located in}} the central concourse. The train ticket office is next to the pedestrian entrance to the train platforms and is open seven days per week (except late evenings). [...] Escalators and <b>lifts</b> <b>link</b> the two levels and there is step-free access to all platforms.|$|R
5000|$|Disabled {{access is}} via the north {{door into the}} nave transept. In the south quire aisle is a {{wheelchair}} lift over part of the [...] "Kent Steps". This gives access to the quire and presbytery level; there is a disabled WC near the foot of this. There is currently no disabled access to the crypt, but there are plans to insert a <b>lift</b> <b>linking</b> the three levels roughly where the existing wheelchair lift is.|$|R
5000|$|The station {{opened in}} 1863 as [...] "Gower Street", {{changing}} to its present name in 1909. In late 2006 the new entrance {{on the south}} side of Euston Road opened in a corner of the new headquarters of the Wellcome Trust replacing the old entrance. There is also a subway entrance on the north side of Euston Road. In 2011, two new <b>lifts</b> <b>linking</b> the westbound platform to the street were opened. On top of these a new modern entrance was opened.|$|R
50|$|Mijoux's {{economy is}} largely driven by tourism, {{for the winter}} sports practised here. Since 1999, Mijoux {{has been part of}} the Monts Jura ski resort. Ski <b>lifts</b> <b>link</b> Mijoux to the Col de la Faucille at 1308 m and to Mont Rond, at an {{altitude}} of 1543 m above sea level, one of the highest in the Jura Mountains. This part of the ski station is used mostly by downhill skiers. La Vattay, further up the valley but still within Mijoux, is a centre for cross-country skiing.|$|R
50|$|The {{aerial tramway}} {{should not be}} {{confused}} with the Montjuïc Cable Car, a gondola <b>lift</b> that <b>links</b> the upper terminus of the Montjuïc funicular with Montjuïc Castle.|$|R
5000|$|There is {{a covered}} walkway with <b>lifts</b> that <b>links</b> the station with the Friars Walk {{shopping}} centre {{as well as}} being located next to Debenhams and Supernews.|$|R
50|$|The work at Gstaad {{consisted}} of a complete rebuilding of the platforms to full height and simplification of the track layout. After almost 100 years the station got platform canopies and passenger operated <b>lifts</b> <b>linked</b> by a pedestrian underpass. During this rebuilding the station {{was reduced to a}} single line. The canopy is of wooden construction supported on metal uprights. The new layout gives the original platform as No.1 with the new island platform being Nos. 2 and 3. This work was officially opened, if not fully finished, on 13 June 2009.|$|R
