5|$|Although Waugh {{made his}} ODI debut against Pakistan in December 1988, {{he did not}} score his first century until four years later. Between his debut and the 1996 World Cup he made five centuries, all against {{different}} opponents. Waugh was more prolific at the 1996 World Cup scoring three centuries. Waugh set {{the record for the}} highest individual score by an Australian when he made 173 against West Indies at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in February 2001. The following month he scored a match-winning 133 not out against India at the Nehru Stadium, Pune which also became his <b>last</b> <b>century</b> in the format. Despite a slow start to his ODI career, he became the third highest century-maker in ODIs at the time of scoring his <b>last</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E
5|$|Increasing sea {{temperatures}} in tropical regions (~1 degree C) the <b>last</b> <b>century</b> have caused major coral bleaching, death, and therefore shrinking coral populations since {{although they are}} able to adapt and acclimate, it is uncertain if this evolutionary process will happen quickly enough to prevent major reduction of their numbers.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} wins {{required}} {{to lead the}} league each season has gone down significantly over the <b>last</b> <b>century.</b> For example, from 1900–1920, {{the average number of}} wins for the AL league leader was 30.8; from 1990–2010, it was 20.9.|$|E
5|$|Argentina is {{vulnerable}} {{and will likely}} be significantly impacted by climate change. Temperatures have increased in the <b>last</b> <b>century</b> while the observed changes in precipitation are variable, with some areas receiving more and other areas less. These changes have impacted river flow, increased the frequency of extreme weather events, {{and led to the}} retreat of glaciers. Based on the projections for both precipitation and temperatures, these climatic events are likely to increase in severity and create new problems associated with climate change in the country.|$|E

Although initial colonization of the province revolved mostly around homesteading, the <b>last</b> <b>century</b> has seen a shift towards urbanization; Manitoba is the only Canadian province with over fifty-five percent of its population located in a single city.|$|E
5|$|Erosion {{within the}} <b>last</b> <b>century</b> has {{resulted}} in a falls that is fairly narrowly channeled and vigorous, notably after a heavy rain. Photographs of the waterfall from the 19th century show a much wider, curtain like character to the falls. When the creek is dry, the older, much-broader ledge can be observed. If there were sufficient interest and funding, some remedial work could theoretically restore the 19th century appearance of the falls.|$|E
5|$|Galerina marginata is {{widespread}} in the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, North America, and Asia, and has also been found in Australia. It is a wood-rotting fungus that grows predominantly on decaying conifer wood. An extremely poisonous species, it contains the same deadly amatoxins found in the death cap (Amanita phalloides). Ingestion in toxic amounts causes severe liver damage with vomiting, diarrhea, hypothermia, and eventual death if not treated rapidly. About ten poisonings {{have been attributed to}} the species now grouped as G.marginata over the <b>last</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E

The main remaining field is Whakarewarewa at Rotorua. Two thirds of the geysers at Orakei Korako were flooded by the Ohakuri hydroelectric dam in 1961. The Wairakei field was lost to a geothermal power plant in 1958. The Taupo Spa field was lost when the Waikato River level was deliberately altered in the 1950s. The Rotomahana field was destroyed by the Mount Tarawera eruption in 1886.|$|E
5|$|Most tern {{species are}} declining in numbers {{due to the}} loss or {{disturbance}} of breeding habitat, pollution and increased predation. Gull populations have increased over the <b>last</b> <b>century</b> because of reduced persecution {{and the availability of}} food from human activities, and terns have been forced out of many traditional nesting areas by the larger birds. A few species are defying the trend and showing local increases, including the Arctic tern in Scandinavia, Forster's tern around the Great Lakes, the Sandwich tern in eastern North America and its yellow-billed subspecies, the Cayenne tern, in the Caribbean.|$|E

The 1990 Manjil–Rudbar earthquake, with at least 42,000 fatalities, cost Iran roughly 7.2 percent of its Gross National Product (GNP) for that year and wiped out two years of economic growth.|$|E
5|$|The grey-headed {{flying fox}} {{is now a}} {{prominent}} federal conservation problem in Australia. Early in the <b>last</b> <b>century,</b> the species was considered abundant, with numbers estimated in the many millions. In recent years, though, direct evidence has been accumulating that the species is in serious decline. Current estimates for the species are between 200,000 - 300,000 and the national population may have declined by over 30% between 1989 and 1999 alone.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture is the {{dominant}} source of income in the area surrounding Randolph, especially the cultivation of cotton. Corn, beans and peas were also cultivated during the <b>last</b> <b>century.</b> After {{the abolition of slavery}} in 1865, sharecropping was the primary means of income for low income families in the area. Mostly for the cultivation of cotton, land would be used by sharecroppers in return for a share of the crop to the landowner. Modern machines such as the cotton picker have made the manual cultivation obsolete over time as they took over the work from the hand laborers.|$|E

5|$|Cockfighting {{is said to}} be the world's oldest spectator {{sport and}} may have {{originated}} in Persia 6,000 years ago. Two mature males (cocks or roosters) are set to fight each other, and will do so with great vigour until one is critically injured or killed. Breeds such as the Aseel were developed in the Indian subcontinent for their aggressive behaviour. The sport formed part of the culture of the ancient Indians, Chinese, Greeks, and Romans, and large sums were won or lost depending on the outcome of an encounter. Cockfighting has been banned in many countries during the <b>last</b> <b>century</b> on the grounds of cruelty to animals.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} centuries, the Byzantines were usually on the defensive, and avoided open field battles, preferring {{to retreat to}} their {{fortified}} strongholds. Only after 740 did they begin to launch counterstrikes of their own, but still the Abbasid Empire was able to retaliate with often massive and destructive invasions of Asia Minor. With the decline and fragmentation of the Abbasid state after 861 and the concurrent strengthening of the Byzantine Empire under the Macedonian dynasty, the tide gradually turned. Over a period of fifty years from ca. 920 to 976, the Byzantines finally broke through the Muslim defences and restored their control over northern Syria and Greater Armenia. The <b>last</b> <b>century</b> of the Arab–Byzantine wars was dominated by frontier conflicts with the Fatimids in Syria, but the border remained stable until {{the appearance of a}} new people, the Seljuk Turks, after 1060.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th {{and early}} 19th century, Ceredigion had more {{industry}} {{than it does}} today; Cardigan was the commercial centre of the county; lead, silver and zinc were mined and Cardigan was the principal port of South Wales prior to the silting of its harbour. The economy became highly dependent on dairy farming and the rearing of livestock for the English market. During the <b>last</b> <b>century,</b> livestock farming has become less profitable, and the population of Cardiganshire has been in decline as people moved to the more prosperous parts of Wales or emigrated to other countries. More recently, the population has started rising again as elderly people move into the county for retirement, and various government and European Union initiatives have encouraged tourism and other alternative sources of income.|$|E
