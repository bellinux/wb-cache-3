In Indonesia, precious opal is found at the Lebak Regency, Province of Banten. Banten’s opal widely has been recognized due to its beautiful opalescence. This paper is {{a review of the}} last research; preliminary study of Banten’s opal, characteristics of opal-CT and determining of opal type from geochemical data, added by new data to compile concept and to make mineralization model. In order to fulfill these targets, field geology research and analysis of mineralog/gemology, petrography, X-RD, and major and trace element geochemistry have been done. The Banten’s opal is opal-CT showing opalescence (play of colour), weathering, and leaching silica from volcanic glass by dark grey claystone hosted. Mineralization model is divided into three periods; at Early Pliocene volcanic clastic sediments rich in volcanic glass occured as fluvial sediments. Afterwards, at Late Pliocene - Pleistocene folding, weathering and leaching of silica took place. Intensive jointing, faulting, and folding quickened weathering and leaching processes to formed opal at <b>limb</b> <b>of</b> <b>anticline</b> through Holocene. The prospecting area of Banten’s opal is in tuff unit with intercalation of conglomerate or pumiceous breccia, at <b>limb</b> <b>of</b> <b>anticline.</b> The host rock of opal is dark grey claystone which underlies polimict conglomerate/pebbly sandstone sequence with cross stratification, imbricated, and erossional stucture; more than 8 m deep. </p...|$|E

40|$|The Tianshan Mountains are an {{important}} active structural belt {{in the interior of}} Eurasia. By integrated methods of surface geology survey and interpretation of seismic profiles, we distinguish fold scarps located at the south <b>limb</b> <b>of</b> the Kuqatawu <b>anticline</b> and the north <b>limb</b> <b>of</b> the Dongqiulitag <b>anticline</b> in the Kuqa rejuvenation foreland thrust belt, south piedmont of central segment of the Tian- shan Mountains. Fold scarp is a newly found structural phenomenon. Because of the bend of thrust plane and the movement of hanging wall above the thrust plane, the origi- nal horizontal deposits of hanging wall and their surface become a monocline structure, resulting from the separating and migration of the active and fixed axial surfaces. Meas- uring the geometry of fold scarp and using the data of age of the deformed deposits, the crustal shortening rate resulting from the deeply seated subsurface thrust is calculated. The crustal shortening rate reflected by the fold scarp located at the north <b>limb</b> <b>of</b> the Dngqiulitag <b>anticline</b> is (1 ␣ 0. 1) mm/a.

40|$|Detailed {{geologic}} mapping in the Buckskin, Rawhide, and Artillery Mountains {{in western}} Arizona identified numerous folds in Oligocene-Miocene strata above the Buckskin-Rawhide extensional detachment fault. The folds are above or {{adjacent to the}} Harcuvar metamorphic core complex, which was uplifted and exposed by top-northeast normal faulting and penetrative shearing at similar to 27 - 9 Ma. Strata deposited during extension were folded, and the folds are truncated by the detachment fault, demonstrating that folding occurred {{during the period of}} extensional faulting. Fold axes are approximately perpendicular to regional extension direction. In two of the four areas of folding described here, alluvial-fan deposits derived partially from lower plate mylonitic rocks are the stratigraphically highest folded strata. Folding could have occurred above low-angle normal faults with curved or ramp-flat geometries, but fold abundance, large size, high degree of closure, and steep northeastward dips <b>of</b> the northeast <b>limbs</b> <b>of</b> <b>anticlines</b> lead us to consider the possibility that at least some folds reflect local shortening {{in the same direction as}} regional extension. Application of critical-taper theory to an extensional wedge with very low basal friction indicates that wedge shortening would be expected if the wedge developed a sufficient surface slope that was downhill away from the wedge tip. Such a slope could have developed late during extension either because core-complex uplift tilted the wedge away from the core complex or because alluvial fans shed off the core complex produced such a slope. In either case, wedge shortening would promote core-complex denudation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the diagenesis of carbonate conglomerates {{in that it}} assesses the potential of conglomerates in refining the paragenetic history in complex structural areas, such as the Albanian foreland fold-and-thrust belt. Of major interest are stylolites (burial and tectonic) which are restricted to conglomerate fragments or which crosscut the conglomerate matrix. Based on the inferred age of stylolite development in relation to burial, uplift and tectonic history, and the Lower to Middle Miocene age of the conglomerates, the succession of diagenetic events was subdivided into several stages. The Poçem polymict transgressive carbonate conglomerate (Kremenara anticline, central Albania) was deposited in a shallow marine environment. These conglomerates are covered by intertidal rhodolithic packstones–grainstones. The stable-isotope signature of these packstones–grainstones (δ 18 OV-PDB = − 1 · 0 to + 0 · 7 ‰; δ 13 C = + 1 · 0 to + 1 · 4 ‰) plots is {{within the range of}} marine Early and Middle Miocene values. Shortly after deposition of the conglomerates, micritization, geopetal infill and acicular calcite cementation took place. A first calcite vein generation is interpreted as having formed from a Messinian brine during shallow burial. Burial stylolites developed during further burial in the Pliocene. These stylolites serve as an important diagenetic time marker. The post-burial stylolite meteoric calcite vein cement probably precipitated during the following telogenetic stage.

The latter shows both normal and reversed polarities and provides the geomagnetic record for the late Jurassic. The magnetostratigraphy of the four overlapping sections has given consistent results and indicates that a high frequency of reversals characterises {{the pattern of the}} geomagnetic field during the middle to upper Oxfordian. The corresponding Oxfordian paleopole is slat = 251. 2 °,P 1 ong = 55 • 90 (a 95 = 3. 1) ...|$|R
40|$|The Tertiary compressional {{structure}} of the northern sector of the Almazan basin is defined by several E-W to NW-SE trending folds. These folds extend from the northern and eastern basin borders to the central part. Ceometrical reconstructions obtained {{from the study of}} seismic reflection profiles and outcrop observations indicate that the folds in the Paleogene beds can be followed to the Mesozoic strata below them and to the Palaeozoic basement. Their wavelength varies between 7 and 5 l<m, and their mean amplitude between 250 and 500 m. At surface most folds are asymmetric, the northern <b>limbs</b> <b>of</b> the <b>anticlines</b> reaching dips <b>of</b> 70 -, whereas at depth they are gentler and more symmetric. Disharmonic folding is due to minor detachments in {{the upper part of the}} sections. Other structures present in the northern part of the Almazan basin are normal faults, unconformably covered by the Paleogene units, and related to Mesozoic extension giving rise to the Cameros basi...|$|R
