40|$|Abstract. Children seem {{intrinsically}} {{motivated to}} manipulate, to explore, to test, {{to learn and}} they <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>activities</b> and situations that provide such learning opportunities. Inspired by research in developmental psychology and neuroscience, some researchers have started {{to address the problem}} of designing intrinsic motivation systems. A robot controlled by such systems is able to autonomously explore its environment not to fulfil predefined tasks but driven by an incentive to search for situations where learning happens efficiently. In this paper, we present the origins of these intrinsically motivated machines, our own research in this novel field and we argue that intrinsic motivation might be a crucial step towards machines capable of life-long learning and open-ended development...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. During recent years, Sweden {{has faced}} an {{increasing}} number of people being out of work due to long-term sick leave. This has led to numerous investigations and official reports on behalf of the Swedish government, concerning the necessity of measures to be taken to improve the health situation in working life, and to improve the sick listing and the rehabilitation processes. It {{is becoming more and more}} common to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>activities</b> outdoors or in nature in terms of restoration, health promotion or rehabilitation. Still there is no particular section or organization for care farms or related activities in Sweden today. The Federation of Swedish Farmers started a national project, Nature and Health, aiming at forming a network including researchers, public authorities, the private business world, the health-care sector and the green sector. There is a growing interest in working with health-promoting and rehabilitative measures with nature and farming as a basis. Several regional projects of this kind are about to start. Cooperation with researchers is very important to legitimate the work in the area of nature and health, in this case care farms and horticultural therapy. Most research in these fields is done at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Department of Landscape Planning Alnarp, where interdisciplinary research is conducted in which landscape architects dealing with design in relation to environmental psychology and researchers in other disciplines are working together. Collaborators regarding health and horticultural therapy are for example Karolinska Institutet, the Medical Faculty a...|$|E

40|$|Riga Technical University (RTU) is largest {{technical}} background {{university in}} Latvia. At the moment {{there are more}} than 15 000 students. Each of them is a member of unified university’s Moodle system and each term they participate in more than 2500 different subjects. It’s been 5 years since RTU started to implement e-learning in everyday study process. Considerable progress is achieved and most of academic staff has successfully transformed their work in everyday classroom learning as well as in e-learning. One of most important prerequisites for students to start using e-learning course is their satisfaction with quality and diversity of course materials and activities. Unfortunately academic staff often takes e-learning courses as place, where they upload various study related materials and forget about them. Students see it as a pile of files sometimes even without proper names. This leads to student inactivity and reduction of course visits. We saw rising of course quality as next logic step in e-learning promotion and began to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>activities</b> to achieve this goal. Several efforts were made. One of them was experiment – we found typical e-learning course as mentioned above – with lots of materials, but without order and structure. Of course we can’t push lecturer towards virtual communication or web 2. 0 tools, but we were able to use our knowledge and experience in e-learning course building, to upgrade course design and to create more intuitive layout. To measure results we used one of basic theories – Kano model, which was developed in the 80 ties. Research was composed from three steps. First, we offered poll to students from particular subject to elucidate their opinion about e-learning curse. Then we rebuilt it and asked those students for another poll. We also measured student activity in rebuilt course compared with previous years. Deeper analysis is laid out in this article...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} about the {{influences}} of motivation in the English Teaching and learning process of fifth year students on distance learning at the National school Rosa Montoya of El Cua, Jinotega, during the second semester 2011. The main purpose {{of this research is}} to assess how motivation influences in the English teaching and learning process specifically in these students. In addition, it tries to propose some strategies and techniques to support the teacher to become the class a place where the students feel excited and motivated to learn the English language and communicate in the real life. To study this topic is very important because teachers could discover the appropriate ways to increase the students’ motivation. Moreover, with this research paper teachers will be able to apply the strategies and techniques suggested to student’s reality, because {{it is important that the}} teacher knows each learner has different needs and individual preferences. For this reason, it is considered that the information stated in this study has considerable advantages to those teachers who face poor motivation in the classroom and specially those who do not have enough knowledge about theories and strategies. Regarding to this study, it was found that a low level of motivation is evident in the classroom: lack of students’ participation, students’ shyness, and little target language is used by the students, lack of self-study; lack of self confidence and a boring environment was seen in the classroom. Students are rewarded with grades most of the time to each task assigned, the students are worried only to pass the English class but they are not interested to learn how to communicate. The English teaching and learning process is developed in the traditional way. The old curriculum is used by the teacher. The method of teaching used by the teacher is: The grammar translation method. The class is organized in pair group, and group work. The means of teaching used by the teacher are handouts and the lesson plan. Actually, it is not easy for the teacher to keep students intrinsically motivated because there are many factors that influence in motivation. For example, those students’ internal needs which have been not satisfied, the only application of external motivators is not enough. For this reason, the teacher should <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>activities</b> to reinforce the intrinsic motivatio...|$|E
40|$|As stated above, the Eric Carle {{language}} arts activities I have created {{are based on}} current research presented in the literature review. First, {{it was found that}} activities that integrate the four main skill areas provide for the most rapid English development. For this reason, I divide the activities for each of the five Eric Carle books into four main categories: 1) Reading activities, 2) Writing activities, 3) Listening activities, and 4) Speaking activities (see "List 1 " below for a quick reference to these). Teachers should select activities from each of these categories as they will build off each other and create an integrated unit. Second, special attention is given to the area of Reading/Literacy development as this is a crucial part of the curriculum in all kindergarten through 3 rd grade classrooms. I used the findings of the National Reading Panel (2000) as the basis for my literacy activities. As shown in the literature review, they found that in order for a child to become literate she must develop skill in: 1. Phonemic awareness, 2. Phonics, 3. Fluency, 4. Vocabulary use, and 5. Text comprehension (see "List 2 " below for a quick reference to these). Due to the fact that phonemic awareness and phonics are the most basic of these skills, only the Eric Carle books for very young children include these activities. This correlates with early elementary Language Arts curriculum in general, in which phonemic awareness and phonics instruction ends at 2 nd grade. Third, in the literature review I considered the ESL Standards (TESOL, 1997) because these provide goals for LEP students' development and academic achievement. In this handbook, I note when a specific activity implements one of the standards so that teachers can <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>activities</b> to meet a specific ESL standard that students need work on. See "List 3 " below for a quick reference to the ESL goals and standards. By considering this current research, I hope that the tasks and activities I've developed may be used successfully to meet the linguistic, academic and affective needs of LEP/ELL students. In Part 1, teachers will be able to select one of the five Eric Carle books, and then choose from the variety of activities I've designed {{in order to meet the}} unique needs of their students. Furthermore they will be able to use Part 2 as a resource list of skills that can be taught from the other books. Because Eric Carle's books are highly interesting, children of all backgrounds will be excited about the activities. This will lead to rapid linguistic and academic development among LEP/ELL students. Department of EnglishThesis (M. A. ...|$|E

5000|$|Ice fishing {{methods have}} changed {{drastically}} {{over the past}} 20 years. The {{name of the game}} is mobility for today’s modern ice anglers. The days of drilling hole, waiting and hoping that a fish will swim by, are starting to fade. With light gear, battery-operated sonar units, and fast and powered augers, an angler can conceivably drill and check hundreds of holes in a single day. When the fish stop biting where they are, anglers can move to the next hole, checking it with their sonar first to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>activity,</b> and if there are no fish they will keep moving until fish are found. In addition, schools of fish tend to move around; so a hole may be productive for 10 minutes and then slow down to nothing for an hour before a school returns to that location. This [...] "fish where the fish are" [...] technique and ease of mobility increases the catch rate of any angler, because it minimizes the wait between bites, similar to [...] "trolling" [...] in summer.|$|R
