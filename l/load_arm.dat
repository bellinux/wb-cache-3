40|$|Juvenile animals {{must often}} compete against adults for common resources, keep pace during group travel and evade common predators, despite reduced body size and an {{immature}} musculoskeletal system. Previous morphometric studies of a {{diverse array of}} mammals, including jack rabbits, cats and capuchin monkeys, have identified growth-related changes in anatomy, such as negative allometry of limb muscle mechanical advantage, which should theoretically permit young mammals to overcome such ontogenetic limits on performance. However, {{it is important to}} evaluate the potential impact of such `compensatory' growth trajectories within the context of developmental changes in locomotor behavior. I used standard kinematic and kinetic techniques to investigate the ontogenetic scaling of joint postures, substrate reaction forces, joint <b>load</b> <b>arm</b> lengths and external joint moments in an ontogenetic sample of squirrel monkeys (Saimiri boliviensis). Results indicated that young squirrel monkeys were frequently able to limit forelimb and hind limb joint loading via a combination of changes in limb posture and limb force distribution, potentially compensating for limited muscularity at younger ages. These results complement previous morphometric studies and suggest that immature mammals may utilize a combination of behavioral and anatomical mechanisms to mitigate ontogenetic limits on locomotor performance. However, ontogenetic changes in joint posture, not limb length per se, explained most of the variation in <b>load</b> <b>arm</b> lengths and joint loading in growing squirrel monkeys, indicating the importance of incorporating both anatomical and performance measures when studying the ontogeny of limb joint mechanics...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To compare {{conventional}} exercise-based {{assessment of}} pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) with improvement in training exercises employed during a PR program, and {{to describe the}} cardiopulmonary response of different training exercises during PR of patients with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: Inpatient PR. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with moderate to very severe COPD (N= 18). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cardiopulmonary responses to interval cycling, arm exercise, and a test of functional activities of daily living (ADLs) were evaluated during the PR training program using a mobile telemetric breath-by-breath system. The effects of PR were evaluated by comparing pre-PR and post-PR training activities, incremental and constant work-rate cycling, and a 6 -minute walk test. RESULTS: Interval cycling and the ADLs test were moderate-intensity to heavy-intensity exercises (70 %- 80 % of maximal oxygen consumption), while the arm exercise was a low-intensity activity (40 % of maximal oxygen consumption). After 12 weeks of PR, cycle <b>load,</b> <b>arm</b> weights, and walking distances during training activities had increased alongside increased muscle mass. At iso-intensities, no cardiopulmonary changes in the training exercises were observed. Exercise duration of constant work-rate cycling and 6 -minute walk distance increased by 160 % and 14 %, respectively, after PR, with concurrent right-shifts of anaerobic threshold and a decrease in heart rate. CONCLUSIONS: Supervised increases in weight, load, and walking distance during training activities were useful clinical outcomes for patients, demonstrating the beneficial effects of progressive training on physical performance. However, for physiologic evaluation of PR, conventional tests, such as maximal incremental cycling, endurance cycling, and a 6 -minute walk test, had greater validity.

40|$|So {{that even}} if the {{increase}} in pulse rates by standing would be significant for the criterion of the cardio-pulmonary function, yet there [figure] Fig. 2 Frequency Distribution of Harvard-Step-Test Score (96 Cases) [figure] Fig. 3 Frequency Distribution of Schneider 2 ̆ 7 s Index (400 Cases) [figure] not, and its result was summarized in Tab. 2. The significant correlation could not be found between the time requied to 100 m. 2 ̆ 7 s running and the latter three. However, the time requied to 1500 m. 2 ̆ 7 s and 10000 m. 2 ̆ 7 s running had a certain relation to the pulse rates after J. S. D. F. 2 ̆ 7 s test and the scores by Harvard 2 ̆ 7 s step test. The pulse rates after J. S. D. F. 2 ̆ 7 s method was more intimately related to the scores at 1500 m. 2 ̆ 7 s running than those by Haverd 2 ̆ 7 s step test, but less intimately to the scores at 10000 m. 2 ̆ 7 s running than the latter. From the results above mentioned, even though the merits and demerits of three kinds of tests can not easily be discussed, so far as the examination of bodily strength is concerned, however Harvard 2 ̆ 7 s step test and J. S. D. F. 2 ̆ 7 s method may be concluded to be more available than Schneider 2 ̆ 7 s test. The similarity of the results seen between Harvard 2 ̆ 7 s step test and J. S. D. F. 2 ̆ 7 s method can be attributable to the common feature of these tests which do not take up both the severity of the load and the pulse rates before the load, but adopt the pulse rates for their criterions. These two methods are fairly siutable to screen the bodily strength in mass population owing to the methodological simplicity and the relatively high reliance. Nextly, in order to study why Schneider 2 ̆ 7 s cardie-pulmonary index does not show any correlation to the scores obtained by the running test, the propriety of both estimation of every item of scoring and its synthetic descrimination was investigated. The cardio-pulmonary index showed the close correlation to the pulse rates in recumbence Tab. 2 Correlation between Running and Simple Circulatory Function Test [table] which pulse rates come importantly into play (Tab. 1). Part I. The imfluences of postural changes and exercise loading upon pulse rates and blood pressure level. Part II. Criticism upon some tests of physical strength. With special. reference to healthy men of the Japanese Self-Defense Force (J. S. D. F.), the examination of bodily strength was performed by means of Harvard 2 ̆ 7 s step test, Schneider 2 ̆ 7 s test and J. S. D. F. 2 ̆ 7 s test (arm stretch and flection in arm-toe position) at Tab. 1 Mean and Standard Deviation for each Measurement [table] Healthy Self Defence Men 600 cases Age 18 〜 31 yrs (Average 23. 7 yrs) as well as in standing and to the fluctuation of the systolic pressure level due to postural change. Therefore the cardio-pulmonary index may be said not to have any uniform degree of the correlation to every item of the scorings, that is, one might say that the overestimation of three items above mentioned is not quite fair. Tab. 3 Correlation between Each Constituent of Schneider 2 ̆ 7 s Index and Others (400 cases) [table] Level of Significance σr= 1 /√, 30 σr<r, 3 σr=± 0. 150 Furthermore these three items were not co-related to the scores obtained by 100 m 2 ̆ 7 s, 1500 m. 2 ̆ 7 s and 10000 m. 2 ̆ 7 s running tests respectively, so that the synthetic estimation with three sorts of scores may not, just as it is, be regarded as the criterion of the physical strength. Then, in order to examine whether any error may exist in the scoring of each item, the correlation was investigated among the scoring of each item. As shown in tab. 3 and fig. 4, the significant correlation could not be observed among the increase in the pulse rates by recumbence and standing; so far as the range of the pulse rates in recumbence adopted for samples is concerned (nig. 4), these may be no necessity to score the increasing rate of the pulse rates by standing with regard to the extent of the pulse rates in recumbence as Schneider had already emphasized. The time required at 100 m. 2 ̆ 7 s 1500 m. 2 ̆ 7 s and 10000 m. 2 ̆ 7 s running test was used to the quantitative criterion of physical strength. J. S. D.
