40|$|Casting is a final {{metallurgical}} {{operation in}} steel metallurgy. After the melting in primary furnace (BOF,EAF), steel is tapped in steel <b>ladle,</b> <b>treated</b> on secondary furnace (ladle furnace) and finally sent for ingot casting. After cooling, casting products (ingots) are treated in forge plant or rolling mill. The final result of ingot casting {{is to make}} simple geometrical shapes aimed for further plastic deformation. The modern approach for ingot casting implicates an application of secondary metallurgy, steel degassing and casting. For this concept application {{it is necessary to}} have appropriate devices and equipment and to lead the process as per exact technological instructions. In this elaborate the modern concept of ingot casting with main characteristic is given, but focus will be on the equipment and devices necessary for casting technology...|$|E
