50|$|Originally {{the ships}} were only armed with two 120 mm mortars, though Ouragan was given four 40 mm machine guns. However in 1993, the two ships were {{upgraded}} with two Matra Simbad twin missile <b>launchers</b> <b>armed</b> with the Mistral infrared surface-to-air missile. The anti sea-skimmer missile has a homing range to 4 km and carries a 3 kg warhead. Orage was also given two Breda/Mauser 30 mm/70 guns.|$|R
50|$|The navy {{operated}} ten Osa I-class and six Rade Končar-class missile boats. The Osa I {{boats were}} armed with four SS-N-2A surface-to-surface missile launchers. In 1990 domestic Kobra boats {{were scheduled to}} begin replacing the Osa I boats. The Kobra was to be armed with four SS-N-2C launchers or eight Swedish RBS-15 antiship missile <b>launchers.</b> <b>Armed</b> with two SS-N-2B launchers, the Končar-class boats were modeled after the Swedish Spica class. The navy's fifteen Topcider-class torpedo boats included four former Soviet Shershen-class and eleven Yugoslav built units.|$|R

5000|$|On May 18, Atlas 7D was {{prepared}} for a night launch of an RVX-2 reentry vehicle from LC-14, the second attempt to fly one after the launch of a C-series Atlas had miscarried two months earlier. The test was conducted with the Mercury astronauts in attendance in order to showcase the vehicle that would take them into orbit, but 64 seconds of flight ended in another explosion, prompting Gus Grissom to remark [...] "Are we really {{going to get on}} top of one of those things?". This failure was traced to improper separation of the right launcher hold-down pin, which damaged the B-2 nacelle structure and caused helium pressurization gas to escape during ascent. At 62 seconds into the launch, the pressure in the LOX tank exceeded the pressure in the RP-1 tank, which reversed the intermediate bulkhead. Two seconds later, the missile exploded. Film review confirmed that the hold-down pin on the right <b>launcher</b> <b>arm</b> failed to retract at liftoff and was jerked from the missile. The resultant force caused a four-inch gap in the B-2 nacelle structure which also damaged low pressure helium lines. The hold-down pin had not retracted due to a sheared retaining bolt in the bell crank pulley system in the right <b>launcher</b> <b>arm.</b> Once again, all other systems in the Atlas functioned well and there were no problems not directly attributable to the launcher malfunction. The flight of 7D resulted in improved maintenance procedures for the launcher equipment at CCAS and use of higher heat steel in the bell crank retaining bolts.|$|R

5000|$|The {{first new}} Jetfire {{in a decade}} {{was a member of}} the Cyberjets, highly poseable, ball-jointed jets with pressure-activated {{launching}} missiles. A repaint of the Decepticon figure released at the same time named Hooligan -- and consequently erroneously decorated with Decepticon symbols -- this figure bore some physical resemblance to his original (unarmored) self, although his color scheme and missile <b>launcher</b> <b>arm</b> drew attention away from his familiar shape. His tech spec bio made it clear that this was still the same Jetfire as before. Cyberjet Jetfire could be partially transformed into a forward-kneed [...] "gerwalk" [...] mode, but his rear wings and tail made the figure too top-heavy to stand upright for very long.|$|R

5000|$|The squad's TO&E also {{included}} a grenade <b>launcher</b> team <b>armed</b> with what historians often mistakenly call a [...] "knee mortar". This {{was in fact a}} light mortar of 50mm that threw high explosive, illumination and smoke rounds out to as much as 400 meters. Set on the ground and fired with arm outstretched, the operator varied the range by adjusting the height of the firing pin within the barrel (allowing the mortar to be fired through small holes in the jungle canopy). The balance of the squad carried bolt-action rifles.|$|R

By creating patterns with these colors on a 10×10 grid, and possessing the required amount of EVP, the creature may gain a new part it may add to its head, body, legs, or <b>arms.</b> The <b>logic</b> behind what patterns yield what parts, however, remains unclear.|$|R
50|$|Army Rangers {{found the}} M3 Carl Gustaf was best {{employed}} using a two-man team. One person {{would carry the}} <b>launcher</b> and be <b>armed</b> with a pistol for personal protection, and the other would carry 5-6 rounds of ammunition and act as a spotter for the gunner. Although the single-shot AT-4 is lighter and can be carried by one person, a Gustaf team with the heavier recoilless rifle can reload and fire more rounds.|$|R
30|$|The Cyclone V SE SoC has a {{physical}} limitation {{that does not}} allow the transmission of 512 bits in one clock cycle. So, we have created a wrapper in Verilog to connect the MD 5 code (in FPGA) with the <b>ARM.</b> This <b>logic</b> splits the transfer between FPGA and ARM in transfers of 32 bits, until the 512 bits are transfered (see Code 7). Thus, the input signals inwdata and inaddr and output signal outrdata are mapped in the ARM registers and can be easily accessed from the software layer.|$|R
50|$|Al-Qaeda-affiliated militants calling {{themselves}} the Sons of Hadhramaut seized an oil terminal and infantry base in Mukalla on 16 April, {{as well as}} an air defense base and military airport on the city's outskirts. Yemeni troops reportedly deserted their posts to avoid a fight with the militants. The jihadists also captured a massive weapons depot that contained dozens of tanks, Katyusha rocket <b>launchers</b> and small <b>arms.</b> With this advance, Al-Qaeda consolidated its hold on Hadhramaut province.|$|R
5000|$|In 2005 the Hatf VII Babur ground-launched {{cruise missile}} was {{revealed}} {{in a public}} test-firing. Early versions had a range of 500 km but later a 700 km variant was tested. In September 2012 a new launch vehicle was tested, {{as well as a}} new command and control system named the Strategic Command and Control Support System. It was stated that the SCCSS would give [...] "decision-makers at the National Command Centre robust command and control capability of all strategic assets with round the clock situational awareness in a digitised network-centric environment." [...] It was also stated that the Babur's guidance system uses terrain contour matching (TERCOM) and digital scene matching and area co-relation (DSMAC) techniques to achieve accuracy described as [...] "pin-point". The new launch vehicle, a MAZ transporter erector <b>launcher,</b> is <b>armed</b> with three missile rounds launched vertically.|$|R
50|$|Missile 8B on September 14 {{continued}} the streak of pneumatic system difficulties when the LOX tank pressure regulator went full open for five seconds starting at T+210 seconds, {{resulting in a}} surge in tank pressure. The problem {{in this case was}} suspected to be caused by above-normal helium bottle temperatures. In addition, vernier hydraulic pressure failed again during vernier solo phase. Missile 6B broke the streak of successful flights on September 18 when it exploded 82 seconds after liftoff. The cause of the failure was traced to a seized turbopump, which resulted in abrupt termination of B-1 engine thrust at T+80 seconds. LOX regulator pressure fell off, resulting in gas generator flameout and complete shutdown of both booster engines, followed by missile pitch-up and structural breakup. It was suspected that flying debris from the turbopump had ruptured the LOX regulator sense line. At liftoff, one of the <b>launcher</b> hold-down <b>arms</b> had also not retracted properly, which resulted in holes being torn in the B-1 thrust structure, however this was quickly ruled out as a cause of the failure.|$|R
50|$|LC-14 was {{the first}} Atlas pad in {{operation}} and hosted the initial test flights in 1957-58. It was also {{the only one of}} the original four Atlas pads to never have a booster explode on it. By 1959, it was decided to convert the pad for the Atlas D missile and space launches, and a large service tower was added early in the year. The first Atlas flown from the renovated LC-14 was Missile 7D on May 18, however a problem with the <b>launcher</b> hold-down <b>arms</b> damaged the missile and caused its explosion shortly after launch. This was traced to improper procedures during the renovation of the pad and was quickly fixed. The first space launch off of LC-14 was the Big Joe Mercury test in September. As the designated Mercury-Atlas facility, LC-14 was thus the only Atlas pad sporting the infrastructure needed for manned launches. The first MIDAS satellites, one Atlas-Able launch, and a few more ICBM tests were conducted from LC-14 before it was completely turned over to NASA.|$|R
50|$|The Baleares {{class are}} {{a group of}} five frigates built for the Spanish navy in the 1970s. The ships are a {{modified}} version of the American s. The key differences are the replacement of the Sea Sparrow PDMS and ASW helicopter facilities by Standard SAM and associated radars. They received a SPS-52B 3D search radar and one SPG-51 illuminator for the Standard SM-1 medium range SAM, fired from a Mk22 16-round single <b>arm</b> <b>launcher.</b> The SQS-26 long range LF sonar was replaced by a SQS-23G MF sonar, while two Mk25 tubes for Mk37 torpedoes were mounted in the transom. The SQS-35 variable depth sonar was maintained.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} three-phase evolution search methodology {{to automatically}} design fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs) {{that can work}} {{in a wide range}} of operating conditions. These include varying load, parameter variations, and unknown external disturbances. The three-phase scheme consists of an exploration phase, an exploitation phase and a robustness phase. The first two phases search for FLC with high accuracy performances while the last phase aims at obtaining FLC providing the best compromise between the accuracy and robustness performances. Simulations were performed for direct-drive two-axis robot arm. The evolved FLC with the proposed design technique found to provide a very satisfactory performance under the wide range of operation conditions and to overcome problem associated with coupling and nonlinearities characteristics inherent to robot <b>arms.</b> Keywords—Fuzzy <b>logic</b> control, evolutionary algorithms, robustness, exploration/exploitation phase I...|$|R

25|$|The infiltrators, {{apart from}} being {{equipped}} with small <b>arms</b> and grenade <b>launchers,</b> were also <b>armed</b> with mortars, artillery and anti-aircraft guns. Many posts were also heavily mined, with India later stating to have recovered more than 8,000 anti-personnel mines according to an ICBL report. Pakistan's reconnaissance was done through unmanned aerial vehicles and AN/TPQ-36 Firefinder radars supplied by the US. The initial Indian attacks were aimed at controlling the hills overlooking NH 1D, with high priority being given to the stretches of the highway {{near the town of}} Kargil. The majority of posts along the Line of Control were adjacent to the highway, and therefore the recapture of nearly every infiltrated post increased both the territorial gains and the security of the highway. The protection of this route and the recapture of the forward posts were thus ongoing objectives throughout the war.|$|R
5000|$|The Cyberdemon is not {{mentioned}} in the manual for the original PC version, possibly so as to make his appearance a surprise for the player. The manual for the console versions describe him as [...] "half unfeeling machine, half raging horned devil. This walking nightmare has a rocket <b>launcher</b> for an <b>arm</b> and will definitely reach out and touch you." [...] In the first Doom, the Cyberdemon is the toughest character, with 4,000 hit points (an equivalent of 40 direct rocket hits), receiving no splash damage from explosions. The Cyberdemons return in Doom II: Hell on Earth, where one is depicted on the cover art and the title screen. A redesigned Cyberdemon is the final boss in the reboot game Doom 3, where it is described as the [...] "Hell's mightiest warrior" [...] and can be killed only with the Soul Cube.|$|R
