This research was conducted by using the descriptive methodology i. e. a discrete simulation model of the process <b>of</b> <b>tuna</b> cargo handling in the export warehouse of PT.

In the policy making <b>of</b> <b>tuna</b> cargo handling improvements, the Analytical Network Process, Benefit, Opportunity, Cost, and Risk (ANP BOCR) were also used. The simulation results point out that the existing conditions contribute to the delay level <b>of</b> <b>tuna</b> cargo delivery by 12 % with the quality level of 22, 934 %. Delays in tuna cargo delivery have led to an increase in operational costs by 1, 5 %. ANP BOCR results highlight that opening a special lane for perishable cargo handling will improve the performance <b>of</b> <b>tuna</b> cargo handling in the export warehouse of PT. XYZ. Furthermore, the results of discrete model simulations on the improvement scenario <b>of</b> <b>tuna</b> cargo handling performance show that by opening a special lane for perishable cargo handling, it can ensure delivery schedule to be accurate indicated by the level of on time delivery reaching up to 100 %, with an average quality rate of 86. 013 %.
