40|$|Abstract. —Estuarine food webs {{are highly}} {{variable}} and complex, making identification of their trophic pathways difficult. Energy {{for the food}} web of the San Francisco Estuary {{is thought to be}} based largely on in situ phytoplankton production, but little {{attention has been paid to}} littoral habitats, where other energy sources may be important. We analyzed the stomach contents of over 960 juvenile fishes and the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios of these fishes and their potential food resources in pelagic and littoral habitats from the tidal freshwater area of the estuary. The mixing model IsoSource was used to examine energy sources important to consumers. Our results show evidence of two predominant food web pathways. Pelagic fishes and some <b>littoral</b> <b>fishes</b> showed strong dependence on a zooplankton–phytoplankton trophic pathway. However, the majority of fishes in littoral habitats had diets and carbon isotope ratios consistent with energy arising from submerged aquatic vegetation and epiphytic macroalgae. IsoSource revealed that the overall majority of nutrition of <b>littoral</b> <b>fishes</b> originated from consumption of grazer amphipods. Examining both stable isotopes and stomach contents allowed us to identify a food web with contributions to resident fishes that had been previously underestimated in the estuary. This study provides insight to how estuarine food webs have changed over the last few decades and highlights why the functions of habitats must be understood for effective restoration planning...|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} macrophytes presence {{in the structure of}} <b>littoral</b> <b>fish</b> assemblages in the littoral zone, monthly samples were collected from September, 2006 to August, 2007 in an impounded tributary of the Itá Reservoir, the Fragosos River, located in the Upper Uruguay River Basin. Fish were collected using a beach seine and sampling was conducted in the littoral zone inside a macrophyte stand and in an area with no macrophytes. A total of 5, 191 fish were captured during the study period. Fish assemblage attributes (fish abundance, species richness, and diversity) varied significantly between sampling months and areas. The abundance of Astyanax cf. bimaculatus, Astyanax fasciatus, Geophagus brasiliensis, and Gymnotus carapo also varied significantly between sampling months and areas. Detrended Correspondence Analysis showed a clear spatial segregation at the first axis and a slight temporal segregation at the second axis. These results were confirmed by Multiple Response Permutation Procedure analysis. Apparently, the presence of the aquatic macrophytes is not the only factor influencing the distribution of <b>littoral</b> <b>fish</b> assemblages in the Fragosos River. <b>Littoral</b> <b>fish</b> seem to be taking advantage of low- to medium-sized macrophyte stands, but few species used maximum-sized stands...|$|R

40|$|Many estuarine and {{freshwater}} ecosystems worldwide {{have undergone}} substantial changes due to multiple anthropogenic stressors. Over {{the past two}} decades, the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Delta) in California, USA, saw a severe decline in pelagic fishes, a shift in zooplankton community composition, and a rapid expansion of invasive aquatic vegetation. To evaluate whether major changes have also occurred in the <b>littoral</b> <b>fish</b> community, we analyzed a beach seine survey dataset collected from 1995 to 2015 from 26 sites within the Delta. We examined changes in the Delta fish community at three different ecological scales (species, community, and biomass), using clustering analyses, trend tests, and change-point analyses. We found that the annual catch per effort for many introduced species and some native species have increased since 1995, while few experienced a decline. We also observed a steady pattern of change over time in annual fish community composition, driven primarily by a steady increase in non-native Centrarchid species. Lastly, we found that <b>littoral</b> <b>fish</b> biomass has essentially doubled over the 21 -year study period, with Mississippi Silverside Menidia audens and fishes in the Centrarchidae family driving most of this increase. The changes in the catch per effort, fish community composition, and biomass per volume indicate that a shift {{has occurred in the}} Delta <b>littoral</b> <b>fish</b> community and that the same factors affecting the Delta's pelagic food web may have been a key driver of change...|$|R

40|$|Stable {{carbon and}} {{nitrogen}} isotope signatures have been determined for <b>littoral</b> <b>fishes</b> from three localities in the Balearic Islands (NW Mediterranean) for trophic assessment. Variation in the isotopic composition was examined at multiple levels: the individual organism, individual populations (ontogenetic variation) and at area effects (different islands). Cluster analyses based on δ 13 C and δ 15 N resulted in {{two very different}} dendrograms for the fish assemblages from Menorca and Formentera. In both schemes, congeners of the genera Diplodus and Labrus did not cluster together, suggesting that closely related species do not necessarily feed on similar foods. Significant differences in δ 15 N were detected between locations for Scorpaena porcus, Scorpaena scrofa and Sciaena umbra, and significant differences in δ 13 C were detected for Scorpaena porcus and Scorpaena scrofa. Overall there were significant spatial differences in the trophic position of <b>littoral</b> <b>fishes</b> among the three Balearic Islands, and fishes from Palma, Mallorca tended to feed at a higher trophic level than fishes from either Menorca and Formentera. Large-scale geographic comparisons, using earlier data from three sites in western Mallorca and in Corsica revealed that throughout the western Mediterranean generally, the average trophic level of fishes differs remarkably little. However, large discrepancies were observed in δ 15 N for individual species, notably Scorpaena porcus, D. annularis, D. vulgaris and Serranus scriba. 13 C composition of fishes {{did not seem to}} change greatly among the locations, although marked discrepancies were observed for D. puntazzo and Mullus surmuletus. Given the large-scale patterns we have observed, {{it is possible that the}} extent of multichannel omnivory which has been purported to exist in complex aquatic systems, may have been greatly overstated. Regression of δ 15 N and δ 13 C with fish body size revealed clear and significant trends for some species. In particular, δ 15 N appeared to increase with body length in the macrocarnivorous fishes Scorpaena porcus, Scorpaena scrofa. Serranus scriba and Sciaena umbra. Trends were less apparent in animals which feed primarily on small benthic invertebrates, notably the four Diplodus species (D. vulgaris, D. sargus, D. annularis, D. puntazzo), and the labrids Labrus viridis and L. merula. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

40|$|The Kariega Estuary is a freshwater-deprived system due to {{numerous}} impoundments in the catchment. This system {{has had little}} or no horizontal salinity gradient over the last 15 years, with hypersaline conditions sometimes predominating in the upper reaches. Following high rainfall events in the catchment during the spring of 2006, including a flood event (approximate 1 : 10 year) in August 2006, a series of riverine pulses entered the estuary and a horizontal salinity gradient was established. This study examined the influence of this freshwater pulse on four components of the biota within the estuary, namely the zooplankton, and larval, littoral and demersal fishes. The study demonstrated that in three of these components elevated densities were recorded following the riverine input, with only the <b>littoral</b> <b>fishes</b> retaining an almost constant density. In addition, changes in the relative contributions of the estuarine utilisation classes for all three fish groups examined indicated that freshwater input into these systems positively influences the abundances.

40|$|During {{a three-year}} field study, {{interspecific}} and interannual {{differences in the}} trophic ecology of <b>littoral</b> <b>fish</b> species were investigated in the rocky intertidal of Helgoland Island (North Sea). We investigated trophic niche partitioning of common coexisting <b>littoral</b> <b>fish</b> species based on a multi tracer approach using stable isotope and fatty acids {{in order to show}} differences and similarities in resource use and feeding modes. The results of the dual tracer approach showed clear trophic niche partitioning of the five target fish species, the goldsinny wrasse Ctenolabrus rupestris, the sand goby Pomatoschistus minutus, the painted goby Pomatoschistus pictus, the short-spined sea scorpion Myoxocephalus scorpius and the long-spined sea scorpion Taurulus bubalis. Both stable isotopes and fatty acids showed distinct differences in the trophic ecology of the studied fish species. However, the combined use of the two techniques added an additional resolution on the interannual scale. The sand goby P. minutus showed the largest trophic plasticity with a pronounced variability between years. The present data analysis provides valuable information on trophic niche partitioning of fish species in the littoral zones of Helgoland and on complex benthic food webs in general. ...|$|R
40|$|Settlement is {{a process}} through which {{demersal}} <b>littoral</b> <b>fishes</b> go from a planktonic stage to a benthonic stage. Understanding this process is fundamental in order to evaluate recruitment processes and population dynamics. The analysis of settlement (pre-settlement phases including the pelagic stages that are about to migrate to the bottom, and post-settlement phases {{that have already been}} recruited to the bottom but don’t usually appear in conventional fishing gears) is rare in the Mediterranean Sea and data exist only for few species within the frame of very specific objectives. Locating settlement pulses is key to understand connectivity patterns and to spatially delimit/evaluate MPAs. Sampling of these phases requires specific methods whose design is more developed for tropical environments than temperate latitudes. In addition, pre-settled individuals often escape conventional plankton nets, making it necessary to develop innovative methods of sampling. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare six different methods of sampling in terms of species composition, capture efficiency, size-spectra and abundance in order to determine the best combination of techniques to assess settlement processes in temperate littoral species. We used three types of pelagic nets (bongo 40, beam trawl and WP 2 ring of 80 cm) and two types of light traps (Quatrefoil and Ecocean C. A. R. E) to sample pre-settled individuals whilst a type of beam trawl of low impact for the bottom was evaluated to catch post-settled individuals. We obtained at least three replicates per sampling gear for each of two nights in May and June 2012, during the peak of the spawning season for summer species. Sampling was conducted in the Bay of Palma, characterized by large littoral fish populations and known to be an area of both high selfrecruitment (Basterretxea et al. 2012) and high recreational fishing pressure (Morales-Nin et al. 2010). Individuals were identified and measured to the nearest 0. 1 mm (SL). Our results show significantly different size-spectrum for each method, with a continuum of sizes from 2 mm to 200 mm SL with the smallest sizes taken by the bongo, followed by the ring net, the neuston net, the quatrefoil, the Ecocean and finally the beam trawl. Consistent differences were found in the two sampling periods. In general, the pelagic nets collected high abundance of presettlement stages, the light-traps caught post-larval stages about to settle, and the beam trawl sampled mainly larger juveniles but also recent settlers of key littoral species. These results prove that an optimal strategy for sampling key littoral species around settlement is possible by selecting the Ecocean C. A. R. E. for pre-settlers and beam trawl for post-settlers, which should guarantee further insight into recruitment processes in <b>littoral</b> <b>fishes</b> of temperate water. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Ichthyologically speaking, {{one of the}} least-explored {{parts of}} North America is Baja California. From the waters along its coast several {{hitherto}} unknown species have been collected. One of these, a very distinct kind of rockfish or scorpionfish (a {{member of the family}} Scorpaenidae), is described in this contribution. The single specimen, a large adult, was presented to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography by the Hall-Booth Fish Company of San Diego, as Accession No. 1252. The fishermen who took this fish were not consulted, but according to information obtained from the company, the specimen was included among some "rock cod" (Sebastodes) that were caught in the Pacific Ocean off Cedros Island on May 14, 1931. The rockfish grounds off this island are on the west side, where an abundance of kelp grows on the rocky bottom in shallow water.

40|$|Stable isotope {{analyses}} {{were employed to}} explore feeding and foraging habitats and trophic levels of <b>littoral</b> <b>fishes</b> in a western Mediterranean Marine Protected Area (Egadi Islands, Sicily, Italy). Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios were measured in primary producers, invertebrates and fishes collected in December 2001 and January 2002. Fishes of the littoral region of the Egadi Islands had isotopic signatures that fell into a wider range for δ 13 C (about 6 ‰) than for δ 15 N (about 3 ‰). Carbon isotope ratios were consistent with a food web based on mixed sources and two trophic pathways leading to different fish species. Differences in the isotopic composition between islands were higher for benthivorous than for planktivorous fishes. The overall picture gained from this study is of a isotopic distinction between planktivorous and benthivorous fishes, resource partitioning facilitating the coexistence of similar species within the same ecosystem, and spatial variability in the isotopic signatures and trophic level of fishes. Asymmetrical analysis of variance showed that estimated trophic levels were lower in the area with {{the highest level of}} protection (Zone A) for only two out of the nine fishes analysed. As a consequence, overall spatial differences {{do not seem to be}} a consequence of protection, since in most cases trophic levels did not change significantly between zone A and zones C where professional fishing (trawling apart) is permitted, but of natural sources of variation (e. g. variability in food availability and sitespecific food preferences of fishes).

Fish were sampled in several locations at night with large beach seines during spring, summer and fall of 1995 - 1998. Long-term changes were inferred from comparison with a similar study conducted over 70 y earlier in Spirit Lake. We found 26 species in the littoral zone. The number of species per sample ranged from 4 to 18, averaging 11. 8. The average number of species per sample was higher at stations with greater vegetation density. A distinct seasonal pattern was evident in the number of species collected per sample in most years, increasing steadily from spring to fall. Patterns of variability within our 1995 - 1998 study period suggest that: (1) numerous samples are necessary to adequately characterize a <b>littoral</b> <b>fish</b> community, (2) sampling should be done when vegetation and young-of-year densities are highest and (3) sampling during a single year is inadequate to reveal the full community.

Mitochondrial DNA analysis indicated that seven of eight haplotypes were diagnostic for either the <b>littoral</b> or profundal <b>fish,</b> with 66. 6 % of the variation being found within form groupings. Pairwise tests of microsatellite data indicated significant differences in nine of 12 loci and {{a significant difference between}} the forms across all tested loci.

40|$|Lake Liambezi in the Zambezi Region of Namibia, {{formerly}} known as the Caprivi Region, is shallow (< 6 m deep) and characterised by cyclic episodes of filling and drying. When full the lake supports a highly productive fishery and when dry the lake is completely dry and used for agriculture and grazing. In 2000 the lake filled, and between May 2011 and April 2012 was surveyed using beach seine, experimental gillnets and catch landing surveys to obtain information for conservation and management recommendations for the fishery. <b>Littoral</b> <b>fishes</b> in Lake Liambezi and the Kavango floodplain were sampled using seine net and physicochemical properties were measured. Seine net surveys demonstrated that Lake Liambezi littoral zones were dominated by fishes of the family Alestidae (59. 7 %) while Cichlids constituted the most diverse family. Juvenile Tilapia rendalli and Oreochromis macrochir were among the five most important species in the littoral zone, indicating that these commercially important species use the littoral zone as a nursery ground. Since T. rendalli and O. macrochir are commercially important species, because of this, it is advised that seine nets should not be used. Catch efficiency between monofilament and multifilament gillnets in Lake Liambezi offshore waters were assessed. Catch efficiency experimental fishing trials showed that monofilament gillnets catch per unit effort (CPUE) was three times higher than that of multifilament gillnets for Oreochromis andersonii, O. macrochir, T. rendalli, Serranochromis macrocephalus and Clarias spp. Oreochromis andersonii comprised over 66 % of the overall CPUE for both net types combined indicating the importance of this species in the gillnet fishery on the lake. A fishery has been established on the lake with more than 300 canoes and 120 fishermen using monofilament and multifilament gillnets. CPUE was 15 kg/canoe/day and was significantly (P < 0. 05) associated with monthly temperature and moon phase parameters indicating that the fishery of Lake Liambezi may be altered by climate and environmental factors. Annual catch from Lake Liambezi was estimated at 3193 t with an estimated productivity of 106 kg/ha, suggesting that Lake Liambezi makes a significant contribution to the fish supply in the Zambezi Region. Recommendations were made to manage the Lake Liambezi fishery by imposing restrictions on effort (number of fishing boats), gear type, mesh sizes and access. Proper fisheries management and monitoring should incorporate climatic and environmental factors such as temperature and moon phase {{to meet the challenges of}} global climatic changes as well as other environmental issues...|$|E

In the present study, we evaluate <b>littoral</b> <b>fish</b> communities using data from spearfishing contests. The Catalan Federation of Underwater Activities (FECDAS) regularly organizes fishing contests across ca. 600 km of coast. Catch records made over the last sixteen years were used to study the fish communities along the coastline. We found two different communities that {{are closely related to}} the habitat configuration at a regional level. Interestingly, contests held on the northern coast were mainly grouped together and were characterized by species that inhabit complex rocky habitats, and contests held on the southern coast were grouped together and were mainly determined by soft bottoms species (i. e. mugilids and Sarpa salpa). In the south group the white sea bream was also very abundant compared to the north group. No significant changes in the community composition were found in the studied period and we successfully set descriptive baselines.

We hypothesized that fyke netting selects for small-bodied fishes and electrofishing selects for large-bodied fishes. Three sites were sampled during May (2004 and 2005), July (2005 only), and September (2004 and 2005). We {{found that the}} species composition of captured fish differed considerably between fyke netting and electrofishing based on nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). Species strongly associated with fyke netting (based on NMDS and relative abundance) included the brook silverside Labidesthes sicculus, banded killifish Fundulus diaphanus, round goby Neogobius melanostomus, mimic shiner Notropis volucellus, and bluntnose minnow Pimephales notatus, whereas species associated with electrofishing included the Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, catostomids (Moxostoma spp. and Catostomus spp.), freshwater drum Aplodinotus grunniens, walleye Sander vitreus, gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum, and common carp Cyprinus carpio. The total length of fish captured by electrofishing was 12. 8 cm (95 % confidence interval ¼ 5. 5 – 17. 2 cm) {{greater than that of}} fish captured by fyke netting.

40|$|Contrary {{to common}} belief, {{empirical}} {{evidence shows that}} a number of marine <b>littoral</b> <b>fish</b> species tend to remain in a small geographic area. Despite the growing awareness about the consequences of reduced mobility (e. g. design of marine protected areas), an accurate description of fish movement is technically difficult; thus, it is usually not considered. Mark-release-(single) -recapture (MRsR) data obtained from externally tagged fish that are returned by fishermen or recreational fishers are potentially useful for describing fish movement. The present study is a methodological contribution aimed at demonstrating a simple analytic strategy for estimating the size of the circular home range (i. e. the area where a fish spends most of the time) from MRsR data. This analytic strategy is not adequate for pelagic or large predators moving at the oceanic scale but could be suitable for some reef or <b>littoral</b> <b>fish.</b> The estimates obtained by this method are robust even if (1) the number of recaptured fish is small, (2) fishing effort or habitat suitability displays some spatial variability and (3) fish display some intra-specific variability. Based on only 32 recaptures, our data demonstrate that Coris julis (a small labrid targeted by recreational fishers) is more sedentary than previously assumed; this fish spends 95 % of its time within an area 227 m in radius (Bayesian 95 % credibility interval: 192 to 275 m). © Inter-Research 2011.

50|$|The {{indigenous}} Fuegians {{belonged to}} several tribes including the Ona (Selk'nam), Haush (Manek'enk), Yaghan (Yámana), and Alacaluf (Kawésqar). All of these tribes except the Selk'nam lived exclusively in coastal areas. The Yaghans and the Alacaluf traveled by birchbark canoes around {{the islands of}} the archipelago, while the coast dwelling Haush did not. The Selk'nam lived {{in the interior of}} Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego and lived mainly by hunting guanacos. The Ona were exclusively terrestrial hunter gathers that hunted terrestrial game such as guanacos, foxes, tuco-tucos and upland nesting birds as well as <b>littoral</b> <b>fish</b> and shellfish. The Fuegian peoples spoke several distinct languages: both the Kawésqar language and the Yaghan language are considered language isolates, while the Selk'nams spoke a Chon language like the Tehuelches on the mainland.|$|R
40|$|Seagrasses form {{high-productivity}} coastal ecosystems, providing habitats {{for many}} organisms, including species of commercial value. They {{play a significant}} role as a direct food source for herbivores and enter detrital food webs. In this review the trophic ecology of Mediterranean seagrass ecosystems is revised, with major emphasis on Posidonia oceanica, the most extensively studied seagrass. The major topics are the role of herbivory and detritus, the contribution to <b>littoral</b> <b>fish</b> production, exportation to other ecosystems and their role as vectors of anthropogenic nutrients into food webs, and are discussed by analysing both conventional knowledge and new insights derived from the application of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis. In conclusion, perspectives for future research are highlighted, with particular emphasis on areas demanding further study and on the effects of seagrass decline on trophic organization in coastal environments...|$|R
40|$|Given {{increasing}} human {{demands for}} freshwater, {{it is imperative}} to identify environmental flows that maintain native species, their habitats, and key ecosystem dynamics. A major challenge is determining requirements for seasonal flow pulses that promote fish spawning, early life stage survival, dispersal, and other processes that maintain native stocks. Our study investigated hydrology, fish reproduction, larval abundance, survivorship, and community assemblage of larval fish in both the lower Brazos and middle Trinity rivers in Texas and the <b>littoral</b> <b>fish</b> assemblage in the lower Brazos River. From March 2013 to March 2014, abiotic environmental data were collected along with data on fish abundance, reproduction, and recruitment. Larval fish were collected bimonthly at night using three arrays of stationary driftnets arranged along transects perpendicular to the shoreline. Seine nets were used to sample fish assemblages in shallow littoral habitats. Asteriscus otoliths, from metalarvae and juvenile Macrhybopsis hyostoma, were removed and patterns between hatch date estimates and discharge were analyzed to determine if recruitment was related to streamflow. Multivariate statistical analyses based on seine samples revealed that discharge significantly explained variation in the <b>littoral</b> <b>fish</b> assemblage in the Brazos River. In both the Brazos and Trinity Rivers, multivariate analyses of driftnet data indicated that water temperature had the strongest association with patterns of larval fish abundance, based on evaluations at the family level. Cyprinid protolarvae, in aggregate, {{did not seem to be}} constrained by hydrology, as evidenced by their high abundance throughout the reproductive season (April?September). Hatch dates from surviving Macrhybopsis hyostoma indicated that recruitment was greater on flow pulses and on days with increasing discharge. Ongoing work to identify larval fish to species level is needed to elucidate how flow regime components influence reproduction and recruitment of fluvial specialists. This information will significantly augment our currently limited knowledge of the life histories of minnows inhabiting Gulf coastal rivers, which in turn will assist in evaluating environmental flow regimes...|$|R

40|$|In {{this note}} {{we report on}} changes of {{activity}} level of <b>littoral</b> <b>fish</b> and their use of different microhabitats in an altered intertidal environment, where intertidal fish are never emersed and turbulence is confined to high tides. Despite these atypical conditions, {{the structure of the}} assemblage is basically the same found in a typical rockyshore situation. Two intertidal fish known to possess internal tidal rhythms, Lipophrys pholis and Coryphoblennius galerita, retain those rhythms in these altered conditions, and the associated social changes in L. pholis are also retained. These observations support the studies of Gibson (1971), who showed that changes in hydrostatic pressure were of prime importance in keeping the tidal rhythm entrained. The subtidal Parablennius pilicornis, on the contrary, is more active during low tide than at high tide. The hypothesis that some subtidal species are excluded from the intertidal by a turbulence-avoiding mechanism is discussed...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the extent of}} damage to rocky bottom and soft bottom communities {{as well as to}} <b>littoral</b> <b>fish.</b> Damage has been registered along the whole of the coastline from the west coast of Sweden to the Haugesund area inclusive. Hardest hit were stretches from Grimstad to Kristiansand and from Farsund to Flekkefjord. Depths between 3 and 16 were affected along the most of the coastal region. In some localities depths of between 0 and 30 m were affected. The acute effects on rocky bottom organisms have been severe. Soft bottom organisms were less affected than rocky bottom organisms. The common dog whelk Nucella lapillus was almost completely exterminated. Wrasse showed the greatest mortality among wild fish. The year's cod fry were more or less wiped out. In addition, mortality among farmed salmon was high. New surveys should be conducted to observe any later effect as well as the process of recolonization. State Pollution Control Authorit...|$|R
