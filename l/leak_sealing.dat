40|$|Abstract: The injecting online <b>leak</b> <b>sealing</b> {{technology}} {{is an emergency}} repair technique widely applied in process industry, which can remove the leakages of the devices, flanges, pipes and valves, with safe, reliable, economic and efficient. In a variety of online <b>leak</b> <b>sealing</b> operations, the work to handle flange leakages accounts for about 90 % of the entire workload. This is because most of flanges in actual production have the installing and machining defects, such as uneven clearance, eccentric, reducing, etc. Aimed at those flanges with defects, to ensure the seal effect, the online <b>leak</b> <b>sealing</b> clamp must be machined and installed precisely, which will increase the difficulty of operation. Thus, {{on the basis of}} comparing advantages and disadvantages of the existing enhanced seal clamps, a new design has proposed {{to solve the problem of}} flange leakage, especially for the flange with defects, which can reduce the difficulties of operation while ensuring the sealing effect...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Along {{with the}} rapid {{development}} of chemical industry and the progress of science and technology, there exist safety risks for {{a large number of}} risk source pipelines. On the basis of the conventional containment measures for risk source leakage, this paper designed two types of emergency devices and corresponding rapid closure methods. One type is the pipeline <b>leak</b> <b>sealing</b> airbag inside the risk source. It is constituted by sealing institutions, diversion institutions, keep institutions and fixed institution. During the work, the sealing airbag gets inflated to realize the rapid closure inside in the piping. It is applicable to the sealing of the heat, water supply, the chemical pipeline, and even large pipe leakages. It also provides the diversion function. The second type the external leakage sealing gasbag for the risk source pipelines. It is compositioned by the belt type rubber air mattress,left and right sides of adjustable bits semi-manipulator mechanism. It is mounted using the belt type rubber layers of tilt superposition around in pipe outside. When needed the air gets inflated inside the gasbag, making each layer of air cushion tension bridle and mutual extruding, to execute rapid closure for the pipeline leakage. These two types of devices are easy to carry, require low professional training, while are highly efficient for the fast closure of the pipeline leakages...|$|E
40|$|Approximately 10 {{percent of}} the natural gas pumped into {{distribution}} systems is unaccounted for. A significant portion of this amount is leakage from joints in 50 to 100 year old cast iron main. Because of the cumulative effects of many small leaks, these leaks must be repaired even though the repair expense is not always justified by {{the value of the}} gas conserved. Part One identifies and evaluates <b>leak</b> <b>sealing</b> techniques of the past and present by compiling available test data. A major task was to review all documented test results in journals and technical reports. This study followed-up on published articles by contacting all the individuals and organizations concerned. Recommendations for future development of an alternate sealing system are made. Part Two discusses preliminary criteria for the design of an alternative system to seal main joints from within the main without service interruption. Experiments were performed showing that very soft elastomers pressed against the rough pipe wall could prohibit leakage. Potential cleaning methods were tested. Wire and abrasive wheels, and water-jets were recommended for further development. Based on time-dependent characteristics and resistance to aging and to chemicals found in mains, fluorocarbon was recommended for use as the seal material.

40|$|Forced air {{distribution}} systems {{can have a}} significant impact on the energy consumed in residences. It is common practice in U. S. residential buildings to place such duct systems outside the conditioned space. This results in the loss of energy by leakage and conduction to the surroundings. In order to estimate the magnitudes of these losses, 24 houses in the Sacramento, California, area were tested before and after duct retrofitting. The systems in these houses included conventional air conditioning, gas furnaces, electric furnaces and heat pumps. The retrofits consisted of sealing and insulating the duct systems. The field testing consisted of the following measurements: leakage of the house envelopes and their ductwork, flow through individual registers, duct air temperatures, ambient temperatures, surface areas of ducts, and HVAC equipment energy consumption. These data were used to calculate distribution system delivery efficiency as well as the overall efficiency of the distribution system including all interactions with building load and HVAC equipment. Analysis of the test results indicate an average increase in delivery efficiency from 64 % to 76 % and a corresponding average decrease in HVAC energy use of 18 %. This paper summarizes the pre- and post-retrofit efficiency measurements to evaluate the retrofit effectiveness, and includes cost estimates for the duct retrofits.

40|$|Inefficiencies in air {{distribution}} {{systems have been}} identified as a major source of energy loss in US sunbelt homes. Research indicates that approximately 30 [...] 40 % of the thermal energy delivered to the ducts passing through unconditioned spaces is lost through air leakage and conduction through the duct walls. Field experiments {{over the past several years}} have well documented the expected levels of air leakage and the extent to which that leakage can be reduced by retrofit. Energy savings have been documented to a more limited extent, based upon a few field studies and simulation model results. Simulations have also indicated energy loss through ducts during the off cycle caused by thermosiphon-induced flows, however this effect had not been confirmed experimentally. A field study has been initiated to separately measure the impacts of combined duct <b>leak</b> <b>sealing</b> and insulation retrofits, and to optimize a retrofit protocol for utility DSM programs. This paper describes preliminary results from 6 winter and 5 summer season houses. These retrofits cut overall duct leakage area approximately 64 %, which translated to a reduction in envelope ELA of approximately 14 %. Wrapping ducts and plenums with R- 6 insulation translated to a reduction in average flow-weighted conduction losses of 33 %. These experiments also confirmed the appropriateness of using duct ELA and operating pressures to estimate leakage flows for the population, but indicated significant variations between these estimates and measured flows on a house by house basis. In addition, these experiments provided a confirmation of the predicted thermosiphon flows, both under winter and summer conditions. Finally, average material costs were approximately 20 % of the total retrofit costs, and estimates of labor required for retrofits based upon these experiments were: 0. 04 person-hrs/cm{sup 2 } of duct sealed and 0. 21 person-hrs/m{sup 2 } of duct insulated...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurpose: The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate risk factors, natural history, and clinical consequences of a periprosthetic leak after endovascular repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Methods: We reviewed the initial and follow-up data, including angiograms, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans, abdominal duplex scans, and plain abdominal films for all patients undergoing tube graft repair using the endovascular graft system (early prototype) between February 10, 1993, and January 24, 1995. Results: Sixty-eight patients underwent placement or attempted placement of a tube graft implant in 13 centers in the United States. Nine patients required conversion to open repair, leaving 59 patients with functioning grafts for evaluation. The mean follow-up time was 27 ± 8 months (range, 2 to 48 months). Twenty-eight (47 %) of 59 patients had initial periprosthetic leaks (6 proximal, 14 distal, 3 proximal and distal, 5 indeterminate) on their first postoperative CT scans. Fourteen (50 %) of the initial 28 <b>leaks</b> <b>sealed</b> spontaneously. Two other patients had their <b>leaks</b> <b>sealed</b> by endovascular means, leaving 12 patients with persistent leaks for follow-up evaluation. Four patients developed late leaks between 18 and 24 months of follow-up: one who had a spontaneously <b>sealed</b> initial <b>leak,</b> one with a second leak, and two who developed late leaks. Of the 16 patients with <b>sealed</b> <b>leaks,</b> 10 had aneurysm size reduction during follow-up. Three aneurysm sacs enlarged before spontaneous sealing but have not had sufficient follow-up time to document the size change since the seal. One patient died of respiratory failure 5 months after graft implantation. One patient whose <b>leak</b> was <b>sealed</b> by intervention has not yet had a CT scan for evaluation. In one patient with a <b>sealed</b> <b>leak</b> and whose aneurysm had initially shrunk, the area reopened and progressed to a nonfatal rupture that was surgically corrected. There were two late deaths from unrelated causes. Twelve patients in the sealed group are alive and well. Of the 12 patients with persistent leaks, five underwent open surgical repair without complication, and one underwent successful endovascular repair with a second graft. Six patients continue to live with their initial grafts and have an average aneurysm sac enlargement of 0. 1 cm per year. Conclusions: Although initial periprosthetic leaks were common with the use of this early prototype, 50 % spontaneously sealed. The subsequent clinical course of patients with persistently <b>sealed</b> <b>leaks</b> was no different from that of patients who had no leaks. However, continued CT surveillance is warranted, because in one patient with an initially <b>sealed</b> <b>leak,</b> the area reopened and progressed to nonfatal rupture. Another two patients without initial leaks developed late leaks. In a small group of selected patients with continued leaks, their aneurysms appeared to enlarge at a rate considerably slower than would have been expected in patients with untreated aneurysm, suggesting that even a person after endovascular repair with a persistent leak may have had some beneficial hemodynamic modification.

The maximum <b>leak</b> sizes that <b>sealed</b> under simulated field conditions were a slit, 0. 016 times 0. 291 in. (leak rate, 1. 34 gpm) and a 0. 046 inch diameter hole (leak rate, 0. 63 gpm).
