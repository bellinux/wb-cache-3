25|$|A solid body {{electric}} guitar, {{made up of}} hardwood with a <b>lacquer</b> <b>coating,</b> is {{an electric}} guitar that has no hollow internal cavity to accommodate vibration. There are no sound holes such as those used to amplify string vibrations in acoustic guitars. The sound that is audible in music featuring electric guitars is produced by pickups on the guitar that convert the string vibrations into an electrical signal, usually fed into an amplifier or a speaker. The solid body guitar was invented in 1941 by American recording artist Les Paul.|$|E
2500|$|Original master discs {{are created}} by lathe-cutting: a lathe is used to cut a {{modulated}} groove into a blank record. The blank records for cutting used to be cooked up, as needed, by the cutting engineer, using what Robert K. Morrison describes as a [...] "metallic soap", containing lead litharge, ozokerite, barium sulfate, montan wax, stearin and paraffin, among other ingredients. Cut [...] "wax" [...] sound discs would {{be placed in a}} vacuum chamber and gold-sputtered to make them electrically conductive for use as mandrels in an electroforming bath, where pressing stamper parts were made. Later, the French company Pyral invented a ready-made blank disc having a thin nitro-cellulose <b>lacquer</b> <b>coating</b> (approximately 7 mils thickness on both sides) that was applied to an aluminum substrate. Lacquer cuts result in an immediately playable, or processable, master record. If vinyl pressings are wanted, the still-unplayed sound disc is used as a mandrel for electroforming nickel records that are used for manufacturing pressing stampers. The electroformed nickel records are mechanically separated from their respective mandrels. This is done with relative ease because no actual [...] "plating" [...] of the mandrel occurs in the type of electrodeposition known as electroforming, unlike with electroplating, in which the adhesion of the new phase of metal is chemical and relatively permanent. The one-molecule-thick coating of silver (that was sprayed onto the processed lacquer sound disc in order to make its surface electrically conductive) reverse-plates onto the nickel record's face. This negative impression disc (having ridges in place of grooves) is known as a nickel master, [...] "matrix" [...] or [...] "father". The [...] "father" [...] is then used as a mandrel to electroform a positive disc known as a [...] "mother". Many mothers can be grown on a single [...] "father" [...] before ridges deteriorate beyond effective use. The [...] "mothers" [...] are then used as mandrels for electroforming more negative discs known as [...] "sons". Each [...] "mother" [...] {{can be used to make}} many [...] "sons" [...] before deteriorating. The [...] "sons" [...] are then converted into [...] "stampers" [...] by center-punching a spindle hole (which was lost from the lacquer sound disc during initial electroforming of the [...] "father"), and by custom-forming the target pressing profile. This allows them to be placed in the dies of the target (make and model) record press and, by center-roughing, to facilitate the adhesion of the label, which gets stuck onto the vinyl pressing without any glue. In this way, several million vinyl discs can be produced from a single lacquer sound disc. When only a few hundred discs are required, instead of electroforming a [...] "son" [...] (for each side), the [...] "father" [...] is removed of its silver and converted into a stamper. Production by this latter method, known as the [...] "two-step process" [...] (as it does not entail creation of [...] "sons" [...] but does involve creation of [...] "mothers", which are used for test playing and kept as [...] "safeties" [...] for electroforming future [...] "sons") is limited to a few hundred vinyl pressings. The pressing count can increase if the stamper holds out and the quality of the vinyl is high. The [...] "sons" [...] made during a [...] "three-step" [...] electroforming make better stampers since they don't require silver removal (which reduces some high fidelity because of etching erasing part of the smallest groove modulations) and also because they have a stronger metal structure than [...] "fathers".|$|E

50|$|Traditionally the {{painters}} {{are known as}} chitrakars. A patta painter's home with {{all the members of}} family is his studio. Woman members prepare the glue, the canvas and apply colours what we call the fill-in, and give the final <b>lacquer</b> <b>coating.</b> The master hand, mostly the male member, draws the initial line and gives the final finishing.Patta paintings are done on small strips of cotton cloth. The canvas is prepared by coating the clothe with a mixture of chalk and gum made from tamarind seeds. Then it is rubbed by taking the help of two different stones and then the cloth is dried.The mixture of gum and chalk gives the cloth's surface a leathery finish on which the artists paint with vegetable, earth and stone colours.The painters do not use pencil or charcoal for the preliminary drawings. They are so expert in the line that they simply draw directly with the brush either in light red or yellow. Then the colours are filled in. The final lines are drawn and the patta is given a <b>lacquer</b> <b>coating</b> to protect it from weather, thus making the painting glossy.

50|$|The MAG-95 pistol relies to a {{large extent}} on design {{features}} from the later Browning designs, and others, combining features from several weapons into one pistol. The locking system is the widely used dropping barrel and cam action of the Browning series. This is combined with a double-action trigger mechanism combined with a hammer decocking lever which allows the external hammer to be lowered in safety when a round is chambered. Only a positive 50 N pull on the trigger will allow the hammer to recock for firing the round. The barrel is chrome plated to prolong its life and to permit easier cleaning. The MAG-95 is suitable for use by both right and left-handed users and is designed for two-handed operation. It is claimed that the pistols are well balanced to produce greater accuracy when rapid firing. The box magazine contains 15 rounds; optional 20 and 10-round magazines are available. Other options include a laser target indicator to be mounted in front of the trigger guard.

40|$|Lacquered metal wires have {{electrically}} insulating <b>lacquer</b> <b>coat(s),</b> {{at least one}} of which consists of an organically modified silica (hetero) polycondensate (I). (I) is obtained by (partial) hydrolytic condensation of compound(s) of silicon (Si) and optionally other element(s) selected from boron (B), aluminium (Al), phosphorus (P), tin (Sn), lead (Pb) and transition, lanthanide and actinide metals and/or precondensates derived from these compounds. Condensation is carried out with water and moisture, optionally {{in the presence of a}} catalyst and/or solvent. Also claimed is a method of producing the lacquered wires. USE - The lacquered wires are used for making coils or windings e. g. in electric motors or clocks (all claimed). ADVANTAGE - Lacquers based on polyimides and polyamides cannot always withstand the mechanical stress occurring especially in coil winding. Satisfactory flexibility is required, together with Increased adhesion and resistance to scratching, scraping and abrasion, e ven at relatively high temperatures, and there should be no harmful emissions on heating. Other requirements are fast cure and the use of no or non-toxic, non-corrosive solvent.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{investigates the}} problematic of indoor air pollution. There were tested low emitting types of lacquers – UV and waterborne lacquers. The {{work has been}} splitted in to two parts. In the first part samples of lacquers were applied on the particle board with beech veneer on the surface. Samples of air with VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds) from lacquers were taken 3 and 24 hours after application. Tests proved that film layer of UV lacquer emit much smaller volumes of VOCs than acrylic waterborne lacquers or than 2 –component epoxide waterborne lacquer. Acrylic waterborne lacquers’ materials emitted especially butoxyethylene, epoxide lacquer emitted a lot of butoxyethanol and methoxypropanol and UV lacquers particularly emitted toluene, benzene and xylene. Se­cond part of testing consists of VOCs’ measuring of chosen lacquers applied on different base materials – inertial material glass and particle board with beech veneer. Tested criterion was the impact of different base material on emitted amount of VOCs. The results showed that <b>lacquer</b> <b>coated</b> on glass emit much more chemicals than lacquer on wood material.

50|$|In 1977, one of {{the early}} {{implementations}} of mutual capacitance touchscreen technology was developed at CERN based on their capacitance touch screens developed in 1972 by Danish electronics engineer Bent Stumpe. This technology was used to develop a new type of human machine interface (HMI) for the control room of the Super Proton Synchrotron particle accelerator. In a handwritten note dated 11 March 1972, Stumpe presented his proposed solution - a capacitive touch screen with a fixed number of programmable buttons presented on a display. The screen was to consist of a set of capacitors etched into a film of copper on a sheet of glass, each capacitor being constructed so that a nearby flat conductor, such as the surface of a finger, would increase the capacitance by a significant amount. The capacitors were to consist of fine lines etched in copper on a sheet of glass - fine enough (80 μm) and sufficiently far apart (80 μm) to be invisible (CERN Courier April 1974 p117). In the final device, a simple <b>lacquer</b> <b>coating</b> prevented the fingers from actually touching the capacitors.

5000|$|Tests {{have shown}} that steel-cased Wolf cases do not obturate {{sufficiently}} to form a good gas seal against the chamber when compared to brass-cased ammunition. As a result, when Wolf cartridges are fired, some of the combustion by-products are deposited between the case and the chamber, causing a buildup of carbon that is well in excess of normal. Firing a brass case (that does expand fully) after using Wolf ammunition without cleaning the gun first can result in the brass case being [...] "glued" [...] into the chamber by the carbon buildup. This issue {{has nothing to do}} with the <b>lacquer</b> <b>coating</b> vaporising or melting, as has mistakenly been suggested. The problem is one of carbon deposition, which creates the same end result (i.e.; a stuck cartridge that has jammed in the chamber). It is important to emphasise that Wolf ammunition is perfectly safe to use because it conforms to all SAAMI standards. However, it is recommended that firearms be thoroughly cleaned after using Wolf ammunition due to the increased rate of carbon buildup within the chamber. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, the looser chamber dimensions of Soviet-designed weapons allow for more room during firing and extraction. Soviet or East Bloc weapons do not experience these problems.|$|E
