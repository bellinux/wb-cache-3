5000|$|Wire decking is {{commonly}} used as a safety measure on selective pallet rack to prevent pallets or the products stored on them from falling through the rack structure. Wire mesh decking comes in various thicknesses and mesh dimensions. Wire mesh construction also allows for easy identification of shelf contents and prevents dirt and other debris from accumulating on the shelves because of {{the holes in the}} mesh. Most wire mesh decking has U-shaped channel supports, also known as struts, to support the load. With this waterfall decking, the wire mesh extends across the top and down the front of the beam to provide more support, and is more desirable in the marketplace. Reverse waterfall decking can provide containment of a <b>loose</b> <b>product</b> to prevent the product from falling behind the rack system. Lay-in decking rests inside the step of the beam, and wire mesh does not waterfall over the beam. Some types of decking are manufactured with solid metal instead of wire mesh. Even though the solid decking provides a greater distributed weight capacity, it is discouraged by fire inspectors because sprinkler systems cannot spray through the shelves to levels below.|$|E
40|$|Background : Adulteration of {{food items}} is common {{phenomenon}} in India. It includes both willful adulteration to improve texture {{and quality of}} food items and supply of substandard food items. The usual outcomes is outbreak of food borne illness. Aims & Objectives : i) To estimate the prevalence of food adulteration in selected food items ii) the awareness of subjects regarding food adulteration act and iii) their buying practices. Material and Methods : Samplesize: 150 households was sampled, based on prevalence of adulteration to be around 50 %, with 95 % confidence interval and absolute allowable error of 10 %. Sample household were drawn from the selected villages randomly. Pre-designed and pretested questionnaires was administered to fulfill the objectives and food items were tested using NICE food adulteration kit. Data were analyzed by numeral with percentage, Pearson’s correlation test and F test. Results: In 59. 3 % households, housewives purchased the food items for the house. The prevalence of adulteration ranged from 17. 3 % to 66. 2 % in selected food items. <b>Loose</b> <b>product</b> was purchased by 54. 3 %. The food labels on packed items was not read by 86. 3 %. Mean percentage of purity was highest among literates (57. 3 ± 12. 3) than illiterates and those having primary education. Statistically significant F ratio was seen for mean percentage of purity and respondent’s literacy status. Conclusion : Adulterant is rampant in poor strata of  society due to consumer’s illiteracy and lack of awareness towards food safety rules. </p...|$|E
40|$|Several {{products}} of artesunate plus amodiaquine (AS + AQ) are being deployed in malaria-endemic countries for treating uncomplicated falciparum malaria but dosing accuracy and consequential effects on efficacy and tolerability {{have not been}} examined. Patients with parasitologically confirmed, uncomplicated falciparum malaria were treated and followed by research teams or local health centre staff in Casamance, Senegal. AS + AQ was given as: (i) loose combination (AS 50 mg, AQ 200 mg), dosed on body weight, or (ii) co-blistered product (AS 50 mg, AQ 153 mg) dosed by weight or age. Target doses were: (i) AS 4 (2 - 10) mg/kg/day and (ii) AQ 10 (7. 5 - 15) mg/kg/day. Patients receiving therapeutic doses defined dosing accuracy. Treatment-emergent signs and symptoms (TESS) were recorded. A total of 3277 patients were treated with loose (n = 1972, weight-dosed) or co-blistered (n = 1305, 962 age-dosed, 343 weight-dosed) AS + AQ by the research team (n = 966) or clinic staff (n = 2311). AS was dosed correctly in > 99 % with all regimens. Loose AQ by weight was 98 % correct. The co-blister AQ overdosed 18 % of patients when dosed by age and underdosed 13 % by weight. Low weight was an independent risk factor for overdosing. The co-blister had significantly more TESS than the <b>loose</b> <b>product</b> [117 / 1305 (9 %) vs. 41 / 1972 (2 %), relative risk = 4. 3 (95 % CI: 3. 0 - 6. 1, P < 0. 0001) ]. Age-based dosing accounted for the difference. TESS occurred mostly within one day (72 %) and were mild or moderate (75 %). Artesunate is easier to dose than AQ. Currently available age-dosed, co-blistered AS + AQ tends to overdose AQ and is less well tolerated than loose tablets. It is not the optimal presentation of AS + AQ...|$|E

The total depth of compression was about 1. 25 mm (0. 05 in.).

We conducted an open-label, randomized, 6 -way, crossover study involving 20 healthy snus and cigarette users. One of 6 products (2 pouched snus, 2 weights of loose snus, a cigarette, and a nicotine gum) was administered at each of 6 visits. Blood samples were taken at intervals over 120 min and sensory perception assessed by questionnaire. For the 4 {{smokeless tobacco}} products and the nicotine gum, blood plasma levels of nicotine were ranked according to total nicotine content as follows: loose snus (27. 1 mg nicotine) > pouched snus (14. 7 mg nicotine) > loose snus (10. 8 mg nicotine) = pouched snus (10. 7 mg nicotine) > nicotine gum (4. 2 mg nicotine). The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration (C-max) of nicotine ranged from 26. 9 to 13. 1 ng. h/ml and 17. 9 to 9. 1 ng. h/ml, respectively across all the products.

40|$|N-Reactor fuel {{constitutes}} almost 80 % of {{the entire}} mass of the US Department of Energy's (DOE's) spent fuel inventory. The current plan for disposition of this fuel calls for interim dry storage, followed by direct repository disposal. However, this approach may not be viable for the entire inventory of N-Reactor fuel. The physical condition and chemical composition {{of much of the}} fuel have changed during the period that it has been in storage. The cladding of many of the fuel elements has been breached, allowing the metallic uranium fuel to react with water in the storage pools producing uranium oxides (U{sub x}O{sub y}) and uranium hydride (UH{sub 3 }). Even if the breached fuel is placed in dry storage, it may continue to undergo significant changes caused by the reaction of exposed uranium with any remaining water in the container. Uranium oxides, uranium hydride, and hydrogen gas are expected to form {{as a result of this}} reaction. The presence of potentially explosive hydrogen and uranium hydride, which under certain conditions is pyrophoric, raises technical concerns that will need to be addressed. The electrometallurgical treatment process developed by Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) has potential for conditioning degraded N-Reactor fuel for long-term storage or disposal. The first step in evaluating the applicability of this process is the preparation of degraded fuel that is similar to the actual degraded N-Reactor fuel. Subsequently, the simulated degraded fuel can be introduced into an electrorefiner to examine the effect of corrosion products on the electrorefining process. Some of the technical issues to be resolved include the viability of direct electrorefining without a head-end reduction step, the effect of adherent corrosion products on the electrorefining kinetics, and the recovery and treatment of <b>loose</b> corrosion <b>products</b> that pull away from the degraded fuel.

40|$|Microbially {{influenced}} corrosion (MIC) is {{a costly}} and poorly understood source of corrosion that plagues many modern industrial {{processes such as}} oil extraction and transportation. Throughout the years, many possible mechanisms for MIC have been proposed. One specific proposed mechanism was tested in this thesis: that the metal-binding characteristic of bacterial biofilms enhanced corrosion when it appears in conjunction with an iron sulfide film. Two model biogels were used: calcium alginate, which has this metal-binding property, and agarose, which does not. In pursuit of this hypothesis, iron sulfide films were grown on mild steel coupons. Two distinct forms of iron sulfides were grown: a <b>loose</b> black <b>product</b> at low sulfide concentrations, and an adherent gold product at high sulfide concentrations. Many materials characterization techniques were attempted, and the black corrosion product {{was found to be}} a mixture of greigite and marcasite. However, this composition was observed to change irreversibly with the application of a laser that caused the material to either heat and/or dry. The resulting golden-colored corrosion product was found to consist mainly of monosulfides, implying the presence of mackinawite or pyrrhotite. By using electrochemical polarization experiments, it was found that calcium alginate enhanced the rate of corrosion; agarose reduced the rate of corrosion. This is in contrast to previously published literature. Contrary to the initial hypothesis, adding an underlying iron sulfide film did not appreciably alter the measured rate of corrosion. Additionally, it was found that biofilms generated by sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) enhanced corrosion {{in a manner similar to}} the calcium alginate gel, and lysing the cells within the biofilm did nothing to alter this effect. This implies that the biofilm itself, even in the absence of active bacterial metabolic activity, can enhance corrosion rates observed in MIC. by Kwan Li. Thesis: S.

40|$|The primary {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to determine whether herbal infusions, yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis A. St. -Hilaire) and rooibos (Aspalathus linearis (Burm. F.) R. Dahlgren), could make a significant contribution to the dietary intake of polyphenols. A secondary aim was to determine whether the trace elemental content of these herbal infusions were of dietary significance. The total polyphenol (using the Folin-Ciocalteu assay), the individual polyphenol compounds (by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography) and the trace element content (by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry) was determined in the leaf and infusions of 47 yerba mate and 54 rooibos commercial products (tea bags and loose leaf). This research, for the first time, developed an extraction procedure and two ultra-high performance liquid chromatography methods that enabled the determination of 38 polyphenol compounds in yerba mate and 22 in rooibos samples. Fourteen trace elements were determined in leaf and infusion samples, enabling the extraction efficiency of trace elements to be calculated for the first time for these herbs. The total polyphenol content of green yerba mate (79. 9 – 303. 1 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE) / 200 ml) and fermented rooibos infusions (40. 1 – 101. 9 mg GAE/ 235 ml) was within the range of that of other beverages (tea, coffee, fruit juices) as reported in the literature. It was noted that yerba mate in tea bags contained significantly higher levels of polyphenols than <b>loose</b> leaf <b>products</b> (ANOVA and Tukey’s test, probability, p < 0. 05) due to the absence of stems. The total chlorogenic acid content of green tea bag yerba mate (90. 1 – 395. 4 mg/ 200 ml) and the total flavonoid content of fermented rooibos infusions (6. 65 – 20. 03 mg/ 235 ml) was higher than that reported for coffee and fruit juices, respectively. It was concluded that regular consumption of 1 - 2 cups/day of yerba mate or rooibos would make a significant contribution to the dietary intake of polyphenols. The manganese content of a yerba mate infusion (360 – 2985 µg/ 200 ml) would provide 39. 7 – 60. 8 % for men and 57. 1 – 86. 2 % for women of the World Health Organisation (WHO) adequate daily intake of manganese.

In a typical experiment, 12.5 mmol citric acid and 10 mmol iron nitrate were dissolved in 50 ml distilled water. The solution was ultrasonic agitated for about 10 min after adding 8 ml ethanol. Then the pH value of the solution was adjusted to 5 to approximately 6 by ammonia.

In fact, as indicated in the latest Waste Framework Directive, the best option to deal with waste is not to generate it at all. In this framework, the distribution of <b>loose</b> dry food <b>products</b> through self-dispensing systems (so-called “loose distribution”) is being considered worldwide as a practice to reduce the generation of packaging waste. This life cycle assessment (LCA) evaluates the environmental convenience of the loose distribution of dry pasta, breakfast cereals, and rice, {{in comparison with the}} traditional method of distribution. For each product, several baseline scenarios based on single-use packaging were compared with different waste prevention scenarios in which the <b>product</b> is distributed <b>loose.</b> The comparison addressed waste generation, 13 impact categories on the environment and human health, and the Cumulative Energy Demand (CED) indicator. The results are significantly different for the 3 <b>products.</b> The <b>loose</b> distribution of pasta allows a 50 % waste reduction and a decrease in the potential impacts only when compared with single-use cartonboard boxes. Conversely, when the comparison is made with single-use polypropylene bags, the loose distribution can even cause an increase in waste generation (up to 15 %) and in the potential life cycle impacts. For breakfast cereals, the loose distribution allows a significant reduction in both the amount of waste (up to 84 %) and the potential impacts, compared to the sale of traditional single-use bag-in-box packages. Finally, the loose distribution of rice permits a reduction in both waste generation (up to 86 %) and most of the potential impacts. In particular, the impact reduction is higher when the reference single-use packaging that is replaced includes a cartonboard box.

40|$|As {{part of the}} National Agricultural Innovation Project (NAIP), a makhana {{value chain}} study was {{organized}} in Bihar, in collaboration between the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) in Patna, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), as makhana {{is one of the}} core crops that the NAIP project in Bihar is focusing on. Primary surveys were fielded with producers, traders, processors, and retailers in 2009 and 2010 on the rural-urban makhana value chain in Bihar, more in particular from the disadvantaged districts part of the NAIP project (Darbhanga) to urban consumers in Patna. The most salient findings are presented below. Upstream. First, the average number of ponds cultivated by a makhana cultivator is 2. While almost half of the farmers only cultivate makhana in one pond, 13 % of the households reported to cultivate more than 3 ponds. The average pond area cultivated per household is 4. 8 acres. The average production per household in 2009 was 3. 1 tons or about 635 kgs per acre. Second, 27 % of the producers evaluated that the quality of seeds deteriorated during drying. Of these, all believed that the quality of pop would have been better if processed earlier. More {{than a quarter of the}} producers thus seemingly suffered losses because of late processing. Third, almost all the respondents agree with the statement that you have to be a family of the secretary of the fisherman’s cooperative society as to be able to obtain a lease to a government pond. This is important given that rates for these government ponds are often leased much below market rates. An average lease is for 3 years but the majority of the farmers agree that in the case that leases are longer, makhana production would increase because of more investments in the ponds. Fourth, the average production of makhana seeds per pond was about 18 % lower than the expected harvest level during the cultivation period, possibly driven by incidences of floods and droughts as 12 % of ponds were reported to have suffered from floods and another 12 % from droughts. Improved technology adoption is happening as transplanting is now widely used and more than three-quarters of the cultivators indicate that they practice transplanting of the makhana seedlings (in contrast with broadcasting). Fifth, the NAIP project, through the Research Centre for Makhana, is heavily involved in not only improving makhana cultivation but also to extend better alternative income generating activities related to the pond as these can be important for the livelihoods of these farmers. Almost 40 % of the makhana cultivators indicate that they also cultivate fish on top of makhana in their ponds. 8 % reported that they grow fruit trees on the boundaries of the makhana ponds. Sixth, an average transaction at the farm level concerns 1. 2 tons of makhana sold for a total value of 62, 458 Rs (about 1, 400 USD). Most of the makhana sold by farmers is marketed under the form of makhana seeds (55 % of the transactions). Most of the sales of makhana happen in a short-time period and it seems that few farmers store makhana as to benefit from the (potentially) higher prices that might be offered in the off-season. In contrast with conventional wisdom, input advances are not very important as in only 3 % of the transactions, input advances were reported to have been given by the buyer of the produce. Despite our efforts to field our surveys in areas where the processing company, Shakti Sudha Industries, were active, only 0. 3 % of the transactions were reported to have been done with them. Midstream. First, 96 % of the interviewed wholesalers report that they are currently selling branded and packed products. Branded products now account for almost half of their total sales. This compares to only 23 % five years ago. Second, wholesalers involved in low-cost brands estimate that if the products that were in the bags were sold loose, they would only be able to obtain a price that is on average 15 Rs lower than when bagged. However, some wholesalers indicated that these products were not comparable as the quality of products that go in the branded bags is low and could not be sold loose. Third, despite a large number of interactions with the high-cost brand, Sudha Shakti Industries, as well as with key informants in several of their supposed production areas, only a handful of people could be identified that had direct linkages with the company. It thus seems that their direct procurement model has (mostly) fallen apart in recent years (and they might procure part of their products from traders). Downstream. First, quality is rewarded in retail markets and the price results show that the lava quality (the highest pop quality) is rewarded with a premium of between 7 % and 11 % in the market place, compared to a mixed quality. Second, significant rewards further exist to branding and packing in retail markets. Packaged products are sold at prices that are 9 % higher and branding adds another 9 % on top of this. Third, the high-cost brand has been successful in opening new markets that did not exist before. Because of the increasing product demand, it is thus important such initiatives are further encouraged. The value chain as a whole. Farmers in production areas receive about 55 % of the final retail price in Patna, in the case that makhana is sold loose. As there are no benefits to the farmer of the branding process, this share declines to 50 % in the case of the final price for branded products. In both cases, farmers are thus the agent in the value chain that gets most of the rewards, reflecting also most of his effort for the product. The retail margin is the second most important component in the final price, accounting for 19 % and 22 % in the final retail price of <b>loose</b> and branded <b>products</b> respectively. Processors and urban wholesalers count for equal shares in the final retail price. Way forward. The research indicates to several policy implications. First, it might indicate the importance of regulatory institutions and effective implementations of those as well as independent certification mechanisms. Several claims done by branding and packing institutions in Bihar are clearly false, i. e. claims are made about export quality while no export quality grades exist; claims are made about approval by research organizations while no such approvals exist; claims are made by the largest branding company on backward linkages while few of such backward linkages exist in practice. The lack of a consumer protection body or any effective regulations in this area leads thus to mis-information of consumers. Second, there are major differences with branding practices in other sectors and countries. No information on the manufacturers is available on the packing of the branding companies implying that companies are not accountable for their products given consumers can not trace back deficient products in the case of defaults. We also find that the quality of branded products, especially for the low-cost brands, is often lower than <b>loose</b> <b>products</b> in these transitional markets. In contrast with regular branding practices, a significant number of brands thus try to hide bad quality inside. Brands in this setting in India thus seemingly have little function except the packing function and signal little credible information to the consumer on other characteristics of the product. While there is little role for the public sector on this, it seems possible that most of these branding practices might disappear over time as consumers become more demanding and informed. Third, no improved varieties of makhana are currently available and the Indian research institute has only recently tried to set up research as to develop improved makhana varieties. Given the important market opportunities that exist and given that makhana is mostly grown by poor and vulnerable households in flood-prone production areas, there seems to be an important positive, and pro-poor, return to public investments in the development of improved varieties for pond cultivation. Fourth, due to the increased demand, makhana cultivation has endogenously diffused to flooded ricefields in the off-season. This might involve important new opportunities for increased production and seasonal income smoothening for rice farmers situated in these flooded areas. As most research has until now focused on pond cultivation, it thus seems important to better understand these systems and develop improved technologies for these types of production environments taking into account their specific constraints. Fifth, leasing arrangements seem to be hampered by important governance problems and the implementation of better auctions systems and longer leases seem called for as to ensure transparency in the allocations of these leases as well as to ensure better investments because of more secure property rights towards higher productivity of the ponds. ...|$|R
40|$|Alternative {{cultivation}} {{practices such}} as organic and integrated farming are generally proposed {{as a mean to}} reduce environmental impacts associated with food production and consumption. For the same reason, various schemes of direct sale or distribution of local agricultural products have been increasingly developed as an alternative to large-scale distribution of nationally or globally sourced products. However, for a variety of vegetable crops such as salads and leaves, there is few scientific evidence about the relative environmental performance of alternative farming techniques. Similarly, alternative distribution systems have mainly been investigated only in terms of their energy and climate change performance, and mostly within the debate on domestic/local versus imported/delocalised food supply. In this paper, life cycle assessment (LCA) was used to compare the potential environmental impacts of two agricultural supply chains, with the primary aim of testing the expected benefits of vegetable organic farming and of alternative forms of distribution promoting packaging reduction and a shortened supply chain. Organic and integrated production of endive (Cichorium endivia) in Lombardia (northern Italy) were firstly compared, according to a cradle-to-farm gate approach. The comparison was then extended to the whole supply chain, considering the direct distribution of raw organic endive to local networks of ethical purchasing groups by means of returnable crates, and the large-scale retailing of conventional endive as a ready-to-use product after its industrial cutting, washing and packing. Fourteen environmental and human health impact categories were considered as terms of comparison, along with the cumulative energy demand. Results revealed that none of the examined farming techniques has a better overall environmental profile. In fact, when impacts are expressed per hectare of cultivated area, nearly half impact categories (7 / 15) are favourable to organic farming, with impact reductions ranging from 13 % to 55 %. However, organic fertilisation practices are responsible for higher impacts of this cultivation form in terms of acidification (+ 16 %), terrestrial eutrophication (+ 32 %) and non-carcinogenic human toxicity (+ 127 %). Per kg of harvested product, impact categories favourable to organic farming are reduced to five, while six are favourable to integrated farming (which achieves higher yields). Organic farming techniques thus need to be further improved in terms of fertilisation practices and achievable yields in order to achieve a more sustainable production system. Considering the whole supply chain, the direct distribution of the raw organic <b>product</b> <b>loose</b> at the local level is preferable for all impact categories except one, where the impact of the farming stage is dominant and against organic production. This exception however disappears if farming is excluded from the comparison (i. e. only distribution and consumption are considered). Observed reductions in overall supply chain impacts range mostly between 20 % and 48 % and are mainly enabled by the absence of disposable packaging items and industrial processing...|$|R
40|$|Intense {{pollution}} {{of the environment}} by xenobiotic chemicals continuously released into the biosphere {{has been one of}} the biggest concerns for science in the second part of the twentieth century. Several types of industrial and agricultural wastes contain phenols. Many of these compounds and their derivatives are extremely harmful because they are highly toxic towards living organisms and represent a serious environmental problem. Conventional methods of remediation of phenol-polluted systems (e. g. solvent extraction, chemical oxidation, adsorption on activated supports, etc.) have some disadvantages due to high cost, time-consuming procedures and formation of toxic residues. Conversely, the use of enzymatic oxidative catalysts is a promising alternative technology to address the clean up of such a waste. Oxideductases catalyze several biochemical transformations. Among them, laccases have received a great attention because of their possible role in the detoxification of polluted environments, and as catalysts in several applications. They are classified as polyphenoloxidases, i. e. enzymes capable to oxidize a reduced substrate and to start a polymerization process. Laccases, mainly from fungal origins, are capable to degrade and/or to transform various pollutants into safer products. The potential of these enzymes as decontaminating agents of polluted environments has been verified in studies performed with a large range of xenobiotic substances, representative of pollutants from different origins. Several compounds (substituted phenols, anilines, non phenolic substances) have been partly or totally transformed in polymeric aggregates of different nature and size. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the catalytic efficiency of the enzymes towards less-reactive compounds can be greatly improved by additives, which behave as enhancing co-substrates. By contrast, other compounds, eventually present along with the target pollutants, may exhibit not negligible inhibitory effects. Moreover, experiments direct at evaluating the residual activity of the involved enzymes have indicated that some enzyme molecules may be entrapped or adsorbed into the polymeric <b>products,</b> <b>loosing</b> to some extent their activity. The use of whole plants and/or their root exudates as sources of laccases have been also proposed as an effective tool to deal with the detoxification of phenolic polluted wastes. The ability of these detoxifying agents can be greatly magnified by their expression in a greater extend by metabolic engineering applications. However, plant laccases are much less effective than laccases produced by bacteria and fungi in their oxidative activity on phenols. The efficiency of various laccases, purified from fungal sources, in the detoxification of either simulated or natural phenolic-polluted waters as well as their possible practical applications in polluted soil will be addresses. Furthermore, attempts to express a fungal phenoloxidase (POXC) in tobacco plants were successful, after gene transfer mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The poxC gene expression was ascertained by Western blot and its activity was checked by appropriate chemical reactions using ABTS as substrate. It has been also shown that the heterologous laccase is released by root exudates into the culture medium, thus giving rise to a new tobacco genotype useful for soil remediation...|$|R
40|$|Aim of {{this paper}} is to obtain a better {{definition}} of the stratigraphic succession of the M. Facito fm. that is the oldest part of the Lagonegro Mesozoic basin in Southern Apennines (Italy). Seismic data show that the Lagonegro succession overthrusted the western part of the Apulian Carbonate Platform and so the M. Facito fm. appears as a broken formation composed by a variety of different lithofacies. They were partially described by CIARAPICA & PASSERI (2000) in the two other typical areas. This paper, therefore, contribuetes to obtain a complete panorama of the lithofacies contained in the M. Facito fm. a) Calcirudites with fusulinids (Upper Permian). They are known only as scattered boulders and pebbles in tectonic melange and debris. These boulders are interpreted as tectonic shavings coming from melanges and reworked in the postorogenic debris flow. They are the only witness of the Permian in Southern Apennines. b) Capelluzzo lithofacies (Spathian-Aegean). It consists of black calcilutites, slates and calcarenites with abundant quartz grains. Sedimentary structures allowed us to recognize a coastal environment with offshore facies (thin-bedded black limestones), transition facies (limestones, slates and thin layers of cross-laminated quartz calcarenites) and shore-face facies (amalgamated beds of quartz calcarenites). c) Pietra Maura lithofacies (Anisian p. p.). It is represented by massive limestone with green algae, encrusting organisms, foraminifera and brachiopods. The main outcrops of Pietra Maura and Le Ripe are interpreted as carbonate build-ups. Sometimes they show evidence of exposure on the top. d) Varesano lithofacies (Anisian p. p.). It consists of marls, shales and sandstones. It partially lies by side and partially on the top of the previous lithofacies. The same species of brachiopods are contained in both the Pietra Maura limestone and in the shales and sandstones of Varesano, documenting their same age. Sandstones include quartz-wackes, quartz-psammites and quartz-arenites. In some outcrops they contain beautiful wavy ripples and burrows, but in other places they show turbidites with thick graded beds, flute casts, clay chips and current ripples. Sandstones with wave ripples overlying marls indicate a regressive trend. Turbidites are likely a witness of the successive deepening. e) Bellagamba lithofacies (Ladinian p. p.). This lithofacies marks the birth of the deep-water Lagonegro basin. It contains red nodular limestone (Rosso Ammonitico Auctt.) with very rare ammonites but rich in conodonts (early Fassanian to late Longobardian p. p.), radiolarian chert and true radiolarites. Calcirudites and megabreccias include elements coming from Ladinian build-ups that are not present in the Mt. Facito area but that are well known in other zones as Tempa di Rocca Rossa (Tempa di Rocca Rossa lithofacies, Ladinian p. p.). f) Petina Chiana lithofacies (late Longobardian to early Julian). This lithofacies is characterized by the presence of red shales and thin-bedded calcilutites with radiolarians and thin-shelled pelecypods (filaments). It contains the Ladinian-Carnian boundary and it marks the transition to the overlying Calcari con Selce fm. (Carnian and Norian). Some lithofacies lacking of clear relationships with the previous ones (Lithofacies Incertae Sedis) are also described in this paper. Among them, the Cognone lithofacies, that was settled down in a coastal environment and could be referred to the Anisian. The last subject is devoted to the description of the melange, well developed in the Mt. Facito area. It is possible to distinguish synsedimentary, synorogenic and postorogenic melange. The first one is represented by the Bellagamba lithofacies (radiolarites with calcirudites) that is the expression of the Middle Triassic rifting of the Ionian Ocean. The second one is related to thrust surfaces and it contains shavings of the oldest parts of the Lagonegro succession (Permian limestone and phyllites pebbles) sometimes mixed with Cretaceous elements of the «flysch galestrino fm. ». The third one is very common and it consists of weathering <b>products,</b> <b>loose</b> sediments by mass flow and, sometimes, well cemented fluvial conglomerates. The abundance of melanges in the outcrops of Mt. Facito fm. probably lead to misinterpret it as a unique, huge olistostroma. In our opinion the fragmentary character of this formation is mainly due to tectonic...|$|R
