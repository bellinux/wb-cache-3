2500|$|The [...] "school jumps," [...] or [...] "airs {{above the}} ground," [...] are {{a series of}} higher-level {{classical}} dressage movements where the horse leaves the ground. These include the capriole, courbette, the mezair, the croupade, and <b>levade.</b> None are used in modern competitive dressage, but are performed by horses of various riding academies, including the Spanish Riding School in Vienna, Escola Portuguesa de Arte Equestre in Lisbon, Portugal, and the Cadre Noir in Saumur. [...] Baroque horse breeds such as the Andalusian, Lusitano and Lipizzan are most often trained to perform the [...] "airs" [...] today, in part due to their powerfully conformed hindquarters, which allow them the strength to perform these difficult movements.|$|E
2500|$|Stubbs depicts Whistlejacket {{rising to}} a <b>levade,</b> {{but with his}} head turned towards the viewer, in a pose {{comparable}} {{to a number of}} earlier monumental equestrian portraits, including examples by Rubens and Velázquez, but in these the emphasis is on the rider. [...] Here the horse is alone and in a natural state, producing a [...] "romantic study in solitude and liberty". [...] Like many of Stubbs's other paintings of horses and other animals in the wild, including several versions of a horse attacked by a lion perched on its back, the painting is an early intimation of Romanticism, as well as a challenge to the lowly place animal painting occupied in the hierarchy of genres.|$|E
50|$|The <b>levade</b> {{was first}} {{taught at the}} {{beginning}} of the 20th century, asking the horse to hold a position approximately 30-35 degrees from the ground. Unlike the pesade, which is more of a test of balance, the decreased angle makes the <b>levade</b> an extremely strenuous position to hold, and requires a greater effort from the horse. Therefore, many horses are not capable of a good-quality <b>levade.</b> The <b>levade</b> is also a transition movement between work on the ground and the airs above the ground. Neither of these movements are equivalent to rearing, as they require precise control, excellent balance, and a great deal of strength, and are the product of correct training, rather than resistance from the horse.|$|E
5|$|The mezair: A {{series of}} {{successive}} <b>levades</b> {{in which the}} horse lowers its forefeet to the ground before rising again on hindquarters, achieving forward motion. This movement is no longer used at the Spanish Riding School.|$|R
50|$|In the mezair, {{the horse}} rears up and strikes out with its forelegs. It {{is similar to}} a series of <b>levades</b> with a forward motion (not in place), with the horse {{gradually}} bringing its legs further under himself in each successive movement and lightly touching the ground with the front legs before pushing up again. The mezair was originally called the courbette by the old dressage masters. It is no longer practiced at the Spanish Riding School.|$|R
50|$|With {{his acting}} ability, {{he was often}} chosen to create roles in new operas. He sang in the premieres of Le roi Candaule by Alfred Bruneau (as Gygès); and Le Bon Roi Dagobert (as Dagobert), La Hulla (as Narsès), Deux sous de fleurs by Ralph Benatzky, Mandrin by Joseph Szulc (as Antoine), and the title role in Tarass-Boulba by Marcel Louis Auguste Samuel-Rousseau. Other works of his day he was chosen for {{included}} le Prince Charmant in Louis Aubert’s La Forêt Bleue and Raphael in Charles <b>Levadé’s</b> La Peau de chagrin.|$|R

50|$|The <b>levade</b> is a {{movement}} where the horse is balanced on its haunches at a 45 degree angle from the ground. It requires great control and balance, and is very strenuous.|$|E
5000|$|Renech takes Julien aside, {{away from}} the dining room. Renech tells Julien that he must betray either his father or the boys to satisfy the Nazis' quota of Jews to deport; Renech {{says he does not}} care whom Julien chooses to betray. Julien returns to the dining room. Julien announces that his father has Jewish {{grandparents}} and acknowledges that this means Julien himself is also of Jewish ancestry. <b>Levade</b> understands Julien made this disclosure to protect the boys. The Vichy official explains that Julien does not qualify for deportation as a Jew because he is only [...] Jewish. The German soldiers seize <b>Levade.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Composer Charles-Gaston <b>Levadé</b> {{adapted the}} novel into a four-act lyric comic opera in 1934. Tenor Jean Marny of the Opéra-Comique {{recorded}} an aria from the work, [...] "Reverie de Jacques," [...] on Pathé sapphire disc 3175.|$|E
50|$|Charlotte {{explains}} {{this incident}} to Julien, her main contact in the French Resistance. Julien reassigns her {{to act as}} friend and housekeeper to his father, <b>Levade,</b> {{who lives in a}} large house in the country. <b>Levade</b> has taken two Jewish children, André and Jacob, into his home to hide them after their parents were arrested. It is not clear whether Charlotte recognizes the boys, but the boys recognize her—they were the boys who were playing with flashlights when Charlotte landed by parachute. As time progresses, the film reveals that the parents were deported to a German concentration camp in Nazi-occupied Poland, and the Vichy government is cooperating with the Nazis in the steadily growing oppression of Jews in France.|$|E
50|$|The {{horse is}} asked to enter the pesade or <b>levade</b> from the piaffe, which asks the horse to {{increasingly}} engage its hindquarters, lowering them toward the ground and bringing the hind legs more toward its center of gravity. This gives the viewer {{the impression that the}} horse appears to sink down in back and rise in front. The position is held for a number of seconds, and then the horse quietly puts the forelegs back on the ground and proceeds at the walk, or stands at the halt. The <b>levade</b> is considered to be pinnacle of collection, as the horse carries all weight on the back legs, and has an extreme tucking of the hindquarters and coiling of the loins.|$|E
50|$|He {{sang in the}} premieres of La Peau de Chagrin by Charles <b>Levadé</b> (1929), Le Sicilien by Omer Letorey (1930), Gargantua by Antoine Mariotte (1935), Ginevra by Marcel Bertrand (1942), Guignol by André Bloch (1949), Marion ou La Belle au Tricorne by Pierre Wissmer (1951) and Dolores by Michel-Maurice Levy (1952).|$|E
50|$|He is also {{credited}} {{with the use of}} the pillars (wrongly, for La Noue also has record of using them, as does the Greek Eumenes), and he used them extensively in his training of collection and <b>levade.</b> Additionally, he employed the two-track movements, such as shoulder-in, and voltes to supple the horse.|$|E
50|$|In fact, trained, {{controlled}} movements {{such as the}} <b>levade</b> and the pesade are deliberately {{requested by}} a sophisticated form of collection where a careful, highly balanced rider asks the horse to raise its forequarters {{by a combination of}} riding aids that simultaneously gather the horse onto its hindquarters and lighten it in front.|$|E
5000|$|The {{horses were}} trained to perform a number of airs above the ground (or [...] "sauts d'école") movements, which could enable their riders to escape if surrounded, or to fight more easily. These {{included}} movements such as <b>levade,</b> capriole, courbette, and ballotade. Movements still seen today in competitive dressage include the piaffe, passage, and half-pass.|$|E
5000|$|The pesade and <b>levade</b> are {{the first}} airs taught to the High School horse, and it is from these that all other airs are taught. In the pesade, the horse raises its {{forehand}} {{off the ground and}} tucks the forelegs evenly, carrying all weight on the hindquarters, to form a 45 degree angle with the ground.|$|E
5000|$|Evading French police, Charlotte {{rushed to}} Levade's {{house where she}} hurriedly types {{something}} and takes it to the railroad station where Jews are being loaded into cattle cars. People from the village run alongside the cars, searching for their loved ones. Hearing the boys and <b>Levade</b> {{in one of the}} cattle cars, Charlotte pushes the paper she typed between the boards of the car. Inside the car, <b>Levade</b> takes the document and reads it aloud to the boys. It purports to be a letter from the boys' parents, encouraging them to care for one another, to be careful, to survive, and reminding them of their parents' love. (Much earlier in the film, when Charlotte is interviewed for a position in the SOE, she is asked, [...] "Which is more important: love, hope, or duty?" [...] Charlotte answers, [...] "Hope." [...] Charlotte's fake letter gave the boys the gift of hope.) ...|$|E
50|$|The piaffe was {{originally}} used in battle {{to keep the}} horse focused, warm, and moving, ready to move forward into battle. In modern times, the piaffe is mostly taught as an upper level movement in Classical dressage and as a Grand Prix level movement. Additionally, it is needed to develop the <b>levade</b> and from that, the airs above the ground.|$|E
50|$|The airs {{above the}} ground or school jumps {{are a series of}} higher-level, Haute ecole, {{classical}} dressage movements in which the horse leaves the ground. They include the capriole, the courbette, the mezair, the croupade and the <b>levade.</b> None are typically seen in modern competitive dressage. They are performed by horses of various riding academies such as the Spanish Riding School in Vienna and the Cadre Noir in Saumur, and may be seen in other dressage performances. The <b>levade</b> and courbette are a particular feature of the Doma Menorquina, the riding tradition of the island of Menorca. Horses such as the Andalusian, Lusitano, Lipizzan and Menorquín are the breeds most often trained to perform the airs today, in part due to their powerfully conformed hindquarters, which allow them the strength to perform these difficult movements. There were originally seven airs, many of which were used to build into the movements performed today.|$|E
5000|$|A Vichy {{official}} arrives from Paris to {{work with}} the Germans and local villagers to ensure that their quota for deporting Jews is met. Renech, the village schoolmaster, follows Charlotte. Renech learns that <b>Levade</b> is hiding Jewish children. He threatens Charlotte with reporting the boys to the Nazis unless she agrees to become his [...] "friend". She agrees and promises to meet Renech the following night.|$|E
5000|$|Believing Charlotte betrayed them, Julien confronts her {{the next}} day at his father's house. Soon afterward, German soldiers, with Renech and the Vichy {{official}} from Paris, arrive at Levade's house. They meet in Levade's dining room. The Vichy official asks <b>Levade</b> for his papers, especially for documentation that he is not a Jew, and question him about his Jewish ancestry, about which Renech apparently informed him.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Airs Above the Ground" [...] follows; all {{horses are}} under saddle, but the riders {{do not have}} stirrups. Movements {{performed}} include the <b>levade,</b> capriole and courbette. The performance finishes with the [...] "School Quadrille", consisting of 8 riders working in formation at the walk, trot, and canter, with flying changes, pirouettes, the half pass and the passage. The ride is performed to classical music. Lasting 20 minutes, the School Quadrille of the Spanish Riding School is the longest and most difficult in the world.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "high school" [...] or ''''haute ecole'''' school jumps, {{popularly known}} as the [...] "airs above the ground," [...] include the courbette, capriole, <b>levade,</b> and ballotade. Though these {{movements}} are said to come from when the horse was used in war, in their modern form, it is unlikely the airs were used in actual battle, as all but the Capriole expose the horse's sensitive underbelly to the weapons of foot soldiers, and {{it is more likely}} that they were training exercises used off the battlefield.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} a few times when rearing is {{considered}} acceptable by humans. Rearing may be taught as a trick for circus horses and the like. There are also two movements in classical dressage, the <b>Levade</b> and the Pesade, in which the rider asks the horse to set well back on its hindquarters and raise its front legs off of the ground to varying degrees. However, horses properly trained {{to do any of}} these movements are taught to respond to very specific commands and only raise their forequarters when given the command.|$|E
5000|$|Collected gaits {{are asked}} for in {{dressage}} tests from the mid-levels upward, at the walk, trot, and canter. Additionally, {{a high degree}} of collection is required of the rider in more advanced dressage moves, such as the pirouette, piaffe, and passage. The ultimate level of collection is the <b>levade,</b> in which the horse carries 100% of his weight on his hindquarters. Unlike a rearing horse, the horse's rear legs are well under it, and it can safely support itself in an upright position for a time and then lower itself to the ground under control.|$|E

5000|$|The {{next section}} is the [...] "Work in Hand", {{to show how}} the horses are trained for the school jumps <b>levade,</b> capriole, and courbette, all in-hand. This {{demonstration}} includes work on the diagonal, on the wall and between the pillars. All stallions wear a snaffle bridle, cavesson, side reins, some on short hand rein, some with a short longe. All carry the traditional white saddle of the school. Then one stallion is then worked [...] "On the Long Rein", in which a fully trained Lipizzan performs all the movements it would be asked to do under saddle. In this section, the horse wears a red snaffle bridle and a red shabrack (saddlecloth) with the golden coat of arms of the Austrian Empire.|$|E
50|$|In 1910, Chasles {{arranged}} some of {{the dances}} {{for the production of}} Quo Vadis?, based on the novel of the same name at the Gaîté Lyrique. Three years later, she choreographed the opera Pénélope by Gabriel Fauré for the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées and later in 1913 she worked on a ballet based on Molière's Le Sicilien for Jacques Rouché at the Théâtre des Arts. Chasles’ choreography was unique in that it incorporated historical materials on dance from her private collection of dance-related engravings and documents. In 1923, she arranged a production for charity event based on a Renaissance entertainment featuring music created in the fifteenth century by Charles <b>Lévadé.</b> She prepared a revival of Les Indes galantes by Jean-Philippe Rameau in 1925 for the Opéra-Comique, her last year of choreographing for the Opéra-Comique.|$|E
50|$|The Count-Duke {{looks at}} the viewer, making sure all can witness his feat. The figure is viewed from a low {{viewpoint}} and his torso is turned back, making it look more slender; Olivares had a massive body and was rather clumsy, {{as seen in the}} portraits that Velazquez had done before. The horse raises its front legs, performing a somersault or <b>levade</b> as it looks toward the battlefield. Drawing a diagonal from the hills that {{can be seen in the}} landscape, the composition provides energy to the portraiture; in this dynamism, the work reminds of Rubens. This equestrian portrait differs from those made for the royal family and is believed to have been suggested by Olivares; Velazquez had to take particular care, as Olivares was the highest political office of the court (after the king) and had supported him in his early days as a painter in Madrid.|$|E
5000|$|For {{the best}} {{performance}} by the horse, {{as well as for}} better balance of the rider, the rider must be positioned over the center of balance of the horse. The location of the horse's center of balance depends on a combination of speed and degree of collection. For a standing or quietly walking horse, it is slightly behind the heart girth and below the withers. If a horse is moving at a trot or canter, the center of balance shifts slightly forward, and it moves even more forward when the horse is galloping or jumping. If a horse is highly collected, the center of balance will be farther back, regardless of gait, than if the horse is in an extended frame. For movements such as a rein back or the <b>levade,</b> the center of balance of horse and rider may be further back than at a standstill, due to the shift of weight and balance to the hindquarters of the horse ...|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} line, {{part of the}} PLM Transcévenol, threads its {{way along}} the Gardon valley from Alès to Génolhac to Mende, {{this section of the}} line was approved in 1861 and opened 5 May 1870, and provided the link between Languedoc, Alès and Issoire and Paris. It hosted three express trains. There is still a twice daily local service. From the station at Sainte-Cécile-d'Andorge there is a 1-metre gauge railway to Florac. It is 49 km long. This is known as the TAC. Authorised in 1859, the line was built by the Chemins de Fer Départementaux to bring wooden pit props down to Alés, with some passenger traffic. This amounted to two trains a day. The track is very winding, and climbs to 1024 m to cross the Col de Jalcreste. It closed in 1968. Enthuiasts are restoring it. They run a passenger pulling diesel locomotive on the first section, which includes the Viaduct d'Andorge. Between 1859 and 1867 there was a gravity driven rail line from the mainline at Le <b>Levade,</b> La Grand-Combe to Portes et Sénéchas. This was to serve the mines at La Vernarède. The full wagons descending to the river pulled up the empty wagons by a system of cables. It was the idea of the engineer Paul-Adrien Bourdaloue.|$|E
