40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to develop and test a photovoltaic retinal prosthesis for restoring sight to patients blinded by degenerative retinal diseases. A silicon photodiode array for subretinal stimulation has been fabricated by a silicon-integrated-circuit/MEMS process. Each pixel in the two-dimensional array contains three series-connected photodiodes, which photovoltaically convert pulsed near-infrared light into bi-phasic current to stimulate nearby retinal neurons without wired power connections. The device thickness is chosen to be 30 µm to absorb {{a significant portion of}} light while still being thin enough for subretinal implantation. Active and return electrodes confine current near each pixel and are sputter coated with iridium oxide to enhance charge injection levels and provide a stable neural interface. Pixels are separated by 5 µm wide trenches to electrically isolate them and to allow nutrient diffusion through the device. Three sizes of pixels (280, 140 and 70 µm) with active electrodes of 80, 40 and 20 µm diameter were fabricated. The turn-on voltages of the one-diode, two-series-connected diode and three-series-connected diode structures are approximately 0. 6, 1. 2 and 1. 8 V, respectively. The measured photo-responsivity per diode at 880 nm wavelength is ~ 0. 36 A W− 1, at zero voltage bias and scales with the exposed silicon area. For all three pixel sizes, the reverse-bias dark current is sufficiently low (< 100 pA) for our application. Pixels of all three sizes reliably elicit retinal responses at safe near-infrared <b>light</b> <b>irradiances,</b> with good acceptance of the photodiode array in the subretinal space. The fabricated device delivers efficient retinal stimulation at safe near-infrared <b>light</b> <b>irradiances</b> without any wired power connections, which greatly simplifies the implantation procedure.

50|$|Deferred {{lighting}} (also {{known as}} Light Pre-Pass) is {{a modification of}} the Deferred Shading. This technique uses three passes, instead of two in deferred shading. On first pass over the scene geometry, only the attributes necessary to compute per-pixel <b>lighting</b> (<b>irradiance)</b> are written to the G-Buffer. The screen-space, “deferred” pass then outputs only diffuse and specular lighting data, so a second pass must be made over the scene to read back the lighting data and output the final per-pixel shading. The apparent advantage of deferred lighting is a dramatic reduction {{in the size of}} the G-Buffer. The obvious cost is the need to render the scene geometry twice instead of once. An additional cost is that the deferred pass in deferred lighting must output diffuse and specular irradiance separately, whereas the deferred pass in deferred shading need only output a single combined radiance value.|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{gas phase}} toluene was {{degraded}} as model contaminant in an annular LED-based photocatalytic reactor under various <b>light</b> <b>irradiance</b> and illumination modes {{as a means}} to enhance the efficiency in illumination. The effect of controlled periodic illumination was first studied by exploring the effect of the duty cycle and the period and compared to continuous illumination at equivalent <b>light</b> <b>irradiance.</b> Controlled periodic illumination is based on the hypothesis that introducing photons in an alternate fashion rather than continuously avoids the buildup of charges and consequently, diminishes electron-hole recombination. The results show that under a kinetic-limited regime, there is no difference between the conversion of toluene under controlled periodic illumination and continuous illumination at equivalent average irradiance. Consequently, the photonic efficiency for controlled periodic illumination and continuous illumination at equivalent irradiance is also the same. Nonetheless, the photonic efficiency diminished with increasing average <b>light</b> <b>irradiance.</b> This behavior is ascribed to increasing electron-hole recombination with increasing duty cycle for controlled periodic illumination and with increasing <b>light</b> <b>irradiance</b> for continuous illumination. The second illumination technique investigated was the following of different radiation profiles along the reactor length. The LED array of the annular photoreactor was controlled with five different power supplies, each controlling one-fifth of the reactor length; thus, allowing to test experimentally different <b>light</b> <b>irradiance</b> per section of reactor. It was hypothesized that since at the inlet of the reactor the mass transfer driving force is larger than at the outlet of the reactor, a lower irradiance at the inlet would still yield good toluene conversion {{while at the same time}} decreasing the energy input. Experimentally, both an increasing and decreasing <b>light</b> <b>irradiance</b> profiles were tested and compared to a uniform profile at equivalent <b>light</b> <b>irradiance.</b> The results show that an increasing irradiance profile yielded a slightly higher conversion than uniform illumination; however, the difference was not statistically significant. In addition, a mathematical model of five photocatalytic reactors in series was developed to further explore the effect of following different irradiation profiles. By solving an optimization problem to minimize both the irradiance and outlet concentration of toluene, it was noted that the highest toluene conversion is always achieved under a uniform illumination of the reactor. Finally, this thesis presents the experiments to design the irradiation process control. The effect of relative humidity and toluene inlet concentration perturbations on the degradation of toluene, production of carbon dioxide, and mineralization are also analyzed. The results show that increasing the relative humidity to a certain value will stop catalyst deactivation and will augment the mineralization of toluene. In contrast, an increase in toluene inlet concentration will diminish the mineralization of toluene. Furthermore, a PI feedback controller was designed and validated manually. The feedback controller was able to maintain the conversion of toluene at the set-point at experimental conditions with no perturbations and at experimental conditions with perturbations such as catalyst deactivation, and changes in relative humidity and toluene inlet concentration.

This kinetic parameter did not present statistical differences varying the <b>light</b> <b>irradiance</b> (p > 0.05), but it was statistically different for other photoperiods (p < 0.05).
