5|$|The Rage Against God (subtitle in US editions: How Atheism <b>Led</b> <b>Me</b> <b>to</b> Faith) is {{the fifth}} book by Peter Hitchens, first {{published}} in 2010. The book describes Hitchens's journey from atheism, far-left politics, and bohemianism, to Christianity and conservatism, detailing the influences on him {{that led to his}} conversion. The book is partly intended as a response to God Is Not Great, a book written by his brother Christopher Hitchens in 2007.|$|E
5|$|In 1805, Messrs. Wood and Street, from Richmond, Va., {{found their}} way to Kentucky. Friendly {{considerations}} <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> patronize them. This was done through the solicitations of a young friend from Virginia. They commenced a paper, published in 1806, called the 'Western World.' Imbibing strong prejudices against slavery, perhaps from my mother's repeating, in my infancy, the nurse's songs composed by Cowper, designed to make such impressions. In June 1806, to the great astonishment of my friends, I left Kentucky, with all the flattering prospects a youth could have, and hastened to Ohio. Connecting circumstances, and from hints that fell from Wood and others, a deep impression had been made on my mind, that an eventful period was fast approaching.|$|E
60|$|But I find, sayest thou, {{as if the}} Spirit <b>led</b> <b>me</b> forth <b>to</b> study other matters.|$|R
60|$|He paused, and <b>led</b> <b>me</b> away <b>to</b> {{the farther}} {{end of the}} yard, for the workmen had begun to arrive and to cluster round the dipping trough.|$|R
60|$|We got up, and he <b>led</b> <b>me</b> on <b>to</b> the {{verandah}} which surrounded his house. We {{paused to}} look at the gay flowers that rioted in his garden.|$|R
25|$|God made me {{known to}} you in this town, and <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> offer you affection; nothing can so comfort me as her Majesty's and your favour.|$|E
25|$|This misfortune, {{which for}} a time seemed so bitter and was so hard to bear, {{has proved to be}} a blessing in disguise. The cruel blow which blighted the joys of earth, was the means of turning my eyes to heaven. I might never had known Jesus Christ, had not the sorrow that clouded my early years <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> seek comfort in him.|$|E
25|$|Before I {{experienced}} {{the horror of}} that attack, I was quick to call coward or yellow anyone who showed fear under any circumstances. Nevermore. I don’t know these things, but they speak truth to one. I am not a psychologist, nor a statistician, and less of a philosopher; but the depth of emotion, the dreads of fear, the referees of horrors, and the concentration of self that <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> make this observation, the fear impulse, or perhaps, better said, the (impulses caused) by fear, are stronger, more demanding than either that of love or hunger...|$|E
60|$|He <b>led</b> <b>me</b> up <b>to</b> my {{own little}} chamber, took fresh raiment for me from a press, called Lorenza and bade her bring bread and wine, vinegar and warm water.|$|R
6000|$|He <b>led</b> <b>me</b> out <b>to</b> {{the head}} of the stair. [...] "This {{unexpected}} occurrence," [...] he said, [...] "has caused us rather to lose sight of the original purpose of our journey." ...|$|R
60|$|He <b>led</b> <b>me</b> off <b>to</b> a seat by {{the north}} door, between two pews, very black and silent. There we sat, he putting his gun {{carefully}} beside him. He remained perfectly still, thinking.|$|R
500|$|In the {{introductory}} notes to his sheet music for Trois Gymnopédies, Laucke comments: [...] "The characteristic harmonies {{of much of}} the music of Erik Satie belong to the impressionist period and, though originally written for the piano, are extremely well-suited to the natural idiomatic expression of the guitar. This has <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> make these transcriptions which will enrich the repertoire of the guitar while remaining faithful to Satie's intentions." ...|$|E
500|$|Limbert wrote: [...] "I {{had made}} two trips into the {{northern}} end, covering practically {{the same region}} as that traversed by a Geological Survey party in 1901. My first was a hiking and camping trip with Ad Santel (the wrestler), Dr. Dresser, and Albert Jones; the second was with Wes Watson and Era Martin (ranchers living about four miles [...] from the northern edge). The peculiar features seen on those trips <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> take a third across {{the region in the}} hope that even more interesting phenomena might be encountered." ...|$|E
500|$|The Last Exit {{was also}} notable {{as a popular}} {{destination}} for Seattle's amateur and professional Go and chess players including Peter Biyiasas, Viktors Pupols, and Yasser Seirawan, who wrote of the venue, [...] "Those first chess lessons soon <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the legendary Last Exit on Brooklyn coffee house, a chess haven where an unlikely bunch of unusual people congregates to do battle." [...] Interviewed by Sports Illustrated in 1981, Seirawan described the Last Exit as [...] "Scrabble players, backgammon players, chess and game hustling... This became my home. This was to become my family." ...|$|E
60|$|We re-entered the Gallery. The {{majority}} of the Royal party were busy examining the miniatures. The Archduchess was talking earnestly to Lady Delahaye in a remote corner. My guide <b>led</b> <b>me</b> directly <b>to</b> her.|$|R
60|$|Abdelm. I see you are {{amazed that}} I am here: But let at once your fear and wonder end. In the usurper's guards I found a friend, Who <b>led</b> <b>me</b> safe <b>to</b> {{you in this}} disguise.|$|R
60|$|He <b>led</b> <b>me</b> resistlessly <b>to</b> the seat, {{away from}} {{the noise of the}} regimental band and the dancers, and then sat himself down at the far end from me, like a great surly bear that he was.|$|R
500|$|Author Katherine V. Forrest claimed Bannon and {{her books}} [...] "are {{in a class}} by themselves" [...] and credits Bannon with saving her life, writing in 2005, [...] "Overwhelming need <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> walk a {{gauntlet}} of fear up to the cash register. Fear so intense that I remember nothing more, only that I stumbled out of the store in possession of what I knew I must have, a book as necessary to me as air... I found it when I was eighteen years old. It opened the door to my soul and told me who I was." ...|$|E
500|$|Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives was an {{influential}} album for contemporary musicians Amon Tobin and Nick Sanborn of Sylvan Esso. Tobin stated that his single [...] "Verbal", from his acclaimed 2002 album Out from Out Where, {{was influenced by}} Prefuse 73. Sanborn spoke {{on the influence of}} Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives, referring to it as one of the records that [...] "gave me a doorway into hip hop. I know it's weird, but he was my entry point into instrumental hip hop, starting a domino effect that <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> Dilla, Madlib and the rest." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first two}} {{decisions}} to interpret § 8 construed {{it not to}} apply to the crimes charged. In United States v. Bevans (1818), the Court held that the § 8 of the Act did not extend to a murder committed on a navy vessel within state waters. In United States v. Palmer (1818), the Court held that the § 8 of the Act did not extend to piracy by U.S. citizen defendants, in the employ of a South American government at war with Spain, committed against Spanish ships and citizens. President John Quincy Adams was a harsh critic of the decision in Palmer. He wrote in his diary that the Court had [...] "cast away the jurisdiction which a law of congress had given, that its [...] "reasoning [...] a sample of judicial logic—disingenuous, false, and hollow," [...] and that it gave him [...] "an early disgust for the practice of law, and <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the unalterable determination never to accept judicial office." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I came {{hoping to}} bring Miss Poynton some good news. I had {{information}} which <b>led</b> <b>me</b> seriously <b>to</b> doubt whether the body {{which has been}} found in the Seine is really her brother's." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “Having implicitly {{rejected}} such {{a conclusion}} in 1986, further {{study of the}} canopic fragments {{as part of my}} general treatment of royal canopics has now <b>led</b> <b>me</b> rather <b>to</b> support the existence of two Shoshenqs with the prenomen Hedjkheperre.” ...|$|R
60|$|As the {{afternoon}} was waning I retraced my steps {{and returned to}} the ranch. The driver boy, whom I had heard called Dick, was looking for me, evidently at Miss Sampson's order, and he <b>led</b> <b>me</b> up <b>to</b> the house.|$|R
500|$|The school’s {{refusal to}} play Ward in the Georgia Tech game later {{became part of}} the public legacy of President Gerald R. Ford. Ward {{recalled}} that he met “my man Jerry” during freshman orientation in 1932, and the two became friends and roommates when the football team traveled for road games. When Ford learned that the school had capitulated to Georgia Tech, some accounts indicate that he [...] "quit the team" [...] or threatened to quit in order [...] "to make a statement and take a stand because Willis Ward was his friend." [...] Ford wrote about the Georgia Tech incident in his autobiography, recalling that he felt the decision to keep Willis out of the game was [...] "morally wrong." [...] “I went to Willis himself. He urged me to play. [...] ‘Look,’ he said, ‘the team’s having a bad year. We’ve lost two games already and we probably won’t win any more. You’ve got to play Saturday. You owe it to the team.’ [...] I decided he was right. That Saturday afternoon, we hit like never before and beat Georgia Tech 9–2.” [...] Years later, Ford wrote that the Ward incident had influenced his thinking about race. Ford noted: “His sacrifice <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> question how educational administrators could capitulate to raw prejudice.” [...] Ford used the story to voice his support for U-M’s affirmative action admissions policy saying, “Do we really want to risk turning back the clock to an era when the Willis Wards were isolated and penalized for the color of their skin, their economic standing or national ancestry?” ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Second, I was {{a student}} of {{economics}} and sociology, reading, observing, meditating, and this <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> Socialism. Socialism is the social order corresponding to truth in the intellect.|$|E
2500|$|As {{he watched}} {{lifeboat}} 10 being loaded, an officer shouted, [...] "Room for two more", {{and a man}} jumped aboard. Hosono saw this and, as he later put it, [...] "the example of the first man making a jump <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> take this last chance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We are {{all black}} beasts, Eugenio," [...] I {{answered}} heavily, and so startled him by words and tone that he ventured upon no further speech, but <b>led</b> <b>me</b> straight <b>to</b> my mother's private dining-room, {{opened the door}} and calmly announced me.|$|R
6000|$|The psychic, {{leaning forward}} slightly, fixed her wide, deep-blue eyes upon him. [...] "The maid {{conducted}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the room {{which had been}} your wife's, but I could not stay there. This lady who stands beside you took me {{by the hand and}} <b>led</b> <b>me</b> away <b>to</b> another room. She is nodding at me now." ...|$|R
6000|$|Heaven {{pardon the}} rich people of Paris {{who might have}} {{preserved}} my virtue at so small a cost! Heaven grant <b>me</b> courage <b>to</b> follow the better path into which its mercy has <b>led</b> <b>me,</b> and <b>to</b> persevere in a life of penitence and devotion {{to the end of}} my days! ...|$|R
2500|$|Others come to {{different}} conclusions. In 2006, veteran black project watcher and aviation writer Bill Sweetman said, [...] "Does Aurora exist? Years of pursuit have <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> believe that, yes, Aurora {{is most likely}} in active development, spurred on by recent advances that have allowed technology {{to catch up with}} the ambition that launched the program a generation ago." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although he {{was soon}} {{released}} and returned to Baltimore, Almeida was left without a livelihood and was marked by the experience {{and the desire for}} revenge by the simple desire of wealth, which marked his career from that time on: [...] "the hatred that burned in my abuse and the loss of my private property <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> enlist in the South American service".|$|E
2500|$|As a child Baggott had {{the normal}} curiosity of {{wondering}} {{how the world}} worked. He {{was very interested in}} [...] "how stuff came to be". Baggott told science writer Brian Clegg that the reason why he went into the sciences was because he had some great schoolteachers. He loved physics but did not think he had a strong enough talent for the mathematics that would be required. [...] "That said, my desire to seek explanations for things <b>led</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> chemical physics and it was with a great sense of pride and pleasure that I did manage to publish some entirely theoretical research papers, full of mathematical equations!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't do it," [...] he said, {{checking}} himself. [...] "This tunnel {{may have}} <b>led</b> <b>me</b> back <b>to</b> the other mine, {{and if the}} people ahead {{are some of the}} night shift they'll be likely to have considerable sport at my expense." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You don't feel one grain for me, Ethel,' said Gertrude, {{with tears}} in her eyes. 'Only think how Tom <b>led</b> <b>me</b> on <b>to</b> say horrid things about the Wards; and now to {{recollect}} them, when she is so ill too--and he--' She burst into sobs.|$|R
60|$|That trail <b>led</b> <b>me</b> back <b>to</b> the hunter's cabin, to the miner's shack {{on whose}} {{rough-hewn}} walls the fire-light flickered {{in a kind}} of silent music. It set me once again in the atmosphere of daring and filled me with the spirit of pioneer adventure.|$|R
