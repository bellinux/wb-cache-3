In the context of social media such as Twitter, users can opt to be silent all or most of the time. They are often called the invisible participants or <b>lurkers.</b> As <b>lurkers</b> contribute little to the online content, existing analysis often overlooks their presence and voices. However, we argue that understanding <b>lurkers</b> is important in many applications such as recommender systems, targeted advertising, and social sensing. This research therefore seeks to characterize <b>lurkers</b> in social media and propose methods to profile them. We examine 18 weeks of tweets generated by two Twitter communities consisting of more than 110 K and 114 K users respectively. We find that there are many <b>lurkers</b> in the two communities, and the proportion of <b>lurkers</b> in each community changes with time. We also show that by leveraging <b>lurkers</b> 2 ̆ 7 neighbor content, we are able to profile them with accuracy comparable to that of profiling active users.

50|$|<b>Lurkers</b> {{experience}} less belonging in {{a community}} compared to regular contributors. They are less satisfied and experience more distractions. This means that <b>lurkers</b> are predisposed to leave before making a contribution because they lack the motivation that belonging and satisfaction bring. In the case of social networking websites, <b>lurkers</b> experience less intimacy and personal well-being. <b>Lurkers</b> in Facebook can experience loneliness as they watch other, more social {{members of the community}} participate.|$|R

50|$|Today <b>lurkers</b> {{are viewed}} both {{positively}} and negatively. In many communities <b>lurkers</b> are still seen as free-riders. They {{are perceived as}} a drain on the public goods since they “take without giving back.” However, some communities encourage newbies to lurk.By lurking, newbies {{can learn more about}} the culture of the community, understand the community’s social norms, and become familiar with the key members of the community. <b>Lurkers</b> are also viewed positively in present-day communities because they provide an audience for the mass media. The presence of <b>lurkers</b> is often the justification for receiving advertising support.|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we focus}} on {{participants}} called <b>lurkers,</b> who do not post any messages in an online community such as interactive mailing lists and bulletin board systems. We propose a method of classifying participants including <b>lurkers</b> based on two criteria: what types of actions they take outside the online community, {{and whether or not}} the online community affects their thoughts. In addition, {{based on the results of}} interviews, we propose hypotheses regarding factors that characterize the categories of <b>lurkers.</b> We conduct a questionnaire survey of all participants in two in-house online communities to verify our method and test the hypotheses. There are a considerable number of <b>lurkers</b> who have a strong and wide influence outside the online community.

50|$|Different {{factors in}} the {{community}} can influence the lurking behavior within that community. The amount of lurking within a community is correlated with {{the topic of the}} community, the size of the community, and the amount of traffic within the community. The number of <b>lurkers</b> is nearly double in technical support groups compared to health support groups. The nature of the topic may be responsible for the difference in the number of <b>lurkers.</b> The number of members in the community can also affect the amount of lurking that takes place. As the number of members in a group rises, the percentage of <b>lurkers</b> also rises. Within a given group size, the groups with higher traffic tend to have a lower percentage of <b>lurkers.</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose This paper {{reports on}} {{research}} investigating {{the benefits of}} membership of the online community LiveJournal, for both active and non-active participants (<b>lurkers).</b> It builds upon and develops previous research on this topic in a new context and presents some alternative perspectives on how lurking is understood by both active participants and <b>lurkers</b> themselves. Methodology Data was gathered using a online questionnaire made available to members of two different LiveJournal communities. Findings The data indicates that both active participants and <b>lurkers</b> receive similar benefits from their membership of LiveJournal, {{in terms of their}} sense of community and satisfactions with experience of the community. The percentage of <b>lurkers</b> who felt a sense of community and high levels of satisfaction was lower than that of the respondents who posted regularly to the community, but nonetheless represented the majority of the <b>lurkers.</b> The majority of overall respondents said that <b>lurkers</b> are members of the community in contrast to earlier research in this area. Social implications The research contributes {{to our understanding of the}} fast-developing world of online communities, including individuals' reasons for joining and participating in communities. Originality The research builds upon earlier research in a new context; the findings present a different, developing our understanding of how non-active participants are viewed as part of the community of LiveJournal.

Yes, he said; at different times of the night, three. One lived in Fountain Court, and the other two lived in the Lane, and he had seen them all go home. Again, the only other man who dwelt in the house of which my chambers formed a part had been in the country for some weeks, and he certainly had not returned in the night, because we had seen his door with his seal on it as we came up-stairs.|$|E

Yet the New Zealand owl-parrot is, to put it plainly, a lory which has assumed all the outer appearance and habits of an owl. A <b>lurker</b> in the twilight or under the shades of night, burrowing for its nest in holes in the ground, it has dingy brown plumage like the owls, with an undertone of green to bespeak its parrot origin: while its face is entirely made up of two great disks, surrounding the eyes, which succeed in giving it a most marked and unmistakable owl-like appearance.|$|E

40|$|Even in busy online {{communities}} usually {{only a small}} fraction of members post messages. Why do so many people prefer not to contribute publicly? From an online survey that generated 1188 responses from posters and <b>lurkers</b> from 375 MSN bulletin board communities, 219 <b>lurkers</b> spoke out about their reasons for not posting. While <b>lurkers</b> did not participate publicly, they did seek answers to questions. However, lurkers’ satisfaction with their community experience was lower than those who post. Data from 19 checkbox items and over 490 open-ended responses were analyzed. From this analysis the main reasons why <b>lurkers</b> lurk were concerned with: not needing to post; needing to find out more about the group before participating; thinking that they were being helpful by not posting; not being able to make the software work (i. e., poor usability); and not liking the group dynamics or the community was a poor fit for them. Two key conclusions can be drawn from this analysis. First, there are many reasons why people lurk in online discussion communities. Second, and most important, most <b>lurkers</b> are not selfish free-riders. From these findings it is clear that there are many ways t...|$|R

50|$|<b>Lurkers</b> lurk {{rather than}} {{participate}} {{for a variety}} of reasons. A majority of <b>lurkers</b> profess that they lurk simply because they think that browsing is enough for them. Users also choose to lurk in order to find examples to follow when they decide to participate, avoid making redundant posts or contributions, and learn more about the topics of conversation. A <b>lurker’s</b> need to learn about the community before contributing also explains why almost twice as many users lurk on technical support communities where more information is required to post as compared to health support communities. Researchers have shown that different motivations underlie reading, contributing, and moderating web forums.
