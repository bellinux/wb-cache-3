25|$|A single {{draught horse}} can {{normally}} pull a single-furrow plough in clean <b>light</b> <b>soil,</b> but in heavier soils two horses are needed, one {{walking on the}} land {{and one in the}} furrow. For ploughs with two or more furrows more than two horses are needed and, usually, one or more horses have to walk on the loose ploughed sod– and that makes hard going for them, and the horse treads the newly ploughed land down. It is usual to rest such horses every half-hour for about ten minutes.|$|E
25|$|From the beginning, {{there were}} {{tensions}} {{between those who}} wanted to use the rivers for navigation and {{those who wanted to}} use them for drainage, to the extent that when Denver Sluice was demolished by an extremely high tide in 1713, the towns of Cambridge and Thetford petitioned against its reconstruction. However, a more serious problem for the Burnt Fen area was the steady shrinkage of the land surface as the water was removed from the peat soils, and the blowing away of the <b>light</b> <b>soil</b> as it dried out. Water could no longer flow by gravity from the land into the rivers. Although the Bedford Level Corporation was responsible for the main rivers in the region, they did not have control of the smaller tributaries. Landowners could and did build windmills to act as drainage engines, but there was no overall policy, with the result that there were legal disputes, with one landowner complaining that a neighbour's drainage mill resulted in flooding of surrounding properties.|$|E

25|$|The {{share is}} {{the cutting edge}} of the {{moldboard}} plow. The share makes the horizontal cut that separates the furrow slice from the soil below and when it is worn it is important to fit a new one. Conventional shares have points that are shaped. This shape, which was developed through years of field experience, penetrates ordinary soil efficiently and stands rough use. The share is shaped so that it pulls itself into the ground. As the share wears away, it becomes blunt and the plough will require more power to pull it through the soil. A plough body with a worn share will not have enough 'suck' to ensure that it penetrates the ground to its full working depth. The tip of the share is pointed downward, causing the plow to run into the ground. This is called “suction or down suck”; it literally sucks the plow into the ground, to a regulated depth. The clearance, also usually referred to as “suction or down suck”, varies with different makes and types of plows (the related clearance at the side is called “land suck”). Its configuration is related to soil type, particularly in the down suction, or concavity, of its lower surface. Generally, three degrees of clearance or down suction are recognized: regular for <b>light</b> <b>soil,</b> deep for ordinary dry soil, and double-deep for clay and gravelly soils. In addition, the share has horizontal suction, which is related to the amount its point is bent out of line with the landside. Down suction causes the plow to penetrate to proper depth when pulled forward, while horizontal suction causes the plow to create the desired width of furrow. The share is a plane part with trapezoidal shape. It cuts the soil horizontally and lifts it. Common types are regular, winged-plane, bar-point, and share with mounted or welded point. The regular share conserves a good cut but is recommended on stone-free soils. The winged-plane share is used on heavy soil with a moderate amount of stones. The bar-point share can be used in extreme conditions (hard and stony soils). The use of the share with mounted point is somewhere between the last two types. Manufacturers have designed shares of various shapes (trapezium, diamond, etc.) with bolted point and wings, often separately renewable. Sometimes the share cutting edge is placed well in advance of the moldboard to reduce the pulverizing action of the soil.|$|E

Grain grown upon the stiff black loam withstood the drought, but the <b>light</b> <b>soil</b> of the Marston farm was lifted by the wind, and the sharp sand in it abraded the tender stalks.

60|$|The {{roads of}} Otsego, if we except the {{principal}} high ways, were, {{at the early}} day of our tale, but little better than wood-paths. The high trees that were growing on the very verge of the wheel-tracks excluded the sun’s rays, unless at meridian; and the slowness of the evaporation, united with the rich mould of vegetable decomposition that covered the whole country to the depth of several inches, occasioned but an indifferent foundation for the footing of travellers. Added to these were the inequalities of a natural surface, and the constant recurrence of enormous and slippery roots that were laid bare by {{the removal of the}} <b>light</b> <b>soil,</b> together with stumps of trees, to make a passage not only difficult but dangerous. Yet the riders among these numerous obstructions, which were such as would terrify an unpracticed eye, gave no demonstrations of uneasiness as their horses toiled through the sloughs or trotted with uncertain paces along the dark route. In many places the marks on the trees were the only indications of a road, with perhaps an occasional remnant of a pine that, by being cut close to the earth, so as to leave nothing visible but its base of roots, spreading for twenty feet in every direction, was apparently placed there as a beacon to warn the traveller that it was the centre of a highway.|$|E
40|$|This present paper, {{focused on}} root crop {{communities}} of <b>light</b> <b>soils,</b> {{is a part}} of the wide range characteristics of segetal communities of the Podlaski Przełom Bugu (Podlasie Bug River Gorge) mesoregion. On the basis of 160 phytosociological relevés made according to the Braun-Blanquet method, phytocenoses representing the Panico-Setarion alliance were distinguished. Most often, patches of the association Echinochloo-Setarietum were recorded in the study area. Heterogeneous habitat conditions affect its floristic diversity. Two subassociations of the phytocenosis, divided according to the species composition into 9 lower syntaxa, were identified on <b>light</b> <b>soils.</b> The following subassociations were distinguished: Echinochloo-Setarietum setarietosum glaucae in a typical variant and a variant with Juncus bufonius, both with subvariants with Digitaria ischaemum, as well as a typical variant of Echinochloo-Setarietum typicum, a variant with Juncus bufonius and a subvariant with Oxalis stricta in the typical and wet variant. Another association found in root crops on <b>light</b> <b>soils</b> of the Podlaski Przełom Bugu mesoregion is Digitarietum ischaemi. Its patches were observed in cultivations on <b>light,</b> acidic, poor <b>soils.</b> The characteristic feature of this community is the occurrence of numerous acidophilous species. In habitat conditions typical for the Podlaski Przełom Bugu mesoregion, Digitarietum ischaemi is differentiated into the typical and wet variant. Quite frequent patches of the Setaria pumila-Setaria viridis community were noted in intermediate habitat conditions, between those characteristic for Digitarietum ischaemi and Echinochloo-Setarietum...|$|R

6000|$|The season, at {{the precise}} moment when we desire to take the reader with us to Oyster Pond, was in the {{delightful}} month of September, when the earlier promises of the year are fast maturing into performance. Although Suffolk, as a whole, can scarcely be deemed a productive county, being generally of a thin, <b>light</b> <b>soil,</b> and still covered with a growth of small wood, it possesses, nevertheless, spots of exceeding fertility. A considerable portion of the northern prong of the fork has this latter character, and Oyster Pond {{is a sort of}} garden compared with much of the sterility that prevails around it. Plain, but respectable dwellings, with numerous out-buildings, orchards and fruit-trees, fences carefully preserved, a pains-taking tillage, good roads, and here and there a [...] "meeting-house," [...] gave the fork an air of rural and moral beauty that, aided by the water by which it was so nearly surrounded, contributed greatly to relieve the monotony of so dead a level. There were heights in view, on Shelter Island, and bluffs towards Riverhead, which, if they would not attract much attention in Switzerland, were by no means overlooked in Suffolk. In a word, both the season and the place were charming, though most of the flowers had already faded; and the apple, and the pear, and the peach, were taking the places of the inviting cherry. Fruit abounded, notwithstanding the close vicinity of the district to salt water, the airs from the sea being broken, or somewhat tempered, by the land that lay to the southward.|$|E

The Colonel hesitated. Apart from obvious reasons for discomfiture, he had that feeling towards Art common to so many of his caste. It was not work, of course, but it was very clever--a mystery to him how anyone could do it! On seeing him, Lennan had risen, dropping his handkerchief over what he was modelling--but not before the Colonel had received a dim impression of something familiar. The young man was very red--the Colonel, too, was conscious suddenly of the heat. He held out his hand.|$|E

Yields could be improved further, especially in intensive potato-growing regions where irrigation and fertilizing already contribute to a consistently high yield potential in the rather <b>light</b> <b>soils.</b> Different planting distances on individual soil plots were tested in the authors’ own trials.
