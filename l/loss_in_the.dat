40|$|Abstract [...] - The {{inspiration}} {{for the use of}} the resonant inverter shoots from an aspiration to minimise <b>the</b> switching <b>losses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inverter devices. This paper portrays an exhaustive study on <b>losses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> resonant DC link inverter. Equations for accessing <b>the</b> diverse <b>losses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> resonant DC link inverter and a corresponding hard switching inverter are developed. Based on these equations, a design optimization is executed for the DC link inverter to attain the optimum standards of the link components. Finally, an evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>losses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> resonant inverter and the hard switching inverter is presented...|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of the disaster, new safety {{legislation}} was proposed. The local economy declined because the factory was closed down. Imperial intended to rebuild it and return to production by the end of 2008, with replacement buildings to be completed by summer the following year.
