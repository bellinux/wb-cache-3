60|$|We {{arrived at}} Choongtam (for the fourth time) at noon, {{and took up}} our {{quarters}} in a good house near the temple. The autumn and winter flowering plants now prevailed here, such as <b>Labiatae,</b> which are generally late at this elevation; and grasses, which, though rare in the damp forest regions, are so common on these slopes that I here gathered twenty-six kinds. I spent a day here in order to collect seeds of the superb rhododendrons* [These Rhododendrons are now all flourishing at Kew and elsewhere: they are R. Dalhousiae, arboreum, Maddeni, Edgeworthii, Aucklandii and virgatum.] which I had discovered in May, growing on the hills behind.

40|$|Portia is a genus of web-invading araneophagic (spider eating) jumping spiders {{known from}} earlier studies to derive aggressive-mimicry signals {{by using a}} {{generate-and-test}} (trial and error) algorithm. We studied individuals of Portia <b>labiata</b> from two populations (Los Baños and Sagada) in the Philippines that have previously been shown to differ in the level to which they rely on trial-and-error derivation of signals for prey capture (Los Baños relied on trial and error more strongly than Sagada P. <b>labiata).</b> Here we investigated P. <b>labiata’s</b> use {{of trial and error}} in a novel situation (a confinement problem: how to escape from an island surrounded by water) that is unlikely to correspond closely to anything the spider would encounter in nature. During Experiment 1, spiders chose between two potential escape tactics (leap or swim), one of which was set at random to fail (brought spider no closer to edge of tray) and the other of which was set for partially succeeding (brought spider closer to edge of tray). By using trial and error, the Los Baños P. <b>labiata</b> solved the confinement problem significantly more often than the Sagada P. <b>labiata</b> in Experiment 1, both when the correct choices were positively reinforced (i. e., when the spider was moved closer to edge of tray) and when incorrect choices were punished (i. e., when the spider got no closer to edge of tray). In Experiment 2, the test individual’s first choice was always set to fail, and P. <b>labiata</b> was given repeated opportunities to respond to feedback, yet the Sagada P. <b>labiata</b> continued to place little reliance on trial and error for solving the confinement problem. That the Los Baños P. labiat a relied more strongly on trial-anderror problem solving than the Sagada P. <b>labiata</b> has now been demonstrated across two different tasks...|$|R
60|$|There is {{a closely}} {{analogous}} subdivision of plants, including the genus Muscari (or Feather Hyacinth) and the allied Bellevalia, which bear both perfect flowers and closed bud-like bodies that never expand. The latter resemble {{in this respect}} cleistogamic flowers, but differ widely from them in being sterile and conspicuous. Not only the aborted flower-buds and their peduncles (which are elongated apparently through the principle of compensation) are brightly coloured, {{but so is the}} upper part of the spike--all, no doubt, for the sake of guiding insects to the inconspicuous perfect flowers. From such cases as these we may pass on to certain <b>Labiatae,</b> for instance, Salvia Horminum in which (as I hear from Mr. Thiselton Dyer) the upper bracts are enlarged and brightly coloured, no doubt for the same purpose as before, with the flowers suppressed.|$|E
6000|$|Nine other orders, Geraniaceæ, Rhamnaceæ, Rosaceæ, Myrtaceæ, Primulaceæ, Loganiaceæ, Liliaceæ, Thymelaceæ, and Cucurbitaceæ, {{have six}} or seven species each; and among the more {{important}} orders which have less than five species each are Ranunculaceæ, Cruciferæ, Vaccinacæ, Apocynaceæ, Boraginaceæ, Scrophulariaceæ, Polygonaceæ, Orchidaceæ, and Juncaceæ. The most remarkable feature here is the great abundance of Lobeliaceæ, a character of the flora which is probably unique; while the superiority of <b>Labiatæ</b> to Leguminosæ and the scarcity of Rosaceæ and Orchidaceæ are also very unusual. Composites, as in most temperate floras, stand {{at the head of}} the list, and it will be interesting to note the affinities which they indicate. Omitting eleven species which are cosmopolitan, and have no doubt entered with civilised man, there remain nineteen genera and seventy species of Compositæ in the islands. Sixty-one of the species are peculiar, as are eight of the genera; while the genus Lipochæta with eleven species is only known elsewhere in the Galapagos, where a single species occurs. We may therefore consider that nine out of the nineteen genera of Hawaiian {325} Compositæ are really confined to the Archipelago. The relations of the peculiar genera and species are indicated in the following table.[77] ...|$|E
60|$|We {{may feel}} sure that {{plants have been}} {{rendered}} heterostyled to ensure cross- fertilisation, for {{we now know that}} a cross between the distinct individuals of the same species is highly important for the vigour and fertility of the offspring. The same end is gained by dichogamy or the maturation of the reproductive elements of the same flower at different periods,--by dioeciousness--self-sterility--the prepotency of pollen from another individual over a plant's own pollen,--and lastly, by the structure of the flower in relation to the visits of insects. The wonderful diversity of the means for gaining the same end in this case, and in many others, depends on the nature of all the previous changes through which the species has passed, and on the more or less complete inheritance of the successive adaptations of each part to the surrounding conditions. Plants which are already well adapted by the structure of their flowers for cross-fertilisation by the aid of insects often possess an irregular corolla, which has been modelled in relation to their visits; {{and it would have been}} of little or no use to such plants to have become heterostyled. We can thus understand why it is that not a single species is heterostyled in such great families as the Leguminosae, <b>Labiatae,</b> Scrophulariaceae, Orchideae, etc., all of which have irregular flowers. Every known heterostyled plant, however, depends on insects for its fertilisation, and not on the wind; so that it is a rather surprising fact that only one genus, Pontederia, has a plainly irregular corolla.|$|E
40|$|The {{carrying}} of eggs often renders parents {{vulnerable to}} predators {{due to increased}} conspicuousness or decreased mobility. Nonetheless, egg-carrying parents can escape from the predators {{to which they are}} vulnerable. Previous studies have demonstrated heavy predation by spider-eating jumping spiders (Portia <b>labiata)</b> on egg-carrying spitting spider (Scytodes pallida) females, but little predation on eggless females. If the timing of hatching is phenotypically plastic, then both S. pallida females and their eggs could reduce the risk of predation by hatching early. Hence, this study examines the hatching responses of S. pallida to chemical cues from P. <b>labiata,</b> both in the laboratory and in the field, and addresses the following questions. (i) Do cues from predatory P. <b>labiata</b> influence the hatching traits of S. pallida? (ii) Are the olfactory cues from predators sufficient for predator detection by S. pallida ? (iii) Are hatching responses to predatory P. <b>labiata</b> controlled by egg-carrying S. pallida females, or directly by their embryos? The study provides evidence of hatching as a life-history switch point, which shows an adaptive plasticity in response to predation risk in egg-carrying S. pallida. Egg-carrying S. pallida females, but not unattended eggs, adjust egg-hatching time (the interval between oviposition and hatching) in response to the threat of predation on both the female and her eggs by P. <b>labiata.</b> In the presence of P. <b>labiata,</b> eggs that are carried by females hatch sooner; the hatchlings of these eggs are therefore smaller than hatchlings born in the absence of P. <b>labiata.</b> Chemical cues that are released from the draglines of P. <b>labiata</b> are sufficient to elicit changes in the egg-hatching traits of S. pallida. Hatching early in response to this predator may benefit both females and their offspring. To my knowledge, this is the first direct experimental study to demonstrate predator-induced hatching plasticity in spiders and, in particular, in animals with parental care...|$|R

60|$|The {{question}} next arises, whether, as all Kinds {{must have}} a place among the classes, so all the classes in a natural arrangement must be Kinds? And to this I answer, certainly not. The distinctions of Kinds are not numerous enough {{to make up the}} whole of a classification. Very few of the genera of plants, or even of the families, can be pronounced with certainty to be Kinds. The great distinctions of Vascular and Cellular, Dicotyledonous or Exogenous and Monocotyledonous or Endogenous plants, are perhaps differences of kind; the lines of demarcation which divide those classes seem (though even on this I would not pronounce positively) to go through the whole nature of the plants. But the different species of a genus, or genera of a family, usually have in common {{only a limited number of}} characters. A Rose does not seem to differ from a Rubus, or the Umbelliferæ from the Ranunculaceæ, in much else than the characters botanically assigned to those genera or those families. Unenumerated differences certainly do exist in some cases; there are families of plants which have peculiarities of chemical composition, or yield products having peculiar effects on the animal economy. The Cruciferæ and Fungi contain an unusual proportion of nitrogen; the <b>Labiatæ</b> are the chief sources of essential oils, the Solaneæ are very commonly narcotic, etc. In these and similar cases there are possibly distinctions of Kind; but it is by no means indispensable that there should be. Genera and Families may be eminently natural, though marked out from one another by properties limited in number; provided those properties are important, and the objects contained in each genus or family resemble each other more than they resemble any thing which is excluded from the genus or family.|$|E
60|$|These several facts show us in an {{interesting}} manner how intimately certain abnormal states are connected together; namely, arrests of development causing parts to become rudimentary or to be wholly suppressed,--the redevelopment of parts now in {{a more or less}} rudimentary condition,--the reappearance of organs of which not a vestige can be detected,--and to these may be added, in the case of animals, the presence during youth, and subsequent disappearance, of certain characters which occasionally are retained throughout life. Some naturalists look at all such abnormal structures as a return to the ideal state of the group to which the affected being belongs; {{but it is difficult to}} conceive what is meant to be conveyed by this expression. Other naturalists maintain, with greater probability and distinctness of view, that the common bond of connection between the several foregoing cases is an actual, though partial, return to the structure of the ancient progenitor of the group. If this view be correct, we must believe that a vast number of characters, capable of evolution, lie hidden in every organic being. But it would be a mistake to suppose that the number is equally great in all beings. We know, for instance, that plants of many orders occasionally become peloric; but many more cases have been observed in the <b>Labiatae</b> and Scrophulariaceae than in any other order; and in one genus of the Scrophulariaceae, namely Linaria, no less than thirteen species have been described in this condition (13/73. Moquin- Tandon 'Teratologie' page 186.) On this view of the nature of peloric flowers, and bearing in mind certain monstrosities in the animal kingdom, we must conclude that the progenitors of most plants and animals have left an impression, capable of redevelopment, on the germs of their descendants, although these have since been profoundly modified.|$|E
5|$|Populations from Los Baños {{and from}} Sagada, {{both in the}} Philippines, have {{slightly}} different hunting tactics, and Los Baños has some very dangerous prey spiders. In laboratory tests, Los Baños P. <b>labiatas</b> rely more on trial and error than Sagada P. <b>labiatas</b> in finding ways to vibrate the prey's web and thus lure or distract the prey. Around Los Baños the web-building Scytodes pallida, which preys on jumping spiders, is very abundant. All members of the genus Scytodes spit a sticky gum on prey and potential threats, and this can immobilise a Portia {{long enough for the}} Scytodes to wrap the Portia in silk and then bite it. Around Los Baños, P. <b>labiata</b> instinctively detours round the back of S. pallida that is not carrying eggs while with plucking the web {{in a way that makes}} S. pallida believe the threat is in front of it. P. <b>labiata</b> prefers to stalk a female S. pallida carrying eggs, as then S. pallida is reluctant to drop the eggs in order to spit, and in this case P. <b>labiata</b> sometimes uses a direct attack. In areas where S. pallida is absent, the local members of P. <b>labiata</b> do not use this combination of plucking other spiders' webs to deceive the prey and detouring for a stab in the back.|$|R
40|$|Sexually {{selected}} ornaments and {{signals are}} costly to maintain {{if they are}} maladaptive in nonreproductive contexts. The jumping spider Cosmophasis umbratica exhibits distinct sexual dichromatism with males displaying elaborate UV body markings that signal male quality. Female C. umbratica respond favorably to UV-reflecting males and ignore males that have their UV masked. However, Portia <b>labiata,</b> a UV-sensitive spider-eating specialist and a natural predator of C. umbratica, is known to use UV reflectance as a cue when hunting prey. We investigated the cost of these UV signals in C. umbratica {{in terms of their}} predation risk. Under experimental conditions, three choice scenarios were presented to P. <b>labiata</b> individuals. Choices by P. <b>labiata</b> were made between male C. umbratica with and without the UV signal; a UV-reflecting male and non-UV-reflecting female; and a UV-masked male and female. The presence and absence of UV signals was manipulated using an optical filter. Portia <b>labiata</b> exhibited a strong bias toward UV+ individuals. These results suggest the sexually selected trait of UV reflectance increases the visibility of males to UV-sensitive predators. The extent of this male-specific UV signal then is potentially moderated by predation pressure. Interestingly though, P. <b>labiata</b> still preferred males to females irrespective of whether UV reflectance was present or not. This suggests P. <b>labiata</b> can switch cues when conditions to detect UV reflectance are not optimal. 7 page(s...|$|R

6000|$|The {{hermaphrodite}} plants present nothing {{particular in}} the state of their reproductive organs; and so it is in all the following cases. The females of the present species produce rather fewer flowers and have somewhat smaller corollas than the hermaphrodites; so that near Torquay, where this plant abounds, I could, after a little practice, distinguish the two forms whilst walking quickly past them. According to Vaucher, the smaller size of the corolla is common to the females of most or all of the above-mentioned <b>Labiatae.</b> The pistil of the female, though somewhat variable in length, is generally shorter, with the margins of the stigma broader and formed of more lax tissue, than that of the hermaphrodite. The stamens in the female vary excessively in length; they are generally enclosed within the tube of the corolla, and their anthers do not contain any sound pollen; but after long search I found a single plant with the stamens moderately exserted, and their anthers contained a very few full-sized grains, together with a multitude of minute empty ones. In some females the stamens are extremely short, and their minute anthers, though divided into the two normal cells or loculi, contained not a trace of pollen: in others again the anthers did not exceed in diameter the filaments which supported them, and were not divided into two loculi. Judging from what I have myself seen and from the descriptions of others, all the plants in Britain, Germany, and near Mentone, are {{in the state}} just described; and I have never found a single flower with an aborted pistil. It is, therefore, remarkable that, according to Delpino, this plant near Florence is generally trimorphic, consisting of males with aborted pistils, females with aborted stamens, and hermaphrodites. (7/15. 'Sull' Opera, la Distribuzione dei Sessi nelle Piante, etc' 1867 page 7. With respect to Germany H. Muller 'Die Befruchtung etc.' page 327.) ...|$|E
60|$|I {{found it}} very {{difficult}} to judge of the proportional number of the two forms at Torquay. They often grow mingled together, but with large patches consisting of one form alone. At first I thought that the two were nearly equal in number; but on examining every plant which grew close {{to the edge of a}} little overhanging dry cliff, about 200 yards in length, I found only 12 females; all the rest, some hundreds in number, being hermaphrodites. Again, on an extensive gently sloping bank, which was so thickly covered with this plant that, viewed from the distance of half a mile it appeared of a pink colour, I could not discover a single female. Therefore the hermaphrodites must greatly exceed in number the females, at least in the localities examined by me. A very dry station apparently favours the presence of the female form. With some of the other above-named <b>Labiatae</b> the nature of the soil or climate likewise seems to determine the presence of one or both forms; thus with Nepeta glechoma, Mr. Hart found in 1873 that all the plants which he examined near Kilkenny in Ireland were females; whilst all near Bath were hermaphrodites, and near Hertford both forms were present, but with a preponderance of hermaphrodites. (7/16. 'Nature' June 1873 page 162.) It would, however, be a mistake to suppose that the nature of the conditions determines the form independently of inheritance; for I sowed in the same small bed seeds of T. serpyllum, gathered at Torquay from the female alone, and these produced an abundance of both forms. There is every reason to believe, from large patches consisting of the same form, that the same individual plant, however much it may spread, always retains the same form. In two distant gardens I found masses of the lemon-thyme (T. citriodorus, a var. of T. serpyllum, which I was informed had grown there during many years, and every flower was female.|$|E
60|$|We may now {{consider}} the probable {{means by which}} {{so many of the}} <b>Labiatae</b> have been separated into two forms, and the advantages thus gained. H. Muller supposes that originally some individuals varied so as to produce more conspicuous flowers; and that insects habitually visited these first, and then dusted with their pollen visited and fertilised the less conspicuous flowers. (7/17. 'Die Befruchtung der Blumen' pages 319, 326.) The production of pollen by the latter plants would thus be rendered superfluous, and it would be advantageous to the species that their stamens should abort, so as to save useless expenditure. They would thus be converted into females. But another view may be suggested: as the production of a large supply of seeds evidently is of high importance to many plants, and as {{we have seen in the}} three foregoing cases that the females produce many more seeds than the hermaphrodites, increased fertility seems to me the more probable cause of the formation and separation of the two forms. From the data above given it follows that ten plants of Thymus serpyllum, if half consisted of hermaphrodites and half of females, would yield seeds compared with ten hermaphrodite plants in the ratio of 100 to 72. Under similar circumstances the ratio with Satureia hortensis (subject to the doubt from the self-fertilisation of the hermaphrodite) would be as 100 to 60. Whether the two forms originated in certain individuals varying and producing more seed than usual, and consequently producing less pollen; or in the stamens of certain individuals tending from some unknown cause to abort, and consequently producing more seed, it is impossible to decide; but in either case, if the tendency to the increased production of seed were steadily favoured, the result would be the complete abortion of the male organs. I shall presently discuss the cause of the smaller size of the female corolla.|$|E
