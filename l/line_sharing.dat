2500|$|A {{degenerate}} case of Pascal's theorem (four points) is interesting; given points [...] on a conic , {{the intersection}} of alternate sides, , , together with {{the intersection of}} tangents at opposite vertices [...] and [...] are collinear in four points; the tangents being degenerate 'sides', taken at two possible positions on the 'hexagon' and the corresponding Pascal <b>line</b> <b>sharing</b> either degenerate intersection. This can be proven independently using a property of pole-polar. If the conic is a circle, then another degenerate case says that for a triangle, the three points that appear as the intersection of a side line with the corresponding side line of the Gergonne triangle, are collinear.|$|E

50|$|A modem {{sharing device}} (MSD), also {{commonly}} known as a <b>line</b> <b>sharing</b> device (LSD), modem sharer, or line sharer, allows multiple devices to share a serial connection. Only multipoint serial protocols such as Bisync are supported. Both synchronous and asynchronous datastreams can be used. A common example would be a Tandem as host connected to multiple automatic teller machines often with a modem or Cisco router in-between.|$|E

50|$|All {{of these}} {{platforms}} provide weak LL/SC. The PowerPC implementation allows an LL/SC pair to wrap loads and even stores to other cache lines (although {{this approach is}} vulnerable to false cache <b>line</b> <b>sharing).</b> This allows it to implement, for example, lock-free reference counting {{in the face of}} changing object graphs with arbitrary counter reuse (which otherwise requires double compare-and-swap, DCAS). RISC-V provides an architectural guarantee of eventual progress for LL/SC sequences of limited length.|$|E

50|$|The line {{runs from}} Brunswick Hauptbahnhof to the north, bridges the Midland Canal and crosses the Hanover-Wolfsburg line (part of the Hanover-Berlin {{high-speed}} railway), in Gifhorn (old station name: Isenbüttel-Gifhorn). It then traverses Gifhorn district {{and the eastern}} part of the Lüneburg Heath, and reaches Wieren after passing through Wittingen, where there is a junction to the East Hanoverian Railways network, and Bad Bodenteich.

Retaining the wagon body of its predecessor and adopting {{the configuration of the}} Blazer/Jimmy, the Bronco was fitted with a removable hardtop and folding rear seat. Similar to the Ford LTD Country Squire, the glass of the rear window rolled down into the tailgate (via a dash-mounted switch or from using the key on the outside), allowing the tailgate to fold down.|$|E
50|$|In 2005, {{after much}} {{litigation}} concerning its original unbundling rules, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) {{made the decision}} to limit the number and types of unbundled elements that telecommunications carriers were required to offer competitors under the common carrier laws outlined in 47 U.S.C §§ 251. In particular the FCC removed the requirement for ILECs to unbundle Fiber-to-the-Home, and abolished <b>line</b> <b>sharing</b> as an unbundled element. Additionally, the FCC prohibited access to UNEs for the exclusive service to mobile wireless services and long distance services, and removed unbundled switching from the list of UNEs.|$|E
50|$|On March 2, 2004 the U.S. {{appeals court}} ruled that the FCC lacks the {{authority}} to delegate responsibility for setting those rates to the states. It ruled that the FCC had failed to prove that competitors in the local phone market are impaired without government regulated access to critical parts of the phone network controlled by the regional giants. Along with upholding the Triennial Review Order's exemption provided to incumbent carriers from unbundling for certain fiber-fed loops and for <b>line</b> <b>sharing.</b> The ruling was unanimous amongst the three judges and stated that the FCC erred by not providing unified federal guidelines, but rather pushing FCC decisions onto the states.|$|E

50|$|With {{the line}} losing its route from Manville to Oak Island, the line's new route is now from Penn Haven Junction in Lehigh Township, Carbon County, Pennsylvania to Port Reading Junction in Manville, New Jersey. The line {{was able to}} {{continue}} as the original line {{and not as a}} new rail line despite losing its tracks from Manville to Oak Island Yard with those existing tracks becoming a new rail <b>line</b> <b>sharing</b> the ““Lehigh Line” name because the line kept its original route which is between Easton, Pennsylvania and Allentown, Pennsylvania.
