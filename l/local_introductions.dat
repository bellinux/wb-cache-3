40|$|Giraffe are extralimital in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa where recent <b>local</b> <b>introductions</b> have persisted despite limited {{research}} into {{their impact on}} the indigenous flora. The diet of 15 giraffe at the Shamwari Game Reserve was recorded by direct observation during summer (March/April) and winter (July/August) 2001, quantifying diet by frequency of occurrence (individual records scored and expressed {{as a percentage of the}} total). Preference indices were also calculated. Habitat use was measured by the number of hours giraffe fed in different habitats. The diet comprised of 14 plant species, the most important species being Rhus longispina (47. 9 %), Acacia karroo (25. 7 %) and Euclea undulata (17. 6 %). Importance of R. longispina, A. karroo and Tarchonanthus camphoratus fluctuated seasonally. Rhus longispina was more important in winter with a corresponding decrease in feeding on A. karroo. Tarchonanthus camphoratus was only consumed during summer. Acacia karroo thickets (previously disturbed areas) were utilized most (summer 12 h; winter 9 h), with alternative habitats utilized more often in winter than in summer. We suggest that the seasonal fluctuation in the importance of R. longispina & A. karroo reflects the deciduous nature of A. karroo. ...|$|E
40|$|In nature {{the kind}} of {{association}} that we observe frequently between the eukaryotes and microorganisms is symbiotic, and range along the continuum between parasitism and mutualism. The genus Wolbachia contains well-known intracellular bacteria of arthropods that induce several reproductive phenotypes that benefit the transmission of the bacteria. While this process is facilitated by features of Wolbachia, particularly their ability to cause cytoplasmic incompatibility, blocking Wolbachia may produce deleterious effects, such as reduced host viability or fecundity, that inhibit successful <b>local</b> <b>introductions</b> and subsequent spatial spread, parthenogenesis, feminization, male killing and many other reproductive manipulations. The present study using PCR technology based on Wolbachia specific amplification of the ftsZ A and ftsZ B supergroup and phage WO specific amplification of orf 2 and orf 7 gene fragments not only confirms the presence of B supergroup Wolbachia but also reveals the presence of Wolbachia infected with phages WO in Spodoptera litura. Further, we constructed the molecular phylogeny of Wolbachia ftsZ B strain.

40|$|Dengue-suppressing Wolbachia strains are {{promising}} tools for arbovirus control, particularly {{as they have}} the potential to self-spread following <b>local</b> <b>introductions.</b> To test this, we followed the frequency of the transinfected Wolbachia strain wMel through Ae. aegypti in Cairns, Australia, following releases at 3 nonisolated locations within the city in early 2013. Spatial spread was analysed graphically using interpolation and by fitting a statistical model describing the position and width of the wave. For the larger 2 of the 3 releases (covering 0. 97 km 2 and 0. 52 km 2), we observed slow but steady spatial spread, at about 100 - 200 m per year, roughly consistent with theoretical predictions. In contrast, the smallest release (0. 11 km 2) produced erratic temporal and spatial dynamics, with little evidence of spread after 2 years. This is consistent with the prediction concerning fitness-decreasing Wolbachia transinfections that a minimum release area is needed to achieve stable local establishment and spread in continuous habitats. Our graphical and likelihood analyses produced broadly consistent estimates of wave speed and wave width. Spread at all sites was spatially heterogeneous, suggesting that environmental heterogeneity will affect large-scale Wolbachia transformations of urban mosquito populations. The persistence and spread of Wolbachia in release areas meeting minimum area requirements indicates the promise of successful large-scale population transformation...|$|E
40|$|The modern {{biodiversity}} crisis reflects global extinctions and <b>local</b> <b>introductions.</b> Human {{activities have}} dramatically altered rates and scales of processes that regulate biodiversity at local scales [1 - 7]. Reconciling {{the threat of}} global biodiversity loss [2, 4, 6 - 9] with recent evidence of stability at fine spatial scales [10, 11] is a major challenge and requires a nuanced approach to biodiversity change that integrates ecological understanding. With a new dataset of 471 diversity time series spanning from 1962 to 2015 from marine coastal ecosystems, we tested (1) whether biodiversity changed at local scales in recent decades, and (2) whether we can ignore ecological context (e. g., proximate human impacts, trophic level, spatial scale) and still make informative inferences regarding local change. We detected a predominant signal of increasing species richness in coastal systems since 1962 in our dataset, though net species loss was associated with localized effects of anthropogenic impacts. Our geographically extensive dataset {{is unlikely to be}} a random sample of marine coastal habitats; impacted sites (3 % of our time series) were underrepresented relative to their global presence. These local-scale patterns do not contradict the prospect of accelerating global extinctions [2, 4, 6 - 9] but are consistent with local species loss in areas with direct human impacts and increases in diversity due to invasions and range expansions in lower impact areas. Attempts to detect and understand local biodiversity trends are incomplete without information on local human activities and ecological context...|$|E
40|$|Epidemics of soil-borne {{plant disease}} are {{characterized}} by patchiness because of restricted dispersal of inoculum. The density of inoculum within disease patches depends on a sequence comprising local amplification during the parasitic phase followed by dispersal of inoculum by cultivation during the intercrop period. The mechanisms that control size, shape, and persistence have received very little rigorous attention in epidemiological theory. Here we derive a model for dispersal of inoculum in soil by cultivation that takes account into the discrete stochastic nature of the system in time and space. Two parameters, probability of movement and mean dispersal distance, characterize lateral dispersal of inoculum by cultivation. The dispersal parameters are used {{in combination with the}} characteristic area and dimensions of host plants to identify criteria that control the shape and size of disease patches. We derive a critical value for the probability of movement for the formation of cross-shaped patches and show that this is independent of the amount of inoculum. We examine the interaction between local amplification of inoculum by parasitic activity and subsequent dilution by dispersal and identify criteria whereby asymptomatic patches may persist as inoculum falls below a threshold necessary for symptoms to appear in the subsequent crop. The model is motivated by the spread of rhizomania, an economically important soil-borne disease of sugar beet. However, the results have broad applicability to a very wide range of diseases that survive as discrete units of inoculum. The application of the model to patch dynamics of weed seeds and <b>local</b> <b>introductions</b> of genetically modified seeds is also discussed...|$|E

30|$|Since {{decentralization}} in 1985, {{the central}} government has gradually increased its efforts to influence local integration policies for migrant newcomers (see Table 1 for a summary). One reason for the decentralization of the introduction programmes was that the state wanted to introduce individually designed introduction programmes that also took the different local conditions into consideration (Sarstrand Marekovic, 2012). Municipalities were supposed to offer services such as language training, civic orientation and labour market activities and the state would provide the funding. In many municipalities the migrants’ social needs were prioritized (Soininen, 1992).

While the exotic species were introduced as the intraguild prey (IGprey), they invade and spread through patchy invasion which corresponds to the invasion {{at the edge of}} extinction. Increase of the IGprey's dispersal rate and decrease of the IGpredator's may make the IGprey invade.

30|$|The Copenhagen example {{shows that}} it is {{important}} to complement the research on local integration policy using frame analysis with research that also looks at the power relations between central and local governments and central governments’ use of different instruments of compliance. This article has examined one area of integration policy, namely that directed at migrant newcomers. While most studies of multi-level governance and integration policy have found that local governments are increasing in importance, I have shown that when it comes to migrant newcomers, local integration policy is increasingly governed by national governments. In both the Danish and Swedish cases there has been a centralization of authority and disempowerment at the sub-national level. In Sweden, the national government ended up using coercive instruments and took over responsibility for the entire policy area. Municipalities are now subordinate to the state in the development of <b>local</b> <b>introduction</b> programmes. Denmark uses the Integration Act as a coercive instrument to make sure that local governments and migrant newcomers comply with the wishes of the Danish national government.|$|R
30|$|The {{introduction}} {{reform has}} contributed to the greater centralization of integration policy for migrant newcomers in Sweden, although is not the only example of this. The state, which in Sweden is responsible for labour market policy, has introduced subsidized employment directed at migrant newcomers. The state budget for the <b>local</b> <b>introduction</b> programmes has sky-rocketed from about five billion SEK a year in 2006 – 2011 to 13 billion in 2014, and is expected to reach 25 billion in 2017.

In addition, the target group for the introduction programmes expanded in January 2014 (Bill 2012 / 13 : 188). Family members of humanitarian migrants arriving in Sweden within a 6  years period, instead of 2  years, are now eligible for an introduction programme. Other state centralization efforts affecting the local level are a new law that forces municipalities to accept the settlement of unaccompanied minors, increased rights for undocumented migrants and state funding for local anti-discrimination measures.|$|R

In recent years, two new techniques have become available for the study of human adipose tissue metabolism in vivo: microdialysis, and catheterization of the venous drainage from the subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue.
