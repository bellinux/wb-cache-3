40|$|Preface: The {{arrival of}} the 1820 Settlers in South Africa {{and their impact on}} the {{political}} and social life of the Cape Colony has been well covered by historical research. This work is an attempt to illuminate yet another area in which their impact was felt. The failure of the settlement scheme under which these people were introduced into the colony has tended to detract from the importance which agriculture played {{in the early years of}} their residence in South Africa. The failure of the first crops may well have ended the attempts by many to establish themselves on the land but for others it was the beginning of a process of adaptation to the agricultural conditions of a new country. In this they were remarkably successful and within a decade the English farming community of the eastern frontier was prospering. The theme of this work traces the progress of these farmers through the initial period of crop failures, which condemned the settlement in the eyes of many, and through the ensuing years and later misfortune, the Sixth Frontier war of 1834 - 35. Both these setbacks were very significant in moulding the development of agriculture as practised by these farmers. In the past, historians have tended to over-estimate the reverse suffered by these farmers during this frontier war. The seemingly paradoxical questions raised by the rapid recovery of this community after the war have been left largely unanswered. Some attempt is made in the pages which follow to shed new light on this issue. In the first three chapters of this work the letters written by Thomas Philipps to his family in Britain form the chief source of information. Much of this correspondence has already found wider publication in a volume edited by Arthur Keppel-Jones, but there are significant omissions, particularly with regard to Philipps' commentary <b>on</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>matters.</b> Unfortunately, this series of letters ends in 1830, and the chief sources for the latter period of this work are the various entries made) <b>on</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>matters,</b> in the Graham's Town Journal, together with the farm diary of James Collett, another frontier farmer. From these, and various other works, it has been possible to trace the major developments of this farming community...|$|R
50|$|Perhaps {{surprisingly}} {{given its}} conservative ideology, the Herald editorialised {{its support for}} Thomas' progressive proposals, observing that 'Professor Thomas is distinctly of the present and of the future, as indeed his colleagues are, and {{it is on the}} fact that our professors have thoroughly caught the temper of the times, and have brought themselves in touch with the onward spirit of colonial life, that the best hopes are based that our University institutions will prove to be the most influential and valuable of our educational agencies.' He also initiated a series of lectures <b>on</b> <b>agricultural</b> science at the AUC specifically aimed at teachers and farmers. For some years after, {{in the absence of any}} official activity, he provided advice and delivered lectures <b>on</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>matters</b> to a wide range of agricultural organisations throughout the country. Thomas, along with Brown, was also behind an ultimately successful move to establish a school of mines at AUC in 1906. By 1910 the AUC school had morphed into what Sinclair describes as 'a covert School of Engineering', a move that despite opposition from the University of New Zealand became official in 1923.|$|R
25|$|Cuvier {{spent an}} {{additional}} {{four years at}} the Caroline Academy in Stuttgart, where he excelled {{in all of his}} coursework. Although he knew no German on his arrival, after only nine months of study, he managed to win the school prize for that language. Upon graduation, he had no money on which to live as he awaited appointment to an academic office. So in July 1788, he took a job at Fiquainville chateau in Normandy as tutor to the only son of the Comte d'Héricy, a Protestant noble. There, during the early 1790s, he began his comparisons of fossils with extant forms. Cuvier regularly attended meetings held at the nearby town of Valmont for the discussion of agricultural topics. There, he became acquainted with Henri Alexandre Tessier (1741–1837), who had assumed a false identity. Previously, he had been a physician and well-known agronomist, who had fled the Terror in Paris. After hearing Tessier speak <b>on</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>matters,</b> Cuvier recognized him as the author of certain articles on agriculture in the Encyclopédie Méthodique and addressed him as M. Tessier.|$|R
30|$|As outlined, neither {{landscape}} planning nor voluntary agreements result in binding law. More effective solutions {{can be found}} in binding agricultural planning. In terms of legislative technique, three options are possible. Either the BNatSchG could be amended to open up {{landscape planning}} for agricultural planning and make it binding in that respect, or agricultural planning concerning GMOs could be included into the GenTG, or a separate <b>law</b> <b>on</b> <b>agricultural</b> planning could be designed. Besides ensuring co-existence, such planning could at the same time enhance environmental risk reduction. In the German case, it could be based on the competence for nature and landscape protection (Art. 74 No. 29 Grundgesetz) as well as the competence for support for agricultural production (Art. 74 No. 17 Grundgesetz).|$|R

5000|$|Subsequently, on 2 May 1651, {{and again}} on 10 Oct. of the same year, Hartlib wrote to Sir Richard, whom he had been [...] "credibly informed" [...] {{was the author of}} the [...] "Discours," [...] asking him for some further {{information}} on the subject of clover cultivation, and requesting him to ‘make compleat and sufficiently enlarged’ for the benefit of all [...] "his former treatise." [...] As Sir Richard took no notice, Hartlib republished the pamphlet in 1652 from a more correct copy, adding transcripts of his two letters to Sir Richard. Hartlib's [...] "Legacy of Husbandry" [...] (a collection of anonymous notes <b>on</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>matters</b> written by Robert Child, Cressy Dymock, and others, which Hartlib edited and published {{at the same time as}} he pirated Sir Richard's work) has sometimes been erroneously attributed to Sir Richard Weston. This error would not need comment were it not for the fact that in 1742 one T.

The rich area of Baranja triangle enriched the land fund for about 6 % of total area of land fund in agricultural reform and colonization in Croatia.
