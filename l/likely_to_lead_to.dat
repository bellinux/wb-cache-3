5|$|Individuals {{infected}} with H. pylori have a 10 to 20% lifetime {{risk of developing}} peptic ulcers and a 1 to 2% risk of acquiring stomach cancer. Inflammation of the pyloric antrum is more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> duodenal ulcers, while inflammation of the corpus (body of the stomach) is more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> gastric ulcers and gastric carcinoma. However, H. pylori possibly plays a role only {{in the first stage}} that leads to common chronic inflammation, but not in further stages leading to carcinogenesis. A meta-analysis conducted in 2009 concluded the eradication of H. pylori reduces gastric cancer risk in previously infected individuals, suggesting the continued presence of H. pylori constitutes a relative risk factor of 65% for gastric cancers; in terms of absolute risk, the increase was from 1.1% to 1.7%.|$|E

5|$|Democracy, or {{the rule}} of the many over themselves. The rule of the masses is positive, in that it is less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> civil war than the alternatives. An {{ambivalent}} feature of democracy is the fact that representatives are forced to compromise their ideologies to stay in power, which can curb both positive and negative tendencies. On the negative side, democracies are not very good at dealing with subjects that demand expert authority or quick decisions. Moreover, a democracy is easily corruptible by politicians with agendas. Also, a democracy may easily slip into popular apathy which allows for corrupt politicians to go unchecked (Russell 1938:154–159).|$|E

5|$|The {{survival}} {{of this species}} is tied closely to rainfall because of the susceptibility of seedlings to drought. It is thus especially vulnerable {{to the effects of}} climate change. This was recognised as early as 1992, when it was noted that winter rainfall in the Quairading region had been falling by about 4% per decade, and that a continuation of this trend may reduce the species' distribution. Recently, a more thorough assessment of the potential impact of climate change on this species found that severe change is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> extinction, and mild change to a reduction of its range by 80% by 2080. However, there may not be any range reduction at all under mid-severity climate change, depending on how effectively this species can migrate into newly habitable areas.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{principal}} damage mechanisms {{to the inner}} ear in industrialised society, and both injure hair cells. The first is exposure to elevated sound levels (noise trauma), {{and the second is}} exposure to drugs and other substances (ototoxicity). A large number of people are exposed to sound levels on a daily basis that are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> significant hearing loss. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has recently published research on the estimated numbers of persons with hearing difficulty (11%) and the percentage of those that can be attributed to occupational noise exposure (24%). Furthermore, according to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), approximately twenty-two million (17%) US workers reported exposure to hazardous workplace noise. Workers exposed to hazardous noise further exacerbate the potential for developing noise-induced hearing loss when they do not wear hearing protection.|$|E
5|$|Vitamins are {{classified}} as either water-soluble or fat-soluble. In humans there are 13 vitamins: 4 fat-soluble (A, D, E, and K) and 9 water-soluble (8 B vitamins and vitamin C). Water-soluble vitamins dissolve easily in water and, in general, are readily excreted from the body, {{to the degree that}} urinary output is a strong predictor of vitamin consumption. Because they are not as readily stored, more consistent intake is important. Fat-soluble vitamins are absorbed through the intestinal tract with the help of lipids (fats). Because {{they are more likely to}} accumulate in the body, they are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> hypervitaminosis than are water-soluble vitamins. Fat-soluble vitamin regulation is of particular significance in cystic fibrosis.|$|E

40|$|In {{the era of}} {{increasingly}} expensive fuel and with the theoretical complication and the limitation of comfort prediction in naturally ventilated buildings based on thermal balance approach, researchers were motivated to go beyond heat balance approach to predict occupants’ thermal comfort using statistical approach known by adaptive models. The most established recognized model was developed mostly from the worldwide database recorded in office buildings. This poses validity problem when the model is applied for residential buildings. From a practical point of view using this model for the determination of neutral temperature in residences is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> errors in prediction which in turns are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have detrimental effect on occupants’ satisfaction, {{not to mention the}} potential effect in terms of energy consumption.

The validity of international thermal comfort standards for residential buildings for neutral temperature prediction specifically in the hot-humid tropics is addressed. The need of database from field studies in residential buildings is emphasized...|$|R

It is highly {{susceptible to}} Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback; wild populations are harvested commercially by the cut flower industry; and some of its range is subject to land clearing for urban or agricultural purposes. An assessment of the potential impact of climate change on this species found that severe change is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> a reduction in its range of around 50% by 2080; and even mild change is projected to cause a reduction of 30%; but under mid-severity scenarios the distribution may actually grow, depending on how effectively it can migrate into newly habitable areas. However, this study does not address the potential of climate change to alter fire regimes; these have already been impacted by the arrival of humans, and this change is thought to have led to a decline in the abundance and range of B.prionotes.|$|E
5|$|Christian apologist and philosopher Alvin Plantinga, a {{supporter}} of intelligent design, has formalized and revised the improbability argument as the evolutionary argument against naturalism, which asserts that it is irrational to reject a supernatural, intelligent creator because the apparent probability of certain faculties evolving is so low. Specifically, Plantinga claims that evolution cannot account for the rise of reliable reasoning faculties. Plantinga argues that whereas a God {{would be expected to}} create beings with reliable reasoning faculties, evolution would be just as <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> unreliable ones, meaning that if evolution is true, it is irrational to trust whatever reasoning one relies on to conclude that it is true. This novel epistemological argument has been criticized similarly to other probabilistic design arguments. It has also been argued that rationality, if conducive to survival, {{is more likely to be}} selected for than irrationality, making the natural development of reliable cognitive faculties more likely than unreliable ones.|$|E
5|$|In her research, Fraser worked {{predominantly}} in infectious disease, studying general infection, puerperal fever, {{scarlet fever}} and septic sore throat among other bacterial infections. She began studies on scarlet fever {{in the early}} 1930s, and along with Dr. Helen Plummer isolated the precipitin present in the strains of streptococci <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> disease. These findings were important in determining the types of antitoxins which might be employed for immunization to neutralize the disease. The type of research Fraser was engaged in required that the bacteria of the disease which created a toxin be isolated, {{so that it could}} be injected into a horse. Repeated injections of small doses of toxin allowed the horse to become immune to the disease. The serum created from the blood of animals which had been immunized, contained an antibody (known at the time as an antitoxin), which could then be injected into humans to cure the disease. Development of the sulfonamides rendered immunization against scarlet fever unnecessary, but she continued to study other aspects of the disease. In 1941, she typed the streptococci of scarlet fever which was an important breakthrough for tracking the epidemiology of the disease. Fraser also conducted research in an attempt to develop an antigen for tuberculosis. With the development of penicillin, her research after 1947, shifted focus to the study of antibiotics including bacitracin, penicillin, polymixin, and subtilin. Fraser studied various preparations of penicillin against the tubercular bacillus and as a treatment for gonorrhoea. Rising through the ranks of assistant professor and associate professor, Fraser became a full professor in 1949 teaching preventative medicine for the Bachelor of Science or nursing degree for the remainder of her career. In 1955 Fraser was appointed as a professor of microbiology and held that post until her retirement a decade later.|$|E

40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} is {{a growing}} worldwide epidemic disease, currently affecting 1 in 12 adults. Treatment of disease complications typically consumes ∼ 10 % of healthcare budgets in developed societies. Whilst immune-mediated destruction of insulin-secreting pancreatic β cells is responsible for Type 1 diabetes, both the loss and dysfunction of these cells underly the more prevalent Type 2 diabetes. The establishment of robust drug development programmes aimed at β-cell restoration is still hampered {{by the absence of}} means to measure β-cell mass prospectively in vivo, an approach which would provide new opportunities for understanding disease mechanisms and ultimately assigning personalized treatments.
