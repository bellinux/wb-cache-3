5|$|Before {{the tour}} began, MacLaren {{resigned}} as Lancashire's captain and assistant secretary, owing to {{his concern for}} the health of his wife. Journalists speculated that MacLaren would join the Hampshire team as assistant secretary, as he <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> county, or even move to Australia. Lancashire selected a replacement captain, but when MacLaren returned to England, he re-committed to the club, stating the visit to Australia had improved the health of his wife, and he was reappointed.|$|E
25|$|In the 1830s, {{the first}} wooden {{dwellings}} were {{built on the}} site, and in the 1850s stone buildings appeared.

25|$|The old {{borough of}} Bab Tuma was {{developed}} {{at the end of}} the Roman/Byzantine era by the local Eastern Orthodox community.

25|$|The {{main task}} of Barton's {{ministry}} was to organise {{the conduct of}} the first federal elections, which were held in March 1901. Barton was elected unopposed to the seat of Hunter in the new Parliament (although he never <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> electorate) and his Protectionist Party won enough seats to form a government {{with the support of the}} Labour Party. All his ministers were elected, except for Elliott Lewis, who did not stand for election and was replaced by Sir Philip Fysh.|$|E
25|$|He was {{probably}} from Brescia, {{and is known}} to have <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> city for several periods of his life, although he was in Venice in 1517 and for some time after that, the period during which the illuminated manuscript was prepared. It is possible that Capirola is the famous Brescian lutenist who visited the court of Henry VIII of England, although his name was not recorded (no other virtuoso lutenists of the period, from Brescia, who were also noblemen, are known).|$|E
25|$|The {{indigenous}} population was particularly {{concentrated in the}} Campeche-Mérida region. This {{was known as the}} Camino Real, because the majority of the peninsulares and criollos <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> area. The Maya roughly outnumbered the European-descended groups by three to one throughout the Yucatan, but in the east this ratio was closer to five to one. The elites maintained the strictest discipline and control over the Maya population in the east. The Church, generally allied with the stronger classes, also had a preponderant role where the military organization was strongest.|$|E

25|$|The Seventh-day Adventist Church {{developed}} from the Millerite movement of the 1830s and 1840s. William Miller traveled in response to invitations. This {{led him to the}} Eastern Townships of Quebec. Miller, Joshua Himes, and Josiah Litch all visited Canada. Miller's sister lived in the Eastern Townships of Quebec. Josiah Litch <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> district and led in Millerite activities there. Canada became an integral part of their activities. The interest in Miller's teachings was extensive in the Canadas and the Maritimes. Under the leadership of Josiah Litch, the first Millerite camp meeting took place in Canada, at Hatley, Quebec.|$|E
25|$|The {{new species}} found at Gogo Formation in Kimberley, Western Australia, Onychodus jandemarrai, {{is the best}} known species of the genus. It was {{described}} in 2006 based on extensive research by the late Dr. Mahala Andrews, with colleagues Dr John Long, Dr Per Ahlberg, Prof. Ken Campbell and Dr Richard Barwick from material collected by the British Museum of Natural History, the Bureau of Mineral Resources and the Australian National University in Canberra. New material gathered by Dr. Long from the limestone in the Gogo formation, where he visited many times, contributed much information. Although much is known of this species, there are missing details such as {{the shape of the}} posterior end of the tail, the pectoral and pelvic fins and the first dorsal fin. The name of species O. jandemarrai comes from the Aboriginal warrior Jandemarra who <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> area.|$|E
25|$|It {{was a year}} of fire tiger in Jinki (the year 726). A monk {{from the}} Kii Province, Tōkōbō Yūkei was journeying in Adachigahara when the sun was about to set, and {{requested}} {{to be allowed to}} stay in a cave for lodging. An old lady <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> cave. The old lady who seemed to have kindly let in Yūkei then left the cave telling Yūkei that there was not enough firewood and she needed go outside to get some more but that during this time Yūkei must not look in the room further in. However, Yūkei opened the shutter out of curiosity, and when he peeked inside, there was a mountain of human bones piled up inside. Dumbfounded by this sight, Yūkei recalled a rumor of an onibaba at Adachigahara who would kill travelers and devour their blood and meat, and he got the feeling that this old lady was the rumored onibaba, so he fled the cave.|$|E

25|$|The ZafiRaminia, {{a migrant}} group were {{defeated}} by the Antambahoaka people from Mananjary, Fianarantsoa which claimed Arab and Islamic (Silamo) origins (some claim direct descent from the uncle of the prophet Muhammad), began moving into the Efaho valley due to the war which the Zafikazimambo was successfully waging on the Antambahoaka (only {{women and children were}} being spared—but even then being placed in confined areas) in the Mananjary region (p.854). By the time they moved to Anosy they had already <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> region of Madagascar long enough to have become assimilated into the Malagasy population of that area, to the point that did not have mosques or any other Islamic institutions. They had, however, retained Arabic script (sorabe) and had vague memories of the Quran as well as several socio-religious practices. They also had both soothsayers (ombiasa) and scribes (katibo), who had the ability to both write and interpret the Sorabe (see Sorabe alphabet) which were venerated, an Islamic tradition. This was according to Racoube, grand ancestor of Anosy and prince of Mangalore, who had fled to Madagascar in fear of his older brother.|$|E
25|$|Mate {{was first}} {{consumed}} by the indigenous Guaraní and also spread by the Tupí people who <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> part of southern Brazil and Northeast Argentina, including some areas that were Paraguayan territory before the Paraguayan War. Therefore, the scientific name of the yerba mate is Ilex paraguariensis. The consumption of yerba mate became widespread with the European colonization in the Spanish colony of Paraguay in the late 16th century, among both Spanish settlers and indigenous Guaraní, who consumed it before the Spanish arrival. Mate consumption spread in the 17th century to the Río de la Plata {{and from there to}} Chile. This widespread consumption turned it into Paraguay's main commodity above other wares such as tobacco, cotton and beef. Aboriginal labour was used to harvest wild stands. In the mid-17th century, Jesuits managed to domesticate the plant and establish plantations in their Indian reductions in the Paraguayan department of Misiones, sparking severe competition with the Paraguayan harvesters of wild strands. After their expulsion in the 1770s, the Jesuit missions – along with the yerba mate plantations – fell into ruins. The industry continued to be of prime importance for the Paraguayan economy after independence, but development in benefit of the Paraguayan state halted after the Paraguayan War (1864–1870) that devastated the country both economically and demographically.|$|E

We wanted the film to feel like a lost film of that era. If we're a footnote in the history of pulp art and Golden Age comics, that'd be enough, that'd be great. If we even just inspire some people to go back and investigate some of that stuff, we'd have done enough." ...|$|E

500|$|The game's {{world and}} {{characters}} were designed primarily by Gilbert. After having read Tim Powers' historical fantasy novel On Stranger Tides, {{he decided to}} add paranormal themes to the game's plot. He also cited Powers' book as an influence on the characters, particularly those of Guybrush and LeChuck. Inspiration for the game's ambiance came from Gilbert's favorite childhood amusement park ride, Pirates of the Caribbean. Grossman said that Gilbert always wanted [...] "to step off the ride" [...] and [...] "talk {{to the people who}} <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> world". Near the final stages of the design work, Gilbert introduced several characters who were not directly related to the game's story. He considered this to be an important decision, as the player would need those seemingly minor characters in later parts of the game and would receive a chance to [...] "really interact with them".|$|E
