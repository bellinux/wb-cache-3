In contrast, China has the world's largest swine population but is not a major exporter of <b>live</b> <b>swine,</b> and is not an important source of swIAVs in neighbouring Asian countries or globally.

40|$|A {{model of}} a {{representative}} Canadian pork exporter is developed to examine the impacts of the exchange rate and its volatility on pork and <b>live</b> <b>swine</b> exports. The pork export supply equation is expressed {{as a function of}} the expected level of real exchange rate and a time-varying variance of real exchange rate. An AR(p) model is used to represent the expected real exchange rate, and a GARCH(p, q) model is used to generate the time-varying variance.

The parameters of <b>all</b> pork and <b>live</b> <b>swine</b> export equations have theoretically consistent signs and many are significant. That is, the domestic price in the exporting country has a negative effect on exports because it is a major input price in the exporter's cost function while the price in the market of destination has a positive effect.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to conduct a {{detailed}} Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of the U.

The functional unit was defined as one kilogram (2. 2 pounds) of <b>live</b> <b>swine</b> at the farm gate, ready for transport to the abattoir. This assessment focused on the three highest producing USDA regions, which encompassed the Midwest (Regions 5 and 7) and the Southeast (Region 4), representing 86 % of U. S. market hog production. First, a literature review was conducted to summarize the most current information and knowledge regarding the status of land use accounting in agriculture and livestock production. The literature review identified work reported by other researchers and organizations, nationally and internationally, and was used to guide the methods and help create the life cycle inventory (LCI) for the detailed LCA. The study showed that the average land occupation required to produce 1 kg of <b>live</b> <b>swine</b> weight (LW) in the U. S. was 4. 22 m 2 a. This result is based on a feed ration that was intended to represent a typical U. S. swine ration, referred to as the baseline. Regional results were calculated assuming corn, DDGs, and soybean meal were sourced within each production region, excluding Region 4, which assumed 70 % of the feed was a commodity average. Swine in Region 4 had the highest land occupation at 4. 59 m 2 a/kg LW, followed by 4. 13 m 2 a/kg LW in Region 5 and 4. 11 m 2 a/kg LW in Region 7. In addition to the baseline diet, six diet scenarios were modeled to assess the impact of ration composition. A linear programming model was used to construct four ration manipulation strategies intended to lower cost, carbon footprint, water use, and land use. Two more rations were included to assess the increased use of synthetic amino acids. All scenario diets showed impact reductions from the baseline in one or more categories ranging from 2 % to 73 %.

Fourteen porcine cadaveric eyes, 20 eyes in <b>live</b> <b>swine</b> and six human cadaveric eyes underwent PPV using the HV or a pneumatic guillotine vitrector (GV). An additional 4 porcine crystalline lenses were touched with either the HV or GV for 1 minute. Following PPV, human vitreous was removed and processed for electron microscopy (EM). Eyes and lenses were fixed and sectioned for light microscopy (LM). There were no macroscopic retinal or optic nerve defects associated with either HV or GV PPVs. Cadaveric retinal specimens showed separation of the inner limiting membrane (ILM) and vacuolization and fragmentation at the nerve fiber layer (NFL) and the ganglion cell layer (GCL). ILM fragmentation and separation were found after PPV in <b>live</b> <b>swine</b> with both vitrectors. Small disruptions of the posterior capsule or structural lens defects were found after HV touch. The EM analysis revealed more fragmentation of human vitreous collagen fibrils after HV compared to GV PPV. LM and EM analysis of retina, vitreous, and crystalline lens after PPV showed similar morphological changes using the HV or the GV. Vitreous fragmentation appeared more effective with the HV. Overall this study suggests that the HV may be a promising new technology. More work is needed to quantitatively assess its safety and efficacy...|$|R

Ultrasound has been used previously to predict subcutaneous fat thickness and IMF in the longissimus muscles of line pigs and Real-time ultrasound has also been reported as a reliable method for estimating IMF in live pigs. So we estimate the correlation between meat quality traits and IMF percentage to investigate the possibility of utilizing real-time ultrasound technology for predicting IMF percentage in line pigs to improve pork quality. The genetic and phenotypic correlations for chemical intramuscular fat (CIMF) and ultrasound intramuscular fat (UIMF) were estimated to be 0. 75 and 0. 76, respectively.

Losses for hogs, including the value of animals destroyed, range from $ 2. 6 billion to $ 4. 1 billion.

Therefore, accurate and updated information on the location and origin of those potential TADs risks is essential, so preventive measures as market restrictions can be put on place. The objective {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the current risk of African swine fever (ASF) and Classical swine fever (CSF) introduction into the US through the legal importations of <b>live</b> pigs and <b>swine</b> products using a quantitative approach that could be later applied to other risks. Four quantitative stochastic risk assessment models were developed to estimate the monthly probabilities of ASF and CSF release into the US, and the exposure of susceptible populations (domestic and feral swine) to these introductions at state level. The results suggest a low annual probability of either ASF or CSF introduction into the US, by any of the analyzed pathways (5. 5 * 10 - 3). Being the probability of introduction through legal imports of live pigs (1. 8 * 10 - 3 for ASF, and 2. 5 * 10 - 3 for CSF) higher than the risk of legally imported swine products (8. 90 * 10 - 4 for ASF, and 1. 56 * 10 - 3 for CSF). This could be caused due to the low probability of exposure associated with this type of commodity (products). The risk of feral pigs accessing to swine products discarded in landfills was slightly higher than the potential exposure of domestic pigs through swill feeding. The identification of the months at highest risk, the origin of the higher risk imports, and the location of the US states most vulnerable to those introductions (Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin for <b>live</b> <b>swine</b> and California, Florida and Texas for swine products), is valuable information that would help to design prevention, risk-mitigation and early-detection strategies that would help to minimize the catastrophic consequences of potential ASF/CSF introductions into the US...|$|R

Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we examine the role of travel, trade, and national healthcare resources in predicting the emergence and initial spread of 2009 A/H 1 N 1 influenza. We find that incorporating national healthcare resource data into our analyses allowed a much greater capacity to predict the international spread of this virus. In countries with lower healthcare resources, the reporting of 2009 A/H 1 N 1 cases was significantly delayed, likely reflecting a lower capacity for testing and reporting, {{as well as other}} socio-political issues.
