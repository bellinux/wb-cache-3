50|$|Unlike a light beam, a <b>light</b> <b>pillar</b> is not {{physically}} located {{above or below}} the light source. Its appearance of a vertical column is an optical illusion, resulting from the collective reflection off the ice crystals, only those of which that appear to lie in a vertical line direct the light rays towards the observer (similar to the reflection of a light source in a body of water).|$|E
50|$|A <b>light</b> <b>pillar</b> is an {{atmospheric}} optical {{phenomenon in}} the form of a vertical band of light which appears to extend above and/or below a light source. The effect is created by the reflection of light from numerous tiny ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere or clouds. The light can come from the Sun (usually when it is near or even below the horizon) in which case the phenomenon is called a sun pillar or solar pillar. It can also come from the Moon or from terrestrial sources such as streetlights.|$|E
50|$|A <b>light</b> <b>pillar,</b> or sun pillar, {{appears as}} a {{vertical}} pillar or column of light rising from the sun near sunset or sunrise, though it can appear below the sun, particularly if the observer is at a high elevation or altitude. Hexagonal plate- and column-shaped ice crystals cause the phenomenon. Plate crystals generally cause pillars only {{when the sun is}} within 6 degrees of the horizon, or below it; column crystals can cause a pillar when the sun is as high as 20 degrees above the horizon. The crystals tend to orient themselves near-horizontally as they fall or float through the air, and the width and visibility of a sun pillar depend on crystal alignment.|$|E

50|$|<b>Light</b> <b>pillars</b> {{can also}} form around the moon, and around street lights or other bright <b>lights.</b> <b>Pillars</b> forming from {{ground-based}} light sources may appear much taller than {{those associated with}} the sun or moon. Since the observer {{is closer to the}} light source, crystal orientation matters less in the formation of these pillars.|$|R
50|$|Since {{they are}} caused by the {{interaction}} of light with ice crystals, light pillars belong {{to the family of}} halos. The crystals responsible for light pillars usually consist of flat, hexagonal plates, which tend to orient themselves more or less horizontally as they fall through the air. Their collective surfaces act as a giant mirror, which reflects the light source upwards and/or downwards into a virtual image. As the crystals are disturbed by turbulence, the angle of their surfaces deviates some degrees from the horizontal orientation, causing the reflection (i.e. the <b>light</b> <b>pillar)</b> to become elongated into a column. The larger the crystals, the more pronounced this effect becomes. More rarely, column-shaped crystals can cause light pillars as well. In very cold weather, the ice crystals can be suspended near the ground, in which case they are referred to as diamond dust.|$|E

50|$|Diamond dust {{is often}} {{associated}} with halos, such as sun dogs, <b>light</b> <b>pillars,</b> etc. Like the ice crystals in cirrus or cirrostratus clouds, diamond dust crystals form directly as simple hexagonal ice crystals — as opposed to freezing drops — and generally form slowly. This combination results in crystals with well defined shapes - usually either hexagonal plates or columns - which, like a prism, can reflect and/or refract light in specific directions.|$|R

50|$|Gothic {{architecture}} {{flourished in}} western Europe from the mid-12th century the 15th century. {{a new system}} of building enabled architects to design churches with lighter walls and <b>lighter</b> <b>pillars</b> than was possible in Romanesque churches. Many of the pillars had ribs like an open umbrella. Many of the gothic churches also had flying buttresses with brick or stone arched supports built against the outside walls. We can still see the buttresses on the front wall of ballincollig church. Sculptors carved the figures of saints and heroes of Christianity on the columns of the church doorways and windows.|$|R
50|$|Halo (from Greek , halōs) is {{the name}} {{for a family of}} optical {{phenomena}} produced by light interacting with ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere. Halos can have many forms, ranging from colored or white rings to arcs and spots in the sky. Many of these are near the Sun or Moon, but others occur elsewhere or even in the opposite part of the sky. Among the best known halo types are the circular halo (properly called the 22° halo), <b>light</b> <b>pillars</b> and sun dogs, but there are many more; some of them fairly common, others (extremely) rare.|$|R

25|$|Frozen fog (also {{known as}} ice fog) is {{any kind of}} fog where the {{droplets}} have frozen into extremely tiny crystals of ice in midair. Generally this requires temperatures at or below , making it common only in and near the Arctic and Antarctic regions. It is most often seen in urban areas where it is created by the freezing of water vapor present in automobile exhaust and combustion products from heating and power generation. Urban ice fog can become extremely dense and will persist day and night until the temperature rises. Extremely small amounts of ice fog falling from the sky form a type of precipitation called ice crystals, often reported in Barrow, Alaska. Ice fog often leads to the visual phenomenon of <b>light</b> <b>pillars.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Among {{the best-known}} halos is the 22° halo, often just called [...] "halo", which {{appears as a}} large ring around the Sun or Moon with a radius of about 22° (roughly the width of an outstretched hand at arm's length). The ice {{crystals}} that cause the 22° halo are oriented semi-randomly in the atmosphere, {{in contrast to the}} horizontal orientation required for some other halos such as sun dogs and <b>light</b> <b>pillars.</b> As a result of the optical properties of the ice crystals involved, no light is reflected towards the inside of the ring, leaving the sky noticeably darker than the sky around it, and giving it the impression of a [...] "hole in the sky". The 22° halo is {{not to be confused with}} the corona, which is a different optical phenomenon caused by water droplets rather than ice crystals, and which has the appearance of a multicolored disk rather than a ring.|$|R

50|$|Fermo Cathedral: Excavations {{undertaken}} in 1934-35 under the church's pavement {{brought to light}} remains {{from the age of}} Antoninus Pius (2nd century AD) and of a Palaeo-Christian basilica dating to the 6th century AD. This had three naves divided into four bays, with a raised presbytery. Of its mosaic decorations today only those in the apse are visible, depicting two peacocks near a kantharos surmounted by the chrismon, two typical examples of art in Ravenna at the time. After the destruction of this church by Christian of Mainz in 1176 by order of Frederick Barbarossa, the church reconstructed in 1227 by Giorgio da Como. It has a Gothic facade made of Istrian stone, divided by <b>light</b> <b>pillars</b> and with a central rose window (1348), a bell tower from the same age, and a side portal. In the vestibule are several tombs, including one from 1366 by Tura da Imola, and also the modern monument to Giuseppe Colucci, a famous writer on the antiquities of Picenum. The interior reflects the late 18th century reconstruction. The building is now surrounded by a garden. Among the possessions of the treasury is a chasuble said to have belonged to St Thomas Becket of Canterbury on 1170 and canonized by Pope Alexander II on 1173. It {{is said to have been}} given to Fermo by Bishop Presbitero (1184-1203).|$|R
5000|$|Fergusson in his History of Eastern Architecture thus {{describes}} the general architectural style of Gauḍa: It is neither {{like that of}} Delhi nor Jaunpur, nor any other style, but one purely local and not without considerable merit in itself; its principal characteristic being heavy short pillars of stone supporting pointed arches and vaults in brick whereas at Jaunpore, for instance, <b>light</b> <b>pillars</b> carried horizontal architraves and flat ceilings. Owing to the lightness of the small, thin bricks, which were chiefly used {{in the making of}} Gauḍa, its buildings have not well withstood the ravages of time and the weather; while much of its enamelled work has been removed for the ornamentation of the surrounding cities of more modern origin. Moreover, the ruins long served as a quarry for the builders of neighboring towns and villages, till in 1900 steps were taken for their preservation by the government. The finest ruin in Gauḍa is that of the Great Golden Mosque, also called Bara Darwaza, or twelve doored (1526). An arched corridor running along the whole front of the original building is the principal portion now standing. There are eleven arches {{on either side of the}} corridor and one at each end of it, from which the mosque probably obtained its name. These arches are surmounted by eleven domes in fair preservation; the mosque had originally thirty-three.|$|R
