Kinsey's work contains much that is valuable, but it must not be mistaken for the last word." [...] That same year, Kinsey appeared as a character in an episode of the Jack Benny TV program (September 15, 1953), in which he and his research were written into a sketch about Benny's 'fantasy' about Marilyn Monroe, a guest on the program.|$|E

40|$|Citations are {{regarded}} as measures of quality yet citation rates vary widely {{within each of the}} top finance journals. Since article ordering is at the discretion of editors, <b>lead</b> <b>articles</b> can be interpreted as signals of quality that academics can use to allocate their attention and assert the value of their publications. Advances in electronic journal access allow researchers to directly access articles, suggesting article ordering may be less relevant today. We confirm the past importance of <b>lead</b> <b>articles</b> by examining citation rates from published papers as well as the wider source of papers that are listed in Google Scholar. Our findings also confirm using Google Scholar as a citation source provides congruent results to using citations from articles published in ISI-listed journals, with the additional benefit of it potentially being more timely since it includes wider citation sources, inclusive of working and conference papers.

The NME featured an interview with the Super Furry Animals, several weeks before the release of the album in the United Kingdom, as the <b>lead</b> <b>article</b> in an issue which discussed the [...] "nu-psychedelia" [...] musical genre, which they saw Guerrilla as exemplifying. Gruff Rhys has stated, however, that he sees the album as a quite conventional pop album, and that he associates psychedelia with improvisation whereas Guerrilla was [...] "almost entirely preconceived". The singer has also said that the album is not a radical departure for the group musically, although it is [...] "more groovy and uptempo [...] more textured and punchy" [...] than the band's previous releases, partly due to the mix which creates a [...] "more American sound". Spin stated that the record combines [...] "prog, glam, techno, and garage" [...] and is the [...] "gleeful missing link in the psych-prog continuum". Select stated that the album juxtaposes pop songs with [...] "rambling odities" [...] and is dominated by the [...] "electronic throbs and pulses" [...] of keyboard player Cian Ciaran at the expense of guitarist Huw Bunford. The magazine {{went on to say that}} Gruff Rhys's voice anchors the record and gives life to songs which otherwise might seem to be works-in-progress, citing [...] "Chewing Chewing Gum" [...] as an example.|$|E

40|$|This forum {{article is}} the product of {{interdisciplinary}} discussion at a conference on climate histories held in Cambridge, United Kingdom, in early 2011, with the specific aim of building a network around the issue of communicating cultural knowledge of environmental change. The <b>lead</b> <b>articles,</b> by Kirsten Hastrup as an anthropologist and Simon Schaffer as a historian of science, highlight the role of agents and proxies. These are followed by five interdisciplinary commentaries, which engage with the <b>lead</b> <b>articles</b> through new ethnographic material, and a set of shorter commentaries by leading scholars of different disciplines. Finally, the lead authors respond to the discussion. In this debate, climate change does not emerge as a single preformed “problem. ” Rather, different climate knowledges appear as products of particular networks and agencies. Just as the identification of proxies creates agents (ice, mountains, informants) by inserting them into new networks, we hope that these cross-disciplinary exchanges will produce further conversations and new approaches to action...|$|R
