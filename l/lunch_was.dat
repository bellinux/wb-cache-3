5|$|Dining hall {{protocol}} was a scripted process, including a whistle system to indicate which block and tier of men would move {{into and out}} of the hall at any given time, who sat where, where to place hands, and when to start eating. Prisoners would be awakened at 6:30, and sent to breakfast at 6:55. A breakfast menu is still preserved on the hallway board, dated 21 March 1963. The breakfast menu included assorted dry cereals, steamed whole wheat, a scrambled egg, milk, stewed fruit, toast, bread, and butter. <b>Lunch</b> <b>was</b> served in the dining hall at 11:20, followed by a 30-minute rest in the cell, before returning to work until 16:15. Dinner was served at 16:25 and the prisoners would then retire to their cells at 16:50 to be locked in for the night. Inmates were permitted to eat as much as they liked within 20 minutes, provided they left no waste; waste would be reported and may make the prisoner subject to removal of privileges if they made a habit of it.|$|E
5|$|On 17 September, his <b>lunch</b> <b>was</b> {{interrupted}} {{when the}} British 1st Airborne Division {{dropped into the}} town launching Operation Market Garden, the Allied attempt to capture the bridges on the lower Rhine, Maas and Waal. Model initially thought {{they were trying to}} capture him and his staff, but the soon-apparent scale of the assault quickly convinced him otherwise. When he perceived what the Allies' real objective was, he ordered the II SS Panzer Corps into action. The corps, containing the 9th SS Panzer and 10th SS Panzer Divisions refitting after Normandy, had been overlooked by Allied intelligence. Whilst still seriously understrength, it was composed of veterans and was a deadly threat to lightly equipped paratroopers. 9th SS Panzer took on the British at Arnhem, while the 10th moved south to defend the bridge at Nijmegen.|$|E

50|$|With {{the opening}} of the new school, a hot <b>lunch</b> program <b>was</b> started in 1914. <b>Lunches</b> <b>were</b> {{prepared}} in the classroom and cost five cents. Many of the vegetables used in the <b>lunches</b> <b>were</b> grown in the school garden. The school’s garden products even earned Beardsley an award at the 1915 Panama Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco.|$|R

25|$|Arlott had {{developed}} a close friendship with Sir Jack Hobbs, who ran a sports shop in Fleet Street after his retirement from cricket. His admiration and respect led him to establish the Master's Club to honour the great man's birthday, on 16 December. The inaugural <b>lunch</b> <b>was</b> held in 1953 {{at a restaurant in}} Fleet Street and was attended by John Marshall (London Evening News), Kenneth Adam (BBC) and Alf Gover (Surrey). Membership of the club increased over the years and the annual <b>lunch</b> <b>was</b> eventually moved to the Long Room at The Oval. Despite the demise of all of the original members, it still thrives and continues to meet for lunch every year either on, or close to, Hobbs' 16 December birthday. In keeping with tradition, the lunch always consists of Sir Jack's favourite meal, roast lamb followed by apple pie.|$|E
25|$|The {{day began}} in similar vein to the {{previous}} one with India losing their remaining 6 wickets {{in the space of}} 15 overs closing their innings on 201. James Anderson got his career best bowling figures of 5/42 in this innings. Andrew Strauss and Alastair Cook negotiated the final two overs of the session before <b>lunch</b> <b>was</b> taken.|$|E
25|$|The Association runs {{an annual}} reunion dinner in September {{of each year}} and, on a more {{intermittent}} basis, reunions for the various year groups, most recently for those at the School under the headmastership of Mr E H Hensley or Mr J A Cockshutt. In 2015, a <b>lunch</b> <b>was</b> held at the Royal Air Force Club to mark Mr G D Ironside's 25th anniversary as Headmaster, at which many Old Suttonians were present.|$|E

25|$|Omar and Nafees {{opened for}} Bangladesh {{once again and}} showed some {{resistance}} scoring 47 before Javed Omar edged a bouncer of Lasith Malinga and {{was caught in the}} 16th over by Sangakkara. Shahriar Nafees was the first Bangladeshi to get a half century in this Test reaching it in 70 balls. Soon after Habibul Bashar was bowled by Muralitharan and Bangladesh were 98/2. 6 more overs were played in the morning session before play was stopped due to rain and <b>lunch</b> <b>was</b> taken early with the score at 106/2.|$|E
25|$|There {{is a total}} {{absence of}} comals, metates and manos meaning the Totonacs did not eat tortillas; however, even though corn was grown it did not form {{a large part of}} their diet. The Totonacs ate fruit, most notably zapotes, guavas, papayas, plantains and avocados. Men hunted and fished shark, turtle, deer, armadillo, opossums, and frogs. Women raised turkeys and dogs. Peasants as well as nobles ate corn {{porridge}} in the morning. <b>Lunch</b> <b>was</b> the main meal of the day and consisted of manioc, bean stew or even a rich meat sauce for the nobles. Fish and seafood as well as game was eaten by both nobles and farmers. The agave provided liquor.|$|E
25|$|Tortillas are {{consumed}} daily. Factory-made tortillas are widely sold, {{and they can}} easily be home-made. Tortilla production starts from early morning because <b>lunch</b> <b>is</b> the main meal of the day for most people.

25|$|Michael Clarke {{returned}} to the crease {{at the start of}} Day 2 with a back brace, and put on a 51-run partnership with Steve Smith, before a rain delay left Smith stranded just 2 runs short of a century. The rain consistently fell and <b>lunch</b> <b>was</b> taken early. The players returned after lunch and Smith brought up his century in the first ball. Play was delayed once again just 2 overs later. Play resumed again and Clarke reached his own century as the pair quickly added another 50 before yet another rain delay. Play continued and more quick runs were added as Smith reached 150. Clarke then was dismissed by Karn Sharma for 128 and stumps were called just one over later because of bad light. Shami, Aaron and Karn Sharma took two wickets each.|$|E
25|$|On 10 August 1852, {{a general}} holiday was {{declared}} in Elgin and Lossiemouth and {{the directors of}} the company along with other local dignitaries walked {{at the head of a}} procession from the town centre, at St Giles Church, to the station where accompanied by celebratory cannon firing, they were given a rousing send off. Some people instead walked to Lossiemouth to see the train arrive. The board of the Elgin and Lossiemouth Harbour Company met the passengers and escorted them to the recently opened Steamboat and Railway Hotel where they were entertained. They then proceeded to a large marquee erected overlooking the station on top of the quarry cliffs where many people made fine speeches before <b>lunch</b> <b>was</b> served. The celebrations included sports and games. The Board and prominent citizens met later that evening for a commemorative dinner. The trains ran all day until midnight and carried around 3000 passengers.|$|E
25|$|When a thick {{cloud of}} black smoke was spotted on Yermak, the Soviet {{icebreaker}} turned back east without firing a shot and called in reinforcements – her crew had mistaken Tarmo for the Finnish coastal defence ship Väinämöinen and ordered an airstrike against the ship they {{thought to be the}} most powerful warship of the Finnish Navy. In the meantime Tarmo opened fire on Kazakhstan. However, the guns malfunctioned again and only two shells were fired from the stern gun at the Soviet ship some seven miles away, both of which fell short. Continuing the naval engagement without operational guns was deemed futile and a decision was made to turn back to Kotka and return once the guns could be used again. On the way back the Soviet fighters and bombers attacked Tarmo several times, but none of the planes scored a hit on the Finnish icebreaker due to intense anti-aircraft fire. Around half past noon Tarmo arrived in Kotka and <b>lunch</b> <b>was</b> served for the crew.|$|E

25|$|Burroughs {{moved into}} a rundown hotel in the Latin Quarter of Paris in 1959 when Naked <b>Lunch</b> <b>was</b> {{still looking for a}} publisher. Tangier, with its {{political}} unrest, and criminals with whom he had become involved, became dangerous to Burroughs. He went to Paris to meet Ginsberg and talk with Olympia Press. He left behind a criminal charge which eventually caught up to him to Paris. Paul Lund, a British former career criminal and cigarette smuggler whom Burroughs met in Tangier, was arrested on suspicion of importing narcotics into France. Lund gave up Burroughs, and evidence implicated Burroughs in the importation of narcotics into France. When the Moroccan authorities forwarded their investigation to French officials,Burroughs faced criminal charges in Paris for conspiracy to import opiates. It was during this impending case that Maurice Girodias published Naked Lunch; its appearance helped to get Burroughs a suspended sentence, since a literary career, according to Ted Morgan, is a respected profession in France.|$|E
25|$|Rain {{had fallen}} for {{considerable}} time overnight, making the pitch difficult, though MacLaren and Palairet cut 36 off the target before <b>lunch</b> <b>was</b> taken. Palairet was then bowled by Saunders, and Tyldesley and MacLaren followed, the latter caught {{far out in}} the field by Duff for 35. Australia's Saunders then dropped Abel before rain stopped play again. After the break, England's batsmen were instructed to hit out. Abel added 20 with Ranjitsinhji, who looked uncertain against Trumble and was eventually given lbw, and Trumble and Saunders kept at the English batsmen. Abel was bowled trying to drive, Jackson caught at mid off, Braund stumped, and Lockwood bowled, England now requiring 11 to win with two wickets in hand. Rhodes came in and struck a boundary, and Lilley hit two scoring shots to take the tally to 116, before Hill, starting from long on, took a brilliant running catch square in the deep, in front of the pavilion, to dismiss him when the ball, albeit held up in the wind, had seemed sure to go for four.|$|E

The Grand Dukes were permitted to exercise a half-hour to 45 minutes twice a day, although the personal contact allowed in Vologda was denied them here at first. Their wardens, all of whom were soldiers, treated them well; they even helped the grand dukes smuggle out letters. After several days they were all allowed to gather in the courtyard and were permitted some provisions from the outside such as fresh linens and cigarettes. Their day began at 7 am when they were awakened by the steps in the hall of their jailers and the clank of their keys in the door. <b>Lunch</b> <b>was</b> served at noon, which consisted of dirty hot water with a few fish bones on it and black bread. The lights were turned on in the cells at 7 pm, although as the winter approached, the prisoners had to sit in darkness until that time. The meetings of the grand dukes during exercise gave them opportunity to exchange a few words.|$|E

25|$|On Christmas Day {{a special}} dinner was {{prepared}} by the 4 RAR/NZ cooks and trucked to the battalion at FSB Sandpiper in AO Kilcoy. Likewise with 1 RAR still deployed in AO Wondai, a Christmas <b>lunch</b> <b>was</b> prepared and flown to the rifle companies, while the Australians at FSB Julia also enjoyed a traditional Christmas Day lunch, with the other ranks served by the officers and sergeants. Although the allied units continued to observe the cease-fire {{there were a number}} of minor violations initiated by Viet Cong and North Vietnamese units. Soon after lunch an RPG round destroyed an American jeep on Route 15, and a number of Australian tanks and APCs, along with the Task Force Headquarters Defence and Employment Platoon were reacted. The Australians engaged the area with machine-gun fire and the infantry swept the area, uncovering numerous tracks but little else. Later, in AO Wondai 10 Platoon 1RAR was fired on by two Viet Cong at 14:07, and they subsequently captured an AK-47. Meanwhile, over the evening of 25/26 December South Vietnamese forces at FSB Barbara in AO Moose came under small arms and mortar fire, suffering a number of wounded. In AO Wondai on 26 December A, B, and C Companies 1 RAR were to redeploy to new ambush locations, while D Company moved north to ambush Route 320 following a further extension of the area of operations. At 09:55, while moving to a new position 8 Platoon, C Company contacted seven Viet Cong carrying packs filled with food, clothes and detonators, killing two and capturing an AK-47.|$|E
