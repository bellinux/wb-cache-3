5|$|Blackman's {{guilty verdict}} {{led to a}} showing of {{public support for the}} Marine, with people {{creating}} social media groups and online petitions alternately asking that he be given a lenient sentence and calling for his release. The Daily Telegraph supported one Change.org petition for <b>leniency.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} month, during parliamentary {{debates on}} major {{revisions to the}} Criminal Procedure Code, Lim suggested {{there was a need}} to improve pre-trial disclosure procedures and to ensure that victims of crimes received redress. Further, she expressed concerns over the <b>leniency</b> of community-based sentencing. The bill eventually incorporated several of her suggestions.|$|E
5|$|In an {{adjacent}} sector, a short truce {{to bury the}} dead between the lines led to official repercussions; a company commander, Sir Iain Colquhoun of the Scots Guards, was court-martialled for defying standing orders to the contrary. While he was found guilty and reprimanded, the punishment was annulled by General Haig and Colquhoun remained in his position; the official <b>leniency</b> may perhaps have been because he was related to H. H. Asquith, the Prime Minister.|$|E
5000|$|Me’ah Ḳūloth (still in {{manuscript}} form) - {{a collection}} of one-hundred <b>leniencies</b> practised by the Jewish community of Sana’a {{with respect to the}} lungs of ritually slaughtered animals.|$|R
40|$|Mass media play a {{major role}} in educating people, and {{influence}} their intellectual <b>leniencies</b> and social and political viewpoints, to make them take part in the change dynamics and durable development. Television is considered one of the strongest and most influencing mass media the fact that it provides picture, sound and performance makes it an important tool in the making of the people’s viewpoints, behaviours and <b>leniencies</b> politically as well as socially. The Algerian TV in relation to the political and social socialization has tried to develop the news contents at the level of technologies and news programmes volumes and their diversification for the Algerian viewers...|$|R
50|$|In {{a series}} of responsa {{on the subject of}} Niddah in December 2006, the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of Conservative Judaism reaffirmed a {{requirement}} that Conservative women use a mikveh monthly following the end of the niddah period following menstruation, while adapting certain <b>leniencies</b> including reducing the length of the period. The three responsa adapted permit a range of approaches from an opinion reaffirming the traditional ritual to an opinion declaring the concept of ritual purity does not apply outside the Temple in Jerusalem, proposing a new theological basis for the ritual, adapting new terminology including renaming the observances related to menstruation from taharat hamishpacha family purity to kedushat hamishpaha holiness to reflect the view that the concept of ritual purity is no longer considered applicable, and adopting certain <b>leniencies</b> including reducing the length of the niddah period.|$|R
5|$|On June 11, {{two days}} after the murder, police arrested their suspect. Hayden {{provided}} a confession and subsequently pleaded guilty in court. Hayden's legal representative, Randolph Williams, urged the judge to show <b>leniency</b> because the suspect had shown remorse for his crime from the moment of his arrest. The judge, Justice Basil Reid, sentenced Hayden to life in prison with the possibility of parole after fifteen years.|$|E
5|$|Paying {{money to}} enemy {{subjects}} – some of Speyer's friends had made claims at the Frankfurt bank for payment of sums {{due to them}} {{that were in the}} hands of Speyer in London. Speyer had authorised the payments, although this was not allowed by the wartime regulations. The committee commented that in similar circumstances it had shown <b>leniency</b> to others doing the same thing, and would not have attached great importance to the matter if it had stood alone.|$|E
5|$|Students {{continued}} {{to occupy the}} library and challenge governmental control by raiding a brothel. They also kidnapped ten Chinese nationals, {{as well as several}} law enforcement officials, women, and children. The approach taken by the Pakistani government in dealing with mosque issues led to accusations of <b>leniency</b> on the part of Musharraf, who felt he was too soft. After exchanging fire with Pakistani troops, students set fire to a Ministry of Environment building near Lal Masjid.|$|E
25|$|A fourth {{difference}} suggested, {{relates to}} the acceptability of moderation within Jewish law. Both Modern Orthodoxy and Ultra Orthodoxy regard Halakha as divine in origin, and as such, no position is assumed without justification in the Shulchan Aruch and in the Acharonim. The movements differ, however, in their approach to strictures (chumras) and <b>leniencies</b> (kulas).|$|R
5000|$|On November 23, 1936, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court {{denied the}} various Bruno family {{petitions}} for retrials. [...] Arrangements {{were made for}} their transfer to Eastern State Penitentiary. The two Republican members, Alvin Maurer and Philip Ehrig, of the County Commission ordered Warden Herbert Gosselin to allow even more <b>leniencies,</b> and unsupervised family visits increased. Commissioner Ehrig himself visited Bruno.|$|R
50|$|When the {{activity}} desired is itself only rabbinically prohibited, {{it may be}} permitted to tell a non-Jew to perform {{the activity}} for important reasons, such as a communal benefit (such as a power outage in the synagogue) or a mitzvah (such as circumcision). There are also <b>leniencies</b> {{in the event of}} a sick person, including even minor discomfort among very young children.|$|R
5|$|After two weeks, {{when the}} {{dealership}} had sold every print it had, Ortiz removed the display. In {{a letter to}} the editor of The New York Times, he accused Comstock of causing the controversy to earn greater publicity for himself, and stated that he wearied of crowds outside his shop, who blocked paying customers from entering it. Ultimately, Comstock did not pursue legal action. The historian Walter M. Kendrick attributes this apparent <b>leniency</b> to September Morn status as a work of art, whereas Gerald Carson, writing in American Heritage, attributes it to a knowledge that no action could be taken against the work.|$|E
5|$|At {{the trial}} in 1884, {{prosecutors}} implicated the sisters in the three other deaths in their household, {{as well as that}} of Thomas Higgins, with which they were officially charged. Catherine Flannagan's offer to provide evidence against other conspirators for the prosecution in exchange for <b>leniency</b> was refused. The sisters were found guilty and sentenced to be hanged. The sentence was carried out on 3 March 1884 at Kirkdale Prison, with the sisters attended to by a Roman Catholic priest. The deaths were witnessed by a reported one thousand people.|$|E
5|$|Canadian {{government}} policies such as official bilingualism; publicly funded health care; higher and more progressive taxation; outlawing capital punishment; strong efforts to eliminate poverty; strict gun control; <b>leniency</b> {{in regard to}} drug use, and, most recently, legalizing same-sex marriage are social indicators of Canada's political and cultural values. American media and entertainment are popular, if not dominant, in English Canada; conversely, many Canadian cultural products and entertainers are successful in the United States and worldwide. The Government of Canada has also influenced culture with programs, laws and institutions. It has created Crown corporations to promote Canadian culture through media and has also tried to protect Canadian culture by setting legal minimums on Canadian content.|$|E
25|$|In December 2006, Conservative Judaism's Committee on Jewish Law and Standards issued three responsa on {{the subject}} of Niddah. All three ruled the {{traditional}} requirements of ritual washing remained in effect for Conservative Jews (with some <b>leniencies</b> and liberalization of interpretation), but disagreed on the reasoning for continuing this practices {{as well as on the}} validity of specific <b>leniencies.</b> Two of the opinions reflect reasoning similar to the respective Orthodox views (Biblical requirements or rabbinic ordinances enacted in remembrance of the Temple.) A third opinion expressed the view that Conservative Judaism should disconnect ritual purity practices from the Temple in Jerusalem or its memory, and offered a new approach based on what it called the concept of holiness rather than the concept of purity. Thus, Conservative ideology, under its philosophy of pluralism, supports a range of views on this subject, from views similar to the Orthodox view to views expressing a need for a contemporary reorientation. Most Conservative Jews do not observe the laws of niddah.|$|R
30|$|With {{regards to}} cheating, {{diversity}} of opinion among interviewed teachers seemed {{to coincide with}} the number of years teaching. While teachers with more than ten years of teaching experience found cheating “unacceptable,” other teachers with less than five years of teaching experience showed more <b>leniencies</b> in dealing with student cheating, often by issuing verbal warnings and – as one teacher reported – allowing cheating students to “re-test” at a later date.|$|R
50|$|Bein Hashemashot (בֵּין הַשְּׁמָשׁוֹת, {{literally}} {{between the}} suns) is {{the period between}} sunset and nightfall, and is considered a time of questionable status. On the Sabbath, festivals, and fast days the stringencies of both the previous and following days apply. For example, if the fast of Tish'a Ba'av immediately follows the Sabbath, the intervening Bein Hashemashot is forbidden in eating, drinking, and working. However, there are occasional <b>leniencies.</b>|$|R
5|$|It {{remains unclear}} {{precisely}} why Steuart {{was reluctant to}} pursue Banks' defeated army more vigorously, and contemporary records shed little light on the matter. It may be that his thirteen years' training as a cavalry officer led him to obey orders to the letter, {{with little or no}} room for personal initiative or variation from strict due process. No charges were brought against him however, despite Jackson's reputation as a stern disciplinarian. It is possible that Jackson's <b>leniency</b> {{had to do with the}} strong desire of the Confederacy to recruit Marylanders to the Southern cause, and the need to avoid offending Marylanders who might be tempted to join Lee's army.|$|E
5|$|Millennium Group {{consultant}} Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and Seattle Police Department detective Bob Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich) are hiking {{across the}} North Cascades when Black receives an urgent {{page from the}} Federal Bureau of Investigation. Travelling to the Behavioral Sciences Unit, Black learns that serial killer Ephraim Fabricant (Alex Diakun) has escaped from a hospital while donating a kidney to his sister. Fabricant was arrested and convicted due to the profile constructed by Black; although he was spared execution when Black asked for <b>leniency</b> {{in order to allow}} Fabricant's mind to be studied.|$|E
5|$|The conspirators {{first told}} Justin, Germanus's eldest son, of their intentions. He, in turn, {{informed}} his father, who then held counsel with the comes excubitorum, Marcellus. In {{order to find}} out more of their intentions, Germanus met the conspirators in person, while a trusted aide of Marcellus, named Leontius, was concealed nearby and listened in. Marcellus then informed Emperor Justinian, and the conspirators were arrested, but treated with remarkable <b>leniency.</b> At first, Germanus and his sons too were suspected, until the testimony of Marcellus and the commanders Constantianus and Bouzes cleared them.|$|E
25|$|References to ritual washing {{are found}} in the Hebrew Bible, and are {{elaborated}} in the Mishnah and Talmud. They have been codified in various codes of Jewish law and tradition, such as Maimonides' Mishneh Torah (12th century) and Joseph Karo's Shulchan Aruch (16th century.) These customs are most commonly observed within Orthodox Judaism. In Conservative Judaism, the practices are normative with certain <b>leniencies</b> and exceptions. Ritual washing is not generally performed in Reform Judaism.|$|R
25|$|The {{classical}} rabbis {{interpreted the}} biblical phrase heed my ordinance (Hebrew: ushmartem et mishmarti), which {{appears in the}} holiness code, to mean that they should (metaphorically) create a protective fence around the biblical laws, an attitude particularly expressed by The Ethics of the Fathers (a Mishnaic tractate discussing the ethics surrounding adherence to biblical rules). Nevertheless, the rabbis of the classical and Middle Ages also introduced a number of <b>leniencies.</b> Another prohibition on mixtures in Jewish law is kil'ayim.|$|R
25|$|In {{contemporary}} religious circles these rabbinic <b>leniencies</b> {{have received}} wide but not universal acceptance. In Israel, the Chief Rabbinate obtains permission from all farmers {{who wish to}} have their land sold. The land is then legally sold to a non-Jew for a large sum of money. The payment is made by a cheque post-dated to {{after the end of}} the Sabbatical year. When the cheque is returned or not honoured at the end of the year the land reverts to its original owners. Thus, the fields can be farmed with certain restrictions.|$|R
5|$|The rising {{forced a}} change of policy by the regime, which instead of {{attempting}} to replace the landholding classes now looked for a reconciliation with former Royalists and Engagers. This resulted in the Act of Grace and Pardon, proclaimed in Edinburgh on 5 May 1654. Instead of a blanket forfeiture among those implicated in resistance, it named 24 persons (mainly from the nobility) whose lands would be seized, and 73 other landholders who could retain their estates after paying a fine. Even then most of those names were treated with <b>leniency</b> and fines were remitted for confiscations, or were reduced, and some were abandoned.|$|E
5|$|When Rasputin {{was murdered}} in December 1916, Victoria and Kirill signed a letter along with other {{relatives}} asking the Tsar to show <b>leniency</b> to Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia, one of those implicated in the murder. The Tsar denied their request. Twice during the war Victoria visited Romania, where her sister Marie was now queen, volunteering aid for war victims. Victoria returned to Saint Petersburg in February 1917. Kirill had been appointed commander of the Naval Guards, quartered in Saint Petersburg, {{so he could be}} with his family for some time. Although publicly loyal to the Tsar, Victoria and Kirill began to meet in private with other relatives to discuss the best way to save the monarchy.|$|E
5|$|By October, Moreno's {{measures}} {{started to}} generate resistance among some who initially supported the May Revolution. Traders {{did not like}} the protectionist policy, and some members of the military had close ties with rich people and opposed their punishment. On October 16 it was discovered that ten members of the Cabildo had sworn loyalty to the Regency Council the past July, and they were all jailed. This included Julián Leiva and Juan José de Lezica. Moreno and Saavedra had a dispute when the Junta was deciding what to do. Moreno proposed executing them as a deterrent, accusing them of working with the Montevideo Cabildo, the enemy of the Junta. Saavedra replied that the government should promote <b>leniency,</b> and rejected the use of the Patricians Regiment to carry out such executions. The prisoners were finally exiled to Luján, Ranchos, and Salto, and Leiva was housed by Gregorio Funes in Córdoba.|$|E
2500|$|The last meeting, {{convened in}} Breslau (13–24 July 1846), {{was the most}} innocuous. The Sabbath, widely desecrated by the {{majority}} of German Jews, was discussed. Participants argued whether <b>leniencies</b> for civil servants should be enacted, but could not agree and released a general statement about its sanctity. Holdheim shocked the assembled when he proposed his [...] "Second Sabbath" [...] scheme, astonishing even the radical wing, and his motion was rejected offhand. They did vote to eliminate the Second Day of Festivals, noting it was both an irrelevant rabbinic ordinance and scarcely observed anyway.|$|R

5|$|In 59, the Romans {{marched to}} the south, towards Tigranocerta, Armenia's second capital city. On their way, Corbulo's men punished those who {{withstood}} or hid from them, while <b>leniency</b> was shown to those who surrendered. In the harsh, dry terrain of northern Mesopotamia, the army suffered from lack of provisions, especially water, {{until they reached the}} more fertile areas near Tigranocerta. During that time, a plot to murder Corbulo was uncovered and suppressed. Several Armenian nobles who had joined the Roman camp were implicated and executed. According to a story provided by Frontinus, when the Roman army arrived at Tigranocerta, they launched the severed head of one of the conspirators into the city. By chance, it landed right where the city council was assembled; they immediately decided to surrender the city, which was consequently spared. Shortly after, an attempt by the Parthian army under king Vologases to enter Armenia was blocked by Verulanus Severus, the commander of the auxiliaries.|$|E
5|$|In September 1937 Stalin {{dispatched}} Mikoyan, {{along with}} Georgy Malenkov and Lavrentiy Beria, {{with a list}} of 300 names to Yerevan, the capital of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR), to oversee the liquidation of the Communist Party of Armenia (CPA), which was largely made up of Old Bolsheviks. Mikoyan tried, but failed, to save one from being executed during his trip to Armenia. That person was arrested during one of his speeches to the CPA by Beria. Over a thousand people were arrested and seven of nine members of the Armenian Politburo were sacked from office. In several instances, he intervened on behalf of his colleagues; this <b>leniency</b> towards the persecuted may have been one reason why he was selected by Stalin to oversee the purges in the ASSR.|$|E
5|$|In {{sentencing}} Lawrence, {{the judges}} {{found no evidence}} to support her claim that her life was threatened and although the prosecutors requested a lighter 20-year sentence due to her early cooperation with police, the judges sentenced her to life imprisonment. On the next day, the remaining three defendants, Chen, Nguyen and Norman, were sentenced to life imprisonment as well. On 24 January 2006, the prosecutors demanded the death penalty for Sukumaran, this being {{the first time that a}} demand of death was put forward for any of the Bali Nine. They told the Bali court that there was no reason to show any <b>leniency</b> to the 24-year-old, because he helped organize the heroin smuggling operation. The prosecutors also claim that it was Sukumaran who strapped heroin to the bodies of his fellow accused. Indonesian police identified Sukumaran as one of the main players, in what they said to be a major smuggling ring. On 26 January, it was also recommended that Andrew Chan receive the death penalty.|$|E
2500|$|Who is he whose heart conspires to {{approach}} forcing congregations who practice {{according to the}} RaMBaM of blessed memory, to go by {{any one of the}} early or latter-day Torah authorities?! ... Is it not a case of a fortiori, that regarding the School of Shammai—that the halakhah does not go according to them—they [...] said ‘if [...] like the School of Shammai [...] according to their <b>leniencies</b> and their stringencies’: The RaMBaM, is the greatest of all the Torah authorities, and all the communities of the Land of Israel and the Arab-controlled lands and the West [...] practice according to his word, and accepted him upon themselves as their Chief Rabbi. Whoever practices according to him with his <b>leniencies</b> and his stringencies, why coerce them to budge from him? And all the more so if also their fathers and forefathers practiced accordingly: for their children are not to turn right or left from the RaMBaM of blessed memory. And even if communities that practice according to the Rosh or other authorities like him became the majority, they cannot coerce the minority of congregations practicing according to the RaMBaM of blessed memory, to practice like they do. And there is no issue here concerning the prohibition against having two courts in the same city , since every congregation should practice according to its original custom… ...|$|R
5000|$|Although the mitzvah of orlah {{is listed}} in the {{category}} of prohibitions pertaining to the Land of Israel alone ("מצווה שתלויה בארץ ישראל"), it is the only mitzvah of this category that applies outside of Israel as well - with certain <b>leniencies</b> (mishna, Kidushin ch. 1, Mishna 9). This application is forthcoming due to it being listed as a [...] "Halakhah LeMoshe MiSinai" [...] (a law given to Moses at Sinai, Sifra, 23:14). The tanna Rabbi Eliezer ben Hurcanus holds the opinion that the prohibition of orlah does not apply outside the land of Israel at all.|$|R
25|$|These {{differences}} {{reflect a}} general philosophical difference between Haredi Judaism, which emphasizes strict interpretations {{in order to}} prevent possible transgressions, and Modern Orthodox Judaism, which is more likely to utilize <b>leniencies</b> rooted in classical rabbinic sources. The difference has tended to increase the social distance between Haredi and Modern Orthodox Jews, as Haredi Jews who follow the stricter interpretation may find themselves unable to pray in some Modern Orthodox synagogues. As a result, and consistent with the general increasing influence of Haredi interpretations, many synagogues in recent years have raised the height of their mechitzot in order to accommodate members and guests who follow stricter interpretations.|$|R
