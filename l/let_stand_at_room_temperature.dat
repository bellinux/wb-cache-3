40|$|Antisera {{produced}} in rabbits by injection of pneumococcus in the R phase, or S phase {{as it has}} been termed by Dawson (1), have been examined mainly for their protective power (2). Since this proved to be low against the virulent S phase (Dawson M) little more has been recorded. However, in a study of an absolute, quantitative method for the estimation of agglutinins (3) it was found that accurate results could be obtained with pneumococcus R (Dawson S) {{as well as with the}} M phase (3, 4). The behavior of a number of anti-R (S) sera was studied with suspensions of acid-killed, heat-killed, and formalinized R (S) pneumococci, and quantitative precipitin estimations were also made with pneumococcus C substance (5). Relationships brought to light by this study are recorded in the present paper. EXPEI ~ IME.

40|$|Thermo-reversible gels are solvent-filled 3 D {{networks}} of polymer chains interconnected by physical (transient) crosslinks. On applying a high shear stress, the crosslinks are broken and these gels show a typical stress-strain behavior due to cohesive fracture of the gel. When heated above a critical temperature and cooled back to room temperature, all the crosslinks are re-formed. Interestingly, partial to full recovery of broken crosslinks is also observed by simply <b>letting</b> the gel <b>stand</b> <b>at</b> <b>room</b> temperature. In this study, the fracture and healing {{behavior of a}} model acrylic triblock copolymer gel has been characterized by shear rheometry. A mathematical model has also been proposed {{to better understand the}} mechanics at the molecular level and predict the healing time of a system. A rheo-PIV system was built as part of the project, to observe and confirm the bulk healing process in situ. Spontaneous self-healing behavior has immense potential in controlled drug delivery systems, coatings, food and various other applications. ...|$|R

Samples were taken from 18 concrete wall bunkers and from 3 different positions of freshly cut face: core or C, (1 meter high from the bottom), side or S (1. 5 meter high from the bottom, 0. 3 meter from the walls) and top or T (0. 5 meter from the top). Collected samples were stored at 4 °C and subjected within 24 h to electronic nose analysis (Pen 3 – Airsense AnalyticsGmbH, Schwerin, Germany) equipped with metal oxide semiconductor sensors (W 1 C, W 3 C, W 6 S, W 5 C, W 1 S, W 1 W, W 2 S, W 2 W, W 3 S). Each sample was weighed (20 g) into airtight glass jar, then jars were closed and <b>let</b> it <b>stand</b> <b>at</b> <b>room</b> temperature for 30 minutes to allow for headspace equilibrium. After reaching equilibrium, the headspace gas was pumped to sensors of the electronic nose (flow rate 400 ml/min). The measurement phase lasted 60 seconds with data collection interval of 1 second. A stand-by phase (320 seconds) was observed between each sample reading {{to allow for a}} cleaning of the system. Only one reading (at 59 second) for each sensor entered a data matrix of 54 rows (silage samples) and 9 columns (sensors). A correlation matrix was obtained from collected data and a principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using the FACTOR procedure of SAS. The PRIN method with Kaiser’s criterion (eigenvalue≥ 1. 00) and the orthogonal Varimax rotation were used to extract latent constructs and to produce loading vectors and sample scores. Three principal components (PC) were extracted: PC 1 (W 1 C, W 3 C, W 5 C, W 1 S, W 2 S, W 2 W; eigenvalue= 5. 60), PC 2 (W 6 S, W 3 S; eigenvalue= 1. 75), PC 3 (W 1 W; eigenvalue= 1. 00). The PC 1 allowed for clustering the silage samples into two populations being C and S+T, whereas the PC 2 and PC 3 tended to discriminate between S and T samples.
