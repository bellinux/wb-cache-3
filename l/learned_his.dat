5|$|Although he <b>learned</b> <b>his</b> {{repertoire}} {{by listening}} to elders perform traditional pieces, Rakoto Frah often performed personalized variations and interpreted the traditional airs in original ways. The themes addressed in his songs ranged from serious to light-hearted and could touch on social concerns, behavior and the description of places. Rakoto Frah used both traditional flutes and those he crafted himself using diverse locally available materials. These included flutes crafted from sections of metal ski poles, PVC pipes and plastic curtain rods. He was never known to be without a flute and was widely respected for his musical virtuosity and his kindness alike. Rakoto Frah described music {{the most important element}} of life, even more important to him than his own family. Over the course of his career, the artist produced more than 800pieces of instrumental and vocal music.|$|E

5|$|Born in Mitchell, Ontario to William Frederick Morenz and Rosena (Rose) Pauli, Howie Morenz {{had three}} sisters, Freda, Erma and Gertrude, and two brothers, Wilfred and Ezra. Morenz <b>learned</b> <b>his</b> hockey by playing shinny on the Thames River. At {{the age of}} eight, he played his first {{organized}} game as a goaltender, where he allowed 21 goals in a game. After that game, a coach switched Morenz to rover, a defensive position. Starting the 1916–17 junior season as a goaltender, Morenz became a forward when it became apparent his speed was much more suitable for an offensive role, and he helped the Mitchell ice hockey team win the Western Ontario junior championship. After the Morenz family moved to the nearby community of Stratford in May 1917, Morenz tried enlisting in the Canadian military but was refused when recruiters learned he was only 15years old.|$|E
5|$|Despite these difficulties, the Channel Fleet was {{possessed of}} one of the best naval commanders of the age; its commander-in-chief, Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe, had <b>learned</b> <b>his</b> trade under Sir Edward Hawke and fought at the Battle of Quiberon Bay in 1759. In the spring of 1794, with the French convoy's arrival in European waters imminent, Howe had {{dispersed}} his fleet in three groups. George Montagu, in HMS Hector, was sent with six ships of the line and two frigates to guard British convoys to the East Indies, West Indies and Newfoundland as far as Cape Finisterre. Peter Rainier, in HMS Suffolk and commanding six other ships, was to escort the convoys {{for the rest of their}} passage. The third force consisted of 26 ships of the line, with several supporting vessels, under Howe's direct command. They were to patrol the Bay of Biscay for the arriving French.|$|E

5|$|Impressed with Abovian's {{thirst for}} knowledge, Parrot {{arranged}} for a Russian state scholarship for Abovian to study at the University of Dorpat in 1830. He entered the university directly without additional preparation and studied in the Philosophy faculty of the Philological-Historical department from September 3, 1830 until January 18, 1836. The years in Dorpat were very fruitful for Abovian who studied social and natural sciences, European literature and philosophy, and mastered German, Russian, French and Latin. At this time Abovian fell {{under the influence of}} German Romanticism. In addition, Abovian established numerous contacts with European intellectuals of the time. At the university he became friends with the sons of Nikolay Karamzin who studied with him. In 1834 Abovian visited his cousin Maria (daughter of melik Sahak Aghamalian) in St. Petersburg, then married to the Georgian Prince Alexander. Prior to graduation, Abovian <b>learned</b> <b>his</b> mother Takuhi had died.|$|E
5|$|Monica Grey played Paula Quatermass; she {{was chosen}} by BBC {{management}} rather than the production team, as she was {{the wife of the}} BBC's head of radio drama, Val Gielgud. As Hugh Griffith also had problems with some of his technical dialogue, Grey <b>learned</b> <b>his</b> lines as well as her own, in case she needed to step in and assist him during the live performance. Dillon was played by John Stone; Stone too had a long career as a supporting actor in a range of British television series, and in 1956 had a small role in the film X the Unknown, which Hammer Film Productions had intended as a sequel to their version of The Quatermass Experiment, until Kneale denied them the rights to use the character.|$|E
5|$|Second, Giáp made {{a mistake}} in Nà Sản by {{committing}} his forces to reckless frontal attacks before being fully prepared. He <b>learned</b> <b>his</b> lesson: at Điện Biên Phủ, Giáp spent months meticulously stockpiling ammunition and emplacing heavy artillery and antiaircraft guns before making his move. Teams of Viet Minh volunteers were sent into the French camp to scout the disposition of the French artillery. Wooden artillery pieces were built as decoys and the real guns were rotated every few salvos to confuse French counterbattery fire. As a result, when the battle finally began, the Viet Minh knew exactly where the French artillery pieces were, while the French did not even know how many guns Giáp possessed.|$|E

5|$|Sir Ralph David Richardson (19 December 1902– 10 October 1983) was an English actor who, {{along with}} his contemporaries John Gielgud and Laurence Olivier, {{dominated}} the British stage of the mid-20th century. He worked in films throughout most of his career, and played more than sixty cinema roles. From an artistic but not theatrical background, Richardson had had no thought of a stage career until a production of Hamlet in Brighton inspired him to become an actor. He <b>learned</b> <b>his</b> craft in the 1920s with a touring company and later the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. In 1931 he joined the Old Vic, playing mostly Shakespearean roles. He led the company the following season, succeeding Gielgud, who had taught him much about stage technique. After he left the company, a series of leading roles took him to stardom in the West End and on Broadway.|$|E
5|$|Armand Assante and Antonio Banderas were Glimcher's ideal {{choices for}} the roles of Cesar and Nestor Castillo. Prior to The Mambo Kings, Assante had {{appeared}} {{in a number of}} films but had not yet broken out as a major star. Banderas, a Spanish actor, had moved to Los Angeles, California, hoping to make an international debut with his first English speaking role. Warner Bros., however, wanted to cast Jeremy Irons as Cesar and Ray Liotta as Nestor. Both actors had received critical acclaim for their performances in Reversal of Fortune and Goodfellas respectively, and the studio felt that they would appeal to a wider audience. Through a translator, Glimcher told Banderas to work on improving his English for one month before performing a screen test opposite Irons. The Spanish actor, lacking the ability to speak English, <b>learned</b> <b>his</b> lines phonetically. Despite Irons's excellent screen test, Glimcher thought he was wrong for the part and insisted on Assante; he thought the charm and seductiveness of Assante made him perfect for the role, and the studio eventually gave in.|$|E
5|$|Chappuis {{was drafted}} by the Pittsburgh Steelers, and reports in February 1948 {{indicated}} that the Steelers had offered him a two-year contract for $20,000 per year. However, Chappuis passed up the Steelers' offer, opting instead {{to play for the}} new All-America Football Conference (AAFC). In June 1948, Chappuis signed with Branch Rickey's Brooklyn Dodgers of the AAFC after coach Carl Voyles outbid the Steelers for his services at $17,000. Chappuis had been drafted by the Cleveland Browns, and the Dodgers gave the Browns three draft picks in exchange for the right to sign Chappuis. Rickey had felt that modern football was based on speed and that he could win with a good center, passing quarterback and two tall sprinting ends. Thus, he placed a premium on signing Chappuis, the passing quarterback. The college All-star game caused Chappuis to miss three weeks of practice and he played little in the early season games because he had not <b>learned</b> <b>his</b> plays.|$|E
