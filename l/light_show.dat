50|$|Like Liquid <b>Light</b> <b>Shows,</b> {{the base}} of a Liquid Light Artefact is water, waterdye, oil and oildye on a glass scale, above a lightsource. Additionally colourwheels, prisms, {{magnifying}} glasses, marbles and other transparent objects are used. The last decennia digital editing is being used increasingly. Different from Liquid <b>Light</b> <b>Shows,</b> the Liquid <b>Light</b> Artefact is a motionless still, instead of a moving scene. Also, usually Liquid <b>Light</b> <b>Shows</b> are projected on a wall or screen, whereas Liquid Light Art is printed on concrete material. Therefor it desires an advanced photographing and printing technique.|$|R
5|$|The album's release {{coincided with}} Jarre's first foreign tour. In 1981 the British Embassy gave Radio Beijing copies of Oxygène and Équinoxe, {{which became the}} first pieces of foreign music to be played on Chinese {{national}} radio in decades. The republic invited Jarre {{to become the first}} western musician to play there, with Les Concerts en Chine. The performances were scheduled to run from 18 October to 5 November 1981. The first, in Beijing, was initially attended mostly by officials, but before the concert began technicians realised that not enough power was available to supply the stage and auditorium. Chinese officials solved the problem by temporarily cutting power to the surrounding districts. The stadium was almost full when the concert began, but as Beijing's buses stopped running at about 10 o'clock, about half the audience left before it finished. To boost the audience attendance for the second night, Jarre and his production team purchased some of the concert tickets and gave them to children on the streets (Jarre originally wanted the concerts to be free, but the Chinese authorities decided to charge between £0.20 and £0.50 per ticket). The event was notable for its lack of audience involvement; the Chinese were apparently unmoved by both the music and the <b>light</b> <b>show,</b> and applause was muted. The second venue, in Shanghai, was a different matter. Jarre actively encouraged audience participation by stepping into the crowd, which became much more exuberant than that in Beijing. Recordings of the concerts, which featured one of Jarre's signature electronic instruments, the laser harp, were released as a double-disc LP in 1982.|$|E

However, the crowd was no smaller than in previous years, possibly because a scaled-down version of the <b>light</b> <b>show</b> was being held at different venue with a similar name.|$|E
