25|$|In the 6th and 7th centuries AD, Slavic people invaded {{northern}} Greece and {{competed with}} the Greek ethnic population of Macedonia, although over time adopting the Christian Orthodox religion and Cyrillic script from Greek Macedonians. and Slavic languages have been spoken {{in the area}} alongside Greek in the region ever since. In parts of northern Greece, in the regions of Macedonia (Μακεδονία) and Thrace (Θράκη), Slavic languages continue to be spoken by people {{with a wide range}} of self-identifications. The actual <b>linguistic</b> <b>classification</b> of these dialects is unclear, although most linguists will classify them as either Bulgarian or Macedonian Slavic taking into account numerous factors, including the resemblance and mutual intelligibility of each dialect to the standard languages (abstand), and the self-identification of the speakers themselves. As however the vast majority of these people have a Greek national identity, linguists will make their decisions based on abstand alone. The Slavic-speaking minority of northern Greece can be divided in two main groups: Orthodox Christians and Muslims, primarily the Pomaks of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace. The latter has no reported connection to ethnic Macedonians.|$|E
25|$|In recent decades, a {{significant}} number of Anioma indigenes have grown resentful towards the wider Igbo community and questioned {{whether or not they are}} “truly” Igbo, with many histories of Anioma towns being allegedly re-written to showcase a non-Igbo wave of migration and ethno-linguistic background. Many claim descent from the ancient Benin Kingdom, a movement which has been garnering more and more support following the stigmatisation that followed the Nigerian Civil War. Introspection of the Igbo denial in Delta State, however, may generally reveal that it is strongest in the Ndokwa and Ika territories and weakest among the Enuani, the latter of whom inhabit the Aniocha and Oshimili local government areas. Many theories have been postulated to explain this occurrence. Of particular interest, it has been suggested that the Ika were an aboriginal Igbo clan, with later migrations of settlers from the Benin Kingdom, owing to close proximity. The absorption of Edoid-speaking ethnic groups into Ika territory may have resulted in the attendant strong influence on the aborigines, in cultural and linguistic terms, providing fertile soil for Igbo denial. The same phenomenon may apply to the Ukwuani but, by virtue of less proximity with Edo State, to a lesser extent. Although many Ika and Ukwuani people maintain distinct cultural identities, they yet speak Igbo languages. The term Igbo itself has been conceived by many as a <b>linguistic</b> <b>classification,</b> encompassing all bia-speaking clans and with ethnic identity falling secondary to linguistic designation. As earlier mentioned, they are officially recognised as distinct ethnic groups from the Igbo.|$|E

2500|$|Against Strabo, Pliny {{considers}} the Lepontii as a Celtic tribe {{akin to the}} Taurisci and classifies the Camunni as a tribe of the Euganei people of northeast Italy, together with the Trumplini of the neighbouring valley, Val Trompia. However, neither of Pliny's comments is fatal to {{the identification of the}} Lepontii and Camunni as Raeti. The Lepontic language has been definitively classified as a distinct Continental Celtic language (e.g. Lejeune 1971, Koch 2008). As for the Euganei, their <b>linguistic</b> <b>classification</b> is uncertain due to scanty evidence. It is possible that their speech was also related to Etruscan, possibly a sub-group of Tyrsenian languages. Alternatively their language may have been Indo-European, akin to that of their close neighbours, the Celts or the Veneti (whose language, shares several similarities with Latin and the Italic languages, but also has some affinities with other IE languages, especially Germanic and Celtic).|$|E
2500|$|Ethnic Macedonians self-identify as [...] "Macedonians" [...] (Macedonian: Македонци, Makedonci) in {{an ethnic}} sense {{as well as}} in the {{regional}} sense. They are the second largest ethnic group in the region. Because of their primarily Slavic origin they are also known as [...] "Macedonian Slavs" [...] and [...] "Slav Macedonians" [...] (Greek: Σλαβομακεδόνες, [...] "Slavomakedones"). They form the majority of the population in the Republic of Macedonia where according to the 2002 census, approximately 1,300,000 people declared themselves as Macedonians. According to the latest Bulgarian census held in 2001, there are 3,117 people declaring themselves ethnic Macedonians in the Blagoevgrad Province of Bulgaria (Pirin Macedonia). The official number of ethnic Macedonians in Bulgaria is 5,071. A relatively small number of ethnic Macedonians exist among the Slavic-speakers of Greek Macedonia. There has not been a census in Greece on the question of mother tongue since 1951, when the census recorded 41,017 Slavic-speakers, mostly in the West Macedonia periphery of Greece. The <b>linguistic</b> <b>classification</b> of the Slavic dialects spoken by these people can be either Bulgarian or Macedonian, although the people themselves call their language [...] "Slavic". Most of these people declare themselves as ethnic Greeks (Slavophone Greeks), although there are small groups espousing ethnic Macedonian and Bulgarian national identities. In the 1989 Albanian census, approximately 5,000 Albanian citizens declared themselves Macedonians.|$|E

40|$|German genitive {{attributes}} {{are usually}} tagged as such in treebanks. However, {{it is well}} known that this information is not sufficient for determining the type of relation between head nouns and attributes, as genitive attributes can express many different semantic relations. Various <b>linguistic</b> <b>classifications</b> have been worked out, but to my knowledge, nobody has so far proposed to apply this linguistic knowledge to a corpus. The challenge here is to come up with a classification that is both easy to verify and sufficiently fine-grained. Using earlier linguistic approaches as guidelines, I propose in this paper a detailed annotation scheme for German genitive attributes based on readily identifiable noun features. First insights from its application to the Smultron Treebank show that it is easy to distinguish between the proposed classes and that my classification of genitive attributes can be related to a more general semantic annotation level...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{present the results}} of an {{empirical}} study into the cognitive reality of existing classifications of modality using Polish data. We analyzed random samples of 250 independent observations for the 7 most frequent modal words (móc, można, musieć, należy, powinien, trzeba, wolno), extracted from the Polish national corpus. Observations were annotated for modal type according to a number of classifications, including van der Auwera and Plungian (1998), as well as for morphological, syntactic and semantic properties using the Behavioral Profiling approach (Divjak and Gries 2006). Multiple correspondence analysis and (polytomous) regression models were used to determine how well modal type and usage align. These corpus-based findings were validated experimentally. In a forced choice task, naive native speakers were exposed to definitions and prototypical examples of modal types or functions, then labeled a number of authentic corpus sentences accordingly. In the sorting task, naive native speakers sorted authentic corpus sentences into semantically coherent groups.

40|$|In this article, we are {{studying}} {{the differences between the}} European Union languages using statistical and unsupervised methods. The analysis is conducted in the different levels of language: the lexical, morphological and syntactic. Our premise is that the difficulty of the translation could be perceived as differences or similarities in different levels of language. The results are compared to linguistic groupings. Two approaches are selected for the analysis. A Kolmogorov complexity based approach is used to compare the language structure in syntactic and morphological levels. A morpheme-level comparison is conducted based on an automated segmentation of the languages into morpheme-like units. The way the languages convey information in these levels is taken as a measure of similarity or dissimilarity between languages and the results are compared to classical <b>linguistic</b> <b>classifications.</b> The results {{have a significant impact on}} the design of (statistical) machine translation systems.

40|$|Language is a {{hallmark}} of our species and understanding linguistic diversity {{is an area of}} major interest. Genetic factors influencing the cultural transmission of language provide a powerful and elegant explanation for aspects of the present day linguistic diversity and a window into the emergence and evolution of language. In particular, it has recently been proposed that linguistic tone—the usage of voice pitch to convey lexical and grammatical meaning—is biased by two genes involved in brain growth and development, ASPM and Microcephalin. This hypothesis predicts that tone is a stable characteristic of language because of its ‘genetic anchoring’. The present paper tests this prediction using a Bayesian phylogenetic framework applied to a large set of linguistic features and language families, using multiple software implementations, data codings, stability estimations, <b>linguistic</b> <b>classifications</b> and outgroup choices. The results of these different methods and datasets show a large agreement, suggesting that this approach produces reliable estimates of the stability of linguistic data. Moreover, linguistic tone is found to be stable across methods and datasets, providing suggestive support for the hypothesis of genetic influences on its distribution...|$|R
