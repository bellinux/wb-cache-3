5000|$|Males of {{the species}} may, presumably by mistake, attempt to mate with other bee species which are using the same {{foraging}} areas as female leaf cutters. They follow several inches behind their intended partner, whether a <b>leaf</b> <b>cutter</b> or bumble bee, which is moving around a plant seeking a flower; then when the target does alight, the male <b>leaf</b> <b>cutter</b> darts rapidly onto the target's back. This causes bumble bees and nonreceptive female leaf cutters {{to move to another}} flower and in the process shed the male <b>leaf</b> <b>cutter.</b> The male may then move right to the next prospect, or may first stop for a sip of nectar.|$|E

Second, I show the peculiarities of the parasitoids attacking behaviors towards their host as well as the responses or ant defenses against the phorids exhibited by their hosts. Third, I discuss relevant aspects of the interactions between hosts and parasitoids. Finally, the review ends demonstrating why these phorids could be promising biological control agents of leaf-cutter pests and suggests priority lines of research for the future...|$|R
50|$|There {{are five}} main types of {{agriculture}} that fungus-growing ants practice: lower, coral fungi, yeast, generalized higher, and leafcutter agricultural systems. Lower agriculture {{is the most}} primitive system and is currently practiced by 80 species in 10 genera. Coral-fungus agriculture is practiced by 34 species by a single derived clade within the genus Apterostigma. The coral fungus farmers underwent a switch of cultivars between 10 and 20 million years ago to a non-leucocoprineacoeous fungus, which makes its choice of cultivar different from all other attines. Yeast agriculture is practiced by 18 species of Cyphomyrmex rimosus. The C. rimosus group is hypothesized to have evolved growing fungus in a yeast form between 5 and 25 million years ago. Generalized higher agriculture is practiced by 63 species in two genera and refers to the condition of highly domesticated fungus. The fungi used in higher agriculture cannot survive without its agriculturalists to tend it and has phenotypic changes that allow for increased ease of ant harvesting. Leafcutter agriculture, which is a more highly derived form of higher agriculture, is practiced by 40 species in two genera and has the most recent evolution, originating between 8 and 12 million years ago. <b>Leaf</b> <b>cutters</b> use living biomass as the substrate to feed their fungi, whereas in all other types of agriculture, the fungus requires dead biomass.|$|R

50|$|Merian's {{drawings}} of plants, frogs, snakes, spiders, iguanas, and tropical beetles are still collected today by amateurs {{all over the}} world. The German word Vogelspinne—(a spider of the infraorder Mygalomorphae), translated literally as bird spider—probably has its origins in an engraving by Maria Sibylla Merian. The engraving, created from sketches drawn in Surinam, shows a large spider who had just captured a bird.

5000|$|Ant nests feature an {{elaborate}} colony structure that may extend 2 m or more underground. As the structure gets further underground, individual chambers become {{farther and farther}} apart indicating that the ant is aware of its depth. It is hypothesized that they accomplish this by sensing the level of {{carbon dioxide in the}} soil. [...] The <b>leaf</b> <b>cutter</b> ant builds a complex nest which can house 8 million individuals. Its nests feature numerous chambers, most notably garden chambers where they farm fungus on leaves they harvest from the forest.|$|E

50|$|The {{seeds of}} S. amara are {{dispersed}} by vertebrates, mainly large birds and mammals, including chachalacas, flycatchers, motmots, thrushes, howler monkeys, tamarins and spider monkeys. <b>Leaf</b> <b>cutter</b> ants {{have also been}} observed to disperse the seeds and dense seedling carpets form in areas where they dump waste material {{but most of the}} seedlings die and dispersal by the ants is thought to be unimportant in determining the long-term patterns of recruitment and dispersal. Seeds that are eaten by monkeys are more likely to germinate than seeds that have not. Fruit-eating phyllostomid bats have also been noted to disperse their seeds; this may aid the regeneration of forests as they disperse the seeds of later successional species while they feed on S. amara.|$|E
50|$|Many trophobiotic ants can {{simultaneously}} maintain {{associations with}} multiple species. Ants that interact with myrmecophilous insects and myrmecophytes are highly associated: {{species that are}} adapted to interact {{with one of these}} myrmecophiles may switch among them depending on resource availability and quality. Of the ant genera that include species that associate with ant plants, 94% also include species that associate with trophobionts. In contrast, ants that are adapted to cultivate fungus (<b>leaf</b> <b>cutter</b> ants, tribe Attini) do not possess the morphological or behavioral adaptations to switch to trophobiotic partners. Many ant mutualists can exploit these multi-species interactions to maximize the benefits of myrmecophily. For example, some plants will host aphids instead of investing in EFN's, which may be more energetically costly depending on local food availability. The presence of multiple interactors can strongly influence the outcomes of myrmecophily, often in unexpected ways.|$|E

50|$|Around 220 {{described}} species, {{and more}} undescribed species of ants in the tribe Attini cultivate fungi. They are only {{found in the}} New World and {{are thought to have}} evolved in the Amazon Rainforest, where they are most diverse today. For these ants, farmed fungi are the only source of food on which their larvae are raised on and are also an important food for adults. Queen ants carry a small part of fungus in small pouches in their mouthparts when they leave the nest to mate, allowing them to establish a new fungus garden when they form a new nest. Different lineages cultivate fungi on different substrates, those that evolved earlier do so {{on a wide range of}} plant matter, whereas <b>leaf</b> <b>cutter</b> ants are more selective, mainly using only fresh leaves and flowers. The fungi are members of the Lepiotaceae and Pterulaceae families. Other fungi in the Escovopsis genus parasitise the gardens and antibiotic-producing bacteria also inhabit the gardens.|$|E
50|$|Simarouba amara is {{a species}} of tree in the Simaroubaceae family, found in the rainforests and savannahs of South and Central America and the Caribbean. It was first {{described}} by Aublet in French Guiana in 1775 {{and is one of}} six species of Simarouba. The tree is evergreen, but produces a new set of leaves once a year. It requires relatively high levels of light to grow and grows rapidly in these conditions, but lives for a relatively short time. In Panama, it flowers during the dry season in February and March, whereas in Costa Rica, where there is no dry season it flowers later, between March and July. As the species is dioecious, the trees are either male or female and only produce male or female flowers. The small yellow flowers are thought to be pollinated by insects, the resulting fruits are dispersed by animals including monkeys, birds and fruit-eating bats and the seeds are also dispersed by <b>leaf</b> <b>cutter</b> ants.|$|E
50|$|Trinidad and Tobago are {{extremely}} rich in neotropical invertebrate fauna. Several hundred species of butterflies, including the brilliant blue emperor butterfly (Morpho peleides), and beetles {{are to be}} found on the islands, many in the tropical forests. Barcant (1970) lists 617 species of butterfly for the two islands of which 123 occur on Tobago. The <b>leaf</b> <b>cutter</b> ant (Atta) is easily observed, even in sub-urban environments. Soldier ants may be observed in forested areas. The largest specimens of centipedes (genus Scolopendra)(over 10 in long) may be found particularly in the drier forests of the Northwestern Peninsular of Trinidad (the Chaguaramas Peninsular) as well as the nearby tiny off shore islands. A few species of large tarantulas may be found in forested areas and even in houses at the forest edge. The arthropod life of Trinidad and Tobago has not been well studied and it is an entomologist's paradise waiting to be discovered, with many species remaining undocumented.|$|E
50|$|The {{fruits and}} leaves of F. yoponensis are eaten by several species. The fruits are eaten by bats, which then {{disperse}} their seeds. The stipules and fruits are {{collected by the}} <b>leaf</b> <b>cutter</b> ant, Atta colombica. The leaves and fruits are the preferred fruit of howler monkeys (Alouatta palliata), with one troop on Barro Colorado Island spending one quarter of its time feeding on F. yoponensis or F. insipida. Spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) also feed on the leaves, which contain 11% protein and 4% sugars and remain similar in chemical composition throughout their lifespan, unlike most tree species. When fresh, the young leaves contain up to 585 mg of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) per 100 g and the fruits contain 268 mg per 100 g. Like humans A. palliata and A. geoffroyi require vitamin C in their diet, since they do not possess the gene for L-gulonolactone oxidase, the enzyme required to convert glucose to ascorbic acid. The fruits of F. yoponensis contain more vitamin C than any other fruit available to the monkeys on Barro Colorado Island.|$|E
50|$|Their {{societies}} {{are based on}} an ant-fungus mutualism, and different species of ants use different species of fungus, {{but all of the}} fungi the ants use are members of the family Lepiotaceae. The ants actively cultivate their fungus, feeding it with freshly cut plant material and keeping it free from pests and molds. This mutualistic relationship is further augmented by another symbiotic partner, a bacterium that grows on the ants and secretes chemicals; essentially, the ants use portable antimicrobials. <b>Leaf</b> <b>cutter</b> ants are sensitive enough to adapt to the fungi's reaction to different plant material, apparently detecting chemical signals from the fungus. If a particular type of leaf is toxic to the fungus, the colony will no longer collect it. The only two other groups of insects to use fungus-based agriculture are ambrosia beetles and termites. The fungus cultivated by the adults is used to feed the ant larvae, and the adult ants feed on leaf sap. The fungus needs the ants to stay alive, and the larvae need the fungus to stay alive, so the mutualism is obligatory.|$|E
50|$|Synoeketetic Staphylinids live {{in close}} contact with their host ants but are not {{integrated}} into the colony. These species may be further categorized as neutral, mimetic, loricate, and symphiloid synoeketes. Neutral synoeketes ignore and are ignored by their host, but feed on refuse. There are few Staphylinid neutral synoeketes, but some are found in the genus Athetini, which live in the debris and fungal chambers of <b>leaf</b> <b>cutter</b> ants (Atta). Mimetic synoeketes are myrmecoid, resembling their host ant morphologically. Many mimetic species are guests of Driver ants, which are blind. Driver ants however have strong senses of touch, suggesting mimics fool their hosts tactilely. It is also possible that mimicry may reduce predation from more visual animals, such as birds. Loricate, or “tear-drop shaped”, synoeketes are “defensive forms”. They typically exhibit long tapering bodies with broad thoraxes and smooth bodies, which prevent aggressing ants from gripping them. Symphiloids strongly resemble “true guests,” but are not fully integrated into the colony. They are often mimics, and in some species have developed trichomes. Syneoketes generally live on or inside of ant nests, where they feed on refuse and may steal food from their hosts. There is some overlap between synoeketes and other categories, especially in loricate species and synecthrans, and symphiloids and symphiles, where the behavior of “true guests” may be difficult to determine.|$|E
50|$|The Canyon is {{considered}} a biogeographic corridor since {{it is home to}} four types of vegetation: Tropical Forest, Deciduous, Riparian forest, Rupicolous Gerbil vegetation and secondary vegetation. Several species of flora and fauna are endemic to the canyon. It is often visited by national and international investigators since it is includes great biological diversity. On June 5, 1997 the canyon was declared a Nature reserve, under the category of Zone subject to Ecological Conservation Protected Area by the World Conservation Union of all the area belonging to the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area because it is the most urbanized area. Great Horned Owls, Collared Peccaries, Bobcats, Gray Foxes, Opossums, Red-tailed Boas, Barn Owls, <b>Leaf</b> <b>Cutter</b> Ants and Vampire Bats are among the species making a home in the canyon.There are several urbanized areas that cover {{the eastern side of the}} canyon, complexes such as the University of Guadalajara campus of the CUAAD Center of Art, Architecture and Design, the Guadalajara Zoo, and the now closed Guadalajara Planetarium. In addition to several residential areas, there are also sporting and recreational facilities that include soccer fields, basketball, tennis and fronton courts, picnic spaces, a running strip, a recreational park and an outdoor theater. There were plans to build the next Guggenheim Museum in early 2008, the controversial Arcediano dam project and the high-rise project Puerta Guadalajara (Guadalajara Gate) which included a shopping mall, a convention center, two hotels, two museums, 9 residencial towers and two more corporate towers. None of these projects have been started and it seems likely that they have now all been cancelled or postponed indefinitely. However, work is in progress on the construction of an art museum in the Mirador park, on the site formerly intended for the Guggenheim museum project.|$|E
5000|$|On September 2, 2011, Cutter gets {{a job as}} a {{front desk}} clerk at The Minute Man Motel so that he could impress Aubrey by turning over a new <b>leaf.</b> <b>Cutter</b> and Aubrey then rekindle their romantic {{relationship}} by making love to each other before Cutter goes to work. When Cutter opens the door to leave for work though, he is surprised to see former stripper Kimberly Andrews, a woman that he calls [...] "Aubrey", revealing that Kim's real name is Aubrey Wentworth, his real sister. It was soon revealed that his sister stole money from her classmate Rama when they both attended boarding school in France, and Aubrey used the money to have plastic surgery to change her looks from an [...] "ugly duckling" [...] to a sexy looking woman, but Kim promised that she would later pay back Rama for her stolen money. Cutter and Kim then talked about what happened in their lives after they separated, and Cutter told Kim that he learned about the Buchanans after he read about Kim marrying Clint in the newspaper, which inspired him to make Joey his next target with Aubrey. Cutter also learns from Kim that she's been keeping her best friend Stacy Morasco in a hospital in Kentucky, after she was presumed dead after drowning in a frozen lake {{a year and a half}} ago on Llantano Mountain. On September 9, 2011, Cutter bought Roxy Balsom's stuffed beaver Morris at a flea market outside in Angel Square for Aubrey as a gift. Cutter told Aubrey that he and his sister were once scamming partners with Kim when Cutter worked with her to seduce rich men for their money after she got her plastic surgery, but they later parted ways when they were both exposed as con artists after the incident at the Spotted Pony. Cutter would also confess to Aubrey that Kim had a sick friend she was taking care of in the hospital in Kentucky. Cutter and Aubrey discovered that a gun was hidden in Morris after they knocked it over and the gun fell out of the bottom of the beaver. Aubrey and Cutter soon figured out that the gun belonged to Rex, who was one of the suspects for the murder of Victor Lord Jr.. Cutter is tempted to use Rex's gun to blackmail him for the Buchanan fortune. Aubrey convinces him to turn the gun over to the police. Cutter decides to still keep the gun inside the beaver against Aubrey's wishes. Kim discovers that Rex's gun is inside Morris. Kim tries to convince Cutter to blackmail Rex for the Buchanan fortune so that she could pay for Stacy's medical bills at the hospital in Kentucky and give back the family fortune to Clint, but Cutter refuses to revert to his scamming ways because of his promise to Aubrey to go straight. Kim is visited by Rex's biological mother Echo DiSavoy, who also wants the beaver and the gun back from Cutter. Kim goes through her plan to blackmail Echo and try to convince her son to hand over the entire Buchanan fortune back to Clint and to help pay her friend Stacy's medical bills. Cutter later comes home from work to discover that the gun is missing from inside Morris after Aubrey looks inside to see if Cutter turned in the gun to the police yet. Cutter then starts to panic, and finds out that his sister Kim was the one to steal the gun from the beaver. On September 21, 2011, Cutter goes to the hospital in Kentucky to confront her sister about stealing Rex's gun from him, and Kim tells Cutter to let her still keep Rex's gun to continue to blackmail Echo to convince Rex to sign over the entire Buchanan fortune to Clint and to help pay for Stacy's medical bills. Cutter then sees Stacy in her room and is surprised to find out what happened to Stacy. Kim tells Cutter not to tell anyone about Stacy's mysterious circumstances. Cutter agrees to keep her secret since he feels no one will believe him when he tells someone about Stacy's secret.|$|E
