40|$|The {{luminosity}} {{performance of}} a future linear collider (LC) will depend critically {{on the performance of}} the damping rings. The design luminosities of the current LC proposals require rings with very short damping times, large acceptance, low equilibrium emittance and high beam intensity. We discuss the design strategies for lattices achieving the goals of dynamical stability, examine the challenges for alignment and coupling correction, and consider a variety of collective effects that threaten to limit beam quality. We put the design goals in context by referring to the experience <b>of</b> <b>operating</b> <b>facilities,</b> and outline the further research and development that is needed.

40|$|A modern linear {{accelerator}} of ions {{is a long}} chain of different accelerating-focusing structures. The design of new linacs, {{as well as an}} upgrade and optimization <b>of</b> <b>operating</b> <b>facilities,</b> requires precise and reliable beam matching with the subsequent sections. Proper matching of the beam to the channel allows to improve the performance of the whole linac and to reduce the specific costs. Additionally it helps to avoide particle loss in high energy high intensity linacs. Generally a matching algorithm combines precisely measured or calculated accelerating-focusing external fields and experimentally obtained details of the beam parameters with an advanced code for beam dynamics simulations including space charge effects. Experimental results are introduced into a code as input data. The described algorithm has already been successfully implemented for several GSI projects: an upgrade of the GSI heavy ion linac UNILAC, an ion linac for the cancer therapy, the proton linac for the FAIR facility, a facility for laser acceleration of ions and others. Measured data and results of beam dynamics simulations leading to an achieved improvement of the linac performance are presented...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWhen an {{industrial}} accident occurs, e. g. the explosion or {{the fire of}} a chemical facility, soil investigations and subsequent risk mitigation generally need to be decided and performed rapidly. This requires specific organisation and tools: Procedures for an immediate and coordinated intervention of relevant actors: industrials, administrations for industrial facilities, emergency and health, local authorities, environmental consultants and laboratories, NGOs. Models and input data on emission, atmospheric transfer and deposition on soil, for an accidental source; investigation plans and adequate soil quality references, guidelines [...] . But the European Seveso legislation, and its application in France and probably in Europe, {{is focused on the}} prevention of immediate impacts on health and constructions; and the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) legislation deals with the chronic impacts <b>of</b> <b>operating</b> <b>facilities.</b> Thus, post-accidental impacts of industrial accidents are hardly dealt with, the specific organisation and tools are lacking, and when accidents occur, the industrials and administrations concerned are largely unprepared for managing their delayed impacts, first of them on soils...|$|R
