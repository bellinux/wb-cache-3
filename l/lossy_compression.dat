It was therefore with great anticipation that I read the article “The Effect of Compression on Clinical Diagnosis of Glaucoma Based on Non-analyzed Confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy Images,” by Bélair et al. in the July/August 2005 issue of Ophthalmic Surgery, Lasers & Imaging. 1 The authors compared diagnostic accuracy of independent observers based on HRT images in different compressed and uncompressed formats, including <b>lossy</b> JPEG <b>compression,</b> <b>lossy</b> JPEG 2000 <b>compression,</b> <b>lossy</b> GIF <b>compression,</b> and lossless PNG and TIFF compression.

25|$|As {{the typical}} use of JPEG is a <b>lossy</b> <b>compression</b> method, which {{somewhat}} reduces the image fidelity, {{it should not}} be used in scenarios where the exact reproduction of the data is required (such as some scientific and medical imaging applications and certain technical image processing work).|$|E
25|$|Since the {{quantization}} stage always {{results in}} a loss of information, JPEG standard is always a <b>lossy</b> <b>compression</b> codec. (Information is lost both in quantizing and rounding of the floating-point numbers.) Even if the quantization matrix is a matrix of ones, information will still be lost in the rounding step.|$|E
40|$|This paper reports an {{experiment}} conducted {{to investigate the}} effect of <b>lossy</b> JPEG <b>compression</b> of an image with chromatic aberrations on the measurement accuracy of target center by the intensity-weighted centroid method. I utilized six images shooting a white sheet with 30 by 20 black filled circles in the experiment. The images were acquired by a digital camera Canon EOS 20 D. The image data were compressed by using two compression parameter sets of a downsampling ratio, a quantization table and a Huffman code table utilized in EOS 20 D. The experiment results clearly indicate that <b>lossy</b> JPEG <b>compression</b> of an image with chromatic aberrations would produce {{a significant effect on}} measurement accuracy of target center by the intensity-weighted centroid method. The maximum displacements of red, green and blue components caused by <b>lossy</b> JPEG <b>compression</b> were 0. 20, 0. 09, and 0. 20 pixels respectively. The results also suggest that the downsampling of the chrominance components Cb and Cr in <b>lossy</b> JPEG <b>compression</b> would produce displacements between uncompressed image data and compressed image data. In conclusion, since the author consider that it would be unable to correct displacements caused by <b>lossy</b> JPEG <b>compression,</b> the author would recommend that <b>lossy</b> JPEG <b>compression</b> before recording an image in a digital camera should not be executed in case of highly precise image measurement by using color images acquired by a non-metric digital camera...|$|R

25|$|Then the {{watermarked}} {{digital signal}} is transmitted or stored, usually transmitted to another person. If this person makes a modification, {{this is called}} an attack. While the modification may not be malicious, the term attack arises from copyright protection application, where third parties may attempt to remove the digital watermark through modification. There are many possible modifications, for example, <b>lossy</b> <b>compression</b> of the data (in which resolution is diminished), cropping an image or video, or intentionally adding noise.|$|E
25|$|These {{artifacts}} can {{be reduced}} by choosing {{a lower level of}} compression; they may be completely avoided by saving an image using a lossless file format, though this will result in a larger file size. The images created with ray-tracing programs have noticeable blocky shapes on the terrain. Certain low-intensity compression artifacts might be acceptable when simply viewing the images, but can be emphasized if the image is subsequently processed, usually resulting in unacceptable quality. Consider the example below, demonstrating the effect of <b>lossy</b> <b>compression</b> on an edge detection processing step.|$|E

40|$|High-resolution Earth {{system model}} {{simulations}} generate enormous data volumes, and retaining {{the data from}} these simulations often strains institutional storage resources. Further, these exceedingly large storage requirements negatively impact science objectives, for example, by forcing reductions in data output frequency, simulation length, or ensemble size. To lessen data volumes from the Community Earth System Model (CESM), we advocate the use of <b>lossy</b> data <b>compression</b> techniques. While <b>lossy</b> data <b>compression</b> does not exactly preserve the original data (as lossless <b>compression</b> does), <b>lossy</b> techniques have an advantage in terms of smaller storage requirements. To preserve {{the integrity of the}} scientific simulation data, the effects of <b>lossy</b> data <b>compression</b> on the original data should, at a minimum, not be statistically distinguishable from the natural variability of the climate system, and previous preliminary work with data from CESM has shown this goal to be attainable. However, to ultimately convince climate scientists that it is acceptable to use <b>lossy</b> data <b>compression,</b> we provide climate scientists with access to publicly available climate data that have undergone <b>lossy</b> data <b>compression.</b> In particular, we report on the results of a <b>lossy</b> data <b>compression</b> experiment with output from the CESM Large Ensemble (CESM-LE) Community Project, in which we challenge climate scientists to examine features of the data relevant to their interests, and attempt to identify which of the ensemble members have been compressed and reconstructed. We find that while detecting distinguishing features is certainly possible, the compression effects noticeable in these features are often unimportant or disappear in post-processing analyses. In addition, we perform several analyses that directly compare the original data to the reconstructed data to investigate the preservation, or lack thereof, of specific features critical to climate science. Overall, we conclude that applying <b>lossy</b> data <b>compression</b> to climate simulation data is both advantageous in terms of data reduction and generally acceptable in terms of effects on scientific results...|$|R

25|$|Another example where sub-Nyquist {{sampling}} is optimal arises {{under the}} additional constraint that the samples are quantized in an optimal manner, as in a combined system of sampling and optimal <b>lossy</b> <b>compression.</b> This setting is relevant {{in cases where}} the joint effect of sampling and quantization is to be considered, and can provide a lower bound for the minimal reconstruction error that can be attained in sampling and quantizing a random signal. For stationary Gaussian random signals, this lower bound is usually attained at a sub-Nyquist sampling rate, indicating that sub-Nyquist sampling is optimal for this signal model under optimal quantization.|$|E
25|$|Technical {{development}} of the cassette effectively ceased when digital recordable media, such as DAT and MiniDisc, were introduced in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Anticipating the switch from analog to digital format, major companies, such as Sony, shifted their focus to new media. In 1992, Philips introduced the Digital Compact Cassette (DCC), a DAT-like tape in almost the same shell as a Compact Cassette. It was aimed primarily at the consumer market. A DCC deck could play back both types of cassettes. Unlike DAT, which was accepted in professional usage because it could record without <b>lossy</b> <b>compression</b> effects, DCC failed in both home and mobile environments, and was discontinued in 1996.|$|E
25|$|JPEG's <b>lossy</b> <b>compression</b> also {{suffers from}} {{generation}} loss, where repeatedly decoding and re-encoding an image {{to save it}} again causes a loss of information each time, degrading the image. This does not happen with repeated viewing or copying, {{but only if the}} file is edited and saved over again. Because PNG is lossless, it is suitable for storing images to be edited. While PNG is reasonably efficient when compressing photographic images, there are lossless compression formats designed specifically for photographic images, lossless WebP and Adobe DNG (digital negative) for example. However these formats are either not widely supported, or are proprietary. An image can be stored losslessly and converted to JPEG format only for distribution, so that there is no generation loss.|$|E

2500|$|JPEG ( [...] ) is a {{commonly}} used method of <b>lossy</b> <b>compression</b> for digital images, particularly for those images produced by digital photography.

2500|$|Quality values {{account for}} {{about half of the}} {{required}} disk space in the FASTQ format (before compression), and therefore the compression of the quality values can significantly reduce storage requirements and speed up analysis and transmission of sequencing data. Both lossless and <b>lossy</b> <b>compression</b> are recently being considered in the literature. For example, the algorithm QualComp [...] performs <b>lossy</b> <b>compression</b> with a rate (number of bits per quality value) specified by the user. Based on rate-distortion theory results, it allocates the number of bits so as to minimize the MSE (mean squared error) between the original (uncompressed) and [...] the reconstructed (after compression) quality values. Other algorithms for compression of quality values include SCALCE [...] and Fastqz. Both are lossless compression algorithms that provide an optional controlled lossy transformation approach. For example, SCALCE reduces the alphabet size based on the observation that “neighboring” quality values are similar in general.|$|E
2500|$|The DCT, and in {{particular}} the DCT-II, is often used in signal and image processing, especially for <b>lossy</b> <b>compression,</b> because it has a strong [...] "energy compaction" [...] property: in typical applications, most of the signal information tends to be concentrated in a few low-frequency components of the DCT.
