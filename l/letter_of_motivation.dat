Only 1% of German students achieve a scholarship at one of the eleven organizations (i.e. FES, Studienstiftung, Konrad Adenauer Foundation). It is financially funded and subsidized by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research and supports students with outstanding academical and political achievements. Awards are granted after a multi-stage selection process and are based on grades, <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> recommendation, <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>motivation,</b> political and social engagement as well as personality and character. Until today it has sponsored more than 12,000 grantees. Over 90% of those sponsored graduate with honours. In 2005, there were 1,731 students in the programme, of which 51% were women. Beyond the financial support, grantees also receive so-called ideational support, which comes from opportunities to attend political seminars, conferences, and other activities, which can be important job qualifications. The FES kept its own conference center on the Venusberg in Bonn for these activities until its closure in 2009. Each year, the grantees vote for a board during the nationwide conference at the Stresemann Institute in Bonn. This board serves for the next full year as the representation of grantees for dialog with the foundation. The FES maintains a website (http://www.fes-stip.de www.fes-stip.de) for networking among grantees, which includes a wide variety of mailing lists, services, and communications tools.|$|R

The application procedure includes submission of a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>motivation,</b> references, an English proficiency requirement, {{as well as an}} interview: all this is highly unusual in the Netherlands. It is also still very controversial legally and socially; as a result UCU has acquired somewhat of a reputation for elitism and snobbery, which is occasionally expressed in both national and regional press. This is reflected by studies which focused on student satisfaction and overall quality by magazines like Elsevier etc. UCU's student body is largely of a comparable socio-economic background to the general university population in the Netherlands. Many Dutch and international UCU students need to find loans and jobs, which is not easy given the intensity of the College's academic programme. For this reason, UCU has established a Student Aid Fund and is actively seeking funds; the College has recently encountered difficulties securing scholarships for foreign students. An additional challenge towards UCU's aim to ensure a broad and diverse international student population have been recent government actions that have made it more difficult for some foreigners to obtain a residence permit for the Netherlands.|$|E

40|$|Adopting green {{building}} {{requires a lot}} <b>of</b> <b>motivation</b> due to the litany of challenges involved. Consequently, many previous studies have investigated the motivation for adopting {{green building}}. Insights from motivation theories {{from the field of}} psychology such as goal-setting theory and expectancy theory suggest that the previous studies emphasized only on the goal or intention <b>of</b> <b>motivation.</b> While this is correct, the motivation for adopting green building also encompasses ‘levels of motivation’ based on another theory from the field of psychology – the self-determination theory (SDT) <b>of</b> <b>motivation.</b> Hence, what are the levels <b>of</b> <b>motivation</b> for adopting green building? What is the implication of the levels <b>of</b> <b>motivation</b> for the design of policy for motivating the adoption of green building? Through extensive literature review, this study uses insights from the SDT <b>of</b> <b>motivation</b> to answer these questions. By doing so, this study helps to form a newer understanding <b>of</b> the <b>motivation</b> for adopting green building.
