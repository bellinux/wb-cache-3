40|$|The {{activity}} of human milk {{for the growth}} of <b>Lactobacillus</b> <b>bifidus</b> var. Penn was compared with that of other species. The average relative activity was highest for human colostrum, closely followed by rat colostrum, then by human milk, rat milk, and cow's colostrum. The milk of ruminants (cow, ewe, goat) showed only very slight activity. Somewhat higher activity was found in the milk of cat, monkey, dog, donkey, rabbit, mare, and sow. The <b>bifidus</b> growth <b>factor</b> has been demonstrated in high concentration in various secretions in man, such as saliva, semen, amniotic fluid, meconium, and tears.

40|$|The {{buffering}} {{capacity of a}} milk diet {{is known to be}} involved in the control of a newborn's bifidobacterial flora. Other factors could modulate the bifidobacterial flora e. g. <b>bifidus</b> <b>factors</b> present in human milk, which are growth-promoting for Bi 3 dobacterium bi$durn. The aim of this study was to investigate in gnotobiotic mice the effects of human milk <b>bifidus</b> <b>factors</b> upon colonis-ation by bifidobacteria according to the dietary {{buffering capacity}}. A high buffering capacity diet encouraged the implantation of higher numbers of bifidobacteria in monoxenic mice than a low buffering capacity one. However, supplementary feeding with human milk oligosaccharides (gynolactose) did not support the proliferation of B. bijdum, although the gynolactose <b>bifidus</b> <b>factors</b> were not destroyed during digestion. Furthermore the addition of gynolactose to a high buffering capacity diet led to the breakdown of some of the intestinal glycoproteins detected in the bifidogenic extract of stools from germfree mice. In addition, although the human milk oligosaccharides stimulated the excretion of intestinal <b>bifidus</b> <b>factors</b> when supplementing a low buffering capacity diet, they failed to do so on a high buffering capacity diet. These results suggest that the ability of human milk oligosaccharides to encourage the proliferation of B. bijidum depends upon their capacity to stimulate intestinal <b>bifidus</b> <b>factors.</b> This capacity seemed to be related to the buffering capacity of the diet.

The following observations were made: 1. The sera of germ-free guinea pigs, when infected with the organisms of Lactobacillus acidophilus, had a lower bactericidal power against strain 0 - 901 of Salmonella typhi than did those of the germ-free guinea pigs infected with strain F 6 of Esch. coli.

40|$|SUMMARY: The {{globular}} swellings {{known to}} appear occasionally in {{cultures of the}} bifid bacteria {{have been shown to}} occur in all known types of <b>Lactobacillus</b> <b>bifidus.</b> The swellings developed on a substrate which permitted abundant growth.

The globular forms are considered to be organisms with incomplete cell walls which develop on a substrate adequate for growth but not for normal cell wall synthesis. There are in the literature on the bifid bacteria (Lactobacillus bijdus) repeated notes on the occurrence of globular involution forms. Tissier (1900) stated that the whole organism can swell and give a bladder-like appearance as a response to acidity, extreme temperatures or inadequate nitrogen sources in the sub-strate.

The drug of 0. 6 gr. per day was given orally to infant. The ages of twelve infants were varied from two to six months after birth. The experimental periods of time, which mean consecutive days of administration of the drug, were distributed from three to twenty one days. The bacterial flora, such as Clostridium butylicum, <b>Lactobacillus</b> <b>bifidus,</b> <b>Lactobacillus</b> acidophilus, Streptococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli, were recovered from the faeces of infants using selction culture media suitable for each bacterial strain.

Besides calcium content, sugar and amino acid compositions were shown to be different between the bifid and bacilloid forms. In the cell wall especially, the content of glucose in the bifid form was larger than that in the bacilloid form.

Standard techniques used in the structural studies have included infrared analysis, periodate oxidation followed by examination of the fragments left (before and after reduction), acid hydrolysis, acetolysis and methylation. Techniques described which have not previously been used on dextrans are glucamylolysis and catalytic oxidation (followed by a study of the modified dextrans).

In the first paper, attempts to demonstrate capsules by staining and by suspension in India ink were re-ported as unsuccessful. If the organisms were stained following suspension in freshly ground Chinese ink, however, capsules were seen. In the second paper, it was reported that capsules may be demonstrated also by means of a phase-contrast microscope when suspensions of or-ganisms are exposed to specific immune serum. In our laboratory the occurrence of mucoid variants or mutants of L. bifidus often has been observed. Occasionally a rare mucoid colony may be found in growth from the original inocu-lum. When strains of L. bifidus isolated from the stools of breast-fed infants are carried in the chemically defined medium of Norris et al.

40|$|Background—It {{has been}} {{reported}} that the acidity of gastric contents could be an important factor in regulating jejunal flora.  Aims—To investigate the effects of omeprazole induced changes in gastric pH on jejunal flora and bile acid metabolism.  Methods—Twenty one patients with gastric ulcer and 19 healthy volunteers were studied. Deconjugation of bile acids was detected using a bile acid breath test. Jejunal fluid was aspirated using a double lumen tube with a rubber cover on the tip and deconjugation was examined using thin layer chromatography. Fat malabsorption was detected by a triolein breath test.  Results—In the bile acid breath test, expired breath samples from all patients and healthy volunteers showed significantly greater 14 CO 2 specific activity after omeprazole treatment (20 mg/day) than before treatment. Bacterial overgrowth was found in the jejunal fluid and gastric juice of both ulcer patients and healthy volunteers after omeprazole treatment. The following species were identified: Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, enterococcus, <b>Lactobacillus</b> <b>bifidus,</b> Bacteroides vulgatus, B uniformis, Eubacterium lentum, Eu parvum, and Corynebacterium granulosum. All of these species, except E coli and C albicans, deconjugate bile acids. There was a significant correlation between 14 CO 2 activity and gastric pH, both before and after omeprazole treatment in both groups. The triolein breath test revealed impaired fat absorption in both groups after omeprazole treatment.  Conclusions—Both patients with gastric ulcer and healthy volunteers exhibited increased deconjugation of bile acids caused by bacterial overgrowth in the jejunum and fat malabsorption after omeprazole treatment. The bacterial overgrowth consisted of both anaerobes and aerobes with deconjugation ability and was probably associated with an omeprazole induced shift to neutral pH in the gastric juice. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Comparative {{study of}} the {{oligosaccharide}} profiles of individual human milk revealed the presence of three different patterns. Four oligosaccharides containing the Fuc, 1 - 2 Gal group were missing in the milk of non-secretor, and three oligosaccharides containing the Fuc, 1 - 4 GlcNAc group were missing in the milk of Lewis negative individuals. Disappearance of some major oligosaccharides in these samples led to the finding of five novel minor oligosaccharides, which were hidden under the missing oligosaccharides. Following these studies, structures of many novel milk oligosaccharides were elucidated. At least 13 core oligosaccharides were found in these oligosaccharides. By adding,-fucosyl residues and sialic acid residues to these core oligosaccharides, {{more than one hundred}} oligosaccharides were formed. All these oligosaccharides contain lactose at their reducing termini. This evidence, together with the deletion phenomena found in the milk oligosaccharides of non-secretor and Lewis negative individuals, suggested that the oligosaccharides are formed from lactose by the concerted action of glycosyltransferases, which are responsible for elongation and branching of the Gal- 1 - 4 GlcNAc group in the sugar chains of glycoconjugates on the surface of epithelial cells. Therefore, oligosaccharides in human milk could include many structures, starting from the Gal- 1 - 4 GlcNAc group in the sugar chains of various glycoconjugates. Many lines of evidence recently indicated that virulent enteric bacteria and viruses start their infection by binding to particular sugar chains of glycoconjugates on the target cell surfaces. Therefore, milk oligosaccharides could be useful for developing drugs, which inhibit the infection of bacteria and viruses.

The studied variables were: temperature, pH, sucrose and enzyme concentrations. According to the results, only temperature and sucrose concentrations have shown to be significant parameters. The syntheses of the fructooligosaccharides were carried out on stirred reactor and packed bed reactors, using free and immobilized enzymes, with the best conditions obtained from the experimental design. It has been shown that there is no significant difference between these processes. The final sugar concentrations can be tailor made by varying residence time in the reactor to cope with the different standard needs in food industries.

In the past much confusion existed regarding the taxonomy of the bifidobacteria, partly because of the incomplete methods. available for identifi-cation of organisms, and partly because of their pleomorphism. During the past dec-ade, however, significant progress has been made in this field, facilitating a more defin-itive speciation of the bifidobacteria (2 - 11). This paper proposes to review briefly some recent advances in the knowledge of the taxonomy of the bifidobacteria and to pres-ent research on some aspects of the ecolog-ical relationships of bifidobacteria. Classification For many years bifidobacteria were in-cluded in the genus <b>Lactobacillus</b> as Lacto-bacillus <b>bifidus,</b> but they are now classified in a separate genus Bifidobacterium as sug-gested by Orla-Jensen (12) on the basis of their characteristic morphology, biochemi-cal characters, cell wall constituents, and DNA base composition (13 - 16). In the past, several workers recognized only one species in the genus Bifidobacter-ium (12, 14, 17), but Reuter (3) has pro-posed on the basis of carbohydrate fermen-tation eight species and several biotypes for strains isolated from human infants and adults. He recognized the following species and biotypes in the genus Bifidobacterium: Bifidobacterium bifidum a and b, Bifidobac-terium infantis, Bifidobacterium parvulorum a and b, Bifidobacterium breve a and b...|$|R
