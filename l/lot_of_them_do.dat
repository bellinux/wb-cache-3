In a speech {{delivered}} in Toronto in November 1990 Irving claimed that Holocaust survivors had manufactured memories of their suffering because [...] "there's money involved and they can get a good compensation cash payment out of it". In that speech, Irving used the metaphor of a cruise ship named Holocaust, which Irving claimed had [...] "... luxury wall to wall fitted carpets and a crew of thousands… marine terminals established in now virtually every capital in the world, disguised as Holocaust memorial museums". Irving went on to assert that the [...] "ship" [...] was due for rough sailing because recently the Soviet government had allowed historians access to [...] "the index cards {{of all the people who}} passed through the gates of Auschwitz", and claimed that this would lead to [...] "a lot of people who are not claiming to be Auschwitz survivors anymore" [...] (Irving's statement about the index cards was incorrect; what the Soviet government had made available in 1990 were the death books of Auschwitz, recording the weekly death tolls). Irving claimed on the basis of what he called the index books that, [...] "Because the experts can look at a tattoo and say 'Oh yes, 181, 219 that means you entered Auschwitz in March 1943" [...] and he warned Auschwitz survivors [...] "If you want to go and have a tattoo put on your arm, as a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>do,</b> I am afraid to say, and claim subsequently that you were in Auschwitz, you have to make sure a) that it fits in with the month you said you went to Auschwitz and b) it is not a number which anyone used before".|$|E

40|$|Recently and I {{have had}} reason to look through some old {{software}} engineering textbooks, {{the kind of thing}} I used to read as an undergraduate and junior programmer. This is reminded me of a few concepts I haven't thought about in several years. One of these is egoless programming. As I recall my university lecturers where very keen on this concept, {{it seemed to be a}} good thing. Although, to be honest, I’ve always had my doubts [...] . What exactly is egoless programming? I guess it all depends on what you mean by ego, so I turned to my favourite text on management and psychological (and all that kind of stuff) where I found the following definition: “ego has to make sense of the internal conflict in our mind between the id and superego and the external world. The ego is the decision-making part of personality and is engaged in rational and logical thinking. It is governed by the reality principle. " (Mullins, 2002) Now this looks a bit confusing. Does egoless programming mean programming without rational and logical thinking? Well, I’ve seen my fair share programs and I must say a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>do</b> seem a lack rational and logical thinking, but I really don't think anyone wants to advocate this is a design and programming technique.

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, the Philippine {{community}} in the olden times were composed of baranganic societies with small populations and low production levels.

The people under a datu also paid tributes except for his personal supporters called timawa who accompanied him in wars.|$|R
40|$|Genetically {{modified}} organisms (GMOs) can {{be defined}} as organisms in which the DNA has been altered {{in a way that does}} not occur naturally. Such methods are used to create GM plants – which are then used to grow (GM) food crops. GM foods have the potential to solve many of the world’s hunger and malnutrition problems, and to help protect and preserve the environment by increasing yield and reducing reliance upon chemical pesticides and herbicides. Nevertheless, the consumption of GM foods provokes doubts and hesitations among consumers, especially in Italy. This paper has two aims, the first is to investigate genetically modified (GM) foods consumption in Italian high school students through a large sample size survey on 2122 students randomly selected in 39 schools of a metropolitan area (Naples, South-Italy). The second, by examining the behavioural process that drives individual’s perceptions of GM food taking advantage of an empirical choice methodology that corrects for endogeneity in decision making relationships, namely structural equation model (SEM). The results show that a very large percentage of students never or rarely eat GM food and a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>do</b> not suggest the consumption of GM food. The proposed SEM is a full formative measurement model and shows that GM foods consumption in Italian students depends on the knowledge of GMO and on the impact of the GMO on the men’s health and on the environment. Therefore, in order to orient population it could be realized a standardized evaluation systems relative to human health and environment consequences produced by GM organisms and GM foods...|$|E
40|$|According to {{some experts}} {{marketing}} activities in Czech firms are no so widely and commonly used as in comparable markets. The {{aim of this}} paper is therefore to reveal the role of marketing in companies and to identify tools mostly used for supporting their marketing activities. This article is the output of the so called “specific research” conducted at the University of West Bohemia in Pilsen, which was focused on firms from the Pilsen and Karlovy Vary region and should serve as a study for other projects and surveys. There participated 29 firms in this research. Following hypotheses were formulated before canvassing: 1. Marketing management is rather an intuitive then a systematic process. 2. Worldwide customer orientation is exerted in Czech firms too. 3. Product quality is perceived as the biggest competitive advantage. Whereas the first one has not been unambiguously approved nor disproved – although some firms carry out their marketing activities intuitively (the majority of them does not), many of them are not able to identify their own weaknesses, a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>do</b> not perform any situational analy- sis. More than thirty per cent of the surveyed firms use no information system for supporting their marketing activities. On the other hand, Czech firms do not miss out the role of customers and their needs. It is a priority within the situational analysis for more than eighty-five per cent of companies. Furthermo- re, changes in the customers ́ preferences or their behaviour are pursued and evaluated mostly regularly. The third hypothesis has been approved too as the quality of products and services mentioned by more than third of all respondents leads the imaginary chart. Nevertheless, not only quality of product belongs to key factors while the quality of related services is very important as well. On the contrary, the former trend of focusing on price retreats...|$|E

Facing continued heavy small arms fire, {{he returned to the}} company's location and blew up trees to create a landing site so a helicopter could extract the wounded. Company A fought for almost the entire day. One soldier propped Lt. Sauer against a tree so he could continue shooting. Sauer later said, [...] "“By that point we were fighting for each other.

Company B, several kilometers from Company A, fought all day to reach the unit, reaching them late in the day. Despite his own injuries, McNerney refused to be evacuated and remained with A Company until a new commander arrived the next day. McNerney said later on that he had a calm feeling and knew that he wasn't going to die that day.|$|R
