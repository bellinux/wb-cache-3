40|$|The Clark and Washoe Remote Sensing Study (CAWRSS) field season {{took place}} in September 1994. The study was {{designed}} to characterize the exhaust emissions of the on-road vehicle fleet in the two major urban centers of the State of Nevada. The air quality in Las Vegas (Clark County) and Reno (Washoe County) is significantly worse than the surrounding rural areas and vehicle emissions have been identified as one of the primary sources of the pollution. Inspection and maintenance programs, mandated by the federal government, have been implemented in both urban areas. The study compared the State-approved test, a no-load, two-speed <b>idle</b> <b>test,</b> to two other measurement techniques: remote sensing devices (RSDs) and the IM 240 test, a loaded-mode test run on a dynamometer. Results were viewed from two different perspectives. Fleet-wide characteristics showed that concentrations of CO (%,) measured with RSDs were higher than those obtained with the no-load <b>idle</b> <b>tests.</b> Characteristics of pollution distributions derived from the two techniques were similar in range and shape.

40|$|Supported {{by general}} {{revenues}} from the State of Texas. Air pollutant emissions and fuel consumption {{are the most important}} problems associated with vehicle idling. Truck idling in particular is more problematic than other vehicles mainly because of the duration of idling and the high amount of emissions produced. This report is intended to identify the characteristics of truck idling emissions by collecting data using an advanced portable emission measurement system (PEMS), in which the attempt is made to measure actual idling emissions from truck tailpipes and to relate measured emissions to altered pre-testing driving conditions. Employed for the testing is. the On-Board Emission Monitoring system OEM- 2100 TM, an advanced PEMS., This equipment can determine the second-by-second emissions of HC, CO, CO 2, O 2, and NOx in the exhaust gas by a functional equivalent of a repair-grade dual five-gas analyzer subsystem.

Four different grid resolutions {{with and without}} coordinate transformation were used for evaluating the grid independence on computational results of the LES approach.

Furthermore, the computational work has been extended to investigate the effect of ambient wind conditions (i. e., wind speed and direction) on the flow dynamics and pollutant dispersion in the near-wake region of a light-duty diesel vehicle for high idling condition. For the low ambient wind speed case, the vehicular exhaust jet plume dominates the flow structures and the pollutant dispersion patterns.

Since then, Taiwan has continued doing remote sensing each year. By the year 2001, Taiwan has accumulated over 7 millions valid records of remote sensing measurement, {{the highest in the}} world. However, since remote sensing can only serve as a screening tool to identify high emitters, which does not correct any emission problem unless these high mitters are forced to receive proper inspection and maintenance, TEPA is currently engaged in establishing all necessary guidelines for remote sensing law enforcement.

The vehicular exhaust jet plume condition behind the studied ground vehicle dominates the flow pattern and pollutant dispersion at lower vehicle speed and <b>low</b> <b>idling</b> conditions. The vortices and turbulent mixing induced by {{the interaction between the}} vehicular exhaust jet plume, and the ambient wind flow condition behind the studied ground vehicle {{plays an important role in}} dispersing the pollutant concentration at higher vehicle speed and high idling conditions.
