60|$|Through {{the council}} of chiefs ran a <b>low</b> <b>mutter,</b> as of {{gathering}} thunder.|$|R
60|$|<b>Low,</b> <b>muttered</b> curses, then {{mingled with}} dull thuds of hoofs and strain of leather and heaves of tired horses.|$|R
60|$|The cry and {{the glint}} of the boys' weapons decided Mangle. With a <b>low</b> <b>muttering</b> he gave Jack Blowfen's body a kick and sprang for the bushes.|$|R
6000|$|Out of a <b>low</b> <b>mutter</b> at last Harold's words grew distinct: [...] "I don't care--but {{the water}} is cold as ice--I wouldn't put a cayuse into it--let alone Kintuck. Should be a bridge here somewhere." ...|$|R
60|$|The air was frightfully {{close in}} the little attic, and she heard the <b>low</b> <b>mutter</b> of the rising storm in the west. She forgot her {{troubles}} a little, listening to the far-off gigantic footsteps of the tempest.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, ay," [...] {{returned}} Barnstable, in a <b>low</b> <b>muttering</b> voice. [...] "This {{is a sort}} {{of blind}} navigation with a vengeance, and all for no purpose that I can see--see! damme, eyesight is of about as much use now as a man's nose would be in reading the Bible." ...|$|R
6000|$|They laughed, {{for he was}} dead: but I [...] 240 Sate with a {{hard and}} tearless eye, And with a heart which would deny The secret joy it could not quell, <b>Low</b> <b>muttering</b> o'er his loathed name; Till from that self-contention came [...] 245 Remorse where sin was none; a hell Which in pure spirits should not dwell.|$|R
60|$|Maud {{had just}} {{finished}} dressing a bullet wound in {{the arm of a}} young soldier who smiled as he watched her. Then, as she finished the work, he bowed <b>low,</b> <b>muttered</b> his thanks, and catching up his gun rushed back into the fray. It was a flesh wound and until it grew more painful he could still fight.|$|R
6000|$|The {{door was}} of massive oak; and the room, {{although}} in appearance but an ordinary apartment, {{was truly a}} dungeon as safe, and as difficult to break out of, as if far {{below the surface of}} the earth. Later on, when an attendant came in with the bread and water, which formed the substance of each meal, as he placed it on the table he said, in a <b>low</b> <b>muttered</b> whisper: ...|$|R
60|$|While giving vent {{to these}} remarks in <b>low</b> <b>muttering</b> tones, the scout was quickly {{retracing}} his {{steps to the}} place where he had tied up Black Polly. Mounting her he returned to the main track, proceeded along it until he reached the place beyond the pass where the roads forked; then, selecting that which diverged to the left, he set off at a hard gallop in the direction of Quester Creek.|$|R
5000|$|In 1957, {{he landed}} a co-{{starring}} role in the sitcom Bachelor Father, starring John Forsythe and Noreen Corcoran. In the series, Tong portrayed [...] "Peter Tong", Bentley Greggs (Forsythe) live-in houseboy and valet. Although he was playing a servant, Tong enjoyed the role stating, [...] "Houseboys in movies and the theater always bow <b>low,</b> <b>mutter</b> a few sing song words and disappear, but not on this show. I get dialogue and laughs." ...|$|R
60|$|Miss Letitia's voice {{interrupted}} her. Dull, <b>low,</b> rapidly <b>muttering,</b> it was unlike, shockingly unlike, {{the familiar}} voice of her aunt. It said strange words.|$|R
6000|$|... "It'll {{be a hard}} run," [...] said Joe in a <b>low,</b> <b>muttering</b> tone, {{and looking}} furtively over his shoulder. [...] "The varmints are mounted on wild horses, leastways they were wild not long agone. Them chaps can throw the lasso and trip a mustang {{as well as a}} Mexican. Mind the badger holes, Dick. Hold in a bit, Henri, yer nag don't need drivin'--a foot in a hole just now would cost us our scalps. Keep down by the creek, lads." ...|$|R
6000|$|XII. [...] "Prelate! a Monarch's fate brooks no delay; [...] Lead on!"--The {{ponderous}} key {{the old man}} took, [...] And {{held the}} winking lamp, and led the way, [...] By winding stair, dark aisle, and secret nook, [...] Then on an ancient gateway bent his look; [...] And, as the key the desperate King essayed, [...] <b>Low</b> <b>muttered</b> thunders the Cathedral shook, [...] And twice he stopped, and twice new effort made, Till the huge bolts rolled back, and the loud hinges brayed.|$|R
60|$|Then {{the silence}} fell {{again on the}} circle of old men, and they bent their heads in meditation. Crawling Elk was just handing the pipe to Grayman, in order to rise, when a <b>low</b> <b>mutter</b> and a jostling caused every glance to centre upon {{one side of the}} circle, and then, decked in war-paint, gay with beads and feathers, and {{carrying}} a rifle, Cut Finger stepped silently and haughtily into the circle and stood motionless as a statue, his tall figure erect and rigid as an oak.|$|R
6000|$|The first watch, {{from eight}} to twelve, was the mate's; and Captain Van Horn, forced below by the driving wet {{of a heavy}} rain squall, took Jerry with him {{to sleep in the}} tiny stateroom. Jerry was weary from the {{manifold}} excitements of the most exciting day in his life; and he was asleep and kicking and growling in his sleep, ere Skipper, with a last look at him and a grin as he turned the lamp <b>low,</b> <b>muttered</b> aloud: [...] "It's that wild-dog, Jerry. Get him. Shake him. Shake him hard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will send}} some one to you," [...] he said, {{as he took}} his departure; [...] "some one that shall take the poor child and bury it, and who shall move {{you and the other}} one into the workhouse." [...] She thanked him once more with some <b>low</b> <b>muttered</b> words, but the promise brought her no joy. And when the succour came it was all too late, for the mother and the two {{children}} never left the cabin till they left it together, wrapped in their workhouse shrouds.|$|R
60|$|There was no answer, but {{the voices}} dropped suddenly. The head Chinaman went out. We heard the clink {{of ice in}} the glasses, pouring sounds, the {{shuffling}} of feet, the scraping of chairs. Schomberg, after wondering in a <b>low</b> <b>mutter</b> who the devil could be there {{at this time of}} the day, got up napkin in hand to peep through the doorway cautiously. He retreated rapidly on tip-toe, and whispering behind his hand informed me that it was Falk, Falk himself who was in there, and, what's more, he had Captain Hermann with him.|$|R
60|$|She {{sat there}} hour after hour, {{with her hand}} lying gently upon his. When she would move it for a moment, though it was to moisten his lips, he would give some sign of impatience. For hours he lay in that way, till the early dawn of the summer morning broke into the room through the chink of the shutters. Then there came from him some sign of a {{stronger}} life, and at last, with a <b>low</b> <b>muttered</b> voice, indistinct, but not so indistinct but that the sounds were caught, he whispered a word or two.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked up}} at his wife, and {{whatever}} {{he was going to}} add remained unspoken. She was staring at him with her big, slanting eyes, that seemed to him twice their natural size. The child, its dirty little face pressed to its mother's shoulder, was sleeping peacefully. The deep silence of the house was not broken, but rather accentuated, by the <b>low</b> <b>mutter</b> of the cockatoo, now very still on its perch. As Willems was looking at Joanna her upper lip was drawn up on one side, giving to her melancholy face a vicious expression altogether new to his experience. He stepped back in his surprise.|$|R
60|$|Then Ladd {{suddenly}} straightened up, {{turned to}} his horse, and <b>muttered</b> <b>low</b> under his breath.|$|R
60|$|Anderson <b>muttered</b> <b>low</b> {{under his}} breath and his big hand snapped hard at the nodding goldenrod.|$|R
6000|$|After a {{time came}} a light, and Josephine moving about quietly, and putting away the clothes {{that had been}} left on the floor. Kate was not afraid of her, but her caressing consolations and pity would have only added to the miserable sense of shame; so there was no sign, no symptom of being awake, though it was certain that before Josephine went away, the candle was held so as to cast a light over all that was visible of the face. Kate could not help hearing the <b>low</b> <b>muttering</b> of the Frenchwoman, who was always apt to talk to herself: [...] "Asleep! Ah, yes! She sleeps profoundly. How ugly la petite has made herself! What cries! Ah, she is like Miladi her aunt! a demon of a temper!" ...|$|R
60|$|Captain West's head drooped {{until his}} chin rested on his breast, and so <b>low</b> did he <b>mutter</b> that I leaned to hear.|$|R
60|$|It {{was blowing}} hard when Jeff reached the cliffs, and, bending {{forward to the}} {{increasing}} blast {{made his way to}} the rugged coast which was to be the scene of his night vigil. As he stood on the shore with hands in pockets and legs apart, to steady himself, and gazed out upon the darkening sea, he saw plainly enough that the prophetic barometer was right. Far out on the water a ledge of rocks, barely covered at high water, caught the billows as they rolled shoreward, broke them up, and sent them spouting into the air in volumes of foam. On the horizon the clouds were so black that the shrieking sea-birds passed athwart them like flakes of snow. <b>Low</b> <b>muttering</b> thunder was heard at intervals; and as night drew on, gleams of lightning flashed in the obscurity.|$|R
60|$|Notwithstanding the rebuke {{and threat}} of the sailor, the widow silently {{occupied}} her old place; and with her children clustering round her, began her <b>low,</b> <b>muttered</b> reading, standing right in the extreme bows of the ship, and slightly leaning over them, as if addressing the multitudinous waves from a floating pulpit. Presently Max came behind her, snatched the book from her hands, and threw it overboard. The widow gave a wail, and her boys set up a cry. Their cousins, then ducking in the water close by, at once saw {{the cause of the}} cry; and springing from the tub, like so many dogs, seized Max by the legs, biting and striking at him: which, the before timid little O'Briens no sooner perceived, than they, too, threw themselves on the enemy, and the amazed seaman found himself baited like a bull by all six boys.|$|R
6000|$|May 31.--James H. Williams, aged 21, 3d Virginia cavalry.-About as mark'd {{a case of}} {{a strong}} man brought low by a {{complication}} of diseases, (laryngitis, fever, debility and diarrhoea,) as I have ever seen--has superb physique, remains swarthy yet, and flushed and red with fever-is altogether flighty--flesh of his great breast and arms tremulous, and pulse pounding away with treble quickness--lies {{a good deal of the}} time in a partial sleep, but with <b>low</b> <b>muttering</b> and groans--a sleep in which there is no rest. Powerful as he is, and so young, he will not be able to stand many more days of the strain and sapping heat of yesterday and to-day. His throat is in a bad way, tongue and lips parch'd. When I ask him how he feels, he is able just to articulate, [...] "I feel pretty bad yet, old man," [...] and looks at me with his great bright eyes. Father, John Williams, Millensport, Ohio.|$|R
60|$|The <b>low,</b> <b>muttering</b> {{sounds of}} his {{threatening}} voice were still audible, when the wounded foal, first rearing on its hinder legs, plunged forward to its knees. It {{was met by}} Chingachgook, whose knife passed across its throat quicker than thought, and then precipitating the motions of the struggling victim, he dashed it into the river, down whose stream it glided away, gasping audibly for breath with its ebbing life. This deed of apparent cruelty, but of real necessity, fell upon {{the spirits of the}} travellers like a terrific warning of the peril in which they stood, heightened as it was by the calm though steady resolution of the actors in the scene. The sisters shuddered and clung closer to each other, while Heyward instinctively laid his hand on one of the pistols he had just drawn from their holsters, as he placed himself between his charge and those dense shadows that seemed to draw an impenetrable veil before the bosom of the forest.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't quite tell you; {{but your}} father in his <b>delirium</b> <b>muttered</b> some words {{which made me}} suspect the truth, and a sailor who could speak a little bad French said that the Trondhjem was lost upon some rocks. Well, these are the only rocks about here; and as the whole story was too vague to carry to the {{lifeboat}} people I thought that I would come to look. So you see it is perfectly simple." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Or else get at {{the books}} in the vestry myself," [...] the Q.C. <b>muttered</b> <b>low</b> between his clenched teeth, [...] "before the fellow has time to see them and prove it." ...|$|R
6000|$|So on the ashen {{threshold}} lay the king, [...] And {{all within}} {{the house was}} chill and drear; The women watchers gather'd in a ring [...] About the bed of Helen and her bier; [...] And much had they to tell, and much to hear, Of happy queens and fair, untimely dead,-- [...] Such joy they took amid their evil cheer,-- While the <b>low</b> thunder <b>muttered</b> overhead.|$|R
60|$|Be {{that as it}} may: I {{come now}} to the {{extraordinary}} fact, which is the butt-end of this story. It happened late one night, that Yan Yost Vanderscamp was returning across the broad bay, in his light skiff, rowed by his man Pluto. He had been carousing on board of a vessel, newly arrived, and was somewhat obfuscated in intellect, by the liquor he had imbibed. It was a still, sultry night; a heavy mass of lurid clouds was rising in the west, with the <b>low</b> <b>muttering</b> of distant thunder. Vanderscamp called on Pluto to pull lustily, that they might get home before the gathering storm. The old negro made no reply, but shaped his course so as to skirt the rocky shores of Gibbet-Island. A faint creaking overhead caused Vanderscamp to cast up his eyes, when, to his horror, he beheld the bodies of his three pot companions and brothers in iniquity dangling in the moonlight, their rags fluttering, and their chains creaking, as they were slowly swung backward and forward by the rising breeze.|$|R
5000|$|Mayor Smith was {{suspended}} in the air when State Agent Ben Danbaum drove a high-powered automobile into the throng right {{to the base of}} the signal tower. In the car with Danbaum were City Detectives Al Anderson, Charles Van Deusen and Lloyd Toland. They grasped the mayor and Russell Norgard untied the noose. The detectives brought the mayor to Ford Hospital. There he lingered between life and death for several days, finally recovering. [...] "They shall not get him. Mob rule will not prevail in Omaha," [...] the mayor kept <b>muttering</b> during his <b>delirium.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Suddenly {{a terrible}} change {{occurred}} in the atmosphere, which became oppressively sultry and horrible, while <b>low</b> <b>muttering</b> thunders were heard, and heavings of the earth felt. At {{the same time the}} cloud gradually condensed in front of Mordred, and, assuming a distinct form, stood before him in the person of Merlin the Wizard. For a few seconds they stood face to face, frowning on each other in awful silence. Then Merlin raised his arm, and immediately the thunders and confused mutterings increased, until the earth began to undulate and rend as if the foundations of the world were destroyed. Great fissures appeared, and the rocks welled up like the waves of the sea. With a cry of agony the pursuers turned to fly. But it was too late. Already the earth was rent into fragments; it upheaved convulsively for a few seconds; then sank beneath the level of the deep, and the ocean rushed wildly over the land, leaving nothing behind to mark the spot where land had been, save the peaked and barren rocks you see before you, with the surge beating continually around them." ...|$|R
6000|$|Teresa (alone). The moon {{is high in}} heaven, and all is hush'd. [...] Yet anxious listener! I have seem'd to hear [...] A <b>low</b> dead thunder <b>mutter</b> thro' the night, [...] As 'twere a giant angry in his sleep. [...] O Alvar! Alvar! &c.|$|R
60|$|A shiver {{ran down}} his {{backbone}} that was not caused by the cold, and for the minute he could hardly move. He tried to call once more, but his throat was so dry he could scarcely make a sound. Again from a distance came that peculiar noise, <b>low</b> and <b>muttering.</b> He now recognized it as a growl, but whether of a dog or a wild beast he could not determine. He brought out the pistol he had placed {{in his pocket and}} held it ready for use.|$|R
