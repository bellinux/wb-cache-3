The band wanted to dissolve {{but they were}} required to finish their third album in order to fulfill a contract to their record <b>label.</b> <b>Elements</b> features the addition of a third guitarist, Frank Emmi. Initially, Rand Burkey was not going to appear on the album, and as Kelly Shaefer had developed carpal tunnel syndrome, (preventing him from playing anything but rhythm guitar) a new lead guitar player was needed. Before recording, Burkey rejoined the band, and thus the band ended up with three guitarists. Shaefer plays rhythm guitar, while Emmi and Burkey share responsibilities for leads and solos.|$|E

Sentiment analysis for such online platform {{can be used}} to predict political elections, evaluates economic indicators and so on. However, GIF sentiment analysis is quite challenging, not only because it hinges on spatio-temporal visual contentabstraction, but also for the relationship between such abstraction and final sentiment remains unknown. In this paper, we dedicated to find out such relationship. We proposed a SentiPairSequence basedspatiotemporal visual sentiment ontology, which forms the midlevel representations for GIFsentiment. The establishment process of SentiPair contains two steps. First, we construct the Synset Forest to define the semantic tree structure of visual sentiment <b>label</b> <b>elements.</b> Then, through theSynset Forest, we organically select and combine sentiment <b>label</b> <b>elements</b> to form a mid-level visual sentiment representation. Our experiments indicate that SentiPair outperforms other competing mid-level attributes. Using SentiPair, our analysis frameworkcan achieve satisfying prediction accuracy (72. 6 %). We also opened ourdataset (GSO- 2015) to the research community. GSO- 2015 contains more than 6, 000 manually annotated GIFs out of more than 40, 000 candidates.

40|$|Since Descartes, {{coordinates}} {{have been}} the standard mathematical construct for describing and manipulating geometric objects. In addition, indices are commonly used to <b>label</b> <b>elements</b> of discrete geometric structures, such as polygon meshes. Since the coordinates and indices are numbers, they can be manipulated algebraically. This sets the framework for the handling of geometric objects in algebraic terms that {{is the essence of}} analytic geometry. In some modeling applications, however, the use of coordinates leads to complications that are not inherent in the modeling problems themselves.

40|$|Abstract There is {{a strong}} push from the farming {{community}} in Australia to persuade the government to legislate the compulsory display of country-of-origin labelling on retail products. This research examines the <b>label</b> <b>elements</b> considered by grocery shoppers who are inclined to examine the country of manufacture. Shoppers {{are most likely to}} consider the brand name when choosing a product, with the odds ratio of taking note of the country of manufacture being the largest for those consumers who scrutinize the name of the product and for those who ascribe the highest importance to the product’s country of manufacture. Overt identification as Australian origin, for products without a recognizable brand name may therefore not be advantageous to Australian producers. Country-of-origin prone shoppers also seek stronger reassurance from other cues on the product label. Shoppers would have to contend with the inevitable higher prices arising from label recomposition and country-of-origin compliance. To what extent increased prices would dampen demand is a moot point...|$|E
40|$|Polymers with an ordered {{molecular}} structure {{can be applied}} in optical systems for e. g. data transport, data storage and displays. Patterned UV photo-polymerization is used to prepare polymer gratings from a mixture of two acrylate monomers. A 3 MeV proton microprobe is used to study these gratings, prepared from two different monomers, each containing a different easily detectable label element, e. g. Cl, Si or F. During the preparation process, the difference in reactivity and mobility of these two monomers in combination with polymer–monomer interaction results in diffusion of monomers. Since this diffusion process takes place on length scales of micrometers, a scanning ion microprobe is {{a powerful tool for}} the quantitative analysis of the polymer films, obtained after complete polymerization. The microprobe is equipped with PIXE, PIGE and RBS, to quantify both the <b>label</b> <b>elements</b> and C and O. This makes it possible to determine the concentration of monomer units as a function of position and thus to study the diffusion process. Two combinations of different monomers are studied. In the case of a 0. 5 : 1 mixture of a monofunctional and a difunctional monomer, both monomers migrate to the illuminated areas and large thickness variations are observed. When a 1 : 1 mixture of two difunctional monomers is used, opposite migration of the two monomers is observed, while the film shows no variation in thickness...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The present paper {{focuses on}} the level of {{attention}} and comprehension that Greek schoolchildren have of food labels. Three different age groups (8 th, 10 th and 12 th years of age) are examined. A large dataset from various districts in the wider Athens region has been used. Design/methodology/approach – The British Food Standards Agency questionnaire used for the same purpose in the UK was adopted and adapted to the local circumstances. Findings – The sampled schoolchildren pay attention at certain food labels elements only, and they may do so only when they purchase a product for the first time. There is an associated lack of understanding, and medium to high levels of erroneous interpretation for some food label related information. No major differences are found to exist between age groups. Research limitations/implications – Methods suitable for fostering awareness and clarity in student mindsets regarding food <b>label</b> <b>elements</b> need development. Practical implications – There is a substantial need to alter the method for the exchange and provision of information to schoolchildren regarding food label information is concerned, as the current status of affairs seems to be unsatisfactory.

In this paper, {{we describe}} a new, complementary system, called DroidMiner, which uses static analysis to automatically mine malicious program logic from known Android malware, abstracts this logic into {{a sequence of}} threat modalities, and then seeks out these threat modality patterns in other unknown (or newly published) An-droid apps. We formalize a two-level behavioral graph representation used to capture Android app program logic, and design new techniques to identify and <b>label</b> <b>elements</b> of the graph that capture malicious behavioral patterns (or ma-licious modalities). After the automatic learning of these malicious behavioral models, DroidMiner can scan a new Android app to (i) determine whether it con-tains malicious modalities, (ii) diagnose the malware family {{to which it is}} most closely associated, (iii) and provide further evidence as to why the app is con-sidered to be malicious by including a concise description of identified malicious behaviors. We evaluate DroidMiner using 2, 466 malicious apps, identified from a corpus of over 67, 000 third-party market Android apps, plus an additional set of over 10, 000 official market Android apps. Using this set of real-world apps, we demonstrate that DroidMiner achieves a 95. 3 % detection rate, with only a 0. 4 % false positive rate. We further evaluate DroidMiner’s ability to classify malicious apps under their proper family labels, and measure its label accuracy at 92 %...|$|E

We assessed the extent of compliance with 14 countries' HWL requirements. Unique cigarette packs were purchased in 2013 using a systematic protocol in 12 distinct neighborhoods within three of the ten most populous cities in the 14 low- and middle-income countries with the greatest number (count) of smokers. HWL compliance codebooks were developed for each country based on the details of country-specific HWL requirements, with up to four common compliance indicators assessed for each country (location, size, <b>label</b> <b>elements,</b> text size). Packs (n= 1859) were double coded for compliance. Compliance was examined by country and pack characteristics, including parent company and brand family. Overall, 72 % of coded cigarette packs were compliant with all relevant compliance indicators, ranging from 17 % in the Philippines to 94 % in Mexico. Compliance was highest for location of the warning (ranging from 75 %– 100 %) and lowest for warning size (ranging from 46 %– 99 %). Compliance was higher for packs bought in high SES neighborhoods, and varied by parent company and brand family. This multi-country study found at least one pack in every country – and many packs in some countries – that were not compliant with key requirements for health warning labels in the country of purchase. Non-compliance may be exacerbating health disparities. Tobacco companies should be held accountable for complying with country HWL requirements...|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{nutritional}} labelling {{is difficult to}} interpret and time-consuming to read. This {{is a major problem}} as many consumers are overweight and resort to eating readymade meals and snacks. These are likely to be energy-dense food and beverages that are high in fat, sugar and artificial preservatives. Simplifying nutritional labels could help stem rising obesity rates. Front-of-pack labels are a tool to help overcome this problem by providing consumers with understandable, visible information to aid them into making healthier food choices. This study expands on past research by evaluating 7 separate pre-existing, proposed and fictitious front-of-pack nutritional labels. It includes Information, Image or a combination of both Information and Image based labels. Plus No label, which is a control variable to determine the effectiveness of each label. The nutritional labels were placed on a chicken salad sandwich which was kept consistent for all 14 manipulations. The nutritional components were altered to reflect either an Unhealthy or Healthy sandwich. The design of this experiment is a 2 (nutritional level: Healthy, Unhealthy) X 7 (labelling system: Traffic Light, Star, Running, Walking, Third Party, Daily Intake, Caloric, None) between subjects design. The results provide evidence of the urgent need to communicate nutritional information more effectively. Images, simplicity, colour and reliability, are determining <b>label</b> <b>elements</b> that influence consumption behaviour. The results from this study help to understand behaviours associated to labels. This study draws differences between those who partake in health behaviours and those who do not. This information could help to trigger support for a new, more effective front-of-pack labelling system to be put in place globally to guide consumers in making healthier food choices...|$|E

40|$|Unlike {{standard}} {{learning problems}} which involve simple scalar outputs, structured prediction deals with structured outputs such as sequences, grids, or more general graphs. Ideally, one {{would want to}} make joint predictions on the structured labels instead of simply predicting each element independently, as this additionally accounts for the statistical correlations between <b>label</b> <b>elements,</b> {{as well as between}} training examples and their labels. These properties make structured prediction appealing {{for a wide range of}} applications such as scene understanding, image segmentation, computational biology and natural language parsing. In many structured prediction tasks, there is useful modeling information that is not available as part of the training data. For example, in object detection, one is typically given a training image with a bounding box around the object, but not the locations of the object parts. Similarly, in machine translation, one may be given the translation of a training sentence, but not the hidden linguistic structure. This missing information is important for learning a good model, and incorporating it may result in better prediction. Structured prediction models with hidden variables have been recently proposed, including log-likelihood models such as hidden conditional random fields (HCRFs, [1]), and latent structured support vector machines (SVMs) [3]. For HCRFs, learning is done by performing gradient descent to minimize a smooth non-convex function. Learning latent structured SVMs is done by the convex-concave procedure, iteratively minimizing convex regularized structured hinge loss. More formally, in structured prediction the goal is to learn the weighting of the features such that it best explains the training data. The weighting parameters θ are typically learned by minimizing the norm-dependent loss (x,y) ∈...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesChemical hazard {{communication}} {{is intended to}} alert users of the potential hazards of chemicals. Apart {{from the fact that}} hazard information should be understood, it is also important that it should be recalled. Recall of {{hazard communication}} is critical when the written form of the information is not available at the time it is required. A cross-sectional study investigating predictors of the recall of chemical safety information on labels and safety data sheets amongst 315 workers (industry, transport and agriculture sectors) and 87 consumers in two provinces of South Africa was conducted. The recall of participants was tested using two modules (module 2 which relates to the demographics, and module 3 which relates to the recall of the participants) from the Hazard Communication Comprehensibility Testing (CT) Tool developed by the Centre for Environmental and Occupational Health at the University of Cape Town. Respondents were predominantly male (67. 7 %), the median age was 37 years (IQR: 30 - 46 years) and {{less than half of the}} participants completed high school (47. 5 %). The majority of participants were blue collar workers outside of industry (55. 5 %). The skull and crossbones symbol was the label element most recalled, both unprompted (79. 6 %) and prompted (94. 8 %), and the first aid and treatment measures the least frequently recalled (6. 0 %- 29. 9 %). Multivariate analysis showed the predictors that were found to increase the recall of all the <b>label</b> <b>elements</b> were, industrial sector, transport sector, agriculture sector, gender, home language English and Afrikaans, reading English and Afrikaans, completing high school and non-industry white collar occupations.

This study found demographic factors to influence the recall of hazard information. Policy should ensure the implementation of procedures that promote the recall of hazard information to protect workers from hazardous exposures...|$|E
40|$|A digital {{equivalent}} dat{{a system}} (DEDS) {{is a system}} for identifying objects {{by means of the}} x-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectra of <b>labeling</b> <b>elements</b> that are encased in or deposited on the objects. As such, a DEDS is a revolutionary new major subsystem of an XRF system. A DEDS embodies the means for converting the spectral data output of an XRF scanner to an ASCII alphanumeric or barcode label {{that can be used to}} identify (or verify the assumed or apparent identity of) an XRF-scanned object. A typical XRF spectrum of interest contains peaks at photon energies associated with specific elements on the Periodic Table (see figure). The height of each spectral peak above the local background spectral intensity is proportional to the relative abundance of the corresponding element. Alphanumeric values are assigned to the relative abundances of the elements. Hence, if an object contained <b>labeling</b> <b>elements</b> in suitably chosen proportions, an alphanumeric representation of the object could be extracted from its XRF spectrum. The mixture of <b>labeling</b> <b>elements</b> and for reading the XRF spectrum would be compatible with one of the labeling conventions now used for bar codes and binary matrix patterns (essentially, two-dimensional bar codes that resemble checkerboards). A further benefit of such compatibility is that it would enable the conversion of the XRF spectral output to a bar or matrix-coded label, if needed. In short, a process previously used only for material composition analysis has been reapplied to the world of identification. This new level of verification is now being used for "authentication. ...|$|R
40|$|Systems for {{identifying}} objects {{by means of}} x-ray fluorescence (XRF) of encased <b>labeling</b> <b>elements</b> have been developed. The XRF spectra of objects so labeled would be analogous to the external bar code labels now used to track objects in everyday commerce. In conjunction with computer-based tracking systems, databases, and labeling conventions, the XRF labels {{could be used in}} essentially the same manner as that of bar codes to track inventories and to record and process commercial transactions. In addition, as summarized briefly below, embedded XRF labels could be used to verify the authenticity of products, thereby helping to deter counterfeiting and fraud. A system, as described above, is called an encased core product identification and authentication system (ECPIAS). The ECPIAS concept is a modified version of that of a related recently initiated commercial development of handheld XRF spectral scanners that would identify alloys or detect <b>labeling</b> <b>elements</b> deposited on the surfaces of objects. In contrast, an ECPIAS would utilize <b>labeling</b> <b>elements</b> encased within the objects of interest. The basic ECPIAS concept is best illustrated by means of an example of one of several potential applications: labeling of cultured pearls by labeling the seed particles implanted in oysters to grow the pearls. Each pearl farmer would be assigned a unique mixture of <b>labeling</b> <b>elements</b> that could be distinguished from the corresponding mixtures of other farmers. The mixture would be either incorporated into or applied to the surfaces of the seed prior to implantation in the oyster. If necessary, the labeled seed would be further coated to make it nontoxic to the oyster. After implantation, the growth of layers of mother of pearl on the seed would encase the XRF labels, making these labels integral, permanent parts of the pearls that could not be removed without destroying the pearls themselves. The XRF labels would be read by use of XRF scanners, the spectral data outputs of which would be converted to alphanumeric data in a digital equivalent data system (DEDS), which is the subject of the previous article. These alphanumeric data would be used to track the pearls through all stages of commerce, from the farmer to the retail customer...|$|R
