5|$|Lemurs {{have been}} the focus of {{monographic}} series, action plans, field guides, and classic works in ethology. However, few species have been thoroughly studied to date, and most research has been preliminary and restricted to a single locality. Only recently have numerous scientific papers been published to explain the basic aspects of behavior and ecology of poorly known species. Field studies have given insights on population dynamics and evolutionary ecology of most genera and many species. Long-term research focused on identified individuals is in its infancy and has only been started for a few populations. However, <b>learning</b> <b>opportunities</b> are dwindling as habitat destruction and other factors threaten the existence of lemur populations across the island.|$|E

The {{district is}} extremely diverse with students from families speaking 70 different languages, although only four languages {{are used for}} most school communication: English, Spanish, Hmong, and Somali. The district runs 82 different schools, including 52 elementary schools, twelve middle schools, seven high schools, ten alternative schools, and one special education school, employing over 6,500 teachers and staff. The school district also oversees community education programs for pre-K and adult learners, including Early Childhood Family Education, GED Diploma, language programs, and various <b>learning</b> <b>opportunities</b> for community members of all ages. In 2006, Saint Paul Public Schools celebrated its 150th anniversary.

This paper reports a test of whether conditions which facilitate objective probability learning yield decisions better described by expected utility theory than is the case in experiments devoid of <b>learning</b> <b>opportunity.</b> The data show that expected utility maximising behaviour increases with the <b>learning</b> <b>opportunity,</b> but so too do systematic violations.

40|$|Violations of {{expected}} utility theory are sometimes attributed to imprecise preferences interacting {{with a lack}} of <b>learning</b> <b>opportunity</b> in the experimental laboratory. This paper reports an experimental test of whether a <b>learning</b> <b>opportunity</b> which engenders accurate probability assessments, by enhancing understanding of the meaning of stated probability information, causes anomalous behaviour to diminish. The data show that whilst in some cases expected utility maximising behaviour increases with the <b>learning</b> <b>opportunity,</b> so too do systematic violations. Therefore, there should be no presumption that anomalous behaviour under risk is transient and that discovered preferences will be appropriately described by expected utility theory.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a method for {{estimating}} and comparing the consequences of clerkship placements (i. e., <b>learning</b> <b>opportunity)</b> to estimates of clerkship training costs (i. e., impact on site productivity). Three administrators, 14 preceptors, 17 students participating in community, institutional, ambulatory care, drug information, and adult acute care clerkships affiliated with The University of Arizona provided the information used to develop and test two algorithms. Student activity was the unit of analysis used in both algorithms. The <b>learning</b> <b>opportunity</b> algorithm rank-ordered student activities based on the level of involvement, completeness of experience, completeness of experiential learning cycle, and performance feedback. The site impact algorithm rank-ordered activities based on the level of supervision, number of supervisors, training time to participation time ratio, and necessity. Use of the two algorithms can generate information about <b>learning</b> <b>opportunity</b> and impact for negotiating and evaluating clerkship placements...|$|R
