The screws are usually inserted into an edge on the <b>long</b> <b>grain</b> side of one member and extend through the joint into the end grain of the adjacent member. For this reason, long screws are required (usually 3 times {{the thickness of the}} member) to ensure good traction. These joints may also be glued although it is not necessary.|$|E

2500|$|A {{butt joint}} is a {{technique}} in which two pieces of wood [...] are joined by simply placing their ends together without any special shaping. The name 'butt joint' comes {{from the way the}} wood is joint together. The butt joint is the simplest joint to make since it merely involves cutting the wood [...] to the appropriate length and [...] butting them together. It is also the weakest because unless some form of reinforcement is used (see below) it relies upon glue alone to hold it together. Because the orientation of the wood usually presents only one end to <b>long</b> <b>grain</b> gluing surface, the resulting joint is inherently weak.|$|E

We observe differences in layer velocity profile and in net grain velocity for grains that are composed of one, two, or three colinear spheres.
