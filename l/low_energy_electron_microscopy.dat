50|$|More recently, {{his studies}} have focused on the {{dynamics}} of surface and interface processes such as phase transitions, chemisorption and etching, epitaxial growth, and aspects of nanotechnology. Ultrahigh-vacuum transmission electron microscopy and low-energy electron microscopy allow detailed, real-time, in situ observations of such processes with high spatial resolution. Using those techniques, the studies have shed new light on the thermodynamics of epitaxial growth, the dynamic evolution of the surface morphology of epitaxial films, the self-assembly of quantum dots, the spatio-temporal character of first- and second-order phase transitions at surfaces, etc. He has also developed a novel <b>Low</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Electron</b> <b>Microscopy</b> instrument, including energy filtering and aberration correction.|$|E

To avoid this problem with structures composed of light elements, a reduction in beam voltage going down to 5 keV has recently been proposed. The range below 5 keV has not been explored yet for this purpose, although electron scattering in matter is lower for these energies, which allows achieving a higher spatial resolution.

We found a qualitative and quantitative change {{in the behavior of}} ρ(T,B) upon thickness of the multigraphene samples, indicating that their internal microstructure is important. The overall results indicate that the metallic-like behavior of ρ(T) at zero field measured for bulk graphite samples is not intrinsic of ideal graphite. The results suggest that the interfaces between crystalline regions may be responsible for the superconducting-like properties observed in graphite. Our transport measurements also show that reducing the sample lateral size as well as the length between voltage electrodes decreases the magnetoresistance, in agreement with recently published results. The magnetoresistance of the multigraphene samples shows a scaling of the form ((R(B) - R(0)) /R(0)) /T^α = f(B/T) with a sample dependent exponent α∼ 1, which applies in the whole temperature 2 K < T < 270 K and magnetic field range B < 8 T.

40|$|Selective laser {{sintering}} (SLS) {{was used to}} prepare components from polycarbonate (PC) powder. The effects of energy density of the laser beam, ranging from 0. 036 to 0. 12 J mm - 2, on the physical density, tensile properties and morphology of the sintered specimens were investigated. At <b>low</b> <b>energy</b> density levels, the physical density and tensile strength of the specimens were found to increase {{with the increase in}} energy density. Smoke was observed when the components were sintered under an energy density above 0. 09 J mm - 2, which suggests degradation of the PC powder. These specimens appeared slightly yellow and there was a reduction in the density and tensile strength. In specimens built under a <b>low</b> <b>energy</b> density, scanning <b>electron</b> <b>microscopy</b> (SEM) showed that slight fusion occurred at the surface of the PC particles. The individual particles could be identified and the voids between the particles were interconnected. The crack propagated between the particles during tensile fracture. When the energy density was high, the powder was fused thoroughly which allowed a more dense structure to be built. SEM also showed that fusion was more effective within the individual layers of the PC powder, whilst considerable amounts of voids were present between the layers. Therefore, the strength of the components normal to the layers is expected to be lower than the in-plane strength of the layers. Some wavy circular features were observed on the fracture surfaces of the specimens built under a high energy density. Such features are commonly found on the fracture surfaces of brittle plastics.
