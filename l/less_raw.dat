5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1970s, Philly soul, funk, {{rock and}} most other genres were {{dominated}} by disco-inflected tracks. During this period, funk bands like The O'Jays and The Spinners continued to turn out hits. After the death of disco in 1980, soul music survived for a short time before going through yet another metamorphosis. With the introduction of influences from electro music and funk, soul music became <b>less</b> <b>raw</b> and more slickly produced, resulting in a genre of music that was again called R, usually distinguished from the earlier rhythm and blues by identifying it as contemporary R.|$|E
5|$|During the mid-1970s, highly {{slick and}} {{commercial}} bands such as Philly soul group The O'Jays and blue-eyed soul group Hall & Oates achieved mainstream success. By {{the end of}} the 1970s, most music genres, including soul, had been disco-influenced. With the introduction of influences from electro music and funk in the late 1970s and early 1980s, soul music became <b>less</b> <b>raw</b> and more slickly produced, resulting in a genre of music that was once again called R, usually distinguished from the earlier rhythm and blues by identifying it as contemporary R.|$|E

It became <b>less</b> <b>raw</b> and more slickly produced, resulting in a style known as contemporary R, which sounded {{very different from the}} original rhythm and blues style. The United States saw the development of neo-soul around 1994. Mainstream record label marketing support for soul genres cooled in the 2000s due to the industry's re-focus on hip-hop.|$|E

25|$|Soft hammer {{finished}} {{pieces are}} usually balanced, symmetrical {{and can be}} relatively smooth. Soft hammer works {{first appeared in the}} Acheulean period, allowing tools with these markings {{to be used as a}} post quem estimation, but with no greater precision. The main advantage of a soft hammer is that a flintknapper is able to remove broader, thinner flakes with barely developed heels, which allows a cutting edge to be maintained or even improved with minimal raw material wastage. However, a high-quality raw material is required to make their use effective. No studies compare the two methods in terms of yield per unit weight of raw material, or the difference in energy use. The use of a soft hammer requires greater use of force by the flintknapper and a steeper learning curve, although it offers more flakes for <b>less</b> <b>raw</b> material.|$|E

Particular parallels were made between Bloc Party and Gang of Four upon their arrival on the music scene, yet the band were [...] "mildly infuriated" [...] at such references, claiming they had never [...] "particularly liked" [...] Gang of Four. To achieve their unique style, numerous delay and other effects pedals are implemented. During the recording of second album A Weekend in the City, the band suggested it would contain [...] "some truly R styled beats, a song where [...] and [...] play drums simultaneously [...] both eggshell-thin fragility and trouser-flapping hugeness", as opposed to their typical sound. The style has been compared to and inspired by such bands as Radiohead, U2, Depeche Mode, and Björk. Some of the most noticeable changes between debut Silent Alarm and A Weekend in the City are that the songs became more layered and <b>less</b> <b>raw</b> due to inclusion of string arrangements.|$|E
2500|$|While the {{material}} cost is significantly higher for all-glass fiber blades than for hybrid glass/carbon fiber blades, {{there is a}} potential for tremendous savings in manufacturing costs when labor price is considered. [...] Utilizing carbon fiber enables for simpler designs that use <b>less</b> <b>raw</b> material. [...] The chief manufacturing process in blade fabrication is the layering of plies. [...] By reducing the number of layers of plies, as is enabled by thinner blade design, the cost of labor may be decreased, and in some cases, equate to the cost of labor for glass fiber blades.|$|E

60|$|There {{is reason}} to think that certain organisms which pass through a monad stage of existence, such as the Myxomycetes, are, at one time of their lives, {{dependent}} upon external sources for their protein matter, or are animals; and, at another period, manufacture it, or are plants. And seeing that the whole progress of modern investigation is in favour of the doctrine of continuity, it is a fair and probable speculation--though only a speculation--that, as there are some plants which can manufacture protein out of such apparently intractable mineral matters as carbonic acid, water, nitrate of ammonia, metallic and earthy salts; while others need to be supplied with their carbon and nitrogen in the somewhat <b>less</b> <b>raw</b> form of tartrate of ammonia and allied compounds; so there may be yet others, as is possibly the case with the true parasitic plants, which can only manage to put together materials still better prepared--still more nearly approximated to protein--until we arrive at such organisms as the Psorospermioe and the Panhistophyton, which are as much animal as vegetable in structure, but are animal in their dependence on other organisms for their food.|$|E

25|$|The {{standard}} sanitation {{technology in}} urban areas is the collection of wastewater in gravity driven sewers, its treatment in wastewater treatment plants for reuse or disposal in rivers, lakes or the sea. Sewers are either combined with storm drains or separated from them as sanitary sewers. Combined sewers are usually found in the central, older parts or urban areas. Heavy rainfall and inadequate maintenance can lead to combined sewer overflows or sanitary sewer overflows, i.e., more or <b>less</b> diluted <b>raw</b> sewage being discharged into the environment.
