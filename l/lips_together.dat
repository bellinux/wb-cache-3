500|$|Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times {{found the}} first half of the episode [...] "quite effective", with the [...] "camera angles, spooky music and jumpy sequences... as {{frightening}} as those found in any horror movie, with an added twist of suspense". However, she deemed the depiction of the ghostly villain as [...] "pretty silly", and noted the second half [...] "stops building suspense and turns predictable". Calling the series [...] "Ghostbusters' Creek", Stanley felt the episode [...] "reverts to a WB family drama about the bonds between two mismatched brothers and their father". Similarly, Matthew Gilbert of the Boston Globe called Ackles and Padalecki [...] "generic cuties who hold their <b>lips</b> <b>together</b> tightly, except to utter the word Dude". Although Gilbert noted there are a couple [...] "moderately creepy" [...] twists, he found there to be [...] "nothing about the central family story in Supernatural or its bland actors that makes it addictive".|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was filmed in Milan, Italy between {{the dates of}} the 2009 leg of her Sticky & Sweet Tour. The concept of the video is in {{similarity}} to {{the title of the}} song; celebration of Madonna's career. According to MTV, the video is a throwback to Madonna's Erotica era and encompasses a dark music image. The Benny Benassi remix of the song is used in the video. It starts with Madonna asking the line [...] "Haven't I seen you somewhere before?". The music starts and the scenes cut between Madonna and her dancers start dancing to the music of the song. Madonna wears a crystal embossed, shouldered Balmain dress with knee-high Christian Louboutin boots. While she is present in almost every frame of the camera, she does not perform choreographed dance moves. Her dance is mostly confined to casual maneuvers. The dancers on the other hand, perform choreographed moves as a solo act. As the song progresses, more dancers are shown and they ultimately reach a club. The DJ in the club is portrayed by model Jesus Luz. Madonna indulges in sensual poses with him and removes his clothes in an attempt to recognize him, as the line [...] "I guess I don't recognize you with your clothes on" [...] is played. The two of them brush their <b>lips</b> <b>together,</b> and Madonna moves away to the dance floor again. Lourdes makes an appearance {{near the end of the}} video. She appears in an eighties styled, polka-dotted leotard and pants, and does a back arch on the ground. Madonna is then shown on the ground on all fours, or dancing while grabbing her groin. Both Madonna's and her dancer's moves are edited to appear in fast forward. Hip hop styled dancing is showcased towards the end of the video. [...] The end shot of the video portrays Madonna sliding down on the ground. Teaser trailers for the video, show Oakenfold dancing to the song, but his scenes are not included in the final version.|$|E
500|$|... "Showdown" [...] has [...] "bubbly" [...] {{beats and}} its lyrics, about [...] "fighting and making up with carnal relations", include the lines [...] "I don’t {{really want to}} be a tease / But would you undo my zipper, please?" [...] Rolling Stone {{classified}} the song a pop-dancehall. The fourth track, [...] "Breathe on Me", was described as the most sensual song of the record. Containing trip hop influences, Spears sings, [...] "Oh, it's so hot, and I need some air/ And boy, don't stop 'cause I'm halfway there" [...] and [...] "Just put your <b>lips</b> <b>together</b> and blow." [...] "Early Mornin'" [...] depicts Spears looking for men at a club in New York City. The song has a percolating beat and featured subdued vocals from Spears, who purrs and yawns through the track. The nightclub Show is referenced. [...] "Toxic", which Spears later named as her favorite song from her career, was originally offered to Kylie Minogue. Released as the album's second single, it contains elements of electropop and bhangra music, and features varied instrumentation, such as drums, synthesizers, high-pitched strings and surf guitars. Lyrically, [...] "Toxic" [...] talks about being addicted to a lover. [...] "Outrageous", the fourth and final single from the album, is a hip hop-inspired track that according to MTV features Spears [...] "whisper and moan [...] with a snake charmer melody giving the song an exotic feel." [...] The lyrics talk about materialism and amusement, with the singer referencing in the chorus {{a number of things that}} give her pleasure. In [...] "Touch of My Hand", which Spears felt it was comparable to Janet Jackson's [...] "That's the Way Love Goes" [...] (1993), she sings in a lower register. The instrumentation contains elements of Middle Eastern music and its lyrics refer to masturbation, [...] "I will be bold/ Going to the places where I can be out of control/ Don't want to explain tonight/ All the things I try to hide." ...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the reliability of 2 scoring systems. DESIGN: This study used a retrospective analysis of the results of complete unilateral cleft lip and palate patients. SETTING: The study was conducted at the VU Medical Center and the Academic Center for Dentistry of Amsterdam. PATIENTS: Patients were complete unilateral cleft lip and palate patients at the age of 6 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Assessment of the nose and <b>lip</b> <b>together</b> and separately with a numerical photographic reference scoring system and with a 5 -point ordinal scale without the use of a reference photograph by 6 judges. Intraobserver and interobserver reliability was calculated; both ways of assessment were compared by using Kendall tau. RESULTS: Photographs were available of 55 children (6 years old, 38 boys and 17 girls) with a complete unilateral cleft lip and palate. The interobserver reliabilities of the <b>lip</b> and nose <b>together</b> were 0. 53 and, for the nose and lip separately, 0. 51 and 0. 43, respectively with the use of the numerical scale. In the 5 -point scale, these were 0. 55 for the nose and <b>lip</b> <b>together</b> and 0. 57 and 0. 45 for the nose and lip separately, respectively. Furthermore, it was found that the lip dominates in the scorings of the <b>lip</b> and nose <b>together</b> (linear regression analysis). CONCLUSIONS: The 2 tested systems are equivalent in their reliability and outcome. The lip is dominating in the overall scorings. It is advocated to use the 5 -point scale without the use of a reference photograph and to assess the lip and nose separately. © 2014 Mutaz B. Habal, MD...|$|R
