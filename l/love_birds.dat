25|$|In 1913, Grossmith {{starred in}} The Girl on the Film first in London {{and then in}} New York, where he joined with Edward Laurillard, who had earlier {{produced}} his musical The <b>Love</b> <b>Birds,</b> to produce plays and musicals. Grossmith {{established himself as a}} major producer with Laurillard, bringing Potash and Perlmutter, by Montague Glass, to London in 1914 for a long run at the Queen's Theatre. They then produced the successful Tonight's the Night, based on the farce Pink Dominoes, first at the Shubert Theatre in New York in 1914 and then moved it to the Gaiety Theatre, London in 1915.|$|E
25|$|The Savoy Theatre {{closed in}} 1903, and was reopened under the {{management}} of John Leigh and Edward Laurillard from February 1904 (beginning with a musical, The <b>Love</b> <b>Birds)</b> to December 1906. The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company returned to the Savoy for repertory seasons between 1906 and 1909, in which year C. H. Workman took over {{the management of}} the theatre. He produced, among other works, Gilbert's final opera, with music by German, Fallen Fairies in 1909–10, which ran for only 51 performances. He also produced Two Merry Monarchs and Orpheus and Eurydice in 1910, the latter of which starred Marie Brema and Viola Tree in the title roles. The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company did not play in the theatre from 1909 until 1929, instead touring throughout Britain and playing London seasons in other theatres; other works held the stage of the Savoy. George Augustus Richardson managed the theatre from November 1911 to February 1915. The Mikado's record as the Savoy's longest-running production was broken by the comedy Paddy the Next Best Thing, which played for 867 performances from April 1920.|$|E

500|$|References to Anbe Vaa {{are made}} in various films. The 1988 film Puthiya Vaanam, {{starring}} Sivaji Ganesan, was named after {{the song of the}} same name. Films like Rajavin Parvaiyile (1995), <b>Love</b> <b>Birds</b> (1996), and the upcoming Rajavin Parvai Raniyin Pakkam were also named after songs from Anbe Vaa. In Unakkaga Ellam Unakkaga (1999), Kundalakesi (Goundamani) imagines himself as M. G. Ramachandran in [...] "Pudhiya Vaanam" [...] by dancing with children, which results in him being mistaken for a kidnapper by the police. In Kathai Thiraikathai Vasanam Iyakkam (2014), Thamizh (Santhosh Prathap) is an aspiring filmmaker who reads stories by F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ponniyin Selvan, but is forced to listen to anecdotes about films such as Anbe Vaa.|$|E

2500|$|The {{following}} year, Rahman {{received the}} Rajat Kamal (Silver Lotus) {{award for best}} music director at the National Film Awards for Roja. The films' score was critically and commercially successful in its original and dubbed versions, led by the innovative theme [...] "Chinna Chinna Aasai". Rahman followed this with successful scores and songs for Tamil–language films for the Chennai film industry, including Ratnam's politically-charged Bombay, the urban Kadhalan, Thiruda Thiruda and S. Shankar's debut film Gentleman (with its popular dance song, [...] "Chikku Bukku Rayile"). Rahman collaborated with director Bharathiraaja on Kizhakku Cheemayile and Karuththamma, producing successful Tamil rural folk-inspired film songs; he also composed for K. Balachander's Duet, which had some memorable Saxophone themes. The 1995 film Indira and romantic comedies Mr. Romeo and <b>Love</b> <b>Birds</b> also drew attention.|$|E

2500|$|Stevenson {{proved to}} be a popular public speaker, gaining a {{national}} reputation as an intellectual, with a self-deprecating sense of humor to match. One example came when the Illinois legislature passed a bill (supported by bird lovers) declaring that cats roaming unescorted was a public nuisance. Stevenson vetoed the bill, and sent this public message regarding the veto: [...] "It is in the nature of cats to do a certain amount of unescorted roaming...the problem of cat versus bird is as old as time. If we attempt to solve it by legislation who knows but what we may be called upon to take sides as well in the age old problem of dog versus cat, bird versus bird, or even bird versus worm. In my opinion, the State of Illinois and its local governing bodies already have enough to do without trying to control feline delinquency. For these reasons, and not because I <b>love</b> <b>birds</b> the less or cats the more, I veto and withhold my approval from Senate Bill No. 93." ...|$|E
