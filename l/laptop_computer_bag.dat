40|$|This report {{summarizes}} a Bachelor Degree Project in Product Design Engineering, {{carried out}} during the spring semester in 2007 by one student on the Product Design Engineering programme at University of Skövde. The project was performed as an assignment for Comfort Cooling AB, a company in Skövde that manufactures cooling clothes and products for medical use. The purpose of the project is to design a suitcase for laptops that is used also as a workstation. It has a cooler system, provided by Comfort Cooling that works with no external energy. It has a base made of foam sheet, to adapt it to {{the legs of the}} user. And it has as well all the normal features characteristically of a suitcase for laptops, such as pockets, handles and security features. The first step in the project was to perform market research in order to gather customer needs. It was found that the primary features of a laptop suitcase are that it is waterproof, {{that it is possible to}} carry the suitcase on ones back, that there are trays on both sides of the suitcase, and that the suitcase will be available in a range of patterns and colours. After that, the design of the possible solutions for each requirement started to be developed. Once all the requirements of the project were satisfied with different solutions, each one of them were evaluated in order to identify the solutions that in the best way met the stated product requirements. Finally a mock-up was produced for communicating the final design proposal and for enabling basic user trials to be carried out, as well as the final result, i. e. the design and the mock-up of the laptop suitcase. The report portrays the product design process and methods utilized in the project, as well as the final result (the mock up) of the <b>laptop</b> <b>computer</b> <b>bag</b> with integrated cooling effect and workstation...|$|E

40|$|In {{response}} {{to the need for}} more rapid and iterative feedback on customer preferences, researchers are developing new web-based conjoint analysis methods that adapt the design of conjoint questions based on a respondent’s answers to previous questions. Adapting within a respondent is a difficult dy-namic optimization problem and until recently adaptive conjoint analysis (ACA) was the dominant method available for addressing this adaptation. In this paper we apply and test a new polyhedral method that uses “interior-point” math programming techniques. This method is benchmarked against both ACA and an efficient non-adaptive design (Fixed). Over 300 respondents were randomly assigned to different experimental conditions and were asked to complete a web-based conjoint exercise. The conditions varied based on the design of the con-joint exercise. Respondents in one group completed a conjoint exercise designed using the ACA method, respondents in another group completed an exercise designed using the Fixed method, and the remaining respondents completed an exercise designed using the polyhedral method. Following the conjoint exer-cise respondents were given $ 100 and allowed to make a purchase from a Pareto choice set of five new-to-the-market <b>laptop</b> <b>computer</b> <b>bags.</b> The respondents received their chosen bag together with the differ-ence in cash between the price of their chosen bag and the $ 100. We compare the methods on both internal and external validity. Internal validity is evaluated by comparing how well the different conjoint methods predict several holdout conjoint questions. External validity is evaluated by comparing how well the conjoint methods predict the respondents’ selections from the choice sets of five bags. The results reveal a remarkable level of consistency across the two validation tasks. The polyhe-dral method was consistently more accurate than both the ACA and Fixed methods. However, even better performance was achieved by combining (post hoc) different components of each method to create a range of hybrid methods. Additional analyses evaluate the robustness of the predictions and explore al-ternative estimation methods such as Hierarchical Bayes. At the time of the test, the bags were proto-types. Based, in part, on {{the results of this study}} these bags are now commercially available.

40|$|We propose {{and test}} new "polyhedral" {{question}} design and estimation methods that use {{recent developments in}} mathematical programming. The methods are designed to offer accurate estimates after relatively few questions in problems involving many parameters. With polyhedral question design, each respondent's questions are adapted based upon prior answers by that respondent to reduce a feasible set of parameters as rapidly as possible. Polyhedral estimation provides estimates based on a centrality criterion (the "analytic center" of the feasible parameter set). The methods require computer support but can operate in both Internet and other computer-aided environments with no noticeable delay between questions. We evaluate the proposed methods using two approaches. First, we use Monte Carlo simulations to compare the methods against established benchmarks {{in a variety of}} domains. In the simulations we compare polyhedral question design to three benchmarks: random selection, efficient Fixed designs, and Adaptive Conjoint Analysis (ACA). We compare polyhedral estimation to Hierarchical Bayes estimation for each question design method. The simulations evaluate the methods across different levels of respondent heterogeneity, response accuracy, and numbers of questions. For low numbers of questions, polyhedral question design does best (or is tied for best) for all domains. For high numbers of questions, efficient Fixed designs do better in some domains. The best estimation method depends on respondent heterogeneity and response accuracy. Polyhedral (analytic center) estimation shows particular promise for high heterogeneity and/or for low response errors. The second evaluation employs a large-scale field test. The field test involved 330 respondents, who were randomly assigned to a question-design method and asked to complete a web-based conjoint exercise. Following the conjoint exercise, respondents were given $ 100 and allowed to make a purchase from a Pareto choice set of five new-to-the-market <b>laptop</b> <b>computer</b> <b>bags.</b> The respondents received their chosen bag together with the difference in cash between the price of their chosen bag and the $ 100. We compare the question-design and estimation methods on both internal validity (holdout tasks) and external validity (actual choice of a laptop bag). The field test findings are consistent with the simulation results and offer strong support for the polyhedral question design method. The preferred estimation method varied based on the question design method, although Hierarchical Bayes estimation consistently per-formed well in this domain. The findings reveal a remarkable level of consistency across the validation tasks. They suggest that the proposed methods are sufficiently promising to justify further development. At the time of the test, the bags were prototypes. Based, in part, on {{the results of this study}} the bags were launched successfully and are now commercially available. Sales of the features of the laptop bags were consistent with conjoint-analysis predictions. ...|$|R

This study focuses on: i) How <b>laptop</b> <b>computers</b> are used in the mathematics classroom, concentrating on the types of software used and the type and the activities conducted. ii) Teachers' attitudes towards the use of <b>laptop</b> <b>computers</b> in the mathematics classroom, in particular how their attitudes and experiences may effect the use of <b>laptop</b> <b>computers.</b> iii) Teachers' perceptions of student benefits in terms of understanding and performing mathematical tasks using <b>laptop</b> <b>computers.</b> This study shows that there is a wide variety of software used and a large number of activities completed in mathematics classrooms with <b>laptop</b> <b>computers.</b> Teachers favoured using spreadsheets above any other type of software and tended to use the <b>laptop</b> <b>computers</b> for computational, open-ended activities rather than conceptual tasks. Teachers had varying attitudes about how and when <b>laptop</b> <b>computers</b> should be used in the mathematics classroom.

40|$|Thermal {{management}} {{materials used}} for heat sink in <b>laptop</b> <b>computers</b> is reviewed in this paper. In <b>laptop</b> <b>computers,</b> heat sink plays {{a vital role}} of dissipating heat from the system. Heat sink is a vital component in a <b>laptop</b> <b>computer</b> because it dissipates the heat generated by the system. The overall efficiency, cost, {{and size of the}} system could be influenced by the heat sink device. Four selection criteria; thermal conductivity, coefficient of thermal expansion, density, and cost were abducted for selecting a <b>laptop</b> <b>computer</b> heat sink material in this paper. An ideal heat sink material exhibits high thermal conductivity, low coefficient of thermal expansion, low density, and low cost. Aluminium and copper are mainly used for <b>laptop</b> <b>computer</b> heat sinks. Aluminium is used where weight reduction is needed while copper is used when weight is not considered as a major factor. However, the high demand for materials with low coefficient of thermal expansion and high thermal conductivity is due to the use of ceramic materials for substrates. Aluminium and copper fall short of the required coefficient of thermal expansion hence the need for advance composite materials. Based on the four selection criteria for a <b>laptop</b> <b>computer</b> heat sink material, Al/SiC has superior property potentials and is recommended as a near optimum material for this purpose...|$|R
