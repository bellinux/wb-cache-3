5000|$|In medicine, a <b>late</b> <b>effect</b> is a {{condition}} that appears after the acute phase of an earlier, causal condition has run its course. A <b>late</b> <b>effect</b> can be caused directly by the earlier condition, or indirectly by the treatment for the earlier condition. Some late effects can occur decades later. Historically, late effects have been very difficult to connect with their causes, but as survivorship and life span has increased and [...] "follow up" [...] has become standard practice, these connections are becoming established. A period, often very long, of health unaffected by both the initial and the <b>late</b> <b>effect</b> conditions distinguishes a <b>late</b> <b>effect</b> from a sequela or a complication.|$|E
5000|$|A sequela ( [...] , usually {{used in the}} plural, sequelae) is a {{pathological}} condition resulting from a disease, injury, therapy, or other trauma. Typically, a sequela is a chronic condition that is a complication which follows a more acute condition. It is different from, but is a consequence of, the first condition. Timewise, a sequela contrasts with a <b>late</b> <b>effect,</b> {{where there is a}} period, sometimes as long as several decades, between the resolution of the initial condition and the appearance of the <b>late</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background. Knowledge about past disease, treatment, and {{possible}} <b>late</b> <b>effects</b> {{has previously been}} shown to be low in survivors of childhood cancer and their relatives. This study investigated the information needs of childhood cancer survivors and their parents and explored possible determinants for differences in information need and health-related Internet use. Procedure. Childhood cancer survivors or their parents were contacted to complete a questionnaire about their characteristics, Internet use and requirements/expectations of a website on <b>late</b> <b>effects</b> (N= 160). Results. One-hundred forty-five questionnaires (90. 6 %) were returned. Of the 69 respondents (49. 3 %) who had visited a <b>late</b> <b>effects</b> outpatient clinic prior to the survey, 20 (29. 0 %) had questions left after the consult. The large majority of the population had home access to Internet and 71 respondents (49. 3 %) used Internet for medical questions. Only 15 respondents (10. 5 %) used Internet to look for information on <b>late</b> <b>effects</b> of childhood cancer and only 4 survivors found what they were looking for. Main information items requested were information about recognizing <b>late</b> <b>effects,</b> personalized information on <b>late</b> <b>effects</b> treatment and information on self-care. Only six respondents (4. 2 %) stated they would not visit a <b>late</b> <b>effects</b> website if it would be available. Conclusions. The need for <b>late</b> <b>effects</b> information showed to be of high priority by the majority of respondents, as was their interest in visiting a <b>late</b> <b>effects</b> website. In the development of a <b>late</b> <b>effects</b> website, attention should be given to patient information tailored to the personal situation of the website's users.

50|$|Axillary {{lymph nodes}} are {{included}} within the standard tangential fields in radiotherapy for breast cancer. In {{the case of}} comprehensive nodal irradiation, which includes axillary levels I, II, and III, {{as well as a}} supraclavicular lymph node field, there is a risk of damage to brachial plexus. The risk is estimated to be less than 5% as the brachial plexus radiation tolerance according to (Emami 1991) is 60 Gy in standard fractionation (2 Gy per fraction). A common prescribed dose for breast cancer with comprehensive nodal fields would be 50 Gy in 25 fractions with a boost planned to the lumpectomy cavity in the breast or scar on the chest wall if it is a mastectomy. If brachial plexopathy does occur, it is generally a <b>late</b> <b>effect</b> and may not manifest itself until 10 or 15 years later, and usually presents with slight painless muscular atrophy.|$|E

40|$|The {{number of}} cancer {{survivors}} is increasing. Knowledge gaps exist regarding {{the health of}} survivors and their use of services, particularly survivors with long-term effects {{of the disease and}} treatment, including <b>late</b> <b>effects.</b> This PhD study comprised (i) a systematic review of health service utilisation by cancer survivors; (ii) a population-based comparative survey of the health status and service utilisation of cancer survivors and a matched General Practice population; (iii) an overview of reviews of late effects; (iv) a comparative analysis of cancer survivors with self-reported <b>late</b> <b>effects</b> and survivors without <b>late</b> <b>effects</b> in terms of their health status and services utilisation patterns and; (v) a qualitative study of the narrative of cancer survivors with <b>late</b> • <b>effects.</b> The health service utilisation review identified that increasing age was associated with less care and increased hospitalisations. Improved care receipt was dependent on type and frequency of physician contact which facilitated health service use. Survivors were generally higher service users and received more care than the general population- this finding concurs with results of the survey. Survivors also had significantly poorer health than the general population. The presence of co-morbidities was associated with less service receipt, though the survey found that survivors with <b>late</b> <b>effects</b> were high users of care and experienced poorer health than their counterparts without <b>late</b> <b>effects.</b> There was general I SUMMARY 2 - PAGE 3 - agreement that physical <b>late</b> <b>effects</b> tend to emerge some time post-treatment, but there was [...] less agreement regarding the onset of psychological <b>late</b> <b>effects.</b> <b>Late</b> <b>effects</b> impacted on many aspects of survivors' lives and were managed in many ways.

40|$|Background: To assess {{health status}} and {{health-related}} {{quality of life}} (HRQoL) in childhood cancer survivors who {{were not involved in}} regular long-term follow-up. Patients and methods: One hundred and twenty-three long-term survivors, median age 33 (19 - 50) years, follow-up 27 (9 - 38) years, were recalled to the long-term follow-up clinic. Most of them were treated in the period 1970 - 1990. <b>Late</b> <b>effects</b> were graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3 (CTCAEv 3). HRQoL was assessed by RAND- 36. Socio-economic factors were compared with data from Statistics Netherlands (CBS).

50|$|Arcobacter {{species have}} been {{discovered}} as both animal and human pathogens within the past decade, due to improvements in isolation techniques. Up to now, {{little is known about}} the mechanisms of pathogenicity or potential virulence factors of Arcobacter spp. Since no routine diagnostic of these bacteria has been performed, the global prevalence of Arcobacter infection is rather underestimated and the exact routes of transmission are unknown. Some evidence indicates livestock animals may be a significant reservoir of Arcobacter, and over the last few years, the presence of these organisms in raw meat products, as well as in surface and ground water, has received increasing attention. In humans, A. butzleri, and less commonly, A. cryaerophilus, have been linked to enteritis and occasionally bacteremia. Symptoms of A. butzleri infections include diarrhea associated with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting or fever. Studies of patients infected with A. butzleri have demonstrated that without treatment, symptoms endured for a very variable amount of time, from two days to several weeks. When antimicrobial therapies were administered, the infection was eradicated within a few days, and all strains in the study were found to be susceptible to the antibiotics given. A third species, A. skirrowii, has also recently been isolated from a patient with chronic diarrhea. Although the microbiological and clinical features of Arcobacter are not yet well defined, initial studies of A. butzleri suggest that these bacteria display similar microbiological and clinical features as C. jejuni, but are more associated with a persistent, watery diarrhea than with the bloody diarrhea associated with C. jejuni. Recent studies suggest that A. butzleri induces epithelial barrier dysfunction by changes in tight junction proteins and induction of epithelial apoptosis. Based on this model, the virulence of A. butzleri seems to have two phases. An initial effect on tight junctions was observed first, followed by a <b>late</b> <b>effect</b> on cytotoxicity because of necrosis and induction of apoptosis.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Survivors after {{childhood}} and adolescent cancer are often {{at risk of}} developing one or multiple <b>late</b> <b>effects</b> after their cancer and curative cancer treatment. Of this reason {{it will be essential}} for these patients to be informed about both potential somatic and psychosocial <b>late</b> <b>effects.</b> In Norway, pediatricians normally do the follow-up of these patients 5 - 10 years after treatment completion or until around the age of 18. After that, the patient´s family doctors are normally given the role as administrators of the follow-up care of potential <b>late</b> <b>effects</b> among these patients. Purpose: In this thesis, the main focus has been {{to take a closer look}} at the amount of information given about potential <b>late</b> <b>effects</b> to survivors after {{childhood and}} adolescent cancer in Norway. I have wanted to answer the two questions: “Have adult survivors in Norway after childhood and adolescent cancer been informed about their risk of potential <b>late</b> <b>effects?</b> and “Do they want more information about potential <b>late</b> <b>effects</b> than they have been given?” I have also wanted to answer the question: “Which potential barriers exist among the Norwegian family doctors when it comes to giving information about and to ensure å proper prevention, diagnostic and treatment of potential late effects?”. Methods: Four relevant articles from Norway were analyzed. These four articles were found through a search in PubMed based on the keywords “childhood survivors”, “information” and “Norway”. In general this thesis is based on a large amount of searches in PubMed on different keywords related to the discussed topics. It is also based on the Norwegian National Guidelines for Children with Cancer and a report about the recommended follow-up care of Norwegian cancer survivors. Results: In two of the four analyzed articles, the authors found that a majority of the adult survivors after childhood cancer in the study groups had been inadequately informed about <b>late</b> <b>effects.</b> The third study, a video-based study among adolescent survivors after childhood cancer, found a significant variation among the observed pediatricians in information about <b>late</b> <b>effects.</b> In the fourth study, including focus groups of survivors after childhood and adolescent cancer, all the patients wanted to be informed about their own risk of <b>late</b> <b>effects</b> both as adolescent and as young adults. Conclusion: There is a range of interventions that could be done in Norway to improve the knowledge about <b>late</b> <b>effects</b> among the population of childhood and adolescent cancer survivors themselves and among their family doctors. An essential intervention would be to develop a “Survivorship passport” for all type of cancers that can affect young people, mentioning both potential <b>late</b> <b>effects</b> after the patient’s individual cancer treatment and the recommended follow-up care. More specific recommendations for the follow-up care should be included in the Norwegian National Guidelines for Children with Cancer, and the Norwegian family doctors should in general be better informed about where to seek for evidence based information about <b>late</b> <b>effects...</b>|$|R
