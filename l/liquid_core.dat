5|$|Ganymede is {{composed}} of approximately equal amounts of silicate rock and water ice. It is a fully differentiated body with an iron-rich, <b>liquid</b> <b>core,</b> and an internal ocean that may contain more water than all of Earth's oceans combined. Its surface {{is composed}} of two main types of terrain. Dark regions, saturated with impact craters and dated to four billion years ago, cover {{about a third of}} the satellite. Lighter regions, crosscut by extensive grooves and ridges and only slightly less ancient, cover the remainder. The cause of the light terrain's disrupted geology is not fully known, but was likely the result of tectonic activity due to tidal heating.|$|E

[...] By the 1920s, golf ball manufacturers had stopped using caustic liquids, but into the 1970s and 1980s golf balls were still at times exploding when dissected and were causing injuries due to the presence of crushed crystalline material present in the <b>liquid</b> <b>cores.</b>|$|R

25|$|But without {{detailed}} {{evidence and}} a force sufficient {{to drive the}} movement, the theory was not generally accepted: the Earth might have a solid crust and mantle and a <b>liquid</b> <b>core,</b> but {{there seemed to be}} no way that portions of the crust could move around.

25|$|Another huge {{advantage}} of the <b>liquid</b> <b>core</b> {{is its ability to}} release xenon gas which normally acts as a neutron absorber and causes structural occlusions in solid fuel elements (leading to early replacement of solid fuel rods with over 98% of the nuclear fuel unburned, including many long lived actinides).

2500|$|Munk was {{the first}} to show rigorously why one side of the Moon always faces the Earth (Munk and McDonald, 1960; and later papers up to 1975), a {{phenomenon}} known as tidal locking. Lord Kelvin had also considered this question, and had fashioned a non-quantitative answer being roughly correct. [...] The Moon does not have a molten <b>liquid</b> <b>core,</b> so cannot rotate through the egg-shaped distortion caused by the Earth's gravitational pull. Rotation through this shape requires internal shearing, and only fluids are capable of such rotation with small frictional losses. Thus, the pointy end of the [...] "egg" [...] is gravitationally locked to always point directly towards the Earth, with some small librations, or wobbles. Large objects may strike the Moon from time to time, causing it to rotate about some axis, but it will quickly stop rotating. All frictional effects from such events will also cause the Moon to regress further away from the Earth.|$|E
2500|$|There is no {{definitive}} theory {{as to what}} is causing the formation or colour of the storm that is known as the Great Red Spot. Laboratory studies are examining the effects that cosmic rays or UV Light from the Sun are having on the chemical composition of the clouds of Jupiter. In particular whether the Sun's radiation is reacting with ammonium hydrosulfide in the planet's outer atmosphere to create the deep red colour. Research has shown that the storm produces extreme amounts of heat because it is simultaneously generating gravity and acoustic waves. When these turbulent energy waves collide [...] above the red spot, they are creating extremely high temperatures in the planet's upper atmosphere. The effect is described as being like [...] "crashing [...] ocean waves on a beach". The reason the storm has continued to exist for centuries is because of the physical nature of Jupiter. As there is no planetary surface to provide friction (only a <b>liquid</b> <b>core</b> of hydrogen), circulating gas eddies persist {{for a very long time}} in the atmosphere because there is nothing to oppose their angular momentum.|$|E

The formation of structured particles with the targeted core/shell morphology, i. e. <b>liquid</b> <b>cores</b> and polymeric shells, is extremely dependent on the type of RAFT agent used in conjunction with the type of initiator used. Different RAFT agents lead to different polymerization rates, thus resulting in different chain lengths as a function of time.

The type of initiator used influences the surface activity of entering oligomers and is therefore also an important factor in obtaining the correct structure. Results showed that a RAFT agent that causes no rate retardation (phenyl 2 -propyl phenyl dithioacetate, PPPDTA), used in conjunction with a surface active initiating species (potassium persulfate, KPS), is able to lock the locus of polymerization at the droplet/water interface. This results in entering oligomers being anchored at the droplet/water interface with consequent core/shell (nanocapsule) formation only if the RAFT agent used leads to a sufficiently rapid increase in chain length with time and thus a restriction of chain mobility of the mediated species. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|AbstractThe {{method of}} {{preparation}} of microcapsules having <b>liquid</b> <b>cores</b> and hydrolyzed silica shells was demonstrated. Microcapsules were obtained by hydrolysis and condensation of silica sources contained in emulsion droplets. Tetraethyl orthosilicate {TEOS), (3 - Aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APS) and Dimethyloctadecyl[3 -(trimethoxysilyl) propyl]ammonium chloride (DTSACl) were used as silica sources. The interfacial properties of chloroform-TEOS(APS, DTSACl) /surfactant solution systems were investigated to determine the conditions favourable for emulsification. Emulsions were prepared using evaporation technique and stabilized, if it was necessary, by addition of TWEEN 80.
