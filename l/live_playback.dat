5|$|After {{five years}} since its {{original}} release, 30 Seconds to Mars was made available in Australia on April 7, 2007 on Virgin Records. EMI re-issued a limited edition of the album in Japan on December 2, 2009. To commemorate the 10th anniversary of the album, Thirty Seconds to Mars hosted an event called MarsX on August 27, 2012. It was broadcast worldwide through the online platform VyRT and included <b>live</b> <b>playback</b> and commentary of the record with the band, interactive discussion focused on the formation of Thirty Seconds to Mars, and exclusive acoustic performances. The album was also re-issued as a limited edition picture disc. To celebrate the 60th anniversary of the long-playing vinyl, Universal Music re-issued a double LP of 30 Seconds to Mars on September 23, 2016. A re-release on red translucent vinyl was pressed the following year in a limited edition for the 15th anniversary of the album.|$|E

50|$|Festivali i Këngës is an Albanian song contest, {{organised}} by the Albanian national broadcaster Radio Televizioni Shqiptar (RTSH). Various singing presentations {{have been}} used throughout its history, beginning with radio-only performances {{in the first few}} years, <b>live</b> interpretation, <b>playback,</b> remakes and even duets featuring other singers. The winners have traditionally been selected by a jury. However, other voting methods have also been applied, such as televoting or regional juries. At times, the head juror has carried twice the voting power of other jurors. Since 2003 it has been used to select Albania's entry for the international Eurovision Song Contest.|$|R

40|$|This thesis investigates {{a method}} of orchestral {{simulation}} using sample-based synthesis, instrument modelling, and music performance rules. Music scores are produced using Sibelius notation software and performed by FATSO (Film and Television Studio Orchestra). FATSO is a virtual orchestra developed by the author {{using a combination of}} computer music software applications and expressive instrument modelling techniques capable of producing convincing simulated orchestral performances of music scores. Music performance rules are modelled on live human performance practice using both Analysis-by-Synthesis and Analysis-by-Measurement techniques. The collected data is analysed, and then implemented into a music score using the Sibelius <b>live</b> <b>playback</b> transformation feature. After a music score is processed with human performance data, the instrument sounds and playing techniques are realised by the Vienna Instruments sample playback engine and GigaPulse convolution reverberation plug-in. The processed performance data of the score is transmitted to Vienna Instruments via MIDI using sound-sets created with the Sibelius sound-set editor. Consequently, a music score created using Sibelius can be performed by FATSO {{with a high level of}} realism through detailed instrument modelling and expressive music performance rules. This thesis contains two parts. Part 1 discusses the background to sample-based orchestral simulation and the main components of realistic and expressive orchestral modelling. Part 2 discusses methods used by the author for performance data acquisition, and the resulting performance data implementation into the FATSO environment...|$|E

3000|$|There are {{applications}} where partial decoding can crucially {{influence the}} end user's experience. Consider, for example, broadcasting a continuous stream of video or audio in <b>live</b> or <b>playback</b> modes. Even though fountain codes and RLNC are throughput optimal, {{having to wait}} for the entire coded block to arrive can result in unacceptable delays in the application layer. But, we also note that partial decoding of packets out of their natural temporal order does not necessarily translate into low delivery delays desired by the application layer. The authors in [5, 6] have proposed feedback-based throughput-optimal schemes to deal with the transmitter queue size, as well as decoding and delivery delays at the destinations. When the traffic load approaches system capacity, their methods are shown to behave [...] "gracefully" [...] and meet the delay performance benchmark of single-receiver automatic repeat request (ARQ) schemes.|$|R
40|$|There are {{two main}} {{characteristics}} that distinguish ordinary video applications from lossless digital image browsing: first, digital images used in medical imaging and scientific visualization applications usually can not tolerate any compromise of image quality; second, unlike <b>live</b> or <b>playback</b> video, browsing implies different playback rates. With these differences, {{it is no longer}} possible to increase the browsing speed by dropping alternate frames or by increasing compression ratios as done in video applications. From a network's point of view, the image browsing applications send data at different rates during different periods of time. These type of applications require guaranteed performance service in terms of bandwidth, end-to-end delay and jitter, however, their performance requirements change during the lifetime of the application. Most of the existing solutions that support guaranteed performance services require resource reservation on a per-connection basis and the amount [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Kontakt is a c. 14 -minute {{composition}} for string {{orchestra and}} audio signal processing {{that deals with}} imitation and ensemble communication. The first and third section of the piece consist {{of a collection of}} sound objects. The second section uses one of these objects to form a collection of palindromic motives, phrases and subsections. The pitch material consists of a slowly evolving cell containing three intervals at a time. The piece uses Max/MSP software to create delay networks, for <b>live</b> recording and <b>playback</b> of audio material, harmonization of live material, and quadraphonic sound diffusion. In Kontakt, ensemble communication is explored using canonic, spatial, textural, timbral, and electroacoustic effects. A three-part interplay consisting of 1) performing acoustic material, 2) digital processing and 3) interpretation of the processed material creates a deep connection between the acoustic and electroacoustic elements in the piece...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} <b>Live</b> Writing, asynchronous <b>playback</b> of a <b>live</b> coding performance or, more generally, writing. The {{concept of}} Live Writing is realized in a web-based application which logs every keystroke that a writer makes {{and let the}} writing later playable by the audience or the readers in real-time. The goal of Live Writing is twofold. One, it aims to support collaboration between musicians by reproducing a live coding performance based on keystroke data logged in the platform. This offers a new way for a live coder to archive live coding music and to communicate with others in asynchronous fashion. Two, it aims to transform written communication into a real-time experience so that a writer can display a writing to readers in a real-time manner {{as if it is}} being typed in front of the readers. We explain the design and the implementation of the system and demonstrate two different use cases of the system: live coding and writing...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, three {{different}} web-based LabVIEW control structures are designed, LabVIEW to LabVIEW control, LabVIEW to web browser control through CGI, and LabVIEW to web browser control through ActiveX + DataSocket. These {{three different}} web-based control structures are implemented and compared on an actual three-tank system. The {{objective is to}} enable the remote users to run the two pre-designed experiments through Internet in real time. The remote users should {{also be able to}} specify the control parameters for the experiments, watching the live video of the water height during the experiment, and getting data after the experiment to study control subjects. All three structures realize the web-based control concept under certain conditions. The live video broadcasting setup is the same for these three structures, and therefore they deliver the similar <b>live</b> video <b>playback</b> performance. Except the live video, these three structures differ very much. In terms of the data acquisition and control performance, the CGI method delivers the best performance with the shortest data acquisition period. In terms of the data communication, both LabVIEW to LabVIEW and ActiveX + DataSocket structures enable live data transfer. While LabVIEW to web browser through CGI structure can only enable the users to download the data file after experiment finishes. In terms of the implementation in real life, CGI has the widest user group. Everyone who has a web browser can have access to the web-based experiments through CGI. LabVIEW to LabVIEW control requires that the remote users have some knowledge about LabVIEW and have LabVIEW version 4. 1 or above installed in his/her computer. The application area of LabVIEW to web browser control through ActiveX + DataSocket is very limited because ActiveX is a double-edged technology on Internet. In short, LabVIEW to web browser control through CGI delivers the best performance overall among these three different web-based control structures...|$|R
