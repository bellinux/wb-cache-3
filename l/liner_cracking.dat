Due to the development of modern detection technology, comprehensive structural {{health assessment}} system is being established for operating tunnels. To evaluate the actual operational state of Shitigou tunnel, overall detection of the <b>liner</b> <b>crack,</b> tunnel seepage, and liner void was conducted by employing the modern detection technology, such as crack width monitoring technology, concrete strength monitoring technology, and electromagnetic wave nondestructive monitoring technology. Through the statistical analysis of the detection results, the distribution characteristic, development law, and damage grade of structural defects were obtained. Tunnel <b>liner</b> <b>cracks</b> are mainly located on the middle wall; serious water leakage is encountered on the side wall, middle wall, and vault; the strength of foundation and liner structure of left tunnel does not meet the design requirement; the liner voids are mostly located at the tunnel entrance section, especially, on the tunnel vault; and the proportion of influence factors of structural defects should be considered. The research results presented for this study can serve as references for effective design and health assessment of existing multiarch tunnel projects...|$|R

The basic bearing design consisted of a molded layer of chopped graphite-fiber-reinforced-polyimide (GFRP) composite bonded to the bore of a steel bushing. The friction, wear, and load carrying ability of the bushings were determined in oscillating tests at 25, 260 and 315 C at radial unit loads up to 260 MPa. Friction coefficients were typically 0. 15 to 0. 25. Bushings with liners containing a new partially fluorinated polymer were functional, but had a lower load capacity and higher wear rate than those containing a more conventional, high temperature polyimide. The liner retention design feature reduced the tendency of the <b>liners</b> to <b>crack</b> and work out of the contact zone under high oscillating loads...|$|R
40|$|Capping {{systems with}} mineral liners- {{compacted}} clay liners CCL {{as well as}} clay geosynthetic barriers GBR-C- are often applied as a standard cover for landfills with small or medium hazardous waste. During dry periods, the clay liners can show a suction-induced dewatering due to seasonal fluctuation of the restoration layer’s soil moisture. In addition, {{the roots of the}} vegetation can deepen and pene-trate into the mineral liner. If an ultimate suction is exceeded in the clay <b>liner,</b> irreversible <b>cracks</b> will occur and will reduce the sealing effect dramatically. The stress and deformation under which tensile cracks initially occur are imposed by the moister change of the adjacent layers and on the allowable suction of the mineral material related on its soil-physical properties and the stress conditions. Know-ing this limits of effect and resistance a mineral layer can be designed with an engineering approach.

40|$|Imperviousness of clay liners is {{essential}} in landfills in order to safeguard the environment from contamination. To accomplish this task, the behavior of clay liner of landfills with and without reinforcement inclusion has been explored by carrying out controlled in-flight simulation of nonuniform settlements of landfill in a geotechnical centrifuge using a trap-door arrangement. The reinforcement ability of geosynthetic materials such as geogrid is used to control the crack propagation and permeability of clay liner even at large settlement differences. Centrifuge model test results demonstrate a potential of reinforced clay liners to retain its integrity without significant cracking and crack propagation. Test results have shown that a geogrid layer that is placed within the top portion of the clay <b>liner</b> restrains <b>cracking</b> and enhances the sealing efficiency due to soil-geogrid frictional resistance. The adoption of geosynthetic reinforced clay liner (GRCL) provides an ideal solution for enhancing the deformation capacity. The GRCLs are a promising barrier material for situations in which nonuniform settlements are expected, for example, in landfill capping systems...|$|R

We were able {{to evaluate the}} damage mechanism through an analysis of acoustic emission parameters, such as the average rise time and average frequency of hits related to events, and the slope of amplitude distribution. According to the results, the average rise time of event signals was 30 - 90 � and the rise time of signals due {{to the growth of}} matrix crack was shorter than one from the initiation of matrix cracks.

40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{investigation on}} a scaled {{model of a}} landfill liner was conducted to provide data regarding the occurrence and extent of desiccation <b>cracking</b> of prototype <b>liners.</b> The <b>crack</b> intensity factor, CIF, was introduced as a descriptor {{of the extent of}} surficial cracking. CIF is defined as the ratio of the surface crack area A, to the total surface area of the clay liner, At. A computer aided image analysis program was used to determine CII’ values from scanned photographs of the desiccation process. The variation of the CII’ was related to duration of drying and measured soil moisture suctions. The soil of this investigation experienced significant cracking, with crack widths approaching 10 mm in the first drying cycle and penetration through the entire 16 cm thickness. Crack propagation was limited to a very intense period of the desiccation process. Nearly 90 percent of the crack development occurred during a 19 -hour time period, although the total duration of the desiccation cycle was approximately 170 hours. The soil moisture suction changed by only 2 bars during the period of rapid crack growth, although it changed by more than 40 bars during the period of reduced growth...|$|R

25|$|Many {{long-term}} {{problems with}} hip replacements {{are the result}} of osteolysis. This is the loss of bone caused by the body's reaction to polyethylene wear debris, fine bits of plastic that come off the cup liner over time. An inflammatory process causes bone resorption that may lead to subsequent loosening of the hip implants and even fractures in the bone around the implants. In an attempt to eliminate the generation of wear particles, ceramic bearing surfaces are being used in the hope that they will have less wear and less osteolysis with better long-term results. Metal cup liners joined with metal heads (metal-on-metal hip arthroplasty) were also developed for similar reasons. In the lab these show excellent wear characteristics and benefit from a different mode of lubrication. At the same time that these two bearing surfaces were being developed, highly cross linked polyethylene plastic liners were also developed. The greater cross linking significantly reduces the amount of plastic wear debris given off over time. The newer ceramic and metal prostheses do not always have the long-term track record of established metal on poly bearings. Ceramic pieces can break leading to catastrophic failure. This occurs in about 2% of the implants placed. They may also cause an audible, high pitched squeaking noise with activity. Metal-on-metal arthroplasty releases metal debris into the body raising concerns about the potential dangers of these accumulating over time. Highly cross linked polyethylene is not as strong as regular polyethylene. These plastic <b>liners</b> can <b>crack</b> or break free of the metal shell that holds them.|$|R
40|$|Damage {{monitoring}} of polymer-lined carbon fibre-reinforced plastic using small-diameter fibre Bragg grating sensors Shin-ichi Takeda 1, Tomohiro Yokozeki 2 and Toshio Ogasawara 1 Small-diameter fibre Bragg grating sensors were embedded in liquid crystalline polymer-lined carbon fibre-reinforced plastics to detect internal microscopic damages that are barely visible in operation. The coupon specimen caused matrix <b>cracks</b> and <b>liner</b> debonding under tensile loading, which represented distinctive damages in a composite overwrapped pressure vessel. The reflection spectra from the fibre Bragg grating sensors were {{measured in the}} loading–unloading tests. As the number of matrix cracks increased, {{the width of the}} spectrum gradually increased. The change in the measured results were validated by spectra simulated using the axial strain distribution in the fibre Bragg grating sensor. Moreover, the influence of damage morphology on the reflection spectrum was investigated {{on the basis of the}} analytical results for both embedded and surface-bonded fibre Bragg grating sensors. The embedded fibre Bragg grating sensor was less sensitive than the surface-bonded fibre Bragg grating sensor for distinguishing among the damage modes, such as matrix <b>cracks,</b> <b>liner</b> debonding and liner failure.

40|$|In modern {{solid waste}} landfills, liner systems are {{essential}} structural elements that ensure that waste materials are safely {{separated from the}} environment. Many liner systems have been developed and used over the past decade. Among impermeable layers, clay liners are {{regarded as one of}} the very significant components of liner system and are being used worldwide as a waste containment system in landfills. One of the failures associated with clay liners is the occurrence of nonuniform settlements, resulting from the sudden collapse of waste, or the decomposition of waste materials, and (or) the subgrade over which the liner is laid. This paper deals with the use of a small centrifuge to model the deformation behaviour of clay liners. Model tests were performed in a small geotechnical centrifuge to investigate the behaviour of clay liners in landfills subjected to nonuniform settlements at sharp curvatures. A parametric study was conducted to analyze the influence of parameters like thickness, consistency, and overburden on the behaviour of clay liners. The clay liner without any overburden is observed to experience severe cracking in the form of deep and wide cracks at the maximum curvature zone. The depth and width of the cracks are found to decrease with an increase in clay <b>liner</b> thickness. The <b>cracking</b> failure pattern is suppressed by shearing for a clay liner with an increase in overburden pressure. Based on model test results, the clay liner with an adequate overburden is found to be free from cracking failure even when subjected to sharp curvatures. The effective usage of a small geotechnical centrifuge to model the deformation behaviour of clay liners is demonstrated adequately...|$|R
40|$|In {{the early}} {{development}} of jet engines, it was occasionally found that excessive amounts of coke or other carbonaceous deposits were {{formed in the}} combustion chamber. Sometimes {{a considerable amount of}} smoke was noted in the-exhaust gases. Excessive coke deposits may adversely affect jet-engine performance in several ways. The formation of excessive amounts of coke on or just downstream of a fuel nozzle (figs. 116 (a) and (b)) changes the fuel-spray pattern and possibly affects combustor life and performance. Similar effects on performance can result from the deposition of coke on primary-air entry ports (fig. 116 (c)). Sea-level or altitude starting may be impaired by the deposition of coke on spark-plug electrodes (fig. 116 (b)), deposits either grounding the electrodes completely or causing the spark to occur at positions other than the intended gap. For some time it was thought that large deposits of coke in turbojet combustion chambers (fig. 116 (a)) might break away and damage turbine blades; however, experience has indicated that for metal blades this problem is insignificant. (Cermet turbine blades may be damaged by loose coke deposits.) Finally, the deposition of coke may cause high-temperature areas, which promote <b>liner</b> warping and <b>cracking</b> (fig. 116 (d)) from excessive temperature gradients and variations in thermal-expansion rates. Smoke in the exhaust gases does not generally impair engine performance but may be undesirable from a tactical or a nuisance standpoint. Appendix B of reference 1 and references 2 to 4 present data obtained from full-scale engines operated on test stands and from flight tests that indicate some effects on performance caused by coke deposits and smoke. Some information about the mechanism of coke formation is given in reference 5 and chapter IX. The data indicate that (1) high-boiling fuel residuals and partly polymerized products may be mixed with a large amount of smoke formed in the gas phase to account for the consistency, structure, and chemical composition of the soft coke in the dome and (2) the hard deposits on the liner are similar to petroleum coke and may result from the liquid-phase thermal cracking of the fuel. During the early development period of jet engines, it was noted that the excessive coke deposits and exhaust smoke were generally obtained when fuel-oil-type fuels were used. Engines using gasoline-type fuels were relatively free from the deposits and smoke. These results indicated that some type of quality control would be needed in fuel specifications. Also noted was the effect of engine operating conditions on coke deposition. It is possible that, even with a clean-burning fuel, an excessive amount of coke could be formed at some operating conditions. In this case, combustor redesign could possibly reduce the coke to a tolerable level. This chapter is a summary of the various coke-deposition and exhaust-smoke problems connected- with the turbojet combustor. Included are (1) the effect of coke deposition on combustor life or durability and performance; (2) the effect of combustor design, operating conditions, inlet variables, and fuel characteristics on coke deposition; (3) elimination of coke deposits; (4) the effect of operating conditions and fuel characteristics on formation of exhaust smoke; and (5) various bench test methods proposed for determining and controlling fuel quality...|$|R
