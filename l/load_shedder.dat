A <b>load</b> <b>shedder</b> drops tuples to keep the input load below a critical threshold and thus avoid unbounded queuing and system trashing. In this paper we propose Load-Aware Shedding (LAS), a novel load shedding solution that, unlike previous works, does not rely neither on a pre-defined cost model nor on any assumption on the tuple execution duration. Leveraging sketches, LAS efficiently builds and maintains at runtime a cost model to estimate the execution duration of each tuple with small error bounds. This estimation enables a proactive load shedding of the input stream at any operator that aims at limiting queuing latencies while dropping as few tuples as possible. We provide a theoretical analysis proving that LAS is an (ε, δ) -approximation of the optimal online <b>load</b> <b>shedder.</b> Furthermore, through an extensive practical evaluation based on simulations and a prototype, we evaluate its impact on stream processing applications, which validate the robustness and accuracy of LAS...|$|E

A 2011 study of ninety-nine managers of upscale and luxury hotels found that the operators were reticent to implement energy management programs that were excessively costly or might impair guest comfort. Thus, in-room sensors were suspect, and a substantial group of respondents were hesitant to install an electrical demand controller (or <b>load</b> <b>shedder)</b> for fear of interfering with guest satisfaction. These hotels also tended to use a short-term analysis that addressed raw cost and payback periods when considering an investment in energy saving equipment.

40|$|Data mining is {{a process}} of finding {{interesting}} knowledge from a world of (raw) data stored in databases. Recently, knowledge discovery communities have focused on a new model of data processing, where dataarrive in the form of continuous streams. It {{is often referred to as}} data streams or streaming data. A datastream is a massive and usually unbounded sequence of data elements which are continuously transmitted ata rapid rate and in a random order. Data streams have wide applications in real world in recent years, such astransactional records of a chain-store head office from every retail sales, web-flow or click-stream records ofa website monitoring server, etc. There is possibly some hidden information in these streaming data whichare valuable but not easy to find out. The natural feature of variable transit-rate of data streams has broughtout many constraints; moreover, streams have an uncertain factor that their peak volume may burst to severaltimes during a spike. As a result, data mining in data streams is much more difficult than that in the(traditional) databases. For processing data streams, there is a special technique called “load shedding” toaddress the overloading problem resulting from streams' variable high-speed. However, there are only fewresearches on load shedding for mining in data streams so far. In this proposal, we propose a load-shedding mechanism for mining frequent patterns in data streams. Different from other existing mechanisms, the proposed mechanism raises the throughput of a miningalgorithm by increasing its processing rate on each stream element. The proposal is the first one to study theload-shedding problems in data-stream mining of frequent patterns. We shall design a novel and general loadshedder based on the theory of combinatorial approximation. The <b>load</b> <b>shedder</b> suits for a mining methodbelonging to the types of ε-deficient mining or sliding-window exact mining. As the <b>load</b> <b>shedder</b> is working,the mining method needs to record fewer itemsets for each transaction than it does before, and the overload isthen solved with the increasing rate of data processing. For those itemsets that have not been kept or beenignored, their support-values can be approximated through combinatorial approximation when required. Theresearch in this proposal shows some important issues about applying combinatorial approximation as ameans of load shedding. Besides, the result of this research can be applied to many existing miningalgorithms, improving the scalability and practicality of data-stream mining systems. For those applicationshaving a high-degree demand for data-stream mining results, our load-shedding mechanism will bring themessential helpfulness. 「資料探勘」是一門從儲存於資料庫的龐大資料中挖掘出有趣知識的技術。近年來在許多實際應用中，資料不再是靜態儲存於資料庫中的型態，而是以串流的方式陸陸續續抵達本地端的系統，稱為「資料串流」的處理模型。資料串流是一個由(近乎) 無限多的資料元件所形成之長串序列，以不定順序、非常快的速度產生，並且持續不斷地傳輸。資料串流在現實生活中的應用非常廣泛，因為在串流資料當中可能潛藏著具有價值的資訊，然而要發現它們並不容易。由於資料串流具有傳輸速率隨時間變動、尖峰時刻資料量暴增等不安定因素，使得資料串流探勘比起(傳統) 資料庫探勘要來得困難許多。欲解決這個現實問題，需要使用「負載控制」這項專門技術，然而目前鮮有對於資料串流探勘的負載控制研究成果。針對傳輸速率不固定的資料串流環境，本計畫提出一套適用於探勘頻繁項目集的負載控制機制。這套機制的想法有別於既有做法，藉由加快探勘方法處理串流資料元件的速率，提升單位時間吞吐量，達到減低負載量的效果。本計畫首先針對資料串流探勘領域的負載控制技術進行研究，設計創新且通用性高的負載控制方法；這套方法以「組合估算」理論為基礎，可以與ε-deficient mining 或sliding-window exact mining 類型的不特定探勘演算法結合，為其提供負載控制功能。當負載控制機制啟動時，探勘方法對於每一筆串流交易將只需要記錄較原本少量的項目集，以提升的資料處理速率來降低過載的資料量；而未記錄或被略過的項目集可以在有需要時透過組合估算方法迅速求得。在學術上，本計畫針對組合估算技術應用於負載控制，提出並探討相關研究議題，展示新研究方向。在產業上，對於對資料串流探勘有高度需求的應用，本計畫的研究成果可適用於多數既有探勘演算法，提升資料串流探勘系統的延展性與實用性，為這些應用帶來實質幫助...|$|E
40|$|The {{increased}} levels of distributed generator (DG) penetration and the customer demand for high levels of reliability have attributed {{to the formation of}} the Microgrid concept. The Microgrid concept contains a variety of technical challenges, including load management and anti-islanding protection discrimination strategies. This paper provides a novel scheme in which loads and DG are able to detect the conditions where the load of the island cannot be sufficiently supplied. In these instances, a load shedding algorithm systematically removes loads from the system until an island can be maintained within satisfactory operating limits utilising the local DG. The concept of an Intelligent <b>Load</b> <b>Shedder</b> (ILS) module is proposed in this paper. This module is connected in series with non-critical loads in order to detect the conditions where that non-essential load should be isolated from an island. This module must be capable of communicating with the static transfer switch (STS), which is the intelligent isolator associated with the island. The STS will also be capable of sending and receiving data with each DG’s islanding protection device. The combined algorithmic control of the STS, ILS module and DG islanding protection device forms the Intelligent Load Management algorithm. This algorithm is capable of islanding protection and load shedding irrespective of the use of communications. The algorithms within this paper are simulated using MATLAB script. The results show that, on a theoretical level, the intelligent load management scheme described in this paper can be used to detect the conditions where an insufficient load is available using local parameters. Load shedding coordination is also shown to be possible with and without the use of communications between the STS, ILS module and DG islanding protection module...|$|E
40|$|Data Stream Management Systems (DSMSs) {{offer the}} most {{effective}} solution for processing data streams by efficiently executing continuous queries (CQs) over the incoming data. CQs inherently have different levels of criticality and hence different levels of expected quality of service (QoS) and quality of data (QoD). Adhering to such expected QoS/QoD metrics {{is even more important}} in cases of multi-tenant data stream management services. In this dissertation, we propose DILoS, a framework that supports differentiated QoS and QoD for multiple classes of CQs by tightly integrating priority-based scheduling and load shedding. Unlike existing works that consider scheduling and load shedding separately, DILoS is a novel unified framework that exploits the synergy between them. For the realization of DILoS, we propose ALoMa and SEaMLeSS, two general, adaptive load managers. Our load managers can also be used standalone and outperform the state-of-the-art in three dimensions: (1) they automatically tune the headroom factor, (2) they honor the delay target, and (3) they are applicable to complex query networks with shared operators. We implemented DILoS, ALoMa and SEaMLeSS in our real DSMS prototype system (AQSIOS) and systematically evaluate their performance using real and synthetic workloads. Our experimental evaluation of ALoMa and SEaMLeSS verified their advantages over the state-of-the-art approaches. Our evaluation of DILoS showed that it (a) allows the scheduler and <b>load</b> <b>shedder</b> to consistently honor CQs’ priorities, (b) significantly increases system capacity utilization by exploiting batch processing, and (c) enables operator sharing among query classes of different priorities while avoiding priority inversion. To further support differentiated QoS and QoD for CQs in distributed DSMSs, we propose ARMaDILoS, a conceptual framework for large scale adaptive resource management using DILoS. A fundamental component in ARMaDILoS is CQ migration. For this reason, we propose and implement UniMiCo, a protocol to migrate CQs without interrupting the execution of the queries. Our experiments showed that UniMiCo produced correct outputs and did not introduce any hiccup in the response time of the queries...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{a hybrid}} method is {{proposed}} {{for reducing the}} amount of <b>load</b> <b>shedding</b> and voltage collapse. The hybrid method is the combination of Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Neural Network (NN). The GA is used by two stages, one is to frame the optimization model and other stage is to generate data set for developing the NN based intelligent <b>load</b> <b>shedding</b> model. The appropriate buses for <b>load</b> <b>shedding</b> are selected based on the sensitivity of minimum eigenvalue of load flow Jacobian with respect to the <b>load</b> <b>shed.</b> The proposed method is implemented in MATLAB working platform and the performance is tested with 6 bus and IEEE 14 bus bench mark system. The result of the proposed hybrid method is compared with the GA based optimization algorithm. The comparison shows that, the proposed method ensures voltage stability with minimum <b>loading</b> <b>shedding...</b>|$|R

The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to study the {{implementation}} of <b>load</b> <b>shedding</b> under the condition of IEC 61850 (Communication Networks and Systems in Substations) communication exchange in the power system. The strategy of <b>load</b> <b>shedding</b> with IEC 61850 GOOSE (Generic Object Oriented Substation Event) message relies on fast transmission of the signal to shed unstable regions for maintaining system safety. The current strategy for <b>load</b> <b>shedding</b> in the substation is to use hardwire and dispatch solutions to implement related applications of <b>load</b> <b>shedding.</b> For integrating protective relays in substations, IEC 61850 GOOSE schemes can customize both a ring and a star construct based on TCP/IP Ethernet to have flexible dispatch of smart grid solutions. The functions of relay integrated with the GOOSE message play important roles to implement peer to peer communication to accomplish the <b>load</b> <b>shedding</b> strategy...|$|R

Aiming at the optimal <b>load</b> <b>shedding</b> problem considering the load characteristics,firstly,the traditional under-voltage <b>load</b> <b>shedding</b> scheme based on a static load model may cause the analysis inaccurate is pointed out on the equivalent Thevenin circuit. Then,the dynamic voltage stability margin indicator is derived through local measurement. The derived indicator can reflect the voltage change of the key area in a myopia linear way. Dimensions of the optimal problem will be greatly simplified using this indicator. In the end,mathematical model of the centralized <b>load</b> <b>shedding</b> scheme is built with the indicator considering load characteristics. HSPPSO is introduced to slove the optimal problem. Simulation results on IEEE- 39 system show that the proposed scheme display a good adaptability in solving the under-voltage <b>load</b> <b>shedding</b> considering dynamic <b>load</b> characteristics...|$|R
