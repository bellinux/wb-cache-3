The two head for the shelter and rescue her; Natushiko then requests Watase to help him rescue Mashiro and Salyu. While Watase goes on the rescues, Natsuhiko gathers information about LABO from Yuuri who declares her death was a lie created by LABO; she also talks about LABO's secrets and has Natsuhiko go through her memories to learn about them and her past. With her information, Natsuhiko learns there were two test subjects in LABO: Yuuri and another girl who he believes was the one murdered. As Watase reports back {{of not being able to}} locate Salyu, he confronts Natsuhiko about his memory conflicts; though initially hesitant, Natsuhiko reveals to him the truth and, after Watase's request, agrees to restore back his old memories. Within his memories, Natsuhiko learns that Watase and Ukita joined Q and their mission was to capture the two test subjects confined in LABO to take back as proof of LABO's crimes; additionally, Natsuhiko learns the girl who was murdered is [...] "Subject N" [...] and finds out anyone who comes in contact with her BC power has their memories distorted with added malice, thus making the person go mad; finally, he learns there is a bomb placed that will go off when the <b>lockdown</b> <b>lifts.</b> Natushiko repairs and removes the malice from Watase's memories and Watase returns to normal. When asked to assist Yuuri and help her escape, he refuses due to him still feeling obligated to complete Q's mission; Yuuri contracts a deal with him and that she will go with him if he agrees to make sure everyone else escapes; Watase accepts. Through their partnership, Natsuhiko enters each person's memories and purifies them if necessary, turning everyone who was infected back to normal. In the control room, after hacking with the computers, they find that they can use the computers to temporarily open the bulkheads in the facility; however, at least three must stay behind in order to operate them thus only six can be saved. Believing there is still a method that can save them all, a series of visions suddenly flashes into everyone's minds; connected together, the visions reveal an escape route using the intake water pipe in the engine room which connects to the outside lake. Watase, Natsuhiko, and Yuuri stay behind, assist the other six to escape, gather the necessary equipment and use the pipe to get out of the facility. After they reach the shore, Watase pulls his gun out and points it at Natsuhiko and Yuuri, reminding him about their deal. To save Watase and Yuuri, Natsuhiko uses his BC powers to weave everyone's memories into one chain and shows Watase the truth where every destructive activity caused in the past was a result of Q's actions. Watase lowers his gun and realizes what he must do.|$|R
