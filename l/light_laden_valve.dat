50|$|On New Year's Eve, she {{captured}} Island Belle about 12 mi {{southeast of}} Bull's Island <b>light.</b> <b>Laden</b> with sugar and molasses, that 166 LT schooner of Nassau, New Providence, had departed Trinidad de Cuba ostensibly bound for Baltimore, Maryland under English colors. However, the vessel — {{which had been}} built at Charleston earlier that year under the name, General Ripley — was heading straight for Bull's Bay. Since her British registration — dated 11 November 1861 — {{seemed to be a}} subterfuge and her clearance was obviously spurious, Parrott sent the prize to New York.|$|R
40|$|During archaeological {{excavation}} of the Roman port of Pisa in 1999, two skeletons came to <b>light,</b> <b>laden</b> {{down by a}} Roman ship, sunk and partly preserved, probably caused by a disastrous flood in the River Auser. Skeletons belonging to an adult male and a small dog, resembling the present Dachshund breed, were recovered. The canine rested on he man's left upper limb at the forearm level. This 2000 year-old cold case has been investigated using physical and forensic anthropological techniques which allowed us to define the biological profile of this subject: including the sex, age, height and skeletal pathology. The taphonomic analysis of bones and the context as a possible crime scene let us understand the decomposition and death dynamics revealing {{the causes of the}} partial dismemberment. The case presented is an example the physical anthropology as a discipline useful for the analysis of skeleton human remains, and as a useful tool in the reconstruction of ancient events and bio-archaeological data in synergy with forensic sciences...|$|R
5000|$|In {{this series}} of battles, the Northern {{soldiers}} beat {{their way across the}} peninsula from the York River to the James where Rodgers' floating firepower could prevent Lee from closing his pincers. After he learned of the disposition of the Federal ships, Lee reported: “As far as I can see {{there is no way to}} attack him (McClellan) to advantage; nor do I wish to expose the men to the destructive missiles of his gunboats ... I fear he is too secure under cover of his boats to be driven from his position [...] [...] [...]” During McClellan's retreat to Harrison's Landing, the Union Army's gunboat-protected haven on the James, Satellite and [...] ascended the Chickahominy River to strengthen his right flank. In the ensuing weeks, Satellite protected Union troops ashore and transports afloat, often engaging Confederate forces on the riverbanks. On 27 July, boats from Satellite and [...] ascended Chippoak Creek and captured schooner, J. W. Sturges, and a schooner-rigged <b>lighter</b> <b>laden</b> with wood. They also found two other schooners and a steamer which had been scuttled before they arrived.|$|R
50|$|The Te Rata Bridge was a {{suspension}} {{bridge across the}} Retaruke River in the King Country, New Zealand. On 22 March 1994 two transoms (the supporting beams suspended from wire ropes running {{from side to side}} beneath the bridge) snapped causing the bridge to collapse while beekeeper Kenneth Richards was crossing in a <b>laden</b> <b>light</b> truck. Richards was killed when the truck fell 30 metres into the river.|$|R
60|$|In the meantime, however, a large {{boat from}} the {{floating}} <b>light,</b> pretty deeply <b>laden</b> with lime, cement, and sand, approached, when the strangers, {{with a view}} to avoid giving trouble, took their passage in her to the rock. The accession of three passengers to a boat, already in a lumbered state, put her completely out of trim, and, as it unluckily happened, the man who steered her on this occasion was not in the habit of attending the rock, and was not sufficiently aware of the run of the sea at the entrance of the eastern creek.|$|R
6000|$|Don Martin's soft hands {{suffered}} cruelly, {{tugging at}} the thick handle of the enormous oar. He stuck to it manfully, setting his teeth. He, too, was in the toils of an imaginative existence, and that strange work of pulling a lighter seemed to belong naturally to the inception of a new state, acquired an ideal meaning from his love for Antonia. For all their efforts, the heavily <b>laden</b> <b>lighter</b> hardly moved. Nostromo could be heard swearing to himself between the regular splashes of the sweeps. [...] "We are making a crooked path," [...] he muttered to himself. [...] "I wish I could see the islands." ...|$|R
40|$|This film {{depicts the}} East River {{shoreline}} and the piers of lower Manhattan starting at about Pier 5 (the New York Central Pier) opposite Broad Street, and extending to the Mallory Line steamship piers {{just south of}} Fulton Street and the Brooklyn Bridge. The film begins with shots of canal boats or barges (from the Erie Canal via the Hudson River) docked at and around Coenties Slip [Frame: 0106]. As the film progresses, the New York Produce Exchange located at Bowling Green, Manhattan, with its distinct tower, comes into view in the background [0346]. Between here and the Wall Street ferry, there follows in order of appearance: steam tugs [0308 and 0422], a wooden hull barkentine [1032] with box barges alongside, a docked iron hull sailing ship, probably British [1448], an ocean steamer with yards on the foremast [1748], a derrick <b>lighter</b> <b>laden</b> with barrels docked {{at the end of}} a pier [2134], and a fruit steamer [2612]. In the Wall Street Ferry slip (between Piers 15 and 16) there is a Wall St., Manhattan-to-Montague St., Brooklyn, double-ended steam commuter boat [2896]. The ferry is visible immediately before a shot of the large advertising billboards on Pier 16. The film next shows the Ward Line piers (J. E. Ward & Co., New York and Cuba Steamship Co.) [3040], a Pennsylvania Railroad tug [3190], a derrick lighter [3320], and the Mallory Line piers [3692]. A Mallory Line steamer can be seen on the south side of one of the Mallory Piers [3736]. The camera begins panning out into the East River after passing pier 20, catching the fog bell at the end of pier 21 [3922]. A car float is visible passing under the Brooklyn Bridge [4202]. The pan follows the line of the Brooklyn Bridge eastward to Brooklyn Heights, where the Hotel Margaret (tall building in background) is visible just before the end of the film [4464]. This film continues the view begun in the film Sky Scrapers of New York City From the North River. Together they comprise a sweep around the southern tip of Manhattan, from Fulton Street on the Hudson to the Brooklyn Bridge. Copyright: Thomas A. Edison; 20 May 1903; H 32037.

60|$|As the {{valuable}} furs soon became scarce {{in the neighborhood}} of the settlements, the Indians of the vicinity were stimulated to take a wider range in their hunting expeditions; they were generally accompanied on these expeditions by some of the traders or their dependents, who shared in the toils and perils of the chase, {{and at the same time}} made themselves acquainted with the best hunting and trapping grounds, and with the remote tribes, whom they encouraged to bring their peltries to the settlements. In this way the trade augmented, and was drawn from remote quarters to Montreal. Every now and then a large body of Ottawas, Hurons, and other tribes who hunted the countries bordering on the great lakes, would come down in a squadron of <b>light</b> canoes, <b>laden</b> with beaver skins, and other spoils of their year's hunting. The canoes would be unladen, taken on shore, and their contents disposed in order. A camp of birch bark would be pitched outside of the town, and a kind of primitive fair opened with that grave ceremonial so dear to the Indians. An audience would be demanded of the governor-general, who would hold the conference with becoming state, seated in an elbow-chair, with the Indians ranged in semicircles before him, seated on the ground, and silently smoking their pipes. Speeches would be made, presents exchanged, and the audience would break up in universal good humor.|$|R
6000|$|Were {{it because}} of its mere {{material}} hardships that to this day I think of that period {{of my life with}} a shudder, I should not here confess to it. I was alone. I knew not a living soul to whom I dared to speak, who cared to speak to me. For those first twelve months after my mother's death I lived alone, thought alone, felt alone. In the morning, during the busy day, it was possible to bear; but in the evenings the sense of desolation gripped me like a physical pain. The summer evenings came again, bringing with them the long, lingering <b>light</b> so <b>laden</b> with melancholy. I would walk into the Parks and, sitting there, watch with hungry eyes the men and women, boys and girls, moving all around me, talking, laughing, interested in one another; feeling myself some speechless ghost, seeing but not seen, crying to the living with a voice they heard not. Sometimes a solitary figure would pass by and glance back at me; some lonely creature like myself longing for human sympathy. In the teeming city must have been thousands such--young men and women to whom a friendly ear, a kindly voice, would have been as the water of life. Each imprisoned in his solitary cell of shyness, we looked at one another through the grating with condoling eyes; further than that was forbidden to us. Once, in Kensington Gardens, a woman turned, then slowly retracing her steps, sat down beside me on the bench. Neither of us spoke; had I done so she would have risen and moved away; yet there was understanding between us. To each of us it was some comfort to sit thus for a little while beside the other. Had she poured out her heart to me, she could have told me nothing more than I knew: [...] "I, too, am lonely, friendless; I, too, long for the sound of a voice, the touch of a hand. It is hard for you, it is harder still for me, a girl; shut out from the bright world that laughs around me; denied the right of youth to joy and pleasure; denied the right of womanhood to love and tenderness." ...|$|R
6000|$|And Neuha {{took her}} Torquil by the hand, [...] And waved along the vault her kindled brand, [...] And {{led him into}} each recess, and showed [...] The secret places of their new abode. [...] Nor these alone, for all had been {{prepared}} [...] Before, to soothe the lover's lot she shared: [...] The mat for rest; for dress the fresh gnatoo, [...] And sandal oil to fence against the dew; [...] For food the cocoa-nut, the yam, the bread [...] Born of the fruit; for board the plantain spread [...] 170 [...] With its broad leaf, or turtle-shell which bore [...] A banquet in the flesh it covered o'er; [...] The gourd with water recent from the rill, [...] The ripe banana from the mellow hill; [...] A pine-torch pile to keep undying light, [...] And she herself, as beautiful as night, [...] To fling her shadowy spirit o'er the scene, [...] And make their subterranean world serene. [...] She had foreseen, since first the stranger's sail [...] Drew to their isle, that force or flight might fail, [...] 180 [...] And formed a refuge of the rocky den [...] For Torquil's safety from his countrymen.[fs] [...] Each dawn had wafted there her <b>light</b> canoe, [...] <b>Laden</b> with all the golden fruits that grew; [...] Each eve had seen her gliding through the hour [...] With all could cheer or deck their sparry bower; [...] And now she spread her little store with smiles, [...] The happiest daughter of the loving isles.|$|R
