5|$|Afterwards Bond visits Valentin Zukovsky at {{a casino}} to acquire {{information}} about Elektra's attackers; he discovers that Elektra's head of security, Davidov, is secretly {{in league with}} Renard. Bond kills Davidov and boards a plane bound for a Russian ICBM base in Kazakhstan. He poses as a Russian nuclear scientist, meets American nuclear physicist Christmas Jones, and enters the silo. Inside, Renard is removing the GPS <b>locator</b> <b>card</b> and weapons-grade plutonium from a nuclear bomb. Before Bond can kill him, Jones blows his cover. Renard drops a hint that he and Elektra are collaborating and flees with the plutonium, while Bond and Jones escape the exploding silo with the <b>locator</b> <b>card.</b>|$|E
5|$|Back in Azerbaijan, Bond {{discloses}} to M that Elektra {{may not be}} {{as innocent}} as she seems. An alarm sounds while he is handing M the <b>locator</b> <b>card</b> as proof of the theft, which reveals that the stolen bomb from Kazakhstan is attached to an inspection rig heading towards the oil terminal. Bond and Jones enter the pipeline to deactivate the bomb, and Jones discovers that half of the plutonium is missing. They both jump clear of the rig, a large section of pipeline is destroyed, and they are presumed killed. Back at the command centre, Elektra reveals she and Renard are conspirators and that she killed her father as revenge for using her as bait for Renard. She abducts M, whom she resents for advising her father not to pay the ransom money, and imprisons her in the Maiden's Tower.|$|E
5|$|Bond visits Valentin Zukovsky and is {{informed}} that Elektra's head of security, Davidov, is {{in league with}} Renard: Bond kills Davidov and follows the trail to a Russian ICBM base in Kazakhstan. Posing as a Russian nuclear scientist, Bond meets American nuclear physicist Christmas Jones. The two witness Renard stealing the GPS <b>locator</b> <b>card</b> and a half quantity of weapons-grade plutonium from a bomb and set off an explosion, from which Bond and Jones escape. Elektra kidnaps M after she thinks Bond had been killed and Bond establishes that Elektra intends to create a nuclear explosion in a submarine in Istanbul to increase the value of her own oil pipeline. Bond frees M, kills Elektra and then disarms the bomb on the submarine where he kills Renard.|$|E
500|$|On July 7, 2014, Gunn {{announced}} {{on social media}} that he had completed work on the film. In August, regarding the post-credit scene, Gunn revealed that the scene did not involve Howard the Duck when it was originally filmed, rather he was added during post-production, a decision made by [...] "some combination of [...] and the editor Fred Raskin". As the decision to add the character was made late in the post-production process, {{he had to be}} designed that day, before being handed off to Sony Pictures Imageworks to animate. Also in August, regarding the pre-credit scene of Groot dancing, Gunn stated that he himself danced to provide motion reference for the animators, and that {{the decision was made to}} place the scene before the credits, rather than during or after them, because of positive responses from a test audience, which made Marvel and Gunn feel that they did not want [...] "people walking out and missing this thing". Marvel used design firm Sarofsky once again for the film's title sequences, after liking their work for [...] Sarofsky developed a custom typeface based on the font used in the teaser posters for the opening credits, which was tinted orange to offer a better contrast to the film's blue and grey imagery. One of the typography solutions offered before the final product wound up being repurposed as the <b>locator</b> <b>cards</b> seen throughout the film.|$|R
5|$|Bond accosts Zukovsky at his caviar {{factory in}} the Caspian Sea, which is then {{attacked}} by Elektra's sawing helicopters. Later, Zukovsky reveals his arrangement with Elektra was {{in exchange for the}} use of a submarine, currently being captained by Zukovsky's nephew, Nikolai. The group goes to Istanbul, where Jones realises that if Renard were to insert the stolen plutonium into the submarine's nuclear reactor, the resulting nuclear explosion would destroy Istanbul, sabotaging the Russians' oil pipeline in the Bosphorus. Bond then receives a signal from the <b>locator</b> <b>card</b> M has activated using a clock battery, just before Zukovsky's underling, Bullion blows up the command centre. Bond and Jones are captured by Elektra's henchmen. Jones is taken aboard the submarine. Bond is taken to the tower, where Elektra tortures him with a garrote. Zukovsky and his men seize the tower, but Zukovsky is shot by Elektra, freeing Bond with his cane gun with his last act. Bond frees M and kills Elektra.|$|E

5000|$|The device {{consisted}} of three principal components. A [...] "locator card" [...] purportedly containing a [...] "signature" [...] of the object to be detected was inserted into a plastic [...] "card reader" [...] {{about the size of}} a tape cassette that could be attached to the user's belt. This was connected to a hand-held unit about 4 in long to which a horizontally swivelling metal antenna was attached. The antenna would purportedly point to the item being sought when a suitable <b>locator</b> <b>card</b> was inserted into the [...] "card reader".|$|E
