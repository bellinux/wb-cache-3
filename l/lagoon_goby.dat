40|$|Female {{ornamentation}} may {{be directly}} sexually selected, by male choice or female competition, or occurs {{as the result}} of a genetic correlation, arising from sexual selection on males. However, increasing evidence supports the former hypothesis, suggesting that males actively choose their partner preferring traits indicative of female quality. In the <b>lagoon</b> <b>goby,</b> Knipowitschia panizzae, a polygynous species whose males perform parental care to eggs, body length and the size of a sex-specific yellow patch on the belly are known to be reliable indicators of female fecundity. In this paper, we tested, using dummies, the male’s mating preferences for female body and yellow belly patch sizes. The two experimental trials in which a single female trait was variable showed that males prefer a larger belly patch and a larger body size, indicating that both these characters are selected by male mate choice. However, when faced with dummies exhibiting an inverse combination of body and belly patch sizes (experiment 3), males significantly preferred the smaller ones with larger yellow belly patches. A calculation of dummy theoretical fecundity reveals that in the first two experiments, males would have received an immediate benefit from their choice in terms of egg number, whereas in the third one, males chose partners that would have provided them with fewer eggs. The male <b>lagoon</b> <b>goby</b> preference for females with larger belly patches, regardless of their size, suggests that this trait, in addition to indicating fecundity, conveys information about other aspects of female and/or egg quality...|$|E
40|$|Sexually dimorphic {{traits are}} common in fish species, and {{examples}} from {{both males and females}} have been described. The function of these traits has been widely investigated in males. On the contrary, female ornaments have been studied mainly in sex role reversed species, such as pipefish, while their role in species with ‘conventional’ sex roles remain to be investigated. This study focused on the presence, function, and possible role as indicator of female quality of a sexually dimorphic nuptial trait in the <b>lagoon</b> <b>goby,</b> Knipowitschia panizzae. In this species, that present conventional sex roles, females show a yellow spot on the belly. Aquarium spawning experiments demonstrated that the coloration on the belly is due to dermal pigments, is displayed only when female is ready to spawn and is switched off within few minutes from the end of egg deposition. This sexual trait presents variability in size among females and indicates female fecundity relatively to her own body size. As a consequence, female yellow belly appears to be an honest signal of female quality. Field data on natural nests highlighted that males perform parental cares mostly only on one egg batch at a time and the modality of egg deposition suggested that males are limited in their potential reproductive rates by environmental factors. Male limitation in egg care could constitute the basis for a female biased operational sex ratio, favouring male choosiness and the evolution of female nuptial displays...|$|E
50|$|The yellow clown goby inhabits {{the coral}} reefs of {{sheltered}} <b>lagoons.</b> Unlike most <b>gobies,</b> which are burrowers, Gobiodon sp. roost {{in the outer}} branches of Acropora (staghorn) corals, in groups of five to fifteen individuals.|$|R
5000|$|... 27 {{parasite}} {{species are}} {{known from the}} grass goby near the Crimean coasts. The acanthocephalans Acanthocephaloides propinquus are most numerous. In the north-western Black Sea this fish has 13 parasite species. Except for the aforementioned A. propinquus, another acanthocephalan, Telosentis exiguus, is very numerous. Both are Mediterranean immigrants such as their host, the grass goby. Also, the Ponto-Caspian cestodes Proteocephalus gobiorum and monogeneans Gyrodactylus proterorhini were very numerous. In the Budaki <b>Lagoon</b> the grass <b>goby</b> is a host of larvae of epizootic nematode Streptocara crassicauda.|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of genetic {{damage has been}} investigated in two native species of the Venice lagoon: the common mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis and the grass goby Zosterisessor ophiocephalus. Two sampling campaigns were performed in summer 1998 and 1999. Aromatic-like DNA adducts were analysed in selected tissues of gobies and mussels by using the 32 P-postlabelling assay. In 1999, micronuclei and other nuclear abnormalities were additionally scored on gill cells and haemocytes of individual mussels whereas inorganic (As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Ni, Pb, Sn) as well as organic contaminants (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls and other chlorinated compounds) were measured in the total mussel pulp. Compared to the <b>lagoon</b> inlet area, <b>gobies</b> and mussels from the industrial district (Marghera) showed significant DNA adduct levels and increased frequencies of cytogenetic alterations (evidence of genetic damage was absent or inconsistent in other sites). The substantial levels of aromatic and chlorinated contaminants detected in mussels from Marghera also support the exposure of native organisms to genotoxic agents...|$|R
