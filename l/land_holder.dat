5|$|Harrison County was {{originally}} part of Knox County and Clark County but was separated in 1808. It {{was the first}} Indiana county formed by the Indiana territorial legislature and not the Governor. The county originally contained land that is now parts of Crawford, Floyd, Washington, Jackson, Clark, Lawrence, Perry, Scott and Orange Counties. The county was named for William Henry Harrison, the first governor of Indiana Territory, and later a General in War of 1812, hero of Tippecanoe, and the 9th U.S. President. Harrison was the largest <b>land</b> <b>holder</b> in the county {{at the time and}} had a small estate at Harrison Spring.|$|E

25|$|The Merovingians {{established}} {{themselves in}} the power vacuum of the former Roman provinces in Gaul, and Clovis I converted to Christianity following his victory over the Alemanni at the Battle of Tolbiac (496), laying {{the foundation of the}} Frankish Empire, the dominant state of early medieval Western Christendom. The Frankish kingdom grew through a complex development of conquest, patronage, and alliance building. Due to salic custom, inheritance rights were absolute, and all land was divided equally among the sons of a dead <b>land</b> <b>holder.</b> This meant that, when the king granted a prince land in reward for service, that prince and all of his descendants had an irrevocable right to that land that no future king could undo. Likewise, those princes (and their sons) could sublet their land to their own vassals, who could in turn sublet the land to lower sub-vassals. This all had the effect of weakening the power of the king as his kingdom grew, since the result was that the land became controlled by not just by more princes and vassals, but by multiple layers of vassals. This also allowed his nobles to attempt to build their own power base, though given the strict salic tradition of hereditary kingship, few would ever consider overthrowing the king.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{measures}} {{impact of}} agricultural land on household income and consumption expenditure, and subsequently assesses impact of agricultural land on poverty and inequality in rural Vietnam. It is found that agricultural land increases {{per capita consumption}} expenditure and income of the <b>land</b> <b>holders</b> by around 2. 7 and 6. 7 percent, respectively. As a result, agricultural land helps poverty reduction. Due to agricultural land, the headcount of poverty for <b>land</b> <b>holders</b> is reduced by around 1. 2 percentage points. Agricultural land also decreases the poverty-gap and poverty-severity indexes for the <b>land</b> <b>holders</b> by around 5. 6 and 6. 6 percent, respectively. However, agricultural land increases rural inequality, albeit at very small magnitude. ...|$|R

40|$|Sub-Saharan Africa is urbanizing rapidly, {{but most}} {{countries}} lack appropriate tools {{to manage their}} urban growth. This creates both risks and opportunities for prospective <b>land</b> <b>holders,</b> resulting in a tangle of insecure land rights and claims under multiple tenure systems. Recently, innovative land tools have been proposed and implemented to formalize land tenure. It is envisaged that tenure security for <b>land</b> <b>holders</b> will increase and in turn contribute to poverty reduction. This study evaluates such tools in three peri-urban areas in Lusaka (Zambia), Oshakati (Namibia) and Gaborone (Botswana), {{with a focus on}} the perspective of the <b>land</b> <b>holders.</b> It is concluded that the tools are to some extent pro-poor, so recommendations for further improvements are made.
