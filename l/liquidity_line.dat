40|$|Completing {{the banking}} union is an urgent project facing the EU, given the eurozone’s {{continued}} vulnerability to idiosyncratic liquidity shocks to national banking systems. The proposed {{changes to the}} European deposit insurance scheme (EDIS) under consideration by the European Commission could open {{the way to a}} satisfactory compromise between the twin needs to reduce legacy risks in banks’ balance sheets and to provide greater risk-sharing and a fiscal backstop for both the Resolution and the EDIS Funds – while continuing to exclude any sharing of past losses. With such a compromise, financial fragmentation would likely recede rapidly, leading to a larger role by private capital in cushioning real and financial idiosyncratic shocks. EDIS could move forward immediately by providing in its early phase that the European Stability Mechanism would provide a <b>liquidity</b> <b>line</b> to national deposit guarantee schemes that had exhausted their funds, with no sharing of losses. Meanwhile, risk-reduction would accelerate through the stronger policies already established by the Single Supervisory Mechanism for the reduction of non-performing loans and a fresh approach to the reduction of banks’ sovereign exposures, based on {{a modified version of the}} large exposure prudential policy. Direct risk-weighting of national sovereigns would be excluded. The ultimate anchor of a stable banking union would be credible policies to reduce excessive sovereign debt-to-GDP ratios.

It first explains the linkages of the banking system to the shadow banking system. Then, due to the complexity of the issues at hand and in order to reach analytical depth, it focuses on the accounting and prudential treatment of a very important part of the shadow banking sector, the market for short term asset backed commercial paper. It traces the impact national regulators in can have on the kind of engagements their banks have in these markets by analysing the differ-ent national regulations in Germany, France, Spain and the Netherlands and the respective engagement of banks from these countries in that market. The overall analysis demonstrates the large scope of action national regulators have in regulating the off-balance sheet en-gagements of their banks. National Regulators are much more than agents enforcing inter-national treaties, rather they are interpreters of international accords in the frame of na-tional law, which leaves much space for interpretation. This implies that national parliamen-tarians, which are interested in increasing the financial stability of their respective banking system, could and should engage in a close supervision of the actions of their national bank-ing regulators in this field in order to avoid regulatory capture. For this purpose they can use international comparisons by international organizations such as the OECD, international auditing firms and the rating agencies. The paper closes by showing the most recent changes in the treatment of off-balance sheet engagements of banks on the international level in order to sensitize the readers to potential issues of interpretation involved in their interpre-tation.

40|$|The ongoing {{credit crunch}} {{represents}} the fi rst {{crisis of the}} age of mass securitization. One conclusion sometimes drawn is that the costs of securitization, in the form of risks to fi nancial stability, exceed the benefits. The implication is that we should return to the simpler days when commercial banks originate loans to households and fi rms and hold them on their balance sheets, rather than slicing them, dicing them and selling them off. But this back-to-the-future formula ignores economic realities. Securitization is bound up with the broader deregulation of fi nancial markets and with the information-technology revolution. Policy makers cannot eliminate this process short of reimposing the kind of restrictive regulation to which banking and fi nancial systems were subject half a century ago. <b>liquidity</b> <b>lines</b> provided by financial institutions. Market liquidity depends not only on objective, exogenous factors, but also on endogenous market dynamics. Central banks responsible for systemic stability need to consider how far their traditional responsibility for the health of the banking system needs to be adapted to promote stability in the relevant financial markets. In any case, turning back the clock would not be desirable because the constellation of financial innovations referred to as securitization has real benefits for the economy. Those innovations have allowed the financial system to repackage and spread risk. They have reduced the amount of equity capital that this system requires to absorb that risk. The result has been to lower funding costs for both fi rms and homeowners as a class. In the aftermath of the Great Securitization Crisis of 2007 - 8, would-be reformers will surely say that financial regulators need to rethink speed limits and rules of the road. In my view, policy makers should focus on the banking system. Banks still play a unique role. They {{are at the center of}} the information-impacted segments of the financial system. Their key role and their vulnerability are recognized by the protection they receive via the financial safety net. Re-thinking should start with the role of Basel II, and within Basel II of the role of internal models and bond ratings. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates {{a unique}} dataset {{describing}} how {{public and private}} firms in Europe use lines of credit during the 2008 - 9 financial crisis. Our analysis emphasizes the interaction between internal funds, external funds, and real decisions such as corporate investment and employment. Among other things, we find that firms that generally face restricted access to credit (small, private, non-investment grade, and unprofitable) draw more funds from their credit lines during the crisis than their large, public, investment-grade, profitable counterparts. The terms of credit line facilities changed significantly with the crisis: maturities declined, while commitment fees and interest spreads went up. Our evidence suggests that while being profitable helps firms establish credit lines, it does not monotonically lead to increased use. Instead, lines of credit are used when internal funds (cash stocks and cash flows) decline. Looking at real-side decisions, our estimates suggest that lines of credit provide the liquidity "edge" firms need to invest during the crisis.

Multivariate results indicate that credit line availability is directly associated with cash flow uncertainty, dividend distributions, acquisitions, and capital market access and is inversely linked to the market-to-book ratio. Credit line use is unrelated to cash flow volatility and dividends, but is correlated with operating cash flow, acquisitions, and capital market access. Unlike with non-REITs, when setting credit limits lenders focus on dividends and not just operating cash flow.

An important channel for this correlation is the use of cash flow-based financial covenants by banks that supply credit lines. Firms must maintain high cash flow to remain compliant with covenants, and banks restrict firm access to credit facilities in response to covenant violations. Using the cash flow sensitivity of cash as a measure of financial constraints, I provide evidence that lack of access to a line of credit is a more statistically powerful measure of financial constraints than traditional measures used in the literature...|$|R
40|$|During {{the course}} of 2007, global {{financial}} markets went through noticeable periods of turbulence. In particular, complex credit markets suffered a marked set-back. Oddly, turmoil in these fairly new markets contributed to severe liquidity shortages in short-term money and interbank markets, triggering repeated large-scale monetary interventions by central banks worldwide. Recent events have thus demonstrated that banks are considerably intertwined in fi nancial markets; dependent on and exposed to them as regards liquidity. The aim {{of this article is}} to better understand this complex relationship and to frame relevant aspects of the latest fi nancial market turmoil accordingly. In particular, we explore the mechanics of a market liquidity crisis and its impact on individual banks’ liquidity, as well as possible spillovers to other banks. These dynamics of course raise a number of policy issues. Here, we focus on the role that greater disclosure to markets on banks’ liquidity situation itself could play as a market-stabilising device. In summary, global banks have increasingly integrated into capital markets and in terms of both funding and asset liquidity rely considerably on functioning, liquid financial markets. This is particularly visible in the shift towards secured lending transactions; growth of the securitisation market; the broadening of collateral to encompass complex products with shifting levels of market liquidity; and the rise in committed credit or <b>liquidity</b> <b>lines</b> to sponsored special purpose vehicles (SPVs) and corporates. While some of the recent developments in fi nancial market liquidity can be attributed to technological progress, importantly, more temporary factors resulting from an environment of low interest rates have accelerated market liquidity beyond sustainable levels. While, per se, banks’ ability to “liquify” assets represents a positive development which should help mitigate the fundamental liquidity risk that banks face, increased sensitivity with respect to market liquidity risk has also created new vulnerabilities with respect to sudden reversals of market liquidity. Importantly, adverse circumstances could trigger a combined increase in demands on liquid assets via margin requirements and activation of credit <b>lines</b> and reduced <b>liquidity</b> of assets and related market funding sources. The severe loss of liquidity in asset-backed securities markets and its repercussions on global interbank markets during 2007 provide a vivid illustration of the channels that link market liquidity to banks’ funding and asset liquidity and of the wider externalities of idiosyncratic liquidity shocks. How can these risks be addressed? Together with active liquidity management, disclosure may represent one tool through which such vulnerability may be reduced. A large literature exists on the merits of transparency in banking. Greater transparency should alleviate refi nancing frictions related to asymmetric information. When information problems are however deeper and concern aggregate uncertainty, improved disclosure on credit fundamentals may be less effective to restore confidence. Instead, better information on liquidity itself may be necessary. We explore the current availability of information on banks’ liquidity and funding risks. Overall, information appears to be limited –failing to disclose in a comprehensive and comparable way the underlying dynamics of liquidity demands and funding sources. But liquidity is volatile and banks are subject to inherent liquidity mismatches. Can greater disclosure in this area ever be a useful tool to reinforce market discipline in a systemically stabilising fashion? While this question merits serious reflection, the 2007 market events have shown that current information gaps are large and need addressing. ...|$|R
40|$|After {{overcoming}} various {{financial crises}} in the mid- 90 's and early millennium (Tequila, Asian, Russian, Brazil, Argentina and Ecuador) Latin America found a proper environment conducive to reach sustained growth and macroeconomic stability. Endogenous elements - such as credit growth, {{the implementation of}} countercyclical funds, prudential public finances management, the establishment of inflation targets, the incentive to accumulate reserves, healthier external balances- and exogenous factors, mainly linked {{to an increase in}} commodity prices and low international interest rates, favored a scenario of higher output growth for the region as a whole. During these last years Latin American companies have been able to increase their production capacity, expand regionally and globally. Governments have made huge investment projects related to infrastructure and communications. The latter was facilitated by the context described above as well as the optimism created by greater political stability. Correspondingly, it was also driven by the amount of new funding instruments that have been available. There is whole range of financial products; from local to global emissions, settled in foreign or local currency, extension of <b>liquidity</b> <b>lines,</b> mixed instruments powered by multilateral banks, use of collateral for export finance, structured asset-backed securities are just a glimpse of all the financial spectrum of possibilities. These changes have provided governments the necessary tools to mitigate the impacts of the global financial crisis, especially on their most vulnerable populations. However, in the advent of a potential decline in growth from 2011 - 2013 -with respect to the strong rebound in 2010 - it is expected that a number of factors will limit the margin of actions that the authorities have to implement further countercyclical policies. Thus, the delayed recovery of the U. S., the deepening of the European crisis, a possible reversal of the terms of trade, less favorable external accounts and domestic inflationary processes will undermine the responsiveness of governments to the new situation. In this context it is of great importance to understand and appreciate relevant trends in some of the sources capable of enabling growth financing, while encouraging investment and job creation. This paper focuses on the characteristics and trends in Latin American debt capital markets, highlighting the importance of having domestic sources of funding as well as local currency issues. The investigation continues the discussion presented by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff (2008) about "the forgotten history of domestic debt" and research studies elaborated by Serge Jeanneau and Camilo Tovar (2008) in relation to local currency bond issues. It also exhibits {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} these trends; revisiting E. Cavallo’s question (2010) on how safe is really the new debt composition. To introduce the analysis of debt markets in a framework and a chronological conjuncture, the starting point of this study is an assessment form based on the behavior of key macroeconomic variables. First the macroeconomic fundamentals that underpin the functioning of financial markets are measured, examining whether major changes have occurred or just temporary responses have been randomly implemented (something common in the region). Secondly, an overview of the Latin American debt markets will be presented, focusing on the factors that have allowed their recent development. Afterwards, the main characteristics of local bond markets and current trends will be exhibit. This includes revealing trends in local currency debt issuances, prevailing actors as well as discussing the role of regional and multilateral banks. This work is intended to be "communicated" to a diverse audience: academia, public policy makers and private sector. In this sense it has sought to provide concrete examples that account for the trends found. Data sources used include ECLAC statistics, the database of the Inter-American Development, Bank of International Settlements (BIS), World Bank database, multiple International Monetary Fund (IMF) datasets, OECD reports and statistics, the Institute of International Finance (IIF), Emerging Markets Trading Association (EMTA), official data from central banks, investment banks research and rating agencies.

40|$|The {{theory of}} {{financial}} intermediation states that liquidity creation {{has been the}} main source of risk for banks. This points out to a possible correlation between banks’ liquidity creation and financial crisis. It is believed that that the period preceding the recent Global Financial Crisis (2007 - 2008) was characterised by abundant liquidity, excessive lending due to deterioration of lending standards and trend towards securitisation. This study attempts to examine empirically this possible correlation by studying the behaviour of liquidity creation of major UK banks/ building societies around the crisis, over the period 2001 - 2010 using the recently developed measure by Berger and Bouwman (2007). Further, the relationship between bank capital and liquidity creation is empirically tested to verify which alternative hypothesis ‘Financial fragility-crowding out’ or ‘Risk absorption’ dominates the relationship in case of UK banks. Results show that positive ‘abnormal’ (relative to a trend <b>line)</b> <b>liquidity</b> creation preceded the financial crisis which emphasizes on the incremental explanatory power of liquidity creation in predicting banking crisis even after accounting for macroeconomic factors, which in turn provide important policy implications on the real sector. Also, results show that liquidity creation and bank capital are negatively related consistent with the empirical dominance of the ‘Financial-fragility-crowding out’ hypothesis, implying that higher bank capital crowds out deposits, reduce the financial fragility of the bank and hence reduce its ability to create liquidity. This puts the spot light on regulation behind capital requirements and liquidity management by financial authorities.
