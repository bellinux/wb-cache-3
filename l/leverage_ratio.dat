5|$|Countries {{sought to}} improve the {{sustainability}} and transparency of the global financial system in response to crises in the 1980s and 1990s. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision was formed in 1974 by the G-10 members' central bank governors to facilitate cooperation on the supervision and regulation of banking practices. It is headquartered at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland. The committee has held several rounds of deliberation known collectively as the Basel Accords. The first of these accords, known as Basel I, took place in 1988 and emphasized credit risk and the assessment of different asset classes. Basel I was motivated by concerns over whether large multinational banks were appropriately regulated, stemming from observations during the 1980s Latin American debt crisis. Following Basel I, the committee published recommendations on new capital requirements for banks, which the G-10 nations implemented four years later. In 1999, the G-10 established the Financial Stability Forum (reconstituted by the G-20 in 2009 as the Financial Stability Board) to facilitate cooperation among regulatory agencies and promote stability in the global financial system. The Forum was charged with developing and codifying twelve international standards and implementation thereof. The Basel II accord was set in 2004 and again emphasized capital requirements as a safeguard against systemic risk {{as well as the}} need for global consistency in banking regulations so as not to competitively disadvantage banks operating internationally. It was motivated by what were seen as inadequacies of the first accord such as insufficient public disclosure of banks' risk profiles and oversight by regulatory bodies. Members were slow to implement it, with major efforts by the European Union and United States taking place as late as 2007 and 2008. In 2010, the Basel Committee revised the capital requirements in a set of enhancements to Basel II known as Basel III, which centered on a <b>leverage</b> <b>ratio</b> requirement aimed at restricting excessive leveraging by banks. In addition to strengthening the ratio, Basel III modified the formulas used to weight risk and compute the capital thresholds necessary to mitigate the risks of bank holdings, concluding the capital threshold should be set at 7% of the value of a bank's risk-weighted assets.|$|E
25|$|The {{rebalancing}} and re-indexing of leveraged ETFs {{may have}} considerable costs when markets are volatile. The rebalancing {{problem is that}} the fund manager incurs trading losses because he needs to buy when the index goes up and sell when the index goes down in order to maintain a fixed <b>leverage</b> <b>ratio.</b> A 2.5% daily change in the index will for example reduce value of a -2x bear fund by about 0.18% per day, which means that {{about a third of the}} fund may be wasted in trading losses within a year (1-(1-0.18%)252=36.5%). Investors may however circumvent this problem by buying or writing futures directly, accepting a varying <b>leverage</b> <b>ratio.</b> A more reasonable estimate of daily market changes is 0.5%, which leads to a 2.6% yearly loss of principal in a 3x leveraged fund.|$|E

Both Fannie and Freddie had {{positive}} net worth as of {{the date of the}} takeover, meaning the value of their assets exceeded their liabilities. However, Fannie's total assets to capital (<b>leverage</b> <b>ratio)</b> was about 20:1, while Freddie's was about 70:1. These numbers increase significantly if one includes all the mortgage-backed assets they guaranteed. These ratios are considerably higher than investment banks, which leverage around 30:1.|$|E

25|$|An inverse ETF, {{like any}} {{leveraged}} ETF, needs to buy {{when the market}} rises and sell when it falls {{in order to maintain}} a fixed <b>leverage</b> <b>ratio.</b> This results in a volatility loss proportional to the market variance. Compared to a short position with identical initial exposure, the inverse ETF will therefore usually deliver inferior returns. The exception is if the market declines significantly on low volatility so that the capital gain outweighs the volatility loss. Such large declines benefit the inverse ETF because the relative exposure of the short position drops as the market fall.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} {{leverage}} is {{also reflected in}} the pricing of options written on leveraged ETFs. In particular, the terminal payoff of a leveraged ETF European/American put or call depends on the realized variance (hence the path) of the underlying index. The impact of <b>leverage</b> <b>ratio</b> can also be observed from the implied volatility surfaces of leveraged ETF options. For instance, the implied volatility curves of inverse leveraged ETFs (with negative multipliers such as -1, -2, or -3) are commonly observed to be increasing in strike, which is characteristically different from the implied volatility smiles or skews seen for index options or non-leveraged ETF options.|$|E
25|$|Critics have {{suggested}} that the complexity inherent in securitization can limit investors' ability to monitor risks, and that competitive securitization markets with multiple securitizers may be particularly prone to sharp declines in underwriting standards. Private, competitive mortgage securitization is believed to have {{played an important role in}} the US subprime mortgage crisis. In addition, off–balance sheet treatment for securitizations coupled with guarantees from the issuer are said to make the securitizing firm's leverage less transparent, thereby facilitating risky capital structures and allowing credit risk underpricing. Off–balance sheet securitizations are believed to have played a large role in the high <b>leverage</b> <b>ratio</b> of US financial institutions before the financial crisis.|$|E

500|$|Governor of the Bank of England {{and former}} Governor of the Bank of Canada Mark Carney has {{described}} two approaches to global financial reform: shielding financial institutions from cyclic economic effects by strengthening banks individually, and defending economic cycles from banks by improving systemic resiliency. Strengthening financial institutions necessitates stronger capital requirements and liquidity provisions, {{as well as}} better measurement and management of risks. The G-20 agreed to new standards presented by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision at its 2009 summit in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The standards included <b>leverage</b> <b>ratio</b> targets to supplement other capital adequacy requirements established by Basel II. Improving the resiliency of the global financial system requires protections that enable the system to withstand singular institutional and market failures. Carney has argued that policymakers have converged on the view that institutions must {{bear the burden of}} financial losses during future financial crises, and such occurrences should be well-defined and pre-planned. He suggested other national regulators follow Canada in establishing staged intervention procedures and require banks to commit to what he termed [...] "living wills" [...] which would detail plans for an orderly institutional failure.|$|E

Thus, leverage dynamics crucially hinge upon {{the structure of the}} investment process and otherwise identical firms appear to have significantly different target <b>leverage</b> <b>ratios.</b> Structural estimation of key parameters reveals that simulated model moments can match data moments.

40|$|Bank <b>leverage</b> <b>ratios</b> {{have made}} an {{impressive}} and largely unopposed return; they are mostly used alongside risk-weighted capital requirements. The reasons for this return are manifold, {{and they are not}} limited to the fact that bank equity levels {{in the wake of the}} global financial crisis (GFC) were exceptionally thin, necessitating a string of costly bailouts. A number of other factors have been equally important; these include, among others, the world's revulsion with debt following the GFC and the eurozone crisis, and the universal acceptance of Hyman Minsky's insights into the nature of the financial system and its role in the real economy. The best examples of the causal link between excessive debt, asset bubbles, and financial instability are the Spanish and Irish banking crises, which resulted from nothing more sophisticated than straightforward real estate loans. Bank <b>leverage</b> <b>ratios</b> are primarily seen as a microprudential measure that intends to increase bank resilience. Yet in today's environment of excessive liquidity due to very low interest rates and quantitative easing, bank <b>leverage</b> <b>ratios</b> should also be viewed as a key part of the macroprudential framework. In this context, this paper discusses the role of <b>leverage</b> <b>ratios</b> as both microprudential and macroprudential measures. As such, it explains the role of the leverage cycle in causing financial instability and sheds light on the impact of leverage restraints on good bank governance and allocative efficiency...|$|R
