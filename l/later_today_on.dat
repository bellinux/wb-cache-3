25|$|The {{development}} of the West Side was forged {{in the early years}} by divisions and subdivisions of the land, which created lot lines still followed by streets <b>today.</b> <b>Later</b> <b>on,</b> the railroad created a clear social dividing line which made the West Side the village's working-class neighborhood. The resort era also impacted the district on its fringes.|$|R

5000|$|At {{the end of}} his March 8, 1950 {{episode of}} his You Bet Your Life radio show, Groucho half-heartedly {{promotes}} the film as [...] "Harpo, Chico, and I tell a few jokes and do some acting.

[...] In <b>later</b> years, <b>on</b> <b>Today,</b> Groucho dismissed it as a [...] "terrible movie", while speaking of the lasting impression Marilyn Monroe made during her screen test.|$|R
50|$|After the Second World War, {{there was}} another {{economic}} upswing, which brought along with it more population growth. Beginning in the 1960s, {{it was clear that}} another restructuring was needed. Since that time, no more tanning has been done in Kirn and even the small leather goods industry found itself undergoing changes. Instead of leather, plastic goods are now produced. With the amalgamation of the villages of Kallenfels and Kirnsulzbach in 1969, the population rose for a time above 10,000, only to shrink <b>later</b> <b>on.</b> <b>Today,</b> somewhat more than 8,000 people call Kirn home.|$|R

2500|$|In 1987, Gannett and {{producer}} Grant Tinker began developing a newsmagazine series for first-run syndication that attempted {{to bring the}} breezy style of USA Today to television. The result was USA Today: The Television Show (<b>later</b> retitled USA <b>Today</b> <b>on</b> TV, then shortened to simply USA <b>Today),</b> which premiered <b>on</b> September 12, 1988. Correspondents on the program included Edie Magnus, Robin Young, Boyd Matson, Kenneth Walker, Dale Harimoto, Ann Abernathy, Bill Macatee and Beth Ruyak. As with the newspaper itself, the show was divided into four [...] "sections" [...] corresponding to the {{different parts of the}} paper: News (focusing on the major headlines of the day), Money (focusing on financial news and consumer reports), Sports (focusing on sports news and scores) and Life (focusing on entertainment and lifestyle-related stories).|$|R

50|$|The survey {{mentions}} the praying {{areas in the}} khan, but the court around the pit and its mosque apparently did not exist. It appears they had been ruined in the earthquake {{at the beginning of}} 1837, and its remains were used to build the sheepfold, which is still adjacent to the eastern wall of the khan. The court surrounding the pit is still mentioned one year after the earthquake, but it is possible that at this time one could still make out the remains of the court, and the sheepfold was built <b>later</b> <b>on.</b> <b>Today,</b> all that is left of the court and mosque are only remnants of their foundations, and the origins of these remnants are dubious.|$|R
50|$|Coming from {{a family}} that practiced Kardec Spiritism, Anaya first had contact with the more subtle {{energies}} of the Universe through her paternal grandmother, Izabel Romano. While still at a young age, she was introduced to Hinduism and Zen Buddhism, and Yoga, which she practices until <b>today.</b> <b>Later</b> <b>on</b> she dedicated herself to study and research the life and work of Jiddu Krishnamurti, and to esoteric astrology. She studied tarot, I Ching, chromotherapy, aromatherapy, Shiatsu, as well as martial arts, holotropic therapy and the Cabala. She deepened her studies to include alchemy psychology, Temple archeology, the Silva Mind Control Method, and cosmogenesis. She studied anthropogenesis, rays of light, arithmosophy, dowsing, applied kinesiology, Chinese medicine, and Feng Shui, besides delving into quantum physics.|$|R
30|$|The term existential in Chinese {{is first}} {{put forward by}} Lü (1943). He defines the existential in terms of meaning, which is quite {{different}} from what is meant by the term <b>today.</b> <b>Later</b> <b>on,</b> Lü (1946) redefines existentials as clauses expressing the meaning of existence and (dis)appearance. Since the 1950 s, the existential as a special syntactic construction has been much discussed, with new insights appearing from time to time. The frequently addressed topics include its definition, scope and classification, the semantic and syntactic features of the three components of the existential, i.e., the locative nominal group (NGL), the verbal group (VG), and the nominal group (NG) in that order. In recent years, new observations are made with the application of generative linguistics, functional linguistics, and cognitive linguistics {{to the study of the}} construction.|$|R

5000|$|The {{following}} years {{were marked by}} the arrival of celebrated masters of Kouji who advanced the art form by building off of the work of their predecessors. During the Ming dynasty, the most famous Kouji Master was Fang Zhailang who {{is best known for his}} ability to imitate the dialects of different regions. Gou Maoer, who lived and performed during the early period of the Qing dynasty, made his name by creating and performing such pieces as [...] "slaughtering pigs" [...] and [...] "pigs fighting for food". These are amongst the performances that have been passed down through the generations and can still be seen <b>today.</b> <b>Later</b> <b>on</b> in the Qing dynasty during the reign of the Guangxu Emperor there was a very eminent Kouji master who was famous for his mimicry of a song bird called the hwamei (melodious laughingthrush), and therefore was nicknamed Hwamei Yang. Amongst his great performances was “two birds fighting over food”, which is now on the verge of extinction.|$|R

The Early Today title had previously been used for another early morning news program produced by NBC News from 1982 to 1983 (and was replaced by NBC News at Sunrise following its cancellation), which featured the hosts of NBC's Today at the time - Jane Pauley, Bryant Gumbel and Willard Scott.|$|R
5000|$|... "The tunnel has collapsed. We've now got {{to assess}} today why that happened," [...] said Robin Gisby, head of {{operations}} for Network Rail. [...] "Experts are in there right now and they will work through the tunnel and decide what {{was the cause of}} the delay. Then we're going to make it safe, then we're going to work out how we're going to clear up the considerable problem we've got. There's a couple of thousand tonnes of material in there that we've got to move. We've got to get the concrete structure, that has collapsed, out. We've probably got to do all of that by road. Although we brought the material in by rail, we don't think we can get it out by rail, but we won't assess that until <b>later</b> <b>on</b> <b>today</b> and through the night. I think that's going to be at least a week's work, possibly longer, before we can restore rail services on this route. Passengers are being advised to travel via alternative routes and buses have also been ordered. We are currently putting arrangements in place to minimise disruption." ...|$|R

50|$|During the Wisconsinan glaciation, {{the region}} was {{situated}} {{at the edge of}} a large ice sheet over 1000 feet in depth. The ice sheet scraped away large amounts of soil, leaving the bedrock that serves as the geologic foundation for much of the New York City metropolitan region <b>today.</b> <b>Later</b> <b>on,</b> the ice sheet would help split apart what are now Long Island and Staten Island.At the time of European contact {{the region was}} inhabited by Native Americans, predominantly the Lenape, and others. The Native Americans used the abundant waterways in the area for many purposes, such as fishing and trade routes. Sailing for France in 1524, Giovanni da Verrazzano was the first European to enter the local waters and encounter the residents, but he did not make landfall. Henry Hudson, sailing for the Dutch in 1609, visited the area and built a settlement on Lower Manhattan Island that was eventually renamed New Amsterdam by Dutch colonists in 1626. In 1664, the area went under English control, and was later renamed New York after King Charles II of England granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York.|$|R
