40|$|In this paper, upper <b>limits</b> <b>on</b> {{the total}} {{luminosity}} of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR) (E > $ 10 ^{ 18 }$ eV) are determined for five individual sources. The upper <b>limit</b> <b>on</b> the integral flux of GeV-TeV gamma-rays {{of a given}} source is used to extract the upper <b>limit</b> <b>on</b> the total UHECR luminosity. The correlation between upper <b>limit</b> <b>on</b> the integral GeVTeV gamma-ray flux and upper <b>limit</b> <b>on</b> the UHECR luminosity is established through the cascading process that takes place during propagation of the cosmic rays in the background radiation fields, as explained in reference [1]. Twenty-eight sources measured by FERMI-LAT, VERITAS and MAGIC observatories have been studied. The measured upper <b>limit</b> <b>on</b> the GeV-TeV gamma-ray flux is restrictive enough to allow the calculation of an upper <b>limit</b> <b>on</b> the total UHECR cosmic-ray luminosity of five sources. The upper <b>limit</b> <b>on</b> the UHECR cosmicray luminosity of these sources is shown for several assumptions on the emission mechanism. For all studied sources an upper <b>limit</b> <b>on</b> the ultra-high-energy proton luminosity is also set. Comment: 17 pages, 31 figure...|$|R
