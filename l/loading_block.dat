40|$|Fatigue damage {{assessment}} of multiaxial random loadings {{is a complex}} issue and a subject of actual interest in mechanical design. In this work, {{the performance of the}} stress scale factor (SSF) criterion is evaluated under variable amplitude loading conditions, and damage accumulation approaches. This evaluation is performed by taking into account two types of loading spectra, namely the <b>loading</b> <b>block</b> spectra (where the loading pattern is well identified and repeated until rupture), and the random loading spectra (where the stochastic behaviour of the axial and shear loading components do not allow a direct identification of the loading pattern). Moreover, the validity of the hypothesis in which the SSF damage map remains valid for any high strength steel under variable amplitude loading conditions is also inspected by analysing fatigue life correlation of the 1050 QT steel and the 304 L stainless steel under a multiaxial <b>loading</b> <b>block.</b> info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

30|$|BT {{results have}} shown {{evidence}} that crack begins {{near to the}} loading points, which occurs because stress–strain field singularity that develops near to the loading points, and the stresses developed exceeds those developed {{at the center of}} the disk (Huang, et al. 2014). In fact, one of the primary preoccupations when using the BT is the stress field that develops near the loading points. Therefore, for decades, researchers had performed experimental and theoretical studies to find out ways to reduce this stress concentration. In general, the studies have focused on improving the contact geometry between the <b>loading</b> <b>block</b> and the specimen (loading geometry) and on incorporating the elastic properties of the two bodies in contact. We defined the loading geometry bearing in mind: (1) the geometric shape of the contact area between the <b>loading</b> <b>block</b> and the specimens, (2) the load distribution on the contact area, and (3) the load projection toward the sample inside. If the bodies in contact can deform elastically and there are not cohesive forces between them, the contact is Hertzian. If the bodies in contact do not deform (or that their deformation is unimportant), the contact is rigid (Adams and Nosonovsky 2000; Kourkoulis et al. 2013; Markides and Kourkoulis 2012; Roux 1998).|$|E

The method mainly consists of two steps, one, evaluation of vibration induced stresses for the given central patch impulse loading using modal analysis, and two, fatigue analysis using S-N curve approach, residual strength approach as well as failure function approach. The stress state in the plate was evaluated using viscous damping model {{as a function of}} time.

3000|$|One way {{to reduce}} {{stresses}} on the contact area is by allowing plastic deformations or ensuring an inelastic contact; this is achieved by placing a cushion with a low yield point that distributes the load and reduces the stress concentration in this area. The cushion compensates for the irregularities of the geometric boundary of the disk. The objective is to distribute the load and to avoid local effects because of stress concentration at points of geometric irregularities in the disk. A cushion of comparatively soft material is placed between the specimen and the <b>loading</b> <b>block</b> of the machine to prevent excessive pressure. A more uniform load distribution is ensured when a thick cushion is used, and it deforms. When the cushion deforms, it creates a band of contact in the specimen that is nearly hydrostatic, which is extremely useful in calculations that assume a uniform load distribution. Placement of a cushion improves {{the stability of the}} test and avoids failures initiation near to the <b>loading</b> <b>block</b> caused by singularities in the stress field, although, the boundary conditions become ambiguous. While the ASTM norm recommends the use of the cushion, the European norm EN 12390 - 6 requires a direct load on the cylinder (Wendner et al. 2014). The contact conditions are the main means that the experimenter has to influence the stress field to be developed within the specimen. Thus, for example, a cushion made of material, such as steel, can be selected for use on soft materials, and soft material, such as cardboard, can be chosen for use on more rigid samples. In practice, it is advisable to maintain a difference of five orders of magnitude between Young’s moduli of the cushion and the sample. If an ideal contact is desired, the condition E_s/ [...]. - 0 ptE_c = ν_s/ [...]. - 0 ptν_c must be fulfilled, where v [...]...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} {{multitasking}} scratchpad memory reuse scheme (MSRS) for the dynamic partitioning of scratchpad memory between tasks in a preemptive multitasking system. We specify {{a means to}} compute the worst-case response time (WCRT) and schedulability of task sets executed using MSRS. Our scratchpad-related preemption delay (SRPD) is an analog of cache-related preemption delay (CRPD), proposed in previous work {{as a way to}} compute the worst-case cost imposed upon a preempted task by preemption in a multitasking system. Unlike CRPD, however, SRPD is independent of the number of tasks and the local memory size. We compare SRPD with CRPD by experiment and determine that neither dominates the other, i. e. either may be better for certain task sets. However, MSRS leads to improved schedulability versus cache when contention for local memory space is high, either because the local memory size is small, or because the task set is large, provided that the cost of <b>loading</b> <b>blocks</b> from external memory to scratchpad is similar to the cost of <b>loading</b> <b>blocks</b> into cache.

30|$|Wood is {{anisotropic}} material and wood has very low tension strength in {{perpendicular to the}} grain direction. The flexural load causes bending moment which consists of tension and compression stress. At the same time the local compressive stress below <b>loading</b> <b>block</b> squeezes the tube-shape center-bored round timber like rubber tube.

As a result, the center-bored round timbers were flattened and collapsed. This flattening failure mode is well known in steel pipe design. Under center-point bending stress, a pointing load forms plastic hinges in the steel pipe which are separated by a 90 ° angle at the circumference. Because of the plastic hinges, the stress pipe can be flattened. In a tree with a hole inside due to decay, a similar failure mode was observed [24 – 26]. A tree splinters longitudinally at theses points into at least four pieces [25, 27]. The center-bored round timber specimens in this study collapsed similarly as a tress with an inner hole.|$|E
