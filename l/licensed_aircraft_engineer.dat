2500|$|The damage, {{described}} in The Sydney Morning Herald as [...] "potentially life-threatening and extremely rare", caused <b>aircraft</b> <b>engineer</b> Peter Marosszeky, from the University of New South Wales {{to state that}} [...] "I rarely ever see a failure like this on any engine", while Paul Cousins, the federal president of the Australian <b>Licensed</b> <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Engineers</b> Association stated that [...] "fewer than 5% of engine failures involved debris leaving the casing of the engine", {{as was the case}} in this accident.|$|R
50|$|The Australian <b>Licensed</b> <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Engineers</b> Association (ALAEA) is an Australian {{employee}} organisation (effectively a trade union) {{which represents}} <b>aircraft</b> maintenance <b>engineers.</b> The ALAEA is {{registered with the}} Australian Industrial Relations Commission and affiliated with the Australian Council of Trade Unions. ALAEA is not affiliated with an Australian political party, but maintains industrial affiliations with the NSW Labor Council and the International Transport Workers' Federation. ALAEA was formed in 1964. It sees its own function as a professional association, which puts it within the services model of union organisation. ALAEA does not describe itself as a trade union, or organisation of workers.|$|R
25|$|The 1951 novel Round the Bend by Nevil Shute is {{the story}} of two men, both British <b>Licensed</b> <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Engineers.</b> A large number of {{different}} aircraft types, both fictitious and real, feature in the book. The narrator and one of the protagonists of the story is Tom Cutter, and the novel details his efforts to establish an air charter business in Bahrain immediately after World War II. His first aircraft is a de Havilland Fox Moth; it is later joined by several other aircraft as the business expands, mostly fictitious, but among them a Percival Proctor.|$|R
50|$|Turkish Technic was {{incorporated}} in 2006. It operates in three hangars for narrowbody and widebody airplanes and a VIP & light airplanes hangar in IST, {{in a total}} enclosed area of 130,000 m² with a workforce of 3,000 employees. Approximately 1,800 of these are technicians and almost 1,300 of these technicians are licensed (LAE - <b>Licensed</b> <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Engineers).</b> The newly built facilities in SAW encompass a hangar for 11 single-aisle aircraft and a separate hangar for three long-haul airframes. The complex is a total enclosed area of 380,000 m² with more than 3,100 employees. A separate narrowbody hangar exists in Esenboğa International Airport (ESB), Ankara.|$|R
5000|$|An <b>Aircraft</b> Maintenance <b>Engineer</b> (AME), also <b>Licensed</b> <b>Aircraft</b> Maintenance <b>Engineer</b> (LAME or L-AME), is a {{licensed}} person who carries out and certifies <b>aircraft</b> maintenance. The <b>license</b> is widespread internationally and is recognised by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The American FAA recognise the qualification {{in foreign countries}} but {{refer to it as}} Aviation Maintenance Engineer rather than [...] "Aircraft...".|$|R
25|$|In {{response}} to ongoing industrial unrest over failed negotiations involving three unions (the Australian <b>Licensed</b> <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Engineers</b> Association (ALAEA), the Australian and International Pilots Association (AIPA) and the Transport Workers Union of Australia (TWU), the company grounded its entire {{domestic and international}} fleet from 5pm AEDT on 29 October. Employees involved would be locked out from 8p.m. AEDT on 31 October. It was reported that the grounding would have a daily financial impact of A$20 million. In {{the early hours of}} 31 October, Fair Work Australia ordered that all industrial action taken by Qantas and the involved trade unions be terminated immediately. The order was requested by the federal government amid fears that an extended period of grounding would do significant damage to the national economy, especially the tourism and mining sectors. The grounding affected an estimated 68,000 customers worldwide.|$|R
50|$|The Australian Trade Union Archives {{claim that}} ALAEA's current {{membership}} is {{in excess of}} 3000 members. The ALAEA claims to have in excess of 4000 members and in its most recent annual return claimed to have 4085 members as of 1 January 2005 http://www.e-airc.gov.au/files/107n/AR2006116a.pdf, although this date {{could have been a}} typographical error (and should have been 1 January 2006) as the previous year's annual return also referred to the same date. ALAEA's membership coverage is for <b>Licensed</b> <b>Aircraft</b> Maintenance <b>Engineers</b> (LAMES), <b>Aircraft</b> Maintenance <b>Engineers</b> (AMES), technical and engineering support staff.|$|R
50|$|In 2008, {{the school}} joined a {{partnership}} with Skywest Airlines, a Western Australian-based regional airline. With this partnership, aviation students can now undertake work experience and Structured Workplace Learning (SWL) at Skywest Airlines, assisting <b>Licensed</b> <b>Aircraft</b> Maintenance <b>Engineers</b> (LAME's) to undertake maintenance on Fokker 50 and Fokker 100 jet aircraft. In addition, upper school aviation {{students are able to}} undertake return flights with Skywest pilots. Students work with the pilots to determine the weight and balance of the aircraft, decipher complex meteorological data and apply navigation principles relevant to these sophisticated jet aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Star Air Aviation {{established}} Academy of Aviation Excellence (AAE) in 2011 {{to train}} airline staff. The AAE campuses {{are located in}} Karachi and Lahore. Currently AAE is providing the aviation industry with <b>aircraft</b> <b>licensed</b> <b>Engineers</b> (AMEL) courses i.e. EASA B1/B2, with many other commercial courses including ground and traffic handling, dangerous goods regulations, train the trainee, aviation legislation and human traffic.|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} potential regulatory and safety problems {{arising from the}} outsourcing and offshoring of heavy aircraft maintenance. We {{raise questions about the}} advisability of using increasingly complex supply chains in the aircraft maintenance industry where safety standards are paramount. Greater disarticulation of maintenance work makes regulatory oversight more convoluted and expensive to do thoroughly and transparently. Using a Pressure, Disorganisation and Regulatory Failure model, the article highlights how new work arrangements involving increased use of supply chains are developing more quickly than adequate airline, union and regulator responses to the safety problems engendered by those changes. In often heated industrial debates between <b>licensed</b> <b>aircraft</b> maintenance <b>engineers</b> (LAMEs) and airline managers about business needs and safety, we urge that more attention be paid to LAME concerns about outsourcing...|$|R
