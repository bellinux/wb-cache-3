He also represented the Aluminum Wares Association. In the early 1930s, he helped get aluminum windows installed in the U.S. Department of Commerce Building, at the time the largest office building in the world.|$|E

5000|$|The {{number of}} {{registered}} Washington <b>lobbyists</b> is substantial. In 2009, the Washington Post {{estimated that there}} were 13,700 registered <b>lobbyists,</b> describing the nation's Capitol as [...] "teeming with lobbyists.". In 2011, The Guardian estimated {{that in addition to}} the approximately 13,000 registered <b>lobbyists,</b> thousands more unregistered <b>lobbyists</b> could exist in Washington. [...] The ratio of <b>lobbyists</b> employed by the healthcare industry, compared with every elected politician, was six to one, according to one account. Nevertheless, the numbers of <b>lobbyists</b> actively engaged in lobbying is considerably less, and the ones occupied with lobbying full-time and making significant money is even less.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} state legislators' {{perceptions about}} health and tobacco <b>lobbyists,</b> their frequency {{of contact with}} these <b>lobbyists,</b> {{and the amount of}} campaign contributions from health professional organisations and the tobacco industry. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SUBJECTS: State legislators from North Carolina, Texas, and Vermont (USA), serving in 1994. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Perceptions about <b>lobbyists</b> representing the tobacco industry, non-profit health organisations, and state medical societies with respect to their credibility, importance as sources of information, and persuasiveness; extent of lobbying activities; campaign contributions from health professional organisations and the tobacco industry. RESULTS: Almost all legislators reported that medical society and non-profit health organisation <b>lobbyists</b> are credible on tobacco issues and just over half believed that these <b>lobbyists</b> are important sources of information. More legislators said they could be persuaded by medical and health <b>lobbyists</b> than by tobacco <b>lobbyists.</b> Although health professional Political Action Committees (PACs) gave campaign contributions to more state legislators, and gave higher amounts on average, than tobacco PACs, legislators reported less contact with medical society <b>lobbyists</b> than tobacco <b>lobbyists</b> about tobacco issues. CONCLUSIONS: State legislators have positive attitudes toward <b>lobbyists</b> for non-profit health organisations and state medical societies regarding tobacco issues. These groups may be an underused resource for educating legislators about tobacco control measures. ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1963, {{while at}} Northwestern University, Milbrath {{published}} The Washington <b>Lobbyists.</b> Building upon his early {{interest in the}} role money plays in politics, he sought to analyze and explain the influence of <b>lobbyists</b> on congressional actors in Washington, D.C. Very little empirical research had been conducted on them before that time. [...] The Washington <b>Lobbyists</b> was considered a path breaking work. [...] Much {{to the surprise of}} political scientists at the time, his survey suggested that <b>lobbyists</b> exerted little influence and, instead, were a critical source of information for legislators. Exactly how <b>lobbyists</b> communicated with legislators was a focus of Milbrath's study.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES. This {{research}} took {{a quantitative}} look at state-level tobacco lobbying in the United States. METHODS. Publicly available lobbying {{data were collected}} from all states during 1994. Data were compiled on tobacco industry <b>lobbyists,</b> their tobacco employers, health <b>lobbyists,</b> and factors associated with such lobbying. RESULTS. In 1994, 450 tobacco industry <b>lobbyists</b> lobbied at a state level. Most lobbying was on behalf of four organizations: Philip Morris (34 %), the Tobacco Institute (21 %), RJ Reynolds (17 %), and the Smokeless Tobacco Council (15 %). Approximately one half of all tobacco <b>lobbyists</b> also lobbied for a health-related organization (e. g., state medical association, hospital, physician association). CONCLUSIONS. All US states have tobacco <b>lobbyists.</b> Many health organizations knowingly or unknowingly employ <b>lobbyists</b> who also lobby for the tobacco industry...|$|R
50|$|In 2006, the TPA {{was criticized}} for its use of <b>lobbyists</b> by Olivia Chow, NDP MP for the riding {{including}} the Airport. Chow accused the governing Harper government of backing down on a promise to slay cronyism in Ottawa because Tory-connected <b>lobbyists</b> were pushing the expansion of Toronto's controversial island airport. Raitt stated that the Port Authority spends around CDN $50,000 a year on <b>lobbyists,</b> and confirmed that their <b>lobbyists</b> were: Peter Naglik, Vic Gupta and Bill Hearn.|$|R

5|$|Alarmed by over grazing of meadows, logging {{of giant}} sequoia, and other damage, Muir changed {{from being a}} {{promoter}} and scientist to an advocate for further protection. He persuaded many influential people to camp {{with him in the}} area, such as Ralph Waldo Emerson in 1871. Muir tried to convince his guests that the entire area should be under federal protection. None of his guests through the 1880s could do much for Muir's cause, except for Robert Underwood Johnson, editor of Century Magazine. Through Johnson, Muir had a national audience for his writing and a highly motivated and crafty congressional <b>lobbyist.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite his popularity, Goldschmidt {{left office}} after only one term, {{becoming}} an influential and controversial <b>lobbyist.</b> Over the next dozen years or so, he was criticized by editorial boards and Oregonians for {{several of the}} causes he supported, including backing the forestry corporation, Weyerhaeuser in its hostile takeover of Oregon's Willamette Industries and his advocacy for a private investment firm {{in its attempt to}} take over Portland General Electric, a local utility company. In 2003, Governor Ted Kulongoski appointed him to the Oregon Board of Higher Education, a position he resigned after admitting he had a sexual relationship with a minor girl 30 years earlier.|$|E

Lack of transparency, unclear <b>lobbyist</b> relations, conflicts of interests and excessive spending of the Commission was highlighted {{in a number of}} reports by internal and independent auditing organisations. It has also been criticised on IT-related issues, particularly with regard to Microsoft.|$|E
5|$|In March 2013 Brown joined Nixon Peabody, {{a company}} which {{provides}} legal and lobbying services.

40|$|What do <b>lobbyists</b> do? Some {{believe that}} lobbyists’ main {{role is to}} provide issue-specific {{information}} and expertise to congressmen to help guide the law-making process. Others believe that <b>lobbyists</b> mainly provide the firms and other special interests they represent with access to politicians in their “circle of influence” and that this access is the be-all and end-all of how <b>lobbyists</b> affect the lawmaking process. This paper combines a descriptive analysis with more targeted testing to get inside the black box of the lobbying process and inform {{our understanding of the}} relative importance of these two views of lobbying. We exploit multiple sources of data covering the period 1999 to 2008, including: federal lobbying registration from the Senate Office of Public Records, Federal Election Commission reports, committee and subcommittee assignments for the 106 th to 110 th Congresses, and background information on individual <b>lobbyists.</b> A pure issue expertise view of lobbying does not fit the data well. Instead, maintaining connections to politicians appears central to what <b>lobbyists</b> do. In particular, we find that whom <b>lobbyists</b> are connected to (through political campaign donations) directly affects what they work on. More importantly, <b>lobbyists</b> appear to systematically switch issues as the politicians they were previously connected to switch committee assignments, hence following people they know rather than sticking to issues. We also find evidence that <b>lobbyists</b> that have issue expertise earn a premium, but we uncover that such a premium for <b>lobbyists</b> that have connections to many politicians and Members of Congress is considerably larger. ...|$|R
