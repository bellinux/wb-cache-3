[...] Furthermore, this perception also explains the traditional [...] "exclusion of women from combat", while furthering the myth [...] "that military service is the fullest expression of masculinity." [...] This has troubling implications for the continuation of war, and for the enshrinement of masculine norms. Hooper also ideates about the instillation of militarized masculinity in boys, discussing how military service is a [...] "rite of passage" [...] for young men. As such, [...] "war and the military represent one of the major sites where hegemonic masculinities" [...] are formed and enshrined.|$|R

50|$|Act 1PrologueA {{garden at}} the English court in May. The guide and chorus portray England in an {{encroaching}} Ice Age. The prime minister {{suggests that it}} would be a good time for the prince to choose a wife, for which purpose he presents the two Carolines and the two Annes.Scene 1The Carolines and Annes introduce themselves and sing of their identical purposes: to become the prince’s wife.Scene 2The prince is concerned by the strange nature of the spring, but the prime minister brushes aside his worries and tells him to make the most of his youth and select a bride. The prince decides to assume power, ordering his fleet away from the English Channel, where it had been breaking up the advancing ice, and plans to march to France, crossing the frozen sea. With him he will take parliament (in the form of a giant cannon) and the four suitors. When the prime minister expresses fears about war, the prince makes the prime minister’s office hereditary.Scene 3The four girls prepare to set off, Caroline with the Mane believing that she will soon marry the prince. The Nice Caroline realises that the Caroline with the Mane is mentally unstable and persuades the others to humour her.Scene 4A bridge of ice firm enough to carry an army covers the Channel; the girls cross it as their country is submerged by the ice. The take with them no souvenirs except their memories. During the march the prince and prime minister become friends - the prime minister the prince’s friend, the prince, the prime minister’s King.Act 2Scene 5 Arriving at the French coast, the Caroline with the Mane awaits the King and her marriage, while the other ladies sing to her with barely concealed sarcasm and eroticism. The king is however being married to a German princess; the others comfort Caroline with the Mane, saying the king will arrive soon.Scene 6As they march through the north of France, the prime minister remarks that the army’s route near to Crecy follows that of King Edward III. The prime minister criticises the King’s economic policy (the crown and the queen have been pawned) and his adventurism, fearing a repeat of the Hundred Years War. The King points out France’s allies in the forest - the King of Bohemia and mercenary Genoese crossbowmen, singing as they march on Crecy.Scene 7Battle of Crécy. When he sees that the Genoese are in his own army’s way, the French king orders their slaughter. The battle is won thanks to a blast from the English parliamentary cannon fired by the prime minister.Scene 8Now dead, the Genoese and the King of Bohemia march to Paris. An English archer drunkenly drags in a French prisoner whom he leaves with the Carolines and Annes for them to look after. The prime minister proposes setting off for Paris, but the King prefers as target the fortified city of Calais.Act 3Scene 9Autumn, with the English laying siege to Calais. When the English archer asks to be discharged so he can go to Paris for the winter, the King orders that his back be flayed and the de-commission signed on his skin; when he pleads to retract his request the archer’s ears are cut off, and the King threatens even his tongue if he does not keep quiet.Scene 10At night, Caroline with the Mane, descending further into madness, cares for the wounded archer, but spurns his advances. Scene 11The next morning after a night of vivid dreams: the King shows increasing interest in the Nice Caroline, while the archer has spent the night shackled to the Caroline with the Mane. As the two Annes argue, the King’s angers boils over: power is making him ruthless and miserable. The girls attempt to calm him; the Nice Caroline sings of woman’s role as <b>life</b> <b>giver</b> and preserver.Scene 12The young prime minister has inherited the office from his father and presents his secretary, and chronicler, Froissart. The frail and weak have been sent out of Calais and they cry out as they starve in the moat. The King promises that he will spare them and the town if six burghers plead for mercy from him, barefoot and only wearing their shirts.Scene 13Enough money has been found to redeem the Queen from the pawnbroker for the King’s birthday; the ladies dress themselves. The Queen enters and the guide announces the surrender of Calais; six burghers arrive before the royal party. Accusing the peasants of treachery, they show the King the English archer’s severed head. The King orders their death, but after Caroline with the Mane and the Queen beg him to relent he makes the burghers members of the War Tribunal. The King wants to conquer Paris, imprison the French king and then march south for the new wine. He tells the Nice Caroline that he loves her. The king accuses the King of France of having broken the law of war by attacking in the rain when the bowstrings of the English archers were too slack. As the king calls for the French king’s back to be flayed, the English archer sings the praises of his judgment. The march south starts with enthusiasm, and the wings of cranes are heard flying northwards. A storm breaks but the group continue into a gale. Froissart asks the king to read his story, but is rebuffed: the king has had no part in History - it was shaped by Time.|$|E
40|$|People of all races, {{cultures}} and religious backgrounds share {{the need for}} public places which allow for human interaction and self expression. Unfortunately, in Istanbul, a city of twelve million people where public space has historically {{been associated with the}} mosque, historical precedents for secular public places such as this do not exist. Since the decline of {{the role of religion in}} social and governmental settings, the mosque courtyard has become primarily a place for ablution, and has lost its quality for gatherings. Yet, today, the city fabric has not changed to accommodate for the space which the mosques provided long ago. As a result, there is a great need for the improvement of public space, and for the making of new public gathering places in Istanbul. This thesis explores the introduction of a public open space into one of the unused sections of the waterfront in Istanbul, and the site for this project is that of the old loading docks and warehouses located across from the Tophane Museum [...] the historic Ottoman Artillery. The proposed plaza is located at a crossing of many transportational and recreational paths accentuated by the design. As a result the place becomes a nodal point. Self expression and play are the guiding forces behind the program which revolves around a big pool, full of activities, which recognizes water as the <b>life</b> <b>giver</b> to the city of Istanbul. by Rukiye Devres.

5000|$|Theravada Buddhism in Thailand {{emphasizes}} the importance of giving alms (merit making) without any intention of return (a pure gift), which is best accomplished according to doctrine, through gifts to monks and temples. The emphasis is on the selfless gifting which [...] "earns merit" [...] (and a future better <b>life)</b> for the <b>giver</b> rather than on the relief of the poor or the recipient on whom the gift is bestowed. Bowie's research among poorer Thai farmers shows, however, that this ideal form of gifting is limited to the rich who have the resources to endow temples, or sponsor the ordination of a monk. Monks come from these same families, hence the doctrine of pure gifting to monks has a class element to it. Poorer farmers place much less emphasis on merit making through gifts to monks and temples. They equally validate gifting to beggars. Poverty and famine is widespread amongst these poorer groups, and by validating gift-giving to beggars, they are in fact demanding that the rich see to their needs in hard times. Bowie sees this {{as an example of a}} moral economy (see below) in which the poor use gossip and reputation as a means of resisting elite exploitation and pressuring them to ease their [...] "this world" [...] suffering.|$|R
40|$|Water is {{not merely}} (H 20) Chemical substance, "Water is a living thing, hence it is aspects may be deep and serene and smooth; it may be vast and ocean-like, winding and circling. It may be oily and shiny, may spout like a fountain, {{shooting}} and splashing; it may come from a place rich in springs and may flow a far. It may form water falls rising up against the sky or dashing down to the deep earth, it may delight, the fishermen, making the trees and grass joyful, it may be charming {{in the company of}} mist and clouds or gleam radiantly, reflecting the sunlight in the valley. Such are the living aspects of water. " (Moore. C, 1995,p. l 7) In essence of the above quotation, Water is the medium of creating life of- one cell to a complex human being. Observing the physical nature of water we can identify the entirely different categories. It means that, it can be vapor liquid or ice. Hence the pattern of the water is different. It can be flowing, suddenly falling down, sometimes create water waves, sometimes calm and reflective. "The presence of water, thus gives identity to the land and the legend of the changeable thing. So it expresses different qualities. In steam it can be cloud or mist, invisible or visible. As a liquid it can be sea, river, waterfall or man made channel or lake. Deluge presents the 'lost ofplace' as a great flood. Although it is the opposite of the place, water belongs intimately to living reality. As a fertilizer it even becomes a symbol of life. " (Norberg-Schultz, 1984,p. 27) Considering the above observation it cannot be categorized as an unimportant material. Because it not only important as a <b>life</b> <b>giver</b> but also important to human reactions. Especially the human movement creates by water allover the history, such as creating human settlement and parallel movement because of the leaner form of water. Considering the architectural creations, it also bound with movement of human being. If the movement is strong and it is bound with the environment can be defined as a great architecture. Water is contain two third of the world. It is available every where as a natural resource. We can clearly identify these two can engage together smoothly. Because water has vast expressive rang. So it is most powerful element acting as a creator of imagination and because of that creation of human movement. But now a day in architecture field most probably doesn't use this powerful water for enhancing specially the interconnection of spaces. It is in hidden in the field of architecture...|$|E
