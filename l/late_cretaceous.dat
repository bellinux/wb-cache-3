5|$|Argon-argon radiometric dating {{indicates}} that the Kaiparowits Formation was deposited between 76.1 and 74.0million years ago, during the Campanian stage of the <b>Late</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> period.

Several important records have been generated using samples from these cores, but the stratigraphy has remained outdated and confusing. Here we revise the stratigraphy at Site 577. This includes refining several age datums, realigning cores in the depth domain, and placing all stratigraphic markers on a current time scale. The work provides a template for appropriately bringing <b>latest</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> and Paleogene data sets at old drill sites into current paleoceanographic literature for this time interval. While the Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) lies within core gaps at Holes 577 * and 577 A, the sedimentary record at the site holds other important events and remains crucially relevant to understanding changes in oceanographic conditions from the <b>latest</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> through early Paleogene...|$|R

5|$|Since Ankylosaurus {{and other}} <b>Late</b> <b>Cretaceous</b> North American ankylosaurids grouped with Asian genera (in a tribe the authors named Ankylosaurini), Arbour and Currie {{suggested}} that earlier North American ankylosaurids had gone extinct {{by the late}} Albian or Cenomanian ages of the Middle Cretaceous. Ankylosaurids thereafter recolonised North America from Asia during the Campanian or Turonian ages of the <b>Late</b> <b>Cretaceous,</b> and diversified there again, leading to genera such as Ankylosaurus, Anodontosaurus, and Euoplocephalus. This explains a 30 million year gap in the fossil record of North American ankylosaurids between these ages.|$|E
