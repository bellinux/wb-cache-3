His wife, Margareta, helped him a lot with the grinding besides the household work. Once Johansson had demonstrated his set at Carl Gustaf, his employer provided time and resources for him to develop the idea. Johansson was granted his first Swedish patent on 2 May 1901, SE patent No. 17017, called [...] "Gauge Block Sets for Precision Measurement". Johansson formed the Swedish company CE Johansson AB (also known as 'CEJ') on 16 March 1917.|$|E
5000|$|When {{there is}} a {{requirement}} to lap very small specimens (from 3" [...] down to a few millimetres), a lapping jig {{can be used to}} hold the material while it is lapped (see Image 3, <b>Lapping</b> <b>machine</b> and retention jig). A jig allows precise control of the orientation of the specimen to the lapping plate and fine adjustment of the load applied to the specimen during the material removal process. Due to the dimensions of such small samples, traditional loads and weights are too heavy as they would destroy delicate materials. The jig sits in a cradle on top of the lapping plate and the dial {{on the front of the}} jig indicates the amount of material removed from the specimen.|$|E

Referring to the second picture again, the lap is the large circular disk on the top of the machine. On top of the lap are two rings. The workpiece would be placed inside one of these rings. A weight would then be placed on top of the workpiece. The weights can also be seen in the picture along with two fiber spacer disks that are used to even the load.|$|E

40|$|Lapping {{process is}} {{characterized}} by its low speed, low pressure, and low material removal. It’s carried out by applying loose abrasive grains between work and lap surfaces, and causing a relative motion between them resulting in a finish of multi-directional lay. The grains activities in the working gap cause temperature rise of lap plate. In their work Bulsara and others studied the heat generated during lapping and polishing. They developed a moving heat source model to estimate the maximum and average temperature rise of abrasive-workpiece contacts. The heat generated at this contact was taken {{as a product of}} the friction force and the relative sliding velocity between abrasive and work surface. The model verification showed that real lap plate temperature rise was different from calculated. This work presents the results of lapping plate temperature rise research. The investigation has been conducted to check the influence of <b>lapping</b> <b>machine</b> on temperature rise. It was made during flat lapping with use of ABRALAP 380 <b>lapping</b> <b>machine</b> and thermographic camera V- 20 II produced by VIGO System SA. The <b>lapping</b> <b>machine</b> executory system consists of three conditioning rings. Lapping plate temperature was measured during machine’s work without, with one, two and three rings.

Several mats were made by carding and needle punching {{in order to have}} a compact and well entangled mat suitable for reinforcement. The speed of the cross <b>lap</b> <b>machine,</b> the frequency of needle punching, the number of times the mat goes through needle punching, the feeding rate of the carded fiber and the depth of needle penetration determined the level of en-tanglement of the Lyocell fiber which ultimately increased the mechanical properties of the fiber. The good mechanical properties of the carded Lyocell fiber made it a renewable and environmen-tally friendly alternative as reinforcement in composite manufacturing. Compared with other jute fiber reinforced composites, the mechanical properties of the resulting Lyocell composites were found to be better. Regenerated cellulose fiber (Lyocell) composites were environmentally friendly and the mechanical properties were comparable to those of natural fibers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A doubled-sided <b>lapping</b> <b>machine</b> of {{grinding}} stone manufactured of a SiC as an abrasive, specific resin and other thermosetting resin were developed for grinding {{process of the}} substrate of hard disk drive (HDD) made up of aluminum since the conventional <b>lapping</b> <b>machine</b> cause the serious quality problem of the magnetic substrate. However, at certain parameter during the grinding process, the abrasive stone was clogging due to the agglomeration of debris from the substrate which cause scratches on the magnetic substrates and affect its performance. The samples were classified into four parts (soft spot, border spot, hard spot, and unused spot). Characterizations of the samples were done using XRF, SEM and FTIR analysis. Based on all the above analysis, it can conclude that the porosity of the stone were not homogeneous {{and the percentage of}} Al was highest at the border spot which shows that, the area at the border spot cause the clogging to occur thus produces the hard spot that will damage the magnetic substrate during grinding process...|$|E

Kinematics of lapping has {{the main effect}} on the flatness of active plane of the lapping tools {{as well as on}} the quality and flatness of the machined surface. Lapping machines can be used for grinding without the chuck-related problems as encountered in conventional surface grinding. The configuration of a conventional single-disk <b>lapping</b> <b>machine</b> was modified and the rotational velocity of a workpiece holder can be precisely controlled by a stepper motor. Two types of tools were used for experiments on a modified machine. The first tool was equipped with grinding inserts made of resin and synthetic diamond micrograins (grit size 3 / 2 µm). In the second stage of experiments the single-layer electroplated diamond tool (D 107 – grit size 106 / 90 µm) was applied.

40|$|Abstract—This paper aims {{to improve}} a fine lapping process of {{hard disk drive}} (HDD) <b>lapping</b> <b>machines</b> by {{removing}} materials from each slider together with controlling the strip height (SH) variation to minimum value. The standard deviation is the key parameter to evaluate the strip height variation, hence it is minimized. In this paper, a design of experiment (DOE) with factorial analysis by twoway analysis of variance (ANOVA) is adopted to obtain a statistically information. The statistics results reveal that initial stripe height patterns affect the final SH variation. Therefore, initial SH classification using a radial basis function neural network is implemented to achieve the proportional gain prediction.

40|$|Two {{types of}} HIPed Si 3 N 4 bearing ball blanks with {{different}} surface hardness and fracture toughness were lapped under various loads, speeds, and lubricants using a novel eccentric <b>lapping</b> <b>machine.</b> The lapped surfaces were examined by optical microscope and SEM. The experimental {{results show that}} the material removal rate for type I ball blanks were 3 - 4 -fold of type 2 in most cases. Different lapping fluids affected the material removal rate at lower lapping loads, but they had much less influence on the material removal rate at higher lapping loads. The SEM micrographs reveal that the grain pullout prevailed on the lapped surface of type I ball blanks, and the surface of type 2 featured bulk material removal by microcracking. Under extreme high lapping load, surface cracks and damages were found, and SEM with EDX disclosed steel from the lapping plate had transferred to the ceramic ball surface. The preliminary conclusion is that the material removal mechanism during the lapping process of silicon nitride balls using this eccentric <b>lapping</b> <b>machine</b> is mainly mechanical abrasive wear. Lawn and Wilshaw's indentation model on brittle materials is used to explain the difference in material removal rate for the two types of ball blanks...|$|E
40|$|The {{finishing}} process of advanced ceramic balls {{can be divided}} into two steps. The first step is lapping in which most of the stock from the ball is removed at a higher material removal rate. The second step is polishing in which the required ball surface roughness, roundness, dimensional and geometric accuracy are achieved. In polishing, the abrasive particle size is ≤ 1 μm, and the load and speed are lower than lapping. A novel eccentric <b>lapping</b> <b>machine</b> is used for polishing HIPed (Hot Isostatically Pressed) silicon nitride balls. In the initial polishing stage, the polishing load is demonstrated most influential in the reduction of surface roughness value Ra. However, in the later polishing stages, the erosive process {{played a major role in}} the further reduction of Ra, although the high roughness peaks cannot be removed by erosive process alone. Experimental results also show that in order to achieve desired surface roughness value, the initial surface quality of the upper plate should be reasonably high, and deep scratches should be avoided to leave on the ball surface in previous lapping process. The best polishing results achieved were surface roughness values of Ra of 0. 003 μm and rms (Rq) of 0. 004 μm, ball roundness of 0. 08 0. 09 μm. This proves the novel eccentric <b>lapping</b> <b>machine</b> is suitable for polishing advanced ceramic balls as well...|$|E

40|$|<b>Lapping</b> <b>machines</b> {{are used}} in a hard disk rough lapping process where a {{workpiece}} (a wafer row bar) is locked with a robot arm and rubbed on a lap plate. In this process, the lap plate’s condition and lifetime are among important concerned factors. The lifetime can be too short due to the plate being accidentally scratched by the workpiece during lapping. This problem leads to undesired consequences such as machine downtime and excessive plate material usage. This paper presents an experimental investigation into vibration characteristics of passed and failed lapping scenarios and discusses a potential solution to minimize the serious damage so-called “plate scratch” which intermittently occurs in such process. The experimental results show that, by in situ monitoring vibration and utilizing artificial intelligence, damage minimization can be possible...|$|R
