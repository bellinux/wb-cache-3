5|$|Elements of {{the canvas}} refer to Grünewald's c. 1512–16 Isenheim Altarpiece and Peter Paul Rubens's c. 1612–14 Descent from the Cross. According to the art critic Hugh Davies, the open mouth of the victim and the {{predator}} leaning over the cross link the painting to Rubens' Descent. The mouth in Rubens' painting is loosely opened, but in Bacon's it is taut. The main figure's legs are folded out of view and the figure's left arm is passive in Rubens' painting, but in the Bacon's painting the chimera's <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> <b>arms</b> are in violent motion, seemingly wildly flailing up and down.|$|E

As gameplay progresses, new {{sections of the}} level open, which give players access to upgraded weapons and abilities. Franchise characters are used in Escalation, while players can customize one of four character classes—Scientist, Infiltrator, Destroyer, and Titan—in competitive multiplayer. Autobot and Decepticon Transformers can be customized with parts earned through a ranking system or purchased through the game's marketplace. Several parts from famous Transformers can be used, such as heads, torsos, <b>legs,</b> <b>and</b> <b>arms.</b> Hundreds of pieces and color options are available. Players can also buy and upgrade their gear.|$|E
5|$|Taken together, the {{injuries}} {{appear to be}} a combination of battle wounds, which were the cause of death, followed by post-mortem humiliation wounds inflicted on the corpse. The body wounds show that the corpse had been stripped of its armour, as the stabbed torso would have been protected by a backplate and the pelvis would have been protected by armour. The wounds were made from behind on the back and buttocks while they were exposed to the elements, consistent with the contemporary descriptions of Richard's naked body being tied across a horse with the <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> <b>arms</b> dangling down on either side. There may have been further flesh wounds not apparent from the bones.|$|E

5|$|The first {{symptoms}} of Guillain–Barré syndrome are numbness, tingling, and pain, {{alone or in}} combination. This is followed by weakness of the <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> <b>arms</b> that affects both sides equally and worsens over time. The weakness can take half a day to over two weeks to reach maximum severity, and then becomes steady. In one in five people, the weakness continues to progress {{for as long as}} four weeks. The muscles of the neck may also be affected, and about half experience involvement of the cranial nerves which supply the head and face; this may lead to weakness of the muscles of the face, swallowing difficulties and sometimes weakness of the eye muscles. In 8%, the weakness affects only the legs (paraplegia or paraparesis). Involvement of the muscles that control the bladder and anus is unusual. In total, about a third of people with Guillain–Barré syndrome continue to be able to walk. Once the weakness has stopped progressing, it persists at a stable level ("plateau phase") before improvement occurs. The plateau phase can take between two days and six months, but the most common duration is a week. Pain-related symptoms affect more than half, and include back pain, painful tingling, muscle pain and pain {{in the head and neck}} relating to irritation of the lining of the brain.|$|E

25|$|A {{receiving}} woman's <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> <b>arms</b> {{are generally}} {{free to move}} about, though her position and movement may be constrained by the penetrating partner's weight and in some other way. A woman can adjust the position of her legs for comfort, variety and to control the angle and depth of penetration. Generally, the higher a woman's legs, the deeper is the penetration. When the legs are raised in any way, the woman has less control of the rhythm of thrusts. Also, raising the legs raises the woman's pelvis, reduces the angle of penetration, and lowers the level of clitoral stimulation.|$|E
25|$|In Ancient Egypt, peoples worshipped several dwarf deities, {{the most}} {{important}} of which was Bes. His cult is archaeologically attested since the 12th Dynasty (c. 19911802 BC). The cult is thought to have originated in Nubia, modern day Sudan. Bes was the god of dreams, luck, dancing, and he was the protector of the household and its belongings. He was also a god of birth and was worshipped in birth houses alongside the goddess Heqet. Bes is always depicted with a normal torso and head, shortened <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> <b>arms</b> and with the ears of a lion. His most unmistakable feature is his frontal depiction, rather rare in Ancient Egypt, making Bes particularly recognizable (and probably pointing to a foreign origin for his cult).|$|E

Other signs include change in voice, making it weak, hoarse, or high-pitched; atrophy of gonads, leading to reduced fertility; bilateral cataracts (clouding of lens); premature arteriosclerosis (thickening and loss of elasticity of arteries); calcinosis (calcium deposits in blood vessels); atherosclerosis (blockage of blood vessels); type 2 diabetes; loss of bone mass; telangiectasia; and malignancies.

Shin-daiko emphasizes a more powerful sound, and consequently, performers use larger bachi made out of stronger wood.
