500|$|McKenzie campaigned energetically to {{have some}} of her female {{trainees}} accepted into the Air Force and Navy as telegraphists. She encountered a great deal of official resistance. In 1940 she wrote to the Minister of the Navy, former Prime Minister WM (Billy) Hughes, saying [...] "I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> the services of our Signalling Corps, if not acceptable as telegraphists then at least as instructors."

50|$|Quizquiz is a Quechua term, {{which stands}} for leader or Little Bird par excellence. According to some authors instead, the surname means barber and derives from his duty to shave the King Huayna Capac that the General had exercised, both for dexterity, both for total {{confidence}} {{that it would not}} have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> his throat <b>to</b> anyone else.|$|R
2500|$|During {{the holiday}} season, after the regular finale {{there is a}} special Holiday finale tag {{originally}} from Holiday IllumiNations following the regular production.

[...] The song [...] "Let There Be Peace On Earth" [...] is played as the Earth Barge returns to its original closed look. Once closed, the barge's display shows the message “Peace on Earth, Good Will to Men" [...] in multiple languages. When a language corresponding to a specific pavilion is spoken, that pavilion lights up. Once the final pavilion, The American Adventure, lights up, Walter Cronkite says, [...] The song continues with an uninterrupted firework display, ending with a loud explosion of fireworks. [...] This tag launches just as many pyrotechnic devices as IllumiNations: Reflections of Earth does.|$|E

50|$|Baitie {{writes for}} preteens {{as well as}} older teenagers. She visits schools and has worked with organisations like the Young Educators Foundation to promote reading and books. She <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> her readers {{excitement}} {{and a chance to}} escape into a different world, choosing not to emphasise themes of poverty and disadvantage in her books, unlike some other young people's literature in Ghana. In both The Twelfth Heart and The Dorm Challenge the theme of friendship is explored through the central character of Mercy, a girl who leaves her small village behind and meets new people at boarding school.|$|R
60|$|He {{began to}} gather up his {{belongings}} while he followed the movements of Mr. Triscoe with a wistful eye. He would have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> his lower berth to this senior of his, when he saw him arranging to take possession of the upper; {{but he did not}} quite know how to manage it. He noticed that as the other moved about he limped slightly, unless it were rather a weary easing of his person from one limb to the other. He stooped to pull his trunk out from under the berth, and Burnamy sprang to help him.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, for the rest.

6000|$|... "He is {{negotiating}} with the Jew, I suppose," [...] replied De Bracy, coolly; [...] "probably the howls of Isaac have drowned the blast of the bugle. Thou mayst know, by experience, Sir Brian, that a Jew parting with his treasures on such terms as our friend Front-de-Boeuf is <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer,</b> will raise a clamour loud enough {{to be heard over}} twenty horns and trumpets to boot.

60|$|Jerry Muskrat {{was more}} and more sure that his big cousin, Paddy the Beaver, didn't know quite so much as he might about house-building. Jerry would have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> some suggestions, but he didn't quite dare. You see, he was very anxious not to displease his big cousin. But {{he felt that he}} simply had got to speak his mind to someone, so he swam across to where he had seen Peter Rabbit almost every night since Paddy began to build. Sure enough, Peter was there, sitting up very {{straight}} and staring with big round eyes at the platform of mud and sticks out in the water where Paddy the Beaver was at work.|$|R
