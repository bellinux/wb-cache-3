He chooses to <b>leave</b> <b>out</b> of loyalty to Bhagavan and heads to Palasa, the village of Sandhya where Sandhya's brother Ashok (Subbaraju) is a valiant and kind-hearted cop. He comes across S. I. Paparayudu (Brahmanandam), and he solves the {{problems}} of the village by cleverly using Paparayudu. Jaidev cannot hide the truth from Sandhya anymore. Jaidev tells Sandhya about his life in Kolkata. Jaidev tells Sandhya that he made it look like that Paparayudu solved the problems of village. Since Jaidev told the truth, Sandhya still loves him.|$|E
5|$|Carrie {{had told}} me in an earlier writing {{appointment}} that she was expecting this album to have darker tones than any of her earlier records. So I remember sitting at the piano while writing the song thinking that if Carrie really wanted something dark, this was what she was after. Carrie really got into the story and making sure we didn't give away how the two women {{got rid of the}} man the song is about. This kind of song is really tricky because you need enough detail to tell the story and keep it interesting without it becoming so graphic that it's unpleasant to listen to more than once. I think we managed to pull that off. Either way, it was certainly fun choosing which elements of the story to put in and which ones to <b>leave</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
5|$|To avoid {{problems}} with European censors, Borkon cautioned Franju not to include too much blood (which would upset French censors), refrain from showing animals getting tortured (which would upset English censors) and <b>leave</b> <b>out</b> mad-scientist characters (which would upset German censors). All {{three of these}} {{were part of the}} novel, presenting a challenge to find the right tone for presenting these story elements in the film. First, working with Claude Sautet who was also serving as first assistant director and who laid out the preliminary screenplay, Franju hired the writing team of Boileau-Narcejac (Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac) who had written novels adapted as Henri-Georges Clouzot's Les Diaboliques (1955) and Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo (1958). The writers shifted the novel's focus from Doctor Génessier's character to that of his daughter, Christiane; this shift revealed the doctor's character in a more positive and understandable light and helped to avoid the censorship restrictions.|$|E

In his Preface to volume 1, Ford, while praising Sparks' enormous volume of works, offers some sharp criticism about his sometimes questionable editorship of Washington's writings as Sparks would sometimes edit spelling, grammar, change or <b>leave</b> <b>out</b> phrases, etc. Ford made clear of his position here, that his editorship of Washington's writings would not be conducted in the same expedient manner that his predecessor sometimes employed.|$|E

25|$|Historians of {{mathematics}} have examined Cantor's article {{and the circumstances}} in which it was written. For example, they have discovered that Cantor was advised to <b>leave</b> <b>out</b> his uncountability theorem in the article he submitted; he added it during proofreading. They have traced this and other facts about the article to the influence of Karl Weierstrass and Leopold Kronecker. Historians have also studied Dedekind's contributions to the article, including his contributions to the theorem on the countability of the real algebraic numbers. In addition, they have looked at the article's legacy—namely, the impact of the uncountability theorem and the concept of countability on mathematics.|$|E
25|$|With the BLRC now {{halfway through}} the door, Britain sent a team to the Tour de France in 1955. It was the first team ever sent since the {{previous}} riders, Bill Burl and Charles Holland had competed as private entrants before the war. To turn down the Tour was something the NCU wouldn't do and yet it couldn't select riders who were BLRC members. To <b>leave</b> <b>out</b> BLRC members, however, would be to send a weakened team and antagonise a wavering UCI. Yet the BLRC could not select a team because the Union Cycliste Internationale didn't formally recognise it. The conundrum was solved by asking a panel of newspaper reporters {{to do the job}} instead.|$|E

25|$|Apart from England, Pakistan is {{the only}} other top-eight Test-playing nation not to be {{represented}} in the tournament. In February 2010, Ijaz Butt, {{the chairman of the}} Pakistan Cricket Board, had reportedly refused participation in the tournament due to the snubbing of Pakistani cricketers in the 2010 Indian Premier League player auction. The auction resulted in none of them being bought for the league. Butt later stated his comments were misunderstood, but the Champions League administrators had already decided to <b>leave</b> <b>out</b> Pakistan due to Butt's statements. Champions League officials have made contradicting statements as to whether a Pakistan team would have been considered regardless of Butt's statement. Pakistan was also absent from the previous edition due to the deterioration of relations between host nation India and Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|All {{processes}} in organisms obey physical laws, the difference from inanimate processes lying in their organisation and their being subject to control by coded information. This {{has led some}} biologists and philosophers (for example, Ernst Mayr and David Hull) {{to return to the}} strictly philosophical reflections of Charles Darwin to resolve some of the problems which confronted them when they tried to employ a philosophy of science derived from classical physics. This latter, positivist approach emphasised a strict determinism (as opposed to high probability) and to the discovery of universally applicable laws, testable in the course of experiment. It was difficult for biology, beyond a basic microbiological level, to live up to these structures. Standard philosophy of science seemed to <b>leave</b> <b>out</b> a lot of what characterised living organisms - namely, a historical component {{in the form of an}} inherited genotype.|$|E
25|$|Bach first {{performed}} the cantata on 21 April 1715. Looking at the rich scoring of three instrumental groups and a five-part choir, John Eliot Gardiner {{suggests that the}} cantata was not performed in the court's small , but in the town church St. Peter und Paul, where the ducal family evidently at times attended services. Bach later {{performed the}} cantata several times in Leipzig in a slightly modified form. There is proof of performances for the years 1724 and 1731; a further performance in 1735 is probable as well. Since the Weimar tuning of the organ, which served as a reference for the string instruments, was probably a third higher than the standard tuning tone in Leipzig, Bach had to either <b>leave</b> <b>out</b> {{the voices of the}} reed instruments or rewrite them for the Leipzig performances, or to replace the parts by different instruments.|$|E

25|$|By {{multiplying}} these modules into a grid, {{the structure}} could be extended virtually infinitely. In its original form, the ground {{level of the}} Crystal Palace (in plan) measured 1848' x 456', which equates to a grid 77 modules long by 19 modules wide. Because each module was self-supporting, Paxton was able to <b>leave</b> <b>out</b> modules in some areas, creating larger square or rectangular spaces within the building to accommodate larger exhibits. On the lower level these larger spaces were covered by the floor above, and on the upper level by longer spans of roofing, but the dimensions of these larger spaces were always multiples of the basic 24' x 24' grid unit. The modules were also strong enough to be stacked vertically, enabling Paxton to add an upper floor that nearly doubled the amount of available exhibition space. Paxton also used longer trellis girders to create a clear span for {{the roof of the}} immense central gallery, which was 72 feet wide and 1800 feet long.|$|E
25|$|A good map has to {{compromise}} between portraying the items of interest (or themes) {{in the right}} place on the map, and the need to show that item using text or a symbol, which take up space on the map and might displace some other item of information. The cartographer is thus constantly making judgements about what to include, what to <b>leave</b> <b>out</b> and what to show in a slightly incorrect place. This issue assumes more importance as the scale of the map gets smaller (i.e. the map shows a larger area) because the information shown on the map takes up more space on the ground. A good example from the late 1980s was the Ordnance Survey's first digital maps, where the absolute positions of major roads were sometimes a scale distance of hundreds of metres away from ground truth, when shown on digital maps at scales of 1:250,000 and 1:625,000, because of the overriding need to annotate the features.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} sport on campus was rowing, but it {{initially}} had no coaches or tournaments. Other sports that developed {{early in the}} campus's history were tennis, basketball, golf, croquet, and baseball. The school's football program had such a limited selection of players that faculty had {{to be used to}} fill the roster. When the college merged with the junior college in 1921, the college {{became a member of the}} Junior College Conference. After the school won most of the conference titles in a variety of sports, the league requested that college <b>leave</b> <b>out</b> of fairness to the smaller schools. For its football program, the team outscored its opponents 249 to 52 in ten games, resulting in the first sales of season tickets in 1923. From 1925 to 1926, the college played as an independent. It then joined the Southern California Conference in 1926, where it did not win a football conference championship until 1936. However, in other sports including tennis and basketball, it excelled. The college remained with the conference until 1939, when it joined the California Collegiate Athletic Association.|$|E

40|$|Background: Ambulatory 24 -h dual-channel {{pharyngeal}} and oesophageal pH monitoring is {{the standard}} test for measuring gastro-oesophageal and gastropharyngeal reflux. Artefacts caused by the intake of food may result in falsely positive gastropharyngeal reflux, which necessitates a manual review of 24 -h pH data. The {{purpose of the study}} was to investigate the influence of meals and whether <b>leaving</b> <b>out</b> meals affected the reliability of the test. Methods: Patients referred for otolaryngological complaints, suspected to have been caused by gastro-oesophageal reflux, underwent 24 -h dual-channel pH monitoring. The raw unprocessed pH data were corrected by visual inspection of the 24 -h tracings (corrected data), by <b>leaving</b> <b>out</b> meals or meals plus a 2 -h postprandrial period. Results: The raw pH data were substantially influenced by artefacts of food intake and pseudoreflux. Data obtained by <b>leaving</b> <b>out</b> meals agreed best with manually corrected data. Many of the falsely positive reflux episodes could be removed, thereby inducing a 9 %- 18 % chance of undetected reflux. When examining the fraction of time supine, manually corrected data and data <b>leaving</b> <b>out</b> meals were fully concordant and detected 79 % of patients with gastropharyngeal reflux. However, <b>leaving</b> <b>out</b> meals plus a 2 -h postprandrial period resulted in 21 %- 50 % falsely negative tests. Conclusion: <b>Leaving</b> <b>out</b> the period of intake of meals and beverages from the raw pH data might be the second best test after the time-consuming visual correction with a small chance of undetected gastropharyngeal reflux. For scientific purposes and when in doubt, it remains necessary to review the computer-generated data manually to discover every gastropharyngeal reflux even...|$|R
