40|$|Soil water {{characteristic}} curves (SWCCs) {{used for}} the design of covers over <b>mine</b> <b>wastes,</b> are typically determined in the laboratory by performing drying tests on samples in a Tempe cell. In some cases, re-wetting is also carried out. The advantage of using drying tests is that they are carried out from the saturated state at a given sample test density; so that there is some chance of obtaining repeatable results. However, re-wetting is carried out from the arbitrary end-point of a drying test, giving a different re-wetting curve from each of these points. SWCC data may also be measured directly in the laboratory and in the field. Depending on the uniformity, stress history, structure and any cementation of soils under laboratory or field conditions, their SWCC data may be very different from the SWCC data collected after sample preparation and saturation for laboratory Tempe cell drying testing. The paper presents in situ, laboratory and field SSWC data <b>for</b> <b>mine</b> <b>waste</b> covers that highlight the strong influence that structure, cementation, sampling disturbance, sample preparation, saturation, uniformity, construction control and stress history can have on the data.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to assess the arbuscular {{mycorrhizal}} (AM) status of trees currently being used <b>for</b> phytoremediation of <b>mining</b> contaminated sites in South Africa, and to determine the AM fungal diversity of these sites. The trees, Tamarix usneoides, Searsia lancea and Searsia pendulina planted on waste sites associated with gold and uranium and zinc and platinum mining were assessed in late summer and the AM fungi were identified by molecular analysis of the small subunit rRNA gene sequences from spore DNA. All trees on all sites showed moderate to high mycorrhizal colonisation levels including those from wild populations of T. usneoides growing in uncontaminated sites. The AM fungi identified fell within the Claroideoglomus, Diversispora, Glomus, Acaulospora and Sclerocystis taxa and although their species diversity was relatively low there were distinct trends in their association with the three plant species sampled. The study represents a first report of the mycorrhizal status of T. usneoides and of the use of molecular techniques for the identification of AM fungi associated with <b>mine</b> <b>wastes</b> in South Africa.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} review of heat generation in various types of wastes and of the thermal regime of waste containment facilities is provided in this paper. Municipal solid waste (MSW), MSW incineration ash, and <b>mining</b> <b>wastes</b> {{were included in the}} analysis. Spatial and temporal variations of waste temperatures, thermal gradients, thermal properties of wastes, average temperature differentials, and heat generation values are provided. Heat generation was influenced by climatic conditions, mean annual earth temperatures, waste temperatures at the time of placement, cover conditions, and inherent heat generation potential of the specific wastes. Time to onset of heat generation varied between months and years, whereas timelines for overall duration of heat generation varied between years and decades. For MSW, measured waste temperatures were as high as 60 – 90 °C and as low as − 6 °C. MSW incinerator ash temperatures varied between 5 and 87 °C. Mining waste temperatures were in the range of − 25 to 65 °C. In the wastes analyzed, upward heat flow toward the surface was more prominent than downward heat flow toward the subsurface. Thermal gradients generally were higher for MSW and incinerator ash and lower <b>for</b> <b>mining</b> <b>waste.</b> Based on thermal properties, MSW had insulative qualities (low thermal conductivity), while <b>mining</b> <b>wastes</b> typically were relatively conductive (high thermal conductivity) with ash having intermediate qualities. Heat generation values ranged from − 8. 6 to 83. 1 MJ/m 3 and from 0. 6 to 72. 6 MJ/m 3 <b>for</b> MSW and <b>mining</b> <b>waste,</b> respectively and was 72. 6 MJ/m 3 for ash waste. Conductive thermal losses were determined to range from 13 to 1111 MJ/m 3 yr.

30|$|Therefore, {{the primary}} {{aim of the}} present study was to {{characterize}} the effects of woodchips and biochar on the geochemical dynamics of tailing leachate through a column leaching experiment. The specific objective was to determine the dynamics of leachate chemistry, indicated by acidity, salinity, common toxic elements and labile C, in neutral Cu-Au tailings with and without woodchips or biochar amendment under laboratory leaching conditions over 20 weeks. Column leaching has been used as a routine approach for assessing the geochemistry and toxicity of porous materials for many years [21 – 23], and it was particularly useful <b>for</b> <b>mine</b> <b>wastes</b> as supposed to better simulate field conditions than the batch methods [24 – 27]. Despite the significant deviation in leachate chemistry among replicate columns over time [23, 28], column leaching was still thought to be a valuable approach to assess the medium- to long-term dynamics of mine tailings' toxicity and hydrogeochemistry.|$|R

Model compounds (CdO, Cd(OH) 2, CdCO 3, Cdacetate, CdS, Cdstearate, CdDEDTC) and samples {{were examined in}} solid form at 20 K. The XANES spectra showed similar E max values for both model compounds and samples. The EXAFS showed that Cd-S in CdS, gives a flatter spectrum in the extended region compared to Cd-O found with CdCO 3, CdO and Cd Stearate. Linear combination fitting with model Cd compounds did not give clear assignments of composition, indicating that more detailed EXAFS spectra is required as mineral forms containing Cd were present rather than simple Cd compounds such as CdCO 3. The Cd bond for a single shell model in <b>mine</b> <b>waste</b> sample matrices appears to be either Cd-O or Cd-S, {{or a combination of}} both.

40|$|The mining {{industry}} is a fundamental industry involved {{in the development of}} modern society, but is also the world’s largest waste producer. This role will be enhanced in the future, because ore grades are generally decreasing, thus leading to increases in the waste/metal production ratio. <b>Mine</b> <b>wastes</b> deposited on-land in so-called tailings dams, impoundments or waste-dumps have several associated environmental issues {{that need to be addressed}} (e. g., acid mine drainage formation due to sulphide oxidation, geotechnical stability, among others), and social concerns due to land use during mining.

One option used in the past was the marine shore or shallow submarine deposition of this waste material in some parts of the world. After the occurrence of some severe environmental pollution, today the deposition in the deep sea (under constant reducing conditions) is seen as a new, more secure option, due to the general thought that sulphide minerals are geochemically stable under the reduced conditions prevailing in the deep marine environment.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the metal (Ag, Al, As, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb, Zn) tolerance and uptake of Mitchell grasses when grown on waste rocks and tailings of a base metal mine, Australia. The objective of conducting such phytoremediation studies was to gain data relating to the implementation and effectiveness of capping and revegetation strategies <b>for</b> <b>mine</b> <b>waste</b> repositories in regions of native grasslands. Pot trials demonstrate that Mitchell grasses are metal tolerant and have the ability to accumulate significant concentrations of metals (Pb, Zn) into their above-ground biomass. Concentrations of metals in Mitchell grasses were evaluated in terms of maximum allowable dietary levels in livestock. The pot trial project revealed that if Mitchell grasses were to be used <b>for</b> <b>mined</b> land reclamation and were grown on tailings, the grasses could potentially accumulate large quantities of Zn in their tissue, potentially causing harmful effects on animals feeding on them. Hence, it is undesirable that Mitchell grasses are grown on and their root system come in contact with tailings with elevated level of Zn. Otherwise, the species may accumulate phyto- and zootoxic concentrations of Zn. The metal tolerance, the tendency to accumulate metals in the above-ground biomass and the significant root penetration depth of Mitchell grasses have implications for the design of tailings storage facilities. Capping of waste repositories, containing elevated metal concentrations and using a cover system without capillary breaks, clay layers or alternative strategies, may not be sustainable in the long term. The application of phosphate amendments to tailings may represent an alternative strategy to limit the uptake of metals by Mitchell grasses. The pot trials prove that the addition of phosphate to <b>mine</b> <b>wastes</b> decreases the bio-availability of metals in these materials and reduces the Pb and Zn concentration in Mitchell grasses growing on them. Thus, the addition of phosphate amendments to the top layers of metalliferous <b>mine</b> <b>wastes</b> may represent an alternative waste management strategy...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{coal mining}} and hard rock mining {{operations}} often expose iron sulfide minerals (e. g. pyritic sulfur) and organic sulfur containing substances {{to a new}} oxidizing environment.

Traditional agricultural lime rate determination methods are not appropriate <b>for</b> <b>mined</b> land situations {{where the majority of}} acid production is from the weathering of relatively insoluble minerals such as pyrite.

A precise understanding of the contaminant generation process, is a prerequisite to any successful remediation strategy, whether active or passive, but is often marginal at best. The effectiveness of wetlands which bio-mineralize nutrients and organ-ics, reduce metal acidity and improve pH has been widely demonstrated but the message doesn't {{seem to be getting}} out. Weathering {{on the surface of the}} minerals is initially a geochemical process but is then accelerated by bacteria, a biogeochemical process; this sets in motion the secondary precipitation, dissolution and hydrolysis of the weathering products, a chemical process which again is accelerated by bacterial ac-tivity, entering again the realm of bio-geochemistry and bio-mineralization. The resulting contaminant stream is generated by hydrological as well as hydro-geological processes as atmospheric precipitation transports the weathering products to ground and surface water. Once the contaminants are in the wa-ter particulate formation and surface science are dominant disciplines which need to be evoked to op-timize the treatment.

40|$|Results are {{presented}} {{for a study}} of Pb and Zn concentrations and stable Pb isotope ratios <b>for</b> <b>mining</b> <b>wastes,</b> river sediments and Pb- 210 -dated peat cores from the vicinity of a derelict Pb/Zn mine at Tyndrum in central Scotland. Mining was carried out at Tyndrum between 1741 and 1862 and the original waste dumps were reworked between 1916 and 1925. Little remains of the original buildings and workings and the contemporary distribution and dispersion pathways of the residual waste are poorly defined. The mine and ore processing waste dumps were readily identified as highly polluted, barren areas, with concentrations of up to 21 and 3. 4 % Pb and Zn, respectively. The Pb in the waste was characterised by a Pb- 206 /Pb- 207 atom ratio of 1. 146 +/- 0004 and a Pb- 208 /Pb- 207 ratio of 2. 432 +/- 0. 007. Significant quantities of waste were also found along riverbanks and in river channel sediments {{in the vicinity of the}} mine, with concentrations of up to 5. 22 % Pb and 2. 35 % Zn. Concentrations of Pb and Zn in river channel sediments decreased markedly with increasing distance downriver from the mining area. However, the decrease in Pb concentrations in the less than 53 mum fraction was less pronounced, with a relatively high concentration of 0. 076 % being observed at a distance of 6. 5 km from the mine, suggesting significant fluvial transport of this size fraction of waste. The stable Pb isotopic characteristics of the river sediments were consistent with the <b>mine</b> <b>waste</b> being the dominant source, along with minor inputs from local bedrock and vehicle exhaust emissions. The peat core data revealed high levels of Pb deposition throughout the period of the mining operation and very high levels of input in the early 20 th century, almost certainly as a result of the reworking of the former waste dumps. As with the river sediments, the isotopic characteristics of the Pb in the peat cores were consistent with a dominant input from the <b>mine</b> <b>waste</b> and minor contributions from bedrock and vehicle exhaust emissions. The results suggest that <b>waste</b> from the <b>mining</b> operation has been a significant source of contaminant heavy metals for several hundred years and continues to be so. The apparent fluvial transport of Pb from the mine site is consistent with previous work suggesting that Tyndrum <b>mine</b> <b>waste</b> is the probable origin of anomalously high levels of Pb deposited in the sediments of Loch Tay, some 25 km to the cast. The study highlights the utility of stable Pb isotope analyses in the investigation of sources and environmental dispersion of contaminant Pb...|$|R
40|$|Mining is an {{important}} human activity that creates wealth and supplies materials for maintaining standard of living and further human development. However, mining has also negative impacts {{on the environment and}} society. One of them is the production of <b>mining</b> <b>waste</b> throughout the entire mining cycle, in particular in the mine development and operation /production stage. Due to the EU Directive 2006 / 21 /EC on the management of waste from the extractive industries and its implementation in Member state, estimation on quality and quantity of <b>mining</b> <b>waste</b> from active non-metal mines in Slovenia was carried out. In the selected mines mining and processing was closely examined. With material flow analysis quantity and characteristics of <b>mining</b> <b>waste</b> were defined <b>for</b> several <b>mines</b> of different commodities. Data on <b>mining</b> <b>waste</b> were afterwards generalized in order to get an overall country evaluation on <b>mining</b> <b>waste</b> “production” of non-metal <b>mines.</b> Mining <b>waste</b> as a result of mining and beneficiation processes in non-metal mines of Slovenia is either inert or non-hazardous. Most of the <b>mining</b> <b>waste</b> is used <b>for</b> <b>mine</b> reclamation running simultaneously with the production phase. The largest amounts of <b>mining</b> <b>waste</b> per unit produced are created in dimension stone industry. Since the dimensionstone production is small, the waste amount is negligible. Large quantities of <b>mining</b> <b>waste</b> are produced in crushed stone and, sand and gravel operations, because aggregate production is pretty large with regard to other non-metals production in Slovenia. We can therefore conclude that large quantities of <b>mining</b> <b>waste</b> from non-metal <b>mines,</b> which are mostly used in reclamation and for side products, do not represent danger to the environment...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Kirki project {{aimed to}} identify, among the <b>mining</b> <b>waste</b> {{abandoned}} at a mine and processing plant, {{the most critical}} potential pollution sources, the exposed milieus and the main pathways for contamination of a littoral area. This was accompanied by {{the definition of a}} monitoring network and remedial options. For this purpose, field analytical methods were extensively used to allow a more precise identification of the source, to draw relevant conceptual models and outline a monitoring network. Data interpretation was based on temporal series and on a geographical model. A classification method <b>for</b> <b>mining</b> <b>waste</b> was established, based on data on pollutant contents and emissions, and their long-term pollution potential. Mining waste present at the Kirki mine and plant sites comprises (A) extraction waste, mainly metal sulfide-rich rocks; (B) processing waste, mainly tailings, with iron and sulfides, sulfates or other species, plus residues of processing reagents; and (C) other waste, comprising leftover processing reagents and Pb-Zn concentrates. Critical toxic species include cadmium and cyanide. The stormy rainfall regime and hilly topography favour the flush release of large amounts of pollutants. The potential impacts and remedial options vary greatly. Type C waste may generate immediate and severe chemical hazards, and should be dealt with urgently by careful removal, as it is localised in a few spots. Type B waste has significant acid mine drainage potential and contains significant amounts of bioavailable heavy metals and metalloids, but they may also be released in solid form into the surface water through dam failure. The most urgent action is thus dams consolidation. Type A waste {{is by far the most}} bulky, and it cannot be economically removed. Unfortunately, it is also the most prone to acid mine drainage (seepage pH 1 to 2). This requires neutralisation to prevent acid water accelerating heavy metals and metalloids transfer. All waste management options require the implementation of a monitoring network for the design of a remediation plan, efficiency control, and later, community alert in case of accidental failure of mitigation/remediation measures. A network design strategy based on field measurements, laboratory validation and conceptual models is propose...|$|R
