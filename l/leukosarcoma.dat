Much of the descriptive pathological work has centered about the classification of this intriguing disease; what is its relation to the neoplasms (lymphosarcoma, <b>leukosarcoma,</b> multiple myeloma), the atypical granulomata (Hodgkin's disease, mycosis fungoides), and the hyperplastic hemopoietic responses to infectious agents? In the century following the original descriptions progress has been made in the classification of the morphological and clinical types of the disease, but little more is known concerning its etiology than when Bennett and Virchow first recognlized leukemia as a distinct entity. The first step in leukemia investigations beyond the descriptive phase was made by Ellerman" 5 in 1908, when he demonstrated that fowl leukemia can be transmitted to normal chickens by inoculation of either leukemic cells or cell-free filtrates derived from the blood or tissues of leukemic animals. Subsequent investigations confirmed this pioneer work. The neoplastic nature of chicken leukemia is now rather generally accepted; Ellerman was, unknown to himself, among the first to transfer a neoplasm to a new host by inoculation of cell-free extracts of neoplastic tissues.

This review is being presented against a background of personal observations on mice of the high-leukemia F strain and on strain dba.
