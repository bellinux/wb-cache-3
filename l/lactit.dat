40|$|Characterization Of <b>Lactit</b> Acid Bacteria Indegenous From Jruek Drien, Aceh Province ABSTRACT. Jruek drien is {{traditional}} fermented Durian. The {{purpose of this}} research was to obtain Lactic acid bacteria indigenous from jruek drien for development potential probiotic. The research was conducted at Laboratory of Microbiology, Department of Biology, Faculty of Mathematic and Natural Science of Syiah Kuala University from Februari â€“ Juny 2015. Sample was taken from Aceh Jaya Regency, Aceh Barat Regency, Aceh Barat Daya Regency, Nagan Raya Regency dan Aceh Selatan Regency. The results showed that there are 9 Lactic acid bacteria indigenous isolate from jruek drien...|$|E
40|$|Catfish {{is a kind}} of {{fish that}} has high protein rate around 20 % mass that can be {{exploited}} onthe application knowledge of food biotechnology, and one of protein resources for Indonesia society. The application is as raw material soy sauce making. The experiment of soy sauce making that made of the catfish conducted by pulverizing thecatfish flesh then mixed it up with pulverized pineapple (containing bromelin enzyme) and water. Thecomparison mass is (g) :mass (g) :volume (ml) with the comparison value 1 : 2 : 1 and pH 6 - 7. All of thematerial has to be put the incubator as long as 3 days with the temperature 50 o Keywords : soy sauce, fermentation, catfish, streptococcus lactis bactery, bromelinC. The hydrolysis result added with salt in the concentration 3 % (mass/volume), 5 % (mass/volume), 9 %(mass/volume) and acidbactery <b>lactit</b> streptococcus lactis which further on separated it so it produced the fish soy saucefiltrate. The purpose of this research are to analyze the influence of salt condensation concentrationand the time of processed salt condensation fermentation by using 2 sided variant analysis method andto analyze totalize dissolve nitrogen content and organoleptic test including taste, color and scent toget soy sauce with quality. The result shows the highest protein rate is got on condensationconcentration variation of 3 % and 7 day, hydrolysis time with protein rate of 17. 95 %. While accordingto organoleptic test the sauce which is produced accepted enough by society including taste, scent andcolor...|$|E
40|$|The aims of this {{research}} were to obtained the effect of rice milk concentrate {{and the time of}} fermentation towards the characteristics of sayur asin sawi jabung as the result of this fermentation. The benefits of {{this research}} were to self life of sawi jabung and to increase the consumption of it in order to lessen the loss. The statistical designs used in this research were random group design with factorial pattern of 3 x 4 and three times reduplication. The kinds of variable that used were rice milk concentrates 1. 5 g/l 0 ml (b/v); 2. 0 g/l 0 ml (b/v); 2. 5 g/l 0 ml (b/v) with the time of fermentation 2, 4, 6, and 8 days. The analysis that used on sayur asin sawi jabung in this research ranged from chemical response, microbiology response and organoleptic response. Based on the results of the research, it was known that the concentration of rice milk gave significant effect to texture, aroma, performance, <b>lactit</b> acid content, and vitamin C content of sayur asin sawi jabung. The time of fermentation gave significant effect to the lactic acid content, solid and liquid pH, the total of microbes, vitamin C, performance, texture and the color of sayur asin sawi jabung. The interaction between rice milk concentration and time of fermentation gave significant effect towards lactic acid content of sayur asin sawi jabung. Based on chemical analysis result, microbiology analysis and oganoleptic test, best samples were obtained; which were a 3 b 3 (rice milk concentration 2. 0 g/l 0 ml (b/v) and time of fermentation of 6 days, with the content of lactate acid 0. 729...|$|E
