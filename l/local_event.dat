5|$|Berg's {{observation}} of {{local high school}} students while preparing to film the movie inspired his development {{of some of the}} characters. For example, Jason Street, the character whose promising football career is ended by a spinal injury in the pilot, was inspired by a <b>local</b> <b>event.</b> David Edwards, a football player from San Antonio’s Madison High, was paralyzed during a November 2003 game. Berg was at the game when this accident occurred; he was profoundly affected by Edwards' injury and how it overturned his life. Berg set up a similar incident in the pilot.|$|E

For the protest in Davenport, which was supported by Rock Island County Indivisible, demonstrators marched across the Rock Island Centennial Bridge to Schweibert Park in Rock Island, Illinois. 30 marchers were later photographed as a group to send to Cheri Bustos and Dave Loebsack in Congress to encourage them to impeach the president.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{security}} concerns about an assassination attempts, President Ronald Reagan lit the National Christmas Tree via remote control from the East Room of the White House in 1981, 1982, and 1983. Supporters of the Equal Rights Amendment and increased {{aid for the}} poor protested at the event. The lights on the 1981 tree suffered from faulty wiring, {{and could not be}} lit on the final night of the event (January 1, 1982). 1981 also marked the beginning of a number of changes to the Pageant of Peace. The petting zoo was canceled due to cost concerns, {{but for the first time}} each state or territory donated the ornaments to be used on their tree lining the Pathway of Peace. A request to honor Vietnam War veterans during the ceremony was turned down to keep the focus on Christmas. A new contractor, Westport Marketing Group, was also hired to manage the tree lighting ceremony. Westport changed the ceremony so that fewer guests sat on stage. This made room for more performers. Westport also suggested that more national celebrities be invited to perform as well to turn the event into a national (rather than <b>local)</b> <b>event</b> and boost the appeal to a national audience. Westport suggested even more radical reductions in the number of guests and field seating as well as elimination of the Yule log in 1982. There was also discussion of moving the entire event into the White House, but these suggestions were not acted on.|$|E
25|$|While Middlebury College {{certainly}} {{began the}} sporting craze for quidditch, an independent {{form of the}} sport originated {{in the early spring}} of 2007 {{on the campus of the}} University of North Georgia in Dahlonega, Georgia. This version of the sport uses a Flying Disk as its quaffle, dodge balls as bludgers, and a golden-yellow 'super ball' for the snitch. This form of the game (known affectionately as 'Corrigan Quidditch' after its originator, an English professor at the university who taught a Harry Potter class that term and developed the game for tournament play as an outgrowth of that course) does not call for players to hold a broom between the legs. Additionally, all of the playing apparatus is located within the playing pitch (quaffle, bludgers, snitch, beater's bats, and keeper's brooms). The two brooms are used only to defend the goals, which rise five, ten, and fifteen feet above the pitch at each end of an elongated octagonal playing field approximately 200 feet long. 'Corrigan Quidditch', as does the Middlebury version, has its own official rule book but features whimsical offenses including a 'Queensbury' (moving both feet whilst holding the quaffle) and an 'Impermissible' (which allows the offended chaser to run with the quaffle (without incurring a Queensbury offense) and make a 'try' at the goals, defended only by the opposing keeper). Play includes non-participating teams who stand around the pitch and take control of both 'bludgering' players as well as 'sending off' the snitch at irregular intervals during play to allow the seekers (who are kept secret during play) to attempt a game-winning catch. 'Corrigan Quidditch' was the form of play originally covered in the world press during that significant summer when the seventh Harry Potter book (and fifth Harry Potter movie) was released. Unlike the world-popular Middlebury version, 'Corrigan Quidditch' remains a <b>local</b> <b>event</b> still played on its originating campus.|$|E

2500|$|The hastily {{constructed}} wartime development’s {{social and}} cultural mores had {{little in common with}} Portland as a whole. [...] Vanport’s in-migrants imported their particular brands of racism from throughout the country. [...] White migrants from the South were the most vocal in opposing the degree of integration that HAP dictated for schools, buses and work sites. The Authority was largely unsympathetic to these complaints and at no time was de jure segregation imposed on any of Vanport's facilities.

2500|$|Anthony's {{work for}} the women's rights {{movement}} began {{at a time when}} that movement was already gathering momentum. Stanton had helped organize the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848, a <b>local</b> <b>event</b> that was the first women's rights convention. In 1850, {{the first in a series}} of National Women's Rights Conventions was held in Worcester, Massachusetts. In 1852, Anthony attended her first National Women's Rights Convention, which was held in Syracuse, New York, where she served as one of the convention's secretaries. According to Ida Husted Harper, Anthony's authorized biographer, [...] "Miss Anthony came away from the Syracuse convention thoroughly convinced that the right which woman needed above every other, the one indeed which would secure to her all others, was the right of suffrage." [...] Suffrage, however, did not become the main focus of her work for several more years.|$|E
2500|$|Geology was {{popularized by}} several authors. John Pye Smith's lectures {{published}} in 1840 reconciled an extended time frame with Genesis by the increasingly common gap theology or day-age theology, {{and said it}} was likely that the gravel and boulder formations were not [...] "diluvium", but had taken long ages predating the creation of humans. He reaffirmed that the Flood was historical as a <b>local</b> <b>event,</b> something which the 17th century theologians Edward Stillingfleet and Matthew Poole had already suggested on a purely Biblical basis. Smith also denounced the [...] "fanciful" [...] writings of the scriptural geologists. Edward Hitchcock sought to ensure that geological findings could be corroborated by scripture, and dismissed the scriptural geology of Penn and Fairholme as misrepresenting both scripture and the facts of geology. He noted the difficulty of equating a violent deluge with the more tranquil Genesis account. Hugh Miller supported similar points with considerable detail.|$|E
