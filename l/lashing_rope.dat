50|$|In this leg's Roadblock, {{one team}} member had to {{construct}} a balance scale from the provided bamboo, <b>lashing</b> <b>ropes,</b> and other equipment. Once {{the construction of the}} scale was approved, they had to weigh out the proper amount of wood to balance 4 large stones. Once the weight of stones and logs were even, they would receive their next clue.|$|R
5000|$|Qamutiik {{are used}} for diverse travel in the Arctic, from {{afternoon}} outings for families going sledding to multi-day hunting trips covering {{hundreds of miles of}} terrain. Most qamutiik have space for fuel cans, a camp stove and grub box, positioned for easy access, and to permit quick stops for tea and food. Other gear and belongings are lashed to the sled body, and passengers can either ride atop this load holding on to the <b>lashing</b> <b>ropes,</b> or, in the more modern versions, ride in the comfort of a [...] "box" [...] lashed to the sled, sometimes with a small windbreak or canvas cover.|$|R
50|$|Withes {{were used}} to create strong cords for <b>lashing</b> and <b>ropes.</b> They were a {{valuable}} construction tool, and were often used in place nails or bolts. Because of their strength, they were also used to create burden baskets for heavy loads.|$|R
2500|$|Some trouble {{had been}} {{encountered}} with the rudder about twenty miles upstream, and the boat’s engineer had gone ashore at Canemah {{to get some}} iron hardware for the rudder. [...] Pending more thorough repair, the rudder had been <b>lashed</b> with <b>ropes</b> for temporary use.|$|R

6000|$|... "Sagebrush Tourists" [...] these camping adventurers were called. Claire became used {{to small}} cars, with curtain-lights broken, bearing wash-boilers or {{refrigerators}} on the back, pasteboard suitcases <b>lashed</b> by <b>rope</b> to the running-board, frying pans and canvas water bottles dangling from top-rods. And once baby's personal laundry was seen flapping {{on a line}} across a tonneau! ...|$|R
5000|$|The movie {{suggested}} that Bingenheimer has {{had sex with}} [...] "scores of women" [...] during his earlier days but those relationships didn't form into lasting attachments with any particular woman. He has never married but apparently still holds on {{to the possibility that}} he'll find a woman who has the [...] "ideal 1960s vision in plastic miniskirt, Mary Quant <b>lashes</b> and <b>ropes</b> of bullion fringe." ...|$|R
60|$|Fiercer and fiercer {{blew the}} gale; a {{tremendous}} cross sea was now running, and the boat, stout and buoyant as she was, seemed every moment {{as if she}} would be engulfed in the chaos of water. Small as the sail had been it had been taken down and <b>lashed</b> with <b>ropes</b> to the yard, so that now only about three square feet of canvas was set.|$|R
5000|$|Bamboo {{scaffolding}} {{is widely}} used in Hong Kong, with nylon straps tied into knots as couplers. [...] In India, bamboo or other wooden scaffolding is also mostly used, with poles being <b>lashed</b> together using <b>ropes</b> made from coconut hair (coir).|$|R
500|$|In [...] 1938, {{two years}} before Horton Hatches the Egg, Judge {{published}} perhaps the most obvious precursor to Horton, [...] "Matilda, the Elephant with a Mother Complex", a short story by Geisel about an [...] "old maid elephant" [...] who sits on a chickadee egg until it hatches, {{only to have the}} newborn chickadee fly away from her. In 1939, Geisel created an advertisement for NBC featuring a sympathetic-looking elephant <b>lashed</b> with <b>ropes</b> and contained in a cage made of sticks, similar to Horton's situation when the hunters capture him in Horton Hatches the Egg.|$|R
50|$|Lashing is the {{securing}} {{of cargo}} for transportation {{with the goal}} of minimizing shifting. Items used for <b>lashing</b> include <b>ropes,</b> cables, wires, chains, strapping, and nets. These items are anchored to the container and tensioned against the cargo. Another form of lashing used four devices attached to the top of each corner of a container. Lashing is products and methods are governed by various authorities such as the Association of American Railroads (AAR) for rail transportation in North America, the international Maritime Organization (IMO) for ocean transportation and the National Motor Freight Traffic Association (NMFTA).|$|R

60|$|Four sailors speedily <b>lashed</b> a three-inch <b>rope</b> {{four feet}} above the deck, from the {{forestay}} round the shrouds and aft to the mizzen, hove as tight as they could get it and then fastened. While this was being done one of the mates cut {{up a piece of}} two-inch rope into several foot lengths, and gave one to each of the men and officers, including Frank and George Lechmere.|$|R
60|$|The {{wind blew}} no more {{fiercely}} than before; indeed, it was scarce possible {{it could do}} so; but they were now both utterly exhausted. During the {{hour and a half}} which they had stood upon the remains of the wreck, they had been, every minute or two, deluged with water. Sometimes, indeed, the sea had swept clean over them, and had it not been that they had <b>lashed</b> themselves with <b>ropes,</b> they must have been swept away.|$|R
50|$|After {{three years}} of inactivity, Trumbull was finally freed in 1779. Capt. Elisha Hinman {{suggested}} that casks of water be <b>lashed</b> with stout <b>ropes</b> running beneath the keel, along the port and starboard sides. When the casks were pumped out, they rose and lifted the ship just enough so as to permit passage over the bar. Trumbull then was fitted our for sea at New London, Conn. {{under the direction of}} Nathaniel Shaw. On 20 September 1779, Capt. James Nicholson received command of the frigate.|$|R
5000|$|The mast {{could be}} taken down so that the trow could go under bridges, such as the bridge at Worcester and the many bridges up and downstream. The mast was stepped in a three sided frame open at the rear but closed with an iron pin or <b>rope</b> <b>lashing.</b> From {{the top of the}} mast a {{forestay}} ran down to the bow winch. To lower the mast the pin was removed and the winch slackened off to let the mast fall towards the stern. The reverse operation pulled the mast up.|$|R
50|$|The festival's main attractions {{are three}} Asakusa Shrine-owned mikoshi that {{appear on the}} third and final day of the festival. These three elaborate, black lacquered-wood shrines are built to act as miniature, {{portable}} versions of Asakusa Shrine. Decorated with gold sculptures and painted with gold leaf, each mikoshi weighs approximately one ton and cost ¥40 million ($390,760 in 2008) to construct. They are carried on four long poles <b>lashed</b> together with <b>ropes,</b> and each needs approximately 40 people dispersed evenly to safely carry them. Throughout the day, a total of about 500 people participate in carrying each shrine.|$|R
25|$|The {{tradition}} Tongan fale {{consisted of}} a curved roof (branches <b>lashed</b> with sennit <b>rope,</b> or kafa, thatched with woven palm leaves) resting on pillars made of tree trunks. Woven screens filled in the area between {{the ground and the}} edge of the roof. The traditional design was extremely well adapted to surviving hurricanes. If the winds threatened to shred the walls and overturn the roof, the inhabitants could chop down the pillars, so that the roof fell directly onto the ground. Because the roof was curved, like a limpet shell, the wind tended to flow over it smoothly. The inhabitants could ride out the storm in relative safety.|$|R
5|$|The hasty {{departure}} from Manchester degenerated into chaos. Mechanical failures {{and a lack}} of space to turn the locomotives meant that the seven trains on the northern track were unable {{to get out of the}} station. Only three carriages—the Duke's among them—managed to leave successfully. At around 6.30pm the Duke arrived in Roby, and went to spend the night at the Marquess of Salisbury's house at Childwall Hall. Meanwhile, the remaining 24 passenger carriages were eventually <b>lashed</b> together with <b>rope</b> and fastened to the three locomotives which remained usable, which hauled this single long train, carrying around 600 passengers, out of Manchester at a speed of around 5mph (8km/h), further slowed by crowds of people standing on the tracks and by grit and mud settling on the rails.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{there was}} a scene, a last scene, which {{remained}} fixed in her mind after everything else had faded away. She saw the huge trunks of forest trees, enormous, towering trees, gloomy trees beneath which the darkness could be felt. Down their avenues shot the level arrows of the dawn. They fell on her, Rachel, dressed in robes of white skin, turning her long, outspread hair to gold. They fell upon little people with faces of a dusky pallor, one of them crouched against the bole of a tree, a wizened monkey {{of a man who}} in all that vastness looked small. They fell upon another man, white-skinned, half-naked, with a yellow beard, who was <b>lashed</b> by hide <b>ropes</b> to a second tree. It was Richard Darrien grown older, and at his feet lay a broad-bladed spear! ...|$|R
5000|$|The Chinese [...] "yuloh" [...] (from [...] ) is a large, heavy {{sculling}} oar with {{a socket}} {{on the underside}} of its shaft which fits over a stern-mounted pin, creating a pivot which allows the oar to swivel and rock from side to side. The weight of the oar, often supplemented by a <b>rope</b> <b>lashing,</b> holds the oar in place on the pivot. The weight of the outboard portion of the oar is counterbalanced by a rope running from the underside of the handle to the deck of the boat. The sculler mainly moves the oar by pushing and pulling on this rope, which causes the oar to rock on its pivot, automatically angling the blade to create forward thrust. This system allows multiple rowers to operate one oar, allowing large, heavy boats to be rowed if necessary. The efficiency of this system gave rise to the Chinese saying [...] "a scull equals three oars".|$|R
60|$|Suddenly it was night. The Barsoomian day had ended, {{and then}} the brief period of {{twilight}} that renders the transition from daylight to darkness almost as abrupt as the switching off of an electric light, and Tara of Helium had found no sanctuary. But perhaps there were no beasts to fear, or rather to avoid--Tara of Helium liked not the word fear. She would have been glad, however, had there been a cabin, even a very tiny cabin, upon her small flier; {{but there was no}} cabin. The interior of the hull was completely taken up by the buoyancy tanks. Ah, she had it! How stupid of her not to have thought of it before! She could moor the craft to the tree beneath which it rested and let it rise the length of the <b>rope.</b> <b>Lashed</b> to the deck rings she would then be safe from any roaming beast of prey that chanced along. In the morning she could drop to the ground again before the craft was discovered.|$|R
50|$|Katerina sees Sonya {{wearing her}} stockings, and spits in Sergei's eyes, and shoves him. He {{promises}} revenge, and later breaks into her cell with another man, giving her fifty <b>lashes</b> with a <b>rope,</b> while Katerina's cell-mate Sonya giggles in the background. Katerina, broken, lets Fiona console her, and realizes {{that she is}} no better than Fiona, which is her last straw: after that she is emotionless. On {{the road in the}} prison convoy, Sergei and Sonya together mock Katerina. Sonya offers her stockings to her for sale. Sergei reminisces about both their courtship and their murders in the same airy manner. Fiona and an old man in the convoy, Gordyushka, defend Katerina, but to no avail. The convoy arrives at a river and boards a ferry, and Katerina, repeating some phrases similar to Sergei's feigned nostalgia for their life at the estate, tackles Sonya overboard after seeing the faces of Boris, Zinovy, and Fyodor in the water. The two women appear briefly at the surface, still alive, but Katerina grabs Sonya, and they both drown.|$|R
50|$|Rails {{continued}} to break under the heavy banking engines and the stationary engine was brought out of retirement, and Newall’s untwisted cable substituted for the earlier hemp rope. The cable was 2.78 {{miles long and}} weighed 24 tons. Leaving Glasgow the train moved slowly to the tunnel mouth and there a chain secured to a hemp messenger <b>rope,</b> <b>lashed</b> in turn to the cable, {{was linked to the}} front drawhook was inverted. The locomotive then set back slightly to make the messenger rope taut. This of course brought the main cable up against the underside of the engine, where a pulley wheel was mounted to engage with it and prevent it from fouling. With the locomotive thus secured to the cable, the driver, advised by the foreman cable attendant, gave a whistle signal, and the Queen Street signalman then telegraphed the Cowlairs box. If and when the line was clear, the Cowlairs signalman sounded three blasts on a horn, piped down through the tunnel and the winding engine was started.|$|R
5000|$|The {{history of}} Elk State Forest {{is very similar}} to that of the other state forests in Pennsylvania. The land was {{primarily}} acquired from lumber companies during the early 20th century. Vast stands of old-growth forest had been harvested by the lumber companies during the mid-to-late 19th century. The earliest lumbering operations harvested the largest of the white pines for use in the shipbuilding industry. The tall and straight timbers were ideally suited for use as ships masts and spars. The logs were <b>lashed</b> together with <b>rope</b> and floated down the tributaries of the West Branch Susquehanna River and into the river on their way to the shipyards of Baltimore. Once the white pines were gone the lumbermen turned to the hemlock for use as lumber. Sawmills and lumber camps sprang up throughout what is now Elk State Forest. Much of the timber was floated down Driftwood Branch, First Fork and Bennett's Branch to the West Branch Susquehanna River and into the Susquehanna Boom near Williamsport. The lumber era in the area of Elk State Forest lasted until 1915 when the last raft was floated down the Driftwood Branch.|$|R
50|$|No one dared attack her {{nor could}} anyone tell how {{she might be}} {{destroyed}} until Charles, the Skipper, came the way. He anchored his vessel a good distance out {{from the site of}} the present pier and, between the vessel and the shore, formed a bridge of empty barrels <b>lashed</b> together with <b>ropes</b> and brisling with iron spikes. When the bridge was finished he kindled a large fire on board the vessel and placed pieces of flesh on the burning embers. As soon as the savour of burning flesh reached the corrie the dragon descended by a succession of leaps to the shore and thence tried to make her way out on the barrels to the vessel. But the spikes entered her body and tore her up so badly that she was nearly dead before she reached {{the outer edge of the}} bridge. Meantime the vessel was moved from the bridge until a wide interval was left between it and the last barrel. Over this interval the dragon had not sufficient strength left to leap to the deck of the vessel and, as she could not return the way she came, she died of her wounds where she was, at the end of the bridge.|$|R
50|$|The Japanese {{suspected}} the Suluks and Binadins {{participation in the}} uprising since the Suluks and Binadins {{were the only ones}} with seafearing capability and the Japanese correctly deduced that it was a naval attack which led to the buildings the guerillas had burned down. The Suluks on Mantanani Islands were subjected to multiple massacres and atrocities by the Japanese Kempeitai. After the Japanese searched the islands in February 1944, looking for a Chinese resistance member, they obtained information regarding Suluks who participated in the uprising through torture from Dr. Lou Lai. The Japanese in Jesselton then tortured to death 58 Suluk men from Mantani whom they arrested, two days after that, the Japanese then massacred two groups of Suluks, one consisting of women and men who were shot by machine gun, and another group of 4 children and 25 women who were ordered to be machine gunned by Lieutenant Shimizu, the Suluk children and women were rounded up and <b>lashed</b> together with <b>rope</b> to a Mosque, and then shot to death with the machine guns. The massacred left only 125 Suluks in Mantanani survived, while only 54 Suluks in Dinawan capable to escaped the tragedy. The Suluk houses were also burned down after they were machine gunned. The Mantanani and Suluk islands suffered immensely from the Japanese reprisals.|$|R
500|$|His {{first job}} that {{involved}} ladders {{was given to}} him while he still worked as a joiner. [...] He was asked to point a garden wall and then the gable end of the customer's house. [...] He used several short ladders, <b>lashed</b> together with <b>rope</b> and hardboard. [...] This gave Dibnah valuable experience and his employer expanded the business to include property repairs. [...] Aged about 17–18 he climbed the [...] chimney at Barrow Bridge, for a 10shilling bet. During the night he took two Union flags {{to the top and}} secured each to the lightning conductors there. The Bolton Evening News reported the incident, with a photograph of Dibnah's feat, but attributed it to the activities of students from Manchester University. At about the same time, Dibnah decided to replace the chimney stack at his mother's house on Alfred Street with one of his own design, as his mother used only one fireplace—leaving four of the five chimney pots redundant. As the single opening {{at the top of the}} new stack was only about [...] wide, the flue needed regular maintenance. On one occasion, he was cleaning the flue using a sack of bricks tied to a rope when the sack ripped open, breaking several lead pipes and flooding his mother's kitchen. After the death of his mother, the house was sold and the council placed a preservation order on the chimney, which remains to this day.|$|R

Only 125 out of the 430-strong Suluk population of Mantani survived. Only 54 out of the 120-strong Suluk population of Dinawan survived, with all the men being massacred by the Japanese. Mangolun (Mengalum), Sulug and Udar islands were also targeted by the Japanese for massacres. The Japanese slaughtered 54 people out of the 114-strong Suluk population on Sulug Island as punishment for aiding the resistance. The Suluk houses were also burned down after they were machine gunned. The Mantanani and Suluk islands suffered immensely from the Japanese reprisals.|$|R
5000|$|On March 21, 1947, an {{anonymous}} tipster who identified himself only as [...] "Charles Smith" [...] phoned the 122nd Police Precinct and insisted {{there was a}} dead body in the house. The caller claimed that the smell of decomposition was emanating from the house. As the police were used to calls from neighbors about the Collyer brothers' home, a patrol officer was dispatched. The responding officer initially {{had a difficult time}} getting into the house. There was no doorbell or telephone and the doors were locked; and though the basement windows were broken, they were protected by iron grillwork. An emergency squad of seven men eventually {{had no choice but to}} begin pulling out all of the junk that was blocking their way and throwing it out onto the street below. The brownstone's foyer was packed solid by a wall of old newspapers, folding beds and chairs, half a sewing machine, boxes, parts of a wine press, and numerous other pieces of junk. A patrolman finally broke in through a window into a second-story bedroom. Behind this window lay, among other things, more packages and newspaper bundles, empty cardboard boxes <b>lashed</b> together with <b>rope,</b> the frame of a baby carriage, a rake, and old umbrellas tied together. After five hours of digging, Homer Collyer's body was found in an alcove surrounded by filled boxes and newspapers that were piled to the ceiling. Homer was wearing a tattered blue-and-white bathrobe, his matted, grey hair reached his shoulders, and his head was resting on his knees.|$|R
