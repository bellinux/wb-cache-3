Four {{officers}} from the Brooklyn North police precinct received a tip that a drug deal {{was about to take}} place.

25|$|Very large {{radio telescopes}} on Earth were also {{listening}} to Huygens 10-watt transmission using {{the technique of}} very long baseline interferometry and aperture synthesis mode. At 11:25 CET on January 14, the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in West Virginia detected the carrier signal from Huygens. The GBT continued to detect the carrier signal well after Cassini stopped listening to the incoming data stream. In addition to the GBT, eight of the ten telescopes of the continent-wide VLBA in North America, located at Pie Town and Los Alamos, New Mexico; Fort Davis, Texas; North Liberty, Iowa; Kitt Peak, Arizona; Brewster, Washington; Owens Valley, California; and Mauna Kea, Hawaii, also <b>listened</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Huygens signal.|$|E
500|$|Winnipeg and Hamilton {{met again}} in 1962, the 50th Grey Cup, immortalized as the [...] "Fog Bowl". [...] The game {{was held at}} Toronto's Exhibition Stadium, and began on Saturday, December 1, 1962. [...] The fog rolled in {{early in the second}} quarter and became {{increasingly}} dense as the game progressed. By the fourth quarter, the players were unable to see the sideline markers and the fans unable to see the play. [...] The players were unable to see the ball in the air – kick returners <b>listened</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> sound of the ball hitting the ground – and the action was largely invisible to the television audience. [...] With nine minutes and twenty-nine seconds remaining in the game and Winnipeg holding onto a 28–27 lead, officials made the unprecedented decision to suspend play until the next day. Though the league feared that continuing fog on the morning of December 2 would force the complete abandonment of the game, it lifted in time for the contest to resume. [...] Around 15,000 of the original 32,655 spectators watched Winnipeg win the Grey Cup without further scoring by either team. It was the first title game completed on a Sunday; the Grey Cup moved from its traditional Saturday start to Sunday in 1969.|$|E

2500|$|Rayment {{moved the}} {{throttle}} forward slowly and released the brakes; the plane began to accelerate, and radio officer Bill Rodgers radioed the control tower {{with the message}} [...] "Zulu Uniform rolling". The plane threw up slush as it gathered speed, and Thain called out the plane's velocity in 10-knot increments. At 85 knots, the port engine began to surge again, and he pulled back marginally on the port throttle before pushing it forward again. Once the plane reached , he announced [...] "V1", at which {{it was no longer}} safe to abort take-off, and Rayment <b>listened</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> call of [...] "V2" [...] (...) , the minimum required to get off the ground. Thain expected the speed to rise, but it fluctuated around 117 knots before suddenly dropping to , and then [...] Rayment shouted [...] "Christ, we won't make it!", as Thain looked up to see what lay ahead.|$|E
