Alkalinity was quantified by titration. The concentrations of chloride, fluoride, nitrate, and sulfate ions were measured at the main laboratory using ion chromatography with EC detector (IC 25, IonPac AS 9 -HC column, Dionex). Total sulfide in water was precipitated on-site with 10  mL zinc acetate (2  %).

40|$|This master {{thesis is}} {{supported}} by Ericsson to conduct research on immersed <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> of electronics. By this technology, the liquid will be {{in direct contact with}} the electronics. The research begins with investigations in industrial background, literature review and theory in heat transfer. According to the knowledge from those investigations, different <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> systems including indirect, direct and immersed <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> systems are introduced. The experiment consists of three parts: air cooling, single-phase and two-phase <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling.</b> Those three parts are with the same test board with adjustable heat resources in the same geometry. In the first part, an air flow channel is used for testing air cooling, by which immersed <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> can be compared to traditional technology. In the second part, an immersed <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> system is designed and constructed with detailed explanation. Liquid NovecTM 7200 is used as working liquid. In the third part, a huge number of data has been collected during the whole process of boiling, through which a boiling curve for NovecTM 7200 has been acquired. Then comparisons between those three technologies have been made. The feasibility of immersed <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> on an industrial scale has also been discussed. Based on the experiments and analyses, a careful conclusion that electronics with <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> has a larger heat flux limit than with today’s air cooling but with some practical problems can be drawn...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} three generically similar impingement liquid coolers {{that have}} been engineered for cooling power electronics on future aero gas turbines. The thermal and hydraulic performances of the coolers have been {{compared with that of}} a commercial, state-of-the-art pin fin <b>liquid</b> <b>cooler.</b> It is demonstrated that the impingement liquid coolers outperform thermally the baseline pin fin cooler, and with significantly lower pressure drops. The impingement liquid coolers could also be easily modified to trade reduced pressure drop against higher flowrate or reduced thermal performance. A scaling model has also been developed to predict the thermal performances of the coolers for other types of coolants and flow conditions. The model has been applied for predicting the convective thermal performances of the coolers assuming hot aircraft fuel as the coolant Future work would include an investigation of alternative convective applications in which the cooling system could be systematically explored.

40|$|Abstract:-With {{the rapid}} growth of {{electronic}} technology and industry, heat flux generated in a chip of the integrated circuit nowadays becomes so large that reliable operation needs faster cooling rate than ever. Comparatively high thermal capacity in liquid makes it more attractive as a coolant than just to increase the flowing rate of the cooling air. Water definitely has the advantage but also has the disadvantage of non-dielectric property. Thus, a cold plate has to be used to contain the cooling water inside. Channels have been cut within the cold plate in order to increase the flowing passages of water within the limited space defined {{by the size of the}} IC chip. Further heat transfer enhancement could be attained by roughing the surface of the channel wall, changing the configuration of the channels in to pin structure for water flow. In the present study, the effects of swirling inflow of the cooling water on the heat transfer have been studied in order to further increase the heat transfer rate of the water cooled cold plate.

40|$|AbstractAs {{part of the}} {{development}} cooperation of RWE Power, BASF and Linde - aiming at an advanced optimised CO 2 -scrubbing technology for power plant application - the first post-combustion capture pilot plant in Germany was constructed and commissioned at the lignite-fired 1, 000  MW Niederaussem power station in 2009. The pre-assembly of the pilot plant started in October 2008 and commissioning took place in July 2009 as planned. 7. 2 t of CO 2 per day can be captured from a flue gas slipstream of the power plant downstream of the desulphurisation plant (FGD). The pilot plant comprises optimised components such as a flue gas pre-scrubbing direct contact cooler unit {{as well as a}} lean <b>liquid</b> <b>cooler</b> and an interstage cooler that both allow returning the solvent at different absorber heights. During a 6 -month campaign, all aspects of the optimised process configuration were tested using 30 %-weight MEA as benchmark solvent and the performance of a new advanced amine-based solvent developed by BASF was trialled. This paper summarises the operational experience gained and compares some of the results obtained for MEA with those of the new amine-based solvent...|$|E

The proposed battery groups to ensure the drive train will be installed directly into the locomotive engine room. In the theoretical part of the work there has been done the analysis of the electrical locomotives and electrical unit, which nowadays are used in the Czech Republic in driving of voltage controller with the integrated circuit. Then, in the chapter there is a brief description modern locomotives frequency convertor’s and rectifier’s function. The practical part of the work contains the necessary force and energy calculation for train moving on the determined rails. On the base of the received data, the design of battery groups has been done. These battery groups will work as an independent traction which insures the moving of the train on the determined rails. In the work the design, which consists of STEP-UP and STEP-DOWN convertors, has also been done. The power model and model management were created in Matlab Simulink programme. Data and graphs exported from the Matlab Simulink programm are determined for verifying convertor’s function, which {{can be found in a}} separate chapter. In addition to the proposal of the battery drive is at work also has been calculated loss of traction rectifier during normal operation of the locomotive, ie outside siding mode. For this calculation, in the conclusion is listed the theory of calculation of the losses incipient in the transistor and freewheeling diode of rectifier.

40|$|Abstract — Three-dimensional (3 D) {{circuits}} reduce communication de-lay in multicore SoCs, {{and enable}} efficient integration of cores, memories, sensors, and RF devices. However, vertical integration of layers exacer-bates {{the reliability and}} thermal problems, and cooling efficiency becomes a limiting factor. <b>Liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> is a solution to overcome the accelerated thermal problems imposed by multi-layer architectures. In this paper, we first provide a 3 D thermal simulation model including <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling,</b> supporting both fixed and variable fluid injection rates. Our model has been integrated in HotSpot to study the impact on multicore SoCs. We design and evaluate several dynamic management policies that complement <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling.</b> Our results for 3 D multicore SoCs, {{which are based on}} 3 D versions of UltraSPARC T 1, show that thermal management approaches that combine <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling</b> with proactive task allocation are extremely effective in preventing temperature problems. Our proactive management technique provides an additional 75 % average reduction in hot spots in comparison to applying only <b>liquid</b> <b>cooling.</b> Furthermore, for systems capable of varying the coolant flow rate at runtime, our feedback controller increases the improvement to 95 % on average.
