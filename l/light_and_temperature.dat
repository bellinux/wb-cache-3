25|$|Plants {{deficient}} in the IMMUTANS gene that encodes the oxidase are especially susceptible to photooxidative stress during early plastid development. The knockout plants exhibit a phenotype of variegated leaves with white patches that indicate {{a lack of}} pigmentation or photodamage. This effect is enhanced with increased <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>temperature</b> during plant development. The lack of plastid terminal oxidase indirectly causes photodamage during plastid development because protective carotenoids are not synthesized without the oxidase.|$|E
25|$|The {{foraging}} activity of Vespula vulgaris {{is dependent on}} the <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>temperature</b> of the surrounding area. Generally, if the temperature of the surrounding area falls below 2°C, the wasps will not proceed with foraging even if the temperature of the nest itself is optimal. When the temperature is above 2°C, light intensity comes in to play a role. If the light intensity is high enough, the wasps will fly off to forage. However, there is a wide variance within the species, and even within individuals what that threshold light intensity would be – i. e. when would be the best light intensity for a wasp to go out to forage.|$|E

40|$|<b>Lighting</b> <b>and</b> <b>temperature</b> are two {{important}} stimuli in sensory marketing. However, these stimuli {{have not yet}} been studied in controlled retail environments. The objective of this research is twofold: (1) to propose a methodology to infer the effect of different levels of <b>lighting</b> <b>and</b> <b>temperature</b> in a controlled environment with visual aids; (2) to test the impact of these simulated stimuli on environmental perceptions and behavioral intentions, following a S-O-R (Stimulus-Organism-Response) model. This model postulates that stimuli should influence internal responses which in turn shall have an impact on behavioral responses. This research is based on the encoding and retrieval literature as well as the literature in physics, ergonomics and environmental psychology. In study 1, we manipulated <b>lighting</b> <b>and</b> <b>temperature</b> levels in digital photographic images, using relevant cues (illuminance <b>and</b> color <b>temperature</b> for lighting; clothing and activity level for temperature). A between-subjects design experiment was carried out over 387 respondents: two simulated levels of lighting (bright cool <b>light</b> <b>and</b> soft warm <b>light)</b> X two simulated levels of temperature (slightly warm <b>temperature</b> <b>and</b> slightly cool <b>temperature)</b> X three types of stores (jeans store, bookstore, furniture store). We found that, under these simulated conditions, the participants accurately perceived the differences of <b>lighting</b> <b>and</b> <b>temperature</b> levels, as we predicted. In study 2, the same photographs were used in a within-between subjects design over 110 participants and 330 observations. We tested the impact of these simulated stimuli on environmental perceptions (stimulating and relaxing) and behavioral intentions (intention to buy and intention to spend time in the store). Both a bright cool <b>light</b> <b>and</b> a slightly warm temperature had a stimulating effect on participants’ store perception. Under those conditions, participants also increased their intentions to buy and to spend time in the store. The stimulative perception mediates the relationship between: (1) <b>lighting</b> <b>and</b> both intention to spend time in the store and purchase intention; (2) <b>temperature</b> <b>and</b> intention to spend time in the store. These results confirm the benefit of using digitally manipulated stimuli with photographs in controlled environments...|$|R

This four-story {{facility}} {{consists of}} [...] of classroom, computer labs and office space and can accommodate 2,000 students in its instructional facilities at one time. Originally constructed in 1995 as the Business Administration Building, it was renamed in 2006, Lubar Hall {{in honor of}} Sheldon B. Lubar, a prominent Milwaukee businessman, civic leader and philanthropist. Lubar is founder and chairman of Lubar & Company, Inc., a private investment firm. His commitment to UWM and higher education spans {{more than three decades}} including service as {{a past president of the}} University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents. Lubar's distinguished career of public service also includes his work as Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and Commissioner of the Federal Housing Administration. The building's original automated <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>temperature</b> controls featured a system called The Lighting Showcase by the Wisconsin Electric Power Company. It was designed to provide maximum energy efficiency for the most highly utilized academic building on the UWM campus. In addition to providing nearly 200 offices, there are three lecture halls, with a total of 785 seats; seven arc-shaped classrooms; 10 U-shaped classrooms; an Executive MBA classroom; three computer labs; and two levels of underground parking.|$|E

60|$|In the {{foregoing}} paragraphs I have strayed {{away to a}} long distance from the road to Stratford-on-Avon; for I remember no such stone fences as I have been speaking of in Warwickshire, nor elsewhere in England, except among the Lakes, or in Yorkshire, and the rough and hilly countries {{to the north of}} it. Hedges there were along my road, however, and broad, level fields, rustic hamlets, and cottages of ancient date,--from the roof of one of which the occupant was tearing away the thatch, and showing what an accumulation of dust, dirt, mouldiness, roots of weeds, families of mice, swallows' nests, and hordes of insects had been deposited there since that old straw was new. Estimating its antiquity from these tokens, Shakespeare himself, in one of his morning rambles out of his native town, might have seen the thatch laid on; at all events, the cottage-walls were old enough to have known him as a guest. A few modern villas were also to be seen, and perhaps there were mansions of old gentility at no great distance, but hidden among trees; for it is a point of English pride that such houses seldom allow themselves to be visible from the high-road. In short, I recollect nothing specially remarkable along the way, nor in the immediate approach to Stratford; and yet the picture of that June morning has a glory in my memory, owing chiefly, I believe, to the charm of the English summer-weather, the really good days of which are the most delightful that mortal man can ever hope to be favored with. Such a genial warmth! A little too warm, it might be, yet only to such a degree as to assure an American (a certainty to which he seldom attains till attempered to the customary austerity of an English summer-day) that he was quite warm enough. And after all, there was an unconquerable freshness in the atmosphere, which every little movement of a breeze shook over me like a dash of the ocean-spray. Such days need bring us no other happiness than their own <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>temperature.</b> No doubt, I could not have enjoyed it so exquisitely, except that there must be still latent in us Western wanderers (even after an absence of two centuries and more), an adaptation to the English climate which makes us sensible of a motherly kindness in its scantiest sunshine, and overflows us with delight at its more lavish smiles.|$|E
