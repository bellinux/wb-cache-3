Cow parsnip (Heracleum maximum) and broad-leaved water plantain (Alisma plantago-aquatica) are two herbal remedies which were cultivated by the Cree. [...] However, the cow parsnip {{does have a}} poisonous <b>look-alike</b> <b>species,</b> the western water hemlock, (Cicuta douglasii, poison hemlock).|$|E
50|$|The trout-perch {{has been}} found at sizes of 20.0 cm total length (TL) but the average total length is 8.8 cm. There are no {{distinguishing}} characteristics between males and females. They are overall silvery or nearly transparent in appearance with rows of dark spots on {{along the sides of}} their bodies both along their lateral line and above it. Their fins are almost entirely transparent. These fish have thick bodies with a long head, long snout, and a small mouth. They have a single dorsal fin containing 1-3 spines and 10-11 soft rays. They also have an adipose fin, similar to trout, which helps to distinguishes them from their <b>look-alike</b> <b>species,</b> the yellow perch and the walleye. Their tail or caudal fin is forked. Like most bony fishes, the trout-perch has thin, flexible plates of bone or leptoid scales. Their particular leptoid scales are ctenoid scales that are similar to the perch's.|$|E
40|$|Many {{recreational}} hikers {{have stopped}} {{along the trail}} to admire a wildflower only to wonder what, exactly, they are seeing. Wildflowers of the Mountain West is a useful field guide that makes flower identification easy for the general outdoor enthusiast. Covering New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, Nevada and Oregon, this book is perfect for the enthusiasts who has little botanical knowledge but {{would like to know}} more about the wildflowers they are seeing. Organized by flower color for easy reference, plant records include the common and scientific names, a description of typical characteristics, habitat information and distribution maps, <b>look-alike</b> <b>species,</b> color photographs, and informative commentary. In addition, the book provides a useful introduction to the Mountain West region, along with line drawings to illustrate basic flower parts, shapes, and arrangements; a glossary of common botanical terms; a quick search key; and an index. An ideal companion for hiking, backpacking, or biking, it includes stunning full color photographs that help make visual confirmation of flower type simple and straightforward. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Halimeda (Bryopsidales), a genus of calcified, {{segmented}} green seaweeds, abounds in {{reefs and}} lagoons throughout the tropics. To investigate phylogenetic, phylogeographic, and historic ecological relationships of the genus, the nuclear rDNA including the SSU and both ITS regions were sequenced. A maximum likelihood tree revealed the following: (1) there were anatomical and morphological synapomorphies for five well-supported lineages; (2) the last common ancestor of one lineage invaded sandy sub-strata; those {{of two other}} lineages established in wave-affected habitats, whereas the cenancestor of the remaining two lineages occupied sheltered rocky slopes. Yet, several species adapted to new habitats subsequently, resulting in several cases of convergence; (3) all lineages separated into Atlantic and Indo-Pacific daughters, likely resulting from {{the rise of the}} Panamanian Isthmus. Each daughter pair gave rise to additional convergent species in similar habitats in different oceans; (4) Halimeda opuntia, the only monophyletic pantropical species detected so far, dispersed from the Indo-Pacific into the Atlantic well after the closure event; (5) minor SSU-sequence differences across species and phylogeographic patterns of vicariance indicated a relatively recent diversifi-cation of the extant diversity.

40|$|Genomes {{have both}} {{deterministic}} and random aspects, with the underlying DNA sequences exhibiting features at numerous scales, from codons to regions of conserved or divergent gene order. This work examines the unique {{manner in which}} oligonucleotides fit together to comprise a genome, within a graph-theoretic setting. A de Bruijn chain (DBC) {{is a kind of}} de Bruijn graph that includes a finite Markov chain. By representing a DNA sequence as a walk over a DBC and retaining specific information at nodes and edges, we were able to obtain the de Bruijn chain genomic signature θ dbc, based on both graph structure and the stationary distribution of the DBC. We demonstrate that θ dbc is informationrich, efficient, sufficiently representative of the sequence from which it is derived, and superior to existing genomic signatures such as the dinucleotides odds ratio and word frequency based signatures. We develop a mathematical framework to elucidate the power of the θ dbc signature to distinguish between sequences hypothesized to be generated by DBCs of distinct parameters. We study the effect of order of the θ dbc signature on efficiency while presenting relationships with genome size and genome variety. We illustrate its practical value in distinguishing genomic sequences and predicting the origin of short DNA sequences of unknown origin, while highlighting its superior performance compared to existing genomic signatures including the dinucleotides odds ratio.

40|$|Several {{millions}} frogs {{captured in}} the wild in Indonesia are sold for food yearly in French supermarkets, as deep frozen frog legs. They are commercialized as Rana macrodon, but up to 15 <b>look-alike</b> <b>species</b> might also be concerned by this trade. From December 2012 to May 2013, we bought 209 specimens of deep frozen frog legs, and identified them through a barcoding approach based on the 16 S gene. Our results show that 206 out of the 209 specimens belong to Fejervarya cancrivora, two to Limnonectes macrodon and one to F. moodiei. Thus only 0. 96 % of the frogs were correctly identified. Unless misclassification was intentional, it seems that Indonesian frog leg exporters {{are not able to}} discriminate between the species. The quasi absence of L. macrodon in our samples might be an indication of its rarity, confirming that its natural populations are declining rapidly, in agreement with its “vulnerable” status according to the IUCN Red List. Our results show that the genetic and morphological diversity of the frogs in trade is much higher than the genetic and morphological diversity measured so far by scientific studies. These results underline the need for large scale studies to assess the status of wild populations...|$|E
40|$|Studies of mimicry among {{tropical}} reef-fishes usually give {{little or}} no consideration to alternative explanations for behavioral associations between unrelated, <b>look-alike</b> <b>species</b> that benefit the supposed mimic. I propose and assess such an alternative explanation. With mimicry the mimic resembles its model, evolved {{to do so in}} response to selection by the mimicry target, and gains evolved benefits from that resemblance. In the alternative, the social-trap hypothesis, a coincidental resemblance of the model to the "mimic" inadvertently attracts the latter to it, and reinforcement of this social trapping by learned benefits leads to the "mimic" regularly associating with the model. I examine three well known cases of supposed aggressive mimicry among reef-fishes in relation to nine predictions from these hypotheses, and assess which hypothesis offers a better explanation for each. One case, involving precise and complex morphological and behavioral resemblance, is strongly consistent with mimicry, one is inconclusive, and one is more consistent with a social-trap based on coincidental, imprecise resemblance. Few cases of supposed interspecific mimicry among tropical reef fishes have been examined in depth, and many such associations may involve social traps arising from generalized, coincidental resemblance. Mimicry may be much less common among these fishes than is generally thought...|$|E
