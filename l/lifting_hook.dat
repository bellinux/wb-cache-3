5|$|The European Championship was Razer's next—and final—televised tournament, {{for which}} it {{qualified}} as reigning World Champion. It defeated Dutch champions Pulveriser {{to set up a}} semi-final against Tornado. Razer's adversaries attached the anti-crusher frame used in their previous meeting in the series six grand final; the Razer team installed a revised version of the <b>lifting</b> <b>hook.</b> Tornado was the early aggressor, until Razer picked it up with the hook and dragged it towards the pit. The size of Tornado's framework made it difficult for Razer to drop it in, and the strain of lifting Tornado burnt out Razer's drive motors. Razer was immobile {{at the end of the}} match, but the result went to a judges' decision. They awarded victory to Razer for being in control of the fight, but in a split decision the team decided this was unfair and conceded to Tornado, who beat Philliper 2 in the final to claim the European title.|$|E
500|$|Reaching {{the grand}} final meant {{defeating}} the axe-wielding robot Terrorhurtz. Razer avoided the axe and lowered its arm into Terrorhurtz's polycarbonate armour panels. Terrorhurtz {{lined up for}} another strike, but Razer slid its wedge underneath Terrorhurtz's chassis. It buried the arm into its opponent, carried Terrorhurtz to the pit release button, and dropped it into the pit. Only Tornado stood between Razer and a successful title defence. After twice losing to Razer that year, the developers of Tornado had constructed a large metal frame equipped with a rotating blade. Controversially qualifying as an [...] "interchangeable weapon", {{the size of this}} framework prevented Razer's claw from reaching Tornado's chassis. Team Razer responded by attaching a <b>lifting</b> <b>hook</b> {{to the front of the}} arm before the fight. Although Razer would still not be able to pierce Tornado, it could lift it by the framework. In the battle, Tornado used its superior pushing power to slam Razer into the arena wall and the house robots. Near the end of the fight, Razer managed to lift Tornado up and push it over the pit, but the size of the additional framework prevented Tornado from falling in. After a 45 minute discussion, the judges ruled in favour of Tornado becoming the new UK champion.|$|E

40|$|The degree {{project was}} made forZetterbergs Industri AB. The company is market leading in Europe in the heavyvehicle industry, {{designing}} and building body systems for trucks. In their line of products is the <b>hook</b> <b>lift</b> called Livab, a flexible and uniqueproduct. The <b>hook</b> <b>lift</b> is often demanded by customers because its special ability tobe {{able to operate}} in situations with low roof clearance. The main operation principleof the <b>hook</b> <b>lift</b> {{can be described as}} a truck stand, laid down. There are two main versions of the <b>hook</b> <b>lift</b> Livab, AL 26 and AL 32. These are ofdifferent load capacity, 17 and 25 metric tons of gross weight respectively. The aim ofthis project was {{to try to find a}} concept that could replace the AL 26 and in turns ofload capacity qualifies somewhere in between the two existing versions. The conceptshould ideally also have lower weight and a lower build up height than the existinghook lift because of competitive advantage. The results was a FEM based analysis of different concepts to change the crosssections of the beams that make up the construction. These concepts where thencompared to each other. Also, different concepts of making the chassis mountedframe of the <b>hook</b> <b>lift</b> lighter by trying different reinforcement crosses, were analyzedin the same manner. The selected concepts was in the end, for the inner stand: "kompakt profiler insida",for the outer stand "kompakt" and for the reinforcement cross "original"...|$|R

5000|$|During the {{production}} run several modifications would be made, {{such as the}} fitting of <b>lifting</b> <b>hooks.</b> The first thirty vehicles had two more primitive periscopes on the turret roof, a Chrétien diascope on its front and simple vision slits with armoured shutters on its sides; their drivers too had to use vision slits instead of an episcope. They also lacked a silencer and had semi-circular cut-outs at the wheel plate edges. From about the 111th vehicle (or fourth production batch) onward, several changes were introduced, including the fitting of an armoured ventilator covering {{on top of the}} turret, a factory plate with the name [...] "Panhard" [...] on the nose and a new softer factory camouflage pattern with the brown and bronze green spots no longer separated by black lines. From the 270th vehicle onwards stowage boxes were constructed on the back fenders, obscuring the pointed form of the engine compartment. The last turrets produced also had a backward pointing episcope for the commander, instead of a vision slit.|$|R

It is made from three pieces of rectangular-section 13 mm-thick steel (legs) held together with a shackle, allowing connection to a <b>lifting</b> <b>hook.</b> The middle leg is square throughout its length. The outer legs are thinner at the top, flaring towards the bottom. Held together, the three legs form a dovetail shape. The lewis hole seating is undercut (similar to a chain-linked lewis hole) to match its profile.|$|E
50|$|The long {{horizontal}} jib is {{the part}} of the crane that carries the load. The counter-jib carries a counterweight, usually of concrete blocks, while the jib suspends the load to and {{from the center of the}} crane. The crane operator either sits in a cab at the top of the tower or controls the crane by radio remote control from the ground. In the first case the operator's cab is most usually located at the top of the tower attached to the turntable, but can be mounted on the jib, or partway down the tower. The <b>lifting</b> <b>hook</b> is operated by the crane operator using electric motors to manipulate wire rope cables through a system of sheaves. The hook is located on the long horizontal arm to lift the load which also contains its motor.|$|E

A hook on the tang of the blade engages with a hook on the rocker bar which prevents the blade rotating counter-clockwise. The rocker bar is held in position by a torsion bar. To release the knife the rocker bar is pushed downwards as indicated and pivots around the rocker pin, <b>lifting</b> the <b>hook</b> and freeing the blade.|$|R

50|$|The Mount Martin lift is {{an example}} of the derrick type. This type {{featured}} a boom fixed by a pivoting coupling to the bottom of a mast. The boom was held in a diagonal attitude to the mast by hinged horizontal beam extending from the top of the mast to the end of the boom. The boom swung in an arc and the <b>lifting</b> <b>hook</b> was lowered from the end of the horizontal beam. A ladder was typically fitted to the mast to permit access to the top of the derrick for maintenance purposes. Ladders could be wooden rungs fastened directly to the side of the mast or complete ladders with steel rungs and side rails. Derrick type lifts were in use by 1893. They were used mostly to load cane into main line railway wagons.|$|E
50|$|To {{demolish}} {{roofs and}} other horizontal spans, {{the ball is}} typically suspended by a length of steel chain attached to the <b>lifting</b> <b>hook</b> of a crane boom above the structure, the rope drum clutch is released and the ball is allowed to free-fall onto the structure. To demolish walls the ball is suspended at the desired height from a crane boom and a secondary steel rope pulls the ball toward the crane cab. The lateral rope drum clutch is then released and the ball swings as a pendulum to strike the structure. Another method for lateral demolition is to pivot the crane boom to accelerate the ball toward the target. This is repeated as needed until the structure is broken down into debris that can easily be loaded and hauled away. The demolition action is carried out entirely through the kinetic energy of the ball.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{assignment}} {{were assigned}} by Camatec Industriteknik AB. Camatec is a Karlstadlocated consulting company, they make everything from pilot studies to complete projects in mechanical design and calculation. They even {{have their own}} patented product, Camcoil. It is a winder for steel strips and is used for example with hardening of the steel strip. The assignment has been {{to solve the problems}} encountered by some customers within this product. The product which is relatively simple consists of a mantle which can vary in diameter by means of hydraulic cylinders The problem was that it had concurred indentations on the striped steel next to the Camcoil. This destroys the further handling of the coil. The goal has been to develop three kinds of solutions that take into account different customer requirements. These solutions have been divided into price ranges, thus low-cost, mid-cost, and high-cost. The high-cost solution has been a combination of the mid-cost-solution and a bandgrip. One wish was to simplify the existing bandgrip. The functional requirements those are set depending on the customer: • Must be able to prevent sagging, then some form of support should be available to the band at reeling. • Not allowed to weld in the mantle beneath the welded ears. • Must be able to take a band-pull at max 1 ton. • The space at the clearance on the reel should be free at the use of <b>lifting</b> <b>hook</b> (midcost, high-cost) • Steel strip with thickness 0. 2 - 1 mm is to be pinched to the reel (High-cost). • A stop for the band at pinching must exist (high-cost). The non-functional requirements that have applied for all price ranges: • Develop the simplest solution as possible. • Standard components recommend being used to reduce costs. • The solution should be user friendly and easy to maintain. The major problem has been the lack of space in the reel with the requirements of midcost solution. Due to a <b>lifting</b> <b>hook</b> to be used it has been very difficult {{to come up with a}} mechanism that would work as a support. A comprehensive concept generation has been done with a number of different concepts for each price ranges solution. The concepts have been evaluated and compared and with the help of elimination- and decision matrix has a concept selection for each price range been developed. The result for the low-cost solution is a rolled sheet metal that is overstrung on the outside of the mantle, this means when the mantle will collapse the rolled sheet metal will follow along. Mid-cost solution resulted in a mechanical lid uses mantle movement with the help of parallel rods wander vertically down and account the space for the <b>lifting</b> <b>hook.</b> A simplification of the bandgrip were made with boomerang stays, this gave more space and fewer parts. The combination of the mid-cost solution and the simplified bandgrip were the high-cost solution...|$|E
40|$|Lifting hooks may be flat-die {{or closed}} die forged or else {{made of a}} series of shaped plates. After forging and {{machining}} operations, hooks are annealed and cleaned from scale. Lifting hooks in crane handling mechanisms are used safely handle and lift the loads during the lifting operation. Appropriate solution of shape and materials of hooks enables the increase of loading capacity of hoisting machines. The inner diameter of hooks should be sufficient to accommodate two strands of chains or rope which carry the load. More often than not hooks have a trapezoidal section, made wider on the inside. The 3 -D modeling and finite element model of the simple hook is formed by means of computer-aided engineering software and directly analyzed applying finite elements.
