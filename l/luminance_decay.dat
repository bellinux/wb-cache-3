40|$|A {{photometric}} {{study of}} a commercial long decay phosphor sample was conducted. After illuminating the sample with visible light of correlated color temperature 6500 K, its <b>luminance</b> <b>decay</b> was studied. The decay of emission spectrum of phosphor was also studied. The performance of long decay phosphor for safety indication application can be enhanced by tuning its emission spectrum similar to human eye response for scotopic vision...|$|E
40|$|We report {{efficient}} organic {{light emitting}} devices employing an ultrathin phosphor emissive layer. The electroluminescent spectra of these devices can be tuned by introducing a low-energy emitting phosphor layer into the emission zone. Devices with the emissive layer consisting of multiple platinum-complex/spacer layer cells show a peak external quantum efficiency of 18. 1 %, which is among the best EQE values for platinum-complex based {{light emitting devices}}. Devices with an ultrathin phosphor emissive layer show stronger <b>luminance</b> <b>decay</b> with the operating time compared to the counterpart devices having a host-guest emissive layer...|$|E
40|$|We {{fabricated}} OLEDs {{having the}} evapd. Yb cathode and the sputtered Al cathode. Magnetron sputtering is a versatile deposition method, but the energetic particles during sputtering process {{can damage the}} underlying org. layers. We applied various process parameters to explain the role of Ar neutrals quoting the former researches. OLEDs showed almost comparable degrdn. under the discharge voltage of 300 V, but serious degrdns. were found at the discharge voltage of over 300 V and the low process pressure. The degrdns. influenced on the lifetime of OLED, and the measured <b>luminance</b> <b>decay</b> was {{much larger than the}} OLED having the evapd. Yb cathode due to the high leakage currents.

40|$|The <b>luminance</b> <b>decays</b> {{of organic}} {{light-emitting}} diodes (OLEDs) are investigated with initial luminance of 1000 to 20 000 cdm(- 2) through a scalable Coulombic degradation and a stretched exponential decay. We {{found that the}} estimated lifetime by scalable Coulombic degradation deviates from the experimental results when the OLEDs work with high initial luminance. By measuring {{the temperature of the}} device during degradation, we found that the higher device temperatures will lead to instabilities of organic materials in devices, which is expected to result in the difference between the experimental results and estimation using the scalable Coulombic degradation...|$|R
40|$|Each of the Surveyor 7, 6, and 5 {{spacecraft}} {{observed a}} line of light along its western lunar horizon following local sunset. It {{has been suggested that}} this horizon-glow (HG) is sunlight, which is forward-scattered by dust grains present in a tenuous cloud formed temporarily just above sharp sunlight/shadow boundaries in the terminator zone. Electrically charged grains could be levitated into the cloud by intense electrostatic fields extending across the sunlight/shadow boundaries. Detailed analysis of the HG absolute <b>luminance,</b> temporal <b>decay,</b> and morphology confirm the cloud model. The levitation mechanism must eject 10, 000, 000 more particles per unit time into the cloud than could micrometeorites. Electrostatic transport is probably the dominant local transport mechanism of lunar surface fines...|$|R
40|$|In the {{synchrony}} judgment paradigm, observers {{judge whether}} a click precedes or follows {{the onset of}} a light flash and, on other trials, {{whether or not a}} click precedes light termination. The interclick interval defines the duration of visible persistence. An elaboration of this method consists of two phases: In Phase 1, the luminance of a reference stimulus is psychophysically matched to the peak brightness of the test flash. Five luminance values between. 1 and 1. 0 of the reference stimulus are used subsequently. In Phase 2, a random one of the five reference stimuli, a test flash, and a click are presented; the observer judges whether the click occurred before or after the brightness of test flash reached the reference value (on onset trials) or decayed below it (on termination trials). This method was validated on 3 subjects with test stimuli whose <b>luminance</b> rises and <b>decays</b> slowly in time, and then was used to trace out the precise subjective rise and decay (temporal brightness response function) of brief flashes.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that the fast initial decay of a prototypical fluorescent polymer based {{organic light emitting diode}} device is related to the contribution that triplet-triplet annihilation makes to the device efficiency. We show that, during typical operating conditions, approximately 20 % of the device efficiency originates from the production of singlet excitons by triplet-triplet annihilation. During prolonged device operation, the triplet excitons are quenched much more easily than the emissive singlets; thus, the contribution to the efficiency from triplet-triplet annihilation is lost during {{the early stages of the}} device lifetest. The fast initial decay of the device luminance can be removed by incorporating a triplet quenching additive into the active layer to remove any effect of triplet-triplet annihilation; this yields an increase in the device lifetime of greater than 3 x and an even more significant improvement in the initial <b>luminance</b> <b>decay.</b> (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a persistent phosphor is often determined by comparing <b>luminance</b> <b>decay</b> curves, expressed in cd/m 2. However, these photometric units do not enable a straightforward, objective comparison between different phosphors {{in terms of the}} total number of emitted photons, as these units are dependent on the emission spectrum of the phosphor. This may lead to incorrect conclusions regarding the storage capacity of the phosphor. An alternative and convenient technique of characterizing the {{performance of}} a phosphor was developed on the basis of the absolute storage capacity of phosphors. In this technique, the phosphor is incorporated in a transparent polymer and the measured afterglow is converted into an absolute number of emitted photons, effectively quantifying the amount of energy that can be stored in the material. This method was applied to the benchmark phosphor SrAl 2 O 4 :Eu,Dy and to the nano-sized phosphor CaS:Eu. The results indicated that only a fraction of the Eu ions (around 1. 6 % in the case of SrAl 2 O 4 :Eu,Dy) participated in the energy storage process, which is in line with earlier reports based on X-ray absorption spectroscopy. These findings imply that there is still a significant margin for improving the storage capacity of persistent phosphors...|$|E
