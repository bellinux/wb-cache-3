50|$|Chemically {{strengthened}} {{glass is}} a type of glass that has increased strength. When broken it still shatters in long pointed splinters similar to float (annealed) glass.

50|$|Tempered glass, {{which is}} used for the side windows of most vehicles, is {{manufactured}} with an extremely high surface compressive stress and high internal tensile stress, giving it strength and durability, but also leading it to abruptly shatter into thousands of tiny pieces when it breaks. When thrown with moderate speed at a side-window, a sharp shard of the exceptionally hard aluminium oxide ceramic used in spark plugs focuses the impact energy into a small enough area without blunting to initiate cracking, releasing the internal energy and shattering the glass. However, ninja rocks are ineffective if the shards are insufficiently sharp, thrown with too little energy, or thrown against windshields, as these are made of a <b>laminated</b> type of <b>safety</b> <b>glass,</b> and therefore do not shatter.|$|R

2500|$|<b>Safety</b> <b>glasses</b> {{are worn}} {{to protect the}} eyes in {{different}} situations. [...] They are made with break-proof plastic lenses to protect the eye from flying debris or other matter. Construction workers, factory workers, machinists and lab technicians are often required to wear <b>safety</b> <b>glasses</b> to shield the eyes from flying debris or hazardous splatters such as blood or chemicals. As of 2017, dentists and surgeons in Canada and other countries are required to wear <b>safety</b> <b>glasses</b> to protect against infection from patients' blood or other body fluids. There are also <b>safety</b> <b>glasses</b> for welding, which are styled like wraparound sunglasses, but with much darker lenses, for use in welding where a full sized welding helmet is inconvenient or uncomfortable. These are often called [...] "flash goggles", because they provide protection from welding flash. Nylon frames are usually used for protection eyewear for sports because of their lightweight and flexible properties.
