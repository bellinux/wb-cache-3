5|$|Both {{lifestyle}} changes and medications can decrease uric acid levels. Dietary and lifestyle choices that are effective include reducing intake of purine-rich foods {{of animal origin}} such as meat and seafood, alcohol, and fructose (especially high fructose corn syrup). Eating dairy products, vitamin C, coffee, and cherries may help prevent gout attacks, as does losing weight. Gout may be secondary to sleep apnea via the release of purines from oxygen-starved cells.

5|$|The drug {{strontium}} ranelate aids bone growth, increases bone density, and <b>lessen</b> <b>the</b> {{incidence of}} vertebral, peripheral, and hip fractures. However, strontium ranelate also {{increases the risk}} of venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism and serious cardiovascular disorders, including myocardial infarction. Its use is therefore now restricted. Its beneficial effects are also questionable, since the increased bone density is partially caused by the increased density of strontium over the calcium which it replaces. Strontium also bioaccumulates in the body.|$|E
5|$|The most {{effective}} method of avoiding genital infections is by avoiding vaginal, oral, and anal sex. Condom use decreases the risk somewhat.

Paracetamol (acetaminophen) and topical lidocaine {{may be used to}} help with the symptoms.

5|$|Although Muraviev's attack failed, {{it forced}} the Polish {{artillery}} to <b>lessen</b> <b>the</b> {{pressure on the}} Russian Grand Battery, which was now free to support the main Russian attack on the westernmost Polish defences. By that time the Grand Battery could shell the ramparts of the second line with relative impunity, thus damaging both the defences and {{the morale of the}} crews. Polish infantrymen manning the forts were ordered to lie down behind the gabions, which minimised the losses. Soldiers in the field had no such cover, and suffered casualties. The Grand Battery also silenced some of the guns in Forts 21, 22 and 23.|$|E

5|$|Folklore often {{identifies}} a green {{sky with}} tornadoes, {{and though the}} phenomenon {{may be associated with}} severe weather, there is no evidence linking it specifically with tornadoes.

Opening windows may actually increase the severity of the tornado's damage. A violent tornado can destroy a house whether its windows are open or closed.|$|E
