Against the backdrop of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), the author - who served on the Commission - discusses five characteristics of leaders for reconciliation. Leaders need to be: <b>leaders</b> <b>with</b> a clear understanding of the issues at stake; <b>leaders</b> <b>with</b> respect for the truth; <b>leaders</b> <b>with</b> a sense of justice; <b>leaders</b> <b>with</b> a comprehension of the dynamics of forgiveness; and <b>leaders</b> <b>with</b> a firm commitment. The insights and experiences of both the chairperson of the TRC, Desmond Tutu, and the deputy chair, Alex Boraine, form the backbone of the article. [URL]...|$|R

5|$|The league {{was formed}} after the {{collapse}} of the Korean ice hockey league and dissolution of the Japanese league. It was started with the goal of promoting hockey in Asia as well as helping the various participating countries develop their hockey programs and increase their showing in the Olympics. The first season was a shortened season of only five teams, and played as a tournament rather than a regular season. Four Japanese teams and a Korean team participated. The tournament lasted just two months and each team played four games, two at home and two away, against each other. Due to the shortened tournament format, there were no playoffs and the winner was declared from the point tally. The Nippon Paper Cranes won the tournament with 39 points. and Joel Prpic from Kokudo was the assist and points <b>leader</b> <b>with</b> 25 assists and 33 points. Ryan Haruo Kuwabara, of the Cranes, was the scoring <b>leader</b> <b>with</b> 15 goals.|$|E

5|$|As Leader of the Opposition, Douglas-Home persuaded Macleod and Powell {{to rejoin}} the Conservative front bench. Within weeks of the general {{election}} Butler retired from politics, accepting the post of Master of Trinity College, Cambridge together with a life peerage. Douglas-Home did not immediately allocate shadow portfolios to his colleagues, but in January 1965 he gave Maudling the foreign affairs brief and Heath became spokesman on Treasury and economic affairs. There was no immediate pressure for Douglas-Home {{to hand over the}} leadership to a member of the younger generation, but by early 1965 a new Conservative group called PEST (Pressure for Economic and Social Toryism) had discreetly begun to call for a change. Douglas-Home either did not know, or chose to ignore, the fact that Heath had made a donation to PEST. He decided that the time was coming for him to retire as <b>leader,</b> <b>with</b> Heath as his preferred successor.|$|E

5|$|At the 2008 general election, the Fifth Labour Government, led by Helen Clark, was {{defeated}} by John Key's National Party. Following Clark's election-night resignation, Phil Goff was unanimously elected as the party's <b>leader,</b> <b>with</b> Annette King as deputy, and Darren Hughes and Steve Chadwick as the senior and junior whips, respectively. The party lost more support in the 26 November 2011 general election; its popular vote dipped to 27% – its worst-ever result under the mixed-member proportional representation system – and its number of MPs was reduced from forty-three to thirty-four. On 29 November 2011, Goff and King announced their resignations, effective 13 December. New whips also had to be chosen because Rick Barker (who replaced Hughes as the senior whip in April 2011, following Hughes leaving Parliament) and Chadwick were not re-elected to Parliament.|$|E

While the majority of the members wanted a female leader after the departure of Myhre, his supporters were perfectly aware that Folkvord could lose the nomination and a campaign was started to make him deputy leader. The main problem for Folkvord's opposition was his close ties to the Workers' Communist Party. At the convention Myhre was re-elected the party's party <b>leader,</b> <b>with</b> Folkvord and Chris Hartmann stepping in as the party's new deputy leaders. Myhre did not become a member of parliament.|$|E
