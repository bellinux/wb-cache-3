25|$|The {{history of}} the area {{can be traced back}} to 200–300 AD. A ruin of a city built by Chand Sadagar has been found in the Baghmara Forest Block. During the Mughal period, the Mughal Kings leased the forests of the Sundarbans to nearby residents. Many criminals took refuge in the Sundarbans from the {{advancing}} armies of Emperor Akbar. Many have been known to be attacked by tigers. Many of the buildings which were built by them later fell to hands of Portuguese pirates, salt smugglers and dacoits in the 17th century. Evidence of the fact can be traced from the ruins at Netidhopani and other places scattered all over Sundarbans. The legal status of the forests underwent a series of changes, including the distinction of being the first mangrove forest in the world to be brought under scientific management. The area was mapped first in Persian, by the Surveyor General as early as 1764 following soon after proprietary rights were obtained from the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II by the British East India Company in 1757. Systematic management of this forest tract started in the 1860s after the establishment of a Forest Department in the Province of Bengal, in British India. The management was entirely designed to extract whatever treasures were available, but labour and <b>lower</b> <b>management</b> mostly were staffed by locals, as the British had no expertise or adaptation experience in mangrove forests.|$|E

However, in his letter to university president Douglas Knight, Harvey proposed that “if Duke truly wishes to be fair in its dealings with employees, a disinterested third party should constitute the final appeal on grievances.” [...] The primary goal of Local 77 was to gain impartial arbitration as a way to settle disputes objectively, allowing the participation of a third party to discern final judgments.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Empirical {{studies have}} {{emphasized}} three {{important factors in}} firm-labor relationships: (a) organization costs of workers, (b) management opposition against workers' organizing drives, (c) the possibility of productivity enhancing effects due to "voice/response" reasons. In this paper the interplay of all three issues is simultaneously analyzed. The possibility of forgone productivity gains puts an upper bound on management opposition against organizing drives of the workers, even if management opposition is cost-less. Strategic gift exchange - less opposition for higher productivity - plays a crucial role. Decreasing productivity gains and increasing the firm's bargaining power <b>lowers</b> <b>management</b> opposition. The equilibrium wage is above the workers' reservation wage. ...|$|R

This was strongly felt to be demeaning by workers. Roach boasts that Port Kembla branch of the wharfies union dismantled the bull system in 1938 (Roach, 1993). Given the unskilled nature of waterfront work, the hunger for jobs, and the dismantling of union power on the waterfront under the Dog collar act, the bull pen forced workers to compete and to cultivate servile and sycophantic relationships with individual foremen. The bull system was eventually dismantled by a period of low unemployment and union power during the 1940s.|$|E
