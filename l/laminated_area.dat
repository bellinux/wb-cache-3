40|$|In retinal {{transplantation}} experiments it is {{hypothesized that}} remaining diseased photoreceptor {{cells in the}} host retina and inner retinal cells in transplants physically obstruct the development of graft-host neuronal contacts which are required for vision. Recently, we developed methods for the isolation of donor photoreceptor layers in vitro, and the selective removal of host photoreceptors in vivo using biodegradable elastomeric membranes composed of poly(glycerol-co-sebacic acid) (PGS). We also coated PGS membranes with electrospun nanofibers, composed of laminin and poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL), to promote attachment of embryonic retinal explants, allowing the resulting composites to be handled surgically as a single entity. Here, we report subretinal transplantation of these composites into adult porcine eyes. In hematoxylin and eosin stained sections of composite explants after 5 - 7 days in vitro, excellent fusion of retinas and biomaterial membranes was noted, with the immature retinal components showing laminated as well as folded and rosetted areas. The composite grafts could be transplanted in all cases and, 3 months after surgery, eyes displayed clear media, attached retinas and the grafts located subretinally. Histological examination revealed that the biomaterial membrane had degraded without any signs of inflammation. Transplanted retinas displayed areas of rosettes as well as normal lamination. In most cases inner retinal layers {{were present in the}} grafts. <b>Laminated</b> <b>areas</b> displayed well-developed photoreceptors adjacent to an intact host retinal pigment epithelium and degeneration of the host outer nuclear layer (ONL) was often observed together with occasional fusion of graft and host inner layers.

Peridynamic {{theory is}} an {{alternative}} theory of continuum mechanics that utilizes integral equations in place of problematic spatial derivatives in areas of material discontinuity.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} retinal sheet transplants in S 334 ter-line- 3 retinal degenerate rats {{by comparing}} visual responses recorded electrophysiologically with morphology based on light and electron microscopy. Methods: S 334 ter-line- 3 retinal degenerate rats (n = 7) received retinal sheet transplants between postnatal days 28 and 31. The donor tissue {{was derived from}} transgenic embryonic day 19 (E 19) rat retinae expressing human placental alkaline phosphatase (hPAP). Fresh retinal sheets were gently transplanted into the subretinal space o f the left eye {{with the help of}} a custom-made implantation tool. Selected rats (n = 5) were subjected to electrophysiologic evaluation of visual responses from the superior colliculus about 84 - 121 days after surgery. Transplanted eyes were processed for light microscopy (LM) and electron microscopy (EM) evaluations. Results: All the transplanted rats that were evaluated for visual responses in the brain showed responses to very low light stimulation (- 3. 42 to - 2. 8 log cd/m 2) of the eye in a small area of the superior colliculus corresponding with the placement of the transplant in the host retina. Histologic evaluation showed that most of the transplants contained well-laminated areas with correct polarity in the subretinal space. Inside the transplant areas, rosettes of photoreceptors with inner and outer segments were found. In the <b>laminated</b> <b>areas,</b> the outer segments of photoreceptors were facing the host retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Immunohistochemical evaluation of hPAP donor cells revealed areas with specific staining of the transplants in the subretinal space. Electron microscopic evaluation showed a glial demarcation membrane between the host and the transplant, however, processes originating from the transplant were observed inside the host retina. Conclusions: Sheets of E 19 rat retina transplanted into the subretinal space of S 334 ter-line- 3 rats survived without immune rejection and continued to show visual function when tested after 3 months. Well-developed photoreceptors and many synapse types were seen within the transplants. hPAP staining showed a certain degree of integration between the host retina and the transplant suggesting that transplanted photoreceptors contributed to the restored light sensitivity.

Cofilin- 2 levels were significantly lower in the proband’s muscle, and the mutant protein was less soluble when expressed in Escherichia coli, suggesting that deficiency of cofilin- 2 may result in reduced depolymerization of actin filaments, causing their accumulation in nemaline bodies, minicores, and, possibly, concentric laminated bodies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{the present}} work, the finite element {{formulation}} {{for the investigation}} of the effects of a localized interfacial degeneration on the dynamic behavior of the [90 ˚/ 0 ˚] laminated composite plate employing the state-space technique is performed. The stiffness of the laminate is determined by assembling the stiffnesses of sub-elements. This includes an introduction of an interface layer adopting the virtually zero-thickness formulation to model the interfacial degeneration. Also, the kinematically consistent mass matrix and proportional damping have been formulated to complete the free vibration governing expression. To simulate the interfacial degeneration of the <b>laminate,</b> the degenerated <b>areas</b> are defined from the center propagating outwards in a localized manner.

40|$|WOS: 000381324200011 International audienceThis study aims to {{investigate}} the influence of matrix nature (thermosetting - epoxy 914; and thermoplastic - Polyphenylene Sulfide PPS) on the tensile thermo-mechanical behaviour of both notched and unnotched laminates. Depending on variable prior fire-exposures, {{the purpose was to}} compare the changes on the residual tensile mechanical properties of carbon fibre reinforced epoxy 914 - and PPS based laminates subjected to stress concentration for aeronautical purposes (e. g., at service temperatures higher than glass transition temperature, T-g). With respect to the unnotched <b>laminates,</b> the <b>area</b> of the hole is an open access through the thickness for the heat flux causing more or less thermal degradation (depending on matrix nature) and resulting in variably decreasing the laminate tensile properties. Surprisingly, a low heat flux leads to virtually no decrease in the residual tensile strength of PPS-based laminates; however, in epoxy 914 -based composites, the exposure to a low heat flux is more detrimental as exposure time is long. Fractography analyses were performed {{to investigate}} damage mechanisms in perforated laminates. The influence of fire-induced damages, the subsequent degradation of the mechanical properties due to fire exposure, combined with the overstresses near the hole all contribute to significantly decrease both stiffness and strength of C/epoxy notched laminates. In notched C/PPS laminates, the fire-induced degradation, resulting from the redistribution of melted PPS matrix within the fibre network, may compete with a relaxation effect in the overstressed 0 degrees carbon fibres {{in the vicinity of the}} hole. These competing mechanisms are expected to reduce the influence of fire-exposure on the residual tensile strength of notched CiPPS laminates. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{there was}} a need of {{developing}} efficient nondestructive integrity assessment techniques for large <b>area</b> <b>laminate</b> structures, such as detections of disbond, crack, and corrosion in fuselage of an aircraft. Together with the improving tomography and computer technologies, {{progress has been made in}} many fields in NDE towards a faster inspection. Ultrasonically, Lamb wave is considered to be a candidate for large area inspections based on its capability of propagating a relatively long distance in thin plates and its media-thickness-dependent propagation properties. Moreover, the occurence of disbonds, corrosion, and even cracks often results in reduction of effective thickness of a laminate. The idea is to assess the condition of a structure by sensing the response of propagating Lamb waves to these flaws over long path length. A series of tests in the sequence of disbond, corrosion, and crack have been done on various types of specimen to investigate the feasibility of this approach.

40|$|The newest {{member of}} a family of {{thermosetting}} acetylene-substituted polyimide oligomers is HR 600 P. This oligomer is the isoimide version of the oligomer known as HR 600 P and Thermid 600. Although both types of material yield the same heat resistant end products after cure, HR 600 P has much superior processing characteristics. This attributed to its lower melting temperature (160 + or - 10 C, 320 + or - 20 F) in contrast to 202 C (396 F) for Thermid MC- 600, its longer gel time at its processing temperature (16 to 30 minutes bvs 3 minutes), and its excellent solubility in low boiling solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, glymes, or 4 : 1 methyl ethyl ketone/toluene mixtures. These advantages provide more acceptable coating and impregnation procedures, allow for more complete removal at lower temperatures, provide a longer pot life or working time, and allow composite structure fabrication in conventional autoclaves used for epoxy composite curing.

A numerical analysis was made to ensure that global buckling does not occur in the laminate during the CAI test, and that there is no interference with the damage <b>area.</b> <b>Laminate</b> specimens were tested with the proposed device and the ASTM device. For specimens 4. 416 mm thick (thickness according to ASTM D 7137 standard), the test results were similar with both devices.

A feature of this equipment {{is the use of}} proprietary linear sources capable of downwards evaporation. Using recipes generated within this program, CIGS cells with efficiencies up to 13. 9 % were prepared by EPV under a separate CRADA with NREL.

These deposits lack clear {{change in their}} grain size or macroscopically visible laminations. The massive structure is observed in deposits of various thickness, grain size (both in sand and muds) and distance from the shoreline. The massive layers are more common in areas with smaller run up (more than 50 %) than in the regions with a higher run up (approximately 40 %). A normal grading (fining upward) {{is the most common}} appearance of the IOT layers. Along the Phang Nga coast it is found in almost 70 % of the sites with a low run up height and in almost all of the sites with a higher run up (Table 1).

30|$|Since {{composites}} {{consist of}} different materials, they are inhomogeneous and anisotropic. As a consequence, different mechanical properties among the constituents {{and the environmental}} changes can create residual stresses, which may lead to interface de-bonding in the structures, leading to failure of the system. Therefore, it is of interest to investigate the feasibility of non-destructively monitoring mechanical aging in composites. The study of wave propagation and vibration in plates, half-spaces, and <b>laminates</b> is an <b>area</b> of considerable recent research activity. The propagation of the plane waves in unbounded homogeneous layered media is well known, and many methods have been proposed. On the dynamic behavior of anisotropic plates, extensive review of the plate theories {{can be found in}} Achenbach (1973), Auld (1973), Fedorov (1968), Nayfeh (1995), and Wooster (1973), and wave propagation problems in periodically layered anisotropic media have been considered by the authors Norris (1992, 1993), Wang and Rokhlin (2002), and Braga and Hermann (1988). Several problems on the theories of laminated and composite plates have been considered, and their dynamic behavior was studied by authors Reddy (1987, 1990), Liu et al. (1990), Postma (1955), Rytov (1956), and Sun et al. (1968). There also have been a reasonable number of investigations of such advanced materials, and their analysis was reported by Sve (1971), Jones (1975), Graff (1991), and Reddy (1997). Nayfeh (1991) developed a transfer matrix technique to obtain the dispersion relation curves of elastic wave propagating in multilayered anisotropic media, i.e., composite laminate. Detailed review on the wave propagation in layered anisotropic media/anisotropic laminates is given by Liu and Xi (2002). Yamada and Nasser (1981) have studied harmonic wave's propagation direction in orthotropic composites, and Verma (1999) considered the similar problem in thermoelastic heat conducting material.|$|R

This paper presents the mechanical property characterization and impact resistance results for laminates made from two types of graphite/PEEK materials that will conform to a curved surface. These laminates were made from two different material forms. These forms are: (1) a fabric where each yarn is a co-mingled Celion G 30 - 500 3 K graphite fiber and PEEK thermoplastic fiber; and (2) an interleaved material of Celion G 30 - 500 3 K graphite fabric interleaved with PEEK thermoplastic film. The experimental results from the fabric laminates are compared with results for laminates made from AS 4 /PEEK unidirectional tape. The {{results indicate that the}} tension and compression moduli for quasi-isotropic and orthotropic laminates made from fabric materials are at least 79 percent of the modulus of equivalent laminates made from tape material. The strength of fabric material laminates is at least 80 percent of laminates made from tape material. The evaluation of fabric material for shear stiffness indicates that a tape material laminate could be replaced by a fabric material laminate and still maintain 89 percent of the shear stiffness of the tape material laminate. The notched quasi-isotropic compression panel failure strength is 42 to 46 percent of the unnotched quasi-isotropic <b>laminate</b> strength.

In this project, six areas of bay bottom were surveyed using acoustic techniques to make maps of bay bottom types and to investigate the types and extent of anthropogenic impacts. A total of 31 km 2 was surveyed in six areas, one in Bolivar Roads (6. 1 km 2), one near Redfish Bar (3. 1 km 2), two in East Bay (12 km 2), one southeast of the Clear Lake entrance (5. 3 km 2), and one in Trinity Bay (4. 3 km 2). Sidescan sonars (100 kHz and 600 kHz) were used to image the bay bottom, and a chirp sonar (2 - 12 kHz) was used to image subsurface sediment layers and bottom topography. In the side-scan records, objects as small as a few meters in extent were visible, whereas the chirp sonar records show a vertical resolution of a few tens of centimeters. The sidescan images display strong backscatter in some areas due to coarse sediments in addition to weak backscatter in areas of fine sediment. The bay bottom was classified using three levels of sonar backscatter ranging from high to low. Areas of differing sonar backscatter intensity were sampled with cores and grab-samples. High backscatter corresponded to coarse shell debris and oyster reefs, medium backscatter corresponded to a sand-silt-shell mixture, and low backscatter corresponded to silty loam. Chirp sonar records were classified as one of nine different bottom reflection types based on changes in amplitude and stratigraphy. Parallel, layered sediments are seen filling the bay valley and resting atop a sharp contact at which the acoustic signal fades out. Along the flanks of the valley fill the acoustic response revealed an absent or weakly <b>laminated</b> stratigraphy, whereas <b>areas</b> of high oyster productivity produced mounds, strong surface returns, and strong, shallow subsurface reflectors surrounding current oyster reefs.
