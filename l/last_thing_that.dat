In replying to the headmaster’s speech when he visited Kingswood school in 1926, the King said: The headmaster is right in assuming that I am already well acquainted with Mr Ferens’s benefactions {{in other parts of}} the country; this is not the first time I have been associated with him in this manner, and though I know the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> he would want would be a public expression of thanks on my part, I would like to be allowed to share in the debt of gratitude which the Kingswood School owes him today.|$|E
5|$|Vulović {{was in a}} coma for {{ten days}} after the crash. She {{sustained}} severe brain damage, having fractured her skull and then hemorrhaged. In addition, she suffered two broken legs and three broken vertebrae, one of which was crushed completely. Her pelvis was fractured and several ribs broken. Her injuries resulted in her being temporarily paralyzed below the waist. She had total amnesia from the hour preceding her fall until one month afterwards. Vulović's parents told her that she first learned of the crash about two weeks after it occurred. She fainted upon being shown a newspaper headline by her doctor and had to be tranquilized. The <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> Vulović could remember from before the crash was greeting passengers as they boarded. The next thing she remembered was seeing her parents in her hospital room about one month later.|$|E

50|$|One of the <b>last</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> Chief Warrant Officer Paul Brenner {{wanted to}} do was return to work for the Army's Criminal Investigation Division-an {{organization}} that thanked him for his many years of dedicated service by forcing him into early retirement. But when his former boss calls in a career's worth of favors, Paul finds himself having to do the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> he ever wanted-return to Vietnam.|$|R
50|$|Kinsey was a {{very close}} friend to Robert Falcon Scott, {{and some of the}} <b>last</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> Scott wrote in his diary were to Kinsey.

500|$|At {{the third}} annual Singapore Children's Society Lecture {{entitled}} [...] "Changing Social Mores: Protecting Children from Themselves?" [...] on 31 October 2009, Woon expressed {{the view that}} prosecuting teenagers from having underage sex with each other served little purpose. [...] "It's basically kids having sex ... What {{do you do if}} the couple think they're in love? It's less easy if the girl consents. ... The judges cannot do very much by themselves. Sending them [...] to jail per se will not make them reflect on their lives. That is the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> is going to happen. But good or ill, this is the framework that we have." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{reflecting}} on the casting of James Pickens, Jr., Spotnitz called him [...] "another great find", adding that [...] "so {{many times over the}} course of the series we just got so lucky with the actors that we cast in these guest parts and just kept bringing them back because they were so wonderful. That's what happened with William B. Davis as the Cigarette-Smoking Man and with Nick Lea as Krycek, and with Mitch Pileggi as Walter Skinner, and that's what happened here with James Pickens. Just a fantastic actor, not at all like this person, really transformed himself to play this part". Spotnitz thought that, for a viewer who had weekly been watching The X-Files sixth season, there was a great sense of gratification when—in the final moments of [...] "One Son"—Spender essentially withdraws and tells Kersh that Mulder has been right, all along, precisely because the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> Kersh wanted was for Spender to behave in this way.|$|E
500|$|In September 2012, Marco Beltrami, who {{previously}} scored James Mangold's film [...] (2007), {{announced that he}} had signed on to score The Wolverine. Following Mangold's noir and Spaghetti Western inspirations for the film, Beltrami explained, [...] "I think I do every movie as a western whether it is or not, so there’s definitely some of the spaghetti western influence on my music throughout the score, and I guess throughout a lot of my work. I wouldn’t say there was a particular movie that influenced me more than something else. There was nothing that I was trying to mimic or anything." [...] On associating sounds with the film's primary location, Beltrami said, [...] "I think the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> Jim [...] and I wanted to do was Japanese music associated with Japanese places. There's a reference; I do use Japanese instruments, [...] not really in a traditional way." [...] The score was performed by an 85-piece ensemble of the Hollywood Studio Symphony at the Newman Scoring Stage at 20th Century Fox.|$|E

5000|$|The {{song was}} one of Duane Allman's last {{recorded}} performances with the band. [...] "As I mixed songs like [...] "Blue Sky," [...] I knew, of course, that I {{was listening to the}} <b>last</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> Duane ever played and there was just such a mix of beauty and sadness, knowing there's {{not going to be any}} more from him," [...] said Johnny Sandlin.|$|R
60|$|These {{were the}} <b>last</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> I saw {{in this life}} of mine, and {{therefore}} I remember them well, or rather, almost the last. The very last of which I took note was Irene's face. It had grown like {{to that of a}} devil. The great eyes in it stared out between the puffed and purple eyelids. The painted cheeks had sunk in and were pallid beneath and round the paint. The teeth showed in two white lines, the chin worked. She was no longer a beautiful woman, she was a fiend.|$|R

60|$|I {{sincerely}} {{wish that}} Shakespeare {{had been less}} hard in money matters, just as I wish that in financial matters Scott had been more like himself, {{that he had not}} done the <b>last</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> we should have expected him to do. As a member of the Scottish Bar it was inconsistent with his honour to be the secret proprietor of a publishing and a printing business. This is the unexplained moral paradox in the career of a man of chivalrous honour and strict probity: but the fault did not prevent Scott from writing his novels and poems. Why, then, should the few bare records of Shakspere's monetary transactions make HIS authorship impossible? The objection seems weakly sentimental.|$|R

2500|$|Epicurus {{was first}} to assert human freedom as coming from a {{fundamental}} indeterminism in the motion of atoms. This has led some philosophers to think that for Epicurus free will was caused directly by chance. In his On the Nature of Things (De rerum natura), Lucretius appears to suggest this in the best-known passage on Epicurus' position. But in his Letter to Menoeceus, Epicurus follows Aristotle and clearly identifies three possible causes [...] - [...] "some things happen of necessity, others by chance, others through our own agency." [...] Aristotle said some things [...] "depend on us" [...] (eph'hemin). Epicurus agreed, and said it is to these <b>last</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> praise and blame naturally attach. For Epicurus, the [...] "swerve" [...] (or clinamen) of the atoms simply defeated determinism to leave room for autonomous agency.|$|R

These imaginary spectators consoled him; he told himself their talk, one to another; it was of himself and his sad destiny.|$|R

500|$|The other {{material}} on Eat a Peach comes from live recordings. Dowd later said, [...] "When we recorded At Fillmore East, {{we ended up}} with almost a whole other album's worth of good material, and we used [...] tracks on Eat a Peach. Again, there was no overdubbing". Dowd started the mixing process for Eat a Peach but had run overtime and was called to commitments with Crosby, Stills and Nash; longtime Allman friend and colleague Johnny Sandlin took over for the remaining mixes. Sandlin later said of the mixing process, [...] "As I mixed songs like [...] "Blue Sky," [...] I knew, of course, that I was listening to the <b>last</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> Duane ever played and there was just such a mix of beauty and sadness, knowing there's {{not going to be any}} more from him". He was particularly proud of his mixing work on the album, but was angry because he did not receive credit, only a [...] "special thanks." ...|$|R
2500|$|Closing track, [...] "Tomorrow's Food", was {{the first}} song written for the album. Einziger stated that the song was {{conceived}} in 2009 with Lee Hartney from The Smith Street Band and [...] "was written {{at a time when}} I didn’t know whether or not {{we were going to go}} back and start working on new music for a new album. I’d been off at Harvard for a while and Brandon was really focusing on painting and for a little while there we didn’t have all that much communication. I just sort of wrote that guitar part, the chord progression and the changes and stuff and Brandon just sort of responded to it. We kind of just put it aside and then when we started working on new music for this album, I think we always knew that we wanted to record it in the studio and make it really great. But that actually was one of the <b>last</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> we did for this album." ...|$|R
50|$|Oscar Wilde {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} playwrights of the Victorian era. “Wilde’s easy wit insured an immediate success for the brilliant series of dramas that he wrote in the early nineties. In early 1892 Lady Windermere's Fan appeared at the St James' Theatre and was at once popular. The same year Wilde also wrote Salome. It was followed the next year by A Woman of No Importance. An Ideal Husband and The Importance of Being Earnest, both filled with wit and brilliant paradoxes, appeared in 1895. They were the <b>last</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> Oscar Wilde was to write, before he developed meningitis, and suffered his untimely death.”(Oscar Wilde 951). Other plays include Vera; or, The Nihilists (1880), The Duchess of Padua (1883), A Florentine Tragedy (La Sainte Courtisane 1893). Wilde's work has inspired many other fellow writers. His work has been translated into many languages, and has been on the stage over and over again.|$|R
