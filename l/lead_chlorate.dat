5000|$|Seeligerite {{is a rare}} complex <b>lead</b> <b>chlorate</b> iodate mineral with formula: [...] It is {{a yellow}} mineral {{crystallizing}} in the orthorhombic system. It has perfect to good cleavage in two directions and a quite high specific gravity of 6.83 due to the lead content. It is translucent to transparent with refractive indices of nα=2.120 nβ=2.320 nγ=2.320.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{striking}} {{match with}} a phosphorus head {{was invented by}} Charles Sauria in 1830. These matches (and subsequent modifications) were made with heads of white phosphorus, an oxygen-releasing compound (potassium <b>chlorate,</b> <b>lead</b> dioxide, or sometimes nitrate), and a binder. They were poisonous to the workers in manufacture, sensitive to storage conditions, toxic if ingested, and hazardous when accidentally ignited on a rough surface. [...] Production in several countries was banned between 1872 and 1925. The international Berne Convention, ratified in 1906, prohibited the use of white phosphorus in matches.|$|R
40|$|Penicillium brevicompactum is a {{filamentous}} fungus that presents {{a potential for}} industrial use due its efficient pectinase production. A heterologous transformation system was developed for P. brevicompactum based on the complementation of a nitrate reductase mutant. Nitrate reductase mutants were obtained by resistance to chlorate in a rate of 23. 24 % {{when compared to other}} mutations that <b>lead</b> to the <b>chlorate</b> resistance. One mutant named 4457 - 18 X was chosen for the transformation experiments with the pNH 24 vector containing de Fusarium oxysporum nitrate reductase gene. A frequency of approximately 3 transformants/µg DNA was obtained using the circular vector pNH 24. This frequency was multiplied about 10 fold using the linearized vector with the Xba I restriction enzyme. Southern analysis of the transformants showed a tendency of the linearized vector to diminish the number of integrations compared {{to the use of the}} circular vector. The integration was random and stable in the analyzed transformants. The establishment of a transformation system for P. brevicompactum is fundamental for genetic manipulation of this microorganism...|$|R
40|$|The {{herbicide}} chlorate {{has been}} used extensively to isolate mutants that are defective in nitrate reduction. Chlorate is a substrate for the enzyme nitrate reductase (NR), which reduces chlorate to the toxic chlorite. Because NR is a substrate (NO 3 −) -inducible enzyme, we investigated the possibility that chlorate may also act as an inducer. Irrigation of ammonia-grown Arabidopsis plants with <b>chlorate</b> <b>leads</b> {{to an increase in}} NR mRNA in the leaves. No such increase was observed for nitrite reductase mRNA following chlorate treatment; thus, the effect seems to be specific to NR. The increase in NR mRNA did not depend on the presence of wild-type levels of NR activity or molybdenum-cofactor, as a molybdenum-cofactor mutant with low levels of NR activity displayed the same increase in NR mRNA following chlorate treatment. Even though NR mRNA levels were found to increase after chlorate treatment, no increase in NR protein was detected and the level of NR activity dropped. The lack of increase in NR protein was not due to inactivation of the cells' translational machinery, as pulse labeling experiments demonstrated that total protein synthesis was unaffected by the chlorate treatment during the time course of the experiment. Chlorate-treated plants still retain the capacity to make functional NR because NR activity could be restored by irrigating the chlorate-treated plants with nitrate. The low levels of NR protein and activity may be due to inactivation of NR by chlorite, leading to rapid degradation of the enzyme. Thus, chlorate treatment stimulates NR gene expression in Arabidopsis that is manifested only at the mRNA level and not at the protein or activity level...|$|R
