5|$|In 1852, John Camden Neild, an {{eccentric}} miser, left Victoria an unexpected legacy, which Albert {{used to obtain}} the freehold of Balmoral. As usual, he embarked on an extensive programme of improvements. The same year, he was appointed to several of the offices left vacant {{by the death of}} the Duke of Wellington, including the mastership of Trinity House and the colonelcy of the Grenadier Guards. With Wellington's passing, Albert was able to propose and campaign for modernisation of the army, which was <b>long</b> <b>overdue.</b> Thinking that the military was unready for war, and that Christian rule was preferable to Islamic rule, Albert counselled a diplomatic solution to conflict between the Russian and Ottoman empires. Palmerston was more bellicose, and favoured a policy that would prevent further Russian expansion. Palmerston was manoeuvred out of the cabinet in December 1853, but {{at about the same time}} a Russian fleet attacked the Ottoman fleet at anchor at Sinop. The London press depicted the attack as a criminal massacre, and Palmerston's popularity surged as Albert's fell. Within two weeks, Palmerston was re-appointed as a minister. As public outrage at the Russian action continued, false rumours circulated that Albert had been arrested for treason and was being held prisoner in the Tower of London.|$|E

50|$|While the Shriver Center is {{a fantastic}} {{university}} center, in 2008 Miami announced that a new building will be built designed specifically and wholly for the students: The Bicentennial Student Center. It’s something that Miami has struggled in making {{for a while and}} it is a <b>long</b> time <b>overdue.</b> The building will be located on Spring Street, diagonally facing the Shriver Center. According to its website, “the building concept connects the past and the future, renovating Culler, Gaskill and Rowan Halls and joining them, as functioning parts… with a new structure constructed in the expansive space between the existing buildings.”There will be two main entrances into building and the entryway and walkway will be mostly naturally lit by a skylight. The building will include a theater, a pavilion to hold events in, a common room in which students can sit down and either socialize or do work, Center for Student Engagement and Leadership where student-led groups can hold meetings and, finally, have a few large lobbies and conference rooms where students can gather for extra study space due to high demand. On June 30, 2010, it was announced that the Bicentennial Center will now be called the Armstrong Student Center. The reason for this name change was because of two alums who graduated in 1961, both with the last name Armstrong, donated $15 million to this project. Funding was lacking for the building and these two alums felt the donation and building was needed for the students.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: 2 ̆ 2 Hilbert 2 ̆ 7 s finitist {{program was}} not created at the {{beginning}} of the twenties solely to counteract Brouwer 2 ̆ 7 s intuitionism, but rather emerged out of broad philosophical reflections on the foundations of mathematics and out of detailed logical work; that is evident from notes of lecture courses that were given by Hilbert and prepared in collaboration with Bernays during the period from 1917 to 1922. These notes reveal a dialectic progression from a critical logicism through a radical constructivism towards finitism; the progression has to be seen against the background of the stunning presentation of mathematical logic in the lectures given during the winter term 1917 / 18. In this paper, I sketch the connection of Hilbert 2 ̆ 7 s considerations to issues in the foundations of mathematics during the second half of the 19 th century, describe the work that laid the basis of modern mathematical logic, and analyze the first steps in the new subject of proof theory. A broad revision of Hilbert 2 ̆ 7 s and Bernays 2 ̆ 7 s [sic] contributions to the foundational discussion in our century has <b>long</b> been <b>overdue.</b> It is almost scandalous that their carefully worked out notes have not been used yet to understand more accurately the evolution of modern logic in general and of Hilbert 2 ̆ 7 s Program in particular. One conclusion will be obvious: the dogmatic formalist Hilbert is a figment of historical (de) construction! Indeed, the study and analysis of these lectures reveal a depth of mathematical- logical achievement and of philosophical reflection that is remarkable. In the course of my presentation many questions are raised and many more can be explored; thus, I hope this paper will stimulate interest for new historical and systematic work. 2 ̆...|$|R
40|$|Considering {{the amount}} of {{material}} written on Codex Bezae down through the centuries a detailed history of research into the codex has <b>long</b> been <b>overdue.</b> Such a history is important not only to give future researchers {{an understanding of what}} has gone on before,. but also to facilitate an understanding of the development of ideas and their outcome. As Codex Bezae is the principal witness of the so-called Western text, much of what has been written centres upon its text. Nevertheless {{from the end of the}} last century there has been a growing awareness among scholars of the need to give the other details contained within the codex far more attention than hitherto. Inasmuch as the D text is the main rival to the Alexandrian text as the best representative of the otiginal exemplar, it is of no surprise that Codex Bezae and its text have been of interest to the textual critics. Over the last century and a half there have always been those advocating the supremacy of the D text, and such claims have attracted much attention. For this reason, Codex Bezae has never been far from the focus of scholarly debate. This debate would be greatly helped if Codex Bezae could be accurately located historically, for this, briefly, is the nub of the problem - where and when was it written? Any avenue of inquiry ever pursued, any investigation ever embarked upon, has the answer to this question as its prime objective. Hence the importance of this history, for we need to know how the debate has progressed if we are to avoid repeating previous fruitless enterprises and if we wish to build upon previous fruitful endeavours. Having established the history of research on Codex Bezae it was opportune to assess the claims and counterclaims, to sift the data, and to separate the more factual evidence from the many hypotheses, in order to establish a solid base from which to launch future inquiries. Consequently this thesis provides: 1. a detailed history of the research on Codex Bezae; 2. an analysis of the existing evidence; 3. a detailed catalogue of scholars who have contributed to the debate; 4. details of my own investigations into the historical use of unusually spelled words in the Bezan text; and 5. suggested avenues for future research...|$|R

It includes {{measures of the}} extent to which states and territories met targets for emergency department lengths of stay of four hours or less, and for lengths of time spent waiting for elective surgery. It is being released on 28 February 2013, two months after the end of the 2012 reporting period, the date by which most of the data are required by the Council of Australian Governments Reform Council. The National Emergency Access Target (NEAT) The goal of the NEAT is to increase the proportion of emergency department patients who physically leave the emergency department (for admission to hospital, referral to anotherhospital, or discharge) in 4 hours or less. In 2012, five states and territories achieved proportions of patients leaving the emergency department in 4 hours or less that were higher than the baseline figures specified in the Agreement, and one state had a proportion greater than the target specified for it in the Agreement. Overall, 65. 5 % of patients presenting to a public hospital emergency department had their visit to the emergency department completed in 4 hours or less. Nationally, and for most states and territories, the highest proportion of presentations with length of stay of 4 hours or less were in the October–December quarter. The National Elective Surgery Target (NEST) The goal of the NEST is to increase the proportion of elective surgery patients seen within clinically recommended times and to reduce the number of patients waiting beyond the clinically recommended time. In 2012, six states and territories achieved proportions seen on time greater than or equal to the baseline figures specified in the Agreement for two or three clinical urgency categories. Three states achieved proportions seen on time greater than the targets specified for them in the Agreement for two or three urgency categories. Six states and territories had average overdue waits shorter than the baseline figures in the Agreement for two or three clinical urgency categories. Four states and territories had average overdue waits shorter than their targets for two or three urgency categories. During 2012, five states and territories had provided treatment or referral for the <b>longest</b> wait <b>overdue</b> patients (those who had waited the longest at 31 December 2011) for all urgency categories. A further two states and territories had provided treatment or referral for all urgency category 1 patients. There were almost 671, 000 admissions from public hospital elective surgery waiting lists, as either an elective or an emergency admission in 2012.
