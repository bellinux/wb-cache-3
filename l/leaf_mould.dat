60|$|XXVII. This rule of {{supremacy}} {{applies to}} the smallest {{as well as to}} the leading features: it is interestingly seen in the arrangement of all good mouldings. I have given one, on the opposite page, from Rouen cathedral; that of the tracery before distinguished as a type of the noblest manner of Northern Gothic (Chap. II. § XXII.). It is a tracery of three orders, of which the first is divided into a <b>leaf</b> <b>moulding,</b> fig. 4, and b in the section, and a plain roll, also seen in fig. 4, c in the section; these two divisions surround the entire window or panelling, and are carried by two-face shafts of corresponding sections. The second and third orders are plain rolls following the line of the tracery; four divisions of moulding in all: of these four, the <b>leaf</b> <b>moulding</b> is, as seen in the sections, much the largest; next to it the outer roll; then, by an exquisite alternation, the innermost roll (e), in order that it may not be lost in the recess and the intermediate (d), the smallest. Each roll has its own shaft and capital; and the two smaller, which in effect upon the eye, owing to the retirement of the innermost, are nearly equal, have smaller capitals than the two larger, lifted a little to bring them to the same level. The wall in the trefoiled lights is curved, as from e to f in the section; but in the quatrefoil it is flat, only thrown back to the full depth of the recess below so as to get a sharp shadow instead of a soft one, the mouldings falling back to it in nearly a vertical curve behind the roll e. This could not, however, be managed with the simpler mouldings of the smaller quatrefoil above, whose half section is given from g to g2; but the architect was evidently fretted by the heavy look of its circular foils as opposed to the light spring of the arches below: so he threw its cusps obliquely clear from the wall, as seen in fig. 2, attached to it where they meet the circle, but with their finials pushed out from the natural level (h, in the section) to that of the first order (g2) and supported by stone props behind, as seen in the profile fig. 2, which I got from the correspondent panel on the buttress face (fig. 1 being on its side), and of which the lower cusps, being broken away, show the remnant of one of their props projecting from the wall. The oblique curve thus obtained in the profile is of singular grace. Take it all in all, I have never met with a more exquisite piece of varied, yet severe, proportioned and general arrangement (though all the windows of the period are fine, and especially delightful in the subordinate proportioning of the smaller capitals to the smaller shafts). The only fault it has is the inevitable misarrangement of the central shafts; for the enlargement of the inner roll, though beautiful in the group of four divisions at the side, causes, in the triple central shaft, the very awkwardness of heavy lateral members which has just been in most instances condemned. In the windows of the choir, and in most of the period, this difficulty is avoided by making the fourth order a fillet which only follows the foliation, while the three outermost are nearly in arithmetical progression of size, and the central triple shaft has of course the largest roll in front. The moulding of the Palazzo Foscari (Plate VIII., and Plate IV. fig. 8) is, for so simple a group, the grandest in effect I have even seen: it is composed of a large roll with two subordinates.|$|R

50|$|Leaf {{flushing}} is {{the production}} of a flush of new leaves typically produced simultaneously on all branches of a bare plant or tree. Leaf flushing succeeds leaf fall, and is delayed by winter in the temperate zone or by extreme dryness in the tropics but leaf fall and leaf flushing in tropical deciduous forests can overlap, with new leaves produced during the same period when old leaves are shed.

40|$|Sorghum is an {{important}} subsistence crop in Tanzania. Surveys were carried out between the 1986 and 1990 crop seasons to determine the prevalence of diseases and parasitic weeds in the major sorghum-growing areas of Tanzania.

40|$|Patterns of leaf-flushing {{phenology}} {{of trees}} in relation to insect herbivore damage were studied at two sites in a seasonal tropical dry forest in Mudumalai, southern India, from April 1988 to August 1990.

Herbivorous insects emerged with the rains and attained a peak biomass during the wet months. Trees that flushed leaves later in the season suffered significantly higher damage by insects compared to those that flushed early or in synchrony during the peak flushing phase. Species whose leaves were endowed with physical defenses such as waxes suffered less damage than those not possessing such defenses. There was a positive association between the abundance of a species and leaf damage levels.

6000|$|XXXIX. I conclude, then, {{that all}} {{arrangements}} of color, {{for its own}} sake, in graceful forms, are barbarous; and that, to paint a color pattern with the lovely lines of a Greek <b>leaf</b> <b>moulding,</b> is an utterly savage procedure. I cannot find anything in natural color like this: {{it is not in}} the bond. I find it in all natural form--never in natural color. If, then, our architectural color is to be beautiful as its form was, by being imitative, we are limited to these conditions--to simple masses of it, to zones, as in the rainbow and the zebra; cloudings and flamings, as in marble shells and plumage, or spots of various shapes and dimensions. All these conditions are susceptible of various degrees of sharpness and delicacy, and of complication in arrangement. The zone may become a delicate line, and arrange itself in chequers and zig-zags. The flaming may be more or less defined, as on a tulip leaf, and may at last be represented by a triangle of color, and arrange itself in stars or other shapes; the spot may be also graduated into a stain, or defined into a square or circle. The most exquisite harmonies may be composed of these simple elements: some soft and full of flushed and melting spaces of color; others piquant and sparkling, or deep and rich, formed of close groups of the fiery fragments: perfect and lovely proportion may be exhibited in the relation of their quantities, infinite invention in their disposition: but, in all cases, their shape will be effective only as it determines their quantity, and regulates their operation on each other; points or edges of one being introduced between breadths of others, and so on. Triangular and barred forms are therefore convenient, or others the simplest possible; leaving the pleasure of the spectator to be taken in the color, and in that only. Curved outlines, especially if refined, deaden the color, and confuse the mind. Even in figure painting the greatest colorists have either melted their outline away, as often Correggio and Rubens; or purposely made their masses of ungainly shape, as Titian; or placed their brightest hues in costume, where they could get quaint patterns, as Veronese, and especially Angelico, with whom, however, the absolute virtue of color is secondary to grace of line. Hence, he never uses the blended hues of Correggio, like those on the wing of the little Cupid, in the [...] "Venus and Mercury," [...] but always the severest type--the peacock plume. Any of these men would have looked with infinite disgust upon the leafage and scrollwork which form the ground of color in our modern painted windows, and yet all whom I have named were much infected with the love of renaissance designs. We must also allow for the freedom of the painter's subject, and looseness of his associated lines; a pattern being severe in a picture, which is over luxurious upon a building. I believe, therefore, {{that it is impossible to}} be over quaint or angular in architectural coloring; and thus many dispositions which I have had occasion to reprobate in form, are, in color, the best that can be invented. I have always, for instance, spoken with contempt of the Tudor style, for this reason, that, having surrendered all pretence to spaciousness and breadth,--having divided its surfaces by an infinite number of lines, it yet sacrifices the only characters which can make lines beautiful; sacrifices all the variety and grace which long atoned for the caprice of the Flamboyant, and adopts, for its leading feature, an entanglement of cross bars and verticals, showing about as much invention or skill of design as the reticulation of the bricklayer's sieve. Yet this very reticulation would in color be highly beautiful; and all the heraldry, and other features which, in form, are monstrous, may be delightful as themes of color (so long as there are no fluttering or over-twisted lines in them); and this observe, because, when colored, they take the place of a mere pattern, and the resemblance to nature, which could not be found in their sculptured forms, is found in their piquant variegation of other surfaces. There is a beautiful and bright bit of wall painting behind the Duomo of Verona, composed of coats of arms, whose bearings are balls of gold set in bars of green (altered blue?) and white, with cardinal's hats in alternate squares. This is of course, however, fit only for domestic work. The front of the Doge's palace at Venice is the purest and most chaste model that I can name (but one) of the fit application of color to public buildings. The sculpture and mouldings are all white; but the wall surface is chequered with marble blocks of pale rose, the chequers being in no wise harmonized, or fitted to the forms of the windows; but looking as if the surface had been completed first, and the windows cut out of it. In Plate XII. fig. 2 the reader will see two of the patterns used in green and white, on the columns of San Michele of Lucca, every column having a different design. Both are beautiful, but the upper one certainly the best. Yet in sculpture its lines would have been perfectly barbarous, and those even of the lower not enough refined.|$|R
40|$|Pure plants {{extracts}} or/and {{essential oils}} show antifungal and antibacterial activity against {{a wide range}} of fungi and bacteria. Recently there has been increasing interest in the effects of natural compounds against important plant pathogens (fungi and bacteria). Although the antimicrobial activity of oleuropein, grape pomace (GPE) and olive mills waste water (OMWW) extracts have been studied widely, little research has been done on the in vitro and in vivo evaluation of these extracts efficiency against important plant diseases and postharvest treatments. The overall objectives of this study were firstly to extract and isolate from olive leaves (oleuropein), olive mills waste water and from grape pomace (winery by-products) natural compounds in order to be used for in vitro and in vivo experiments. In particular, all three natural extracts were found to restrain in vitro growth of a series of important bacterial and fungal pathogens, such as: Botrytis cinerea, the cause of grey mold disease, Alternaria alternata, causing <b>leaf</b> spots and <b>moulds</b> on several plant species, Fusarium oxysporum fsp melonis, causing Fusarium wilt of melon, a Rhizopus species (a genus causing fruit and vegetable decays), the crucifer pathogen Colletotrichum higginsianum, causing anthracnose leaf spot disease on several Brassica and Raphanus species and Phytophthora parasitica var. nicotianae, the causal agent of the black shank disease of tobacco. Bacterial strains including Clavibacter michiganensis spp. michiganensis, the cause of bacterial canker of tomato, Ralstonia solanacearum causing bacterial wilt in solanaceous plants, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, the cause of bacterial speck on tomato and Arabidopsis and Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria causing the bacterial spot disease of pepper and tomato were tested. Oleuropein (semipure and pure) showed remarkable antibacterial activity. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), at least of oleuropein was lower than 0. 1 %. MICs values for GPE and OMWW extract ranged from 0. 1 % to 0. 2 %. Moreover, these natural extracts were shown to inhibit and/or restrain spore germination of fungi in solid media, however grape pomace extract, was sufficiently effective to inhibit spore germination and germ tube of C. higginsianum and B. cinerea. Furthermore in vivo antibacterial activity of pure oleuropein and OMWW extract was assessed in greenhouse experiments, on Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria, the cause of bacterial spot of pepper plants and Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, the cause of bacterial speck of tomato plants, respectively. It seems that 0. 1 % pure oleuropein (98 %) and 0. 1 % OMWW extract had a protective effect against bacterial spot and bacterial speck respectively, which is more obvious when oleuropein application started before infection. Besides endophytic growth of Phytophthora parasitica var. nicotianae, causal agent of the black shank disease of tobacco, on tobacco leaves by measuring its radial growth inside the infected tissue, was assessed. 0. 1 % GPE showed the most significant inhibition in all tobacco leaves treatments. The potential of postharvest treatment of table grapes with the grape pomace extract (GPE) to restrain grey mould (Botrytis cinerea) disease incidence and development was estimated. 5 % GPE treatments produced the strongest inhibitory effect against B. cinerea incidence on grape berries and the time after treatment influenced the numbers of decayed berries. Finally the use of pure oleuropein as antibacterial in vase solution for cut flowers (carnation) was evaluated. Oleuropein showed strong antibacterial activity as vase solution and carnations vase life was more than doubled by using oleuropein 200 ppm and 400 ppm, compared with control (water) ...|$|R

In spring, the plants should receive the full influence of the increasing warmth of the sun; and during hot weather, they will be benefited by frequent spraying overhead, which should be done in the evening. The soil should never be saturated, as the soft fibrous roots will rot if kept wet for any length of time.|$|E
50|$|Cladosporium is a genus of fungi {{including}} some of the most common indoor and outdoor molds. Species produce olive-green to brown or black colonies, and have dark-pigmented conidia that are formed in simple or branching chains. Many species of Cladosporium are commonly found on living and dead plant material. Some species are plant pathogens, others parasitize other fungi. Cladosporium spores are wind-dispersed and they are often extremely abundant in outdoor air. Indoors Cladosporium species may grow on surfaces when moisture is present. Cladosporium fulvum, cause of tomato <b>leaf</b> <b>mould,</b> has been an important genetic model, in that the genetics of host resistance are understood. In the 1960s, it was estimated that the genus Cladosporium contained around 500 plant-pathogenic and saprotrophic species, but this number has since been increased to over 772 species. The genus Cladosporium is closely related to black yeasts in the order Dothideales. Cladosporium species are often highly osmotolerant, growing easily on media containing 10% glucose or 12-17% NaCl. They are rarely grown on media containing 24% NaCl or 50% glucose and never isolated from medium with 32% NaCl or greater. Most species have very fragile spore chains, making it extremely difficult to prepare a mount for microscopic observation in which the conidial chains are preserved intact.|$|E
