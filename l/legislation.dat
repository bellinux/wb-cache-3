5|$|At first, the dissenting deputies {{were often}} {{convinced}} or cowed back to withdraw their objections. Also, at first, the rule {{was used to}} strike down only individual laws, not to dissolve the chamber and throw out all measures passed. For example, as historian Władysław Czapliński describes in the Sejm of 1611 context, some resolutions were struck down, but others passed. From the mid-17th century onward, however, an objection to any item of Sejm <b>legislation</b> from a deputy or senator automatically caused other, earlier adopted <b>legislation</b> to be rejected. That was because all <b>legislation</b> that was adopted by a given Sejm formed a whole.|$|E

5|$|Croatia {{first elected}} 12 {{members of the}} European Parliament (MEPs) in a {{by-election}} held after its accession to the EU in 2013. Thereafter, its number of members in the European Parliament was reduced to 11 and the country elected {{them as part of}} the regular election in 2014. The elections are regulated by special <b>legislation</b> enacted by the Sabor. Provisions of the <b>legislation</b> are very similar to the parliamentary-election <b>legislation,</b> with the main difference being that the 11 members of the European Parliament are elected in a single constituency encompassing all of Croatia, instead of multiple constituencies used in the parliamentary elections.|$|E

Building on {{the work}} of the EDEMOI methodology, this paper proposes a twofold {{expansion}} of this methodology consisting in: (1) broadening its scope to include aviation safety <b>legislations</b> and (2) extending its usability to detect regression originating from regulatory amendments.

5|$|Electoral <b>legislation</b> {{remained}} unchanged. Labor introduced {{bills for}} reform, {{but these were}} defeated {{in both houses of}} Parliament. The premier introduced electoral <b>legislation</b> that would have entrenched his government further than under the Playmander. As electoral <b>legislation</b> was part of the South Australian constitution, it required an absolute parliamentary majority (20 seats, under the current system) to be changed. The LCL relied on Stott in the house, so Labor could obstruct changes by keeping members away and forcing a pair.|$|E

In April 1890, the Manitoba legislature attempted to abolish {{the official}} status of French, and ceased to publish bilingual <b>legislation.</b> However, in 1985 the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in the Reference re Manitoba Language Rights that §23 still applied, and that <b>legislation</b> published only in English was invalid (unilingual <b>legislation</b> was declared valid for a temporary period to allow time for translation).|$|E

40|$|There {{are very}} rich archival {{materials}} in our country, but unfortunately these sources {{have not been}} collected, preserved, classified and presented for use properly. One {{of the main reasons}} for this is that the lack of statutory regulations that would solve the problems and bring order to the state archives. For a full and better archival services one of the first necessary conditions is the <b>legislations.</b> From {{the early years of the}} Republican period different statutory regulations have been prepared in order to organize the management and put the services in an order, and also to provide the necessary conditions and trained staff for the public archives. Many <b>legislations</b> made until 1984 have been abolished due to their ineffective usage. Today, two <b>legislations</b> and one regulation meet the needs of the state archives. These statutory <b>legislations</b> require state archives to discharge many responsibilities. The aim of this study is to investigate the conditions of the archives of the state institutions and to identify the problems, and thus offer some solutions to these problems within the limitations of the existing <b>legislations...</b>|$|R

5|$|First-wave {{feminism}} was {{a period}} of activity during the 19th century and early twentieth century. In the UK and eventually the US, it focused on the promotion of equal contract, marriage, parenting, and property rights for women. By the end of the 19th century, a number of important steps had been made with the passing of <b>legislation</b> such as the UK Custody of Infants Act 1839 which introduced the Tender years doctrine for child custody arrangement and gave woman the right of custody of their children for the first time. Other <b>legislation</b> such as the Married Women's Property Act 1870 in the UK and extended in the 1882 Act, these became models for similar <b>legislation</b> in other British territories. For example, Victoria passed <b>legislation</b> in 1884, New South Wales in 1889, and the remaining Australian colonies passed similar <b>legislation</b> between 1890 and 1897. Therefore, with the turn of the 19th century activism had focused primarily on gaining political power, particularly the right of women's suffrage, though some feminists were active in campaigning for women's sexual, reproductive, and economic rights as well.|$|E

5|$|However, Graham {{suggests}} that Lord Steyn's comments {{were limited to}} the use of the Parliament Acts and would not apply to <b>legislation</b> enacted using the ordinary legislative procedure.

40|$|Disaster {{research}} and scholarship is now advocating {{a shift from}} focusing on the hazard event to processes that generate vulnerability and loss of resilience to disasters. Disaster <b>legislations</b> are among prominent instruments that can highlight the tensions as well as challenges that are being encountered towards this change in focus. Using textual analysis, this paper presents a study that investigated whether five post- 2002 disaster <b>legislations</b> have shifted emphasis from the hazard to the vulnerability and resilience paradigms. The five examples illustrate that {{while there is a}} slight change, at least in rhetoric, from response to a prevention focus, disaster <b>legislations</b> largely promote a centralised institutional framework, with inadequate resource commitments and limited participation from vulnerable communities. Consequently, while generalisations simply cannot be made without a wider analysis of many more examples from different countries, the five disaster <b>legislations</b> appear to re-emphasise the response focus with less attention on the processes that reduce vulnerability and enhance resilience. The conclusion is that while the rhetoric has changed, the disaster <b>legislations</b> have not significantly moved from the hazard to vulnerability and resilience focus suggesting that reduction of losses and damages to disasters remains a big challenge...|$|R
