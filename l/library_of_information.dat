Yet in 1816, he sought to distance himself from Prussian authority and applied that June for Saxon citizenship. The move was not expected by his friends, as the Saxon government of the time was pro-French, while Friedrich's paintings to date were seen as generally patriotic and distinctly anti-French. Nevertheless, with the aid of his Dresden-based friend Graf Vitzthum von Eckstädt, Friedrich attained not only citizenship, but in 1818, a membership in the Saxon Academy with a yearly dividend of 150 thalers. Although he had hoped to receive a full professorship, it was never awarded him as, according to the German <b>Library</b> <b>of</b> <b>Information,</b> [...] "it was felt that his painting was too personal, his point of view too individual to serve as a fruitful example to students." [...] Politics too may {{have played a role in}} [...] stalling his career: Friedrich's decidedly Germanic subjects and costuming frequently clashed with the era's prevailing pro-French attitudes.|$|E

2500|$|Gessner {{has been}} {{described}} as the father of modern scientific botany and zoology, and the father of modern bibliography. To his contemporaries he was best known as a botanist. Despite his traveling ways and the job of maintaining his own gardens, Gesner probably {{spent most of his time}} inside his own extensive library. He listed among his History of Animals sources more than 80 Greek authors and at least 175 Latin authors, as well as works by German, French, and Italian authors. He even attempted to establish a [...] "universal library" [...] of all books in existence. The project might sound strange to the modern mind, but Gessner invested tremendous energy in the project. He sniffed through remote libraries along with the collections of the Vatican Library and catalogs of printers and booksellers. By assembling this universal <b>library</b> <b>of</b> <b>information,</b> Gessner put together a database centuries before computers would ease such work. He cut relevant passages out of books, grouped the cuttings by general theme, subdivided the groups into more specific categories, and boxed them. He could then retrieve and arrange the cuttings as needed. In the words of science writer Anna Pavord, [...] "He was a one-man search engine, a 16th-century Google with the added bonus of critical evaluation." ...|$|E

All the already mentioned courses takes place in Danish but The Royal School <b>of</b> <b>Library</b> and <b>Information</b> Science also offers an English-speaking 2-year master's degree called Master <b>of</b> <b>Library</b> and <b>Information</b> Science (M.L.I.Sc.).

The students can also obtain a Ph.D. in Library and Information Science at The Royal School <b>of</b> <b>Library</b> and <b>Information</b> Science (first awarded at The Royal School <b>of</b> <b>Library</b> and <b>Information</b> Science in 2004).
