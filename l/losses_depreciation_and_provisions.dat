I propose making cash flows the central theme in such a course: take investment appraisal as the starting point, which demonstrates the need for financing, which creates the need to report regarding separate periods (thereby creating the need for non-cash flow elements such as revenues, capitalization, <b>depreciation,</b> <b>and</b> <b>provisions)</b> <b>and</b> subsequently zooming-in on the sources of profit and loss. The sequence of topics in accounting textbooks is investigated, {{as a proxy for}} how introductory courses are taught.

40|$|Wealth {{is defined}} as one that has 'Value in Exchange' and 'Value in use'. Accountants, in {{financial}} statements show items like goodwill, <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> <b>depreciation</b> that may/maynot have 'Value in exchange'. Who is right? Mathematics has an answer. Can we add 2 a and 3 a? Yes. Can we subtract 2 a from 7 a? Yes. Can one add or subtract 2 a to/from 7 b? No. Can we add 2 meters and 3 meters? Yes. Can we subtract 3 grams from 5 grams? Yes. Can we add or subtract 3 grams from 8 seconds? No. Only wealth can be added or subtracted to/from wealth. This is in other words Law of Conservation of Wealth. As items like <b>loss,</b> <b>depreciation</b> <b>and</b> goodwill are added/subtracted to/from other forms of wealth these are forms of wealth. When one says that crop worth $ 4 million is lost, he is expressing loass in units of money and money {{is a form of}} wealth. If loss is not a form of wealth, why is it expressed in units of wealth? What is the unit of non-wealth? Therefore, the words 'Value in Exchange' have no relevance. Value in Exchange, Value in Use, Law of Conservation of Wealth and Law of Equilibrium...|$|R

40|$|Law of Conservation is a {{universal}} Law and applies to mass, energy and wealth alike. When wealth is changed from one form to the other, the value of transferee form of wealth equals value of transferor form of wealth. This leads to inferance that wealth can neither be created nor be destroyed but can be changed from one form to the other. The principle of Double Entry Method of Bookkeeping rests on this Law. We cannot create a debit/credit without corresponding credit/debit and the assets and liabilities in a balance sheet should match. All classical economic theories and laws are based on this law. Law of Equilibrium and Law of Conservation are inseparable. One is the cause {{and the other is}} the effect. The words 'value in exchange' in the definition of wealth are to be deleted. <b>Loss,</b> <b>depreciation</b> <b>and</b> goodwill may/may not have value in exchange but they are expressed in units of wealth.

Incorporation with limited liability enabled companies to ‘lock-in’ their financial capital’ and then invest in the long-term, highly specific investments on which the modern industrial economy would be based. The level of benefit varied from country to country, according to the way that the concept of capital lock-in, or maintenance, was defined in the legal systems concerned. In the UK, the concept was not well defined in early company legislation and challenges were raised through the courts during the late nineteenth century. Some of these, the ‘dividend cases’, have been quite widely considered in the literature but direct reductions of share capital, or capital reduction schemes, have received far less attention, even though they raised fundamental issues concerning long-term dividend positions, the accounting treatment of accumulated <b>losses,</b> <b>depreciation</b> <b>and</b> asset values and had important effects {{on the development of the}} capital maintenance doctrine and on shareholder class rights. The purpose of this paper is to question whether this literature adequately captures judicial influences on the development of the capital maintenance doctrine in England during the latter part of the nineteenth century, given the limited attention that has been paid to date to the leading capital reduction cases.

5000|$|A tax credit, or equity, syndicator connects {{private investors}} seeking a strong return on {{investments}} with developers seeking cash for a qualified LIHTC project. As mentioned above, the credit is used to generate private equity, often prior to, or during, {{the construction of the}} project. Developers typically [...] "sell" [...] the credits by entering into limited partnerships (or limited liability companies) with an investor, with 99.99% of the profits, <b>losses,</b> <b>depreciation,</b> <b>and</b> tax credits being allocated to the investor as a partner in the partnership. The developer serves as the general partner/managing member, and receives a majority of the cash flow (either through the payment of fees, or through distributions). The funds generated through the syndication vary from market to market and year-to-year. Although 85-95¢ for each total dollar of tax credits was common in the first several years of the 21st century, recent turmoil in the financial markets has reduced some of the demand for tax breaks, meaning that investors are paying somewhat less, as of early 2008. So, for example, $10,000 credits annually for the next 10 years would be $100,000 total, and a developer could probably raise $75,000-$85,000 through syndication, which is less than could have been raised for the few years prior to 2008. Further, {{due to the fact that}} depreciation on the buildings owned by the partnership is also tax deductible, <b>and</b> that <b>depreciation</b> is allocated 99.99% to the investor, investors may pay still more for the total tax benefits. (Indeed, when the credit alone was selling for 95 cents per dollar of credit, there were some cases where investors actually paid slightly more than a dollar for a dollars worth of tax credits plus other tax benefits.) In 2014, as Congress re-evaluates [...] "tax-expenditures", the fate of the LIHTC program is questionable due to the high [...] "soft" [...] costs and relatively low investor yield.|$|R

40|$|Background and {{research}} problem discussion: The augmented globalization creates an increased need for communication {{in terms of}} language, awareness of cultural differences and domestic customs. However, financial communication, such as accounting and financial results {{is just as important}} to master. There have traditionally been two different accounting traditions in the world, the Anglo-Saxon and Continental accounting traditions. Though, during the last few decades the Continental accounting tradition has adapted parts of the, at present, dominating Anglo-Saxon tradition. For example do both of the two global accounting standard-setters FASB and IASB with their accounting frameworks US GAAP and IFRS origin from the Anglo-Saxon accounting tradition. The aim with these two standard-setters has been to regulate accounting on an international level in order to attain harmonization between the accounting systems of different countries. However, domestic accounting traditions influence the interpretation of global accounting standards and make a harmonization difficult. Accounting researchers state that increased accounting harmonization can only become efficient when all countries interpret identical standards in the same way. Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to survey the basic views on Japanese accounting from an international, in particular Swedish, perspective. Sweden has already implemented IFRS and there is an ongoing discussion in Japan about implementing the standards of IFRS to a greater extent. By focusing especially on the items revenues <b>and</b> <b>provisions,</b> the author wishes to survey how economic events related to these items are interpreted in Japan. The author’s hope with this thesis is to increase the knowledge of Japanese accounting and also to improve Japanese and Swedish companies’ financial communication. Method: The thesis is based on a qualitative study where in total four Japanese and two Swedish respondents were interviewed in their respective offices in Tokyo and Yokohama, Japan. The respondents all work for international companies in Japan and were selected because of their knowledge, experience and insight in Japanese as well as international accounting legislation. Secondary data such as the standards of IFRS, articles and academic literature developed by accounting researchers have also been used. Empirical result and conclusion: Concerning accounting practices, Japanese and Swedish revenue recognition is most likely similar and in congruence with IFRS. However, Japanese leasing, <b>depreciations</b> <b>and</b> <b>provisions</b> for paid vacation and pensions differ between the traditional Japanese accounting and that of IFRS. Compared to Sweden, Japanese depreciations on accounts receivables and inventory stocks are not practiced at the same extent as in Sweden. Finally, Japan has been influenced to a large extent by US GAAP which is more detailed than IFRS. There is therefore a risk that an implementation of IFRS may cause confusion and extra work for Japanese companies. The reason is that the principle-based framework involves a lot of judgements, which Japanese companies are not used to. Japanese companies will therefore most likely need additional external help and consultation from the accountancy/audit firms. Finally, it would most likely be favourable for all international companies if US GAAP and IFRS could unite into one global framework. It remains to be seen what will happen, but {{it is obvious that the}} larger Japanese companies are interested in taking part in the work to increase global accounting harmonization...|$|R

Introduction: Visitors at the Centennial Exhibition in 1876 were astonished on hearing {{the voices of}} friends brought to them over a wire that extended the length of Machinery Hall - a distance of but a few hundred feet. Today, {{it is possible to}} talk between Omaha and New York, a distance of fifteen hundred miles. Scarcely more than a decade ago, the telephone was regarded as a luxury. Today it has become a business and, almost a household necessity. Millions of capital are invested in the telephone industry and employment is furnished to thousands. Nearly every country village and hamlet has its telephone exchange. Farm lines extend every where. The country is being bound into one great community. Man's horizon is broadening. The telephone is bringing man into closer touch with his fellows, is fostering feelings of interdependence, and helping to unite him into one common brotherhood. For each subscriber to have facility to call up directly any other subscriber, would require so many lines as to make the scheme impracticable, if not impossible. To obviate this, some central point to which all lines converge and where connections may be made between any two of them, must be chosen. Such a point is called a Central Station or Central. The location of central {{is an important factor in}} the building and maintenance of a telephone exchange. It should be located at what is called the telephonic center. This is such a point at which all subscribers can be reached by the use of the least possible amount of wire. In the location of this point, not only present conditions but also future developments must be considered. It is evident, that the proper location of central will minimize the cost of installation, the <b>loss</b> in <b>depreciation,</b> <b>and</b> the expense of maintenance...|$|R

Images of fluorescence were taken in a lab at six combinations of emission/excitation wavelengths (F 440 /UV, F 520 /UV, F 690 /UV, F 740 /UV and F 690 /blue F 740 /blue). Data treatments include propoer image correction, interest area selection, fluorescence ratio computation and edge detection.
