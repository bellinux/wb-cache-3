40|$|This pap~r {{describes}} practical {{means of}} bypassing {{the two major}} impediments to the commercial exploitation of space. These two impediments. or constraints, are the affordability. reliability. and availability of launch vehicles on the one hand. and the affordability. availability, and flexibility of launch facilities on the other hand. As to the former, US launch vehicles are noted for their technological complexity, their high cost, and their susceptibility to Single point failures. As to the latter, our land launch facilities are costly, inadequate and congested. Schedule delays on one launch cause delays for all succeeding launches from a given launch pad. The conversion of suitable military rockets (and specifically surplus SLBMs) into satellite launch vehicles will use already paid-for assets and will minimize costs for new construction as well as rocket fuels and oxidizers. Using floating sea-launch techniques already developed, the costs of <b>launch</b> pads, <b>gantries,</b> blockhouses, high capacity water cooling systems, etc., are largely eliminated. In order to bring the cost per pound in orbit down dramatically. a US/Russian jOint venture, Sea Launch Services, has been initiated to convert Russian SLBMs into mobile floating boosters launchable from international waters...|$|R
5000|$|On Friday, 23 March 2012, Pyongyang's foreign {{ministry}} spokesman said {{preparations for the}} rocket launch [...] "have entered a full-fledged stage of action". On 26 March 2012 {{it was reported that}} the rocket was moved to a launch pad in the Sohae Launching Station using a train. The provider of high resolution satellite imagery DigitalGlobe took a photo on Wednesday, 28 March, showing what appears to be trucks near the North Korean launch pad, while a crane arm on the tower had been swung wide. A day later, on 29 March, it was reported North Korea had begun filling the rocket with liquid fuel. An analysis provided to the Associated Press by the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies on 5 April asserted that evidence suggests the first stage might be in the <b>launch</b> stand's closed <b>gantry</b> ahead of the planned launch on 12-16 April: the evidence, contained in satellite photos taken on 4 April, suggested the completion of fuelling activity, with most of the empty fuel and oxidizer tanks removed from buildings supplying the first stage, a new barricade for vehicles {{on the road to the}} pad indicating higher security, and the removal of objects near the gantry and a clean-up of the launch pad. On 10 April North Ryu Kum Chol, deputy director of the Space Development Department of the Korean Committee for Space Technology told reporters at a news conference in Yanggakdo Hotel, Pyongyang, that the launch of the three-stage rocket was on target to take place between 12 and 16 April and that all the assembly and preparations of the satellite launch were done, including fueling of the rocket. On 11 April 2012, Paek Chang Ho, head of the General Satellite Control Center, briefed journalists inside the center on Pyongyang's outskirts about the coming launch.|$|R

50|$|Construction {{began in}} earnest in April 2007, with the first {{foundations}} for the up to 18m high piers of the southbound {{part of the new}} viaduct. A bracing structure under the section carrying over the railway line was established over Easter 2009, and a 140m long, 800 ton heavy <b>launching</b> <b>gantry</b> was erected above the Newmarket skyline, which moved into place new sections and stabilised parts to be demolished (with the demolition considered {{the most difficult part of}} the project). The southbound addition was to be finished by the end of 2010, while the northbound section was expected to take at least until March 2012. During construction, sight screens reduced visual distractions of passing drivers, though the construction still required narrowing of the traffic lanes and reduction of the maximum speed on the viaduct to 70 km/h. A number of temporary support girders around the structure were also required to safely cater for the stresses put on the structure while parts of it were demolished and rebuilt.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a modelling approach {{that can be}} used by contractors to plan elevated highway reconstruction projects. The proposed model estimates the project duration, productivity rate of the operation, and visualizes the output using 4 D modelling. In this paper, {{the focus is on the}} demolition and construction of a box girder elevated highways as part of an interchange reconstruction project. The demolition method of the elevated highway’s superstructure is done by cutting and lifting. In this method, the elevated highway’s spans that have been cut are taken down by a crane. <b>Launching</b> <b>gantry</b> is used for full span precast box girder erection. Discrete event simulation is used to develop the simulation templates to mimic the elevated highway reconstruction processes. The templates are implemented in STROBOSCOPE. The developed templates can be used to determine the production rate, and duration of an elevated highway reconstruction project. Activity durations are linked with the 3 D model to generate a 4 D model using specialized software. The 4 D model is used for visualization and analysis of highway reconstruction, which can help in resolving constructability issues. A case study is presented to validate and demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach...|$|E
