50|$|Muromachi period (1392-1568): Folding screens {{became more}} popular and {{were found in}} many residences, dojos, and shops. The two-panel byōbu were common, and {{overlapped}} paper hinges substituted for Zenigata, which made them lighter to carry, easier to fold, and stronger at the joints. This technique allowed the depictions in the byōbu to be uninterrupted by panel vertical borders, which prompted artists to paint sumptuous, often monochromatic, nature-themed scenes and landscapes of famous Japanese locales. The paper hinges, although quite strong, required that the panel infrastructure be as light as possible. Softwood lattices were constructed using special bamboo nails that allowed for the lattice to be planed along its edges to be straight, square, and {{the same size as}} the other panels of the byōbu. The lattices were coated with one or more layers of paper stretched across the lattice surface like a drum head to provide a flat and strong backing for the paintings that would be later mounted on the byōbu. The resulting structure was lightweight and durable, yet still quite vulnerable. If you poke your finger into the surface of a panel and you miss a <b>lattice</b> <b>member,</b> your finger will likely pass clear through to the other side. After the paintings and brocade were attached, a lacquered wood frame (typically black or dark red) was applied to protect the outer perimeter of the byōbu, and intricately decorated metal hardware (strips, right angles, and studs) were applied to the frame to protect the lacquer.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{a design}} {{to allow a}} {{substantial}} bridge to be made from planks employing lower - skilled labor, rather than heavy timbers and more expensive carpenters, this type of bridge has also been constructed using {{a large number of}} relatively light iron or steel members. The individual elements are more easily handled by the construction workers, but the bridge also requires substantial support during construction. A simple lattice truss will transform the applied loads into a thrust, as the bridge will tend to change length under load. This is resisted by pinning the <b>lattice</b> <b>members</b> to the top and bottom chords, which are more substantial than the <b>lattice</b> <b>members,</b> but which may also be fabricated from relatively small elements rather than large beams.|$|R
50|$|The Tilton Island Park Bridge is a foot {{bridge in}} Tilton, New Hampshire. It spans {{a portion of}} the Winnipesaukee River just east of {{downtown}} Tilton, providing access to Tilton Island Park, located on an island in the river. The bridge was manufactured by A. D. Briggs & Company and installed in 1881 by J. R. Smith. It consists of two Truesdell truss spans, which rest on granite abutments and a central granite pier. The bridge is 85 ft in length, and 10 ft wide. Its trusses are made of iron, using a patented design similar to that of Ithiel Town for wooden lattice bridges. The principal innovation in Lucius Truesdell's patent was the clamps which fix the <b>lattice</b> <b>members</b> together where they cross, providing additional rigidity, and a series of horizontal and vertical members which are integrated into the diagonal <b>lattice</b> <b>members.</b> The bridge was a gift to the town by Charles Tilton.|$|R

40|$|No {{rational}} column formula has {{yet been}} developed which gives results which are sufficiently precise {{for the design of}} airplane members, and consequently it is necessary to fall back upon experimental testing. In order to derive the maximum benefit from experiments, however, it is necessary that the experiments be guided by theory. It is the object here to modify existing formulae that may be obtained with a minimum number of tests. A discussion is given that is limited to the case of a simple column supported at both ends and subjected to uniformly distributed loads perpendicular to its axis and to end loads either axially or eccentrically applied. Discussed here are forces in the bracing of latticed columns, the application of theory to practical columns, loads in <b>lattice</b> <b>members,</b> and the strength of individual lattices...|$|R

The bending strength of the footing is also checked. The influences of eccentricity between the chord <b>members</b> and the <b>lattice</b> <b>members</b> are taken into account.

40|$|When {{building}} a new block of a health and recreation center, designer metal structures {{were used in the}} roofing coverage. The over covered three storey building consists of two blocks. It has a variable height and a mixed framework. Both building blocks were over covered with structural lattice roofing of similar design. When designing spatial structural roofing, the authors proposed a new design concept. The novelty of the design {{lies in the fact that}} a modified flat truss is used as the basic assembly unit of a spatial structure. To develop a spatial structure design the roof-girder trusses with continuous chords from rolled I-beams and a lattice from roll-welded sections with non gusset joists were used. They are well-known and work well in practice. When designing structural roofing, previously known trusses of the mentioned design were slightly modified. In particular, trusses with parallel chords were given greater camber (2. 5 % instead of 1. 5 %), the design of a supporting truss joist was changed and fixing elements for chord and <b>lattice</b> <b>members</b> joining trusses into a spatial structure were added to truss joists...|$|R

40|$|The {{design for}} fatigue for {{offshore}} wind turbine structures is characterized by uncertainty, resulting from both loading specifications and numerical modelling. At the same time, fatigue is a main design driver {{for this type of}} structures. This study presents a strategy to monitor the accumulated fatigue damage in real-time, employing a joint input-state estimation algorithm. Measuring the operational vibrations at well-chosen locations enables the estimation of strain responses at unmeasured locations. The estimation algorithm is applied to a wind turbine on a lattice support structure, for which the response estimates of the <b>lattice</b> <b>members</b> are based on measurements on the turbine tower only. This restriction follows from the difficulty to reliably and robustly measure at locations on the lattice structure. Artificial measurement data is generated with a full-order finite element model, while the strains are estimated with an erroneous reduced-order design model, after inclusion of measurement noise. The strain estimates show that the main frequency content can be captured relatively accurately, except for a small bias and some high frequency disturbance, corresponding to a weakly observable higher mode. This second aspect shows the importance of a trade-off between the accuracy of the reduced-order finite element model and the ill-conditioning of the observability matrix.

50|$|The {{main and}} {{longitudinal}} girders {{have been designed}} as welded <b>lattice</b> steel <b>members</b> of sufficient depth to incorporate the access walkways. In addition to transferring the roof load to the columns these girders also have the 'V' strain insulators attached to them. The side framing of the building as well as carrying the wall cladding also supports the wall bushings and provides anchorage for the strainer connections between the turbine house and the switch house. The switch house was designed so as to fit in the architectural treatment of the Power Station as a whole. The plastic-coated aluminium cladding is therefore coloured black on {{the north and south}} faces of the building and gold on the east and west. The roof line of the switch house is designed to blend with the 'saw tooth' effect on the turbine house roof. Construction work began in the severely cold winter of 1962/63. The cold weather was turned to advantage as the clay subsoil which is generally unmanageable when wet was frozen solid. Excavation went on uninterrupted on drainage branches during this period. The wet mix base was next introduced over all the site. The object of the wet mix was to apply a firm layer for the construction to be carried on even when subsoil clay was wet. Construction traffic also tended to compact the wet mix therefore improving it as a base for the final topcoat of bitumen macadam.|$|R
40|$|MAP 1 -family {{proteins}} are classical microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) {{that bind}} along the microtubule <b>lattice.</b> The founding <b>members,</b> MAP 1 A and MAP 1 B, are predominantly expressed in neurons, {{where they are}} thought to be important in the formation and development of axons and dendrites. Mammalian genomes usually contain three family members, MAP 1 A, MAP 1 B and a shorter, more recently identified gene called MAP 1 S. By contrast, only one family member, Futsch, is found in Drosophila. After their initial expression, the MAP 1 A and MAP 1 B polypeptides are cleaved into light and heavy chains, which are then assembled into mature complexes together with the separately encoded light chain 3 subunit (LC 3). Both MAP 1 A and MAP 1 B are well known for their microtubule-stabilizing activity, but MAP 1 proteins can also interact with other cellular components, including filamentous actin and signaling proteins. Furthermore, the activity of MAP 1 A and MAP 1 B is controlled by upstream signaling mechanisms, including the MAP kinase and glycogen synthase kinase- 3 � pathways.

40|$|R. Dedekind {{introduced}} the modular law, a lattice equation true {{in most of}} the lattices associated with classical algebraic systems, see [4]. Although this law {{is one of the most}} important tools for working with these lattices, it does not fully describe the equational properties of these lattices. This was made clear in [8] where B. Jónsson and the author showed that if any modular congruence variety actually satisfies the (stronger) Arguesian law. (A congruence variety is the variety generated by all the congruence <b>lattices</b> of the <b>members</b> of a variety of algebras.) In this note we show that no finite set of lattice equations is strong enough to describe the equational properties of the lattices associated with classical algebraic systems in the following strong sense: there is no modular, nondistributive congruence variety which has a finite basis for its equational theory. This question was posed by George McNulty in the problem session on lattice theory at the Jónsson symposium. Jónsson had asked a similar question in [17]. He asked, in Problem 9. 12, whether there is a nontrivial variety whose congruence variety is neither the variety of all lattices nor the variety of all distributive lattices...|$|R
40|$|A {{recently}} recognized {{application of}} lattice materials is shape morphing technology, where a structure {{is expected to}} take a predefined shape in response to a change in environmental (temperature, pressure, etc.) or loading conditions. In a shape morphing structure that uses a 2 D lattice material as the basis, one or more struts in the lattice are replaced by actuators. The shape of the structure is then changed by extending or shortening the lengths of these actuators. The shape morphing structure is stiff against external loads, yet triggering an actuator to morph the structure’s shape results in a minimal amount of internal energy storage. In the last two decades, most of the studies in shape morphing technology have focused on the Kagome lattice materials, which have superior properties such as in-plane isotropy, high specific stiffness and strength, and low energy requirement for actuation of its truss <b>members.</b> The Kagome <b>lattice</b> is a <b>member</b> of a large family of (semi-) regular tessellations of the plane. Two fundamental questions naturally arise: 1) What makes a lattice material suitable for actuation? 2) Are there other tessellations more effective than the Kagome lattice for actuation? This research tackles both questions, by comparing an alternative lattice material, the hexagonal cupola, with the Kagome lattice in terms of mechanical/actuation properties. Finally, a new criterion is formulated that will hopefully further facilitate the future search for lattice materials suitable for actuation.

5000|$|According {{to bridge}} {{historian}} Nathan Holth,Bowstring bridges {{are one of}} the rarest types of truss bridges, and most date in the 1870s. They fell out of favor due to the limited weight they could support. Any bowstring truss bridge that survives today is a miracle. Truss bridges are always intricate structures, but bowstring trusses are even more so. There are <b>lattice,</b> v-lacing, and <b>members</b> all over. This large amount of complexity is balanced by the simple, graceful appearance of the arched top chord. The result is a bridge with incomparable beauty and appeal.Among the rarest and oldest bridges in Canada is this breathtaking iron bowstring truss. Keystone Columns form the top chord. A sidewalk on the south side appears to be original.The bridge has undergone extensive repairs and modifications. Most notably, the top chord has had plates of steel welded {{to the top of the}} column. Numerous rods and bars have been welded onto many of the vertical and diagonal members as well. A couple of added bars of steel run lengthwise through the middle of the truss. These modifications have affected the historic integrity of the bridge, but have no doubt helped keep it standing over 130 years. The original lattice guardrails remain on the sidewalk, albeit with a metal pole welded above them.The deck surface (see illus. gallery below) is presently of renewable planking: a double file of approximately one-thousand, five hundred eight-foot two-by-fours each, on edge, upon a framework of nine longitudinally laid stringers of one-foot iron I-beams, topped with bolted-on wooden cladding, whose ends rest on the two abutments. Attached beneath these are fifteen transverse floor-beams, from which vertical lattice pillars, under tension, translate the live thrusts of traffic to the bowed upper chord, which transfers this back as tension along the bottom-chord [...] "string" [...] of the bow. This bottom chord consists of two sets of four 10 cm x 3 cm wrought-iron eyebars, running along, outside, both sides of the deck. Although originally two-lane, due to the weight and frequency of modern traffic, the Blackfriars is at present two-way but single-lane. Because of damage to the wooden deck surface and to the iron structure, it has been closed to automobile traffic since 2013.|$|R
