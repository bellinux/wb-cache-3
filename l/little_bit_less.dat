25|$|The Soviet 23rd Army {{joined the}} {{offensive}} {{by attempting to}} break through the Finnish lines between Tali and Vuoksi towards Noskua but the repeated Soviet attacks were halted by the highly efficient Finnish artillery. In the end the battle of Tali-Ihantala was a defensive strategic victory for the Finnish army. It blocked the possibility for the Soviet army to break through to the Finnish heartland and the road to Helsinki. Soviet military losses peaked at 28 June when Leningrad Front reported to have lost during that single day over 5 000 soldiers including 1 800 killed in action, over 25% more than in 14 June when they reported to have lost almost 4 000 (including <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>less</b> than 700 killed in action). Especially Finnish artillery concentrated deadly firepower with even 250 artillery pieces sending 2,000 shells to one small target size of just 6 hectares in one minute. Red Army units saw no chances to penetrate through this fire power. The terrain favored the defenders forcing Soviet armor units to narrow death traps.Finnish radio inquiries captured lots of vital important plans of Red Army giving data for joint-fire artillery- air power counterattacks.|$|E

[...] In an interview with Digital Spy, Taylor York stated [...] "I don't think we've ever been so proud and satisfied with something we've done."

2500|$|Street musicians {{began to}} breakdance in Yoyogi Park, {{including}} DJ Krush {{who has become}} a world-renowned DJ after arising from the Yoyogi Park scene. In 1986 an all hip hop club opened in Shibuya. While interest in hip-hop in Japan grew some during the 1980s and early 1990s, the rap scene remained fairly small and rather marginalized. One reason for the rap scene to remain so small and a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>less</b> popular compared to hip hop {{is because of the}} fact that the Japanese language does [...] "not contain stress accents and sentences must end with one of a few simple verb endings." [...] Ito Seiko, Chikado Haruo, Tinnie Punx and Takagi Kan were rappers that emerged from Japan at this time, and they proved to be rather successful.|$|E
6000|$|Here's {{your letter}} {{first thing in}} the morning, while I'm sipping my coffee in the midst of such {{confusion}} as I've not often achieved at my best. The little room, which I think is as nearly as possible the size of your study, but with a lower roof, has to begin with--A, my bed; B, my basin stand; C, my table; D, my chest of drawers; thus arranged in relation to E, the window (which has still its dark bars to prevent the little boy getting out); F, the fireplace; G, the golden or mineralogical cupboard; and H, the grand entrance. The two dots with a back represent my chair, which is properly solid and not un-easy. Three others of lighter disposition find place somewhere about. These with the chimney-piece and drawer's head are covered, or rather heaped, with all they can carry, and the morning is just looking in, astonished to see what is expected of it, and smiling--(yes, I may fairly say it is smiling, for it is cloudless for its part above the smoke of the horizon line)--at Sarah's hope and mine, of ever getting that room into order by twelve o'clock. The chimney-piece with its bottles, spoons, lozenge boxes, matches, candlesticks, and letters jammed behind them, does appear to me entirely hopeless, and this the more because Sarah,[45] when I tell her to take a bottle away that has a mixture in it which I don't like, looks me full in the face, and says [...] "she won't, because I may want it." [...] I submit, because it is so nice to get Sarah to look one full in the face. She really is the prettiest, round faced, and round eyed girl I ever saw, and it's a great shame she should be a housemaid; only I wish she would take those bottles away. She says I'm looking better to-day, and I think I'm feeling a little bit more,--no, I mean, a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>less</b> demoniacal. But I still can do that jackdaw beautifully.|$|E
