This was attained through positive, faith-filled speech; the spoken word of God allowed believers to appropriate the same spiritual power that God used to create the world and attain the provisions promised in Christ's death and resurrection. Prayer was understood to be a binding, <b>legal</b> <b>act.</b> Rather than asking, Kenyon taught believers to demand healing since they were already legally entitled to receive it.|$|E

In fact, it was an institution in decline by this time (since the 1880s the country began to attract European immigrant labor instead). Brazil was the last nation in the Western world to abolish slavery, and by abolition had imported an estimated total of four million slaves from Africa. This was 40% of all slaves shipped to the Americas.|$|E

Likewise the land rent payable was symbolised by the passing of a bowl of grass and the tithe as a bowl full of grain.

None of the Company's other zemindars are permitted to maintain them; and even our ally, the Nabob of the Carnatic, has the Company's troops in all his garrisons.
