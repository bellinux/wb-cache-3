50|$|The slash rating, {{under the}} United States National Electrical Code, {{is given to}} circuit {{interrupt}} hardware and specifies a maximum <b>line-to-ground</b> <b>voltage</b> rating in combination with a maximum line-to-line voltage rating. One common application would be for a three-phase electrical loads. For example a 120/240V rating can disqualify a circuit breaker for use with a delta system load that would otherwise work with a wye system load.|$|E
40|$|The first {{industrial}} {{demonstration of}} a three-phase high-temperature superconducting transmission power cable at the Southwire manufacturing complex is in progress. One crucial issue during {{operation of the}} 30 -m HTS cables is whether they could survive the fault current (which can be over {{an order of magnitude}} higher than the operating current) {{in the event of a}} short-circuit fault and how HTS cables and the cryogenic system would respond. Simulated fault-current tests were performed at ORNL on a 5 -m cable. This single-phase cable was constructed in the same way as the 30 -m cables and is also rated for 1250 A at 7. 2 kV ac <b>line-to-ground</b> <b>voltage.</b> Tests were performed with fault-current pulses of up to 15 kA (for 0. 5 s) with pulse lengths of up to 5 s (at 6. 8 kA). Although a large voltage drop was produced across the HTS cable during the fault-current pulse, no significant changes in the coolant temperature, pressure, or joint resistance were observed. The cable survived 15 simulated fault-current shots without any degradation in its V-I characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. In {{the paper}} there are {{described}} methods {{of two and}} three voltmeter readouts for insulation resistance periodic measurement in live DC and AC/DC IT networks. A new measuring method for AC/DC networks is proposed. Application of a novel algorithm for shortening of measurement cycle is explained. Methodology. All methods of two and three voltmeter readouts consist in connection of a resistor and measurement of mean value of network’s fixed point-to-ground voltages. Results. A new algorithm implemented in KDZ- 3 device enables determination of steady-state voltage of a DC network’s pole much faster than in other exploited systems. Originality. In author’s modification of two voltmeter readouts method, <b>line-to-ground</b> <b>voltage</b> mean value is measured at AC side of AC/DC network. This innovation has not been applied for implementation of periodic insulation monitoring in AC/DC IT networks yet. Practical value. The use of author’s innovation will allow to execute measurements at AC side of AC/DC IT networks which might be necessary if rectifier’s output circuits are unavailable. Shortening of measurement cycle duration {{of two or three}} voltmeter readouts method’s is of great importance in networks with high capacitance...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of a computer-controlled current-comparator-based test system for calibrating high-voltage revenue metering equipment under actual operating conditions of high voltage/high current with sinusoidal or nonsinusoidal voltage and current waveforms is described. Measurements can be made at any power factor from zero lead or lag through unity, at <b>line-to-ground</b> <b>voltages</b> up to 100 kV and currents up to 2000 A. The magnitude and phase uncertainties (k = 2) of the new calibration system {{are estimated to be}} not more than 100 3 ̆bcW/VA and 100 3 ̆bcrad, and 200 3 ̆bcW/VA and 200 3 ̆bcrad for sinusoidal and nonsinusoidal conditions, respectively. The calibration system can be used in the laboratory or on-site in high-voltage substations. 9 2006 IEEE. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} propose a simple model-based {{methodology}} for faults identification and location in electrical distribution systems. Its ease allows the implementation on a micro-controller based apparatus {{to be installed}} at each Medium Voltage substation. The model {{is based on a}} lumped parameters representation of each span of line that can be affected by a fault. The input electrical features are unsynchronized line currents and line-to-line voltages and at the two ends of each span of line. Using line-to-line <b>voltages</b> instead than <b>line-to-ground</b> <b>voltages,</b> as suggested by many authors, brings a big benefit because the value of the reference ground voltage, especially at distribution level, can be affected by large uncertainties. The paper describes the proposed two-end algorithm that allows the location and identification of faults and finally in the application section some test results based on simulations are reported...|$|R
