5|$|Surprisingly, Schneider {{was traded}} to the New Jersey Devils on June 30, 2013, {{reinstating}} Luongo in the starting position for the 2013–14 NHL season. John Tortorella, who had replaced Alain Vigneault as Canucks head coach after the conclusion of the 2012–13 season, chose rookie Eddie Läck to start in goal instead of Luongo in the Heritage Classic against the Ottawa Senators at BC Place. Tortorella's decision was unpopular with the crowd as they booed Läck, while Luongo was also unhappy as he had been <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> game all season.|$|E
500|$|Author Rikky Rooksby, in {{his book}} The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, noted that the song closed the Madonna album on a flat note. He called the music artificial, {{repetitive}} and uninspired. Don Shewey from Rolling Stone commented that [...] "At first, it [...] doesn't sound like much at all. Then you notice its one distinguishing feature, a girlish hiccup that the singer uses over and over until it's irritating as hell. Finally, you get hooked, and you start <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> silly little catch in her voice." [...] Author J. Randy Taraborrelli in his [...] commented that the song was a rhythmic call to party.|$|E
2500|$|Despite his {{retirement}} from international cricket, Langer opted {{to continue to}} play first-class cricket, with Somerset announcing {{on the same day}} that Langer had agreed to return to the English county in 2007 as captain.

6000|$|... (1) Don't use a noun {{and then}} an {{adjective}} that crosses out the noun. An adjective qualifies, it cannot contradict.

[...] Don't say, [...] "I <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> larger religion that shall have no special dogmas." [...] It is like saying, [...] "I <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> larger quadruped who shall have no feet." [...] A quadruped means something with four feet; and a religion means something that commits a man to some doctrine about the universe.

60|$|I took a taste. Delicious!

60|$|The Archduchess' {{letter was}} evidently written under the {{influence}} of agitated feelings. We omit it; because, as the mystery of her character is now explained, a great portion of her communication would be irrelevant to our tale. She spoke of her exalted station as a woman, that station which so many women envy, in a spirit of agonising bitterness. A royal princess is only the most flattered of state victims. She is a political sacrifice, by which enraged Governments are appeased, wavering allies conciliated and ancient amities confirmed. Debarred by her rank and her education from <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> exchange of equal affection which is the great end and charm of female existence, no individual finds more fatally and feels more keenly that pomp is not felicity, and splendour not content.|$|E
60|$|MRS LUTESTRING. You, Mr President, {{were born}} {{intoxicated}} {{with your own}} well-fed natural exuberance. You cannot imagine what alcohol was to an underfed poor woman. I had carefully arranged my little savings so that I could get drunk, as we called it, once a week; and my only pleasure was <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> poor little debauch. That is what saved me from suicide. I {{could not bear to}} miss my next carouse. But when I stopped working, and lived on my pension, the fatigue of my life's drudgery began to wear off, because, you see, I was not really old. I recuperated. I looked younger and younger. And at last I was rested enough to have courage and strength to begin life again. Besides, political changes were making it easier: life was a little better worth living for the nine-tenths of the people who used to be mere drudges. After that, I never turned back or faltered. My only regret now is that I shall die when I am three hundred or thereabouts. There was only one thing that made life hard; and that is gone now.|$|E
60|$|When she {{was alone}} she too shed her tears, though she felt {{impatient}} and vexed with herself as they came into her eyes. It was not perhaps only for her lost love that she wept. Had no one known that her love had been given and then lost she might have borne it without weeping. But now, in carrying on this vain affair of hers, in devoting herself to a lover who had, with her own consent, passed away from her, she had spent the sweet fresh years of her youth, and all those who knew her would know {{that it had been}} so. He had told her that it would be her fate to purchase for herself a husband with her beauty. It might be so. At any rate she did not doubt her own beauty. But, if it were to be so, then the romance and the charm of her life were gone. She had quite agreed that six hundred a year, and lodgings in Marylebone, would be quite unendurable; but what was there left for her that would be endurable? He could be happy with the prospect of Gertrude Tringle's money. She could not be happy, <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> unloved husband who was to be purchased by her beauty.|$|E

6000|$|At {{the best}} of times this is not a gay world, though no doubt we ought to pretend that {{humanity}} at large is as happy as it is represented to be in, let us say, the Christmas number of an illustrated paper. How well we can imagine the thoughtful inhabitant of this country Anno Domini 7500 or thereabouts disinterring from the crumbling remains of a fireproof safe a Christmas number of the /Illustrated London News/ or the /Graphic/. The archaic letters would perhaps be unintelligible to him, but he would look at the pictures with much the same interest that we regard bushmen's drawings or the primitive clay figures of Peru, and though his whole artistic seventy-sixth century soul would be revolted at the crudeness of the colouring, surely he would moralise thus: [...] "Oh, happy race of primitive men, how I, the child of light and civilisation, envy you your long-forgotten days! Here in these rude drawings, which in themselves reveal the extraordinary capacity for pleasure possessed by the early races, who could look upon them and gather gratification from the sight, may we trace your joyous career from the cradle to the grave. Here you figure as a babe, at whose appearance everybody seems delighted, even those of your race whose inheritance will be thereby diminished--and here a merry lad you revel in the school which the youth of our age finds so wearisome. There, grown more old, you stand at the altar of a beautiful lost faith, a faith that told of hope and peace beyond the grave, and by you stands your blushing bride. No hard fate, no considerations of means, no worldly-mindedness, come to snatch you from her arms as now they daily do. With her you spend your peaceful days, and here at last we see you old but surrounded by love and tender kindness, and almost <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> grave which you believed would be but the gate of glory. Oh, happy race of simple-minded men, what a commentary upon our fevered, avaricious, pleasure-seeking age is this rude scroll of primitive and infantile art!" ...|$|E
