5|$|After {{returning}} to Okinawa in July, Guam {{was assigned to}} Cruiser Task Force 95, where she served as the flagship, along with her sister Alaska, {{under the command of}} Rear Admiral Francis S. Low. On 16 July, Guam and Alaska conducted a sweep into the East China and Yellow Seas to sink Japanese shipping. They had only <b>limited</b> <b>success,</b> however, and returned to the fleet on 23 July. They then joined a major raid, which included three battleships and three escort carriers, into the estuary of the Yangtze River off Shanghai. Again, the operation met with <b>limited</b> <b>success,</b> and they returned to Okinawa by 7 August.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{had sold}} two million copies by August 2008, Here I Stand {{was seen as}} a {{commercial}} failure relative to Confessions, which had sold nineteen million copies. Tyler Lewis of PopMatters put the album's <b>limited</b> <b>success</b> down to Usher's and Foster's marriage; he believed that Usher's fans disliked Foster.|$|E
5|$|Alaska then {{returned}} to Ulithi to resupply, arriving on 14 May. She was then assigned to TG 38.4, the reorganized carrier task force. The fleet {{then returned}} to Okinawa, where Alaska continued in her anti-aircraft defense role. On 9 June, she and Guam bombarded Oki Daitō. TG 38.4 then steamed to San Pedro Bay in the Leyte Gulf for rest and maintenance; the ship remained there from 13 June until 13 July, when she was assigned to Cruiser Task Force 95 along with her sister Guam, {{under the command of}} Rear Admiral Francis S.

50|$|The {{privateer}} {{then went}} on to Santo Domingo, where he engaged another fort, and later sailed on to Margarita. On 22 February he arrived at Pampatar, which he took easily, and disembarked in a village now called Porlamar. But these <b>limited</b> <b>successes</b> did not recompense the outlay made in the equipping of his fleet.|$|R
50|$|After the war {{however, the}} club had only <b>limited</b> <b>successes,</b> {{playing in the}} Kreisliga Hessen but never quite making it through to the German finals.

They were relegated from the new-founded Gauliga Südwest/Mainhessen in their first year.|$|R

5|$|Charles V of France {{maintained}} {{the terms of}} the treaty of Brétigny but encouraged others in Aquitaine to challenge the authority of the Plantagenets in Aquitaine. The prince, who had suffered a debilitating illness for nearly a decade which often restricted his movement to being carried in a litter, returned to England, where he soon died. John of Gaunt assumed leadership in France with <b>limited</b> <b>success,</b> and peace negotiations over several years were inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the initial}} success in driving the Taliban from power in Kabul, by early 2003 the Taliban was regrouping, {{amassing}} new funds and recruits. The 2005 failure of Operation Red Wings {{showed that the}} Taliban had returned. In 2006, the Taliban insurgency appeared larger, fiercer and better organized than expected, with large-scale allied offensives such as Operation Mountain Thrust attaining <b>limited</b> <b>success.</b> As a result, Bush commissioned 3,500 additional troops to the country in March 2007.|$|E
5|$|Following Quatermass, writer Nigel Kneale {{developed}} the sitcom Kinvig (1981) for London Weekend Television. During the 1980s he was courted for scripts by admiring Hollywood directors and producers such as John Carpenter, John Landis and Joe Dante, but with <b>limited</b> <b>success.</b> Returning to television, he adapted Susan Hill's novel The Woman in Black (1989) and wrote episodes of Sharpe and Kavanagh QC.

25|$|In the {{semi-autonomous}} Free City of Kraków, patriotic Polish {{intellectuals and}} nobles (szlachta) had made {{plans for a}} general uprising in partitioned Poland, intending to reestablish an independent Poland. A similar uprising of nobility was planned in Poznań, but police quickly caught the ringleaders. The Kraków Uprising began {{on the night of}} February 20, and initially met with <b>limited</b> <b>successes.</b>|$|R
5|$|French and Wabanaki Confederacy raiding {{activity}} {{continued in}} northern Massachusetts in 1705, {{against which the}} English colonists were unable to mount an effective defense. The raids happened too quickly for defensive forces to organize, and reprisal raids usually found tribal camps and settlements empty. There was a lull in the raiding while the French and English leaders negotiated the exchange of prisoners, with only <b>limited</b> <b>success.</b> Raids by Indians persisted {{until the end of}} the war, sometimes with French participation.|$|E
5|$|In 1849 James Goodhue began {{publication}} of the Minnesota Pioneer newspaper in Saint Paul (the paper would later be renamed the St. Paul Pioneer Press). By the time the area achieved statehood 89 newspapers had been established. Information about Minnesota published in these periodicals spread throughout the United States and Europe. Advertising campaigns were launched in the northeastern U.S. and Europe to lure European settlers. These efforts met with <b>limited</b> <b>success</b> though they would become much more successful after statehood.|$|E

5|$|In the offseason, Hillis {{signed as}} a free agent with the Kansas City Chiefs after a lackluster season and {{unsuccessful}} contract talks with the Browns. In the 2012 draft, the Browns chose running back Trent Richardson with the third selection and took quarterback Brandon Weeden with the 22nd pick. Weeden was expected to replace McCoy at quarterback after McCoy's <b>limited</b> <b>success</b> in one and a half seasons as the starter.|$|E
5|$|Several {{antibiotics}} {{have been}} used successfully to treat S.iniae infection in fish. Enrofloxacin, a quinolone antibiotic, {{has been used to}} great effect in hybrid striped bass (Morone chrysops× M.saxatilis), although evidence suggested the development of a resistant strain. Amoxicillin, erythromycin, furazolidone, and oxytetracycline have also been used (the last with varying success, only in barramundi). Vaccination against S.iniae has been attempted with <b>limited</b> <b>success</b> as it only provides up to 6 months' immunity.|$|E
5|$|The Luftwaffe was to {{spearhead}} {{the aerial}} {{battle in the}} low countries. Its first task was {{the elimination of the}} Belgian air contingent. Despite an overwhelming numerical superiority of 1,375 aircraft, 957 of which were serviceable, the air campaign in Belgium had <b>limited</b> <b>success</b> overall on the first day. At roughly 04:00, the first air raids were conducted against airfields and communication centres. It still had a tremendous impact on the AéMI, which had only 179 aircraft on 10 May.|$|E

A {{review of the}} literature indicated that the major factors <b>limiting</b> <b>success</b> of overwater nests were fluctuating water levels, nest parasitism, predation, and human disturbance.

The Liberals won five consecutive majorities between 1935 and 1953. The Liberals worked closely with the civil service (drawing several of their ministers from those ranks) and their years of dominance saw prosperity.|$|E
5|$|Trending {{topics are}} {{sometimes}} {{the result of}} concerted efforts and manipulations by preteen and teenaged fans of certain celebrities or cultural phenomena, particularly musicians like Lady Gaga (known as Little Monsters), Justin Bieber (Beliebers), Rihanna (Rih Navy) and One Direction (Directioners), and novel series Twilight (Twihards) and Harry Potter (Potterheads).

5|$|A {{wide range}} of laws were invoked {{in the process of}} the suppression, from general treason to charges of book burning or {{demolishing}} houses, a process complicated by the relatively narrow definition of treason at the time. The use of informants and denunciations became common, causing fear to spread across the country; by November at least 1,500 people had been executed or killed in battle. Many of those who had lost property in the revolt attempted to seek legal compensation, and John of Gaunt made particular efforts to track down those responsible for destroying his Savoy Palace. Most had only <b>limited</b> <b>success,</b> as the defendants were rarely willing to attend court. The last of these cases was resolved in 1387.|$|E
