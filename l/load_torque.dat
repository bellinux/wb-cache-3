25|$|When {{used with}} a load that has a torque curve that {{increases}} with speed, the motor will operate at the speed where the torque developed by the motor {{is equal to the}} <b>load</b> <b>torque.</b> Reducing the load will cause the motor to speed up, and increasing the load will cause the motor to slow down until the load and motor torque are equal. Operated in this manner, the slip losses are dissipated in the secondary resistors and can be very significant. The speed regulation and net efficiency is also very poor.|$|E
25|$|A {{synchronous}} {{electric motor}} is an AC motor distinguished by a rotor spinning with coils passing magnets {{at the same}} rate as the AC and resulting in a magnetic field that drives it. Another way of saying this is that it has zero slip under usual operating conditions. Contrast this with an induction motor, which must slip to produce torque. One type of synchronous motor is like an induction motor except the rotor is excited by a DC field. Slip rings and brushes are used to conduct current to the rotor. The rotor poles connect to each other and move at the same speed hence the name synchronous motor. Another type, for low <b>load</b> <b>torque,</b> has flats ground onto a conventional squirrel-cage rotor to create discrete poles. Yet another, such as made by Hammond for its pre-World War II clocks, and in the older Hammond organs, has no rotor windings and discrete poles. It is not self-starting. The clock requires manual starting by a small knob on the back, while the older Hammond organs had an auxiliary starting motor connected by a spring-loaded manually operated switch.|$|E

500|$|In variable-torque {{applications}} {{suited for}} Volts-per-Hertz (V/Hz) drive control, AC motor characteristics {{require that the}} voltage magnitude of the inverter's output to the motor be adjusted to match the required <b>load</b> <b>torque</b> in a linear V/Hz relationship. For example, for 460V, 60Hz motors, this linear V/Hz relationship is [...] 460/60 = 7.67V/Hz. While suitable in wide-ranging applications, V/Hz control is sub-optimal in high-performance applications involving low speed or demanding, dynamic speed regulation, positioning, and reversing load requirements. Some V/Hz control drives can also operate in quadratic V/Hz mode or can even be programmed to suit special multi-point V/Hz paths.|$|E

5000|$|Over a motor's {{normal load}} range, the torque's slope is {{approximately}} linear or proportional to slip because {{the value of}} rotor resistance divided by slip, , dominates torque in linear manner.

50|$|The motor {{continues}} to increase its speed until the motor torque and the <b>load</b> <b>torque</b> balance each other and a steady speed is achieved. At this stage switch 2 is opened and momentarily the motor is supplied by even lower voltage, because the windings of the autotransformer act as inductors connected in series with motor.

40|$|The {{roll forming}} process is {{increasingly}} {{used in the}} automotive industry for the manufacture of structural and crash components from Ultra High Strength Steel (UHSS). Due to the high strength of UHSS (< 1 GPa) even small and commonly observed material property variations from coil to coil can result in significant changes in material yield and through that affect the final shape of the roll formed component. This requires the re-adjustment of tooling to compensate for shape defects and maintain part geometry resulting in costly downtimes of equipment. This paper presents a first step towards an in-line shape compensation method that based on the monitoring of roll <b>load</b> and <b>torque</b> allows for the estimation of shape defects and the subsequent re-adjustment of tooling for compensation. For this the effect of material property variation on common shape defects observed in the roll forming process as well as measurable process parameters such as roll <b>load</b> and <b>torque</b> needs to be understood. The effect of yield strength and material hardening on roll <b>load</b> and <b>torque</b> as well as longitudinal bow is investigated via experimental trials and numerical analysis. A regression analysis combined with Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) techniques is employed to establish {{the relationships between the}} process and material parameters and to determine their percentage influence on longitudinal bow, roll <b>load</b> and <b>torque.</b> The study will show that the level of longitudinal bow, one of the major shape defects observed in roll forming, can be estimated by variations in roll <b>load</b> and <b>torque...</b>|$|R

40|$|Numerical {{estimation}} of rolling <b>load</b> and <b>torque</b> often showed large discrepancies {{when compared with}} experimental values.
