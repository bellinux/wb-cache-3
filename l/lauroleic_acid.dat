30|$|Microorganisms {{produce a}} great variety of {{secondary}} metabolites that feature surface active and bioactive properties. Those possessing an amphiphilc molecular structure are also termed biosurfactant and are of great interest due to their often unique properties. Rouxiella sp. DSM  100043 is a gram negative enterobacter isolated from peat-bog soil and described as a new biosurfactant producing species in this study. Rouxiella sp. produces glycolipids, biosurfactants with a carbohydrate moiety in its structure. This study characterizes the composition of glycolipids with different hydrophobicities that have been produced during cultivation in a bioreactor and been extracted and purified from separated foam. Using two dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the hydrophilic moieties are elucidated as glucose with various acylation sites and as talose within the most polar glycolipids. The presence of 3 ′ hydroxy <b>lauroleic</b> <b>acid</b> as well as myristic and myristoleic acid has been detected.|$|E
30|$|Two {{dimensional}} NMR spectroscopy measurements {{revealed the}} presence of 3 ′ hydroxyl <b>lauroleic</b> <b>acid,</b> and potential myristic as well as myristoleic acid as free fatty acids (Fig.  2; Table  1). The fatty acids revealed {{in this study are}} known as common lipophilic moieties of biosurfactants, the shorter hydroxy fatty acid is present in both, glycolipids (Matsuyama et al. 1990) as well as lipopeptides (Matsuyama et al. 2011; Thies et al. 2014) of the relative enterobacteriaceae Serratia spp. Glucose moieties with acylations at multiple carbon atoms of the sugar ring are observed (Table  2). It could not be further determined whether an ester or ether bond is present at the acylation site. Mass spectrometric measurements (Additional file 1 : Table S 1 and Figure S 1 –S 3) hint to {{the presence of}} various double bonds that corroborates to the results observed from NMR experiments. Hydrophilic moieties of subfraction 63 – 65  E revealed the presence of two forms of talopyranose presenting a different hydrophilic moiety to the other glucose lipids present (Fig.  5). Particular for the glycolipids is the absence of an acylation at the anomeric carbon C 1 that is usually present in glycolipids (Hausmann and Syldatk 2014; Kügler et al. 2015). It remains unclear whether this absence is a unique property of the glycolipids revealed or due to hydrolysis caused during postprocessing of the glycolipids.|$|E
40|$|The study {{investigates the}} effects of a {{post-weaning}} water restriction on performance, nutrient digestibility, carcass traits and meat quality of 84 -day-old rabbits. A total of 1388 weaned rabbits (35 days) were randomly divided into two groups on the basis of BW and sex. The two groups were fed the same diets ad libitum both in the post-weaning (35 to 60 days) and fattening (61 to 84 days) periods. In the post-weaning period, one group (AL) also received drinking water ad libitum, whereas the other (WR) had a water restriction from 35 to 41 days 2 h/day; from 42 to 48 days 2. 5 h/day; from 49 to 55 days 3 h/day; and from 56 to 60 days 4 h/day. During the fattening period, both groups had water-free access. Individual live weights and feed intake per cage were recorded weekly for 32 cages randomly chosen per group (64 rabbits) to calculate the BW gain, feed intake and feed conversion ratio (FCR). The apparent digestibility values of nutrients were measured using acid-insoluble ash. Carcass data were collected from 16 rabbits (8 males and 8 females) per group selected for similar final BW in both groups. Mortality from 35 to 60 days was higher in the AL group (10. 1 % v. 5. 2 %, for AL and WR, respectively, P < 0. 0001). BW gain was higher for the AL group during both the post-weaning (+ 22. 4 %, P < 0. 01) and the entire period (+ 7. 5 %, P < 0. 05). Water restriction reduced feed intake both in the post-weaning (- 17. 4 %, P < 0. 0001) and in the entire period (- 9. 9 %, P < 0. 05). During the fattening period, FCR was lower for the WR group (5. 15 v. 5. 75 g/g, for WR and AL, respectively, P < 0. 05). The apparent digestibilities of dry matter, organic matter, NDF, ADF and cellulose were greater in the restricted rabbits (+ 4. 7 %, + 4. 5 %, + 10. 2 %, + 18. 8 % and + 12. 8 %, P < 0. 01, P < 0. 01, P < 0. 05, P < 0. 01, P < 0. 05, respectively). Perirenal and scapular fat percentages were higher in the AL rabbits (+ 30. 7 % and + 116. 6 %, P < 0. 01 and P < 0. 001, respectively). Water restriction increased saturated fatty acids (C 16 : 0, + 12. 9 %, P < 0. 05), <b>lauroleic</b> <b>acid</b> (C 12 : 1, + 75. 0 %, P < 0. 01), n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (C 20 : 5, + 50. 0 %, P < 0. 01 and C 22 : 5, + 16. 6 %, P < 0. 05) and the n- 3 /n- 6 ratio (+ 28. 6 %, P < 0. 05). The applied water restriction between 35 and 60 days executed during the winter months improved the digestive health of rabbits, with no negative effects on carcass traits, or physical and chemical meat characteristics. However, from the animal welfare point of view, a water restriction can be criticized as a method to restrict feed intake.
