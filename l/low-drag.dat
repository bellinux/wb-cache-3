5|$|Airbus briefly {{considered}} the variable camber wing, {{a concept that}} requires changing the wing profile for a given phase of flight. Studies were carried out by British Aerospace (BAe), now part of BAE Systems, at Hatfield and Bristol. Airbus estimated this would yield a two per cent improvement in aerodynamic efficiency, but the feature was rejected because of cost and difficulty of development. A true laminar flow wing (a <b>low-drag</b> shape that improves fuel efficiency) was also considered but rejected.|$|E
5|$|The Comet was an {{all-metal}} low-wing cantilever monoplane {{powered by}} four jet engines; {{it had a}} four-place cockpit occupied by two pilots, a flight engineer, and a navigator. The clean, <b>low-drag</b> design of the aircraft featured many design elements that were fairly uncommon at the time, including a swept-wing leading edge, integral wing fuel tanks, and four-wheel bogie main undercarriage units designed by de Havilland. Two pairs of turbojet engines (on the Comet 1s, Halford H.2 Ghosts, subsequently known as de Havilland Ghost 50 Mk1s) were buried into the wings.|$|E
25|$|The {{first car}} {{designed}} {{to take account of}} newly developed principles of aerodynamics, to provide <b>low-drag</b> both externally and internally.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, two {{problems}} were identified before heavier-than-air flight could be realized. The {{first was the}} creation of <b>low-drag,</b> high-lift aerodynamic wings. The second problem was how to determine the power needed for sustained flight. During this time, the groundwork was laid down for modern day fluid dynamics and aerodynamics, with other less scientifically-inclined enthusiasts testing various flying machines with little success.|$|E
25|$|It {{was also}} at Langley that Weick headed the {{development}} of streamlined, <b>low-drag</b> engine cowling technology that was to advance aircraft performance dramatically. The NACA cowling first revolutionized civil air transport by making aircraft faster and more profitable. It also found application on the bombers and fighters of World War II. For this engineering breakthrough, he won the prestigious Collier Trophy for NACA in 1929.|$|E
25|$|Teague's <b>low-drag</b> design, which predated {{the fuel}} {{crisis and the}} flood of small foreign imports into the American market, was highly innovative. Its drag {{coefficient}} of 0.43 was relatively low for that time. Teague even eliminated rain gutters, smoothly blending {{the tops of the}} doors into the roof—an aerodynamic detail that, although criticized at the time for allowing rain onto the front seat, has become the norm in today's designs.|$|E
25|$|Weight-saving was a {{priority}} across the aircraft; the airframe, {{other than the}} steel tube engine mount and cowling, featured a wooden rectangular monocoque structure. It had a glued plywood skin, fixed to the mahogany longerons and struts forming the internal structure, which was faired throughout {{to result in a}} <b>low-drag</b> extensions. A conventional fixed undercarriage was used; it had been deemed of greater importance to reduce the aircraft's weight than its drag, thus a retractable undercarriage was seen as counterproductive. The wings, which were constructed in three sections, had a center section integral with the fuselage; the internal structure used three main spars with plywood webs and mahogany flanges, which were covered with plywood sheeting.|$|E
25|$|<b>Low-drag</b> {{conformal}} {{fuel tanks}} (CFTs) were {{developed for the}} F-15C and D models. They can {{be attached to the}} sides of the engine air intakes under each wing and are designed to the same load factors and airspeed limits as the basic aircraft. These conformal tanks slightly degrade performance by increasing aerodynamic drag and cannot be jettisoned in-flight. However they cause less drag than conventional external tanks. Each conformal tank can hold 750 U.S. gallons (2,840 L) of fuel. These tanks increase range and reduce the need for in-flight refueling. All external stations for munitions remain available with the tanks in use. Moreover, Sparrow or AMRAAM missiles can be attached to the corners of the conformal fuel tanks. The 57 FIS based at Keflavik NAS, Iceland was the only C-model squadron to use CFTs on a regular basis due to its extended operations over the North Atlantic. With the closure of the 57 FIS, the F-15E is the only variant to carry them on a routine basis. CFTs have also been sold to Israel and Saudi Arabia.|$|E
500|$|The RAE also reconstructed {{about two-thirds}} of G-ALYP at Farnborough and found fatigue crack growth from a rivet hole at the <b>low-drag</b> {{fibreglass}} forward aperture around the Automatic Direction Finder, which had caused a catastrophic break-up of the aircraft in high-altitude flight. [...] The punch rivet construction technique employed in the Comet's design had exacerbated its structural fatigue problems; the aircraft's windows had been engineered to be glued and riveted, but had been punch riveted only. Unlike drill riveting, the imperfect nature of the hole created by punch riveting could cause fatigue cracks to start developing around the rivet. Principal investigator Hall accepted the RAE's conclusion of design and construction flaws as the likely explanation for G-ALYU's structural failure after 3,060 pressurisation cycles. The Cohen inquiry closed on 24 November 1954, and although the inquiry had [...] "found that the basic design of the Comet was sound", de Havilland nonetheless began a refit programme to strengthen the fuselage and wing structure, employing thicker gauge skin and replacing all square windows and panels with rounded versions.|$|E
500|$|With the {{decision}} not to use the OV-10 and the desire for an immediate capability, the USAF decided to investigate using the S-2 Tracker aircraft. The proposed aircraft would incorporate the three main sensors under development in a revised aircraft that provided operators for all major systems. The S-2’s built-in search light was to be slaved to the LLLTV, crew protection would be provided, and the armament system would be primarily 10 SUU-24/A munitions dispensers in a revised bomb bay. Six wing hard points would be available for additional conventional munitions including bombs, rockets, cluster munitions and dispensers, and gun pods. Interestingly enough, the program package documentation suggests that the “XM-9” would be the primary under-wing store. [...] The XM9 designation is the US Army designation for the SUU-7/A <b>low-drag</b> dispenser pod modified for use on the UH-1B/C Iroquois helicopter. [...] The two planned pre-production aircraft were to be designated YAS-2D, while the production aircraft would have been AS-2D. [...] Difficulties in funding, getting the aircraft from the US Navy, and delays in completing the modifications led the USAF to scrap the S-2 based SCNA in January 1968.|$|E

2500|$|Aerodynamics work {{throughout}} the 19th century sought to achieve heavier-than-air flight. [...] George Cayley developed {{the concept of}} the modern fixed-wing aircraft in 1799, and in doing so identified the four fundamental forces of flight - lift, thrust, drag, and weight. [...] The development of reasonable predictions of the thrust needed to power flight in conjunction with the development of high-lift, <b>low-drag</b> airfoils {{paved the way for the}} first powered flight. [...] On December 17, 1903, Wilbur and Orville Wright flew the first successful powered aircraft.

2500|$|Several other minor {{differences}} were also present between early US-built and UK-built Canberras; these changes included the canopy and fuselage windows being slightly revised, the crew being reduced {{from three to}} two, the adoption of wingtip fuel tanks, engine nacelles were modified with additional cooling scoops, and the conventional [...] "clamshell" [...] bomb bay doors were replaced with a <b>low-drag</b> rotating door originally designed for the XB-51. As {{a result of these}} changes, the bomb bay of the US-built aircraft was slightly smaller than its UK-built counterparts in order to allow the American aircraft to carry more fuel; however, the overall external shape of the Canberra remained unchanged.|$|E
2500|$|Changes for 1982 were minor, as well. Popular Mechanics {{noted that}} it is {{difficult}} to distinguish the 1982 cars from their 1981 counterparts because for the first time in history, AMC has not made appearance changes. The DL and Limited coupes saw the removal of the vertical strakes on their Landau vinyl roofs. A new 5-speed manual transmission made the options list, allowing a [...] Concord to achieve up to [...] on the highway, according to period United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates. The Chrysler-designed 3-speed automatic transmission received wider ratios, and <b>low-drag</b> disc brakes were also added, both as fuel economy measures. The [...] I6 engine now featured a serpentine belt system.|$|E
2500|$|Interest in {{high-speed}} flight, {{which led}} him to initiate work on swept wings starting in 1940, {{is evident from the}} advanced developments Messerschmitt had on his drawing board in 1944. While the Me 262 V9 Hochgeschwindigkeit I (HG I) actually flight-tested in 1944 had only small changes compared to combat aircraft, most notably a low-profile canopy—tried as the Rennkabine (literally [...] "racing cabin") on the ninth Me 262 prototype for a short time—to reduce drag, the HG II and HG III designs were far more radical. The projected HG II combined the <b>low-drag</b> canopy with a 35° wing sweep and a V-tail (butterfly tail). The HG III had a conventional tail, but a 45° wing sweep and turbines embedded in the wing roots.|$|E
2500|$|Reflecting Messerschmitt's {{belief in}} low-weight, <b>low-drag,</b> simple monoplanes, the {{armament}} {{was placed in}} the fuselage. This kept the wings very thin and light. [...] Two synchronized machine guns were mounted in the cowling, firing {{over the top of the}} engine and through the propeller arc. An alternative arrangement was also designed, consisting of a single autocannon firing through a blast tube between the cylinder banks of the engine, known as a Motorkanone mount in German. [...] This was also the choice of armament layout on some contemporary monoplane fighters, such as the French Dewoitine D.520, or the American Bell P-39 Airacobra, and dated back to World War I's small run of SPAD S.XII moteur-canon, 37mm [...] cannon-armed fighters in France.|$|E

[...] The aircraft is stealthy, except briefly when the bomb bay opens. The B-2's clean, <b>low-drag</b> flying wing configuration not only provides exceptional range but is also beneficial to reducing its radar profile. The flying wing design most closely resembles a so-called infinite flat plate (as vertical control surfaces dramatically increase RCS), the perfect stealth shape, as it would lack angles to reflect back radar waves (initially, {{the shape of the}} Northrop ATB concept was flatter; it gradually increased in volume according to specific military requirements).|$|E

50|$|The retarded bomb uses a {{mechanical}} method of creating increased aerodynamic drag, {{such as a}} parachute, ballute, or drag-inducing petals. These deploy after the ordnance is released, slowing its fall and abbreviating its forward trajectory, giving the aircraft time to get clear of the blast zone when bombing from low altitudes or with nuclear ordnance. However, these bombs are less accurate than conventional free-fall bombs.Generally the high-drag tail replaces the <b>low-drag</b> so that the same bomb can be configured for either mode of attack during weapons preparation. High-drag bombs can also be dropped in <b>low-drag</b> mode if the pilot selects this option in the aircraft's weapon system, and will function exactly like a <b>low-drag</b> weapon.|$|E
