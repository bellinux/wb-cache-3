30|$|We assumed {{constant}} {{growth in}} the shorter lower extremity to calculate the projected LLD at maturity from the graph. The date of PETS was plotted on the <b>long</b> <b>leg</b> line based on the most recent measurement of the <b>long</b> <b>leg</b> just prior to surgery. The growth lines on the Moseley graph revealed that surgery on the <b>long</b> <b>leg</b> including a tibial, femoral, or combined epiphysiodesis would have a slope of 72 percent, 63 percent, or 35 percent of normal growth, respectively. Thirteen patients had sufficient data {{to be included in}} the Moseley calculations.|$|R

40|$|Several primary {{studies have}} shown that an {{anatomical}} short leg predicts anterior rotation of the ipsilateral ilium, whereas anatomical <b>long</b> <b>leg</b> predicts posterior rotation of the ilium on the <b>long</b> <b>leg</b> side. At the same time, in chiropractic and other manual therapy professions, it is widely believed that the leg check finding of a short leg is associated with posterior ilium rotation, and a <b>long</b> <b>leg</b> with anterior ilium rotation. The purpose of this commentary is to explore the consequences of this paradox for the manual therapy professions, insofar as leg checking procedures are commonly used to derive appropriate vectors for chiropractic manipulation/adjustive procedures...|$|R

30|$|Ten {{cases were}} treated conservatively. Four {{patients}} with an undisplaced fracture {{were treated with}} a <b>long</b> <b>leg</b> cast (retaining 30 ° of knee flexion), which was removed after 6 – 8  weeks (depending on the child’s age). Treatment was completed with mobilization and gradual weight-bearing. For 5 cases in whom the displacement was over 2  mm, the fractures were treated with closed reduction under sedation or general anesthesia. Distal neurovascular function was assessed {{before and after the}} reduction and, since the fracture was stable with the knee flexed and the distal circulation was not compromised, a <b>long</b> <b>leg</b> cast with 60 ° of knee flexion was placed for 4  weeks. Subsequently, a new <b>long</b> <b>leg</b> cast with 30 ° of knee flexion was applied for 2  weeks more. After the cast was removed, a mobilization program was followed, and the patients were gradually ambulated. In 1 case of a S-H type III injury with a coexisting fracture of the intercondylar eminence, a closed reduction was performed and a <b>long</b> <b>leg</b> cast was placed, with the knee fully extended. After 4  weeks, this cast was replaced with a <b>long</b> <b>leg</b> cast with 30 ° of knee flexion, which was removed after 2 more weeks.|$|R

5|$|It is a big, strong cat, {{similar to}} the Maine Coon breed, with <b>long</b> <b>legs,</b> a bushy tail and a sturdy body. The breed {{is very good at}} climbing, since they have strong claws. The {{lifespan}} is usually 14 to 16 years, though kidney and heart diseases {{have been reported in the}} breed. Specifically in this breed, complex rearrangements of glycogen branching enzyme (GBE1) can cause a perinatal hypoglycaemic collapse and a late-juvenile-onset neuromuscular degeneration in glycogen storage disease type IV.|$|E
5|$|The Acanthizidae are a {{group of}} 35 species of small to medium mostly insectivorous {{passerine}} birds found in Australia, Indonesia, New Zealand and the south-west Pacific. They have short rounded wings, slender bills, <b>long</b> <b>legs</b> and a short tail. Most species have olive, grey or brown plumage, although some have patches of a brighter yellow. Six species are found in Tasmania, of which three are endemic.|$|E
5|$|The European {{storm petrel}} can be {{distinguished}} from related Western Palaearctic species by the white bar on its underwing and its distinctive fluttering flight. Compared to Leach's storm petrel, band-rumped storm petrel, and the recently described Monteiro's storm petrel, it is also smaller, darker, shorter-winged and has a square tail. Wilson's storm petrel lacks an underwing bar, and has <b>long</b> <b>legs</b> with the feet visible beyond the tail.|$|E
