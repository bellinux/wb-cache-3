40|$|Lately it {{has been}} {{proposed}} to reduce the friction drag of a body in a flow for the technically important large Reynolds numbers by the following expedient: the boundary layer, normally turbulent, is artificially kept laminar up to high Reynolds numbers by suction. The reduction in friction drag thus obtained is {{of the order of}} magnitude of 60 to 80 percent of the turbulent friction drag, since the latter, for large Reynolds numbers, is several times the <b>laminar</b> <b>friction</b> drag. In considering the idea mentioned one has first to consider whether suction is a possible means of keeping the boundary layer laminar. This question can be answered by a theoretical investigation of the stability of the laminar boundary layer with suction.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} effect of contact angle (or surface wettability) on the {{convective}} heat transfer coefficient in microchannels. Slip flow, where the fluid velocity at the wall is non-zero, is most likely to occur in microchannels due to its dependence on shear rate or wall shear stress. We show analytically that for a constant pressure drop, the presence of slip increases the Nusselt number. In a microchannel heat exchanger we modified the surface wettability from a contact angle of 20 &# 0176;- 120 &# 0176; using thin film coating technology. Apparent slip flow is implied from pressure and flow rate measurements with a departure from classical <b>laminar</b> <b>friction</b> coefficients above a critical shear rate of approximately 10, 000 s- 1. The magnitude of this departure is dependant on the contact angle with higher contact angles surfaces exhibiting larger pressure drop decreases. Similarly, the non-dimensional heat flux is found to decrease relative to laminar non-slip theory, and this decrease is also a function of the contact angle. Depending on the contact angle and the wall shear rate, variations in the heat transfer rate exceeding 10 % can be expected. Thus the contact angle is an important consideration in the design of micro, and even more so, nano heat exchangers...|$|E
40|$|Laminar layer Preston tube {{data on a}} sharp nose, ten degree cone {{obtained}} in the Ames 11 ft TWT and in flight tests are analyzed. During analyses of the laminar-boundary layer data, errors were discovered in both the wind tunnel and the flight data. A correction procedure for errors in the flight data is recommended which forces the flight data to exhibit some of the orderly characteristics of the wind tunnel data. From corrected wind tunnel data, a correlation is developed between Preston tube pressures and the corresponding values of theoretical <b>laminar</b> skin <b>friction.</b> Because of the uncertainty in correcting the flight data, a correlation for the unmodified data is developed, and, in addition, three other correlations are developed based on different correction procedures.

However, in this regime, {{not a lot}} of design information is available and some design books even recommend to not design heat exchangers to operate in the transitional flow regime. Furthermore, it is known that the type of inlet of heat exchangers influences the transition characteristics. It was therefore {{the purpose of this study}} to measure heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics in smooth horizontal tubes using different types of inlets. The types of inlets were hydrodynamically fully developed, square-edged, re-entrant, and bellmouth. Experiments were conducted on a 14. 48 -mm inner diameter horizontal tube in which the water was cooled. Reynolds numbers ranged between 1000 and 20, 000 and Grashof numbers were on the order of 105. It was found that for adiabatic flow the square-edged inlet delayed transition to Reynolds numbers of around 2600, while the bellmouth inlet delayed it to about 7000. However, for diabatic flow, the transition was independent of the type of inlet. <b>Laminar</b> <b>friction</b> factors were much higher than their theoretically predicted values due to the secondary flows increasing the amount of mixing in the tube.

This paper presents a flow analysis considering the velocity slip in a capacitive micro gas flow sensor based on pressure difference measurements along a microchannel. The tangential momentum accommodation coefficient (TMAC) measurements of a particular channel wall in planar microchannels will be presented while the previous micro gas flow studies have been based on the same TMACs on both walls. The sensors consist of a pair of capacitive pressure sensors, inlet/outlet and a microchannel. The main microchannel is 128. 0 mu m wide, 4. 64 mu m deep and 5680 mu m long, and operated under nearly atmospheric conditions where the outlet Knudsen number is 0. 0137. The sensor was fabricated using silicon wet etching, ultrasonic drilling, deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) and anodic bonding. The capacitance change of the sensor and the mass flow rate of nitrogen were measured as the inlet-to-outlet pressure ratio was varied from 1. 00 to 1. 24. The measured maximum mass flow rate was 3. 86 x 10 (- 10) kg s(- 1) (0. 019 sccm) at the highest pressure ratio tested.

40|$|While it is {{accepted}} that the eccentricity of Mercury (0. 206) favours entrapment into the 3 : 2 spin-orbit resonance, open {{is the question}} how and when the capture took place. A recent work by Makarov (2012) has demonstrated that trapping into this resonance is certain if the eccentricity is larger than 0. 2, provided that we use a realistic tidal model, the one {{which is based on}} the Darwin-Kaula expansion of the tidal torque. The physics-based tidal model changes dramatically the statistics of the possible final spin states. First, we discover that after only one encounter with the spin-orbit 3 : 2 resonance this resonance becomes the most probable end-state. Second, if a capture into this (or any other) resonance takes place, the capture becomes final, several crossings of the same state being forbidden by our model. Third, within our model the trapping of Mercury happens much faster than previously believed: for most histories, 10 - 20 Myr are sufficient. Fourth, even a weak <b>laminar</b> <b>friction</b> between the solid mantle and a molten core would most likely result in a capture in the 2 : 1 or even higher resonance. So the principal novelty of our paper is that the 3 : 2 end-state is more ancient than the same end-state obtained when the constant time lag model is employed. The swift capture justifies our treatment of Mercury as a homogeneous, unstratified body whose liquid core had not yet formed by the time of trapping. We also provide a critical analysis of the hypothesis by Wieczorek et al. (2012) that the early Mercury might had been retrograde, whereafter it synchronised its spin and then accelerated it to the 3 : 2 resonance. Accurate processing of the available data on cratering does not support that hypothesis, while the employment of a realistic rheology invalidates a key element of the hypothesis, an intermediate pseudosynchronous state needed to spin-up to the 3 : 2 resonance.

40|$|Flows often behave {{differently}} {{at small}} length scales than macroscopic intuition. These behavior changes can have serious implications for microfluidic devices. In gas flows, {{these differences are}} rarefaction and compressibility, among others. The goal of this thesis is to derive the theoretical mass flow rate and pressure distribution in rectangular microchannels considering those differences. These results are applied to designing and fabricating a micro gas flow sensor. ^ Analytical expressions for mass flow rates and pressure distribution in long, straight and uniform rectangular cross section microchannels in the slip flow regime are presented. This analytical model {{is based on the}} assumption that the flow is steady state, two-dimensional, isothermal with negligible transverse velocities. Inertial effects are assumed to be negligible, and a first order slip boundary condition is used. These theoretical expressions are compared with experimental measurements of air flowing in microchannels fabricated using DRIE. There is close agreement between the measurements of mass flow/pressure and calculations by the slip flow formulae. These analytical formulae can be used to extract a channel height and a TMAC. ^ The dimensionless location of the maximum pressure deviation from the linear pressure distribution is found analytically and compared with the measurements. The dimensionless location of the maximum deviation depends mostly on the pressure ratio and it increases with the increasing pressure ratios. μPIV measurements are conducted to find the entrance length in water flows. ^ A capacitive micro gas flow sensor is also presented with slip flow analysis. This sensor consists of a pair of capacitors that measure the pressure difference between the inlet and outlet along with the absolute pressure at the outlet, inlet/outlet reservoirs, and the main microchannel which causes a pressure difference between the reservoirs. The main microchannel is 128. 0 μm wide, 4. 64 μm deep, and 5680 μm long, where the outlet Knudsen number is 0. 0137. As the pressure difference increases, the capacitance of the differential pressure sensing capacitor increases. Sensitivity of this sensor and the TMAC are discussed.

The influence of the rotating cylinder block and pistons on churning losses is analyzed based on a qualitative evaluation of the various fluid flow regimes at different test speeds in an axial piston pump. The analytical results indicate that pistons have less influence on churning losses than the rotating cylinder block beyond the critical speed in axial piston pumps, because the total energy dissipation transforms <b>laminar</b> viscous <b>friction</b> losses into turbulent shear stress losses.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} heat transfer and {{pressure drop in}} rectangular micro-channels was conducted for water in the laminar and transitional regimes for three different inlet configurations. The inlet types under consideration were the sudden contraction, bellmouth, and swirl inlet types, and hydraulic diameters of 0. 57, 0. 85, and 1. 05 mm were covered. It {{was found that the}} critical Reynolds number and the transitional behaviour in terms of heat transfer coefficients and friction factors were influenced significantly by the inlet type. For the sudden contraction inlet type, which were investigated for both adiabatic, as well as diabatic cases, adiabatic friction factors were predicted well by the laminar Shah and London correlation, while diabatic friction factors were decreased with an increase in wall heat flux. The sudden contraction inlet critical Reynolds numbers were found to be between 1800 and 2000 for adiabatic cases, while for diabatic cases the transition regime commenced at a Reynolds number of about 2000. The bellmouth and swirl inlet types were mostly investigated for diabatic cases only with swirl inlet tests limited to the 1. 05 mm channel. <b>Laminar</b> <b>friction</b> factors were approximately {{similar to those of the}} sudden contraction inlet type, however, after the commencement of transition both inlet types exhibited higher friction factors than the sudden contraction inlet. Minor transition occurred as early as at Reynolds numbers of 1200 and 800 for the bellmouth and swirl inlet types respectively while major transition occurred at Reynolds numbers of approximately 1800 and 1500 respectively. Critical Reynolds numbers were found not be significantly influenced by the channel diameter to length ratio considered in this study. Laminar Nusselt numbers were predicted well by conventional macro-channel thermal entry correlations. The swirl inlet type exhibited the highest friction factors and Nusselt numbers in the transitional regime followed by the bellmouth inlet type. During transition while compared with the sudden contraction inlet, both the bellmouth and swirl inlet types exhibited larger enhancement in heat transfer than increases in the friction factor penalty.

40|$|For the {{description}} of porous flow the Forchheimer equation is normally used. Several formulae have been proposed for the coefficients Cl and c 2 from this equation. All these formulae are based on experiments. Those coefficients represent the friction and resistance caused by the porous medium. The Forchheimer equation is a somewhat semi-empirical formula. The phenomena that appear in a porous flow are not really described and implemented in the formula. In this report the assumptions and approximations to derive the Forchheimer equation using the Navier-Stokes equation were mentioned. To describe the flow on a porous structure (e. g., a breakwater) and the internal flow with a numerical model, the Navier-Stokes equation need to be adapted for the internal flow. In this report the Navier-Stokes equation is adapted for porous flow. The approach to derive this equation gives the adapted Navier-Stokes equation and it shows how several parameters {{are present in the}} coefficients. Those coefficients are also present in the Forchheimer equation. So, it gives expressions for the coefficients for the Forchheimer equation as well. The derived formula can be used for a numerical model that describes the flow on a porous structure (with Navier-Stokes equations) and the flow in the structure. This formula is derived by regarding several contributions of the force on the grains. Each contribution is written as a result of one term from the Navier-Stokes equation. Sometimes rather rough assumptions and approximations were made to derive the adapted Navier-Stokes equation for porous flow; those were mentioned in earlier sections. The contributions to the total force on the grains that are included in this formula are called <b>laminar</b> <b>friction,</b> turbulence friction, added mass and resistance {{as a result of the}} convective term (shape-resistance). The assumption is made that the force on the grains can be described by a summation of these contributions. Turbulence friction is not represented, or is not clearly represented, in existing derivations of formulae for porous flow. This friction is normally included in one term together with resistance as a result of the convective term (shape resistance). Those two contributions together, are usually called "drag". The problem of finding suitable values for the coefficients that describe the several processes, has to be solved by doing measurements. Most of the measurements were done under stationary flow conditions. Measurements for determining values of coefficients for non-stationary flow conditions are not sufficient yet to find suitable values for CM' The other coefficients are probably different under non-stationary flow conditions. This may cause that measurements of coefficients for Cl and C 2 under stationary flow conditions can not be used for Cl and C 2 under non-stationary flow conditions. The coefficients are probably depending on the Re-number and the KC-number. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

Comparisons with the analytical solution showed a reasonable fit without any calibration. The SWASH model showed in first instance large deviations using the same dataset. By calibrating the turbulent flow resistance ?, it was possible to generate a decent fit. However, the used ? constants are 6 - 10 times higher than the measured ? constants. This is physically unrealistic high. Therefore the most likely explanation is an error in the transition between the water and the porous medium. During the experiment discontinuities can occur on this transition while SWASH uses an continuity requirement. Numerical tests were performed on some multi-layered combinations of the different blocks in order to derive a "Vertical P" value in a similar way as Van der Meer determined his P= 0. 4 structure. The results showed, nevertheless, quite some different patterns as the computations done by Van der Meer. However, taking into account all the problems with calibrating the SWASH model the results for the notional permeability seemed very promising.

40|$|Abstract: Due to {{the need}} for {{practical}} cooling technologies which could dissipate high heat fluxes, an experimental study of pressure drop in micro-channel was performed. In this work, <b>laminar</b> flow <b>friction</b> factors were determined using gas (air) as flow medium. Pressure drop vs flow rate data were used to evaluate friction factors in two parallel microchannels, namely MCP 1 and MCP 2 (1. 0 mm deep x 0. 240 mm width and 0. 9 mm deep x 0. 2 mm width, respectively). Each channel of length 192 mm fabricated on a 304 Stainless Steel substrate by chemical milling Reynolds number was covered between 24 – 5398 for MCP 1 and 26 – 6233 for MCP 2. Transient pressure drops measured within the channel itself to exclude entrance and exit losses. Friction factor – Reynolds number analyses show that the friction constant are identical as normal channels for gas flow in the laminar region. Transition region lies in Re> 500 and transition set off at lower Re ~ 500 in comparison to normal channel. The discontinuity in f – Re data identified as transition. Further, {{it may be possible to}} identify transition (from laminar region) as the deviation of non-dimensional pressure drop (NDPD) values...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} heat transfer and {{pressure drop in}} rectangular micro-channels was conducted for water in the laminar and transitional regimes for three different inlet configurations. The inlet types under consideration were the sudden contraction, bellmouth, and swirl inlet types, and hydraulic diameters of 0. 57 mm, 0. 85 mm, and 1. 05 mm were covered. It {{was found that the}} critical Reynolds number and the transitional behaviour in terms of heat transfer coefficients and friction factors were influences significantly by the inlet type. For the sudden contraction inlet type, which were investigated for both adiabatic, as well as diabatic cases, adiabatic friction factors were predicted well by the laminar Shah and London correlation, while diabatic friction factors were decreased with an increase in wall heat flux. The sudden contraction inlet critical Reynolds numbers were found to be between 1 800 and 2 000 for adiabatic cases, while for diabatic cases the transition regime commenced at a Reynolds number of about 2 000. The bellmouth and swirl inlet types were investigated for diabatic cases only with swirl inlet tests limited to the 1. 05 mm channel. <b>Laminar</b> 2 <b>friction</b> factors were approximately {{similar to those of the}} sudden contraction inlet type, however...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In the {{previous}} paper {{of this series}} (Bell et al., 1989), data from 96 experiments on a marine-plywood plane were used to investigate the performance of numerical models of overland flow based on the kinematic wave approximation. These models incorporated <b>laminar</b> and turbulent <b>friction</b> relationships, based on Darcy-Weisbach, Manning and Colebrook-White formulations, and four parameters were required {{to account for the}} effect of raindrop impact on effective roughness. In this paper a simpler kinematic formulation based on the Manning turbulent flow relationship (with two parameter values to allow for raindrop impact) is tested, and although physically less realistic, is shown to give comparable fits to the experimental data and to be more readily amenable to automatic optimization. The conceptualization of overland flow is extended further, to consider linear and non-linear reservoir cascades. The simplified kinemati...|$|R
50|$|In late transition, T-S {{oscillations}} become amplified focally (Schubauer and Skramstad 1943), creating {{spots of}} high amplitude SH BL transverse sound waves. This creates vigorous transverse molecular oscillation as waves of coherent sound energy pass perpendicularly through-longitudinally flowing BL laminae, potentially freezing laminar slip (<b>laminar</b> interlocking). Abruptly, <b>friction</b> transfers to the highly resistant boundary (G Hamilton 1980 and 2015) as laminar-interlocked chunks are ripped out of long-crested T-S waves and tumble head-over-heels along the boundary (Hamilton 2015) as turbulent spots (Schubauer and Skramstad 1943), {{which are also}} known as “flashes of turbulence” in cylinders (Reynolds 1867). With further increase in flow rate, full-blown high-resistance turbulent flow erupts. with many turbulent spots and generalized laminar interlocking (G Hamilton 1980 and 2015). A linear transverse boundary impediment apparently forces turbulent spots to re-align into the SH long-crested waves from which they were ripped, with the surrounding flow retaining its disturbed (turbulent) surface wave pattern (Hamilton 2015: pp. 12-13).|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] This is {{the work}} deals with a {{numerical}} study of laminar flow of two- dimensional, incompressible, and steady state over rotating circular cylinder. The solution of the flow is presented for dimensionless rotation rate varying from (1 – 6) (in the steps of 1) at each value of Reynolds number based on diameter of cylinder is (200, 400, 800, and 1000). Navier – Stokes and continuity equations were solved numerically by using finite volume technique is conducted with FLUENT version (6. 2) package program was used in present work. Stream lines or function and vorticity contours and pressure, lift, and skin friction coefficients results are presented along curve length of cylinder at each value of rotation rate and Reynolds number. The results of lift coefficient and stream lines and vorticity contours were compared with other previously published research that presented support the validity of results. Results have shown approximately increase values of pressure, and skin friction coefficients with increasing of rotation rate at known Reynolds number.
