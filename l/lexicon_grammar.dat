25|$|The {{issue of}} whether sublanguages should be {{included}} remains unsettled. Proponents of it argue that with all sublanguages removed, it will result in an impoverished view of language. Since language {{is made up of}} <b>lexicons,</b> <b>grammar</b> and a wide array of different sublanguages, they should be included. However, it is not until recently that it became a viable option. Striking a middle ground by including some sublanguages is contentious because it’s an arbitrary issue of which to include and which not.|$|R
40|$|During {{the recent}} years, {{the use of}} {{linguistic}} data for language processing (semantic ambiguity resolution, translation [...] .) increased progressively. Such data are now commonly called language resources. A few years ago, nearly all the language resources {{used for this purpose}} were collections of texts as the Brown Corpus and the Penn Treebank, but the use of electronic lexicons (WordNet, FrameNet, VerbNet, ComLex [...] .) and formal grammars (TAG [...] .) developed recently. This development is slow because of most processes of construction of <b>lexicons</b> and <b>grammars</b> are manual, whereas the construction of corpora has always been highly automated. However, more and more specialists of language processing realize that the information content of <b>lexicons</b> and <b>grammars</b> is richer than that of corpora, and hence the former make more elaborate processing possible. The difference in construction time is likely to be connected with the difference in information content: the handcrafting of <b>lexicons</b> and <b>grammars</b> by linguists would make them more informative than automatically generated data. This situation can evolve into two directions: either specialists of language technology get progressively used to handling manually constructed resources, which are more informative and more complex, or the process of construction of <b>lexicons</b> and <b>grammars</b> is automated an...|$|R

5000|$|Matengo is a [...] "middle sized language", an {{offshoot}} of the Bantu language that is commonly spoken in the southwestern corner of Tanzania.

However, the Swahili words have influenced the Matengo, particularly the <b>lexicon.</b> <b>Grammar</b> and phonology of Matengo have undergone change under Swahili influence; a certain amount of code mixing has also occurred. The Matengo language is thus getting Swahilized gradually, and as result most of the younger generation tend to speak in Swahili.|$|E

Some speakers of Northern Khmer may understand other varieties of Khmer but speakers of standard Khmer {{who have not been}} exposed to Northern Khmer often have trouble understanding Northern Khmer at first.

50|$|There {{are over}} 90 {{distinct}} native languages spoken by the different ethnic populations of Laos. Lao, {{the official language}} of Laos, is a monosyllabic tone based language from the Tai-Kadai family as spoken in Vientiane. There are 19 million Lao speakers in Thailand and 3 million in Laos, a reflection of geopolitical history. Lao can be further divided according to regional dialects including Vientiane, northern, northeastern, central and southern. Northern dialects are spoken in Sainyabuli, Bokeo, Phongsali, Luang Nam Tha, Udomxai, and Luang Prabang. Northeastern Lao is spoken mainly in Xiang Khoang and Houa Phan. Central Lao is found in Khammuan and Bolikhamsai. The Southern dialect is used in Champasak, Salavan, Savannakhet, Attapeu, and Sekong. As part of the Tai-Kadai language family spoken Thai is similar to Lao, with some distinctions. Lao has six tones, whereas Bangkok Thai has five, the standard <b>lexicon,</b> <b>grammar,</b> usage and pronunciations are also different. The two languages are not mutually intelligible, although Lao speakers tend to {{have an easier time}} understanding Thai because of the prevalence of Thai radio and media in and around Laos.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{shows how}} to algorithmically {{construct}} a Minimalist <b>Grammar</b> <b>lexicon</b> {{that produces a}} specified set of MG derivations. This thesis introduces a mathematical structure, a Collection of Constraints, that captures the logical constraints, including those that arise {{as a consequence of}} the shortest move constraint, imposed upon the syntactic features of lexical items as they are merged together in a derivation produced by a given Minimalist <b>Grammar</b> <b>lexicon.</b> Methods are then developed that (a) map Minimalist <b>Grammar</b> <b>lexicons</b> to be Collections of Constraints, (b) map Collections of Constraints to Minimalist <b>Grammar</b> <b>lexicons</b> and (c) may combine two or more Collections of Constraints into a single Collection of Constraints. The thesis then demonstrates via a series of examples, framed as a simplified acquisition process, how these methods may be used together to iteratively construct a Minimalist <b>Grammar</b> <b>lexicon</b> starting from an empty Collection of Constraints and a sequence of Minimalist Grammar derivations, such that the constructed lexicon is able to generate the set of derivations. by Sagar Indurkhya.

40|$|Controlled Language (CL) rules specify {{constraints}} on <b>lexicon,</b> <b>grammar</b> and style {{with the objective}} of improving text translatability, comprehensibility, readability and usability. A significant body of research exists demonstrating the positive effects CL rules can have on machine translation quality (e. g.

Since CL rules aim to reduce complexity and ambiguity, claims have been made that they consequently improve the readability of text (e. g., Spaggiari, Beaujard and Cannesson 2003; Reuther 2003). Little work, however, has been done on the effects of CL on readability.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{construct}} an annotated diachronic corpus of Japanese, we propose {{to create a new}} dictionary for morphological analysis of Early Middle Japanese (Classical Japanese) based on UniDic, a dictionary for Contemporary Japanese. Differences between the Early Middle Japanese and Contemporary Japanese, which prevent a naïve adaptation of UniDic to Early Middle Japanese, are found at the levels of <b>lexicon,</b> morphology, <b>grammar,</b> orthography and pronunciation. In order to overcome these problems, we extended dictionary entries and created a training corpus of Early Middle Japanese to adapt UniDic for Contemporary Japanese to Early Middle Japanese.
