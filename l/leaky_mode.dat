5000|$|A <b>leaky</b> <b>mode</b> or {{tunneling}} mode in {{an optical}} fiber or other waveguide is a mode having an electric field that decays monotonically for a finite distance in the transverse direction but becomes oscillatory everywhere beyond that finite distance. Such a mode gradually [...] "leaks" [...] {{out of the}} waveguide as it travels down it, producing attenuation even if the waveguide is perfect in every respect. In order for a <b>leaky</b> <b>mode</b> to be definable as a mode, the relative amplitude of the oscillatory part (the leakage rate) must be sufficiently small that the mode substantially maintains its shape as it decays.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{excitation}} {{of a physical}} <b>leaky</b> <b>mode</b> in a covered microstrip structure at low frequencies. We calculate the current excited in the line by a delta-gap voltage source via a full wave analysis based on a mixed potential integral equation scheme. The current in the line is decomposed into its bound mode and continuous spectrum components. The bound mode component {{is associated with the}} propagation effects whereas the continuous spectrum component is associated with reactive and/or radiative effects and contains the contribution of the <b>leaky</b> <b>mode.</b> Our analysis also includes a detail study of the dispersion relations of the bound and leaky modes along with their corresponding electric fields. At low frequencies, in the covered microstrip structure with a low top cover height, we have found that the bound mode role is superseded by the <b>leaky</b> <b>mode,</b> {{in the sense that it}} is the <b>leaky</b> <b>mode</b> which partially or totally carries the signal energy. Therefore, the spurious effects associated with the excitation of a <b>leaky</b> <b>mode,</b> which usually appear at high frequencies in open microstrip lines, appear here in the low frequency range. This effect may have very relevant practical consequences in the performance of such systems...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} it is shown {{for the first}} time that a novel {{transition}} may occur for dominant (quasi transverse electromagnetic (quasi-TEM)) leaky modes on microstrip line, between a <b>leaky</b> <b>mode</b> that leaks into the TM 0 surface wave mode and one that leaks both into the surface wave and into space. The modal evolution of leaky modes as a function of frequency is studied by means of a full-wave spectral domain approach, and it is shown that such transitions occur on microstrip lines that have a critical strip width, which is relatively large. When the strip width is equal to the critical value, a transition frequency will exist at which the attenuation constant of the <b>leaky</b> <b>mode</b> drops exactly to zero and the <b>leaky</b> <b>mode</b> has a real propagation wave number exactly equal to the free-space wave number. At this frequency, the <b>leaky</b> <b>mode</b> transitions from one that leaks into only the surface wave to one that also leaks into space. In a frequency neighborhood of the transition frequency, very large spurious effects may be produced because of interference between the fundamental quasi-TEM mode and the continuous spectrum current...|$|E

The analysis on the synthetic seismic data from pure elastic models indicates that in a heterogeneous situation both scattering and <b>leaky</b> <b>mode</b> mechanisms contribute to the observed apparent energy loss. The scattering mechanism due to small scale heterogeneity cannot be ruled out when studying the attenuation observed in the field data. In regions with locally continuous large scale heterogeneities, scattering attenuation may become less severe, and the <b>leaky</b> <b>mode</b> mechanism plays the {{leading role in the}} apparent energy loss...|$|E

If the structure is excited by a plane wave impinging from oblique directions, a coupling to the <b>leaky</b> <b>mode</b> supported by the structure can occur, leading to a reduction of the reflectance. Accordingly, by variation of the incident angle {{and the frequency of}} the plane wave, the leaky-wave region can be sampled.

40|$|Traveling wave antennas for the {{millimeter}} {{wave range}} face two main problems: higher metal loss {{at the higher}} frequencies, and fabrication difficulties due to the smaller wavelengths. These two problems are addressed here by {{a new type of}} leaky wave antenna, in which the fabrication problem is minimized by employing a longitudinally continuous aperture, and the higher loss reduced by basing the antenna on a low-loss waveguide, the groove guide. A longitudinally continuous asymmetric metal strip provides the mechanism that transforms the initially bound mode into a <b>leaky</b> <b>mode.</b> An accurate analysis, based on a transverse equivalent network, is presented here for the properties of this leaky structure that takes into account the mode conversion from the bound mode to the <b>leaky</b> <b>mode.</b> All the constituents of this transverse equivalent network are obtained in closed form, thus yielding a dispersion relation in closed form. Part I of these two companion papers describes the new antenna and its principle of operation, and then derives the parameters of the complete transverse equivalent network.

40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{investigation}} is presented of metamaterial structures excited by a line source aimed at producing narrow directive beams. The structure under consideration is a grounded slab {{made of a}} homogeneous metamaterial medium with a plasma-like dispersive permittivity; for low values of the slab permittivity an extremely directive beam pointing at broadside can be obtained. Conditions for the maximization of radiation at broadside are given and the narrow-beam effect is shown {{to be related to}} the excitation of a <b>leaky</b> <b>mode</b> supported by the slab, with radiation maximization corresponding to small and equal values of the phase and attenuation constants. The frequency bandwidth and directivity are expressed in a simple closed form in terms of the attenuation constant of the <b>leaky</b> <b>mode.</b> By increasing the slab height for a fixed frequency, the <b>leaky</b> <b>mode</b> is analytically shown to give rise to a beam that is scanned from broadside to the critical angle for plane-wave refraction, thus being confined to a narrow angular region around broadside. Numerical results are given that illustrate these features, and full-wave simulations of a metamaterial structure made of an array of metallic cylinders are presented that confirm the results of the analytical study.

40|$|A {{classical}} optics waveguide {{structure is}} proposed to simulate resonances of short range one-dimensional potentials in quantum mechanics. The analogy {{is based on}} the well known resemblance between the guided and radiation modes of a waveguide with the bound and scattering states of a quantum well. As resonances are scattering states that spend some time in the zone of influence of the scatterer, we associate them with the <b>leaky</b> <b>modes</b> of a waveguide, the latter characterized by suffering attenuation in the direction of propagation but increasing exponentially in the transverse directions. The resemblance is complete since resonances (<b>leaky</b> <b>modes)</b> can be interpreted as bound states (guided modes) with definite lifetime (longitudinal shift).

A series of measurements on the resonator are conducted for the same guiding structure of various lengths, confirming that the anomalous resonance is indeed caused by a fast-wave {{in the form of a}} space-wave type <b>leaky</b> <b>mode</b> which also exhibits almost identical modal currents to those of the bound mode.

40|$|Recent {{experimental}} verification of metamaterials with negative {{index of refraction}} – also known as DNG (double negative) media as their permittivity and permeability are both negative – {{has led to the}} widespread research of guiding structures that are made of (or include) these new metamaterials. The unusual properties exhibited by DNG materials, such as backward wave propagation and antiparallel phase and group velocities, makes them suitable for new microwave devices. One such device is the DNG open waveguide studied by Shadrivov et al. (I. V. Shadrivov, A. A. Sukhorukov, and Y. S. Kivshar, Phys. Rev.

We present a variation of this waveguide and study not only guided <b>modes</b> but also <b>leaky</b> <b>modes.</b> The study of <b>leaky</b> <b>modes</b> in open dielectric waveguides was analyzed by Tamir and Oliner back in 1963 (T.
