50|$|The {{minke whale}} , or <b>lesser</b> <b>rorqual,</b> is type of baleen whale. The {{two species of}} minke whale are the common (or northern) mink whale and the Antarctic (or southern) minke whale. The minke whale was first {{described}} by the Danish naturalist Otto Fabricius in 1780, who assumed it must be an already known species and assigned his specimen to Balaena rostrata, a name given to the northern bottlenose whale by Otto Friedrich Müller in 1776. In 1804, Bernard Germain de Lacépède described a juvenile specimen of Balaenoptera acuto-rostrata. The name is a partial translation of Norwegian minkehval, possibly after a Norwegian whaler named Meincke, who mistook a northern minke whale for a blue whale.|$|E
40|$|The {{functional}} properties of haemoglobin from the <b>Lesser</b> <b>Rorqual</b> whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) have been {{characterized as a}} function of the heterotropic effector concentrations and temperature. The results obtained suggest the existence of sophisticated modulation mechanisms based on the interplay of organic phosphates, carbon dioxide, lactate and temperature. These, together with the very small apparent heat of oxygenation (delta H) of oxygen binding, have been physiologically interpreted on the basis of the specific metabolic needs of this diving mammal...|$|E
40|$|Pancreatic RNAase (ribonuclease) {{from the}} pike whale (<b>lesser</b> <b>rorqual,</b> Balaenoptera acutorostrata) was {{isolated}} by affinity chromatography. The protein was digested with different proteolytic enzymes. Peptides were isolated by gel filtration, preparative high-voltage paper electrophoresis and paper chromatography. The {{amino acid sequence}} of peptides {{was determined by the}} dansyl-Edman method. Although we do not have an amino acid composition for the whole protein, all peptide bonds were overlapped by one or more peptides. Residues 85 - 96 are bridged by a peptide of unstaisfactory composition and the sequence here depends, at least in part, on homology for its confirmation. Another region in which a similar situation obtains is residues 39 - 40. This pancreatic RNAase differs at 24 - 33 % of the positions from all other mammalian pancreatic RNAases sequenced to date, except for pig RNAase, from which it differs by 19 %. This indicates that whale RNAase has evolved independently during the larger part of the evolution of the mammals. Lesser-rorqual pancreatic RNAase is partially glycosidated (30 %) at asparagine- 76 in an Asn-Ser-Thr sequence (residues 76 - 78). Pig RNAase also has carbohydrate attached to asparagine- 76 and is identical with lesser-rorqual RNAase in residues 76 - 98. Detailed evidence for the sequence has been deposited as Supplementary Publication SUP 50066 (11 pages) at the British Library Lending Division, Boston Spa, Wetherby, W. Yorkshire LS 23 7 BQ, U. K., from whom copies may be obtained on the terms ginen in Biochem. J. (1976) 135, 5...|$|E
5000|$|It has {{formerly}} {{been known}} as the little piked whale, the <b>lesser</b> or least <b>rorqual,</b> and the sharp-headed finner. American whalemen in the 19th century simply thought of them as [...] "young finbacks" [...] or a [...] "Finback's calf", apparently {{under the impression that}} they were juveniles of their larger relative, the fin whale. They were also called zwergwal (German: [...] "dwarf whale") or vågehval (Norwegian: [...] "bay whale"). In Greenland they are known by the Danish name sildepisker ("herring thresher").|$|R
