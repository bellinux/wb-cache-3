50|$|A {{machine pistol}} is {{generally}} {{defined as a}} firearm designed to be fired with one hand, and capable of fully automatic or selective fire. While {{there are a number}} of machine pistols such as the Glock 18 and later models of the Mauser C96, these are rare; the light weight, small size, and extremely rapid rates of fire of a machine pistol make them difficult to control, making the larger and heavier submachine gun a better choice in cases where the small size of a machine pistol is not needed. Most machine pistols can attach a shoulder stock (the Heckler & Koch VP70 would only fire single rounds at a time unless the stock was attached); others, such as the Beretta 93R, add a forward handgrip. Either of these additions technically create a legal non-pistol under the US National Firearms Act, as pistols are by definition designed to be fired with one hand. The addition of a stock or forward handgrip is considered a design change that creates either a short-barreled rifle or any other weapon, and therefore such additions are generally only found on <b>legal</b> <b>machine</b> guns.|$|E

Typically based on a dirt bike chassis, they have added lights, mirrors, signals, and instruments that allow them to be licensed for public roads. They are higher than other street bikes, with a high center of gravity and tall seat height, allowing good suspension travel for rough ground.|$|R
50|$|Video poker {{machines}} were once {{widespread in the}} state. Regulations enacted in 2000 limited them to three machines per location, and blocked the installation of any new machines. There were an estimated 10,000 <b>legal</b> <b>machines</b> remaining {{in the state in}} 2006, plus 20,000 illegal machines. The Senate made five attempts over the years to ban the game, but was blocked by House Speaker Jim Black. Pressure mounted on Black after he was tied to state and federal investigations into the video poker industry, and he agreed to a one-year phase-out of the game. A complete ban went into effect in 2007.|$|R

[...] Loosely inspired by his experiences singing in the a cappella group The Williams Octet—and later an alumni group in New York City called [...] "The Lemmings"—the ensemble comedy/drama is {{about a group of}} guys who sang together in a college a cappella group and are reuniting 15 years later to sing in a friend's wedding. With the help of renowned casting director Avy Kaufman, Leddy assembled a stellar cast of New York-based performers including Mark Feuerstein, Molly Shannon, David Harbour, Rosemarie DeWitt, Elizabeth Reaser, and Reg Rogers. The film was shot on location in New York City and East Hampton, NY. On the festival circuit, the movie won 9 awards including the Audience Award at the HBO U.S. Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen. Just prior to a limited theatrical release by Strand Releasing, the Weinstein Company announced that they were naming their previously untitled documentary about the Dixie Chicks as [...] "Shut Up & Sing". A brief legal skirmish ensued but, without adequate funds to fight the Weinstein <b>legal</b> <b>machine,</b> Leddy was forced to re-title his film. For its initial theatrical release, the film was titled [...] "Sing Now or Forever Hold Your Peace." [...] For international sales purposes, the title was changed to [...] "The Wedding Weekend," [...] and that title proved more popular with DVD distributors where it was picked up by First Look Studios and released in May 2008 on DVD. In May 2010, the film began airing on The Sundance Channel as [...] "The Wedding Weekend." [...] It has been seen in multiple countries in Europe and had a theatrical release in Mexico in 2009.|$|E

40|$|This paper expands on {{the concept}} of <b>legal</b> <b>machine</b> which was {{presented}} first at IRIS 2011 in Salzburg. The research subjects are (1) the creation of institutional facts by machines, and (2) multimodal communication of legal content to humans. Simple examples are traffic lights and vending machines. Complicated examples are computer-based information systems in organisations, form proceedings workflows, and machines which replace officials in organisations. The actions performed by machines have legal importance and draw legal consequences. Machines similarly as humans can be imposed status-functions of legal actors. The analogy of machines with humans is in the focus of this paper. Legal content can be communicated by machines and can be perceived by all of our senses. The content can be expressed in multimodal languages: textual, visual, acoustic, gestures, aircraft manoeuvres, etc. The concept of encapsulatation of human into machine is proposed. Herein humanintended actions are communicated through the machine’s output channel. Encapsulations can be compared with deities and mythical creatures that can send gods’ messages to people through the human mouth. This paper also aims to identify law production patterns by machines...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the main}} {{obstacles}} {{to the use of}} Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in the legal domain comes from their inability to justify their reasoning. Justification indeed is crucial for the judge because it assures him that the reasoning carried out by a <b>legal</b> <b>machine</b> is legally founded. We propose in this paper a method able to overcome this constraint by developing an algorithm of justification applied to connectionist prototypes (Multilayer Perceptron) implemented at the Court of Appeal of Versailles. We will first describe the algorithm. We will then discuss the two main advantages offered by the ANN with regard to rule based systems. A first advantage consists of their suitability for some types of reasoning not based on explicit rules, which are specially numerous in the discretionary field of the judge. Another advantage can be emphasised {{as a result of our}} experiment: these models can be used for improving the self justification process of a decision maker (making it more precise) and even for predicting (or suggesting) new lines of reasoning based on implicit knowledge. Some examples extracted from a knowledge base on the contract of employment (clause of non-competition) will illustrate this point...|$|E

Manually placing every part of new {{legislative texts}} in the correct place of the hierarchy, however, is expensive and slow, and therefore naturally calls for automation. In this paper, we assess the ability of machine learning methods to develop a model that automatically classifies legislative texts in a legal topic hierarchy. It is investigated whether such methods can generalize across different codes. In the classification process, the specific properties of legislative documents are exploited. Both the hierarchical structure of legal codes and references within the legal document collection are taken into account. We argue for a closer cooperation between <b>legal</b> and <b>machine</b> learning experts as the main direction of future work...|$|R

50|$|In {{many parts}} of the world, mixed bathing was not {{generally}} allowed and moral campaigners argued that mixed bathing was immoral or immodest. Women's swimsuits were considered inherently immodest. To avoid the exposure of people in swimsuits, especially to people of the opposite sex, many popular beach resorts were commonly equipped with bathing <b>machines.</b> <b>Legal</b> segregation of beaches ended in Britain in 1901, {{and the use of the}} bathing machines declined rapidly. Another measure in the moral campaign was to ban sea bathing altogether or during daylight hours. Australian bathers were only permitted to swim during daylight hours after 1903. Before mixed bathing became culturally accepted from the late-19th century, public bathing, when permitted or practiced at all, was segregated on the basis of gender, using either separate facilities or using some form of divide or by allocation of times for use by men and women.|$|R
5000|$|Soon {{after the}} Civil War, the site became a highly frequented picnic ground {{because of its}} {{proximity}} to Mount Vernon. Steamship lines, originally established to ferry tourists from Washington D.C. and Alexandria to/from Mount Vernon, discovered {{a new source of}} revenue in the park across from the historic estate. In the 1880s, the Mount Vernon and Marshall Hall Steamboat Company ran large ships between Washington, Alexandria, Mount Vernon and Marshall Hall: the round-trip fare at that time was $1, and included admission to Mount Vernon. Washingtonians fled the summer heat of the city for all sorts of events at the picnic grounds, from exclusive catered events to popular cultural events such as a swimming exhibition given by the daredevil Robert Emmet Odlum in the summer of 1878, seven years before his death at the Brooklyn Bridge. Marshall Hall later {{became one of the first}} amusement parks in the Washington, D.C., area in the 1890s, offering numerous [...] "appliances of entertainment" [...] (as one deed described them) for visitors who wanted to do more than picnic, many of them arriving by river boat. Starting in the 1870s, annual jousting tournaments took place at the site. New attractions were added throughout the 20th century, and gambling became a major draw for a while after World War II.

40|$|Abstract. Legal text {{retrieval}} traditionally relies upon external knowledge {{sources such}} as thesauri and classification schemes, and an accurate indexing of the documents is often manually done. As a result not all legal documents can be effectively retrieved. However a number of current artificial intelligence techniques are promising for legal text retrieval. They sustain the acquisition of know-ledge and the knowledge-rich processing {{of the content of}} document texts and information need, and of their matching. Currently, techniques for learning information needs, learning concept attributes of texts, information extraction, text classification and clustering, and text summarization need to be studied in legal text retrieval because of their potential for improving retrieval and decreasing the cost of manual indexing. The resulting query and text representations are semantically much richer than a set of key terms. Their use allows for more refined retrieval models in which some reasoning can be applied. This paper gives an overview {{of the state of the}} art of these innovative techniques and their potential for legal text retrieval. Key words: case retrieval model, information discovery, <b>legal</b> text retrieval, <b>machine</b> learning. 1...|$|R

30|$|The {{classification}} of legal documents is often {{considered as a}} difficult problem. In our previous work on the categorisation of Supreme Court cases [18], we identified several reasons for this. These are the high variability in document length, presence of abstract concepts and multilingualism (for Mauritian cases). Also, cases often do not fit neatly in one category only. For example, under Mauritian laws, {{it is possible for}} a person to bring a civil law case (under the law of tort) for the criminal offence of assault, which is defined under Section 230 of the Criminal Code [19]. Another major problem with judgments which has not been mentioned before is that judgments do not contain only legal terms describing a single issue. In reality, the legal issues are usually embedded into mountains of factual information which are usually irrelevant to the legal issues which are being considered. This is the main cause of mis-classification for <b>legal</b> documents. All <b>machine</b> learning classifiers directly or indirectly rely on words and words’ frequencies to classify a document. Thus, the presence of these extra information usually has a negative impact on performance measures such as accuracy, precision, and recall. In this work, we shall study the impact of using different parts of the document on classification rate.|$|R
40|$|This Article {{sets out}} a {{possible}} trajectory for the coevolution of legal responsibility and autonomous machines. Commentators {{have responded to}} the problem of legal responsibility for harms caused by such <b>machines</b> with alreadyexisting <b>legal</b> doctrines related to defective products, agency law, and international humanitarian law, among others. There is a debate {{about the extent to which}} those doctrines in their current forms can address adequately the situations that will arise when autonomous machines become more prevalent. To the extent they do not, it is because of the law 2 ̆ 7 s general discomfort with associative responsibility, a discomfort shared and informed by most of the literature on ethics. The ethical literature most relevant to the problems of associative responsibility provides some guidance on the issue but no completely satisfactory answers. In turn, the concern that there will be gaps in responsibility for harms caused by machines leads to two interweaving lines of development. The first is to refine the concept of responsibility as a way to lessen that gap. The second is to reduce harm by designing autonomous machines with prosocial behaviors. If that second effort is successful, that very success, together with calls to grant <b>legal</b> personhood to <b>machines</b> for <b>legal</b> and pragmatic reasons and the human tendency to anthropomorphize, will strengthen what are now nascent calls to treat such machines as moral agents.
