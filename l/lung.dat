5|$|Asbestos {{can cause}} a variety of <b>lung</b> diseases, {{including}} <b>lung</b> cancer. Tobacco smoking and asbestos have a synergistic effect on the formation of <b>lung</b> cancer. In smokers who work with asbestos, the risk of <b>lung</b> cancer is increased 45-fold compared to the general population. Asbestos can also cause cancer of the pleura, called mesothelioma (which is different from <b>lung</b> cancer).|$|E
5|$|<b>Lung</b> cancer, {{also known}} as <b>lung</b> carcinoma, is a {{malignant}} <b>lung</b> tumor characterized by uncontrolled cell growth in tissues of the <b>lung.</b> This growth can spread beyond the <b>lung</b> {{by the process of}} metastasis into nearby tissue or other parts of the body. Most cancers that start in the <b>lung,</b> known as primary <b>lung</b> cancers, are carcinomas. The two main types are small-cell <b>lung</b> carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small-cell <b>lung</b> carcinoma (NSCLC). The most common symptoms are coughing (including coughing up blood), weight loss, shortness of breath, and chest pains.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lung</b> cancers are {{classified}} according to histological type. This classification {{is important for}} determining management and predicting outcomes of the disease. <b>Lung</b> cancers are carcinomas—malignancies that arise from epithelial cells. <b>Lung</b> carcinomas are categorized by the size and appearance of the malignant cells seen by a histopathologist under a microscope. For therapeutic purposes, two broad classes are distinguished: non-small-cell <b>lung</b> carcinoma and small-cell <b>lung</b> carcinoma.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the {{position}} of fissures of the <b>lungs</b> is necessary for the appreciation of lobar anatomy and thus locating the bronchopulmonary segments. METHODS: Morphological variations of fissures and lobes of the <b>lungs</b> were studied in 30 pairs of <b>lungs</b> from cadavers. RESULTS: Five right-sided <b>lungs</b> showed absence of horizontal fissure, 19 showed incomplete horizontal fissure. Eleven right-sided and 14 left-sided <b>lungs</b> showed incomplete oblique fissure and two right-sided <b>lungs</b> showed both absence of horizontal fissure and an incomplete oblique fissure. Accessory fissure was seen in three left-sided and one right-sided <b>lungs.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Awareness regarding anatomical variations is essential for performing lobectomies and segmental resection and interpreting radiological images...|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the reasons}} we can breathe is because of the {{elasticity}} of the <b>lungs.</b> The internal surface of the <b>lungs</b> on average in a non-emphysemic person is normally 63m2 and can hold about 5lts of air volume. [...] Both <b>lungs</b> together have the same amount of surface area as half of a tennis court. Disease such as, emphysema, tuberculosis, can reduce the amount of surface area and elasticity of the <b>lungs.</b> Another big factor in the elasticity of the <b>lungs</b> is smoking because of the residue left behind in the <b>lungs</b> from the smoking. The elasticity of the <b>lungs</b> can be trained to expand further.|$|R
50|$|Most extant {{lungfish}} {{species have}} two <b>lungs,</b> {{with the exception}} of the Australian lungfish, which only has one. The <b>lungs</b> of lungfish are homologous to the <b>lungs</b> of tetrapods. As in tetrapods and bichirs, the <b>lungs</b> extend from the ventral surface of the esophagus and gut.|$|R
5|$|Snakes and limbless lizards {{typically}} possess {{only the}} right <b>lung</b> {{as a major}} respiratory organ; the left <b>lung</b> is greatly reduced, or even absent. Amphisbaenians, however, have the opposite arrangement, with a major left <b>lung,</b> and a reduced or absent right <b>lung.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some {{types of}} chronic <b>lung</b> {{diseases}} {{are classified as}} restrictive <b>lung</b> disease, because of a restriction {{in the amount of}} <b>lung</b> tissue involved in respiration. These include pulmonary fibrosis which can occur when the <b>lung</b> is inflamed {{for a long period of}} time. Fibrosis in the <b>lung</b> replaces functioning <b>lung</b> tissue with fibrous connective tissue. This can be due to a large variety of occupational diseases such as Coalworker's pneumoconiosis, autoimmune diseases or more rarely to a reaction to medication.|$|E
5|$|A {{pneumothorax}} (collapsed <b>lung)</b> is {{an abnormal}} collection of {{air in the}} pleural space that causes an uncoupling of the <b>lung</b> from the chest wall. The <b>lung</b> cannot expand against the air pressure inside the pleural space. An easy to understand example is a traumatic pneumothorax, where air enters the pleural space from outside the body, as occurs with puncture to the chest wall. Similarly, a scuba diver ascending while holding their breath with their lungs fully inflated can cause air sacs (alveoli) to burst and leak high pressure air into the pleural space.|$|E
30|$|Comparing the transplanted {{with the}} non-transplanted <b>lungs,</b> we {{observed}} significantly lower MTR in the not transplanted <b>lungs</b> (p[*]=[*] 0.026). No infiltration {{was observed in}} the non-transplanted <b>lungs.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{embryonic}} development, the <b>lungs</b> {{begin to}} develop as an outpouching of the foregut, a tube which goes on to form {{the upper part of}} the digestive system. When the <b>lungs</b> are formed the fetus is held in the fluid-filled amniotic sac and so they do not function to breathe. Blood is also diverted from the <b>lungs</b> through the ductus arteriosus. At birth however, air begins to pass through the <b>lungs,</b> and the diversionary duct closes, so that the <b>lungs</b> can begin to respire. The <b>lungs</b> only fully develop in early childhood.|$|R
5000|$|The trachea and {{the first}} {{portions}} of the main bronchi are outside the <b>lungs.</b> The rest of the [...] "tree" [...] branches within the <b>lungs,</b> and ultimately extends to {{every part of the}} <b>lungs.</b>|$|R
5|$|A primary {{pneumothorax}} is {{one that}} occurs without an apparent cause {{and in the absence}} of significant <b>lung</b> disease, while a secondary pneumothorax occurs in the presence of existing <b>lung</b> disease. Smoking increases the risk as do <b>lung</b> diseases including COPD, asthma, and tuberculosis. A pneumothorax can also be caused by physical trauma to the chest (including a blast injury), or as a complication of a healthcare intervention; in which case it is called a traumatic pneumothorax.|$|E
5|$|About 8% of <b>lung</b> {{cancer is}} due to {{inherited}} factors. In relatives of people with <b>lung</b> cancer, the risk is doubled. This is likely due {{to a combination of}} genes. Polymorphisms on chromosomes 5, 6 and 15 are known to affect the risk of <b>lung</b> cancer.|$|E
5|$|At birth {{the lungs}} are very undeveloped with only around one sixth of the alveoli {{of the adult}} <b>lung</b> present. The alveoli {{continue}} to form into early adulthood, {{and their ability to}} form when necessary is seen in the regeneration of the <b>lung.</b> Alveolar septa have a double capillary network instead of the single network of the developed <b>lung.</b> Only after the maturation of the capillary network can the <b>lung</b> enter a normal phase of growth. Following the early growth in numbers of alveoli there is another stage of the alveoli being enlarged.|$|E
5|$|The <b>lungs</b> {{also serve}} a {{protective}} role. Several blood-borne substances, {{such as a}} few types of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, serotonin and bradykinin, are excreted through the <b>lungs.</b> Drugs and other substances can be absorbed, modified or excreted in the <b>lungs.</b> The <b>lungs</b> filter out small blood clots from veins and prevent them from entering arteries and causing strokes.|$|R
50|$|The oldest book <b>lungs</b> {{have been}} {{recovered}} from extinct trigonotarbid arachnids preserved in the 410-million-year-old Rhynie chert of Scotland. These Devonian fossil <b>lungs</b> are almost indistinguishable from the <b>lungs</b> of modern arachnids, fully adapted to a terrestrial existence.|$|R
5|$|Some {{invertebrates}} have lung-like {{structures that}} serve a similar respiratory purpose as, {{but are not}} evolutionarily related to, vertebrate <b>lungs.</b> Some arachnids, such as spiders and scorpions, have structures called book <b>lungs</b> used for atmospheric gas exchange. Some species of spider have four pairs of book <b>lungs</b> but most have two pairs. Scorpions have spiracles on their body for the entrance of air to the book <b>lungs.</b>|$|R
5|$|COPD {{is a type}} of obstructive <b>lung</b> {{disease in}} which chronic incompletely {{reversible}} poor airflow (airflow limitation) and inability to breathe out fully (air trapping) exist. The poor airflow is the result of breakdown of <b>lung</b> tissue (known as emphysema) and small airways disease (known as obstructive bronchiolitis). The relative contributions of these two factors vary between people. Severe destruction of small airways can lead to the formation of large air pockets—known as bullae—that replace <b>lung</b> tissue. This form of disease is called bullous emphysema.|$|E
5|$|From the 1960s, {{the rates}} of <b>lung</b> {{adenocarcinoma}} started to rise relative to other types of <b>lung</b> cancer. This {{is partly due to}} the introduction of filter cigarettes. The use of filters removes larger particles from tobacco smoke, thus reducing deposition in larger airways. However, the smoker has to inhale more deeply to receive the same amount of nicotine, increasing particle deposition in small airways where adenocarcinoma tends to arise. The incidence of <b>lung</b> adenocarcinoma continues to rise.|$|E
5|$|Idiopathic {{interstitial}} pneumonia or noninfectious pneumonia is a {{class of}} diffuse <b>lung</b> diseases. They include diffuse alveolar damage, organizing pneumonia, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia, desquamative interstitial pneumonia, respiratory bronchiolitis interstitial <b>lung</b> disease, and usual interstitial pneumonia.|$|E

Based on a {{retrospective}} analysis of 162 NHB donor procedures we found that only 5 % of the <b>lungs</b> were actually utilized, but that 30 % of the <b>lungs</b> were suitable for transplantation. Not recognizing the suitability of NHB <b>lungs</b> is likely {{the main reason for}} their non-availability...|$|R
40|$|During {{the years}} 1953 to 1957 more than 1, 000 <b>lungs</b> of coal-workers in the Wigan area were {{examined}} and compared with <b>lungs</b> from workers in South Wales.

5000|$|Gastric {{distension}} {{is potentially}} dangerous since {{it can cause}} {{the contents of the}} stomach to come up the esophagus (gullet) and spill back down into the <b>lungs.</b> This can cause drowning, by filling the <b>lungs</b> with fluid, if there has been enough material in the stomach. With lesser material, gastric distension can cause stomach acids to damage the <b>lungs</b> and create a condition known as [...] "aspiration pneumonia". The other problem this causes is that the expanded stomach will push against the <b>lungs</b> decreasing the amount of air that can be placed into the <b>lungs.</b>|$|R
5|$|If {{granulation}} tissue grows over the injured site, {{it can cause}} stenosis of the airway, after a week to a month. The {{granulation tissue}} must be surgically excised. Delayed diagnosis of a bronchial rupture increases risk of infection and lengthens hospital stay. People with a narrowed airway may suffer dyspnea, coughing, wheezing, respiratory tract infection, and difficulty with clearing secretions. If the bronchiole is completely obstructed, atelectasis occurs: the alveoli of the <b>lung</b> collapse. <b>Lung</b> tissue distal to a completely obstructed bronchiole often does not become infected. Because {{it is filled with}} mucus, this tissue remains functional. When the secretions are removed, the affected portion of the <b>lung</b> is commonly able to function almost normally. However, infection is common in lungs distal to a partially obstructed bronchiole. Infected <b>lung</b> tissue distal to a stricture can be damaged, and wheezing and coughing may develop due to the narrowing. In addition to pneumonia, the stenosis may cause bronchiectasis, in which bronchi are dilated, to develop. Even after an airway with a stricture is restored to normal, the resulting loss of <b>lung</b> function may be permanent.|$|E
5|$|Inflammatory {{conditions}} of the <b>lung</b> tissue are pneumonia, of the respiratory tract are bronchitis and bronchiolitis, and of the pleurae surrounding the lungs pleurisy. Inflammation is usually caused by infections due to bacteria or viruses. When the <b>lung</b> tissue is inflamed due to other causes it is called pneumonitis. One major cause of bacterial pneumonia is tuberculosis. Chronic infections often occur in those with immunodeficiency and can include a fungal infection by Aspergillus fumigatus {{that can lead to}} an aspergilloma forming in the <b>lung.</b>|$|E
5|$|LEMS {{is often}} {{associated}} with <b>lung</b> cancer (50–70%), specifically small-cell carcinoma, making LEMS a paraneoplastic syndrome. Of the people with small-cell <b>lung</b> cancer, 1–3% have LEMS. In most of these cases, LEMS is the first symptom of the <b>lung</b> cancer, and it is otherwise asymptomatic.|$|E

50|$|In normal breathing, the {{diaphragm}} contracts, causing the <b>lungs</b> above it to expand. This expansion draws {{air into the}} <b>lungs</b> by generating a negative pressure or vacuum.

5|$|<b>Lung</b> cancer often {{appears as}} a solitary {{pulmonary}} nodule on a chest radiograph. However, the differential diagnosis is wide. Many other diseases can also give this appearance, including metastatic cancer, hamartomas, and infectious granulomas such as tuberculosis, histoplasmosis and coccidioidomycosis. <b>Lung</b> cancer can also be an incidental finding, as a solitary pulmonary nodule on a chest radiograph or CT scan done for an unrelated reason. The definitive diagnosis of <b>lung</b> cancer is based on histological examination of the suspicious tissue {{in the context of}} the clinical and radiological features.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lung</b> cancer staging is an {{assessment}} of the degree of spread of the cancer from its original source. It is one of the factors affecting the prognosis and potential treatment of <b>lung</b> cancer.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lung</b> {{cancer was}} {{uncommon}} {{before the advent}} of cigarette smoking; it was not even recognized as a distinct disease until 1761. Different aspects of <b>lung</b> cancer were described further in 1810. Malignant <b>lung</b> tumors made up only 1% of all cancers seen at autopsy in 1878, but had risen to 10–15% by the early 1900s. Case reports in the medical literature numbered only 374 worldwide in 1912, but a review of autopsies showed the incidence of <b>lung</b> cancer had increased from 0.3% in 1852 to 5.66% in 1952. In Germany in 1929, physician Fritz Lickint recognized the link between smoking and <b>lung</b> cancer, which led to an aggressive antismoking campaign. The British Doctors' Study, published in the 1950s, was the first solid epidemiological evidence of the link between <b>lung</b> cancer and smoking. As a result, in 1964 the Surgeon General of the United States recommended smokers should stop smoking.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The pressure-volume (P-V) {{characteristics}} were investigated in 14 excised left human <b>lungs</b> and their individual lobes. Comparison {{of the upper}} and lower lobar P-V curves of the emphysema-free and emphysematous <b>lungs</b> showed no significant difference when plotted as per cent lobar volume at a transpulmonary pressure (PL) of 30 cm H 20 (V& 0). However, when in the emphysematous <b>lungs</b> the more severely involved lobes were compared with the less severely involved lobes, significant differences in the PL 60 - 90 % V 30 were found, the more severely involved <b>lungs</b> exhibiting a higher PL.
