Selfe may have lost a battle but before long, the <b>liberal</b> <b>arts</b> tradition faced still greater defeats. To these, Selfe certainly contributed, and what must be recognised {{is that in the}} vehemence of the struggle, and in the lauding of efficiency over culture, much that was valuable in the <b>liberal</b> <b>arts</b> tradition was lost.|$|E

5|$|The {{emphasis}} on <b>liberal</b> <b>arts</b> in the revised degree titles (for both the A.L.B. and A.L.M. degrees) {{was not intended}} to signify a difference in the degree itself versus the University's other offerings, but instead to serve as a response to concerns expressed by some that programs catering to non-traditional students were overly vocational in nature.
