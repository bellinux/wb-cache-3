The Allied 15th Army Group, commanded by General Sir Harold Alexander, consisted of the American Seventh Army, commanded by Lieutenant General George Patton, which would <b>land</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> west between Licata and Scoglitti, and the veteran British Eighth Army, commanded by the experienced General Bernard Montgomery, which would <b>land</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south east between Cape Passero and Syracuse.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{analyzed}} the interdecadal variation {{by applying the}} statistical change-point analysis to {{the frequency of the}} tropical cyclone (TC) that <b>landed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Korean Peninsula (KP) for the recent 54 years (1951 to 2004) and performed cluster classification of the Korea-landfall TC tracks using a Fuzzy Clustering Method (FCM). First, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interdecadal variation analysis, frequency of TC that <b>landed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> KP was largely categorized into three periods: high frequency period from 1951 to 1965, low frequency period from 1966 to 1985, and high frequency period from 1986 to 2004. The cluster analysis result of the Korea-landfall TC tracks produced the optimum number of clusters as four. In more detail, Cluster A refers to a pattern of <b>landing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southern coast <b>in</b> <b>the</b> KP starting from East China Sea followed by heading north while Cluster B refers to a pattern of <b>landing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> west coast of the Korean Peninsula, also starting from East China Sea followed by heading north. Cluster C refers to a pattern of <b>landing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southern region of <b>the</b> west coast <b>in</b> <b>the</b> KP moving from mainland China while Cluster D refers to a pattern of <b>landing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid-north region of <b>the</b> west coast <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Korean Peninsula, also moving from mainland China...|$|R

5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the American Revolution, George Rogers Clark was sent from Virginia to enforce its claim to much of the <b>land</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Great Lakes region.

The occupation was accomplished without firing a shot because Clark carried letters from the French ambassador stating that France supported the Americans. These letters made most of the French and Native American inhabitants of the area unwilling to support the British.|$|E

5|$|All Atlantic Category5 hurricanes {{have made}} {{landfall}} at some location at hurricane strength.

Sixteen of the storms made landfall while at Category5 intensity; 2007 and 2017 are the only years in which two storms made landfall at this intensity.|$|E
