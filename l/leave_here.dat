500|$|Miami's Cuban {{community}} {{came together}} {{as never before}} for the campaign, taking the opportunity to register thousands of voters who had never taken part in politics in the city. Bryant actively campaigned to the Cuban community, telling them at a rally, [...] "You came here {{to get away from}} one sin ... and it breaks my heart that if Miami becomes another Sodom and Gomorrah you may have to <b>leave</b> <b>here,</b> too." [...] A Cuban social worker [...] suggested the cause was representative of an older generation of Cuban emigres, worried that their children were being lost in the depravity of Miami. Miami's archbishop wrote a letter against the gay rights ordinance, and ordered it to be read aloud in all Catholic churches.|$|E

500|$|On August 4, 1934, President Franklin D. Roosevelt {{visited the}} {{construction}} site and {{was impressed by the}} project and its purpose. He gave a speech to workers and spectators, closing with this statement: [...] "I <b>leave</b> <b>here</b> today with the feeling that this work is well undertaken; that we are going ahead with a useful project, {{and we are going to}} see it through for the benefit of our country." [...] Soon after his visit, Reclamation was allowed to proceed with the high dam plan but faced the problems of transitioning the design and negotiating an altered contract with MWAK. In , for an additional , MWAK and Six Companies, Inc. agreed to join together as Consolidated Builders Inc. and construct the high dam. Six Companies had just finished the Hoover Dam and was nearing completion of Parker Dam. The new design, chosen and approved by the Reclamation office in Denver, included several improvements, one of which was the irrigation pumping plant.|$|E
500|$|Tender Mercies {{includes}} no original film score, and {{the musical}} soundtrack {{is limited to}} the performances of country songs and the domestic guitar playing that occur as part of the story. A score was composed for the movie, but Beresford had it removed because he felt it was [...] "too sweet" [...] and sounded phony {{in the context of the}} film, although he acknowledged it as [...] "very skillful". Duvall sang his own songs, a right he insisted be part of his contract. He commented, [...] "What's the point if you're not going to do your own ? They're just going to dub somebody else? I mean, there's no point to that." [...] The film's financial backers were initially concerned about whether he could sing well enough for the role. Those concerns were allayed after Duvall produced a tape of himself singing a cappella [...] "On the Wings of a Dove", a Bob Ferguson country song featured in the film. Duvall collaborated with Beresford in deciding on the unusual staging of the emotional scene in which Mac sings it after reflecting on the reunion with his daughter. The song is performed with Mac looking out a window with his back to the camera, his face unseen. Horton Foote thought the choice made the scene more moving and called it [...] "an extraordinary moment" [...] in the film. Duvall wrote two of Mac's other songs, [...] "Fool's Waltz" [...] and [...] "I've Decided to <b>Leave</b> <b>Here</b> Forever". Several leading country singers, including Willie Nelson, George Jones and Merle Haggard, were believed to have inspired Mac and Duvall's portrayal of him, but Duvall insisted the character was not based on anyone in particular. Another country star, Waylon Jennings, complimented his performance, saying he had [...] "done the impossible." ...|$|E

Hitler's hatred for Litten was not forgotten {{and in the early}} hours of 28 February 1933, the night of the Reichstag fire, he was rousted from his bed, arrested and taken into protective custody.

2500|$|Bierce {{is known}} to have {{accompanied}} Villa's army as far as the city of Chihuahua. His last known communication with the world was a letter he wrote there to Blanche Partington, a close friend, dated December 26, 1913. After closing this letter by saying, [...] "As to me, I <b>leave</b> <b>here</b> tomorrow for an unknown destination," [...] he vanished without a trace, his disappearance becoming {{one of the most famous}} in American literary history. Skeptic Joe Nickell argued that no letter had ever been found; all that existed was a notebook belonging to his secretary and companion, Carrie Christiansen, containing a rough summary of a purported letter and her statement that the originals had been destroyed.|$|E

2500|$|In 1915, a {{man named}} Ernest Blue wrote in the Cordova Daily Times that Wada was a Japanese spy asserting that Blue had seen cash and a map of Alaska in Wada's possession. This story reappeared in 1923 and during WWII. During May 1915, Wada was in San Pedro, California, working at Van Camp's tuna packing plant, but left town swiftly after {{receiving}} a phone call. As with many stories about Wada, the published accounts are contradictory. In the Seattle Times on May 15, 1916, Wada insisted the phone call was a job offer in Alaska, and he traveled to New York. However, on page 217 of Tani, 1995, Wada {{wrote a letter to}} his friend Sunada, written on Van Camp Sea Food Company stationery. that reads, [...] "Sorry to say but I am compelled to <b>leave</b> <b>here...</b> otherwise they will kill me." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 1, 2010, Jackson, {{after giving}} it {{tremendous}} thought and consulting with his doctors over health concerns, {{announced that he}} would return to coach the Lakers for the 2010–11 season. On August 2, 2010, Jackson signed a new contract with the Lakers to return for what he mentioned was [...] "his last stand", meaning the 2010–11 season would be his last. In January 2011, he reiterated that it would be his final season, explaining that in the past there was the possibility that maybe he would reconsider. [...] "This year, there's no maybe", said Jackson. He retired after the Lakers were swept out of the playoffs in the conference semifinals by that season's eventual NBA champions, the Dallas Mavericks, meaning that he would not get a fourth three-peat (after previously achieving that feat in 1993, 1998 and 2002). In his final news conference that season, he noted {{that he did not have}} much of a relationship with Jerry or Jim Buss, and said, [...] "When I <b>leave</b> <b>here,</b> I don't anticipate Lakers management will call me up and ask my advice." ...|$|E
