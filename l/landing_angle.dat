50|$|Clubheads usually {{approach}} the 460 cubic centimeter limit, rarely below 400 cc. They must {{stay within the}} Coefficient Of Restitution (COR) limit of 0.83, which measures how a ball hits off the surface. Most clubheads only {{approach the}} COR {{in the center of}} the club, so technology has allowed more area of the club to possess a COR of above 0.80. Thus, mishits are less affected by the newer clubheads. The loft of a long drive club is also much lower than a consumer club, sometimes around 4 or 5 degrees, as opposed to 10.5 degrees for an amateur's driver. The reason for lower lofted driver heads is to greatly reduce back spin. Too much back spin causes the ball to balloon or climb, creating a steep <b>landing</b> <b>angle</b> which does not allow the ball roll out. A flatter <b>landing</b> <b>angle</b> is desired to get the most out of the ball's forward velocity and energy.|$|E

In particular Widerøe wanted to operate an aircraft able to operate on 800 m runways. Widerøe's management stated their intent in 1988 to purchase the Dash 8; the only other alternative aircraft that could operate on the network was the CASA 212, Dornier Do 228 and an upgraded Twin Otter. None of the alternatives had a pressurized cabin. The Dash 8 would be the largest and also the most expensive alternative. The Civil Aviation Administration stated in January 1989 that the Dash 8 would not be approved for the regional airports because it would require a visual <b>landing</b> <b>angle</b> of six instead of three degrees {{and that it was}} undesirable to have to such systems. They further stated that the only alternative was to extend all the runways to 1200 m. The cost of a new or additional visual landing system was estimated at NOK 4 million per airport. To gain support for the aircraft, a Dash 8 was leased from Tyrolean Airways for demonstrations. The ministry stated that {{at the time it was}} difficult filling the Twin Otters and that additional capacity was not needed for routes in Finnmark. Widerøe's initial plan was to purchase two aircraft immediately and then take delivery of one more per year until 2000.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore how the requirements of the task and the energy-generating and energy-conserving capabilities of children with cerebral palsy relate to kinematic and mechanical energy patterns of walking. Sub-jects. Six children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy and a matched group of typically developing children participated in the study. Methods. Kinematic data were collected at 5 different walking speeds. Vertical stiffness, mechanical energy parameters, and <b>landing</b> <b>angle</b> were measured during the stance phase. Results. The affected side of the children with cerebral palsy showed greater vertical stiffness, a greater ratio of kinetic forward energy to potential energy, and a smaller <b>landing</b> <b>angle</b> when compared with those of the nonaffected lower extremity and with those of typically developing children. Discussion and Conclusion. Previous research has shown that children with cerebral palsy assumed a gait similar to an inverted pendulum on the nonaffected limb and a pogo stick on the affected limb. Our results indicate that asymmetries between lower extremities and differences from typically developing children in the <b>landing</b> <b>angle</b> of the lower extremity, vertical lower-extremity stiffness, and kinetic and potential energy profiles support the claim that walking patterns {{in children with}} spastic hemiplegic cerebral palsy emerge as a function of the resources available to them.

Results indicate that sprinkler irrigation droplet landing velocity for all sizes of droplets is not related to nozzle pressure and the values of landing velocity are very close to that of natural rainfall. The velocity horizontal component increases with radial distance while the velocity vertical component decreases with radial distance. Additionally, <b>landing</b> <b>angle</b> of all droplet sizes decreases with radial distance. The kinetic energy is decomposed into vertical component and horizontal component due to the oblique angles of droplet impact on the surface soil, and this may aggravate soil erosion. Therefore the actual oblique angle of impact should be considered in actual field conditions and measures should be taken for remediation of soil erosion if necessary. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBoth {{the design}} process and form of the {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) suboptimal guidance law (3 DSGL) are very complex. Therefore, we propose the use of two-dimensional (2 D) guidance laws to meet the guidance requirements of 3 D space. By analyzing {{the relationship between the}} flight-path angle and its projections on OXY and OXZ planes, we obtain the ideal design requirements of the guidance laws. Based on the requirements, we design a 2 D suboptimal guidance law used in the horizontal plane; combining the 2 D vertical suboptimal guidance law, we create a whole ballistic simulation of six degree-of-freedom. The results are compared with those using other three guidance modes in the case of large windage of the initial azimuth angle. When the proportional navigation guidance (PNG) law is used in the horizontal planes, the <b>landing</b> <b>angle</b> will obviously decrease. With the proposed guidance mode, the large <b>landing</b> <b>angle</b> can be realized and meet the guidance precision requirements. Moreover, the required overload can decrease to meet the control requirement. The effects of the proposed guidance mode are close to that of 3 DSGL despite its very simple form...|$|E
40|$|In {{human and}} animal running spring-like leg be-havior is found. In a spring-mass model, running proves to be self-stable in terms of {{external}} pertur-bations or variations in leg properties (e. g. <b>landing</b> <b>angle).</b> However, biological limbs are not made of springs but, rather, consist of segments where spring-like behavior can be localized at joint level. Here, we use a two-segment leg model to investigate the effects of leg compliance originating from joint level on run-ning stability. Due to leg geometry a nonlinear relationship be-tween leg force and leg compression is found. In con-trast to the linear leg spring, the segmented leg is ca-pable of reducing the minimum speed for self-stable running from 3. 5 m/s in the spring-mass model to 1. 5 m/s for almost straight joint configurations which is below the preferred transition speed from human walk-ing to running (≈ 2 m/s). At moderate speeds the tolerated range of <b>landing</b> <b>angle</b> is largely increased (17 degrees at 5 m/s) com-pared to the linear leg spring model (2 degrees). How-ever, for fast running an increase of joint stiffness is required to compensate the mechanical disadvan-tage of larger leg compression.

A five-segment planar simulation model with a visco-elastic shoulder joint and a torque generator at the shoulder joint was used to simulate the contact phase in vaulting.

The simulation model was matched to a performance of the Hecht vault by varying the visco-elastic characteristics of the shoulders and the arm–horse interface and the activation time history of the shoulder torque generator until the best match was found. Perturbing the matching simulation demonstrated that appropriate initial kinematics are necessary for a successful performance.

40|$|Vision {{plays an}} {{essential}} role in human locomotion by providing information about the environment in which we navigate. Research has focused primarily on the effects of visual deprivation on human gait during overground walking; however, overground walking introduces several limitations such as fewer steps to analyze and uncontrolled gait speed between trials. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the effect of visual deprivation on dynamic stability during treadmill walking. Fifteen participants (six older adults 69. 33 ± 4. 88 yrs. and nine young adults 22. 67 ± 1. 87 yrs.) performed two 90 -sec trials at their preferred walking speed on a treadmill: first with eyes open (EO) and then with eyes closed (EC). Prior to performing these two trials, participants walked on the treadmill approximately ten times with each lasting 12 sec to become acclimated to the treadmill. While wearing a safety harness, full-body kinematics were recorded during the two primary trials from 26 reflective markers using an 8 -camera motion capture system. Spatial gait parameters including step length, step width, and foot <b>landing</b> <b>angle</b> were computed for both walking conditions. Measurements of dynamic stability were calculated as the variability (i. e., the standard deviation) of all gait parameters. Analyses of variance with repeated measures were used to analyze the gait parameters and stability measurements. The between-subject factor was the age (young vs. older) and the within-subject factor was the condition (EO vs. EC). Our results revealed no significant age by condition effect for all measurements of interest. However, a significant main effect of condition was detected for step length (p 3 ̆c 0. 001), foot angle (p 3 ̆c 0. 001), step length variability (p = 0. 003), foot angle variability (p 3 ̆c 0. 001), and step width variability (p 3 ̆c 0. 001). Specifically, both age groups took a shorter step with reduced foot <b>landing</b> <b>angle</b> during EC walking in comparison with EO walking. Similarly, both age groups demonstrated reduced stability as indicated by the elevated variability of the step length, step width, and foot <b>landing</b> <b>angle</b> during EC gait than during EO gait. Our findings showed that both young and older adults adopted a “cautious gait” when walking without visual input. Furthermore, the dynamic stability was deteriorated while walking with visual information removed. Visual deprivation seems to affect both age groups equally. Although the finding from this project could provide guidance for designing fall prevention interventions targeting individuals with visual impairments, more studies based on large sample sizes are needed to examine comprehensively the impact of visual deprivation on dynamic stability and the risk of falls among humans...|$|E
40|$|The {{adjustment}} {{of the leg}} during running was addressed using a spring-mass model with a fixed <b>landing</b> <b>angle</b> of attack. The objective was to obtain periodic movement patterns. Spring-like running was monitored bya one-dimensional stride-to-stride mapping of the apex height to identify mechanically stable fixed points. We found that for certain angles of attack, the system becomes self-stabilized if the leg stiffness was properly adjusted and a minimum running speed was exceeded. At a given speed, running techniques fulfilling a stable movement pattern are characterized byan almost constant maximum leg force. With increasing speed, the leg adjustment becomes less critical.

40|$|Abstract. —Catch-and-release angling {{of black}} bass Micropterus spp. during the parental care period {{may lead to}} brood {{predation}} and premature nest abandonment. Furthermore, physiological disturbance incurred while <b>landing</b> <b>angled</b> males may impair their ability to provide parental care long after release. To assess the extent of this physiological disturbance, we examined the relative energetic expenditures of nesting (N 5 4) and nonnesting (N 5 2) male largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides exposed to staged angling events in experimental ponds. Information on fish locomotion, through activity of the axial musculature, was remotely collected using electromyogram trans-mitters. During angling, nonnesting fish fought with a higher intensity, probably expending sig-nificantly more energy than did nesting fish. In addition, although the locomotory activity of nonnesting fish appeared to recover as early as 2 h after angling release, the locomotory activity of nesting fish was still impaired 24 h postangling. Overall mean activity for 24 h postrelease was 98 % of basal for nonnesting fish, but only 63 % for nesting fish. The reduced energetic capability of a nesting male largemouth bass following angling, together with brood predation incurred {{as a result of}} the temporary removal of that fish from the nest during angling, increases the likelihood of that male abandoning his brood prematurely.
