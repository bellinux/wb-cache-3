25|$|Milton was an {{important}} town in early Otago - {{much more so than}} it is today - mainly due to its location on the route to the goldfields, and also for the Bruce Woollen Mills, which were among the province's largest factories. Other prominent industries included the Kiwi Bacon Factory, which had a branch in Milton until the early 1980s. The town's importance in communication {{in the early years of}} New Zealand settlement is emphasised by it being one of the two centres first linked by <b>long-distance</b> <b>telephony,</b> with a pioneering line set up between Milton and Dunedin in February 1878. It was not until the early twentieth century that it was superseded in size by the now considerably larger local town of Balclutha. The town was also important in education in early Otago - the Tokomairiro School - now split into Milton Primary School and Tokomairiro High School - was founded in 1856, only eight years after the founding of the province itself, and was one of the province's leading schools for many years thereafter.|$|E

However, the figures for the late 1990 s strongly depend upon assumptions regarding market structure and price elasticity. Nevertheless, the results suggest that the potential relative welfare losses are not negligible. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{thermionic}} triode, {{a vacuum}} tube invented in 1907, enabled amplified radio technology and <b>long-distance</b> <b>telephony.</b> The triode, however, was a fragile device that consumed {{a substantial amount}} of power. In 1909 physicist William Eccles discovered the crystal diode oscillator. German physicist Julius Edgar Lilienfeld filed a patent for a field-effect transistor (FET) in Canada in 1925, which was intended to be a solid-state replacement for the triode. Lilienfeld also filed identical patents in the United States in 1926 and 1928. However, Lilienfeld did not publish any research articles about his devices nor did his patents cite any specific examples of a working prototype. Because the production of high-quality semiconductor materials was still decades away, Lilienfeld's solid-state amplifier ideas would not have found practical use in the 1920s and 1930s, even if such a device had been built. In 1934, German inventor Oskar Heil patented a similar device in Europe.|$|E
50|$|A triode is an {{electronic}} amplifying vacuum tube (or valve in British English) consisting of three electrodes inside an evacuated glass envelope: a heated filament or cathode, a grid, {{and a plate}} (anode). Developed from Lee De Forest's 1906 Audion, a partial vacuum tube that added a grid electrode to the thermionic diode (Fleming valve), the triode was the first practical electronic amplifier and the ancestor {{of other types of}} vacuum tubes such as the tetrode and pentode. Its invention founded the electronics age, making possible amplified radio technology and <b>long-distance</b> <b>telephony.</b> Triodes were widely used in consumer electronics devices such as radios and televisions until the 1970s, when transistors replaced them. Today, their main remaining use is in high-power RF amplifiers in radio transmitters and industrial RF heating devices. In recent years there has been a resurgence in demand for low power triodes due to renewed interest in tube-type audio systems by audiophiles who prefer its sound.|$|E

Since the majority of their sunk costs are concerned with laying and maintaining optical fibre (as well as the equipment to light up the fibre plant), these operators would like to carry both classes of traffic (data and voice) over a single core network.

The net result of these pressures is that core IP networks have become increasingly complex.

We bother because this is a rarely documented incidence of corporate activism surging to rescue a legendary company from persistent strategy failure.

The story gives you hope that there are large untapped reserves in your company as there were in AT&T [...] reserves you could harness for strategy making. The lesson is simple: strategy is far too important to leave to the usual suspects, the people with titles and long corporate histories of predictable behaviour.

Perhaps you can learn from the activists within AT&T so that you will outlive them in the corporate struggle for survival.
