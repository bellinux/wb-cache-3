40|$|In this thesis, {{a review}} of <b>linguistic</b> <b>reference</b> {{identifies}} four entities (speaker, hearer, term, and object) and their interrelations as falling {{under the umbrella of}} reference. This review brings to light certain underdeveloped areas of research into <b>linguistic</b> <b>reference,</b> and the second chapter addresses these gaps by distinguishing between the experiences of speaker and hearer as regards <b>linguistic</b> <b>reference,</b> differentiating between the cognitive processes required by each interlocutor, asking how the speaker establishes reference pre-utterance, and drawing on various pragmatic, philosophic, and semantic approaches and theories to see how they could begin to approach for this important issue. A holistic rethinking of reference reveals that it is both cognitive and communicative, but also importantly engaged in users 2 ̆ 7 embodied experience. This thesis concludes by discussing the relationship between philosophy and linguistics and pushes for an interdisciplinary study of <b>linguistic</b> <b>reference</b> requiring attention in philosophy, semantics, and cognitive studies. ...|$|R

50|$|Despite {{their ethnic}} Greek origin, the {{contemporary}} Grecophone Muslims of Turkey regarding their identity have been steadily assimilated into the Turkish-speaking (and {{in the northeast}} Laz-speaking) Muslim population. Apart from their elders, sizable numbers, even the young within these Grecophone Muslim communities have retained a knowledge of Greek and or its dialects such as Cretan Greek and Pontic Greek, though very few are likely to call themselves Greek Muslims. This is due to gradual assimilation into Turkish society, {{as well as the}} close association of Greece and Greeks with Orthodox Christianity and their perceived status as a historic, military threat to the Turkish Republic. In Greece, Greek-speaking Muslims are not usually considered as forming part of the Greek nation. In the late Ottoman period (particularly following the Greco-Turkish war of 1897 - 98) several communities of Grecophone Muslims from Crete and southern Greece were also relocated to Libya, Lebanon and Syria, where in towns like al-Hamidiyah some of the older generation continue to speak Greek.

40|$|Why should {{expressions}} like 'you {{son of a}} bitch ' or 'you swine ' {{carry the}} connotations that they do, when 'you son of a kangaroo ' or 'you polar bear ' have no meaning whatever? —Edmund Leach This essay explores how language—specifically non-literal <b>linguistic</b> <b>references</b> to dogs in contemporary U. S. English—can unconsciously and perniciously reinforce narratives of oppression and domination. References to dogs in metaphors, similes, and idiom reflect how they act as figurative stand-ins for both the Self and the Other in American society. The unique status of dogs as quasi-persons and their pervasiveness in society makes them easily understood representations of those whose personhood is challenged or compromised by the dominant culture. Dogs ' explicit status as subservient—and as servants—often marks such linguistic usage as affirming the status quo. The goal of this essay is to place the cultural narratives about who and what dogs are in an explicit relationship, both with the <b>linguistic</b> <b>references</b> to dogs and with empirical studies of canines and their relations with humans. The intention is to create a greater conscious consideration of the implications of references to dogs in everyday speech, {{based on the assumption that}} it is only through unpacking the presuppositions encoded in language that the mythology underlying linguistic usage can be reveale...|$|E

We modify ideas from previous automatic morphological rules acquisition approaches, where the input requirements has become constraints to develop the analyser for under-resourced language. This work introduces three main steps in acquiring the rules from the under-resourced language, which are morphological data acquisition, morphological information validation and morphological rules extraction. The experiment shows that this approach gives successful results with 0. 76 of precision and 0. 99 of recall. Our findings also suggest that the availability of <b>linguistic</b> <b>references</b> and the selection of assorted techniques for morphology analysis could lead to the design of the workflow.

This study draws on a content analysis of 22 qualitative interviews with students, parents, teachers, and administrators to explore language used to refer to students with disabilities.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} studies {{a question}} of longstanding interest {{in the philosophy of}} language, which I call the "Reference Determination Question. " The question is: what determines that a linguistic expression (such as a name, indexical, demonstrative, or description) refers to a particular thing? In one way or another, the question seeks a reduction of reference in terms of other features of speakers, words, and the things to which they refer. Until the work of Saul Kripke and Keith Donnellan in the 1960 s and 1970 s, such a reduction seemed available. According to what I call the "Condition View," the <b>reference</b> of a <b>linguistic</b> expression is whatever, if anything, uniquely satisfies the conditions that the user of the expression associates with it. I show how this view fits within a broader picture of language, which I call the "Capture Picture. " The Capture Picture envisions <b>linguistic</b> <b>reference</b> as a speaker's reaching out from her interior experience to capture a particular thing in the world outside that experience. Kripke's and Donnellan's criticisms of the Condition View led to its widespread rejection, but not, I argue, to radical revision of the Capture Picture. I press the same form of argument that they employed against the Condition View against replacements for it that remain within the Capture Picture. I suggest that this expansion of the Kripke-Donnellan critique has not been pursued because of Kripke's influential distinction between "speaker's reference" and "semantic reference" and I explain why this distinction does not in fact track a substantive difference, and does not block my arguments. My criticism of alternative views within the Capture Picture reveals a parallel between <b>linguistic</b> <b>reference</b> and sensory perception: both are ways of experiencing things that are present in one's sensory or cognitive environment. I defend this parallel, and show how it makes available a replacement for the Capture Picture that I call "Referential Direct Realism. " Referential Direct Realism is the counterpart, for referential experience, of the position usually called "Direct Realism" or "Naïve Realism" about perceptual experience. It holds that linguistic referring experience is direct cognitive contact with the objects to which one refers. On this view of linguistic referring experience, the Reference Determination Question does not arise. For there is no gulf to be bridged between what is inside the speaker's experience (the linguistic expression) and what is outside (the object). I argue for Referential Direct Realism and show how it points the philosophical study of <b>linguistic</b> <b>reference,</b> and language in general, in a different direction from those that traditionally have been followed...|$|R
40|$|We have {{outfitted}} {{a mobile}} research robot with several sensors and algorithms designed to facilitate small- and large-scale navigation and natural language interaction. We {{begin with a}} parser using a large, hand-crafted English grammar and lexicon. We then add a standard gradient navigation algorithm for local obstacle avoidance, and a line segment comparison algorithm for basic, high-performance location recognition. The result is a full end-to-end system for natural-language-driven, mobile robotics research. The theme of grounding-mapping <b>linguistic</b> <b>references</b> to the corresponding real-world entities-runs throughout our approach. After the parser simplifies linguistic symbols and structures, we must connect them to the basic concepts that they represent, and then to our system's specific sensor readings and motor commands, to make natural language interaction possible. Additionally, many of the symbols we must ground are indexicals with critical contextual dependencies. We must therefore handle the implicit context that spatial communication carries with it. by Charles W. Kehoe. Thesis (M. Eng.)

In three experiments we examine the source and extent of these associations by testing whether people implicitly associate abstract social status indicators with concrete representations of spatial topography (level versus mountainous land) and relatively abstract representations of cardinal direction (south and north). Experiment 1 demonstrates speeded performance during an Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald et al., 1998) when average social status is paired with level topography and high status with mountainous topography. Experiments 2 and 3 demonstrate a similar effect but with relatively abstract representations of cardinal direction (south and north), with speeded performance when average and powerful social status are paired with south and north coordinate space, respectively. Abstract concepts of social status are perceived and understood in an inherently spatial world, resulting in powerful associations between abstract social concepts and concrete and abstract notions of physical axes. These associations may prove influential in guiding daily judgments and actions...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the effects of LSD on mental time travel during {{spontaneous}} mentation. Twenty healthy volunteers participated in a placebo-controlled crossover study, incorporating intravenous administration of LSD (75 μg) and placebo (saline) prior to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Six independent, blind judges analysed mentation reports acquired during structured interviews performed shortly after the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans (approximately 2. 5 h post-administration). Within each report, specific <b>linguistic</b> <b>references</b> to mental spaces for the past, present and future were identified. Results revealed significantly fewer mental spaces for the past under LSD and this effect correlated with the general intensity of the drug’s subjective effects. No differences in the number of mental spaces for the present or future were observed. Consistent with the previously proposed role of the default-mode network (DMN) in autobiographical memory recollection and ruminative thought, decreased resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) within the DMN correlated with decreased mental time travel to the past. These results are discussed in relation to potential therapeutic applications of LSD and related psychedelics, e. g. in the treatment of depression, for which excessive reflection on one’s past, likely mediated by DMN functioning, is symptomatic...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{defining}} features of human language is displacement, {{the ability to}} make reference to absent entities.

We also show that chimpanzees—who can point for things they want humans to give them—do not point to refer to absent entities in the same way. These results demonstrate that the ability to communicate about absent but mutually known entities depends not on language, but rather on deeper social-cognitive skills that make acts of <b>linguistic</b> <b>reference</b> possible in the first place. These nonlinguistic skills for displaced reference emerged apparently only after humans' divergence from great apes some 6 million years ago...|$|R
