25|$|A turf-sided lock is {{an early}} form of canal lock design that uses earth banks to form the lock chamber, {{subsequently}} attracting grasses and other vegetation, instead of the now more familiar and widespread brick, stone, or concrete <b>lock</b> <b>wall</b> constructions. This early lock design was most often used on river navigations in the early 18th century {{before the advent of}} canals in Britain. The sides of the turf-lock are sloping so, when full, the lock is quite wide. Consequently, this type of lock needs more water to operate than vertical-sided brick- or stone-walled locks. On British canals and waterways most turf-sided locks have been subsequently rebuilt in brick or stone, and so only a few good examples survive, such as at Garston Lock, and Monkey Marsh Lock, on the Kennet and Avon Canal.|$|E
25|$|Rotating-sector gates. Some {{of these}} work very like {{traditional}} swinging gates, but with each gate {{in the form}} of a sector of a cylinder. They close by rotating out from the <b>lock</b> <b>wall</b> and meeting in the centre of the chamber. Water is let in or out by opening the gates slightly: there are no paddles or other lock gear. The lock at Limehouse Basin, which gives access to the River Thames, is an example. A dramatically large one can be seen at the Maeslantkering (huge flood gates) near Rotterdam. There is a different type at the sea lock on the Ribble Link: this is a rising sector gate, which has a horizontal axis: the gate drops to the bed of the river to allow boats to pass.|$|E

50|$|The lock was {{originally}} {{built as a}} single lock, but like Snakeholme lock, {{it was found that}} at low tides there was not enough depth to get over the bottom cill, so a second chamber was added.
