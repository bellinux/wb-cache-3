500|$|The use of {{the order}} name [...] "Rodentia" [...] is {{attributed}} to the English traveler and naturalist Thomas Edward Bowdich (1821).

The hares, rabbits and pikas (order <b>Lagomorpha)</b> have continuously growing incisors, as do rodents, and were at one time included in the order. However, they have an additional pair of incisors in the upper jaw and the two orders have quite separate evolutionary histories. The phylogeny of the rodents places them in the clades Glires, Euarchontoglires and Boreoeutheria.
