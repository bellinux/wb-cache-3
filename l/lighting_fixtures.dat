5|$|The Otis {{elevators}} are {{spanned by}} a series of neo-deco light bands extending wall to wall. The lobby extends completely through the block, with a giant entrance hall at Monroe Street and a 16-story full-height atrium in the link between the AT and USG towers (also designed by Smith) as both towers share a common appearance. The building boasts two public lobbies and a mezzanine-level lobby. The lobbies are among the most lavish in Chicago, and they are all decorated with patterned marble floors and walls, bronze, gold-leaf oak trim, and stylized <b>lighting</b> <b>fixtures.</b>|$|E
5|$|The tunnel reopened {{to service}} on September 24, 2007, with tunnel routes {{modified}} to group common destinations together. Stations were given new entrance signs, <b>lighting</b> <b>fixtures,</b> electronic passenger information signs, and restored paint. The peak bus-only restrictions on 3rd Avenue remained in {{place after the}} reopening, along with the skip-stop service that Metro implemented on the street. The tunnel was temporarily closed for nine days in December after a computer glitch disrupted the tunnel's new emergency-control system, which was repaired and replaced.|$|E
5|$|ArtRave's {{concept and}} name {{are derived from}} the {{similarly}} named release party for Artpop. The stage resembled a cave and consisted of two sections connected by catwalks made of translucent lucite, allowing the audience to move underneath the catwalks while still being able to watch the show. Gaga's costumes in the show included one with tentacles, one with bejeweled wings, a rave-inspired outfit and a necklace made of marijuana leaves. Costume designers and choreographers aspired to make a single, coherent show. The <b>lighting</b> <b>fixtures</b> used for the concert were from Clay Paky and the main idea was to create an immersive rave experience with the lights. They were also designed to accommodate minor changes in the show sequences.|$|E

40|$|Digitally {{addressable}} {{lighting systems}} offer tremendous opportunities for performance {{monitoring and control}} of individual <b>light</b> <b>fixtures.</b> However, the locations of individual <b>light</b> <b>fixtures</b> within a building are not easily differentiable; as such, facility managers cannot easily distinguish and control each fixture. Virtual models contain semantic representation of objects which enable users to visually identify, distinguish and interactively monitor and control building components. To monitor and control <b>light</b> <b>fixtures</b> from these models, each physical fixture needs to be tightly integrated with its virtual representation such as to enable bi-directional coordination. Bi-directional coordination between virtual models and physical <b>light</b> <b>fixtures</b> offers tremendous opportunities for enhancing progress monitoring during construction, and performance monitoring and control during the operations and maintenance phase. Thus, this paper presents an approach to component-level cyber-physical systems integration using <b>light</b> <b>fixtures</b> as an example. A system architecture describing the enabling technologies and their roles is presented and a practical implementation is also presented to demonstrate the functionality and utility of the proposed approach. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5|$|In August 2008, Skanska {{was awarded}} the $150-million design–build {{contract}} to build the new bridge. Skanska started driving test pilings into {{the ground in the}} later part of 2008. In May 2009, public voting for the aesthetic design features of the bridge decided that the cables would be blue, the pylon tops would be slanted with railings, and the <b>lighting</b> <b>fixtures</b> for the walkway would have a nautical theme. The test pilings for the bridge were completed in June 2009. Construction of the pylons began in July 2009 with the pouring of concrete into the first pylon. By December 2009, construction had begun on the approach foundations and the edge girders, with work continuing on the pylon towers and the side abutments. The completion of the design phase of the project {{and the beginning of the}} concrete pour for the bridge deck took place in April 2010. In May 2010, the bridge received $1.79 million in federal funding for the pedestrian and bike paths. By this time, the new Indian River Inlet Bridge was about halfway complete.|$|E

25|$|A common {{criticism}} of full cutoff <b>lighting</b> <b>fixtures</b> {{is that they}} are sometimes not as aesthetically pleasing to look at. This is most likely because historically {{there has not been a}} large market specifically for full cutoff fixtures, and because people typically like to see the source of illumination. Due to the specificity with their direction of light, full cutoff fixtures sometimes also require expertise to install for maximum effect.|$|E

25|$|As {{in other}} works by Metzinger {{of the same}} period, there are {{elements}} to be found of the real world, e.g., <b>lighting</b> <b>fixtures,</b> flowers, feathers and lace. The rest of the canvas consists {{of a series of}} crescendos and diminuendos of greater or lesser abstraction, of convex and concave forms, of hyperbolic and spherical surfaces, that stem from the teachings of Georges Seurat and Paul Cézanne. The Divisionist brushwork, mosaic-like 'cubes', present in his Neo-Impressionst phase (circa 1903 through 1907) have returned giving texture and rhythm to vast areas of the canvas, visible both in the figures and background.|$|E

25|$|Direct skyglow {{is reduced}} by {{selecting}} <b>lighting</b> <b>fixtures</b> which {{limit the amount of}} light emitted above the horizontal (90° above the nadir). Indirect skyglow produced by reflections from illuminated surfaces is harder to manage; effective methods for limiting it include the use of low-impact lamp types (e.g. amber sources, see above), minimizing over-illumination and inefficient designs or fixtures that spread light where it is not needed. But it has {{to be taken into account}} that, according to late 2010 publications, Italian regions using full cut off lighting only does not increase skyglow. Anyway, light reflected upwards by dark surfaces such as roads or buildings can be considered as minor, so debate about the contribution of indirect skyglow will continue.|$|E
