40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: Previous {{studies have}} shown that {{selected}} strains of Lactobacillus have the capacity to antagonize rotavirus-induced diarrhea. However, only a few reports have documented their efficacy against nonrotavirus diarrhea. This study involved an experimental investigation and a clinical trial of the antisecretory activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LB in the context of nonrotavirus diarrhea. METHODS: The activity of a culture of <b>L.</b> acidophilus <b>LB</b> or of the lyophilized, heat-killed <b>L.</b> acidophilus <b>LB</b> bacteria plus their spent culture medium was tested in inhibiting the formation of fluid-formed domes in cultured human intestinal Caco- 2 /TC 7 cell monolayers infected with diarrheagenic, diffusely adhering Afa/Dr Escherichia coli C 1845 bacteria. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of male or female children who were 10 months of age and presented with nonrotavirus, well-established diarrhea was conducted to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of a pharmaceutical preparation that contains 10 billion heat-killed <b>L.</b> acidophilus <b>LB</b> plus 160 mg of spent culture medium. RESULTS: Infection of the cells with C 1845 bacteria that were treated with <b>L.</b> acidophilus <b>LB</b> culture or the lyophilized, heat-killed <b>L.</b> acidophilus <b>LB</b> bacteria plus their culture medium produced a dosage-dependent {{decrease in the number of}} fluid-formed domes as compared with cells that were infected with untreated C 1845 bacteria. The clinical results show that in selected and controlled homogeneous groups of children with well-established, nonrotavirus diarrhea, adding lyophilized, heat-killed <b>L.</b> acidophilus <b>LB</b> bacteria plus their culture medium to a solution of oral rehydration solution shortened by 1 day the recovery time (ie, the time until the first normal stool was passed) as compared with children who received placebo oral rehydration solution. CONCLUSIONS: Heat-killed <b>L.</b> acidophilus <b>LB</b> plus its culture medium antagonizes the C 1845 -induced increase in paracellular permeability in intestinal Caco- 2 /TC 7 cells and produces a clinically significant benefit in the management of children with nonrotavirus, well-established diarrhea...|$|R

40|$|Background: There is an {{increasing}} interest in search for antimicrobial peptides (bacteriocins and bacteriocin-like compounds) produced by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) because of their potential {{to be used as}} antimicrobial agents for improving the safety of food products. Objectives: The main objective of study was to evaluate the antibacterial potential of locally isolated Lactic Acid bacteria (LAB) and determine their bacteriocin producing ability in in-vitro conditions. Materials and Methods: The antibacterial activity of 77 isolated LAB strains was tested against a number of pathogens by well-diffusion method. The isolates demonstrating antimicrobial potential were selected and tested for the production of bacteriocin or bacteriocin like substance. The bacteriocin produced by two of the isolates were partially purified and characterized. Results: The results indicated the neutralized supernatant fluid of two of the isolates identified as <b>L.</b> brevis <b>LB</b> 32 and <b>L.</b> pentosus LP 05, were active against the growth of Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enteritidis, Shigella dysenteriae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Additionally, <b>L.</b> brevis <b>LB</b> 32 was able to inhibit the growth of Salmonella typhi and Klebsiella pneumoniae, while, S. pnuemoniae and L. monocytogenes appeared to be the most sensitive strain as apparent by highest zone of inhibition against these pathogens, respectively. The antimicrobial activity in the supernatant fluids of the mentioned strains remained unaffected after treating with enzymes catalase, lipase and lysozyme, while were strongly sensitive to the action of proteolytic enzymes, suggesting the presence of bacteriocin like inhibitory substance (BLIS) in the two isolates. The inhibitory substance produced by the two isolates appeared heat resistant and tolerated 100 ˚C and 121 ˚C for 55 minutes and 20 minutes, respectively. Partial purification of the concentrated culture supernatant fluids of <b>L.</b> brevis <b>LB</b> 32 and <b>L.</b> pentosus LP 05 by ammonium sulphate (80 %) and DEAE cellulose columns resulted in an enhanced activity (AU/mL) and yield. Using different pore size ultra filter membranes and SDS-PAGE analysis, the approximate molecular weight of the BLIS produced by <b>L.</b> brevis <b>LB</b> 32 and, <b>L.</b> pentosus LP 05 appeared to be approximately 4. 5 and 6 KDa, respectively. In contrast to <b>L.</b> brevis <b>LB</b> 32, <b>L.</b> pentosus LP 05 harbored an 18 Kb plasmid DNA which appeared to be carrying the bacteriocin gene as evident by plasmid curing experiments.

In particular, the minimum threshold moisture content required for the instability, is shown to depend only upon environmental stratification and the vertical distribution of latent heat, while the preferred marginally unstable wavelength, {{in addition to being}} dependent on the stratification and the heating distribution, is also proportional to the inverse of the Coriolis parameter. A CISK index, which is defined as the ratio of a characteristic boundary layer specific humidity to the minimum threshold specific humidity of CISK, is used for assessing the relative potential for the CISK development in the Atlantic and the Pacific polar oceanic air masses, compared with that in a tropical oceanic air mass. The limitation arising from use of a constant heating profile in the interpretation of the short wave cut-off is demonstrated. The criterion for short wave blow-up is analogous to that of convective instability. The necessary and sufficient condition for the presence of short wave cut-off and wave selection is that the threshold moisture content at the shortest wave exceeds the minimum threshold moisture content. The treatment of the unconditional heating intensity is also discussed. 1.

E 3 is also a component (referred to as L protein) of the glycine cleavage system in bacterial metabolism (2). Active E 3 forms a homodimer with four distinctive subdomain structures (FAD binding, NAD+ binding, central and interface domains) with non-covalently but tightly bound FAD in the holoenzyme. Deduced amino acids from cloned full-length human E 3 gene showed a total of 509 amino acids with a leader sequence (N-terminal 35 amino acids) that is excised (mature form) during transportation of expressed E 3 into mitochondria membrane. So far, three-dimensional structure of human E 3 has not been reported. Our effort to achieve the elucidation of the X-ray crystal structure of human E 3 will be presented. Recombinant pPROEX- 1 expression vector (from GIBCO BRL Life Technologies) having the human E 3 gene without leader sequence was constructed by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and subsequent ligation, and cloned in E. coli XL 1 -Blue by transformation. Since pPROEX- 1 vector has an internal His-tag (six histidine peptide) located at the upstream region of a multicloning site, one-step affinity purification of E 3 using nickelnitriloacetic acid (Ni-NTA) agarose resin, which has a strong affinity to His-tag, was feasible. Also a seven-amino-acid spacer peptide and a recombinant tobacco etch virus protease recognition site (seven amino acids peptide) found between His-tag and first amino acid of expressed E 3 facilitated the cleavage of His-tag from E 3 after the affinity purification. By IPTG induction, ca. 15 mg of human E 3 (mature form) was obtained from 1 <b>L</b> <b>LB</b> culture with overnight incubation at 25 C. Over 98 % of purity of E 3 from one-step Ni-NTA agarose affinity purification was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis. For crystallization, E 3 samples were prepared with and without His-tag. To minimize the aggregation of E 3, apo- and holo- forms of E 3 s were tested, {{as well as a}} mutated E 3. Dynamic light scattering measurements revealed that the E 3 preparations without His-tag and substrate are highly monodispersive with regard to homodimers.

The addition of LB 1 - 7 or glycerol alone did not modify EHEC survival in RF.

The bactericidal activity of <b>L.</b> reuteri <b>LB</b> 1 - 7, the concentration of glycerol required and the level of HPA produced depended on physiological and ecological environments. In vitro experiments also showed that EHEC inoculated in rumen fluid and exposed to L. reuteri and glycerol had a very limited growth in rectal contents.

5000|$|The {{presence}} of virus-like particles in Leishmania hertigi was first reported in 1974. Various molecular descriptions of Leishmaniavirus were revealed over the subsequent decade, and mostly performed on {{members of the}} South American L. (Viannia) subgenus of parasites (which carries the LRV1 species) such as L. guyanensis (L.g) [...] and then later in <b>L.</b> braziliensis (<b>L.b).</b> Recently, interest in these microbial viruses has been renewed by a finding that they {{may play a role}} in leishmanial pathology.|$|R
40|$|The bacteriocinogenicity of Lactococcus lactis ATCC 11454, Pediococcus pentosaceus ATCC 43200, P. pentosaceus ATCC 43201, Lactobacillus plantarum BN, <b>L.</b> plantarum <b>LB</b> 592, <b>L.</b> plantarum <b>LB</b> 75, and Lactobacillus acidophilus N 2 against Clostridium botulinum spores at 4, 10, 15, and 35 degrees C was {{investigated}} by modified deferred and simultaneous antagonism methods. All the strains, except L. acidophilus N 2, produced inhibition zones on lawns of C. botulinum spores at 30 degrees C. L. plantarum BN, L. lactis ATCC 11454, and P. pentosaceus ATCC 43200 and 43201 were bacteriocinogenic at 4, 10, and 15 degrees C. Supplementation of {{brain heart infusion}} agar with 0 to 5 % NaCl increased the radii of inhibition zones during simultaneous antagonism assays. Detectable bacteriocin activities were extracted from freeze-thawed agar cultures of L. plantarum BN and L. lactis ATCC 11454 which had been grown at 4 and 10 degrees C. These results suggest that low levels of L. plantarum BN or L. lactis ATCC 11454, {{in the presence of}} 3 or 4 % NaCl, could be formulated into minimally processed refrigerated food products for protection against possible botulism hazards...|$|R
