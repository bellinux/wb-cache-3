40|$|Focusing on the <b>local</b> <b>financing</b> {{constraint}} sheds {{new light}} on issues of aid, fiscal reform, and the management of public spending. The fungibility of aid need not translate into resource flows to fill the <b>local</b> <b>financing</b> gap. Indeed, project aid can widen the <b>local</b> <b>financing</b> gap. To augment direct <b>local</b> <b>financing</b> of development, aid must be nonproject aid that can generate local currency. In the longer term, project aid's effect on <b>local</b> <b>financing</b> lies in its impact on growth and on expanding the base for tax revenues, seigniorage, and borrowing. When inadequate <b>local</b> <b>financing</b> limits project implementation and effective use of aid, local currency funds are more valuable than project aid, at the margin [...] and it becomes important to reallocate local funds, to leverage project aid, and to raise the quality of investment projects. A persistent gap in <b>local</b> <b>financing</b> complicates programs of fiscal reform. For such programs to be effective, the <b>local</b> <b>financing</b> gap has to be confronted directly by matching planned local fund expenditures against expected local fund receipts. This requires a transparent database to develop indicators and to monitor the allocation and use of local resources.
