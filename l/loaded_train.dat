500|$|Each car is {{equipped}} with four three-phase asynchronous [...] motors, giving each three-car unit a power output of [...] In each car, the four motors are fed by the car's own insulated-gate bipolar transistor. They transform the 750volt direct current collected from the third rail shoe to the three-phase alternating current used in the motors. The frequency and amplitude of the current fed to the engines varies depending on the train's speed. The MX3000 introduced regenerative brakes, that allow the electromagnetic brakes to feed power back to the power supply when braking. In addition, there is a back-up disc brake on each axle. Acceleration in the range [...] is limited to 1.3meters per second squared (4.3ft/s2). In this phase, the fully <b>loaded</b> <b>train</b> uses 5.0kiloampere. For use in areas without a third rail, such as at depots, the trains are equipped with a 110V battery. This removes the need for shunting at the depots, and makes maintenance more cost efficient. Energy usage is reduced by 30%, estimated to save the operating company NOK13 million per year, compared to using the old stocks.|$|E

The most serious incident occurred on 2 June 2015, when a <b>loaded</b> <b>train</b> collided with an empty test train, causing serious injuries to a number of riders. Subsequently, Merlin Entertainments decided to close The Smiler, Saw – The Ride at Thorpe Park, and two other roller coasters at Chessington World of Adventures (all of which have since reopened) while safety protocols and procedures were evaluated. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) served a Prohibition Notice upon the Smiler, preventing the ride's use until remedial action had been completed. On 27 July 2015, it was stated by Merlin Entertainments chief executive Nick Varney that The Smiler would [...] "not be opening this summer". The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) initiated a criminal investigation that focused on the actions of two employees – a ride engineer and a ride operator – who may have failed to follow basic safety protocols leading up to the accident.|$|E

However, its therapeutic effect remains undefined {{due to the}} unclear nature of diaphragmatic mobilization during IMT. Diaphragmatic mobilization, represented by transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi), and neural respiratory drive, expressed as the corrected root mean square (RMS) of the diaphragmatic electromyogram (EMGdi), both provide vital information to select the proper IMT device and loads in COPD, therefore contributing to the curative effect of IMT. Pdi and RMS of EMGdi (RMSdi%) were measured and compared during inspiratory resistive <b>training</b> and threshold <b>load</b> <b>training</b> in stable patients with COPD. Patients and methods: Pdi and neural respiratory drive were measured continuously during inspiratory resistive <b>training</b> and threshold <b>load</b> <b>training</b> in 12 stable patients with COPD (forced expiratory volume in 1  s ± SD was 26. 1 %± 10. 2 % predicted). Results: Pdi was significantly higher during high-intensity threshold <b>load</b> <b>training</b> (91. 46 ± 17. 24  cmH 2 O) than during inspiratory resistive training (27. 24 ± 6. 13  cmH 2 O) in stable patients with COPD, with P< 0. 01 for each. Significant difference was also found in RMSdi% between high-intensity threshold <b>load</b> <b>training</b> and inspiratory resistive training (69. 98 %± 16. 78 % vs 17. 26 %± 14. 65 %, P< 0. 01). Conclusion: We concluded that threshold <b>load</b> <b>training</b> shows greater mobilization of Pdi and neural respiratory drive than inspiratory resistive training in stable patients with COPD.

From 39 Australian Football players, 6. 9 ± 4. 6 training sessions were analysed, resulting in 270 samples. Microtechnology devices provided external <b>training</b> <b>load</b> (distance, average speed, high-speed running distance, player load (PL) and player loadslow (PLslow)). The external <b>training</b> <b>load</b> measures had moderate to very large associations (r, 95 % CI) with s-RPE <b>training</b> <b>load,</b> average speed (0. 45, 0. 35 – 0. 54), high-speed running distance (0. 51, 0. 42 – 0. 59), PLslow (0. 80, 0. 75 – 0. 84), PL (0. 86, 0. 83 – 0. 89) and distance (0. 88, 0. 85 – 0. 90). Differences were described using effect sizes (d ± 95 % CL). When controlling for external <b>training</b> <b>load,</b> the 4 - to 5 -year players had higher s-RPE <b>training</b> <b>load</b> than the 0 - to 1 - (0. 44 ± 0. 33) and 2 - to 3 -year players (0. 51 ± 0. 30), ruckmen had moderately higher s-RPE <b>training</b> <b>load</b> than midfielders (0. 82 ± 0. 58), {{and there was a}} 0. 2 % increase in s-RPE <b>training</b> <b>load</b> per 1 s increase in time-trial (95 % CI: 0. 07 – 0. 34). Experience, position and time-trial performance impacted the {{relationship between}} external <b>training</b> <b>load</b> and s-RPE <b>training</b> <b>load.</b> This suggests that a given external <b>training</b> <b>load</b> may result in different internal responses between athletes, potentially leaving individuals at risk of overtraining or failing to elicit positive adaptation.

40|$|The present {{investigation}} described and compared {{the internal and}} external <b>training</b> <b>loads</b> during basketball <b>training.</b> Eight semi-professional male basketball players (mean ± SD, age: 26. 3 ± 6. 7 years; stature: 188. 1 ± 6. 2 cm; body mass: 92. 0 ± 13. 8 kg) were monitored across a seven-week period during the preparatory phase of the annual training plan. A total of 44 total sessions were monitored. Player session ratings of perceived exertion (sRPE), heart rate (HR), and accelerometer data were collected across each training session. Internal <b>training</b> <b>load</b> was determined using the session rating of perceived exertion (sRPE), training impulse (TRIMP), and summated-heart-rate-zones (SHRZ) <b>training</b> <b>load</b> models. External <b>training</b> <b>load</b> was calculated using an established accelerometer algorithm. Pearson product-moment correlations with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) were used to determine the relationships between internal and external <b>training</b> <b>load</b> models. Significant moderate relationships were observed between external <b>training</b> <b>load</b> and the sRPE (r 42 = 0. 49, 95 % CI = 0. 23 - 0. 69, P < 0. 001) and TRIMP models (r 42 = 0. 38, 95 % CI = 0. 09 - 0. 61, P = 0. 011). A significant large correlation was evident between external <b>training</b> <b>load</b> and the SHRZ model (r 42 = 0. 61, 95 % CI = 0. 38 - 0. 77, P < 0. 001). Although significant relationships were found between internal and external <b>training</b> <b>load</b> models, the magnitude of the correlations and low commonality suggest internal <b>training</b> <b>load</b> models measure different constructs of the training process than the accelerometer <b>training</b> <b>load</b> model in basketball settings.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} whether overreached athletes show psychomotor slowness after a period of high <b>load</b> <b>training.</b> Fourteen well-trained cyclists (10 male, 4 female, mean age 25. 3 [SD = 4. 1] years, mean maximal oxygen consumption 65. 5 [SD= 8. 1] ml/ kg-min) performed a maximal graded exercise test on a cycle ergometer, filled out two questionnaires and performed two tests of psychomotor speed before and after high <b>load</b> <b>training</b> and after two weeks of recovery training. A control group performed the two tests of psychomotor speed on the same occasions without changing physical activity levels. Five cyclists were classified as functional overreached, seven cyclists were classified as well-trained and two cyclists were excluded from analysis.
