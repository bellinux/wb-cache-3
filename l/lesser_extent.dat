5|$|The {{arterial}} partial {{pressures of}} oxygen {{and carbon dioxide}} in the arterial blood are homeostatically controlled. A rise in the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and, to a <b>lesser</b> <b>extent,</b> a fall in the arterial partial pressure of oxygen, will reflexly cause deeper and faster breathing till the blood gas tensions return to normal. The converse happens when the carbon dioxide tension falls, or, again to a <b>lesser</b> <b>extent,</b> the oxygen tension rises: the rate and depth of breathing are reduced till blood gas normality is restored.|$|E

50|$|Bahá'ís {{continue}} to be persecuted in Islamic countries, as Islamic leaders do not recognize the Bahá'í Faith as an independent religion, but rather as apostasy from Islam. The most severe persecutions have occurred in Iran, where over 200 Bahá'ís were executed between 1978 and 1998, and in Egypt. The rights of Bahá'ís have been restricted to greater or <b>lesser</b> <b>extents</b> in numerous other countries, including Afghanistan, Indonesia, Iraq, Morocco, and several countries in sub-Saharan Africa.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} high N-acetylcysteine (NAC) {{concentrations}} (10 and 50 mM) on antibiotic activity against 40 strains of respiratory pathogens was investigated. NAC compromised {{the activity of}} carbapenems (of mostly imipenem and, to <b>lesser</b> <b>extents,</b> meropenem and ertapenem) in a dose-dependent fashion. We demonstrated chemical instability of carbapenems {{in the presence of}} NAC. With other antibiotics, 10 mM NAC had no major effects, while 50 mM NAC sporadically decreased (ceftriaxone and aminoglycosides) or increased (penicillins) antibiotic activity...|$|R
50|$|The Australian rules {{football}} schism (1938-1949) was {{a period}} of division in the rules and governance of Australian rules football, primarily in the sport's traditional heartland of Melbourne, and to <b>lesser</b> <b>extents</b> in North West Tasmania and parts of regional Victoria. The schism existed primarily between Melbourne's pre-eminent league, the Victorian Football League (VFL), and its secondary league, the Victorian Football Association (VFA). In the context of VFA history, this period {{is often referred to as}} the throw-pass era.|$|R
5|$|Agent Orange {{was to a}} <b>lesser</b> <b>extent</b> used outside Vietnam. Land in {{neighbouring}} Laos and Cambodia {{was also}} sprayed with Agent Orange during the Vietnam War because forests {{on the border with}} Vietnam were used by the Vietcong.

A Fish and chip shop in Oakwood retains its art deco front from the 1930s.|$|E
50|$|Where {{there are}} {{historical}} immigrant Chinese populations, {{the style of}} food has evolved and been adapted to local tastes and ingredients, and modified by the local cuisine, to greater or <b>lesser</b> <b>extents.</b> This {{has resulted in a}} deep Chinese influence on other national cuisines such as Cambodian cuisine, Thai cuisine and Vietnamese cuisine.

50|$|In humans, mRNA for EP4 {{has been}} {{detected}} by Northern bloting {{in the heart}} and small intestine and to <b>lesser</b> <b>extents</b> in lung, kidney, thymus, uterus, dorsal root ganglions, and brain.

5000|$|... 2-Oxoglutarate {{receptor}} 1 (OXGR1), {{also known}} as cysteinyl leukotriene receptor E (CysLTE) and GPR99, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the [...] (also termed GPR99) gene. The Gene has recently been nominated as a receptor not only for 2-oxogluterate (see alpha-Ketoglutaric acid) {{but also for the}} three cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs), particularly leukotriene E4 (LTE4) and to far <b>lesser</b> <b>extents</b> LTC4 and LTE4. Recent studies implicate GPR99 as a cellular receptor which is activated by LTE4 thereby causing these cells to contribute to mediating various allergic and hypersensitivity responses.|$|R
