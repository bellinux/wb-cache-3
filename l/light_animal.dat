40|$|This study {{tests the}} {{hypotheses}} that the birefringent calcite and stereom {{structure of the}} brittlestar (Ophiuroidea, Echinodermata) endoskeleton polarizes light and that certain brittlestars respond to polarized light. The first hypothesis was tested in Ophioderma brevispinum by examining ossicles from freshly killed specimens under polarized light. This analysis revealed that the lateral arm shields, oral arm shields, arm spines and aboral disk ossicles are dichroic and thus polarize light. The second hypothesis was tested in two orientation experiments under polarized light. The results from the first orientation experiment showed (1) that, under polarized <b>light,</b> <b>animals</b> oriented significantly and unimodally, (2) that, under polarized light with the e-vector perpendicular to that in 1, animals oriented significantly and unimodally to within 18 ˚ of the bearing of the animals in 1, and (3) that, under unpolarized <b>light,</b> <b>animals</b> did not orient significantly. The results from the second orientation experiment showed that, under polarized <b>light,</b> <b>animals</b> oriented significantly and unimodally to within 17 ˚ of an individual preference previously established under polarized light; but under unpolarized <b>light,</b> <b>animals</b> did not orient significantly to an individual preference established under polarized light. Thus, O. brevispinum orients under polarized, but not unpolarized, light. The unimodal orientation and lack of consistent alignment with the e-vector suggest that polarized light is not used as a directional cue but instead as a signal to sustain oriented behavior. The dichroism of the ossicles of O. brevispinum and the animal’s capacity (though eyeless) to discriminate between polarized and unpolarized light suggest that the mechanism of polarization sensitivity may rely on polarizing filters built from the animal’s skeleton...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{ability to}} detect {{changing}} visual information is a vital component of safe driving. In addition to detecting changing visual information, drivers must also interpret its relevance to safety. Environmental changes considered to have high safety relevance will likely demand greater attention and more timely responses than those considered to have lower safety relevance. The aim {{of the present study}} was to explore factors that are likely to influence perceptions of risk and safety regarding changing visual information in the driving environment. Factors explored were the environment in which the change occurs (i. e., urban versus rural), the type of object that changes, and the driver's age, experience and risk sensitivity. Methods: 63 licensed drivers aged 18 – 70 years completed a hazard rating task, which required them to rate the perceived hazardousness of changing specific elements within urban and rural driving environments. Three attributes of potential hazards were systematically manipulated: the environment (urban, rural); the type of object changed (road sign, car, motorcycle, pedestrian, traffic <b>light,</b> <b>animal,</b> tree); and its inherent safety risk (low-risk, high-risk). Inherent safety risk was manipulated by either varying the object's placement, on/near or away from the road, or altering an infrastructure element which would require a change to driver behaviour. Participants also completed two driving-related risk perception tasks, rating their relative crash risk and perceived risk of aberrant driving behaviours. Results: Driver age was not significantly associated with hazard ratings, but individual differences in perceived risk of aberrant driving behaviours predicted hazard ratings, suggesting that general driving-related risk sensitivity plays a strong role in safety perception. In both urban and rural scenes there were significant associations between hazard ratings and inherent safety risk, with low-risk changes perceived as consistently less hazardous than high-risk impact changes; however, the effect was larger for urban environments. There were also effects of object type, with certain objects rated as consistently more safety relevant. In urban scenes, changes involving pedestrians were rated significantly more hazardous than all other objects, and in rural scenes, changes involving animals were rated as significantly more hazardous. Notably, hazard ratings were found to be higher in urban compared with rural driving environments, even when changes were matched between environments. Conclusion: The present study demonstrates that drivers perceive rural roads as less risky than urban roads, even when similar scenarios occur in both environments. Age did not affect hazard ratings. Instead, the findings suggest that the assessment of risk posed by hazards is influenced more by individual differences in risk sensitivity.

40|$|Autumnal {{body mass}} {{reduction}} in a seasonally snow-covered environment is reported for Antechinus swainsonii (Marsupialia: Dasyuridae), thus extending the phylogenetic spectrum {{in which this}} phenomenon is known. Above 1600 m altitude the average mass of individual A. swainsonii falls from 48. 6 g to 42. 6 g (a 12. 3 % loss) from April to May. The difference in mass results from a reduction in lean mass rather than a metabolisation of fat reserves. In A. swainsonii, the need to increase body mass in late summer only to lose it in autumn prior to a winter beneath the snow seems superfluous. However, the higher mass {{may be necessary to}} survive the harsher microclimate in autumn before conditions ameliorate beneath the snow cover. Survival from April to May is higher in heavier animals (that do lose mass in autumn) than <b>lighter</b> <b>animals</b> (with mass in April equal to that of animals after loss of body mass).

40|$|The study {{compared}} behaviour {{and clinical}} parameters of beef cattle housed {{on two different}} types of floor (fully slatted vs. deep litter) considering animals belonging to 2 live weight classes (less vs. more than 350 kg).

Floor type had no effect on cattle behaviour except {{for the duration of the}} lying down sequence, which lasted more for bulls kept on slats. Slatted floor increased also the likelihood of occurrence of hair and skin lesions and lameness. On the other hand, bulls cleanliness was more likely to be impaired on bedded floor. Regarding the class of live weight, behavioural observation showed <b>lighter</b> <b>animals</b> performing more antagonistic interactions, while horning resulted more frequent in heavier bulls.

About health status, <b>light</b> <b>animals</b> were more affected by respiratory disease and hairless patches, likely because they are more sensitive to the stressful situations imposed by their transfer and adaptation to the new housing environment of the fattening unit.

O peso de abate determinado para ambos os grupos foi de 500 kg. Os animais foram alimentados com silagem de milho e concentrado (relação 60 : 40). Os pesos iniciais aumentaram o tempo de confinamento, uma vez que os animais leves permaneceram no confinamento 94 dias e os pesados, 30 dias. Os animais leves tiveram portes iniciais e finais menores e apresentaram carcaças com maior espessura de gordura. O costilhar foi o único corte comercial influenciado pelo peso inicial. Animais mais pesados ao início do confinamento apresentaram maior porcentagem de traseiro e menor de costilhar. A quantidade de músculo foi maior nos animais mais pesados. O menor peso inicial resultou em animais de menor porte e com menor altura de garupa, maior espessura de gordura na carcaça e no costilhar e menor quantidade de traseiro e músculo.

30|$|In drawing {{conclusions}} it {{is important}} to note that the three <b>lightest</b> <b>animals</b> were female, and the three heaviest male. It may be that some of the differences observed are gender related, and the bodyweight effects are driven extrinsically through those gender differences. Given the size of this study these effects cannot be drawn out here, but may warrant further investigation. Also one of the female dogs was only 10  months old and was likely not mature at the time of the MRI evaluation. Another drawback is the fact that cartilage thickness was not directly measured but approximated by assuming everything is a sphere and calculating the radii based on surface area and volume calculations.|$|R
