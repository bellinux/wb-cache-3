It is pointed out that a multichannel approach is necessary with the heterodyne instrument for improved retrieval accuracy.

These pressure-broadening studies have provided the kind of improvements needed in the database for retrieving atmospheric profiles from far infrared <b>limb</b> <b>sensing</b> data. Authors summarized the laboratory spectroscopic studies conducted during the grant period. We attempted to measure the pressure broadening coefficients of the O 2 lines in the 50 and 117 / cm regions. An accurate characterization of these lines using the IBEX detector system was needed to analyze the flight data. These are difficult lines to measure because they arise from weak magnetic dipole transitions. We used a 4 -meter absorption cell to obtain the pressure broadening coefficients for the 50 and 83 /cm lines. We also completed the pressure broadening studies including the temperature dependence of two lines of OH at 83 and 118 /cm. These two lines are important not only for the balloon data retrieval work but also for the future project proposals. Another area of focus in our program is the far infrared detector research.

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to develop and {{evaluate}} reliability of a quantitative assessment tool for upper <b>limb</b> <b>sense</b> of position on the horizontal plane. We evaluated 15 healthy individuals (controls) and 9 stroke patients. A robotic device passively moved one arm of the blindfolded participant who had to actively move his/her opposite hand to the mirror location in the workspace. Upper-limb's position was evaluated by a digital camera. The position of the passive hand was compared with the active hand's ‘mirror’ position. Performance metrics were then computed to measure the mean absolute errors, error variability, spatial contraction/expansion, and systematic shifts. No significant differences were observed between dominant and non-dominant active arms of controls. All performance parameters of the post-stroke group differed significantly from those of controls. This tool can provide a quantitative measure of upper <b>limb</b> <b>sense</b> of position, therefore allowing detection of changes due to rehabilitation...|$|R

40|$|Background. Impairment of {{position}} {{sense of the}} upper extremity (UE) may impede {{activities of daily living}} and limit motor gains after stroke. Most clinical assessments {{of position}} sense rely on categorical or ordinal ratings by clinicians that lack sensitivity to change or the ability to discriminate subtle deficits. Objective. Use robotic technology to develop a reliable, quantitative technique with a continuous scale to assess UE position sense following stroke. Methods. Forty-five patients recruited from an inpatient stroke rehabilitation service and 65 age-matched healthy controls performed an arm position matching task. Each UE was fitted in the exoskeleton of a KINARM device. One UE was passively placed in one of 9 positions, and the subject was told to match his or her position with the other UE. Patients were compared with statistical distributions of control data to identify those with deficits in UE position sense. Test–retest sessions using 2 raters established interrater reliability. Results. Two thirds of left hemiparetic and one third of right hemiparetic patients had deficits in <b>limb</b> position <b>sense.</b> Left-affected stroke subjects demonstrated significantly more trial-to-trial variability than right-affected or control subjects. The robotic assessment technique demonstrated good interrater reliability but limited agreement with the clinical thumb localizing test. Conclusions.

This research aimed to make a descriptive analysis of physical and functional sequels deriving to traffic accidents of victms attended by the Medico Legal Institute Estácio de Lima, Maceió/AL, Brazil in 2006. It consists of a cross and retrospective epidemiological study. Three hundred and seventy-seven reports of body injury were analyzed, covering the period January to December 2006. Of those reports, 48. 8 % of the victims presented sequels. The victims investigated were characterized by being, in the majority, youths and young adults (56. 8 %), males (76. 9 %). The highest number of accidents was the automobile (77. 7 %). Most of the accidents had serious injuries (35 %), of which 53 % of these {{had some kind of}} sequel.

40|$|Background: Parkinson’s {{disease is}} {{accompanied}} by deficits in passive motion and <b>limb</b> position <b>sense.</b> Objective: To investigate whether deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) reverses these proprio-ceptive deficits. Methods and results: A passive movement task was applied to nine patients with Parkinson’s disease and bilateral chronic STN-DBS and to seven controls. Thresholds for 75 % correct responses were 0. 9 ˚ for controls, 2. 5 ˚ for Parkinson’s disease patients when stimulation was OFF, and 2. 0 ˚ when stimulation was ON. Conclusions: STN-DBS improves kinaesthesic deficits in Parkinson’s disease, but {{does not lead to}} a full recovery of proprioceptive function. K inaesthesia is the conscious perception of limb and body position, orientation, and motion. Recent studies have shown that patients with Parkinson’s disease have higher thresholds for detecting passive elbow movements, reflecting kinaesthesic deficits. 1 2 Patients with Parkinson’s disease show altered proprioception related EEG potentials during passive movements, which probably reflect changes in the cortical processing of kinaesthesic signals. 3 Dopaminergic drugs appear to enhance this deficit. 4 In contrast, we found no effect of levodopa on kinaesthesia. 2 Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) improves motor deficits in Parkinson’s disease 5 but it may worsen cognitive functions such as working memory. 6 However, the effects of STN-DBS on kinaesthesia are unknown.
