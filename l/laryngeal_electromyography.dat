40|$|On {{the basis}} of our {{previous}} finding that the cervical esophagus was closed during tracheoesophageal phonation, we postulated that the muscle of the cervical esophagus actually contracted during expiration and speculated on its possible regulation by the recurrent <b>laryngeal</b> nerve. <b>Electromyography</b> of the esophageal musculature and fluoroscopy of the esophagus were performed in laryngectomees to demonstrate whether the esophagus contracted during expiration or not. Electromyography, performed in 2 sub-jects, revealed a burst of discharges synchronous with expiration. Fluoroscopy during tracheoesophageal phonation was performed in 13 subjects to investigate the influence of resection of the esophageal branch of the recurrent nerve on esophageal motor activity. Among 13 subjects, 4 subjects who underwent paratracheal dissection (PTD) at the time of laryngectomy showed a lower superior limit of esophageal closure than did the 9 subjects without PTD, indicating that the cervical esophagus in PTD loses its contractility with the sacrifice of the esophageal branch of the recurrent nerve. We concluded that the cervical esophagus is closed by muscle contraction synchronous with expiration, preventing air entry into the stomach during deep expiration or phonation, and that the esophageal branch of the recurrent nerve is involved.

40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether the videostroboscopic finding of vibratory asymmetry in mobile vocal folds is a reliable predictor of vocal fold paresis. In addition, the ability of experienced reviewers to predict the distribution (left/dght/bilateral) of the paresis was investigated. Methods: This is a retrospective chart review of all patients who presented to our clinic during a 3 -year period with symptoms suggestive of glottal insufficiency (vocal fatigue or reduced vocal projection) accompanied by the videostro-boscopie findings of bilateral normal vocal fold mobility and vibratory asymmetry. Twenty-three of these patients under-went diagnostic <b>laryngeal</b> <b>electromyography</b> of the thyroarytenoid and crieothyroid muscles to determine the presence of vocal fold paresis. Results: Nineteen of the 23 patients (82. 6 %) were found to have electrophysiological evidence of vocal fold paresis, either unilaterally or bilaterally, when videostroboscopic asymmetry was present in mobile vocal folds. However, the three expert reviewers ' ability to predict the distribution (left/right/bilateral) of the paresis was poor (26. 3 %, 36. 8 %, and 36. 8 %, respectively).

40|$|Background: Vagal nerve {{stimulation}} (VNS) has been recommended as a routine procedure during intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN). However, many surgeons have been discouraged from performing VNS {{because of the}} need for opening the carotid sheath. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the feasibility and reliability of VNS without carotid sheath dissection. Methods: Two hundred twenty patients with 376 nerves at risk were enrolled in this study. VNS without nerve exposure during IONM was applied by simply pressing a ball-tip stimulator on the space between the carotid artery and jugular vein. Results: VNS without nerve exposure was feasible in all cases and did not result in any morbidity. All VNS signals were successfully obtained within 30 minutes of the start of the operation and all showed a clear and reliable <b>laryngeal</b> <b>electromyography</b> (EMG) response that was similar to that from the conventional method in which nerve exposure for VNS is applied.

40|$|The {{clinical}} diagnosis of superior laryngeal nerve paralysis (SLNp) is infrequently made, {{because of the}} heterogeneity of clinical presentations and laryngoscopic findings. <b>Laryngeal</b> <b>electromyography</b> (LEMG) can provide the definitive diag-nosis of this abnormality. With increasing use of LEMG in clinical practice, this condition is now more frequently appre-ciated by otolaryngologists. A characteristic, but infrequently reported, videostroboscopic vocal fold motion termed Ge-genschlagen (“dashing-against-each-other”) has previously been described to occur in unilateral SLNp. We encountered such motion in a clinical case, which we subsequently verified as unilateral SLNp by means of LEMG. This characteristic glottic motion was then verified in an in vivo canine model of phonation after unilateral SLNp. Videostrobokymography was performed to generate kymograms that illustrated this vocal fold motion clearly. Kymograms of both human and ca-nine subjects with SLNp demonstrated an undulating motion of the horizontally shifting glottic space as the medial edges of the vocal folds chased each other 90 ° out of phase. As one vocal fold mucosal edge was opening, the other was clos-ing, and this repeated motion appeared as vocal folds chasing or dashing against each other.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the long-term efficacy of delayed laryngeal reinnervation using the main {{branch of the}} ansa cervicalis in treatment of unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP) caused by thyroid surgery. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: UVFP remains a serious complication of thyroid surgery. Up to now, a completely satisfactory surgical treatment of UVFP has been elusive. METHODS: From Jan. 1996 to Jan. 2008, a total of 237 UVFP patients who underwent ansa cervicalis main branch-to-recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) anastomosis were enrolled as UVFP group; another 237 age- and gender-matched normal subjects served as control group. Videostroboscopy, vocal function assessment (acoustic analysis, perceptual evaluation and maximum phonation time), and electromyography were performed preoperatively and postoperatively. The mean follow-up period was 5. 2 ± 2. 7 years, ranging from 2 to 12 years. RESULTS: Analysis of videostroboscopic findings indicated that the glottic closure, vocal fold edge, vocal fold position, phase symmetry and regularity were significantly improved in the UVFP group (P 0. 05, respectively). Postoperative <b>laryngeal</b> <b>electromyography</b> confirmed successful reinnervation of laryngeal muscle. CONCLUSIONS: Delayed laryngeal reinnervation with the main branch of ansa cervicalis is a feasible and effective approach for treatment of thyroid surgery-related UVFP; it can restore the physiological laryngeal phonatory function to the normal or a nearly normal voice quality...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The most {{important}} {{function of the}} larynx is airway protection which is provided through a polysynaptic reflex closure triggered by the receptors in the glottic and supraglottic mucosa, evoking the reflex contraction of the laryngeal muscles especially by strong adduction of vocal cords. Based on the hypotheses that central facilitation is essential for this bilateral adductor reflex and that its disturbance can result in weakened laryngeal closure, we designed this study to elucidate the effect of central facilitation on this protective reflex. Materials and Methods: Seven adult, 20 kg mongrel dogs underwent evoked response <b>laryngeal</b> <b>electromyography</b> under 0. 5 to 1. 0 MAC (minimum alveolar concentration) isoflurane anesthesia. The internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve was stimulated through bipolar platinum-iridium electrodes, and recording electrodes were positioned in the ipsilateral and contralateral thyroarytenoid muscles. Results: Ipsilateral reflex closure was consistantly recorded regardless of anesthetic levels. However, contralateral reflex responses disappeared as anesthetic levels were deepened. Additionally, late responses (R 2) were detected in one animal at lower level of anesthesia. Conclusions: Deepened level of anesthesia affects central facilitation and results {{in the loss of}} the crossed adductor reflex, predisposing to a weakened glottic closure response. Precise understanding of this effect may possibly provide a way to prevent aspiration in unconscious patients...|$|E
40|$|We present 2 {{case reports}} to {{demonstrate}} the relationship between laryngeal muscle activity and respiration in children with bilateral vocal fold paralysis (BVFP) by simultaneous <b>laryngeal</b> <b>electromyography</b> (EMG) with recording of chest wall movement and intercostal muscle EMG. Laryngeal EMG was performed together with recording of chest wall movement in a 55 -day-old girl who was undergoing tracheostomy for idiopathic congenital BVFP. Normal phasic activity was observed, ie, the thyroarytenoid (TA) muscle was active during expiration and the posterior cricoarytenoid (PCA) muscle during inspiration, suggesting a good prognosis for recovery. The child was decannulated at 11 months. Laryngeal EMG together with recording of chest wall movement and intercostal EMG in a 5 year-old girl who was tracheostomy-dependent following tracheoesophageal fistula repair due to BVFP showed phasic activity during expiration for both the TA and PCA muscles, indicating aberrant regeneration of the PCA motor nerve. The timing of laryngeal muscle activity with respiration {{in the assessment of}} pediatric congenital BVFP is essential {{to demonstrate the}} presence of normal or abnormal medullary respiratory neuronal input to laryngeal motoneurons. In cases in which BVFP is due to recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, respiration-related laryngeal EMG will identify aberrant regeneration.

40|$|Purpose of review: Voice tremor is {{strongly}} {{linked to the}} Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease speech-voice symptom complex. Little {{is known about the}} underlying anatomic source(s) of voice tremor when it occurs. We review recent literature addressing this issue. Additionally we report findings from a study we conducted employing rating of vocal tract structures viewed using nasolaryngoscopy during vocal and nonspeech tasks. Recent findings: In Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease, using <b>laryngeal</b> <b>electromyography,</b> tremor has not been identified in muscles in the vocal folds even when perceived auditorily. Preliminary findings using nasolaryngoscopy suggest that Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease voice tremor is not associated with the vocal folds and may involve the palate, the global larynx, and the arytenoids. Tremor in the vertical larynx on /a/, and tremor in the arytenoid cartilages on /s/ differentiated patients with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease from neurologically healthy controls. Visual reliable detection of tremor when it is absent or borderline present, is challenging. Summary: Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease voice tremor is likely to be related to oscillatory movement in structures across the vocal tract rather than just the vocal folds. To progress clinical practice, more refined tools for the visual rating of tremor would be beneficial. How far voice tremor represents a functionally significant factor for speakers would also add to the literature...|$|E

Material/Methods: This 15 -year retrospective study recruited 12 patients with suspected arytenoid dislocation from external blunt laryngeal trauma, who were evaluated through 7 approaches: detailed personal history, voice handicap index (VHI) test, indirect laryngoscope, flexible fiberoptic laryngoscope, video strobolaryngoscope, and/or high-reso-lution computed tomography (CT), and, most importantly, the outcomes after attempted closed reduction un-der local anesthesia. They were divided into satisfied group (n= 9) and dissatisfied group (n= 3) based on their satisfied with voice qualities at 1 week after the last closed reduction manipulation. Results: Each patient was diagnosed with arytenoid dislocation caused by external blunt laryngeal trauma.

40|$|Injury to the {{recurrent}} laryngeal nerve {{is accompanied}} by a poor functional recovery of the target organ, the larynx. For the patient this means impairments of vocal fold mobility and various kinds of voice disorders. In this thesis, an experimental model in the rat is used to identify the most important pathological factors involved after recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. The results demonstrate that the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle, the only abductor of the vocal fold, recieves dual innervation from both the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the superior laryngeal nerve, a view that is against the classical understanding of laryngeal neuroanatomy. When the recurrent laryngeal nerve is injured, this anatomical relation then serves as a base for collateral reinnervation by competing, intact nerve fibers in the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle. Collateral reinnervation is proposed to be a negative factor for the functional outcome, more important than neuronal death, which was found to be low after recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. Pharmacological treatment with the calcium flow inhibitor nimodipine was shown to improve reinnervation by original recurrent laryngeal nerve fibers in rats. Early clinical data is also presented that indicate a beneficial effect from nimodipine treatment after acute recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, in terms of recovery of vocal fold mobility. <b>Laryngeal</b> <b>electromyography</b> was shown to be a valuable diagnostic and prognostic tool in detecting axonal injury in these patients, which may form an indication for nimodipine treatment...|$|E
40|$|Recurrent {{laryngeal}} nerve (RLN) injury {{may induce}} unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP).

The present study investigates SLN injury influence on glottal configuration and function in patients with UVFP after thyroidectomy. Prospective controlled study. Tertiary medical center. The SLN and RLN function of 34 patients with UVFP after thyroidectomy was determined by <b>laryngeal</b> <b>electromyography.</b> The subjects were dichotomized into the isolated RLN injury group (n = 26) or the concurrent SLN/RLN injury group (n = 8).

The glottal function measurements included voice acoustic and aerodynamic analyses and the Voice Handicap Index. The aforementioned parameters of the RLN and concurrent SLN/RLN injury groups were compared. There were no statistical differences in glottal configuration such as glottal angle, paralyzed vocal fold shape, normalized glottal gap area, and glottal shape between the RLN and concurrent SLN/RLN injury groups. There were also no significant differences in other glottal function analyses including fundamental frequency, mean airflow rate, phonation quotient, maximal phonation time, and Voice Handicap Index.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Voice and {{swallowing}} symptoms following thyroidectomy in {{the absence}} of any demonstration of laryngeal nerves injury are usually considered a functional outcome of uncomplicated operations, mainly related to scar formation and emotional reaction. They could be related to unapparent laryngeal nerve or cricothyroid (CT) muscle injuries detectable only by <b>laryngeal</b> <b>electromyography</b> (LEMG). We correlated such symptoms with LEMG patterns. METHODS: A total of 33 consenting patients undergoing total thyroidectomy (TT) were enrolled. Video-strobolaryngoscopy (VSL), acoustic voice analysis (AVA), and maximum phonation time (MPT) were performed preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively. Subjective evaluation of voice (Voice Impairment Score, or VIS) and swallowing (Swallowing Impairment Score, or SIS) were obtained preoperatively and 1 and 3 months postoperatively. At 1 month postoperatively LEMG was performed examining thyroarytenoid (TA) and CT muscles to evaluate the inferior laryngeal nerve (ILN) and the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve (EBSLN), respectively. RESULTS: One patient experienced transient vocal cord palsy and was excluded. The remaining 32 patients completed the postoperative evaluation. No significant difference was found between preoperative and postoperative AVA and MPT parameters. Mean VIS was significantly worse than preoperatively 1 and 3 months after TT. No significant difference was found between preoperative and postoperative SIS. LEMG evaluation of TA muscle showed decreased voluntary activity and spontaneous fibrillation potentials in one patient. LEMG of the CT muscle did not reveal any sign of EBSLN injury.

Interventions: In the office-based procedure, 1. 0 mL of hyaluronic acid was injected via a 26 -gauge monopolar injectable needle electrode into paralyzed thyroarytenoid muscles by LEMG guidance. Main Outcomes and Measures: Various glottal closure evaluations such as normalized glottal gap area, maximal phonation time, phonation quotient, mean airflow rate, perceptual GRBAS (grade, roughness, breathiness, asthenia, strain) scale, and Voice Handicap Index were compared before and after injection using the nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank test within 1 month, at 6 months, and at the last follow-up examination. Results: Sixty patients had been followed up for at least 6 months. Forty-four patients received only 1 injection, and 16 patients received repeated injections (2 injections for 13 patients and 3 for 3 patients). All the glottal closure parameters improved significantly (P[*]<[*]. 001) within 1 month, at 6 months, and at the last follow-up examination, with a mean (SD) of 17. 4 (8. 9) months. At the last follow-up examination, the mean (SD) normalized glottal gap area was significantly reduced from 7. 9 (5. 7) to 0. 6 (1. 6). Mean (SD) maximal phonation time was significantly prolonged from 4. 6 (3. 8) seconds to 12. 1 (7. 4) seconds. Mean (SD) phonation quotient was significantly reduced from 647 (508) mL/s to 277 (212) mL/s. Mean (SD) airflow rate was significantly reduced from 445 (338) mL/s to 175 (145) mL/s. When all the GRBAS scale parameters improved, the mean (SD) Voice Handicap Index score was significantly reduced from 76 (22) to 38 (30) (all P[*]<[*]. 001). Conclusions and Relevance: Of the 74 patients in this study, 44 (60...|$|E
