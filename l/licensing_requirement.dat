2500|$|Barr {{supported}} the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2014 (H.R. 4005; 113th Congress), {{a bill that}} would amend laws that govern the activities of the United States Coast Guard (USCG), the Maritime Administration (MARAD) within the Department of Transportation, and the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC). Barr testified in favor of the bill because it would [...] "remove the requirement that Valley View Ferry captains be licensed through the Coast Guard, and instead allow the state to implement its own licensing requirement." [...] At present, the local ferry has had to cut back on hours because the ferry has been unable to find a new captain for ferry due to the stringent Coast Guard requirements to get a merchant mariner license, {{despite the fact that the}} ferry only travels 500 feet on steel cables, without any steering capabilities. If the bill were to pass, the state government would be able to lower the <b>licensing</b> <b>requirement</b> for such a small ferry with only limited capabilities.|$|E

2500|$|... "But the {{inherent}} vagueness of the English language," [...] Sprecher concluded {{after reviewing the}} text of the ordinance and Grayned and the other relevant precedents, [...] "coupled with the admirable intention of stemming drug abuse, cannot save an ordinance which fails to give fair notice of what it prohibits." [...] He subjected the text to a closer reading than the district court had. Yes, he agreed with Leighton, the five words had clear meanings. [...] "But the fact that [...] does not sufficiently clarify the scope of the <b>licensing</b> <b>requirement,</b> which applies to any person who sells [...]" [...] He found the phrase after those words, [...] "which is designed or marketed for use with illegal cannabis or drugs" [...] to be most determinative of how the ordinance would be interpreted and enforced. [...] "Unless the license guidelines give additional clarity to this phrase, we must agree with plaintiff that the ordinance is so vague that it does not give sufficient notice to merchants as to whether they are required to obtain a license, and for which items the name and address of the purchaser must be recorded and sale to minors prohibited." ...|$|E
2500|$|... (3) The handgun ban and the trigger-lock {{requirement}} (as {{applied to}} self-defense) violate the Second Amendment. The District’s total ban on handgun possession {{in the home}} amounts to a prohibition on an entire class of “arms” that Americans overwhelmingly choose for the lawful purpose of self-defense. Under any of the standards of scrutiny the Court has applied to enumerated constitutional rights, this prohibition – {{in the place where}} the importance of the lawful defense of self, family, and property is most acute – would fail constitutional muster. Similarly, the requirement that any lawful firearm in the home be disassembled or bound by a trigger lock makes it impossible for citizens to use arms for the core lawful purpose of self-defense and is hence unconstitutional. Because Heller conceded at oral argument that the D. C. licensing law is permissible if it is not enforced arbitrarily and capriciously, the Court assumes that a license will satisfy his prayer for relief and does not address the <b>licensing</b> <b>requirement.</b> Assuming he is not disqualified from exercising Second Amendment rights, the District must permit Heller to register his handgun and must issue him a license to carry it in the home.

2500|$|The Agency Workers Regulations 2010 provide workers some {{protection}} against less favourable treatment when they work through an employment agency. However, {{the right to}} equal treatment is limited to [...] "basic working conditions", which is defined as pay and their working time, unless the common law, or general EU law principles are applicable. But an agency worker may, unlike part-time or fixed-term employees, appeal to a hypothetical comparator. This left uncertain the position of agency workers protection by the job security, child care and other rights for employees in ERA 1996. While the dominant view, after the UK Supreme Court decision in Autoclenz Ltd v Belcher, is that an agency worker will always qualify as an employee against both the agency and end-user when they work for a wage, the English Court of Appeal had previously issued conflicting judgments on whether an agency worker should have an unfair dismissal claim against the end-employer, the agency, or both or neither. Reflecting their vulnerable position, the regulation of agency work goes beyond anti-discrimination rights, to place a set of duties on employment agents' operations and conduct. Found in the Employment Agencies Act 1973 and the Conduct of Employment Agencies and Employment Businesses Regulations 2003 agencies are generally prohibited from charging fees to prospective workers. Various other duties include being honest in their job advertising, keeping all information on jobseekers confidential and complying with all employment laws. Originally agencies had to have licenses, and under the oversight of the Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate, they risked losing their licenses if found to be acting {{in violation of the}} law. The Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994 removed the <b>licensing</b> <b>requirement,</b> but this was partially reinstated for agencies in agricultural, shellfish and packing sectors through the Gangmasters (Licensing) Act 2004. In response to the 2004 Morecambe Bay cockling disaster this established another specific regulator, the Gangmasters Licensing Authority, to enforce employment law in those areas.|$|E
