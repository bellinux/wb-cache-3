During the ITB, the <b>light</b> <b>impurity</b> gradient steepens because the impurity pinch increases relative to diffusion.

Neoclassical transport does not describe the <b>light</b> <b>impurity</b> profiles but transport is closer to neoclassical in the ITB region.

The expression for ZF growth rate with impurities is derived by balancing the ZF potential shielded by polarization effects and the ZF modulated radial turbulent current. Then, it is shown that the maximum normalized ZF growth rate is reduced {{by the presence of}} the fully ionized non-trace <b>light</b> <b>impurities</b> with relatively flat density profile, and slightly reduced by highly ionized trace tungsten (W). While, the maximum normalized ZF growth rate can be also enhanced by fully ionized non-trace <b>light</b> <b>impurities</b> with relatively steep density profile.

Using the Charge Exchange diagnostic system at JET, ion temperatures, rotation velocities and densities have been derived from visible spectroscopic measurements on fully ionised <b>light</b> <b>impurities</b> such as He, C, N and Ne. The existence of plume contribution from beam produced hydrogen-like ions has been proven beyond any doubt to affect the deduction of the active charge exchange signal of He II. In the case of C VI, the plume signal {{was estimated to be}} at least a factor of five lower than the active charge exchange signal. Line integrated passive charge exchange emission between neutral background atoms and fully ionised impurities has been investigated and modelled. When the synthetic spectrum is fitted to the experimentally detected spectra the neutral background density can be deduced.

Working in the regime when the thermodynamic limit is taken prior to the small force limit, {{we have found that}} the Bloch oscillations of the impurity velocity are absent {{in the case of a}} <b>light</b> <b>impurity.</b> Further, we have argued that for a <b>light</b> <b>impurity</b> the steady state drift velocity, V_D, remains finite in the limit Fâ†’ 0.

In the preceding Comment [Phys. Rev.

They have suggested that the ground state of the impurity-fluid system is a quasi-bound state and that this is sufficient to ensure adiabaticity in the thermodynamic limit. Their analytical argument is based on a certain truncation of the Hilbert space of the system.
