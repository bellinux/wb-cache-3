50|$|A {{resistive}} <b>load</b> <b>bank,</b> {{the most}} common type, provides equivalent loading for both generators and prime movers. That is, for each kilowatt (or horsepower) of load applied to the generator by the <b>load</b> <b>bank,</b> {{an equal amount of}} load is applied to the prime mover by the generator. A resistive <b>load</b> <b>bank,</b> therefore, removes energy from the complete system: <b>load</b> <b>bank</b> from generator—generator from prime mover—prime mover from fuel. Additional energy is removed as a consequence of resistive <b>load</b> <b>bank</b> operation: waste heat from coolant, exhaust and generator losses and energy consumed by accessory devices. A resistive <b>load</b> <b>bank</b> impacts upon all aspects of a generating system.|$|E
50|$|The load of a {{resistive}} <b>load</b> <b>bank</b> {{is created}} by the conversion of electrical energy to heat via high-power resistors such as grid resistors. This heat must be dissipated from the <b>load</b> <b>bank,</b> either by air or by water, by forced means or convection.|$|E
50|$|A <b>load</b> <b>bank</b> is {{a device}} which {{develops}} an electrical load, applies the load to an electrical power source and converts or dissipates the resultant power {{output of the}} source.Consequently, a <b>load</b> <b>bank</b> can be further defined as a self-contained, unitized, systematic device that includes load elements with control and accessory devices required for operation.|$|E
50|$|The {{junctions}} on {{the line}} that were not even proper towns but just farming areas (these places are Ryan and Munyabla) only consisted of a minor station and a <b>loading</b> <b>bank.</b> Though in Urangeline and Ferndale there was a stock race included. At Rand there was a station, water stand where the steam trains filled up with water, a coal stage where the trains filled up with coal, a <b>loading</b> <b>bank</b> and a station. At Pleasant Hills there was a station, a water stand, a <b>loading</b> <b>bank</b> and a stock race. In 1933 two silos were added. <b>Loading</b> <b>banks</b> were used for loading and unloading mail, cargo etc.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} of a <b>loading</b> <b>bank</b> was requested in 1930 when local farmers complained that their previous requests for improved loading facilities had been ignored and that the requirement for them to drive their stock to the nearest such facilities at Carterton was unreasonable. A local racing enthusiast {{also pointed out that}} a <b>loading</b> <b>bank</b> at Dalefield would be most useful to him in his business of training race horses. A <b>loading</b> <b>bank</b> the length of a single wagon was thought sufficient to meet requirements. Approval for the {{construction of}} the <b>loading</b> <b>bank</b> was given on 28 April 1930 and it was noted that completion was required in time for the upcoming Winter Show in Wellington and the Carterton Show. The <b>loading</b> <b>bank</b> was built with a timber front, ramped at both ends to a grade of 1 in 5, to a height of 2 ft and 20 ft long, and was completed on 29 May 1930.|$|R

50|$|A {{capacitive}} <b>load</b> <b>bank</b> or {{capacitor bank}} {{is similar to}} an inductive <b>load</b> <b>bank</b> in rating and purpose, except leading power factor loads are created, so reactive power is supplied from these loads to the system, hence improves the power factor. These loads simulate certain electronic or non-linear loads typical of telecommunications, computer or UPS industries.|$|E
5000|$|... 84003 and 84009 {{passed to}} the Research Division: 84009 was rebuilt as a <b>load</b> <b>bank</b> tester and 84003 was used for spares. They were given {{departmental}} numbers ADB968021 and ADB968022 respectively, although the latter was never applied. In 1995 84009 was broken-up following withdrawal from its <b>load</b> <b>bank</b> duties; one cab of this locomotive was saved together with a quantity of spares.|$|E
50|$|The fully salt-water <b>load</b> <b>bank</b> {{dates from}} an earlier, less {{regulated}} and litigious era. To pass current safety legislation requires more enclosed designs.|$|E

40|$|A cane {{harvesting}} system which eliminates {{the use of}} chain slings has been developed on Illovo's mill-cum-planter estate. A semi-mechanised "split {{harvesting system}} " has been adopted. Conventional type trailers are used for infield haulage which off-load loose cane into windrows on the <b>loading</b> <b>banks.</b> Grabloaders then transload the cane from the windrow into "Hilo " cane lorries for transportation to the Tllovo mill. Reductions in staff on the <b>loading</b> <b>banks</b> have been achieved and the running costs of the grabloaders {{are found to be}} {{similar to those of the}} conventinonal Mobamech cranes which are operated by Illovo on the growers <b>loading</b> <b>banks...</b>|$|R
50|$|An urgent {{request was}} made on 21 November 1962 for the {{construction}} of a high-level <b>loading</b> <b>bank</b> that was required for the loading of a large consignment of specially graded river metal. It was built on top of part of the existing low-level <b>loading</b> <b>bank</b> (constructed in 1898) and completed on 29 November 1962.|$|R

50|$|Whereas the “real” load {{is served}} by the power source and uses the energy {{output of the source}} for some {{productive}} purpose, the <b>load</b> <b>bank</b> serves the power source, using its energy output to test, support or protect the power source.|$|E
50|$|For emergency-only {{generator}} sets, {{it may be}} impractical to use the supported load for testing. A temporary {{or permanent}} <b>load</b> <b>bank</b> can be used testing. Sometimes the switchgear can be designed to allow the set to feed power into the grid for load testing.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} dummy loads for power supplies, known as load banks. These {{may be used}}, for example, for factory and {{in-service}} testing of standby generators. A <b>load</b> <b>bank</b> {{may be used to}} stabilize a power system in case of loss of load, for example, on an isolated wind or mini-hydro plant.|$|E

50|$|An {{inductive}} load {{consists of an}} iron-core reactive element which, when {{used in conjunction with}} a resistive <b>load</b> <b>bank,</b> creates a lagging power factor load. Typically, the {{inductive load}} will be rated at a numeric value 75% that of the corresponding resistive load such that when applied together a resultant 0.8 power factor load is provided. That is to say, for each 100 kW of resistive load, 75 kVAr of inductive load is provided. Other ratios are possible to obtain other power factor ratings. An inductive load is used to simulate a real-life mixed commercial loads consisting of lighting, heating, motors, transformers, etc. With a resistive-inductive <b>load</b> <b>bank,</b> full power system testing is possible, because the provided impedance supplies currents out of phase with voltage and allows for performance evaluation of generators, voltage regulators, load tap changers, conductors, switchgear and other equipment.|$|E
50|$|They are {{generally}} used {{where more than}} 50 A is required or 3 phase temporary connections are needed, and to connect large generators or building disconnects to distribution panels,or for test connections to <b>load</b> <b>bank</b> equipment for generator load certification; special events and the interconnection of entertainment lighting and sound equipment to power sources. They are usually found only in professional environments,where connections are performed by qualified personnel.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{possible}} to use the brake grids {{as a form of}} dynamometer or <b>load</b> <b>bank</b> to perform a [...] "self load" [...] test of locomotive engine horsepower. With the locomotive stationary, the main generator (MG) output is connected to the grids instead of the traction motors. The grids are normally large enough to absorb the full engine output power, which is calculated from MG voltage and current output.|$|E

5000|$|Silent Hawk: A former [...] "black program" [...] {{from the}} 1990s that hid special Hawk {{missiles}} with passive sensors within select US Army Hawk batteries deployed in Europe. Most of the soldiers, except {{a small group}} in each unit, were completely unaware of the special equipment which included a special separate sensor disguised as a <b>load</b> <b>bank</b> on heavy generators, firing displays and power generation equipment that made it all work.|$|E
50|$|Typically, an {{automatic}} controller operates the turbine inlet valve to maintain constant speed (and frequency) when the load {{changes on the}} generator. In a system connected to a grid with multiple sources, the turbine control ensures that power always flows out from the generator to the system. The frequency of the alternating current generated needs to match the local standard utility frequency. In some systems, if the useful load on the generator is not high enough, a <b>load</b> <b>bank</b> may be automatically connected to the generator to dissipate energy not required by the load; while this wastes energy, it may be required if it's not possible to control the water flow through the turbine.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{is focused on}} designing a controllable, dry type resistor <b>load</b> <b>bank</b> for load testing purpose and developing a model to simulate the load controlling techniques in modern load banks. A literature review was carried out on the types of load banks and their applications. The operation and the drawbacks of the liquid type <b>load</b> <b>bank,</b> which is commonly used in industry, are discussed by studying the generator load testing procedure at Colombo Dockyard PLC (CDPLC). This addresses the practical difficulties, operational issues and limitations encountered in the generator load testing procedure. A study {{has been done on}} the main components in a modern dry type <b>load</b> <b>bank,</b> including the selection method of power resistors and their special construction features. The variation of resistance values with the temperature is discussed in detail. Different load controlling techniques available in modern load banks are discussed and a MATLAB Simulink Model is developed to simulate the automatic load controlling with the variation of temperature in a linearly switched <b>load</b> <b>bank</b> with PWM tailing. A detail design proposal of a dry type <b>load</b> <b>bank,</b> from the capacity selection to design stage, including ratings, resistor composition, arrangement, resistor selection, cooling design, power circuit design, control safety and indication designs is given considering the requirement of generator load testing at CDPLC. A Bill of Material is given for the major components used in the implementation stage. An economic analysis on the proposed <b>load</b> <b>bank</b> was done in comparison with the present load testing procedure by conducting a case study with actual test data and major cost components obtained from a recently completed ship building project at CDPLC. The advantages and the economical aspects of the design proposal were discussed presenting the limitations and further improvement opportunities...|$|E
