25|$|During {{the initial}} phases, the North–South Expressway project {{was criticized for}} its {{sluggish}} progress pace. As of 1986, only about 350km (or two-third of the entire length) of the expressway was completed. The work progress became worse due to the nationwide economic setback caused by the falling prices of commodities like rubber and tin. As a result, the government had to revise its initial policy of having the Malaysian Highway Authority (LLM) to execute the entire construction job and decided to have the expressway project to be privatised, citing {{the success of the}} privatisation of the North Klang Straits Bypass FT20 in 1985 by Shapadu A <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>intention</b> was sent to United Engineers (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd. (now UEM Group) on 29 December 1986 before being finalised in 1988. The privatisation agreement had {{led to the formation of}} Highway Concessionaires Berhad which would later become Projek Lebuhraya Utara-Selatan Berhad (PLUS). PLUS took over the construction, operation and maintenance jobs of the North–South Expressway from LLM starting from March 1998, together with the Skudai Highway FT1.|$|E

30|$|Since 2000, {{especially}} {{in the aftermath of}} the 2008 global financial crisis, there has witnessed the spatial relocation of labour-intensive manufacturing firms from the coastal China to Southeast Asia. For instance, Myanmar’s clothing exports jumped from $ 700  m to $ 1.7 billion between 2011 and 2014. H&M, a European retailer, recently shifted sweater production from China to the Myanmar Century Liaoyuan Knitted Wear factory, a Chinese-run facility in outer Yangon (HKTDC 2013). Taiwan-based contract manufacturer Foxconn signed a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>intention</b> 2011 to invest up to $ 1 billion in Jakarta Province in Indonesia as it seeks to diversify production away from China. The letter states that the city has committed to provide a 200 -hectare plot of land in Marunda, Central Jakarta, for the upcoming factory. The agreement was signed jointly by Foxconn chairman Terry Gou and Jakarta governor Joko Widodo. Foxconn operations in Indonesia would focus on the domestic market of around 240 million people, he said, but the company could also export to the rest of the South-east Asian region. In 2013 Japanese investment doubled in South-East Asia and shrank by 40  % in China (The Economist 2015). Moreover, the state-designated economic rebalancing of China reflected in the National 12 th Five-Year Plan (2011 – 2016), coupled with the government’s increased emphasis on industrial upgrades for higher-value production, has diminished China’s appeal as a location for low-cost, labour-intensive manufacturing. The scenario of “China makes all” has gradually come under challenges. Furthermore, rising domestic consumption in China has helped TNCs relocated in neighbouring regions. As the purchasing power of Chinese buyers grows, the average distance travelled by consumer-goods exports is changing, depending on whether they are shipped from Asia, Europe or North America. From 2008 to 2012, the average journey length for Asian exports fell by 4.5  %, while those from Europe and North America rose by 25.9 and 13.7  %, respectively. That makes transportation costs cheaper for Asian factories (The Economist 2015). While with well recognition of the influential political factors, i.e. the “South China Sea” disputes, the comprehensive analysis of political issues will remain in another study in future. Instead, this paper puts more emphasis on economic geographical aspects of cross-border relocation of manufacturing production from China to Southeast Asia.|$|E

40|$|II MoMAR Workshop, Horta (Azores, Portugal), 14 - 17 June 2002. […] The InterRidge Monitoring and Observatories Working Group {{organized}} II MoMAR Workshop. The {{goals of}} this meeting were: 1) to establish a realistic short (5 years) plan of experiments to monitor the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at the MoMAR area; 2) {{to have a better}} definition of the geographical scope and targets of the MoMAR project; 3) to establish the basis for the data and site management associated with MoMAR projects, and 4) to decide on the follow-up structure of MoMAR. This II Workshop is convened {{at the same time as}} two <b>Letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>Intention</b> for European projects (See Appendix IV) have been submitted to the VI European Framework Science Program for future consideration. In addition, a more specific Vent-Sites Management Workshop took place immediately after the II MoMAR Workshop (see supplement 4 of Arquipélago). The first day (15 June) of the Workshop was dedicated to summary talks on different scientific disciplines (biology, hydrothermalism, geology and geophysics) and on the planning and philosophy of the Ridge 2000 Integrated Sites, followed by short discussions. These sessions were intended to provide a common basis of understanding of the needs, scientific goals, and limitations for each discipline, required to establish effective interdisciplinary projects. The second day (16 June) was dedicated to three series of discussions by Working Groups. At the request of the biological community, two disciplinary groups (Biology and Earth Sciences Working Groups) were established to briefly outline their goals. These were followed by discussions on site projects and planning (Lucky Strike Working Group and Rainbow, Menez Gwen and larger MoMAR area Working Group). The afternoon was dedicated to more general discussions on management and future requirements for the implementation of MoMAR (Data Management Working Group, MoMAR site Management Working Group, and Technology Development Working Group). The morning of the last day (17 June) was dedicated to presentation of results of the different Working Groups, and the discussion of the follow-up structure for MoMAR.
