6000|$|... "Mr. Hurd," [...] he begged, [...] "do <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> question! Why do {{you refuse}} me? What harm can I {{possibly}} do {{by talking to}} your villagers?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Jacks," [...] he said, [...] "you are, I am sure, a {{very clever}} man. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> question. Has it ever fallen to your lot {{to make a}} mistake?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And you and Fan {{together}} {{met this}} man and never mentioned it to me! <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> question more, Constance. Is this person you are engaged to a Christian or an infidel?" ...|$|E

60|$|In conclusion, Sir, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> not {{to force}} on me this {{continued}} correspondence by daily attacks. It is a trouble and a nuisance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Finsbury, I have {{no means}} of showing you my gratitude; but <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> question," [...] said Pitman. [...] "If I were a very rich client, would you not take the risk?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Several," [...] replied Tommy. [...] "Look here, you've {{been asking}} {{me a lot}} of questions. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> for a change. Why didn't you kill me off at once before I regained consciousness?" ...|$|E

I feel so well acquainted with you through Mrs. Easterfield that I shall give a great deal of weight to your opinion. But first <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> thing: After what you have heard of me {{do you think}} I am a flirt?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, don't say that!" [...] exclaimed Mr. Hemphill. [...] "Don't say that! Not for {{the world}} would I give up the memory of hearing her say she once loved me! I don't care how many years ago it was. I am glad you let me come here. I am glad she told me. I shall never forget the {{happiness}} I have had in this house. And now, Mrs. Easterfield, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> thing--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I quite {{agree with}} you," [...] said Matt, [...] "and that isn't what I mean. But {{if it would}} have been right and well for him to come forward at such a time, why shouldn't some other man, who does love her?" [...] He hurried tremulously on: [...] "Wade, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> thing more! You have seen her so much more than I; and I didn't know--Is it possible--Perhaps I ought to ask if you are at all--if you care for her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{for that}} individual, Mr Venus,' remarks Wegg, {{when he is}} fully gone, 'I have been passed over! <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> {{what you think of}} him?' ...|$|R
3000|$|Jimmie:—I’m talkin’. Now <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> a question, Jules. When {{you drove}} in here, {{did you notice}} a sign out front that said, ‘Dead nigger storage?’ [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... 'They were, when I {{last heard}} of them. They {{are not at}} home. By the way, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you.</b> Is {{it true that you}} were seen there?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Peter Prosper, {{before you}} go <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> question. Which of the two has been the rudest to the other? You have come {{and asked me to}} marry you, and have evidently wished to back out of it from the moment in which you found that I had ideas of my own about money. And now you call me rude, because I have my little revenge. I have called you Peter Prosper, and you can't stand it. You haven't spirit enough to call me Matty Thoroughbung in reply. But good-bye, Mr. Prosper,--for I never will call you Peter again. As to what I said to you about money, that, of course, is all bosh. I'll pay Soames's bill, and will never trouble you. There's your letter, which, however, would be of no use, because it is not signed. A very stupid letter it is. If you want to write {{naturally}} you should never copy a letter. Good-bye, Mr. Prosper--Peter that never shall be." [...] Then she got up {{and walked out of the}} room.|$|E
60|$|Tenth, and lastly, Bear {{with one}} word farther. What greater {{contempt}} can be thrown upon the saints than for their brethren to cast them off, or to debar them church communion? Think you {{not that the}} world may groundly say, Some great iniquity lies hid in the skirts of your brethren; when in truth the transgression is yet your own? But I say, what can the church do more to the sinners or open profane? Civil commerce you will have with the worst, and what more have you with these? Perhaps you will say we can pray and preach with these; and hold them Christians, saints, and godly. Well, but <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> word farther: Do you believe, that of very conscience they cannot consent, as you, to that of water baptism? And {{that if they had}} light therein, they would as willingly do it as you? Why then, as I have shewed you, our refusal to hold communion with them is without a ground from the word of God. But can you commit your soul to their ministry, and join with them in prayer; and yet not count them meet for other gospel privileges? I wold know by what scripture you do it? Perhaps you will say, I commit not my soul to their ministry, only hear them occasionally for trial. If this be all the respect thou hast for them and their ministry, thou mayest have as much for the worst that pisseth against the wall. But if thou canst hear them as God's ministers, and sit under their ministry as God's ordinance; then shew me where God hath such a gospel ministry, as that the persons ministering may not, though desiring it, be admitted with you to the closest communion of saints. But if thou sittest under their ministry for fleshly politic ends, thou hearest the word like an atheist, and art thyself, while thou judgest thy brother, in the practice of the worst of men. But I say, where do you find this piece-meal communion with men that profess faith and holiness as you, and separation from the world. If you object, that my principles lead me to have communion with all; I answer with all as afore described; if they will have communion with me.|$|E
5000|$|During {{a public}} hearing of the National Assembly that day, Sung criticized the Ministry of Gender Equality: [...] "For those people who don't even {{understand}} the mechanisms of the male sex, what Youth Sex Protection Law do you want? What law {{do you want to}} be made? ... Who are those crazy beings who oppose the protection of children and teens against sex crimes? Of course our priority is to protect kids and teens against sexual offenses. Have any of you watched porn before? Have you watched porn to masturbate? Yes or no? But <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> thing: is your goal to protect children and teenager from sexual offences? or is it to suppress every man’s sexual desire and control his guilt?Female exposure is not the cause of one’s sex drive, and is not the cause of sex offenses, and yet animated porn becomes the cause of a man’s sex crimes? Please stop making such bullshit claims! I don’t know about other men, but isn’t this nonsense? I too watch porn! And you know why?" [...] He said that pornography was [...] "a means for a man to ease his sex drive, relieve himself, and excrete his load. So because porn amplifies a man’s sex drive, this makes him go outside, find a new victim and commit a new sex crime? Please stop romanticizing the whole thing!" [...] According to Sung, [...] "Just 20 years ago, women would go to the pharmacy and hide their sanitary pads in newspaper and buy them as if they were drugs. But 20 years later, Korean women’s sanitary pads are in your face, and they even have a menstruation festival ... Had men not acknowledged and understood femininity, do you think this would have been possible?" ...|$|E
6000|$|D. You put it very home to <b>me.</b> Pray <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> another question: Are {{you in any}} {{likelihood}} of getting your ship off, if you refuse it? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{will pass}} over {{that for the}} present. But do <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> {{do you think it}} possible, I say possible, that you and Frank should be married?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Isabella, I am serious. But first <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> {{have you}} no {{suspicion}} that I {{may have been}} privy to the strange chance which befell you yesterday morning?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A modern Theatre, as I {{heard you}} say, Sows seeds of evil broadcast--well it may; But <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> my {{respected}} son, Pray, {{have you ever}} ventured into one?" ...|$|R
500|$|Eaton: [...] "Then <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> if the prosecuting {{officers}} {{have not been}} entirely correct in repelling all insinuations that you ever had tolerated any such means for raising funds." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And what, Sir,' said Pott--'what, Sir, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> as an {{impartial}} man, {{is the state}} of the public mind in London, with reference to my contest with the INDEPENDENT?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Very well,' {{said this}} gentleman, briskly smiling, and folding his arms. 'That's a horse. Now, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> girls and boys, Would you paper {{a room with}} {{representations}} of horses?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Glad to see {{you both}} so ruddy; Cobhurst air must agree with you. And now, before we say {{anything}} else, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> a question: Have you had your supper?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{does seem}} inconsistent, Mr. Crocker; I grant you that. No doubt it is so. But <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> something: {{did you ever}} yet know {{a woman who was}} not inconsistent?" ...|$|R
