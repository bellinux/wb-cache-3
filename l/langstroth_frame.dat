5000|$|Historically, a [...] "Langstroth hive" [...] is {{the hive}} that was {{designed}} by Rev. L. L. Langstroth in 1852. The historical Langstroth hive had a portico entrance, integrated floor and non-removable brood box, a single removable honey box (using the same frame size as the brood box) that sat inside an outer box that extended from the brood box, and a hinged roof. L. L. Langstroth's famous book on beekeeping went through several editions until about 1900, but {{in all of them}} the hive that is illustrated {{is the same as the}} original design. The original <b>Langstroth</b> <b>frame</b> dimensions are no longer in use.|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{describe}} {{a system for}} the in situ collection of volatiles from bees enclosed on a standard <b>Langstroth</b> <b>frame</b> face. The system includes an observation frame consisting of a glass plate and an aluminum frame that encloses a single frame face. A push-pull airflow system and an in-line volatile collection filter allow for air exchange and headspace volatile capture. This system can provide insight into colony chemical communication. The emissions of four compounds (2 -heptanone, methyl benzoate, decanal, and 3 -carene) associated with adult bees or colony materials remained steady or increased slightly in repeated collections from frames with maturing larvae. The emissions of the larval food component octanoic acid reflected changes in food consumption patterns by differently aged larvae. The production of the primer pheromone E-β-ocimene was greatest in comb containing young larvae and recently capped brood, but was lower on comb with capping larvae...|$|E
40|$|Bees need wax as {{construction}} material for their combs. They produce {{it in their}} wax glands, which are fully developed in 12 to 18 days old workers. In older bees the wax glands diminish their activity. However in emergency situations wax-synthesis can be reactivated. Greatest quantities of wax are produced during the growth phase of bee colonies, under moderate climate conditions during April to June. A bibliography on the synthesis of beeswax is given in the monograph of Hepburn 12. The main raw materials for wax formation are carbohydrates, i. e. the honey sugars fructose, glucose and sucrose 45. The ratio of sugar to wax can vary from 3 to 30 : 1, a ratio of around 20 : 1 being typical for central Europe 45. The stronger the colony, the smaller the ratio, the more economical the wax production for the colony. One <b>Langstroth</b> <b>frame,</b> containing only 100 g of wax can hold 2 - 4 kg of honey. Wax production and comb construction activity in the bee colony are determined by following factors: • Nectar flow: the greater the flow, the more combs are needed for storage. • Brood rearing (egg laying) : the more eggs are layed, the more comb cells are needed. • The presence of a queen: only colonies with a queen build combs. • Temperature: temperatures higher than 15 ° C favour comb building activity • The presence of pollen as a protein sourc...|$|E
50|$|A nuc hive {{has all the}} {{features}} of a standard 10 <b>frame</b> <b>Langstroth</b> hive except with a reduced width. A link shows a United States Department of Agriculture USDA layout for building a nuc. A typical nuc has 5 <b>Langstroth</b> <b>frames</b> arranged side-by-side.|$|R
5000|$|In modern beekeeping, a Langstroth hive is any {{vertically}} modular bee hive that accepts frames {{that are}} locally {{referred to as}} [...] "Langstroth" [...] frames. The actual dimensions of so-called <b>Langstroth</b> <b>frames</b> differ by region or manufacturer. These modern Langstroth hives {{have little in common}} with Rev. L. L. Langstroth's bee hive that was originally patented in 1852 and manufactured until approximately 1920.|$|R
50|$|<b>Langstroth</b> <b>frames</b> {{are often}} {{reinforced}} with wire, {{making it possible}} to spin the honey out of the comb in a centrifuge. As a result, the empty frames and comb can be returned to the beehive for re-filling by the bees. Creating honeycomb involves a significant energy investment, conservatively estimated at 6.25 kilograms of honey needed to create 1 kilogram of comb in temperate climates. Reusing comb can thus increase the productivity of a beekeeping enterprise.|$|R
50|$|A {{version with}} {{straight}} sides {{was developed by}} Henry Mulzac by 1977, which used Langstroth compatible dimensions. The South African Jackson hive also uses <b>Langstroth</b> sized <b>frames.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{commercial}} honey producers use <b>Langstroth</b> hive <b>frames.</b> The {{honey extraction}} process yields beeswax from the uncapping process. The highest quality beeswax is almost white. Lower quality beeswax from older cappings or comb is yellow or brown. Beeswax should be rendered and filtered {{before it is}} sold.|$|R
50|$|In 1814, Petro Prokopovych, {{the founder}} of {{commercial}} beekeeping in Ukraine, invented {{one of the very}} first beehive frames. However, for easy operations in beehives the spaces between elements need to be correct. The correct distance between combs was described in 1845 by Jan Dzierżon as 1½ inches from the center of one top bar {{to the center of the}} next one. In 1848 Dzierzon introduced grooves into the hive's side walls replacing the strips of wood for moving top bars. The grooves were 8 x 8 mm, the spacing later termed bee space. The Langstroth hive was the first successful top-opened hive with movable <b>frames.</b> <b>Langstroth</b> hive was however a direct descendant of Dzierzon's hive designs.|$|R
50|$|In entomology, {{the term}} brood {{is used to}} refer to the embryo or egg, the larva and the pupa stages in the life of {{holometabolous}} insects. The brood of honey bees develops within a bee hive. In man-made, removable frame hives, such as <b>Langstroth</b> hives, each <b>frame</b> which is mainly brood is called a brood frame. Brood frames usually have some pollen and nectar or honey in the upper corners of the frame. The rest of the brood frames cells may be empty or occupied by brood in various developmental stages. During the brood raising season, the bees may reuse the cells from which brood has emerged for additional brood or convert it to honey or pollen storage. Bees show remarkable flexibility in adapting cells to a use best suited for the hive's survival.|$|R
40|$|Twenty {{indigenous}} (Apis mellifera yemenitica) honeybee colonies {{were transferred}} from the traditional log hives into modern movable <b>frame</b> (<b>Langstroth)</b> hives and divided into 4 Groups. Each group was provided with a modified frame to assess the effect of frame-type on colony settlement, wax secretion, sugar syrup and pollen consumption, sealed brood area, honey and pollen storage. Role of sugar syrup and pollen patty feeding was also evaluated for easy Apis mellifera yemenitica establishment in modern hives under Riyadh conditions. In treatment A and B where the frames were provided with complete wax foundation sheets and one inch wide wax foundation stripe, respectively showed complete colony`s settlement. In treatments C the wired frame without wax foundation sheet and in treatment D where the frames were without wire and wax foundation sheets out of 5 could settle only 3 and 2 - Apis mellifera yemenitica colonies respectively. The food consumption rate remained high in treatment B followed by A, C and D, respectively whereas the sealed brood area, honey and pollen storage were found maximum in treatment A followed by B, C and D, respectively. The dimensions of the hive cells were found different in frames with the wax foundation sheet and without wax foundation sheet. The bees constructed larger cells 27 /sq. inch in frames with wax foundation sheets and smaller cells 34 /sq. inch in frames without wax foundation sheets...|$|R
