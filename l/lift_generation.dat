5|$|As in {{the wings}} of modern birds, the flight {{feathers}} of Archaeopteryx were somewhat asymmetrical and the tail feathers were rather broad. This implies that the wings and tail were used for <b>lift</b> <b>generation,</b> but {{it is unclear whether}} Archaeopteryx was capable of flapping flight or simply a glider. The lack of a bony breastbone suggests that Archaeopteryx was not a very strong flier, but flight muscles might have attached to the thick, boomerang-shaped wishbone, the platelike coracoids, or perhaps, to a cartilaginous sternum. The sideways orientation of the glenoid (shoulder) joint between scapula, coracoid, and humerus—instead of the dorsally angled arrangement found in modern birds—may indicate that Archaeopteryx was unable to lift its wings above its back, a requirement for the upstroke found in modern flapping flight. According to a study by Philip Senter in 2006, Archaeopteryx was indeed unable to use flapping flight as modern birds do, but it may well have used a downstroke-only flap-assisted gliding technique.|$|E

50|$|At {{the point}} where the density drops, the local speed of sound {{correspondingly}} drops and a shock wave can form. This is why in conventional wings, shock waves form first after the maximum Thickness/Chord and why all airliners designed for cruising in the transonic range (above M0.8) have supercritical wings that are flatter on top resulting in minimized angular change of flow to upper surface air. The angular change to the air that is normally part of <b>lift</b> <b>generation</b> is decreased and this lift reduction is compensated for by deeper curved lower surfaces accompanied by a reflex curve at the trailing edge. This results in a much weaker standing shock wave towards the rear of the upper wing surface and a corresponding increase in critical mach number.|$|E

However, the applicability of this method to simulate moving boundary problems has not received sufficient attention. The present study primarily focuses on developing and employing the halfway bounceback LBM to analyse the flow dynamics associated with the flapping motion of finite-thickness wings. A two-dimensional numerical model for one and two-winged 'clap and fling' stroke has been developed to study the aerodynamic performance of insect flight. The influence of kinematic parameters such as the percentage overlap between translational and rotational phase ξ, the separation between two wings δ and different Reynolds numbers Re on <b>lift</b> <b>generation</b> has been studied and presented here.

Results show that overlap ratio ξ is the most influential parameter in enhancing lift. With increase in separation δ, the reduction in drag is far more dominant than the decrease in lift. With an increase in Re (which ranges between 8 and 128), the mean drag coefficient decreases monotonously, whereas the mean lift coefficient decreases to a minimum and increases thereafter.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is to provide a}} better {{understanding}} of the aerodynamic performance of various planform shapes undergoing various kinematics for flapping wing flight. There have been extensive analyses and experiments of 2 D airfoils undergoing flapping motion. These studies reveal various mechanisms for unsteady aerodynamic lift and thrust generation such as the importance of the control of leading edge vortices. However, 3 D analysis of flapping wing flight with various planform shapes is required to study 3 D flow structures and their role in determining the lift and thrust for the design of a future flapping wing micro air vehicle. Firstly, CFD analysis has been carried out on 5 rigid simple planform shapes (rectangle, reverse ellipse, ellipse, triangle and four ellipse) at a Reynolds number of 13500 to determine the effect of planform shape on the aerodynamic performance of a flapping wing undergoing hover kinematics. The kinematics is described in terms of only 2 angles, sweep and pitch. The performance is compared through the use of force histories, pressure distribution plots, flow structure images, power utilized and lift generated. It is found that the area distribution near the wing tip contributes to the difference in <b>lift</b> <b>generation</b> between the five planforms. The rectangular planform is found to have the best performance with a suitable balance of power consumed and lift generated as compared to the reverse ellipse which has the highest <b>lift</b> <b>generation.</b> Secondly, the kinematics from a honeybee and thrips are used on the same 5 planform shapes to determine the effect of kinematics on the performance of each planform. These kinematics are more realistic as the variations of all the 3 angles (sweep, pitch and elevation) are considered. It is found from the analysis that the reverse ellipse planform performs the best in terms of <b>lift</b> <b>generation</b> but the ellipse performs better overall when power economy (ratio of average vertical force generated to the average power consumed) is considered. In thrips kinematics, the reverse ellipse is again seen to perform the best in terms of the power economy.

The successful flight of MAVs is strongly related {{to the understanding of}} unsteady aerodynamic performance of low Reynolds number airfoils under dynamic flapping motion. This study explored the effects of flapping frequency, stroke amplitude, and the inclined angle of stroke plane on lift force and thrust force of a bio-inspiration corrugated airfoil with 33 full factorial design of experiment and ANOVA analysis. Unsteady vorticity flows over a corrugated thin airfoil executing flapping motion are computed with time-dependent two-dimensional laminar incompressible Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations with the conformal hybrid mesh.
