5|$|Classifications in {{the first}} half of the 20th century divided lemurs into three families: Daubentoniidae, Indriidae, and <b>Lemuridae,</b> with the latter {{including}} the current Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae. Because of concerns that <b>Lemuridae</b> might not be monophyletic, the family was later split; in 1982 Tattersall separated the Cheirogaleidae for the dwarf lemurs, mouse lemurs and relatives, and the Lepilemuridae for the sportive lemurs and bamboo lemurs (including the greater bamboo lemur). This classification is still used, except that the bamboo lemurs were moved back to <b>Lemuridae.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{generally}} agreed that the aye-aye is the most basal member of the lemur clade, {{the relationship between the}} other four families is less clear since they diverged during a narrow 10 to 12million-year window between the Late Eocene (42mya) and into the Oligocene (30mya). Although all studies place Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae as a sister clade to Indriidae and <b>Lemuridae,</b> some suggest that Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae diverged first, while others suggest that Indriidae and <b>Lemuridae</b> were the first to branch off.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{difficulty}} in discerning the relationships within family <b>Lemuridae,</b> not all authorities agree on the taxonomy, {{although the majority of}} the primatological community favors the current classification.|$|E
5|$|Family <b>Lemuridae</b> {{consists}} of the ring-tailed lemur, the brown lemurs, the bamboo lemurs and the ruffed lemurs. There are 21extant species and six subspecies.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{relatively}} few studies {{of learning and}} cognition have been performed on strepsirrhine primates, including ruffed lemurs. However, a study at the Myakka City Lemur Reserve demonstrated that ruffed lemurs, along with several {{other members of the}} family <b>Lemuridae,</b> could understand the outcome of simple arithmetic operations.|$|E
5|$|Being {{the most}} frugivorous {{members of the}} family <b>Lemuridae,</b> {{consuming}} an average of 74–90% fruit, ruffed lemurs also consume nectar (4–21%), and supplement the rest of their diet with young leaves (3–6%), mature leaves (1%), flowers (3–6%), and some seeds. Ruffed lemurs have also been reported to come to the ground to eat fungi and exhibit geophagy.|$|E
5|$|The ruffed lemur genus, Varecia, is {{a member}} of the family <b>Lemuridae.</b> The extinct genus, Pachylemur most closely resembled the ruffed lemurs but died out after the arrival of humans. The genus Varecia {{contains}} two species, red ruffed lemurs and black-and-white ruffed lemurs, the latter having three subspecies.|$|E
5|$|The ruffed lemurs of {{the genus}} Varecia are strepsirrhine {{primates}} and the largest extant lemurs within the family <b>Lemuridae.</b> Like all living lemurs, they are found only {{on the island of}} Madagascar. Formerly considered to be a monotypic genus, two species are now recognized: the black-and-white ruffed lemur, with its three subspecies, and the red ruffed lemur.|$|E
5|$|Among extant strepsirrhines, {{only the}} diurnal and cathemeral lemurs {{have evolved to}} live in multi-male/multi-female groups, {{comparable}} to most living simians. This social trait, seen in two extant lemur families (Indriidae and <b>Lemuridae),</b> {{is thought to have}} evolved independently. Group sizes are smaller in social lemurs than in simians, and despite the similarities, the community structures differ. Female dominance, which is rare in simians, is fairly common in lemurs. Strepsirrhines spend a considerable amount of time grooming each other (allogrooming). When lemuriform primates groom, they lick the fur and then comb it with their toothcomb. They also use their grooming claw to scratch places they cannot reach with their mouth.|$|E
5|$|The {{mating season}} lasts from May through July, during the cold, rainy season, {{resulting}} in birth and peak lactation {{coinciding with the}} time that fruit is the most plentiful. The gestation period of ruffed lemurs is the shortest of the family <b>Lemuridae,</b> averaging 102 days (with a range of 90 to 106 days). Gestation in the wild last slightly longer than in captivity, averaging 106 days. Just like the mating season, parturition is also seasonal, synchronized {{to the end of}} the cold, dry season and the start of the productive hot, rainy season.|$|E
5|$|English {{comparative}} anatomist William Henry Flower created the suborder Lemuroidea in 1883 to distinguish these primates from the simians, which were grouped under English biologist St. George Jackson Mivart's suborder Anthropoidea (=Simiiformes). According to Flower, the suborder Lemuroidea contained the families <b>Lemuridae</b> (lemurs, lorises, and galagos), Chiromyidae (aye-aye), and Tarsiidae (tarsiers). Lemuroidea was later replaced by Illiger's suborder Prosimii. Many years earlier, in 1812, É. Geoffroy first named the suborder Strepsirrhini, {{in which he}} included the tarsiers. This taxonomy went unnoticed until 1918, when Pocock compared {{the structure of the}} nose and reinstated the use of the suborder Strepsirrhini, while also moving the tarsiers and the simians into a new suborder, Haplorhini. It was not until 1953, when British anatomist William Charles Osman Hill wrote an entire volume on strepsirrhine anatomy, that Pocock's taxonomic suggestion became noticed and more widely used. Since then, primate taxonomy has shifted between Strepsirrhini-Haplorhini and Prosimii-Anthropoidea multiple times.|$|E
5|$|From the 1970s to the 1990s, {{there have}} been {{suggestions}} that the ruffed lemurs {{might be related to}} indriids or a sister group to <b>Lemuridae</b> and Indriidae and that the bamboo lemurs are related to the sportive lemurs, but neither view is supported by molecular phylogeny. The sportive lemurs and the extinct koala lemurs (Megaladapidae) both lack upper incisors in the permanent dentition, and in 1981, Groves placed both together in the family Megaladapidae, which he renamed Lepilemuridae in 2005 because that older name takes precedence. Genetic research does not support a close relationship between the sportive and koala lemurs and instead places the koala lemurs as a sister group to Lemuridae; therefore, the two are now placed in separate families (Lepilemuridae for the sportive lemurs and Megaladapidae for the koala lemurs). The sloth lemurs (Palaeopropithecidae) and monkey lemurs (Archaeolemuridae) were classified as subfamilies within Indriidae as late as 1982, but are now recognized as separate families.|$|E
25|$|Madagascar: American zoologists led by {{geneticist}} Edward Louis {{announced on}} 14 January {{the discovery of}} two new species of <b>Lemuridae.</b>|$|E
500|$|Together {{with the}} twelve other true lemurs (genus Eulemur), the {{collared}} brown lemur (E. collaris) {{is a type}} of lemur [...] belonging to the family <b>Lemuridae.</b> [...] Collectively, lemurs (infraorder Lemuriformes) are classified as strepsirrhine primates. [...] Originally listed as a subspecies of the common brown lemur (E. fulvus), the collared brown lemur was promoted to full species status in 2001 by biological anthropologist Colin Groves.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to an abnormally short gestation period, ruffed lemurs share another feature with small, nocturnal lemurs by producing the largest litters of the family <b>Lemuridae.</b> Litters typically include two or three infants, although up to five have been reported. Birth weights in captivity average between [...] and range from [...] Ruffed lemur infants are altricial, and are born with their eyes open and a full coat of fur.|$|E
500|$|Ruffed lemurs are {{the largest}} extant {{members of the family}} <b>Lemuridae,</b> with an average head-body length between [...] and a total length from , while ranging in weight from [...] The thick, furry tail is longer than the body, {{averaging}} [...] in length and is used primarily for balance while moving through the trees. Ruffed lemurs exhibit neither sexual dimorphism nor sexual dichromatism, and females have three pairs of mammary glands.|$|E
500|$|The {{relationships}} among the families of lemurs have been problematic and {{have yet to be}} definitively resolved. [...] Two competing phylogenies exist based on genetic and molecular data. [...] One approach (Horvath etal.) looks at a larger number of genes, but among fewer species. [...] This results in <b>Lemuridae</b> being a sister group to Lepilemuridae, Cheirogaleidae, and Indriidae. [...] The other approach (Orlando etal.) looks at fewer genes, but more lemur species. [...] Using this analysis, Lepilemuridae becomes the sister group to <b>Lemuridae,</b> Cheirogaleidae, and Indriidae. Both phylogenies agree that the Malagasy primates are monophyletic and that Daubentoniidae (the aye-aye) is basal to the lemuroid clade, having split off significantly earlier than the other families. [...] However, two problems create complications for both approaches. [...] First, the four most closely related living lemur families diverged within a narrow window of approximately 10million years, making it much harder to distinguish the splits with molecular evidence. [...] In addition, these families diverged from their last common ancestor approximately 42mya; such distant splits create a lot of noise for molecular techniques.|$|E
500|$|Determining the {{phylogeny}} of subfossil lemurs {{has been}} problematic because studies of morphology, developmental biology, and molecular phylogenetics have sometimes yielded conflicting results. All studies {{agree that the}} family Daubentoniidae (including the giant aye-aye) diverged first from the other lemurs at least 60million years ago. The relationship between the remaining families has been less clear. [...] Morphological, developmental, and molecular studies have offered support for lumping the four sloth lemur genera of the family Palaeopropithecidae with the family Indriidae (including the indri, sifakas, and woolly lemurs). [...] The placement of family Megaladapidae has been more controversial, with similarities in teeth and skull features suggesting {{a close relationship with}} family Lepilemuridae (sportive lemurs). [...] Molecular data, instead, indicate a closer relationship to family <b>Lemuridae.</b> [...] Likewise, a relationship between family Archaeolemuridae and family <b>Lemuridae</b> has been suggested, based on morphological and developmental traits, yet molar morphology, the number of teeth in the specialized toothcomb, and molecular analysis support a closer relationship with the indriid–sloth lemur clade. Other subfossil lemurs, including the giant aye-aye and Pachylemur, are more easily placed due to strong similarities with existing lemurs (the aye-aye and ruffed lemurs, respectively).|$|E
500|$|According to {{analysis}} of amino acid sequences, the branching {{of the family}} <b>Lemuridae</b> has been dated to 26.1±3.3mya while rRNA sequences of mtDNA place the split at 24.9±3.6mya. [...] The ruffed lemurs are the first genus to split away (most basal) in the family, a view that is further supported by analysis of DNA sequences and karyotypes. [...] Additionally, Molecular data suggests a deep genetic divergence and sister group relationship between the true lemurs (Eulemur) and the remaining three genera: Lemur, Hapalemur, and Prolemur.|$|E
500|$|Because of the similarities, Pachylemur is {{sometimes}} referred to as a giant ruffed lemur. [...] In addition to the morphological similarities, molecular studies also support a close relationship. [...] Based on studies of their DNA, Pachylemur and ruffed lemurs form the sister group relative {{to the rest of the}} lemurs in the family <b>Lemuridae.</b> [...] This sister group itself forms a sister group with the clade (related group) containing brown lemurs (Eulemur), the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur), the greater bamboo lemur (Prolemur), and the lesser bamboo lemurs (Hapalemur).|$|E
500|$|Lemurs have diversified greatly since first {{reaching}} Madagascar. [...] The aye-aye and its extinct {{relations are}} thought to have diverged first, shortly after colonization. [...] According to molecular studies, there have since been two major episodes of diversification, from which all other known extant and extinct family lineages emerged. [...] The remaining families diverged in the first diversification episode, during a 10 to 12million-year window between the Late Eocene (42mya) and into the Oligocene (30mya). [...] The dates for this divergence window span the Eocene–Oligocene extinction event, during which time climate cooling took place and changes in ocean currents altered weather patterns. [...] Outside of Madagascar, these dates also coincide with the divergence of the lorisoid primates and five major clades of squirrels, all occupying niches similar to those of lemurs. [...] The dates do not suggest that increased predation drove family-level divergence since the first carnivores arrived on the island between 24 and 18mya. [...] The precise relationship between the four of the five families of lemurs is disputed since they diverged during this narrow and distant window. [...] Although all studies place Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae as a sister clade to Indriidae and <b>Lemuridae,</b> some suggest that Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae diverged first, while others suggest that Indriidae and <b>Lemuridae</b> were the first to branch off.|$|E
500|$|The only extinct {{member of}} the family <b>Lemuridae,</b> the genus Pachylemur {{contains}} two species that closely resembled living ruffed lemurs. [...] Sometimes referred to as [...] "giant ruffed lemurs", they were approximately three times larger than ruffed lemurs, weighing between [...] [...] Despite their size, they were arboreal quadrupeds, possibly utilizing more suspensory behavior and cautious climbing than their sister taxon. [...] Their skull and teeth were similar to those of ruffed lemurs, suggesting a diet high in fruit and possibly some leaves. [...] The rest of its skeleton (postcrania) was much more robust and their vertebrae had distinctly different features.|$|E
500|$|The {{ring-tailed lemur}} (Lemur catta) {{is a large}} strepsirrhine primate and the most {{recognized}} lemur due to its long, black and white ringed tail. It belongs to <b>Lemuridae,</b> one of five lemur families, {{and is the only}} member of the Lemur genus. Like all lemurs it is endemic to the island of Madagascar. Known locally in Malagasy as [...] ( [...] , spelled [...] in French) or , it inhabits gallery forests to spiny scrub in the southern regions of the island. It is omnivorous and the most terrestrial of extant lemurs. The animal is diurnal, being active exclusively in daylight hours.|$|E
500|$|The {{ring-tailed lemur}} {{is thought to}} share closer affinities to the bamboo lemurs of the genera Hapalemur and Prolemur than {{to the other two}} genera in its family. This has been {{supported}} by comparisons in communication, chromosomes, genetics, and several morphological traits, such as scent gland similarities. [...] However, other data concerning immunology and other morphological traits fail to support this close relationship. [...] For example, Hapalemur and Prolemur have short snouts, while the ring-tailed lemur and the rest of <b>Lemuridae</b> have long snouts. However, differences in the relationship between the orbit (eye socket) and the muzzle suggest that the ring-tailed lemur and the true lemurs evolved their elongated faces independently.|$|E
500|$|Ruffed lemurs are {{seasonal}} breeders {{and highly}} unusual in their reproductive strategy. They are considered an [...] "evolutionary enigma" [...] {{in that they}} are the largest of the extant species in <b>Lemuridae,</b> yet exhibit reproductive traits more common in small, nocturnal lemurs, such as short gestation periods (~102 days) and relatively large average litter sizes (~2–3). Ruffed lemurs also build nests for their newborns (the only primates that do so), carry them by mouth, and exhibit an absentee parental system by stashing them while they forage. Infants are altricial, although they develop relatively quickly, traveling independently in the wild after 70 days and attaining full adult size by six months.|$|E
500|$|The {{collared}} {{brown lemur}} (Eulemur collaris), {{also known as}} the red-collared brown lemur or red-collared lemur, is a medium-sized strepsirrhine primate and one of twelve species of brown lemur in the family <b>Lemuridae.</b> [...] It is only found in south-eastern Madagascar. [...] Like most species of lemur, it is arboreal, moving quadrupedally and occasionally leaping from tree to tree. [...] Like other brown lemurs, this species is cathemeral (active during the day and the night; for more information please refer to Cathemerality), lives in social groups, primarily eats fruit, exhibits sexual dichromatism, and does not demonstrate female dominance. [...] The species is listed as Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and is threatened primarily by habitat loss.|$|E
500|$|Pachylemur {{remains were}} first {{described}} in 1895 by French zoologist Henri Filhol and were originally {{included in the}} genus Lemur, along with the ring-tailed lemur and other close relatives currently classified within the family <b>Lemuridae.</b> [...] In 1948, French paleontologist Charles Lamberton placed the species in the subgenus Pachylemur, which was recognized as a genus by 1979. [...] However, due to earlier uses of the name Pachylemur, the priority of an alternative genus name proposed by Guillaume Grandidier in 1905, and errors in Lamberton's 1948 description of the genus, {{the availability of the}} name under the rules of zoological nomenclature was considered questionable. [...] In 2011, a petition was filed with the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature to preserve the name.|$|E
500|$|The koala lemurs of {{the family}} Megaladapidae most closely {{resemble}} marsupial koalas from Australia. [...] According to genetic evidence they were most {{closely related to the}} family <b>Lemuridae,</b> although for many years they were paired with the sportive lemurs {{of the family}} Lepilemuridae due to similarities in their skulls and molar teeth. [...] They were slow climbers and had long forelimbs and powerful grasping feet, possibly using them for suspension. [...] Koala lemurs ranged in size from an estimated , making them as large as a male orangutan or a female gorilla. [...] They had poor day vision, short tails, lacked permanent upper incisors, and had a reduced toothcomb. [...] Their diet generally consisted of leaves, with some species being specialized folivores and others having a broader diet, possibly including tough seeds.|$|E
500|$|Since the 19th century, the {{classification}} of lemurs above the genus level has seen many changes. Early taxonomists proposed a variety of classifications for lemurs, but generally separated indriids from other lemurs and placed the aye-aye in a major group of its own; some classified the {{dwarf and mouse lemurs}} with the galagos. In 1915, William King Gregory published a classification that remained generally accepted over the next decades. He placed all the lemurs together in a [...] "series" [...] Lemuriformes and recognized three families: Daubentoniidae, Indriidae, and <b>Lemuridae</b> (including the current Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae). George Gaylord Simpson's influential 1945 classification of mammals placed the treeshrews and the fossil Anagale (both now classified outside Primates) inside Lemuriformes and classified the fossil families Plesiadapidae and Adapidae in a superfamily Lemuroidea with most of the lemurs.|$|E
500|$|All four genera of sloth lemurs {{are known}} to be a sister taxon (close relatives) of family Indriidae, which {{includes}} the indri (Indri), sifakas (Propithecus), and woolly lemurs (Avahi). [...] This relationship is supported by data from morphological, developmental, and molecular research. [...] Another member of this clade (related group) is the family of monkey lemurs (Archaeolemuridae). [...] Dental features, such as the morphology of their molar teeth and the modified number of teeth in their toothcomb (a specialized grooming structure found in lemuriforms), have long suggested a relationship. [...] However, other anatomical and developmental traits suggested that monkey lemurs might be more closely related to family <b>Lemuridae,</b> which include five genera of lemur, including the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta). [...] Molecular analysis has shown strong support for the former, placing the monkey lemurs in a clade with the sloth lemurs and indriids.|$|E
500|$|The {{biological}} rhythm {{can vary from}} nocturnal in smaller lemurs to diurnal in most larger lemurs. Diurnality is not seen in any other living strepsirrhine. Cathemerality, where an animal is active sporadically both day and night, occurs {{among some of the}} larger lemurs. Few if any other primates exhibit this sort of activity cycle, either regularly or irregularly under changing environmental conditions. The most heavily studied cathemeral lemurs are the true lemurs. Although the mongoose lemur (E. mongoz) is the best-documented example, every species in the genus studied has shown some degree of cathemeral behavior, although night activity is often restricted by light availability and moon periodicity. This type of behavior was first documented in the 1960s in true lemur species as well as other <b>Lemuridae</b> species, such as ruffed lemurs and bamboo lemurs. Initially described as [...] "crepuscular" [...] (active at dawn and dusk), anthropologist Ian Tattersall stimulated additional research and coined the new term [...] "cathemeral", although many non-anthropologists prefer the terms [...] "circadian" [...] or [...] "diel".|$|E
500|$|The {{ring-tailed lemur}} shares many {{similarities}} with ruffed lemurs (genus Varecia) and true lemurs (genus Eulemur), and its skeleton is nearly indistinguishable {{from that of}} the true lemurs. Consequently, the three genera were once grouped together in the genus Lemur and more recently are sometimes referred to as subfamily Lemurinae (within family <b>Lemuridae).</b> [...] However, ruffed lemurs were reassigned to the genus Varecia in 1962, and due to similarities between the ring-tailed lemur and the bamboo lemurs, particularly in regards to molecular evidence and scent glands similarities, the true lemurs were moved to the genus Eulemur by Yves Rumpler and Elwyn L. Simons (1988) as well as Colin Groves and Robert H. Eaglen (1988). [...] In 1991, Ian Tattersall and Jeffrey H. Schwartz reviewed the evidence and came to a different conclusion, instead favoring to return the members of Eulemur and Varecia to the genus Lemur. [...] However, this view was not widely accepted and the genus Lemur remained monotypic, containing only the ring-tailed lemur. [...] Because the differences in molecular data are so minute between the ring-tailed lemur and both genera of bamboo lemurs, {{it has been suggested that}} all three genera be merged.|$|E
