5|$|Carlos Castillo Armas (November 4, 1914 – July 26, 1957) was a Guatemalan {{military}} officer and politician. After taking {{power in a}} coup d'état, he served as the President of Guatemala from 1954 to 1957. A member of the right-wing National <b>Liberation</b> <b>Movement</b> (MLN) party, his authoritarian government was closely allied to the United States.|$|E
5|$|Between 1879 and 1885 {{he served}} as prelate of Van, after which he was forced into exile to Jerusalem. He was elected {{as head of the}} Armenian Church in 1892, however, he was enthroned {{more than a year later}} and served in that {{position}} until his death. He opposed the Russian government's attempt to confiscate the properties of the Armenian Church in 1903, which was later canceled partly due to his efforts. Khrimian further endorsed the <b>liberation</b> <b>movement</b> of the Armenian revolutionaries.|$|E
5|$|In {{cities and}} villages across Bulgaria, Levski's {{contributions}} to the <b>liberation</b> <b>movement</b> are commemorated with numerous monuments, and many streets bear his name. Monuments to Levski also exist outside Bulgaria—in Belgrade, Serbia, Dimitrovgrad, Serbia, Parcani, Transnistria, Moldova, Bucharest, Romania, Paris, France, Washington, D.C., United States, and Buenos Aires, Argentina. Three museums dedicated to Levski have been organised: one in Karlovo, one in Lovech and one in Kakrina. The Monument to Vasil Levski in Sofia was erected {{on the site of}} his execution.|$|E
40|$|This article {{analyses}} selected Anti-Apartheid Movement (AAM) activities {{designed to}} publicise political prisoners and detainees. The political prisoner campaign was {{one way in}} which the AAM highlighted the role of the <b>liberation</b> <b>movements</b> fighting apartheid. It illustrates how the AAM not only played a key part in exposing the immorality of apartheid, but also in popularising the <b>liberation</b> <b>movements,</b> and especially the African National Congress (ANC). All AAM activity broadly supported the <b>liberation</b> <b>movements,</b> informed British public opinion on conditions in South Africa, and aimed to change British government policy. However, certain actions focused more specifically on popularising the <b>liberation</b> <b>movements</b> and specific members in these movements. Political prisoner campaigns showed the difficulties faced by specific people caught up in the South African judicial system {{and the way in which}} the South African government used trials and jail sentences to weaken the <b>liberation</b> <b>movements.</b> On the one hand, the AAM attempted to highlight the activity of the <b>liberation</b> <b>movements</b> inside South Africa and the violence of the South African regime. On the other hand, it appealed to international concerns about human rights. The AAM aimed to invert the idea that the <b>liberation</b> <b>movements</b> were primarily responsible for violence through focusing on violence by the regime. Of all the campaigns for individual prisoners, that for Nelson Mandela achieved the highest profile. These campaigns were effective in increasing international criticism of apartheid and provided an opportunity for many concerned about human right to take a stand against apartheid...|$|R

5|$|The Stonewall riots (also {{referred}} to as the Stonewall uprising or the Stonewall rebellion) were a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations by members of the gay (LGBT) community against a police raid {{that took place in the}} early morning hours of June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City.

Cuba strongly supported an aggressive policy of military support for African national <b>liberation</b> <b>movements</b> with Che Guevara, in co-operation with Ben Bella of Algeria, playing a leading role.|$|R
5|$|While Gomułka's anti-Soviet {{image was}} exaggerated, it was {{justified}} {{in the popular}} imagination by his anti-Stalinist line in 1948 and years of subsequent internment. Thus, Polish communists found themselves unexpectedly {{at the head of}} a national <b>liberation</b> <b>movement.</b> The enthusiastic public support offered to Gomułka contributed to the legitimization of communist rule in Poland, which incorporated mass nationalist, anti-Soviet feelings into the prevailing power structures. In Hungary, social protest destroyed the political system; in Poland, it was absorbed within it.|$|E
5|$|Although the June 28, 1969, Stonewall riots are {{generally}} considered {{the starting point}} of the modern gay <b>liberation</b> <b>movement,</b> a number of demonstrations and actions took place before that date. These actions, often organized by local homophile organizations but sometimes spontaneous, addressed concerns ranging from anti-gay discrimination in employment and public accommodations to the exclusion of homosexuals from the United States military to police harassment to the treatment of homosexuals in revolutionary Cuba. The early actions have been credited with preparing the gay community for Stonewall and contributing to the riots' symbolic power.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, Payá {{founded the}} Christian <b>Liberation</b> <b>Movement</b> (MCL), {{which called for}} nonviolent civil disobedience against {{the rule of the}} Cuban Communist Party.

He also began a magazine for Catholics titled People of God (Pueblo de Dios), calling for Christians to lead the struggle for human rights. However, the magazine was shut down the following year by Cuba's bishops under government pressure.

A Roman Catholic, {{he founded}} the Christian <b>Liberation</b> <b>Movement</b> in 1987 to oppose the one-party rule of the Cuban Communist Party. He attracted international attention for organizing a petition drive known as the Varela Project, in which 25,000 signatories petitioned the Cuban government to guarantee {{freedom of speech and}} freedom of assembly as well as to institute a multi-party democracy. In recognition of his work, he received the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize and People in Need's Homo Homini Award.|$|E
5|$|The F-FDTL {{was formed}} from the {{national}} <b>liberation</b> <b>movement</b> guerrilla army known as FALINTIL (Portuguese acronym for Forças Armadas de Libertação de Timor-Leste or Armed Forces for the Liberation of East Timor). During the period before 1999 some East Timorese leaders, including the current President José Ramos-Horta, proposed that a future East Timorese state {{would not have a}} military. The widespread violence and destruction that followed the independence referendum in 1999 and the need to provide employment to FALINTIL veterans led to a change in policy, however. Following the end of Indonesian rule, FALINTIL proposed the establishment of a large military of about 5,000 personnel.|$|E
5|$|The Homosexual Matrix was {{controversial}} and received many negative reviews. It {{was criticized for}} Tripp's alleged bias in favor of homosexuality, dismissive treatment of psychoanalytic theories, rambling style, sexism, focus on male homosexuality and neglect of lesbianism, and failure to discuss the gay <b>liberation</b> <b>movement.</b> The book drew a negative reaction from psychoanalysts, including an ethics complaint against Tripp with the American Psychological Association. Tripp himself believed that it had received a negative reaction from the gay media and from some gay people. Nevertheless, it was influential and has received praise as an important work on homosexuality. Commentators have supported Tripp's view that erotic feeling depends on resistance to its satisfaction.|$|E

5|$|The Society for Human Rights was an American LGBT Rights {{organization}} {{established in}} Chicago in 1924. Society founder Henry Gerber {{was inspired to}} create it by German Doctor Magnus Hirschfeld and his work with the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee. It was the first recognized gay rights organization in the United States, having received a charter {{from the state of}} Illinois, and produced the first American publication for homosexuals, Friendship and Freedom. A few months after being chartered, the group ceased to exist {{in the wake of the}} arrest of several of the Society's members. Despite its short existence and small size, the Society has been recognized as a precursor to the modern gay <b>liberation</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1860s, Levski {{developed}} a revolutionary theory that saw the Bulgarian <b>liberation</b> <b>movement</b> as an armed uprising of all Bulgarians in the Ottoman Empire. The insurrection was to be prepared, controlled and coordinated internally by a central revolutionary organisation, which was to include local revolutionary committees in all parts of Bulgaria and operate independently from any foreign factors. Levski's theory resulted from the repeated failures to implement Rakovski's ideas effectively, {{such as the use of}} foreign-based armed detachments (чети, cheti) to provoke a general revolt. Levski's idea of an entirely independent revolution did not enjoy the approval of the entire population either—in fact, he was the only prominent Bulgarian revolutionary to advocate it. Instead, many regarded an intervention by the great powers as a more feasible solution.|$|E
5|$|One {{member of}} the Temple was the New Zealander Kerry Bolton, who split to form his own Order of the Left Hand Path in 1990. In 1995, another couple who joined were LaVey's {{daughter}} Zeena Schreck and her husband Nikolas Schreck, {{both of whom were}} vocal critics of Zeena's father. In 1996, Don Webb became the high priest of the Temple, a position that he held until 2002. He was replaced by Zeena Schreck, but she resigned after six weeks and was replaced by Aquino, who took charge once more. In that year, Zeena led a schism within the organisation, establishing her own Berlin-based group, The Storm, which she later renamed the Sethian <b>Liberation</b> <b>Movement.</b> Aquino stood down as Supreme Priest again in 2004, to be replaced by Patricia Hardy, who was elected to the position of Supreme Priestess. Although no longer in charge of the organisation, he nevertheless remained its most visible spokesperson.|$|E

5|$|Several major {{figures in}} the Armenian {{national}} <b>liberation</b> <b>movement</b> of the early 20th century lived and/or died in the US. Among them were Andranik Ozanian, a military commander who is considered a national hero among Armenians, who lived in Fresno, California from 1922 and died in California in 1927. Another notable military commander, Garegin Nzhdeh, lived in Boston, Massachusetts from 1933 to 1937, where he founded the Armenian Youth Federation. Drastamat Kanayan (Dro), the Defense Minister of Armenia from 1918 to 1919, lived in America after World War II and was shortly arrested for collaborating with the Nazis. His funeral ceremony was held in Trinity Church in the City of Boston in 1956. Shahan Natalie, a Dashnak activist, organized the Operation Nemesis in the early 1920s, during which numerous Armenian Genocide perpetrators were murdered. From 1910 to 1912 he studied at the Boston University and died in Watertown, Massachusetts in 1983.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of an}} {{independent}} and united Armenia was the main goal of the Armenian national <b>liberation</b> <b>movement</b> during {{the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth centuries. By the 1890s, a low-intensity armed conflict developed between the three major Armenian parties—the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnak), Hnchak and Armenakan— and the Ottoman government. Calls from the great powers for reforms in the Armenian provinces and Armenian aspirations of independence resulted in the Hamidian massacres between 1894 and 1896, during which up to 300,000 Armenian civilians were slaughtered by the order of Sultan Abdul Hamid II, after whom the massacres were named. After the 1908 Young Turk Revolution, some Armenians felt that the situation would improve; however, a year later the Adana massacre took place and Turkish-Armenian relations deteriorated further. After the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913, the Ottoman government was pushed to accept the reforms in the Armenian provinces in early 1914.|$|E
5|$|The {{perpetrators}} conducted nighttime raids, assaulting {{women in}} their villages, often {{in front of their}} families, as part of the terror campaign. Victims aged 8 to 75 were also kidnapped and held in special camps where they were repeatedly assaulted. Many of those held in the camps were murdered or committed suicide, with some taking their own lives by using their hair to hang themselves; the soldiers responded to these suicides by cutting the women's hair off. Time magazine reported on 563 girls who had been kidnapped and held by the military; all of them were between three and five months pregnant when the military began to release them. Some women were forcibly used as prostitutes. While the Pakistani government estimated the number of rapes in the hundreds, other estimates range between 200,000 and 400,000. The Pakistani government had tried to censor reports coming out of the region, but media reports on the atrocities did reach the public worldwide, and gave rise to widespread international public support for the <b>liberation</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|E
