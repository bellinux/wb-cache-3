By imaging a soundscape for the reader through his pen, by animating the scene at hand through the written word, Wilkie Collins becomes a metaphorical painter. Hide and Seek’s performance of what I call the “textual spectacle,” in which language may uncover, screen, or “play” with its form and substance, might provide us with an appropriate critical lens for examining these visual and aural structures. Collins’s modality of writing is figured as ekphrasis—the speaking picture, which not only paints the scene, but also paradoxically “mutes” the “unspeakable” sound as that {{which can only be}} contained and dissolved in the word. The <b>lacunae</b> <b>left</b> by these silences is a positive absence of sound, a metonymy that appropriately “names” and assigns space for deaf discourse...|$|E
40|$|Since 1945, {{international}} criminal justice has been one continuous construction site, {{an expression of the}} attitude of international stakeholders and policy makers that favours temporary solutions to contemporary problems. Even with the creation of the ICC that has not really changed. The history of {{international criminal}} procedure until the advent of the ICC has substantially been one of cobbling together building blocks from different traditions {{in order to create a}} new sui generis system based on extrapolations from Article 38 (1) of the Statute of the ICJ and the history of Nuremberg, Tokyo, and the other post-war military tribunals. This eclectic approach has unfortunately been combined with a plethora of regulatory <b>lacunae</b> <b>left</b> to the judges of the tribunals by the international (for want of a better word:) law-making bodies, a criticism that applies to the ICC as well, albeit clearly to a lesser degree. The ‘sui generis’ system seems nonetheless to have had mainly adversarial overtones. 1 Even in cases where the statute of a tribunal, such as the Special Tribunal for Lebanon (STL), provides for the adaptation of a civil law model, 2 the court’s judges in their rule-making power have, as will be shown below, blindsided the drafters of the Statute and introduced a way for the court to revert to what is in essence an adversarial model. Interesting as the developments in international criminal law may appear if viewed as a ‘legal laboratory’, the fact remains that courts, which deal with putting people away for many years for horrendous crimes, must first of all strive for legal certainty. This paper will argue that the current unprincipled state of affairs is unsatisfactory, and that a move to a system is necessary which protects the defence and keeps the prosecution in check by, among other things, ensuring sanctions for premature assurances 3 of trial-readiness—an issue brought into sharp relief at the STL in the controversy about joining the case of a fifth accused at the 11 th hour to that of the four first accused when the trial was weeks away, when their case had been developing for far over a year and the identity of the fifth accused had been known all along as well...|$|E

40|$|It {{is common}} {{knowledge}} that in Japanese subjects can frequently be ellipted. This is the reason there is often no need for an overt term referring, for example, to {{the first or second}} person. Studies of ellipsis in Japanese abound, but the natural extension of such inquiries, namely, those aimed at answering the question "What do terms that are generally ellipted accomplish when they are present?" are fewer in number. The present study is intended to fill in some of the <b>lacunae</b> <b>left</b> by earlier research dealing with Japanese person-designating terms. Its focus is on general problems related to the occurrence of overt first and second person-designating terms in Japanese conversational discourse. The term "first and second person-designating terms" is used to refer to the words speakers employ to refer to themselves (first person) and to their addressees (second person) in discourse. The purpose of my study is two-fold. First, I investigate the kind of pragmatic functions these terms have in Japanese discourse. Second, strategic functions of first and second person terms as markers of frame and footing shifts are examined. In this case the main focus is on expressive shifts from unmarked or habitual use to a marked form. Data for my study were gathered mainly from Japanese movies (five in total), and analyzed {{with the help of a}} native speaker. Because of the visual character of films, I was also able to make use of nonverbal communication in my analysis. Analyzed terms comprise proper names, titles, kinship terms, status terms, (so-called) personal pronouns, and so forth. The approach I apply is micro- or interactional in its orientation and focuses on the function of given linguistic items in conversational discourse. The methodology is derived mainly from pragmatics, interactional analysis, frame analysis and the study of linguistic politeness, and it emphasizes the fact that linguistic forms should always be analyzed in a specific context. It is involved with the discovery and description of the various methods, alms and strategies that speakers have in their disposition to engage in conversation. Challenging the more "traditional" sociolinguistic view, I make the claim that the use of first and second person-designating terms is regulated not only by static social factors (e. g., age, social status), but also by moment-by-moment goals of the interactants. In the theoretical part of my dissertation, I first introduce a number of studies carried out in related fields of linguistic research. This overview is divided into two sections, the first concentrating on previous studies dealing mainly with Western languages, and the second on studies examining Japanese. In the chapters that follow, I present the sources, data and methodology applied in the analysis. Certain theoretical aspects, such as the concept of 2 ̆ 7 markedness 2 ̆ 7 and person-deixis, are included in the methodological discussion. I further address a number of general problems related to person-designating terms in Japanese. I point out that, in general, linguists tend to be extremely vague when dealing with these terms. In addition, the following concepts and issues are discussed with a number of illustrating examples: 2 ̆ 7 person 2 ̆ 7 in Japanese, uchi/soto (2 ̆ 7 in-group / out-group 2 ̆ 7), group /individual indexicality 2 ̆ 7, 2 ̆ 7 intergroup /intragroup communication 2 ̆ 7, linguistic politeness, and ellipsis of person-designating terms. I also show that it is important to make a distinction between so-called bound forms and free forms of person-designating terms. However, as is demonstrated, this dichotomy cannot be applied to Japanese without difficulties. An "intermediate" category of terms without the topic marker (wa) needs to be discussed separately. The second main part of the study, its analytic section, comprehends four chapters discussing (1) bound forms of first and second person terms, (2) "intermediate" first and second person terms without the topic marker wa, (3) free forms of second person terms (vocatives) and their pragmatic functions, and (4) first and second person term changes as markers of shifts in frame (and footing). First, I concentrate on person-designating terms which are generally required for sentence construction (e. g., Sensee no hon desu ha?). Following the definition suggested by Braun (1988 : 11) in the field of address form research, syntactically bound forms are considered to be integrated parts of sentences, whereas syntactically free forms generally occur "outside" the sentence construction (preceding/succeeding the sentence/inserted into the sentence). A closer examination of the category of syntactically bound forms reveals that although it has been generally advanced that (so-called) personal pronouns do not differ syntactically or functionally from nouns in Japanese and therefore should not be considered as a separate category, there are some distributional differences. When separated from "wa-less" forms and free forms, bound forms seem to be selected from a more restricted array of person-designating terms. The difference is particularly remarkable in the second person. This is no doubt due to the fact that a speaker who is in a position to use both personal pronouns and nouns in second person reference (usually a social superior or equal) generally opts for the former in the case of bound forms and for the latter in the case of free forms (vocatices) (cf. Wada-san ittai anata wa kono hatsukakan, dare no tame ni mokuhiken o tsukatte orareru n desu ?). Second, "intermediate" terms (e. g., Michiko-chan[,] iku no?), oscillating between bound forms and free forms, are discussed in connection with politeness, male and female speech, and pragmatic functions. Because of the existence of this group, Braun 2 ̆ 7 s (1988) notions of syntactically bound forms (first and second person in this study) and syntactically free forms (second person) can be applied to the categorization of the analyzed terms only partially. It is demonstrated that from a pragmatic point of view this dichotomy is not sufficient to account for,Japanese spoken discourse, which displays also an "intermediate" category of "wa-less" first and second person terms having both "bound form-like" and "free form-like" characteristics. Third, free forms (of address) (e. g., Tanaka-kun, ima nanji?) and their pragmatic functions are analyzed with the help of a modified version of a typology of vocative functions set up for Spanish by Haverkate (1984) and analyzing methods employed in politeness theory. Following Haverkate, I divide the functions Japanese vocatives have in conversational interaction into four groups: (1) attention-getting devices (with various subcategories), (2) substitutes for specific illocutionary-function-indicating devices (with various subcategories), (3) allocutionary devices to bring about particular perlocutionary effects, and (4) (obligatory) honorific forms of address. An interesting finding is related to the location of overt first and second person-designation terms in utterances. While the majority of these terms occur sentence-initially, which could perhaps be called the unmarked position, at least some sentence-middle and sentence-final (postposed) terms seem to be linked to specific expression types. For example ("wa-less") postposed second person terms are often characteristic of evaluative sentences or reproaches, and sentence-middle free forms (vocatives) can be associated with an emphasis function. While linguists have generally tended to concentrate either on the analysis of formal properties of discourse elements without reference to pragmatic or communicative functions that might be involved, or on the examination of pragmatic or communicative functions without reference to formal properties, the aforementioned examples suggest that combining both aspects might actually be a more profitable approach. Some formal properties, such as the position of person-designating terms, may, in fact, be linked to specific pragmatic functions. Fourth, I show that the Japanese do not always conform to their nearly automatic wakimae (discernment), but that strategic uses of person-designation also exist. In this analysis, I employ the method of frame analysis and divide frame shifts into three subcategories: (1) frame-internal shifts, (2) frame-external shifts, and (3) "overall" (social) frame shifts. Mismatch of frames is also discussed with an illustrating example. Since the concepts of frame (and footing) seem to be partially overlapping with the vocative category of allocutionary devices to bring about particular perlocutionary effects suggested by Haverkate, I propose that it might actually be easier to comprehend the functioning of terms belonging to this category within the framework of interactive frames. The notion of 2 ̆ 7 frame 2 ̆ 7 refers to a definition of what is occurring in interaction; without it interpretation of utterances would be impossible. When analyzing shifts of person terms, in addition to the existing social relationship between the interactants, one must also take into account the frame(s) of the situation. At first it is necessary to examine what kind of first and second person-designating terms the characters depicted in the films usually employ with other characters. If there is a shift to an unusual (marked) term-and it cannot be explained by sociolinguistic factors such as formality of the situation, for example-the shift may then be analyzed as a marker of frame (and footing) shift. In order to comprehend a given utterance, the interlocutor (and the speaker) must know within which frame it is intended. An unusual person-designating term may therefore have the function of a signal: perhaps the speaker wishes to warn his/her interlocutor that the message following the unusual term should be interpreted outside the situational frame, for example as a joke. It is concluded that researchers have paid little attention to overt first and second person terms occurring in Japanese spoken discourse. It is naturally important to point out that, in many contexts, these terms are by no means obligatory. However, as demonstrated by the analysis of my data, it is also important to consider the roles these terms play in certain types of conversational interaction, such as common casual face-to-face conversation. Instead of overemphasising the fact that uchi/solo boundaries are constantly shifting in Japanese spoken discourse, it should not be forgotten that depending on the context, there is also continuous shifting of boundaries between group and individual indexicality. It would seem that, while group indexicality can often be associated to formal speech and the public sphere, individual indexicality relates to more informal speech styles and the private domain, allowing more "creative" ways of expression than what is generally permitted by "rules" of wakimae. This constatation, in turn, provides an attractive link to theories of politeness. Although Japanese, with its wide variety of polite expressions, is generally considered to be a language displaying characteristics of negative politeness, among in-group members, by contrast, there is a preference toward positive politeness. Positive politeness is evidenced in casual conversation, for example, in numerous uses of particles and filters, and to this it can be added that also frequent direct reference to the second (and first) person can be interpreted as having the function of displaying the kind of "friendly directness" associated with positive politeness. These kinds of terms often appear without the topic marker wa. Since the starting point of my study was the occurrence of overt first and second person terms in general, several quite diverse methods had to be applied and a multitude of areas explored in order to be able to sketch the picture that emerged. Admittedly, this kind of approach can be characterized as rather unconventional in the field of linguistics, but it also has its merits. As the division of linguistic research into various fields has led to the fragmentation of linguistic phenomena as well, rather than trying to form a coherent view of more general phenomena, linguists tend to stick to their "own field", neglecting the ideas, methods and results other (linguistic) disciplines could offer. However, as demonstrated in this study, one field is often not enough if one wants to understand even such "simple" discourse elements as person-designating terms...|$|E

Larkin countered the void created by his agnosticism by appealing to the power both of ritual and of the English landscape, and yet ultimately these attempts - although not wholly unsuccessful poetically - appear fruitless philosophically. Larkin's awareness of English society is not explicit, and yet his preoccupation with death and nothingness is inexorably linked to the political despair and religious questioning of post-war England.

This dissertation will demonstrate how Larkin's use of cliche epitomises this struggle, and that in his poetry the often-assumed emptiness of such language is turned on its head.

I make use of a range of sources, including archived primary materials and documented memoirs of participants, contemporary media reports, academic research and interviews with Trotskyist activists. An examination of the theory and development of the united front is undertaken, followed by an evaluation of its practical implementation, through consideration of a number of case studies from different periods in the twentieth century. These are, firstly, the short-lived Hotchkiss strike committee, established during the 1936 Popular Front period. Secondly, I evaluate two examples from the immediate post-war period, the Caudron factory workers’ council between 1944 and 1948, and the strike committee established during the Renault factory strike of 1947. Thirdly, I consider the united fronts, in the form of workers’ coordinations, during the period between 1986 and 1995. I draw out and highlight common features between the united fronts, and assess whether or not the tactic made an effective contribution to the winning of industrial disputes by workers and whether, in the process, it enabled Trotskyist activists to generate a receptive audience for their wider political and social ideas. Finally, I consider whether the building of united fronts continues to be a realistic, relevant, practical tactic for Trotskyists in the French trade unions, and one which assists them to effectively pursue their stated longer-term goal of a revolutionary transformation of society...|$|R
40|$|In 2010, the Mariposa Folk Festival {{celebrated its}} fiftieth anniversary. Founded in 1961, it later {{served as a}} model for future folk festivals in Canada, such as those in Winnipeg, Vancouver, and Edmonton. In {{addition}} to their financial success, many of these "offspring" events are known for promoting the work of domestic musicians as well as bringing a wide variety of international artists and audiences to Canada every summer. As a fifty-plus-year-old event, the MFF has lived through more shifts in industry trends, government policy, administrative personnel, and locale, than other festivals of its kind. Yet despite Mariposa's longevity, most written accounts (Usher and Page-Harpa 1977, Melbourne 2010, Mariposa: Celebrating Canadian Folk Music 2010, Bidini 2011) tend to emphasize its "heyday" years of the 1960 s and 1970 s. Furthermore, within their coverage of that time frame, these accounts do not attend to the long-term influence that the period's artistic programming had on the Canadian music scene. My research findings suggest a more nuanced perspective on the MFF's fifty-year history. This perspective encompasses its artistic and administrative developments from 1980 to the present, as well as a more detailed view of the long-term impact of its "heyday" years. This dissertation redresses the <b>lacuna</b> <b>left</b> by existing narratives about the Mariposa Folk Festival. After a detailed retelling of the MFF's musical and administrative history, I examine four facets of the event's significance that have been misunderstood, misrepresented, or simply left out by previous accounts. These are: 1) its artistic legacy (especially pertaining to its programming of Canadian content, 11 workshops/daytime concerts, ethnically-diverse musics, children's music, and a crafts area); 2) its relationship to social shifts of the 1960 s and 1970 s; 3) its contribution to our understanding of space, place and landscape; and 4) its contribution to our understanding of arts funding and sponsorship in Canada. In doing so I argue that the Mariposa Folk Festival is categorically different than other Canadian folk festivals, occupying a unique historical position in the context of similar events. These four aspects of its significance substantiate this argument...|$|R

It seeks to fill a <b>lacuna</b> <b>left</b> by the concentration of monographs on the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, suggesting that we know less about the history of sugar than we thought we did. Perhaps in no other single place is such a range of information on so wide an area presented in such detail for so early a period. Ranging from Iberia to the Caribbean and including consumption as well as production of sugar, with a nod to the slave trade and a very useful note on weights and currencies, this volume is a gold mine of information. It considers (briefly) the theoretical meaning as well as the growing of this important crop, contrasting its production in Iberia with that on the Atlantic islands of Madeira and the Canaries, colonized by Iberian powers, and continuing the contrast with São Tomé, off the coast of Africa, and on to Brazil and the Spanish American empire before ending with the British in Barbados. In the transit, it of necessity considers and complicates the meaning of “sugar revolution” and shows how scholars using that term do not always mean the same thing. John McCusker and Russell Menard, for example, tackling a cornerstone of the traditional interpretation of the development of sugar, argue that there was no “sugar revolution” in Barbados; economic change had already begun before sugar’s advent, though sugar may have accelerated it, and yet sugar production was transformed on the island. They also undercut, without quite denying, the significance of the Dutch role in the process. Schwartz, while questioning, lings to the traditional expression if not the traditional outlook, seeing in Barbados “the beginning of the sugar revolution” (p. 10) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} {{of education to}} human beings {{has been one of}} the highly emphasized issues in international documents. Education is a Human Right that should be accorded to human beings solely by reason of being human. There are a lot of International human rights instruments that provide for education as a fundamental human right. These include the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights (1966) among others. Nigeria is well aware of the commitments laid down by these international instruments and has taken steps to either sign, accede or ratify these instrument to show its commitment to adhering to the contents laid down in these instruments. This mini-dissertation focuses on the provision of basic education in Nigeria. It examines the contents of various international documents to which Nigeria is party and looks into the role Nigeria should play in providing education. In other words the extent of state parties obligation to provide education to their citizens. As commendable as these programmes and policies may be towards providing basic education, some social vices hinder the successful implementation of these programmes there by resulting in the inadequate provision quality basic education in Nigeria. Most importantly this mini-dissertation takes into consideration the extent of Nigeria’s commitments to the obligation to respect, protect and fulfill the right to education stated in the general comment No. 13 on the right to education stated in article 13 of the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights. It takes into account, the extent to which Nigeria has adhered to the provision of article 13 of the ICESCR. The laws in Nigeria have also been found wanting with regard to international instruments which state the fact that education is a right which should be justiciable in various courts of law and not just a directive principle of state policy which is not justiciable. This mini-dissertation criticizes this notion of directive principle of State policy in the Nigerian Constitution and proffers some legal and non legal recommendations which can enable the Federal Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria provide better quality education throughout the country. Finally, the private sector in Nigeria is examined as it also thrives to provide private schools as a multidisciplinary measure to fill in the <b>lacunas</b> <b>left</b> by the Nigerian Government in the area of providing basic education to the typical Nigerian who wants to acquire basic educational knowledge.

40|$|Knowledge {{organization}} (KO) {{research is}} a field of scholarship concerned with the design, study and critique of the processes of organizing and representing documents that societies see as worthy of preserving (Tennis, 2008). In this context we {{are concerned with the}} relationship between language and action. On the one hand, we are concerned with what language can and does do for our knowledge organization systems (KOS). For example, how do the words NEGRO or INDIAN work in historical and contemporary indexing languages? In relation to this, we are also concerned with how we know about knowledge organization (KO) and its languages. On the other hand, we are concerned with how to act given this knowledge. That is, how do we carry out research and how do we design, implement, and evaluate KO systems?It is important to consider these questions in the context of our work because we are delegated by society to disseminate cultural memory. We are endowed with a perspective, prepared by an education, and granted positions whereby society asks us to ensure that documentary material is accessible to future generations. There is a social value in our work, and as such there is a social imperative to our work. We must act with good conscience, and use language judiciously, for the memory of the world is a heavy burden. In this paper, I explore these two weights of language and action that bear down on KO researchers. I first summarize what extant literature says about the knowledge claims we make with regard to KO practices and systems. To make it clear what it is that I think we know, I create a schematic that will link claims (language) to actions in advising, implementing, or evaluating information practices and systems. I will then contrast this with what we do not know, that is, what the unanswered questions might be (Gnoli, 2008; Dahlberg, 2011), and I will discuss them in relation to the two weights in our field of KO. Further, I will try to provide a systematic overview of possible ways to address these open questions in KO research. I will draw on the concept of elenchus - the forms of epistemology, theory, and methodology in KO (Tennis, 2008), and framework analysis which are structures, work practice, and discourses of KO systems (Tennis, 2006). In so doing, I will argue for a Neopragmatic stance on the weight of language and action in KO (Rorty, 1982; 2000). I will close by addressing the <b>lacuna</b> <b>left</b> in Neopragmatic thought – the ethical imperative to use language and action in a particular good and moral way. That is, I will address the ethical imperative of KO given its weights, epistemologies, theories, and methods. To do this, I will review a sample of relevant work on deontology in both western and eastern philosophical schools (e. g., Harvey, 1995). The perspective I want to communicate in this section is that the good in carrying out KO research may begin with epistemic stances (cf., language), but ultimately stands on ethical actions. I will present an analysis describing the micro and the macro ethical concerns in relation to KO research and its advice on practice. I hope this demonstrates that the direction of epistemology, theory, and methodology in KO, while burdened with the dual weights of language and action, is clear when provided an ethical sounding board. We know how to proceed when we understand how our work can benefit the world. KO is an important, if not always understood, division of labor in a society that values its documentary heritage and memory institutions. Being able to do good requires us to understand how to balance the weights of language and action. We must understand where we stand and be able to chart a path forward, one that does not cause harm, but adds value to the world and those that want to access recorded knowledge...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} the role of bone lining cells in the coordination of bone resorption and formation. Ultrastructural analysis of mouse long bones and calvariae revealed that bone lining cells enwrap and subsequently digest collagen fibrils protruding from Howship's <b>lacunae</b> that are <b>left</b> by osteoclasts. By using selective proteinase inhibitors we show that this digestion depends on matrix metalloproteinases and, to some extent, on serine proteinases. Autoradiography revealed that after the bone lining cells have finished cleaning, they deposit {{a thin layer of}} a collagenous matrix along the Howship's lacuna, in close association with an osteopontin-rich cement line. Collagenous matrix deposition was detected only in completely cleaned pits. In bone from pycnodysostotic patients and cathepsin K-deficient mice, conditions in which osteoclastic bone matrix digestion is greatly inhibited, bone matrix leftovers proved to be degraded by bone lining cells, thus indicating that the bone lining cell "rescues" bone remodeling in these anomalies. We conclude that removal of bone collagen left by osteoclasts in Howship's lacunae is an obligatory step in the link between bone resorption and formation, and that bone lining cells and matrix metalloproteinases are essential in this proces...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{histories}} of archaeology have <b>left</b> <b>lacunae</b> in understanding {{of both the}} discipline and elements within it. Using the Royal Archaeological Institute and its product, the Archaeological Journal, as a pattern site for research the archaeological paradigm is applied to history rather than vice-versa. After a short explanation of method the published membership of the Institute between 1845 and 1942 is analysed in terms of geographical distribution, social composition and occupational interest. In the process the dynamics of a will to discourse are revealed {{in conjunction with the}} areas of discourse which were problematic. The text of the Journal (1843 - 1914) is then analysed on the basis of format, citations, terminology, tropes and objects of discussion in order to identify any 'statements', in the Foucauldian sense, which constitute the objects of discourse. Three major phases emerge. These are characterised at one level by similarities and differences in social and cognitive topography. At another level the conditions of existence and emergence revealed in the study suggest that archaeology itself is a characteristic of the Modem episteme, intimately linked in its successive modes of exploration and interpretation of the past with the Enlightenment project and the nation state...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Myocardial {{connective}} tissue probably provides passive support for regulating heart tensile strength and stiffness and ultimately for controlling heart mechanics through its endomysial part. However, endomysial collagen micro-arrangement {{is still a}} matter of debate. In order to define the fine distribution of left ventricle endomysial collagen, we applied the NaOH-scanning electron microscopy (SEM) maceration method (one of the techniques of choice for studying collagen micro-arrangement) to rabbit heart. Gomori-reticulum staining was used for correlated light microscopy (LM) observations. The SEM-NaOH method allowed isolation of collagen by removing other extracellular matrix components and cells and preserved collagen structure and position. Endomysial collagen appeared arranged in laminae that delimited the <b>lacunae</b> that were <b>left</b> empty by macerated myocytes and small vessels (mostly capillaries). These laminae were formed by reticular fibers, as confirmed by LM observations of Gomorireticulum-stained samples, and were organized in irregularly meshed networks made of thin (single) and thick (composed) filaments. In longitudinal views, collagen laminae extended {{the entire length of}} lacunae. In transversal views, the cut surface of the laminae appeared to be made of collagen bundles. These observations provide an updated microanatomical view of endomysial collagen distribution, which integrates previous studies. This model is based on the evidence that collagen laminae enveloped the surface of small vessels and myocytes. Thus, a type of myocyte-myocyte or capillary-myocyte "laminar connection" anchored to the entire cell length here is emphasized, rather than a type of "strut connection" anchored to defined loci, as usually described. This structure explains better how endomysium may provide the necessary support for heart compliance and protection against overstretch...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} discusses Anna Banti 2 ̆ 7 s Artemisia, Roberto Rossellini 2 ̆ 7 s Paisà, Ingeborg Bachmann {{short story}} “Simultan,” Helma Sanders-Brahms 2 ̆ 7 Deutschland, bleiche Mutter and Alain Resnais 2 ̆ 7 Hiroshima mon amour. The novels and films addressed all create {{a condition of}} epistemological crisis; they present the spectator or reader with a landscape of rubble, both literal and figurative, in which all existing structures have been erased. There are no stable epistemological certainties left, only provisional configurations that are always threatening to collapse once more into the debris, history is defined by slippage and displacement. Bachmann and Resnais, in particular, explore the trace and echo of “history,” and the rupture of temporal stability; for them, history shares the structure of language, ruled by metonymy and slippage, always exceeding any stable framework. These self-referentially split and fractured narratives present us with a universe in which everything is in flux. If “history” is “broken” by definition, so too are subjectivity, gender and desire: rupture and splitting are their constitutive elements. In Rossellini 2 ̆ 7 s films, especially, heterosexual masculinity has lost any claim to “authenticity” and has become purely performative, a phantasm of opera, theater, film, even puppet shows. The male subject is constituted both as spectacle and obsessive spectator, with voyeurism and scopophlia the only possible forms of desire. The <b>lacuna</b> of desire <b>left</b> {{by the collapse of}} the heterosexual male subject is partly filled by the scopophilic appetites of the cinematic spectator: we see ourselves, and our own deviant desire, constantly represented on screen. ...|$|R

The syndrome is characterized by aniridia, secondary cataracts, microcephaly with mental retardation, a folding-over of the pinna, and anomalies of the urinary tract with Wilm's tumour. We report a case of Wilm's-aniridia syndrome where development of the tumour was preceded by development and recovery from transient hypo-y-globulinaemia of infancy.

The mother's brother had had a bad chest until the age of 7 years, but there was no family history of eye trouble, tendency to infection, or malignant disease. At birth he would not open his eyes, and later the mother noticed that the eyes had no colour. Bilateral aniridia was diagnosed at the age of 9 weeks {{and at the same time}} two large <b>lacunae</b> of the <b>left</b> occipitoparietal region and a large anterior fontanelle were noted. The top of the pinnae were folded over. Later he developed bilateral buphthalmos, glaucoma, and lens opacities. At 9 weeks he developed croup. Subsequently he required repeated anaesthetics for the management of the eye condition, and several of these were complicated by postoperative chest symptoms with an asthmatic element. For this reason it was necessary to postpone the operation on several occasions. Investigations showed deficiency of serum IgG (Table). At 5 months of age he had eczema of the face and neck, and a napkin rash. On a milk-free diet the skin manifestations cleared and there was no recurrence of the wheeziness for several months.

Tijekom istraživanja provedenog za potrebe ovoga rada ustanovljeno je da jedno od pisama dosada nije bilo poznato. Mihovilov sustav znakova uspjeli smo dešifrirati usporedbom učestalosti znakova u kodiranim odlomcima s učestalošću slova u latinskim dijelovima pisama. Većina je slova preuzeta iz latinice, samo im je promijenjena vrijednost, pri čemu je imala utjecaja, čini se, knjiga Polygraphia onodobnoga njemačkog kriptografa Ioannesa Trithemiusa. Usto je dodano nekoliko arapskih znamenki i znakova iz drugih pisama. Glavnina skrivena sadržaja odnosi se na ulaganja u nekretnine i unosne poslove, te je svrha tajnog pisma očigledno bila onemogućiti konkurenciju da preduhitri Antuna i Mihovila, u trenutku kad je Antun bio nagrađen od cara Ferdinanda nakon četverogodišnjeg poslanstva u Turskoj. U dvjema pak porukama Mihovil upozorava brata na opasnost od dvojice braće s vrlo lošom moralnom reputacijom. Antunov odlomak ostao je neriješen, jer se poslužio drugačijim sustavom, a sam tekst je prekratak, tako da izračun frekvencije ne pomaže. Spending {{the whole}} of his working career in Hungary, Antun Vrančić (1504 ¬ 1573) climbed to {{the very top of}} the ecclesiastical and {{political}} ladder. For the sake of his office, but still more so in consequence of his humanist education and beliefs, as well as family affections, he was constantly in touch by letter with a wide circle of people. Today about eight hundred of his letters are known. The whole of this time, the person and associate closest to him was his younger brother Mihovil (1507 - 1571), also a humanist and writer. The epistolary communication between the two spanned more than thirty years. Writing to his brother from Paris, where in 1546 he was envoy of the Queen of Transylvania, Isabella, Antun inserted not quite two lines of coded writing, in a paragraph where he is talking about being well received at the court of France, and hoping to complete his assignment soon. What this success was to consist of, he did not write in Latin script, but in a mixture of characters. Information concerning this appeared before the scholarly public some ten years ago, in an article about the unpublished Vrančić family papers kept in the National and University Library in Zagreb. Mihovil also coded several fragments in four of his letters sent at the end of 1558 and the beginning of 1559 from Šibenik to his brother in Hungary. Information about three of them is found in three editorial notes (in Hungarian) alongside the letters of Mihovil published in the mid- 19 th century in the collected works of Antun Vrančić (Verancsics Antal Ősszes munkái) as part of the series Monumenta Hungariae Historica of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. In the actual text of the letters, <b>lacunae</b> were <b>left</b> in the places of the coded messages. The fourth letter was unknown to the editors. That is what we realised when we obtained from Budapest photographs of the autographs, on which it too was to be found. When it appeared that the secret script was not a simple replacement of the Latin alphabet with Bosančica, or Croatian Cyrillic, it was necessary to approach the decoding more systematically. We first selected Mihovil’s messages, as being incomparably longer and providing more to analyse. Three factors were essential. First character frequency scales were made: in the coded text, in the Latin part of the letters, and in an extant prayer of Antun Vrančić in Croatian. It turned out that the coded and Latin parts were close to each other, and at the same time distant from the Croatian text. It was fairly certain that Latin was hidden in the secret messages. The final confirmation came when we became aware of the fact that in the Latin there was a (semi-) obligatory combination of the characters q and u, where the first regularly appeared with the second, but the second also appeared on its own. We discovered that in the coded part of the text a similar (semi-) obligation existed. The last factor that led to the code being broken was the comparison of the frequency of geminates in the coded and in the Latin text. On the basis of the assumed probable letter values, we were able to read the first word – possessio. It contains two identical geminates, which also made the identification easy. The rest went relatively easily and quickly. The basic stock of characters is taken from Latin script, only shifted to the left or right more or fewer places. Some Latin symbols are replaced with Arabic figures, and a negligible number probably come from the Greek and Bosančica scripts. The biggest influence there might be is visible in the fact that the Latin letter values of almost a third of Mihovil’s signs coincide with the values in the book Libri polygraphiae VI of the German cryptographer Ioannes Trithemius. Most of the concealed content relates to investment in real estate and profitable business deals. Mihovil is on the whole informing his brother about good deals to be had on the land and housing market in Šibenik and surroundings, and of his negotiations with the vendors. The objective of the secret script was clearlyto stop the competition forestalling the entrepreneurial brothers, at the time when Antun had been rewarded by Emperor Ferdinand with the office of bishop of Eger after his four-year period as envoy in Turkey, after which his income must have risen considerably. In two messages Mihovil warned his brother of the danger of two other brothers with very poor reputations for morality. To our surprise, Mihovil’s system did not assist us in deciphering those two lines in code of Antun’s. Clearly the system had changed in the meantime, or each one of brothers had his own. The text itself is too short for the calculation of frequency to help. Accordingly, this mysterious fragment about the expected success at the French court remains unsolved...|$|R
