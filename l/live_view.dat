5|$|Photographing {{an eclipse}} is {{possible}} with fairly common camera equipment. In {{order for the}} disk of the Sun/Moon to be easily visible, a fairly high magnification long focus lens is needed (at least 200mm for a 35mm camera), and for the disk to fill most of the frame, a longer lens is needed (over 500mm). As with viewing the Sun directly, looking at it through the optical viewfinder of a camera can produce damage to the retina, so care is recommended. Solar filters are required for digital photography even if an optical viewfinder is not used. Using a camera's <b>live</b> <b>view</b> feature or an electronic viewfinder is safe for the human eye, but the Sun's rays could potentially irreparably damage digital image sensors unless the lens is covered by a properly designed solar filter.|$|E
25|$|Sony has {{modified}} the DSLR formula {{in favor of}} single-lens translucent (SLT) cameras, which are still technically DSLRs, but feature a fixed mirror that allows most light through to the sensor while reflecting some light to the autofocus sensor. Sony's SLTs feature full-time phase detection autofocus during video recording as well as continuous shooting of up to 12 frame/s. The α series, whether traditional SLRs or SLTs, offers in-body sensor-shift image stabilization and retains the Minolta AF lens mount. , the lineup included the Alpha 68, the semipro Alpha 77 II, and the professional full-frame Alpha 99 II. The translucent (transmissive) fixed mirror allows 70 percent of the light to pass through onto the imaging sensor, meaning a 1/3rd stop loss light, {{but the rest of}} this light is continuously reflected onto the camera's phase detection AF sensor for fast autofocus for both the viewfinder and <b>live</b> <b>view</b> on the rear screen, even during video and continuous shooting. The reduced number of moving parts also makes for faster shooting speeds for its class. This arrangement means that the SLT cameras use an electronic viewfinder as opposed to an optical viewfinder, which some consider a disadvantage, but does have the advantage of a live preview of the shot with current settings, anything displayed on the rear screen is displayed on the viewfinder, and handles bright situations well.|$|E
500|$|The main {{access to}} the island is via a {{causeway}} known as the Strood, carrying the Mersea–Colchester road (B1025). The road is often covered at high tides and especially during spring tides. On average the causeway is flooded for a week per month on average. During the 1953 North Sea flood, the Strood was submerged under over [...] of water, cutting off {{access to the}} mainland. In 2012, West Mersea Lifeboats complained to Essex County Council {{about the lack of}} adequate signage after 13 people had to be rescued from the Strood at high tide in less than 24 hours. A webcam provides a <b>live</b> <b>view</b> of access across the Strood, while a corresponding website lists upcoming high tides and the likelihood of obstructing the road.|$|E

2500|$|In 2012, Canon {{introduced}} hybrid autofocus {{technology to}} the DSLR in the EOS 650D/Rebel T4i, and introduced a more sophisticated version, which it calls [...] "Dual Pixel CMOS AF", with the EOS 70D. The technology allows certain pixels to act as both contrast-detection and phase-detection pixels, thereby greatly improving autofocus speed in <b>live</b> <b>view</b> (although it remains slower than pure phase detection). While several mirrorless cameras, plus Sony's fixed-mirror SLTs, have similar hybrid AF systems, Canon is the only manufacturer that offers such a technology in DSLRs.|$|E

2500|$|The Sharks' best-known {{tradition}} is their pre-game entrance scene. At {{the beginning of}} each Sharks home game, the lights go down and a 17-foot open shark mouth is lowered from the rafters. As the mouth is lowered the eyes flash red and fog pours out. Then, a <b>live</b> <b>view</b> of the locker room tunnel with Sharks players is shown on the scoreboard and the goalie leads the team out of the locker room, through the mouth, and onto the ice. The Sharks currently use [...] "Seek & Destroy" [...] by Metallica as their entrance song.

2500|$|Compared {{with some}} low cost cameras that provide an optical {{viewfinder}} {{that uses a}} small auxiliary lens, the DSLR design {{has the advantage of}} being parallax-free: it never provides an off-axis view. A disadvantage of the DSLR optical viewfinder system is that when it is used, it prevents using the LCD for viewing and composing the picture. Some people prefer to compose pictures on the display– for them this has become the de facto way to use a camera. Depending on the viewing position of the reflex mirror (down or up), the light from the scene can only reach either the viewfinder or the sensor. Therefore, many early DSLRs did not provide [...] "live preview" [...] (i.e., focusing, framing, and depth-of-field preview using the display), a facility that is always available on digicams. Today most DSLRs can alternate between <b>live</b> <b>view</b> and viewing through an optical viewfinder.|$|E
2500|$|Dancers use {{dressing}} rooms {{to prepare for}} performances, rest between performances, and stow any of their belongings not secured by other means. It is customary for disputes between club personnel to be handled {{off the floor and}} out of sight of patrons. [...] Dressing rooms are commonly used for performer-only mediation, though this could shift into other areas of discussion if management is involved. [...] Clubs are experimenting with granting greater access to restricted areas via technology. The service includes a <b>live</b> <b>view</b> into part of the backstage dressing room and paid access enables the website user to interact live with dancers at the club. [...] Security of club assets and personnel are a primary driver for limiting access to these zones. [...] If surveillance equipment for the club and grounds is present on site, the monitoring locations for the audio/video feeds will be directed to management. In less frequent cases such feeds could also be accessed from off-site.|$|E

50|$|The a550 {{stands out}} from other DSLR's in its price range with {{its use of}} 2 {{separate}} <b>Live</b> <b>View</b> modes. The first mode operates {{in the same way}} other DSLR's do, by switching from using the main sensor to using a secondary, smaller sensor. This allows the a550 to autofocus in its first <b>Live</b> <b>View</b> mode. However this only provides a 90% view of the final image the main sensor will take.The second <b>Live</b> <b>View</b> mode is named Manual Focus Check <b>Live</b> <b>View.</b> This mode uses the main 14.2 megapixel APS-C Type CMOS Exmor Sensor to provide a 100% view on the rear LCD. This mode does not allow auto focusing, hence the name Manual Focus Check Live View.When in <b>Live</b> <b>View</b> mode the a550 uses its 3.0 TFT Xtra Fine LCD, with 921,600 dots which can be adjusted to point downwards, for overhead shooting or upwards for below eye level shooting. When <b>Live</b> <b>View</b> mode is not in use the optical viewfinder(OVF) is used and only provides 95% coverage of the actual image taken by the sensor.|$|E

30|$|Mask {{detection}} {{rates in}} the preceding experiments were consistently low. There are several reasons to be cautious in interpreting this finding. One {{is that all of}} the stimuli in Experiments 1 and 2 were photographic images. Single, static photos present much less information than dynamic, live faces (Jenkins & Burton, 2011). It is possible that, under <b>live</b> <b>viewing</b> conditions, detection rates could be much higher. On the other hand, all of the participants knew that they were taking part in a psychology experiment, and this setting may have made them especially vigilant. On that basis, it is possible that under <b>live</b> <b>viewing</b> conditions, detection rates could be even lower.|$|R
