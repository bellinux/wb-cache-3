5|$|In 2002, {{he began}} {{developing}} <b>Life</b> <b>Begins,</b> a one-hour television series. The following year he conceived George the Third. He moved to Australia in 2002 {{but continued to}} work on UK-based series.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{difficult}} questions involving the right to life is when exactly <b>life</b> <b>begins</b> and ends. If an unborn child is treated as a living person, then it should be accorded the right to life under the Constitution. Laws permitting abortion would thus be unconstitutional. This issue has yet to come before the Singapore courts.|$|E
5|$|Alongside {{the second}} series of <b>Life</b> <b>Begins,</b> Bullen {{continued}} developing George the Third. The title {{was changed to}} It Happens until eventually settling on All About George in time for filming in 2005. All About George starred Rik Mayall as George Kinsey, a builder whose life is changed when six generations of his family move into his home. Initially excited about the series when he attended the cast read-throughs, Bullen's optimism waned {{by the time it}} was broadcast as he felt there were too many characters and the series' premise unclear. In a 2008 interview, he describes it as one of his worst TV series. <b>Life</b> <b>Begins</b> returned for a third and final series in 2006. The same year, filming commenced on Tripping Over, a series about intercontinental backpackers in 1976 and 2006. SeaChange writers Andrew Knight and Andrea Denholm conceived the idea in 2003 and asked Bullen, a friend of Knight's, to develop it with them. A co-production between Australia's Channel Ten and Britain's Five, Tripping Over was broadcast in both countries at the end of 2006.|$|E

5|$|Bass guitarist and lyricist Roger Waters {{conceived}} the album {{as a rock}} opera during Pink Floyd's 1977 In the Flesh Tour, when his frustration with the audience became so acute that he spat on them. Its story, which follows themes of abandonment and personal isolation, explores Pink, a character whom Waters modeled after himself and the band's original leader Syd Barrett. Pink's <b>life</b> <b>begins</b> {{with the loss of}} his father during the Second World War, and continues with abuse from his schoolteachers, an overprotective mother, and the breakdown of his marriage; all contribute to his eventual self-imposed isolation from society, represented by a metaphorical wall. The band, who were then struggling with personal and financial difficulties, supported the idea. The album {{is considered one of the}} most recognisable concept albums.|$|E
5|$|In 1995 he {{commissioned}} a comedy drama on spec from Mike Bullen, a BBC radio producer and first-time writer. Like An Evening with Gary Lineker, The Perfect Match was based around football and received respectable reviews. Harries {{was interested in}} producing more comedy dramas, based {{on the success of}} American programmes like Thirtysomething, and assigned Granada producer Christine Langan to work with Bullen. Langan and Bullen developed Cold Feet, which was broadcast in 1997 and was commissioned for a full series in 1998. It won the British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series in 2002, which Harries collected with Bullen and Spencer Campbell. Harries executive produced two more series of Bullen's; <b>Life</b> <b>Begins</b> (2004–2006) and All About George (2005).|$|E
5|$|Clannad story {{revolves}} around Tomoya Okazaki, a third year {{high school student}} who dislikes his life. Tomoya's mother (Atsuko) died when Tomoya was young, leaving his father (Naoyuki) to raise him. After the accident, Tomoya's father turned to alcohol and gambling, and had frequent fights with his son. One day, Naoyuki, while arguing with his son, slammed Tomoya against the window, dislocating Tomoya's shoulder. This injury prevents Tomoya from playing on the basketball team, and causes him {{to distance himself from}} others. Ever since then, his father has treated Tomoya nicely, but distantly, as if Tomoya and he were strangers rather than a family. This hurts Tomoya more than his previous relationship with his father, and the awkwardness of returning home leads Tomoya constantly to stay out all night. Thus his delinquent <b>life</b> <b>begins.</b> Tomoya's good friend Youhei Sunohara, who was thrown out of the soccer club over a dispute with his seniors, is also a delinquent and often hangs out in his dorm room with Tomoya doing nothing much.|$|E

At the time, Farrell conceded that motion pictures offered immense salaries, but felt the theater was {{the foundation of the}} actor's profession. She appeared in several more plays, and in 1932, {{starred in the}} hit play <b>Life</b> <b>Begins.</b> Her performance in the play caught the attention of Jack Warner, who signed her to a long-term contract with the Warner Bros. film studio and cast her to recreate the role in Warner Bros.' film adaptation of <b>Life</b> <b>Begins</b> later that year.

25|$|Although {{there are}} {{different}} opinions among Islamic scholars about when <b>life</b> <b>begins,</b> and when abortion is permissible, most agree that the termination of a pregnancy after 120 days - the point at which, in Islam, a fetus is thought to become a living soul - is not permissible. Several Islamic thinkers contend that in cases prior to four months of gestation, abortion should be permissible only in instances in which the mother's life is in danger or in cases of rape.|$|E
