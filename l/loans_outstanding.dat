5|$|In 2008, 30,000 {{vehicles}} a day {{traveled on}} the expressway, which fulfilled state expectations; however, complaints were {{made about the}} toll machines, due to their low height and needing the exact amount of the toll. In late 2009, the South Bay Expressway partnership that operated the road questioned {{the value of the}} toll road for property tax purposes, saying that it was worth $330 million less than it was originally valued due to the low volumes of traffic using the road. On March 22, 2010, the toll road's operator filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, citing traffic counts running at less than 40 percent of initial estimates due to the economic downturn. Some drivers chose not to use the toll road due to a recent increase in tolls. An editorial in the San Diego Union-Tribune also blamed the delay in opening the toll road and the associated penalties, interest, and legal fees for the company's financial status. According to the bankruptcy filing, the expressway had $510 million of <b>loans</b> <b>outstanding,</b> of which $170 million was owed to the U.S. Department of Transportation. In addition, there was over $600 million of unresolved litigation with the construction contractors. The gross earnings (EBITDA) for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2009 were approximately $3 million on revenues of $21 million.|$|E

40|$|The {{banks are}} {{offering}} {{financial assistance to}} MFIs and SHGs {{in the form of}} loan. These loans are repayable to banks after specified period of time. The study was undertaken to study growth rate of loan disbursement between MFI-Bank Linkage and SHG-Bank Linkage in India and to study growth rate of <b>loan</b> <b>outstanding</b> between MFI-Bank Linkage and SHG-Bank Linkage in India. The present study is based on secondary sources of data. The study makes use of statistics such as arithmetic mean, standard deviation, co-efficient of variation and Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) to analyze the data. Non parametric test viz. Man-Whitney U test has been used to draw inference on the framed hypotheses. It was observed that the CAGR of amount of loan disbursed to MFI during the period from 2007 - 08 to 2015 - 16 is 33. 56 percent while the CAGR of total amount of loan disbursed to SHGs in India for the same period is 17. 33 percent. The hypothesis testing proves that there is {{no significant difference in the}} growth rate of loan disbursement between MFI- Bank linkage and SHG-Bank Linkage program. The CAGR of amount of <b>loan</b> <b>outstanding</b> against MFI during the period from 2007 - 08 to 2015 - 16 is 32. 07 percent while the CAGR of total amount of <b>loan</b> <b>outstanding</b> against SHGs in India for the period is 14. 41 percent.

We show that an increase in additional lending, L, could increase the probability of repayment of both the <b>loan</b> <b>outstanding</b> and L, thereby increasing the expected return of L for a given interest rate. Thus, additional lending could be provided at a lower contract interest rate, implying a downward sloping additional loan supply curve. Moreover, we show that over some regions of the additional loan supply schedule the contract interest rate could be below the risk-free rate. Debt; Lending...|$|R

In addition, the lower the level of banking concentration, the higher the <b>loan</b> <b>outstandings</b> (as a percentage of GDP), which suggests that the level of competition between banks has a positive impact on credit distribution.
