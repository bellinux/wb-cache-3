5|$|The royalists rose in May 1648, igniting the Second Civil War, and {{as agreed}} with Charles, the Scots invaded England. Uprisings in Kent, Essex, and Cumberland, and a {{rebellion}} in South Wales, were put {{down by the}} New Model Army, and with {{the defeat of the}} Scots at the Battle of Preston in August 1648, the royalists <b>lost</b> <b>any</b> chance of winning the war.|$|E
5|$|By late 1830, and {{certainly}} {{by the spring}} of 1831, trouble in South Wales looked likely and, probably in response, Bute broke from his normal annual plans and in May travelled south from Scotland to Cardiff Castle. With a reform bill looking likely, tensions grew between the different political factions in Glamorganshire and how the potential new parliamentary seats should be shared out, especially between Bute and his conservative allies, Crawshay and Guest. Radical demonstrations occurred in Merthyr Tydfil, one of the largest industrial communities, in May, and the crowd set light to effigies of conservative politicians. Violence broke out and arrests were made on 10 May; the prisoners were released by the angry crowd and the local authorities effectively <b>lost</b> <b>any</b> control of the town. A general insurrection ensued on 30 May.|$|E

5|$|During the 1934–35 offseason, Ruth {{circled the}} world with his wife; the trip {{included}} a barnstorming tour of the Far East. At his final stop in the United Kingdom before returning home, Ruth was introduced to cricket by Australian player Alan Fairfax, and after having little luck in a cricketer's stance, stood as a baseball batter and launched some massive shots around the field, destroying the bat in the process. Although Fairfax regretted {{that he could not}} have the time to make Ruth a cricket player, Ruth had <b>lost</b> <b>any</b> interest in such a career upon learning that the best batsmen made only about $40 per week.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the sack}} of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204, the office's {{continuity}} was broken, {{and when it}} reappears in {{the sources of the}} Palaiologan period, it had <b>lost</b> <b>any</b> judicial functions and resembled more its original military character: according to the mid-14th century Book of Offices of Pseudo-Kodinos, the Grand Droungarios of the Watch was a subordinate of the Grand Domestic, charged with the night watch and with supervising the army's scouts. In reality, however, it had become more of a sinecure and was essentially a court dignity devoid of any but ceremonial duties.|$|E
5|$|Graham confides in Evelyn that he {{is trying}} to find the Indian lover he was forced to abandon as a youth. Social-climber Jean is {{attracted}} to Graham, and makes a rare excursion to follow him, but is humiliated when he explains he is gay. Graham reunites with his former lover, who is in an arranged marriage of mutual trust and respect. Reconciled, the Englishman dies of an existing heart condition. Evelyn and Douglas grow increasingly close, angering his wife, which results in an outburst from Douglas denouncing this marriage. Muriel reveals that she was once housekeeper to a family who had her train her younger replacement and now, having been forced out of the home and into retirement, she feels that she has <b>lost</b> <b>any</b> purpose in her life.|$|E

5|$|Qadir {{made his}} Test debut in 1977 against England at the Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore. His first Test five-wicket haul came the {{following}} year against the same team in a match at the Niaz Stadium, Hyderabad. In March 1984 against the English at the Gaddafi Stadium, he took a five-wicket haul in both innings of a Test match for the first time. He repeated this feat only once more in his career, at the National Stadium, Karachi, against the same team, in December 1987. His career-best figures for an innings were 9wickets for 56runs against England at the Gaddafi Stadium, in November 1987. In Tests, Qadir was most successful against the English taking eight of his five-wicket hauls against them. He took ten or more wickets in a match on five occasions. Qadir claimed 15 five-wicket hauls in his Test career, and Pakistan never <b>lost</b> <b>any</b> of the games on such instances.|$|E
5|$|Benaud {{made his}} Test debut in January 1952 against the West Indies at the Sydney Cricket Ground, a match Australia won by 202 runs. His first Test five-wicket haul {{came in the}} first match of the 1956–57 series against India at the Corporation Stadium. He took 7 wickets for 72 runs in the first innings of the match, his best bowling figures for an innings. Benaud took his solitary pair of five-wicket hauls in the third Test of the series at the Eden Gardens. He {{accumulated}} 11 wickets for 105 runs in the match, his career-best performance in Test cricket. Benaud claimed his 16 five-wicket hauls against five different opponents, and Australia never <b>lost</b> <b>any</b> of the games on such instances. He was most successful against India and South Africa, taking 5 five-wicket hauls against each side. Benaud took his five-wicket hauls at 12 cricket grounds, including 11 at venues outside Australia. As of August 2014, he is thirty-first among all-time combined five-wicket haul takers.|$|E
5|$|The team started well, {{coming in}} third place in the team time trial in Stage 1, putting Leipheimer and Armstrong 13 seconds off the race lead. In the first {{mountain}} stage three days later, Leipheimer finished with Popovych and Horner with {{the same time as}} stage winner Danilo Di Luca, while Armstrong lost 15 seconds. The next day, Armstrong lost nearly three minutes and effectively <b>lost</b> <b>any</b> chance in the General Classification, while Leipheimer remained within ten seconds of stage winner Denis Menchov. Leipheimer was fourth overall after that stage and remained there until Stage 12, the very long and irregular individual time trial in Cinque Terre, where he was the only rider within a minute of the winning time put up by Menchov and moved to third overall. Horner withdrew from the race after Stage 10, after sustaining a leg injury that for a time prevented him from even being able to stand.|$|E

25|$|Despite its strict and {{widespread}} enforcement, {{none of the}} ban's supporting measures were ever actually codified into law. The ban was enforced based solely on administrative orders and the tsar's approval.

25|$|Between 40,000 and 45,000 Irish emigrants went to Argentina in the 19th century.

Of the 20,000 that remained, between 10,000 and 15,000 left no descendants or <b>lost</b> <b>any</b> link they had to the local Irish community. The nucleus of the Irish-Argentine community therefore consisted of only four to five thousand settlers.|$|E
