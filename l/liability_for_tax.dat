40|$|M. Com. The {{existence}} of a person is a prerequisite before any <b>liability</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> can come into being. Some of the most successfultax avoidance schemes {{of the past few}} years have relied on this principle, but the legislator has now. apparently closed these loopholes by specifically bringing the trust and the deceased estate within the definition of a person as far as the taxability of these entities is concerned. The courts have, however, set the following general principles relating to the taxation of non-existent persons: (i) The {{existence of}} a person is an absolute prerequisite before <b>liability</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> can come into being, nor can there be any representative taxpayer if there is no person to represent. (ii) An aggregate of assets and liabilities, although no legal persona, can to a limited extent take part in day to day economic activities. It is here argued that these principles may be applied to otherareas of the mercantile and private law, resulting in unforseen and beneficial consequences for the taxpayer. Section 35 of the Companies Act creates a possibility for a company to enter into contracts and acquire rights from these, even before being duly incorporated. The company, not being a legal persona before incorporation, would thus not be taxable on income it may receive or which may accrue to it up to the date of incorporation. At present, only two special tax court cases address the issue of pre-incorporation profits. Neither of the decisions handed down, however, reflects the above view, a situation which is highly unsatisfactory and supported by dubious authority. When proper consideration is given to the difference between a person professing to act as agent, and a person professing to act as trustee of a company not yet incorporated, the vesting of income andthe tax effects of retrospective contracts,it becomes clear thata real possibilityfor substantial tax savings does exist. South African writers on this subject are divided, some of them meekly accepting the present unsatisfactory situation, others acknowledging the obvious flaws in it, but declining to make definite suggestions as to how this issue should be approached. A human being becomes a legal persona at time of birth. The nasciturus fiction which stems from Roman law, provides that the rights to an inheritance are kept floating until birth of the nesduuus, to determine whether the nasciturus should share in the bequest. Depending on the interpretation of the legal effects of the nasciturus fiction, and the vesting of the right to income from the inheritance, there is a distinct possibility that <b>liability</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> on income, until time of birth of the nasciturus, may altogether be avoided. Provisions similar to section 35 of the Companies Act and the nasciturus fiction also exist in foreign legal systems. It could, however, not be established how the tax implications resulting from the application of these legal fictions are accommodated within these systems...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} article, author {{discusses}} features of regulating <b>liability</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> offenses in British criminal law. Author researches question of taxation criminalization. Author emphasizes {{that it is}} important to separate tax evasion (illegal different ways) from tax optimization (within the law). Author analyzes concept of "tax fraud", which can be defined as the deliberate actions of person to reduce taxes and committed through falsification of documents relevant to the tax authorities. In addition author considers tax fraud and other forms of criminal actions on the tax system under the British law, including tax cuts, tax resistance and refusal to pay taxes. Author concludes that forms of British economic crime compositions, depending on the way they were committed differentiates criminal liability. This question is more relevant in the process of punishment individualization because not all fraudulent evasion techniques will actually produce a much greater danger to society than "passive avoidance"...|$|E
50|$|Note {{that the}} prime {{characteristic}} of a tax being considered a trust-fund tax {{is that it was}} collected (or was supposed to be collected) from a third party, and failure to pay a trust fund tax by an entity allows the taxing authority to optionally look to the managers, responsible employees and potentially owners of the entity <b>for</b> the unpaid <b>taxes.</b> <b>For</b> example, if a corporation goes bankrupt, owing $100,000 in income tax, the managers of a business entity (corporation, limited liability company, etc.) have no personal <b>liability</b> <b>for</b> this <b>tax</b> (it is owed by the entity on its own), but if it owed $500 in sales taxes the government to whom it is due can go after management as a personal <b>liability</b> <b>for</b> the <b>tax</b> (the entity was supposed to collect the <b>tax</b> in trust <b>for</b> that government, segregate the funds until due and pay it).|$|R

40|$|Gatekeepers have an {{increasing}} role in taxation and regulation. While burdening them with legal liability for misconducts that benefit those who resort to their services actually discourages wrongdoings Ã¢Â€Â” {{as will be}} clarified in the paper Ã¢Â€Â” an alienation eÃ¯Â¬Â€ect can also arise. That is, the gatekeeper might become more interested in covering up the illegal behavior and in cooperating with the perpetrator. Such perverse eÃ¯Â¬Â€ects are diÃ¯Â¬Âƒcult to detect and to measure. This paper studies the problem with respect to tax evasion by firms, by building upon the classical Allingham and Sandmo (1972) model and by providing a more {{detailed description of the}} "concealment costs" than that available in the literature, which often simply makes assumptions about their existence and their functional form. The relationship between a risk neutral firm owner aiming at evading taxes and a risk averse gatekeeper is described through a simple principal-agent framework. The paper highlights the role of legal rules pertaining to <b>liability</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> evasion in shaping the parties choices, since concealment costs vary according to whether the risk neutral principal or the risk averse agent are held responsible when tax evasion is detected. The main result of the analysis is that there are simple conditions under which one can easily infer whether harnessing the agent is socially beneficial. tax evasion, firm, agency, risk aversion...|$|E
40|$|The main Acts {{applicable}} to the disposal of immovable property are the Alienation of Land Act 68 of 1981, the Deeds Registries Act 47 of 1937 (DRA), the Sectional Titles Act 95 of 1986, the Subdivision of Agricultural Land Act 70 of 1970, the Transfer Duty Act 40 of 1949 (TDA), the Value Added Tax Act 89 of 1991 (VAT Act) and the Income Tax Act 58 of 1962 (ITA). Apart from legislation there is also South African common law {{which is based on}} Roman-Dutch and English Law principles which also play an important role when dealing in immovable property. This dissertation focuses its review on the timing of immovable property transactions to determine the incidence of tax in South Africa and concentrates on the differences in the timing of ownership according to the ITA, VAT Act, TDA and DRA as well as common law principles. International accounting standards have been reviewed and a comparison drawn between the accounting treatment of a disposal and the tax treatment as well as a comparison drawn up between South Africa and Australia with regards to how for tax purposes the disposal of immovable property is treated. Statutory authority is necessary before taxes can be imposed and only the statute must be used {{in order to determine the}} <b>liability</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax.</b> Accounting or related principles are not taken into account when the tax liability is determined except in instances where the ITA specifically provides for it. The aim of this dissertation is to answer the question of whether there is a disconnect between the timing of the transfer of immovable property and the timing of the attendant taxation for the seller through analysing specifically the various Acts and laws which impact the transfer of immovable property...|$|E
