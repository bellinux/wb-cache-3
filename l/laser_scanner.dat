25|$|Before {{the start}} of excavations, {{beginning}} in the early months of 2004, Dr. Victor Manuel Velasco Herrera, from UNAM Institute of Geophysics, determined with the help of ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and a team of some 20 archaeologists and workers the approximate length of the tunnel and the presence of internal chambers. They scanned the earth under the Ciudadela, returning every afternoon to upload the results to Gómez’s computers. By 2005, the digital map was complete. The archaeologists explored the tunnel with a remote-controlled robot called Tlaloc II-TC, equipped with an infrared camera and a <b>laser</b> <b>scanner</b> that generates 3D visualization to perform three dimensional register of the spaces beneath the temple. A small opening in the tunnel wall was made and the scanner captured the first images, 37 meters into the passage.|$|E

40|$|The {{directional}} gap fraction {{in forest}} and woodland canopies {{is the primary}} information that {{is used for the}} non-destructive estimation of canopy leaf area index (LAI). In this study the directional gap fraction of a mixed species forest stand was measured using three different terrestrial <b>laser</b> <b>scanners</b> providing measurements with two different beam divergences at two different wavelengths. Gap fractions estimated from the <b>laser</b> <b>scanners</b> were compared to the gap fraction derived from hemispherical photographs recorded near simultaneously. The results showed that differences in wavelength gave rise to contrasting intensity images which contained complementary information on canopy composition. Wider beam divergence gave rise to lower estimates of gap fraction, and the terrestrial <b>laser</b> <b>scanners</b> underestimated gap fraction when compared to data derived from the hemispherical photographs. Beam divergence, laser wavelength and range-related variation in intensity all affect gap detection. These issues are discussed and future data processing techniques to provide consistent estimates of canopy gap fraction from terrestrial <b>laser</b> <b>scanners</b> are discussed...|$|R

30|$|Accurate 3 D {{measuring}} systems {{thrive in}} the past few years. Most of them are based on <b>laser</b> <b>scanners</b> because these <b>laser</b> <b>scanners</b> are able to acquire 3 D information directly and precisely in real time. However, comparing to the conventional cameras, these kinds of equipment are usually expensive and they are not commonly available to customers. Moreover, <b>laser</b> <b>scanners</b> interfere easily with each other sensors of the same type. On the other hand, computer vision-based 3 D measuring techniques use stereo matching to acquire the cameras’ relative position and then estimate the 3 D location of points on the image. Because this kind of systems needs additional estimation of the 3 D information, systems with real time capability often relies on heavy parallelism that prevents implementation on mobile devices.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — <b>Laser</b> <b>scanners</b> {{have been}} an {{integral}} part of MEMS research for more than three decades. During the last decade, miniaturized projection displays and various medical-imaging applications became the main driver for progress in MEMS <b>laser</b> <b>scanners.</b> Portable and truly miniaturized projectors became possible with the availability of red, green, and blue diode lasers during the past few years. Inherent traits of the laser scanning technology, such as the very large color gamut, scalability to higher resolutions within the same footprint, and capability of producing an always-in-focus image render it a very viable competitor in mobile projection. Here, we review the requirements on MEMS <b>laser</b> <b>scanners</b> for the demanding display applications, performance levels of the best scanners in the published literature, and {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} electrostatic, electromagnetic, piezoelectric, and mechanically coupled actuation principles. Resonant high-frequency scanners, low-frequency linear scanners, and 2 -D scanners are included in this review.
