50|$|Group B was {{responsible}} for the <b>running</b> of <b>locomotives.</b> At a large depot, they were headed by an inspector (Inspektor), who was usually also the deputy to the shedmaster (Dienstvorsteher), and who was supported by various assistants and running foremen (Lokdienstleiter). The majority of large Bahnbetriebswerke also had an outside <b>running</b> <b>foreman</b> and their own duty roster clerk (Diensteinteiler). Smaller Betriebswerke handed the functions of this group to the <b>running</b> <b>foreman.</b> Group B, which was referred to by the Deutsche Reichsbahn as Sektion Triebfahrzeug-Betrieb (<b>locomotive</b> <b>running</b> section), had to look after everything to do with <b>locomotive</b> and train <b>running.</b> Tasks assigned to this group included supervising locomotive operations, clearing defects and faults, drawing up locomotive diagrams and crew rosters, allocating staff and engines, checking locomotive records, training personnel, managing all documents and the care and supply of all engines (heating, coaling and cleaning). The drawing up of tasks, locomotive diagrams and crew rosters was later taken over by so-called 'technologists' (Technologen).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a locomotive dynamic model {{to study the}} coupler compressed stability and <b>locomotive</b> <b>running</b> safety under severe longitudinal compressive forces, taking into account {{a new model of}} the flattened pin coupler and buffer system employed by heavy-haul locomotives. In this new model, the arc surface contact friction element is built up {{for the first time to}} simulate the compressed contact friction process between the arc surfaces of the coupler tail and the following plate. An improved nonlinear mathematical model of buffers and a coupler rotation angle stop element are also included. After validating the presented locomotive dynamic model by comparing its calculated results with test data, simulations are carried out to analyse the influences of the coupler-tail arc surface and locomotive secondary suspension parameters on the coupler compressed stability and <b>locomotive</b> <b>running</b> safety. Results indicate that the friction coefficient and the arc radius of the coupler-tail arc surfaces have a remarkable influence, and that the locomotive secondary lateral stop and lateral stiffness also have a significant effect. Optimising these parameters could significantly improve the coupler compressed stability and <b>locomotive</b> <b>running</b> safety. Finally, a real example of Chinese heavy-haul trains is shown to confirm the importance of the coupler-tail contact friction action...|$|R
