50|$|Norske Skog Walsum is a {{pulp mill}} and paper mill {{situated}} in the Duisburg neighborhood of Walsum, the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The mill starts operations in 1962, established by Haindl and owned by Norske Skog from 2001. Since the 1990s the mill had two paper machines producing <b>lightweight</b> <b>coated</b> <b>paper,</b> a type of magazine paper. Both paper machines have a trimmed width of 725 cm. PM4 has an annual production of 225,000 tonnes, PM10 has 215,000 tonnes. The mill used as its source one-third thermomechanical pulp, one-third kraft pulp and one-third coating. The mill is situated on the Rhine. Until production curtailment in 2013, the mill employed 460 people.|$|E
50|$|The mill at Walsum {{opened in}} 1962 under the {{ownership}} of Haindl, initially consisting of one paper machine. PM4 was installed in 1985, followed by PM10 in 1991. Both were manufactured by Voith. Combined they gave an annual capacity of 420,000 tonnes of <b>lightweight</b> <b>coated</b> <b>paper.</b> The owners of the family-owned Haindl consortium decided to sell the company in 2000. It was bought in a joint deal, where UPM took over four and Norske Skog bought two of the mills—Parenco and Walsum. The deal took effect on 30 November 2001, with Norske Skog paying 8.2 billion Norwegian krone for the two mills. Norske Skog was {{in a process of}} specialization, selling all non-core assets while purchasing a dominant position in the world's newsprint and magazine paper market.

40|$|Abstract. The {{impact of}} <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> {{printability}} for image quality on the high-fidelity digital printing was studied in this paper. Compared {{with the traditional}} printing technology, high-fidelity digital printing technology {{is more likely to}} expand the color gamut, maintain the original tone linear and produce vivid image. The performance of <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> to a large extent determines the image quality. In order to get high-quality printed matters, the mechanism of the <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> printability influencing on the performance on high-fidelity digital printing is need to be researched in-depth. The printability of <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> was studied from several aspects in this paper, including the structural properties, roughness, optical properties, absorption etc, the relationships between these properties and printing color, dot reproduction performance were also studied. Based on the previous theoretical and practical studies, the printability evaluation system of <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> on high-fidelity digital printing was established initially. On digital printing, accurate color management technology also affects the printing quality as the performance of <b>coated</b> <b>paper,</b> so the advanced color management technology was also used in the current study. The results showed that the pore structure and the absorbent of <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> were the most important factors for affecting the printing quality, and the roughness and optical properties of <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> also had a certain impact...|$|R
40|$|Production of {{mechanical}} pulp {{is expected to}} increase significantly to meet the growing global demand for paper. Mechanical pulping uses wood resources more efficiently with less negative impact on the environment than does chemical pulping. However, several problems related to mechanical pulping need to be resolved: high energy consumption, low paper strength properties, problems with pitch, and color reversion. Biopulping, an alternative pulping method, resolves the energy, strength, and pitch limitations but does not address brightness or color reversion. Optical properties can be improved and stabilized by incorporating calcium carbonate into pulp by fiber loading. The objective of this work was to investigate the technical feasibility of combining biopulping with fiber loading. We expected the combined technologies would save energy, improve paper properties, and reduce the production costs compared with current technology. This paper summarizes results obtained from a laboratory-scale handsheet investigation using a typical mill furnish for producing <b>lightweight</b> <b>coated</b> <b>paper.</b> Our results identified synergy between the complementary biopulping and fiber loading technologies enabling a substitution of up to 10 % kraft with mechanical fiber without compromising paper properties. Simultaneous peroxide bleaching during fiber loading, an attractive alternative to a separate bleach stage, also was explored. These are the first results of combining these technologies...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a new technology based on a mild chemical pretreatment process prior to mechanical pulping. Chips are treated with a dilute solution of oxalic acid (OA) for only 10 minute at 130 °C, in a typical example. The properties of the pulp produced by this OA process are quite different from those obtained via conventional chemical pretreatments, providing a much more valuable pulp, and at higher yields. Refining results obtained at the Andritz Pilot Plant in Springfield, Ohio show an outstanding combination of strength improvements, energy savings, and shive and triglycerides reduction, with only a modest loss in brightness. Under suitable conditions the light scattering coefficient of the oxalic-treated treated chips was fully recovered without losing the above benefits. Maintaining light scattering coefficient with this treatment is of great interest, particularly to those mills producing <b>lightweight</b> <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> (LWC). Refining results are presented here, along with {{an evaluation of the}} process economics for a LWC example case. Based on strength improvements (kraft replacement in the final furnish) and energy savings, the production cost savings are substantial. For the LWC example, at least $ 9 million/year net savings before license fees can be realized in an operation producing 372 t/d of OA mechanical pulp for 600 t/d of blended LWC furnish. Based on this strong economic potential, several mechanical pulp mills have expressed interest in conducting in-mill evaluations. Planning for mill trials is currently underway...|$|E

40|$|Drying occurs {{twice during}} <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> production: first, when drying the base paper, then when drying the sheet freshly coated with an aqueous {{suspension}} of pigment particles. The effects on <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> quality from the impingement drying conditions used at both base <b>paper</b> and <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> drying stages were studied {{for the light}} weight <b>coated</b> (LWC) <b>paper.</b> A central feature {{of the study was}} the development of the capability to dry <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> by impingement in superheated steam. The variables investigated were the drying fluid, air or superheated steam, drying fluid temperature, drying time and temperature, and coating-to-drying delay time. The effects of drying on the uncoated paper physical properties and the <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> physical and printing properties were determined. The drying of the base paper with superheated steam gave higher strength and hydrophobicity but lower optical properties and smoothness than drying in air. When steam-dried base <b>paper</b> was <b>coated</b> and dried in air or steam it gave a rougher, less glossy, less bright <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> than air-dried base paper. Print mottle remained high when air drying was used subsequently for the coated sheet. The biggest effect on LWC <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> quality derived from the choice of drying medium, air or superheated steam. Coating-to-drying delay time had no effect. Most of the properties of steam-dried <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> were fixed by 0. 6 s drying time. Properties the most affected were surface properties: print quality, gloss and roughness, while bulk properties were less sensitive. Drying with superheated steam gave lower gloss and smoothness than drying in air. Print mottle was significantly improved with steam drying of the coated sheet. Superheated steam drying of <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> has advantages only if used for the coated sheet not the base sheet...|$|R

40|$|Curtain coating is {{non-contact}} pre-metered coating process, {{which offers}} {{great potential for}} improved coverage at lower coat weights for the <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> industry. Absence of shear and hydrostatic force leads to differences in coating-basesheet interactions and process dynamics currently experienced with other conventional coating processes. These differences may lead to surface characteristics of curtain <b>coated</b> <b>papers</b> that {{are very different from}} those obtained by conventional coating methods. Due to these differences, printing attributes of curtain <b>coated</b> <b>papers</b> are crucial to their acceptance in the marketplace. Due to the absence of shear, pigment alignment is not as strong as in other conventional coating processes. In addition, as there is little hydrostatic pressure, binder migration is minimal, so more binder is present at the surface. The increase in binder at the surface improves the interaction of the coating layer with the ink, resulting in a thicker layer of ink transfer to the base sheet in offset printing. In this study, the calendering response, printability and surface of curtain <b>coated</b> <b>papers</b> were compared with blade <b>coated</b> <b>papers</b> at equal <b>coat</b> weights and surface roughness.

40|$|Abstract. Coating pore {{structure}} of low gloss <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> based on different pigment blends was analyzed using mercury intrusion method in this paper. The {{results show that}} pore size of coating layer structure of low gloss <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> ranges from 20 nm- 500 nm, and the range from 500 nm- 5000 nm is mainly from base paper and interactions between coating color and base <b>paper.</b> Printability of <b>coated</b> <b>paper</b> can be well related with coating {{pore structure}}. Print gloss is strongly influenced by pore size and pore volume. Large pore diameters and small pore volume of coating layer structure can improve print gloss. Ink density increases with the increasing of pore diameter while the pore volume is kept constant. The increasing of pore volume of coat layer structure will improve capillary absorption and then improve ink absorption. The control of coating pore structure {{is very important for}} producing low gloss <b>coated</b> <b>paper...</b>|$|R
