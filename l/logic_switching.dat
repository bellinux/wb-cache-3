50|$|The {{leakage current}} of <b>logic</b> <b>switching</b> {{transistors}} increases with temperature. In rare instances, this {{may lead to}} thermal runaway in digital circuits. This is not a common problem, since leakage currents usually make up {{a small portion of}} overall power consumption, so the increase in power is fairly modest — for an Athlon 64, the power dissipation increases by about 10% for every 30 degrees Celsius. For a device with a TDP of 100 W, for thermal runaway to occur, the heat sink would have to have a thermal resistivity of over 3 K/W (kelvins per watt), which is about 6 times worse than a stock Athlon 64 heat sink. (A stock Athlon 64 heat sink is rated at 0.34 K/W, although the actual thermal resistance to the environment is somewhat higher, due to the thermal boundary between processor and heatsink, rising temperatures in the case, and other thermal resistances..) Regardless, an inadequate heat sink with a thermal resistance of over 0.5 to 1 K/W would result in the destruction of a 100 W device even without thermal runaway effects.|$|E

The conventional DTC (CDTC) and FDTC drive performance is compared using Conventional PI, Fuzzy controller and Neural Network controllers. The major disadvantages of CDTC are high torque and flux ripples in {{steady state operation}} of the drive, inferior performance at low speed operation and variable switching frequency. The presence of hysteresis bands is the major reason for high torque and flux ripples in CDTC. In FDTC the hysteresis band and switching table are replaced by Fuzzy <b>logic</b> <b>switching</b> controller. Using fuzzy logic torque, stator flux space are divided into smaller subsections which results in precise and optimal selection of switching state to meet load torque. In high performance drives accurate tuning of PI speed controller is required. The conventional PI controller cannot adapt to the variation in model parameters.
