30|$|The {{samples were}} thermo-mechanically {{densified}} with a hydraulic press machine having {{a capacity of}} 180 tons, pressure and temperature control capability, and a pressing tray with dimensions of 60  ×  60  cm 2. The process of densification {{was carried out by}} applying four variations using two compression ratios (20 and 40 %) and two temperatures (110  ±  5 and 150  ±  5  °C). The samples, after being placed on the <b>lower</b> <b>tray</b> in the pressing mechanism, were subjected to mild pressure. Heat was transferred to the samples through their contact with the heated upper and lower sections of the press tray and their internal temperature was monitored by a thermometer until the target temperature was reached. Afterwards, the samples were subjected to automatically controlled radial compression (60  mm/min loading speed). Metal rods placed at intervals on the pressing tray enabled the samples to achieve the desired 20  mm thickness. After being kept under pressure for 10  min, the samples were removed from the machine and allowed to cool to room temperature, during which time pressure of approximately 5  kg/cm 2 was applied to minimise any spring-back effects. To provide dimensional stability, the densified pine samples were thermally post-treated at 185 and 212  °C for 2  h. Thermal post-treatment was carried out under the protection of water vapour according to the process described in the Finnish ThermoWood Handbook [34] after which the densified and thermal-treated samples were cut into smaller samples according to both density and decay test standards.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Recent {{studies have}} {{revealed}} that drying maize using biomass driers increase the quality of grains delays insect infestation mold and aflatoxin contamination in relation to direct sunlight drying. Most importantly biomass drying takes shorter time. It is therefore important to undertake performance of these driers to investigate the possibility of empirical control of such systems in remote areas. In this paper we present results of thermal performance of typical biomass-powered drier batch type. The results show that under natural convection temperature behavior within the drying chamber is unpredictable. However the use of exhaust fan forced convection gives predictable temperature distribution within the drying chamber. For burner shutter open at 50 and using maize cob as the fuel for forced convection the drying chamber attained a maximum temperature of 93 amp 730 C after 28 minutes and minimum temperature of 69 amp 730 C after 37 minutes in the <b>lower</b> <b>tray</b> tray 1. For burner shutter open at 100 the drying chamber attained a maximum temperature of 91 amp 730 C after 41 minutes and minimum temperature of 67 amp 730 C in tray 1. With burner 50 open tray 2 attained a maximum temperature of 62 amp 730 C after 30 minutes and minimum temperature of 56 amp 730 C after 40 minutes. With the burner 100 open tray 2 attained a maximum temperature of 61 amp 730 C after 39 minutes and minimum temperature of 52 amp 730 C after 52 minutes. From these results the optimal operating conditions of the burner operation were achieved when the shutter was open at 50. It took 76 minutes to dry 5 kg of maize with about 0. 8 kg including dampness from rains moisture content in tray 1. It took 140 minutes to dry the same quantity and moisture content of maize in tray 2. These results show {{that it is possible}} to control empirically biomass cereal maize driers...|$|E
40|$|The {{distillation}} point efficiencies for the alcohol-water binary, ternary and quaternary systems were measured using a modified Oldershaw column. This column is expanded above the tray {{to separate the}} newly formed bubbles from the column wall, thus eliminating the surface tension induced wall effects for positive systems and discouraging wetted wall effects. The excessive and recirculating foam and froth found in the conventional Oldershaw column is due to these wall effects and does not represent conditions in large scale distillation. The point efficiencies measured using this column for the system methanol/water were lower than the point efficiencies deduced from the composition profiles across a large and narrow rectangular distillation column using an eddy diffusion model. The narrow rectangular column had a liquid flow path length of about one meter, thus avoiding stagnant zones and flow non-uniformities. The lower efficiencies were due to the shorter contact time between the gas and the liquid. This contact time was increased markedly by fitting an outlet weir to the modified Oldershaw column, thus increasing the tray liquid hold-up and the point efficiencies. These point efficiencies were about 10 per cent lower than those on the large tray at a similar value of the F. Factor. The eddy diffusion model predicted rectangular tray efficiencies about 10 to 20 per cent lower than those measured, when using the improved modified column point efficiencies. Using a suitable model, the improved point efficiencies were scaled-up to the conditions existing on the rectangular tray. This resulted in the large tray values of 2 to 4 per cent <b>lower</b> <b>tray</b> efficiencies than those measured. The surface tension effect on the point efficiencies of the binary systems MeOH/n. PrOH using the original modified Oldershaw column {{in the absence of}} wall effects using the concept of the Marangoni stabilising index. The surface tension of these systems were measured using a glass thermometer. The system MeOH/H 20 had the highest Marangoni index and showed the highest point efficiencies throughout the composition range, with the EtOH/H 2 O/n. PrOH, with low values of the Marangoni index, showed comparable point efficiencies throughout the composition range. These systems demonstrate all the possible types of surface tension behaviour. The effects of the outlet weir height and hole size on the point efficiencies in the rectangular column operating under similar hydrodynamic conditions were also investigated using the system MeOH/H 2 O. There was an increase in point and tray efficiencies on increasing the outlet weir height from 2 mm to 12. 7 mm. There was also small increase in point and tray efficiencies on decreasing the hole size from 6. 4 mm to 1 mm at the expense of higher pressure drops. The point efficiencies of these trays under different hydraulic conditions were in the range 85 to 95 per cent, with subsequent high tray efficiencies. This provides further evidence of the high tray efficiencies available to the design engineer if the detrimental effects of stagnant zones and flow non-uniformities were eliminated. Two highly non-ideal ternary systems and quaternary system were also studied using the original modified Oldershaw and the rectangular columns. Considerable differences between the individual component point efficiencies were observed. These differences are probably caused by the interactive nature of the mass transfer in these systems. These systems also exhibited equal component point efficiencies in parts of the composition range, which illustrates the composition dependency of these systems. The individual component tray efficiencies for these systems were noticeably different, even with equal component point efficiencies operating across the tray. These differences were simulated using the eddy diffusion model, highlighting the effects of limited liquid back mixing on the tray. The composition profile for the system MeOH/EtOH/H 20 were predicted and compared with the measurements across the rectangular column using three methods derived from the original Maxwell and Stephan mass transfer equations. These predictions were in good agreement with the measurements. However, as the comparison is only based on a one meter flow path length, the actual design of distillation column using these methods would be conservative. The prediction of the composition profiles using the point efficiencies from the original version of the modified 0 ldershaw column yielded a similar observation for both the ternaries and the quaternary system. An expanded aluminium tray (Expamet 607 A) was also subject to preliminary efficiency tests in the rectangular column. This material has corrugated angled holes, thus encouraging the liquid flow across the tray by using the vapour momentum. This material showed much lower pressure drops, due to its high open area compared with conventional sieve trays, and discourages weeping and entrainment...|$|E

Traditionally, crops (and fish) are spread {{out in the sun}} to dry, but this leaves them vulnerable to the vagaries of the weather to attack by pests and theft by birds and animals. To provide a solution to this problem the Intermediate Technology Group worked on developing an effective drying cabinet that was cheap to build and to run. An initial programme to dry sorrel in St. Vincent in 1974 led to further experimentation in Guatemala, where the need was to dry vegetables. The technology was then further refined and transferred to Peru and other countries in Latin America, where the need was as diverse as herbal teas and fruit. The first system consisted of a simple plywood double-cabinet drier, holding nine trays with air heated by a Benson-letaire heater blower. It was soon realized that the <b>lower</b> <b>trays</b> dried first and could be removed, the upper trays moved down and new trays added to the top. Moving the trays became time-consuming and so a semi-continuous system that allowed the trays to move down the cabinet was developed. The system was adapted in interesting ways to meet local needs and conditions and where fuel was cheap the semicontinuous, fuelefficient design was not always favoured. The drier is now being used in Bangladesh where It is helping a group of landless women process their coconut all year round. It has even been used in Ireland to process organically grown herbs.

40|$|Background: The {{success of}} complex {{molecular}} cytogenetic studies depends on having properly spread chromosomes. However, inconsistency of optimum chromosome spreading remains {{a major problem}} in cytogenetic studies. Methods: The metaphase spreading process was carefully timed to identify the most critical phase of chromosome spreading. The effects of dropping height of cell suspension, slide condition, drying time, fixative ratio, and relative humidity on the quality of metaphase spreads were studied by quantitative examination of metaphase chromosome spreads. Normal and immortalized human epithelial ovarian cells, neuroblastoma cells, and normal lymphocytes were tested. Results: Humidity over the slide was the most important variable affecting the quality of chromosome spreads. Consistent improvement in chromosome spreading (larger metaphase area, less chromosome overlaps, or lower frequencies of broken metaphases) was obtained for all cell types if dynamic cell rehydration, occurring as fixative absorbs moisture from air, was made to coincide with the prompt fixation of spread chromosomes to the slide. This was achieved by dropping cells on dry glass slides placed in a shallow metal tray and then quickly <b>lowering</b> the <b>tray</b> into a covered 50 °C water bath for slide drying.

40|$|A {{robot system}} {{for use in}} an {{enclosed}} environment was designed and tested. The conceptual design {{will be used to}} assist in research performed by the Controlled Ecological Life Support System (CELSS) project. Design specifications include maximum load capacity, operation at specified environmental conditions, low maintenance, and safety. The robot system must not be hazardous to the sealed environment, and be capable of stowing and deploying within a minimum area of the CELSS chamber facility. This design consists of a telescoping robot arm that slides vertically on a shaft positioned {{in the center of the}} CELSS chamber. The telescoping robot arm consists of a series of links which can be fully extended to a length equal to the radius of the working envelope of the CELSS chamber. The vertical motion of the robot arm is achieved through the use of a combination ball screw/ball spline actuator system. The robot arm rotates cylindrically about the vertical axis through use of a turntable bearing attached to a central mounting structure fitted to the actuator shaft. The shaft is installed in an overhead rail system allowing the entire structure to be stowed and deployed within the CELSS chamber. The overhead rail system is located above the chamber's upper lamps and extends to the center of the CELSS chamber. The mounting interface of the actuator shaft and rail system allows the entire actuator shaft to be detached and removed from the CELSS chamber. When the actuator shaft is deployed, it is held fixed at the bottom of the chamber by placing a square knob on the bottom of the shaft into a recessed square fitting in the bottom of the chamber floor. A support boot ensures the rigidity of the shaft. Three student teams combined into one group designed a model of the CELSS chamber robot that they could build. They investigated materials, availability, and strength in their design. After the model arm and stand were built, the class performed pre-tests on the entire system. A stability pre-test was used to determine whether the model robot arm would tip over on the stand when it was fully extended. Results showed the stand tipped when 50 Newtons were applied horizontally to the top of the vertical shaft while the arm was fully extended. This proved that it was stable. Another pre-test was the actuator slip test used to determine if there is an adequate coefficient of friction between the actuator drive wheels and drive cable to enable the actuator to fully extend and retract the arm. This pre-test revealed that the coefficient of friction was not large enough to prevent slippage. Sandpaper was glued to the drive wheel and this eliminated the slippage problem. The class preformed a fit test in the CELSS chamber to ensure that the completed robot arm is capable of reaching the entire working envelope. The robot was centered in the chamber and the arm was fully extended to the sides of the chamber. The arm was also able to retract to clear the drain pipes separating the upper and <b>lower</b> plant <b>trays...</b>|$|R

Consequently, they are useful for distinguishing temporal or spatial trends in abundance or they are deployed for several weeks and, as a result, the quantitative samples are cumulative. We developed a portable artificial seagrass unit (ASU) with buoyant plastic artificial seagrass (47 cm long by 15 mm wide strips) that can be retrieved, harvested and re-deployed with 98 % catch efficiency in about 5 min by two people from a small boat. They can quickly and easily quantify settlement of crustacean and fish postlarvae over tidal or deil periods. When set for 24 h, postlarvae settled from the plankton during the night and their abundance {{is the result of}} a distinct settlement event. When set for longer periods, the numbers of postlarvae may represent several settlement events and post-settlement activities. Crustacean and fish postlarvae and juveniles used ASUs deployed within seagrass in a similar way to natural seagrass. Estimates of juvenile tiger prawn abundance from beam-trawl catches showed similar densities in natural seagrass (2. 93 Penaeus semisulcatus de Haan m− 2 day) to those in the ASUs (2. 40 P. semisulcatus m− 2 day− 1); their density was significantly <b>lower</b> on bare <b>trays</b> (0. 48 P. semisulcatus m− 2 day− 1). When deployed on bare areas, more epifaunal crustacean postlarvae were collected from the ASUs (e. g.

40|$|It is {{customary}} {{to weigh}} the organs removed at necropsy and these measurements provide objective criteria of atrophy, hypertrophy, and disease. However, surprisingly few mortuaries have facilities for weighing whole bodies. When this hospital opened in 1970 attempts to obtain a body weighing machine {{within the limits of}} the budget were un-successful and a simple modification of the body elevating machine was devised which enabled each body to be quickly and easily weighed. Method A gallows beam of 50 mm square structural tube is held permanently in place by a locking screw in a fabricated mounting made of 6 mm steel plate, the whole being galvanised. The long-handled locking screw facilitates easy dismantling if required. The mounting is bolted {{to the top of a}} power-operated Gibbons mortuary stacking machitie (model H 5053 M) (Fig. 1). A spring balance with a capacity of 200 kg, by division of 1 kg, is suspended from the beam, and to the balance four chains are attached which can be fixed by hooks to the four corners of an unmodified steel body tray. The tare is adjusted with the chains and tray in position. Cadavers may be conveniently weighed while being removed from the body store: the tray carrying the body and supported by the elevator is attached to the balance by four chains. The elevator support is then <b>lowered</b> until the <b>tray</b> and the body are freely suspended and the weight is read from the spring balance (Fig. 2). The method was devised to suit the model of stacking machine available in the mortuary.
