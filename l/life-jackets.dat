6000|$|Several young women, {{wives of}} some of the men, had {{assembled}} there to dissuade their husbands from going out on such a terrible night. These were so alarmed at the terrific thunder of the surf on the shores of the little bay, and the howling of the wind, that they clung to the men and entreated them with tears not to venture.

40|$| people leapt {{into the}} sea. In this situation, would it {{really have been}} so {{surprising}} if a child were thrown overboard with a <b>life-jacket</b> on? Why might a parent do that? Perhaps because they {{believed that it was}} their child’s only hope of rescue; stuck abroad a listing, wooden ferry, overcrowded with hysterical and desperate people, choked by diesel fumes, having had warning shots fired over the bows in the dark, and now being forced away from the place where you were hoping to find sanctuary, a parent might indeed make the heart-wrenching decision to throw their child into the water, hoping that at least their son or daughter would be rescued and taken to Australia aboard the sturdy grey naval vessel that was both the cause of their anguish, and their only hope of salvation. Government senators have sought to muddy the waters in the kids overboard in inquiry, by demonstrating that whether or not children were thrown overboard, they did end up in the water {{as a result of the}} actions of asylum seekers in rendering their vessel unseaworthy. This may be true - the point however, is the context - these confrontations at sea were the product of Australia’s decision to stop the asylum seekers making landfall at almost any cost. The federal government’s response to the Tampa was policy on the run. All the signs indicate that the decision to prevent the asylum seekers from landing was primarily motivated by a desire to win the November federal election. The “Pacific solution” was really a “Nauru fix”, an arrangement cobbled together out of political necessity, and with an open cheque book, when it quickly became apparent that the government’s first preference of simply sending people back to Indonesia was not going to work, at least not initially. While the Tampa was still anchored off Christmas Island, the heads of Australian diplomatic missions around the region were receiving urgent cables, instructing them to sound out their host governments about the possibility of warehousing asylum seekers on Australia’s behalf. The pressure was coming from Prime Minister and Cabinet - the gut response in the senior ranks of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was that the policy was wrong and that it would damage Australia’s reputation, as it almost certainly has done. But PM&C won the day and despite its shortcomings - despite the huge financial cost, despite the diplomatic damage, despite the uncertainty and distress experienced by the asylum seekers themselves - the Pacific solution nevertheless looks like succeeding, in its own narrow terms. There are many unanswered questions - what will happen to the refugees in Nauru or PNG who cannot find a resettlement place? What will happen to the non-refugees, who nevertheless cannot be sent back to their homeland? Will they, like many ‘failed’ asylum seekers in Australia, simply languish indefinitely behind razor wire because they cannot be sent anywhere else? Nevertheless, the narrow aim of the policy - preventing the arrival of asylum seekers on Australia’s shores - appears to have been met. Since the Tampa, no asylum seeker arriving by boat has managed to access Australia’s refugee determination system; since December, no boats have been detected even seeking to enter Australian waters. Three alleged smuggling syndicate bosses have been detained and intelligence reports suggest the number of people arriving in Indonesia en route to Australia has dropped dramatically. No doubt the changes in Afghanistan have helped. With the demise of the Taliban, Afghan refugees in Pakistan and Iran have more hope of returning home, and fresh outflows of refugees from Afghanistan itself have been halted, at least for now. There are still plenty of refugees from Iraq or Iran, Kurds and Palestinians and others who are seeking a durable solution to their plight, but they have been effectively deflected or diverted from Australia, for the time being. No doubt the smugglers will offer them passage to Canada, or the US, or a European destination, instead. And while many countries criticised Australia for its actions in the Tampa affair, there are politicians and bureaucrats taking note around the world, to see how this Australian experiment will pan out, and what might be gleaned from it to augment their own border defences. For example, the United States and Australia are discussing a kind of “refugee swap”. The US will resettle Afghan and Iraqi ‘Pacific solution’ refugees who were trying to make it to Australia, and in exchange, Australia will take Cuban and Haitian refugees who were trying to make it to the US. The logic here is that you offer a person protection as a refugee, but you make sure that they do not find that protection in a place of their own choosing - in other words, you thwart their “desired migration outcome”, to use one of Mr Ruddock’s favourite turns of phrase. As the Minister said recently in London: “What we 2 ̆ 7 re looking to see is that people 2 ̆ 7 s migration intentions of reaching Australia, even if they are refugees, is not realised - that is, that they will often go to places that they hadn 2 ̆ 7 t anticipated they might be going to and hadn 2 ̆ 7 t planned to go to. ” The policy rests on an assumption that asylum seekers actually “shop” for their destination of choice - and in some cases, there is no doubt, asylum seekers will try to reach a country where they have relatives or friends. In my experience however, many “boat people” ended up in Australia by default, because that was the destination on offer from the smuggler they encountered. If they had been offered Canada or the US or Britain instead, then they would have gone there. Ironically the government’s success in November 2001 could be its undoing at the next election. Without the boat people, it may be harder for the Coalition to win an election. It could actually be in the interests of the Howard government to see a minor resurgence in people smuggling from Indonesia towards the end of 2004, so it can appeal once again to our base fears and beat the drum of border protection. For Labor meanwhile there must be a sense of relief. If the government’s harsh policies keep working for another three years, then the boat people are removed from the political equation, and the next election may be fought on ground more of Labor’s choosing, on issues like health care and education. Certainly Labor displays little inclination to unwind the government’s policies. Labor will not need to pursue the Pacific solution if the boats have stopped coming; except perhaps to wind it up quickly while revealing its true financial costs. Labor may tinker with detention arrangements on the Australian mainland, to allow some form of community release while asylum applications are assessed, particularly for families, but it will not walk away from a policy of its own making. In any case, if there are no boats arriving, then there will not be many asylum seekers in mainland detention anyway, only the few hundred who arrive each year by air, and the detention centres will slip back into the obscurity they enjoyed for most of the 1990 s. If any asylum seekers do come by boat, they will detained at Christmas Island, where it is impossible for them to access the Australia’s refugee determination procedures, since Labor supported the government in declaring certain parts of Australia to be outside the operation of the migration act. That was one of seven far reaching pieces of legislation that Labor helped the government to rush through during the dying days of the last parliament. In the wake of the Tampa, the definition of a refugee was more narrowly defined in Australian law. A privative clause was introduced that prevents asylum seekers from challenging negative decisions before the courts. The actions taken in regard to the Tampa were made retrospectively legal, and Australian military and customs officials were empowered to board boats on the high seas, to take over the helm and direct them elsewhere. Political logic suggests that Labor will not move to rescind any of this legislation, because to do so would be to hand the Coalition a stick with which to beat it should any future boats arrive. However the success of the “Pacific solution” may be short lived, since history shows that the ultimate effect of policies of deterrence is not always predictable. An example of this is the Temporary Protection Visa, introduced in October 1999. TPVs limit the entitlements of those refugees who arrive in Australia without authorisation - in particular, preventing them from applying to sponsor family members to join them in Australia. The TPV was meant to deter people smuggling, by making Australia a less attractive destination. In fact it did the reverse, encouraging men who had already arrived to send for their wives and children to follow them on the boats, since it was now clear that they would never be able to come legally. For those just setting out on the journey, the TPV was an incentive for whole families to leave together, so men took wives and children with them, rather than going alone in an endeavour to establish a base first. As Mary Crock and Ben Saul document in their new book Future Seekers, children made up a third of the passengers arriving on the boats in 2001, an increase from around 13 per cent of passengers arriving in two years earlier. The post-Tampa legislation, which included increased restrictions on temporary protection visas, may well encourage a new twist in the people smuggling saga. Rather than delivering their passengers to Ashmore Reef or Christmas Island, and waiting to be spotted by CoastWatch as in the past, the smugglers may now seek to bring asylum seekers all the way to the Australian mainland, since only by arriving there, can they access Australia’s refugee determination procedures. The result would be a longer, more dangerous voyage, added suffering and more lives lost at sea. Another alternative is that people will seek to make it to the mainland, but rather than putting up their hands an asking for asylum on arrival, they may try to evade detection altogether. In other words, they will no longer actively seek to make themselves known to the Australian authorities which enables, quarantine health and security checks to be carried out. This would produce an even more highly criminalised, more violent and more sinister people smuggling trade, with the potential for migrants to end up in a kind of bonded labour until they pay off the cost of their journey. Whatever legal and physical fences Australia erects around its borders, in the longer term the pressure for greater “human mobility” will only grow. One year ago, 14 Mexicans - men and teenagers - died of exposure after trying to cross the Arizona desert to enter the United States. Smugglers had directed them onto a dangerous route known as “The Devil’s Path” in order to avoid stepped up border patrols elsewhere in the state. The Arizona desert itself only became a popular crossing point after stricter border controls were introduced in California and Texas in the 1990 s. As the Economist magazine has commented developed nations “put up stronger barriers and force migrants to more dangerous measures”. The same logic saw 58 Chinese suffocate in the sealed back of a refrigerated truck while trying to cross the English Channel, and two boys from the Congo freeze to death after stowing away in the wheel well of a Brussels bound passenger jet. Unless there is a fundamental rethinking of refugee and migration policy world wide, to open up new, legitimate channels of movement, then we must expect to witness more such tragedies. • Peter Mares is a broadcaster with Radio National and Radio Australia and the author of Borderline: Australia’s Treatment of Refugees and As...|$|R

5000|$|The United States {{rigid airship}} program was based at Lakehurst Naval Air station, New Jersey. [...] {{was the first}} rigid airship {{constructed}} in America, and served from 1923 to 1925, when it broke up in mid-air in severe weather, killing 14 of the crew. [...] was a German airship built for the United States in 1924. The ship was grounded in 1931, due to the Depression, but was not dismantled for over 5 years. The sister ships Akron and Macon both crashed. The Akron was flown into the sea in bad weather and broke up. Over seventy were killed, including one of the US Navy's proponents of airships, Rear Admiral William A. Moffett. Macon also {{ended up in the}} sea when it flew into heavy weather with unrepaired damage from an earlier incident, but the introduction of <b>life-jackets</b> following the loss of the Akron meant only two lives were lost.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the first}} to arrive on the scene was Marcel Gleffe, a German {{resident}} of Ski staying at Utvika Camping on the mainland. Recognizing gunshots, he piloted his boat to the island and began throwing <b>life-jackets</b> to young people in the water, rescuing as many as he could in four or five trips, after which the police asked him to stop. The Daily Telegraph credited him with saving up to 30 lives. Another forty were saved by Hege Dalen and Toril Hansen, a married couple on vacation in the area. Dalen was helping from land while Hansen and a neighbor camper made several trips to rescue people in the water. Several dozen more were rescued by Kasper Ilaug, who made three trips to the island. Ilaug, a local resident, received a telephone call that [...] "something terrible" [...] was happening on Utøya and requesting help. He initially thought the call was a prank, but acted anyway. Altogether, some 150 who swam away from the island were pulled out of the fjord by campers on the opposite shore.|$|E
40|$|The {{maritime}} area dominates the current increasing wave {{of illegal immigration}} to Europe. The Greek islands of the eastern Aegean Sea are the main entrance points of immigrants arriving from the coasts of Turkey. Immigration to the Greek islands is mainly conducted with inflatable boats, which are abandoned upon arrival along the coasts together with other items such as <b>life-jackets,</b> inflatable tubes, and clothing. This novel type of marine litter dominates many beaches and becomes increasingly abundant. Two beaches in Lesvos Island were surveyed for marine litter, and immigration-related items were found to {{account for more than}} 97 % of marine litter by weight. Immigration-related littering adds pressure on marine biodiversity and the local economy, impacting the recreational value of beaches...|$|E
