50|$|Lattice <b>light</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>microscopy</b> aims at {{reducing}} {{the intensity of}} the outer lobes of the Bessel functions by destructive interference. To do so, a two-dimensional lattice of regularly spaced Bessel beams is created.

50|$|Lattice <b>light</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>microscopy</b> can {{be viewed}} as an {{improvement}} of Bessel beam light sheet microscopes in terms of axial resolution (also termed resolution in z). In Bessel beam light sheet microscopes, a non-diffracting Bessel beam is first created then dithered in the x direction in order to produce a sheet. However, the lobes of a Bessel functions carry as much energy as the central spot, resulting in illumination out of the depth of field of the observation objective.|$|E
5000|$|In lattice <b>light</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>microscopy,</b> {{very similar}} to <b>light</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>microscopy</b> the {{illumination}} of the sample occurs perpendicular to the image detection. Initially the light sheet is formed by stretching the linearly polarized circular input beam {{with a pair of}} cylindrical lenses along the x axis and then compressing it with an additional pair of lenses along the z axis. [...] This modification creates a thin sheet of light that is then projected onto a binary ferroelectric spatial light modulator (SLM). The SLM is a device that spatially varies the waveform of a beam of light. The light that is reflected back from the SLM is used to eliminate unwanted diffraction. Diffraction is eliminated by the transform lens that creates a Fraunhofer diffraction pattern from the reflected light at an opaque mask containing a transparent annulus. [...] Optical lattices are two or three dimensional interference patterns, which here are produced by the transparent annular ring. The mask is conjugate to x and z galvanometers. This quality of the microscope is important for the dithered mode of operation, where the light sheet must be oscillated within the x axis.|$|E
50|$|Lattice light-sheet {{microscopy}} is {{a modified}} version of <b>light</b> <b>sheet</b> fluorescence <b>microscopy</b> that increases image acquisition speed while decreasing damage to cells caused by phototoxicity. This is achieved by using a structured <b>light</b> <b>sheet</b> to excite fluorescence in successive planes of a specimen, generating a time series of 3D images which can provide information about dynamic biological processes.|$|R
25|$|<b>Light</b> <b>sheet</b> {{fluorescence}} <b>microscopy</b> or selective plane imaging microscopy (SPIM) uses illumination {{that is done}} perpendicularly to {{the direction}} of observation, by using a thin <b>sheet</b> of (laser) <b>light.</b> Under certain conditions, this illumination principle can be combined with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, to allow spatially resolved imaging of the mobility and interactions of fluorescing particles such as GFP labelled proteins inside living biological samples.|$|R

FRET is visualized in multi-cellular tumor spheroids by <b>light</b> <b>sheet</b> based fluorescence <b>microscopy</b> in combination with microspectral analysis and fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM). Upon application of staurosporine {{and to some extent}} after treatment with phorbol- 12 -myristate- 13 -acetate (PMA), a specific activator of protein kinase c, the caspase- 3 sensitive peptide linker DEVD is cleaved. This results in a reduction of acceptor (EYFP) fluorescence as well as a prolongation of the fluorescence lifetime of the donor (ECFP). Fluorescence spectra and lifetimes may, therefore, be used for monitoring of apoptosis in a realistic 3 -dimensional system, while <b>light</b> <b>sheet</b> based <b>microscopy</b> appears appropriate for 3 D imaging at low light exposure...|$|R
50|$|The multiple-prism {{expanded}} {{laser beam}} is also {{described as an}} extremely elongated laser beam. The elongated dimension of the beam (25-50 mm) is in the plane of propagation while the very thin dimension (in the μm regime) of the beam is in the orthogonal plane. This was demonstrated, for imaging and microscopy applications, in 1993. Alternative descriptions {{of this type of}} extremely elongated illumination include the terms line illumination, linear illumination, thin light sheet illumination (in <b>light</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>microscopy),</b> and plane illumination (in selective plane illumination microscopy).|$|E
50|$|Lattice <b>light</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>microscopy</b> {{is useful}} for in-vivo {{cellular}} localization and super resolution.

Consequently, lattice light sheet is being used {{for a number of}} dynamic cellular interactions. The decrease in phototoxicity has opened doors to study the subcellular processes of embryos without damaging their living tissues.

40|$|Biomedical study {{researchers}} using {{animals to}} model disease and treatment need fast, deep, noninvasive, and inexpensive multi-channel imaging methods. Traditional fluorescence microscopy meets those criteria to an extent. Specifically, two-photon and confocal microscopy, {{the two most}} commonly used methods, are limited in penetration depth, cost, resolution, and field of view. In addition, two-photon microscopy has limited ability in multi-channel imaging. <b>Light</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>microscopy,</b> a fast developing 3 D fluorescence imaging method, offers attractive advantages over traditional two-photon and confocal microscopy. <b>Light</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>microscopy</b> is much more applicable for in vivo 3 D time-lapsed imaging, owing to its selective illumination of tissue layer, superior speed, low light exposure, high penetration depth, {{and low levels of}} photobleaching. However, standard <b>light</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>microscopy</b> using Gaussian beam excitation has two main disadvantages: 1) the field of view (FOV) of <b>light</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>microscopy</b> is limited by the depth of focus of the Gaussian beam. 2) Light-sheet images can be degraded by scattering, which limits the penetration of the excitation beam and blurs emission images in deep tissue layers. While two-sided sheet illumination, which doubles the field of view by illuminating the sample from opposite sides, offers a potential solution, the technique adds complexity and cost to the imaging system. We investigate a new technique to address these limitations: Bessel <b>light</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>microscopy</b> in combination with incoherent nonlinear Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM). Results demonstrate that, at visible wavelengths, Bessel excitation penetrates up to 250 microns deep in the scattering media with single-side illumination. Bessel light sheet microscope achieves confocal level resolution at a lateral resolution of 0. 3 micron and an axial resolution of 1 micron. Incoherent nonlinear SIM further reduces the diffused background in Bessel light sheet images, resulting in confocal quality images in thick tissue. The technique was applied to live transgenic zebra fish tg(kdrl:GFP), and the sub-cellular structure of fish vasculature genetically labeled with GFP was captured in 3 D.

40|$|<b>Light</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>microscopy</b> {{facilitates}} rapid, high contrast, {{volumetric imaging}} with minimal sample exposure. However, the rapid divergence {{of a traditional}} Gaussian light sheet restricts the field-of-view that provides innate sub-cellular resolution. We show that the accelerating Airy beam innately yields high contrast and resolution up to a ten-fold larger field-of-view. In contrast to the Bessel beam which also provides an increased field-of-view, the Airy beam’s characteristic asymmetric excitation pattern results in all fluorescence contributing positively to the contrast, enabling a step change for <b>light</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>microscopy.</b> <b>Light</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>microscopy</b> facilitates high contrast, volumetric imaging with minimal sample exposure by using two objectives placed orthogonally to one another that perform the tasks of excitation and detection.
