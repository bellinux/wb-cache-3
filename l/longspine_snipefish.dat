50|$|The <b>longspine</b> <b>snipefish</b> {{feeds on}} {{crustacean}} zooplankton such as copepods and ostracods, {{as well as}} benthic invertebrates.|$|E
50|$|<b>Longspine</b> <b>snipefish</b> are reddish pink dorsally {{but have}} silvery bellies. They {{have a large}} eye, long snouts and a slender spine {{protruding}} dorsally.|$|E
50|$|The <b>longspine</b> <b>{{snipefish}},</b> bellowfish, common bellowsfish, snipe-fish, snipefish, spine trumpet fish, or trumpetfish, Macroramphosus scolopax, is a snipefish of {{the genus}} Macroramphosus. It {{is also known as}} the slender snipefish off the South African coast.|$|E
50|$|In the Azores fish made {{up all of}} {{the diet}} and the most {{important}} species in the diet of Sphyraena viridensis was the bluejack mackerel Trachurus picturatus being found as having been preyed upon by 72.4% of the fish sampled and making up nearly two thirds of the weight of prey taken. Other species taken in this study included single examples of bogue Boops boops, ornate wrasse Thalassoma pavo and axillary sea bream Pagellus acarnae, as well as an unidentified species of the Exocoetidae. Unidentofied fish remains were found in nearly 20% of the specimens sampled. In the same study the predatory behaviour of S.viridensis was observed and they are active pursuit predators of fish with one or many barracudas pursuing fish, either singling out lone prey or attacking shoals of prey fish. The pursuit was rapid and was usually over in 8-40 seconds and the more fish were involved the higher the rate of success was. In these observations other fish species than those sampled from specimens were observed as prey e.g. <b>longspine</b> <b>snipefish</b> Macrorhamphosus scolopax and boar fish Capros aper. It is also known to feed on cephalopods and crustaceans.In summer they form schools of up to 180 fish, although most schools number 30-40 fish, in areas where there are strong currents. These schools are predominantly made up of sub-adult fish with the smaller fish nearer to the surface and the larger, usually female, fish {{at the bottom of the}} school at depths of up to 30m. In winter the only aggregations are small groups of juveniles in shallow bays. No territorial behaviour was observed. Schooling is thought to be an anti predator defence and to facilitate mating with the smaller males being attracted to the larger females, in addition groups of barracudas were more successful in hunting prey fish than single fish. This species does not appear to mix with other barracuda species in mixed schools but there are reports of these fish associating with whale sharks in the Azores and an instance of them actively swimming towards a manta ray Mobula tarapacana.|$|E
40|$|The feeding {{behaviour}} of two potentially competing species, the <b>longspine</b> <b>snipefish,</b> Macroramphosus scolopax, and the boarfish Capros aper was examined. While both species are very abundant along the Mediterranean coast and are regularly caught by demersal trawlers, {{they are of}} no commercial value. The diets of boarfish and <b>longspine</b> <b>snipefish</b> were investigated from samples collected between January 2001 and May 2002. Variations in the diet with fish size and season, as well as diet overlap and diversity were explored. Mysid shrimps, amphipods and gastropods {{were the most important}} food items in the diet of <b>longspine</b> <b>snipefish.</b> During ontogenetic development, M. scolopax occupies different trophic levels: the diet shifts from being predominantly composed of mysids (Anchialina agilis, Lophogaster typicus, Erythrops sp., Leptomysis spp.) in the smaller <b>longspine</b> <b>snipefish</b> [ 6. 5 cm TL). Crustacean decapods and copepods were the most important prey in the stomachs of boarfish. Mysids (Lo. typicus), euphausiids and nematodes were present in the larger individuals (> 8 cm TL). A more generalist diet, still containing copepods, crustacean decapods, gastropods (Limacina retroversa) and a large variety of amphipods (e. g. Phtysica marina, Stenotoe bosphorana) and mysids (e. g. A. agilis, Leptomysis spp., Erythrops sp.), dominated the diet of C. aper between 2 and 8 cm TL. Diet overlap between <b>longspine</b> <b>snipefish</b> and boarfish was very low and the differences in stomach species diversity were explained by season and fish size...|$|E
