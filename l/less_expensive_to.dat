5|$|As {{they share}} many {{cross-platform}} games and {{compete for the}} same audience as their predecessors, frequent comparisons are made between the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The PS3 uses the Blu-ray format, while the Xbox 360 uses a standard DVD9. The Xbox 360 is <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> produce, and analysts expect that a mid-revision will allow Microsoft to break-even on manufacturing costs, while industry consensus is that the Xbox 360's conventional architecture is easier to develop for.|$|E
5|$|The MSR was an S-band passive {{electronically}} scanned array (PESA), {{unlike the}} actively scanned MAR. A PESA system cannot (normally) generate multiple signals like AESA, but is much <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> build because a single {{transmitter and receiver}} {{is used for the}} entire system. The same antenna array can easily be used for both transmitting and receiving, as the area behind the array is much less cluttered and has ample room for switching in spite of the large radio frequency switches needed at this level of power.|$|E
5|$|The Northrop F-20 Tigershark (initially F-5G) was {{a privately}} financed light fighter, {{designed}} and built by Northrop. Its development began in 1975 as a further evolution of Northrop's F-5E Tiger II, featuring a new engine that greatly improved overall performance, and a modern avionics suite including a powerful and flexible radar. Compared with the F-5E, the F-20 was much faster, gained beyond-visual-range air-to-air capability, and had a full suite of air-to-ground modes capable of firing most U.S. weapons. With these improved capabilities, the F-20 became competitive with contemporary fighter designs such as the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, but was much <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> purchase and operate.|$|E

5|$|In 1958, American International Pictures founders James H. Nicholson and Samuel Z. Arkoff hired European talent agent Flavio Lucisano to {{look for}} Italian {{commercial}} films for them after the large success of the Italian feature Hercules (1958). In February 1963, American International Pictures {{made a deal with}} the Italian film production company Galatea that they would contribute to a minimum of nine co-productions in the next eight years. Black Sabbath follows many production trends of Italian films of the era. These co-productions were influenced by the lack of large film stars in Italy. To avoid high costs or larger stars, producers created anthology films involving three or four short narratives whose combined running time was that of a regular feature film, as in Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow (1963). A second trend was to match an up-and-coming actor or a much older actor with a European ingenue actress, as in Spy in Your Eye which paired Pier Angeli and Dana Andrews. The third trend was the move towards making Westerns and horror films which were <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> produce than the previous sword and sandal films.|$|E

25|$|CuproBraze is an {{alternative}} to soldered copper/brass plate fin, soldered copper brass serpentine fin, and brazed aluminium serpentine fin. The technology enables brazed copper serpentine fins {{to be used in}} copper-brass heat exchanger designs. These are <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> manufacture than soldered serpentine fin designs. They are also stronger, lighter, more durable, and have tougher joints.|$|E
25|$|However, {{one of the}} {{concerns}} with all CT scanners, both EBT and perhaps more so with the spiral scanners (which are more commonly used because they are <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> purchase), is the dose of X-Ray delivered to the patient’s body and concerns about the safety of repeated doses of X-Ray to track disease status over time.|$|E

25|$|Typically, the IF center {{frequency}} fIF is {{chosen to be}} less than the desired reception frequency fRF. The choice has some performance advantages. First, it is easier and <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> get high selectivity at a lower frequency. For the same bandwidth, a tuned circuit at a lower frequency needs a lower Q. Stated another way, for the same filter technology, a higher {{center frequency}} will take more IF filter stages to achieve the same selectivity bandwidth. Second, it is easier and <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> get high gain at a lower frequency. When used at high frequencies, many amplifiers show a constant gain–bandwidth product (dominant pole) characteristic. If an amplifier has a gain–bandwidth product of 100MHz, then it would have a voltage gain of 100 at 1MHz but only 10 at 10MHz. If the IF amplifier needed a voltage gain of 10,000, then it would need only two stages with an IF at 1MHz but four stages at 10MHz.|$|E
25|$|Current sensors which {{monitor the}} power consumed, and {{maintain}} the connection only if the demand is within a predetermined range. Sensor wires react more quickly, have fewer parts to fail and are possibly <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> design and implement. Current sensors however can use standard connectors and can readily provide an option for suppliers to monitor or charge for the electricity actually consumed.|$|E
25|$|On May 1, 2014, Aeroports de Montréal {{confirmed}} that Mirabel Airport's terminal building would be demolished, citing its {{high maintenance cost}} as a reason, {{as well as its}} facilities being unfit for commercial aviation needs and lacking any economic viability. Several reports suggested that it would simply be <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> rebuild a new terminal if passenger service ever returned to Mirabel.|$|E

25|$|The bubble top on the KR200 was {{simplified}} {{over that}} of the KR175 {{by the use of}} a larger curved glass windshield that formed A-pillars with the side window frames. This allowed the bubble to be simpler and more compact than the KR175 bubble, and it was consequently easier and <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> produce. The windshield wiper, manual on the KR175, was electric on the KR200.|$|E
25|$|The Chinese {{inventor}} Bi Sheng made {{movable type}} of earthenware circa 1045, {{but there are}} no known surviving examples of his printing. Around 1450, in what is commonly regarded as an independent invention, Johannes Gutenberg invented movable type in Europe, along with innovations in casting the type based on a matrix and hand mould. This invention gradually made books <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> produce, and more widely available.|$|E
25|$|The gearing {{supplied}} by the manufacturer on a new bicycle is selected to be useful {{to the majority of}} people. Some cyclists choose to fine-tune the gearing to better suit their strength, level of fitness, and expected use. When buying from specialist cycle shops, it may be <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> get the gears altered before delivery rather than at some later date. Modern crankset chainrings can be swapped out, as can cogsets.|$|E

25|$|The {{electrical}} equivalent can {{be constructed}} with a few operational amplifiers (op amps) and some passive linear components; all measurements can be taken directly with an oscilloscope. In the circuit, the (simulated) 'stiffness of the spring', for instance, can be changed by adjusting the parameters of a capacitor. The electrical system is an analogy to the physical system, hence the name, but it is <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> construct, generally safer, and typically much easier to modify.|$|E
25|$|Circa 2005 the Israeli Air Force {{purchased}} five Gulfstream G550-based Eitam {{aircraft to}} serve as the new IDF platform for its newer generation of AEW systems. The new aircraft use the EL/W-2085 dual-band sensor suite, and are more capable and <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> operate than the older Boeing 707-based EL/M-2075. Extensive modifications were made to the Gulfstream's fuselage by IAI, such as the addition of protruding composite radomes, to house the radar arrays in conformal body modifications. Based at Nevatim Airbase.|$|E
25|$|For an {{extended}} period of time—prewar through the early 1950s—the Pontiac was a quiet, solid car, but not especially powerful. It came with a flathead straight eight. Straight 8s were slightly <b>less</b> <b>expensive</b> <b>to</b> produce than the increasingly popular V8s, but they were also heavier and longer. Additionally, the long crankshaft suffered from excessive flex, restricting straight 8s to a relatively low compression ratio with a modest redline. However, in this application, inexpensive (yet very quiet) flatheads were not a liability.|$|E
