5|$|The song {{begins with}} a {{distinctly}} Vivaldian style, as the fast tempo and classical-style chord progression anticipates the lyrics to follow. The opening chords and the melody emphasize the tonic of the leading notes: Fm–E–D–Cm–D–E–Fm–D–E–Fm, resembling a Baroque work. This {{is followed by the}} sound of dance music, produced by a powerful beat from the instruments. Madonna's vocal range spans from F3 to C5, and has a different sound from her previous work, more mature, centered, and with a <b>lower</b> <b>range.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor in}} the Mellotron's sound is that the {{individual}} notes were recorded in isolation. For a musician accustomed to playing in an orchestral setting, this was unusual, and meant that they had nothing against which to intonate. Noted cellist Reginald Kirby refused to downtune his cello to cover the <b>lower</b> <b>range</b> of the Mellotron, and so the bottom notes are actually performed on a double bass. According to Mellotron author Nick Awde, one note of the string sounds contains {{the sound of a}} chair being scraped in the background.|$|E
5|$|The work {{is written}} {{for a large}} cast—thirty roles {{including}} small choruses of heavenly beings, sirens and Phaecians—but these parts can be organised among fourteen singers (three sopranos, two mezzo-sopranos, one alto, six tenors and two basses) by appropriate doubling of roles. This approximates to the normal forces employed in Venetian opera. In the score, the role of Eumete changes midway through Act II from tenor to soprano castrato, suggesting that the surviving manuscript may have been created {{from more than one}} source. In modern performances the latter part of Eumete's role is usually transposed to a <b>lower</b> <b>range,</b> to accommodate the tenor voice throughout.|$|E

25|$|The {{compensating}} euphonium {{is common}} among professionals. It utilizes a three-plus-one-valve system with three upright valves and one side valve. The compensating valve system uses extra tubing, usually coming {{off of the}} back of the three upright valves, in order to achieve proper intonation in the <b>lower</b> <b>range</b> of the instrument. This range being from E2 down to B1. Not all four-valve and three-plus-one-valve euphoniums are compensating. Only those designed with extra tubing are compensating. There were, at one time, three-valve compensating euphoniums available. This configuration utilized extra tubing, just as the three-plus-one compensating models did, in order to bring the notes C2 and B1 in tune. This three-valve compensating configuration is still available in British style baritone horns, usually on professional models.|$|E
25|$|The {{range of}} the marimba has been {{gradually}} expanding, with companies like Marimba One adding notes up to F above the normal high C (C7) on their 5.5 octave instrument, or marimba tuners adding notes lower than the low C on the 5 octave C2. Adding lower notes is somewhat impractical; as the bars become bigger and the resonators become longer, the instrument must be taller and the mallets must be heavier {{in order to produce}} a tone rather than just a percussive attack. Adding higher notes is also impractical because the hardness of the mallets required to produce the characteristic tone of a marimba are much too hard to play with in almost any other, <b>lower</b> <b>range</b> on the instrument.|$|E

25|$|The {{input to}} a belt press filter is {{generally}} measured as {{the rate of}} dry solids loading (mass of dry solids per time per belt width). Again, the input solids loading {{is dependent on the}} sludge type and filter media, thus there is great variation in the dry solids loading rates of operating belt press filters. Typically, <b>lower</b> <b>range</b> solids loading rates fall in the range of 40–230kg/h/m belt width and high range solids loading rates fall in the range of 300–910kg/h/m belt width. Whilst loading is important for measuring production rate, {{it is also important to}} consider the thickness of the cake that forms in the gravity drainage section. Cake thickness affects the permeability of the filtration media and the filtration rate. Testing for the particular sludge type must be conducted to determine the optimum cake thickness. In some cases where filtrate recovery is important, it may be necessary to introduce a cake washing step.|$|E
25|$|In 1966, Kath {{joined a}} cover band called the Missing Links, taking Parazaider and Seraphine with him, and started playing clubs and ballrooms in Chicago {{on a regular}} basis. Parazaider's friend at De Paul University, trumpeter Lee Loughnane, also sat in with the band from time to time. Kath's compatriot, James William Guercio (who later became Chicago's producer) was lead guitarist {{in one of two}} road bands {{performing}} on The Dick Clark Show with the Missing Links. Kath received an offer from Guercio to play bass for the Illinois Speed Press and move to Los Angeles, but declined as he considered the guitar his main instrument and wanted to sing lead. He stayed with Parazaider, Seraphine, and Loughnane instead, who quickly recruited trombonist James Pankow from De Paul and vocalist/keyboardist Robert Lamm. Kath sang the <b>lower</b> <b>range</b> of lead vocals in the group in a style reminiscent of Ray Charles. The group practiced at Parazaider's parents' basement and changed its name to The Big Thing. With the addition of singer and bassist Peter Cetera of The Exceptions, they moved to Los Angeles and signed with Columbia Records, renaming the band Chicago Transit Authority. In mid-1969, the name was shortened to Chicago.|$|E

The <b>Lower</b> Himalayan <b>Range</b> runs from north of Rawalpindi through Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and further south. The mountains are relatively young, and are eroding rapidly. The Indus and the five rivers of the Punjab have their sources in the mountain range and carry loam, minerals and silt down to the rich alluvial plains, which consequently are very fertile.|$|R
500|$|Iolanthe was {{followed}} by Princess Ida (1884), in which Bond {{played the role of}} Melissa. [...] Bond played the role of Constance in the first revival of The Sorcerer (1884–85). [...] The role had originally been written for a soprano, and some of the music was transposed down to suit Bond's <b>lower</b> <b>range</b> and tessitura. Another feature of this revival was the pairing of Bond's character with that of Rutland Barrington's. [...] The combination was so successful that in later Savoy operas, Bond and Barrington were generally paired together.|$|E
500|$|A {{challenge}} {{of a different}} kind was the cover version of Gary Moore's [...] "Over the Hills and Far Away" [...] (2001), as it required a deeper voice, far below the vocal range of an average soprano. In an interview with Breakout magazine, she reported that in the studio, the band members were shaken by a paroxysm of laughter as she tried to warm up for the vocal lines. As a side benefit of her efforts, Turunen gradually expanded her vocal range considerably into the <b>lower</b> <b>range,</b> which manifested even more on the following albums.|$|E
500|$|Venusian {{clouds are}} thick and are {{composed}} mainly (75-96%) of sulfuric acid droplets.

"Don't Forget About Us" [...] {{garnered}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics, though many compared it to, and felt it shared several similarities with Carey's previous single, [...] "We Belong Together".

[...] Additionally, Lamb commented that although not as [...] "strong" [...] as [...] "We Belong Together", the song was marginally better than another single from The Emancipation of Mimi, [...] "Shake It Off". Billboards Michael Paoletta drew heavy comparisons to [...] "We Belong Together", noting the song's similar tempo, lyrical style, instrumentation and vocal stamp. He commented that although [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] was [...] "satisfying" [...] on its own, it suggested that Carey had hit a creative wall.

[...] Reviewers from The New Yorker and Music Week were both taken aback by the single, calling it [...] "beautiful" [...] and [...] "gentle", respectively.
