40|$|Interdisciplinary {{cooperation}} as {{an option}} flows from a fundamental adjustment of public thinking in the country, and from the belief that it could possibly contribute to the dynamic survival of smaller departments under the threat of rationalisation. Several initiatives during the 1980 s, especially from the HSRC, serve {{as a foundation for}} future planning. While not implying the disappearance of individual departments, interdisciplinary work does require a sharing of common experiences and a greater interaction between departments. It also implies the raising of the status of secondary sources, including translations of literary works. As an international vehicle, English could serve as common medium in interdisciplinary interaction. While neighbouring departments are free to devise their own programmes, preference should be given to national priorities, such as South African spoken <b>language</b> <b>and</b> historical-comparative <b>literary</b> <b>studies.</b> The need for training for comparative work, coordination, adequate funding, professional liaison and lobbying, may compel <b>language</b> <b>and</b> literature associations to federate in an umbrella body, especially {{in the wake of the}} rationalisation of the Institute for Research into <b>Language</b> <b>and</b> the Arts at the HSRC...|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that the biblical account of Israel’s past {{consists}} of diverse generic, thematic and ideological elements, between which inconsistencies and tensions sometimes arise. This phenomenon is defined as ‘scriptural complexity’. From early times this complexity has been treated by source or redaction criticism; currently, canonical-theological <b>and</b> <b>literary</b> approaches are employed. This thesis adopts a Bakhtinian ‘dialogic’ approach to <b>languages</b> <b>and</b> <b>literary</b> voice, to <b>study</b> the ‘scriptural complexity’ {{in the book of}} Exodus, especially the narrative in chaps. 12 - 14 and the inserted song in chap. 15. After introducing the ‘scriptural complexity’ and the possible methods of dealing with it (Chapter 1), and the life and the concept of dialogism of Bakhtin (Chapter 2), the Bakhtinian concepts will be adopted and applied to the book of Exodus. A survey of the voices of the ‘speaking person’ in the book will be conducted, and the Passover instructions in Exodus 12 will be used as a test case to illustrate what results from a dialogic reading of the biblical text (Chapter 3). Based on this, a dialogic reading of the narrative of the Israelites crossing the Sea (Chapter 4) and the Song of the Sea (Chapter 5) will be performed. The voice of the narrator in the narrative of the Israelites’ crossing of the Sea will also be studied (Chapter 6). The reading shows that several different ‘voices’ are involved in the transmission of the tradition, and these represent a dialogue between different possible ideologies. This dialogue re-accentuates the authoritative voice of YHWH such that it allows later generations to participate truly and dialogically in the observance of the traditions. Exploring the multiple and complex dialogic relationships between the various voices indicates that the narrative in the Exodus events foregrounds the characters’ voices, and allows them to interact dialogically. It results in an enriched and multilayered understanding of the role of each ‘voice’ in the story. The exploration of the dialogic relationship between the singing voices of the inserted song and the narrative voices also enables the reader to understand and respond to the implicit significance of YHWH’s action in the narrative. Analysis of the Bakhtinian concept of ‘authoring’ also suggests that the narrator’s voice represents the authorial voice of the biblical narrative. By bestowing form to the verbal material, this authorial voice leads the reader to participate in a dialogue between the various voices and to co-author the values and significance according to various ‘dialogizing backgrounds’. This thesis argues that it is beneficial to read the biblical discourse as utterance with ‘voices’ rather than mere text, so that the reader can re-enter the once uttered discourse and participate in a living dialogue through the ‘scriptural complexity’. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{essay in}} {{modified}} form was presented on {{invitation to the}} Third Black Afrikaans Writers' Symposium (2005). It recounts the author's experiences {{that gave rise to}} the first symposium twenty years earlier. The relevance of black solidarity to the post- 1976 generation of Black Afrikaans writers is explored within the context of similar national and international debates in the 1970 s and 1980 s. The author argues that through the process of self-naming Black Afrikaans writers opened up possibilities of rethinking the place, role and contribution of black speakers of Afrikaans. In the past Afrikaner nationalism propagated a monolithic perception of the Afrikaans language. Through its influence on Afrikaans <b>language</b> <b>and</b> <b>literary</b> <b>studies</b> the presence and contribution of black speakers were actively played down or silenced. The essay concludes with remarks on the re-negotiation of South African identities and the search for a broader Afrikaans ('n ruimer Afrikaans) ...|$|E
40|$|This {{innovative}} volume {{provides a}} comprehensive integrated {{account of the}} study of conceptual figures, demonstrating the ways in which figures and in particular, conflictual figures, encapsulate linguistic expression in the fullest sense and in turn, how insights gleaned from their study can contribute to the wider body of linguistic research. With a specific focus on metaphor and metonymy, the book offers a unified and systematic typology of linguistic figures, drawing on a number of different approaches, including both traditional and emerging frameworks within cognitive linguistics as well as syntactic theory, while also providing an exhaustive look at the unique features of a variety of conceptual figures, including metaphor, metonymy, oxymoron, and synecdoche. In its aim of reconciling historically opposed theoretical approaches to the study of conflictual figures while also incorporating a thorough account of its distinctive varieties, this volume will be essential reading for researchers and scholars in cognitive linguistics, theoretical linguistics, philosophy of <b>language,</b> <b>and</b> <b>literary</b> <b>studies...</b>|$|E

40|$|Human preferences, {{practices}} and actions {{are the main}} drivers of global environmental change in the 21 st century. It is crucial, therefore, to promote pro-environmental behavior. In order to accomplish this, {{we need to move}} beyond rational choice and behavioral decision theories, which do not capture the full range of commitments, assumptions, imaginaries, and belief systems that drive those preferences and actions. Humanities disciplines, such as philosophy, history, religious studies, gender studies, <b>language</b> <b>and</b> <b>literary</b> <b>studies,</b> psychology, and pedagogics do offer deep insights into human motivations, values, and choices. We believe that the expertise of such fields for transforming human preferences, {{practices and}} actions is ignored at society’s peril. We propose an agenda that focuses global humanities research on stepping up to the challenges of planetary environmental change. We have established Environmental Humanities Observatories through which to observe, explore and enact the crucial ways humanistic disciplines may help us understand and engage with global ecological problems by providing insight into human action, perceptions, and motivation. We present this Manifesto as an invitation for others to join the “Humanities for the Environment” open global consortium of humanities observatories as we continue to develop a shared research agenda...|$|E
40|$|Abstract It is {{now widely}} {{recognized}} that promotionalism permeates scholarly discourse. Yet a systematic account of {{rhetorical and linguistic}} means, which researchers across disciplines deploy to achieve this effect, is still to be developed. The present thesis attempts {{to contribute to the}} investigation of strategies and exponents of the promotional (meta) discourse in the humanities. In particular, it compares and contrasts research articles in <b>language</b> <b>and</b> <b>literary</b> <b>studies</b> published in North American academic journals during 2001 - 2006. This inquiry demonstrates that in both disciplines scholars utilize two rhetorical strategies to publicize their work: first, positive evaluation of one’s own study and of those investigations in which the current study is grounded and second, negative evaluation of dissenting views. A combination of both strategies is used to widen the gap between one’s contribution and (erroneous) alternative treatments. Among lexicogrammatical and discourse devices employed in both disciplines are evaluative lexis reinforced by derivational and inflectional morphology, coordination, comment clauses, personal pronouns, lexical cohesion, and discourse chunks sequencing. Distribution of promotional elements across article sections and moves in the two disciplines, however, differs. On the whole, the thesis reconfirms the advantage of specificity in teaching academic literacies advocated by many applied linguists and provides actual patterns that can be incorporated into writing curriculum...|$|E

The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the Tonal NRG (previously known as the Tonal Action) of the Lessac Approach as a voice-building tool for the female voice in theatre. It provides an overview of existing scholarly writings on the pedagogical, physiological and acoustical qualities of the Lessac Approach. It reflects on current literature about the characteristics of good voice quality and especially the actor's formant. The empirical research on voice building in this study demonstrates that a randomised pre/post test/control group quasi-experimental design was used and is fourfold in dimension: it deals with a control group, a test group with 14 contact hours, a test group with 28 contact hours and a test group who had an extensive six-week workshop. Other variables that are reflected on are language, teacher and training methodology specificity. Investigative procedures include a questionnaire, various means of acoustic analysis and a perception panel. Where applicable, inferential statistics were done on the data. Results of the investigation are compared with existing, parallel research outputs. This study indicates very strongly that the Tonal NRG of the Lessac Approach influences the female voice positively irrespective of language, teacher and training methodology specific parameters.

40|$|Thesis (M. A. (Applied <b>Language</b> <b>and</b> <b>Literary</b> <b>Studies))</b> [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006 This {{dissertation}} attempts a Bakhtinian {{analysis of}} the polyphonic dialogue between Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now, Karel Schoeman's Na die Geliefde Land and Jason Xenopoulos' Promised Land. Specific Bakthinian concepts are employed {{to determine whether the}} films are "apt" adaptations of the literary texts; how the stylistically hybrid texts engage in conversation with different movements, genres and trends; how the polyphonic conversations between different texts and discourses, such as literature and film, or colonialism and postcolonialism, can provide insight into the variety of discourses, textual and ideological, of a postcolonial, post-apartheid South Africa; and how identity crises experienced by key characters can be explained using the notions of hybridity, "The Marginal Man" and liminality. All four texts have key characters that experience identity crises that spring from cultural hybridity; their cultural hybridity has the potential to either render them marginally stagnant or lead them to liminally active participation within their imagined communities. This dissertation argues that even though there are major differences between the films and the literary texts they are based upon, they are relevant to a specific target audience and therefore enrich the ur-texts. Salient characteristics of realism, symbolism, impressionism, modernism, postmodernism, postcolonialism and the apocalyptic dialogise one another within the four texts, thereby liberating the texts from one authorial reading. The dialogue between the discourses of literature and film supplement an understanding of the dialogue between war, imperialism, colonialism, postcolonialism and the Will to Power. Master...|$|E
40|$|In {{the rapidly}} {{evolving}} context of contemporary Europe many citizens have previous experience of colonial, or neo-colonial, forms of domination. This {{raises questions about}} the impact of such experiences on the shaping of identities within an environment that is itself constantly evolving. How do such people see themselves and their community? How are they perceived? What effect does this have on their integration into the wider European community? This timely volume brings together a series of papers which explore such questions through the discourse relating to those people, both self- and other-generated. The originality of this book stems not only from its thematic focus but also from the multi-national, multi-disciplinary background of the contributions which offer new interpretations and analyses, in particular within a framework of post-colonial and critical discourse theory. Contributors from across Europe and North America bring perspectives from applied linguistics, <b>language</b> <b>and</b> <b>literary</b> <b>studies,</b> communication studies, sociology, and social psychology. Primary texts examined include literature, news media, film, political discourse, both written and spoken, and original interview data. Language is observed both in its usage and for its participatory role in identity formation. Three different groupings are identified for observation, namely: 1) migrant diasporas originating from the traditional areas of European colonisation in Africa and Asia; 2) citizens of newer member states of the European Union, including former Soviet satellite states like Latvia, or aspiring members, like Turkey; and 3) a number of regional groups (Irish, Welsh), whose relationship with the central government shares neo-colonial characteristics. The book is intended for all those interested in understanding the factors influencing the rapidly evolving character of Europe and its populations, and is intended to form a platform for future exploration and research in this area...|$|E
