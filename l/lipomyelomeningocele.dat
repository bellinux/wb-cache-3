50|$|There are {{two types}} of NTDs: open, which are more common, and closed. Open NTDs occur when the brain and/or spinal cord are exposed at birth through a defect in the skull or {{vertebrae}} (back bones). Examples of open NTDs are anencephaly, encephaloceles, hydranencephaly, iniencephaly, schizencephaly, and spina bifida. Rarer types of NTDs are called closed NTDs. Closed NTDs occur when the spinal defect is covered by skin. Common examples of closed NTDs are <b>lipomyelomeningocele,</b> lipomeningocele, and tethered cord.|$|E

This study was undertaken to determine the frequency of ophthalmic problems {{in a series of}} 45 patients consisting of 28 myelomeningocele cases and 17 <b>lipomyelomeningocele</b> cases. It was investigated whether the frequency of ophthalmic complications change according to the type of the spinal dysraphism and to coexisting hydrocephalus. MethodsThe ophthalmological testing and examination protocol included visual acuity measurements, ocular motility and alignment evaluation, cycloplegic retinoscopy and autorefraction, and the examinations of external eye, anterior segment, lens, vitreous cavity and fundus. ResultsThe statistical analysis of our series demonstrated that the risk of amblyopia was significantly higher in patients with myelomeningocele compared to patients having <b>lipomyelomeningocele.</b> Coexistent hydrocephalus was shown to increase the risk of amblyopia in children with spinal dysraphism. Also ophthalmic examinations revealed a higher rate of amblyopia in children who have experienced cerebrospinal fluid shunt revisions for coexisting hydrocephalus.

40|$|International audienceBackground: Congenital spinal lipomas {{are closed}} spinal dysraphisms {{belonging}} to the neural tube defects (NTDs) group. They include {{a broad spectrum of}} lesions ranging from simple lipomas of the filum terminale to complex malformations. On histological evaluation, various tissue components of ectodermal, mesodermal or endodermal origin are found within the lipomas, with prevalence for nerves and striated muscle and, more rarely, cartilage and bone. Overall, rib malformations have been occasionally observed in patients with NTDs and in NTD mouse models. However, an ectopic rib arising within the spinal lipoma and articulating with the iliac crest has not been reported in either animal models or in humans. Cases: We describe four patients affected by lipomyeloschisis or <b>lipomyelomeningocele,</b> with an unusual fibrocartilaginous protuberance arising within the lipoma and connecting to one iliac crest, strongly resembling an ectopic rib. Histological evaluation confirmed the presence of cartilaginous tissue. Conclusion: We expand the clinical spectrum of fibrocartilaginous anomalies associated with spinal lipoma, suggesting the presence of an ectopic rib as a new possible phenotype in NTDs. A careful analysis by neuroradiologists and pathologists should be performed in spinal lipomas to assess the presence of an ectopic rib or other uncommon developmental anomalies. Furthermore, molecular studies are required to detect the genetic cause of this unusual phenotype...|$|E

Therefore, we performed this study to define the characteristics of patients in Taiwan with spinal dysraphism. MethodsPatients diagnosed with a myelomeningocele or <b>lipomyelomeningocele</b> were identified from the database of our spinal dysraphism multidisciplinary clinic. A cross-sectional study was conducted by telephone interview and retrospective chart review. Clinical characteristics, such as neurologic level, orthopedic deformities, assistive device use, and level of ambulation, were collected. Spearman's correlation (r) tests were performed between ambulation or neurologic level and other variables. ResultsSeventy-eight subjects {{were included in the}} current study. Subjects with myelomeningoceles had more severe neurologic involvement, poorer ambulation outcome, and higher rates of orthopedic deformities, assistive device use, lower hand function, and bowel/bladder dysfunction. The correlation test revealed that the level of ambulation was negatively influenced by a higher neurologic level, a history of shunt placement, and various orthopedic deformities. Neurologic level also had widespread influence on history of shunt placement, orthopedic deformities, assistive device use, the need for additional assistive devices, aggressiveness of assistive devices, and bowel/bladder dysfunction.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionWe {{encountered}} a rare case of tubular adenoma developing after bladder augmentation. We here report our case {{as well as}} summarize reports {{in the literature on}} adenomas developing after bladder augmentation. Presentation of caseA 23 -year-old man came to our hospital for routine surveillance cystoscopy. He was born with a <b>lipomyelomeningocele</b> and neurogenic bladder with low bladder compliance, and hence his bladder was routinely emptied by clean intermittent catheterization. He was also treated with anticholinergic agents. However, because the patient’s neurogenic bladder was unstable, he underwent sigmoidocolocystoplasty when he was 8 -years old. After the bladder augmentation, he was examined annually by surveillance cystoscopy. On cystoscopy, a 5 -mm pedunculated polyp was found on the front side of the sigmoid colon cap. Therefore, we performed snare polypectomy together with electrocoagulation under cystoscopy. The patient’s final diagnosis was tubular adenoma (mild atypia) with no malignancy, as assessed by histopathology. There has been no evidence of recurrence after the polypectomy on routine surveillance cystoscopy. DiscussionTo the best of our knowledge, there have been 11 cases of adenoma occurring after bladder augmentation reported in the literature, including our present case. There are several carcinogenic pathways associated with colorectal oncogenesis. Adenomas that are larger than 1. 0 cm in diameter with a marked villous component have a high risk of oncogenesis. ConclusionWe believe that the early detection of carcinoma or adenoma and their treatment at an early stage is crucial. Therefore, we recommend routine surveillance cystoscopy for patients after bladder augmentation...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUNDThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the development and early implementation of a national spina bifida (SB) patient registry, the goal of which is to monitor the health status, clinical care, and outcomes of people with SB by collecting and analyzing patient data from comprehensive SB clinics. METHODSUsing a web-based, SB-specific electronic medical record, 10 SB clinics collected health-related information for patients diagnosed with myelomeningocele, <b>lipomyelomeningocele,</b> fatty filum, or meningocele. This information was compiled and de-identified for transmission to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for quality control and analysis. RESULTSA total of 2070 patients were enrolled from 2009 through 2011 : 84. 9 % were younger than 18 years of age; 1095 were women; 64. 2 % were non-Hispanic white; 6. 5 % were non-Hispanic black or African American; and 24. 2 % were Hispanic or Latino. Myelomeningocele was the most common diagnosis (81. 5 %). CONCLUSIONSThe creation of a National Spina Bifida Patient Registry partnership between the CDC and SB clinics has been feasible. Through planned longitudinal data collection and the inclusion of additional clinics, the data generated by the registry will become more robust and representative of the population of patients attending SB clinics in the United States and will allow for the investigation of patient outcomes.

A high-risk group (HRG) was determined consisting of 40 patients with a <b>lipomyelomeningocele</b> and/or a split cord malformation sometimes in combination with a tight filum terminale. The surgical procedure was a detethering operation in all cases performed by a single surgeon during a 9 -year period (1999 - 2008). A standard set-up of IONM was used in all patients consisting of motor-evoked potentials (MEP) evoked by transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) and electrical nerve root stimulation.

40|$|PURPOSE: Patients with {{tethered}} {{spinal cord}} {{have been investigated}} for short-term effects after tethered spinal cord surgery in the past. However, {{little is known about}} the long-term effects in this patient group. In this retrospective, longitudinal, observational study, a patient sample of a previous report of 65 patients was reassessed to observe the long-term effects of intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring-assisted tethered cord surgery. METHODS: With the use of patient charts and a survey, patients were scored on four domains: (1) neurological deficits, (2) urological deficits, (3) pain symptoms, and (4) orthopedic deficits. Measurements were performed at four moments in time: (1) preoperatively, (2) postoperatively, (3) follow-up 1 (4. 6 years), and (4) follow-up 2 (11. 2 years). Besides this, a subgroup analysis and a quality of life questionnaire were performed. RESULTS: When observing the symptom domains in the long-term, the pain domain appeared to improve most postoperatively after which it remained stable over time. The neurological and urological domains showed a stable, slightly decreasing trend in the long-term follow-up. The orthopedic domain showed a significant increase of the number of patients with scoliosis during the long-term follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Lasting effects of stability in the neurological, urological, and pain domains were observed. Close monitoring during follow-up might contribute to early recognition of progressive scoliosis, in spite of detethering, in a risk group defined by females who underwent tethered cord surgery at or under the age of 12 years old with either <b>lipomyelomeningocele,</b> split cord malformation, or myelomeningocele.

40|$|The authors {{conducted}} a study to evaluate the risks and short-term benefits of surgical treatment for tethered cord syndrome (TCS) in patients older than 18 years of age. The authors studied a series of 57 consecutive adult patients with TCS of varying origins. Patients were examined by the same neurologist in a standardized fashion before and after surgery, and most were followed for at least 2 years postoperatively. Patient age ranged from 19 to 75 years. The mean age at onset of symptoms and diagnosis was 30 years and 37 years, respectively. Muscle strength improved (15 cases) or showed no change postoperatively (38 cases) in {{a large majority of}} patients (93 %). In four patients a minor decrease in muscle strength was demonstrated, and there was significant deterioration in two (3. 5 %). In the two latter patients, a rapid decline in motor function was present preoperatively. Subjective assessment of pain, gait, sensory function, and bladder/bowel function at 4 weeks, 6 months, and 2 years postsurgery revealed improvement in a substantial percentage of patients. No major surgery-related complications occurred. This is the largest series to date in which adult patients with TCS comprise the report. Untethering procedures in these patients were safe and effective, {{at least in the short}} term. Patients with rapid loss of motor function, <b>lipomyelomeningocele,</b> or split cord malformation seem to be at a higher risk of postsurgery deterioration.

Department of Neurosurgery, University Medical Centre Groningen, The Netherlands Purpose: The value of intra operative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) during surgical detethering operations in dysraphic patients has been questioned. Aspects of its technical feasibility in young patients {{and its potential}} contribution to improvement of safety of the procedure have been discussed. A retrospective analysis of our series of 65 patients is presented with special focus on technical set-up and outcome. Methods: All patients were diagnosed with a Tethered Cord (TC) due to spinal dysraphism. A High Risk Group (HRG) was determined consisting of 40 patients with a <b>lipomyelomeningocele</b> (LMC) and or a split cord malformation (SCM) sometimes in combination with a tight filum terminale (TFT). The surgical procedure was a detethering operation in all cases performed by a single surgeon during a nine years period (1999 - 2008). A standard set-up of IONM was used in all patients consisting of motor evoked potentials evoked by transcranial electrical stimulation (TES-mMEP) and electrical nerve root stimulation. In young patients conditioning stimulation was applied {{in order to improve}} absent or weak mMEPs. Results: IONM responses could be obtained in all patients. Post-operative deterioration of symptoms was found in two patients of whom one patient belonged to the HRG.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} functional {{outcome in}} {{two groups of}} children with sacral level paralysis: myelomeningocele (MMC) versus <b>lipomyelomeningocele</b> (LMMC). Additionally both groups were compared {{with each other and}} when possible with reference values. Design: Cross-sectional study by means of (1) clinical assessment, and (2) disability measurement. Setting: Spina bifida outpatient clinic at a university hospital in the Netherlands. Subjects: Sample of 30 children with MMC and 14 with LMMC. Mean age (SD) 6. 0 (4. 9) and 8. 4 (4. 9) years respectively. Main measures: Muscle strength, ambulation level, motor performance (Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID) and Movement Assessment Battery for Children), and the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI). Results: The majority of patients in both groups were normal ambulant, 14 / 21 (67 %) in MMC and 9 / 14 (64 %) in LMMC. Ambulation was strongly associated with muscle strength of hip abductors (odds ratio (OR) : 13. 5, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 2. 5 - 73. 7), and ankle dorsal-flexor muscles (OR: 110, 95 % CI 8. 9 - 135. 9). No significant differences were found in lesion and ambulation level. Muscle strength and motor performance were significantly lower in the MMC group than in the LMMC group (p < 0. 05). PEDI scores were comparable in both groups. Most problems were noted in mobility skills and caregiver assistance in self-care, especially regarding bladder and bowel management. Conclusions: Gross motor and functional problems were seen in both groups. The MMC group showed more muscle weakness and motor problems. However, in both groups caregiver assistance was needed for a prolonged period, especially regarding bladder and bowel management.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} neurosurgical untethering on the lower urinary tract and male sexual function, in patients with tethered spinal cord. Thirty-six children with tethered spinal cord due to neurospinal dysraphism were assessed clinically and urodynamically before and after surgical untethering. Sexual function was evaluated in 14 boys before and after neurosurgery. In young boys, the assessment was by parental observation and was considered normal if erections had been observed regularly, or if the child had mentioned having an erection at any time. Older patients were asked if they had achieved voluntary erections {{and whether or not they}} were able to ejaculate. The mean follow-up was 91 months and the mean follow-up after neurosurgery was 34 months. A lasting improvement of urinary tract function occurred in only one patient, while another became worse. Seven children had temporary changes of bladder/sphincter function; two developed detrusor overactivity with sphincter dyssynergia and five had signs of bladder denervation. Long-term follow-up showed no permanent changes of lower urinary tract function in 94 % of 34 patients. Sexual function was considered normal in 13 boys. One boy apparently gradually lost erectile ability before untethering and regained it after surgery, while another boy had erectile dysfunction post-operatively for almost 6 months. Changes in bladder-sphincter function after untethering are usually transient and often the result of partial denervation. Although a small group of children seem to benefit from untethering, others can become worse and the individual outcome cannot be predicted.
