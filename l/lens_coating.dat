Zeiss also pioneered glass coating, and before the war coated lenses were offered. After <b>lens</b> <b>coating</b> became universal post WW2, designers were given more freedom in using extra air-to-glass surfaces in correcting lens aberrations, without fear of the ill effects of surface reflections.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{generation}} of Pentax K-mount lenses. Officially not referred to a K series lenses, they usually are given this designation to distinguish them from later K-mount lenses (such as the M, A, F, FA and DA series).

There was a switch on the lens to select [...] "Auto" [...] or [...] "Manual" [...] modes. In manual mode, the lens would always be in the selected aperture. In Auto mode, the lens would remain wide open (at maximum aperture) until a pin on {{the rear of the}} lens was pushed in.

50|$|Lenses did {{not need}} a great depth of field, but had to be capable both of {{producing}} a very sharp image with high resolution of a flat surface and of doing so at high speed.

5000|$|Second-generation FD lenses, first marketed in 1981 as New FD, {{are mounted}} like bayonet-mount lenses {{in that the}} {{photographer}} twists the entire lens body to mount and dismount, though the actual mating surfaces still remain fixed.

The letters SC or SSC to indicate the <b>lens</b> <b>coating</b> were no longer put on the lenses. Canon documents stated that All new FD lenses except for the new FD 50mm F1.8 had SSC coatings. Canon later chose a bayonet-style mount for its EOS system's EF lenses, where there is no precision mechanical coupling.|$|E
50|$|While very sharp, early {{versions}} of the lens suffered from flare due to its many air-to-glass surfaces. Before the introduction of <b>lens</b> <b>coating</b> technology the four-element Tessar, with slightly inferior image quality, was preferred due to its better contrast. In the 1950s, when effective anti-reflective lens coatings became available, coated Planars were produced with much-improved flare resistance. These lenses used the Zeiss T coating system, which had been invented by Olexander Smakula in 1935. They performed very well as normal and medium-long focus lenses for small and medium format cameras. One of the most notable Planar lenses is the high-speed 2.0/110 mm lens for the 2000- and 200-series medium format Hasselblad cameras.|$|E

40|$|Background: Wearing {{spectacles}} is {{the most}} common approach in correcting the refractive errors worldwide. Due to harmful effects of overexposure to solar ultraviolet radiations, the usage of multi-layer coatings in ophthalmic lenses has recently been increased. These lenses can reduce the reflections and hence increase the transmission of visible light; they can also decrease the transmission of ultraviolet rays. This study aims to compare the transmission of ultraviolet (A and B) and visible rays through coated and uncoated prescriptive ophthalmic plastic lenses. M aterials and Methods: In this study, 39 minus non-photochromic multi-coated white plastic single-vision lenses; 9 similar lenses but without any coatings were assessed by spectral transmittancemeter for evaluation of the transmission of visible and ultraviolet rays. R es ults: The transmission of visible light was 97. 9 %± 1. 07 % for <b>coated</b> <b>lenses</b> and 93. 5 %± 0. 54 % for <b>lenses</b> without <b>coating.</b> Ultraviolet-A transmission was 12. 15 %± 8. 02 % for <b>coated</b> <b>lenses</b> compared to 66. 27 %± 23. 92 % in <b>lenses</b> without <b>coating.</b> The transmission of ultraviolet-B rays was 1. 21 %± 0. 4 % and 23. 0 %± 15. 97 % for lenses with and without coatings, respectively. C onclusion: The transmission of visible light was significantly higher in multi-coated lenses compared to uncoated samples; whereas the transmissions of ultraviolet rays in multi-coated lenses were significantly lower than uncoated ones. Therefore, it is recommended that, except for particular cases, prescribed lenses be equipped with this multi-layer coating. </p...|$|R
40|$|While {{knowledge}} about standardization of skin protection against ultraviolet radiation (UVR) has progressed {{over the past}} few decades, there is no uniform and generally accepted standardized measurement for UV eye protection. The literature provides solid evidence that UV can induce considerable damage to structures of the eye. As well as damaging the eyelids and periorbital skin, chronic UV exposure may also affect the conjunctiva and lens. Clinically, this damage can manifest as skin cancer and premature skin ageing as well as the development of pterygia and premature cortical cataracts. Modern eye protection, used daily, offers the opportunity to prevent these adverse sequelae of lifelong UV exposure. A standardized, reliable and comprehensive label for consumers and professionals is currently lacking. In this review we (i) summarize the existing literature about UV radiation-induced damage to the eye and surrounding skin; (ii) review the recent technological advances in UV protection by means of lenses; (iii) review the definition of the Eye-Sun Protection Factor (E-SPF®), which describes the intrinsic UV protection properties of lenses and <b>lens</b> <b>coating</b> materials based on their capacity to absorb or reflect UV radiation; and (iv) propose a strategy for establishing the biological relevance of the E-SPF. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT- PURPOSE: Since when alkylphospholipds (ALPs) were {{discovered}} and, even further after miltefosine’s {{approval for the}} treatment of cutaneous metastasis of breast cancer and leishmaniasis, their activity against many other diseases have been extensively studied. This review aims to provide a summary of the alkylphospholipids ’ applications investigated so far. RESULTS: The mechanism of action of ALPs is not fully understood, however it is believed that they interfere with lipid homeostasis leading to cell apoptosis. Due to ALPs cytotoxic activity, this class of molecules has shown to be effective against many diseases and conditions. Besides the approval of miltefosine for application in cutaneous metastasis of breast cancer and visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis, several other analogs have proved efficacy and are promising as less toxic alternatives. ALPs have also shown in vitro and in vivo activity against Trypanosoma spp., amoebae, Tricomonas vaginalis, Schistosoma mansoni, HIV, and some fungi and bacteria species. The use of ALPs for intraocular <b>lens</b> <b>coating</b> is also under investigation. In addition, a clinical trial comparing miltefosine with usual treatments to spontaneous urticaria is also being conducted. CONCLUSIONS: Alkylphospholipids present such a broad pharmacological spectrum that justifies the need for further investigations of the drug class mechanisms of action, as well as the search for new analogs with improved activity and toxicological profiles.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} {{the ability of}} fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 2 -saporin to prevent lens regrowth in the rabbit. METHODS: Chemically conjugated and genetically fused FGF 2 -saporin (made in Escherichia coli) were used. Extracapsular extraction of the lens {{was performed on the}} rabbit, and the cytotoxin either was injected directly into the capsule bag or was administered by FGF 2 -saporin-coated, heparin surface-modified (HSM) polymethylmethacrylate intraocular lenses. The potential of the conjugate was checked by slit lamp evaluation of capsular opacification and by measuring crystallin synthesis. Toxin diffusion and sites of toxin binding were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Possible toxicity was determined by histologic analysis of ocular tissues. RESULTS: FGF 2 -saporin effectively inhibited lens regrowth when it was injected directly into the capsular bag. However, high concentration of the toxin induced transient corneal edema and loss of pigment in the iris. Intraocular <b>lenses</b> <b>coated</b> with FGF 2 -saporin reduced lens regrowth and crystallin synthesis without any detectable clinical side effect. After implantation, FGF 2 -saporin was shown to have bound to the capsules and, to a lesser extent, to the iris; no histologic damage was found on ocular tissues as a result of implantation of drug-loaded HSM intraocular lenses. CONCLUSIONS: Chemically conjugated (FGF 2 -SAP) and genetically fused FGF 2 -saporin (rFGF 2 -SAP) bound to HSM intraocular lenses can prevent lens regrowth in the rabbit...|$|R
