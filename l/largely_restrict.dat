50|$|The Al Fattan Marine Towers is {{a complex}} in the Dubai Marina section of Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The towers are located within Jumeirah Beach Residence, a 40-tower, 7,000 unit {{residential}} and hotel development which runs alongside Dubai Marina. The Al Fattan Marine Towers consist of two twin 50-story towers, the Al Fattan Tower, and the Oasis Beach Tower, consisting of serviced and residential apartments which have since been sold to individual investors and homeowners. Both towers stand at a height of 245 m (804 ft) and a roof height of 230 m (755 ft), and are the tallest buildings in Jumeirah Beach Residence. Construction of both towers was completed in 2006. Following completion the developer, Al Fattan Properties LLC built a 12-storey office and retail building on an adjacent plot between the towers and Dubai Marina restricting views of the marina from the towers. In 2012 Al Fattan commenced construction of two high-rise towers {{on the beach in}} front of the towers which will <b>largely</b> <b>restrict</b> seaviews from Al Fattan Marine Towers. Al Fattan had earlier demolished a 10-story hotel on the site, the Oasis Hotel, which it had built about a decade earlier. Originally Al Fattan proposed to build a mega 97-tower building on the site to be called Burj Al Fattan, however a subsequent decision was made to split the development into two high-rise towers. The exact number of floors is not known as there has been no public disclosure of the project.|$|E

With Zersetzung one can influence hostile and negative individuals across different operational political activities, especially the hostile and negative aspects of their dispositions and beliefs, so these are abandoned and changed little by little, and, if applicable, the contradictions and differences between the hostile and negative forces would be laid open, exploited, and reinforced.The goal of Zersetzung is the fragmentation, paralysis, disorganization, and isolation of the hostile and negative forces, in order to preventatively impede the hostile and negative activities, to <b>largely</b> <b>restrict,</b> or to totally avert them, and if applicable to prepare the ground for a political and ideological reestablishment.Zersetzung is equally an immediate constitutive element of [...] "operational procedures" [...] and other preventive activities to impede hostile gatherings. The principal forces to execute Zersetzung are the unofficial collaborators. Zersetzung presupposes information and significant proof of hostile activities planned, prepared, and accomplished as well as anchor points corresponding to measures of Zersetzung.Zersetzung must be produced {{on the basis of a}} root cause analysis of the facts and the exact definition of a concrete goal.

[2013]). This limitation would <b>largely</b> <b>restrict</b> potential mutation sites in genome editing. Therefore, we tested the stringency of the nucleotide on the first position. A 20 -nt sequence beginning with ‘A’ was selected and was marked as the target- 3 (Additional file 2 : Figure S 1). The gene targeting was performed with the binary vector containing pSpCas 9. Among 96 independent transgenic lines, we identified 2 mutants (Additional file 4 : Figure S 3), suggesting that the ‘G’ is not absolutely required on the first position of the target sequence driven by the U 6 promoter.|$|E

40|$|Magnetic {{reconnection}} is {{an important}} process that occurs at the magnetopause boundary of Earth's magnetosphere because it leads to transport of solar wind energy into the system, driving magnetospheric dynamics. However, the nature of magnetopause reconnection {{in the case of}} Saturn's magnetosphere is unclear. Based on a combination of Cassini spacecraft observations and simulations we propose that plasma βconditions adjacent to Saturn's magnetopause <b>largely</b> <b>restrict</b> reconnection to regions of the boundary where the adjacent magnetic fields are close to anti-parallel, severely limiting the fraction of the magnetopause surface that can become open. Under relatively low magnetosheathβconditions we suggest that this restriction becomes less severe. Our results imply that the nature of solar wind-magnetosphere coupling via reconnection can vary between planets, and we should not assume that the nature of this coupling is always Earth-like. Studies of reconnection signatures at Saturn's magnetopause will test this hypothesis...|$|E

This method of tightly integrating evolution into the MCTS algorithm means that evolutionary adaptation occurs on a much faster time-scale than has previously been achieved, and addresses a particular problem with MCTS which frequently occurs in real-time video and control problems: that uniform random roll-outs may be uninformative. Results are presented on the classic Mountain Car reinforcement learning bench-mark and also on a simplified version of Space Invaders. The results clearly demonstrate the value of the approach, significantly outperforming “standard” MCTS in each case. Furthermore, the adaptation is almost immediate, with no perceptual delay as the system learns: the agent frequently performs well from its very first game. ...|$|E

While the wave heights on the Lake of C. obey the Raleigh distribution, wave heights in the laboratory resemble the Gaussian distribution. Contrary to natural waves, laboratory waves often appear in groups. Laboratory waves represent a quasi regular system with randomized wave heights. Wave shape analysis revealed that laboratory waves are much more steep than natural waves. Laboratory waves almost reach the limit steepness according to the criterium by Miche. Laboratory wave spectra are very narrow, and the energy is concentrated {{in the region of}} the dominating frequency. Lake surface waves are characterized by a much broader distribution and a more pronounced directional behaviour.

40|$|The {{susceptibility}} of millimeter waveform propagation to blockages may <b>largely</b> <b>restrict</b> {{the coverage}} of mmWave signals. To overcome blockages, we propose to leverage two-hop device-to-device (D 2 D) relaying. Using stochastic geometry, we derive expressions for the downlink coverage probability of a relay-assisted mmWave cellular network when the D 2 D links (from relays to destinations) are implemented in either the mmWave or microwave band. For mmWave links, we derive the coverage probability using dominant interferer analysis while accounting for both blockages and beamforming gains. For microwave D 2 D links, with the Rayleigh fading assumption, we derive the coverage probability considering different path loss models for line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) links. Numerical {{results suggest that the}} downlink coverage of a mmWave cellular network can be improved by enabling two-hop D 2 D relay transmissions. In most situations, microwave D 2 D relays achieve better coverage than mmWave D 2 D relays because microwave D 2 D links can be established under NLOS conditions; however, mmWave D 2 D relays achieve better coverage when the density of interferers is large because their antenna arrays reject interference from off-boresight directions and blockages eliminate interference from NLOS interferers...|$|E

40|$|Nucleoside analogues, used in HIV-therapy, {{need to be}} {{phosphorylated}} by cellular enzymes {{in order}} to become potential substrates for HIV reverse transcriptase. After incorporation into the viral DNA chain, because of lacking of their 3 '-hydroxyl groups, they stop the elongation process and lead to the death of the virus. Phosphorylation of the HIV-drug derivative, tenofovir monophosphate was tested with the recombinant mammalian nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK), 3 -phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), creatine kinase (CK) and pyruvate kinase (PK). Among them, only CK was found to phosphorylate tenofovir monophosphate with a reasonable rate (about 45 -fold lower than with its natural substrate, ADP), while PK exhibits even lower, but still detectable activity (about 1000 -fold lower compared to the value with ADP). On the other hand, neither NDPK nor PGK has any detectable activity on tenofovir monophosphate. The absence of activity with PGK is surprising, since the drug tenofovir competitively inhibits both CK and PGK towards their nucleotide substrates, with similar inhibitory constants, K(I) of 2. 9 and 4. 8 mM, respectively. Computer modelling (docking) of tenofovir mono- or diphosphate forms to these four kinases suggests that the requirement of large-scale domain closure for functioning (as for PGK) may <b>largely</b> <b>restrict</b> their applicability for phosphorylation/activation of pro-drugs having a structure similar to tenofovir monophosphate...|$|E

40|$|One {{function}} of the Grid is to support collaborative science projects on the internet. While some projects {{may be able to}} operate with little or no security provided by the infrastructure, major projects have significant security requirements. Shared data or data in transit may be highly sensitive and will almost certainly need guarantees that it hasn’t been tampered with or seen by unauthorised persons.

40|$|There can {{be little}} doubt that social {{practices}} and culture a↵ect language; the interesting question is: in what concrete ways is linguistic form and structure shaped by culture, and what are the processes by which culture does so? One approach, culture-driven grammaticalization theory (Simpson 2002, Evans 2003), suggests that cultural influence on linguistic form is mediated by the development of conventionalized communicative practices that increase the frequency of particular lexical items, constructions, and pragmatic inferences in discourse, thereby putting in place a crucial pre-condition for their grammaticalization. The goal of this chapter is to contribute to the development of culture-driven grammaticalization theory by developing an account of the cultural basis for the grammaticalization of quotative evidentials in Nanti, an Arawak language of lowland southeastern Peru. In particular, I argue that Nanti quotative evidentials grammaticalized from inflected verbs of speaking that achieved high discourse frequencies due to the emergence of communicative practices that link respectful communicative conduct towards others with the avoidance of speculation about others’ actions and internal states. As part of this communicative practice, Nantis <b>largely</b> <b>restrict</b> their discussion of others’ actions and internal states to two domains: reported speech regarding others’ actions and internal states, and actions that they witnessed themselves, which can also serve to index internal states...|$|E
40|$|In modern {{tracking}} systems {{the ability to}} obtain high quality, high resolution appearance of the tracked target is often highly desirable. However, the reality of operational deployment often means that imaging systems deployed for this task suffer from limitations reducing effective image quality. These limitations {{can be attributed to}} a range of causes such as low quality video sensors, system noise, high target dynamics and other environmental noise factors. Despite the advantages of the super-resolution techniques the problem of handling complex motion still remains a challenging task for the effective super-resolution implementation. The computational complexity and large memory requirements required for the implementation of super-resolution imaging <b>largely</b> <b>restrict</b> the usage of these techniques in real-time hardware implementations. In order to improve visual quality of the tracked target and overcome these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective solution that integrates a super-resolution imaging approach based on combination of the Sum of the Absolut Differences (SAD) and gradient-descent motion estimation techniques into a novel tracking approach. In addition, the proposed approach demonstrates robustness in improved target appearance modeling that assists the overall tracking system. The presented results demonstrate this significant improvement in visual target representation whilst tracking over high dynamic scenes. The implementation simplicity of the proposed approach makes it an attractive solution for realization on low power hardware. Such a system can be deployed on small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) or other hardware where size, weight and power (SWaP) is of a particular concern...|$|E
40|$|Air-breathing fish of the Anabantoidei group {{meet their}} {{metabolic}} requirements for oxygen through both aerial and aquatic gas exchange. Siamese fighting fish Betta splendens are anabantoids that frequently engage in aggressive male-male interactions which cause {{significant increases in}} metabolic rate and oxygen requirements. These interactions involve opercular flaring behaviour that is thought to limit aquatic oxygen uptake, and combines {{with the increase in}} metabolic rate to cause an increase in air-breathing behaviour. Air-breathing events interrupt display behaviour and increase risk of predation, raising the question of how Siamese fighting fish manage their oxygen requirements during agonistic encounters. Using open-flow respirometry, we measured rate of oxygen consumption in displaying fish to determine if males increase oxygen uptake per breath to minimise visits to the surface, or increase their reliance on aquatic oxygen uptake. We found that the increased oxygen requirements of Siamese fighting fish during display behaviour were met by increased oxygen uptake from the air with no significant changes in aquatic oxygen uptake. The increased aerial oxygen uptake was achieved almost entirely by an increase in air-breathing frequency. We conclude that limitations imposed by the reduced gill surface area of air-breathing fish restrict the ability of Siamese fighting fish to increase aquatic uptake, and limitations of the air-breathing organ of anabantoids <b>largely</b> <b>restrict</b> their capacity to increase oxygen uptake per breath. The resulting need to increase surfacing frequency during metabolically demanding agonistic encounters has presumably contributed to the evolution of the stereotyped surfacing behaviour seen during male-male interactions, during which one of the fish will lead the other to the surface, and each will take a breath of air.
