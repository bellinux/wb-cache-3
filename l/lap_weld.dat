Friction stir welding {{has been}} shown by {{previous}} investigators to have many advantages over traditional metal joining practices. Friction stir lap welds and friction stir spot welds {{have been shown to}} be stronger than rivets when joining materials of the same thickness. Substructures containing continuous lap welded joints have demonstrated increased load carrying capabilities over their riveted counterparts. In full-scale structures, however, continuous welds are not always an option. Welds may be interrupted by fixturing limitations, tooling restrictions, or stiffening members that cross the weld path. In these situations, a discontinuous <b>lap</b> <b>weld</b> would be necessary. The principal problem with a discontinuous weld is that the tool plunge and exit locations cannot be eliminated with a run-off tab, as in continuous welded structures. These plunge and exit locations are then subjected to operational loads. In fatigue applications, it has been demonstrated that cracks will initiate in the exit hole of a discontinuous weld. The purpose of this study was to investigate techniques to terminate a <b>lap</b> <b>weld</b> without compromising the structure by leaving an unprotected exit hole...|$|E

"The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to develop and {{validate}} finite element models of the friction stir welding process for butt and lap welds for specific experimental cases that in effect enhances the predictability of temperature evolution in the joined workpiece. Significant {{research has been conducted}} on butt weld thermal process but limited study has been conducted on lap welds. Through examination of several process parameters critical to both weld and <b>lap</b> <b>weld</b> operations insights into process characterization of process parameters could be made. In this study three dimensional finite element heat transfer models using the commercial code LSDYNA were developed to obtain the temperature distribution in the workpiece for two types of welds, namely butt joints and lap joints. For the <b>lap</b> <b>weld</b> model a step function for thermal conductance between sheets was applied to account for varying contact resistance. The developed finite element models were validated with published experimental data. Parametric studies were performed involving both types of welds including process parameters such as tool travel rate and rotational tool velocity for different aluminium alloys...|$|E
40|$|Whilst coating {{automotive}} body steels with zinc has {{a beneficial}} {{effect on their}} corrosion properties it can give significant problems when individual panels are subsequently welded to form the body shell. This work shows that a pulsed Nd:Yag laser {{can be used as}} a precleaning tool to locally remove the zinc and then as a spot welding device to join 2 sheets in a <b>lap</b> <b>weld</b> configuration. Laser spot welding can produce joints having adequate strength at a range of conditions but the localised nature of the heat input can produce damage on the top surface, this is often not acceptable in structures such as a an automotive body shell. In this work, conditions have been identified which are capable of precleaning the area to be welded and able to produce welds having adequate strength with cosmetically acceptable surfaces...|$|E

However, thermal joining of steel and aluminum is still being researched, due to a limited solubility of the binary system of iron and aluminum causing the formation of hard and brittle intermetallic phases, which decrease the strength and the formability of the dissimilar seam.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{investigate}} methods of implementing in-process fault avoidance in robotic {{friction stir welding}} (FSW). Design/methodology/approach – Investigations into the possibilities for automatically detecting gap-faults in a friction stir <b>lap</b> <b>weld</b> were conducted. Force signals were collected {{from a number of}} lap welds containing differing degrees of gap faults. Statistical analysis was carried out to determine whether these signals could be used to develop an automatic fault detector/classifier. Findings – The results demonstrate that the frequency spectra of collected force signals can be mapped to a lower dimension through discovered discriminant functions where the faulty welds and control welds are linearly separable. This implies that a robust and precise classifier is very plausible, given force signals. Research limitations/implications – Future research should focus on a complete controller using the information reported in this paper. This should allow for a robotic friction stir welder to detect and avoid faults in real time. This would improve manufacturing safety and yield. Practical implications – This paper is applicable to the rapidly expanding robotic FSW industry. A great advantage of heavy machine tool versus robotic FSW is that the robot cannot supply the same amount of rigidity. Future work must strive to overcome this lack of mechanical rigidity with intelligent control, as has been examined in this paper.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the classification and effect of cold <b>lap</b> <b>weld</b> defect onthe fatigue strength of a welded structure. Cold lap is a type of weld defect whichoccurs when molten metal does not completely fuse with the cold plate surface. Thisproduces a crack like defect, often very small, which is parallel to the plate. The coldlap weld defect has been classified into three types namely spatter, overlap andspatter-overlap cold lap. Study showed that all three types of cold lap defects have thecorresponded lack of fusion in the interface, which could be considered as initialmacro cracks in different shapes where a possible fatigue crack growth could start. Fatigue life assessment of the above mentioned three types of cold lap defects wascarried out using finite element and crack growth analysis in 2 D and 3 D. In the 2 Danalysis the cold lap defects were modeled as line crack (assuming a/c= 0). Based onthe experiments the cold lap defects were visualized as having two probable crackshapes; penny shaped and part through, which required 3 D crack growth analysis. Results showed that in 2 D analysis the three types of cold lap defects have sameinfluence on fatigue life of the weld. In 3 D analysis, the shape of the cold lap defectsdid not show any difference in fatigue life. Overall penny shaped and part throughcracks in 3 D analysis predicted 1. 75 times longer fatigue life as compared to line crackin 2 D analysis...|$|E

40|$|In this study, the {{influence}} of various operating parameters of pulsed Nd:YAG laser on the welding of stainless steel material is investigated. The effects of laser peak power, pulse duration, focus point position, number of laser pulse shots and angle of incidence on the weld width and weld penetration depth are analyzed. The laser micro welding is performed using a Unitek Miyachi LW 10 E ultra compact flash lamp pulsed Nd:YAG laser system with a maximum peak power of 3. 5 kW. The effects of various pulsed Nd:YAG laser welding parameters on weld pool development are studied by making individual spot welds carefully along the prepared specimens. Then, the weld pool is examined by using a Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) to characterize its microstructure. The composition of material before and after welding is analyzed by using an Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX). The weld width and penetration depth are visualized and captured by using an optical microscope equipped with Charge Couple Devices (CCD) video camera, which is interfaced with image processing system. From the captured image, the Matrox Inspector 2. 1 software is {{used to measure the}} weld width and weld penetration depth. A laser power of 3. 5 kW with pulse duration of 2. 5 kW produces weld width and penetration depth of 0. 57 mm and 1. 31 mm, respectively. A mathematical model of penetration depth has been developed. The mathematical model is able to describe the effect of laser beam penetration inside stainless steel material. When the laser beam is incident onto the surface of the material, a fraction of the beam is reflected and the remainder is absorbed into the material. For the time independent laser beam penetration, the power decreases according to the first order of the Bessel function along the radius and drops exponentially with the depth. At a depth of 1. 00 mm, the power reduces to 0. 17 kW at the central axis of the weld. The tensile strength of the weld joint is measured using an INSTRON Series IX/s Automated Materials Tester System. The measurement is performed for the butt and <b>lap</b> <b>weld</b> joint with crosshead speed of 0. 2 mm/min. The tensile strength for single spot butt weld joint is 22. 96 MPa and 6. 90 MPa for the lap joint. From the outcome, butt joint provides stronger attachment than the lap joint. In conclusion, pulsed Nd:YAG laser spot micro welding produces good welding on stainless steel and this is a promising technique for miniature assemblies technology such as in photonics packaging...|$|E
