40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to explore the {{dynamics}} of regional <b>labour</b> <b>markets</b> in terms of migration flows. In particular, the study explores the impact of <b>labour</b> <b>markets</b> and housing markets on migration. The internal and the external re-organisations of regional <b>labour</b> <b>markets</b> are shown to be related. An increase in internal turnover within establishments in regional <b>labour</b> <b>markets</b> is found to increase net-migration. This effect arises mainly from a reduction in out-migration. Housing markets constitute binding constraints for migration flows through housing prices and the share of owner-occupancy housing. The results imply that an increase in regional housing prices and a large share of owner-occupancy housing discourages net-migration to a region by reducing inmigration. The out-migration rate remains largely unaffected by housing markets. Dynamics of regional <b>labour</b> <b>markets,</b> housing, migration flows, panel data...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{studies the}} use of <b>labour</b> <b>markets</b> to {{mitigate}} the impact of violent shocks on households in rural areas in Colombia. We examine changes in the labour supply from on-farm to off-farm labour {{as a means of}} coping with the violent shock and the ensuing redistribution of time within households. We also identify the heterogeneous response by gender. Because the incidence of violent shocks is not exogenous, we use instrumental variables which capture several dimensions of the cost of exercising terror. As a response to the violent shocks, households decrease the time spent on on-farm work and increase their supply of labour to off-farm activities (i. e., non-agricultural ones). Men carry the bulk of the adjustment in {{the use of}} time inasmuch as they supply the most hours to off-farm nonagricultural work and formal <b>labour</b> <b>markets.</b> <b>Labour</b> <b>markets</b> are not fully absorbing the additional labour supply. Women in particular are unable to find jobs in formal <b>labour</b> <b>markets</b> and men have increased time dedicated to leisure and household chores. Additional off-farm supply is not fully covering drops in consumption. Our results suggest that in rural Colombia, <b>labour</b> <b>markets</b> are a limited alternative for coping with violent shocks. Thus, policies in conflict-affected countries should go beyond short-term relief and aim at preventing <b>labour</b> <b>markets</b> from collapsing and at supporting the recovery of agricultural production...|$|R
