40|$|AbstractObjective: This {{study was}} aimed at {{analyzing}} the degree of intercostal nerve impairment in posterolateral and muscle-sparing thoracotomy and at correlating the nerve damage to the severity of <b>long-lasting</b> postthoracotomy <b>pain.</b> Methods: Neurophysiologic recordings were performed 1 month after either posterolateral or muscle-sparing thoracotomy to assess {{the presence of the}} superficial abdominal reflexes (mediated in part by the intercostal nerves), the somatosensory-evoked responses after electrical stimulation of the surgical scar, and the electrical thresholds for tactile and pain sensations of the surgical incision. Results: The patients who underwent a posterolateral thoracotomy showed a higher degree of intercostal nerve impairment than the muscle-sparing thoracotomy patients as revealed by the disappearance of the abdominal reflexes, a larger reduction in amplitude of the somatosensory-evoked potentials, and a larger increase of the sensory thresholds to electrical stimulation for both tactile perception and pain. In addition, these neurophysiologic parameters were highly correlated to the postthoracotomy pain experienced by the patients 1 month after surgery, indicating a causal role for nerve impairment in the <b>long-lasting</b> postoperative <b>pain.</b> Conclusions: This study shows {{for the first time the}} pathophysiologic differences between posterolateral and muscle-sparing thoracotomy and suggests that the minor <b>long-lasting</b> postthoracotomy <b>pain</b> in muscle-sparing thoracotomy patients is partly due to a minor nerve damage.

Object: Does spinal {{manipulation and}} supervised exercise in combination with cognitive behavioural therapy have an effect on <b>long-lasting</b> low back <b>pain?</b> Materials and method: In this study, single subject study design (SSED) was used, and two participants were included. The intervention was spinal manipulation followed by supervised exercise with cognitive behavioural strategy. Eight treatments were given over a period of four weeks. The outcome measurement was Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) for pain, Roland Morris Questionnaire (RMQ) and Back Performance Scale (BPS) for function, and COOP/WONCA for health related quality of life. The test was preformed at baseline, after the intervention period and at three months follow-up. Result: After treatment both patients had reduced pain and improvement in function, and the improvement was of clinical importance in NPRS and RMQ. Only the woman had a result that was clinical important in BPS. Small differences were found in COOP/WONCA for both patients, but the woman had the greatest change in quality of life.

40|$|We {{recently}} {{showed that}} <b>long-lasting</b> muscle <b>pain,</b> induced by intramuscular infusion of hypertonic saline, evoked two patterns of cardiovascular responses across subjects: one group showed parallel increases in muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), blood pressure, and heart rate, {{while the other}} group showed parallel decreases. Given that MSNA is consistent day to day, we tested the hypothesis that individuals who show increases in MSNA during experimental muscle pain will show consistent responses over time. MSNA was recorded from the peroneal nerve, together with blood pressure and heart rate, during an intramuscular infusion of hypertonic saline causing pain for an hour in 15 subjects on two occasions, 2 - 27 weeks apart. Pain intensity ratings {{were not significantly different}} between the first (5. 8 ± 0. 4 / 10) and second (6. 1 ± 0. 2) recording sessions. While four subjects showed significant decreases in the first session (46. 6 ± 9. 2 % of baseline) and significant increases in the second (159. 6 ± 8. 9 %), in 11 subjects, there was consistency in the changes in MSNA over time: either a sustained decrease (55. 6 ± 6. 8 %, n = 6) or a sustained increase (143. 5 ± 6. 1 %, n = 5) occurred in both recording sessions. There were no differences in pain ratings between sessions for any subjects.

40|$|Purpose: Postoperative {{radiotherapy}} decreases {{breast cancer}} mortality. However, studies have revealed a <b>long-lasting</b> breast <b>pain</b> among some women after radiotherapy. The {{purpose of this}} study was to identify risk factors that contribute to breast pain after breast cancer radiotherapy. Methods and Materials: We identified 1, 027 recurrence-free women in two cohorts of Swedish women treated for breast cancer. The women had breast-conserving surgery and postoperative radiotherapy, the breast was treated to 48 Gy in 2. 4 -Gy fractions or to 50 Gy in 2. 0 -Gy fractions. Young women received a boost of up to 16 Gy. Women with more than three lymph node metastases had locoregional radiotherapy. Systemic treatments were given according to health-care guidelines. Three to 17 years after radiotherapy, we collected data using a study-specific questionnaire. We investigated the relation between breast pain and potential risk modifiers: age at treatment, time since treatment, chemotherapy, photon energy, fractionation size, boost, locoregional radiotherapy, axillary surgery, overweight, and smoking. Results: Eight hundred seventy-seven women (85 %) returned the questionnaires. Among women up to 39 years of age at treatment, 23. 1 % had breast pain, compared with 8. 7 % among women older than 60 years (RR 2. 66; 95 % CI 1. 33 - 5. 36). Higher age at treatment (RR 0. 96; 95 % CI 0. 94 - 0. 98, annual decrease) and longer time since treatment (RR 0. 93; 95 % CI 0. 88 - 0. 98, annual decrease) were related to a lower occurrence of breast pain. Chemotherapy increased the occurrence of breast pain (RR 1. 72; 95 % CI 1. 19 - 2. 47). In the multivariable model only age and time since treatment were statistically significantly related to the occurrence of breast pain. We found no statistically significant relation between breast pain and the other potential risk modifiers. Conclusions: Younger women having undergone breast-conserving surgery with postoperative radiotherapy report a higher occurrence of <b>long-lasting</b> breast <b>pain</b> compared to older women.

40|$|Abstract Background Traditionally, {{studies on}} the {{etiology}} of low back pain {{have been carried out}} in adult populations. However, since low back pain often appears early in life, more research on young populations is needed. This study focuses on the importance of social background factors and previous low back pain in the development of low back pain in military recruits. Methods During a three-month period, Danish military recruits with different social backgrounds live and work under the same conditions. Thus, there is an opportunity to investigate the influence of social background on the development of low back pain, when persons are removed from their usual environment and submitted to a number of new stressors. In addition, the importance of the recruits' previous low back pain history in relation to low back pain during military service was studied. This was done by means of questionnaires to 1, 711 recruits before and after this three-month period. Results Sedentary occupation was negatively associated with <b>long-lasting</b> low back <b>pain</b> (> 30 days during the past year) at baseline with an odds ratios of 0. 55 (95 % CI: 0. 33 – 0. 90). This effect vanished during service. Having parents with higher education increased the risk of low back pain during service (OR: 1. 9; 1. 2 – 3. 0, for the highest educated group), but not of the consequences (leg pain and exemption from duty), whereas high IQ decreased the risk of these consequences (odds ratios as low as 0. 2; 0. 1 – 0. 8 for exemption from duty in the group with highest IQ). <b>Long-lasting</b> low back <b>pain</b> prior to service increased the risk of <b>long-lasting</b> low back <b>pain</b> (OR: 4. 8; 2. 1 – 10. 8), leg pain (OR: 3. 3; 1. 3 – 8. 3) and exemption from duty during service (OR: 5. 9; 2. 4 – 14. 8). Conclusion Sedentary occupation is negatively associated with low back pain at baseline. This protective effect disappears, when the person becomes physically active. For predicting trouble related to the low back during service, the duration of low back pain prior to service and IQ-level are the most important factors. </p...|$|R

Vasectomy {{reversal}} is often performed in general or neuraxial anaesthesia. Even though {{the site of}} vasectomy reversal is easily amenable to regional/local anaesthesia, spermatic cord blocks are rarely applied because of their risk of vascular damage within the spermatic cord.

50|$|Nociceptive pain is {{immediate}} pain felt as {{a result}} of injury inflicted upon tissue. Neuropathic pain, in contrast, is <b>long-lasting</b> <b>pain</b> that develops when the peripheral and the central nervous system are sensitized following injury to these systems. Neuropathic pain may be continuous pain, spontaneous, or pain caused by hypersensitivity to non-nociceptive levels of stimulus.Angiotensin II (AngII) is an octapeptide that regulates blood pressure, controls water fluid balance, and pain perception. It activates two membrane bound G protein-coupled receptors: angiotensin II type 1 receptors (ATR) and angiotensin II type 2 receptors (ATR). AgnII co-localization with substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide implies its role in nociception. ATR, the receptor mainly responsible for AngII's effect on the pain mechanisms within the nervous system, is expressed in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), as well as human trigeminal ganglia. These receptors are locally produced inside DRG neurons, implying the presence of an intrinsic angiotensinergic system. Injured nerves and painful neuromas show higher ATR expression compared to normal undamaged nerves. AngII contributes to neuropathic pain by potentiating neuronal pathways that signal pain when AngII activates ATR expressed on pain detecting neurons. AngII potentiates neuronal pathways by increasing neurite length and density in DRG neurons. AngII potentiates neuronal pathways by sensitizing nociceptors as well. Nociceptor sensitization suggests a decreased thresholds for activation of nociceptors. ATR activation increases kinase levels in DRG neurons, such as levels of PKA, PKC and MAPK, via G protein-coupled receptor-activated second messenger pathways. These phosphorylating enzymes sensitize major voltage-gated ion channels found on DRG neurons. Sensitization increases neuronal excitation following receptor channel activation. EMA401 antagonized human ATR with a Ki of 5.4 nM, IC of 39 nM and a Hill coefficient of 1.3. EMA401 alleviates pain and provides relief by blocking the AngII induced potentiation.|$|E

40|$|Experimental pain induced {{in animals}} {{has shown that}} noxious {{stimulation}} of group III and IV afferents increases the firing of muscle spindles via a reflex excitation of fusimotor (γ) motoneurones. Chronic muscle pain has been hypothesized to develop {{as a result of}} a vicious cycle involving this mechanism. In order to explore the effects of <b>long-lasting</b> muscle <b>pain</b> on the fusimotor system, single unit muscle spindle afferents were recorded from 15 subjects. Afferent activity was recorded from foot and ankle extensor muscles whilst infusing hypertonic saline into the tibialis anterior muscle of the ipsilateral leg, producing moderate-strong pain lasting for ∼ 60 min. A change in fusimotor drive was inferred by observing changes in the mean discharge rate of spontaneously active muscle spindle afferents. Homonymous and heteronymous muscles remained relaxed and showed no increase in activity, arguing against any fusimotor-driven increase in motor activity, and there was no net change in the firing of muscle spindle afferents. We conclude that long-lasting stimulation of group III and IV afferents fails to excite fusimotor neurones and increase muscle spindle discharge. Accordingly, the vicious cycle theory has no functional basis for the development of myalgia in human subjects...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{course of}} pain at a {{specific}} region such as the lower back has previously been shown {{as well as for}} generalized pain. However we have not found any report on the course of pain from various different specific regions. The aim of this investigation was to study the one-year transition of reported pain in different body locations. Methods From a general population 14555 men and women, 46 – 68 years, responded to an extensive health questionnaire including the standardized Nordic questionnaire. The population represented 27 % of the total population within the age group in Malmö, Sweden. At the one year follow-up 12607 responded to the questionnaire, yielding a response rate of 87 %. The one year prevalence of <b>long-lasting</b> <b>pain</b> and the pattern of pain reporting from different regions were studied for men and women. Results The one-year prevalence of long-lasting neck pain was 14 % (95 % CI 13 – 15) among men and 25 % (95 % CI 24 – 26) among women at baseline and 15 % (95 % CI 14 – 16) for the men and 23 % (95 % CI 22 – 24) for the women at follow-up. Of those reporting neck pain "all the time" at baseline, 48 % of the men and 54 % of the women also reported neck pain "all the time" at the one-year follow-up. At the follow-up neck pain was reported as present "often" by 43 % of the men and 47 % of the women who reported neck pain "often" at baseline. Similar transition pattern were found for neck, shoulders, elbow/wrist/hand and lower back symptoms, as well as consistent prevalence rates. Conclusion The one-year transition pattern of reported pain was similar in different body regions and among men and women. Furthermore the prevalence rates of <b>long-lasting</b> <b>pain</b> in the population were consistent at baseline and the follow-up. The findings of similar transition patterns support the interpretation of <b>long-lasting</b> <b>pain</b> as a generalized phenomenon rather than attributed to specific exposure.

40|$|Functional {{reorganization}} of the somatosensory system was widely observed in phantom limb pain patients. Whereas some studies demonstrated that the primary somatosensory cortex (S 1) of the amputated limb was engaged with the regions around it, others showed that phantom limb pain was associated with preserved structure and functional organization in the former brain region. However, {{according to the law}} of use and disuse, the sensitivity of S 1 of the amputated limb to pain-related context should be enhanced due to the adaptation to the <b>long-lasting</b> phantom limb <b>pain</b> experience. Here, we collected neurophysiological data from a patient with 21 -year phantom limb pain using electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques. EEG data showed that both laser-evoked potentials (LEPs) and tactile-evoked potentials (TEPs) were clearly presented only when radiant-heat laser pulses and electrical pulses were delivered to the shoulder of the healthy limb, but not of the amputated limb. This observation suggested the functional deficit of somatosensory pathways at the amputated side. FMRI data showed that significant larger brain activations by painful rather than non-painful stimuli in video clips were observed not only at visual-related brain areas and anterior/mid-cingulate cortex, but also at S 1 contralateral to the amputated limb. This observation suggested the increased sensitivity of S 1 of the amputated limb to the pain-related context. In addition, such increase of sensitivity was significantly larger if the context was associated with the amputated limb of the patient. In summary, our findings provided novel evidence for a possible neuroplasticity of S 1 of the amputated limb: in an amputee with <b>long-lasting</b> phantom limb <b>pain,</b> the sensitivity of S 1 to pain-related and amputated-limb-related context was greatly enhanced...|$|R

DESIGN: A prospective study. SETTING: A university hospital outpatient clinical setting. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-eight men and women with their first-ever stroke (mean age, 71 years) and affected sensory-motor function in the upper extremity at stroke onset who all reported shoulder pain in the affected side 4 months after onset of the stroke. METHODS: At 4 and 16 months after having a stroke, the participants rated their self-perceived shoulder pain (frequency and intensity). Passive range of shoulder abduction and external rotation, resistance to passive movements in the elbow, and motor function in the shoulder were assessed by a physical therapist. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: A question about pain frequency (constant, often, or occasional), the Visual Analogue Scale for Pain for self-perceived shoulder pain intensity, a goniometer for range of motion, the Modified Ashworth Scale for resistance to passive movements, and the Motor Assessment Scale for motor function. RESULTS: Of the 58 participants who had shoulder pain 4 months after having a stroke, 42 (72 %) still had pain at 16 months. The logistic regression indicated an association between shoulder pain at 16 months and left-sided hemiparesis at stroke onset (P =. 01; odds ratio [OR] 10. 47; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 92 - 57. 05), pain frequency (P =. 02; OR 6. 85; 95 % CI 1. 46 - 32. 14), decreased passive abduction at 4 months (P =. 05; OR 4. 46; 95 % CI 0. 99 - 20. 10), and age (P =. 07; OR 1. 05; 95 % CI 1. 0 - 1. 12). CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of persons with shoulder pain 4 months after having a stroke are at risk of having persistent shoulder pain 1 year later. Left-sided hemiparesis, pain reported frequently, and decreased passive shoulder range of abduction at 4 months are predictors of <b>long-lasting</b> poststroke shoulder <b>pain</b> and require increased attention in the rehabilitation setting...|$|R
40|$|We {{recently}} {{showed that}} acute muscle pain, induced by bolus intramuscular injection of hypertonic saline, causes a sustained increase in muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) and a modest increase {{in blood pressure}} and heart rate. However, {{it is not known}} whether <b>long-lasting</b> (tonic) <b>pain,</b> which more closely resembles chronic pain, causes a sustained increase in MSNA and blood pressure. We tested this hypothesis by recording MSNA in 12 healthy subjects. Tonic pain was induced for ~ 60 min by slow intramuscular infusion of hypertonic saline (7 %) into the ipsilateral tibialis anterior muscle. Pain was sustained at a tolerable level (5 / 10 to 6 / 10 on a visual analog scale). Seven subjects showed progressive increases in mean MSNA amplitude during tonic pain, increasing to 154 ± 17 % (SEM) at 45 min and remaining essentially constant {{for the duration of the}} infusion. In these subjects, blood pressure and heart rate also increased. Conversely, for the other five subjects MSNA showed a progressive decline, with a peak fall of 67 ± 11 % at 40 min; blood pressure and heart rate also fell in these subjects. We conclude that tonic muscle <b>pain</b> has <b>long-lasting</b> effects on the sympathetic control of blood pressure, causing a sustained increase in some subjects yet a sustained decrease in others. This may have implications for individual differences in the cardiovascular consequences of chronic pain...|$|R

30|$|Neurosensory {{impairment}} is {{a complex}} scenario with diverse manifestations (Pogrel, 2017; Rosen, 2014; Pogrel et al., 2011). Sometimes the clinical manifestation of the nerve injury, such as persistent and <b>long-lasting</b> <b>pain,</b> may be confused with other post-operative symptoms (Rosen, 2014; Gallas-Torreira et al., 2003; Pogrel et al., 2011; Juodzbalys et al., 2011; Polycarpou et al., 2005; Campbell et al., 1990; Cruccu et al., 2010; Fagade & Wastell, 1990; Meyer & Bagheri, 2011; Poort et al., 2009). Thus, the practitioner is required to pay his attention to this etiologic alternative, especially in cases with persistent symptoms following apparently successful endodontic treatments (Rosen, 2014; Gallas-Torreira et al., 2003; Juodzbalys et al., 2011; Polycarpou et al., 2005; Campbell et al., 1990; Cruccu et al., 2010; Fagade & Wastell, 1990; Meyer & Bagheri, 2011; Poort et al., 2009).|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose. Activities {{that require}} {{mobility}} {{of the trunk}} are often limited in patients with back problems. For this study, 5 tests (Sock Test, Pick-up Test, Roll-up Test, Fingertip-to-Floor Test, and Lift Test), all requiring sagittal-plane mobility, were performed, and the test scores were combined by the authors in a scale called the Back Performance Scale (BPS) to obtain a performance measure of mobility-related activities. Subjects. The participants were 288 patients with <b>long-lasting</b> musculoskeletal <b>pain.</b> Methods. The basis for con-structing a sum scale (BPS), discriminative ability, and responsiveness to important change of the BPS were examined in patients with back pain. Results. Bivariate correlations (rs) of scores among tests ranged from. 27 to. 50, and correlations between separate tests and the BPS ranged from. 63 to. 73. The Cronbach alpha was. 73. The BPS sum scores discriminated between patients with different return to work status and were higher for back pain than for other musculoskeletal pain. Responsiveness was high (effect size 1. 33) in patients who had changed and low (effect size 0. 31) in patients who had not changed, using return to work as an external indicator of important change. The BPS was more responsive than the separate tests. Discussion and Conclusion. The BPS appears to measure an aspect of physical perfor-mance that is of clinical importance to patients with back pain. [Stran...|$|R
40|$|Nerve injury often {{produces}} <b>long-lasting</b> spontaneous <b>pain,</b> hyperalgesia and allodynia {{that are}} refractory to treatment, being only partially relieved by clinical analgesics, and often insensitive to morphine. With {{the aim of}} assessing its therapeutic potential, we examined the effect of antisense oligonucleotide knockdown of spinal metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR 1) in neuropathic rats. We chronically infused rats intrathecally with either vehicle, or 50 [*]μg day− 1 antisense or missense oligonucleotides beginning either 3 days prior to or 5 days after nerve injury. Cold, heat and mechanical sensitivity was assessed prior to any treatment and again every few days after nerve injury. Here we show that knockdown of mGluR 1 significantly reduces cold hyperalgesia, heat hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia in the ipsilateral (injured) hindpaw of neuropathic rats. Moreover, we show that morphine analgesia is reduced in neuropathic rats, but not in sham-operated rats, and that knockdown of mGluR 1 restores the analgesic efficacy of morphine. We also show that neuropathic rats are {{more sensitive to the}} excitatory effects of intrathecally injected N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), and have elevated protein kinase C (PKC) activity in the spinal cord dorsal horn, two effects that are reversed by knockdown of mGluR 1. These results suggest that activity at mGluR 1 contributes to neuropathic pain through interactions with spinal NMDA receptors and PKC, and that knockdown of mGluR 1 may be a useful therapy for neuropathic pain in humans, both to alleviate pain directly, and as an adjunct to opioid analgesic treatment...|$|R
40|$|Male {{rates of}} suicide are {{significantly}} higher than female rates in Ireland and other Western countries, yet the process and detail of men's suicidal action is relatively unknown. This {{is partly due to}} prevailing theoretical and methodological approaches. In this area of study, macro-level, quantitative approaches predominate; and theoretical frameworks tend to adopt unitary notions of men, as well as binary, oppositional, concepts of masculinity and femininity. This inquiry, based on in-depth interviews with 52 young Irish men who made a suicide attempt, examines suicidal behaviour at the individual level. The findings demonstrate that these men experienced high levels of emotional pain but had problems identifying symptoms and disclosing distress and this, along with the coping mechanisms used, was linked to a form of masculinity prevalent in their social environment. Dominant or hegemonic masculinity norms discouraged disclosure of emotional vulnerability, and participants used alcohol and drugs to cope - which exacerbated and prolonged their distress. Over time this led to a situation where they felt their options had narrowed, and suicidal action represented a way out of their difficulties. These men experienced significant, <b>long-lasting,</b> emotional <b>pain</b> but, in the context of lives lived in environments where prevailing constructions of masculinity constrained its expression, they opted for suicide rather than disclose distress and seek help. Underpinning this study is a presumption that binary notions of male and female emotions lack substance, but that the expression of emotions is gender-specific and constrained in some social localities...|$|R
