50|$|Irwin {{continued}} to use the Super Destroyer character in the CWF {{throughout the rest of}} 1979 before debuting in Mid-South Wrestling on November 27, 1980 in a losing effort to Ted DiBiase. Irwin, as the Super Destroyer, returned to Mid-South on April 18, 1981 and won the Tag Team Championship with The Grappler after defeating Dick Murdoch and The Junkyard Dog in the finals of a tournament to claim the vacant title. However, the Destroyer and the Grappler lost the Tag Team Title days later to Murdoch and JYD on April 27. Soon after the title <b>loss,</b> Destroyer <b>rebounded</b> <b>by</b> winning the Louisiana Heavyweight Championship on May 1. He would hold the title for over two months before losing it to Bob Roop on July 22. Irwin {{continued to}} perform as the Super Destroyer upon joining the Continental Wrestling Association, and soon formed a successful tag team with the Masked Superstar.|$|R

40|$|Activation of {{peroxisome}} proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) ÃŽÂ±, ÃŽÂ´, and ÃŽÂ³ subtypes increases {{expression of}} genes involved in fatty acid transport and oxidation and alters adiposity in animal models of obesity and type- 2 diabetes. PPARpan agonists which activate all three receptor subtypes have antidiabetic activity in animal models without the weight gain associated with selective PPARÃŽÂ³ agonists. Herein we report {{the effects of}} selective PPAR agonists (GW 9578, a PPARÃŽÂ± agonist, GW 0742, a PPARÃŽÂ´ agonist, GW 7845, a PPARÃŽÂ³ agonist), combination of PPARÃŽÂ± and ÃŽÂ´ agonists, and PPARpan (PPARÃŽÂ±/ÃŽÂ³/ÃŽÂ´) activators (GW 4148 or GW 9135) on body weight (BW), body composition, food consumption, fatty acid oxidation, and serum chemistry of diet-induced obese AKR/J mice. PPARÃŽÂ± or PPARÃŽÂ´ agonist treatment induced a slight decrease in fat mass (FM) while a PPARÃŽÂ³ agonist increased BW and FM commensurate with increased food consumption. The reduction in BW and food intake after cotreatment with PPARÃŽÂ± and ÃŽÂ´ agonists appeared to be synergistic. GW 4148, a PPARpan agonist, induced a significant and sustained reduction in BW and FM similar to an efficacious dose of rimonabant, an antiobesity compound. GW 9135, a PPARpan agonist with weak activity at PPARÃŽÂ´, induced weight <b>loss</b> initially followed <b>by</b> <b>rebound</b> weight gain reaching vehicle control levels {{by the end of}} the experiment. We conclude that PPARÃŽÂ± and PPARÃŽÂ´ activations are critical to effective weight loss induction. These results suggest that the PPARpan compounds may be expected to maintain the beneficial insulin sensitization effects of a PPARÃŽÂ³ agonist while either maintaining weight or producing weight loss...|$|R

50|$|Despite the <b>loss,</b> Taylor <b>rebounded</b> <b>by</b> {{entering}} the first-ever Rey de Voladores tournament on April 22, 2007, defeating {{the likes of}} PAC, Ricochet, Retail Dragon {{en route to the}} finals of the tournament, where he defeated Lince Dorado. However, problems in the Kings of Wrestling arose as Chris Hero, the man he replaced at King of Trios, had split the Kings of Wrestling stable in two, with Hero, Sweeney, and Claudio Castagnoli comprising the Kings of Wrestling while Team F.I.S.T. (Taylor, Akuma, and Icarus) once again became a separate team. At the Aniversario! event in May, the Kings and F.I.S.T. met in a six-man tag team match, which F.I.S.T. won. Despite losing, the Kings reunited with F.I.S.T. and the Kings of Wrestling became the top stable in Chikara, later recruiting Mitch Ryder, Max Boyer and Shayne Hawke to their ranks. Using this momentum, Taylor {{went on to win the}} Young Lions Cup V, beating Cabana Man Dan, Lince Dorado, MosCOW the Communist Bovine, Player Uno, Ice Cream, Jr. and Amigo Suzuki on the first night and Arik Cannon in the semifinals on the second night, before beating longtime rival Ricochet in the finals.|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements <b>by</b> Icare <b>rebound</b> tonometer over a contact lens {{in comparison with}} Goldmann applanation tonometry (GAT). METHODS: Fifty patients using contact lens were included in this study. One of {{the eyes of the}} patients was selected randomly and their IOP were measured <b>by</b> <b>rebound</b> tonometer with and without contact lens (RTCL, RT respectively) and by GAT, as well as their central corneal thickness (CCT) by optical pachymeter. The results of both methods were compared by correlation analysis, general linear method repeated measure and Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS: Mean IOP values measured by RTCL, RT and GAT were 15. 68 ± 3. 7, 14. 50 ± 3. 4 and 14. 16 ± 2. 8 (P < 0. 001), respectively. Mean IOP by RTCL was significantly higher than the measurements implemented by RT and GAT (P < 0. 001), while {{there was no difference between}} the measurements by GAT and RT (P = 0. 629). There was a good level of positive correlation between GAT and RTCL as well as RT (r = 0. 786 P < 0. 001, r = 0. 833 P < 0. 001, respectively). We have observed that CCT increase did not show any correlation with the differences of the measurements between RTCL and RT (P = 0. 329), RTCL and GAT (P = 0. 07) as well as RT and GAT (P = 0. 189) in linear regression model. CONCLUSION: The average of the measurements over contact lens <b>by</b> <b>rebound</b> tonometer was found to be higher than what was measured by GAT. Although this difference is statistically significant, it may be clinically negligible in the normal population...|$|R
