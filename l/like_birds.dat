The faint {{outline of}} the Tsarist-Soviet imperium still glimmers in the collective steam off bowls of beetroot and cabbage in meat stock, and the soft sound of dollops of sour cream slipping into soup, from the Black Sea to the Sea of Japan and, in emigration, from Brooklyn to Berlin.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all mammals are {{endothermic}} ("warm-blooded"). Most mammals {{also have}} hair {{to help keep}} them warm. <b>Like</b> <b>birds,</b> mammals can forage or hunt in weather and climates too cold for ectothermic ("cold-blooded") reptiles and insects. Endothermy requires plenty of food energy, so mammals eat more food per unit of body weight than most reptiles. Small insectivorous mammals eat prodigious amounts for their size. A rare exception, the naked mole-rat produces little metabolic heat, so it is considered an operational poikilotherm. Birds are also endothermic, so endothermy {{is not unique to}} mammals.|$|E
5|$|Vision is an {{important}} sensory system for most species of fish. Fish eyes {{are similar to those}} of terrestrial vertebrates <b>like</b> <b>birds</b> and mammals, but have a more spherical lens. Their retinas generally have both rods and cones (for scotopic and photopic vision), and most species have colour vision. Some fish can see ultraviolet and some can see polarized light. Amongst jawless fish, the lamprey has well-developed eyes, while the hagfish has only primitive eyespots. Fish vision shows adaptation to their visual environment, for example deep sea fishes have eyes suited to the dark environment.|$|E

5|$|Crocodilians were {{traditionally}} {{thought to}} breathe like mammals, with airflow {{moving in and}} out tidally, but studies published in 2010 and 2013 conclude that crocodilians breathe more <b>like</b> <b>birds,</b> with airflow moving in a unidirectional loop within the lungs. When a crocodilian inhales, air flows through the trachea and into two primary bronchi, or airways, which branch off into narrower secondary passageways. The air continues to move through these, then into even narrower tertiary airways, and then into other secondary airways which were bypassed the first time. The air then flows back into the primary airways and is exhaled back out. These aerodynamic valves within the bronchial tree have been hypothesised to explain how crocodilians can have unidirectional airflow without the aid of avian-like air sacs.|$|E
5|$|In 2016 it was {{proposed}} that large theropods like Tyrannosaurus had teeth covered in lips like modern day lizards, {{rather than having}} bare teeth like crocodiles. This {{was based on the}} presence of enamel, which according to this theory, may have to remain hydrated, an issue not faced by aquatic species like crocodilians or toothless species <b>like</b> <b>birds,</b> which have lipless mouths and toothless beaks. Based on comparisons of bone texture of Daspletosaurus with crocodilians, a 2017 theory suggests that Tyrannosaurus and other tyrannosaurids may not have had lips at all and instead had large, flat scales that left no room for lips. The skull of Daspletosaurus also suggests that tyrannosaurids including Tyrannosaurus had integumentary sensory organs similar to crocodilians likely used in touch, temperature readings, prey detection and precise control of jaw movements.|$|E
5|$|The crocodilian {{has perhaps}} the most complex {{vertebrate}} circulatory system. It has a four-chambered heart and two ventricles, an unusual trait among extant reptiles, and both a left and right aorta which are connected by a hole called the Foramen of Panizza. <b>Like</b> <b>birds</b> and mammals, crocodilians have heart valves that direct blood flow in a single direction through the heart chambers. They also have unique cog-teeth-like valves that, when interlocked, direct blood to the left aorta {{and away from the}} lungs, and then back around the body. This system may allow the animals to remain submerged for a longer period, but this explanation has been questioned. Other possible reasons for the peculiar circulatory system include assistance with thermoregulatory needs, prevention of pulmonary oedema, or faster recovery from metabolic acidosis. Retaining carbon dioxide within the body permits an increase in the rate of gastric acid secretion and thus the efficiency of digestion, and other gastrointestinal organs such as the pancreas, spleen, small intestine, and liver also function more efficiently.|$|E

5|$|The patagium is {{the wing}} membrane. The patagium is {{stretched}} between {{the arm and}} hand bones, down the lateral {{side of the body}} and down to the hind limbs. This skin membrane consists of connective tissue, elastic fibers, nerves, muscles, and blood vessels. The muscles keep the membrane taut during flight. The skin on the body of the bat, which has one layer of epidermis and dermis, as well as the presence of hair follicles, sweat glands and a fatty subcutaneous layer, {{is very different from the}} skin of the wing membrane. The patagium is an extremely thin double layer of epidermis; these layers are separated by a connective tissue center, rich with collagen and elastic fibers. The membrane has no hair follicles or sweat glands, except between the fingers. Unlike birds whose stiff wings deliver bending and torsional stress to the shoulders, bats have a flexible wing membrane which can only resist tension. To achieve flight, a bat exerts force inwards at the points where the membrane meets the skeleton, so that an opposing force balances it on the wing edges perpendicular to the wing surface. However, this adaptation does not permit bats to reduce their wingspan as birds do, which means they cannot travel over long distances <b>like</b> <b>birds</b> can.|$|E

25|$|The {{presence}} of two shelled eggs within the birth canal shows that oviraptorosaurs were intermediate between the reproductive biology of crocodilians and modern birds.

25|$|Primarily herbivorous, Ricord's iguanas are {{presented}} with a special problem for osmoregulation: plant matter contains more potassium and as it has less nutritional content per gram, more must be eaten to meet the lizard's metabolic needs. As Ricord's iguanas are not capable of creating liquid urine more concentrated than their bodily fluids, <b>like</b> <b>birds</b> they excrete nitrogenous wastes as urate salts through a salt gland. As a result, Ricord's iguanas have developed this lateral nasal gland to supplement renal salt secretion by expelling excess potassium and sodium chloride.|$|E
25|$|Rinehart (2009) {{assessed}} the ontogenic growth of this genus using data {{gathered from the}} length of its upper leg bone (femur) and concluded that Coelophysis juveniles grew rapidly <b>like</b> <b>birds</b> (and not slowly like reptiles), especially {{during the first year}} of life. Coelophysis likely reached sexual maturity between the second and third year of life and reached its full size, just above 10 feet in length, by its eighth year. This study identified four distinct growth stages: 1-year, 2-year, 4-year, and 7+ year. It was also thought, that as soon as they were hatched, they would have to fend for themselves.|$|E
25|$|Alligators, much <b>like</b> <b>birds,</b> {{have been}} shown to exhibit {{unidirectional}} movement of air through their lungs. Most other amniotes are believed to exhibit bidirectional, or tidal breathing. For a tidal breathing animal, such as a mammal, air flows {{into and out of the}} lungs through branching bronchi which terminate in small dead-end chambers called alveoli. As the alveoli represent dead-ends to flow, the inspired air must move back out the same way it came in. In contrast, air in alligator lungs makes a circuit, moving in only one direction through the parabronchi. The air first enters the outer branch, moves through the parabronchi, and exits the lung through the inner branch. Oxygen exchange takes place in extensive vasculature around the parabronchi.|$|E

25|$|Dale Russell {{described}} the new {{genus and species}} Daspletosaurus torosus. He classified it in the family Tyrannosauridae rather than the historical home of tyrannosaurs, the Deinodontidae, setting a trend among paleontologists that would see the latter familial name fall into disuse {{in favor of the}} former. He observed that Daspletosaurus and Gorgosaurus lived {{at the same time and}} place, while Daspletosaurus was less common. He also noticed that hadrosaurs and ceratopsians were both present in the same deposits, with ceratopsians being less common. He speculated that this parallel may have been due to niche partitioning between the tyrannosaurs as each specialized in prey, with the lighter built and more common Gorgosaurus feeding on hadrosaurs and the more rugged and less common Daspletosaurus specializing in the rarer and more dangerous ceratopsians. He noted that while adult tyrannosaurs may have fed on such large prey, very young individuals would be limited to quarry <b>like</b> <b>birds,</b> frogs, mammals, and small reptiles.|$|E
25|$|In the inscription, the runes aukrimulfʀ {{are to be}} read as auk krimulfʀ and the k rune, , thus {{represents}} {{two letters}} at the same time. The runes represent the common Norse name Grímulfr, which was in use all over Scandinavia. It is of note that the name appears in such an old runestone as the other runic attestations of the name are considerably younger, and the name was common in medieval Norway. The name of the deceased, Eyvindr, is a common name in Swedish runic inscriptions, but not Eivísl, {{the name of the}} chieftain of the expedition. The only other secure attestation appears on the contemporary Sparlösa Runestone in Västergötland. Since the name appears on two runestones from roughly the same time and in two districts that were culturally closely connected, the name may refer to the same person on the two runestones. Unfortunately, the Sparlösa Runestone is damaged in several places and although it mentions a battle and although there are images <b>like</b> <b>birds</b> hovering above the rigging of a ship, scholars cannot be certain that it refers to a chieftain who had fallen in battle. The idenfication between the name Eivísl on the two runestones will remain a hypothesis.|$|E
