5|$|A $2.5 {{million bond}} issue passed in 1922 for a stadium {{conceived}} by Burnham. Designed by architects Holabird & Roche and named Soldier Field for {{the veterans of}} World War I, cost overruns required another bond issue in 1926. By 1924, the breakwater wall stretched from 14th to 55th Streets. In 1926, Soldier Field and a portion of Lake Shore Drive were opened. <b>Landfilling</b> extended from 23rd Street to 56th Street; however, Promontory Point was not complete, prompting complaints regarding garbage, blowing sand and odors. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, landfill efforts continued to fill in Burnham Park and the adjacent Northerly Island. The South Development was named for Daniel Burnham on January 14, 1927, and support increased for a world's fair in the park. Construction was completed on Lake Shore Drive, with northbound lanes named for Leif Erikson, and southbound lanes for Christopher Columbus. In 1929, construction of the park at Promontory Point began. The Great Depression delayed work and prevented construction of nearshore islands. Burnham Park was chosen for {{the site of the}} Century of Progress world's fair and a yacht basin was built south of 51st Street.|$|E
25|$|Since it {{is often}} not recycled, the mercury-laden {{activated}} carbon presents a disposal dilemma. If the activated carbon contains less than 260 ppm mercury, United States federal regulations {{allow it to be}} stabilized (for example, trapped in concrete) for <b>landfilling.</b> However, waste containing greater than 260 ppm is considered to be in the high-mercury subcategory and is banned from <b>landfilling</b> (Land-Ban Rule). This material is now accumulating in warehouses and in deep abandoned mines at an estimated rate of 1000 tons per year.|$|E
25|$|If {{materials}} are incinerated during the disposal process, the energy released during burning can be harnessed {{and used for}} electricity production. This provides a low-impact energy source, especially when compared with coal and natural gas While incineration produces more greenhouse gas emissions than <b>landfilling,</b> the waste plants are well-fitted with filters to minimize this negative impact. A recent study comparing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from <b>landfilling</b> (without energy recovery) against incineration (with energy recovery) found incineration to be superior in all cases except for when landfill gas is recovered for electricity production.|$|E
50|$|Waste {{diversion}} or <b>landfill</b> diversion is {{the process}} of diverting waste from <b>landfills.</b> The success of <b>landfill</b> diversion can be measured by comparison {{of the size of the}} <b>landfill</b> from one year to the next. If the <b>landfill</b> grows minimally or remains the same, then policies covering <b>landfill</b> diversion are successful. For example, currently in the United States there are 3000 <b>landfills.</b> A measure of the success of <b>landfill</b> diversion would be if that number remains the same or is reduced. In 2009, it was recorded that the national average of <b>landfill</b> diversion in the United States was 33.8%, while San Francisco had implemented the most effective policies and had recorded a <b>landfill</b> diversion rate of 77%. By diverting <b>landfills</b> we can preserve our natural resources.|$|R

50|$|<b>Landfill</b> {{mining and}} {{reclamation}} (LFMR) {{is a process}} whereby solid wastes which have previously been <b>landfilled</b> are excavated and processed. The function of <b>landfill</b> mining {{is to reduce the}} amount of <b>landfill</b> mass encapsulated within the closed <b>landfill</b> and/or temporarily remove hazardous material to allow protective measures to be taken before the <b>landfill</b> mass is replaced. In the process, mining recovers valuable recyclable materials, a combustible fraction, soil, and <b>landfill</b> space. The aeration of the <b>landfill</b> soil is a secondary benefit regarding the <b>landfill's</b> future use. The combustible fraction is useful for the generation of power. The overall appearance of the <b>landfill</b> mining procedure is a sequence of processing machines laid out in a functional conveyor system.

50|$|Bioreactor <b>landfills</b> {{accelerate}} {{the process of}} decomposition. As decomposition progresses, the mass of biodegradable components in the <b>landfill</b> declines, creating more space for dumping garbage. Bioreactor <b>landfills</b> are expected to increase this rate of decomposition and save up to 30% of space needed for <b>landfills.</b> With increasing amounts of solid waste produced every year and scarcity of <b>landfill</b> spaces, bioreactor <b>landfill</b> can thus provide a significant way of maximising <b>landfill</b> space. This is not just cost effective, but since less land is needed for the <b>landfills,</b> this is also better for the environment.|$|R
25|$|Channelization and <b>landfilling</b> {{began in}} the colonial era and {{continued}} well into the 20th century. Early materials were shellfish and other refuse, and later construction debris from projects such as the New York City Subway and Pennsylvania Station. Rubble from the bombing of London was transported for ballast during World War II. New land has been created throughout the port, including large swaths that are now Battery Park City, Ellis Island, Liberty State Park, Flushing Meadows–Corona Park, and the Meadowlands Sports Complex.|$|E

Prior to this point, disposable diapers were not popular, although Johnson & Johnson had developed a product called Chux. Babies always wore cloth diapers, which were leaky and labor-intensive to wash. Pampers provided a convenient alternative, albeit at the environmental cost of more waste requiring <b>landfilling.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Landfilling</b> {{practices}} in the UK have had to change {{in recent years to}} meet the challenges of the European Landfill Directive. The UK now imposes landfill tax upon biodegradable waste which is put into landfills. In addition to this the Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme has been established for local authorities to trade landfill quotas in England. A different system operates in Wales where authorities are not able to 'trade' between themselves, but have allowances known as the Landfill Allowance Scheme.|$|E

25|$|Gases are {{produced}} in <b>landfills</b> {{due to the}} anaerobic digestion by microbes. In a properly managed <b>landfill</b> this gas is collected and used. Its uses range from simple flaring to the <b>landfill</b> gas utilization and generation of electricity. <b>Landfill</b> gas monitoring alerts workers {{to the presence of}} a build-up of gases to a harmful level. In some countries, <b>landfill</b> gas recovery is extensive; in the United States, for example, more than 850 <b>landfills</b> have active <b>landfill</b> gas recovery systems.|$|R
40|$|The {{main problem}} of <b>landfill</b> {{management}} in Indonesia is {{the difficulty in}} getting a location for Final Processing Sites (FPS) due to limited land and high land prices. Besides, about 95 % of existing <b>landfills</b> are uncontrolled dumping sites, which could potentially lead to water, soil and air pollution. Based on data from the Ministry of Environment (2010), The Act of the Republic of Indonesia Number 18 Year 2008 Concerning Solid Waste Management, prohibits open dumping at final processing sites and in ratification, the Local Governments have to convert the open dump sites into controlled or sanitary <b>landfill.</b> The Research Institute for Human Settlements has been conducting multi-year researches related to the rehabilitation of dumpsites toward sustainable <b>landfill.</b> The research methods are literature reviews, experiments, laboratory analysis and field observations. A pilot model of dumpsite rehabilitation {{was carried out in}} 2010 at the Final Processing Site at Cikundul in Sukabumi City, consisting of (1) mining <b>landfill</b> (2) construction of <b>landfill</b> cells in a former mining area with a semi aerobic <b>landfill</b> and an anaerobic <b>landfill</b> and (3) <b>landfill</b> operations using decomposed material from <b>landfill</b> mining as a soil cover. The purpose of the study is to develop a sustainable approach for <b>landfill</b> management and rehabilitation through <b>landfill</b> mining and implementation of semi aerobic <b>landfill.</b> Findings in the construction of <b>landfill</b> mining indicate that (1) the construction of <b>landfill</b> mining is constrained by leachate that is trapped in a pile of waste, therefore, the leachate needs to be pumped to leachate treatment installations, (2) the volume of waste excavation is expanding due to the high plastic content of about 26 % in <b>landfills</b> (3) the potency of decomposed materials from <b>landfill</b> mining is 40 – 83 % for <b>landfill</b> operations or greening [...] The performance of <b>landfill</b> systems shows that leachate quality of semi aerobic <b>landfill</b> tends to be lower than that of anaerobic <b>landfill.</b> Gas composition at semi aerobic <b>landfill</b> in FPS Sukabumi shows about 6 – 10 % CH 4 and about 15 – 16 % O 2; for an aerobic <b>landfill,</b> the gas composition is about 47 – 57 % CH 4 and about 2 – 3 % O 2. In conclusion the concept mining <b>landfill</b> could be developed especially for big cities where it is difficult to find a new site for <b>landfill</b> or to get soil cover for <b>landfill</b> operation. In a sustainable approach, the excavated area can be turned into a new area for <b>landfill</b> cell so that the capacity of existing Final Processing Site can be expanded using the block <b>landfill</b> concept. The <b>landfill</b> should be divided into three blocks: compost block, composting block and active block. Usage of the three blocks are rotated with the intention of using solid waste on the compost block as soil material for the active block through <b>landfill</b> mining...|$|R
25|$|The {{success of}} the Flushing Meadows site as a garbage dump-turned-park led Moses and the city to develop other {{wetlands}} in the city into parks via short-term refuse <b>landfilling.</b> This process was used to create Marine Park and Spring Creek Park in Brooklyn, and Ferry Point Park in the Bronx. This was also the original plan for the Fresh Kills and Edgemere landfills, which remained open past their expected tenure and became large and long-term municipal waste sites. The Fresh Kills site is currently being developed into Freshkills Park.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} renewed {{interest}} in incineration and other waste-to-energy technologies in the U.S. and Canada. In the U.S., incineration was granted qualification for renewable energy production tax credits in 2004. Projects to add capacity to existing plants are underway, and municipalities are once again evaluating the option of building incineration plants rather than continue <b>landfilling</b> municipal wastes. However, many of these projects have faced continued political opposition in spite of renewed arguments for the greenhouse gas benefits of incineration and improved air pollution control and ash recycling.|$|E

50|$|A <b>landfill</b> {{compaction}} vehicle has {{two main}} functions: {{to spread the}} waste evenly in layers over the <b>landfill,</b> and to compact waste to reduce its volume and help stabilize the <b>landfill.</b> Proper waste compacting includes the process of using a steel wheeled/drum <b>landfill</b> compactor to shred, tear and press together various items in the waste stream so they consume a minimal volume of <b>landfill</b> airspace. The higher the compaction rate, the more trash the <b>landfill</b> can receive and store. This will also reduce landslides, cave-ins and {{minimize the risk of}} explosions of <b>landfill</b> gas (see <b>landfill</b> gas migration).|$|R
40|$|The {{economic}} advantage of constructing and operating large-scale <b>landfills</b> over small-scale <b>landfills</b> {{has been used}} to justify regional <b>landfills</b> as a solution to the municipal waste disposal problem. In addition to the dampening effects on social efforts to divert waste away from <b>landfills,</b> higher external costs of larger <b>landfills</b> may in fact offset the private cost advantages. In this study, the negative effects of a <b>landfill</b> that are capitalized in property values of houses located in the proximity of two <b>landfill</b> sites of significantly different sizes in Toronto, Canada, are examined. The results suggest that larger <b>landfills</b> have greater adverse impacts on property values than smaller <b>landfills,</b> implying consumers perceive (and markets reflect) differences in external costs. ...|$|R
25|$|Environmental {{concerns}} over external costs exist as well. In the United States, dental amalgam {{is the largest}} source of mercury received by sewage treatment plants. The mercury contaminates the treatment plant sludge, which is typically disposed of by land application, <b>landfilling</b> or incineration. Several states, including New Jersey, New York, and Michigan, have required the installation of dental amalgam separators prior to 2017. EPA promulgated an effluent guidelines regulation in 2017 which prohibits most dental practices from disposing amalgam waste down the drain. Most dental offices nationwide are now required to use amalgam separators.|$|E
25|$|In Europe, {{with the}} ban on <b>landfilling</b> {{untreated}} waste, scores of incinerators have {{been built in the}} last decade, with more under construction. Recently, a number of municipal governments have begun the process of contracting for the construction and operation of incinerators. In Europe, some of the electricity generated from waste is deemed to be from a 'Renewable Energy Source (RES) and is thus eligible for tax credits if privately operated. Also, some incinerators in Europe are equipped with waste recovery, allowing the reuse of ferrous and non-ferrous materials found in landfills. A prominent example is the AEB Waste Fired Power Plant.|$|E

25|$|Several methods {{exist to}} improve the {{efficiency}} of fossil fuel power plants. A frequently used and cost-efficient method is to convert a plant to run on a different fuel. This includes conversions of coal power plants to biomass or waste and conversions of natural gas power plants to biogas. Conversions of coal powered power plants to waste-fired power plants have an extra benefit in that they can reduce <b>landfilling.</b> In addition, waste-fired power plants can be equipped with material recovery, which is also beneficial to the environment.

25|$|Incinerators {{reduce the}} solid {{mass of the}} {{original}} waste by 80–85% and the volume (already compressed somewhat in garbage trucks) by 95–96%, depending on composition and degree of recovery of materials such as metals from the ash for recycling. This means that while incineration does not completely replace <b>landfilling,</b> it significantly reduces the necessary volume for disposal. Garbage trucks often reduce the volume of waste in a built-in compressor before delivery to the incinerator. Alternatively, at landfills, {{the volume of the}} uncompressed garbage can be reduced by approximately 70% by using a stationary steel compressor, albeit with a significant energy cost. In many countries, simpler waste compaction is a common practice for compaction at landfills.|$|E
