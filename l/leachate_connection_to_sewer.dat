50|$|Water {{pollution}} typically occurs due to {{the discharge}} of effluent into water systems, improper landfill techniques, flooding of urban areas resulting in pollution from urban run-off, and agricultural practices. For example, the cities La Rioja and Catamarca have constraints on expansion of freshwater supplies forcing the residents to use only water they have available {{even if it is}} contaminated. The lack of piped water and sewage can exacerbate the water pollution problem through excessive contamination from excrements. For example, communities having 5,000-10,000 residents and urban centers with 200,000-500,000 residents have 90% and 60% of those respective residents that lack <b>connection</b> <b>to</b> <b>sewers.</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{developing}} countries, <b>connection</b> <b>to</b> <b>sewer</b> {{systems is}} often costly for poor households, despite typically low monthly sewer tariffs. This apparent paradox {{is explained by}} {{the high costs of}} in-plot and in-house sanitary installations that have to be paid entirely by the user, by sometimes high sewer connection fees levied by utilities, and by a lack of community consultation. As a result, in many cities in developing countries conventional sewers are laid at high costs under a street, while many users on that street do not connect to them. In Brazil, in some cities connection rates in the early 1990s were less than 40% of the intended beneficiary population.|$|R

40|$|Nutrient {{emissions}} in human waste and wastewater effluent fluxes from domestic sources are quantified for the UK {{over the period}} 1800 - 2010 based on population data from UK Census returns. The most important drivers of change have been {{the introduction of the}} water closet (flush toilet) along with population growth, urbanisation, <b>connection</b> <b>to</b> <b>sewer,</b> improvements in wastewater treatment and use of phosphorus in detergents. In 1800, the population of the UK was about 12 million and estimated {{emissions in}} human waste were 37 kt N, 6. 2 kt P and 205 kt organic C per year. This would have been recycled to land with little or no sewage going directly to rivers or coastal waters. By 1900, population had increased to 35. 6 million and some 145 kt N were emitted in human waste but, with only the major urban areas connected <b>to</b> <b>sewers,</b> only about 19 kt N were discharged in sewage effluent. With the use of phosphorus in detergents, estimated phosphorus emissions peaked at around 63. 5 kt P/year in the 1980 s, with about 28 kt P/year being discharged in sewage effluent. By 2010, population had increased to 63 million with estimated emissions of 263 kt N, 43. 6 kt P and 1460 kt organic C per year, and an estimated effluent flux of 104 kt N, 14. 8 kt P and 63 kt organic C.

40|$|In urban cities, the {{environmental}} services are {{the responsibility of}} the public sector, where piped water supply is the norm for urban household. Likewise, in Beirut City (capital of Lebanon) official water authorities are the main supplier of domestic water through a network of piping system that leaks in many areas. Beirut City and its suburbs are overpopulated since it is the residence of 1 / 3 of the Lebanese citizens. Thus, Beirut suffers deficiency in meeting its water demand. Water rationing, as a remedial action, is firmly established since four decades by the Lebanese Water Authorities. Consumers resorted then to private wells to supplement their domestic water needs. Consequently, household water quality is influenced by external factors relating to well water characteristics and internal factors depending on the types of the pipes of the distribution network and cross <b>connections</b> <b>to</b> <b>sewer</b> pipes. These factors could result in chemical and microbial contamination of drinking water. The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate domestic water quality variation in Beirut City emerging form the aforementioned factors. The presented work encircles a typical case study of Beirut City (Ras Beirut). Results showed deterioration pattern in domestic water quality.

30|$|Using {{faecal matter}} as {{feedstock}} {{was a deliberate}} decision given the increasing competition for crop residues (mulching, livestock fodder, biogas, and composting), {{as well as their}} only seasonal availability. Using animal manure for biochar production as presented e.g. by Uzoma et al. (2011) and Hass et al. (2012) was not considered beneficial in Ethiopian context as animal manure is too valuable for this transformation. The use of animal as well as human manure has a long tradition in agriculture system, partly in raw form, partly after composting to minimize microbial risks (Powell et al. 1999; Guzha et al. 2005). The situation changed with increasing health regulations and household <b>connections</b> <b>to</b> <b>sewer</b> systems which increased the likelihood of chemical contamination where also industrial effluent feeds into the same sewage. However, rural and peri-urban households not connected <b>to</b> <b>sewers</b> but local septic tanks offer a significantly safer product (septage) for reuse than sewage sludge (Muchuweti et al. 2006; Singh and Agrawal 2007; Jamali et al. 2009). To address the possible stigma of fertilizer derived from human excreta, biochar offers an interesting value proposition where the pyrolysis process guaranties a 100 % pathogen elimination, as well as significant reduction in transport and storage weight and volume (Tagoe et al. 2008). Moreover, compared with the long treatment process of composting the pyrolysis technology requires only few hours (Fytili and Zabaniotou 2008). On the other hand, the pyrolysis leads to significant losses of nitrogen (Calderón et al. 2006; Gaskin et al. 2008). Therefore, we were interested to study the co-application of faecal matter biochar and N fertilizer on the growth, yield and nutrient status of a popular cash crop, lettuce, used in urban farming across sub-Saharan Africa.|$|R
