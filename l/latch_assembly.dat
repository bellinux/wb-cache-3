5000|$|Two {{holes are}} bored, {{perpendicular}} to one another, {{into the door}}. The [...] "face bore" [...] is the larger hole which is bored into the door face and a smaller [...] "edge bore" [...] hole is bored into the door edge. The edge may require additional preparation to receive the <b>latch</b> <b>assembly,</b> typically by routing or chiseling a shallow mortise. Some commercially-sold doors may come prepared to receive one or more bored cylindrical locks, such as entry doors, which typically require both a door knob and dead bolt.|$|E
50|$|On {{passenger}} cars, a hood may be {{held down}} by a concealed latch. It is designed to protect a car from thefts, damage and sudden hood opening on the road. The hood release system is common on the most of vehicles and usually consists of interior hood latch handle, hood release cable and hood <b>latch</b> <b>assembly.</b> The hood latch handle is usually located below the steering wheel, beside the driver's seat or set into the door frame. When a driver pulls a hood latch handle the hood panel pops up and allows access to the engine compartment. On race cars or cars with aftermarket hoods (that do not use the factory latch system) the hood may be held down by hood pins. A hood may sometimes contain a hood ornament, hood scoop, power bulge, and/or wiper jets. Hoods are typically made out of steel, but aluminum is rapidly gaining popularity with auto companies. Aftermarket manufacturers may construct hoods out of fiberglass, carbon fiber, or dry carbon.|$|E

40|$|A payload {{retention}} device for grappling and retaining a payload in docked {{position on a}} supporting structure in the cargo bay of a space vehicle is presented. The device comprises a two-fault tolerant electromagnetic grappling system comprising electromagnets for attracting and grappling a grapple strike plate affixed to the payload when in proximity thereto and an electromechanical <b>latching</b> <b>assembly</b> comprising a pair of independent latching subassemblies. Each subassembly comprises a set of latching pawls which are driven into latching and unlatching positions relative to a grappled payload {{by a pair of}} gearmotors, each equipped with a ratchet clutch drive mechanism which is two-fault tolerant with respect to latching such that only one gearmotor of the four needs to be operational to effect a latch of the payload but is single fault tolerant with respect to release of a latched payload. Sensors are included for automatically sensing the magnetic grappling of a payload and for automatically de-energizing the gearmotors of the latching subassemblies when a latch condition is achieved...|$|R
40|$|The {{finite element}} method {{has been used to}} {{investigate}} the stress field in mechanical suspension systems. The critical seismic loads are depended on three-dimensional dynamic response of vacuum vessels and interactions of the equipment supporting structures to the vacuum vessels and supporting system. In this study of the optics assembly equipment (15 to 27 Hz), it was shown that the pressure vessel systems which supports the optics assembly systems (6. 5 to 13 Hz) have significant influence in the seismic response of the rotary <b>latch</b> <b>assembly.</b> A potentially critical failure location is identified. An axisymmetrical elastic analysis predicts stress at the inner radius of the lower housing can be reduced by 60 % with simple design modification. Use of three-dimensional dynamic model and static model to evaluate the combined complex stress permits prediction of the rotary <b>latch</b> <b>assembly</b> operating life and seismic safety...|$|E

40|$|A column {{longeron}} <b>latch</b> <b>assembly</b> {{provides the}} securing {{mechanism for the}} deployable, telescoping column of a hoop/column antenna. The column is an open lattice structure with three longerons disposed 120 deg apart as the principle load bearing member. The column is deployed {{from a pair of}} eleven nested bays disposed on opposite sides of a center section under the influence of a motor-cable-pulley system. The longeron latch is a four bar linkage mechanism using the over-center principle for automatically locking the longeron sections into position during deployment. The latch is unlocked when the antenna is to be restowed. A spring pack disposed in the end of each longeron serves to absorb stress forces on the deployed column through the cam head piston and abutting latch from an adjacent longeron...|$|E
40|$|A {{vertical}} dropped-weight {{impact test}} machine has a dropped-weight barrel vertically supported on {{upper and lower}} support brackets. The dropped-weight barrel is chambered to receive a dropped-weight <b>assembly</b> having a <b>latch</b> pin at its upper end, a damping unit in the middle, and a tup at its lower end. The tup is adapted for gathering data during impact testing. The latch pin releasably engages a <b>latch</b> pin coupling <b>assembly.</b> The <b>latch</b> pin coupling <b>assembly</b> {{is attached to a}} winch via a halyard for raising and lowering the dropped-weight assembly. The lower end of the dropped-weight barrel is provided with a bounce-back arresting mechanism which is activated by the descending passage of the dropped-weight assembly. After striking the specimen, the dropped-weight assembly rebounds vertically and is caught by the bounce-back arresting mechanism. The damping unit of the dropped-weight assembly serves to dissipate energy from the rebounding dropped-weight assembly and prevents the dropped-weight assembly from rebounding from the self-arresting mechanism...|$|R

40|$|According to specifications, {{lifetime}} of a linear stepping electromagnetic drive in WWER- 1000 nuclear reactors {{is limited by}} the pre-assigned lifetimes of the drive components such as electromagnets, a <b>latch</b> <b>assembly,</b> drive rack, and control rod position sensor. The {{lifetime of}} the drive components is from 7 to 20 years. On the basis of diagnostics of these components under real conditions, actual lifetimes of the components at nuclear power plant (NPP) were forecasted. It is shown that in order to extend the lifetime of the drive components up to the reactor lifetime (60 years), it is necessary to replace the sensor of the DPL-type by the new one (of the DPL-KV type) and to decrease the electromagnet temperature. The Measuring and Diagnostic System with the DPL-KV sensor enables diagnosing the sensor, electronic processing unit and drive. Economic effect due to the cumulative technical decisions is estimated to be 7 mln. euro per NPP unit...|$|E
40|$|The Dexterous End Effector Flight Experiment is {{a flight}} {{demonstration}} of newly developed equipment and methods which make for more dexterous manipulation of robotic arms. The following concepts {{are to be}} demonstrated: The Force Torque Sensor is a six axis load cell located {{at the end of}} the RMS which displays load data to the operator on the orbiter CCTV monitor. TRAC is a target system which provides six axis positional information to the operator. It has the characteristic of having high sensitivity to attitude misalignment while being flat. AUTO-TRAC is a variation of TRAC in which a computer analyzes a target, displays translational and attitude misalignment information, and provides cues to the operator for corrective inputs. The Magnetic End Effector is a fault tolerant end effector which grapples payloads using magnetic attraction. The Carrier <b>Latch</b> <b>Assembly</b> is a fault tolerant payload carrier, which uses mechanical latches and/or magnetic attraction to hold small payloads during launch/landing and to release payloads as desired.

40|$|The project {{elaborated}} {{in frame}} of engineering studies branch Manufacturing Technology (N 2307 - 00) is submitting design of technology {{production of the}} latch claw. The latch claw is a component of a car side-door <b>latch</b> <b>assembly</b> {{and can be used}} for different car models. The part is made of sheetmetal 4 mm thick. The material for the part is 15 CrMo 5, alloy steel for case-hardening purposes. Pursuant of the literary pursuit was designed several options of the part manufacture. With regard to required dimensional accuracy, cut-edge quality and expected production run (800 000 pcs. per year) was proposed manufacturing the part by fineblanking technology. Fineblanking is a cost-effective manufacturing method for accurate sheetmetal parts. For manufacturing parts was chosen Feintool hydraulic fineblanking press HFA 3200 plus with total force 3200 kN. The press is coupled to a coil reel a strip straighter. Both units of Feintool feeding line FBA 8 / 300 are very compact, reducing space requirement. For the fineblanking tool design is used a moving-punch system because these tool systems are compact and economical to make and use. The tool make use of standardized cast iron fineblanking die set made by Fibro company. At the conclusion was compared the cost-effectiveness between two production methods – fineblanking with that of laser beam cutting...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A very fast, low-cost, and {{reliable}} method to assemble micro structures suitable for MOEMS (micro-opto-electro-mechanical systems) applications is {{reported in this}} paper. In general, due to the minute scale of MEMS devices, inertia force is often neglected when dealing with MEMS components. However, we have demonstrated that inertia force can be significant even if the mass of micro structure is < 1 µg (a 250 µmx 100 µm mass with 3. 5 µm thick polysilicon and 0. 5 µm thick Au layers). At this scale, we have shown that, mass inertia force can overcome some surface forces and thus be used for non-contact self-assembly of MEMS structures. Centrifugal force was applied to MUMPs (Multi-User-MEMS-Processes) chips by attaching the chips to a rotating disc. The micro hinged structures on the chips were shown to self-assemble by rotating themselves 90 o out of substrate plane in most cases, and automatically lock themselves to designed <b>latches.</b> The <b>assembly</b> process is also applicable to complex dynamic micro mirror structures. Our experimental setup and systematic approach to acquire force data during the centrifugal assembly process is described in this paper. Index Terms—micro assembly, batch assembly, automated micro assembly, centrifugal assembly. ...|$|R
40|$|Copyright © 2003 SAE International Computational {{modeling}} {{continues to}} play an increasingly {{significant role in the}} design of more effective vehicle crash safety systems. Models configured with sophisticated computer analyses permit researchers to perform extensive “what-if? ” exploratory studies {{at a fraction of the}} cost and time that would be required by physical testing alone. Presently, our research team is developing a modeling and analysis capability that will provide child restraint system (CRS) engineers, designers, and analysts a validation tool that will supplement conventional engineering results attained from sled testing, which is often timely and costly. Supplementing these physical tests and digital modeling capabilities is the newly developed NYSCEDII CRS Visualization Module (NCVM), which allows a user to immersively visualize the MADYMO-calculated automotive crash simulation imagery. Depicted are the motion of, and interactions between, the CRS shell, human “dummy”, harness and <b>latch</b> belt <b>assemblies,</b> and applicable vehicle cabin-interior surfaces and structure; and nodal finite element Von Mises color stress contours for the CRS shell and its attendant restraint straps. Supplemental NCVM features include: plotted instantaneous body segment acceleration-time responses; dummy displacements visually tracked using on-screen reference markers- to be tracked as a function of time; forwards or backwards animation capability; and stereo viewing, using anaglyphic stereo, to convey a sense of depth and immersion. This paper demonstrates the utility of the NCVM using a combination conventional/finite element system model of a recent-production child restraint system (CRS) and its three-year-old dummy occupant in a modified FMVSS 213 sled test environment...|$|R

Models configured with sophisticated computer analyses such as Madymo permit researchers to perform extensive “what if? ” and other exploratory studies {{at a fraction of the}} cost and time that would be required by means of physical testing alone. However, fully understanding and correctly interpreting the results generated by complex crash simulations is often an inherently difficult task, despite the availability of high-caliber, multi-perspective post-processing code imagery. The NYSCEDII CRS Visualization Module (NCVM) serves as a potentially useful 3 -D, fully integrated add-on component to the Madymo dynamics analysis software. This paper demonstrates the utility of the NCVM using a combination conventional/finite element system model of a recent-production child restraint system (CRS) and its three-year-old dummy occupant in a modified FMVSS 213 sled test environment. Primarily, the NCVM allows the user to immersively visualize, at every time step of the simulation, the Madymo-calculated imagery depicting: (1) the motion of, and interactions between, the CRS shell, human “dummy”, harness and <b>latch</b> belt <b>assemblies,</b> and applicable vehicle cabin-interior surfaces and structure; and (2) nodal finite element Von Mises color stress contours for the CRS shell and its attendant restraint straps. Supplementary NCVM features include the following: (a) instantaneous body segment acceleration-time responses which can be depicted using an on-screen plotting utility; (b) on-screen reference markers which enable selected dummy displacements to be tracked as a function of time; (c) the simulation is viewable as either a forward-continuous animation or- to better understand localized displacements- frame by frame, forwards or backwards; and (d) the simulation can be viewed in either active or anaglyphic stereo to convey a sense of depth and immersion. 1...|$|R
