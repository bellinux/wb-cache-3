40|$|ABSTRACT: The IAEA {{has never}} before been {{experienced}} with designing a credible safeguards approach for a <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> <b>reprocessing</b> plant. The safeguards discussion was initiated in 1988, {{but at that time}} no available model or guideline that {{could be used as a}} reference. The IAEA the State and JNFL has studied and discussed the safeguards approach and safeguards system, and established effective, efficient and credible safeguards for RRP, under extensive cooperation manner. This paper presents overview of the safeguards system at RRP from the operator’s viewpoint...|$|E
40|$|The {{implementation}} {{of an effective}} and efficient IAEA safeguards approach at <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> <b>reprocessing</b> facilities with large throughput and continuous flow of nuclear material requires the introduction of enhanced safeguards measures to provide added assurance about the absence of diversion of nuclear material and confirmation that the facility is operated as declared. One of the enhanced safeguards measures, a Solution Monitoring and Measurement System (SMMS), comprising data collection instruments, data transmission equipment and an advanced Solution Monitoring Software (SMS), is being implemented at a <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> <b>reprocessing</b> plant in Japan. SMS is designed {{as a tool to}} enable automatic calculations of volumes, densities and flow-rates in selected process vessels, including most of the vessels of the main nuclear material stream. This software also includes automatic features to support the inspectorate in verifying inventories and inventory changes. The software also enables one to analyze the flows of nuclear material within the process and of specified “cycles” of operation, and, in order to provide assurance that the facility is being operated as declared to compare these with those expected (reference signatures). The configuration and parameterization work (especially the analytical and comparative work) for the implementation and configuration of the SMS has been carried out jointly between the IAEA, Euriware-France (the software developer) and the Joint Research Centre (JRC) -Ispra. This paper describes the main features of the SMS, including the principles underlying the automatic analysis functionalities. It then focuses on the collaborative work performed by the JRC-Ispra, Euriware and the IAEA for the parameterization of the software (vessels and cycles of operation), including the current status and the future challenges.

40|$|The {{design and}} cost {{structures}} of conventional types of commercial reprocessing plant have been reviewed. Process functions offering the greater potential saving in capital cost have been identified. Unorthodox approaches to philosophies of plant layout, maintenance procedures, and radiation shielding have been formulated {{with the primary}} aim of reducing capital cost. Four conceptual designs have been made of a <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> <b>reprocessing</b> plant based on existing shear leach-solvent extraction technology, incorporating novel equipment types and unorthodox design philosophy. Preliminary capital cost estimates for the designs {{are in the range}} $ 37 - 41 x 10 6, indicating a 30 - 37 % reduction in comparison with a conventional plant of identical capacity and scope. Additional costs exceeding $ 30 x 10 6 could be incurred for refinement to effluent treatment and storage systems envisaged for environmental protection for any type of reprocessing plant...|$|E
40|$|<b>Large</b> <b>scale</b> {{spent fuel}} <b>reprocessing</b> plants and fuel {{fabrication}} facilities require {{large numbers of}} grab samples taken for destructive analysis (DA) for nuclear material accountancy and safeguards. The resulting cost and radioactive waste generation is large and significant time is lost between the sample taking and the DA results. This paper presents an approach to combine nondestructive assay (NDA) with DA calibration and normalization {{to reduce the number}} of chemical analysis and shorten the time to obtain the results. For plutonium bearing samples, the preferred NDA system is a modified version of the high efficiency epithermal neutron counter. These are well-type neutron counters with efficiencies in the range of 60 - 70 % and short neutron die-away times. The counting precisions of the new counters are an order of magnitude better than for prior thermal-neutron counters for multiplicity analysis. The accuracy goal for the NDA is in the range of 0. 2 - 0. 5 % for the Pu- 240 effective mass. The stability and statistical precision of the neutron counters are better than 0. 1 %, and the total measurement error will be dominated by how well the standards from the DA laboratory match the samples measured with the NDA. The analysis of the neutron data can be performed in the simple coincidence (doubles) mode, or the “known-alpha ” mode, or the “multiplicity ” mode. Each of these modes has advantages and disadvantages depending on the experimental conditions. This paper will evaluate the analysis methods to obtain to obtain the best accuracy. Also, the preliminary design of a neutron counter that is optimized for the measurement of small samples such as powder and pellets will be presented...|$|R

40|$|The German Government {{and federal}} {{authorities}} have stipulated {{in a special}} regulation that new nuclear power stations will only be licensed if safe waste management("Entsorgung") is guaranteed. Hence the energyproducing utilities commenced the planning of a national fuel-cycle-centre ("Entsorgungszentrum") which includes installations for reprocessing and ultimate storage. Detailed {{studies have shown that}} from a safety engineering viewpoint, there is no objection to this waste management concept.

40|$|Nuclear {{sustainability}} {{is generally}} {{believed to be}} only reachable through the building of many fast breeder reactors. This paper shows that there is another possibility by using existing reactors that are either thermal breeders or {{have at least a}} high conversion ratio and considerably smaller critical masses than fast systems. Earlier it was believed that thermal molten salt breeders could eventually use the thorium / 233 U cycle, which doesn¿t generate minor actinides and is therefore a cleaner fuel cycle. In the meantime, it has become rather clear that CANDU reactors that use heavy water cooling can also be self-breeders. The CANDU reactors could generate themselves 233 U in thorium targets and could become self-sustaining after 12 years. However, additional 233 U could also be generated in LWRs and fast reactors. It is shown that this generation of 233 U will allow a faster large-term nuclear expansion than fast reactors alone. There could actually be a synergy between thermal and fast breeders if the latter are run with Pu/Minor Actinides/Th fuel, which burns the minor actinides and generates sizeable amounts of 233 U. The main problem is still the necessary reprocessing on which India is working and intends to have in 10 years a <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> <b>reprocessing</b> facility available. However, there is at least an existing method for removing the 233 U by the fluoride volatility method and to further use it in CANDUs. For the preparation of the use of 233 U, we should attempt to run thorium subassemblies in CANDUs, LWRs, and fast reactors. Besides breeding 233 U or at least having a high conversion ratio, CANDUs have the further advantage that they don¿t need a pressure vessel and therefore could be built in large numbers faster than LWRs.

40|$|Abstract. Superparameterization is a {{multiscale}} numerical method wherein solutions of prog-nostic equations {{for small}} scale processes on local domains embedded within the computational grid of a <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> model are computed {{and used to}} force the <b>large</b> <b>scales.</b> It was developed initially in the atmospheric sciences, but stands on its own as a nascent numerical method for the simulation of multiscale phenomena. Here we develop a stochastic version of superparameterization in a difficult one dimensional test problem involving self-similarly collapsing solitons, dispersive waves, and a tur-bulent inverse cascade of energy from small to <b>large</b> <b>scales.</b> We derive the nonlinear model equations by imposing a formal scale separation between resolved <b>large</b> <b>scales</b> and unresolved small scales; this allows the use of subdomains embedded within the <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> grid to describe the local small scale processes. To decrease the computational cost, we make a systematic quasi-linear stochastic approximation of the nonlinear small scale equations and use the statistical mean of the nonlinear small scale forcing (the covariance) in the <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> equations. The stochastic approximation al-lows the embedded domains to be formally infinite (unrealistically <b>large</b> <b>scales</b> are suppressed on the embedded domains). Further simplifications allow us to precompute the small scale forcing terms in the <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> equations as functions of the <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> variables only, which results in significan...|$|R
