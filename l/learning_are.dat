5|$|Certain {{types of}} <b>learning</b> <b>are</b> possible, {{respective}} to each applicable type of learning, only within a limited age range {{known as a}} critical period. Bowlby's concepts included the idea that attachment involved learning from experience during a limited age period, influenced by adult behaviour. He did not apply the imprinting concept in its entirety to human attachment. However, he considered that attachment behaviour was best explained as instinctive, combined with the effect of experience, stressing the readiness the child brings to social interactions. Over time it became apparent there were more differences than similarities between attachment theory and imprinting so the analogy was dropped.|$|E

The principles discussed in this chapter included: learning occuring within a community of practice; <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> learner-centred; <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> flexible and based on individual needs; <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> resource-based, and technology-mediated; <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> both individual, and networked; <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> demonstrated when new, and valued knowledge <b>is</b> created; <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> cognitive, affective, social and sensory-motor; <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> best supported through constructive alignment of assessment, curriculum and pedagogy; and <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> best when activities are purposeful and aligned with assessment...|$|R

Rote <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> used in diverse areas, from mathematics to music to religion.

50|$|Situated <b>learning</b> <b>was</b> first {{proposed}} by Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger {{as a model}} of learning in a community of practice. At its simplest, situated <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> <b>learning</b> that takes place in the same context in which it is applied. Lave and Wenger (1991) argue that <b>learning</b> should not <b>be</b> viewed as simply the transmission of abstract and decontextualised knowledge from one individual to another, but a social process whereby knowledge is co-constructed; they suggest that such <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> situated in a specific context and embedded within a particular social and physical environment.|$|R
25|$|Areas of {{the brain}} {{responsible}} for planning and motor <b>learning</b> <b>are</b> sharpened. A related effect, caused by even low levels of alcohol, is the tendency for people to become more animated in speech and movement. This is due to increased metabolism in areas {{of the brain}} associated with movement, such as the nigrostriatal pathway. This causes reward systems in the brain to become more active, which may induce certain individuals to behave in an uncharacteristically loud and cheerful manner.|$|E

Several themes recur throughout these writings. Dewey continually argues that education and <b>learning</b> <b>are</b> social and interactive processes, and thus the school itself is a social institution through which social reform can and should take place. In addition, he believed that students thrive {{in an environment where}} they are allowed to experience and interact with the curriculum, and all students should have the opportunity to take part in their own learning.|$|E
