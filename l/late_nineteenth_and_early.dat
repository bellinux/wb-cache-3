5|$|A {{revival of}} {{interest}} in 'old-style' serif typefaces {{took place in the}} <b>late</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> twentieth century. This saw a revival of the Imprimerie royale typefaces (the office was now called the Imprimerie nationale following the end of the French monarchy), which, unlike Garamond's own work, had survived in Paris. The attribution came to be considered certain by the Imprimerie's director Arthur Christian.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the first}} {{description}} of a Dimetrodon fossil came a year earlier, when Cope named the species Clepsydrops limbatus from the Texas Red Beds. (The name Clepsydrops was first coined by Cope in 1875 for sphenacodontid remains from Vermilion County, Illinois, and was later employed for many sphenacontid specimens from Texas; many new species of sphenacodontids from Texas were assigned to either Clepsydrops or Dimetrodon in the <b>late</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> twentieth centuries.) C.limbatus was reclassified as a species of Dimetrodon in 1940, meaning that Cope's 1877 paper was the first record of Dimetrodon.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant General Sir Edwin Alfred Hervey Alderson, KCB (8 April 1859 – 14 December 1927) was {{a senior}} British Army officer who served in several campaigns of the <b>late</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> twentieth centuries. During the First World War he was placed {{in command of the}} Canadian Expeditionary Force {{during the first half of}} the war but made enemies amongst the Canadian {{political}} and military elite and suffered disastrous casualties during operations in 1915/16 which forced his sidelining and eventual retirement from service.|$|E
5|$|The tail of Dimetrodon {{makes up}} {{a large portion of}} its total body length and {{includes}} around 50 caudal vertebrae. Tails were missing or incomplete in the first described skeletons of Dimetrodon; the only caudal vertebrae known were the eleven closest to the hip. Since these first few caudal vertebrae narrow rapidly as they progress farther from the hip, many paleontologists in the <b>late</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> twentieth centuries thought that Dimetrodon had a very short tail. It was not until 1927 that a largely complete tail of Dimetrodon was described.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the main}} reasons for the {{delivery}} of the territory are the rubber boom, which occurred in the <b>late</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century <b>and</b> <b>early</b> twentieth century, <b>and</b> the revolt of the inhabitants of the region who were in mostly Brazilian.|$|R

5|$|Besides {{their main}} campus in Broadmoor, the {{congregation}} also operates Beth Israel Cemetery, {{listed on the}} National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Located at 19th Street and 5th Avenue, it was originally outside of Meridian's city limits and {{was intended to be}} a rural cemetery, but the city has since expanded and annexed the area containing the cemetery. The cemetery contains generations of German and Alsatian immigrants, as well as many big names of the largely mercantile Jewish community of the <b>late</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> twentieth centuries. Beth Israel Cemetery is the only remaining built memorial for many of Meridian's early Jews since the era of the 1879 and 1906 temple buildings, neither of which still stands.|$|E
5|$|The <b>late</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> {{twentieth century}} demand {{for coffee and}} rubber led to Brazil's coffee economy and rubber boom. At the time, it was {{estimated}} that seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's coffee supply was grown in Brazil, particularly in São Paulo, Minas Geraes, and Rio de Janeiro. The resulting profits meant that the Brazilian government collected much more revenue than in previous years. Simultaneously, there was an {{effort on the part of}} prominent Brazilian politicians, most notably Pinheiro Machado and Rio Branco, to have the country recognized as an international power. A strong navy was seen as crucial to this goal.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of an}} {{independent}} and united Armenia was the main goal of the Armenian national liberation movement during the <b>late</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> twentieth centuries. By the 1890s, a low-intensity armed conflict developed between the three major Armenian parties—the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnak), Hnchak and Armenakan— and the Ottoman government. Calls from the great powers for reforms in the Armenian provinces and Armenian aspirations of independence resulted in the Hamidian massacres between 1894 and 1896, during which up to 300,000 Armenian civilians were slaughtered by the order of Sultan Abdul Hamid II, after whom the massacres were named. After the 1908 Young Turk Revolution, some Armenians felt that the situation would improve; however, a year later the Adana massacre took place and Turkish-Armenian relations deteriorated further. After the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913, the Ottoman government was pushed to accept the reforms in the Armenian provinces in early 1914.|$|E
50|$|Much of {{the area}} that is Rua 25 de Março today was {{originally}} part of the Tamanduateí River. A series of river engineering projects in the <b>late</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>earlier</b> twentieth centuries realigned the Tamanduateí and Anhangabaú rivers, moving {{the river and the}} port further to the east. The old port, Porto Geral, lends its name to one of the major cross streets of 25 de Março, Ladeira Porto Geral. The original street name, “Rua de Baixo”, refers to the low (baixo) position of the land in comparison with the streets uphill to the west. In 1865 the name change was changed to commemorate the date of Brazil’s first constitution, signed on 25 March 1824.|$|R
50|$|In the <b>late</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century <b>and</b> <b>early</b> {{twentieth century}} Bassingbourn's primary {{industry}} was coprolite mining, followed by Playle's abattoirs.

5|$|Because the key {{distinguishing}} characteristic Marsh {{noted for}} Pteranodon was {{its lack of}} teeth, any toothless pterosaur jaw fragment, wherever it {{was found in the}} world, tended to be attributed to Pteranodon during the <b>late</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> twentieth centuries. This resulted in a plethora of species {{and a great deal of}} confusion. The name became a wastebasket taxon, rather like the dinosaur Megalosaurus, to label any pterosaur remains that could not be distinguished other than by the absence of teeth. Species (often dubious ones now known to be based on sexual variation or juvenile characters) have been reclassified a number of times, and several subgenera have in the 1970s been erected by Halsey Wilkinson Miller to hold them in various combinations, further confusing the taxonomy (subgenera include Longicepia, Occidentalia, and Geosternbergia). Notable authors who have discussed the various aspects of Pteranodon include Bennett, Padian, Unwin, Kellner, and Wellnhofer. Two species, P. orogensis and P. orientalis, are not pteranodontids and have been renamed Bennettazhia oregonensis and Bogolubovia orientalis respectively.|$|E
5|$|The temperance {{movement}} of the <b>late</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> twentieth century, and emergency laws aimed at restricting drinking during the First World War created difficult trading conditions for brewers. In 1919 net profit was reported at £22,325 (£900,000 at 2010 prices). Samuel Wentworth Webster, {{a director of the}} company and grandson of the founder, died in 1928 with a personalty of £45,000 (£2.2million in 2010). In 1928, one of the brewery's most successful beers was launched; Webster's Green Label, a light mild ale. In 1929 the company's entire stock of properties, land and brewery buildings was valued at £468,833 (£23.2million in 2010). The company took over Joseph Stocks of Halifax in December 1932, which could trace its origins back to 1790. In 1957, Webster's took over the brewer, John Ainley & Sons of Huddersfield and Woodhead Brothers of Elland, near Halifax, a mineral water manufacturer. The company dray horses, used for local beer deliveries, were retired {{by the end of the}} 1950s. In 1961 Webster's bought Daniel Fielding & Sons of Halifax, which added 19 public houses to their tied estate. The same year the company sought out partnership with the national brewer Watney Mann in order to benefit from the technical knowledge of the much larger company. In return Webster's brewed and sold the brewery conditioned Watney's Red Barrel ale throughout their tied estate. In 1962, a reciprocal trading agreement was reached with Ind Coope's North East division which saw Webster's houses stock lager for the first time. That same year the group won the contract to bottle Tuborg for West Yorkshire.|$|E
