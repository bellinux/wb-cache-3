5|$|A {{consistent}} {{shift from}} land based trade to sea based trade {{has been recorded}} since the last three millennia. The strategic advantages of port cities as trading centers are many: they are both less dependent on vital connections and <b>less</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> blockages. Oceanic ports can help forge trading relationships with {{other parts of the}} world easily.|$|E
5|$|At 05:37 {{an enemy}} contact report was made, and course {{was changed to}} {{starboard}} to close range. Neither ship was in good fighting trim. Hood, designed twenty-five years earlier, lacked adequate decking armour {{and would have to}} close the range quickly, as she would become progressively <b>less</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> plunging shellfire at shorter ranges. She had completed an overhaul in March and her crew had not been adequately retrained. Prince of Wales, with thicker armour, was <b>less</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> 15-inch shells at ranges greater than , but her crew had also not been trained to battle efficiency. The British ships made their last course change at 05:49, but they had made their approach too fine (the German ships were only 30 degrees on the starboard bow) and their aft turrets could not fire. Prinz Eugen, with Bismarck , had Prince of Wales and Hood slightly forward of the beam, and both ships could deliver full broadsides.|$|E
5|$|The oceans {{may have}} become more hospitable to life over the last 500million years and <b>less</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> mass extinctions: {{dissolved}} oxygen became more widespread and penetrated to greater depths; the development of life on land reduced the run-off of nutrients and hence the risk of eutrophication and anoxic events; marine ecosystems became more diversified so that food chains {{were less likely to}} be disrupted.|$|E
25|$|The Manasir are renowned all {{throughout}} the Sudan for cultivating {{a wide range}} of date palm cultivars. Any small farming household tends to grow a variety of dates in order <b>to</b> be <b>less</b> <b>vulnerable</b> both <b>to</b> annually changing market prices and diseases affecting only specific types.|$|R
25|$|Indian rhinos {{have few}} natural enemies, except for tigers, which {{sometimes}} kill unguarded calves, but adult rhinos are <b>less</b> <b>vulnerable</b> due <b>to</b> their size. Mynahs and egrets both eat invertebrates from the rhino's skin and around its feet. Tabanus flies, {{a type of}} horse-fly, are known to bite rhinos. The rhinos are also <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> diseases spread by parasites such as leeches, ticks, and nematodes. Anthrax and the blood-disease septicemia are known to occur.|$|R
5000|$|From {{conception}} to death, {{but particularly}} before adulthood, females are generally <b>less</b> <b>vulnerable</b> than males <b>to</b> developmental difficulties and chronic illnesses. [...] This {{could be due}} to females having two x chromosomes instead of just one, or in the reduced exposure to testosterone.|$|R
5|$|Some {{areas of}} the park were {{formerly}} part of the princely state of Tehri Garhwal. The forests were cleared to make the area <b>less</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> Rohilla invaders. The Raja of Tehri formally ceded {{a part of his}} princely state to the East India Company in return for their assistance in ousting the Gurkhas from his domain. The Boksas—a tribe from the Terai—settled on the land and began growing crops, but in the early 1860s they were evicted with the advent of British rule.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} are <b>less</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> cold than American crocodiles. Unlike an American crocodile, {{which would}} immediately {{succumb to the}} cold and drown in water at , an American alligator can survive in such temperatures for some time without displaying any signs of discomfort. This adaptiveness {{is thought to be}} the reason why American alligators are widespread further north than the American crocodile. In fact, the American alligator is found farther from the equator and is more equipped to handle cooler conditions than any other crocodilian. When the water begins to freeze, American alligators stick their snouts through the surface which allows them to breathe above the ice.|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of the 20th century it was clear that Gibraltar could be bombarded with {{relative}} impunity from the Spanish mainland. Proposals were put forward to build a new harbour {{on the east side of}} the Rock, where ships would be <b>less</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> direct artillery fire from the mainland, but were abandoned due to the vast expense and only marginal gains in security. A new round of tunnelling was carried out to provide more bombproof accommodation for the garrison, along with deep shelters and casemates capable of accommodating 2,000 men. Ultimately it was decided in 1906 that Gibraltar faced no credible threat from land and that the defences would be organised to deal with a threat from the sea.|$|E

30|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this article formulates an efficient methodology to accurately delineate the probable flood vulnerable zones in the rural blocks of Thiruvallur district. The results were validated by the flood hazard profile of the district. Special investigation is required in higher elevated and <b>less</b> <b>vulnerable</b> areas <b>to</b> find the suitable site for the construction shelters mainly, after analysing no vulnerable areas within the <b>less</b> <b>vulnerable</b> zones. Flood early warning system and safe flood evacuation routes are recommended for the blocks which fall in moderate and highly vulnerable zones. Based on the study the following conclusions and recommendations were arrived.|$|R
40|$|Pastoral {{traditional}} livelihood {{systems are}} under threat from drought and human predation. Those who diversified into irrigation farming are <b>less</b> <b>vulnerable</b> and able <b>to</b> re-invest in the pastoral economy and alternative livelihood activities.

5|$|Spanish {{weaponry}} {{and tactics}} differed greatly {{from that of}} the indigenous peoples. This included the Spanish use of crossbows, firearms (including muskets, arquebuses and cannon), war dogs and war horses. Horses had never been encountered by the Maya before, and their use gave the mounted conquistador an overwhelming advantage over his unmounted opponent, allowing the rider to strike with greater force while simultaneously making him <b>less</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> attack. The mounted conquistador was highly manoeuvrable and this allowed groups of combatants to quickly displace themselves across the battlefield. The horse itself was not passive, and could buffet the enemy combatant.|$|E
5|$|Both {{species may}} be {{affected}} by poor weather. Breeding colonies of Brazza's martins in river sandbars are liable to flooding, {{but this does not}} appear to be having a serious impact, and this species appears to be under no immediate threat. Its ability to use degraded habitats also aids its survival. Tropical cyclones present a threat to the Mascarene martin, particularly on the small islands inhabited by the nominate subspecies. The populations on Mauritius and Réunion were badly affected by a six-day cyclone in February 1861, taking many years to recover, but by about 1900 it was reported to be common but local, and in 1973–74 there were 200–400 pairs on Réunion and 70–75 pairs in Mauritius. More recent cyclones, like one in 1980, seem to have had less damaging effects than the 1861 storm. Several species have been lost from the Mascarene islands since human colonisation in the seventeenth century, but the martin and the Mascarene swiftlet occur on all the main islands, and are <b>less</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> the effects of human activities, especially since they can utilise houses for nest sites.|$|E
5|$|From autumn 1943 the Japanese {{government}} took further steps {{to prepare the}} country's major cities for air attacks. An air defense general headquarters was established in November and a program of demolishing large numbers of buildings in major cities to create firebreaks began the next month. By {{the end of the}} war 614,000 housing units had been destroyed to clear firebreaks; these accounted for a fifth of all housing losses in Japan during the war and displaced 3.5 million people. The government also encouraged old people, children and women in cities that were believed likely to be attacked to move to the countryside from December 1943, and a program of evacuating entire classes of schoolchildren was implemented. By August 1944, 330,000 schoolchildren had been evacuated in school groups and another 459,000 had moved to the countryside with their family. Little was done to disperse industrial facilities to make them <b>less</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> attack, however, as this was logistically difficult.|$|E

40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Hurricane Katrina, policy makers are once again debating {{the manner in which}} we prepare for, respond to, and recover from extreme events in the United States. While much is known about how to make urban regions safer, political and economic calculations often overwhelm these considerations. The mix of competing priorities and incentives of federal, state, and local officials conspire to make urban hazard planning difficult if not impossible. The consid-erable challenge facing those charged with making cities <b>less</b> <b>vulnerable</b> is <b>to</b> strike an appropri-ate balance between these political and economic dynamics, and the creation of more disaster-resilient communities...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we explore}} the {{cross-section}} of Japanese banks’ industrial loan portfolios {{over the last}} 34 years. We show that banks with diversified lending (generalists) and banks with focused lending (specialists) coexist. Similarly, industries with diversified borrowing (generalists) and industries with focused borrowing (specialists) also coexist. Interestingly, specialist banks and specialist industries rarely interact, suggesting significant overlap in banks’ loan portfolios. We introduce a model to describe these interaction patterns and identify a persistent and economically meaningful set of generalist banks/industries. We find that size is an important determinant for being a generalist. Finally, we show that generalist banks tend <b>to</b> be <b>less</b> <b>vulnerable</b> compared <b>to</b> specialist banks...|$|R
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{present a}} natural threat, {{particularly on the}} small islands inhabited by the nominate subspecies. The populations on Mauritius and Réunion were badly affected by a cyclone in February 1861, and a British ornithologist, Edward Newton, claimed not to have seen a single specimen on Mauritius between the six-day storm and June of the following year. It took many years for this population to fully recover, but by about 1900 it {{was reported to be}} common but local, and in 1973–74 there were 200–400 pairs on Réunion and 70–75 pairs in Mauritius. More recent cyclones, like one in 1980, seem to have had less damaging effects than the 1861 storm. A number of species in the region are vulnerable partly because they are restricted to one island, or are badly affected by habitat degradation or introduced predators, and several species have been lost from the Mascarene islands since human colonisation in the seventeenth century. The martin and the Mascarene Swiftlet occur on all the main islands, and are <b>less</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> the effects of human activities, especially since they can utilise houses for nest sites.|$|E

30|$|Additionally, it {{is often}} argued that foreign {{seasonal}} workers {{should be permitted to}} join and actively participate in unions in order <b>to</b> be <b>less</b> <b>vulnerable</b> and thus <b>to</b> be able to bargain for equal and fair working conditions. Both of these rights are vital and connected to each other.

50|$|In {{his book}} The Price of Admiralty, {{military}} historian Sir John Keegan {{noted that the}} brief conflict showed the irremediable vulnerability of surface ships to anti-ship missiles, and, most importantly, to submarines: despite the seemingly limited consequences of the war, it confirmed {{the dominance of the}} submarine in naval warfare. This is especially so, Keegan argues, because submarines are far <b>less</b> <b>vulnerable</b> than aircraft <b>to</b> counterattack, being able to approach and destroy their targets with almost complete impunity.|$|R

25|$|It {{has also}} been {{suggested}} that the oceans have gradually become more hospitable to life over the last 500 million years, and thus <b>less</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> mass extinctions, but susceptibility to extinction at a taxonomic level {{does not appear to}} make mass extinctions more or less probable.|$|E

25|$|South Korea is <b>less</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> typhoons than Japan, Taiwan, {{the east}} coast of China, or the Philippines. From one to three typhoons can be {{expected}} per year. Typhoons usually pass over South Korea in late summer, especially in August, and bring torrential rains. Flooding occasionally causes considerable damage, as do landslides, given the country's generally mountainous terrain.|$|E
50|$|The {{fortress}} churches surviving today {{date from}} the 15th century. Unlike the populations of towns and cities, villagers {{did not have the}} money to build defences around the whole settlement. They were no <b>less</b> <b>vulnerable,</b> however, <b>to</b> the military conflicts of their overlords and the associated raids and plundering. Large bands of marauders were also a danger not to be underestimated. The church was often the only stone building in the village and was, at least, best suited for defence. As a result, the various forms of defensible church appeared, from those surrounded by barns in which a siege of several days could be endured to a fortified cemetery (Wehrfriedhof), to simple fortified churches and, finally, the fortress church.|$|R
5000|$|Nick Bostrom and Eliezer Yudkowsky {{have argued}} for {{decision}} trees (such as ID3) over neural networks and genetic algorithms {{on the grounds}} that decision trees obey modern social norms of transparency and predictability (e.g. stare decisis), while Chris Santos-Lang argued in the opposite direction {{on the grounds that}} the norms of any age must be allowed to change and that natural failure to fully satisfy these particular norms has been essential in making humans <b>less</b> <b>vulnerable</b> than machines <b>to</b> criminal [...] "hackers".|$|R
40|$|A recent dendroecological study, {{carried out}} on silver-fir and beech mixed forests at two sites in Southern Apennines (Italy), showed {{interesting}} differential species-specific responses to climate. In particular, a strong influence on tree radial growth was exerted by the precipitation: summer drought stress was the main limiting factor for both species, however silver fir seems <b>less</b> <b>vulnerable,</b> possibly due <b>to</b> more effective drought avoidance mechanisms. These results might help defining conceptual models for ecosystem's response strategy at changing environmental conditions, and suggesting directions for further research {{on the effects of}} climate change on mountain forests in the Mediterranean region...|$|R
25|$|Shaurya {{missiles}} {{can remain}} hidden or camouflaged in underground silos from enemy surveillance or satellites till they are {{fired from the}} special storage-cum-launch canisters.

25|$|Most {{developing}} countries have abundant renewable energy resources, including solar energy, wind power, geothermal energy, and biomass, {{as well as}} the ability to manufacture the relatively labor-intensive systems that harness these.

2500|$|During Summer 1951, the two {{opposing}} sides settled {{into their own}} growing network of trenches a la World War I, and the forward air control situation changed. As the communists dug in, they operated only at night, and there were fewer and <b>less</b> worthy targets <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> tactical air strikes. Even as forward air control was less successful in finding suitable enemy targets, United Nations air forces allied with the USAF—the British air force, British navy, Australians, [...] South Africans, Greeks, and Thais—flew {{a large proportion of}} the CAS missions.|$|R
40|$|Openness {{to trade}} is {{one factor that}} has been {{identified}} as determining whether a country is prone to sudden stops in capital inflow, currency crashes, or severe recessions. Some believe that openness raises vulnerability to foreign shocks, while others believe that it makes adjustment to crises less painful. Several authors have offered empirical evidence that having a large tradable sector reduces the contraction necessary to adjust to a given cut-off in funding. This would help explain lower vulnerability to crises in Asia than in Latin America. Such studies may, however, be subject to the problem that trade is endogenous. We use the gravity instrument for trade openness, which is constructed from geographical determinants of bilateral trade. We find that openness indeed makes countries <b>less</b> <b>vulnerable,</b> both <b>to</b> severe sudden stops and currency crashes, and that the relationship is even stronger when correcting for the endogeneity of trade. ...|$|R
5000|$|An-2: The Antonov An-2 is {{propeller}} driven cargo {{and utility}} aircraft, the world's largest biplane. Although primarily {{used in the}} civilian role as an agricultural and firefighting aircraft in other countries, the An-2 is capable of transporting up to 14 passengers in its rear compartment. The North Korean Special Forces possesses around 300 of these aircraft, and due to its 845 km range, it may {{be used by the}} KPAF to deploy special forces agents well behind the South Korean front lines. Because the An-2 is almost silent and can operate at very low speeds, the An-2 may also be used as a light bomber in addition to its ability to paratroop special forces agents. Since the An-2 is a STOL aircraft that requires minimal runway space, the airfields for the An-2 are <b>less</b> <b>vulnerable</b> compared <b>to</b> others and may be placed discreetly around North Korea.|$|R
