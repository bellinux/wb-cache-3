5|$|As {{a result}} of Burger King's actions, Hungry Jack's owner Jack Cowin and his private holding company Competitive Foods Australia began legal {{proceedings}} in 2001 against Burger King's parent Burger King Corporation with a counter-claim {{that the company had}} violated the conditions of the master franchising agreement and was in breach of the contract. In a decision handed down by the Supreme Court of New South Wales that affirmed Cowin's claims, Burger King was determined to have violated the terms of the contract and as a result was required to pay Cowin and Hungry Jack's a $46.9million (Aus, $41.6million USD 2001) award. The court's decision {{was one of the first}} major cases in Australia that implied that the American <b>legal</b> <b>concept</b> of good faith negotiations existed with the framework of the Australian legal system, which until that verdict, had rarely been seen in the country's courts. In its decision, the Court stated that Burger King had failed to act in good faith during contract negotiations by seeking to include standards and clauses that would engineer a default of the franchise agreement, allowing the company to limit the number of new Hungry Jack’s branded restaurants and ultimately claim the Australian market as its own, a purpose that was extraneous to the agreement.|$|E

The article also shows how in the context of Article 234 EC preliminary ruling procedure <b>legal</b> <b>concepts</b> become useful tools of portraying ECJ judgments as mere products of interpretation and not as the results of subsuming {{the facts of the case}} into a legal provision. It is by means of application of <b>legal</b> <b>concepts,</b> that the ECJ judges are able to justify that they are not overstepping the mandate they have been entrusted with. In the same time the use of <b>legal</b> <b>concepts</b> enables them to engage in dialogue with national judges, who seek guidance as to the content ofEClaw rules, and to maintain a strong doctrine of precedent.

40|$|The use {{of maximum}} {{harmonization}} directives in EU private law {{in combination with}} open <b>legal</b> <b>concepts</b> is controversial. Due to differing legal cultures, {{it is likely that}} open <b>legal</b> <b>concepts</b> will be interpreted differently in the Member States. This seems to conflict with the aim of maximum harmonization as put forward by the European Commission: reducing legal fragmentation and increasing legal certainty among consumers and businesses. Although supporting the notion that national interpretations of open <b>legal</b> <b>concepts</b> are likely to differ, this article posits that this is not incompatible with the aim of maximum harmonization. It proposes a different understanding of the concept of maximum harmonization that allows for different national applications of the rules. This understanding is based on the distinction between harmonizing a legal framework (the written rules) and harmonizing the application of this legal framework. By acknowledging the importance of fully harmonizing the written rules without harmonizing the national applications of these rules, it demonstrates that maximum harmonization does not necessarily conflict with the use of open <b>legal</b> <b>concepts...</b>|$|R
25|$|For example, Church {{teaching}} {{heavily influenced}} the <b>legal</b> <b>concept</b> of marriage.

In a departure from societal norms, Church law required the consent of both parties before a marriage could be performed and established a minimum age for marriage. The elevation of marriage to a sacrament also made the union a binding contract, with dissolutions overseen by Church authorities.

In 1985, the Australian government returned ownership of Uluru (formerly known as Ayers Rock) to the Pitjantjatjara Aboriginal people.

25|$|It is {{important}} to note that while technology such as cryptographic systems can assist in non-repudiation efforts, the concept is at its core a <b>legal</b> <b>concept</b> transcending the realm of technology. It is not, for instance, sufficient to show that the message matches a digital signature signed with the sender's private key, and thus only the sender could have sent the message and nobody else could have altered it in transit (data integrity). The alleged sender could in return demonstrate that the digital signature algorithm is vulnerable or flawed, or allege or prove that his signing key has been compromised. The fault for these violations may or may not lie with the sender himself, and such assertions may or may not relieve the sender of liability, but the assertion would invalidate the claim that the signature necessarily proves authenticity and integrity; and, therefore, the sender may repudiate the message (because authenticity and integrity are pre-requisites for non-repudiation).|$|E
25|$|For some time, {{especially}} {{through the}} work of D. A. Binchy, the laws were held to be conservative and useful primarily for reconstructing the laws and customs of the Proto-Indo-Europeans just as linguists had reconstructed the Proto-Indo-European language. For instance, historians have seen similarities between Irish and Indian customs of fasting {{as a method of}} shaming a wrongdoer to recover a debt, or to demand the righting of a wrong. Other legal institutions prominent in early Irish law but foreign to most contemporary legal systems, {{such as the use of}} sureties, have been considered as survivals from earlier periods. More recently historians have come to doubt such attributions. While few historians argue that all Irish law comes from church influence, they are today much more wary as to what material is a survival and what has changed. A past may still be suggested for a certain <b>legal</b> <b>concept</b> based on Irish legal terms' being cognate with terms in other Celtic languages, although that information does not prove that the practice described by the legal term has not changed.|$|E
25|$|Another {{argument}} against Article 23 laws as {{drafted by the}} HK government has been given by John Kamm, who argues that the mechanism for banning organizations would {{have the effect of}} requiring that Mainland China be more repressive outside of Hong Kong. His argument is that since 1997, Mainland China has not had the <b>legal</b> <b>concept</b> of banning an organization on national security grounds, and that political repression in the PRC takes the form of government criminal charges against individual acts. He argues that the HK government's draft of Article 23 law requires the PRC to set up a system of banning organizations on national security grounds and this would greatly hurt members of politically sensitive organizations who are not leaders. He points out that the PRC currently typically imprisons only the leadership of an organization, and merely harasses lower-level members because their behavior does not {{rise to the level of}} criminal charges. By passing Article 23 law, Hong Kong will require the PRC to develop the legal mechanisms to punish all members of a banned political organization, a power it now only has with respect to religious organizations such as Falun gong and students who were involved in the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. For example, Macau, which has implemented the Article 23, identical to the article proposed for Hong Kong, in June 2009 refused transit to mainland China by a Tiananmen student leader Wu'er Kaixi.|$|E
40|$|<b>Legal</b> <b>concepts</b> {{are seen}} today as archaic relics of the past, and as {{representing}} a largely dispensable {{feature of the}} common law. This Article challenges the widely accepted view of <b>legal</b> <b>concepts</b> as remnants of formalist thinking, and argues that <b>legal</b> <b>concepts</b> {{play a crucial role}} in ensuring the vitality and subsistence of the common law over time, place, and context. <b>Legal</b> <b>concepts</b> embody what we term “a duality of meaning,” which effects a separation between a concept’s analytical and normative meanings. The analytical (or structural) meaning of a concept is, at its core, well-defined and remains stable over time, whereas the normative meaning of a concept, represented by the values it embodies, is subject to constant change and contestation. The duality of meaning enables the common law to realize a delicate balance between stability and change. Through the analytical meaning of its conceptual devices, the common law retains a constant structural framework in its various doctrines, while simultaneously allowing the normative meaning of those very concepts to accommodate plural and often-conflicting values and ideals. This conceptual architecture in turn enables the common law to adapt to changing social needs and values. The Article offers a detailed analysis of the various mechanisms of normative change that common law courts routinely employ by relying on the duality of meaning embodied in <b>legal</b> <b>concepts.</b> Recognizing the crucial role of <b>legal</b> <b>concepts</b> in the common law is more than just of theoretical significance: it is essential to understanding how the common law operates in practice and how it maintains its relevance through time. The Article details the important payoffs that flow from reinvigorating the centrality of conceptual analysis in the common law. Specifically, it demonstrates that the common law’s reliance on concepts can bridge the gap between legal formalism and legal realism, foster competition among values and ideologies in society; and most importantly, is indispensable to normative reasoning in the law...|$|R

Then, it was an [...] "empire" [...] long before it had an emperor. The Roman Republic was not a nation-state in the modern sense, but a network of towns left to rule themselves (though with varying degrees of independence from the Roman Senate) and provinces administered by military commanders. It was ruled, not by emperors, but by annually elected magistrates (Roman Consuls above all) in conjunction with the senate. For various reasons, the 1st century BC was a time of political and military upheaval, which ultimately led to rule by emperors. The consuls' military power rested in the Roman <b>legal</b> <b>concept</b> of imperium, which literally means [...] "command" [...] (though typically in a military sense).

500|$|Further, {{in attacking}} the {{distortion}} principle's application, Gozdor also argued against the principle as a <b>legal</b> <b>concept</b> {{in the first}} place. He wrote, [...] "Regardless of the Court's rationale for its distortion principle, determining a First Amendment violation by measuring whether the government used a subsidy 'in ways which distorted the medium's usual functioning' suggests that forum functions become unchangeable once created." [...] He claimed the unworkability of the distortion principle in a hypothetical example, which would moot {{the very existence of}} the Legal Services Corporation. [...] "Taking the Velazquez rationale to its logical ends", he wrote, [...] "the LSC subsidy itself could become an unconstitutional speech restriction. If Congress substantially increased LSC appropriations in order to allow LSC to take all of its cases ... the functioning of the legal system would be distorted because such a subsidy likely would result in a dramatic increase in the federal courts' caseloads." [...] With this in mind, he concluded with a process by which the Court should have decided the case: a process leading to the upholding of the restriction by finding that LSC's purpose was in promoting the government's message, in contrast to a diversity of private views.|$|E

We argue that the debate to date has been flawed by two fundamental mistakes. First, little attention has been paid to how legal taxonomies are actually used. This, we argue, is regrettable: how we build a taxonomy depends on why we build a taxonomy, and a clearer focus on this question produces an approach that is very different from the approaches that currently dominate private law theory. Secondly, both sides in the debate have misunderstood what <b>legal</b> <b>concepts</b> are, and hence tend to misuse them. We argue that <b>legal</b> <b>concepts</b> are Weberian ideal types, and use philosophical theories of concepts to put forward a very different understanding of how concepts acquire content and are used in the legal system.
