5|$|One of {{the goals}} of Mayor John Hylan's Independent Subway System (IND), {{proposed}} in the 1920s was a <b>line</b> to Coney Island, reached by a recapture of the BMT Culver <b>Line.</b> To connect this <b>line</b> to the Eighth Avenue Line–the main trunk of the IND–a subway <b>line</b> was to run from Brooklyn Borough Hall south under Jay Street, Smith Street, Ninth Street, and several other streets to Cortelyou Road (later Church Avenue) and McDonald Avenue, just north of the Ditmas Avenue elevated station. A ramp would then lead onto the elevated BMT Culver <b>Line.</b> This <b>line</b> was variously known as the Culver <b>Line</b> Extension, Culver−Smith Street <b>Line,</b> Smith Street <b>Line,</b> Smith Street–Prospect Park <b>Line,</b> Smith–Ninth Street <b>Line,</b> Jay–Smith–Ninth Street <b>Line,</b> Church Avenue <b>Line,</b> Prospect Park–Church Avenue <b>Line,</b> Prospect Park–Coney Island <b>Line,</b> Brooklyn <b>Line,</b> or South Brooklyn <b>Line,</b> though it was often simply referred to as the Brooklyn portion of the IND. As originally designed, service to and from Manhattan would have been exclusively provided by Culver express trains, while all local service would have fed into the IND Crosstown <b>Line.</b>|$|E
5|$|A First Avenue <b>line,</b> {{consisting}} of four tracks, would stretch from the Harlem River to City Hall. At 10th Street, the <b>line</b> would {{cease to be}} a four-track <b>line,</b> with the <b>line</b> splitting into two branches. One branch would run to a loop near City Hall, while the other {{would go to a}} new Lafayette Avenue <b>line</b> in Brooklyn, running via Third Avenue and the Bowery. On the northern end, at 161st Street, the <b>line</b> would split into two 3-track lines. One of the lines would go to Southern Boulevard and Fordham Road; the other would continue to 241st Street after merging with the existing IRT White Plains Road <b>Line</b> at Fordham Road and Webster Avenue.|$|E
5|$|A Jonline {{is a short}} <b>line</b> used by scuba divers {{to fasten}} {{themselves}} to something. The original purpose was to fasten a diver to a shot <b>line</b> during decompression stops in current. The <b>line</b> is typically around 1m (3 feet) long and equipped with a clip at each end. One clip is fastened to the diver's harness, {{and the other is}} used to fasten the <b>line</b> to the anchor <b>line.</b> In current this relieves the diver from holding on to the anchor <b>line</b> during the decompression stop.|$|E
50|$|The {{three groups}} of the <b>lines,</b> the Kobe <b>Lines,</b> the Takarazuka <b>Lines</b> and the Kyoto <b>Lines,</b> can be further grouped into two, the Kobe-Takarazuka <b>Lines</b> and the Kyoto <b>Lines</b> from a {{historical}} reason. Hankyu has two groups of rolling stock, one for the Kobe-Takarazuka <b>Lines</b> {{and the other for}} the Kyoto <b>Lines.</b>|$|R
50|$|Kraissl's <b>lines</b> are {{a set of}} {{anatomical}} skin <b>lines.</b> They {{differ from}} Langer's <b>lines</b> in that unlike Langer's <b>lines,</b> which are defined in term of collagen orientation, Kraissl's <b>lines</b> are the <b>lines</b> of maximum skin tension.|$|R
50|$|The 1947 {{commission}} called these <b>lines</b> spur <b>lines</b> {{at time of}} construction, in distinction to loop <b>lines,</b> {{however the}} completion of most sections made most <b>lines</b> loop <b>lines.</b>|$|R
5|$|A complex {{junction}} {{has been}} built north of St Pancras with connections to the East Coast Main <b>Line,</b> North London <b>Line</b> (for West Coast Main <b>Line)</b> and Midland Main <b>Line,</b> allowing {{for a wide variety}} of potential destinations albeit on conventional rails. As part of the works, tunnels connecting the East Coast Main <b>Line</b> to the Thameslink route were also built in readiness for the forthcoming Thameslink Programme.|$|E
5|$|A {{connection}} between the BMT Franklin Avenue <b>Line</b> and the IND Crosstown <b>Line</b> would be built {{through the construction of}} a <b>line</b> under Lafayette Avenue.|$|E
5|$|A fully {{electrified}} and double-tracked <b>line,</b> the Trans-Siberian Railway <b>line</b> {{is capable}} of transporting around 100 million tons of freight annually. The <b>line</b> can handle up to 200,000 TEU of containerized international transit freight per year.|$|E
50|$|Rugby {{league is}} {{played on a}} field 112-122 by 68 metres (122.5-133.4 × 74.3 yards). The longer {{boundary}} <b>lines</b> are touch <b>lines,</b> while the shorter boundary <b>lines</b> are dead ball <b>lines.</b> The touch <b>lines</b> and dead ball <b>lines</b> are out of play.|$|R
5000|$|The most {{extensive}} tram systems in France today {{are those in}} Lyon (6 <b>lines,</b> 78 km), Paris/Île-de-France (9 <b>lines,</b> 104.7 km), Montpellier (4 <b>lines,</b> 59 km), Strasbourg (6 <b>lines,</b> 55 km), Nantes (3 <b>lines,</b> 44 km) and Bordeaux (3 <b>lines,</b> 43 km).|$|R
25|$|Dashed <b>lines</b> have {{at various}} times {{indicated}} <b>lines</b> with limited service, <b>lines</b> under construction or <b>lines</b> closed for renovation.|$|R
5|$|A {{junction}} {{was built}} on the IND Queens Boulevard <b>Line</b> for the <b>line</b> under Van Wyck Boulevard. The junction was completed and has been connected to the IND Archer Avenue <b>Line.</b>|$|E
5|$|A <b>line</b> {{branching}} {{off of the}} IND Crosstown <b>Line</b> running via Franklin Avenue connecting with the BMT Brighton <b>Line.</b> This would have replaced the BMT Franklin Avenue <b>Line.</b>|$|E
5|$|A <b>line</b> {{branching}} {{off of the}} IND Fulton Street <b>Line</b> using the provisions for a <b>line</b> continuing via Pitkin Avenue, running via Pitkin Avenue and then turning onto Linden Boulevard and running via it to Springfield Boulevard.|$|E

50|$|This {{is a list}} of Railway <b>lines</b> in Pakistan. The <b>lines</b> and the {{stations}} are owned and operated by Pakistan Railways. Rail <b>lines</b> in Pakistan are divided into main <b>lines</b> and branch <b>lines.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The Lemoine point; L. The black <b>lines</b> are medians, {{the dotted}} <b>lines</b> are angle bisectors {{and the red}} <b>lines</b> are the symmedians (the {{reflections}} of the black <b>lines</b> in the dotted <b>lines).</b>|$|R
5|$|A new 4-track trunk <b>line</b> along Lafayette Avenue in Brooklyn from Borough Hall to Bedford Avenue. The <b>line</b> would narrow {{to three}} tracks to Broadway. Then the <b>line</b> would have {{continued}} underneath the BMT Jamaica <b>Line</b> to 168th Street. By running underneath the Jamaica <b>Line,</b> the <b>line</b> would directly {{compete with the}} BMT. A two-track connection would also be provided to a First Avenue <b>line.</b>|$|E
5|$|A new <b>line</b> running under Utica Avenue to Flatlands Avenue. The <b>line</b> {{would be}} {{a branch of the}} IRT Eastern Parkway <b>Line.</b>|$|E
5|$|A new subway <b>line</b> under 57th Street {{connecting}} the IND Sixth Avenue <b>Line</b> {{and the proposed}} Second Avenue trunk <b>line.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Lines</b> 1-3 are {{trolleybus}} <b>lines.</b> The remaining <b>lines</b> are operated {{exclusively by}} low-floor buses. Normally, articulated buses run on <b>lines</b> 5, 7 and 14. On the remaining <b>lines,</b> conventional (rigid chassis) buses provide the services.|$|R
5|$|<b>Lines</b> {{of poems}} are often {{organized}} into stanzas, which are denominated {{by the number}} of <b>lines</b> included. Thus a collection of two <b>lines</b> is a couplet (or distich), three <b>lines</b> a triplet (or tercet), four <b>lines</b> a quatrain, and so on. These <b>lines</b> may or may not relate to each other by rhyme or rhythm. For example, a couplet may be two <b>lines</b> with identical meters which rhyme or two <b>lines</b> held together by a common meter alone.|$|R
50|$|WR 148 shows {{a classic}} WN8h spectrum, {{but with the}} {{addition}} of weak central absorption on some of the emission <b>lines.</b> NIII and NIV emission <b>lines</b> <b>lines</b> are stronger than NV, and HeI <b>lines</b> are stronger than HeII, The Balmer series hydrogen <b>lines</b> and some other <b>lines</b> have P Cygni profiles.|$|R
5|$|A {{report from}} 9 July 1796 showed that Saint-Cyr's Center had two {{divisions}} under Duhesme and Taponier. In Duhesme's division, Dominique Vandamme's brigade included the 17th <b>Line</b> (2,793) and 100th <b>Line</b> (2,479), 20th Chasseurs à Cheval (254) and 11th Hussars (38). Duhesme's division counted 5,272 infantry and 292 cavalry. Taponier's division {{consisted of the}} brigades of Henri François Lambert, Antoine Laroche Dubouscat and Claude Lecourbe. Lambert led the 93rd <b>Line</b> (3,119) and 109th <b>Line</b> (2,769). Laroche directed the 21st Light (2,284) and 31st <b>Line</b> (2,840). Lecourbe commanded the 84th <b>Line</b> (2,692), 106th <b>Line</b> (3,186) and 2nd Chasseurs à Cheval (240). There were a total of 22,162 foot soldiers, 532 horsemen and 433 gunners in Saint-Cyr's wing. However, a 14 June report showed 919 troopers present in Saint-Cyr's command, including the 9th Hussars.|$|E
5|$|A second KKS <b>line</b> {{was opened}} on 27 March 1900, from Nybrua, {{located on the}} KSS's Grünerløkka–Torshov <b>Line,</b> via Trondheimsveien to Rodeløkka. Named the Rodeløkka <b>Line,</b> the {{southern}} section would later {{become part of the}} Sinsen <b>Line.</b> From Nybrua to the city centre, KSS track was used. The depot was located at Rodeløkka. A third <b>line</b> opened on 28 August 1900, from Tollbugaten in the city centre southwards to Festningsbryggen at Vippetangen—the Vippetangen <b>Line.</b> Again, KSS track was needed to connect the <b>line</b> into the city centre. Twenty cars and twelve trailers were bought from Busch with electric components delivered from Schuk—stock that remained in service until 1967. The company failed to make any profits, and was sold to KSS in 1905.|$|E
5|$|After the Bergen <b>Line</b> was electrified, {{the work}} {{continued}} on the Dovre <b>Line.</b> The section from Hamar to Otta was finished in 1967, {{and the following}} year to Dombås. This allowed the locomotives {{to be transferred to}} secondary lines. With the final delivery of the last units in 1969 and the completion of the electrification of the Dovre <b>Line</b> in 1970, the final steam locomotive was taken out of service. During {{the last half of the}} 1960s, the Di 3 was put into service on the Rauma <b>Line,</b> the Røros <b>Line,</b> the Solør <b>Line,</b> the Valdres <b>Line</b> and the Meråker <b>Line.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The period pm of moiré <b>lines</b> is the {{distance}} from one point where the <b>lines</b> of both layers overlap (at {{the bottom of the}} figure) to the next such point (at the top). Let us count the layer <b>lines,</b> starting from the bottom point. At the count 0 the <b>lines</b> of both layers overlap. Since in our case pr<pb, for the same number of counted <b>lines,</b> the base layer <b>lines</b> with a long period advance faster than the revealing layer <b>lines</b> with a short period. At the halfway of {{the distance}} pm, the base layer <b>lines</b> are ahead the revealing layer <b>lines</b> by a half a period (pr/2) of the revealing layer <b>lines,</b> due to which the <b>lines</b> are interleaving, forming a dark moiré band. At the full distance pm, the base layer <b>lines</b> are ahead of the revealing layer <b>lines</b> by a full period pr, so the <b>lines</b> of the layers again overlap. The base layer <b>lines</b> gain the distance pm with as many <b>lines</b> (pm/pb) as the number of the revealing layer <b>lines</b> (pm/pr) for the same distance minus one: pm/pr = pm/pb + 1. From here we obtain the well known formula for the period pm of the superposition image: ...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of flowering event factors, such as length of protogyny period, and time between full protogyny (FP) and anthesis initiation (AI) on infection by Claviceps fusiformis was studied in seven cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) <b>lines</b> (A <b>lines),</b> their corresponding maintainer <b>lines</b> (B <b>lines),</b> nine pollinator <b>lines</b> (R <b>lines),</b> and their 64 F 1 hybrids (A × R and B × R) of pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum). Three {{of the seven}} A <b>lines</b> had significantly longer protogyny than their corresponding B <b>lines.</b> The protogyny periods in R <b>lines</b> (range 38 – 84 hr) were shorter than in B <b>lines</b> (range 45 – 135 hr). Significant positive correlations were found between protogyny, the FP-AI period, and ergot severity in susceptible A or B <b>lines</b> and their F 1 hybrids, regardless of the susceptibility or resistance of R <b>lines,</b> but not in resistant A, B, and R <b>lines</b> and their hybrids. Seed set was generally more in B × R hybrids than in A × R hybrids, indicating poor restoration ability of R <b>lines.</b> Stigmas were longer in susceptible <b>lines</b> and their hybrids than in resistant <b>lines</b> and hybrids. The susceptibility of F 1 hybrids was closely associated with flowering event factors of susceptible A <b>lines.</b> No such relationship was found in resistant <b>lines.</b> This indicates {{that there may be}} a factor or factors independent of flowering events governing resistance in A <b>lines</b> and their hybrids. ...|$|R

5|$|After the six 735kV wires {{split up}} {{into two groups}} of three power lines each, the HVDC <b>line</b> follows the eastern group, and the western set diverges away. The <b>line</b> remains {{overhead}} until it reaches {{the north shore of}} the Saint Lawrence River near Grondines, where the 450kV HVDC <b>line</b> descends into an underwater tunnel traversing the river. The power <b>line</b> surfaces on the south shore near Lotbinière substation. After the river crossing, the <b>line</b> enters into the Nicolet terminal near Sainte-Eulalie, northeast of Drummondville. South of the terminal, the <b>line</b> heads south and after a relatively short distance, it enters the Des Cantons close to Sherbrooke.|$|E
5|$|All eight {{lines of}} the Oslo Commuter Rail have {{some or all of}} their {{services}} operate through the tunnel, although many of these terminate at Skøyen. The Airport Express Train operates four hourly services through the tunnel and the Norwegian State Railways operate regional trains along the Vestfold <b>Line</b> and intercity trains along the Sørland <b>Line</b> and Bergen <b>Line</b> through the tunnel. Freight trains along the Sørland <b>Line</b> operate through the tunnel, although only at night, while freight trains along the Bergen <b>Line</b> do not, instead using the Roa–Hønefoss <b>Line.</b>|$|E
5|$|All <b>line</b> {{markings}} on the pitch {{form part of}} the area which they define.
