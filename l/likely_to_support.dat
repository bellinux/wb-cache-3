The Cabildo compiled the guest list, and tried to guarantee the result, inviting people that would be <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> the Viceroy. The revolutionaries countered this move with a similar one, so {{that most people would}} be against Cisneros instead. The printer Agustín Donado, supporting the revolutionaries, printed nearly 600invitations instead of the 450requested, and distributed the surplus among the criollos. During the night, Castelli, Rodríguez, French and Beruti visited all the barracks to harangue the troops and prepare them for the following day.|$|E
5|$|Many of the powerhouses of English {{football}} {{came from}} the North – as of the 2016–17 season, of the 119 top-flight league titles since 1888, 79 (66%) have been won by teams based north of Crewe. Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United and, since 2001, Manchester City are among the mainstays of the Premier League, while teams like Blackburn Rovers, Middlesbrough, Newcastle United and Sunderland have had more inconsistent runs in recent years, regularly being promoted and relegated from the top flight. Local teams retain staunchly loyal followings, even in the lower leagues of football – a person from Doncaster, Barnsley or Rotherham would be more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> Doncaster Rovers, Barnsley F.C. or Rotherham United respectively than a Premier League team.|$|E
5|$|Since it {{can take}} decades of {{studying}} climate change and tracking bee colonies to find correlations between them, many researchers have turned to ecological modeling. In a Brazilian study, researchers investigated the impact that climate change will have on ten endemic bee species in various future climatic scenarios. It is known that moderate temperatures and high relative humidity impacts flight activity and foraging behavior in bee species such as Melipona and Centris. As a result, the scientists predict that in scenarios where temperatures continue to increase and humidity continues to decrease the only suitable climates for bees in Brazil {{will be in the}} more mountainous environments. The most optimistic scenario estimated climate change would still lead to a five percent reduction in these species’ populations. While this may not seem like a large change, bees are very sensitive to the effects of small population size; small populations can lead to reduced genetic variability and decreased fitness. As a result of this sensitivity, fragmented habitat are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> a viable population and may lead to additional colony collapse.|$|E

5|$|William of Poitiers {{describes}} a council called by Duke William, {{in which the}} writer gives an account of a great debate that took place between William's nobles and supporters over whether to risk an invasion of England. Although some sort of formal assembly probably was held, {{it is unlikely that}} any debate took place, as the duke had by then established control over his nobles, and most of those assembled would have been anxious to secure their share of the rewards from the conquest of England. William of Poitiers also relates that the duke obtained the consent of Pope Alexander II for the invasion, along with a papal banner. The chronicler also claimed that the duke secured the support of Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV and King Sweyn II of Denmark. Henry was still a minor, however, and Sweyn was more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> Harold, who could then help Sweyn against the Norwegian king, so these claims should be treated with caution. Although Alexander did give papal approval to the conquest after it succeeded, no other source claims papal support prior to the invasion. Events after the invasion, which included the penance William performed and statements by later popes, do lend circumstantial support to the claim of papal approval. To deal with Norman affairs, William put the government of Normandy into the hands of his wife {{for the duration of the}} invasion.|$|E

25|$|In {{analyzing}} which environments are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> life, {{a distinction}} is usually made between simple, unicellular organisms such as bacteria and archaea and complex metazoans (animals).
