5|$|After {{deciding}} not {{to renew}} the <b>lease</b> <b>on</b> the Four Acres, Albion moved to their fifth ground, Stoney Lane, {{in time for the}} 1885–86 season. The ground was located close to the Plough and Harrow public house, which served as the club's headquarters at the time. Albion took out an initial seven-year <b>lease</b> <b>on</b> the Stoney Lane site, paying an annual rent of £28 to its owner, a local undertaker named Mr Webb. The pitch was returfed and levelled, with ashes spread around the perimeter, and a wooden grandstand was built that {{came to be known as}} 'Noah's Ark'. The ground cost £370 to build, a sum that was offset by a number of friendly matches that took place early in the season.|$|E
5|$|Facing bankruptcy, the Marquess sold {{most of the}} {{contents}} of Ickworth House at auction in March 1994 for £2.3 million. He sold the remaining <b>lease</b> <b>on</b> the house back to the National Trust in April 1998, moving into Little Horringer Hall, a small house on the grounds.|$|E
5|$|Hibs {{played on}} The Meadows {{for the first}} two years of their history, before moving to grounds in Newington (Mayfield Park) and Bonnington Road, Leith (Powderhall), in {{different}} spells between 1877 and 1879. After the <b>lease</b> <b>on</b> Mayfield Park expired, Hibs moved to a ground known as Hibernian Park, on what is now Bothwell Street in Leith. Hibs failed to secure the ground lease and a builder started constructing houses on the site in 1890. Hibs obtained a <b>lease</b> <b>on</b> a site that is now known as Easter Road in 1892 and have played their home matches there since February 1893.|$|E

5|$|An {{agreement}} in principle was reached in December 2015 between the landlord of the stadium site (Cardiff Athletic Club) and its tenant (Cardiff Blues) to give the club a 150-year <b>lease</b> <b>on</b> the stadium site.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the expiry of the <b>lease</b> <b>on</b> the land, Penshurst Airfield closed on 28 July 1936. Air Travel Ltd moved to Gatwick. In 1938, the land was {{converted}} for use as a Polo ground by the Eridge Polo Club. Civil aircraft that were based at Penshurst include the Avro Avian III, Avro Avian IVM, Avro 504K and Avro 504N, de Havilland DH.60 Moth (various models), and Spartan Three-Seater.|$|E
5|$|Bosi had {{previously}} been head chef and won a Michelin star at the Overton Grange restaurant, just outside the town. He had intended to open a restaurant in Warwickshire, but found the premises too expensive and purchased a 25-year <b>lease</b> <b>on</b> the former Oaks property in Ludlow for £40,000. Within a year Hibiscus won its first Michelin star, {{and at the same}} time Overton Grange was downgraded before going into receivership.|$|E
5|$|Hibernian played {{its first}} match on the Meadows, on 25 December 1875. The club {{first moved to}} the Easter Road area in 1880, to a ground known as Hibernian Park. This {{location}} {{had the advantage of}} being equidistant between their two main sources of support, the Irish immigrant communities in the port of Leith and the Old Town of Edinburgh. When Hibs suffered financial difficulties in the early 1890s, the <b>lease</b> <b>on</b> Hibernian Park expired and developers started building what would become Bothwell Street. The club was reformed in 1892 and a <b>lease</b> <b>on</b> a piece of land called Drum Park was secured. The site had restricted access from Easter Road, a pronounced slope and was in close proximity to Bank Park, the home of Leith Athletic. There was a sense of continuity from the previous ground, however, and the supporters were keen to get started again. The first match at Easter Road was played on 4 February 1893, a friendly against Clyde.|$|E

The Hong Kong Basic Law, based on English law, would serve as the constitutional document after the transfer. It was ratified in 1990. The expiry of the 1898 <b>lease</b> <b>on</b> the New Territories in 1997 created problems for business contracts, property leases and confidence among foreign investors.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, ground {{development}} {{continued with}} roofing enhancements to the North Stand {{and an increase}} in capacity to 31,500 by 1963. Dressing rooms were constructed in 1965 and new turnstiles were introduced two years later, including a separate entrance for juveniles at the Churchmans end. In 1968 the club agreed to a new 99-year <b>lease</b> <b>on</b> the ground with owners Ipswich Borough Council.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the main}} canal was {{replaced}} by the railway, Kymer's dock continued to be used for the transfer of coal to coastal ships for another 50 years. Principal destinations included Laugharne, Carmarthen, St Clears and Llanstephan. The Kidwelly Corporation took out a <b>lease</b> <b>on</b> the dock in 1872, and the railway built a branch to it in 1873, which ran alongside the old canal. Most of the traffic had transferred to the railway by 1914, but some coasters continued to transport coal; the last recorded sailing was in the early 1920s, and was bound for Llanstephan.|$|E
5|$|Both were arrested, with Lennon {{pleading}} guilty to hashish possession, absolving Ono, who miscarried not long after. Lennon was fined £150 ($360). Note: in November1973, Pilcher was arrested for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice after it was alleged he had committed perjury. He was {{convicted and sentenced to}} four years imprisonment. After the raid, the landlord sought an injunction against Starr on 19February1969, forbidding anyone but Starr or his family to live there, and allowing no music or instruments to be played. Starr appealed, and a compromise was offered; only Starr or a family member would live in the flat. To finally settle the case, Starr sold the <b>lease</b> <b>on</b> 28February1969.|$|E
5|$|Butlin's {{inspiration}} for his holiday empire {{had come from}} a holiday to Barry Island in his twenties, when he had been locked out of his B all day by his landlady. He finally decided to build the last and smallest of the camps there in 1965. Butlin took out a 99-year <b>lease</b> <b>on</b> the headland at Nell's Point, Barry Island, in 1966. Building work began there in the winter and the gates opened to campers on 18 June 1966. Butlin retired in 1969 and the Barry Island camp was the last opening under his management.|$|E

Case remained owner and manager of the hotel {{until his death in}} June 1946. In October that year, The Algonquin was purchased by Ben Bodne of Charleston, South Carolina for just over US$1 million. Bodne undertook an extensive restoration and renovation effort. Bodne sold the hotel in 1987 to a group of Japanese investors and the Algonquin changed hands a number of times before ending up with Miller Global Properties in 2002. Following a two-year, US$3 million renovation, the hotel was sold again in 2005 to HEI Hospitality.|$|E
5|$|From 1893–1912, {{the team}} used area parks such as Brisbane Park, Ponce de Leon Park, and Piedmont Park {{as the home}} field. Georgia Tech took out a seven-year <b>lease</b> <b>on</b> {{what is now the}} {{southern}} end of Grant Field, although the land was not adequate for sports, due to its unleveled, rocky nature. In 1905, Heisman had 300 convict laborers clear rocks, remove tree stumps, and level out the field for play; Tech students then built a grandstand on the property. The land was purchased by 1913, and John W. Grant donated $15,000 towards the construction of the field's first permanent stands; the field was named Grant Field in honor of the donor's deceased son, Hugh Inman Grant.|$|E
5|$|In 1893, Rush {{moved his}} family to Sydney. The Banks Crash reduced many Australian {{businessmen}} to ruin, Rush included. His business was built on credit alone: Rush did not even own the Grafton house {{where he and his}} family lived, having mortgaged it from the man who sold it to him. He borrowed from local banks, using his store-keeping business as security. In Sydney, Rush took a <b>lease</b> <b>on</b> the York Hotel, at the corner of King and York Streets, which quickly became known as 'Mick Rush's Hotel', a popular venue for meetings of sportsmen. During the next decade, Rush kept several hotels in the city of Sydney, and operated also as a hotel broker.|$|E
