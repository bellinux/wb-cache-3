40|$|The {{physics of}} <b>light-matter</b> <b>interactions</b> is {{strongly}} constrained {{by both the}} small value of the fine-structure constant and {{the small size of}} the atom. Overcoming these limitations is a long-standing challenge. Recent theoretical and experimental breakthroughs have shown that two dimensional systems, such as graphene, can support strongly confined light in the form of plasmons. These 2 D systems have a unique ability to squeeze the wavelength of light by over two orders of magnitude. Such high confinement requires a revisitation of the main assumptions of <b>light-matter</b> <b>interactions.</b> In this letter, we provide a general theory of <b>light-matter</b> <b>interactions</b> in 2 D systems which support plasmons. This theory reveals that conventionally forbidden <b>light-matter</b> <b>interactions,</b> such as: high-order multipolar transitions, two-plasmon spontaneous emission, and spin-flip transitions can occur on very short time-scales - comparable to those of conventionally fast transitions. Our findings enable new platforms for spectroscopy, sensing, broadband light generation, and a potential test-ground for non-perturbative quantum electrodynamics.

40|$|Photonics is {{generally}} regarded as the most promising industry to continue the technological evolution when electronic devices reach their fundamental limits on operating speeds and bandwidth. Nonetheless, more efficient control of <b>light-matter</b> <b>interactions</b> is required to harness its full potential. 1 D and 2 D photonic crystals have shown the ability to manipulate <b>light-matter</b> <b>interactions.</b> However, if all-optical devices are to be realized, the guiding of light should be in 3 D to allow miniaturization. In this dissertation, we assessed the feasibility of exploiting the anomalous dispersion in 3 D photonic crystals to influence various <b>light-matter</b> <b>interactions</b> in the visible range. This included both the development of two novel fabrication methods to integrate <b>light-matter</b> <b>interactions</b> in a 3 D photonic crystal architecture and the characterization of the resulting materials. The most convenient and inexpensive way to fabricate 3 D photonic crystals is by self-assembling colloidal particles into a crystalline structure. The spectral position and amplitude of the photonic band gap in such colloidal crystals can be tuned during fabrication, which {{is necessary for the}} systematic investigation of their influence on <b>light-matter</b> <b>interactions.</b> By templating these colloidal crystals with a doped epoxy, additional functionality can be introduced while maintaining the photonic crystal architecture. We developed a novel templating procedure to ensure uniformity and spatial control of the optical functionality, which is required for reliable and reproducible characterization. By employing this novel method, we successfully integrated fluorescence, upconversion, second- and third-harmonic generation and chirality into 3 D photonic crystals. We demonstrated that the reduced density of optical states causes suppression of both fluorescence and upconversion when the photonic band gap coincided with the luminescence peak. When second-harmonic generation was induced, there were indications of wavevector matching due to the anomalous dispersion of the photonic band gap. A second templating method was developed to engineer a pass band into the photonic band gap by spin-coating a defect layer between two inverse opals. Since the defect layer can be doped to locally introduce optical functionality, a whole new range of research topics can be addressed. Although the architecture was well-defined and displayed pass bands on a microscopic scale, optimization is required to ensure long-range pass band uniformity. Concisely, we established a platform to investigate <b>light-matter</b> <b>interactions</b> inside 3 D photonic crystals. This strategy was employed to demonstrate wavevector matching in harmonic generation and luminescence suppression. The options to vary the structural and functional properties of the 3 D photonic crystals are plentiful when applying the described templating methods. This strong tunability leaves ample room for creativity. As such, it will help the systematic investigation and improvement of existing effects in these structures, while providing a research platform for the discovery and demonstration of novel effects. In terms of technological applications, this research will {{contribute to the development of}} highly efficient lasers, electro-optical modulators, organic light emitting diodes, organic photovoltaics, and optical switches. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|The {{semiconductor}} Bloch equations (abbreviated as SBEs) {{describe the}} optical response of semiconductors excited by coherent classical light sources, such as lasers. They {{are based on}} a full quantum theory, and form a closed set of integro-differential equations for the quantum dynamics of microscopic polarization and charge carrier distribution. The SBEs are named after the structural analogy to the optical Bloch equations that describe the excitation dynamics in a two-level atom interacting with a classical electromagnetic field. As the major complication beyond the atomic approach, the SBEs must address the many-body interactions resulting from Coulomb force among charges and the coupling among lattice vibrations and electrons. The SBEs {{are one of the most}} sophisticated and successful approaches to describe optical properties of semiconductors originating from the classical <b>light-matter</b> <b>interaction,</b> once the many-body theory are systematically included.|$|E

40|$|When {{the light}} interacts with matters in a lossy cavity, in the {{standard}} cavity quantum electrodynamics, the dissipation of cavity fields is characterized simply by {{the strengths of the}} two couplings: the <b>light-matter</b> <b>interaction</b> and the system-environment coupling through the cavity mirror. However, in the ultrastrong <b>light-matter</b> <b>interaction</b> regime, the dissipation depends also on whether the two couplings are mediated by the electric field or the magnetic one (capacitive or inductive in superconducting circuits). Even if we know correctly the microscopic mechanism (Lagrangian) of the system-environment coupling, the coupling Hamiltonian itself is in principle modified due to the ultrastrong interaction in the cavity. In this paper, we show a recipe for deriving a general expression of the Hamiltonian of the system-environment coupling, which is applicable even in the ultrastrong <b>light-matter</b> <b>interaction</b> regime in the good-cavity and independent-transition limit.
