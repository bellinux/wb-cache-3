The recipe involves <b>lightly</b> <b>floured</b> beef cubes (not strips) sautéed, sauced with prepared mustard and bouillon, and finished {{with a small amount}} of sour cream: no onions, no mushrooms. A competition purported to have taken place in 1890 is sometimes mentioned in the dish's history, but both the recipe and the name existed before then. Another recipe, this one from 1909, adds onions and tomato sauce, and serves it with crisp potato straws, which are considered the traditional side dish for Beef Stroganoff in Russia. [...] The version given in the 1938 Larousse Gastronomique includes beef strips, and onions, with either mustard or tomato paste optional.|$|E
