500|$|In 1935, BSA President Walter W. Head {{attended}} the eighth International Boy Scout Conference in Stockholm, Sweden. He met with James E. West, Scouting's founder Baden Powell, and his aide, Gilwell Park's second camp chief John Skinner Wilson. Wilson was persuaded {{to visit the}} United States during 1936 and spend three months teaching others about Wood Badge. During May 1936, he conducted two Wood Badge courses at Mortimer L. Schiff Scout Reservation. Wilson {{had been told to}} [...] "follow the book" [...] as it was done in England, which he faithfully did, including the English menu with dishes like boiled <b>leg</b> <b>of</b> <b>lamb</b> and boiled ham. Wilson had a reputation as a [...] "dour Scot" [...] and he brooked no discussion during his course. William Hillcourt was a participant in that first course and four days later, he was the senior patrol leader for the second course. He received his Wood Badge beads in 1939 and was appointed as the deputy camp director for Wood Badge.|$|E
500|$|In the 21st century, {{the nations}} {{with the highest}} {{consumption}} of sheep meat are the Arab States of the Persian Gulf, New Zealand, Australia, Greece, Uruguay, the United Kingdom and Ireland. These countries eat 14–40lbs (3–18kg) of sheep meat per capita, per annum. Sheep meat is also popular in France, Africa (especially the Maghreb), the Caribbean, {{the rest of the}} Middle East, India, and parts of China. This often reflects a history of sheep production. In these countries in particular, dishes comprising alternative cuts and offal may be popular or traditional. Sheep testicles—called animelles or lamb fries—are considered a delicacy {{in many parts of the}} world. Perhaps the most unusual dish of sheep meat is the Scottish haggis, composed of various sheep innards cooked along with oatmeal and chopped onions inside its stomach. [...] In comparison, countries such as the U.S. consume only a pound or less (under 0.5kg), with Americans eating 50pounds (22kg) of pork and 65pounds (29kg) of beef. In addition, such countries rarely eat mutton, and may favor the more expensive cuts of lamb: mostly lamb chops and <b>leg</b> <b>of</b> <b>lamb.</b>|$|E

60|$|So far as {{ministering to}} our wants was concerned, Master Lord showed himself most generous.

6000|$|My eldest boy, just {{home from}} China, was descried by Townshend's Henri {{the moment he}} landed at Marseilles, and was by him borne in triumph to Townshend's rooms. The weather was snowy, slushy, beastly; and Marseilles was, as it usually is to my thinking, well-nigh intolerable.

40|$|July 1 has rolled {{past and}} Australia has a carbon tax. As Government Ministers prepare {{to hit the}} road to spruik the {{benefits}} of the tax, it’s worth shining a spotlight on the kinds of messages they love to tell the Australian electorate in an effort to promote support for their policy. After all, a lot rests on their ability to convince the public that the carbon tax is the best way forward. What are the strategies that the government are using to turn the tide against this unpopular policy? The carbon tax message: no cost to you Foremost among these is that the tax will not pose a personal cost or imposition to the individual. The Government has distributed leaflets to Australian households; there are advertisements for the compensation scheme on the television and radio (advertisements which were criticised for not bearing any mention of the carbon tax); and media coverage has been saturated with ministers wielding <b>legs</b> <b>of</b> <b>lamb</b> and visiting the supermarket. In an effort to mitigate political pain, the government are focusing its efforts on promoting the message that the tax will not “cost” or, at least, it won’t cost those who can’t afford to pay...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Thirty-six Suffolk ewes were {{randomly}} {{divided into two}} equal groups. One group received a selenium (Se) deficient diet, while the other diet contained sodium selenite {{at a level of}} 0. 2 ppm Se in the total diet. All ewes were sampled for plasma glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and whole blood Se at forty-day intervals for 160 days. The Se and GPx levels <b>of</b> <b>lambs</b> born to these ewes were determined at three and six weeks of age. Plasma creatine kinase (PCK) levels <b>of</b> <b>lambs</b> were determined weekly to monitor development of nutritional muscular dystrophy (NMD). Surgical biopsies of semitendinosus muscle were taken from alternate <b>legs</b> <b>of</b> <b>lambs</b> at two-week intervals, commencing at two weeks of age. Muscle specimens were prepared for histologic, histochemical and electron microscopic examination. None of the Se supplemented lambs developed NMD, while 13 of 14 Se deficient lambs were affected. The earliest evidence of NMD was an elevated PCK, which preceded ultrastructural changes by two weeks, and histological and histochemical changes by four weeks. Early ultrastructural changes were characterized by swelling or condensation of mitochondria accompanied by swelling and fragmentation of sarcoplasmic reticulum. Subsequent ultrastructural changes included collapse of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, rupture of mitochondria, loss of myofi-brillar structure, and disruption of sarcomeres. Histochemical changes included reduced adenosine triphosphatase, reduced or enhanced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide tetrazolium reductase, and hetero-genous periodic acid schiffs, stain reaction, as well as foci of enhanced acid phosphatase reaction. The histochemical and ultrastructural results indicated a mitochondrial defect as a basis for Se deficiency-induced NMD. Spontaneous recovery from NMD occurred in most lambs with complete remission of histologic, histochemical and ultrastructural abnormalities six weeks after peak PCK, except that some mitochondria remained swollen through the ten-week period following peak PCK. Two lambs with NMD were injected with sodium selenite. The nature of the recovery process in the muscles <b>of</b> these <b>lambs</b> paralleled non-injected lambs but was slightly accelerated...|$|R
60|$|At {{the moment}} of departure, we were {{surprised}} to have enter the diligence a fellow-countryman, whom we had first seen on the road from Naples to Rome. He had since crossed our path with that iteration of travel which brings you {{again and again in}} view of the same trunks and the same tourists in the round of Europe, and finally at Civita Vecchia he had turned up, a silent spectator of our scene with the agent of the diligence, and had gone off apparently a confirmed passenger by steamer. Perhaps a nearer view of the sailor's hornpipe, as danced by that vessel in the harbor, shook his resolution. At any rate, here he was again, and with his ticket for Follonica,--a bright-eyed, rosy-cheeked man, and we will say a citizen of Portland, though he was not. For the first time in our long acquaintance with one another's faces, we entered into conversation, and wondered whether we should find brigands or any thing to eat on the road, without expectation of finding either. In respect of robbers, we were not disappointed; but shortly after nightfall we stopped at a lonely post-house to change horses, and found that the landlord had so far counted on our appearance as to have, just roasted and fragrantly fuming, a <b>leg</b> <b>of</b> <b>lamb,</b> with certain small fried fish, and a sufficiency of bread. It was a very lonely place as I say; the sky was gloomy overhead; and the wildness of the landscape all about us gave our provision quite a gamy flavor; and brigands could have added nothing to our sense of solitude.|$|E
60|$|They now {{entered the}} Bishop's Head, and had their {{dinner in the}} room where Shelton had given his Derby dinner to four-and-twenty well-bred youths; here was the picture of the racehorse that the wineglass, thrown by one of them, had missed when it hit the waiter; and there, serving Crocker with anchovy sauce, was the very waiter. When they had finished, Shelton felt the old desire to rise with {{difficulty}} from the table; the old longing to patrol the streets with arm hooked in some other arm; the old eagerness to dare and do something heroic--and unlawful; the old sense that he was of the forest set, in the forest college, of the forest country in the finest world. The streets, all grave and mellow in the sunset, seemed to applaud this after-dinner stroll; the entrance quad of his old college--spaciously majestic, monastically modern, for years the heart of his universe, the focus of what had gone before it in his life, casting the shadow of its grey walls over all that had come after-brought him a sense of rest from conflict, and trust in his own important safety. The garden-gate, whose lofty spikes he had so often crowned with empty water-bottles, failed to rouse him. Nor when they passed the staircase where he had flung a <b>leg</b> <b>of</b> <b>lamb</b> at some indelicate disturbing tutor, did he feel remorse. High on that staircase were the rooms in which he had crammed for his degree, upon the system by which the scholar simmers on the fire of cramming, boils over at the moment of examination, and is extinct for ever after. His coach's face recurred to him, a man with thrusting eyes, who reeled off knowledge all the week, and disappeared to town on Sundays.|$|E
60|$|Of course, in our {{existing}} modern cookery, {{very few}} simple and uncompounded tastes are still left to us; {{everything is so}} mixed up together that only by an effort of deliberate experiment can one discover what are the special effects of special tastes upon the tongue and palate. Salt is mixed with almost everything we eat--sal sapit omnia--and pepper or cayenne is nearly equally common. Butter is put into the peas, which have been previously adulterated by being boiled with mint; and cucumber is unknown except in conjunction with oil and vinegar. This makes it comparatively {{difficult for us to}} realise the distinctness of the elements which go to make up most tastes as we actually experience them. Moreover, a great many eatable objects have hardly any taste of their own, properly speaking, but only a feeling of softness, or hardness, or glutinousness in the mouth, mainly observed in the act of chewing them. For example, plain boiled rice is almost wholly insipid; but even in its plainest form salt has usually been boiled with it, and in practice we generally eat it with sugar, preserves, curry, or some other strongly flavoured condiment. Again, plain boiled tapioca and sago (in water) are as nearly tasteless as anything can be; they merely yield a feeling of gumminess; but milk, in which they are oftenest cooked, gives them a relish (in the sense here restricted), and sugar, eggs, cinnamon, or nutmeg are usually added by way of flavouring. Even turbot has hardly any taste proper, except in the glutinous skin, which has a faint relish; the epicure values it rather because of its softness, its delicacy, and its light flesh. Gelatine by itself is merely very swallowable; we must mix sugar, wine, lemon-juice, and other flavourings {{in order to make it}} into good jelly. Salt, spices, essences, vanilla, vinegar, pickles, capers, ketchups, sauces, chutneys, lime-juice, curry, and all the rest, are just our civilised expedients for adding the pleasure of pungency and acidity to naturally insipid foods, by stimulating the nerves of touch in the tongue, just as sugar is our tribute to the pure gustatory sense, and oil, butter, bacon, lard, and the various fats used in frying to the sense of relish which forms the last element in our compound taste. A boiled sole is all very well when one is just convalescent, but in robust health we demand the delights of egg and bread-crumb, which are after all only the vehicle for the appetising grease. Plain boiled macaroni may pass muster in the unsophisticated nursery, but in the pampered dining-room it requires the aid of toasted parmesan. Good modern cookery is the practical result of centuries of experience in this direction; the final flower of ages of evolution, devoted to the equalisation of flavours in all human food. Think of the generations of fruitless experiment that must have passed before mankind discovered that mint sauce (itself a cunning compound of vinegar and sugar) ought to be eaten with <b>leg</b> <b>of</b> <b>lamb,</b> that roast goose required a corrective in the shape of apple, and that while a pre-established harmony existed between salmon and lobster, oysters were ordained beforehand by nature as the proper accompaniment of boiled cod. Whenever I reflect upon such things, I become at once a good Positivist, and offer up praise in my own private chapel to the Spirit of Humanity which has slowly perfected these profound rules of good living.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of finishing systems on natural pasture and gender on the carcass quality, parts and tissue development <b>of</b> <b>lambs.</b> Forty-five non-castrated males and forty-five females were distributed in a completely randomized design into three treatments: lamb with mother kept on pasture; weaned lamb kept on pasture and weaned lamb kept on pasture with supplementation (soybean hulls at 1 % of body weight). The criteria for slaughter was body condition score (2. 0 - 3. 0). The carcass characteristics and parts composition were influenced by the sex. The finishing system with supplementation promoted greater carcass yield and longer leg length. The tissue composition was different only for the sex, with the males presenting bigger amount of muscle mass. The allometric growth of shoulder <b>of</b> supplemented <b>lambs</b> and the shoulder and <b>leg</b> <b>of</b> the <b>lambs</b> with mother had been precocious, while the ribs <b>of</b> the supplemented <b>lambs</b> and lambs with the mother were late and the other components had growth similar to the half-carcass. For the females, only shoulder <b>of</b> <b>lambs</b> finished with mother presented precocious growth, being isogonic for the other cuts. The finished systems evaluated demonstrated that Texel × Corrierdale lambs slaughtered with similar body condition score present similar carcass quality. The development is influenced by the termination system and sex. The quali-quantitative characteristics of the carcass were influenced by the sex. The development of the regional components of the males are influenced by the finishing system. Nevertheless, the tissu components are not influenced by the finishing system or gender...|$|R
