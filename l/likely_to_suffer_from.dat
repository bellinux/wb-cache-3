5|$|The idea {{of group}} living has been {{discussed}} by many evolutionists for its costs and benefits. Alexander predicted that the cost to large groups {{is that they are}} more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> parasitism, but at the same time, they benefit by defense against predation. This theory is not supported in the case of P.exclamans because the parasitism does not always increase with nest size and the predation rate was independent of size.|$|E
5|$|Follow-ups of {{untreated}} {{people over}} thirty {{with a history}} of severe allergic reactions would greatly benefit from venom immunotherapy. Both rapid and slow doses can be done safely during immunotherapy. The efficacy (capacity to induce a therapeutic effect) of ant venom immunotherapy is effective in reducing systemic reactions in comparison to placebo and whole body extract immunotherapy, where patients were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> a systemic reaction. Ultrarush initiation of insect immunotherapy may be used, but results show higher risks of allergic reactions. Despite immunotherapy being successful, only ten percent of patients do not have any response to desensitisation.|$|E
5|$|Many horses died as {{a result}} of the {{conditions}} at the front—of exhaustion, drowning, becoming mired in mud and falling in shell holes. Other horses were captured after their riders were killed. Horses also endured poor feeding and care, poison gas attacks that injured their respiratory systems and skin, and skin conditions such as mange. When gas warfare began in 1915, nose plugs were improvised for the horses to allow them to breathe during attacks. Later, several types of gas masks were developed by both the Central and Allied nations, although horses often confused them with feedbags and destroyed them. Soldiers found that better-bred horses were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>suffer</b> <b>from</b> shell shock and act up when exposed to the sights and sounds of war than less-well-bred animals, who often learned to lie down and take cover at the sound of artillery fire. Veterinary hospitals were established to assist horses in recovering from shell shock and battle wounds, but thousands of equine corpses still lined the roads of the Western Front. In one year, 120,000horses were treated for wounds or disease by British veterinary hospitals alone. Ambulances and field veterinary hospitals were required to care for the horses, and horse trailers were first developed for use on the Western Front as equine ambulances. Disease was also a major issue for horses at the front, with equine influenza, ringworm, sand colic, sores from fly bites, and anthrax among the illnesses that affected them. British Army Army Veterinary Corps hospitals treated 725,216 horses over the course of the war, successfully healing 529,064. Horses were moved from the front to veterinary hospitals by several methods of transportation, including on foot, by rail and by barge. During the last months of the war, barges were considered ideal transportation for horses suffering wounds from shells and bombs.|$|E

40|$|Within the {{economics}} literature, the "psychic costs" of migration have {{been incorporated into}} theoretical models since Sjaastad (1962). However, {{the existence of such}} costs has rarely been investigated in empirical papers. In this paper, we look at the psychic costs of migration using alcohol problems as an indicator. Rather than comparing immigrants and natives, we look at the native-born in a single country and compare those who have lived away for a period of their lives and those who have not. We use data from the first wave of the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) which is a large, nationally representative sample of older Irish adults. We find that men who lived away are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> alcohol problems than men who stayed. For women, we again see a higher incidence of alcohol problems for short-term migrants. However, long-term female migrants are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>suffered</b> <b>from</b> alcohol problems. migrants, psychic costs of migration, alcoholism...|$|R

On September 24, 2005, Hurricane Rita wreaked havoc on Louisiana’s coast by toppling trees over vast areas and by stripping away microhabitats that harbor the invertebrates and produce the fruits upon which migrant landbirds depend (e. g., canopy foliage, vine tangles, epiphytes, leaf litter, and thickets of perennial plant species).

40|$|Behaviour {{determines the}} rate at which {{invasive}} species spread, as well as the impact they have on natives. When behaviour varies between individuals (as it almost always does), then the mean behaviour is often less important than the extremes of behaviour. The rate at which a species spreads, for example, is governed primarily by the most extreme dispersers. Similarly, individuals of native species that are extreme in their behaviour may be more, or less, <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>suffer</b> impact <b>from</b> a given invasive species. Thus, we argue, an understanding of behavioural variation is critical if we are to understand the long-term impacts of invasive species in a changing world...|$|R

Past records of large fires indicate that roofs are most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>suffer</b> damage <b>from</b> leaping flames. The probable reason is that roof tiles fall off and wood portions that constitute a roof are exposed just after a large earthquake. Therefore, this study made an aerial photography analysis on roof tile falling after the Kobe earthquake, and also conducted Fire Wind Tunnel experiments to investigate leaping flame damage on roofs with roof tile deficit...|$|R
