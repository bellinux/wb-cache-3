5|$|Donna Freedman (also Brown) is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the Australian soap opera Neighbours, played by Margot Robbie. Believing she had performed badly in the audition, Robbie went on holiday to Canada. She then learned {{she had won}} the part and {{had to return to}} Australia to begin filming. She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 2 June 2008. Donna was initially introduced as a guest character, but Robbie was promoted to the regular cast shortly after she made her debut. In April 2010, it was revealed that Robbie had told producers she would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> when her contract expired {{at the end of the}} year. Five months later, it was announced that Robbie had quit Neighbours and she departed on 26 January 2011.|$|E
25|$|Many {{practicing}} mathematicians {{have been}} drawn to their subject because {{of a sense of}} beauty they perceive in it.

25|$|Ophélie, {{reading a}} book, is {{concerned}} at Hamlet's new indifference. Hamlet {{appears in the}} distance, but leaves without speaking. The Queen enters. Ophélie says she would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the court, but the Queen insists she should stay. Ophélie leaves the garden and King Claudius enters. Gertrude suspects that Hamlet now knows about {{the murder of his}} father, but Claudius says he does not. Hamlet enters and feigns madness. He rejects all overtures of friendship from Claudius, then announces he has engaged a troupe of actors to perform a play that evening. Claudius and Gertrude leave, and the players enter. Hamlet asks them to mime the play The Murder of Gonzago and then sings a drinking song, playing the fool, so as not to arouse suspicion.|$|E

Producers began negotiating with Robbie to renew her contract and a spokesperson said [...] "Margot isn't going anywhere for a long while yet. Producers love the character of Donna Freedman and there's plenty in store for her in the coming months, particularly in terms of her on-off romance with Ringo." ...|$|E

Years later an eyewitness, a local shepherd, was more florid in his description of the events: [...] "The people of the island were carried off in one mass, for ever, from the sea-girt spot where they were born and bred... The wild outcries of the men and heart-breaking wails of the women and children filled all the air between the mountainous shore of the bay" ...|$|E

He had {{previously}} contributed to records for Alicia Keys, B2K, Mariah Carey and Destiny's Child, but he felt 2004 introduced him to another landscape in the music industry. His contribution to this song elevated him to fame, and garnered more attention for his past work. [...] "Burn" [...] earned him two Grammy nominations. Cox said, [...] "Everybody who does this for a living, dreams about being nominated. It's the ultimate accomplishment. I've always been the silent guy — I come in, do my job and head out. I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> all the glory and shine to others, but this is the validation that means the most to me. It also makes me want to work harder to get that same recognition again." ...|$|E

In May 1941 Chilton was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO), which cited his [...] "conspicuous gallantry, coolness and initiative". During the Greek campaign, New Zealand General Bernard Freyberg praised Chilton as a fine man and Freyberg also praised Chilton for his calm attitude during the campaign.|$|R
500|$|In May 1970, Clancy {{was traded}} by the Dolphins to the Green Bay Packers for tight end Marv Fleming. [...] Clancy had begun a {{business}} selling {{real estate in}} Miami during the offseason, {{but he also had}} ties to Green Bay. [...] He had attended St. Matthew's Grade School there in the 1950s. [...] Clancy expressed mixed emotions about the trade: [...] "I don't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Miami. [...] You hate to have to pick up and move and I definitely plan to come back (to Miami) in the offseason. [...] But most of my dad's family are still up in Green Bay. [...] He's always wanted me to play for the Packers." [...] Clancy was greeted as the first Green Bay native to play for the Packers since Wayland Becker in 1938. [...] Wisconsin columnist Lee Remmel said Clancy [...] "surveys the football scene with a pair of cool, calculating blue eyes and a computer-type mind." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Farley, {{research}} suggests that very few prostitutes (she estimates that only 5% of women) make the choice freely. She says that most women in prostitution, including those working for escort services, have been sexually abused as children. Farley claims {{that a majority of}} prostitutes would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the industry. Bob Herbert echoed a similar opinion, also in the New York Times. Herbert says [...] "Those who think that most of the women in prostitution want to be there are deluded... the world of the prostitute is typically filled with pimps, sadists, psychopaths, drug addicts, violent criminals and disease." ...|$|E

2500|$|Edwards {{was hired}} as Vanderbilt University's head {{football}} coach and athletic director in 1949, replacing Henry Russell Sanders when Sanders left to become head coach at the University of California, Los Angeles. Vanderbilt gave the 43-year-old coach a three-year contract paying a $12,500 salary ($ in today's dollars). [...] "I don't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the Cleveland Browns and Paul Brown in particular," [...] {{he said at the}} time. [...] "I'll never forget my experiences with the Browns over the past two years." [...] Edwards remained at Vanderbilt for four seasons, building up a 21–19–2 record. He instituted a modern T formation offense to replace Sanders's more traditional single-wing formation. He resigned in 1953 under pressure from Vanderbilt alumni following a 3–5–2 season. He then moved to the University of North Carolina, where he was an assistant on the football team's coaching staff in 1953 and 1954.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{commemorative}} {{release was}} the 6 track single [...] "Say Your Dream" [...] on March 4, 2009. The title song is 13 minutes long and {{is reported to}} be a song about Glay's history. Takuro reported that he approached this song as the message he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> if he were to die, and that it took seven years to be completed. The promotional video was divided into two parts, the first of them started broadcasting on TV channels five days before the release of the single. The second part remains accessible [...] on internet only through a pass code obtained with the limited edition of the single. On the same premium site, there is a PV of the coupling song [...] "Haru made wa". The single finishes Glay's series of western song covers with [...] "The Meaning of Life" [...] by the band The Offspring.|$|E
2500|$|Harris and Klebold wrote {{much about}} how they would carry out the massacre, but less about why. A journal found in Harris's bedroom {{contained}} almost every detail that the boys planned to follow after 5:00a.m. on April 20, 1999. In journal entries, the pair often wrote about {{events such as the}} Oklahoma City bombing, the Waco Siege, the Vietnam War, and other similar events, including blurbs and notes on how they wished to [...] "outdo" [...] these events, focusing especially on what Timothy McVeigh did in Oklahoma City. They mentioned how they would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> a lasting impression on the world with this kind of violence. That the shooters initially planned and failed to blow up the high school, and not just shoot students, is an indication of how they had wished to overshadow the events that had occurred, respectively, four and six years earlier.|$|E
50|$|Like Ludwig Devrient, Krauss {{collapsed}} {{while performing}} King Lear and died on 20 October 1959, passing the ring to Josef Meinrad, his original choice in 1954. However, his widow later declared that Krauss would have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the ring <b>to</b> Alma Seidler, but was prevented {{from doing so}} {{by the fact that}} the ring could only be passed to a male. A female equivalent of the Iffland-Ring, the Alma-Seidler-Ring, was created upon Seidler’s death in 1977.|$|R

60|$|The other object, of re-invigorating Mr. Ponsonby, had {{not been}} attained.

He was so testy and exacting that Mary would have seldom <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> him <b>to</b> himself, {{even if she had}} been disposed to lead the life of a fish; and she was seldom away from him, unless Robson came down from Lima to transact business with him.|$|R
2500|$|Tennyson and {{his family}} were allowed to stay in the rectory for some time, but later moved to Beech Hill Park, High Beach, deep within Epping Forest, Essex, about 1837. Tennyson’s son recalled: “there was a pond in the park on which in winter my father might be seen skating, sailing about on the ice in his long blue cloak. [...] He liked the {{nearness}} of London, whether he resorted to see his friends, but he could not stay in town even for a night, his mother being in such a nervous state that he did not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> her..." [...] Tennyson befriended a Dr Allen, who ran a nearby asylum whose patients then included the poet John Clare. [...] An unwise investment in Dr Allen's ecclesiastical wood-carving enterprise soon led to the loss of much of the family fortune, and led to a bout of serious depression. Tennyson moved to London in 1840 and lived for a time at Chapel House, Twickenham.|$|E
2500|$|Ruby {{possesses}} a mysterious and presumably magical demon-killing knife, which Kripke {{refers to as}} [...] "a hand-to-hand version of the Colt". Its handle is made of elk antlers, and the knife has engravings {{on both sides of}} the blade, although the symbols are all nonsensical. It has been seen and used many times following its introduction in the third season. Upon being stabbed in a vital area, the demon is almost immediately killed, usually taking the human host with it. The only known survivor is Bobby Singer who stabbed himself with it while fighting off a possession and was left paralyzed as a result. It is unknown if it is effective against other supernatural beings, although it is useless against angels. Furthermore, the higher-ranked demons are resistant or even immune to the effects of the knife. Creator Eric Kripke doubted that how the knife functions would ever be revealed, stating, [...] "I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> some things mysterious. And that's likely to remain mysterious." [...] However, the eighth season reveals it to be [...] "an ancient demon-killing knife of the Kurds".|$|E
2500|$|Bloom {{then again}} portrayed Will Turner, in , {{released}} on 24 May 2007. Bloom, who {{had intended to}} become a stage actor {{after graduating from the}} Guildhall School of Music and Drama, had stated that he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> films for a time and instead appear in stage roles, and is [...] "avidly looking for the right sort of material that [...] can do something with" [...] and go [...] "back to basics." [...] During the summer of 2007 he appeared in a London revival of In Celebration, a play by David Storey. His character was one of three brothers returning home for their parents' 40th wedding anniversary. On 24 August 2007 he made his first ever TV commercial appearance on late-night Japanese TV, promoting the Uno brand of cosmetics maker Shiseido. A [...] "one night only", 2-minute version of the Sci-Fi themed commercial kicked off the product's marketing campaign. In 2008 he signed on to play a small role in the British film An Education but dropped out {{to take the lead in}} Johnnie To's film Red Circle. Also in 2009, he was one of many stars to appear in New York, I Love You, which contained 12 short films in one. He then appeared in The Three Musketeers opposite Milla Jovovich, Logan Lerman, Matthew Macfadyen, Ray Stevenson, Luke Evans, Juno Temple and Christoph Waltz, released in 2011.|$|E

2500|$|Rose {{described}} {{the writing process}} for the album as [...] "a more personal experience to him", and said that due to the events that transpired in the prior year, he would sometimes have trouble coming up with words, and would often write gibberish as a temporary filler. While Rose would be the primary writer, all {{five members of the}} band would contribute. Rose focused on more distressing themes, while Witherspoon, who had just become a father, focused his lyrics on responsibility and commitment. The album's first single, [...] "Unraveling", was co-written by Lowery and is about the collapse of a relationship, while [...] "Confession" [...] indirectly addresses Lowery quitting and returning to the band. On Lowery's return, Rose spoke [...] "Since we all write, it's hard to tell exactly what each song is about, but we <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> it up to the listeners to decide for themselves," [...] Rose says. [...] "It's funny because in the end you almost don't know what you wrote. I remember telling John one time, 'Dude, that was an amazing line you wrote,' and he went, 'What are you talking about? You wrote that.' We wanted to change the template completely from what we did with our last album, 'Hope And Sorrow'. We were going, 'Let's bring back those other elements Clint brought in that made us what we were.' So we sort of made a silent agreement {{that we were going to}} let Clint run wild.
