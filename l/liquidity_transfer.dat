40|$|Banks are {{liquidity}} brokers: they acquire it at {{the market}} in form of deposits and lend it in form of loans. As liquidity is not for free, the costs of its acquisition have {{to be transferred to}} those (departments) that lend it. Furthermore, banks take liquidity risk. The costs to hedge this risk have to be transferred to those that bring this risk into the bank. We propose a pricing framework that consistently prices both liquidity and liquidity risk in banks. The transfer prices are based on the cost that liquidity and liquidity risk imply (cost-based pricing) and linked to market variables to avoid discretionary biases. Using a representative balance sheet of a commercial bank, we demonstrate the application of our approach. Our approach ensures that banks incorporate liquidity cost (often neglected so far) in customer prices. Furthermore, they comply with the sound principles of liquidity management that explicitly require a <b>liquidity</b> <b>transfer</b> pricing.

40|$|The authors {{consider}} the liquidity efficiency of Tranche 2 of the Large Value Transfer System (LVTS T 2) by examining, through an empirical analysis, some plausible strategic reactions of individual participants to a systemwide shock to available liquidity in the system. The network {{structure of the}} LVTS T 2 {{is found to be}} asymmetric in terms of the patterns of out-payment flows. It is composed of three subgroups, in which participants within a subgroup are more strongly linked with each other than with participants in other subgroups. Three possible network equilibria are proposed. The equilibria are defined in terms of participant-specific collateral needs and out-payment delays, and result from different relative cost structures involving collateral costs, queuing costs, and payment delay penalties. Each of the conjectural equilibria relate to a dominant strategy for at least those participants most central in the network with respect to <b>liquidity</b> <b>transfer</b> adopted network-wide as a common strategy.

A regulator such as a Central Bank can ameliorate this inefficiency by standing to lend to affected banks at competitive rates.

40|$|This thesis proposes {{theoretical}} models to study bank risk-taking and financial stability. Three issues are explored: (1) the moral-hazard incentive for securitisation, (2) the socially optimal banking {{structure for the}} economy, and (3) the relationship between bank competition and financial stability, based on bank funding structures and fire-sale risks. Chapter 2 proposes a model to study how bank securitisation affects the value of bank equity, and hence what leads a bank to securitise its assets. The proposed model shows that moral hazard (which is induced by the deposit insurance scheme), can be one essential motive for the securitisation of deposit-taking commercial banks. This chapter also discusses some factors that can restrain the moral-hazard and risk-taking behaviour in bank securitisation. Chapter 3 investigates the social value of different banking structures. The proposed model finds that total separation is not the optimal banking structure for an economy, because it forbids the <b>liquidity</b> <b>transfer</b> between subsidiary banks, which is socially valuable. The comparison between ring-fencing and universal banking is more complicated; Chapter 3 shows that whether ring-fencing or universal banking is the best banking structure for an economy depends on the returns to the different subsidiary banking sectors. Chapter 4 studies how asset fire-sales risks and bank funding structures can affect the relationship between bank competition and financial stability. The proposed model finds that the funding-structure risks of the banks can create an incentive for excess risk-taking in a multi-bank economy. Moreover, the model shows that the excessive risk taking increases {{with the number of}} banks in the economy. This result is similar in spirit to the Cournot equilibrium in standard microeconomic theory. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{suggests}} an innovative {{contribution to the}} investigation of banking liabilities pricing contracted by sovereign agents. To address fundamental issues of banking, the study focuses on the determinants of the up-front fees (the up-front fee is a charge paid out at the signature of the loan arrangement). The investigation {{is based on a}} uniquely extensive sample of bank loans contracted or guaranteed by 58 less-developed countries sovereigns in the period from 1983 to 1997. The well detailed reports allow for the calculation of the equivalent yearly margin on the utilization period for all individual loan. The main findings suggest a significant impact of the renegotiation and agency costs on front-end borrowing payments. Unlike the sole interest spread, the all-in interest margin better takes account of these costs. The model estimates however suggest the non-linear pricing is hardly associated with an exogenous split-up intended by the borrower and his banker to cover up information. Instead the up-front payment is a <b>liquidity</b> <b>transfer</b> as described by Gorton and Kahn (2000) to compensate for renegotiation and monitoring costs. The second interesting result is that banks demand payment for all types of sovereign risk in an identical manner public debt holders do. The difference is that, unlike bond holders, bankers have the possibility to charge an up-front fee to compensate for renegotiation costs. Hence, beyond the information related issues, the higher complexity of the pricing design makes bank loan optimal for lenders on sovereign capital markets, especially relative to public debt, thus motivating for their presence. The paper contributes to the expanding literature on loan syndication and banking related issues. The study also has relevance for the investigation of the developing countries debt pricing.

40|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{financial}} crisis, one of the biggest failures observed in the financial system refers to the poor evaluation of the exposure to liquidity risk as well as to its pricing. The ideal funding environment preceding the turmoil (where liquidity was plentiful and cheap) led many banks to overlook liquidity and funding implications of deals, thereby encouraging an increase in leverage as well as an excessive maturity transformation to make record profits. In hindsight liquidity revealed itself as a scarce, expensive and strategic resource that requires to be effectively allocated and managed and its cost charged to different business units, products and counterparties accordingly. According to the extraordinarly changes registered in the financial landscape, marked by more and more competitive markets where funding is available only for shorter periods and at a higher price, liquidity pricing frameworks in banks became an essential tool to measure the risk-adjusted profitability at a more granular level while addressing the impact of liquidity risk and other ALM risks on a financial firms’ balance sheet structure, segregating them from operations. Failures to adequately apply <b>liquidity</b> <b>transfer</b> pricing processes, both on- and off- balance sheet, generated risks, due to the misalignment of the risk-taking incentives at individual level and consolidated one, leading to a wrong allocation of capital resource within the business units. However, the growing importance of liquidity pricing largely derives not only from market events. More recently, worldwide regulators have been increasingly focused on pricing liquidity. The regulatory initiatives will pose challenges for banks to overhaul their existing funds transfer pricing (FTP) frameworks and to incorporate formally liquidity risks. As a result banks, especially the largest, cross-border and more sophisticated ones, are revising and reshaping their approaches to meet regulatory expectations as well as {{to take into account the}} multi-dimensionality of liquidity risk as well as its interconnections with the organizational structure, the balance-sheet items, etc. This process is underway and still not completed. In such a perspective, after an introduction on the theoretical frameworks for FTP, the paper reviews some of the methodologies for pricing liquidity, implemented by cross-border banking institutions, pointing out their intrinsic weaknesses. In the light of empirical evidences that covers the period starting just before the crisis to nowadays, we analyze the evolution of the main different FTP components showing the most significant results from a macro and a micro-perspective as well. Some potential areas of improvements and challenges will be highlighted. Finally, we describe a few benefits achievable through the adoption of a FTP approach...|$|E
40|$|The {{increased}} {{fragility of}} the banking industry has generated growing concern about {{the risks associated with}} payment systems. Although in most industrial countries different interbank payment systems coexist, little is really known about their properties in terms of risk and efficiency. How should payment systems be designed? We tackle this question by comparing the two main types of payment systems, gross and net, in a framework where uncertainty arises from several sources: the time of consumption, the location of consumption, and the return on investment. Payments across locations can be made either by directly <b>transferring</b> <b>liquidity</b> or by <b>transferring</b> claims against the bank in the other location. The two mechanisms are interpreted as the gross and net settlement systems in interbank payments.

He also describes the series of bold initiatives that were undertaken in the 1990 s with regard to simplifying clearing and settlement procedures, reducing reserve requirements, and setting the Bank's target for the overnight rate. Chant suggests that these changes have improved market efficiency, reduced risk and uncertainty, and strengthened the Bank's influence over its short-term operating target. ...|$|R

40|$|In the Canadian large value {{payment system}} an {{important}} goal is to understand how <b>liquidity</b> is <b>transferred</b> through the system and hence how efficient the system is in settling payments. Understanding {{the structure of the}} underlying network of relationships between participants in the payment system is a crucial step in achieving the goal. The set of nodes in any given network can be partitioned into a number of groups (or "communities"). Usually, the partition is not directly observable and must be inferred from the observed data of interaction flows between all nodes. In this paper we use the statistical model of Copic, Jackson, and Kirman (2007) to estimate the most likely partition in the network of business relationships in the LVTS. Specifically, we estimate from the LVTS transactions data different "communities" formed by the direct participants in the system. Using various measures of transaction intensity, we uncover communities of participants that are based on both transaction amount and their physical locations. More importantly these communities were not easily discernible in previous studies of LVTS data since previous studies did {{not take into account the}} network (or transitive) aspects of the data.

He lent him money for his extravagant lifestyle and financed his journey to Paris in 1810 to attend the wedding of Napoleon and Marie Louise.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} recent bank runs {{in seven}} transition economies (Russia, Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania), comparing {{them against the}} older US experience and theoretical research. Bank runs seem to usually be information based. For example, improvements in bank transparency such as new accounting rules can reveal a bank’s insolvency and trigger a run. However, bank runs, as seen {{a few years ago}} in East Asia, Bulgaria and Russia, may also be accompanied by runs on national currencies. We include a bank run model that shows a bank may issue liquid demand deposits and avoid runs without deposit insurance as long as it also issues less liquid time deposits. Self-fulfilling runs are prevented through elimination of the maturity mismatch. The well-known Diamond & Dybvig (1983) model is modified to account for depositors’ risk affinities, whereby high-risk depositors hold their savings as demand deposits and low-risk depositors prefer time deposits. These deposit choices <b>transfer</b> <b>liquidity</b> optimally from low-risk to high-risk depositors who value liquidity. By exploiting these choices, a bank can improve its intertemporal risk-sharing by issuing deposits of varying degrees of liquidity.

40|$|The {{positive}} {{contribution of}} finance {{to the process}} of economic development has been debated ever since Joseph Schumpeter famously argued in 1911 that services provided by finance are essential for technological innovation and growth. A substantial theoretical literature has produced increasingly sophisticated economic models endogenising the role of finance into the growth process, while empirical studies have put forward data to detect the link between the two. Yet {{a large part of the}} empirical surveys operate with macroeconomic or cross-section data and have little to say about the channels through which finance affects growth. This is where this dissertation comes in. It provides firm-level data from Bulgaria and Yugoslavia from the period 1919 - 1941 to tackle a number of questions related to finance, banking, and economic performance of the European economic periphery. The analysis is broadly divided into three parts – capital flows and the effects of international investment on domestic firms, banks and the real sector during the Great Depression, and the political economy of government intervention during the Depression and post-Depression period. The first substantive chapter (chapter 2) contributes to the literature on growth and capital flows by testing the hypothesis that foreign direct investment brings about productivity improvements to host economies via the channels of technology, <b>liquidity</b> and know-how <b>transfer,</b> as opposed to market access or increased competition. Chapter 3 revisits the prominent debate over the origins of the banking crises during the Great Depression and the effects these had on the real sectors. Evidence is provided in support of the debt deflation theory of banking crises, but the broad effects of the Depression on banks’ and firms’ balance is also explored. The higher the involvement of banks with industry both directly (via interlocking directorates or equity ownership), and indirectly, via the lending channel, the greater the negative effects of the crisis on banks’ balance sheets. The evidence points to negative feedbacks from bank distress to firms’ output losses in the form of a credit crunch. Chapter 4 uses a political economy framework to analyse the state interventions in the Balkan economies during and after the Depression. The data suggests that direct and indirect bailouts of banking and industry defined the role of the state. Government cronies from the financial and economic elite, as well as the agricultural sector ended up as winners from the process, while semi-skilled and unskilled labour paid the tax bill. These quantitative findings are in agreement with the broad conclusions of transaction cost economics where finance can play an important sorting role. They also support the empirical literature that rejects the contributions of portfolio investment but argues that direct foreign investment is a source of technological progress. The conclusions of the thesis, however, call for caution as market failure in the financial sector was abundant and political economy frictions could cause lasting damage to development.
