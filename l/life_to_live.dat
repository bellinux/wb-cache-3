5|$|To {{further the}} mystery element and add an {{international}} {{twist to the}} story, Nixon scripted Dimitri as having close European roots, though he is an American. He {{is the son of}} Hungarian parents, Hugo and Anna. Originally, his wealth comes from all the land around Pine Valley and the One <b>Life</b> <b>to</b> <b>Live</b> city Llanview, which he inherits from his parents. That is also where his fictional estate, Wildwind, is located. Later, during Dimitri's 1992 story with Erica Kane, he is revealed to also be Hungarian nobility as Count Andrassy. He inherited his title and his Hungarian castle, Vadzel, from his father's side. Both of his parents were dead by the time Dimitri first appears on All My Children. He spends his childhood years growing up in Europe and on the Wildwind estate. He has a complicated relationship with Edmund Gresham, the son of two of his family's employees, unknown to Dimitri to be his half-brother. His childhood sweetheart was Angelique Voynitzeva, the daughter of his nanny, Helga. Helga later becomes his housekeeper. Fifteen years prior to Dimitri's appearance on-screen, he and Angelique married. Angelique becomes pregnant but suffers a miscarriage which devastates both of them. Angelique has a riding accident which leaves her in a coma. Dimitri tries to find a cure, but is unable to and sends her to a clinic in Austria. He becomes reclusive for the next decade because of the guilt he feels over her condition. Finding Natalie in 1991 brings him out into society again.|$|E
25|$|General Hospital rose {{rapidly to}} the top spot in the Nielsen ratings by 1979. As for One <b>Life</b> <b>to</b> <b>Live,</b> from its tenth {{birthday}} onward, its competitors declined in popularity. Search for Tomorrow, for instance, spent its last several months on CBS against {{the last half of}} One <b>Life</b> <b>to</b> <b>Live.</b> Its replacement, Capitol, did little better, and after its cancellation, CBS aligned As the World Turns against One <b>Life</b> <b>to</b> <b>Live</b> and Another World, a configuration that stayed in place until Another Worlds cancellation in 1999. The 1980s saw One <b>Life</b> <b>to</b> <b>Live</b> reach the height of its popularity, with an estimate of 9 million viewers early in the decade. The show typically ranked between the second and the fourth position in the 1980s.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the show's history, {{the plot}} lines of One <b>Life</b> <b>to</b> <b>Live</b> have been {{established}} as existing in the same fictional universe as other ABC-owned daytime series, in particular Agnes Nixon's All My Children, which premiered in 1970. As noted {{from time to time}} in both series, fictional Pine Valley—the setting of All My Children—is located in Pennsylvania near One <b>Life</b> <b>to</b> <b>Live</b> Llanview. Over the years, many characters have crossed over from one series to another in both short appearances and extended runs. As early as 1968, General Hospital Dr. Steve Hardy appeared in Llanview to consult on Meredith Lord Wolek's blood disease as a means to lead General Hospital viewers to the new series; similarly, One <b>Life</b> <b>to</b> <b>Live</b> Dr. Larry Wolek visited All My Children shortly after its premiere in 1970.|$|E
