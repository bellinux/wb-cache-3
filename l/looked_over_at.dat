500|$|The {{incident}} was widely reported and condemned by the Soviet press. Kharlamov himself believed that [...] "Bobby Clarke {{was given the}} job of taking {{me out of the}} game." [...] The slash was apparently done at the instigation of assistant coach John Ferguson. [...] "I remember that Kharlamov's ankle was hurting pretty bad. I called Clarke over to the bench, <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> Kharlamov and said, 'I think he needs a tap on the ankle.' I didn't think twice about it. It was Us versus Them. And Kharlamov was killing us. I mean, somebody had to do it." [...] Canadian journalist Dick Beddoes asked Clarke about it later at a team reunion, calling it a [...] "wicked two-hander", to which Clarke replied [...] "Dick, if I hadn't learned how to lay on a two-hander once in a while, I'd never have left Flin Flon." ...|$|E

Ivan L. Moody, the band's lead singer, stopped the show, leaped into the crowd with Zoltan Bathory, the band's rhythm guitarist, and carried the injured fan onto the stage, where {{he was taken to}} the hospital. Moody has been quoted as saying: [...] "I looked him square in the face and asked him if he was okay, or if there was anything I could do for him. He <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> me, still in shock, and said 'You guys fucking rock!'" ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the sixth}} {{game of the}} series, Bobby Clarke slashed Kharlamov intentionally, {{fracturing}} a bone in his ankle. He would miss the seventh game of the series, {{and returned to the}} lineup for the final game of the series, but at much reduced effectiveness. At the time, many felt the slash was intentional. Assistant coach John Ferguson would later say [...] "I called (Bobby) Clarke over to the bench, <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> Kharlamov and said, 'I think he needs a tap on the ankle'." [...] As for Kharlamov himself, he had little doubt that an attempt had been made to limit his effectiveness, [...] "I'm convinced that Bobby Clarke was given the job of taking me out of the game." [...] Kharlamov's injury, and his diminished play in the aftermath have been regarded as a turning point for the series in Canada's favour, who won the series in the eighth and final game.|$|E
2500|$|When {{he ran for}} {{governor}} in 2002, Romney strongly advocated stem-cell research, and he promised to lobby then-President George W. Bush to embrace it. During Romney's 2008 presidential campaign, he renounced his prior position {{and said that he}} agreed with Bush's decision to ban federal funding for research on excess embryos. He said that his views had been drastically altered in 2004 after discussing stem cell research with Douglas Melton, a stem cell researcher at Harvard University. The Harvard Stem Cell Institute was planning research that would have involved therapeutic cloning. [...] According to Romney, Melton declared that the research [...] "is not a moral issue because we kill the embryos at 14 days." [...] "I <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> Beth Myers, my chief of staff, and we both had exactly the same reaction, which is it just hit us hard," [...] recalled Romney. [...] "And as they walked out, I said, 'Beth, we have cheapened the sanctity of life by virtue of the Roe v. Wade mentality.'" ...|$|E

And from that point forward, I said to the people of Massachusetts, 'I will continue to honor what I pledged to you, but I prefer to call myself pro-life.'" [...] Melton disputes Romney's account of the meeting, declaring [...] "Governor Romney has mischaracterized my position; we didn't discuss killing or anything related to it ...

2500|$|Clarke's line {{played against}} {{the line of}} the Soviets' top player, Valeri Kharlamov, during the entire series. After being on the {{receiving}} end of some stick work from Kharlamov while going for the puck, Clarke caught up with Kharlamov and laid a two-handed slash across his ankle, breaking it in the process. Though Kharlamov finished the game, he missed the seventh game and was largely ineffective in the eighth. When asked about the slash years later, Clarke said, [...] "If I hadn't learned to lay on a two-hander once in a while, I'd never have left Flin Flon." [...] 30 years after the series, Henderson criticized Clarke, calling the slash, [...] "the low point of the series." [...] Clarke responded saying that he thought it was [...] "improper to criticize a teammate thirty years later," [...] and that he did not [...] "understand why he would bring it up now." [...] Henderson has since retracted his criticism. Kharlamov, prior to his death in 1981, said he thought Clarke was tasked with [...] "taking me out of the game." [...] John Ferguson, Sr., an assistant coach with Team Canada in 1972, said, [...] "I called Clarke over to the bench, <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> Kharlamov and said, 'I think he needs a tap on the ankle.' I didn't think twice about it. It was Us versus Them. And Kharlamov was killing us. I mean, somebody had to do it. And I sure wasn't going to ask Henderson."
