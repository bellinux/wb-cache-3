Because of EPL, firms engage themselves in <b>labour</b> <b>hoarding</b> practices, which lead them to employ a lower quantity of workers during upswings, while keeping inefficient levels of employment in downturns. For a given level of wages, this loss of productive efficiency would result in lower average profits. On the other hand, if firmsoperated {{in a context of}} efficiency wages, by inducing more stable relationships with the workers and reducing their job and income insecurity, EPL could allow them to pay lower wages, without reducing the effort provided by the labour force employed, with beneficial effects on profits.|$|E
40|$|<b>Labour</b> <b>hoarding</b> {{ensures that}} {{unemployment}} remains disguised or mostly disguised in socialist economies. <b>Labour</b> <b>hoarding</b> was {{prevalent in the}} 1960 s after the absorption of post-capitalist labour reserves. The pattern was similar in almost all East European Central Planned Economies (CPEs), but the nature of <b>labour</b> <b>hoarding</b> was different from market economies, where it is usually confined to smoothing adjustments over the business cycle. The paper contains an estimate of <b>labour</b> <b>hoarding</b> in Polish industry based on a Cobb-Douglas production function of the type employed earlier by Denison. A part of the residual factor of labour productivity growth that reflects underutilization of labour is used to derive estimates for <b>labour</b> <b>hoarding.</b> The results show a huge increase in <b>labour</b> <b>hoarding</b> (disguised unemployment rate) in Polish industry from less than 5 per cent of the labour force in the late 1960 s {{up to more than}} 25 per cent in the late 1980 s. The main conclusion is {{that as a result of}} western-type stabilization programmes, future open unemployment in Poland (and probably in other former CPEs) could be much bigger than government expectations unless various institutional changes supporting new openings and structural changes are initiated. The study also shows that a shifting out of the Beveridge curve (a typical phenomenon in market economics lately) can be observed in the Polish economy if the disguised unemployment rate is taken into account...|$|E

40|$|During the Soviet era, {{directors}} and workers derived mutual benefits from concealing true capacity, <b>hoarding</b> <b>labour</b> and just fulfilling an enterprise's plan. In {{an environment of}} labour shortages and guaranteed markets, managers used informal mechanisms to reward and retain good workers given the absence of unemployment and meaningful wage differentials as mechanisms to discipline workers. This cultivated a paternalistic set of relations between enterprise managers and workers that, it is argued, are being hollowed out in the post-communist era.

5000|$|Under {{conditions}} of [...] "taut planning", {{the economy was}} expected to produce a volume of output higher than the reported capacity of enterprises {{and there was no}} [...] "slack" [...] in the system. Enterprises faced a resource constraint and <b>hoarded</b> <b>labour</b> and other inputs and avoided sub-contracting intermediate production activities, preferring to retain the work in-house. The enterprise, according to the theory promulgated by János Kornai, was constrained by its resources not by the demand for its goods and services; nor was it constrained by its finances since the government was not likely to shut it down if it failed to meet its financial targets. Enterprises in socialist planned economies operated within a [...] "soft" [...] budget constraint, unlike enterprises in capitalist market economies which are demand-constrained and operate within [...] "hard" [...] budget constraints, as they face bankruptcy if their costs exceed their sales. As all producers were working in a resource-constrained economy they were perpetually in short supply and the shortages could never be eliminated, leading to chronic disruption of production schedules. The effect of this was to preserve a high level of employment.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} series are derived for capital utilisation, labour effort and total factor {{productivity}} (TFP) from a general equilibrium model with variable factor utilisation and labour adjustment costs. Impulse responses from the model show that firms initially respond to unanticipated shocks by altering factor utilisation rates. In subsequent periods, firms adjust observable inputs such as physical capital and employment. As a result, utilisation rates are a leading indicator of firms hiring of both capital and labour. The estimate of capital utilisation is found to track survey-based measures quite closely, while movements in total hours worked drive the labour effort series. The estimate of TFP growth {{is found to be}} less cyclical than the rate of growth of a traditional Solow residual. Nevertheless, a weighted average of capital utilisation and labour effort - aggregate factor utilisation - is not closely related to the detrended Solow residual. This suggests that measures that conflate capacity utilisation and temporary deviations in TFP from its steady-state growth rate may be misleading indicators of excess demand pressure. Rather, the measure of aggregate factor utilisation is correlated with detrended labour productivity, providing more evidence that differences in average and marginal labour productivity may be linked to factor <b>hoarding.</b> <b>Labour</b> productivity, when calculated as output per unit of effective labour input, is less cyclical than a simple measure of output per hour. ...|$|R

40|$|The 2008 Great Recession was notable in the UK {{for three}} things: {{the enormity of}} the output shock; the muted {{unemployment}} response; and the very slow rate of recovery. We review the literature which finds most of the decline in productivity is within sector and within firm before presenting new micro-analysis of workplace-level behaviour between 2004 and 2011 to gain insights into the processes that may have contributed to this aggregate picture. We find clear evidence of labour intensification but employers appeared incapable of turning this effort into improved workplace level productivity. Widespread pay freezes and cuts were often initiated in direct response to the recession. Workplace closure rates were little different to those experienced prior to the recession, but there is some evidence of a "cleansing" effect with poorer performing workplaces being more likely to close. There is some evidence of <b>labour</b> "hoarding", especially <b>hoarding</b> of high skilled labour: this has had no discernible impact on the rate of innovation. There is no impact of recession on either the number of HRM practices workplaces invested in, nor their returns on those investments.

40|$|The {{classical}} {{treatment of}} market transactions in economics presumes that {{buyers and sellers}} engage in transactions instantly and at no cost. In a series of applications in the housing market, the labour market and the market for corporate bonds, this thesis shows that relaxing this assumption {{has important implications for}} Macroeconomics and Finance. The first chapter combines theory and empirical evidence to show that search frictions in the housing market imply a housing liquidity channel of monetary policy transmission. Expansionary monetary policy attracts buyers to the housing market, raising housing liquidity. Higher housing sale rates in turn allow lenders to threaten foreclosure more effectively, because the expected carrying costs on foreclosure inventory are lower. Ex-ante, this makes banks willing to offer larger loans, stimulating aggregate demand. The second chapter uses a heterogeneous firm industry model to explore how the macroeconomic response to a temporary employer payroll tax cut depends on the hiring and firing costs faced by firms. Controversially, the presence of non-convex labour adjustment costs suggests that tax cuts create fewer jobs in recessions. When firms <b>hoard</b> <b>labour</b> during downturns, they do not respond to marginal tax cuts by hiring additional workers. The third chapter develops a theory in which trader career concerns generate an endogenous transaction friction. Traders are reluctant to sell assets below historical purchase price, since realizing a loss signals to the employer that the trader is incompetent. The chapter documents empirically several properties of corporate bond transaction data consistent with this theory of career-concerned traders...|$|R
40|$|Using panel data {{pertaining}} to large Polish (non-financial) firms this paper examines {{the determinants of}} employment change during the period 1996 - 2002. Paying {{particular attention to the}} asymmetry hypothesis we investigate the impact of own wages, outside wages, output growth, regional characteristics and sectoral affiliation on the evolution of employment. In keeping with the ‘right to manage ’ model we find that employment dynamics are not affected negatively by alternative wages. Furthermore, in contrast to the early transition period, we find evidence that employment levels respond to positive sales growth (in all but state firms). The early literature, (e. g. Kőllő, 1998) found that <b>labour</b> <b>hoarding</b> lowered employment elasticities in the presence of positive demand shocks. Our findings suggest that inherited <b>labour</b> <b>hoarding</b> may no longer be a factor. We argue that the present pattern of employment adjustment is better explained by the role of insiders. This tentative conclusion is hinged on the contrasting behaviour of state and privatised companies and the similar behaviour of privatised and new private companies.

More specifically, the consequences are investigated {{with regard to the}} adaptation of volume of labour and labour costs, and also the composition of employment. The analysis for Belgium shows that the crisis was accompanied by a less than proportional contraction in the volume of labour, resulting in a fall in labour productivity. The reduction in the volume of labour was only partly reflected in the trend in employment as the use of measures aimed at limiting working time, with a considerable fall in the number of hours worked per employee as a result, was accompanied by considerable <b>labour</b> <b>hoarding.</b> In general terms, the crisis did not result in a fall in the activity rate, but there is a major risk of discouragement among low-skilled young people. The increase in long-term unemployment points in turn to the threat of a rise in structural unemployment, which may adversely affect the potential for growth in the economy. The crisis did not have a moderating effect on the trend in hourly labour costs. After allowing for the productivity trend, the labour cost handicap, expressed in unit labour costs, narrowed temporarily with respect to the three neighbouring countries, but an increase in this handicap was once again posted in 2010. <b>labour</b> <b>hoarding,</b> long-term unemployment, labour productivity, labour cost handicap, hysteresis...|$|E
