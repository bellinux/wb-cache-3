40|$|A usual {{approach}} for proving {{the existence of}} an optimal transport map, be it in ℝd or on more general manifolds, involves a regularity condition on the transport cost (the so-called <b>Left</b> <b>Twist</b> condition, i. e. the invertibility of the gradient in the first variable) as well as the fact that any optimal transport plan is supported on a cyclically-monotone set. Under the classical assumption that the initial measure does not give mass to sets with σ-finite d− 1 measure and a stronger regularity condition on the cost (the Strong <b>Left</b> <b>Twist),</b> we provide a short and self-contained proof of the fact that any feasible transport plan (optimal or not) satisfying a c-monotonicity assumption is induced by a transport map. We also show that the usual costs induced by Tonelli Lagrangians satisfy the Strong <b>Left</b> <b>Twist</b> condition we propose...|$|E

40|$|Background : A right-sided {{umbilical}} cord twist {{is associated with}} the presence of a single umbilical artery, congenital malformations and placenta praevia.   Methods:  It was an observational study. Data was collected from 137 {{umbilical cord}}s, all from live births and their patient records. The gestational ages ranged from 28 weeks to 41 weeks. The umbilical cords were categorized into right or left, based on the direction of twist. The independent sample T test and the Chi square test were used to analyze the differences between groups.   Results:  The prevalence of <b>left</b> <b>twist</b> was 84 %. Right twist was significantly associated with a larger Hyrtl’s anastomosis (p= 0. 029) and gestational diabetes (p= 0. 027).   Conclusion: Two previously unreported associations with right twist of the umbilical cord, gestational diabetes and an increase in the diameter of Hyrtl’s anastomosis, were noted in the present study. </p...|$|E
40|$|Any {{orientation}} preserving self diffeomorphism of S 1 × S 2 {{is either}} isotopic to identity {{or to the}} map ϕ: S 2 × S 1 → S 2 × S 1 defined by ϕ(x, y) = (α(y) x, y), where α ∈ π 1 (SO(3)) ∼ = Z/ 2 Z is the generator (e. g. [6] p. 232). For any smooth 4 -manifold X, and an imbedded 2 -sphere in S ⊂ X with a trivial normal bundle, the operation of removing the regular neighborhood ν(S) ∼ = S 2 ×D 2 of S from X and then regluing it via the nontrivial diffeomorphism: X ↦ → XS = (X − ν(S)) ⌣ϕ (S 2 × D 2) is called the Gluck twisting of X along S. This operation was introduced in [5]. 2.

40|$|ObjectiveWe {{performed}} echocardiographic tissue tracking {{to investigate}} whether mitral valve repair preserves left ventricular function. MethodsWe studied 16 subjects without heart disease (11 male; mean age, 54. 6  ± 15. 1 years) and 18 patients in normal sinus rhythm undergoing solitary mitral valve repair (12 male; mean age, 53. 6  ± 16. 6 years). Transthoracic echocardiography was performed before and after surgery, and left ventricular apical and basal short-axis images were recorded. Left ventricular rotation angle was measured with off-line Vector Velocity Imaging (Siemens Medical Solutions USA Inc, Mountain View, Calif) at each slice level. ResultsLeft ventricular ejection fraction was significantly higher in the control (68. 4 % ± 3. 6 %) and preoperative groups (70. 9 % ± 6. 5 %) than the postoperative group (59. 4 % ± 11. 4 %, P < . 05). Left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes were significantly greater in the preoperative group {{than the control group}} (130. 0  ± 41. 5 mL and 41. 6  ± 16. 6 mL vs 80. 0  ± 16. 7 mL and 26. 6  ± 9. 2 mL, respectively, P < . 05). Left ventricular end-diastolic volume normalized postoperatively. <b>Left</b> ventricular <b>twist</b> was significantly greater in the preoperative group than the other groups (11. 7 ° ± 4. 1 ° versus 7. 1 ° ± 3. 8 ° and 8. 2 ° ± 5. 7 °, P < . 05). <b>Left</b> ventricular <b>twist</b> did not differ significantly between control and postoperative groups. New York Heart Association functional class improved from 1. 6  ± 0. 5 to 1. 0  ± 0. 0 after surgery (P < . 05). ConclusionsAlthough preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction seemed normal, <b>left</b> ventricular <b>twist</b> was greater. <b>Left</b> ventricular <b>twist</b> normalized after surgery, suggesting that it preserves left ventricular function...|$|R

40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{structure of}} a genetically engineered variant of porcine growth hormone, methionyl porcine somatotropin (MPS), has been determined at 2. 8 -A resolution, using single crystal x-ray diffraction techniques. Phases were obtained by use of a single isomorphous K 2 OsCl 6 derivative and were improved by use of the density modification procedure. The MPS structure is predominantly helical. It consists mainly of four antiparallel alpha-helices arranged in a <b>left</b> <b>twisted</b> helical bundle, a structural motif observed {{in a number of}} other unrelated proteins. However, the way the four helices are connected in the bundle is unusual and, to our knowledge, has never been reported before. Alignment of the amino acid sequence of MPS with that of other growth hormones reveals that residues within the alpha-helices are predominantly invariant and thus these invariant residues are necessary to maintain the structural integrity of these proteins...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Isolated twisted {{fallopian tube}} is an {{uncommon}} event, isolated twisted fallopian tube in pregnancy {{is also very}} rare. The diagnosis is often difficult and established during the operation. The right fallopian tube is most common affected. Case presentation We report an uncommon <b>twisted</b> <b>left</b> fallopian tube in pregnancy. A 34 -year-old G 3 P 2 28 weeks pregnant woman presented with acute left lower abdominal pain. The clinical and ultrasonographic findings led to diagnosis of <b>twisted</b> <b>left</b> ovarian cyst. Emergency exploratory laparotomy was performed. A <b>twisted</b> <b>left</b> fallopian tube and paratubal cyst was noted and left salpingectomy was performed. The postoperative course was uneventful and the pregnancy continued until term without complication. Conclusions Although isolated twisted fallopian tube during pregnancy is very rare, it {{should be included in}} the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen in pregnancy. Early surgical intervention will decrease obstetric morbidity and may allow preservation of the fallopian tube. </p...|$|R
50|$|The {{preferred}} {{method of}} wrestling the steer {{to the ground}} is to lean from the galloping horse which is running beside the steer, transferring {{the weight of the}} upper body to the neck of the steer, with one hand on the near horn of the steer and the far horn grasped in the crook of the other elbow. One then lets the horse carry his feet by the steer until his feet naturally fall out of the stirrups. The steer wrestler then slides with his feet turned slightly to the <b>left,</b> <b>twisting</b> the head of the steer toward one by pushing down with the near hand and pulling up and in with the far elbow. Finally the steer wrestler lets go of the near horn, and puts the steer's nose in the crook of his left elbow, and throws his weight backwards causing the steer to become unbalanced and fall to the ground.|$|R

50|$|After {{extensive}} research, Aphalara itadori {{has been}} shown to defoliate knotweed species substantially. The psyllid individuals feed on the knotweed's meristem. As a result of this feeding the leaves are <b>left</b> <b>twisted</b> and bound together. The deformity caused by Aphalara itadori feeding reduces the photosynthetic rate, competitive ability, growth, and total leaf area. They deplete the energy supply of knotweed reducing the growth and root storage. This damage prevents the knotweed from growing back. Studies have indicated that A.itadori release would result in extensive Fallopia spp. defoliation on above and below-ground biomass. Grevstad et al., 2013, showed more than a 50% reduction in biomass after 50 days on F. sachalinensis and F. x bohemica. However, A release would not be entirely risk free. Some individuals of A. itadori displayed characteristics of an ability to adapt and grow on non-target plants. However, the fitness level of these individuals was near zero and may result in behavioral avoidance instead. Knotweed poses a much larger risk to environments than the potential threats of Aphalara itadori and should not rule out the potential benefits the psyllid has shown to have on reducing knotweed biomass, and the overall success of invasions.|$|R
