25|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, {{many new}} {{universities}} were opened in Britain, while car ownership was relatively low, especially among young people. Furthermore, internal flights {{were not as}} cheap or prevalent as they are now. Most students either hitched or took a <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> <b>coach.</b> The National Union of Students had a very large travel company at the time with charter flights all over the world. They wanted to expand their operations domestically and so went to various regional sales managers of British Railways to develop special fares for holders of NUS cards. These were usually an allocated number of seats on specified weekend trains but they were very successful and Paul Connellan, who was the Travel Company General Manager, went to the British Railways Board with a proposal to allow a general discount based on the NUS card. The railways management, led by Alan Chamberlain, were reluctant to offer a discount based just on such cards particularly as some colleges and universities were not members of the NUS. A compromise was agreed where a special card would be sold but only through student travel offices.|$|E
