40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{inflation}} linked breakeven inflation, defined as the difference between a nominal yield and an inflation linked yield, sometimes is used as an approximation of the market’s inflation expectation. D’Amico et al. (2009, [5]) show that this is a poor approximation for the US market. Based on their work, this thesis shows that the approximation also is poor for the Swedish bond market. This is done by modelling the Swedish bond market using a five-factor latent variable model, where an inflation <b>linked</b> <b>bond</b> specific premium is introduced. Latent variables and parameters are estimated using a Kalman filter and a maximum likelihood estimation. The conclusion is drawn that the modelling was successful and that the model implied outputs gave plausible results...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{communicate}} two results. First, we construct an example {{in which a}} firm strictly prefers to issue a bond linked {{to the price of}} a commodity as opposed to a fixed rate bond. The firm with a fixed rate bond chooses a suboptimal investment policy because the outstanding nominal obligation distorts the incentives of the equity owners. The commodity <b>linked</b> <b>bond</b> resolves this moral hazard problem. Second, we show that in the presence of moral hazard problems the traditional application of contingent claims valuation techniques leads to an incorrect valuation of the the real assets and consequently to an incorrect valuation of the financial liabilities written against those assets.

40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} risk of inflation and diminishing pension benefits, insurance companies have started selling in°ation-linked products. Selling such products the insurance company takes over {{some or all of}} the inflation risk from their customers. On the other side financial derivatives which are linked to inflation such as inflation linked bonds are traded on financial markets and appear to be of increasing popularity. The insurance company can use these products to hedge its own inflation risk. In this article we study how to optimally manage a pension fund taking positions in a money market account, a stock and an inflation <b>linked</b> <b>bond,</b> while financing investments through a continuous stochastic income stream such as the plan member's contributions. We use the martingale method in order to compute an analytic expression for the optimal strategy and express it in terms of observable market variables. ...|$|E

40|$|Inflation {{expectations}} {{are a key}} economic variable for investors in capital markets and for economic policy decision makers. One of the widely used sources for deriving inflation {{expectations are}} market prices of bonds. The yield differential between nominal bonds and inflation-indexed (linked) bonds is taken to be an estimate of expected inflation. The problem is however that in a risk averse world the yield differential includes an inflation risk premium and thus the yield differential provides an upward bias of inflation expectations. The novelty of our paper is that we estimate this risk premium using volatility implied in options prices. In {{the absence of a}} market in options on inflation we use prices of foreign currency options to estimate this risk premium. The theoretical foundation of our methodology is purchasing power parity theory. The Israeli financial market has both, an inflation linked and non <b>linked</b> <b>bond</b> market and an active FX options market. Using data from both markets we find a statistically and economically significant inflation risk premium. ...|$|E
40|$|The risk of {{inflation}} is looming {{under the current}} low interest rate environment. Assuming that the investment includes a fixed interest asset and n risky assets under inflation, we consider two scenarios: inflation rate can be observed directly or through a noisy observation. Since the inflation rate is random, all assets become risky. Under this circumstance, we formulate the portfolio selection problem and derive the efficient frontier by solving the associated HJB equation. We find that for a given expected portfolio return, investment at time t is linearly proportional to the price index level. Moreover, the risk for {{the real value of}} the portfolio is no longer minimal when all the wealth is put into the fixed interest asset. Finally, for the mutual fund theorem, two funds are needed now instead of the traditional single fund. If an inflation <b>linked</b> <b>bond</b> can be included in the portfolio, the problem is reduced to the traditional mean variance problem with a risk-free and n+ 1 risky assets with real returns.

40|$|Inflation for retirees is {{different}} from, and mostly higher than, the widely quoted macroeconomic inflation {{rate for the}} population. For example in the U. S. the Consumer Price Index (CPI) has a lesser known cousin called the CPI-E (for the elderly) in which the subcomponent weights {{are based on the}} consumption patterns of Americans above the age of 62. This suggests that Inflation <b>Linked</b> <b>Bond</b> Funds (ILBFs) – which are based on aggregate population inflation with differing maturities – might not be the best hedge for individual retirees ’ cost of living. Motivated by this question, the current paper extends lifetime ruin minimization (LRM) techniques to investigate the choice between an ILBF and a generic nominal investment fund, for a retiree facing an exogenous liability. Our model trades-off the benefits of an albeit imperfect insurance hedge against the cost of lower investment growth. And, to keep the financial economists happy, in the appendix we also solve the model by maximizing utility of lifetime consumption. Either way our numerical results suggest that ILBFs should be treated as just another asset class in the broad optimization problem, as opposed to a special or unique category. 1 Introduction and Motivation As the first American baby boomer turned 62 on January 1 st 2008 and among other thing...|$|E

Reaction of 1 with dihydroxysilicon octaethylporphyrin led to an unstable µ-oxo linked Pc-O-Pn heteroligand dyad {{that could not be}} isolated. However, reaction with dihydroxygermanium octaethylporphyrin gave a stable dyad that showed substantial broad band absorption attributable to exciton effects. A small amount of the µ-oxo linked homo dyad formed by self-condensation of dihydroxygermanium octaethylporphyrin was detected by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry but was not isolated. Reaction of 1 with chloroboron subphthalocyanine afforded the stable Pc-O-SubPc heterodyad as the main product and the SubPc-O-Pc-O-SubPc triad as a minor side product. Both gave absorption spectra that showed the main features of the ligands present, implying limited exciton coupling. A further reaction of 1 with axial-hydroxy, axial-methyl silicon phthalocyanine provided a key Pc-O-Pc' dyad that proved to be an ideal intermediate for developing a synthetic strategy to access a series of hetero-metalloid/hetero-ligand Pc-O-Pc'-O-Pn triads.

40|$|The {{long-term}} {{external financing}} of a corporation is satisfied through {{the bond market}} where issues of index-linked bonds, which are discussed in this thesis, is one alternative. (Finnerty&Emery 2001) An index- <b>linked</b> <b>bond</b> is a debt instrument where the investor is guaranteed the principal and premium amount in real terms. As the bonds cash flows are indexed to the inflation this implies that the issuer of an index-linked bond assumes an inflation risk. Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to describe and examine corporate motives for choosing index-linked bonds as way of financing their business. Realization: Primary data was collected through interviews with corporate issuers of non-swapped index-linked bonds. Results: From our research it has been acknowledged that {{both internal and external}} factors determine the decision to issue index-linked bonds. The most important internal reason for the issuance was that this type of financing implies matching advantages, which helps lowering the companies’ risks. This is achieved by balancing the size and time of the cash inflows with the cash out- flows. Of the external factors we found that it is primary the financing cost that is of interest. The cost savings are primarily achieved because of the lower liquidity premium demanded when using index-linked bonds as a way of financing the business. We believe that this depends partly on the character of the investors and on market imperfections...|$|E
30|$|The {{environmental}} pollution caused {{by use of}} fossil fuels and constantly increasing energy crisis has stimulated the researchers for developing methods to utilize renewable resources for energy generation. Lignocellulosic biomass (LB) {{has emerged as a}} promising alternative to fossil fuels (Pang et al. 2010). It consists of lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose, among which cellulose and hemicellulose represents most abundant, un-digestible by human and unexploited renewable resources (Coman and Bahrim 2011; Kumari and Singh 2018). Cellulose is a water insoluble polysaccharide which is made up of glucose monomers linked by β- 1, 4 glycosidic bonds. These glucose monomers can be efficiently converted into bioethanol and several value-added chemicals  via  the commercially available chemical processes or fermentation using microbes (Chaturvedi and Verma 2013). The conversion of cellulosic bio-waste to food, feed and energy resources is hindered by its complex microcrystalline structure (Premalatha et al. 2015). In order to overcome these structural complexities and achieve efficient hydrolysis of cellulose various conventional strategies were used such as  treatment by mineral acids, ionic liquid promoted dissolution, sub- or super-critical water. Those conventional techniques are costly, results in the corrosion of vessels apart from problems associated with waste generated during the process (Pang et al. 2010). Therefore, to overcome the limitations and minimize the environmental impact, in recent times a green approach of utilizing cellulase enzyme complex is suggested. A group of glycosyl hydrolases i.e. endoglucanase (endo- 1, 4 -β-d-glucanase EG, EC 3.2. 1.4) which act internally on the chain of cellulose cleaving <b>linked</b> <b>bond</b> liberating non- reducing ends, cellobiohydrolase (exo- 1, 4 -β-d-glucanase, CBH, EC 3.2. 1.91) that remove cellobiose from this non-reducing end of cellulose chain (Li et al. 2012) and β-glucosidase (1, 4 -β-d-glucosidase, BG, EC 3.2. 1.21) completes the hydrolysis by splitting cellobiose and small cello-oligosaccharides to glucose and are collectively called as cellulase enzyme complex. The cellulase enzyme complex causes selective breakdown of cellulosic biomass to its constituent’s monomeric units which can acts as raw materials for various industries such as food, chemicals (Gomaa 2013) animal feed (Premalatha et al. 2015), paper and pulp industry and bioethanol (Moreau et al. 2015; Srivastava et al. 2018).|$|E
