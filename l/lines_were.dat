5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} shows that Zhou dynasty divination was grounded in cleromancy, the production of seemingly random numbers to determine divine intent. The Zhou yi provided a guide to cleromancy that used the stalks of the yarrow plant, {{but it is not}} known how the yarrow stalks became numbers, or how specific <b>lines</b> <b>were</b> chosen from the line readings. In the hexagrams, broken <b>lines</b> <b>were</b> used as shorthand for the numbers 6 (六) and 8 (八), and solid <b>lines</b> <b>were</b> shorthand for values of 7 (七) and 9 (九). The Great Commentary contains a late classic description of a process where various numerological operations are performed on a bundle of 50 stalks, leaving remainders of 6 to 9. Like the Zhou yi itself, yarrow stalk divination dates to the Western Zhou period, although its modern form is a reconstruction.|$|E

5|$|Despite the World War I, {{significant}} {{extensions of}} rail <b>lines</b> <b>were</b> carried out, {{particularly in the}} wheat growing areas in the north west and west.

By 1930 the railway map of Victoria was largely complete, with the best land settled and the remaining land marginal for agriculture, with a number of lines built across the state border into the Riverina of NSW. On November 1937 the first run of the Spirit of Progress was made, a streamlined all air conditioned train run between Melbourne and Albury, led by the matching S class steam locomotives.|$|E
