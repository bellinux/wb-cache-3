40|$|Purpose - This paper aims to {{identify}} the dimensions of service quality (SQ) in <b>liner</b> <b>shipping</b> and examine their effects on customer satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach - The indicators of SQ in <b>liner</b> <b>shipping</b> were identified from reviewing the literature and interviewing six qualified industry practitioners. An online survey was then administered to 183 liner shippers in Singapore. Subsequently, exploratory factor analysis and regression analysis were conducted. Findings - SQ in <b>liner</b> <b>shipping</b> can be represented by four key quality dimensions. In descending order of their impact on customer satisfaction, they are reliability, speed, responsiveness and value. Service differentiation by time-related attributes results in greater customer satisfaction than practising cost leadership in <b>liner</b> <b>shipping.</b> Research limitations/implications - Allocation of resources to develop SQ in <b>liner</b> <b>shipping</b> should mirror the priorities established in this research. In addition, the developed measurement model for SQ {{can serve as a}} reference for <b>liner</b> <b>shipping</b> firms to assess the quality of their services. Originality/value - A parsimonious and updated set of variables can now be used to represent SQ in the <b>liner</b> <b>shipping</b> sector.

40|$|Arnold, Michael A. Over {{the last}} twenty years a wave of {{consolidation}} has swept through the oceanic <b>liner</b> <b>shipping</b> industry, leaving the industry dominated by a handful of large firms, almost all of whom are involved in one of four major strategic alliances. As <b>liner</b> <b>shipping</b> is the dominant form of international transportation this shift in market structure could have a substantial impact of the global trading system. There is surprisingly little attention paid to transportation issues in the extant trade literature and virtually no attention paid to <b>liner</b> <b>shipping.</b> To rectify this gap in the literature, I examine the economic consequences of these changes in the <b>liner</b> <b>shipping</b> sector's market structure. Using a simple model of international trade I show that, given the unique conditions in the <b>liner</b> <b>shipping</b> industry, strategic alliances have an ambiguous effect on trade volume, but that the conditions under which strategic alliances are beneficial to trade are a more plausible description of the industry. I then empirically examine the relationship between <b>liner</b> <b>shipping</b> alliances and trade flows, using a unique data set with a geographic and temporal coverage not available in previous works. The empirical results show that there are some signs that alliances may be utilizing market power but this evidence is not consistent enough to warrant significant regulatory action. A legal analysis of the history of <b>liner</b> <b>shipping</b> regulation supports this conclusion by casting doubt on the effectiveness of the current <b>liner</b> <b>shipping</b> regulatory structure. In short, despite somewhat mixed evidence, there are reasons to believe that <b>liner</b> <b>shipping</b> alliances are beneficial to trade and that regulatory responses are unlikely to be productive.

A numerical example is carried out to illustrate the applicability of the proposed model and solution method. The numerical results show that chartering in ships may not always be a better policy for a long-term planning horizon though it is much cheaper than buying ships in the short-term.

A mixed-integer non-linear stochastic programming model is developed for the proposed <b>liner</b> <b>ship</b> route schedule design problem by minimizing the ship cost and expected bunker cost while maintaining a required transit time service level.

In addition, some comparative experiments also show that the proposed optimal decision policy can save at least 8 % fuel consumption cost by comparing with some relatively simple rules and save about 1 % cost on average by comparing with some brilliantly-designed rules.

40|$|This paper aims to {{estimate}} capacity utilization of a <b>liner</b> <b>ship</b> route with a bounded polyhedral container shipment demand pattern, arising in the liner container shipping industry. The proposed maximum and minimum <b>liner</b> <b>ship</b> route capacity utilization problems are formulated as a linear programming model and a min-max model, respectively. We examine two fundamental {{properties of the}} min-max model. These two nice properties enable us to develop two e-optimal global optimization algorithms for solving the min- max model, which find a globally e-optimal solution by iteratively cutting off the bounded polyhedral container shipment demand set with a cut. The latter algorithm overcomes non-convexity of the remaining feasible demand set generated by the former algorithm via a novel hyperplane cut. Each hyperplane cut can assure that the current vertex of the polyhedral demand set is cut off, whereas solutions that may improve the current one {{by more than a}} factor of e are retained. Extensive numerical experiments for problems larger than those encountered in real applications demonstrate the computational efficacy of the latter algorithm...|$|E

40|$|<b>Liner</b> <b>shipping</b> {{firms have}} long {{argued that the}} task of {{providing}} adequate service to shippers while earning reasonable rates of return on capital requires at least some form of limited antitrust immunity. Carriers contend that because scheduling requirements unique to <b>liner</b> <b>shipping</b> firms constrains their ability to adjust capacity to meet market conditions, <b>liner</b> <b>shipping</b> capacity is essentially fixed {{in the short term}} while demand is variable. And because individual firms have incentive to minimise unit costs by maximising capacity utilisation on every voyage, the threat of destructive price wars looms large. Consequently, carriers have advocated that governments leave them free to form collusive arrangements called conferences in which members are free to meet to discuss and fix prices. But how rigid is <b>liner</b> <b>shipping</b> capacity? Because of a lack of useable data on prices and capacity, this question has never been resolved empirically.
