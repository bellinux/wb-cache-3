50|$|The race organisers {{nevertheless}} flagged the warm-up lap at {{the normal}} time, leaving several cars delayed on the grid, either stalled or with their cockpits vacant. The resulting chaos when the grid formed up {{again at the}} end of this lap was exacerbated when Nelson Piquet missed his starting position and was sent round on another lap, with the other cars being held in position. As the cars began to overheat, several drivers turned off their engines, among them Arrows driver Riccardo Patrese, expecting another formation lap due to Piquet's error. However, the organisers began the start sequence as usual once Piquet had regained his position. Patrese was unable to restart his car and waved his arms to signal that he could not take the start. His mechanic, Dave Luckett, instantly came onto the track to restart the car from behind. But after he got onto the track, the <b>lighting</b> <b>sequence</b> to start the race had already begun, and the start went ahead despite the presence of Luckett and Patrese's gesticulations. In the confusion and likely unable to see Patrese's stalled car, the other Arrows driver, Siegfried Stohr, ploughed into the back of his teammate's car, hitting Luckett. Luckett suffered a broken leg and lacerations but survived the incident. But even after this incident, the race continued, and as the field was about to start the second lap, with marshals and Stohr's disabled car still on the circuit, cars passed by with very little space on the narrow track, and the marshals frantically waved at the drivers to stop and the confused drivers waved back at the marshals, who were still on the circuit as the cars passed by. The drivers stopped themselves rather than being directed to stop.|$|E

50|$|Only a {{few dozen}} <b>lighting</b> <b>sequences</b> were {{actually}} programmed into the sign's controller at any given time. Some online discussions of the sign reveal comments from individuals observant enough to have noted the repetition. Nonetheless, most of those familiar with the sign {{believed that it was}} slowly cycling through an essentially infinite number of possible lighting combinations.|$|R
5000|$|After this point, the <b>lighting</b> <b>sequence</b> will be {{different}} based {{on the type of}} tree and start that a race is using. The [...] "Standard" [...] tree will light up each large amber light consecutively with a [...]500 second delay in between them, then followed by the green light after another [...]500 second delay. A [...] "Professional" [...] tree will light up all of the large amber lights simultaneously, and then after a [...]400 second delay, light up the green light. Some classes will use a hybrid tree, known as a [...]500 Professional tree, where the delay is [...]500 seconds instead of the [...]400 seconds used in a standard Professional tree. On the activation of the green light from either style of tree, the drivers are supposed to start the race. Leaving the [...] "Staged" [...] line before the green light activates will instantly stop the count down and result in a lighting of the red light and a provisional disqualification of the offending driver in heads-up starts only. In a Professional Tree or a Standard Tree with a heads-up start, if both drivers leave before the green light activates, only the first to leave will be charged with a provisional disqualification. In a Standard Tree with staggered start times, a green light will be shown to the first driver, regardless if he jumped or not, and once the second driver takes the start, if one driver jumped the start, then that driver's lane will display the red light. If both drivers jump, only the driver whose infraction was worse will be shown the red light, {{as if it was a}} heads-up start. If the driver that did not active a red light in his lane commits a further foul during the run (crossing a lane boundary or hitting the barrier), and the driver who commits a red-light foul does not cross a boundary line, the red light violation is overturned and the driver who crosses the boundary line is disqualified, with the driver who committed the red-light foul winning the round.|$|E

We expose the architecture of a wireless network of sensors deployed at intersections, which takes local decisions {{without the help of}} a central entity. We define an adaptive algorithm, called TAPIOCA (distribuTed and AdaPtive IntersectiOns Control Algorithm), that uses data collected by this sensor network to decide dynamically of the green <b>light</b> <b>sequences,</b> considering three objectives: (i) reducing the users average waiting time while limiting the starvation probability; (ii) selecting in priority the movements that have the best load discharge potential and (iii) synchronizing successive lights, for example to create green waves.

40|$|The {{reference}} design {{described in}} this document implements a DMX 512 -A controller using Zilog’s Z 51 F 3220 MCU toward providing {{a basic understanding of}} the DMX 512 -A protocol, including its theory of operation, by using a common lighting application example. This reference design operates in one of three modes: Local Mode. In this mode, five control potentiometers are used to set transmitted light levels for each related Digital Multiplex (DMX) channel; each potentiometer corresponds to a single DMX channel. PC Mode. In this mode, a PC application is required. This PC application has two main functions: • DMX Controller Function – This function provides two methods of updating and trans-mitting light levels to a DMX Universe through the DMX 512 -A controller: – Auto-Fade: In this method, light levels are set through sliders. All values – from the set light levels down to zero (0) and from zero (0) up to the set light levels – are transmitted continuously when played. – Real-Time: In this method, light levels are transmitted each time a slider value changes. The Write to EEPROM function is used to download <b>lighting</b> <b>sequences</b> into the DMX 512 -A controller’s EEPROM. • Write to EEPROM Function – This function is used to download <b>lighting</b> <b>sequences</b> into the DMX 512 -A controller’s EEPROM.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{altering}} <b>light</b> pattern <b>sequences</b> on driver compliance at a busy, urban intersection were explored.

40|$|A {{research}} regarding coloured <b>light</b> <b>sequences</b> {{was conducted}} {{on the occasion of the}} author’s design of a pyramidal sculpture lit by RGB LED uplights inserted into the base. The goal of this inquiry was to develop design strategies and methodologies that meet the requirements and specificities of spatial-temporal sequences by means of coloured lights. In this way, four aspects such as light, colour, space and time were studied respectively in order to identify priorities for any further research. First, the RGB light source values were assessed in regard to their visual sensation. Second, the colour palette was observed, assessed and altered as a whole, in order to render this colour palette seemingly more continuous. Furthermore, previously determined relative luminance sensation values were used in order to redesign the RGB coding. On site experiments hinted towards the avoidance of the feeling of repetition and showed the importance of observer’s point of view in relation to the spatial organization and segmentation based on the visual scenes. In conclusion, both, empirical and theoretical research alluded to the importance of design methodologies of coloured <b>light</b> <b>sequences</b> based on the user’s visual perception in relation to the temporal and spatial context...|$|R

The normal function of traffic lights requires sophisticated control and coordination to ensure that traffic moves as smoothly and safely as possible and that pedestrians are protected when they cross the roads [1]. This Traffic <b>Light</b> <b>sequence</b> is generated using a specific switching mechanism which will help to control a traffic light system on a road in a specified sequence.
