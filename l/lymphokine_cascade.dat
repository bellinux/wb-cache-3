40|$|In a phase-I-study {{recombinant}} interleukin- 2 (rIL- 2) in a dose from 0. 01 to 0. 3 mg/m 2 /day for 7 to 14 {{days was}} infused intraperitoneally. Side effects were fever and fluid retention. 2 patients showed a bacterial peritonitis after paracentesis. The investigations {{showed that the}} intraperitoneal (i. p.) administration of interleukin- 2 activates the whole <b>lymphokine</b> <b>cascade...</b>|$|E
40|$|Fluorescein (FLU) -specific murine splenic B {{lymphocytes}} from nonimmunized adult mice {{were prepared}} by the hapten-gelatin fractionation technique and cultured singly or in very small numbers in 10 -microliters culture wells. Growth and differentiation to antibody-secreting status were promoted by polymeric FLU-conjugated antigens with or without added T-lymphocyte-derived conditioned media or purified cytokines. In some cultures, 3 T 3 fibroblasts or CBA/N thymocytes provided a source of filler cells. Anti-FLU antibody formation was detected by a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). With an optimal number (around 300) of 3 T 3 cells per well, up to 77 % of the B cells could be induced to produce detectable antibody. The ELISA permitted detection of antibody formation in essentially all wells where B-cell proliferation occurred, and it was more efficient in detecting antibody-forming clones than the hemolytic plaque assay, whether filler cells were present or not. When 10 B cells rather than 1 were included per well, the ELISA, detecting absorbance in standard fashion, provided a useful method for assessment of B-cell growth- and differentiation-promoting factors (BGDF). It was found that 3 T 3 cells gave less background stimulation than thymus cells, permitting the detection of as little as 1 / 100 th as much BGDF as with thymocytes, thus offering a dynamic range of up to 30 between control absorbance {{in the absence of}} factors and the optimal factor level. Use of 3 T 3 cells also avoids a potential <b>lymphokine</b> <b>cascade.</b> The system has confirmed that interleukin- 2 acts as a BGDF, but it has failed to establish an effect of interferon-gamma on B cells. It has also shown the inactivity of a variety of hemopoietic growth factors on B lymphocytes. This system thus promises to be a useful tool in the further analysis of B-lymphocyte activation...|$|E
40|$|In {{this report}} we {{examined}} the possibility that suppression of the mixed lymphocyte response by MLR-TsF results from interference with IL- 2 regulation of T cell proliferation. Two distinct processes of inhibition involving both a direct effect on IL- 2 -driven proliferation of responder T cells, and induction of a second-order suppressor cell (Ts 2) were described. Exogenous IL- 2 did not abrogate MLR-TsF-induced suppression, and activated responder cells from suppressed cultures expressed functional IL- 2 receptors by IL- 2 adsorption analysis. Thus, suppression is not {{due to lack of}} available IL- 2 or to abnormal acquisition of receptors for IL- 2 during T cell activation. In contrast, a profound MLR-TsF effect on IL- 2 -induced proliferation of HT 2 cells as well as MLR-activated cells was observed even after presaturation of receptors with excess IL- 2. These results differentiated the direct responder cell effect of MLR-TsF from its Ts 2 inductive capacity, and localized the defect in responder cell proliferation to events occurring subsequent to IL- 2 binding. When analyzed in terms of proposed models for hormone-receptor interactions, characteristic dose-response curves similarly predict a postreceptor defect. Examination of the Ts 2 pathway of suppression revealed a late- acting inhibitory effect peaking 72 h after MLR initiation. A minor part of Ts 2 activity was susceptible to exogenous IL- 2, and may reflect a requirement for IL- 2 during Ts 2 expansion. However, the most significant component of Ts 2 -mediated suppression was resistant to excess IL- 2, and IL- 2 production was normal in Ts 2 -regulated cultures, thus ruling out limitation of IL- 2 for responder cell use as the major mechanism of Ts 2 suppression. The complete pathway of Ts 2 suppression and its functional relationship to other MLR-TsF inhibitory activities is not yet fully understood. However, these results suggest that the ultimate mechanisms of alloantigen-induced suppression involve late events of the IL- 2 -dependent <b>lymphokine</b> <b>cascade...</b>|$|E
