Mythologies are full of stories of beasts and birds and fishes that have played intelligent parts in human affairs--creatures that have befriended particular persons by giving them information, by guiding them, by yielding them help; or else that have deceived them, verbally or otherwise. Evidently all these traditions, {{as well as those}} about abductions of women by animals and fostering of children by them, fall naturally into their places as results of the habitual misinterpretation I have described.|$|E

60|$|I {{contend that}} the right hon. gentleman's Constitution would have broken down in its first session, {{and that we should}} have then been forced to concede grudgingly and in a hurry the full measure of {{responsible}} government which, with all due formality, and without any precipitancy, the Letters Patent issued last week have now conferred. But even the right hon. gentleman himself did not intend his Constitution to be a permanent settlement. He intended it to be a transition, and a brief transition; and in the correspondence which passed on this subject two or three years is sometimes named as the period for which such a Constitution might conveniently have endured--two or three years, of which, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>point</b> out to the House, nearly two years have already gone. Seeing how little difference there is between us upon that question, I dispense with further argument as to the grant of a Transvaal Constitution, as I see the course we have adopted does commend itself to the good sense of all Parties in this country and is sustained at almost every point by almost every person conversant with South African affairs.|$|E
60|$|<b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>point</b> {{out that}} this is no sentimental or mystical statement. It is hard fact as any hard fact we know. We, you and I, are not only parts in a thought process, but parts of one flow of blood and life. Let me put that in a way that may be new to some readers. Let me remind you of what is {{sometimes}} told as a jest, the fact that the number of one's ancestors increases as we look back in time. Disregarding the chances of intermarriage, each one of us had two parents, four grandparents, eight great-grandparents, and so on backward, until very soon, in less than fifty generations, we should find that, but for the qualification introduced, we should have all the earth's inhabitants of that time as our progenitors. For a hundred generations it must hold absolutely true, that everyone of that time who has issue living now is ancestral to all of us. That brings the thing quite within the historical period. There is not a western European palaeolithic or neolithic relic that is not a family relic for every soul alive. The blood in our veins has handled it.|$|E

60|$|But that noble stanza {{about the}} water-works has other {{elements}} of nobility besides nationality. It provides a compact and almost perfect summary of the whole social problem in industrial countries like England and America. If I wished to set forth systematically {{the elements of the}} ethical and economic problem in Pittsburg or Sheffield, I could not do better than take these few words as a text, and divide them up like the heads of a sermon. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> note the <b>points</b> in some rough fashion here.|$|R
60|$|I do not, therefore, {{propose to}} occupy {{the time of the}} House with any {{elaborate}} justification of the merits of the Bill. Those we may discuss at our leisure later. I confine myself only to a few general observations. Two main defects in modern industrial conditions which were emphasised by the Royal Commission were the lack of mobility of labour and lack of information. With both of these defects the National System of Labour Exchanges is calculated to deal. Modern industry has become national. Fresh means of transport knit the country into one, as it was never knit before. Labour alone in its search for markets has not profited; the antiquated, wasteful, and demoralising method of personal application--that is to say, the hawking of labour--persists. Labour Exchanges will give labour {{for the first time a}} modernised market. Labour Exchanges, in the second place, will increase and will organise the mobility of labour. But <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>point</b> out that to increase the mobility of labour is not necessarily to increase the movement of labour. Labour Exchanges will not increase the movement of labour; they will only render that movement, when it has become necessary, more easy, more smooth, more painless, and less wasteful.|$|E
60|$|Now first I would ask, is any really {{continuous}} and thorough mental process {{going on at}} all about this war? I mean, is there any considerable {{number of people who}} are seeing it as a whole, taking it in as a whole, trying to get a general idea of it from which they can form directing conclusions for the future? Is there any considerable number of people even trying to do that? At any rate <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>point</b> out first that there is quite an enormous mass of people who--in spite of the fact that their minds are concentrated on aspects of this war, who are at present hearing, talking, experiencing little else than the war--are nevertheless neither doing nor trying to do anything that deserves to be called thinking about it at all. They may even be suffering quite terribly by it. But they are no more mastering its causes, reasons, conditions, and the possibility of its future prevention than a monkey that has been rescued in a scorching condition from the burning of a house will have mastered the problem of a fire. It is just happening to and about them. It may, for anything they have learnt about it, happen to them again.|$|E
6000|$|And while I {{am being}} thus {{biological}} <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>point</b> out another queer aspect {{in which our}} egotism is overridden by physical facts. Men and women are apt to think of their children as being their very own, blood of their blood and bone of their bone. But indeed {{one of the most}} striking facts in this matter is the frequent want of resemblance between parents and children. It is one of the commonest things in the world for a child to resemble an aunt or an uncle, or to revive a trait of some grandparent that has seemed entirely lost in the intervening generation. The Mendelians have given much attention to facts of this nature; and though their general method of exposition seems to me quite unjustifiably exact and precise, it cannot be denied that it is often vividly illuminating. It is so in this connexion. They distinguish between [...] "dominant" [...] and [...] "recessive" [...] qualities, and they establish cases in which parents with all the dominant characteristics produce offspring of recessive type. Recessive qualities are constantly being masked by dominant ones and emerging again in the next generation. It is not the individual that reproduces himself, it is the species that reproduces through the individual and often in spite of his characteristics.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Let</b> <b>me</b> at this <b>point</b> earnestly {{request the}} reader who dwells in an inland home, and who never hears the roaring {{of the terrible}} sea, {{carefully}} to note {{that in this case}} it was men of the coast who did the work, and people of the coast town who gave subscriptions, who sympathised with sufferers, and raised a Volunteer Corps. Ponder this well, good reader, and ask yourself the question, [...] "Is all as it should be here? Have I and my fellow-inlanders nothing to do but read, admire, and say, Well done?" [...] A hint is sufficient at this point. I will return to the subject hereafter.|$|R
40|$|I {{review the}} {{consequences}} of the chiral symmetry of QCD for the structure and dynamics of the low–lying baryons, with particular emphasis on the nucleon. 1 A short guide through this long essay There are many approaches which relate baryon structure and properties to QCD in the non–perturbative regime, i. e. at energies, where the running coupling constant αS(Q 2) is sufficiently large to render conventional perturbation theory doubtful. In this regime, quarks and gluons are confined within hadrons. In addition, the low–energy dynamics is severely constrained by the spontaneously and explicitly broken chiral symmetry of QCD. To account for these facts, many models have been invented which emphasize a certain aspect of the underlying theory. To pick one example, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> just <b>point</b> out that the bag model describes baryons made of bagged (confined) quarks in a simple and appealing picture, with the confinement due to the difference of the pressure in the vacuum and in the baryon state. However, in such a framework one has very little control over the approximations involved. Anothe...|$|R
40|$|Kevin Stenson’s article {{offers a}} {{powerful}} argument for examining governmentality in particular local configurations {{rather than as}} relatively abstract and text-centred studies of changing mentalities and rationalities of rule. I {{think this is an}} important endeavour, partly because more situated analyses of governmentality are necessary to enrich the analytical (and political) significance of the perspective; and partly because the view from governmentality has a capacity to enrich our understandings of governance, policy and practice. Kevin’s own discussion of community safety in the Thames Valley area demonstrates just how much such a situated analysis might add to an understanding of liberal rule in England in the 21 st century. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> highlight four <b>points</b> that I think are absolutely central to that analysis...|$|R

"All {{that now}} {{remains to be}} noticed," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Blyth, [...] "is the central portion of the composition, which is occupied by Columbus and his ships, and which represents the scene as it may actually be supposed to have occurred. Here we get to Reality, and to that sort of correctly-imitative art which is simple enough to explain itself. As a proof of this, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>point</b> attention to the rig of the ships, {{the actions of the}} sailors, and, more than all, to Columbus himself. Weeks of the most laborious consultation of authorities of which the artist is capable, have been expended over the impersonation of that one figure,--expended, I would say, in obtaining that faithful representation of individual character, which it is my earnest desire to combine with the higher or mystic element. One instance of this fidelity to Nature I may perhaps be permitted to point out in the person of Columbus, in conclusion. Pray observe him, standing rapturously on the high stern of his vessel--and oblige me, at the same time, by minutely inspecting his outstretched arms. First, however, let me remind you that this great man went to sea at the age of fourteen, and cast himself freely into all the hardships of nautical life; next, let me beg you to enter into my train of thought, and consider these hardships as naturally comprising, among other things, industrious haulings at ropes and manful tuggings at long oars; and, finally, let me now direct your attention to {{the manner in which the}} muscular system of the famous navigator is developed about the arms in anatomical harmony with this idea.

6000|$|For {{the fourth}} {{requisite}} of [...] "our house," [...] EARTH, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>point</b> {{you to your}} mother's plant-window, and beg you to remember the fact that through our long, dreary winters we are never a month without flowers, and the vivid interest which always attaches to growing things. The perfect house, as I conceive it, is to combine {{as many of the}} advantages of living out of doors as may be consistent with warmth and shelter, and one of these is the sympathy with green and growing things. Plants are nearer in their relations to human health and vigor than is often imagined. The cheerfulness that well-kept plants impart to a room comes not merely from gratification of the eye,--there is a healthful exhalation from them, they are a corrective of the impurities of the atmosphere. Plants, too, are valuable as tests of the vitality of the atmosphere; their drooping and failure convey to us information that something is amiss with it. A lady once told me that she could never raise plants in her parlors on account of the gas and anthracite coal. I answered, [...] "Are you not afraid to live and bring up your children in an atmosphere which blights your plants?" [...] If the gas escape from the pipes, and the red-hot anthracite coal or the red-hot air-tight stove burns out all the vital part of the air, so that healthy plants in a few days wither and begin to drop their leaves, it is sign that the air must be looked to and reformed. It is a fatal augury for a room that plants cannot be made to thrive in it. Plants should not turn pale, be long-jointed, long-leaved, and spindling; and where they grow in this way, we may be certain that there is a want of vitality for human beings. But where plants appear as they do in the open air, with vigorous, stocky growth, and short-stemmed, deep-green leaves, we may believe the conditions of that atmosphere are healthy for human lungs.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>point</b> out to {{you that}} at this present moment it passes the wit of man, so far as I know, to give a legal {{definition}} of technical education. If you expect to have an Act of Parliament with a definition which shall include all {{that ought to be}} included, and exclude all that ought to be excluded, I think you will have to wait a very long time. I imagine the whole matter is in a tentative state. You don't know what you will be called upon to do, and so you must try and you must blunder. Under these circumstances it is obvious that there are two alternatives. One of these is to give a free hand to each locality. Well, it is within my knowledge that there are a good many people with wonderful, strange, and wild notions as to what ought to be done in technical education, and {{it is quite possible that}} in some places, and especially in small places, where there are few persons who take an interest in these things, you will have very remarkable projects put forth, and in that case the sole court of appeal for those taxpayers, who did not approve of such projects, would be a court of law. I suppose the judges would have to settle what is technical education. That would not be an edifying process, I think, and certainly it would be a very costly one. The other alternative is the principle adopted in the bill of last year now abandoned. I don't say whether the bill was right or wrong in detail. I am dealing now only with the principle of the bill, which appears to me to have been very often misunderstood. It has been said that it gave the whole of technical education into the hands of the Science and Art Department. It appears to me nothing could be more unfounded than that assertion. All I understand the Government proposed to do was to provide some authority who should have power to say in case any scheme was proposed, [...] "Well, this comes within the four corners of the Act of Parliament, work it as you like;" [...] or if it was an obviously questionable project, should take upon itself the responsibility of saying, [...] "No, that is not what the Legislature intended; amend your scheme." [...] There was no initiative, no control; there was simply this power of giving authority to decide upon the meaning of the Act of Parliament to a particular department of the State, whichever it might be; and it seems to me that that is a very much simpler and better process than relegating the whole question to the law courts. I think that here, or anywhere else, people must be extremely sanguine if they suppose that the House of Commons and the House of Lords will ever dream of giving any local authority unlimited power to tax the inhabitants of a district for any object it pleases. I should say that was not in the range of practical politics. Well, I put that before you as a matter for your consideration.|$|E

In that farce {{there is a very}} good {{character}} (one Mrs. Hilary, which I have seen Mrs. Orger, I think, act to admiration), that would have been played by Mrs. C. Jones, if she had acted Dame Quickly, as we at first intended. If you find yourself quite comfortable and at ease among us, in Mrs. Quickly, would you like to take this other part too? It is an excellent farce, and is safe, I hope, to be very well done.|$|R

60|$|Is polling really {{essential}} to the democratic idea? That is the question now very earnestly put to the reader. We are so terribly {{under the spell of}} established conditions, we are all so obsessed by the persuasion that the only conceivable way in which a man can be expressed politically is by himself voting in person, that we do all of us habitually overlook a possibility, a third choice, that lies ready to our hands. There is a way by means of which the indisputable evils of democratic government may be very greatly diminished, without destroying or even diminishing--indeed, rather enhancing--that invigorating sense of unhampered possibilities, that the democratic idea involves. There is a way of choosing your public servants of all sorts and effectually controlling public affairs on perfectly sound democratic principles, without ever having such a thing as an election, as it is now understood, at all, a way which will permit of a deliberate choice between numerous candidates--a thing utterly impossible under the current system--which will certainly raise the average quality of our legislators, and be infinitely saner, juster, and more deliberate than our present method. And, moreover, it is a way that is typically the invention of the English people, and which they use to-day in another precisely parallel application, an application which they have elaborately tested and developed through a period of at least seven or eight hundred years, and which I must confess myself amazed to think has not already been applied to our public needs. This way is the Jury system. The Jury system was devised to meet almost exactly the same problem that faces us to-day, the problem of how on the one hand to avoid putting a man's life or property into the hands of a Ruler, a privileged person, whose interest might be unsympathetic or hostile, while on the other protecting him from the tumultuous judgments of a crowd--to save the accused from the arbitrary will of King and Noble without flinging him to the mob. To-day it is exactly that problem over again that our peoples have to solve, except that instead of one individual affair we have now our general affairs to place under a parallel system. As the community that had originally been small enough and intimate enough to decide on the guilt or innocence of its members grew to difficult proportions, there developed this system of selecting by lot a number of its common citizens who were sworn, who were then specially instructed and prepared, and who, in an atmosphere of solemnity and responsibility in absolute contrast with the uproar of a public polling, considered the case and condemned or discharged the accused. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>point</b> out that this method is so universally recognized as superior to the common electoral method that any one who should propose to-day to take the fate of a man accused of murder {{out of the hands of}} a jury and place it in the hands of any British or American constituency whatever, even in the hands of such a highly intelligent constituency as one of the British universities, would be thought to be carrying crankiness beyond the border line of sanity.|$|E
60|$|<b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>point</b> {{out what}} is {{probably}} {{the result of a}} dim recognition of this fact by the non-local population, and that is the extreme jealousy of rates and municipal trading by the less localized paying classes in the community. That is a question we Socialists, believing as we do all of us at least in the abstract theory of municipalization, must particularly consider. The easy exasperation of the £1000-a-year man at the rates and his extreme patience under Imperial taxation is incomprehensible, unless you recognize this fact of his delocalization. Then at once it becomes clear. He penetrates the pretences of the system to a certain extent; and he is infuriated by the fact of taxation without representation, tempered by a mysteriously ineffective voting paper left at his door. I myself, as one of the delocalized class, will confess he has my sympathy. And those who believe in the idea of the ultimate municipalization of most large industries, will continue to find in this non-localized class, working especially through the medium of Parliament, a persistent and effective obstruction to all such projects, unless such a rectification of areas can be contrived as will overtake the delocalization and the diffusion of interests that has been and is still going on. I will confess that {{it seems to me that}} this opposition between the localized and the non- localized classes in the future, or to be more correct, the opposition between the man whose ideas and life lie in a small area, and the man whose ideas and life lie in a great area, is likely to give us that dividing line in politics for which so many people are looking to-day. For this question of areas has its Imperial as well as its local side. You have already seen the Liberal party split upon the Transvaal question; you yourselves have--I am told--experienced some slight parallel tendency to fission, and it is interesting to note that this was, after all, only another aspect of this great question of areas, which I would now discuss in relation to municipal trading. The small communities are fighting for existence and their dear little ways, the synthetic great communities are fighting to come into existence, and to absorb the small communities. And curiously enough at our last meeting you heard Mr. Belloc, with delightful wit and subtlety, expounding the very antithesis of the conceptions I am presenting to-night. Mr. Belloc--who has evidently never read his Malthus--dreams of a beautiful little village community of peasant proprietors, each sticking like a barnacle to his own little bit of property, beautifully healthy and simple and illiterate and Roman Catholic and local, local over the ears. I am afraid the stars in their courses fight against such pink and golden dreams. Every tramway, every new twopenny tube, every light railway, every improvement in your omnibus services, in your telephonic services, in your organization of credit, increases the proportion of your delocalized class, and sucks the ebbing life from your old communities into the veins of the new.|$|E

Through my Will you will [...] have a great position and a great estate, and though you may have to [...] yield up the latter in accordance with my wish, as already expressed [...] in this letter, the very doing so will give you an even greater hold [...] than this possession in the hearts of the mountaineers, should they [...] ever come to know it. Should it be that at the time you inherit from [...] me the Voivode Vissarion should not be alive, it may serve or aid you [...] to know that in such case you would be absolved from any conditions [...] of mine, though I trust you would in that, as in all other matters, [...] hold obligation enforced by your own honour as to my wishes. [...] Therefore the matter stands thus: If Vissarion lives, you will [...] relinquish the estates. Should such not be the case, you will act as [...] you believe that I would wish you to. In either case the [...] mountaineers should not know from you in any way of the secret [...] contracts between Vissarion and myself. Enlightenment of the many [...] should (if ever) come from others than yourself. And unless such [...] take place, you would leave the estates without any quid pro quo [...] whatever. This you need not mind, for the fortune you will inherit [...] will leave you free and able to purchase other estates in the Blue [...] Mountains or elsewhere that you may select in the world.|$|E
40|$|Starlicide is {{described}} as a slow-acting avicide for the control of starlings and blackbirds around livestock and poultry operations. The active ingredient is 3 -chloro-p-toluidine hydrochloride which has been identified by the Denver Re-search Center of the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service as DRC- 1339. A casual review of information about this bird control material suggests the following paradoxes: The use of the chemical in bird control appears to be covered by a patent, but the licensor wishes to remain anonymous. The licensee, which produces and sells the commercial material, seems unwilling to discuss the product. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> hasten to <b>point</b> out that these apparent incongruities can be attri-buted to numerous factors which range from the emotional response of some segments of the public, to the cold-blooded review of budgets and profit and loss statements by businessmen in our free enterprise system...|$|R

As he is such a careful and scholarly author, there are almost no misunderstandings {{to get out of the}} way first. At the beginning of section 2, there is a conflation of different concepts of possibility. If we grant that imaginability is conceivability (in the sense of being describable without any logical contradictions), if we pass over “practical ” possibility as a non-defined term, and grant that by “physically ” possible Zahavi very likely means “nomologically ” possible, it still would present a major step to say that something is conceptually or (my emphasis) metaphysically possible. Not everything that is logically or conceptually possible is metaphysically possible as well—metaphysically possible worlds (just like nomologically possible worlds) have to be interpreted as a subset of logically possible worlds. How this can be done is a subject of intense and highly technical debates in current philosophy of mind. We cannot possibly enter this debate here, but <b>let</b> <b>me</b> just <b>point</b> out how, for instance, Zahavi’s remarks in the second paragraph of page 4 rest on a conflation between nomological and logical possibility. A second misunderstanding, traditionally and typically reiterated by phenomenologists, is the rhetorical question of whether pathology can actually reveal something fundamental about the deep structure of normal experience. Neurophenomenological case studies are simply instruments in the search for a functionalist theory of mind. The aim is not to make sweeping claims about the structure of non-pathological experience, but to isolate distinct causal roles, to find double dissociations—to investigate which forms of phenomenal content are independent of eac...|$|R
