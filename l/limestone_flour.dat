25|$|Some {{researchers}} use chicken mash for feed. A {{plastic pipe}} {{can be cut}} in half lengthwise to make two troughs {{which can be used}} as feeders for mash. Mix laying mash (used for egg-producing hens) into the feed to provide calcium for the snails' shells. Commercial chicken feeding mash is around 16% to 17% protein, from fish meal and meat meal, making it good for growing snails. Supplying mash to hatchlings might reduce cannibalism. Two feeds that snails like and that promote good growth are: (A) broiler finisher mash consisting of 7% broiler concentrate, 58% corn, 16% soya, 18% sorghum, 7% <b>limestone</b> <b>flour</b> (40% Ca); and (B) chicken feed (pellets) for layers consisting of 5% layer concentrate, 10%, corn, 15% soya, 20% sorghum, 44% barley, 6% <b>limestone</b> <b>flour</b> (40% Ca).|$|E
50|$|In the Piégut-Pluviers Granodiorite existed a quarry near Lacaujamet (commune of Saint-Estèphe, not {{far from}} Piégut-Pluviers) that once {{extracted}} granodiorite lintels for doors and windows. The Toarcian clays were exploited by numerous small tile factories. The relatively soft Cretaceous limestones (especially the Turonian) were mined in hundreds of small quarries, because they were a much appreciated building stone. All these activities have now almost {{come to a halt}} in the park. There are a few quarries still in operation, but they produce mainly gravel for roadworks or <b>limestone</b> <b>flour</b> for agricultural purposes.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} fly ash and {{limestone}} powder in concrete on {{the properties of}} self compacting fresh concrete mixture and hardened concrete was studied. It {{has been found that}} the self compacting concrete mixtures with <b>limestone</b> <b>flour</b> used as a filler show lower fluidity and higher air content as compared to those with fly ash. The concretes with limestone filler reveal higher water permeability and lower freeze-thaw resistance as well as the resistance to the attack of de-icers as compared to the concretes with fly ash. The rheological properties of the mixture and hardened material are improved at higher fineness of this additive. From the observations of microstructure of concrete samples one can conclude that the lower resistance of self compacting concrete with limestone filler is the consequence of the higher capillary porosity and the presence of large crystals of hydrated phases...|$|E
50|$|Kusel station owed its {{importance}} to freight transport, {{especially for the}} local industry and the Unteroffizier-Krüger Barracks. Sometimes it served troop trains to the neighbouring Baumholder military training area. In 1905, it received or dispatched a total of 35,495.11 tons of freight. The station mainly received bricks, <b>limestone,</b> malt, <b>flour,</b> iron and other fertilizers, cement, gypsum and lime. It shipped mainly wire and wire nails, cereal and beer. In 1920, a local freight train (Nahgüterzug) ran from Kaiserslautern to Kusel and another ran between Altenglan and Kusel. A through freight train (Durchgangsgüterzug) ran from Kaiserslautern to Kusel. After the Second World War, revenue declined steadily. Until the mid-1960s, the stations of Thallichtenberg and Pfeffelbach along the line to Türkismühle were served by a freight exchange train (Übergabegüterzug) from Kusel. In the 1990s, it was served only by a freight exchange train between Kaiserslautern-Einsiedlerhof station on the Mannheim-Saarbrücken line and Kusel. Now, the station has no freight operations and its freight tracks have been dismantled.|$|R
5000|$|Poultices for {{removing}} stains {{are made from}} a malleable mass of a porous material (paper, whiting, diatomaceous earth, <b>flour,</b> <b>limestone)</b> filled with a solvent which {{can be applied to}} the surface of the stone. The solvent used (ammonia, acetone, alcohol, peroxide, etc.) depends on what substance caused the stain. As the solvent penetrates the surface of the porous stone containing the stain, it forms a single continuous solution between the stone and the poultice on the surface. The poultice is kept moist and covered to allow time for the solvent to sufficiently penetrate the stone and dissolve the staining material, be it grease or solute. The solute will then equilibrate by passive diffusion between the stone and the poultice. After an adequate time for this process to occur, the poultice is removed and with it the solution containing a portion of the dissolved solute or [...] "stain". Multiple repetitions of the process will eventually decrease the concentration of the solute or [...] "stain" [...] within the stone until it is invisible or minimally visible.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{influence}} of supplemental calcium given in flour or granular form and calcium intake on bone properties and egg characteristics of brown-egg laying hens was investigated at sexual maturity and {{at end of}} lay. Physical and mechanical bone characteristics were determined using 3 -point and torsional tests. There was no effect of calcium source on the measured bone characteristics at sexual maturity. Bone breaking strength {{was positively correlated with}} both stiffness and total calcium intake. At 72 weeks, birds which had been offered additional calcium of either source exhibited considerably higher bone breaking strength than did control birds. Bone stiffness of birds offered limestone granules was significantly higher than control birds. Regression analysis showed strong relationships between calcium intake, bone stiffness and breaking strength. Shell quality was significantly better for birds consuming limestone in a granular form than for control birds. Shell quality for birds given <b>limestone</b> <b>flour</b> was intermediate between the other two groups. It is concluded that calcium supplementation increases egg quality, mechanical properties of the bone and as a consequence, may be able {{to reduce the risk of}} broken bones at the end of laying period. These effects are independent of the form of the supplemented calcium. Key words: Osteopenia, calcium, shell quality, bone strengt...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This {{study was}} {{designed}} {{to determine the effects of}} (1) environmental tempera-tures of 20 °, 23 ° and 26 ° C, (2) laying cages vs. conventional litter floors, and (3) <b>limestone</b> <b>flour</b> vs. granulated limestone on the reproductive performance of Large White turkey hens for a 24 -week experimental period. Females in an environmental temperature of 26 ° C. laid significantly (P s 0. 05) fewer eggs on the average than those maintained at temperatures of 20 ° and 23 ° C. (51. 6 vs. 64. 0 and 60. 0 eggs, respectively). Egg shell breaking strength showed no consistent trend with increased temperature. Percentage settable eggs, fertility, hatchability and feed consumption were unaffected within the range of environmental temperatures imposed. Females in laying cages showed an increase in egg production, a lower percentage of settable eggs, poorer egg shell thickness and egg shell breaking strength, an increase in feed consumption, and reduced fertility and hatchability compared to those in conventional litter pens. Indications from the plasma calcium concentrations were that the egg shell quality problem in caged hens may be related to calcium metabolism. Neither the ground limestone nor the # 10 -limestone particle diets had any effect on th...|$|E

40|$|A {{technology}} for wet pressing of carbohydrate-vitamin-mineral additives with increase in content of molasses was developed. In the UVMD wet pressing with increased molasses content two options for finished additives were considered: briquettes and pellets. In {{the first phase}} of work pilot batch of feed supplement for cattle was prepared: 25 % of rapeseed meal; 10 % of soybean meal; 4 % of feeding oil; 51 % of molasses; 5 % of lime; 5 % of premix. It is established that satisfactory mixing occurs when entering the molasses up to 40 %. Further increase in molasses content causes deterioration of mixing. In the second phase a research at the choice of materials, providing hardening of molasses briquette was carried out. At the same time additives for cattle contained 30 [...] . 50 % of molasses, sunflower meal, wheat bran, beet pulp, tricalcium phosphate, salt, premix. 3 % of hydrated lime and zeolite and also 5 % of <b>limestone</b> <b>flour</b> were used as the cementitious materials in the preparation of pellets with the molasses content of 40, 0 %. Briquettes with 30 % and 50 % of molasses do not have sufficient strength. It has been established that when entering the 50 % of molasses and 3 % of hardeners countercurrent flow of material in the mixer stops, the mixture becomes viscous, of pasty consistency. Molasses briquettes had not hardened during storage, were soft and plastic. Briquettes containing 40, 0 % of molasses and 3, 0 % of hydrated or unhydrated lime were hard in comparison with briquettes containing other hardeners. With increasing input of hardeners up to 5 % molasses blocks were more solid and retained its shape...|$|E
