50|$|Laser {{trackers}} are {{instruments that}} accurately measure large objects by determining {{the positions of}} optical targets held against those objects. The accuracy of laser trackers is {{of the order of}} 0.025 mm over a distance of several metres. Some examples of <b>laser</b> <b>tracker</b> applications are to align aircraft wings during assembly and to align large machine tools. To take measurements the technician first sets up a <b>laser</b> <b>tracker</b> on a tripod with an unobstructed view of the object to be measured. The technician removes a target {{from the base of the}} <b>laser</b> <b>tracker</b> and carries it to the object to be measured, moving smoothly to allow the <b>laser</b> <b>tracker</b> to follow the movement of the target. The technician places the target against the object and triggers measurements to be taken at selected points, sometimes by a remote control device. Measurements can be imported into different types of software to plot the points or to calculate deviation from the correct position.|$|E

40|$|Small and {{unintended}} offsets, tilts, and eccentricity of {{the mechanical}} and optical components in <b>laser</b> <b>trackers</b> introduce systematic errors in the measured spherical coordinates (angles and range readings) and possibly in the calculated lengths of reference artifacts. It is desirable that the tests described in the ASME B 89. 4. 19 Standard [1] be sensitive to these geometric misalignments so that any resulting systematic errors are identified during performance evaluation. In this paper, we present some analysis, using error models and numerical simulation, of {{the sensitivity of the}} length measurement system tests and two-face system tests in the B 89. 4. 19 Standard to misalignments in <b>laser</b> <b>trackers.</b> We highlight key attributes of the testing strategy adopted in the Standard and propose new length measurement system tests that demonstrate improved sensitivity to some misalignments. Experimental results with a tracker that is not properly error corrected for the effects of the misalignments validate claims regarding the proposed new length tests.

50|$|In optical interferometry, the {{pathlength}} {{difference between}} sample and reference arms {{can be measured}} by TOF methods, such as frequency modulation followed by phase shift measurement or cross correlation of signals.

50|$|It is {{imperative}} to have all beamline sections, magnets, etc., aligned by a survey and alignment crew by using a <b>laser</b> <b>tracker.</b> All beamlines must be within micrometre tolerance. Good alignment helps to prevent beam loss, and beam from colliding with the pipe walls, which creates secondary emissions and/or radiation.|$|E

50|$|Hand-held laser {{scanners}} {{create a}} 3D image through the triangulation mechanism described above: a laser dot or line is projected onto an object from a hand-held device and a sensor (typically a charge-coupled device or position sensitive device) measures {{the distance to}} the surface. Data is collected in relation to an internal coordinate system and therefore to collect data where the scanner is in motion the position of the scanner must be determined. The position can be determined by the scanner using reference features on the surface being scanned (typically adhesive reflective tabs, but natural features have been also used in research work) or by using an external tracking method. External tracking often {{takes the form of a}} <b>laser</b> <b>tracker</b> (to provide the sensor position) with integrated camera (to determine the orientation of the scanner) or a photogrammetric solution using 3 or more cameras providing the complete six degrees of freedom of the scanner. Both techniques tend to use infra red light-emitting diodes attached to the scanner which are seen by the camera(s) through filters providing resilience to ambient lighting.|$|E
