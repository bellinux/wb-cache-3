5|$|In animals, poly(A) {{ribonuclease}} (PARN) {{can bind to}} the 5' cap {{and remove}} nucleotides from the poly(A) tail. The <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to the 5' cap and poly(A) tail is important in controlling how soon the mRNA is degraded. PARN deadenylates less if the RNA is bound by the initiation factors 4E (at the 5' cap) and 4G (at the poly(A) tail), which is why translation reduces deadenylation. The rate of deadenylation may also be regulated by RNA-binding proteins. Once the poly(A) tail is removed, the decapping complex removes the 5' cap, leading to a degradation of the RNA. Several other enzymes {{that seem to be}} involved in deadenylation have been identified in yeast.|$|E

Most entrances and exits from the Bethlehem agglomeration {{to the rest of}} the West Bank are currently subjected to Israeli checkpoints and roadblocks. The <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> varies based on Israeli security directives. Travel for Bethlehem's Palestinian residents from the West Bank into Jerusalem is regulated by a permit-system. Palestinians require a permit to enter the Jewish holy site of Rachel's Tomb. Israeli citizens are barred from entering Bethlehem and the nearby biblical Solomon's Pools.|$|E

2500|$|Older {{generations of}} Americans have {{consistently}} reported the lowest <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to the Internet per age cohorts.

The same trend holds true on the individual level: in 2005, 26% of Americans ages 65+, 67% of ages 50–64, 80% of ages 30–49, and 84% of ages 18–29 reported Internet access. As a whole, usage rates are increasing rapidly, but older Americans still have the lowest levels of Internet connectivity: by 2009, 39.9% of households 65 years and older, 68.2% of households 45-64, and 71.2% of households 16-44 reported connecting to the Internet. Per the oldest generations of Americans, 4% of the G.I. Generation (85+), 7% of the Silent Generation (66-84), and 35% of the Baby Boomers (47-65) had connected to the Internet by February 2008. Although older generations still hold the lowest amount of Internet usage age-wise, the United States has seen a dramatic increase in Internet users at the age of 65 and older.

2500|$|While in {{the offing}} of an ASEAN common currency, {{the leaders of the}} member-states of ASEAN agreed in November 1999 to create the {{establishment}} of currency swaps, and repurchase agreements, as a credit line against future financial shocks. In May 2000, the finance minister of the ASEAN agreed through the [...] "Chiang Mai Initiative" [...] to plan for closer monetary and financial co-operation. The [...] "Chiang Mai Initiative" [...] or CMI, named after the City of Chiang Mai in Thailand, has two components: an expanded ASEAN Swap Arrangement, and a network of bilateral swap arrangements among ASEAN countries, China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. The ASEAN Swap Arrangement or ASA preceded the regional financial crisis. ASA was originally established by the ASEAN central bank and monetary authorities of the five founding members of ASEAN with a view to help countries meet temporary liquidity problems. An expanded ASA now includes all ten ASEAN countries with an expanded facility of US$1 billion. In recognition of the economic interdependence of East Asia, which has a combined foreign exchange reserves amounting to about US$1 trillion, a network of bilateral swap arrangements and repurchase agreements among ASEAN countries, China, Japan and the Republic of Korea has been agreed upon. The supplementary facility aims to provide temporary financing for members which may be in balance-of-payments difficulties. In 200, 16 bilateral swap arrangements (BSAs) have been successfully concluded with a combined amount of about US$35.5 billion. The original CMI was signed on 9 December 2009 which took effect on 20 March 2014, while the amended version, the multilateralisation of CMI (CMIM), was on 17 July 2014. CMIM is a multilateral currency swap arrangement with a total size of US$240 billion, governed by a single contractual agreement, while the CMI is a network of bilateral swap arrangements among the [...] "Plus Three" [...] and ASEAN countries' authorities. In addition, an independent regional surveillance unit called the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) was established to monitor and analyse regional economies, and to support the CMIM decision-making process. The amendments will effectively allow access of the ASEAN+3 member countries and Hong Kong to an enhanced CMIM package, which includes, among others, the doubling of the fund size from US$120 billion to US$240 billion, an increase in the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> not linked to an International Monetary Fund program from 20%–30%, [...] and the introduction of a crisis prevention facility. These amendments are expected to fortify CMIM as the region's financial safety net in the event of any potential or actual liquidity difficulty.|$|E
