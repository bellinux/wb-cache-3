40|$|Blue <b>light</b> <b>receptors</b> in Arabidopsis {{include two}} types of proteins, cryptochromes and phototropins. Previous studies have {{suggested}} that the cryptochromes cry 1 and cry 2 function mainly in photomorphogenic responses and that the phototropins phot 1 and phot 2 mainly regulate photo-induced movements. Receptors in the same family have redundant functions, although their responses to the fluence rate of blue light differ. To uncover functions of blue <b>light</b> <b>receptors</b> that may be concealed by their functional redundancy, we conducted analyses of combinatorial multiple mutants of blue <b>light</b> <b>receptors.</b> Comparison of the responses of the quadruple mutant cry 1 cry 2 phot 1 phot 2 to blue light with those of related triple mutants revealed that cryptochromes function in blue light-dependent, random hypocotyl-bending and that phototropins function in one photomorphogenic response, cotyledon expansion.

The molecular mechanisms underlying functional interactions of cryptochromes and phyto-chromes remain largely unclear. We have identiÞed an Arabidopsis photomor-phogenic mutant, sub 1, which exhibits hypersensitive responses to blue light and far-red light. Genetic analyses indicate that SUB 1 functions {{as a component of}} a cryptochrome signaling pathway and as a modulator of a phytochrome signaling pathway. The SUB 1 gene encodes a Ca 21 -binding protein that sup-presses light-dependent accumulation of the transcription factor HY 5.

With twin lens reflex and rangefinder cameras, the viewed image could be {{significantly different from the}} final image. When the shutter button is pressed on a mechanical SLR, the mirror flips out of the light path, allowing light to pass through to the <b>light</b> <b>receptor</b> and the image to be captured.|$|E
50|$|Vision {{relies on}} {{quantized}} energy {{in order to}} convert light signals to an action potential in a process called phototransduction. In phototransduction, a photon interacts with a chromophore in a <b>light</b> <b>receptor.</b> The chromophore absorbs the photon and undergoes photoisomerization. This change in structure induces {{a change in the}} structure of the photo receptor and resulting signal transduction pathways lead to a visual signal. However, the photoisomerization reaction occurs at a rapid rate, in under 200 femtoseconds, with high yield. Models suggest the use of quantum effects in shaping the ground state and excited state potentials in order to achieve this efficiency.|$|E

50|$|When {{inside the}} RPE cell, bound to CRBP, the all-trans retinol is esterified by Lecithin Retinol Acyltransferase (LRAT) {{to form a}} retinyl ester. The retinyl esters of the RPE are chaperoned by a protein known as RPE65. It is in this form that the RPE stores most of its retinoids, as the RPE stores 2-3 times more retinoids than the neural retina itself. When further {{chromophore}} is required, the retinyl esters are acted on by isomerohydrolase to produce 11-cis retinol, which is transferred to the Cellular Retinaldehyde Binding Protein (CRALBP). 11-cis retinol is transformed into 11-cis retinal by 11-cis Retinol Dehydrogenase, then it is shipped back to the rod photoreceptors via IRBP. There, it replaces the spent chromophore in opsin molecules, allowing the opsin to function again as a <b>light</b> <b>receptor.</b>|$|E
50|$|Nyctinastic {{movements}} {{are associated with}} diurnal light and temperature changes and controlled by the circadian clock and the <b>light</b> <b>receptor</b> phytochrome. Plants use phytochrome to detect red and far red light. Depending on which kind of light is absorbed, the protein can switch between a Pr state that absorbs red light and a Pfr state that absorbs far red light. Red light converts Pr to Pfr and far red light converts Pfr to Pr. Many plants use phytochrome to establish circadian cycles which influence the opening and closing of leaves associated with nyctastic movements. Anatomically, the {{movements are}} mediated by pulvini. Pulvinus cells are located at the base or apex of the petiole and the flux {{of water from the}} dorsal to ventral motor cells regulates leaf closure. This flux is in response to movement of potassium ions between pulvinus and surrounding tissue. Movement of potassium ions is connected to the concentration of Pfr or Pr. In Albizzoa julibrissin longer darker periods, leading to low Pfr leads to a faster leaf opening. In the SLEEPLESS mutation of Lotus japonicus, the pulvini are changed into petiole-like structures, rendering the plant incapable of closing its leaflets at night.|$|E

A newly isolated gene, RPT 2, controls one of these pathways. The RPT 2 gene is light inducible; encodes a novel protein with putative phosphorylation sites, a nuclear localization signal, a BTB/POZ domain, and a coiled-coil domain; and belongs to a large gene family that includes the recently isolated NPH 3 gene.

40|$|Aspergilli are {{ubiquitous}} soil-borne fungi growing {{within or}} {{on the surface of}} numerous organic substrates. Growth within a substrate or growth on the surface correlates to different growth conditions for the hyphae due to significant changes in oxygen or reactive oxygen species levels and variations in humidity or temperature. The production of air-borne spores is supported by the substrate-air interphase and also requires a sensing system to adapt appropriately. Here we focus on light as important parameter for the mycelium to discriminate between different habitats. The fungal ‘eye’ includes several light sensors which react to a broad plethora of wavelengths.

We are at present almost completely ignorant of the photosensitive processes of animals at levels of organization below that of the image-forming eye, and an analysis of the properties of these simpler types of receptors offers one of the most promising approaches to an understanding of the common pattern of photo-receptor processes in general.

40|$|The {{existence}} of two photoreceptors regulating chloroplast orientation {{was found in}} the centric diatom Pleurosira laevis. Chloroplasts migrate through the transvacuolar cytoplasmic strands according to the light conditions. Weak white light of less than 46 μmol/m 2 · s (10 W/m 2) induces chloroplast movement to the cortical cytoplasm, which is located next to the plasma membrane (dispersion), while intense white light of more than 92 μmol/m 2 · s (20 W/m 2) induces chloroplast movement towards the nucleus, which is situated {{in the center of the}} cell (assemblage). Chloroplast dispersion was maintained as long as the cells were irradiated with weak white light. Conversely, chloroplast assemblage under intense white light was transient and the chloroplasts were released from assemblage after 15 min.

In this study, both phosphorylation and protein levels of CBP and CBP 8 were upregulated under drought stress in the leaf, consistent with the recent report (Bian et al. 2017). This suggests that a few phosphorylated proteins such as CBP were upregulated to alleviate the influences on photosynthesis when suffered from drought stress.|$|E
40|$|Plants {{translate}} {{the sensation of}} light into the regulation of protein interactions that directly control their internal molecular clock mechanism {{and the time of}} flowering. Recognizing seasonal change allows many plant species to select the most favorable time of the year to flower, thereby increasing the chances of their reproductive success. To recognize these transitions, a plant measures variations in day length and compares them with its circadian clock, an internal molecular oscillator that controls daily biological rhythms, such as leaf movements and the opening of stomata, pores in the plant’s leaves (1). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this coordination are still largely missing. Now, Sawa et al. on page 261 of this issue (2) and a recent study by Kim et al. (3) bring us a big step closer toward characterizing such mechanisms by identifying two light-sensing molecular switches that directly control flowering and clock oscillation. Molecular genetic studies performed in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana have shown that photoperiodic flowering and regulation of the circadian clock share common elements, including <b>light</b> <b>receptors</b> and proteins comprising the circadian timekeeper (1).
