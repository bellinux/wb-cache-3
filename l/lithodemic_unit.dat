40|$|This report {{presents}} a classification of mapped onshore igneous intrusions of the UK that were emplaced during the Phanerozoic Eon, {{and which are}} represented in the BGS DiGMapGB- 50 model and its equivalent in Northern Ireland. It represents the first significant step towards a comprehensive, unified classification of lithodemic units in the UK, to complement well-advanced efforts to produce a full classification of lithostratigraphical units (set out in the BGS Stratigraphical Framework report series). The structure of the classification and the procedure for assigning formal names to intrusive units follow the proposals of Gillespie et al. (2008). In that scheme, 34 different types of individual intrusions and groupings of intrusions are arranged in a hierarchical parent–child association spanning six formal ranks (Figure 1); Rank 1 is taken to be the ‘highest’ and Rank 6 the ‘lowest’. A further eight types of <b>lithodemic</b> <b>unit</b> are used to classify mapped units that consist mainly of intrusive rock but have a ‘mixed’ character, encompassing {{a significant proportion of}} non-intrusive rocks (Figure 1) ...|$|E
40|$|Systematic {{geological}} studies {{performed in}} the study area allowed the characterization of six lithodemic units: three gneissic, one amphibolitic, one supracrustal and one fissure mafic. The mineral assemblage and the structural record of these lithodemic units indicate that the study area was affected by five tectonothermal events. The structural pattern of the first and oldest event occurred under granulite facies conditions and reveals essentially a sinistral kinematic pattern. The second event, showing dominant extensional characteristics, is related to the generation of an ensialic basin filled by the volcano-sedimentary sequence of the supracrustal <b>lithodemic</b> <b>unit.</b> The third event, which is the most expressive in the study region, is characterized by a vigorous regional migmatization process and by the generation of the Claudio Shear Zone, presenting dextral kinematic movement. The fourth event is represented by a fissure mafic magmatism (probably two different mafic dike swarms) and finally, the fifth event is a regional metamorphic re-equilibration that reached the greenschist facies, closing the main processes of the tectonic evolution of the Campo Belo Metamorphic Complex...|$|E
40|$|Lithodemic {{units are}} those mappable {{geological}} units that are defined and delimited primarily by their lithological character, and which lack primary stratification. This report sets out proposals for classifying and naming {{all types of}} <b>lithodemic</b> <b>unit</b> other than intrusions. The units are organised in two hierarchical chains referred to as tectonometamorphic units and mixed-class units. These proposals complete a comprehensive BGS scheme for classifying and naming lithostratigraphical and lithodemic units, which is presented here in four hierarchical chains spanning up to seven ranks (Table 1). Within the scheme, the seven established types of lithostratigraphical unit (NACSN, 1983; Rawson et al., 2002), thirty-four types of intrusive unit (Gillespie et al., 2008), and twelve types of tectonometamorphic unit (this report) are placed in parallel parent–child chains that straddle the same six ranks (Rank 1 to Rank 6). Each of these three hierarchical chains represents a distinct class of mappable unit. Within each chain, parent units embrace children of the same class (i. e. at lower ranks in the same chain), so the units {{in each of these}} three hierarchies are referred to as ‘single-class units’. In the fourth chain (this report), parent units embrace children from two or more of the three hierarchies of single-class units, so the seven types (and four ‘special cases’) of <b>lithodemic</b> <b>unit</b> within it are referred to as mixed-class units. At present, the units in this chain straddle five ranks, one of which is not shared by any of the other chains; additional types of mixed-class unit may be inserted in other ranks of this chain if a need is demonstrated when the scheme is used to classify mapped units. Guidance is given for assigning formal names to tectonometamorphic and mixed-class units. Completion of the scheme means it is now possible to classify and name lithostratigraphical and lithodemic units, separately and in any combination, in any setting, in a systematic and rigorous manner. The general principles of the classification and its associated terminology should apply anywhere in the world. Worked examples span a range of the geological scenarios that may be encountered worldwide, and illustrate how mapped units in various settings and combinations can be classified and named using the proposals set out here. A glossary of the terms proposed here for tectonometamorphic and mixed-class units, and of other terms relevant to these proposals, forms an important part of this document.

40|$|Abstract: Two domains have {{previously}} been {{recognized in the}} Archaean Reguibat Shield of NW Mauritania, based primarily on their gross lithological differences (Rocci et al., 1991). New fieldwork has identified a major ductile shear zone (Tâçarât-Inemmaûdene Shear Zone) separating these domains and new geochronological {{studies show that the}} two domains record different Mesoarchaean histories. As such, the two domains are redefined as the Choum-Rag el Abiod Terrane and Tasiast-Tijirit Terrane. Previous isotopic studies of metamorphic litholo-gies of the eastern Choum-Rag el Abiod Terrane indicate a succession of crustal growth from about 3. 5 - 3. 45 Ga to between about 3. 2 and 2. 99 Ga. Isotopic data presented in this contribu-tion from the Tasiast-Tijirit Terrane indicate that emplacement of major calc-alkaline plutons occurred at c. 2. 93 Ga after volcanism (preserved as greenstone belts) that included late felsic eruptive centres dated at c. 2965 Ma. This Mesoarchaean intrusive and extrusive magmatism was confined to the Tasiast-Tijirit Terrane where it was emplaced through migmatitic or-thogneisses that are the oldest <b>lithodemic</b> <b>unit</b> of the Tasiast-Tijirit Terrane.

The N- to NNE-trending curvilinear Tâçarât -Inemmaûdene Shear Zone that separates the two terranes records late intense transpressive ductile shearing. It has a flower structure over a horizontal distance of about 70 km across its southern portion with unquantifiable sinistral horizontal offset, and east-directed thrusting on its eastern side where it cuts into the Choum-Rag el Abiod Terrane. A new U-Pb zircon age of 2954 ± 11 Ma is presented for a deformed granite confined within the central part of this shear zone. A minimum age for the shearing is provided by a previously determined c. 2. 73 Ga age for a post-tectonic granite that cuts across the easternmost part of the shear zone in the Choum-Rag el Abiod Terrane. ...|$|E
40|$|This report {{sets out}} a {{framework}} and terminology for classifying and naming lithodemic units composed entirely or predominantly of intrusive rock. It {{has been written}} with the geology of the UK in mind, but the principles and definitions recommended here should be applicable globally. The report anticipates a second phase of work, in which a BGS lithodemic classification for onshore intrusions in the UK will be constructed using the recommendations set out here. It is expected that this classification will in future be extended to include other classes of <b>lithodemic</b> <b>unit</b> (highly deformed, highly metamorphosed and ‘mixed’), and lithodemic units in offshore parts of the UK. A hierarchical framework of six formal ranks is proposed. Recommendations are made for classifying lithodemic units within the hierarchy and for constructing formal names for lithodemic units. A comprehensive glossary contains definitions for ‘approved’ lithodemic terms and for other terms associated with lithodemic classification. Some amendments to the existing form for making entries to the BGS Lexicon of Named Rock Units are suggested {{in order to make}} it compatible with some of the special characteristics of lithodemic units. It is proposed that a Lithodemic Framework Committee be established to approve new names for lithodemic units and to oversee management and development of the classification. Examples showing how the proposed classification and nomenclature will work are set out in an Appendix, generally in the form of simplified geological maps accompanied by a ‘classification’ of the illustrated lithodemic units in a hierarchical chain. In anticipation of a second phase of work that will produce a full lithodemic classification, it is proposed that intrusive lithodemic units associated with each of the four major Phanerozoic tectonothermal events to have affected the UK (‘Caledonian’, ‘Variscan’, ‘Carboniferous and Permian’, and ‘Atlantean’) be grouped at the highest formal rank proposed here to create four ‘supersuites’; a brief summary is provided of the salient aspects of each of these four events. ...|$|E

Estudos geológicos sistemáticos permitiram a caracterização de seis unidades litodêmicas na área estudada: três gnáissicas, uma anfibolítica, uma supracrustal e uma máfica fissural. A assembléia mineral e os registros estruturais dessas unidades litodêmicas mostraram que a área estudada foi afetada por cinco eventos tectonotermais. O padrão estrutural do primeiro e último evento ocorreu em condições de fácies granulito e revelaram uma cinemática essencialmente sinistral. O segundo evento mostrou uma tectônica extensional relacionado à abertura da bacia ensiálica onde se alojou a seqüência vulcanosedimentar da unidade supracrustal. O terceiro evento, que é o mais expressivo na região estudada, é o responsável por um intenso processo de migmatização regional e pela geração da Zona de Cisalhamento Cláudio (de cinemática dextral). O quarto evento é representado por um magmatismo máfico fissural (provavelmente dois tipos diferentes de enxames de diques máficos) e, finalmente o quinto evento é um retrometamorfismo regional que atingiu a fácies xisto verde, finalizando os principais processos de evolução tectônica do Complexo Metamórfico Campo Belo...|$|E
