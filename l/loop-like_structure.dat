Ion-kinetic tearing, as proposed by Galeev et al. (1981), is noted to be especially consonant with these observations.

As a secondary vortex loop wraps around a columnar vortex, it becomes entrained into the vortex core due to the self-induced velocity of the loop. The columnar vortex response as a secondary vortex loop moves close to and impacts upon its lateral core surface includes a combination of bending waves, waves of variable core area, and core shape deformation.

40|$|We {{present a}} general {{formulation}} {{for the analysis}} of cool clouds co-rotating around a star which permits us to construct so-called visibility plots which limit the clouds' heights and latitudes. We apply this formalism to the case of neutral hydrogen clouds in the rapidly rotating late-type stars, HK Aqr and AB Dor. We argue that these clouds are most likely confined to equatorial regions and that they exist at a variety of heights above the stellar photosphere, ranging from a few percent of a stellar radius to a few stellar radii. We argue, as a result, that the `coronal condensation' model of Cameron and Robinson (1989 a,b), invoking cloud formation at the co-rotation radius, does not apply to these objects.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the interaction of human erythroctyte band 3 with glycolytic enzymes and to determine the structure of KP 4 toxin by NMR Spectroscopy. ^ A fifteen residue peptide of band 3 (B 3 P) containing the glycolytic enzyme binding region was used in this study. Presented in Chapter 2 were competitive inhibition assays (KI= 52 μM) and stoichiometric measurements performed with B 3 P when complexed with rabbit muscle aldolase. Chapter 3 describes the three-dimensional NMR structure of B 3 P when bound to aldolase determined by utilizing the exchange-transferred nuclear Overhauser effect (ET-NOE). Two major structural components of B 3 P in the bound state are described: a <b>loop-like</b> <b>structure</b> about Tyr 8; a hydrophobic cluster was formed in which the aromatic ring of Tyr 8 was sandwiched between methyl groups of Leu 4 and Met 12. Molecular modeling the bound structure of B 3 P in the active site region of aldolase is presented in Chapter 4. It was shown that the <b>loop-like</b> <b>structure</b> of B 3 P described in Chapter 3 forms a complementary fit both sterically and electrostatically with the bowl-shaped active site of aldolase. Since phosphorylation of Tyr 8 has been shown to disrupt the band 3 :glycolytic enzyme complex, a phosphate was modeled onto Tyr 8 within the B 3 P structure docked in the aldolase active site. The interaction energy was calculated and intramolecular electrostatic repulsion was shown to be the likely cause in disrupting the band 3 :glycolytic enzyme complex. In Chapter 5, aldolase inhibition assays with methoxytyrosyl B 3 P showed that steric repulsion was unlikely to prevent the band 3 :glycoltyic enzyme complex. Furthermore, phosphotyrosyl B 3 P (pB 3 P) was found to be a more potent inhibitor than B 3 P when the opposite was expected. This phenomenon can be explained in Chapter 6 in which evidence for a novel phosphotyrosine binding domain may reside somewhere in the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 and may be important in glycolytic regulation in the red cell. Finally, disulfide bond determination and preliminary NMR structural investigations of KP 4 toxin are described in Chapter 7. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{recently}} reported crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin revealed a cytoplasmic helix (helix 8) {{in addition to}} the seven transmembrane helices. This domain is roughly perpendicular to the transmembrane bundle in the presence of an interface and may be a <b>loop-like</b> <b>structure</b> {{in the absence of an}} interface. Several studies carried out on this domain suggested that it might act as a conformational switch between the inactive and activated states of this G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR). These results raised the question whether helix 8 may be an important feature of other GPCRs as well. To explore this question, we determined the structure of a peptide representing the putative helix 8 domain in another receptor that belongs to the rhodopsin family of GPCRs, the human β 2 adrenergic receptor (hβ 2 AR), using two-dimensional 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The key results from this structural study are that the putative helix 8 domain is helical in detergent and in DMSO while in water this region is disordered; the conformation is therefore dependent upon the environment.

We find twisted magnetic fields emerging frequently to the outer layer, forming arch-like structures. In addition, recurrent plasmoid ejections can be found by looking at space [...] time diagrams of the magnetic field. Recent simulations in spherical coordinates show similar results.

40|$|Context: Spectral {{lines of}} helium are {{commonly}} observed on the Sun. These observations contain important information about physical conditions and He/H abundance variations within solar outer structures. Aims: The modeling of chromospheric and coronal <b>loop-like</b> <b>structures</b> visible in {{hydrogen and helium}} lines {{requires the use of}} appropriate diagnostic tools based on NLTE radiative tranfer in cylindrical geometry. Methods: We use iterative numerical methods to solve the equations of NLTE radiative transfer and statistical equilibrium of atomic level populations. These equations are solved alternatively for hydrogen and helium atoms, using cylindrical coordinates and prescribed solar incident radiation. Electron density is determined by the ionization equilibria of both atoms. Two-dimensional effects are included. Results: The mechanisms of formation of the principal helium lines are analyzed and the sources of emission inside the cylinder are located. The variations of spectral line intensities with temperature, pressure, and helium abundance, are studied. Conclusions: The simultaneous computation of hydrogen and helium lines, performed by the new numerical code, allows the construction of loop models including an extended range of temperatures...|$|R
