40|$|SUMMARY: We {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} parathyroid hormone (PTH), pamidronate, or renutrition on osseointegration of titanium implants in the proximal tibia of rats subject to prolonged <b>low-protein</b> <b>diets.</b> PTH improved mechanical fixation, microarchitecture, and increased pull-out strength. Pamidronate or renutrition had lesser effects. PTH can thus improve implant osseointegration in protein-malnourished rats. INTRODUCTION: Protein malnutrition impairs implant osseointegration in rats. PTH and pamidronate prevent deleterious effects of protein restriction introduced just prior to implantation. Whether these treatments improve osseointegration after chronic protein deprivation, i. e., in osteopenic bone at time of implantation, is unknown. We evaluated effects of PTH, pamidronate, or renutrition on resistance to pull-out of titanium rods implanted into the rat tibiae following isocaloric low-protein intake. METHODS: Forty-one adult female rats received normal or isocaloric <b>low-protein</b> <b>diets.</b> Six weeks later, implants were surgically inserted into proximal tibiae. Following implantation, rats on <b>low-protein</b> <b>diets</b> were treated with PTH (1 - 34), pamidronate, saline vehicle, or normal protein diets, for another 8 weeks. Tibiae were removed for micro-computerised tomographic morphometry and evaluation of pull-out strength. RESULTS: Pull-out strength decreased in rats on isocaloric <b>low-protein</b> <b>diets</b> compared with normal protein group (- 33. 4 %). PTH increased pull-out strength in low-protein group, even compared to controls from the normal protein group. PTH and pamidronate increased bone volume/tissue volume, bone-to-implant contact, and trabecular thickness, whilst trabecular separation was reduced, with a shift to more plate-like bone surrounding the implants. CONCLUSIONS: PTH reversed the deleterious effects of long-term protein undernutrition on mechanical fixation and bone microarchitecture and improved implant osseointegration more than pamidronate or renutrition, likely through changes to structure model index...|$|R

40|$|Beneficial {{responses}} to modified diets in treating {{patients with chronic}} kidney disease. BackgroundIn rats, protein-restricted diets prolong survival from experimental chronic kidney disease (CKD). Diets for CKD patients that are restricted in protein and modified to limit the intake of phosphates and sodium not only reduce the accumulation of unexcreted metabolic products but also protect against hypertension and proteinuria. Their ability to slow progression of CKD is controversial, and this fact, plus concern about the nutritional adequacy of restricted diets, has limited this treatment strategy for CKD patients. MethodsExpected responses of CKD patients to dietary manipulation are examined. The influence of this strategy on complications of CKD, including results from the MDRD Study, is analyzed. ResultsDietary compliance with <b>low-protein</b> <b>diets</b> can be monitored from 24 -hour urea excretion. Long-term therapy with diets containing 0. 6 g protein/kg/day or less protein supplemented with essential amino acids or their ketoanalogues maintain body weight and normal values of serum proteins while reducing the accumulation of acid, phosphates, urea. <b>Low-protein</b> <b>diets</b> suppress proteinuria even when angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are used. Patients in the MDRD Study who complied with the diet had a significant slowing of the rate of loss of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). ConclusionSuccessful dietary manipulation can ameliorate many complications of CKD. <b>Low-protein</b> <b>diets</b> are nutritionally safe, they reduce the accumulation of metabolic products, and they can suppress progressive loss of kidney function. Dietary manipulation should {{be an integral part}} of the therapy for patients with progressive CKD...|$|R
50|$|A <b>low-protein</b> <b>diet</b> is a diet {{in which}} people reduce their intake of protein.

Low protein consumption appears to alter the risk of bone breakage, presumably through changes in calcium homeostasis. Consequently, there is no uniform definition of what constitutes low-protein, because the amount and composition of protein for an individual suffering from phenylketonuria would differ substantially from one suffering homocystinuria. The amount used by those with liver disease would still result in individuals being in nitrogen balance.|$|E

Total activity was decreased in liver by 9 %- or 0 %-casein diets and by 48 h starvation, but not by alloxan-diabetes. Total activities were unchanged in kidney and heart. The amount of active form of the complex (in unit/g wet wt. and as % of total) in tissues of normal rats fed on standard diet was: liver, 0. 45, 55 %; kidney, 0. 55, 71 %; heart, 0. 03, 5 %; skeletal muscle less than 0. 007, less than 20 % (below lower limit of assay). The concentration of the active form of the complex was decreased in liver and kidney, but not in heart, by <b>low-protein</b> <b>diets,</b> 48 h starvation and alloxan-diabetes.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Western diets, which {{typically}} contain {{large amounts of}} energy-dense processed foods, together with a sedentary lifestyle are associated with increased cardiometabolic risk. We evaluated {{the long-term effects of}} consuming a low-calorie <b>low-protein</b> vegan <b>diet</b> or performing regular endurance exercise on cardiometabolic risk factors. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, cardiometabolic risk factors were evaluated in 21 sedentary subjects, who had been on a low-calorie <b>low-protein</b> raw vegan <b>diet</b> for 4. 4 +/- 2. 8 years, (mean age, 53. 1 +/- 11 yrs), 21 body mass index (BMI) -matched endurance runners consuming Western diets, and 21 age- and gender-matched sedentary subjects, consuming Western diets. RESULTS: BMI was lower in the low-calorie <b>low-protein</b> vegan <b>diet</b> (21. 3 +/- 3. 1 kg/m(2)) and endurance runner (21. 1 +/- 1. 6 kg/m(2)) groups than in the sedentary Western diet group (26. 5 +/- 2. 7 kg/m(2)) (p < 0. 005). Plasma concentrations of lipids, lipoproteins, glucose, insulin, C-reactive protein, blood pressure (BP), and carotid artery intima-media thickness were lower in the low-calorie <b>low-protein</b> vegan <b>diet</b> and runner groups than in the Western diet group (all p < 0. 05). Both systolic and diastolic BP were lower in the low-calorie <b>low-protein</b> vegan <b>diet</b> group (104 +/- 15 and 62 +/- 11 mm Hg) than in BMI-matched endurance runners (122 +/- 13 and 72 +/- 9 mmHg) and Western diet group (132 +/- 14 and 79 +/- 8 mm Hg) (p < 0. 001); BP values were directly associated with sodium intake and inversely associated with potassium and fiber intake. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term consumption of a low-calorie <b>low-protein</b> vegan <b>diet</b> or regular endurance exercise training is associated with low cardiometabolic risk. Moreover, our data suggest that specific components of a low-calorie <b>low-protein</b> vegan <b>diet</b> provide additional beneficial effects on blood pressure...|$|R
