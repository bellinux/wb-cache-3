50|$|A park by wire system {{engages the}} parking pawl of a {{transmission}} using electrical means. This {{can also be}} considered as part of a shift by wire system whose objective is to put the vehicle in Park, Reverse, Neutral and Drive modes without the traditional mechanical system which involves linkages between the gear shifter and the transmission. The main components of a park by wire system include the driver interface which could be a <b>lever,</b> <b>switch</b> or knob as designed by the OEM (input), an electronic control unit to host the control system and actuators (one or two motors) which are capable of driving the parking pawl {{into and out of the}} locking position with the parking gear of the transmission.|$|E

5000|$|The Focus {{was one of}} Kramer's first models {{manufactured}} {{and then}} imported from Japan. There were three superstrat-styled models, all of which featured the popular Floyd Rose tremolo. The Focus 1000 sported a single slanted humbucker, similar to the Kramer Baretta. The 2000 sported two humbuckers, thus resembling a Kramer Pacer Imperial. The [...] "'3000'" [...] sported a HSS configuration on a Fender Stratocaster-type pickguard. The 6000 sported a HSS configuration, like the Kramer Pacer. earlier 6000 configurations had 3 individual switches for pickup switching, in 1988 Kramer switched to a regular 5-way <b>lever</b> <b>switch.</b> The other two guitars both sported two humbuckers and a Floyd Rose and were distinguished by body shape. The 4000 sported a Gibson Flying V shape, and was later changed to more closely resemble a Jackson Randy Rhoads or Kramer Vanguard. The 5000 model resembles the Kramer Voyager, and also came with a triple humbucker configuration. There were also three basses in the line. The 77 featured a split pickup, while the 88 featured a full-size humbucker. The 8000 has a Z shape, resembling the Kramer Condor bass, and features two split pickups.|$|E
40|$|An {{immersive}} {{virtual environment}} {{is the ideal}} platform for the planning and training of on-orbit servicing missions, as it provides a flexible and safe environment. In such kind of virtual assembly simulation, grasping virtual objects {{is one of the}} most common and natural interactions. However, unlike grasping objects in the real world, it is a non-trivial task in virtual environments, where the primary feedback is visual only. A lot of research investigated ways to provide haptic feedback, such as force, vibrational and electrotactile feedback. Such devices, however, are usually uncomfortable and hard to integrate in projection-based immersive YR systems. In this paper, we present a novel, small and lightweight electro-tactile feedback device, specifically designed for immersive virtual environments. It consists of a small tactor with eight electrodes for each finger and a signal generator attached to the user's hand or arm. Our device can be easily integrated with an existing optical finger tracking system. The study presented in this paper assesses the feasibility and usability of the interaction device. An experiment was conducted in a repeated measures design using the electrotactile feedback modality as independent variable. As benchmark, we chose three typical assembly tasks of a YR simulation for satellite on-orbit servicing missions, including pressing a button, switching a <b>lever</b> <b>switch,</b> and pulling a module from its slot. Results show that electrotactile feedback improved the user's grasping in our virtual on-orbit servicing scenario. The task completion time was significantly lower for all three tasks and the precision of the user's interaction was higher. The workload reported by the participants was significantly lower when using electrotactile feedback. Additionally, users were more confident with their performance while completing the tasks with electrotactile feedback. We describe the device, outline the user study and report the results...|$|E

5000|$|Starting {{with the}} 2008 model year, U.S. {{government}} regulations required automakers to install power window controls {{that are less}} likely to be accidentally activated by children. However, the rules do not prevent all potential injuries to a hand, finger, or even a child's head, if someone deliberately holds the switch when the window is closing. In 2009, the U.S. auto safety administration tentatively decided against requiring all cars to have automatic reversing power windows if they sense an obstruction while closing. Proposed requirements concern [...] "one-touch" [...] up window systems, but most vehicles with this feature already have automatic-reversing. The federal government made a written contract that all automakers should make the <b>lever</b> <b>switches</b> (as opposed to the rocker and toggle switches) standard on all new vehicles by 1 October 2010.|$|R

50|$|The Magister was {{typically}} outfitted with avionics such as {{very high frequency}} (VHF) radio systems, Lear radio compass, and intercom; all cockpit electronics conformed to NATO accessibility standards. It was not provided with ejector seats in standard, but the fitting of various units {{was considered to be}} available upon request. The assorted <b>levers,</b> <b>switches</b> and dials that comprised the cockpit displays were typically easily observable, while ample room was provided for pilot comfortable and space to accommodate a parachute. The standard blind panel is ahead of each pilot, and engine instruments are set to the left, while underneath these are the flap indicator, flap switch and emergency selectors, along with the two throttles and fuel cocks; the right forward bench carries the radio panel, and to the extreme right of that are the armament controls. The cockpit was pressurization as well as being provisioned with a fresh air system.|$|R

50|$|Otto engines were {{equipped}} {{with a number of}} different mechanism designs to trigger sparking. The Otto {{is one of the first}} engines to use a spark plug, which is a device that produces a small electric spark to ignite the fuel charge. This usually consisted of a pivoting trip-arm that briefly grabs a power <b>switch</b> <b>lever</b> and gives it a quick pull. The <b>switch</b> <b>lever</b> is then released and allowed to snap back to its original position in preparation for the next cycle. This system requires an external electric battery, ignition coil, and electric charging system similar to modern automobile engines.|$|R
50|$|While operationally {{identical}} (in {{terms of}} one-handed opening), the spring-assisted knife has slight but important differences. A switchblade opens its blade from the handle automatically {{with the press}} of a button, <b>lever,</b> or <b>switch</b> that is remotely mounted in the knife handle or bolster. In contrast, a spring-assist design uses manual pressure on a <b>lever</b> or <b>switch</b> mounted on the blade or connected via a direct mechanical linkage to open the blade initially, at which point an internal torsion spring propels the blade into an open, locked position. Still other types of one-hand opening knives rely {{on the use of}} a manual protrusion on the blade itself to 'flick' the knife open using a thumb or forefinger, without any spring assistance. Since all these knives can be rapidly opened with one hand, the logic and utility of 1950s-era prohibitions against a subcategory of one-hand opening knives like the switchblade have been called into question by knife rights advocacy groups. In recent years, several U.S. states have repealed laws prohibiting the purchase or possession of automatic knives in their entirety.|$|R
50|$|Vehicles that {{generate}} power with an {{internal combustion engine}} (ICE) are generally equipped with a transmission or gearbox to change the speed-torque ratio and the direction of travel. This does not usually apply to electric vehicles because their motors can drive the vehicle both forward and backward from zero speed. In some four-wheel drive vehicles there is a gear lever that engages a low-ratio gearbox. Other <b>levers</b> may <b>switch</b> between two- and four-wheel drive and differential locks.|$|R
50|$|A {{ballistic}} knife is a {{knife with}} a detachable blade {{that can be}} ejected to a distance of several yards by pressing a trigger or operating a <b>lever</b> or <b>switch</b> on the handle. Spring-powered ballistic knives briefly gained notoriety in the United States in the mid-1980s after commercial examples were marketed and sold in the United States and other Western countries. Since then, the marketing and sale of ballistic knives to civilians has been restricted or prohibited by law in several countries.|$|R
40|$|Lever {{pressing}} by 2 squirrel monkeys {{was maintained}} under fixed-interval 6 -min and fixed-interval 2 -min schedules of electric-shock presentation. Preference for these schedules was assessed during three experimental phases. In all phases, responses on one lever produced shock {{according to one}} or the other fixed-interval schedule, and responses on a second, changeover, <b>lever</b> <b>switched</b> between schedules. The opportunity to change over was presented during separate choice periods (during which the fixed-interval schedules did not operate) that followed the first through fourth shocks in each schedule. If no changeover occurred during those choice periods, a changeover automatically occurred following the fifth shock. In Phase I, durations of the choice periods were fixed. In Phase II, the choice periods equaled a proportion of their respective fixed interval. During Phase III (completed with 1 monkey) a response on the changeover lever during a given choice period reinstated the most recent fixed interval, and a failure to respond resulted in a changeover. During each of these phases, distinct preferences developed for the 6 -min schedule. These results suggest that the maintenance of lever pressing by fixed-interval presentation of electric shock may not be an example of positive reinforcement, and that the response-maintaining characteristics of shock presentation may derive from other properties of the schedule...|$|R
40|$|Residues 61 - 95 of the non-amyloid {{component}} (NAC(61 - 95)) {{domain of}} alpha-synuclein {{are responsible for}} the aggregation and neurotoxicity of this protein. This study evaluated the effect of N-(omega) -nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, on the behavior of rats bilaterally injected into the CA 3 area of the dorsal hippocampus with aggregated NAC(61 - 95). Twenty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to respond under an alternating-lever cyclic-ratio (ALCR) operant schedule. When responding was stable, 12 rats were injected bilaterally into the CA 3 area of the hippocampus with aggregated NAC(61 - 95) (5 mu l per side; concentration 10 (- 4) M), the remaining 12 rats were similarly injected with sterile water (SW), six of the NAC(61 - 95) injected rats and six of the SW injected rats were treated for 90 days post-injections with 0. 05 mg/ml L-NAME in drinking water available ad libitum. Treatment with L-NAME alleviated NAC(61 - 95) -induced behavioral deficits, indicated through the measurement of <b>lever</b> <b>switching</b> errors and incorrect lever perseverations under the ALCR schedule, and reduced the number of activated astrocytes proximal to the injection sites.
