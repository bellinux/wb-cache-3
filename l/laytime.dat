50|$|In {{commercial}} ship chartering, demurrage is an ancillary {{cost that}} represents liquidated damages for delays. It {{occurs when the}} vessel is prevented from loading or discharging cargo within the stipulated <b>laytime</b> (see Affreightment: under Charter-parties). In the oil industry, {{it refers to the}} excess time taken to discharge or load What the case may be in excess of the allowed <b>laytime.</b> <b>Laytime</b> is the term used to quantify the time allowed within which an operation is allowed to be made. Demurrage is <b>laytime</b> consumed less <b>laytime</b> allocated (if any). The master of the ship must give a Notice of Readiness (NOR) to the charterer when the ship has arrived at the port of loading or discharge. The NOR informs the charterer that the ship is ready to load or discharge. The date and time of the NOR determines when <b>laytime</b> is to commence.|$|E
50|$|In {{commercial}} shipping, <b>laytime</b> is {{the amount}} of time allowed (in hours or days) in a voyage charter for the loading and unloading of cargo. If the <b>laytime</b> is exceeded, demurrage is incurred. If the whole period of <b>laytime</b> is not needed, despatch may be payable by the shipowner to the charterer, depending on the terms of the charter party (despatch does not apply to tanker charters).|$|E
50|$|A {{voyage charter}} is {{the hiring of}} a vessel and crew for a voyage between a load port and a {{discharge}} port. The charterer pays the vessel owner on a per-ton or lump-sum basis. The owner pays the port costs (excluding stevedoring), fuel costs and crew costs. The payment {{for the use of}} the vessel is known as freight. A voyage charter specifies a period, known as <b>laytime,</b> for loading and unloading the cargo. If <b>laytime</b> is exceeded, the charterer must pay demurrage. If <b>laytime</b> is saved, the charter party may require the shipowner to pay despatch to the charterer.|$|E
50|$|The {{reverse of}} {{demurrage}} is despatch. If the charterer requires {{the use of}} the vessel for less time than the <b>laytime</b> allowed, the charter party may require the shipowner to pay despatch for the time saved.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "demurrage" [...] from Old French demeurage, from demeurer - to linger, tarry - {{originated}} in vessel chartering {{and referred to}} the period when the charterer remained in possession of the vessel after the period normally allowed to load and unload cargo (<b>laytime).</b> By extension, demurrage refers to the charges that the shipowner pays to the charterer for its delayed operations of loading/unloading. Officially, demurrage {{is a form of}} liquidated damages for breaching the <b>laytime</b> as a it is stated in the governing contract (the charter party). The demurrage sometimes causes a loss to the seller as it increases cost of the total freight.|$|E
50|$|The {{point when}} <b>laytime</b> commences is {{determined}} by a Notice of Readiness (NOR), which the master or agent of the ship must give to the charterer when the ship has arrived {{at the port of}} loading or discharge. The NOR informs the charterer that the ship has arrived at the port and is ready in all respects to load or discharge.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} {{the stay}} in port, the port agent draws up a Statement of Facts, setting out a log of events during the ship's stay in port. The Statement of Facts enables a time sheet to be drawn up and signed by the master and the shipper or {{receiver}} of the cargo. The time sheet enables <b>laytime</b> and therefore demurrage or despatch to be calculated.|$|E
50|$|<b>Laytime</b> and laydays {{are often}} {{confused}} as {{referring to the}} same idea. Laydays refers {{to the time when}} a ship must present itself to the charterer. If the ship arrives before the laydays specified, the charterer does not have to take control or start loading (depending on the type of charter). If the ship arrives after the laydays, then the contract can be cancelled - hence laydays are often presented as the term Laydays and Cancelling and can be shortened to Laycan.|$|E

40|$|A {{great deal}} of trouble is taken, by {{draftsman}} of voyage charterparties, to apportion risks of delay between owners and charterers at loading and discharge. Care must be taken over the commencement of <b>laytime,</b> {{the circumstances in which}} notice of readiness can be tendered, and exceptions and interruptions to <b>laytime</b> and demurrage. The complexities of demurrage alone have been judicially described as 'hideous': and no doubt the same sentiments can equally apply to <b>laytime.</b> This careful apportionment of delay risk can be entirely upset if the delay occurs before <b>laytime</b> is triggered. If charterers are held to have committed a breach of an independent term, preventing the <b>laytime</b> from running, damages will be for detention and neither layime nor demurrage provisions will be triggered. Charterers will lose the benefit of their <b>laytime,</b> and neither side will enjoy the convenience of the liquidated damages provided by the demurrage regime. This article considers two problems in this regard which could arise from recent decisions of the courts; first, the widening of safe port and safe berth obligations to encompass delay, and secondly, the implication of such terms into charterparties. Whatever view may be taken of these developments generally, neither is desirable in the contect of careful risk apportionment. To date, the courts have to some extent embraced the first, while fortunately restricting the second...|$|E

40|$|This {{report is}} aimed to {{investigate}} the ISPS-code and voyage chartering, and investigate how the code affects the charterer and owner. The SOLAS convention was amended in 2004 {{as a result of}} the new terror threat, and the ISPS-code was then added to the convention as an annex. The new code affects different parties involved in voyage chartering, and everyone has to adapt to the new routines. Furthermore, some parts of voyage chartering are more vulnerable than others. <b>Laytime</b> is an essential part of a ships voyage, and a vast amount of money is linked to a vessel’s portstay. A violation of the ISPS-code allows the designated authorities in charge of maintaining the protection of ships and port to intervene and investigate the cause of non-compliance during the vessels portstay. Thus, the <b>laytime</b> can be directly affected by the ISPS-code. The question is who is responsible for the delays and in turn the economic risk of an ISPS related delay or cancellation of voyage? As a result of our investigation, we concluded that the ISPS-code is related to the seaworthiness of a vessel. If the obligations of the security requirements are not met, the vessel can be classified as non-seaworthy. In most voyage charterparties, such as GENCON 94, there is a clause that states that the owner shall provide a seaworthy ship. In English jurisdiction, the owner’s responsibilities to provide a seaworthy ship is even a so called implied term. Hence, a breach of the ISPS-code is directly linked to the seaworthiness of the ship, and the owner is responsible for the delays caused by lack of ISPS documents and certificates...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} major {{shipping}} companies which operate fleets comprised largely of vessels which are time chartered and subsequently sub-chartered on voyage terms. Legal risks will arise {{for the time}} charterer due the differing natures and terms of time and voyage charters. The essential question examined in this thesis is that of whether, and to what extent, legal risk can be minimized by the negotiation of equivalent contractual terms under time and voyage charter parties. The key areas addressed in this thesis are delivery under time charters compared to readiness under voyage charters, off hire under time charters versus suspension of <b>laytime</b> under voyage charters, obligations relating to cleanliness of cargo spaces, rights and responsibilities relative to safe berths and ports, the time charterer's position under bills of lading, and issues relating to redelivery of the vessel and consequent voyage charter liability if the vessel is unable to undertake the final voyage. The methodology applied is {{an examination of the}} case law, with a primary focus on the extensive body of English jurisprudence. This analysis of the case law is accompanied by a consideration of provisions of major charter party forms. The analysis leads to the conclusion that risk, to varying degrees, can be minimized through the application and clarification of contractual language. With respect to readiness of the vessel it is considered that risk will be reduced through agreeing contractual language which requires early notification of the vessel's delay. As regards off hire and <b>laytime</b> wording that clarifies non physical deficiencies is proposed. With regard to vessel cargo spaces intermediate cleanliness is identified as the greatest risk. Safe port and berth warranties are determined to represent an area of easily manageable risk, while letters of indemnity relating to bills of lading continue to represent very significant risk with suggested but no certain solution. Finally, with respect to redelivery a final voyage clause for time charters has been proposed which serves to almost eliminate risk in this area. Therefore, it is broadly concluded that risk can be managed but not eliminated through drafting of appropriate contractual terms...|$|E
40|$|The {{main issue}} in Profindo Pte Ltd v Abani Trading Pte Ltd, 1 a {{decision}} of the Singapore High Court, was the interpretation of a provision in a CFR sale contract providing for a discharge rate, and demurrage if the time for discharge was exceeded. There were side issues on the damages that could be awarded for breach by the buyer of the provision, and a counterclaim by the buyers regarding a small shortfall in the cargo discharged. The main issue, and the counterclaim, were heavily influenced {{by the time of}} transfer of risk in a CFR contract. The CFR contract was accepted as a variation of CIF, “and … {{the differences between the two}} types of contract are not material for the purposes of this appeal”. 2 Under a CIF contract the seller is responsible for making the carriage contract. If he charters a ship to carry the goods, he will in principle become liable under the charterparty for demurrage, whether incurred at loading or discharge. 3 It is the buyer, however, who typically controls the discharge process, 4 and sellers need to guard against incurring liability for delays which are beyond their control. The main issue in Profindo concerned an attempt by the seller to guard against just such a contingency, by the insertion of (in effect) <b>laytime</b> and demurrage terms into the CFR sale contract. It should be observed, in passing, that similar problems can arise for FOB buyers who charter vessels to lift their goods, the need now being to protect against sellers delaying the vessel at the loading port. 5 The problem is less acute in the FOB context, since, even without <b>laytime</b> and demurrage provisions, FOB buyers are to some extent protected from 1. [2013] SGHC 10 (District Court Appeal No 5 of 2012). 2. [2013] SGHC 10, [4] 3. He can also become liable if he ships on bill of lading terms. If he is a time charterer there is obviously no demurrage liability, but he will still have an interest in timely discharge. In Profindo, the sellers had chartered MV Athens for the voyage. 4. Or, if there is a chain, the ultimate receiver of the cargo. In any event, the original seller/charterer does not. 5. Assuming that this is a variant of FOB where the buyer is shippe...|$|E
