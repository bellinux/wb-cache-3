5000|$|As of 1985, trim {{levels that}} were offered were the MG, ME, and ME-R for the sedan. Earlier trim {{packages}} were the VXR, VX, and VL, all using the CVCC-II induction setup. Honda's {{fuel injection system}} was offered on the VTL-i, and VT-i. As the hatchback continued to be manufactured as an Accord only, the Vigor hatchback was available with the trim packages MX-T, and the ME-T until it {{was replaced by the}} Honda Integra 2-door hatchback in 1984. Earlier trim packages for the Vigor hatchback were the TXL, TX, and TU using the carburetor, and the TT-i with fuel injection.

5000|$|In its {{redesign}} for the 1990 model year, Lincoln stylists {{sought a}} completely new design for the Town Car. To bring the Town Car into the 1990s, many traditional Lincoln styling cues were heavily reworked or abandoned completely. Although the Town Car would keep its formal notchback sedan roofline, the flat-sided fenders and angular lines seen since the Continentals and Mark IIIs of the late 1960s disappeared. In their quest to give the Town Car a more aerodynamic body than its predecessor, stylists trimming its drag coefficient from 0.46 to 0.36 (matching the 1988 Continental and besting the Mark VII). [...] While far sleeker than its 1980s counterpart, the 1990 Town Car retained several styling influences, including its vertical taillights, radiator-style grille, hood ornament, alloy wheels, and vertical C-pillar window. In a move to market the Town Car towards buyers of contemporary vehicles, several other changes were made. Although two-tone paint remained available (featuring a lower body accent color in gray metallic), monotone paint schemes would become increasingly standard. In a major change, a vinyl roof was no longer offered, since vinyl roofs declined in popularity among many buyers.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{photometric}} study of I-band {{variability in the}} young cluster IC 348. The main {{purpose of the study}} was to identify periodic stars. In all we find 50 periodic stars, of which 32 were previously unknown. For the first time in IC 348, we discover periods in significant numbers of lower-mass stars (M 0. 25 M⊙) showing a bi-modal period distribution concentrated around periods of 2 and 8 days, and the lower-mass stars showing a uni-modal distribution, heavily biassed towards fast rotators. Closer inspection of the period distribution shows that the higher mass stars show a significant dearth of fast rotators, compared to the Orion Nebula Cluster, whilst the low mass stars are rotating significantly faster than those in Orion. We find no correlation between rotation period and K − L colour or Hα equivalent width. We also present a discussion of our own IC 348 data in the context of previously published period distributions for the Orion Nebula Cluster, the Orion Flanking Fields and NGC 2264. We find that the previously claimed correlation between infrared excess and rotation period in the ONC might in fact result from a correlation between infrared excess and mass. We also find a marked difference in period distributions between NGC 2264 and IC 348, which presents a serious challenge to the <b>disc</b> <b>locking</b> paradigm, given the similarity in ages and disc fractions between the two clusters.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{photometric}} study of I-band {{variability in the}} young association Cepheus OB 3 b. The study is sensitive to periodic variability on time-scales of less than a day, to more than 20 d. After rejection of contaminating objects using V, I, R and narrow-band Hα photometry, we find 475 objects with measured rotation periods, which are very likely pre-main-sequence members of the Cep OB 3 b star-forming region. We revise the distance and age to Cep OB 3 b, putting it on the self-consistent age and distance ladder of Mayne & Naylor. This yields a distance modulus of 8. 8 ± 0. 2 mag, corresponding to a distance of 580 ± 60 pc, and an age of 4 – 5 Myr. The rotation period distribution confirms the general picture of rotational evolution in young stars, exhibiting both the correlation between accretion (determined in this case through narrow-band Hα photometry) and rotation expected from <b>disc</b> <b>locking,</b> and the dependence of rotation upon mass that is seen in other star-forming regions. However, this mass dependence is much weaker in our data than found in other studies. Comparison to the similarly aged NGC 2362 shows that the low-mass stars in Cep OB 3 b are rotating much more slowly. This points to a possible link between star-forming environment and rotation properties. Such a link would call into question models of stellar angular momentum evolution, which assume that the rotational period distributions of young clusters and associations can be assembled into an evolutionary sequence, thus ignoring environmental effects...|$|R
40|$|I examine {{some of the}} {{dynamical}} interactions which {{occur in}} stellar clusters. I examine how a population of brown dwarfs will evolve within a cluster, {{in an attempt to}} explain the discrepancy between observational results and theoretical models regarding the number of brown dwarfs in a stellar cluster. I find that {{it is unlikely that the}} entire brown dwarf population could be expelled from the cluster in less than many dynamical relaxation times. Instead I propose that it is likely that the majority of the brown dwarfs are instead in binary systems with brighter companions which hide them from view. I have also modeled the formation of blue stragglers through the collision of two main-sequence stars. I propose that the angular momentum problem that other authors have found with blue stragglers formed via off-axis collisions can be resolved by considering the angular momentum loss associated with a stellar wind or <b>locking</b> to a <b>disc.</b> I show that both can quickly reduce the angular momentum of the merged object to the point where it can contract down to the main-sequence. I have examined the possibility of explaining the apparent paucity of red giants in the cores of post-core-collapse globular clusters through collisions with binary systems and with single stars. I show that such collisions often result in a bound system, where the red giant envelope acts as a common envelope and is eventually dispersed. I also show that such collisions can remove up to 17 % of the red giant population...|$|R
40|$|We {{formulate}} a general, steady-state {{model for the}} torque on a magnetized star from a surrounding accretion disc. For the first time, we include the opening of dipolar magnetic field lines due to the differential rotation between the star and disc, so the magnetic topology then depends {{on the strength of}} the magnetic coupling to the disc. This coupling is determined by the effective slip rate of magnetic field lines that penetrate the diffusive disc. Stronger coupling (i. e., lower slip rate) leads to a more open topology and thus to a weaker magnetic torque on the star from the disc. In the expected strong coupling regime, we find that the spin-down torque on the star is more than an order of magnitude smaller than calculated by previous models. We also use our general approach to examine the equilibrium (`disc-locked') state, in which the net torque on the star is zero. In this state, we show that the stellar spin rate is roughly an order of magnitude faster than predicted by previous models. This challenges the idea that slowly-rotating, accreting protostars are <b>disc</b> <b>locked.</b> Furthermore, when the field is sufficiently open (e. g., for mass accretion rates > 5 x 10 ^{- 9 } M_sun / yr, for typical accreting protostars), the star will receive no magnetic spin-down torque from the disc at all. We therefore conclude that protostars must experience a spin-down torque from a source that has not yet been considered in the star-disc torque models [...] possibly from a stellar wind along the open field lines.
