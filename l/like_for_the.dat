5|$|Despite {{the change}} in {{electron}} configuration, unbiunium {{is not expected to}} behave chemically very differently from its lighter congeners. A 2016 calculation on unbiunium monofluoride (UbuF) showed similarities between the valence orbitals of unbiunium in this molecule and those of actinium in actinium monofluoride (AcF); in both molecules, the highest occupied molecular orbital is expected to be nonbonding, unlike in the superficially more similar nihonium monofluoride (NhF) where it is bonding. Nihonium has the electron configuration 5f146d107s27p1, with an s2p valence configuration. Unbiunium may hence be somewhat like lawrencium in having an anomalous s2p configuration from relativistic effects that does not affect its chemistry: the bond dissociation energies, bond lengths, and polarisabilities of the UbuF molecule are expected to continue the trend down group 3. Hence lawrencium and unbiunium are expected to be similar to lutetium and actinium respectively, and not thallium and nihonium as would be expected from looking at their electron configurations. The Ubu–F bond is expected to be strong and polarised, just <b>like</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> lighter group 3 monofluorides.|$|E

40|$|Ready-to-drinks (RTDs) are {{composed}} of an alcoholic component and a soft-drink base and are primarily consumed by a youth market. The authors explored whether liking and experience with an RTD soft-drink base predicts <b>liking</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> RTD. Participants (N = 350) from ages 12 to 30 years sampled 3 RTDs and their respective soft-drink and alcoholic components. For milk- and fruit-based RTDs, <b>liking</b> <b>for</b> and familiarity with their soft-drink base was {{the best predictor of}} <b>liking</b> <b>for</b> and familiarity with <b>the</b> RTD itself. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> Coke-based RTD, familiarity with and <b>liking</b> <b>for</b> bourbon best predicted familiarity with and <b>liking</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> RTD. All of these effects were consistent across blind and nonblind testing. The authors' results suggest that where there is perceptual similarity between the RTD and its soft-drink base, these beverages may provide an easy transition into alcohol consumption for novice drinkers. 6 page(s...|$|R
25|$|Similar to the {{submarines}} scandal, {{but much}} less talked about, Portas was {{also responsible for}} the acquisition of 260 Pandur armoured combat vehicles for 364 million euros when he was Minister of Defence. He signed the contract during his final days in office, and, <b>like</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> submarines, it included a vague counterparts provision for the manufacturer to spend 516 million euros on Portuguese merchandises and investments. However, at least 400 million euros of those counterparts expired unused and the few investments made allegedly benefited a personal friend of Portas. In addition, there were major mechanical problems with the first batches of Pandur vehicles delivered and a subsequent Minister of Defence cancelled {{the balance of the}} purchase. As in the submarines' scandal, Paulo Portas has not been shown to have committed any illegalities, but there were major suspicions and an official criminal investigation was launched in 2010 and in 2016 Portas was referenced (but not accused) in the context of that investigation.|$|E

Greenwood said, [...] "I got very excited {{at the prospect of}} doing string parts that didn't sound like 'Eleanor Rigby', which is what all string parts have sounded <b>like</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> past 30 years." [...] Select described Yorke's distraught vocals and the atonal strings as [...] "Thom's voice dissolving into a fearful, blood-clotted scream as Jonny whips the sound of a million dying elephants into a crescendo."

500|$|Philosophers who {{consider}} subjective experience {{the essence of}} consciousness also generally believe, as a correlate, that the existence and nature of animal consciousness can never rigorously be known. Thomas Nagel spelled out {{this point of view}} in an influential essay titled What Is it Like to Be a Bat?. [...] He said that an organism is conscious [...] "if and only if there is something that {{it is like to be}} that organism — something it is <b>like</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> organism"; and he argued that no matter how much we know about an animal's brain and behavior, we can never really put ourselves into the mind of the animal and experience its world in the way it does itself. [...] Other thinkers, such as Douglas Hofstadter, dismiss this argument as incoherent. [...] Several psychologists and ethologists have argued for the existence of animal consciousness by describing a range of behaviors that appear to show animals holding beliefs about things they cannot directly perceive — Donald Griffin's 2001 book Animal Minds reviews a substantial portion of the evidence.|$|E
