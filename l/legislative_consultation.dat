60|$|I {{have reason}} to believe that every {{practicable}} exertion has been made (pursuant to the provision by law for that purpose) to be prepared for the alternative of a prosecution of the war {{in the event of a}} failure of pacific overtures. A large proportion of the troops authorized to be raised have been recruited, though the number is still incomplete, and pains have been taken to discipline and put them in condition for the particular kind of service to be performed. A delay of operations (besides being dictated by the measures which were pursuing toward a pacific termination of the war) has been in itself deemed preferable to immature efforts. A statement from the proper department with regard to the number of troops raised, and some other points which have been suggested, will afford more precise information as a guide to the <b>legislative</b> <b>consultations,</b> and among other things will enable Congress to judge whether some additional stimulus to the recruiting service may not be advisable.|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{increased}} use of stakeholder consultations, little is known about their impact on the legislative process. We examine how consultation of external actors during policy preparation affects decision making duration and efficiency. We test our predictions on EU legislative decision making and we find that whereas stakeholder consultations in policy preparation may increase the democratic legitimacy of decision making, they result in efficiency losses in the subsequent legislative processes. Hence, rather than smoothing the way for quick <b>legislative</b> reconciliation, <b>consultations</b> increase the transaction costs of subsequent bargaining by prolonging the time needed to form the necessary coalitions and reach legislative deals. However, despite the proliferation of different tools for involving external actors, we find no differences in legislative speed between open and restricted consultations...|$|R

40|$|This chapter was {{prepared}} for the New Zealand Law Society {{for the purpose of}} a Continuing Legal Education course on the Marine Coastal Area Act 2011 (“MCAA”). The principal intention of the paper is to describe and comment on the key components of the MCAA with regard to the commons, customary rights and decision making under the Resource Management Act 1991. During the process of the Marine and Coastal Area Bill through Parliament the author acted for Local Government New Zealand. The author advised on policy and <b>legislative</b> review, <b>consultation</b> with the Ministry of Justice and other Crown departments, and submissions to the Maori Affairs Select Committee. He has also acted for local authorities in respect of a number of treaty settlements. Much of the work we has undertaken focuses on the implications of the MCAA, and other proposed settlement legislation, on issues of public interest and local government decision making. In this context the paper finishes by considering first the implications of the MCAA for other marine and coastal area users; secondly a hypothetical case study in which customary rights are implemented; and thirdly the potential influence the MCAA will have on local government decision-making and public participation under future settlement legislation...|$|R
40|$|There {{are three}} main powers in any {{decision-making}} situation: agenda-setting, voting, and voice. One of these - 'the power of voice' - {{is the great}} unknown. To analyse this power, this dissertation develops a general model of law-making using two basic premises: (1) a distinction between policies and outcomes, and (2) the costs of transmission of policy-relevant information. The model divides the law-making game in two sub-games: a lobbying sub-game, where an indefinite number of lobbyists provide legislative bodies with information; and a legislative sub-game, where legislative bodies bargain with that information under a given decision rule. The general model is then applied to the three main EC <b>legislative</b> procedures (<b>consultation,</b> assent and co-decision), which produces a series of propositions about how the power of voice operates, relative {{to the power of}} veto. These propositions are then tested, using data on nearly two thousand legislative procedures from the 1989 - 1999 period and the results of an issue-based survey of political consultants. Two case studies then illustrate the workings of the powers of voice and veto, respectively. Finally, the conclusions focus {{on the nature of the}} power of voice, the informational rationale of its delegation, and the implications for the accountability of the EU...|$|R

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{public consultation}} {{in the context}} of New Zealand local government. Although by international standards New Zealand possesses a rich culture of citizen engagement and public consultation (OECD, 2015), the quality of consultation presents itself as a problem to local government, as their efforts have often been perceived as unsatisfactory (Asquith, 2012; Barrett, 2011; Barrett and Scott, 2008; Bond, 2007; Cheyne, 2015; Woodward, 2016). New Zealand’s consultation environment is particular too, in that local government engagement with Mäori, including with iwi organisations such as rünanga, with mätäwaka (Mäori living outside the rohe of their iwi affiliations) and via central government, is integral to decision-making processes (Ryks, Pearson and Waa, 2016). We begin by sketching some theoretical underpinnings of <b>consultation,</b> and the <b>legislative</b> requirements for <b>consultation</b> in New Zealand. We then consider two examples – Loomio in Wellington and Share an Idea in Christchurch – before signalling some areas in which public consultation could be improved and local government can increase its democratic efficacy.  ...|$|R
30|$|Once {{terms such}} as ‘place’ are given some {{preferred}} content, we can see {{how it can be}} used to adjudicate the argument between MC and IC over the latter’s claim that it but not MC is dialogical. Boucher and Maclure (2018) rightly remind us that ‘[MC] dialogue.. refers to the meeting of ideas, values, symbols and arguments, whilst intercultural contact refers to the meeting of real people in specific physical places’. And they usefully add ‘[o]f course the two notions are not logically mutually exclusive, but they do not imply one another… Most importantly, emphasising the value of one or the other may command different policies. The importance of intercultural dialogue is likely to require that the government is more sensitive to the values and practices of minority groups expressed by their elites in various formal settings (courts, official public <b>consultations,</b> <b>legislative</b> assemblies and so on), whereas the importance of intercultural contacts is likely to require policies of urban planning emphasizing the creation of urban spaces conductive to positive intercultural encounters’ (p. 4).|$|R
30|$|The {{notion of}} intercultural contact or {{interaction}} is conceptually {{distinct from the}} broader notion of intercultural dialogue, which normally refers to the societal process by which ideas, values and practices emerging from different traditions adjust {{to one another and}} negotiate their expression within a shared public sphere. Intercultural dialogue refers to the meeting of ideas, values, symbols and arguments, whilst intercultural contact refers to the meeting of real people in specific physical places. Of course, the two notions are not logically mutually exclusive, but they do not imply one another. A specific intercultural contact between two individuals from different backgrounds may or not lead to an intercultural dialogue—it can for instance consist of a discussion about the weather occurring at the park—and intercultural dialogue may or not be a process involving widespread intercultural face-to-face contacts in daily life—it can for instance consists of a series of written communications in newspapers or academic journals. Most importantly, emphasizing the value of one or the other may command different policies. The importance of intercultural dialogue is likely to require that government be more sensitive to the values and practices of minority groups expressed by their elites in various formal settings (courts, official public <b>consultations,</b> <b>legislative</b> assemblies and so on), whereas the importance of intercultural contacts is likely to require policies of urban planning emphasizing the creation of urban spaces conductive to positive intercultural encounters.|$|R

40|$|The {{practice}} of consultation between senior managers and employee representatives {{has a long}} history in British employment relations yet has often been overshadowed by discussions on collective bargaining. In the last few decades, the importance of consultation has been elevated by two main trends: the decline in trade union membership and the retreat from collective bargaining in the private sector on the one hand, with the result that consultation may be the only form of collective employee voice available; and the programme of <b>legislative</b> support for <b>consultation</b> by the European Union since the 1970 s on the other. The book charts the meaning and development of consultation in the twentieth century and explores the justifications for the practice. It shows how EU intervention to promote consultation evolved and changed, paying particular attention to the adoption of the Information and Consultation of Employees (ICE) Regulations, which became fully operational in enterprises with 50 or more employees in 2008. Analysing the half-hearted response to EU consultation initiatives by the social partners in Britain, it provides a critical assessment of successive UK governments' handling of the issue. Drawing on the authors' empirical research in twenty-five organizations, the book closely examines the take-up and impact of consultation regulations, and explores the processes involved in effective consultation. Consultation at Work looks at the dynamics of consultation and draws a contrast between 'active' consultation of the type envisaged by the EU, and more limited consultation used as a means of communication. Discussing the UK experience in comparative perspectives, it asks what has to happen for the take-up of consultation to improve and suggests the changes that should be made to the EU Directive and UK ICE Regulations...|$|R
40|$|This {{report from}} the Centre for Applied Childhood Studies at the University of Huddersfield in the United Kingdom (UK) and the UK-based Action for Children {{describes}} an action research project study that investigated child sexual abuse across several Caribbean countries. The study, "Perceptions of, Attitudes to, and Opinions on Child Sexual Abuse in the Eastern Caribbean", was carried out across 6 countries - Anguilla, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Montserrat, and St. Kitts and Nevis - {{in an effort to}} understand how Caribbean people perceive the problem, what behaviours and social conditions contribute to it, what the impact of child sexual abuse is on those most affected, and what views are held about the forms of action that might be needed. With funding from the United Kingdom (UK) Department for International Development (DFID), the study was commissioned by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) /the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) as part of an initiative aimed at reducing sexual violence against children. A mixed-methods approach was used to gather data from 5 stakeholder groups: the general population, professionals in relevant fields, policymakers, survivors of sexual abuse, and parents. About 1, 400 people participated in the study overall. The methods used included: literature reviews: overview of international research; policy and <b>legislative</b> analysis; stakeholder <b>consultation</b> sessions; stakeholder engagement at the regional level; focus group discussions; practice-focused interviews with key informants; policy-focused interviews with key informants; narrative interviews with adult survivors in 3 countries; and a community survey of perceptions, attitudes, and opinions across a representative sample in each country. Results are shared with regard to how participants define childhood and sexual abuse, as well as what the scale of the problem is in the Caribbean region. In brief, the research revealed that there is both heightened awareness of child sexual abuse and, in the perception of the majority of people who participated in the study, recognition that it is a "serious and wide-spread problem in the Caribbean". With regard to communication, specifically, the study suggests that there are particular issues for Caribbean societies that affect the reporting of abuse and that may also add to problems of estimating scale: In small societies, anonymity and confidentiality cannot be assured; the perpetrator may be in a position of power or is likely to know someone who is and may be able to influence the outcome of a report; the procedures for dealing with reports, systems for monitoring abuse, and services to deal with the impact of disclosure are underdeveloped; cultural values about the status of children means that they are not always believed; and poverty and the economic and social reliance of many Caribbean women on men mean that action which may affect the main breadwinner (such as reporting abuse) is often undermined by women themselves. Again highlighting communication-related findings of the survey: several forms of sexual abuse described here take place in an atmosphere of secrecy and are kept hidden. The research revealed evidence of new trends in child sexual abuse and also patterns of abuse. Communication-related trends include: Cell phone pornography was reported as a growing problem among children. Children use the cameras on their cell phones to take sexual images of themselves and their friends and then distribute the images. Also, internet abuse was noted as increasing: There were reports of children being approached by predators through social networking sites. In summary, the study identified interlocking factors that perpetuate abuse as follows: harmful sexual cultures (implicit social sanctioning), males with sexually abusive behaviours, females with complicit behaviours, officials with collusive (condoning) behaviours, lack of awareness of effects and consequences, lack of collective public/professional outrage, ineffective systems for reporting and responding to abuse, patriarchal values which place protecting male status and privilege above protection of the child, and disempowerment of children. Legislation to adequately protect children was generally regarded as ineffective and was seen as being compounded by the failure of the criminal justice system. Respondents pointed to "a severe shortage of skilled persons to intervene and provide therapeutic interventions for victims". Another issue raised by many respondents was the complicity of professionals who are aware of abuse and do not act to report it or to protect the child. Furthermore, while, in theory, children should be able to tell their non-abusing parent about sexual abuse or any adult in a position of authority or trust, the study suggests that most children would not risk disclosing to a parent or other adult - they would most likely tell a friend. Recommendations cited in the report include: 1. Develop a regional (and country-level) strategic plan for building abuse-free childhoods based on a "whole of society approach". 2. Treat child sexual abuse as a public health issue, which would "push the problem higher up the political agenda and would enable governments to access funds from different sources to tackle the problem. " 3. Adopt the "child/family friendly approach to budgeting, social planning and economic development", which advocates making the support of the family and the well-being of children the responsibility of every Ministry; it involves identifying multi-sectoral targets and requires the ring-fencing of budgets to achieve progress. 4. Introduce child-sensitive justice systems for child sexual abuse crimes (e. g., reconsider the approach to mandatory reporting, which requires adequate infrastructure for implementation and monitoring, and "is unlikely to result in the social transformation needed to stop" child sexual abuse). 5. Introduce specific interventions based on evidence of their effectiveness in other contexts that can be adapted for the region and which are not high-resource dependent - e. g., build capacity and infrastructure for child protection. In addition to these recommendations, the report details other suggestions and ideas put forward by research participants and through stakeholder consultations - many of which revolve around behaviour and attitude change...|$|R
