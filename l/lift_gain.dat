40|$|The {{aerodynamics}} of {{a rectangular}} wing with a jet exhausting in the spanwise {{direction from the}} tips has been explored experimentally. By effectively changing the span of the wing as well as outwardly displacing the tip vortices, such jets can induce aerodynamic forces {{that could be used}} for roll and lateral control of aircraft. The concept has been investigated for a variety of jet intensities, angles of attack, and aspect ratios. The results appear to confirm theoretically predicted scaling laws for <b>lift</b> <b>gain</b> and moment generation due to blowing...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A flight-dynamics {{oriented}} {{simulation model}} of a flapping-wing Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) has been developed. This concept is based on flapping flight performed in nature by insects or hummingbirds. An optimization of the flapping kinematics of the wing has been led, {{in order to maximize}} the mean lift and thus the payload. A neural network has been designed to reproduce the function shape of the wings movements, and the weights have been optimized using a genetic algorithm. Results show a <b>lift</b> <b>gain</b> from 30 to 40 %, and corroborate also some mechanisms shown up through experiments. Copyright c© 2005 IFA...|$|E

40|$|Wind tunnel {{tests were}} {{conducted}} on two devices {{for the purpose of}} lift augmentation on a 60 deg delta wing at low speed. Lift, drag, pitching moment, and surface pressures were measured. Detailed flow visualization was also obtained. Both the leading edge fence and the Gurney flap are shown to increase lift. The fences and flap shift the lift curve as much as 5 deg and 10 deg, respectively. The fences aid in trapping vortices on the upper surface, thereby increasing suction. The Gurney flap improves circulation at the trailing edge. The individual influences of both devices are roughly additive, creating high <b>lift</b> <b>gain.</b> However, the lower lift to drag ratio and the precipitation of vortex burst caused by the fences, and the nose down pitching moment created by the flap are also significant factors...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. An {{exploratory}} study is performed {{to investigate the}} use of a time-dependent discrete adjoint methodology for design optimization of a high-lift wing configuration augmented with an active flow control system. The location and blowing parameters associated with a series of jet actuation orifices are used as design variables. In addition, a geometric parameterization scheme is developed to provide a compact set of design variables describing the wing shape. The scaling of the implementation is studied using several thousand processors and it is found that asynchronous file operations can greatly improve the overall performance of the approach in such massively parallel environments. Three design examples are presented which seek to maximize the mean value of the lift coefficient for the coupled system, and results demonstrate improvements as high as 27 % relative to the lift obtained with non-optimized actuation. This <b>lift</b> <b>gain</b> is {{more than three times the}} incremental lift provided by the non-optimized actuation...|$|E
40|$|The mean {{aerodynamic}} effects of coupling synthetic jet actuators with a diver-gent trailing edge on a swept wing were investigated. An array of seven synthetic jet actuators were embedded into the trailing {{edge of a}} modified NACA 652 − 215 swept wing section with an aspect ratio, AR = 5. 3 and chord Reynolds number of Rec = 85, 000. The traditional sharp trailing edge was replaced by a divergent trailing edge with a characteristic scale of 0. 03 C. Qualitative changes in the flow were observed using smoke wire flow visualization. A two-component, load balance was used to measure the aerodynamic forces on the wing model, and ensemble averaged PIV measurements were taken to quantify the changes in the flow field near the synthetic jet orifice. The combined effect of a divergent trailing edge and synthetic jets produced a significant increase in lift accompanied by an increase in drag through all angles of attack up to stall. As a consequence of the <b>lift</b> <b>gain,</b> there was an increase in the lift to drag ratio at low angles of attack...|$|E

40|$|Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are proliferating in {{both the}} civil and {{military}} markets. Flapping wing UAVs, or ornithopters, {{have the potential to}} combine the agility and maneuverability of rotary wing aircraft with excellent performance in low Reynolds number flight regimes. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present new free flight experimental results for an ornithopter equipped with one degree of freedom (1 DOF) compliant spines that were designed and optimized in terms of mass, maximum von-Mises stress, and desired wing bending deflections. The spines were inserted in an experimental ornithopter wing spar in order to achieve a set of desired kinematics during the up and down strokes of a flapping cycle. The ornithopter was flown at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in the Air Force Research Laboratory Small Unmanned Air Systems (SUAS) indoor flight facility. Vicon motion tracking cameras were used to track the motion of the vehicle for five different wing configurations. The effect of the presence of the compliant spine on wing kinematics and leading edge spar deflection during flight is presented. Results show that the ornithopter with the compliant spine inserted in its wing reduced the body acceleration during the upstroke which translates into overall <b>lift</b> <b>gains...</b>|$|R
40|$|The surface {{pressure}} and thermal {{characteristics of a}} large-scale model of a highly maneuverable supersonic fighter with STOL capability are described. The 7. 28 m span model is powered by two J- 97 turbojets, operated at 9340 N thrust. It combines upper-surface and spanwise blowing to augment the lift characteristics over a wide angle-of-attack range. The most significant feature of the fighter's flow field is the leading edge vortex that forms at low alphas, grows stronger, and moves inboard as alpha is increased. Upper surface blowing enhanced the lift on the wing in both stalled and unstalled areas significantly, while generating only a modest aft shift {{in the center of}} pressure. <b>Lift</b> <b>gains</b> were greatest at high alphas and with the flap deflected. Spanwise blowing was most significant at angles-of-attack greater than 8 deg, when the jet strengthened the vortex. The 1100 F spanwise blowing jet mixed very rapidly with the wing flow field, creating a maximum temperature rise of only 300 - 350 F. A comparison of small-scale and large-scale model wing pressure characteristics showed similar trends created by upper surface blowing, while spanwise blowing characteristics differed considerably. Force data correlated well with semi-empirical predictions for gross thrust coefficients less than 1. 0...|$|R
25|$|When on {{approach}} to land, the pilot would push the stick forward to gain speed for the flare and landing. As speed built up, the rear wing, operating at a greater {{angle of attack}} would <b>gain</b> <b>lift</b> and pitch the aircraft's nose further downward. The pilot's normal reaction would be to pull back on the stick. This action would increase the angle of attack on the front wing by lowering {{the trailing edge of}} the wing. Because the trailing edge of the front wing was close to {{the leading edge of the}} rear wing, the front wing's downwash would accelerate the air over the rear wing and cause it to <b>gain</b> <b>lift</b> more quickly than the front wing, resulting in an ever-increasing nose pitch-down and flight directly into the ground.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Aerospace EngineeringThe use of {{atmospheric}} updrafts as an energy source for long endurance flight {{has proven to}} be extremely advantageous for birds, remote control sailplanes, and manned soaring vehicles. Recent research conducted by Michael Allen at NASA and Dr. Dan Edwards at North Carolina State University has demonstrated the viability of using a UAV to search for, detect, and gain altitude using thermal updrafts. This approach can be taken a step further by introducing multiple cooperating vehicles to reduce the time spent searching for thermal lift while simultaneously increasing the time spent in thermal <b>lift</b> <b>gaining</b> altitude and/or saving fuel. UAV missions calling for multiple vehicles can use this approach to reduce the demand for on board energy storage by using environmental energy more effectively than a vehicle flying alone. This research aims to complement existing autonomous soaring efforts by developing a low cost thermal soaring system that is capable of working with single or multiple cooperating vehicles to find and utilize thermal updrafts. Early simulations developed to validate this idea have given rise to further analysis and experimentation with two custom airframes, each equipped with instruments to detect updrafts and autonomous capabilities to test cooperative soaring algorithms in the real world. The system developed used a sub $ 1000 commercial off-the-shelf autopilot and custom ground control software to achieve many autonomous soaring flights with a single vehicle. Several flights with two autonomous vehicles were also performed and cooperative behavior was demonstrated...|$|R
