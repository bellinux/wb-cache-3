5|$|After {{the second}} lacuna, Hymir {{is sitting in}} the boat, unhappy and totally silent, as they row back to shore. On shore, Hymir {{suggests}} that Thor should help him carry a whale back to his farm. Thor picks both the boat and the whales up, and carries it all back to Hymir's farm. After Thor successfully smashes a crystal goblet by throwing it at Hymir's head on Týr's mother's suggestion, Thor and Týr are given the cauldron. Týr cannot lift it, but Thor manages to roll it, and so with it they <b>leave.</b> <b>Some</b> distance from Hymir's home, an army of many-headed beings led by Hymir attacks the two, but are killed by the hammer of Thor. Although one of his goats is lame in the leg, the two manage to bring the cauldron back, have plenty of ale, and so, from then on, return to Ægir's for more every winter.|$|E

And as I am but one body naturally considered, though by His permission a body politic to govern, so shall I desire you all... to be assistant to me, that I with my ruling and you with your service may make a good account to Almighty God and <b>leave</b> <b>some</b> comfort to our posterity on earth.

5|$|Police {{raids on}} gay bars were frequent—occurring on average {{once a month}} for each bar. Many bars kept extra liquor in a secret panel behind the bar, or in a car down the block, to {{facilitate}} resuming business {{as quickly as possible}} if alcohol was seized. Bar management usually knew about raids beforehand due to police tip-offs, and raids occurred early enough in the evening that business could commence after the police had finished. During a typical raid, the lights were turned on, and customers were lined up and their identification cards checked. Those without identification or dressed in full drag were arrested; others were allowed to <b>leave.</b> <b>Some</b> of the men, including those in drag, used their draft cards as identification. Women were required to wear three pieces of feminine clothing, and would be arrested if found not wearing them. Employees and management of the bars were also typically arrested. The period immediately before June 28, 1969, was marked by frequent raids of local bars—including a raid at the Stonewall Inn on the Tuesday before the riots—and the closing of the Checkerboard, the Tele-Star, and two other clubs in Greenwich Village.|$|E
5|$|The German crusaders, {{accompanied}} by the papal legate and cardinal Theodwin, intended to meet the French in Constantinople. Ottokar III of Styria joined Conrad at Vienna, and Conrad's enemy Géza II of Hungary allowed them to pass through unharmed. When the German army of 20,000 men arrived in Byzantine territory, Emperor Manuel I Komnenos feared {{they were going to}} attack him, and Byzantine troops were posted to ensure that there was no trouble. There was a brief skirmish with some of the more unruly Germans near Philippopolis and in Adrianople, where the Byzantine general Prosouch fought with Conrad's nephew, the future emperor Frederick. To make matters worse, some of the German soldiers were killed in a flood at the beginning of September. On 10 September, however, they arrived at Constantinople, where relations with Manuel were poor, resulting in a battle, after which the Germans were convinced that they should cross into Asia Minor as quickly as possible. Manuel wanted Conrad to <b>leave</b> <b>some</b> of his troops behind, to assist in defending against attacks from Roger II, who had taken the opportunity to plunder the cities of Greece, but Conrad did not agree, despite being a fellow enemy of Roger.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{estimated that}} oil would average $124 a barrel {{for the year}} {{but as a result}} of lower oil production, caused by maintenance of two of the three offshore oil rigs, the province would record a deficit of $258 million. Marshall stated that while he could have eliminated the deficit in one year through cuts, the government decided that they would run a deficit for two years before going back to surpluses. The government also announced that over the next 10 years they would embark on a “core mandate analysis” to restrain growth in program spending to the rate of inflation, and reduce Newfoundland and Labrador’s debt level to the all-province average. Just three months after the budget was delivered Dunderdale announced that the government would cut back on travel and <b>leave</b> <b>some</b> vacant positions unfilled due to a drop in oil prices. On the day of her news conference brent crude, a close reference point for oil produced offshore Newfoundland, stood at $103 a barrel, which was up from $90 the previous month. For every $1 drop in the price of oil below government estimates results in nearly $20 million less being funnelled into the provincial treasury, which meant the deficit for the year was expected to climb by several hundred million dollars. By the time Finance Minister Marshall released his mid-year economic update on December 13, 2012, it was estimated that the deficit would total $726 million for that fiscal year.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} part of the 16th century history of Finland was growth of the area settled by the farming population. The crown encouraged farmers from the province of Savonia to settle the vast wilderness regions in Middle Finland. This was done, and the original Sami population often had to <b>leave.</b> <b>Some</b> of the wilderness settled was traditional hunting and fishing territory of Karelian hunters. During the 1580s, this resulted in a bloody guerrilla warfare between the Finnish settlers and Karelians in some regions, especially in Ostrobothnia.|$|E

25|$|The {{decision}} to leave or stay was personal. Reasons for leaving ranged from noble (to join the fight), to fearful.
