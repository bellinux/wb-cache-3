40|$|<b>Loosening</b> <b>of</b> bolted {{connections}} in a structure can signifi-cantly reduce the load-bearing capacities of the structure. De-tecting <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> {{bolted connections}} {{at an early}} stage can avoid failure of the structure. Due to the complex geometry of a bolted connection and the material discontinuity between the clamped components, it is difficult to detect <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> a bolted connection using conventional non-destructive test methods. A vibration-based method that uses changes in natural frequencies of a structure to detect the locations and extent of damage can be used to detect <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> bolted connections, since the method focuses on detecting a stiffness reduction, which can result from <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> the bolted connections.

40|$|Introduction: Total hip {{arthroplasty}} (THA) is {{a commonly}} used surgical treatment of osteoarthritis {{of the hip}} joint. A frequent complication <b>of</b> THA is <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> one or both components <b>of</b> the prosthesis. <b>Loosening</b> <b>of</b> the hip prosthesis is usually caused by mechanical (aseptic) causes but can also have an infectional (septic) cause. Both types <b>of</b> <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> the hip prosthesis require a different surgical treatment. The treatment <b>of</b> aseptic <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> the hip prosthesis consists of one operation during which one or both components of the prosthesis are being changed (1 -stage revision THA). Treatment <b>of</b> septic <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> the hip prosthesis requires a more intensive treatment because first the infection has to be cleared. Previous studies showed that certain patient-related factors have {{an increased risk of}} aseptic or septic <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> the hip prosthesis. However, no study has been performed into the difference between patient-related factors with aseptic or septic <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> the hip prosthesis. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify patient-related factors that are associated with an increased risk of aseptic or septic <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> the hip prosthesis. Methods: This retrospective cohort study consisted of 257 patients who underwent a revision THA between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2011 admitted to the orthopedic unit of the Martini Hospital in Groningen. After in- and exclusioncriteria, 161 patients were being included. Patient-related and surgical factors were derived from EPD and patient charts. Analysed patient-related factors included the 19 specific diseases that are used to determine the Charlson Comorbidity Index as well as the 30 most common chronic diseases according to the Dutch Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM). Uni- and multivariate logistic regressions were performed to identify patient-related factors related to aseptic or septic <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> the hip prosthesis. Results: Of the 161 patients, 151 patients had an aseptic loosening and 15 patients had a septic <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> the hip prosthesis. Analysis showed that myocardial infarction (OR, 7. 37; BI 1. 86 - 29. 20) and cancer (OR, 5. 25; BI 1. 65 - 16. 76) had a raised chance for septic loosening in comparison with aseptic <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> the hip prosthesis. Overweight showed to be a raised chance OR, 0. 26; BI, 0. 07 - 0. 97) for aseptic <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> the hip prosthesis. Also having a high Charlson score (> 5) in comparison with a Charlson score of 0 was a risk factor for septic <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> the hip prosthesis. Conclusions: This study showed that patients with myocardial infarction or cancer in the medical history have a significant higher risk for septic loosening in comparison with aseptic <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> the hip prosthesis. Overweight is a risk factor for aseptic loosening in comparison with septic <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> the hip prosthesis. Also having a high Charlson score (> 5) is a risk factor for septic <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> the hip prosthesis. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} matte finish and {{modularity}} on <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> tapered stems {{using the same}} cementing technique were studied prospectively. In 80 patients, 82 cemented Exeter primary stems were implanted at total hip revision by one surgeon using the same surgical and cementing technique throughout the series. The polished stems behaved differently than the matte surfaced stems behaved. Polished stems subsided in the cement mantle an average of 1 mm at 2 years after implantation, but without subsequent <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> stems at as long as 12 years after implantation. Matte surfaced stems with metal centralizers had a higher loosening rate, and loss of fixation at the prosthesis to cement interface was identified as an early sign <b>of</b> <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> these stems. At a mean 6 -year followup, there were no revisions nor was there radiographic evidence <b>of</b> <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> the polished modular stems. It is concluded that matte finish results in increased <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> tapered stems but the introduction of modularity did not.

40|$|Background: Several {{international}} studies {{examined the effects}} <b>of</b> comorbidity on <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> a Total Knee Prosthesis (TKP). However the influence of comorbid conditions on <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> a TKP in the Dutch population is not clear. Aim {{of this study was}} to examine the prevalence of comorbid conditions and their influence on aseptic and septic <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> a TKP in a Dutch population. Methods: Retrospective cohort study, which was executed at University Medical Center Groningen. Patients with aseptic or septic <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> a TKP between January 2007 and December 2012 were included. Comorbid conditions were selected based on the Charlson comorbidity index and the 30 most common chronic diseases, as defined by the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM). Odds ratios for comorbid conditions were calculated using univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses. Results: Aseptic loosening occured in 50 patients and 13 had septic <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> a TKP. Hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, overweight and obesitas were more prevalent in patients suffering from <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> a TKP. Diabetes mellitus (OR 0, 1; p = 0, 040) was the only predictor for aseptic loosening. Predictors for septic loosening were pre-operative anemia (OR 6, 2; p = 0, 025) and overweight (OR 9, 9; p = 0, 071). Conclusion: Diabetes mellitus was associated with an increased risk <b>of</b> aseptic <b>loosening.</b> Pre-operative anemia and overweigh were predictive for septic <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> a TKP. Results of this study are in line with earlier results of {{international studies}}, new associations were not found. ...|$|R

40|$|Bolted joints {{are widely}} used {{in a variety of}} {{engineering}} applications where they are dynamically loaded with frequencies of vibration spread over a wide spectrum with the same general effects. When under dynamic loading, bolted joints can become loose due to a loss in clamping pressure in the joints. This vibrational loosening sometimes can cause serious problems, and in some cases can lead to fatal consequences if it remains undetected. Non-intrusive ultrasonic and image processing techniques were simultaneously used to investigate the relaxation of contact pressure and <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> bolted joints subjected to cyclic shear loading. Three critical areas, the contact interface of the bolted component, the bolt length and the rotation of the bolt head, were monitored during <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> the joints. The results show that <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> bolted joints can be grouped into three stages: very rapid, rapid, and gradual loosening. The earliest stage <b>of</b> the <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> bolted joints is characterised by cyclic strain ratcheting–loosening of the bolted joint during vibration without rotation of the bolt head. The higher the rate of relaxation at this early stage, the lower is the resistance of the bolted joint to vibration-induced loosening. Both the dynamic shear load and an additional constant shear load in another direction were observed to affect the rate <b>of</b> <b>loosening,</b> and at this early stage, a rise in the magnitude of the additional constant shear load increases the rate <b>of</b> <b>loosening.</b> Furthermore, the contact pressure distribution affects the rate <b>of</b> <b>loosening</b> at the bolted joint interface, as loosening increases away from area of high contact pressure...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBolted joints {{are used}} for {{fastening}} components together in the industry, aeronautics and in railways. These joints may get loose with time and if not attended timely may result in catastrophic failure also. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the effect of tightening torque on loosening. For this purpose tests were conducted using three different tightening torque values, in the vicinity of rated torque. Washers of different types are used in bolted joint, with an understanding that they prevent or retard loosening. This study also attempts to examine the role of two types of most commonly used washers: the plain washer and the spring washer. Trials were also performed on joint without any washer, for the sake <b>of</b> comparison <b>of</b> <b>loosening</b> performance <b>of</b> the joint. The results of this experimental study are shown in terms of starting point <b>of</b> <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> joint and rate <b>of</b> <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> the joint.
