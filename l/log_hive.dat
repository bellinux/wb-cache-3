50|$|Apis cerana is {{very famous}} in Nepal {{because of the}} low cost of its beehive, the <b>log</b> <b>hive.</b> Farmers can build their own beehives. The {{principle}} is to dig a hole in a trunk (the size is about 50 cm in diameter and 65 cm in height), and then a cap is necessary to protect {{the top of the}} beehive from cold and predators (e.g. Marte flavigula).|$|E
50|$|Stingless bees usually nest {{in hollow}} trunks, tree branches, {{underground}} cavities, or rock crevices, {{but they have}} also been encountered in wall cavities, old rubbish bins, water meters, and storage drums. Many beekeepers keep the bees in their original <b>log</b> <b>hive</b> or transfer them to a wooden box, as this {{makes it easier to}} control the hive. Some beekeepers put them in bamboos, flowerpots, coconut shells, and other recycling containers such as a water jug, a broken guitar, and other safe and closed containers.|$|E
50|$|Apis cerana is {{much more}} {{resistant}} than Apis mellifera to cold and predators. During the winter, most Apis cerana colonies are reduced because of the harsh weather and the low amount of flowers. Nevertheless, compared to Apis mellifera, Apis cerana can survive in low temperatures (i.e. -0,1 °C) (Thapa, 2001) because their beehives (i.e. <b>log</b> <b>hive)</b> can protect themselves from the cold. Furthermore, Api cerana is resistant to the parasite, Varroa destructor. The acarid breed feeds on bees’ larva. Api melifera is very sensitive to this parasite and causes an incapacity to fly, an abdomenal malformation and appearance of cannibalism (Experimental and Applied Acarology, 2000).|$|E
50|$|In the Teraï, {{a region}} located at an {{altitude}} of 60 to 300 m (FAO), there are counts of about 120 000 colonies of Api cerana (Thapa, 2001). The flora is also favourable to honey-production thanks to tropical plants. The weather is moderate all year long. The <b>log</b> <b>hives</b> permit honey production from Apis cerena.|$|R
5000|$|Practitioners of [...] "natural beekeeping" [...] {{tend to use}} {{variations}} of the top-bar hive, which is a simple design that retains the concept of movable comb {{without the use of}} frames or foundation. The horizontal top-bar hive, as championed by Marty Hardison, Michael Bush, Philip Chandler, Dennis Murrell and others, {{can be seen as a}} modernization of hollow <b>log</b> <b>hives,</b> with the addition of wooden bars of specific width from which bees hang their combs. Its widespread adoption in recent years can be attributed to the publication in 2007 of The Barefoot Beekeeper by Philip Chandler, which challenged many aspects of modern beekeeping and offered the horizontal top-bar hive as a viable alternative to the ubiquitous Langstroth-style movable-frame hive.|$|R
40|$|Twenty {{indigenous}} (Apis mellifera yemenitica) honeybee colonies {{were transferred}} from the traditional <b>log</b> <b>hives</b> into modern movable frame (Langstroth) hives and divided into 4 Groups. Each group was provided with a modified frame to assess the effect of frame-type on colony settlement, wax secretion, sugar syrup and pollen consumption, sealed brood area, honey and pollen storage. Role of sugar syrup and pollen patty feeding was also evaluated for easy Apis mellifera yemenitica establishment in modern hives under Riyadh conditions. In treatment A and B where the frames were provided with complete wax foundation sheets and one inch wide wax foundation stripe, respectively showed complete colony`s settlement. In treatments C the wired frame without wax foundation sheet and in treatment D where the frames were without wire and wax foundation sheets out of 5 could settle only 3 and 2 - Apis mellifera yemenitica colonies respectively. The food consumption rate remained high in treatment B followed by A, C and D, respectively whereas the sealed brood area, honey and pollen storage were found maximum in treatment A followed by B, C and D, respectively. The dimensions of the hive cells were found different in frames with the wax foundation sheet and without wax foundation sheet. The bees constructed larger cells 27 /sq. inch in frames with wax foundation sheets and smaller cells 34 /sq. inch in frames without wax foundation sheets...|$|R
50|$|Until the 1960s, beekeepers {{in rural}} Tanzania used {{predominantly}} log hives, {{which consisted of}} a cylinder with closed ends and a harvesting hole near the middle. The fact that harvesting was done {{from the middle of}} the log meant that brood comb was destroyed every time honey was harvested. The Tanzanian government then promoted two alternative hive types, namely a <b>log</b> <b>hive</b> that could be harvested from either end (so that the brood nest in the centre remains undisturbed) and a plank hive, which was a simple top-bar hive. The plank hive did not use moveable top bars, however — bees would attach comb in natural patterns to the roof. The advantage of the plank hive was that it enabled some inspection before harvest.|$|E
40|$|The {{sole purpose}} of a hive is to {{encourage}} the bees to build their nests {{in such a way}} that it is easy to manage and maintain them. This study examined four beehive types: namely improved frame hive (Zander model), Kenya Top Bar Hive (KTB), Ethio-ribrab hive and traditional log hives based on honey yield performance, honeybee colony strength and profitability under environmental condition of Bonga, southwest Ethiopia. The overall average annual honey yield performance clearly revealed both improved frame hive (30. 09 ± 2. 69 kg/hive) and Ethio-ribrab hive (29. 22 ± 2. 69 kg/hive) were significantly higher (p < 0. 0001) than KTB hive (15. 71 ± 2. 22 kg/hive) and traditional <b>log</b> <b>hive</b> (15. 36 ± 0. 86 kg/hive). In addition, the strength of honeybee colonies in the present study found to be higher in improved frame hive and Ethio-ribrab hive but medium in KTB hive and Traditional <b>log</b> <b>hive.</b> The total cost of production and gross return of improved frame hive was higher than Ethio-ribrab, KTB hive and traditional log hives.

40|$|Stingless bees (kelulut) keeping {{is now a}} {{trend in}} Malaysia. However, since demand {{for the source of}} colony in log is increasing, the log price is rapidly increasing. But, there is no data {{reported}} on the economic viability of meliponiculture in the current market price. Thus, the objective {{of this study is to}} clarify the economic viability of investment in meliponiculture in the current market price by engineering economic perspective. Investment in meliponiculture was analysed using Equivalent Annual Uniform Cost (EAUC), Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and Breakeven Analysis. A small start-up with 30 units of <b>logs</b> or <b>hives</b> was considered in the analysis. All raw data was acquainted from current Malaysian market price, but only revenue from honey was considered. It was found that EAUC indicated that the annual worth of the log system is 23 % better than the hive system. However, IRR calculation indicated that both the <b>log</b> and the <b>hive</b> systems offer margin exceeding 55 % which is a very good return in general investment. In addition, it was also found that the log system had breakeven after 8 th month, whereas the hive was 13 th month. Better economic value could be obtained if revenue from by-products are considered. Thus, it can be concluded that meliponiculture is still very economically viable in Malaysia market trend, and the hive systems could be a better choice if splitting colony, maintenance, safety and aesthetics points of view are considered...|$|R
50|$|Beekeepers {{provide a}} place for the colony to live and store honey. There are seven basic types of beehive: skeps, Langstroth hives, top-bar <b>hives,</b> box <b>hives,</b> <b>log</b> gums, D. E. hive, and miller hives. All U.S. states require beekeepers to use movable frames to allow bee {{inspectors}} to check the brood for disease. This allows beekeepers to keep Langstroth, top-bar and D.E. hives without special permission, granted for purposes such as museum use. Modern hives also enable beekeepers to transport bees, moving from field to field as crops require pollinating (a source of income for beekeepers).|$|R
40|$|Medicinal {{products}} from bees Cue: Honey {{has been used}} as a form of medicine since ancient times. But while honey medicine might normally be associated with traditional healers, in recent years, the value of honey as a tool for fighting bacteria has been increasingly recognised by hospital-trained doctors. And it is not only honey that can be used to support human health. Other bee products such as royal jelly and bee venom are also widely used, particularly in Japan, the world?s leading importer of medicinal bee products. Some people claim that royal jelly, a substance produced by worker bees as a food for the queen bee, can offer a wide range of medical benefits. While these claims have not yet been fully backed up by science, royal jelly does have anti-bacterial properties and is a concentrated source of nutrients. People living in Arumeru district in northern Tanzania are very familiar with the healing powers of honey. Traditional healers in the area use honey to treat coughs, stomach ulcers, malaria and burns. Local organisation Dakika trains women?s groups to produce honey, both for sale and for the production of medicines. These are sold in various outlets, both within Tanzania and further afield. Lazarus Laiser visited the Dakika headquarters and spoke to extension officer David Pallangyo and to Celina Peter, one of the members. He asked Celina to describe the activities the organisation is involved in. IN:		?We have so many activities we ? OUT:		?our product has good quality. ? DUR?N:	 3 ? 58 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: David Pallangyo, a beekeeping extension worker, describing the medicinal products made by the Dakika organisation in northern Tanzania. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Peter	We have so many activities we do in the Dakika group. Most of all is beekeeping and education, we deal about education. Laiser	When did you start with beekeeping? Peter	Beekeeping was started in 1991. Laiser	So you get a kind of training? Peter	In our group we get so many seminars in how to make beehives, and we are using traditional beehives and modern beehives, and how to get beehives, we are making ourselves. Examples of traditional <b>hives,</b> we have <b>log</b> <b>hives</b> and bar hives. In modern, we have commercial or moveable frame, and Tanzania top-bar. Pallangyo	My name is David Pallangyo. I am a beekeeping extension officer in Dakika group. Laiser	What are your key points in Dakika? Pallangyo	(Vernac) For one to succeed in beekeeping it is good to search for advice from professionals in beekeeping. This will help you to get good honey from the hive safely, without breaking the honeycombs. Also, the use of smoke pipe is helping to avoid burning the forest and also to avoid disturbance to the environment and bees. It is also recommended to use equipment for bees. These equipments would help to protect from bees stings. And the equipments are like gumboots, an overall, face cap, gloves and smoke pipe. Laiser	Celina, how do you market your product, your honey and other honey products? Peter	We market our product in Tanzania and in the outside of Tanzania. Because in this group we have so many centres outside of the country. We have the centre of Mombassa and Uganda. We take the medicine ourselves and we go everywhere to sell, for example to the markets or to any centre. The bee products are honey, wax, royal jelly, and bee venom. Laiser	Which medicines are you, Dakika, able to make and produce from the bee products? Peter	They are royal jelly. From royal jelly we can get the medicine which is called temu. Temu is used to treat fungus. And from honey we can get the medicine called ngenuwa and moru. Ngenuwa we treat the ulcers and moru we treat cancer. From bee venom we can get tanika. Tanika is the medicine used to treat joints. Laiser	Is it allowed by the government for you to continue in the business of producing the medicines? Peter	The regional pharmacist, they accept our products, and give us permission to sell our medicine in different places inside the country and outside the country. Laiser	How do you ensure cleanliness of the products? Pallangyo	(Vernac) We are quite sure of the cleanliness of the products. In the room where the production is being carried out, nobody is allowed to get into the room, except the one who is making the product. For example, the one who is making what we call temu medicine will be dealing with that only, and nobody else. Many people come back to give us some feedback that the medicine has helped them, and that is really good for us. So we are very proud that our product has good quality. End of track.

40|$|Domestication of Meliponinae in <b>log</b> <b>hive</b> {{or simple}} box {{has often been}} used in Africa. However, colonyloss in these two hive types due to pest {{infestation}} after honey harvesting still occurs. We hypothesized that the two hive types were the probable causes for the infestations. We designed and assessed the hive acceptance andpostharvest colony losses of three Afrotropical Meliponinae namely Plebeina hildebrandti, Meliponula bocandei and two M. ferruginea morpho-speciesin a vertical compartmented hive (called the icipe- 4 M), as an alternative. We observed that P. hildebrandti had the lowest acceptance rate {{compared to the other}} species. However, all the bee species occupied the different hive compartments (brood and honey chamber) of the hive. Postharvest loss was lower in M. bocandei and the reddish brown M. ferrugineamorpho-species. Average honey yieldand honey composition were also evaluatedper species. Annually, M. bocandei produced more honey followed by M. ferruginea morpho-speciesandP. hildebrandti. Honey composition also varied among the species. We recommend that rural communities switch to using the icipe- 4 M hive to domesticate these stingless bee species, to decrease the losses of brood to pests, and increase the yields of harvested honey in domestication...|$|E
40|$|With {{financial}} assistance from CTA, the International Bee Research Association (IBRA) {{has produced a}} promotional brochure 'Beekeeping in Rural Development'. The brochure briefly reviews the potential for beekeeping in Africa, the Pacific and the Caribbean, Asia and the Americas and summarizes the main techniques practiced in each region. The different species of honey bee and their comparative advantages are described as are the differing designs of hive, which range from the hollow <b>log</b> to frame <b>hives.</b> Beekeeping has many attractions for rural farmers. Bees do not require daily attention and beekeeping does not take up valuable land or time {{which would have been}} spent on other farming activities. It can be practiced by males and females of all age groups and it helps generate self-reliance. Beekeeping associations or cooperatives can encourage contacts between rural people. Although honey is the major product, also important are beeswax, the bees' role as pollinators and the very high value royal jelly and propolis. Royal Jelly and propolis are high-value commodities but their exploitation requires skilled techniques and sophisticated technology which puts their production out of reach of the majority of rural farmers in developing countries. To make the most of apiculture beekeepers can benefit from the comprehensive information service offered by IBRA on all aspects of beekeeping, practical and scientific. Indeed, IBRA offers advice to all concerned with apiculture in the widest sense: beekeepers, agriculturists, the food industry, government departments, rural development personnel, botanists and foresters. 'Beekeeping in Rural Development 'provides guidance on where beekeeping can be practiced and what is needed to set up such a project: bees, hives, protective clothing and other basic equipment. Advice is also available on beekeeping projects including group activities for beekeepers, increasing production from planting suitable 'melliferous' vegetation, improving quality, disease control, marketing of products, as well as the effects of pesticide misuse. Essentially this is a 'starter' publication that will tell would-be and practicing beekeepers and project planners where to find further, more detailed, information. Much of that information will also be available from IBRA through its extensive library, experienced permanent staff, and its representatives in 50 countries.

40|$|Improved hive {{management}} Cue: Beehives come in many {{shapes and}} sizes. Traditional beehives are often made from hollowed out logs. A more modern type of beehive is the top-bar beehive, {{and the most}} sophisticated beehive is called a Langstroth beehive. This was designed by an American, the Reverend Lorenzo Langstroth, back in 1851. One {{of the advantages of}} the Langstroth hive is that the bees construct their honeycombs in frames which can be removed from the hive. This allows beekeepers to extract the honey without damaging the honeycomb, and then put the comb back into the hive. As a result, they can make more harvests each year, and get top quality honey. However, Langstroth hives are also more difficult to make. Carpenters may need specialised equipment and training, as the measurements of the structures in the hive must be extremely accurate. Many attempts to introduce Langstroth hives in Africa, particularly among rural communities, have failed. One organisation that has had some success however, is Honey Care Africa, which not only manufactures the hives, but also trains community members in beekeeping skills. Eric Kadenge visited their workshop in Nairobi, and spoke to operations manager Margaret Mimoh about their work. IN:		?This is the workshop, this is where ? OUT:		?are going to a group in Mount Kenya. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 46 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Margaret Mimoh, operations manager for Honey Care Africa, an organisation that promotes sustainable community beekeeping in East Africa. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Mimoh	This is the workshop, this is where we do the manufacture of hives and we are promoting Langstroth beehives. But when it comes to marketing, we are also helping or supporting the farmers who have different, other types of hives, through our own training, and we help them to improve on the techniques in handling the honey so that they come up with quality honey that conforms to the requirements of the market. Kadenge	Now why do you specifically concentrate or promote Langstroth beehives? Mimoh	Because we came to realise that Langstroth beehives give quality honey and also the production in Langstroth hive is a bit high as compared to the other hives. And especially it is women friendly, because the women can also take up beekeeping. Kadenge	What makes it more friendly to women? Mimoh	Because when it comes to inspections, the hives are placed on hanging stands, which are a bit lower compared to the <b>log</b> <b>hives</b> which were being placed up on top of trees and women cannot climb on top of trees to do inspections. And it is also next to the homestead, and it is very easy for women to carry out inspections. Kadenge	So take us through some of the steps that one needs to take. Mimoh	In fact what has to happen is the beekeeper has to ensure that he has the right equipment to help him manage the hives effectively. So we are talking in terms of the bee suit which is the protective clothing, and we have the smoker, we have the protective gloves and we have the gumboots. So he puts them on and goes to the hive, opening up the hive and checking inside to know what is the progress in the hive, and this will give him the indication of what to do next. Kadenge	And when it comes to observation, what do you need to observe and at what times? Mimoh	Normally inspection is done in the evening because the bees are quite cool at that particular time. So what will happen is, once the farmer goes to the hive in the evening, he has to check the strength of the colony. In that case he will also even see the laying pattern of the queen, which will give him an indication of whether the queen is active or not active. Because if the queen is not active then the laying pattern is so poorly done and the colony is so weak, so getting some good amounts of honey becomes a problem and also the building pattern of the bees becomes too slow. Kadenge	In the event that the laying patterns are poor, what would the farmer need to do? Mimoh	He will definitely know that the colony is a bit weak so he can also do the merging of the colonies or re-queening of the hive. Kadenge	Any other thing that the farmer would observe? Mimoh	If the farmer observes things like pests, he will definitely know what is the remedy I have to take or the action I have to take against this. In case of ants, crawling ants, he should definitely manage his apiary by cutting long grass. He can put also some ash or used oil around the post or modify a pond of water around the post so that the bees can use the water and the pests can drown in the water. Kadenge	Is there any other thing {{that you would like to}} add regarding management of beehives? Mimoh	If you don?t manage your hives then don?t expect a harvest. And this has been a practice that has been taken into account by most of the beekeepers who are born beekeepers. Maybe they just hang their hive, wait for six months and think that they are going to get honey out of it. But we have realised, or that is a challenge we have faced, if you don?t manage your hive very well you don?t get the honey. And you find that is why we are saying the Langstroth hive is women friendly, and the women are really doing very well. And in this case you find that they really take into account the inspections of the hive. And the moment they do that, they are really assured of the harvest and the quality of the honey they produced and the income that is going to be generated from that. You are also promoting nutrition within the families, because they get to know the value of using honey as a nutritional factor within the communities. Kadenge	So how many hives do you manufacture in this particular room in a given time? Mimoh	What I would say is that we work in partnership with non governmental organisations, community based organisations and even the government of Kenya. So what happens with the NGOs and the community groups on the ground, they would give us an order of the hives. So let?s say they have given us an order for 200 hives. We would take even two weeks to manufacture it and send it out. Kadenge	So right now we are looking at how many hives here? Mimoh	Right now we have three hundred. Kadenge	And they are destined to go where? Mimoh	About fifty of them are going to a group in Sudan and some are going to a group in western Kenya and some are going to a group in Mount Kenya.
