25|$|A <b>lavalier</b> {{microphone}} is {{made for}} hands-free operation. These small microphones are worn on the body. Originally, they were held in place with a lanyard worn around the neck, but more often they are fastened to clothing with a clip, pin, tape or magnet. The <b>lavalier</b> cord may be hidden by clothes and either run to an RF transmitter in a pocket or clipped to a belt (for mobile use), or run directly to the mixer (for stationary applications).|$|E
25|$|The term lavaliere (<b>lavalier),</b> {{the name}} for a jeweled pendant necklace, comes from her name (or after Ève Lavallière). In its {{original}} French, a lavallière designates a floppy neck tie tied to form a bow {{at the front of}} the neck (reminiscent of a pussy bow). It was a popular fashion in the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, they {{introduced}} their first digital wireless system, the PGX digital series, augmenting the released previously entry-priced PGX series. The PGX digital wireless system transmits 24-bit/48kHz digital audio and utilizes the 900MHz frequency band, {{and is able}} to operate with up to five systems simultaneously. Like all Shure wireless, it is available with a variety of popular Shure microphone models, or in bodypack configurations for use with <b>lavalier</b> or headset microphones, or connected to an instrument cable.|$|E

5000|$|College dating is {{the set of}} {{behaviors}} and phenomena centered on the seeking out {{and the maintenance of}} romantic relationships in a university setting. It has unique properties that only occur, or occur most frequently, in a campus setting. Such phenomena as hooking up and <b>lavaliering</b> are widely prominent among university and college students. Hooking up is a world wide phenomenon that involves two individuals having a sexual encounter without interest in commitment. <b>Lavaliering</b> is a [...] "pre-engagement" [...] engagement that is a tradition in the Greek life of college campuses. Since fraternities and sororities do not occur much outside of the United States, this occurs, for the most part, only in the US. Technology allows college students to take part in unique ways of finding more partners through social networking. Sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and MySpace allow students to make new friends, and potentially find their spouse.|$|R
50|$|The poffer {{was a white}} tulle {{hat with}} a lace trim. It was {{decorated}} with pearls and white, gold, silver or glass beads called dew drops. It was also adorned with artificial flowers (or artificial fruit in case of older women) and four ribbons (<b>lavaliers)</b> of about 12 cm wide and 60 cm long which hung over the shoulders and the back. The breadth {{and quality of the}} ribbons indicated the wealth of the wearer. The details of the poffer varied from one area to another.|$|R
25|$|An {{electret}} microphone {{is a type}} of condenser microphone, which eliminates the need for a power supply by using a permanently charged material. Electret materials have been known since the 1920s, and were proposed as condenser microphone elements several times, but were considered impractical until the foil electret type was invented at Bell Laboratories in 1962 by Jim West, using a thin metallized Teflon foil. This became the most common type, used in many applications from high-quality recording and <b>lavalier</b> use to built-in microphones in small sound recording devices and telephones.|$|E

5000|$|The series' {{production}} {{sound mixer}} Joshua Anderson, {{who worked on}} Daredevil and Jessica Jones as well, worked to capture as much sound on set with boom mics over <b>lavaliers</b> to ground the unbelievable elements of the series in [...] "naturalistic sound". He noted that Ali's Cottonmouth laugh and many of Colter's lines in particular sounded [...] "incredible on the boom". Anderson also talked about Luke Cage adding a new layer of sound that the other series did not—music, both {{how important it is}} to the show (and so the captured sound needed to be clear to be properly mixed in with the music later) and how it was used on set (with several artists giving live performances in Harlem's Paradise). For the latter, Anderson and his team had experience after working on the musical series Smash.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Lavaliering</b> is a secretive ritual {{between the}} {{fraternity}} and the brother's girlfriend. The brother gives his girlfriend his letters or fraternity's insignia {{in order to}} label her as becoming a sexual possession to him. One young woman explains, [...] "Several brothers came to my dorm room and blindfolded me....My blindfold was eventually removed, and I could see the room was filled with brothers all wearing their robes used for fraternity rituals. The only light was from lit candles around the room. At first I was a bit nervous, but then I saw my boyfriend and knew that {{everything was going to}} be alright." [...] Usually, after the ceremony is completed, the fraternity brother is berated for showing his loyalty to his girlfriend instead of the fraternity house. According to one account, the brother is tied to a bed post in the house, and [...] "someone pours beer down his throat until he vomits. After he vomits, the girlfriend is supposed to kiss him." ...|$|R
2500|$|Scenes {{shot at the}} United Palace theater {{created new}} {{challenges}} for the series' stunt team due to {{not being able to}} drill holes in the historic building for creating anchors for wire rigs and other complex stunts. The crew had to find other ways to weigh down the equipment to remain safe for the actors and stunt doubles. For the explosion at the restaurant [...] "Genghis Connie's", a practical explosion was created in the storefront on location, which was extended with visual effects to show the destruction of the building. A set showing the inside of the rubble of the destroyed building was then created on a soundstage, while a lot was found that [...] "feels" [...] similar to the original location, where rubble could by piled and fire trucks could be brought to show the exterior. The lot was previously being used to store vehicles that had been seized as evidence, with the production having to negotiate with the NYPD to have the vehicles moved elsewhere. Looking back on the filming style of the season, and comparing it to the previous Marvel Netflix series, Weeks said,"You want it to feel like it's all in the same city, all in the same time frame, but you want each show, each character to feel a little different. Have its own visual identity. Some of that is lighting, and of course, some of that is production design and location work ... We embraced Harlem for exactly what it is. The color, the life, the activity on the streets. There's so much character to the neighborhood… I think it was important to feel that these characters were rooted in the real place". The series' production sound mixer Joshua Anderson, who worked on Daredevil and Jessica Jones as well, worked to capture as much sound on set with boom mics over <b>lavaliers</b> to ground the unbelievable elements of the series in [...] "naturalistic sound".

2500|$|Some {{microphones}} {{use other}} connectors, {{such as a}} 5-pin XLR, or mini XLR for connection to portable equipment. Some <b>lavalier</b> (or [...] "lapel", {{from the days of}} attaching the microphone to the news reporters suit lapel) microphones use a proprietary connector for connection to a wireless transmitter, such as a radio pack. Since 2005, professional-quality microphones with USB connections have begun to appear, designed for direct recording into computer-based software.|$|E
2500|$|Due {{to their}} good {{performance}} {{and ease of}} manufacture, hence low cost, {{the vast majority of}} microphones made today are electret microphones; a semiconductor manufacturer estimates annual production at over one billion units. Nearly all cell-phone, computer, PDA and headset microphones are electret types. They are used in many applications, from high-quality recording and <b>lavalier</b> use to built-in microphones in small sound recording devices and telephones. Though electret microphones were once considered low quality, the best ones can now rival traditional condenser microphones in every respect and can even offer the long-term stability and ultra-flat response needed for a measurement microphone. Unlike other capacitor microphones, they require no polarizing voltage, but often contain an integrated preamplifier that does require power (often incorrectly called polarizing power or bias). This preamplifier is frequently phantom powered in sound reinforcement and studio applications. [...] Monophonic microphones designed for personal computer (PC) use, sometimes called multimedia microphones, use a 3.5mm plug as usually used, without power, for stereo; the ring, instead of carrying the signal for a second channel, carries power via a resistor from (normally) a 5V supply in the computer. Stereophonic microphones use the same connector; there is no obvious way to determine which standard is used by equipment and microphones.|$|E
50|$|Moleskin is also {{commonly}} used in video and/or audio productions when using a <b>lavalier</b> microphone. When further concealment of a <b>lavalier</b> microphone is needed in these types of productions, it can be worn underneath a layer or layers of the singer's clothing. This would normally cause the microphone {{to pick up the}} unwanted noises of the singer's clothing rubbing up against the body and top of the <b>lavalier.</b> Attaching a small strip of moleskin around the microphone body will dramatically reduce the amount of noise created by the singer's clothing and, consequently, reduces the amount of unwanted noise picked up by the <b>lavalier</b> microphone.|$|E

50|$|Røde {{offers a}} range of compact {{condenser}} microphones, designed for close miking applications including a headset and two <b>lavalier</b> microphones.The HS1 headset microphone, released in 2010, is constructed from lightweight aluminium and is available in both pink and black versions.In addition to its standard <b>Lavalier</b> microphone, Røde also offers the PinMic <b>lavalier</b> which is designed for discreet miking of subjects. It features a removable capsule head that {{is connected to the}} wired base via a trio of pins, which can be placed through fabric to allow the microphone to be placed anywhere on the subject, as opposed to the limited mounting options of a traditional <b>lavalier.</b> Røde supply an unpainted capsule head mesh with the PinMic (in addition to selling separately) for the user to paint or camouflage as required.Røde’s range of compact wearable microphones all use the company’s proprietary MiCon connection system, which allows for the connection of {{a range of}} different output adaptors. Røde currently offers nine MiCon adaptors making the microphones compatibile with 3.5mm stereo and XLR standard output as well as wireless transmitters from Shure, AKG Acoustics, Audio Technica, Sennheiser, MIPRO, Audix, Sony and Lectrosonics.|$|E
50|$|A <b>lavalier</b> or lavaliere or lavalliere is an item {{of jewelry}} {{consisting}} of a pendant, sometimes with one stone, suspended from a necklace.|$|E
5000|$|In {{television}} and documentary applications, the <b>lavalier</b> will typically be clipped {{to an article}} of the subject's clothing, such as a tie, jacket or collar. In narrative motion picture usage, lavs are almost always hidden under clothing to conceal {{the fact that the}} person is mic'ed. The boom microphone typically sounds [...] "better" [...] and more natural than a <b>lavalier</b> mic and is always a soundperson's first choice; however, for exterior location shooting, it often may be more practical to use a <b>lavalier.</b> One such situation would be during a wide shot that forces the boom operator to keep a distance from the speaker that isn't close enough to achieve a good signal-to-noise ratio with the microphone. In that instance, a lav mic hidden on the speaker due to its proximity would achieve good signal-to-noise ratio for recording of speech. When <b>lavalier</b> microphones need to be concealed under clothing, the possibility of material scratching against the microphone is a certain risk. To minimize this problem, sound recordists sometimes wrap the head of the microphones in moleskin or place it inside a hollow-centered, column-shaped sponge and place it under a placard, behind a button, or within the knot of a tie.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lavalier</b> {{microphones}} {{are attached}} differently {{depending on the}} nature of their use. In theater applications where the microphone is used to amplify an actor or a singer's voice, lavs are typically concealed in the performer's hair; this placement eliminates the possibility of scratching against their clothing while they move, which would result in the amplification of the scratching sounds as well. It also adds to the suspension of disbelief, since the characters themselves would not be wearing microphones, especially if the plot is set in a time before <b>lavalier</b> microphones existed. Occasionally, specially designed skin-color headsets known as [...] "headworn microphones" [...] are used in stage applications when actors spend a good deal of their performance singing and moving around quickly, such as in stage musicals and in lecture or presentation scenarios. A headworn microphone is essentially a <b>lavalier</b> on a stiff wire mount that loops over the performer's ear.|$|E
50|$|A <b>lavalier</b> {{microphone}} or <b>lavalier</b> (also {{known as}} a lav, lapel mic, clip mic, body mic, collar mic, neck mic or personal mic) is a small microphone used for television, theatre, and public speaking applications {{in order to allow}} for hands-free operation. They are most commonly provided with small clips for attaching to collars, ties, or other clothing. The cord may be hidden by clothes and either run to a radio frequency transmitter kept in a pocket or clipped to a belt, or routed directly to the mixer or a recording device.|$|E
5000|$|In a 1984 study {{administered}} by Cornell University's College of Arts and Sciences, {{it was found}} that the use of <b>lavalier</b> microphones in an academic setting was beneficial to the dissemination of information. By allowing a presenter to move freely in a presenting space, the <b>lavalier</b> microphone allows the presenter to offer continuous visual stimulation to the audience, enabling the speaker to hold their attention longer or more easily. Even in smaller applications where the audience contained fewer than twenty-five attendees, the lack of restrictions on the hands proved to offer similar visual stimulation in capturing and maintaining attention.|$|E
