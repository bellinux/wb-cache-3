25|$|The {{expression}} of the viral late genes, L1 and L2, is exclusively restricted to differentiating keratinocytes in the outermost layers of the skin or mucosal surface. The increased {{expression of}} L1 and L2 is typically correlated with {{a dramatic increase in}} the number of copies of the viral genome. Since the outer layers of stratified squamous epithelia are subject to relatively limited surveillance by cells of the immune system, it is thought that this restriction of viral <b>late</b> <b>gene</b> expression represents a form of immune evasion.|$|E

Experiments were conducted using three genotypes of tomato plants: wildtype (WT), (LapA-SI) plants that were silenced for LAP-A, and LapA-OX that constitutively expressed LAP-A. Late-gene expression was inhibited in wounded LapA-SI plants, and the LapA-SI plants were also more susceptible to tobacco hornworm feeding, relative to wildtype (WT) plants. In comparison, the wounded LapA-OX leaves exhibited heightened levels of <b>late</b> <b>gene</b> RNA accumulation, an increased resistance to herbivory, and extended expression of late wound-response genes. These data suggest that LAP-A functions in regulating both the intensity and the persistence of the late wound response.

40|$|Abstract Background The NF-κB family plays a {{prominent}} role in the innate immune response, cell cycle activation or cell apoptosis. Upon stimulation by pathogen-associated patterns, such as viral RNA a kinase cascade is activated, which strips the NF-κB of its inhibitor IκBα molecule and allows it to translocate into the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, it activates transcription of approximately 90 genes whose kinetics of expression differ relative to when NF-κB translocates into the nucleus, referred to as Early, Middle and <b>Late</b> <b>genes.</b> It is not obvious what mechanism is responsible for segregation of the genes’ timing of transcriptional response. Results It is likely that the differences in timing are due, in part, to the number and type of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS), required for NF-κB itself {{as well as for the}} putative cofactors, in the Early versus <b>Late</b> <b>genes.</b> We therefore applied an evolutionary analysis of conserved TFBS. We also examined whether transcription dynamic was related to the presence of AU-rich elements (ARE) located in 3 ′UTR of the mRNA because recent studies have shown that the presence of AREs is associated with rapid gene induction. We found that Early genes were significantly enriched in NF-κB binding sites occurring in evolutionarily conserved domains compared to <b>genes</b> in the <b>Late</b> group. We also found that Early genes had significantly greater number of ARE sequences in the 3 ′UTR of the gene. The similarities observed among the Early genes were seen in comparison with distant species, while the <b>Late</b> <b>genes</b> promoter regions were much more diversified. Based on the promoter structure and ARE content, Middle genes can be divided into two subgroups which show similarities to Early and <b>Late</b> <b>genes</b> respectively. Conclusions Our data suggests that the rapid response of the NF-κB dependent Early genes may be due to both increased gene transcription due to NF-κB loading as well as the contribution of mRNA instability to the transcript profiles. Wider phylogenetic analysis of NF-κB dependent genes provides insight into the degree of cross-species similarity found in the Early genes, opposed to many differences in promoter structure that can be found among the <b>Late</b> <b>genes.</b> These data suggest that activation and expression of the <b>Late</b> <b>genes</b> is much more species-specific than of the Early genes. </p...|$|R

In situ hybridization experiments showed that, like the PsENOD 3 and PsENOD 14 genes, the PsNOD 6 gene is only {{expressed in the}} infected cell type. The PsNOD 6 gene is first expressed at the transition of the pre-fixation zone II into the interzone II–III (the amyloplast-rich zone preceding the fixation zone III), whereas the early nodulin genes PsENOD 3 and PsENOD 14 are already induced in the pre-fixation zone II. Thus these nodulin genes encoding homologous proteins are induced at consecutive stages of nodule development. The expression of the <b>late</b> nodulin <b>genes</b> encoding leghaemoglobin precedes {{the expression of the}} <b>late</b> nodulin <b>gene</b> PsNOD 6.

40|$|Satellite {{bacteriophage}} P 4 {{requires the}} products of the <b>late</b> <b>genes</b> of a helper such as P 2 in order to grow lytically. The Escherichia coli rpoA 109 mutation, which alters the alpha subunit of RNA polymerase, prevents transcription of the <b>late</b> <b>genes</b> of bacteriophage P 2. Suppressor mutations that define the P 2 ogr gene overcome this block. We found that P 4 lytic growth using a P 2 ogr+ prophage helper was prevented by the rpoA 109 mutation but that this block was overcome when the P 2 helper carried the suppressor mutation in the ogr gene. Furthermore, we isolated and characterized four independent mutations in P 4, called org, that suppress the E. coli rpoA 109 mutation by allowing P 4 lytic growth using a P 2 ogr+ helper. DNA sequence analysis revealed that the four independent org mutations are identical and that they occur in the P 4 delta gene, which codes for a factor that positively regulates the transcription of the P 2 and P 4 <b>late</b> <b>genes.</b> delta is predicted to code for a basic 166 -amino-acid residue protein. Each 83 -residue half of the predicted delta gene product is similar to the predicted 72 -residue proteins encoded by the ogr gene of P 2 and the B gene of phage 186...|$|R

40|$|Bacteriophage T 4 {{containing}} nonsense {{mutations in}} <b>late</b> <b>genes</b> {{was found to}} be genetically complemented by four conjugate T 4 genes (7, 11, 23, or 24) located on plasmid or phage vectors. Complementation was at a very low level unless the infecting phage carried a denB mutation (which abolishes T 4 DNA endonuclease IV activity). In most experiments, the infecting phage also had a denA mutation, which abolishes T 4 DNA endonuclease II activity. Mutations in the alc/unf gene (which allow dCMP-containing T 4 <b>late</b> <b>genes</b> to be expressed) further increased complementation efficiency. Most of the alc/unf mutant phage strains used for these experiments were constructed to incorporate a gene 56 mutation, which blocks dCTP breakdown and allows replication to generate dCMP-containing T 4 DNA. Effects of the alc/unf: 56 mutant combination on complementation efficiency varied among the different T 4 <b>late</b> <b>genes.</b> Despite regions of homology, ranging from 2 to 14 kilobase pairs, between cloned T 4 genes and infecting genomes, the rate of formation of recombinants after T 4 den:alc phage infection was generally low (higher for two mutants in gene 23, lower for mutants in gene 7 and 11). More significantly, when gene 23 complementation had to be preceded by recombination, the complementation efficiency was drastically reduced. We conclude that high complementation efficiency of cloned T 4 <b>late</b> <b>genes</b> need not depend on prior complete breakage-reunion events which transpose those genes from the resident plasmid to a late promoter on the infecting T 4 genome. The presence of the intact gene 23 on plasmids reduced the yield of T 4 phage. The magnitude of this negative complementation effect varied in different plasmids; in the extreme case (plasmid pLA 3), an almost 10 -fold reduction of yield was observed. The cells can thus be said to have been made partly nonpermissive for this lytic virus by incorporating a part of the viral genome...|$|R
40|$|The {{herpes simplex}} virus type 1 immediate-early protein, ICP 4, is the major {{transcriptional}} activator of viral early and <b>late</b> <b>genes.</b> ICP 4 {{has been shown to}} bind DNA and interact with components of the general transcription machinery to activate or repress viral transcription, depending on promoter context. Microarray and northern blot analysis indicated that the abundance of the basal Pol II transcription machinery was significantly altered at late times of infection. Because viral early and <b>late</b> <b>genes</b> have very different promoter architectures, the cellular requirements for ICP 4 -mediated activation of early and <b>late</b> <b>genes</b> may differ. In testing this hypothesis using tk and gC as representative early and late promoters respectively, the general transcription factor TFIIA was found not to be required for ICP 4 activation of the late gC promoter but was essential for activation of the early tk promoter. An intact INR element was required for TFIIA to be dispensable for ICP 4 activation of the gC promoter. In the presence of TFIIA, ICP 4 overcame the requirement for an intact INR on the gC promoter enhancing ICP 4 activation of an INR-mutated gC promoter. When examining the binding properties of TFIIA, ICP 4 and TBP/TFIID on early, late, and INR-mutated late promoters, ICP 4 could only effectively substitute for TFIIA in stabilizing the binding of TFIID to the TATA box of the late promoter containing a functional INR. ICP 4 required the additional activities of TFIIA to stabilize the binding of TFIID to the TATA box of an INR-mutated late promoter. Additionally, microarray and northern blot analysis indicated that TFIIA expression was reduced at late times of infection. The decrease in TFIIA expression during infection, the ability of ICP 4 to substitute for TFIIA in stabilizing TFIID binding to an INR-containing late promoter, and its dispensability for activation of late but not early genes suggests a mechanism for the shutoff of early gene expression while allowing the continued expression of <b>late</b> <b>genes...</b>|$|R
