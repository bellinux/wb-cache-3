5000|$|A {{major feature}} of the park is its splash {{fountain}} that orchestrates animated water, sound and lighting. Journalist <b>Linda</b> <b>Gradstein</b> {{described it as a}} landscape of [...] "spouting water geysers" [...] just outside the walls of the Old City. Water shoots from the fountains in sync with music every 30 minutes; in the evening a light show plays while during the day children run among the water spouts. The music was composed by the New Jerusalem Orchestra and the East West Ensemble (Yisrael Borochov) incorporating themes from Jewish, Arab and African musical traditions. [...] The fountain was donated by Alan Hassenfeld, philanthropist and former Hasbro Toys chairman. The fountain is noted as a place where people from every segment of Jerusalem's ethnically and religiously varied population mingle with visitors from around the globe. The water feature concept was developed by St√©phane Llorca of JML Consultants.|$|E
