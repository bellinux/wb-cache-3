The notion of neutrosophic set <b>linear</b> <b>algebras</b> and neutrosophic neutrosophic set <b>linear</b> <b>algebras</b> are introduced and their properties analysed in chapter two. Chapter three introduces {{the notion of}} neutrosophic semigroup <b>linear</b> <b>algebras</b> and neutrosophic group <b>linear</b> <b>algebras.</b> A study of their substructures are systematically carried out in this chapter. The fuzzy analogue of neutrosophic group <b>linear</b> <b>algebras,</b> neutrosophic semigroup <b>linear</b> <b>algebras</b> and neutrosophic set <b>linear</b> <b>algebras</b> are introduced in chapter four of this book. Chapter five introduces the concept of neutrosophic group bivector spaces, neutrosophic bigroup <b>linear</b> <b>algebras,</b> neutrosophic semigroup (bisemigroup) <b>linear</b> <b>algebras</b> and neutrosophic biset bivector spaces. The fuzzy analogue of these concepts are given in chapter six. An interesting feature of this book is it contains nearly 424 examples of these new notions. The final chapter suggests over 160 problems which is another interesting feature of this book. Comment: 286 page...|$|R

5|$|Fields {{serve as}} {{foundational}} notions in several mathematical domains. This includes different branches of analysis, {{which are based}} on fields with additional structure. Basic theorems in analysis hinge on the structural properties of the field of real numbers. Most importantly for algebraic purposes, any field may be used as the scalars for a vector space, which is the standard general context for <b>linear</b> <b>algebra.</b> Number fields, the siblings of the field of rational numbers, are studied in depth in number theory. Function fields can help describe properties of geometric objects.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{fundamental}} group or the higher homotopy groups of a space, homology groups are important topological invariants. Although some (co)homology theories are computable using tools of <b>linear</b> <b>algebra,</b> many other important (co)homology theories, especially singular (co)homology, are not computable directly from their definition for nontrivial spaces. For singular (co)homology, the singular (co)chains and (co)cycles groups are often {{too big to}} handle directly. More subtle and indirect approaches become necessary. The Mayer–Vietoris sequence is such an approach, giving partial information about the (co)homology groups of any space by relating it to the (co)homology groups of two of its subspaces and their intersection.|$|E
5|$|Many theorems {{were first}} {{established}} for small matrices only, {{for example the}} Cayley–Hamilton theorem was proved for 2×2 matrices by Cayley in the aforementioned memoir, and by Hamilton for 4×4 matrices.

Also {{at the end of}} the 19th century the Gauss–Jordan elimination (generalizing a special case now known as Gauss elimination) was established by Jordan.

40|$|In {{this book}} we use only special types of {{intervals}} and introduce {{the notion of}} different types of interval <b>linear</b> <b>algebras</b> and interval vector spaces using the intervals of the form [0, a] where the intervals are from Zn or Z+ ∪ 0 or Q+ ∪ 0 or R+ ∪ 0. A systematic development is made starting from set interval vector spaces to group interval vector spaces. Vector spaces are taken as interval polynomials or interval matrices or just intervals over suitable sets or semigroups or groups. Main feature of this book is the authors have given over 350 examples. This book has six chapters. Chapter one is introductory in nature. Chapter two introduces the notion of set interval <b>linear</b> <b>algebras</b> of type one and two. Set fuzzy interval <b>linear</b> <b>algebras</b> and their algebras and their properties are discussed in chapter three. Chapter four introduces several types of interval linear bialgebras and bivector spaces and studies them. The possible applications are given in chapter five.

5|$|Vector spaces {{have many}} {{applications}} as they occur frequently in common circumstances, namely wherever functions with values in some field are involved. They {{provide a framework}} to deal with analytical and geometrical problems, or {{are used in the}} Fourier transform. This list is not exhaustive: many more applications exist, for example in optimization. The minimax theorem of game theory stating the existence of a unique payoff when all players play optimally can be formulated and proven using vector spaces methods. Representation theory fruitfully transfers the good understanding of <b>linear</b> <b>algebra</b> and vector spaces to other mathematical domains such as group theory.|$|E

We can again replace the set N with a cardinal number n to get V'n, although without choosing a specific standard set with cardinality n, this is defined only up to isomorphism. Taking V to be the field R of real numbers (thought of as a vector space over itself) and n to be some natural number, we get the vector space that is most commonly studied in <b>linear</b> <b>algebra,</b> the real vector space Rn.|$|E
5|$|Vector {{spaces are}} the subject of <b>linear</b> <b>algebra</b> and are well {{characterized}} by their dimension, which, roughly speaking, specifies the number of independent directions in the space. Infinite-dimensional vector spaces arise naturally in mathematical analysis, as function spaces, whose vectors are functions. These vector spaces are generally endowed with additional structure, which may be a topology, allowing the consideration of issues of proximity and continuity. Among these topologies, those that are defined by a norm or inner product are more commonly used, as having a notion of distance between two vectors. This is particularly the case of Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces, which are fundamental in mathematical analysis.|$|E

The basis conjecture for <b>linear</b> <b>algebras</b> over fields of characteristic zero and for even values of n would follow from another conjecture on Latin squares by Alon and Tarsi.

5|$|Isaac Newton had demonstrated, using prisms, {{that white}} lights, such as sunlight, are {{composed}} {{of a number of}} monochromatic components which could then be recombined into white light. Newton also showed that an orange paint made of yellow and red could look exactly like a monochromatic orange light, although being composed of two monochromatic yellow and red lights. Hence the paradox that puzzled physicists of the time: two complex lights (composed of more than one monochromatic light) could look alike but be physically different, called metameres. Thomas Young later proposed that this paradox could be explained by colours being perceived through a limited number of channels in the eyes, which he proposed to be threefold, the trichromatic colour theory. Maxwell used the recently developed <b>Linear</b> <b>algebra</b> to prove Young's theory. Any monochromatic light stimulating three receptors should be able to be equally stimulated by a set of three different monochromatic lights (in fact, by any set of three different lights). He demonstrated that to be the case, inventing colour matching experiments and Colourimetry.|$|E

This quotient group measures difference between the geometric equivalence and automorphic equivalence of algebras from this variety. In the all considered varieties of the <b>linear</b> <b>algebras</b> this group is generated by cosets which are presented by no more than two kinds of the strongly stable automorphisms of our category. One kind of automorphisms is connected to the changing of the multiplication by scalar and second one is connected to the changing of the multiplication of the elements of the algebras.
