During winter, {{the area is}} accessible from Longyearbyen, either by snowmobile or by ski. There are several older trapper cabins in the park, {{and some of these}} are lent to residents of Longyearbyen. Except for Einsteinvatnet, a lake with Arctic char, there are few destinations within the park, although the park {{can be used as a}} basis for other destinations. This includes trips to Perriertoppen, Svalbard's second-highest peak, and the glacier Åsgårdsfonna. Because of the shape of the park, there is <b>little</b> <b>good</b> hiking within the park, except for walking along the beaches on either side of the fjord. It is possible to see the entire national park from Mittag-Lefflerbreen, which can be hiked to from Pyramiden.|$|E
5|$|For the Coalition, the Russians were secure on {{the north}} bank of the Danube, {{awaiting}} reinforcements from Galicia; the bridges between Linz and Vienna had been destroyed, making French access to the Austrian capital more difficult, but not impossible. After six months of fighting in which the Austrians had enjoyed <b>little</b> <b>good</b> news, the Coalition could claim a difficult and timely victory. The French had retreated from the field with a badly mauled division and Kutuzov had secured the right flank. Indeed, Francis was so pleased with the outcome at Dürenstein that he awarded Kutuzov the Military Order of Maria Theresa.|$|E

25|$|Towards {{the middle}} of this final section Rousseau reasons that the theatre does very <b>little</b> <b>good</b> for the poor, who cannot afford the taxes {{required}} to support a theatre. Geneva, which already has a large degree of inequality, does not need any more. Rousseau continues to say that actors coming to the town of Geneva will be indifferent to the town's morality, and will quickly corrupt it. Even though there are other forms of entertainment in Geneva that exemplify bad manners, Rousseau claims that none of these areas are more destructive to the people's good taste than the theatre. The best alternative to theatres is open-air festivals, in nature, to provide a unifying, patriotic spirit.|$|E
25|$|Horve {{decided to}} take the enemy ship as a prize and bring it to a British port. Since Draug had almost no {{anti-aircraft}} weapons to speak of, and the skies were full of enemy aircraft, the destroyer could do <b>little</b> <b>good</b> by remaining where she was. He ignored an order from Naval Command to go to the Hardangerfjord and block German naval forces from gaining access to that fjord. As Horve knew that the Naval Command headquarters in Bergen had been captured by the German invaders, he assumed that the order was false, although it later turned out it was not. When ordered to steer his ship towards Britain, the captain of Main refused, only yielding after the Norwegian warship fired several warning shots and threatened to torpedo him.|$|E
25|$|While the Oilers found instant {{success in}} the AFL, other teams did not fare as well. The Oakland Raiders and New York Titans {{struggled}} {{on and off the}} field during their first few seasons in the league. Oakland's eight-man ownership group was reduced to just three in 1961, after heavy financial losses in their first season. Attendance for home games was poor, partly due to the team playing in the San Francisco Bay Area—which already had an established NFL team (the San Francisco 49ers)—but the product on the field was also to blame. After winning six games in their debut season, the Raiders won a total of three times in the 1961 and 1962 seasons. Oakland took part in a 1961 supplemental draft meant to boost the weaker teams in the league, but it did <b>little</b> <b>good.</b> They participated in another such draft in 1962.|$|E

25|$|Union {{casualties}} were 3,798 (504 killed, 1,881 wounded, 1,413 missing or captured), Confederate 1,491 (361 killed, 727 wounded, 403 missing or captured). Many of the Union losses were suffered by Ferrero's {{division of the}} United States Colored Troops. Both {{the black and white}} wounded prisoners were taken to the Confederate hospital at Poplar Lawn in Petersburg. Meade brought charges against Burnside, and a subsequent court of inquiry censured Burnside along with Brig. Gens. Ledlie, Ferrero, Orlando B. Willcox, and Col. Zenas R. Bliss. Burnside was never again assigned to duty. Although he was as responsible for the defeat as Burnside, Meade escaped immediate censure. However, in early 1865, the Congressional Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War exonerated Burnside and condemned Meade for changing the plan of attack (which did <b>little</b> <b>good</b> for Burnside, whose reputation was ruined). As for Mahone, the victory, won largely due to his efforts in supporting Johnson's stunned men, earned him a lasting {{reputation as one of the}} best young generals of Lee's army in the war's last year.|$|E

500|$|After Sirens, Etty's output {{remained}} {{as high as}} ever, with seven paintings exhibited at the 1838 Summer Exhibition, but {{the quality of his}} work is generally considered to have gone into decline. By 1838 critics began to comment that Etty's paintings were no longer inventive but simply reworkings of his earlier paintings, while in June of that year William Makepeace Thackeray (under the pen name of Michael Angelo Titmarsh) wrote that [...] is, like great men, lazy, or indifferent, perhaps, about public approbation". By 1839, criticisms of Etty were being raised in even those newspapers and journals which had previously championed his work. A new type of criticism of Etty also began to appear in 1839, from a new generation led by The Art Union, who praised Etty's technical abilities but saw his choice of subjects as out of touch and anachronistic, and [...] "very frequently doing as <b>little</b> <b>good</b> for mankind as the priest who preaches his sermon in Latin".|$|E
500|$|... "Funeral" [...] was {{met with}} a wide range of reviews, from highly {{enthusiastic}} to harshly critical. Lisa Respers France of CNN said it was [...] "one of the best episodes ever", and MTV's Aly Semigran called it [...] "authentic" [...] and [...] "one of the very best" [...] of the season if not the series as a whole. Robert Canning of IGN wrote that it was [...] "a great episode that truly showcased the talents of Jane Lynch" [...] and rated it 8.5 out of 10. Rolling Stone Erica Futterman said that the episode [...] "felt like a recycled version of things we've seen previously" [...] and added that the show is [...] "not as entertaining when it's simply a showcase". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a [...] "C" [...] and characterized the funeral scene as [...] "the highlight of an uneven episode". The Atlantic Kevin Fallon wrote, [...] "Killing off Sue's sister seemed cruel, but ultimately paid off—it's too bad the episode completely derailed afterward, dying its own rapid death in turn." [...] Anthony Benigno of The Faster Times had <b>little</b> <b>good</b> to say, and singled out the writers for doing [...] "such a crappy job" [...] on the penultimate episode of the season.|$|E
500|$|Instead {{of serving}} at sea, he {{spent time in}} the House of Lords, where he spoke in {{opposition}} to the abolition of slavery, which although not legal in the United Kingdom still existed in the British colonies. Freedom would do the slaves <b>little</b> <b>good,</b> he argued. He had travelled widely and, in his eyes, the living standard among freemen in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland was worse than that among slaves in the West Indies. His experience in the Caribbean, where he [...] "quickly absorbed the plantation owners' views about slavery", lent weight to his position, which was perceived as well-argued and just by some of his contemporaries. In his first speech before Parliament he called himself [...] "an attentive observer {{of the state of the}} negroes" [...] who found them well cared for and [...] "in a state of humble happiness". Others thought it [...] "shocking that so young a man, under no bias of interest, should be earnest in continuance of the slave trade". In his speech to the House of Lords, William insulted William Wilberforce, the leading abolitionist, saying: [...] "the proponents of the abolition are either fanatics or hypocrites, and in one of those classes I rank Mr. Wilberforce".|$|E

500|$|McKinley {{first took}} his congressional seat in October 1877, when President Hayes summoned Congress into special session. With the Republicans in the minority, McKinley was given {{unimportant}} committee assignments, which he undertook conscientiously. McKinley's friendship with Hayes did McKinley <b>little</b> <b>good</b> on Capitol Hill; the President was not well-regarded by many leaders there. The young congressman broke with Hayes {{on the question}} of the currency, but it did not affect their friendship. The United States had effectively been placed on the gold standard by the Coinage Act of 1873; when silver prices dropped significantly, many sought to make silver again a legal tender, equally with gold. Such a course would be inflationary, but advocates argued that the economic benefits of the increased money supply would be worth the inflation; opponents warned that [...] "free silver" [...] would not bring the promised benefits and would harm the United States in international trade. McKinley voted for the Bland–Allison Act of 1878, which mandated large government purchases of silver for striking into money, and also joined the large majorities in each house that overrode Hayes' veto of the legislation. In so doing, McKinley voted against the position of the House Republican leader, his fellow Ohioan and friend, James Garfield.|$|E
500|$|Under Idaho law, conspirators were {{considered}} to be legally present {{at the scene of the}} crime. Using this provision, the local county prosecutor in Idaho drew up extradition papers for Haywood, Moyer, and George Pettibone which described them as having been physically present in Idaho at the time of the murder, which they were not. [...] McParland arrived in Denver on Thursday, February 15, and presented the extradition papers to Colorado Governor McDonald, who, by prior arrangement with the governor of Idaho, accepted them immediately. But Denver sheriff's deputies waited until Saturday evening to arrest Haywood, Pettigrew, and Moyer, then held the three in the Denver Jail, and refused requests by the three to contact lawyers and family. When reporters began asking questions at the Denver Jail, the three prisoners were secretly taken to the Oxford Hotel, where they were held overnight. Early Sunday morning the prisoners were put on a special train, and guarded by Colorado militia, were sped to Idaho. Unionists regarded the incident to be a kidnapping, to extradite them to Idaho before the courts in Denver could intervene. The events were so extraordinary that even American Federation of Labor president Samuel Gompers, who had <b>little</b> <b>good</b> to say about the WFM, directed his union to raise funds for the defense. However, the U.S. Supreme Court denied a habeas corpus appeal (George Pettibone v. Jasper C Nichols), ruling that the arrest and extradition were legal, with only Justice Joseph McKenna dissenting.|$|E
500|$|For {{hundreds}} of years, abdominal gunshot wounds had meant death by gangrene or other infection, with doctors {{able to do}} little more than ease pain. [...] Only seventeen years previously, Dr. Emil Kocher, a Swiss surgeon, had been the first to successfully operate on a patient who had received such a wound. [...] To increase the lighting, sunlight was reflected onto the wound by another physician; {{towards the end of the}} surgery, a better light was rigged. [...] The hospital lacked basic surgical equipment such as retractors. [...] With McKinley in a weakened condition, Mann could do little probing of the wound to try to find the bullet; his work was complicated by the fact that the President was obese. [...] The surgeon made an incision in the President's skin, and found and removed a small piece of cloth which was embedded in the flesh. [...] He probed with his finger and hand, finding damage to the digestive system—the stomach displayed both an entry and exit wound. [...] Mann sewed up both holes in the organ, but could not find the bullet itself; he concluded it had lodged in the President's back muscles. [...] He later wrote, [...] "A bullet once it ceases to move does little harm." [...] A primitive X-ray machine was on display at the fair but was not used on McKinley; Mann later stated that its use might have disturbed the patient and done <b>little</b> <b>good.</b> [...] He used black silk thread to stitch the incision and wound, without drainage, and covered the area with a bandage. [...] As the operation concluded, Dr. Park arrived from Niagara Falls; he was unwilling to interfere and at 5:20, McKinley was given another shot of painkiller and allowed to awaken. [...] He was taken to the Milburn House by the electric ambulance. [...] The First Lady had not been told of the President's shooting; once the surgery was complete, the presidential physician, Presley M. Rixey, gently told her what had occurred. [...] Ida McKinley took the news calmly; she wrote in her diary, [...] "Went to Niagra [...] Falls this morning. [...] My Dearest was receiving in a public hall on our return, when he was shot by a ... Leech, in her biography of President McKinley, suggests that the First Lady could not write the word, [...] "anarchist".|$|E
