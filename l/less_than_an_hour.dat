5|$|During an altercation on {{a crowded}} subway platform, John Lange (Vincent D'Onofrio) falls against a moving train and is pinned at waist level between a subway car and {{the edge of the}} platform.

Although Lange is not feeling much pain, emergency personnel tell the detectives he has <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> to live and will die as soon as he is moved. Bayliss questions Larry Biedron (Bruce MacVittie), who was involved with the altercation that led to Lange's fall. Biedron says he was bumped from behind with Lange, but witnesses give conflicting reports: Some say that Biedron pushed Lange, some that Lange pushed Biedron, and others say that it was an accident. Pembleton tries to talk to Lange, who becomes uncooperative and angry when told he will die.|$|E

Layton was bitten by the snake on his index finger while it was being put into a jar, but he didn't realize he'd been bitten. He thought the snake had only brushed his hand. Approximately 30 minutes after being bitten Layton complained of blurred vision. He collapsed and {{died of a heart attack}}, nearly an hour after being bitten.

5|$|Ring was {{overlooked}} for the Second Test at Lord's as Bradman {{retained the}} same XI, despite the incumbent spinner Johnson managing only 1/85 in the First Test. Australia won convincingly by 409runs. The next match was against Surrey, starting {{the day after}} the finish of the Test. Ring took 3/51 from 21.2 overs in the first innings, leading the way in terms of wickets and overs; most of the Test bowlers were given a light workload. He then contributed an unbeaten 15 in Australia's first innings of 389. After Australia took a first innings lead of 168, Ring bowled another 24 overs in the second innings and took 1/54. He twice dismissed Jack Parker, who had top-scored in each innings with 76 and 81.

5|$|Sixteen {{isotopes}} of mendelevium are known, {{with mass}} numbers from 245 to 260; all are radioactive. Additionally, five nuclear isomers are known: 245mMd, 247mMd, 249mMd, 254mMd, and 258mMd. Of these, the longest-lived isotope is 258Md with a half-life of 51.5days, and the longest-lived isomer is 258mMd with a half-life of 58.0minutes. Nevertheless, the slightly shorter-lived 256Md (half-life 1.17hours) {{is more often}} used in chemical experimentation {{because it can be}} produced in larger quantities from alpha particle irradiation of einsteinium. After 258Md, the next most stable mendelevium isotopes are 260Md with a half-life of 31.8days, 257Md with a half-life of 5.52hours, 259Md with a half-life of 1.60hours, and 256Md with a half-life of 1.17hours. All of the remaining mendelevium isotopes have half-lives that are <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 5minutes.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} against Surrey {{and started the}} day after the Second Test. As the Test players were tired, Bradman gave them a lighter {{workload}} and assigned Hamence and Loxton to open the bowling. Both took two wickets and Hamence snared opposing captain Laurie Fishlock and Eric Bedser to end with 2/24. Brown injured a finger while fielding, so {{he was not able to}} bat in Australia's first innings. Hamence was thus elevated to open the batting. Hamence made a duck, but Australia nevertheless took a 168-run lead. Hamence opened the bowling for the second time, although he was unable to take a wicket and ended with 0/30. In the second innings, Harvey volunteered to play as a makeshift opener alongside Loxton and they chased down the 122 runs for victory in <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> to complete a 10-wicket win.|$|E
