40|$|The year-round {{demand for}} commercially {{produced}} vegetables in South-East Asia is growing rapidly because of ongoing {{population growth and}} urbanisation. Vegetable production {{plays an important role}} in the rural economy of the Red River Delta, the economic centre of northern Vietnam. Field vegetables, however, are often grown in the cool season from October to January, in rotation with wet rice in the cool and the hot season from February to September. As this often causes seasonality of vegetable supply, we designed alternative cropping systems, with the aim to develop year-round supply for big cities such as Hanoi, to increase farmers’ income and to limit pest and disease incidence. Data on profit, <b>labour</b> <b>requirement</b> and costs of pesticide use of 42 vegetable crops grown in the Red River Delta were collected. From these data, five different permanent vegetable production systems were designed based on the following scenarios: (i) increase profit, (ii) reduce <b>labour</b> <b>requirement,</b> (iii) decrease the costs of pesticide use, (iv) maximize crop biodiversity, and (v) select crops with low perishable products, respectively. From May 2007 to May 2009, these systems were tested in the field and compared with the traditional system in which vegetable production in the cool season was rotated with wet rice cultivation in the cool and hot season. Profits of the high profit system and of the low <b>labour</b> <b>requirement</b> system was higher than that of the traditional system.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{number of}} farm-based biogas plants in Austria {{increased}} {{rapidly in the}} recent past, a continuing interest in this technology is expected. A survey {{was carried out in}} 2002 to provide information for farmers and the decision makers involved. In most plants slurry and manure is co-digestion with energy crops and/or organic waste. Wet fermentation in mesophilic digesters with post-digesters combined with separate storage tanks is the main technology used. The trapped biogas is utilized in CHP-units and the electricity is sold to the grid. The waste heat is supplied to the farm and farm house, only a few sell it for district heating. The <b>labour</b> <b>requirement</b> depends on the fermented feedstock. Slurry and manure cause the lowest and the co-digestion of organic waste the highest <b>labour</b> <b>requirement.</b> The survey results indicate a distinct decrease in investment costs per unit. On average 75 % of the capacity of the farm-based biogas plants are used. Most farmers intend to increase production at higher electricity prices.

The findings revealed that less number of labour per hectare is required to complete the production process by mechanized farm compared to traditional farm. Family labour is mostly affected by the mechanization. Animal power and output have positive effect on <b>labour</b> <b>requirement,</b> while power tiller and input costs have adverse effect on <b>labour</b> <b>requirement</b> for wheat cultivation.
