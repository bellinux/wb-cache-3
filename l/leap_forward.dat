5|$|After {{the end of}} the Great <b>Leap</b> <b>Forward,</b> Pan was rehabilitated in 1962 {{and became}} the minister-level {{director}} of the All China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives.|$|E
5|$|During the Great <b>Leap</b> <b>Forward,</b> Pan {{sympathized with}} Marshal Peng Dehuai, {{a critic of}} Mao Zedong's {{collectivization}} policy. As a result, in 1958 he was dismissed as party chief of Henan and subjected to persecution, but was later rehabilitated.|$|E
5|$|Concorde's {{technical}} <b>leap</b> <b>forward</b> {{boosted the}} public's understanding of conflicts between {{technology and the}} environment as well as awareness of the complex decision analysis processes that surround such conflicts. In France, the use of acoustic fencing alongside TGV tracks {{might not have been}} achieved without the 1970s controversy over aircraft noise. In the UK, the CPRE has issued tranquillity maps since 1990.|$|E
60|$|The elderly gentleman had <b>leaped</b> <b>forward</b> with {{an exclamation}} of earnest thankfulness, and {{unrolled}} the blanket.|$|R
60|$|Shouting {{to some of}} our wounded {{to watch}} the women, I drew my sword and <b>leapt</b> <b>forward.</b>|$|R
60|$|Joan {{slipped out}} of her saddle and, tearing off the mask, she <b>leaped</b> <b>forward</b> with a little sob.|$|R
5|$|During the Anti-Rightist Movement and the Great <b>Leap</b> <b>Forward,</b> Pan Fusheng {{sympathized with}} Marshal Peng Dehuai, who criticized Mao's {{disastrous}} collectivization policies. As a result, {{he became a}} major target of persecution by the fervent Mao loyalist Wu Zhipu, the Second Secretary of Henan, {{with the approval of}} the CPC Central Committee.|$|E
5|$|After Mao Zedong purged Peng in 1959, Mao {{appointed}} Marshal He Long to {{the head}} of an office to investigate Peng's past in order to find additional reasons to criticize Peng. He accepted the position but was sympathetic to Peng, and stalled for over a year before submitting his report. Mao's prestige weakened when it became widely known that Mao's Great <b>Leap</b> <b>Forward</b> had been a disaster, and He eventually presented a report that was positive, and which attempted to vindicate Peng.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese {{blast furnace}} {{remained}} in use well until the 20th century. The backyard furnaces favoured by Mao Zedong during the Great <b>Leap</b> <b>Forward</b> were of this type. In the regions with strong traditions of metallurgy, the steel production actually increased during this period. In the regions {{where there was}} no tradition of steelmaking or where the ironmasters knowing the traditional skills or the scientific principles of the blast furnace process had been killed, the results were less than satisfactory.|$|E
60|$|But {{she did not}} fall, for Alex, quick at the last, <b>leaped</b> <b>forward</b> {{and caught}} her in his arms.|$|R
60|$|Startled at the {{unexpected}} interruption, the rowdies fell back. Then Towser <b>leaped</b> <b>forward</b> and caught Si Peters by his trowsers.|$|R
60|$|It was Tom who acted. Heedless of the danger, he <b>leaped</b> <b>forward</b> {{and aimed}} a kick at the snake's head.|$|R
5|$|Mariner 9 and Viking allowed better maps of Mars to be {{made using}} the data from these missions, and another major <b>leap</b> <b>forward</b> was the Mars Global Surveyor mission, {{launched}} in 1996 and operated until late 2006, that allowed complete, extremely detailed maps of the Martian topography, magnetic field and surface minerals to be obtained. These maps are available online; for example, at Google Mars. Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Mars Express continued exploring with new instruments, and supporting lander missions. NASA provides two online tools: Mars Trek, which provides visualizations of the planet using data from 50 years of exploration, and Experience Curiosity, which simulates traveling on Mars in 3-D with Curiosity.|$|E
5|$|The 1990s saw the Echo take a huge {{technological}} <b>leap</b> <b>forward</b> when a £12million {{printing press}} was installed. It {{was used for}} the first time in December 1996 and was capable of printing up to 70,000newspapers an hour. The press was part of a multimillion-pound revamp, which also saw journalists making up full news pages on computer screens for the first time. The Echos first internet news service was also launched in 1996. A further £5million was spent on updating the pre-press and press hall area in 2004, to improve printing quality and speed of production.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1957 Mao {{suggested}} a nationwide programme of mass collectivization, in which China's farmers would be forcibly relocated to large agricultural communes and all private property would be eliminated. Mao's theories on mass collectivization became {{the basis of the}} Great <b>Leap</b> <b>Forward,</b> a national economic plan that began in 1958 which caused a man-made famine across the country that lasted for several years. By 1959, {{tens of millions of people}} had starved to death. From October–December 1958, the economic system in the countryside broke down as farmers refused to go to work in the fields, raided government granaries for food, and in Guangdong, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Sichuan, and Qinghai, rebelled. In December 1958 China's leaders quietly decided to reverse the policies of the Great Leap.|$|E
5000|$|The rescuer <b>leaps</b> <b>forward</b> in a dive position, arching {{his body}} to break the surface and reach down towards the sand.|$|R
60|$|He {{opened the}} door, and was half-way out when Hardwick, realizing what escape meant, <b>leaped</b> <b>forward</b> and caught {{him by the}} coat.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{are coming}} for us!" [...] shouted Whopper, and the {{statement}} proved true. With wild yelps and snarls the wolves <b>leaped</b> <b>forward.</b>|$|R
5|$|Peng did {{not oppose}} Mao's collectivizations {{in the first}} phase of the Great Leap, from late 1957– early 1958, but he {{increasingly}} opposed it from spring-winter 1958, as the problems which Mao's policies had caused became more evident. In February 1958 Peng gave a speech for the fortieth anniversary of the Soviet Red Army, in which he suggested increased military cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. Mao opposed this suggestion, and began grooming Lin Biao as a viable successor to Peng for the position of Defense Minister. As part of the Great <b>Leap</b> <b>Forward,</b> Mao ordered the formation of a national militia that was controlled by Party members and independent of the PLA, eventually training and arming tens of millions of civilians.|$|E
5|$|Although the CCC {{became a}} {{powerful}} political {{force in the}} following years, at the 8th National Congress in 1956 its inspectors were warned about abusing their power and becoming independent of their local party committees. Its power waned during the Great <b>Leap</b> <b>Forward,</b> but the CCC, the Secretariat and the Organisation Department became the chief weapons {{in the aftermath of}} the Great Leap to combat corruption and reverse verdicts on rightists. The CCC played its new role until the Cultural Revolution, a socio-political movement which lasted from 1966 until 1976, when it was affected by purges (partly due to its close ties to Peng Zhen, one of the first highly ranked officials purged during the Cultural Revolution). At the 9th National Congress in 1969 the CCC was abolished, removed from the party constitution and replaced by special-case organisations (such as the Central Case Examination Group) formed under Mao and Kang Sheng. Despite its abolition at the congress, little criticism was directed at the CCC during the Cultural Revolution; although CCC Deputy Secretary Min Yifan was criticised by the Red Guards, a revolutionary youth movement independent of the party (but inspired by Mao) during the Cultural Revolution, most of their disapproval focused on his career on local committees rather than the CCC. Talk of an internal party-control system would not resurface until the death of Mao and the arrest of the Gang of Four in 1976.|$|E
5|$|Castro's {{increasing}} role on {{the world}} stage strained his relationship with the USSR, now under the leadership of Leonid Brezhnev. Asserting Cuba's independence, Castro refused to sign the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, declaring it a Soviet-U.S. attempt to dominate the Third World. Diverting from Soviet Marxist doctrine, he suggested that Cuban society could evolve straight to pure communism rather than gradually progress through various stages of socialism. In turn, the Soviet-loyalist Aníbal Escalante began organizing a government network of opposition to Castro, though in January 1968, he and his supporters were arrested for allegedly passing state secrets to Moscow. However, recognising Cuba's economic dependence on the Soviets, Castro relented to Brezhnev's pressure to be obedient, and in August 1968 he denounced the leaders of the Prague Spring and praised the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. Influenced by China's Great <b>Leap</b> <b>Forward,</b> in 1968 Castro proclaimed a Great Revolutionary Offensive, closing all remaining privately owned shops and businesses and denouncing their owners as capitalist counter-revolutionaries. The severe lack of consumer goods for purchase led productivity to decline, as large sectors of the population felt little incentive to work hard. This was exacerbated by the perception that a revolutionary elite had emerged consisting of those connected to the administration; they had access to better housing, private transportation, servants, and the ability to purchase luxury goods abroad.|$|E
6000|$|Jim Cleve {{suddenly}} appeared to regain power {{of speech and}} motion. [...] "Don't, Kells, don't!" [...] he cried, piercingly, as he <b>leaped</b> <b>forward.</b>|$|R
60|$|He <b>leapt</b> <b>forward</b> {{towards the}} military, {{and with a}} sudden roar his followers, a full hundred strong sprang after him to the charge.|$|R
60|$|His {{brother was}} already at the doorway. The {{shouting}} and firing outside was increasing. <b>Leaping</b> <b>forward,</b> Larry caught Benedicto Lupez by the arm.|$|R
25|$|The Great <b>Leap</b> <b>Forward</b> {{campaign}} began {{during the}} period of the Second Five Year Plan which was scheduled to run from 1958 to 1963, though the campaign itself was discontinued by 1961. Mao unveiled the Great <b>Leap</b> <b>Forward</b> at a meeting in January 1958 in Nanjing.|$|E

60|$|The car fairly <b>leapt</b> <b>forward.</b> Three {{more shots}} rang out, but went happily wide. Julius, upright, leant {{over the back}} of the car.|$|R
60|$|Scarcely had he {{uttered the}} words when both Leo and Carl <b>leaped</b> <b>forward.</b> Two quick blows landed Nathan Wampole {{flat on his}} back.|$|R
6000|$|As Butzow and Barney stepped {{upon the}} chancel Peter of Blentz <b>leaped</b> <b>forward.</b> [...] "What mad treason is this?" [...] he fairly screamed.|$|R
25|$|The {{shortages}} and the socialist policies surrounding {{the lack of}} goods have been compared to the Great Chinese Famine following the Great <b>Leap</b> <b>Forward</b> – a plan admired by Hugo Chávez – and the Holodomor of Soviet Ukraine.|$|E
25|$|The third Eddystone Lighthouse, Smeaton's Tower was {{assembled}} from granite at Millbay from 1756–9 {{and marked}} a major <b>leap</b> <b>forward</b> {{in the development}} of lighthouse design – the upper portion remains the most iconic landmark of the modern city.|$|E
25|$|Aviation took a <b>leap</b> <b>forward</b> {{with the}} {{industrialization}} that accompanied World War I. In the post-war period, manufacturers {{needed to find}} new markets and introduced models designed for tourism. However, these machines were affordable only by the very rich.|$|E
60|$|Again the two contestants {{put forth}} {{additional}} muscle, each to out-distant his opponent, {{and again the}} two row-boats <b>leaped</b> <b>forward,</b> still side by side.|$|R
60|$|As {{no reply}} was given, the sailor boldly <b>leapt</b> <b>forward,</b> caught the {{man by the}} collar, and dragged him into a {{position}} of safety.|$|R
