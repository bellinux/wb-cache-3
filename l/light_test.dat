In the development process, all parts are arranged in accordance with the original car position, and the original car lighting harness was wiring, and fault box of the simulation of the actual fault was set. Developed automotive <b>lighting</b> <b>test</b> rig can really provide lighting and signal system control principle and process. The whole system or local circuit wiring training and line detection training can be done. Actual troubleshooting ability can be trained by the whole system or local circuit. It is multi-function, much cheaper and has better effect. And it provides real platform for improving the operating ability of the lighting and signal system...|$|R

50|$|The Worth Four <b>Light</b> <b>Test,</b> {{also known}} as the Worth's Four Dot test or W4LT, is a {{clinical}} test mainly used for assessing a patient's degree of binocular vision and binocular single vision. Binocular vision involves an image being projected by each eye simultaneously into an area in space and being fused into a single image. The Worth Four <b>Light</b> <b>Test</b> is also used in detection of suppression of either the right or left eye. Suppression occurs during binocular vision when the brain does not process the information received from either of the eyes. This is a common adaptation to strabismus, amblyopia and aniseikonia.|$|E

40|$|Behavioral {{tests of}} animals in a {{controlled}} experimental setting provide a valuable tool to advance understanding of genotype-phenotype relations, and to {{study the effects of}} genetic and environmental manipulations. To optimally benefit from the increasing numbers of genetically engineered mice, reliable high-throughput methods for comprehensive behavioral phenotyping of mice lines have become a necessity. Here, we describe the development and validation of an anxiety <b>test,</b> the <b>light</b> spot <b>test,</b> that allows for unsupervised, automated, high-throughput testing of mice in a home-cage system. This automated behavioral test circumvents bias introduced by pretest handling, and enables recording both baseline behavior and the behavioral test response over a prolonged period of time. We demonstrate that the <b>light</b> spot <b>test</b> induces a behavioral response in C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. This behavior reverts to baseline when the aversive stimulus is switched off, and is blunted by treatment with the anxiolytic drug Diazepam, demonstrating predictive validity of the assay, and indicating that the observed behavioral response has a significant anxiety component. Also, we investigated the effectiveness of the <b>light</b> spot <b>test</b> as part of sequential testing for different behavioral aspects in the home-cage. Two learning tests, administered prior to the <b>light</b> spot <b>test,</b> affected the <b>light</b> spot <b>test</b> parameters. The <b>light</b> spot <b>test</b> is a novel, automated assay for anxiety-related high-throughput testing of mice in an automated home-cage environment, allowing for both comprehensive behavioral phenotyping of mice, and rapid screening of pharmacological compounds...|$|R

50|$|The Worth Four <b>Light</b> <b>Test</b> is {{indicated}} for use when assessing the binocular functions, {{the ability of}} eyes to work in coordination, of an individual.

It can be used when wanting to assess whether the individual has a normal or abnormal binocular single vision response (BSV). It can be used to establish whether a patient has the ability for the eyes to fuse the light that is received from each eye into 4 lights. The test {{is indicated}} {{with the use of a}} presence of a prism in individuals with a strabismus and fusion is considered present if 4 lights are maintained, with or without the use of a prism.

Solid shell fuel has the consistency of soft rubber and is cut into a pattern that is open in the middle, so on firing the [...] "grain" [...] would tend to collapse into the cavity. This problem was solved by filling the cavity with zinc bromide, a liquid that had a density close to the fuel which prevented the collapse and was then drained out after firing to allow the shell to <b>light.</b> <b>Test</b> firings began at the US Ballistic Research Laboratory in Aberdeen using a bored-out 175 mm gun from the M107.

5000|$|For {{color vision}} {{deficient}} pilots, {{in many cases}} these restrictions can be removed through use of an FAA approved alternative office based color vision test, which if passed, the applicant must continue to retake that same test (or any other passable tests) at every renewal. If the pilot applicant is unable to pass any of the office based tests, a real world operational test is available. This test consists of a ground based chart reading and control tower signal <b>light</b> <b>test</b> for Third Class medical certification (This is called the Operational Color Vision Test or OCVT), {{and in addition to}} that, a specialized [...] "Medical Flight Test" [...] (MFT) is required for Second and First Class medical certification. The applicant performs an actual flight test with an FAA Aviation Safety Inspector (ASI) for the purpose of further demonstrating [...] "the ability to perceive those colors necessary for the safe performance of airman duties", which is the color vision requirement as written in the FARs. Note that [...] "Normal Color Vision" [...] is not required, as a certain amount of color vision deficiency is considered safe and permitted. If the tests are passed, a [...] "Letter of Evidence" [...] (LOE) from the FAA is issued, which serves as evidence that the pilot meets the standards for Color Vision and the AME is permitted to issue the class of Medical Certificate indicated on the LOE (All classes if both the OCVT and MFT are passed) with no related restriction if all other medical requirements are met. This allows the pilot to receive a medical certificate with no restrictions related to color vision without the requirement of passing an office based color vision test at every subsequent renewal.|$|E
