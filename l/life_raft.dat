5|$|At sea, a {{cargo ship}} {{en route from}} Guam to Yap was {{abandoned}} after it was damaged by high winds. The passengers entered a <b>life</b> <b>raft,</b> and were later found by a Navy search and rescue airplane. They were soon rescued by a Maltese tanker. No one was injured when the accident occurred.|$|E
5|$|Chief Gunner's Mate Michael B. Wallrath, who had {{assisted}} in lowering three lifeboats while he remained on board, jumped overboard after seeing {{to it that}} all the boats were away. Wallrath was pulled into lifeboat number 6 just before a wave capsized it and drowned two of its occupants. Lieutenant commander R. B. Vandervoort, USNRF, West Gates commanding officer, remained on board until he felt sure that the entire crew had departed the sinking ship. When he climbed up on the deckhouse to cut free a <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> and leave the ship, he discovered six men huddled on deck. Vandervoort {{was able to get}} the six on the <b>life</b> <b>raft,</b> but the suction caused by West Gates final plunge pulled him away and below the surface. After he managed {{to get back to the}} surface, he clung to floating wreckage for two hours until pulled aboard the very raft he had missed earlier. Vandervoort and the six men aboard the raft were rescued by one of Americans lifeboats at 06:00, after some 3½ hours in the water.|$|E
5|$|In Okaloosa County, up to 1,267 {{residents}} {{lost power}} during the storm. Most {{of the residents}} had their power restored within a few hours; however, due to continuing wind damage, scattered power outages, affecting up to 500 homes at a time, occurred throughout the county. Throughout the county, roughly $25,000 was sustained in flood losses. A second fatality occurred after a man was knocked off his ship near the coast of Bay County. Rescuers managed to reach him but during the rescue, he fell off the <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> and was lost. The search was later called off as he was presumed dead.|$|E
50|$|The United States Navy uses five {{types of}} custom {{inflatable}} <b>life</b> <b>rafts</b> {{as well as}} a number of commercially available Coast Guard approved <b>life</b> <b>rafts.</b> The 25-person MK-6 and MK-7 are used on surface ships, the 50-person MK-8 on aircraft carriers and LRU-13A and LRU-12A on aircraft and submarines respectively. Smaller combatant craft often use 6, 10 or 15-person commercial <b>life</b> <b>rafts.</b> The number of <b>life</b> <b>rafts</b> carried on USN ships is determined based on the maximum number of personnel carried aboard plus 10% as a safety margin. Aircraft carriers carry either 254 MK7 <b>life</b> <b>rafts</b> or 127 MK8 <b>life</b> <b>rafts.</b> While both are similar to heavy-duty commercial <b>life</b> <b>rafts,</b> USN <b>life</b> <b>rafts</b> use breathable air as the inflation gas rather than carbon dioxide to ensure full inflation within 30 seconds in Arctic environments.|$|R

5|$|American, {{which was}} lightly {{damaged by the}} collision, {{reversed}} her engine {{to back out of}} the tangle while West Gates engine was shut down. After American was completely backed out, West Gate began rapidly settling and was ordered abandoned. A total of seven men from West Gate died in the accident—two when their lifeboat capsized, and a further five that probably died in the initial impact. West Gates commanding officer, Lt. Cdr. R. B. Vandervoort, and six men he had personally escorted to a <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> were picked up by one of Americans lifeboats at 06:00, after some 3½ hours in the water. The Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships does not report any casualties on American from the collision.|$|E
25|$|A 14-day {{search for}} the {{aircraft}} and survivors found only wheels and a <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> floating 596km (370 miles) southwest of Lands End. No trace of the crew or passengers was ever found.|$|E

40|$|Inflatable <b>life</b> <b>rafts,</b> {{introduced}} in World War II, {{are commonly used}} today on oilinstallations, merchant ships, cruise ships, ferries, military vessels and small vessels as evacuation systems. Large passenger ship, such as ferries, are typically equipped with standby vessels to tow the <b>life</b> <b>rafts</b> to safety, away from hazards such as fires, explosions, collisions and sinking vessels. While operators find the compact and lightweight features of <b>life</b> <b>rafts</b> attractive, these features also make them less stable in waves and wind. Rafts have very shallow draught and {{a large part of}} the base can break clear of the water when a steep wave passes underneath it, thereby decreasing stability. Large overturning moments can be generated on the windward side, which could overturn the raft. Drogues and water pockets are commonly used to counteract the overturning moment and to increase stability (Cole and Wills, 1981) Several experiments have been conducted to study potential capsizing situations using full-scale and model <b>life</b> <b>rafts.</b> Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

Caffery looked to be in good condition so Santagata agreed.|$|E
25|$|En route, the {{helicopter}} ran into poor weather and was then struck by lightning. This caused severe {{damage to the}} tail rotor. Though {{the helicopter}} managed to limp {{for a few more}} minutes, the tail rotor eventually failed completely and the pilot was forced to perform an emergency autorotation onto the rough seas. Emergency floaters on the helicopter allowed the passengers and crew to be evacuated onto a <b>life</b> <b>raft.</b> Despite the high waves and bad weather, all the people on board the flight were rescued.|$|E
25|$|Half collie, Lassie {{was owned}} by the {{landlord}} of the Pilot Boat, a pub in the port of Lyme Regis. On New Year’s Day in 1915 the Royal Navy battleship Formidable was torpedoed by a German submarine off Start Point in South Devon, {{with the loss of}} more than 500 men. In a storm that followed the accident, a <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> containing bodies was blown along the coast to Lyme Regis. In helping to deal with the crisis, the local pub in Lyme Regis, called the Pilot Boat, offered its cellar as a mortuary.|$|E

25|$|When {{the first}} two life rafts were filled, they were tied {{together}} and rowed from the port wing toward {{the nose of the}} aircraft. One of the rafts scraped against a piece of metal and deflated rapidly, with its passengers falling into the water. Other passengers launched a <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> from the starboard wing, but it was also punctured. A search and rescue mission was quickly initiated by the United States Coast Guard. It took between 45 and 60 minutes before the rescue team was able to pick up the survivors. The Coast Guard stayed for hours searching for survivors.|$|E
25|$|During reentry, {{there was}} a great deal of concern over whether Carpenter had {{actually}} survived, since he splashed down 250 miles off course. There are two accounts of the Aurora 7 recovery, the first being that forty minutes after splashdown, Carpenter was located in his <b>life</b> <b>raft,</b> safe and in good health by Maj. Fred Brown under the command of the Puerto Rico Air National Guard, and recovered three hours later by the , and the second being that a P-2 Neptune from Patrol Squadron 18 flying out of Naval Station Roosevelt Roads was the first to sight and mark Carpenter's position.|$|E
25|$|Attempts {{to locate}} Sydney, which was several days overdue in {{returning}} to port, commenced on 23 November. However, {{it was not}} until the afternoon of the next day, after the British tanker Trocas reported finding the second Kormoran <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> with 25 men (one having perished) a full-scale search was begun. Several German lifeboats were spotted on 25 November during the air search off Western Australia: the 46-man cutter had come ashore at 17-Mile Well, the 57-man lifeboat was nearing Red Bluff, and a third lifeboat was further off the coast. That afternoon, the staff of Quobba Station rounded up the two groups that had made landfall, who did not resist capture.|$|E

25|$|On November 23, 1970, the Lady Dorianne {{departed}} from Havre-Aubert {{en route to}} Shippagan following a storm. It was alternatively reported as having five or six men aboard, including the captain Sylvio Noël, when it disappeared {{off the coast of}} Miscou Island. Everybody aboard was presumed killed, although the ship and bodies were never found. In December, the Ministry of Transportation was urged to not give up its search for the ship, since the previous sinkings of two identical ships were still unexplained and it was hoped that the wreckage might provide a clue to its fate. It was never found, although searches turned up an uninflated <b>life</b> <b>raft</b> from the ship.|$|E
25|$|The boat’s navigational and {{communications}} {{systems have been}} damaged by saltwater intrusion. The man tries to repair the marine radio and connects {{it to one of}} the boat's batteries but is unsuccessful. When he climbs the mast to repair an antenna lead, he sees an oncoming tropical storm. When the storm arrives, he runs before the wind. He intends to bring the boat into a hove-to position, but when crawling to the bow to hoist the storm jib, he is thrown overboard and regains the deck after a long struggle. The boat capsizes, turtles after a further 180-degree roll and is dis-masted, and most of the equipment is destroyed. With the boat badly holed and sinking, the man abandons ship in an inflatable <b>life</b> <b>raft,</b> salvaging whatever he can to survive.|$|E
25|$|A trawler {{caught in}} rough seas {{produced}} by the storm sent out a distress signal as it became overcome by the storm. Rescue attempts to retrieve the three crew members were hampered by Hamish and were called off but expected to resume of 10 March. Nearly three days following {{the sinking of the}} trawler, officials called off the search and presumed that the two missing fishermen had drowned after finding empty life jackets and an un-deployed <b>life</b> <b>raft.</b> Severe erosion also caused the northern part of Fraser Island to become nearly inaccessible as it left the bedrock exposed. The Environmental Protection Agency stated that it was possible for light vehicles to continue along the normal route during low tide but were recommended to take the two-hour detour.
