40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to choose a new resin for the BP Castro(bottle-making process. Four resins were tested using the standard 10 -week stack test: ExxonMobil HY A 30 I (the control), Chevron Marlex 9512 H, Dow DMDA 6200, and BP Solvay HPS 0 - 25 - 155. The study focused on five possible defects: bent neck, pushed up base, creased side wall, pushed in bumper, and creased <b>label</b> <b>panel.</b> The goal was to find a resin that performed as well as or better than the control resin. The test required bottles to be made and quality-checked for conformance to specification. The bottles were then put into an Environmental Stress Crack Resistance test and subsequently set up in a warehouse for a live load double stack test. Four pallets of each resin were loaded with ballast weight and left untouched. At the conclusion of IO weeks, the ballast weight was removed and the bottles were inspected for defects. None of the resins clearly outperformed the control resin on all elements of the evaluation. Due to the lack of supply of the control resin, a new resin had to be picked from this set; therefore, the comparison was narrowed down to a single defect type: bent neck. As a result, the Dow resin was chosen as the replacement. Future development in test methods can be drawn from this test set of data to produce a lab-based test that is done in a controlled environment at an accelerated pace...|$|E

40|$|Researchers often {{summarize}} {{their work}} {{in the form of}} posters. Posters provide a coherent and efficient way to convey core ideas from scientific papers. Generating a good scientific poster, however, is a complex and time consuming cognitive task, since such posters need to be readable, informative, and visually aesthetic. In this paper, for the first time, we study the challenging problem of learning to generate posters from scientific papers. To this end, a data-driven framework, that utilizes graphical models, is proposed. Specifically, given content to display, the key elements of a good poster, including panel layout and attributes of each panel, are learned and inferred from data. Then, given inferred layout and attributes, composition of graphical elements within each panel is synthesized. To learn and validate our model, we collect and make public a Poster-Paper dataset, which consists of scientific papers and corresponding posters with exhaustively <b>labelled</b> <b>panels</b> and attributes. Qualitative and quantitative results indicate the effectiveness of our approach. Comment: in Proceedings of the 30 th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI' 16), Phoenix, AZ, 201...|$|R

40|$|Quantitative {{analysis}} of the scientific literature is important for evaluating the evolution and state of science. To study how the density of biological literature {{has changed over the}} past two decades we visually inspected 1464 research articles related only to the biological sciences from ten scholarly journals (with average Impact Factors, IF, ranging from 3. 8 to 32. 1). By scoring the number of data items (tables and figures), density of composite figures (<b>labeled</b> <b>panels</b> per figure or PPF), as well as the number of authors, pages and references per research publication we calculated an Average Publishable Unit or APU for 1993, 2003, and 2013. The data show an overall increase in the average ± SD number of data items from 1993 to 2013 of approximately 7 ± 3 to 14 ± 11 and PPF ratio of 2 ± 1 to 4 ± 2 per article, suggesting that the APU has doubled in size {{over the past two decades}}. As expected, the increase in data items per article is mainly in the form of supplemental material, constituting 0 to 80 % of the data items per publication in 2013, depending on the journal. The changes in the average number of pages (approx. 8 ± 3 to 10 ± 3), references (approx. 44 ± 18 to 56 ± 24) and authors (approx. 5 ± 3 to 8 ± 9) per article are also presented and discussed. The average number of data items, figure density and authors per publication are correlated with the journal's average IF. The increasing APU size over time is important when considering the value of research articles for life scientists and publishers, as well as, the implications of these increasing trends in the mechanisms and economics of scientific communication...|$|R

2500|$|As {{previously}} mentioned, {{there is}} no classification for the châteaux of Pomerol. While {{the reason for this}} is often touted as the relatively recent prominence of Pomerol on the world market, even now with the wines of Pomerol generating worldwide acclaim and recognition, many of the producers still feel that an official ranking of Pomerol estates is not needed. Some producers, such as Nicolas de Bailliencourt of Château Gazin, believe most of the opposition is from small growers who fear being left off any ranking making their wines perceived to be inferior. Another proprietor told wine writer Stephen Brooks that the current, unranked system [...] "allows the mediocre wines to profit from the reputation of Pomerol's best wines."
