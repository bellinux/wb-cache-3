5|$|Chelation {{therapy is}} used in cases of acute lead poisoning, severe poisoning, and encephalopathy, and is {{considered}} for people with blood lead <b>levels</b> above 25µg/dL. While the use of chelation for people with symptoms of lead poisoning is widely supported, use in asymptomatic people with high blood lead <b>levels</b> is more controversial. Chelation therapy is of limited value for cases of chronic exposure to low <b>levels</b> of lead. Chelation therapy is usually stopped when symptoms resolve or when blood lead <b>levels</b> return to premorbid <b>levels.</b> When lead exposure has taken place over a long period, blood lead <b>levels</b> may rise after chelation is stopped because lead is leached into blood from stores in the bone; thus repeated treatments are often necessary.|$|E

50|$|<b>Levelling</b> is the {{measurement}} of geodetic height using an optical <b>levelling</b> instrument and a <b>level</b> staff or rod having a numbered scale.

5|$|Estrogen <b>levels</b> {{may affect}} thyroid behavior. For example, during the luteal phase (when {{estrogen}} <b>levels</b> are lower), {{the velocity of}} blood flow in the thyroid is lower than during the follicular phase (when estrogen <b>levels</b> are higher).|$|E
5|$|Exposure to lead {{also can}} be {{evaluated}} by measuring erythrocyte protoporphyrin (EP) in blood samples. EP {{is a part of}} red blood cells known to increase when the amount of lead in the blood is high, with a delay of a few weeks. Thus EP <b>levels</b> in conjunction with blood lead <b>levels</b> can suggest the time period of exposure; if blood lead <b>levels</b> are high but EP is still normal, this finding suggests exposure was recent. However, the EP level alone is not sensitive enough to identify elevated blood lead <b>levels</b> below about 35μg/dL. Due to this higher threshold for detection and the fact that EP <b>levels</b> also increase in iron deficiency, use of this method for detecting lead exposure has decreased.|$|E
5|$|High {{potassium}} <b>levels</b> {{tend to be}} {{a feature}} of severe rhabdomyolysis.

5|$|In adults, {{blood lead}} <b>levels</b> {{steadily}} increase with increasing age. In adults of all ages, men have higher blood lead <b>levels</b> than women do. Children {{are more sensitive}} to elevated blood lead <b>levels</b> than adults are. Children may also have a higher intake of lead than adults; they breathe faster and {{may be more likely}} to have contact with and ingest soil. Children of ages one to three tend to have the highest blood lead <b>levels,</b> possibly because at that age they begin to walk and explore their environment, and they use their mouths in their exploration. Blood <b>levels</b> usually peak at about 18–24months old. In many countries including the US, household paint and dust are the major route of exposure in children.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other animals}} {{at the highest}} trophic <b>levels,</b> the killer whale is {{particularly}} at risk of poisoning from bioaccumulation of toxins, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).

5|$|Nighttime <b>levels</b> feature slower-paced, action-oriented <b>levels,</b> {{in which}} Sonic {{transforms}} into the Werehog, a beast form that has great strength and stretchable arms. Gameplay here sees the player {{use a variety}} of melee and combo attacks to defeat large numbers of enemies, collect items, and move items around to advance through the level, and use his stretchable arms to cling to distant objects; simple puzzle elements are also featured. Collecting rings in these <b>levels</b> replenishes the Werehog's health, while a special move, Unleashed Mode, allows the Werehog to channel his energy into increasing the power of his attacks for a short time. Nighttime <b>levels</b> are adjusted in the Wii version to allow greater use of the Wii Remote, such that players may control the arms of the Werehog by using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk in order to grab onto objects and proceed in the <b>levels.</b> The Wii version of the game also expands upon the ratio of nighttime <b>levels</b> to daytime, with more than three times as many nighttime <b>levels</b> (twenty-five in all).

5|$|Potassium <b>levels</b> can {{fluctuate}} severely {{during the}} treatment of DKA, because insulin decreases potassium <b>levels</b> in the blood by redistributing it into cells via increased sodium-potassium pump activity. A {{large part of the}} shifted extracellular potassium would have been lost in urine because of osmotic diuresis. Hypokalemia (low blood potassium concentration) often follows treatment. This increases the risk of dangerous irregularities in the heart rate. Therefore, continuous observation of the heart rate is recommended, as well as repeated measurement of the potassium <b>levels</b> and addition of potassium to the intravenous fluids once <b>levels</b> fall below 5.3mmol/l. If potassium <b>levels</b> fall below 3.3mmol/l, insulin administration may need to be interrupted to allow correction of the hypokalemia.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} lead on children's {{cognitive}} abilities {{takes place at}} very low <b>levels.</b> There is apparently no lower threshold to the dose-response relationship (unlike other heavy metals such as mercury). Reduced academic performance {{has been associated with}} lead exposure even at blood lead <b>levels</b> lower than 5μg/dL. Blood lead <b>levels</b> below 10μg/dL have been reported to be associated with lower IQ and behavior problems such as aggression, in proportion with blood lead <b>levels.</b> Between the blood lead <b>levels</b> of 5 and 35μg/dL, an IQ decrease of 2–4 points for each μg/dL increase is reported in children. However, studies that show associations between low-level lead exposure and health effects in children may be affected by confounding and overestimate the effects of low-level lead exposure.|$|E
