50|$|A <b>Lock-up</b> <b>clutch</b> {{is used in}} some {{automatic}} transmissions for motor vehicles. Above a certain speed (usually 60 km/h) it locks the torque converter to minimise power loss and improve fuel efficiency.|$|E
50|$|The first {{automotive}} {{application of}} the lock-up principle was Packard's Ultramatic transmission, introduced in 1949, which locked up the converter at cruising speeds, unlocking when the throttle was floored for quick acceleration or as the vehicle slowed down. This feature was also present in some Borg-Warner transmissions produced during the 1950s. It fell out of favor in subsequent years due to its extra complexity and cost. In the late 1970s <b>lock-up</b> <b>clutches</b> started to reappear in response to demands for improved fuel economy, and are now nearly universal in automotive applications.|$|R

5000|$|A facelifted {{model was}} first {{shown at the}} New York Auto Show in April 2009. The 2010 Range Rover Sport {{featured}} a more aerodynamic front-end including new headlights, grille and bumper. Also new are revised rear lights and rear bumper. Interior revisions are more significant with a new fascia, steering wheel, door linings, seats, instruments and switchgear. The new model has more leather apparent and nearly 50 percent less dash bound buttons than the previous model. Three new engines made their debut in the 2010 Sport. These include an all-new direct injected, all-aluminium 5.0-litre petrol V8 engine in naturally aspirated and supercharged guises as seen in Jaguar’s latest range of high-performance vehicles. The naturally aspirated model produces 375 hp and 375 ft-lbs torque while the supercharged produces 510 hp and 461 ft-lbs torque. Also new is a heavily revised 3.0-litre version of the current 2.7-litre TDV6 producing [...] and 600 Nm, adapted from Jaguar’s AJ-V6D Gen III. This engine features parallel sequential turbochargers - a single variable geometry turbocharger and a single fixed geometry turbocharger which is only active when required as seen on the Jaguar XF Diesel S. All of the new engines produce increased power and torque over their predecessors while delivering better fuel economy and reduced [...] emissions. Fitted with a sixth generation twin-vortex supercharger with an improved thermodynamic efficiency of 16 percent, the new 5.0-litre supercharged engine produces 29 percent more power and 12 percent more torque than the current 4.2-litre engine, yet [...] emissions and fuel consumption are improved by 5.6 percent and 6.2 percent respectively. The new 3.0-litre TDV6 engine produces 29 percent more power and 36 percent more torque than the 2.7-litre engine, yet [...] emissions and fuel consumption are both improved by 9 percent. The 2010 model year Sport is also fitted with the new ZF HP28 six-speed automatic transmission. Designed to improve performance and efficiency, the new transmission engages the <b>lock-up</b> <b>clutches</b> of each gear earlier after selection. Suspension refinements also occurred {{with the introduction of}} the world’s first production damping system using model-based predictive technology that continually optimise the settings of the new DampTronic Valve Technology damper units to optimise vehicle ride and control. Further improvements to the award-winning Terrain Response system have taken place for 2010. Revisions to the rock crawl program reduce roll when traversing boulders delivering a more composed ride over rocky terrain. The addition of a new 'sand launch control' prevents wheels digging in when driving away in soft sand thanks to revisions to the traction control system. The Hill Descent Control system has also been enhanced with the addition of Gradient Release Control, which inhibits the initial rate of acceleration when descending steep inclines.|$|R

50|$|Although not {{strictly}} {{a part of}} classic torque converter design, many automotive converters include a <b>lock-up</b> <b>clutch</b> to improve cruising power transmission efficiency and reduce heat.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a new coasting lock-up controller for the {{torque converter clutch}} in automatic transmissions. It was developed to reduce engagement shock and fuel consumption during coasting lock-up, especially when the engine speed drops after a power-off up-shift. P and PI controllers were sequentially adopted in the torque converter clutch control unit without using torque or pressure sensors. In addition, a function of jump-down of command duty was implemented to compensate a sudden increase of engine speed with a high change rate, due to unstable hydraulic pressure. According to the test results in a real vehicle, the new controller fulfilled coasting lock-up successfully after the power-off up-shift, showing diminished engagement shock and improved fuel saving, {{in comparison with the}} conventional controller with bigger duty or engine speed-up control.

50|$|The {{naturally}} aspirated XT engine specification {{is identical to}} the non-turbo XR6, G6, G6E and Utility vehicle variants powered by the 4.0L engine. At launch, the standard transmission was a new 5-speed auto, replacing the previous Australian designed and made 4-speed. The ZF 6-speed auto was optional from the launch in 2008, and has a slightly however insignificantly quicker performance in gears above the second gear as compared to the French designed 5 speed and slightly better fuel economy due to slightly quicker shifts in third, fourth, fifth and sixth gears; and more regularly engaging <b>clutch</b> <b>lock-up.</b> This is primarily due to the software the operates the ZF unit but also the unit's inherit mechanical shift quality. In July 2010, the 6-speed was made standard. Both the 5- and the 6- speed retain the 3.73:1 final open differential ratio with LSD optional on XR6 models. During numerous tests a standard 5- or 6- speed FG XT 4.0L petrol is capable of outrunning all previous generations of non-turbo Falcons as well as some previous generation V8 models; thus exhibiting quicker performance than for example any variant of a 5.4L 3V Falcon of the sixth generation.|$|R
50|$|Many TCUs {{now have}} an input from the {{vehicles}} traction control system. If the TCS detects unfavourable road conditions, a signal {{is sent to the}} TCU. The TCU can modify shift programmes by upshifting early, eliminating the torque converter <b>lock-up</b> <b>clutch</b> application, and also eliminating the first gear totally and pulling off in 2nd.|$|E
50|$|As {{described}} above, impelling losses {{within the}} torque converter reduce efficiency and generate waste heat. In modern automotive applications, {{this problem is}} commonly avoided by use of a <b>lock-up</b> <b>clutch</b> that physically links the impeller and turbine, effectively changing the converter into a purely mechanical coupling. The result is no slippage, and virtually no power loss.|$|E
50|$|The ZF 4HP16 {{transmission}} is an automatic transmission with 4 forward gears, one reverse and electronic hydraulic control. It {{is designed for}} use in a vehicle with front-wheel drive and a transverse engine. The {{transmission is}} operated via selector lever and possibly also via switch. The 4HP-16 transmission has a hydrodynamic torque converter with a controller slip <b>lock-up</b> <b>clutch.</b>|$|E
50|$|Through {{the late}} 1970s, Ford {{transmissions}} were factory {{filled with a}} fluid identified as ESW M2C33-F. To provide a fluid that {{would be available to}} the general public for service fill, oil companies and other than factory fill suppliers were allowed to develop fluids meeting the ESW M2C33-F specification and market these fluids under their own brand names but identified as Type F. A second generation of transmission fluid was released in 1974 as the factory fill specification, ESW M2C138-CJ. This fluid was developed to modify the vehicle shifting characteristics and to provide considerable improvement in the oxidation resistance and anti-wear performance. No service fluids were developed and for a short time, DEXRON fluids approved by General Motors were considered acceptable.With continuing changes and improvements in transmission design, a centrifugal <b>lock-up</b> torque converter <b>clutch</b> was introduced into the C5 transmission to smooth engine vibrations sensed by the occupant of the vehicle. An associated shudder problem forced the introduction of the factory fill specification ESP M2C166-H. Servicing transmissions with DEXRON fluids was unacceptable since not all DEXRON fluids were capable of eliminating the shudder phenomenon. The fluids that could be used were a subset of the DEXRON fluids.The advent of Type H as factory fill necessitated the development of a service fluid specification to match the performance expected from Type H. This resulted in the release of the MERCON specification in 1987.|$|R
40|$|Wet {{clutches}} {{are used}} {{in a variety of}} machinery such as in vehicles where they are used to distribute torque in the drivetrains. Clutches can be located in automatic transmissions or in limited slip differentials. The frictional behavior of a clutch is of great importance for overall vehicle behavior and has to be thoroughly investigated when designing new wet clutch applications. Frictional behavior is normally studied in test rigs where whole friction discs or complete clutches are tested under similar working conditions to those pertaining to the clutches in the drivetrain of the vehicle. However, today clutch behavior may be simulated with regard to some clutch applications and design of the clutch system is not limited to testing. This is an advantage as it is possible to simulate behavior that may not be possible or suitable to study in a test rig. Another advantage is that the design process is faster and more cost efficient than that which is possible when all tests are carried out in a laboratory. The torque transferred by the clutch during engagement can roughly be divided into full film torque and boundary lubrication torque. Full film torque originates from the part of the engagement where the clutch discs are completely separated by a lubricant film and the friction surfaces are not in contact, whereas boundary lubrication torque occurs when the lubricant film is so thin that the surfaces of the clutch discs are in direct contact, only separated by a thin additive film. The distribution between full film torque transfer and boundary lubrication torque transfer differs for different types of wet clutch and for differing operating conditions. When the clutch works in full film regime it is possible to simulate the friction quite well. However, the friction in the boundary lubrication regime is much more difficult to model and simulate since it is very dependent on the additives. Wet clutches are most commonly used in automatic transmissions for vehicles. As a result, most research into wet clutch testing and most simulations concerns wet clutches suitable for such applications. In an automatic transmission the wet clutch is often used to brake a rotating shaft to stand still relative to another shaft and the total engagement has a duration of fractions of a second. During most of the engagement the clutch is working in full film lubrication. In this thesis the focus is on wet clutches working under limited slip conditions: in other words this thesis studies clutches that are working {{with a small amount of}} slip over a long period without reaching a state of <b>lock-up.</b> These <b>clutch</b> types can be found, for example, in limited slip differentials. During this type of engagement the clutch mainly works under boundary lubrication conditions and much heat can be generated. The optimum method of designing a new wet clutch would be to simulate the clutch performance without having to do any measurements in the laboratory. This, however, is not yet possible, but an efficient way to design clutches can be achieved by combining simple measurements with efficient computer simulations. In this thesis, simple measurement techniques for wet clutch materials are developed and combined with a temperature simulation of a wet clutch, where the lubricant cooling flow, which is dependent on the surface roughness and groove pattern, is simulated. This method makes it possible to optimize a wet clutch for given working conditions with regard to lubricant, friction material, surface roughness and groove pattern. The simulations are validated to measured data from a test rig in which torque behavior from whole friction discs are investigated. Good agreement between simulations and measurements is achieved.

50|$|Coupling. The turbine {{has reached}} {{approximately}} 90 {{percent of the}} speed of the impeller. Torque multiplication has essentially ceased and the torque converter is behaving {{in a manner similar to}} a simple fluid coupling. In modern automotive applications, it is usually at this stage of operation where the <b>lock-up</b> <b>clutch</b> is applied, a procedure that tends to improve fuel efficiency.|$|E
50|$|Known as {{an input}} speed sensor (ISS). This sensor sends a varying {{frequency}} {{signal to the}} TCU to determine the current rotational speed of the input shaft or torque converter. The TCU uses the input shaft speed to determine slippage across the torque converter and potentially to determine the rate of slippage across the bands and clutches. This information is vital to regulate {{the application of the}} torque converter <b>lock-up</b> <b>clutch</b> smoothly and effectively.|$|E
50|$|The 6TD-2 engine {{drives a}} French-designed hydro-mechanical {{automatic}} transmission, the SESM ESM500, {{which is also}} fitted to the Leclerc MBT. Capable of manual and fully automatic power-shifting, the transmission has 5 forward and 2 reverse speeds along with a braking system that incorporates carbon friction brakes and a secondary speed-retarding system. Gear changes are controlled by a torque converter which is made more efficient by addition of an automatic <b>lock-up</b> <b>clutch.</b> There is also a mechanical back-up system for use in emergencies, able to shift 2 gears forward and reverse.|$|E
5000|$|This {{may also}} be known as Transmission Oil Temperature. This sensor determines the fluid {{temperature}} inside the transmission. This is often used for diagnostic purposes to check ATF (Automatic Transmission Fluid) at the correct temperature. The main use {{of this has been}} as a failsafe feature to downshift the transmission if the ATF becomes extremely hot. On more modern TCUs this input allows the TCU to modify the line pressure and solenoid pressures according to the changing viscosity of the fluid based on temperature, and also to determine regulation of the torque converter <b>lock-up</b> <b>clutch</b> ...|$|E
50|$|As {{fuel economy}} became more {{important}} in the 1970s, and 1980s, the C4 was replaced in 1982 by the C5, which was essentially a C4 with a <b>lock-up</b> <b>clutch</b> in the torque converter to improve highway fuel economy. It bore the casting numbers E2, E3, E4, E5, and E6, corresponding with the year it was produced. The C5 was phased out in 1986, replaced by the AOD. The production plant in Sharonville, Ohio was converted to production of the C6 transmission which was relocated from Livonia, Michigan, as the Livonia facility was converted to the AOD.|$|E
50|$|The {{driving gear}} is a {{rotating}} rod spring-loaded 7-roll drive. It consists of five wheels, a guide wheel {{at the rear}} and the front drive wheel. Support rollers are not necessary because of the taut and relatively light chain. In off-road driving, the driver must be careful to keep the chain tension constant. Even with a failed torsion bar the M548 is still roadworthy. The power of the motor drives the transfer gearcase, generator and the cooling of the differential/steering gear. The transfer gearcase {{can be used as}} a separating clutch when towing the vehicle and serves to reduce the motor's speed. The power transmission between the drive follows the torque converter with an automatic <b>lock-up</b> <b>clutch.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 2006 Harley-Davidson Introduced a non-street legal eight-second drag bike nicknamed [...] "the Destroyer".

A total of 646 vehicles were produced with 625 released to dealer showrooms. The Destroyer was inspiration for a four-time world champion in NHRA Pro Stock motorcycle drag racing the Harley-Davidson Screamin’ Eagle/Vance & Hines V-Rod. This Screamin’ Eagle/Vance & Hines V-Rod ran 6.815 seconds and went nearly 200 mph in the quarter-mile.|$|E
50|$|Secondly drivers newly {{allocated}} {{the type}} had not driven a vehicle of equivalent power before and most were not {{trained in the}} use of the semi-automatic gearbox which lacked the engine-braking effect of a 'solid' transmission. This resulted in many engine losses due to overspeeding, there was no easy way to control this as the pure 'fluid flywheel' form of transmission was used rather than a Leyland SCG-style <b>lock-up</b> <b>clutch.</b> Problems with the braking and transmission fed back on one another and exacerbated engine damage. PMT altered the change-speed control on some of its buses from electrical to pneumatic to slow down gearchanges but at the time and with the transmission system fitted there was no way to install an effective secondary braking system.|$|E
50|$|Even {{with the}} benefit of the one-way stator clutch, a {{converter}} cannot achieve the same level of efficiency in the coupling phase as an equivalently sized fluid coupling. Some loss is due to the presence of the stator (even though rotating as part of the assembly), as it always generates some power-absorbing turbulence. Most of the loss, however, is caused by the curved and angled turbine blades, which do not absorb kinetic energy from the fluid mass as well as radially straight blades. Since the turbine blade geometry is a crucial factor in the converter's ability to multiply torque, trade-offs between torque multiplication and coupling efficiency are inevitable. In automotive applications, where steady improvements in fuel economy have been mandated by market forces and government edict, the nearly universal use of a <b>lock-up</b> <b>clutch</b> has helped to eliminate the converter from the efficiency equation during cruising operation. The maximum amount of torque multiplication produced by a converter is highly dependent on the size and geometry of the turbine and stator blades, and is generated only when the converter is at or near the stall phase of operation. Typical stall torque multiplication ratios range from 1.8:1 to 2.5:1 for most automotive applications (although multi-element designs as used in the Buick Dynaflow and Chevrolet Turboglide could produce more). Specialized converters designed for industrial, rail, or heavy marine power transmission systems are capable of as much as 5.0:1 multiplication. Generally speaking, there is a trade-off between maximum torque multiplication and efficiency - high stall ratio converters tend to be relatively inefficient below the coupling speed, whereas low stall ratio converters tend to provide less possible torque multiplication.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} the dynamics and stability of a conventional powertrain with a Half Toroidal (HT) type Continuously Variable Unit (CVU). A mathematic system model of the powertrain is assembled from parametric finite elements that are formulated from lumped mass, torsional stiffness and damping and varying gear ratios. Simulations have been carried out to investigate the transient behaviour of the powertrain. The damping within the system has been varied to investigate its effect on the dynamic stability of the powertrain. The obtained results show that transient responses of input and output rollers of the HT-CVU exist when clutch changes during vehicle acceleration period starting from stand-still condition. Severe or even unstable responses of HT-CVU take place if the damping is insufficient in HT-CVU and tyres not only in the initial acceleration period but also in later period after the clutch change. The response of the powertrain becomes stable again when a <b>lock-up</b> <b>clutch</b> is applied even if the damping in tyres remains insufficient...|$|E
40|$|A torque converter, {{which is}} a {{hydrodynamic}} clutch in automatic transmissions, transmits power from the engine shaft to the transmission shaft either by dynamically multiplying the engine torque or by rigidly coupling the engine and transmission shafts. The torque converter is a critical element in the automatic driveline, and it affects the vehicle’s fuel consumption and longitudinal dynamics. This paper presents a math-based torque converter model that is able to capture both transient and steady-state characteristics. The torque converter is connected to a mean-value engine model, transmission model, and longitudinal dynamics model in the MapleSim environment, which uses the advantages of an acausal modeling approach. A <b>lock-up</b> <b>clutch</b> {{is added to the}} torque converter model to improve the efficiency of the powertrain in higher gear ratios, and its effect on the vehicle longitudinal dynamics (forward velocity and acceleration) is studied. We show that the proposed model can capture the transition from the forward flow to the reverse flow operations during engine braking or coasting. The simulation results also show that the engine braking phenomenon (due to the flow reversal) can effectively assist the braking system to slow down the vehicle...|$|E
40|$|Optimizing {{the vehicle}} system is {{essential}} for achieving higher fuel efficiency. This dissertation addresses the need to better understand energy demand from a vehicle subsystem standpoint and tackles the challenge of optimal hardware and control system design. An energy analysis methodology and Matlab®/Simulink® based tool are developed to account for where the fuel energy supplied to a vehicle system is demanded. A hybrid semi-empirical and analytical approach that combines first principles with detailed component speed and load data is proposed. The methodology and tool are applied {{to account for the}} instantaneous and accumulated vehicle subsystem energy usage over a given drive cycle. A comparison of the prevailing fuel economy factors for city and highway driving are presented. Incremental vehicle subsystem changes that account for a fraction of the total energy demand are analyzed to determine individual effects on overall fuel economy. A reverse dynamic optimization methodology is proposed for optimal powertrain integration and control design. A reverse tractive road load demand model developed in Matlab®/Simulink® propagates the required wheel torque and speed derived from vehicle speed and road grade through the powertrain system to determine the required fuel flow for all possible states within the hardware constraints. The control strategy is treated as a multi-stage, multi-dimension decision process, where dynamic programming is applied to find an optimal control policy that minimizes the accumulated fuel flow over a drive cycle. The reverse dynamic optimization methodology and tool are used to assess and develop transmission gear shift, torque converter <b>lock-up</b> <b>clutch,</b> and pedal control strategies that are catered to specific vehicle applications. The reverse model and dynamic optimization technique are extended to virtually optimize variable displacement engine operation taking gear and clutch control interaction effects into account. The reverse model is used for establishing design criteria, such as minimum engine part throttle torque requirements, by determining the required speeds and loads to traverse drive cycles. The advantages of the reverse dynamic optimization approach are demonstrated by performing powertrain matching analyses (i. e., vehicle attribute sensitivity analysis; optimal engine, transmission and axle selection; and variable displacement effects) and key system integration concepts are revealed...|$|E
