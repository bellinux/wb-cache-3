30|$|Avian {{leukosis}} (AL) {{is caused}} by the avian leukosis virus (ALV), which is associated with a variety of malignant neoplasms, including <b>lymphoid</b> and myeloid <b>leukosis,</b> and other production problems in chickens (Witter, 1997). AL is found in most countries that have large-scale farms {{and is one of the}} most harmful diseases in the poultry industry, causing serious economic losses (Sun and Cui 2007; Zhang et al. 2011). The ALV p 27 gene is a highly conserved gene among the different subtypes of ALV, and the p 27 antigen is a serogroup-specific antigen. This antigen can be detected by ELISA for many kinds of samples for the diagnosis of avian leukosis, such as albumen, vaginal secretions, meconium, cloaca cotton swab, and also can be used to detect the propagation of the virus (Spencer et al. 1984; Spencer et al. 1976; De Boer et al. 1984).|$|R
50|$|<b>Lymphoid</b> <b>leukosis</b> was {{eradicated}} {{in primary}} breeders in the 1980s and 1990s which dramatically reduced {{the incidence of}} the disease in commercial laying hens. Commercial broilers are still struggling with ALV-J virus in many countries. Both layers and broilers may still become infected, especially if there are contaminated vaccines.|$|E
50|$|Avian sarcoma {{leukosis}} {{virus is}} characterized by a wide range of tumors, the most common of which are lymphomas. <b>Lymphoid</b> <b>leukosis</b> is {{the most common form of}} this disease and with typical presentation of gradual onset, persistent low mortality, and neoplasia of the bursa. The disease is also characterized by an enlarged liver due to infiltration of cancerous lymphoid cells. In addition, other abdominal organs and the bursa of Fabricius are often infected.|$|E
50|$|Key {{clinical}} signs {{as well as}} gross and microscopic features that are most useful for differentiating Marek’s disease from <b>lymphoid</b> <b>leukosis</b> and reticuloendotheliosis include (1) Age: MD can affect birds at any age, including <16 weeks of age; (2) Clinical signs: Frequent wing and leg paralysis; (3) Incidence: >5% in unvaccinated flocks; (4) Potential nerve enlargement; (5) Interfollicular tumors in the bursa of Fabricius; (6) CNS involvement; (7) Lymphoid proliferation in skin and feather follicles; (8) Pleomorphic lymphoid cells in nerves and tumors; and (9) T-cell lymphomas.|$|E
50|$|The {{presence}} of nodules {{on the internal}} organs may also suggest Marek's disease, but further testing is required for confirmation. This is done through histological demonstration of lymphomatous infiltration into the affected tissue. A range of leukocytes can be involved, including lymphocytic cell lines such as large lymphocyte, lymphoblast, primitive reticular cells, and occasional plasma cells, as well as macrophage and plasma cells. The T cells {{are involved in the}} malignancy, showing neoplastic changes with evidence of mitosis. The lymphomatous infiltrates need to be differentiated from other conditions that affect poultry including <b>lymphoid</b> <b>leukosis</b> and reticuloendotheliosis, as well as an inflammatory event associated with hyperplastic changes of the affected tissue.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} cytologically the bone marrow (and peripheral blood) of adult laying hens affected with <b>lymphoid</b> <b>leukosis.</b> Diagnosis of the neoplasm was made on the basis of clinical history, signs and symptoms and pathology. Only histologically confirmed cases were included in the study. Examination of blood smears revealed + 2 heterophil toxicity and the presence of large numbers of reactive (blast – transformed) lymphocytes. Smears that were prepared from the bone marrow showed increased numbers of hemopoietic cells. The total erythrocyte count (TEC), hemoglobin percentage (Hb%), hemoglobin concentration (Hb conc.), packed cell volume (PCV) and the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) values were significantly higher (P< 0. 01) in hens with <b>lymphoid</b> <b>leukosis</b> than in apparently normal hens. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and the mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) were significantly lower (P< 0. 01) in hens with <b>lymphoid</b> <b>leukosis</b> than in apparently normal hens. Results of the leukogram indicated that the total leukocyte count (TLC) and the percentage (%) of lymphocytes were significantly higher (P < 0. 01) in hens with <b>lymphoid</b> <b>leukosis</b> than in apparently normal hens. From results of this study it was concluded that cytological evaluation of bone marrow may prove to be a simple, rapid, and useful tool in the diagnosis of <b>lymphoid</b> <b>leukosis</b> in laying hens...|$|E

40|$|There is {{considerable}} evidence that infection by avian <b>lymphoid</b> <b>leukosis</b> viruses can led to tumor {{development in the}} target organ of the host. The mechanism by which virus-induced oncogenic transformation occurs, however, is not clearly understood. As {{a first step toward}} deciphering this process, we have characterized the proviruses of the <b>lymphoid</b> <b>leukosis</b> viruses in DNAs extracted from the leukotic and metastatic tumors by using restriction enzyme digestion and filter hybridization analysis with radioactive probes specific for the infecting genome. Our results indicate (i) that <b>lymphoid</b> <b>leukosis</b> tumors are clonal in origin; (ii) that there are multiple sites in the cellular genome of the target tissue where the virus DNA can integrate and that, in the majority of the tumors, at least one such site of each tumor is adjacent to a cellular sequence related to the oncogene of MC- 29 virus; and (iii) that deletions and other structural alterations in the proviral DNA may facilitate tumorigenesis...|$|E
40|$|Chickens {{susceptible}} to infection with subgroup E viruses were inoculated with four independent isolates of Rous-associated virus type 60 (RAV- 60) that are subgroup e recombinants of endogenous and exogenous virus.

We report here that when 12 - to 13 -day-old embryos rather than 1 -day-old chickens were infected with RAV- 1, a novel B-cell lymphoma developed in which proviral insertions had activated expression of the c-myb gene. These tumors expressed elevated levels of a 4. 5 -kilobase myb-containing mRNA transcript that contained c-myb sequences not found in v-myb. The c-myc locus in these tumors appeared normal. The biological properties of the activated myb lymphoma were distinct from those of <b>lymphoid</b> <b>leukosis.</b> Metastatic disease developed within 7 weeks of infection. Distinct intermediate pathogenic stages with preneoplastic and primary neoplastic lesions were not detected. Although bursal tissues appeared to be nonmalignant on gross examination, Southern analyses of bursal DNA revealed the presence of tumor with the same clonal origin as abdominal lymphoma masses. The dependence on embryonic infection for development of activated myb lymphoma suggests that the target cells in which c-myb is activated are found only in embryos and are distinct from those cells that give rise to <b>lymphoid</b> <b>leukosis...</b>|$|E

40|$|Soon {{after it}} was {{established}} that normal lymphoid development proceeds along two distinct pathways of differentiation, it was recognized that lymphoid malignancies af-fected cells of either T or B lineage, and not both [I]. Studies conducted with animal models of lymphoblastic leukemias and lymphomas revealed that malignant T and B cells, like their normal counterparts, {{have their origin in}} central lymphoid tissues. The thymus is essential in the genesis of a vari-ety of murine lymphoid malignancies that are induced by oncogenic viruses, ionizing irradiation, carcinogenic hydrocarbons, and hormones, or that arise spontaneously in AKR mice (reviewed [2]). Removal of the thymus prevents these lymphoid malig-nancies, and thymus transplants restore susceptibility [2 - 41. This is due to an initial transformation of thymocytes with sub-sequent seeding or metastasis to peripheral tissues. On the other hand, the bursa of Fabricius is the source of malignant B cells in avian <b>lymphoid</b> <b>leukosis</b> [5, 6]. Avian <b>lymphoid</b> <b>leukosis</b> was the first model of a virus-induced B-cell malignancy and several of its features are relevant to the analysis of human B-cell malignancies. This B-cell lymphoma can be induced by infection of embryos or newly hatched chicks with avian group A leukemia re-troviruses 17, 81. The virus infects many cell types, but it selectively transforms B cells [6, 91. Moreover, the virus-induced transf-ormation only occurs at a very early stage in B-cell differentiation within the in...|$|E
40|$|Two {{subgroup}} F {{avian leukosis}} viruses, ring-necked pheasant virus (RPV) and RAV- 61, were previously shown to induce a {{high incidence of}} a fatal proliferative disorder in the lungs of infected chickens. These lung lesions, termed angiosarcomas, appear rapidly (4 to 5 weeks after infection), show no evidence of proto-oncogene activation by proviral integration, and are not induced by avian leukosis viruses belonging to other subgroups. To identify the viral sequences responsible for induction of these tumors, we constructed recombinant viruses by exchanging genomic segments of molecularly cloned RPV with those of a subgroup A leukosis virus, UR 2 AV. The ability to induce rapid lung tumors segregated only with the env sequences of RPV; the long terminal repeat of RPV was not required. However, recombinants carrying both env and long terminal repeat sequences of RPV induced lung tumors with a shorter latency. In several cases, recombinant viruses exhibited pathogenic properties differing from those of either parental virus. Recombinants carrying the gag-pol region of RPV and the env gene of UR 2 AV induced {{a high incidence of}} a muscle lesion termed infiltrative intramuscular fibromatosis. One recombinant, EU- 8, which carries the gag-pol and LTR sequences of RPV, and the env gene of UR 2 AV, induced <b>lymphoid</b> <b>leukosis</b> after an unusually short latent period. The median time of death from <b>lymphoid</b> <b>leukosis</b> was 6 to 7 weeks after infection with EU- 8 compared with approximately 5 months for UR 2 AV...|$|E

The histological study revealed neoplastic cells with pleomorphism, irregularly distributed with atypical mitotic figures, containing eosinophilic granulations, typical features of the myeloid lineage.

40|$|Avian {{leukosis}} viruses induce <b>lymphoid</b> <b>leukosis,</b> a lymphoma which develops {{within the}} bursa of Fabricius {{several months after}} virus infection. Chickens from the Hyline SC and FP lines are, respectively, susceptible and resistant to avian leukosis virus-induced <b>lymphoid</b> <b>leukosis.</b> We examined plasma and cellular DNA obtained from avian leukosis virus-infected chickens {{for the presence of}} viremia and integrated viral sequences to determine whether the extent of virus infection is comparable in individuals of both lines. A less than twofold difference in the frequency of viremia was detected between chickens of the two different lines. Although the analysis of plasma samples, which were obtained at different times postinfection, demonstrated that the duration of viremia was comparable in both susceptible and resistant chickens, the onset of the viremia observed in susceptible chickens generally preceded by 1 week that observed in resistant chickens. Moreover, integrated viral sequences were detected in approximately 90 % of the SC and 40 % of the FP chickens. The appearance of infectious virus in the plasma was, in general, associated with the presence of integrated viral sequences in both the bursal cells and the erythrocytes obtained from the same chicken. The presence of both the viremia and the integrated viral DNA sequences was transient, suggesting a mechanism for the elimination of virus-infected cells in both susceptible and resistant chickens. Furthermore, at 5 weeks postinfection no integrated exogenous viral sequences were detected in splenic lymphocytes obtained from either chicken line, regardless of whether these chickens were viremic or had integrated viral sequences detectable in other tissues. Our results indicate that extensive avian leukosis virus replication occurs in approximately 50 % of the FP and 100 % of the SC chickens. Although it appears that the viral infection spreads more quickly in the SC chickens, our results afford no obvious explanation of the resistance to the development of lymphoma exhibited by FP chickens...|$|E

40|$|Reticuloendotheliosis viruses (REVs) ` are a {{group of}} avian retroviruses that infect chickens, turkeys, and ducks (1). The {{prototype}} virus of this group is reticuloendotheliosis virus strain T, REV-T(REV-A), a mixture of a replicationdefective virus (REV-T) that induces acute neoplastic disease and a nondefective helper virus (REV-A) capable of inducing an immunosuppressive runting disease (2 - 4). REV-A and other nondefective REVS can be distinguished from REV-T by their ability to replicate in vitro in fibroblasts and their inability to induce acute neoplastic disease in vivo (5, 6). Some nondefective REVS, chick syncytial virus (CSV) and REV-A, induce a bursal-dependent B cell lymphoma that is indistinguishable from avian leukosis virus (ALV) -induced <b>lymphoid</b> <b>leukosis</b> (6, 7). These tumors develop after a long latent period, are monoclonal, and are characterized by proviral insertion within the c-myc locus (8, 9).

40|$|Treatment {{of chicken}} embryos with {{cyclophosphamide}} results in ablation of bursal lymphocytes. Bursal follicles can be reconstructed by infusion of embryonic bursal cells. Histologic examination of reconstituting bursal follicles {{showed that the}} first lymphocytes to appear were large pyrinophilic lymphoblasts that lined up adjacent to the bursal basement membrane and appeared to serve as progenitors for the differentiation of bursal medullary lymphocytes. When these cells were infected with the avian myelocytomatosis virus HB 1 bearing a v-myc oncogene they appeared to home to {{the region of the}} bursal basement membrane but failed to differentiate. Instead, they formed structures indistinguishable from the preneoplastic transformed follicles that develop during bursal lymphomagenesis induced by <b>lymphoid</b> <b>leukosis</b> viruses. The DNA from these transformed follicles contained the HB 1 v-myc gene but lacked the ability to transform NIH/ 3 T 3 mouse cells. Therefore these preneoplastic lesions were induced directly by HB 1 myc and did not require the expression of Blym- 1 or similar oncogenes.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{described}} an augmentation of avian leukosis virus (ALV) -induced <b>lymphoid</b> <b>leukosis</b> in chickens that were coinfected with a serotype 2 Marek's disease virus (MDV) strain, SB- 1. As {{a first step}} toward understanding the mechanism of this augmentation, we have analyzed the tropism of the MDV for the ALV-transformed B cell. After hatching, chickens were coinfected with ALV and a nonpathogenic strain of MDV, SB- 1. Seventy primary and metastatic ALV-induced lymphomas that developed in chickens between 14 and 20 weeks of age were found, with only one exception, to carry SB- 1 DNA. The MDV genome was maintained in cell lines derived from the tumors. However, MDV DNA could not be detected in nontransformed bursal B cells from chickens carrying ALV lymphomas. Moreover, during and after the lytic phase of MDV infection, SB- 1 DNA was near or below the level of detection in bursal cells, suggesting that MDV most likely infects only a small subpopulation of bursal cells. By contrast, ALV-transformed B cells from MDV-free chickens could be persistently infected with MDV in vitro. These findings indicate that ALV lymphoma cells, unlike nontransformed bursal B cells, are susceptible to persistent MDV infection and can serve as a reservoir of MDV that can potentially influence the physiology of the transformed cell...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{husbandry}} {{systems for}} laying hens were changed in Sweden {{during the years}} 2001 – 2004, {{and an increase in}} the number of submissions for necropsy from laying hen farms was noted. Hence, this study was initiated to compare causes of mortality in different housing systems for commercial laying hens during this change. Methods: Based on results from routine necropsies of 914 laying hens performed at the National Veterinary Institute (SVA) in Uppsala, Sweden between 2001 and 2004, a retrospective study on the occurrence of diseases and cannibalism, i. e., pecking leading to mortality, in different housing systems was carried out. Using the number of disease outbreaks in caged flocks as the baseline, the expected number of flocks with a certain category of disease in the other housing systems was estimated having regard to the total number of birds in the population. Whether the actual number of flocks significantly exceeded the expected number was determined using a Poisson distribution for the variance of the baseline number, a continuity correction and the exact value for the Poisson distribution function in Excel 2000. Results: Common causes of mortality in necropsied laying hens included colibacillosis, erysipelas, coccidiosis, red mite infestation, <b>lymphoid</b> <b>leukosis</b> and cannibalism.

40|$|Ring-necked {{pheasant}} virus, an {{avian leukosis}} virus, when injected into 10 -day old chick embryos, caused angiosarcomas {{in the lungs}} of infected chickens within a short time. Angiosarcomas appeared as localized foci of proliferating cells in the lungs as early as 2 weeks posthatch, and by 6 weeks, the lungs of the infected chickens were frequently filled with tumor cells. Between 3 and 10 weeks of age, 80 % of infected chickens died of the angiosarcomas; the 20 % which lived 8 weeks or longer had small lung lesions and also developed fibrosarcomas, osteopetrosis, nephroblastoma, and <b>lymphoid</b> <b>leukosis.</b> Chickens with lung tumors were cyanotic, had breathing difficulty, and had packed cell volumes in excess of 50 %. Other changes not necessarily correlated with lung tumor mass were stunting, lymphoid organ involution, and profuse diarrhea. Ring-necked pheasant virus has a genome RNA of 8. 2 kb. This observation, together with its replication and disease induction after repeated plaque purification, suggests that ring-necked pheasant virus is a replication-competent avian retrovirus. Therefore, our results suggest that ring-necked pheasant virus is an avian leukosis virus which causes angiosarcomas rapidly at high incidence and which, therefore, may induce this type of tumor by a mechanism different from the induction of sarcomas by avian sarcoma viruses...|$|E
40|$|Leukosis viruses {{of seven}} subgroups were tested for oncogenicity in {{chickens}} susceptible to virus infection and to development of <b>lymphoid</b> <b>leukosis</b> (LL) tumors. All subgroup A viruses and the subgroup B virus tested produced a {{high incidence of}} LL and other related neoplasms. Viruses of subgroup C and RAV- 61 of subgroup F produced a low level of LL. The RAV- 50 of subgroup D produced osteopetrosis. In these tests, the viruses of subgroup E and G and one virus of subgroup F were not pathogenic, possibly because infection was not established in the chickens, the chickens were not susceptible to tumor development by these viruses, or the viruses lacked oncogenicity. All temperature-sensitive mutants of Rous sarcoma virus produced sarcomas, but the level varied. One nontransforming mutant produced sarcomas, and the other three tested produced LL. All three mutants that cause cells to grow as colonies in agar produced {{a high incidence of}} sarcomas. Thus, sarcoma viruses, by back-mutation, may lose the ability to transform cells in vitro, to make cells grow in agar colonies, or to induce sarcomas in vivo, yet they retain the ability to produce LL. Conversely, it was previously shown that leukosis viruses may be changed into viruses that transform cells in vitro and produce sarcomas in vivo by suitable passage in chicks...|$|E
40|$|EU- 8 is a {{recombinant}} {{avian leukosis}} virus (ALV) constructed in vitro, which carries long terminal repeats and gag and pol genes from ring-necked pheasant virus and the env gene from UR 2 AV.

These tumors differ from the classic <b>lymphoid</b> <b>leukosis</b> induced by ALV in several respects, both biologically and at the molecular level. Most notably, in all of the EU- 8 -induced tumors examined, the provirus was integrated in the c-myb locus, and in no tumors were c-myc integrations found. Most of the proviral integrations were downstream of the initiation codon of c-myb and thus presumably resulted in some truncation of the c-myb gene product, although not to the same extent as has been found in other cases of c-myb activation. In addition, several of the proviruses were integrated well upstream of the c-myb coding region. This is the first report of ALV interaction with the c-myb proto-oncogene and the first report of c-myb activation resulting in tumors of lymphoid rather than myeloid origin, suggesting that the target cell specificity of transformation by the myb gene is not as restricted as previously believed...|$|E
40|$|F 2, and {{reciprocal}} backcross progenies {{of these}} lines {{were used to}} investigate host-gene effects upon the regression of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) -induced tumors. Lines 6 t and 63 were suscepti-ble to subgroup A and C <b>lymphoid</b> <b>leukosis</b> (LL) viruses and line 72 was resistant to subgroup A but was segregating for susceptibility to subgroup C LL virus. Viruses of RSV subgroups A and C were used. Lines 6,, 6 3, and 72 were homozygous for shared blood group alleles B 2, Cs, L 1, and r. The incidence of tumor regression was higher in line 63 than in 7 2, and in reciprocal F [crosses of these lines was of the same order of magnitude as in line 6 3. Progeny from F, generation par-ents mated to line 63 had a higher frequency of regression than offspring from F, generation parents mated to line 7 2. The frequency of regression in F 2 generation offspring was intermediate between the two backcrosses. The data suggest that either a locus (or loci) other than L and B has a role in Rous tumor regres-sion in this species or the immune response region of the B blood group-major histocompatibility complex differs in the two lines even though the serological and/or graft vs. host regions have not been shown to differ...|$|E
