25|$|Rashid Rida popularized {{the term}} 'Salafī' to {{describe}} a particular movement (i.e., Islamic modernism) that he spearheaded. That movement sought to reject the ossification of the madhhabs, and rethink through the standard issues of fiqh and modernity, at times in very liberal ways. A young scholar {{by the name of}} Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani read an article by Rida, and then took this term and used it {{to describe a}}nother, completely different movement. Ironically, the movement that Rida spearheaded eventually became Modernist Islam and dropped the 'Salafī' label, and the <b>legal</b> <b>methodology</b> that al-Albānī championed – with a very minimal overlap with Rida's vision of Islam – retained the appellation Salafī'. Eventually, al-Albānī's label was adopted by the Najdī daʿwah as well, until it spread in all trends of the movement. Otherwise, before this century, the term 'Salafī' was not used as a common label and proper noun. Therefore, the term 'Salafī' has attached itself to an age-old school of theology, the Atharī school.|$|E
500|$|As {{a part of}} the Kinnock controversy, it was {{revealed}} that Biden had been involved in a similar incident during his first year at Syracuse University School of Law in 1965. Biden initially received an “F” in an introductory class on <b>legal</b> <b>methodology</b> for writing a paper relying almost exclusively on a single Fordham Law Review article, which he had cited only once. [...] Biden was allowed to repeat the course and passed with high marks. Though the then-dean of the law school, as well as Biden's former professor, downplayed the incident, they did find that Biden drew [...] "chunks of heavy legal prose directly from" [...] the article in question. Biden said it was inadvertent due to his not knowing the proper rules of citation. After ending his Presidential campaign, Biden requested the Board of Professional Responsibility of the Delaware Supreme Court review the issue. The Board concluded on December 21, 1987, after Biden had withdrawn, that the senator had not violated any rules, although Biden did not release this result until May 1989.|$|E

Paradox mentionings {{have become}} fashionable in {{scholarly}} literature, but are essentially incomplete. Consequently, {{the question arises}} whether paradoxophilia is law’s disease or a mere obsession of some legal scholars. A comparison between paradoxes and legal decision-making situations reveals that law in fact suffers from paradoxophilia. The problem posed by legal decision-making situations is structurally identical to the problem posed by paradoxes. A diagnosis of paradoxophilia and the insight into {{the structure of the}} disease determines the therapy. <b>Legal</b> <b>methodologies</b> are supposed to guide the decision-making process. However, in order to do so, they must offer something that could be called paradoxicality management. This in turn deepens the understanding of methodological doctrines and opens up a perspective under which <b>legal</b> <b>methodologies</b> can be assessed...|$|R

While European lawyers and courts throughout Europe accept the 'constitutionalisation' of European economic law and human rights law (HRL) as legal facts and normative challenges, legal discourse about 'constitutionalisation' of UN and WTO law and governance remains contested and often confusing due to inadequate clarification of legal terminologies, research methods and diverse conceptions {{of international law and}} multilevel governance of PGs...|$|R

This [...] "traditionalizing" [...] of legal reasoning is exemplified in the work of Malik's student Al-Shafi‘i, which laid the foundation of the Shafi'i legal school. In turn, Hanbali jurists, who led the traditionalist movement and initially opposed the use of qiyas, gradually came to accept it as long as its application was strictly founded on scriptural sources.|$|R

40|$|Writing as the {{recognizable}} modern idea of {{the state}} was being framed, Hugo Grotius (1583 - 1645), Thomas Hobbes (1588 - 1679) and Samuel Pufendorf (1632 - 94) each took distinctive approaches {{to the problems of}} whether and how there could be any legal or moral norms between these states in their emerging forms. They differed in their views of obligation in the state of nature (where ex hypothesi there was no state), in {{the extent to which they}} regarded these sovereign states as analogous to individuals in the state of nature, and in the effects they attributed to commerce as a driver of sociability and of norm-structured interactions not dependent on an overarching state. This paper explores the differences between their views on these issues, differences which contributed to the development of the thought of later writers such as Emer de Vattel (1714 - 67), David Hume (1711 - 76), and Adam Smith (1723 - 90), and eventually in more attenuated ways to the different empirical <b>legal</b> <b>methodologies</b> of Jeremy Bentham (1748 - 1832) and Georg Friedrich von Martens (1756 - 1821) ...|$|R

The essay also foregrounds the conditions of possibility, including feminist <b>legal</b> <b>methodologies,</b> that enable women to (re) turn to the law despite its transgressions. In doing so it argues for seeing the law as multilayered and recursive, reflecting the thick and uneven conditions under which women access justice in Sri Lanka.

40|$|Innovation in the {{computer}} software industry over the past 15 years increased at a frantic pace {{thanks in part to}} the Open Source Software movement. This community of software developers uses <b>legal</b> <b>methodologies</b> to enforce rights and induce others to follow their lead and with openness has come more innovation. The Free Software Foundation’s General Public License (GPL) in particular embodies this spirit and uses a kind of recursive philanthropy or an Open Source-only sandbox, which requires other developers to create their software under licenses with compatible philosophies. How the propagation of these licenses effects innovation in the software industry is the subject of this paper. This inquiry will examine methods used in other industries that embody similar propagation devices from which subsequent Open Source licenses could benefit, proposing that Open Source must balance the risk Open Source companies face with the basic donative intent of the community to continue to offer a cohesive doctrine other developers will continue to follow. In light of the most recent version of the GPL, this paper examines the drafting and revision process the community undertook and will examine what compromises resulted. This process, while a groundbreaking step for the community, necessarily creates new issues to be resolved and may be more reactionary to current events than necessary to support the community’s goals of greater innovation...|$|R
