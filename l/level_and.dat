The study was designed to evaluate the effect of stress on other risk factors of CSC such as serum cortisol levels, serum homocysteine <b>levels,</b> <b>and</b> blood pressure (BP) in CSC patients. Aims: To compare stress scores, serum cortisol <b>and</b> serum homocysteine <b>levels,</b> <b>and</b> BP of CSC patients with that of control population and to correlate stress scores of CSC patients with BP, serum cortisol <b>levels,</b> <b>and</b> serum homocysteine <b>levels.</b> Materials <b>and</b> Methods: Stress scores, serum morning <b>and</b> evening cortisol <b>levels,</b> serum homocysteine <b>levels,</b> systolic <b>and</b> diastolic BP of 54 CSC patients were measured and compared with that of 54 age- and sex-related controls using Student′s t-test. Stress scores of CSC patients were correlated with systolic and diastolic BP, serum morning <b>and</b> evening cortisol <b>levels</b> <b>and</b> serum homocysteine <b>levels</b> <b>and</b> Pearson correlation coefficient (r) were calculated. Results: Stress scores, serum homocysteine <b>levels,</b> serum morning <b>and</b> evening cortisol <b>levels,</b> <b>and</b> systolic and diastolic BP were all elevated in CSC patients as compared with age- and sex-related controls (P < 0. 05). Stress scores of CSC patients were found to correlate strongly with serum homocysteine <b>levels,</b> serum morning <b>and</b> evening cortisol <b>levels,</b> <b>and</b> systolic and diastolic BP, with r values 0. 82, 0. 8, 0. 8, 0. 8, and 0. 81, respectively (P < 0. 0001). Conclusions: Stress scores were elevated in CSC patients and were strongly correlated with serum homocysteine <b>and</b> cortisol <b>levels</b> <b>and</b> BP...|$|R

Twenty-four hours after the onset of antibiotic treatment, the C-reactive protein (CRP) level continued to be high, while the serum interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) <b>levels</b> <b>and</b> the urine IL- 6, IL- 8, albumin, and immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels decreased significantly. In contrast, serum creatinine and tumor necrosis factor alpha <b>levels</b> <b>and</b> urine N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase, α 1 -microglobulin, and β 2 -microglobulin levels did not change over time.
