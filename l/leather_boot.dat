500|$|On October 31, 2013, Gaga {{revealed}} via Twitter that [...] "Dope" [...] {{would be}} the final song available for purchase before the release of Artpop, accessible for digital download from November 4. The single's cover art was also revealed, depicting Gaga wearing a black floppy hat with her brunette hair falling over her shoulders, an oversized [...] "boxy" [...] double-breasted blazer, sheer underwear, one black <b>leather</b> <b>boot</b> and a grill that made her teeth appear larger. Her eyes are covered by a scarf and she has bruises on her belly and around her crotch area. Idolator writer Mike Wass named the cover art [...] "a cross between Frankenstein and Michael Jackson". Matthew Jacobs from The Huffington Post found the cover relatively modest compared to the previous single covers of songs from Artpop. John Walker from MTV News compared the cover to director Tim Burton's works and called it [...] "terrifying". He described Gaga's face and the grills as [...] " [...] the gum-less teeth of a long-buried skull cast in titanium" [...] and believed that the hands and legs were prosthetic. Walker concluded {{by saying that the}} cover reminded him of a [...] "bizarro world" [...] version of singer Janet Jackson's [...] for a 1993 Rolling Stone issue. Lily Harrison from E! Online complimented Gaga for taking the fashion of grills to a [...] "whole new level". She commended the singer's ability to portray her toned figure in spite of the [...] "odd ensemble". A writer for Metro felt that the singer was as [...] "peculiar as ever" [...] on the artwork. Emma Kelly from Daily Star called the cover [...] "creepier" [...] than any horror film and felt that the wide jacket made the singer appear as a rugby player. She compared the digitally altered smile on the single cover to the cover of electronic musician Aphex Twin's EP, Come to Daddy (1997) which features similar inflated grills. Fashion website Refinery29's Leila Brillson felt that the artwork was more of a surrealist move which made Gaga look like a [...] "nightmarish" [...] version of virtual band Gorillaz. Brillson was also unclear if the bruises were related to the song.|$|E

[...] Then, {{turning to}} Francie, whom he {{considered}} 'smart,' he added: [...] "You {{come with me}} for a drive one of these days." [...] But this conjured up the vision of that other eventful drive which had been so much talked about, and he stood quite still for a second, with glassy eyes, as though waiting {{to catch up with the}} significance of what he himself had said; then, suddenly recollecting that he didn't care a damn, he turned to old Jolyon: [...] "Well, good-bye, Jolyon! You shouldn't go about without an overcoat; you'll be getting sciatica or something!" [...] And, kicking the cat slightly with the pointed tip of his patent <b>leather</b> <b>boot,</b> he took his huge form away.|$|E

An habitue, sipping claret at a table across the little room, watched them in a mirror, and there came into his old heart a glow of warmth, half ache, half sympathy; a smile of {{understanding}} stirred the crow's-feet round his eyes. Its sweetness ebbed, and left a little grin about his shaven lips. Behind the archway in the neighbouring room two waiters met, and in their nods and glances was that same unconscious sympathy, the same conscious grin. And the old habitue thought: ...|$|E

Ah, those were golden days!' and he sighed. 'I am a Frenchman. Need I say, messieurs, that I admire beauty? Nay, I adore the fair. Messieurs, we admire all the roses in a garden, but we pluck one. I plucked one, and alas, messieurs, it pricked my finger. She was a chambermaid, her name Annette, her figure ravishing, her face an angel's, her heart -- alas, messieurs, that I should have to own it! -- black and {{slippery}} as a patent <b>leather</b> <b>boot.</b> I loved to desperation, I adored her to despair. She transported me -- in every sense; she inspired me. Never have I cooked as I cooked (for I had been promoted at the hotel) when Annette, my adored Annette, smiled on me. Never' -- and here his manly voice broke into a sob -- 'never shall I cook so well again.' Here he melted into tears.|$|E

Before me was a great <b>leather</b> <b>boot.</b> The boot was {{fastened}} to an iron bar that went across in front, so that it did not come against my knees. Above me was the bellows-top, to keep off the rain. Up under the roof of the bellows-top there was a sash folded together and fastened up by straps. I unfastened one of the straps, and saw that I could let down the sash if I wished, and thus make a glass window in front of me, so as to shut me in nicely from the wind, if it should grow cold in the night. Behind me was a curtain. The curtain was loose. I pushed it back, and found I could look out on the top of the diligence where the men were at work packing the trunks and baggage. The men wore blue frocks shaped like cartmen's frocks.[C] ...|$|E
60|$|We had {{now come}} to the point of rocks on which the ship had struck, but did not find a single article, {{although}} we searched carefully among the coral rocks, which at this place jutted out so far as nearly to join the reef that encircled the island. Just as we were about to return, however, we saw something black floating in a little cove that had escaped our observation. Running forward, we drew it from the water, and found it to be a long, thick, <b>leather</b> <b>boot,</b> such as fishermen at home wear; and a few paces farther on, we picked up its fellow. We at once recognised these as having belonged to our captain, for he had worn them during the whole of the storm in order to guard his legs from the waves and spray that constantly washed over our decks. My first thought on seeing them was that our dear captain had been drowned; but Jack soon put my mind more at rest on that point by saying that if the captain had been drowned with the boots on, he would certainly have been washed ashore along with them, and that he had no doubt whatever he had kicked them off while in the sea that he might swim more easily.|$|E

6000|$|There was {{the clear}} roll of wheels along the smooth, frozen {{carriage}} sweep towards the house, the sharp crisp click of hoofs on stone, {{the opening of}} heavy doors, the sudden sparkling invasion of frigid air, the uplifting of voices in greeting,--but all familiar! There were Gabriel Lane's cheery, hopeful tones, the soprano of Cousin Jane and Cousin Emma, the baritone of Mr. Gunn, and the grave measured oratorical utterance of Parson Dexter, who had joined the party at the station; but certainly the accents of no STRANGER. Had he come? Yes, for his name was just then called, and the quick ear of Marie had detected a light, lounging, alien footstep cross the cold strip of marble vestibule. The two girls exchanged a rapid glance; each looked into the mirror, and then interrogatively at the other, nodded their heads affirmatively, and descended to the drawing-room. A group had already drawn round the fire, and a small central figure, who, with its back turned towards them, was still enwrapped in an enormous overcoat of rich fur, was engaged in presenting an alternate small varnished <b>leather</b> <b>boot</b> to {{the warmth of the}} grate. As they entered the room the heavy fur was yielded up with apparent reluctance, and revealed to the astonished girls a man of ordinary stature with a slight and elegant figure set off by a traveling suit of irreproachable cut. His light reddish-yellow hair, mustache, and sunburned cheek, which seemed all of one color and outline, made it impossible to detect the gray of the one or the hollowness of the other, and gave no indication of his age. Yet there was clearly no mistake. Here was Gabriel Lane seizing their nervously cold fingers and presenting them to their [...] "Uncle Sylvester." ...|$|E
