The coastline has retreated noticeably in the last 2,000 years, with many former settlements now flooded, particularly Ravenser Odd and Ravenspurn, which was a major port until its destruction in the 14th century. Erosion is an ongoing concern in the area. The East Riding of Yorkshire Council has been carrying out cliff erosion defences between Sewerby and Kilnsea since 1951.

In a diametrically opposing view, another group of geologists propose a crustal thinning theory, block faulting and a ridge formed in the region owing to thinning and asserts that development of this ridge augmented the coral growth in the area and inturn coral cover acted as a `sand trapper'.|$|R

About 3,500 years ago, the currents moved in an anti-clockwise direction in the north and clockwise direction in the south of Rameswaram and Talaimannar.

A former director of the Geological Survey of India, S.

Onshore winds generates fi ne, well sorted, near symmetrical dune sands with mesokurtic distributions in the El Vizcaíno Desert inherited from beach sands from the Vizcaíno bay. The coastal and inland dune sands are derived from nearby sand sources like the beach sands and also from alluvial deposits originated from sedimentary-volcanic and schists, granitic and granodiorite sources.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{modified}} version of the CERC formula, which relates <b>longshore</b> sediment <b>drift</b> to deep water wave height and direction, has been used to define the equivalent wave height. The directional distribution of these wave heights and corresponding sediment transport rates and their analytical approximations are found using statistical analysis of high quality directional wave data measured simultaneously at two sites, Ashdod and Haifa. The directional distributions enable one to determine the directional shift between the average wave directions at both sites and to find the necessary corrections of wave directions at any location along the coast. The results emphasize the importance of accounting for wave directional shift in sediment transport calculations even when the locations are close. A detailed computation of directional shift for different ranges of wave heights is performed using correlation analysis of data sets. The corrections of wave directions at various locations along the coast are found by interpolation, and an excellent agreement between sediment fluxes at each location has been obtained when using the LITPACK package for littoral transport simulations with each data set...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{total length}} of the Black Sea {{coastline}} is over 4 400 km and belongs to 6 states: Bulgaria, Turkey, Georgia, Russian Federation, Ukraine and Romania. The proposed zoning of the Black Sea coastal zone evidences 17 main sections characterised by different geology and morphology, as well as specific littoral water circulation, sediment drift systems and sedimentary budget. These zones belong to three main morphodynamic categories: (1) low, accumulative coasts mostly related to the rivers mouth zones (mainly sandy complex barrier beaches with strong <b>longshore</b> sediment <b>drift</b> systems); (2) Erosive coasts within lowstanding plateaux and plains, with active cliffs with very narrow beaches {{in front of the}} cliffs; (3) Mountainous coasts, with cliffs, marine terraces, land slides, sometimes with sandy or gravely beaches.

25|$|<b>Longshore</b> <b>drift</b> of {{sediment}} {{is important for}} distributing sediment along the coast, and {{is considered one of}} the most important mechanisms. The <b>longshore</b> <b>drift</b> {{of sediment}} can be considered both a source and a sink due to the fact that in some case it can add sediment to a coastline but in others transport sediment away from a coastline. An example of both extremes of <b>longshore</b> <b>drift</b> can be found on the Canterbury coastline in New Zealand, either side of Banks Peninsular. Both the Waimakariri River in the north and the Canterbury Bight in the south of the Banks Peninsula provide large amounts of sediment respectively. The difference is the sediment supplied by the Waimakariri River is a source for the coast's New Brighton spit due to the reversal of southern currents transporting sediment to the south. In contrast the Canterbury Bight has a combination of high energy environments and strong southern longshore currents that transport large amounts of sediment north, which can be classified as a sink, putting a deficit to the coasts sedimentary budget. As a result, there is erosion of the Canterbury Bight and a predominantly balanced New Brighton Spit.|$|E

40|$|In situ {{abrasion}} of shingle beach {{material is}} a neglected {{area of study}} in coastal geomorphology, with reduction in beach volumes normally attributed to <b>longshore</b> and offshore <b>drift.</b> Results from field abrasion experiments conducted on flint shingle beaches on the East Sussex coast, southern England, show that in situ reductions in volume of beach material may be more significant than has been thought. Two beaches composed almost entirely of flint shingle were seeded with hard quartzite from a Devon beach and less resistant limestone from a South Wales beach that are readily distinguishable from the flint. The seeding commenced in January 2001. The pebbles, similar in size and shape to the natural flint shingle, were left in the surf zone at two sites. Prior to exposure the pebbles were engraved with a code number and weighed. At regular intervals those that could be re-found were re-weighed {{and returned to the}} beach. Abrasion rates were calculated for each pebble as percentage weight loss per tide. By the end of October 2001, more than 700 measurements of abrasion rates had been made from a total of 431 pebbles.

40|$|The short, {{medium and}} {{long-term}} {{evolution of the}} sandy coastline of the Bight of Benin in the Gulf of Guinea, West Africa, {{has become a major}} regional focal point due to the rapid socio-economic development that is occurring in the region, including rapid urbanization and a sharp increase in harbor-based trade. Harbors {{have a significant impact on}} the present evolution of this coast, notably by affecting longshore sediment transport. However, little is known of the environmental drivers, notably the wave climate, that governs longshore sediment transport and the ensuing pattern of shoreline evolution of this coastal zone. This article aims to address this important knowledge gap by providing a general overview of coastal evolution in the Bight of Benin and the physical processes that control this evolution. Here, the 1979 - 2012 ERA-Interim hindcast is used to understand the temporal dynamics of longshore sediment transport. Oblique waves (annual average H-s,= 1. 36 m, T-p= 9. 6 s, S-SW incidence) drive an eastward drift of approximately 500, 000 m(3) /yr. The waves driving this large longshore transport can be separated into two components with distinct origins and behavior: wind waves generated locally in the Gulf of Guinea and swell waves generated in the southern hemisphere sub- (30 - 35 degrees S), and extra-tropics (45 - 60 degrees S). The analysis undertaken here shows that the contribution to the gross annual longshore transport from swell wave-driven longshore currents is an order of magnitude larger than the local wind wave-driven longshore currents. Swell waves are dominantly generated by westerlies in the 40 - 60 degrees S zone and to a lesser extent by trade winds at 30 - 35 degrees S. The <b>longshore</b> sediment <b>drift</b> decay (- 5 % over 1979 - 2012) is found to be linked with a decrease in the intensity of westerly winds associated with their southward shift, in addition to a strengthening of the trade winds, which reduces the eastward sediment transport potential. The equatorial fluctuation of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is found to explain most of the variability in transport induced by wind waves, while the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), an extra-tropical mode, has a predominant influence on transport induced by swell waves. The ITCZ and SAM have, respectively, a negative and positive trend over the period 1979 - 2012 that explains the decrease in both wind- and swell-wave-induced transport. For future scenarii, General Circulation Models (GCMs) predict a stabilization of the SAM, and, thus, a non-substantial or weak change in longshore sediment transport can be expected on the coast of the Bight of Benin...|$|R

40|$|In {{this report}} a study is {{presented}} concerning the morphological impact of breakwater structures perpendicular to a coast. This study was initially {{associated with the}} Indian coast between Chennai (formerly known as Madras) and Ennore in India. Like many ports, the harbour of Chennai had, and still has a considerable morphological impact on the surrounding coast. By obstructing the longshore transport, {{the presence of the}} breakwaters caused accretion and erosion. Construction of a new harbour near Ennore, 20 km north of Chennai, started in 1997. During construction of the harbour similar effects like near the Chennai Port are visible. Morphological consequences of these harbours can be simulated and predicted by a morphodynamic model. The objective {{of this study is to}} design a morphological model of the coast between Chennai and Ennore, and calibrate this model by means of the recorded coastline advancement near the Chennai Port. The time period for these morphological simulations is set to 25 years. Use is made of DELFT 2 D-MOR, a software package developed by WL I Delft Hydraulics. This numerical program offers a wide range of tools for implementing physical processes that determine coastal morphology. The objective mentioned above could not be met within the timeframe of this study. In the course of this study, the implementation of breakwater structures appeared to be more complicated than expected. Hence a greatly simplified representation of the real situation has been modelled: simulations have been carried out for a breakwater, perpendicular to the shore where only waves determine the morphological behaviour. The following conclusions can be drawn: a) The present definition of structures like breakwaters in the computational area of DELFT 2 D-MOR is not suitable for morphological calculations. The breakwaters do not obstruct the longshore sediment transport properly. Most of the incoming sediment does not settle, but "disappears" near the breakwater. A large portion of the <b>longshore</b> sediment <b>drift</b> therefore does not contribute to beach accretion. These structures have to be implemented as closed boundaries within the computational area. b) If the breakwaters are implemented as closed boundaries, DELFT 2 D-MOR is able to simulate the accretion process due to the presence of a breakwater. The numerical model responds well to input with respect to varying particle size, and varying bottom roughness. c) The erosion process in DELFT 2 D-MOR is not simulated properly. Although coastline retreat is taking place, the erosion mainly generates unrealistic steep beach slopes. d) The single line theory of Pelnard-Considere yields the same results with respect to coastline advancement near the breakwater, compared to DELFT 2 D-MOR. The similarity with the computational results only holds for the accreting coastline. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Sillon de Talbert is {{the largest}} gravel barrier spit in Brittany and forms a swash-aligned {{formation}} exposed to swell that enters the English Channel from the west. It partially protects the islands of the Bréhat Archipelago against coastal erosion and marine flooding of low-lying land. The main morphological changes to the Sillon de Talbert have been studied since the 17 th century, and were accurately quantified between 1930 and 2010, based on early marine maps, aerial photographs and topographic surveys recently conducted by DGPS. The examination of early maps shows that this barrier {{was attached to the}} Olone Islands {{until the end of the}} 17 th century. Towards the mid- 18 th century, a breach that had formed in the north of the barrier resulted in its transformation into a trailing spit. A gradual change in its general direction towards a more drift-aligned position promoted <b>longshore</b> sediment <b>drift</b> towards the distal end. A slow cannibalisation processes began, dividing the spit into a source area at the proximal section, a transit zone in the median section and an accumulation zone at the distal section of the spit. Long-term analysis of shoreline changes over the past decades highlights the mobility of the Sillon de Talbert, which is characterized by rapid landward retreat by rollover. This trend is mainly due to a sediment supply deficit, which can be explained above all by sediment depletion on the continental shelf and, to a lesser extent, by anthropogenic activities particularly gravel extraction. The results obtained show that for the entire period (1930 - 2010), the mean migration rate was 1. 1 m/yr. Upon closer investigation, the rate of retreat and the main morphological changes proves to differ between the morphosedimentary units of the spit and illustrates cannibalisation processes. Thus, the proximal section shows very high retreat rates (1. 35 m/yr) due to a sediment budget deficit, which can be explained by gravel migration towards the north-east section of the spit. For these sections, this evolution results in greater sensitivity to erosion and breaching during severe storms, as was the case in April 1962 and during winter 1989 - 90. Its median section corresponding to the transit zone, shows lower retreat rates than the proximal section (1. 05 m/yr) and a relatively balanced sediment budget, as illustrated by the high resilience of this section of the spit submitted to sluicing overwash. Finally, the distal section has undergone retreat by rollover of its exposed outer face and progradation of its inner face which benefited from sediment supply from proximal section. From the 1970 s, several human interventions based on coastal defense strategy attempted to slow the spit's retreat due to rollover. The failure of these interventions led to the definition of a new coastal management policy in 2004...|$|R

However, the dynamics of the Langue de Barbarie are still complex and little known, as regards in particular the impact of the swell on the shore and the dynamic response of the latter, the contributions of sand and their redistribution by the swell through coastal <b>drift,</b> <b>longshore</b> sediment transport and its interaction with anthropogenic actions (defense works, breach [...] .), sedimentary bypass and sedimentary exchanges between the delta of the stream and the delta of the adjacent mouth [...] . which does not facilitate the forecast of scenarios of geomorphological evolution of this coastal arrow whose socio-economic and environmental stakes are unquestionably strong. The lagoon water level behind the Langue de Barbarie tended to rise considerably during a period of high flooding of the Senegal River, particularly during the rainy season, causing repeated flooding in the town of Saint-Louis and its surroundings. It was during one of these flood cycles that, on the decision of the local authorities, a breach 4 meters wide was opened on the coastal spit in October 2003, with the aim of sparing the historic island of a risk of flooding. The opening of this breach certainly made it possible to lower the water level in Saint-Louis, but reveals in consequence serious problems of management and coastal management.
