25|$|An {{important}} factor that distinguishes different radiation types {{from one another}} is the <b>linear</b> <b>energy</b> transfer (LET), which is {{the rate at which}} the radiation loses energy with distance traveled through the absorber. Low LET species are usually low mass, either photons or electron mass species (β particles, positrons) and interact sparsely along their path through the absorber, leading to isolated regions of reactive radical species. High LET species are usually greater in mass than one electron, for example α particles, and lose energy rapidly resulting in a cluster of ionisation events in close proximity to one another. Consequently, the heavy particle travels a relatively short distance from its origin.|$|E
25|$|Charged {{particles}} such as {{protons and}} boron, carbon, and neon ions can cause direct damage to cancer cell DNA through high-LET (<b>linear</b> <b>energy</b> transfer) {{and have an}} antitumor effect independent of tumor oxygen supply because these particles act mostly via direct energy transfer usually causing double-stranded DNA breaks. Due to their relatively large mass, protons and other charged particles have little lateral side scatter in the tissue—the beam does not broaden much, stays focused on the tumor shape, and delivers small dose side-effects to surrounding tissue. They also more precisely target the tumor using the Bragg peak effect. See proton therapy for {{a good example of}} the different effects of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) vs. charged particle therapy. This procedure reduces damage to healthy tissue between the charged particle radiation source and the tumor and sets a finite range for tissue damage after the tumor has been reached. In contrast, IMRT's use of uncharged particles causes its energy to damage healthy cells when it exits the body. This exiting damage is not therapeutic, can increase treatment side effects, and increases the probability of secondary cancer induction. This difference is very important in cases where the close proximity of other organs makes any stray ionization very damaging (example: head and neck cancers).|$|E
25|$|Several {{experimental}} studies, {{which use}} heavy ion beams simulating space radiation, provide constructive {{evidence of the}} CNS risks from space radiation. First, exposure to HZE nuclei at low doses (<50 cGy) significantly induces neurocognitive deficits, such as learning and behavioral changes as well as operant reactions in the mouse and rat. Exposures to equal or higher doses of low-LET radiation (e.g., gamma or X rays) do not show similar effects. The threshold of performance deficit following exposure to HZE nuclei depends on both the physical characteristics of the particles, such as <b>linear</b> <b>energy</b> transfer (LET), and the animal age at exposure. A performance deficit {{has been shown to}} occur at doses that are similar to the ones that will occur on a Mars mission (<0.5 Gy). The neurocognitive deficits with the dopaminergic nervous system are similar to aging and appear to be unique to space radiation. Second, exposure to HZE disrupts neurogenesis in mice at low doses (<1 Gy), showing a significant dose-related reduction of new neurons and oligodendrocytes in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Third, reactive oxygen species (ROS) in neuronal precursor cells arise following exposure to HZE nuclei and protons at low dose, and can persist for several months. Antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents can possibly reduce these changes. Fourth, neuroinflammation arises from the CNS following exposure to HZE nuclei and protons. In addition, age-related genetic changes increase the sensitivity of the CNS to radiation.|$|E

40|$|Since Hansch's extra {{thermodynamic}} multi-parameter approach, originally coined as <b>Linear</b> Free <b>Energy</b> Relationship, great {{efforts in}} medicinal chemistry {{have been made}} to properly estimate the binding free energy. Despite the often small amount, its value is however very critical in determining a successful binding. As a result, its correct estimate may provide a guide for a prospective rational drug design. The calculation of the absolute binding free energies is however a very challenging task as it requires a rigorous treatment of a number of physical terms that are both very time demanding and to some extent not immediately interpretable. In view of this, the introduction of some numerical approximations has permitted to develop the so called <b>Linear</b> Interaction <b>Energy</b> method that, at present, constitutes the best compromise among accuracy, speed of computation and easy interpretation.
