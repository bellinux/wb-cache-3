Disturbed by his presence, the boar made three fierce bounds in his direction, but Cadoc's life was spared when the boar miraculously disappeared. Cadoc took this as a heavenly sign, and marked the spot with three tree branches. The valley was owned by his uncle, King Pawl of Penychen, who made a present of the land to his nephew. The location later became {{the site of the}} great church college and monastery at Llancarvan.|$|E

25|$|In 1804, while Rapp and his {{associates}} remained in the United States <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> settle, his followers sailed to America aboard several vessels and {{made their way to}} western Pennsylvania, where they waited until land had been selected for their new settlement. Rapp was able to secure a large tract of land in Pennsylvania and started his first commune, known as Harmonie or Harmony, in Butler County, Pennsylvania, where the Society existed from 1804 to 1815. It soon grew to a population of about 800, and was highly profitable. Ten years later, the town was sold and the Harmonists moved westward to the Indiana Territory, where they established the town of Harmony, now called New Harmony, Indiana, and remained there from 1815 to 1825. The Indiana settlement was sold to Robert Owen and was renamed New Harmony. Ten years after the move to Indiana the commune moved again, this time returning to western Pennsylvania, and named their third and final town Economy ('Ökonomie' in German). The Harmonists lived in Economy until the Society was dissolved in 1905.|$|E
25|$|Riley's group {{arrives at}} the city only to come upon a raised drawbridge. Riley leaves to bring the bridge down, but {{a small group of}} zombies begin to attack Dead Reckoning. Riley and the others manage to dispose of and evade the zombies. After {{crossing}} the bridge, they helplessly witness people being killed by the zombies. Realizing it is too late to save them, they mercy kill them with missiles. It is then revealed that most of the poor people were led to safety by Mulligan, thus surviving the assault. Riley and Mulligan share a well-meaning goodbye as they split up with their groups. As they see Big Daddy and the zombies (who are, curiously, not attacking the surviving humans) leaving the city, Riley decides to leave them alone, citing that they are just <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> go, too. While lighting {{up the rest of the}} fireworks (which were earlier used to distract the zombies but are now useless since they don't distract the horde anymore), Riley's group set off for Canada on Dead Reckoning.|$|E

500|$|While Korn was <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> {{record their}} debut album, they asked {{producer}} Ross Robinson to produce their album. After accepting the offer, Robinson suggested they record at Indigo Ranch, Malibu, California. The band would record {{the majority of}} the album there, while additional recording took place at Bakersfield's Fat Tracks. Korn recorded most of the album with all members playing simultaneously, as opposed to recording instruments separately. The [...] "distinctive" [...] sound and quality of music was given off by their instruments, rather than the production. The bagpipes on [...] "Shoots and Ladders" [...] are often thought to have been recorded on a mountain-top. However, they were actually recorded with a microphone set up at {{the back door of the}} studio while Jonathan Davis walked past outside playing. As he walked further from the microphone, this led to the sound naturally fading quieter. Korn finished recording their self-titled album by the end of June 1994.|$|E
500|$|By the mid-1980s, the orchestra's ambitions {{had grown}} beyond {{the point where}} it could be {{sustained}} by the small town of Evergreen. The increasingly peripatetic performances at Evergreen led to the Denver Post calling them [...] "the guerilla orchestra" [...] because they never knew where they would be playing next. According to Richard Zellner who served as the orchestra's Executive Director from 1982 until 2000, [...] "we were a festival <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> happen." [...] In 1986, the orchestra changed its name to the National Repertory Orchestra, drew up new articles of incorporation, and accepted an offer by Keystone Resort, in Keystone, Colorado to take up residency there. The orchestra provided an entertainment draw for the resort and the resort provided room and board for the musicians, a performing tent, and marketing services, all of which allowed the orchestra to halve its expenses. In 1988, the NRO was the only American orchestra invited to perform at the Seoul Olympics and then extended its tour to Taiwan and Japan.|$|E

2500|$|On 11 February 1858, Bernadette, then aged 14, was out {{gathering}} firewood {{with her}} sister Marie and a friend near the grotto of Massabielle (Tuta de Massavielha) when she experienced her first vision. While the other girls crossed the little stream {{in front of the}} grotto and walked on, Bernadette stayed behind, <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> cross where she wouldn't get her stockings wet. She finally sat down to take her shoes off in order to cross the water and was lowering her stocking when she heard the sound of rushing wind, but nothing moved. A wild rose in a natural niche in the grotto, however, did move. From the niche, or rather the dark alcove behind it, [...] "came a dazzling light, and a white figure". [...] This was the first of 18 visions of what she referred to as aquero (pronounced [...] ), Gascon Occitan for [...] "that". In later testimony, she called it [...] "a small young lady" [...] (uo petito damizelo). Her sister and her friend stated that they had seen nothing.|$|E
2500|$|American author Ralph Ellison wrote {{a tribute}} to the book in the prologue of his 1952 novel Invisible Man. According to Ellison biographer Arnold Rampersad, the {{character}} of the narrator [...] "resembles no one else in previous fiction so much as he resembles Ishmael of Moby-Dick". Ellison acknowledges his debt in the prologue to the novel, where the narrator remembers a moment of truth under the influence of marijuana, and evocates a church service: [...] "Brothers and sisters, my text this morning is the 'Blackness of Blackness.' And the congregation answers: 'That blackness is most black, brother, most black...'" [...] In this scene Ellison [...] "reprises a moment in the second chapter of Moby-Dick", where Ishmael wanders around New Bedford <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> spend the night, and momentarily joins a congregation: [...] "It was a negro church; and the preacher's text was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping and wailing and teeth-gnashing there." [...] According to Rampersad, it was Melville who [...] "empowered Ellison to insist on a place in the American literary tradition" [...] by his example of [...] "representing the complexity of race and racism so acutely and generously in his text".|$|E

2500|$|The North Vietnamese Air Force began {{receiving}} the MiG-19 {{at the end}} of Operation Rolling Thunder, which ended in 1968. Despite their limited numbers, MiG-19s were involved in extensive combat during Operations Linebacker 1 and Linebacker 2 (a.k.a. the Christmas Bombing). The NVAF claimed only seven victories over U.S. aircraft, using the MiG-19, all of which were F-4 Phantom IIs. The MiG-19 was tested by U.S. pilots in the United States in 1969 after receiving a Chinese J-6 (F-6 exported model) from Pakistan. [...] In addition to finding the aircraft to have a good canopy allowing good visibility for the pilot, along with 3 hard hitting 30mm cannons, U.S. pilots found the MiG-19 (J6/F6) to be an excellent fighter, [...] "like the MiG-17, it could easily out-turn the Phantom...and could out-accelerate the F-4 out to Mach 1.2, but was slower than the MiG-21.". [...] However, the MiG-19's strongest fault was its extremely short range, as one U.S. test pilot remarked, [...] "after going in full after-burner at low altitude for 5 minutes, the MiG driver will be <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> land!" [...] This, combined with the aircraft's twin engines, which were difficult to maintain, made the MiG-19 unpopular with North Vietnamese pilots.|$|E
2500|$|The {{show was}} first penned by famed Broadway writer Peter Stone {{who set the}} series in New York. Stone envisioned the Jack Tripper {{character}} as a successful, yet underpaid, chef in a fancy French restaurant while the characters who were to become Janet and Chrissy were to be a secretary for a CEO, and a high style fashion model respectively. Silverman felt that the treatment would not play to middle America and thus passed on the script. Silverman then enlisted the services of famed television writer Larry Gelbart, {{best known for his}} Emmy-award-winning work on CBS' M*A*S*H. Gelbart initially {{wanted nothing to do with}} the show, feeling that its relatively simple premise made it substandard in comparison to M*A*S*H. Nonetheless as a favor to Silverman, Gelbart developed a pilot episode with his son in law who named the series Three's Company. Gelbart's adaptation closely followed the British series. He envisioned Ritter as [...] "David Bell", an aspiring film maker <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> live who just happened to be a great cook. Ritter's better halves were portrayed by Valerie Curtin who played [...] "Jenny" [...] an employee of the DMV, and Susanne Zenor as an aspiring actress named [...] "Samantha". Gelbart reset the Ropers' apartment building, which he called the Hacienda Palms, from New York to North Hollywood, California. This plot of this pilot looked much like that of the first episode of the actual show. Liked by Silverman, a pilot was ordered by ABC which taped in early 1976. This format of the show just barely made it on to the fall 1976 ABC lineup but was ousted by what ABC felt were more promising series. Of all the new sitcoms that premiered on ABC for the 1976–77 television season, only Three's Company and the summer premiere of What's Happening!! went on to a second season. While ABC was in negotiations to re-shoot the pilot, CBS became interested in the show, and made a firm commitment to TTC productions (producers Don Taffner and Ted Bergmann's New York based company) to air the show as a mid season replacement in February 1977 with the Gelbart cast. However, at the last minute ABC decided that they wanted the show and made a firm commitment to air the show at midseason with a new cast.|$|E
