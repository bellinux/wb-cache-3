From their {{position}} on the reef they had hitherto seen the island through the softening atmosphere of distance, like a rounded mass of verdure; {{but in this case}} distance had not [...] "lent enchantment to the view," [...] for, now that they beheld it spread in all its luxuriance at their feet, like a verdant gem resting on the breast of ocean, it appeared infinitely more beautiful. Not only was the mind charmed by the varied details of grove and bay, thicket and grotto, but the eye was attracted irresistibly to the magnificent trees and shrubs which stood prominent in their individuality--such as the light and elegant aito-tree; the stately apape, with its branchless trunk and <b>light</b> <b>crown</b> of pale green leaves, resembling those of the English ash; the splendid tamanu, an evergreen, with its laurel-shaped leaves; the imposing hutu-tree, with foliage resembling the magnolia and its large white flowers, the petals of which are edged with bright pink;--these and many others, with the feathery palm and several kinds of mimosa lining the seashore, presented a display of form and colour such as the brothers had not up to that time even dreamed of.|$|E

50|$|The jungle babbler's {{habitat is}} forest and cultivation. This species, like most babblers, is non-migratory, and has short rounded wings and a weak flight.

The jungle babbler has harsh nasal calls while the white-headed babbler has high pitched calls. Another babbler that is similarly found in urban areas is the large grey babbler, however that species has a distinctive long tail with white outer tail feathers.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{subspecies}} are noted within the widely distributed range of this species. Stuart Baker {{in the second}} edition of The Fauna of British India considered Lanius schach, Lanius tephronotus and Lanius tricolor as three species. He considered nigriceps as synonymous with tricolor and included erythronotus as a race of schach. Other treatments were proposed by Hugh Whistler and N B Kinnear where tephronotus was considered a subspecies of schach and nigriceps and nasutus grouped together. Another treatment considered tricolor as a subspecies of L. tephronotus. It was subsequently however noted that tephronotus and schach co-occurred in the Kumaon region and so the two were confirmed as distinct species. Molecular distances also indicate that they are distant enough. The erythronotus group have a grey head which continues into the back with a gradual suffusion of rufous. The westernmost population from Transcaspia named by Sergei Buturlin as jaxartensis and said to be larger, is not considered valid. A very light grey form from western dry region of India named by Walter Koelz as kathiawarensis is also considered merely as a variant. In southern India and Sri Lanka, subspecies caniceps, is marked by the rufous restricted to the rump, <b>light</b> <b>crown</b> and the pure grey on the back. Biswamoy Biswas supported the view that nigriceps (having upper mantle grey and lower mantle rufous) was a hybrid of tricolor and erythronotus.|$|E
40|$|Crown Model on Several Family of   9 years old  of Teak (Tectona grandis L. f) Progeny Trial Crown {{plays an}} {{important}} role in regulating the rate of tree growth through the photosynthesis process. Furthermore it can be used to measure stand density and to determine the availability of growing space. Because of the difficulty  and time consuming in direct crown measurement, the development of crown model is needed. The objectives of this study were to develop crown models of teak (Tectona grandis) of 9 years old from selected open pollinated families and to identifi) the variations of crown models among them. The study was conducted in an open pollinated progeny test located at the compartment 49 a, RPH Sidowayah, BKPH Kedunggalar, KPH Ngawi. The experimental unit was family. Five families with the best average of stem diameter at breast height were selected as samples. Crown models were developed and variations of crown model were tested with analysis of variance. The crown model of teak can be divided into two sections. The upper crown representing the <b>light</b> <b>crown</b> section followed parabolic model while the under crown representing the shaded crown section followed linear model. No differences in crown model were found among families. The proposed models are: <b>light</b> <b>crown</b> section, paraboloid : Rl = 1. 91 * hl 0. 33 shaded crown section, linear [...] Rs = - 0. 75 + 0. 57 hs where Rl is <b>light</b> <b>crown</b> radius (m), hl is the height of <b>light</b> <b>crown</b> section (m), Rs is shaded crown radius (m) and hs is the height of shaded crown section (m...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MScFor) (Forest and Wood Science) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2003. Planting of upperstorey {{trees along}} {{boundaries}} {{has been introduced}} in KabaleUganda with good reception from local farmers. Trees have been planted along agricultural fields, but both Alnus acuminata and Grew/lea robusta out-compete food crops. Managing competition between trees and crops for water, light, and nutrients {{to the benefit of}} farmers is a determinant of successful agroforestry. The scarcity and fragmentation of farmland coupled with the hilly nature of Kabale, highlights the need to address the question of tree-crop competition for resources if the technology of on-farm tree planting is to be widely disseminated and adopted in its different guises. Five-year old trees of A acuminata and G. robusta were subjected to treatments of pollarding, or a combination of pollarding and one side root pruning and compared with unpruned controls. The objectives were to assess their potential in reducing competition with food crops and providing firewood to farmers as well as their effects on tree growth. Pollarding has many benefits to farmers because it provides firewood and stakes for climbing beans, it reduces competition for resources between trees and crops and enables continued tree planting on-farm. Continued on-farm tree planting alleviates problems associated with limited land and contributes to environmental resilience. To ensure this, effect of pollarding and root pruning of upperstorey boundary trees of A acuminata and G. robusta was tested on 12 farmers' fields in Kabale. Food crops (beans and maize) grown in the sequence beans-maize-beans, grew very well at less than 50 em from trees that had been pollarded and root pruned one side. In general, pooled data from 12 sites over 5 m away from trees indicated that a combination of pollarding and root pruning increased bean yield by 240 % and maize by 154 %, while pollarding alone increased bean yield by 181 % and maize yield was increased by 123 % in comparison to non-pruned trees. However, pollarding and root pruning treatments reduced tree growth rates. Notable was more competition with crops by A. acuminata than by G. robusta. This was attributed to differences in root architecture, diameter at breast height (dbh) sizes, crown spread and crown density between the two species. Five-year-old A. acuminata had bigger dbh (12. 40 cm), wider crown spread (6 m) and a dense crown, while G. robusta had dbh 10. 82 em, 3 m crown spread and a <b>light</b> <b>crown.</b> A. acuminata also had more branches per tree (34) compared to G. robusta with only 25. These factors influence water uptake, light penetration through the canopy and transpiration rates, and thus affect tree-food crop competition. It is concluded that pollarding and root pruning have a great potential to reduce tree-crop competition, thereby paving the way for continued on-farm tree planting. The effect of pollarding on timber quality, moisture seepage into timber through the cut surface, if any, and the extent of its damage are areas for further research. The rate of root recovery is also to be followed closely to determine an appropriate frequency for cutting back of roots to recommend to farmers how often they need to prune their trees. It is also suggested that a thorough study be conducted on the amount of water uptake from the soil by each of the species Alnus acuminata and Grevillea robusta. This will help further explain the differences in competition between the two species...|$|E
