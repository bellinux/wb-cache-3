25|$|Clonal {{derivation}} {{exists in}} nature in some animal species and {{is referred to}} as parthenogenesis (reproduction of an organism by itself without a mate). This is an asexual form of reproduction that is only found in females of some insects, crustaceans, nematodes, fish (for example the hammerhead shark), the Komodo dragon and lizards. The growth and development occurs without fertilization by a male. In plants, parthenogenesis means the development of an embryo from an unfertilized egg cell, and is a component process of apomixis. In species that use the XY sex-determination system, the offspring will always be female. An example is the <b>little</b> <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> (Wasmannia auropunctata), which is native to Central and South America but has spread throughout many tropical environments.|$|E

50|$|The <b>little</b> <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> {{has been}} unintentionally transported from its native range to Africa, North America, Puerto Rico, Israel, Cuba, and {{multiple}} Pacific Island groups. Invading ants cannot survive in global regions that have cold environments.

Human disturbed landscapes - such as the practice of monocultures, and the deforestation of land - have caused {{an explosion in the}} <b>little</b> <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> population in regions of Brazil and Colombia. These regions have a prevalence of cocoa farms and sugarcane monocultures. In Colombia, research shows that high abundance <b>little</b> <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> populations reduce other ant diversity in heavily deforested regions.|$|E

We investigated the impacts of <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> on the upland arthropod community on 20 - 40 ha study sites in southern Mississippi. Study sites were sampled from 1997 – 2000 before, during, and after <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> bait treatments to reduce <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> populations. <b>Fire</b> <b>ant</b> abundance was assessed with bait transects on all sites, and <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> population indices were estimated on a subset of study sites.

40|$|Background: Introduced organisms {{can alter}} {{ecosystems}} by disrupting natural ecological relationships. For example, red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> (Solenopsis invicta) have disrupted native arthropod communities {{throughout much of}} their introduced range. By competing {{for many of the}} same food resources as insectivorous vertebrates, <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> also have the potential to disrupt vertebrate communities. Methodology/Principal Findings: To explore the effects of <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> on a native insectivorous vertebrate, we compared the reproductive success and strategies of eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis) inhabiting territories with different abundances of <b>fire</b> <b>ants.</b> We also created experimental dyads of adjacent territories comprised of one territory with artificially reduced <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> abundance (treated) and one territory that was unmanipulated (control). We found that more bluebird young fledged from treated territories than from adjacent control territories. <b>Fire</b> <b>ant</b> abundance also explained significant variation in two measures of reproductive success across the study population: number of fledglings and hatching success of second clutches. Furthermore, the likelihood of bluebird parents re-nesting in the same territory was negatively influenced by the abundance of foraging <b>fire</b> <b>ants,</b> and parents nesting in territories with experimentally reduced abundances of <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> produced male-biased broods relative to pairs in adjacent control territories.

40|$|Red {{imported}} <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> (Solenopsis invicta) invaded peninsular Florida {{more than}} 30 years ago. Highlands and Polk counties, Florida, were probably first invaded {{in the late}} 1960 s. Since then, <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> have continued both to spread and to increase in abundance. Experimental evidence has shown that red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> may have a detrimental impact on native species, both invertebrate and vertebrate, and that these impacts may be both direct and indirect. This segment of research was designed to determine if <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> {{have a negative impact}} on Florida grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarumfloridanus) populations at Avon Park Air Force Bombing Range, Florida. The sampling reported herein was conducted during June and October, 1997, and all analyses are restricted to data collected during those periods. As assessed by baits, <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> were dominant on about half the sites, and absent from others. In particular, OQ Range sites tended to have fewer <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> present, while Delta Trail sites were more heavily infested, although there were exceptions. June <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> abundance was strongly negatively correlated with both native ant abundance (r = - 0. 743, P = 0. 006) and native ant species richness (r = - 0. 730, P = 0. 007). October <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> abundance was strongly negatively correlated with both native ant abundance (r = - 0. 690, P = 0. 013) and native ant species richness (r = - 0. 736, P = 0. 006). The patterns of <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> abundance as assessed by pitfalls were very similar to those determined from bait sampling.

To {{determine the effects of}} <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> on soil fungi, we sampled soil from <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> mounds and the surrounding nonmound soil. In addition, we sampled soil from the nests of the native ant Aphaenogaster texana carolinensis Wheeler. We found that both <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> mounds and native ant nests had greater fungal abundance but lower species richness and diversity than nonmound soil. <b>Fire</b> <b>ant</b> mounds contained 19 times more colony forming units (cfu g- 1) than adjacent soil; however, nonmound soil had more than twice the number of fungal species. Two species (Papulaspora byssina Hotson and Penicillium janthinellum Biourge) made up the majority (54. 5 and 19. 2 % relative colony frequencies, respectively) of fungi in <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> mounds. These high proportions of limited numbers of fungal species in <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> mounds indicate that only some species are tolerant to and thrive in mound conditions. Alternatively, <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> might not selectively remove these fungi from their mounds. Given the high densities of <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> and their frequent mound movements, changes in soil fungal communities might have lasting impacts on soil conditions.

In these places, they pose a medical threat to people and animals. <b>Fire</b> <b>ants</b> may attack with little warning. After firmly grasping the skin with its jaws, the <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> arches its back as it inserts its rear-end stinger into the flesh, injecting venom from the poison sac.
