40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} system {{configuration}} of the private mobile network using autonomous packet routing algorithm that provides an intelligent wireless network structure. Our packet routing algorithm senses the preferable paths for packet transmission, which are dynamically generated among terminals according to traffic conditions. In this paper, we discuss the entire system configuration where such packet routing algorithm is suitably supported by the lower layer protocols, such as control sequence configuration, transmission frame format, and transmission schemes. We assume VHF band transmission that is widely used for the private systems and assume slotted-ALOHA based packet transmission protocol. One {{of the most significant}} goals of our system is to achieve IP based service transmission on the limited bandwidth. Essential <b>logical</b> <b>channel</b> <b>signal</b> introduction and effective slot format are investigated in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Part 6 : Embedded SystemsInternational audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{a proposal for}} structuring <b>logical</b> <b>signals</b> for discrete events behavioral modeling. Graphical formalisms {{will be used to}} illustrate applicability of the proposed techniques. Input <b>logical</b> <b>signals</b> are generated based on the analysis of physical signals coming from the environment and other input <b>logical</b> <b>signals.</b> Their analysis is introduced in the flow of the input signal analysis, defined as pre-processing when using a modeling formalism. Their analysis is done in the first step of pre-processing, allowing to put these signals at the same level of the physical ones, enabling its use {{in the rest of the}} signals’ analysis, and also allowing the generation of events and conditions associated with these <b>signals.</b> Likewise, <b>logical</b> <b>signals</b> are also defined in the flow of post-processing, allowing the definition of output <b>logical</b> <b>signals</b> through analysis and composition of the output signals generated by the model execution. The output <b>logical</b> <b>signals</b> are analyzed in the last step of post-processing in order to allow the use of the signals affected by the events in its analysis. The usage of these signals allows improvements in terms of expressiveness and compactness of the resulted models, both directly due to its use as well as by the increase of the possibilities of analysis provided to the following parts of the development flow...|$|R
40|$|The {{developed}} {{system of}} control of brushless DC (BLDC) motors is realized on the complex pro-grammable logic device (CPLD). Using CPLD reduces the power consumption required for calculation the control vector and also {{the cost of the}} system. As opposed to the modern systems of control of BLDC motors, the given system uses only two Hall’s sensors. The control circuit is based on the operators of the <b>logical</b> <b>signal</b> convolution that significantly reduces power consumption during the formation of base vectors. The principle of symmetric pulse-width modulation (PWM) control on the operators of <b>logical</b> <b>signal</b> convolution is considered. The use of operators of <b>logical</b> <b>signal</b> convolution is a new scientific direction that allows effective solution of the problems of control of BLDC motors and simplification of algorithms of record of time-converting procedures...|$|R

40|$|This {{contribution}} addresses {{requirements for}} ATM <b>signaling</b> <b>channel</b> authentication. <b>Signaling</b> <b>channel</b> authentication is an ATM security service that binds an ATM signaling message to its source. By creating this binding, the message recipient, {{and even a}} third party, can confidently verify that the message originated from its claimed source. This provides a useful mechanism to mitigate a number of threats. For example, a denial of service attack which attempts to tear-down an active connection by surreptitiously injecting RELEASE or DROP PARTY messages could be easily thwarted when authenticity assurances are {{in place for the}} <b>signaling</b> <b>channel.</b> <b>Signaling</b> <b>channel</b> authentication could also be used to provide the required auditing information for accurate billing which is impervious to repudiation. Finally, depending on the <b>signaling</b> <b>channel</b> authentication mechanism, end-to-end integrity of the message (or at least part of it) can be provided. None of these capabilities exist in the current specifications...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis chapter {{focuses on}} {{modeling}} {{the response of}} <b>logical</b> <b>signaling</b> networks by means of automated reasoning using answer set programming (ASP).

Furthermore, it shows that many networks can be compatible with a given set of experimental observations. The chapter discusses how ASP can be used to exhaustively enumerate all these logical networks. Next, in order to gain control over the system, it look for intervention strategies that force a set of target species into a desired steady state. Altogether, this constitutes a pipeline for reasoning on <b>logical</b> <b>signaling</b> networks providing robust insights to system biologists.

40|$|For 3 -D {{ultrasound}} imaging, the row-column addressing (RCA) with 2 N connections for an N × N 2 -D array {{makes the}} fabrication and interconnection simpler than the fully addressing with N 2 connections. However, RCA degrades the image quality because of defocusing in <b>signal</b> <b>channel</b> {{direction in the}} transmit event. To solve this problem, a split row-column addressing scheme (SRCA) is proposed in this paper. Rather than connecting all the elements in the <b>signal</b> <b>channel</b> direction together, this scheme divides the elements in the <b>signal</b> <b>channel</b> direction into several disconnected blocks, thus enables focusing beam access in both <b>signal</b> <b>channel</b> and switch channel directions. Selecting an appropriate split scheme is the key for SRCA to maintaining a reasonable tradeoff between the image quality {{and the number of}} connections. Various split schemes for a 32 × 32 array are fully investigated with point spread function (PSF) analysis and imaging simulation. The result shows the split scheme with five blocks (4, 6, 12, 6, and 4 elements of each block) can provide similar image quality to fully addressing. The splitting schemes for different array sizes from 16 × 16 to 96 × 96 are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|The first {{generation}} of the Canadian Mobile Satellite (MSAT) system, planned to be operational in the early 1990 s, will provide voice and data services to land, aeronautical, and maritime mobile terminals within the Canadian land mass and its territorial waters. The system will be managed by a centralized Demand Assignment Multiple Access (DAMA) control system. Users will request a communication channel by communicating with the DAMA Control System (DCS) via the appropriate <b>signalling</b> <b>channels.</b> Several access techniques for both L-band and SHF <b>signalling</b> <b>channels</b> have been investigated. For the L-band, Slotted Aloha (SA) and Reservation Aloha (RA), combined with a token scheme, are discussed here. The results of Telesat studies to date indicate that SA, when combined with token scheme, provides the most efficient access and resource management tool in a mobile propagation environment. For SHF <b>signalling</b> <b>channels,</b> slim time division multiple access (TDMA) and SA have been considered as the most suitable candidate schemes. In view of the operational environment of the SHF links, provision of a very short channel access delay and a relatively high packet success rate are highly desirable.
