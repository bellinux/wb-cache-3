25|$|The Apprentice: Why I Fired Them is a {{documentary}} special which first aired alongside the third series, {{and focuses on}} Lord Alan Sugar <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>over</b> the current series, and discussing the merits and shortcomings of the candidates he fired up to the time the programme is aired. Joined by his advisers, he explains in more detail about why he fired each candidate at each stage of the competition, whilst reviewing the performances of the finalists for that series. For the seventh series, the programme was not broadcast; instead it was replaced with a similar documentary special entitled How To Get Hired, which was presented by Dara Ã“ Briain.|$|E
25|$|The Sierra Nevada {{still faces}} {{a number of}} issues that {{threaten}} its conservation. Logging occurs on both private and public lands, including controversial clearcut methods and thinning logging on private and public lands. Grazing occurs on private lands as well as on National Forest lands, which include Wilderness areas. Overgrazing can alter hydrologic processes and vegetation composition, remove vegetation that serves as food and habitat for native species, and contribute to sedimentation and pollution in waterways. A recent increase in large wildfires like the Rim Fire in Yosemite National Park and the Stanislaus National Forest and the King Fire on the Eldorado National Forest, has prompted concerns. A 2015 study indicated that the increase in fire risk in California may be attributable to human-induced climate change. A study <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>over</b> 8,000 years found that warmer climate periods experienced severe droughts and more stand-replacing fires and concluded that as climate is such a powerful influence on wildfires, trying to recreate presettlement forest structure is likely impossible in a warmer future.|$|E

[...] <b>Looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>over</b> Trenchard's time as Chief of the Air Staff, while he had successfully preserved the RAF, his emphasis on the Air Force providing defence at a comparatively low cost had led to a stagnation and even deterioration {{in the quality of}} the Service's fighting equipment.|$|E

500|$|The USAF {{summary report}} of the {{accident}} investigation stated that, given {{the position of the}} F-104 relative to the XB-70, Walker, the F-104 pilot {{would not have been able}} to see the XB-70's wing, except by uncomfortably <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>over</b> his left shoulder. The report said that it was likely that Walker maintained his position by looking at the fuselage of the XB-70, forward of his position. The F-104 was estimated to be [...] to the side of, and [...] below, the fuselage of the XB-70. The report concluded that from that position, without appropriate sight cues, Walker was unable to properly perceive his motion relative to the Valkyrie, leading to his aircraft drifting into contact with the XB-70's wing. The accident investigation also pointed to the wake vortex off the XB-70's right wingtip as the reason for the F-104's sudden roll over and into the bomber.|$|E
500|$|<b>Looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>over</b> 40 {{years of}} {{scholarship}} since Watson's theory, the historian and linguist Paolo Squatriti noted in 2014 that the thesis had been widely used and cited by historians and archaeologists working in different fields. It [...] "proved {{to be applicable}} in scholarly debates about technological diffusion in pre-industrial societies, the 'decline' of Islamic civilization, the relations between elite and peasant cultural systems, Europe's historical Sonderweg in the second millennium CE, the origins of globalization, [...] the nature of Mediterraneity." [...] Squatriti noted that Watson had originally trained in economics, and applied this interest to his historical studies. Squatriti described Watson's paper as concise and elegant, and popular for its usefulness in supporting the theses of many different historians. He observed that Watson's thesis did not depend on claims of new introductions of plants into any region, but of their [...] "diffusion and normalization", i.e. of their becoming widely and generally used, {{even if they were}} known from Roman times. Calling Watson's [...] "philological" [...] approach [...] "old fashioned", and given that Watson had worked [...] "virtually without archaeology", Squatrini expressed surprise that recent research in archaeobotany has failed to [...] "decisively undermine" [...] Watson's thesis.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Katherine and Jill were {{believed}} to be mother and daughter after Katherine's friend, Charlotte Ramsey, provided factual proof. Of the storyline, Walton stated: [...] "She's [...] going down a bad road. In <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>over</b> the past 16 years, she's gone down a lot of bad roads, for a lot of different reasons. She'll survive this one and, hopefully, maybe this time she'll learn something from it." [...] She also described Jill as being in a [...] "soul-searching period" [...] during the storyline, saying: [...] "Now she's numbing herself with the alcohol because all those feelings of love are coming up for her mother, and she doesn't {{know how to deal with}} them." [...] Walton said she felt Jill had been [...] "shaken to the very foundation" [...] upon the revelation that Katherine is her mother, stating: [...] "A big part of who she has been all these years has to do with her anger towards Katherine. She always shoved any feeling of love down. Now, she's questioning everything about herself. That's why she is in such pain and why she is drinking. That hate thing is baseless now." [...] While admitting to having been surprised with the maternity revelation, Walton thought it was [...] "fabulous and rich, and it's opened up a whole new facet to the story". However, in 2009, the characters' history was rewritten by Maria Arena Bell; Charlotte had made up this information for revenge against Katherine, and they were not mother and daughter.|$|E

2500|$|Tyler {{released}} {{one more}} album with Columbia Records in 1988. It was released {{under the name}} Hide Your Heart in Europe, and Notes From America in the United States. Prolific songwriters for the album included Michael Bolton, Albert Hammond and Desmond Child, who also produced the album. The album enjoyed some success in continental Europe, but only peaked at No. 78 in the UK and failed to chart in the United States. The singles from Hide Your Heart were minor hits for Tyler, but went on to be major hits for other artists, including Kiss (with [...] "Hide Your Heart"), Robin Beck, Cher and Freda Payne (with [...] "Save Up All Your Tears") and Tina Turner with [...] "The Best". When <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>over</b> this era, Desmond Child said:Bonnie Tyler {{is one of the}} greatest singers on Earth. Why? Because she comes to the studio prepared. I've never even seen her use a lyric sheet to sing. She comes with the song memorized, so when she stands there and sings, she closes her eyes. She's in a sacred space and you feel that. You can say a lot of things about Bonnie Tyler, but you cannot say she does not feel her music.|$|E
