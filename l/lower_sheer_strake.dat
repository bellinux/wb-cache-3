50|$|McDougall's {{design has}} been likened to a cigar with bent up ends. The <b>sheer</b> <b>strake</b> (vertical hull sides) of a {{conventional}} vessel met the horizontal weather deck at a right-angle gunwale; a whaleback hull had a continuous curve above the waterline from the vertical to the horizontal to where the sides met inboard. The bow and stern were nearly identical in shape, both conoid, truncated to end in a relatively small disc. The superstructure atop the hull was in or on round or oval “turrets”, so-named because of their resemblance to gunhouses on contemporary warships. Cabins, decks, and other superstructure were often mounted atop these turrets.|$|R
5000|$|The {{uppermost}} continuous strake {{along the}} topsides {{is called the}} <b>sheer</b> <b>strake.</b> In old vessels, a rubbing strake was built in just below a carvel <b>sheer</b> <b>strake.</b> It was much less broad but thicker than other strakes so that it projected and took any rubbing against piers or other boats when the boat was in use. In clinker boats, the rubbing strake {{was applied to the}} outside of the <b>sheer</b> <b>strake.</b> The strakes adjacent to the garboard are referred to accordingly as the first broad and second broad. Each strake thereafter has its own special name such as bottom strakes, lowers, bilge strakes, topside strakes, and uppers. Many current pleasure craft reflect this history by providing the boat with a mechanically attached (and therefore replaceable) rub rail at the location formerly occupied by a rubbing strake, often doubling to cover the joint between a GRP hull and its innerliner.A stealer is a short strake employed to reduce the width of plank required where the girth of the hull increases or is necessary due to a tuck in the shape. It is commonly employed in carvel and iron/steel shipbuilding, but there are very few, possibly only one type of, clinker craft that use them."A stealer is a short strake employed to reduce the width of plank required where the girth of the hull increases or is necessary due to a tuck in the shape." [...] This statement represents a mis-understanding of what a [...] "stealer" [...] is tasked with accomplishing as a hull is lined-off. After determining the widths of strakes amidships (there are three categories), a quantity can be determined for all these strakes. This quantity is then divided into the height of the stem to determine the width of the average hood-end. This width must be twice the hood-ends thickness or it {{will not be able to}} carry its fasteners. If the hood-ends are not wide enough, the quantity is dropped by one until the resulting revised width is strong enough to carry its fasteners. Stealer is actually a misspelling of the word steeler, the plankers borrowed this word from their peers in the foundry, where forgers would strengthen a piece of metal by steeling a different metal to the original piece. This was analogous to strengthening the hood-end by making it wider, providing more wood mass around each hood-end. Wider meant fewer hood-ends. A device was needed to compensate for the drop in strakes that actually reached the stem. The device was a strake that was stooped short of the stem by burying its forward butt end into a notch chiseled into a through plank. This strake was called a steeler by the plankers and a drop plank by the liners who originated it by counting strakes during the lining off process.|$|R

50|$|In {{building}} a simple pulling boat, the keel, hog, stem, apron, deadwoods, sternpost and perhaps transom are assembled and securely set up. In normal practice, {{this will be}} the same way up as they will be in use. From the hog, the garboard, bottom, bilge, topside and <b>sheer</b> <b>strakes</b> are planked up, held together along their lands by copper rivets. At the stem and, in a double-ended boat, the sternpost, geralds are formed. That is, in each case, the land of the lower strake is tapered to a feather edge {{at the end of the}} strake where it meets the stem or stern-post. This allows the end of the strake to be screwed to the apron with the outside of the planking mutually flush at that point and flush with the stem. This means that the boat's passage through the water will not tend to lift the ends of the planking away from the stem. Before the next plank is laid up, the face of the land on the lower strake is bevelled to suit the angle at which the next strake will lie in relation with it. This varies all along the land. Gripes are used to hold the new strake in position on the preceding one before the fastening is done.|$|R

40|$|Desalination {{has been}} {{increasingly}} adopted {{over the last}} decades as an option, and sometimes as a necessity to overcome water shortages in many areas around the world. Today, several thermal and physical separation technologies are well established in large scale production for domestic and industrial purposes.  Membrane distillation is a novel thermally-driven process that can be adapted effectively for water desalination or water treatment in industrial applications, due to its potential lower energy consumption and simplicity. The general objective of this thesis is {{to contribute to the}} technical understanding of membrane distillation as a new technology in water treatment for both industrial and drinking water purposes, {{as a starting point for}} further improvement. The thesis includes experimental and numerical investigations that highlight some aspects of the technology application and fundamental aspects. In the field of industrial application, an experimental and numerical assessment has been carried out on an Air Gap Membrane Distillation (AGMD) prototype to assess the utilization of the technology in thermal cogeneration plants; in particular, demineralization of water boiler feed water and treating flue gas condensate. The main assessment parameters were water quality and energy consumption. The results from full-scale simulations of a system of 10 m 3 /hr production capacity,  connected to the district heating network were as follows: 5 to 12 kWh/m 3 specific thermal energy consumption, and   0, 6 to 1, 5 kWh/m 3 specific electricity consumption, depending upon the heat source (district heat supply line or low-grade steam). For desalination applications, experimental and simulation work was conducted on an AGMD semi-commercial system as part of the EU MEDESOL project. The aim was to evaluate AGMD performance with saline water of 35 g/l NaCl in order to establish an operation data base for simulation of a three-stage AGMD desalination system. Specific thermal energy consumption was calculated as 950 kWht/m 3 for a layout without heat recovery, and 850 kWht/m 3 for a layout with one stage heat recovery.   The lack of internal heat recovery in the current MD module means that most of the heat supplied to MD system was not utilized efficiently, so the thermal energy consumption is high. This would mean that a large solar field is needed. In order to analyze the flow conditions in feed flow and cooling channels, CFD was used as tool to analyze a spacer-obstructed flow channel for different types of spacer geometrical characteristics: flow of attack angle, spacer to channel thickness ratio, and void ratio. Velocity profiles, shear stress, and pressure drop were the main assessment criteria. Results show the flow of attack angle has a very minimum effect on the performance of spacers. The effect of spacer to channel thickness ratio was significant in all assessment parameters. Higher void ratios were found advantageous in promoting flow mixing, but resulted in <b>lower</b> <b>sheer</b> stress and hence reduced heat transfer. Physical modifications were implemented on a semi-commercial AGMD prototype to assess experimentally any improvement in its performance. These modifications were mainly focused on reducing the conductive heat transfer losses by modifying the physical support in the air gap that separates the membrane from the condensation surface. In addition, several feed channel spacers were tested and assessed based on their effect in increasing the mass transfer while maintaining or reducing pressure drop. The modifications yielded a two-fold augmentation: slight increase in the distillate mass flow rate (9 - 11 %), and increased thermal efficiency (6 %). The pressure drop in the module was reduced by 50 % through selecting the appropriate spacer that would achieve the above mass flow rate increase. QC 2011102...|$|R
40|$|The {{consequences}} of the extensive changes in age distribution now occurring in developed countries are different according to whether one considers aspects of production or consumption. Too {{little attention has been}} given to the former, especially in relation to the pace of technical change. This paper opens up that subject. Under fixed technology, experience is an asset to the individual and to the economy; under rapid change, experience can be a handicap to both. It is also shown how fewer entrants into the labor force makes for higher starting wages but slower promotion to more responsible work. Of the various consumption and redistribution aspects, social security is the most conspicuous. An earlier paper (Keyfitz, 1981) developed formulas for the implicit reserve of a social security scheme; here we carry these further in relation to social security wealth. The crisis in social security consists in the fact that schemes have been priced <b>lower</b> than <b>sheer</b> arithmetic shows to be their long-term cost. Because the public believed the costs to be lower than it now realizes they are, it bought a larger quantity than it really wanted. Yet it is reluctant to reduce the quantity [...] by raising the retirement age or lowering the replacement ratio [...] because the scheme seems so fragile that any tampering with it could be the opening wedge to total dismantling. We locate social security in the framework of intergenerational transfers, whose problems arise as a direct consequence of birth fluctuations.

The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the writings of eighth graders as they speak for themselves and as they tell themselves and the reader who they are becoming. Adolescence is generally identified as the period of time between 12 and 19 years of age. According to most research, ages 10 to 15 often border on the chaotic. Drinking, drug abuse, sexually transmitted diseases, and teen-age pregnancy, once prevalent only in high schools, now have infiltrated the <b>lower</b> grades. The <b>sheer</b> availability of substances and experiences makes for trouble, both for these children and society as a whole. Yet most research has been devoted to the adolescent "in general," encompassing all the teen years, from 12 to 19, as though this comprised a simple developmental stage. The focus of this study was on the relatively less studies period of early adolescence. What is the nature of a youngster's experience at the onset of adolescence? More importantly, how do youngsters at this age struggle to articulate and consolidate their identities as they locate themselves in a social context? The focus of this study is on the constructive role 12 - to 15 -year-olds play in the establishment of their own personal definitions.
