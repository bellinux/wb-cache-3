5|$|The {{smartphone}} considerably reduces its predecessor's sizes, measuring 4.3 by 2.4 by 6 inches (10.92, 6.09 and 15.24 centimeters, respectively). The Bold 9700 has a 624MHz {{processor and}} a 256MB Flash memory. The device uses a 2.44 inch HVGA (approximately 6.1cm) non-touch LCD display at {{a resolution of}} 480×360 pixels. The resolution of the display was {{compared to that of}} HTC Magic, as it has also HVGA quality. The model changes its predecessor's trackball to an optical trackpad, with simple functionalities such as swiping the thumb to move it and press it to make a selection. This change prevented problems including the accumulation of dust behind the trackball. Similarly to previous BlackBerry models, BlackBerry 9700 has a 35-key QWERTY-type physical keyboard, which is smaller than that of Bold 9000. On the top of the device, there are two buttons that respectively lock or mute it; {{on the right side of}} it, rubberized keys are found, which can either control the audio volume or the music player; further down, there is a camera shutter key. Cosmetic changes including the addition of a <b>leatherette</b> battery cover were carried out in order to appeal both sexes.|$|E

25|$|The building's {{heavy and}} ornate {{exterior}} {{is a direct}} contrast to its spacious, open interior. The main entrance opens onto a hall {{which leads to the}} auditorium at the rear. The approximately 200 original cast-iron seats are arranged on four descending, curving levels, with <b>leatherette</b> upholstery. On either side is a balcony with circular box, supported by wooden columns with brackets and ball drops, and two tall, round-arched stained glass windows. The proscenium has vestiges of the original valances.|$|E
25|$|Milton Bradley {{also created}} a Fine Edition and a Collector's Edition with more questions. The magic slates came {{enclosed}} in a gold-looking folder, plus a dial to keep score instead of the pegboard. The scoring and point values were just like the TV show. The only difference between the Fine Edition and the Collector's Edition is that instead of being packaged in a normal cardboard box, it came in a <b>leatherette</b> case with buttons on the front apron..|$|E
25|$|After the Olympic coin venture, the numismatic line {{expanded}} to include $100 Gold coins. These were premium coins that sold for higher than face value. The common issue price from 1977 to 1979 ranged from $140 to $180. The cases for these coins tended to be brown or black <b>leatherette</b> cases with maroon or blue inserts, and a Certificate of Authenticity. Of all these coins, {{the only one that}} had any significant increase in value on the secondary market was the 2002 Alberta Strikes Oil coin.|$|E
25|$|After {{her success}} with Slave to the Rhythm, Island {{released}} Island Life, Jones' first best-of compilation, which featured songs {{from most of}} her releases with Island (Portfolio, Fame, Warm <b>Leatherette,</b> Nightclubbing, Living My Life and Slave to the Rhythm). American writer and journalist Glenn O'Brien wrote the essay for the inlay booklet. The compilation charted in the UK, New Zealand and the United States. The artwork {{on the cover of}} the compilation was of another Jones/Goude collaboration; it featured Jones' celestial body in a montage of separate images, following Goude's ideas on creating credible illusions with his cut-and-paint technique. The body position is anatomically impossible.|$|E
25|$|In 1948 {{a series}} script {{appeared}} on the front fenders and the white Tenelite steering wheel {{that had been used}} previously was traded in for a black one, in order match the change from a two-tone woodgrain instrument panel to a two-tone gray instrument panel, with silver tone instruments. A new optional custom trim option was offered, consisting of cloth upholstery with leather bolsters with the robe cord cover and lower door panels trimmed in <b>leatherette.</b> Convertibles acquired power windows, seat and top as standard equipment. But the biggest advancement was the introduction of Dynaflow, the first passenger car torque converter transmission. Optional on Roadmaster in its first year, it was so popular that by the following it was standard equipment. Overall sales were just under 80,000 in both 1947 and 1948, over four times greater than in any prewar year.|$|E
500|$|Traditionally, Edinburgh Corporation, LRT and Lothian Buses had a livery of madder (a dark red) {{and white}} or cream, with {{matching}} madder <b>leatherette</b> seating. Some coach-seated Alexander RH bodied Leyland Olympians and Alexander Royale bodied Volvo Olympians were painted with red {{in place of}} the madder. When low floor disabled access vehicles were introduced in the late 1990s, they were given their own distinguishing [...] "harlequin" [...] livery. A tartan pattern was used on seat upholstry at this time, and the insides of the buses were coloured in bright blues and yellows. The last high step bus was removed from service by Lothian in the late 2000s, making the distinction irrelevant.|$|E
500|$|... “Grunge...became an anti-consumerist {{movement}} {{where the}} less you spent on clothes, the more ‘coolness’ you had.” The style did not evolve out of a conscious attempt to create an appealing fashion; music journalist Charles R. Cross said, [...] " [...] Kurt Cobain was just too lazy to shampoo", and Sub Pop's Jonathan Poneman said, [...] "This [...] is cheap, it's durable, and it's kind of timeless. It also runs {{against the grain of}} the whole flashy aesthetic that existed in the 80s." [...] The flannel and [...] "...cracked <b>leatherette</b> coats" [...] in the grunge scene were part [...] "...of the Pacific Northwest's thrift-shop esthetic. [...] Grunge fashion was very much an anti-fashion response and a non-conformist move against the “manufactured image”, often pushing musicians to dress in authentic ways and to not glamorize themselves. At the same time, Sub-Pop utilized the ‘grunge look’ in their marketing of their bands. In an interview with VH1, photographer Charles Peterson commented that members from grunge band Tad “were given blue collar identities that weren’t entirely earned. Bruce (Pavitt) really got him to dress up in flannel and a real chain saw and really play up this image of a mountain man and it worked.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Jones' {{early music}} {{was rooted in}} the disco genre. She opted for a new wave sound in the early 1980s. She {{recorded}} a series of albums (1980's Warm <b>Leatherette</b> through 1982's Living My Life) backed by the Jamaica rhythm section duo Sly and Robbie. Her music during this era {{was described as a}} new wave hybrid of reggae, funk, pop, and rock. According to John Doran of BBC Music, Warm <b>Leatherette</b> and Nightclubbing were [...] "post-punk pop" [...] albums that, [...] "delved into the worlds of disco, reggae and funk much more successfully than most of her 'alternative' contemporaries, while still retaining a blank-eyed alienation that was more reminiscent of David Bowie or Ian Curtis than most of her peers." [...] This hybrid influenced a variety of alternative music artists, including Massive Attack, Todd Terje, Gorillaz, Hot Chip, and LCD Soundsystem.|$|E
2500|$|In 1966, the publisher, George Braziller, {{produced}} a full color, partial facsimile. All 157 of the miniatures were reproduced in color with gold. Three text pages of prayers were reproduced in color. [...] The 160 facsimile pages were accompanied with notes and commentaries by Dr. John Plummer.

2500|$|The uniform changed {{somewhat}} in 1943. [...] The new uniform, which {{was meant to}} be primarily worn off the stations, added a pleat to the greatcoat and the skirt was changed to a six-gore pattern. The pleated tunic pockets were replaced with flat patch pockets below and false pockets above, and the belt became detachable. A blue <b>leatherette</b> shoulder bag was added. The cap was replaced with one with a kepi-style with a deep visor and higher stiffened front.|$|E
2500|$|Very popular {{accessories}} were vinyl roofs, rally wheels, sport steering wheels, bucket {{seats with}} high backs, and tufted <b>leatherette</b> upholstery (many sedans were produced this way). Interiors were usually black. Steering wheels and instrument panels were only black for many years, as were seatbelts. American style interior color coordination was absent. The {{last year of}} the Nova in Argentina is called locally [...] "Opus 78" [...] (because the slogan of the publicity) and it was the most equipped, adding simil-leather bucket seats, air-conditioning, power steering, electric antenna, and a new dashboard with integrated central console.|$|E

Honda added Suzuka Blue to the US domestic market lineup.|$|E
2500|$|In 1977, Jones {{secured a}} record deal with Island Records, {{initially}} becoming {{a star of}} New York City's Studio 54-centered disco scene. In the early 1980s, she moved toward a new wave style that drew on reggae, funk, post-punk and pop music, frequently collaborating with both the graphic designer Jean-Paul Goude and the musical duo Sly & Robbie. Her most popular albums include Warm <b>Leatherette</b> (1980), Nightclubbing (1981), and Slave to the Rhythm (1985). She scored Top 40 entries on the UK Singles Chart with [...] "Pull Up to the Bumper", [...] "I've Seen That Face Before", [...] "Private Life", and [...] "Slave to the Rhythm". In 1982, she released the music video collection A One Man Show, directed by Goude.|$|E
2500|$|Jones' three albums {{under the}} {{production}} of the Compass Point All Stars resulted in Jones' One Man Show, a performance art/pop theatre presentation devised by Goude and Jones in which she also performed tracks from the albums Portfolio ("La Vie en rose"), Warm <b>Leatherette,</b> ("Private Life", [...] "Warm Leatherette"), Nightclubbing ("Walking in the Rain", [...] "Feel Up", [...] "Demolition Man", [...] "Pull Up to the Bumper" [...] and [...] "I've Seen That Face Before (Libertango)") and from Living My Life, [...] "My Jamaican Guy" [...] and the album's title track.

A video version, filmed live in London and New York City and completed with some studio footage, was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Long-Form Music Video the following year.|$|E
2500|$|With anti-disco {{sentiment}} spreading, {{and with}} the aid of the Compass Point All Stars, Jones transitioned into new wave music with the 1980 release of Warm <b>Leatherette.</b> The album included covers of songs by The Normal ("Warm Leatherette"), The Pretenders ("Private Life"), Roxy Music ("Love Is the Drug"), Smokey Robinson ("The Hunter Gets Captured by the Game"), Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers ("Breakdown") and Jacques Higelin ("Pars"). Sly Dunbar revealed that the title track was also the first to be recorded with Jones. Tom Petty wrote the lyrics to [...] "Breakdown", and he also wrote the third verse of Jones' reinterpretation. The album included one song co-written by Jones, [...] "A Rolling Stone". Originally, [...] "Pull Up to the Bumper" [...] was to be included on the album, but its R sound did not fit {{with the rest of the}} material. By 1981, she had begun collaborating with photographer and graphic designer Jean-Paul Goude, with whom she also had a relationship.|$|E
