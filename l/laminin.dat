5|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} testing a specific integrin, alpha-six-beta-one, and the role it plays in the RMS. The study researched the principle that chemoattractive molecules may {{play an important role}} in neuroblast migration in the RMS. The study of this one particular integrin was conducted in mice. By using antibodies to bind to α6β1 integrin subunits, found on the neuroblasts, the researchers observed that the migration was disrupted. Furthermore, they investigated the mechanism through which α6β1 integrin functions and determined it was via the chemoattractant <b>laminin.</b> This was completed by injecting <b>laminin</b> perpendicular to the RMS and observing that doing so drew “neuroblasts away from their normal course of migration”. The researchers concluded with the idea that this research could prove useful for therapeutics purposes in that neuroblasts could potentially be drawn to locations of injury or disease.|$|E
25|$|Adhesion is an {{important}} component of pathogenesis. The yeast form of S. schenckii shows an increased ability to bind to the host extracellular matrix proteins fibronectin and <b>laminin</b> using two separate receptors specific for these proteins.|$|E
25|$|Function: The {{function}} of this protein domain is to bind to the extracellular matrix of the host, most notably fibronectin, collagen, and <b>laminin.</b> The head domain {{is very important}} for attachment to the host cell and for autoagglutination, sticking to itself.|$|E
50|$|<b>Laminins</b> are {{proteins}} {{found in}} the basal laminae of virtually all animals. Rather than forming collagen-like fibers, <b>laminins</b> form networks of web-like structures that resist tensile forces in the basal lamina. They also assist in cell adhesion. <b>Laminins</b> bind other ECM components such as collagens and nidogens.|$|R
50|$|<b>Laminins</b> contain several conserved protein domains.|$|R
50|$|Netrins {{share the}} same {{terminal}} structure with vertebrate <b>laminins</b> but appear minimally related. The basement membrane assembly across species, Vertebrate laminin-1 (α1β1γ1) and laminin-10 (α5β1γ1), like the two Caenorhabditis elegans <b>laminins,</b> are embryonically expressed and are essential for basement membrane assembly. During the basement assembly process <b>laminins</b> anchor to the cell surface through their G domains after polymerizing through their LN domains. Netrins are involved in heterotropic LN domain interactions during this process which suggests that although similar in structure, {{the functions of the}} two families are different.|$|R
25|$|Plasmin is a serine {{protease}} that acts to dissolve fibrin blood clots. Apart from fibrinolysis, plasmin proteolyses proteins in various other systems: It activates collagenases, some mediators of the complement system and weakens {{the wall of}} the Graafian follicle (leading to ovulation). It cleaves fibrin, fibronectin, thrombospondin, <b>laminin,</b> and von Willebrand factor. Plasmin, like trypsin, belongs to the family of {{serine protease}}s.|$|E
25|$|Secreted PEDF binds a {{receptor}} on {{the cell}} surface termed PEDF-R. PEDF-R has phospholipase A2 activity which liberates fatty acids from glycerolipids. PEDF enhances gamma-secretase activity, leading to the cleavage of the VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR-1) transmembrane domain. This action interferes with VEGF signaling thereby inhibiting angiogenesis. <b>Laminin</b> receptor is also a target for PEDF, and the interaction occurs between residues 24-57 of PEDF, a region known to regulate antiangiogenic function.|$|E
25|$|Hyaluronic acid (HA) is {{a widely}} used {{biomaterial}} {{as a result of}} its excellent biocompatibility and its physiologic function diversity. It is abundant in the extracellular matrix (ECM) where it binds large glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and proteoglycans through specific HA-protein interactions. HA also binds cell surface receptors such as CD44, which results in the activation of intracellular signaling cascades that regulate cell adhesion and motility and promote proliferation and differentiation. HA is also known to support angiogenesis because its degradation products stimulate endothelial cell proliferation and migration. Thus, HA plays a pivotal role in maintaining the normal processes necessary for tissue survival. Unmodified HA has been used in clinical applications such as ocular surgery, wound healing, and plastic surgery. HA can be crosslinked to form hydrogels. HA hydrogels that were either unmodified or modified with <b>laminin</b> were implanted into an adult central nervous system lesion and tested for their ability to induce neural tissue formation in a study by Hou et al.. They demonstrated the ability to support cell ingrowth and angiogenesis, in addition to inhibiting glial scar formation. Also, the HA hydrogels modified with <b>laminin</b> were able to promote neurite extension. These results support HA gels as a promising biomaterial for a nerve guidance conduit.|$|E
50|$|<b>Laminins</b> are {{high-molecular}} weight (~400 to ~900 kDa) proteins of the extracellular matrix. They are a {{major component}} of the basal lamina (one of the layers of the basement membrane), a protein network foundation for most cells and organs. The <b>laminins</b> are an important and biologically active part of the basal lamina, influencing cell differentiation, migration, and adhesion.|$|R
40|$|The {{basement}} membrane (BM) proteins <b>laminins,</b> which consist of α, β, and γ chains, support tissue structures and cellular functions. To date only α 4 and α 5 types of <b>laminins</b> {{have been identified}} in the BMs of blood vessels. Our recent study suggested the presence of novel α 3 B-containing <b>laminins</b> in vascular BMs. Here we identified and characterized the third member of vascular <b>laminins,</b> laminin- 3 B 11 (Lm 3 B 11). RT-PCR analysis showed that microvascular endothelial (MVE) cells and umbilical vein endothelial cells expressed the messages for the α 3 B, β 1, β 2, and γ 1 chains. In the culture of MVE cells, α 3 B was associated with β 1 and γ 1, producing Lm 3 B 11. Recombinant Lm 3 B 11 was overexpressed by introducing the cDNAs of the three chains into HEK- 293 cells and purified to homogeneity. Purified Lm 3 B 11 exhibited relatively weak cell adhesion activity through both α 3 β 1 and α 6 β 1 integrins. Most characteristically, Lm 3 B 11 strongly stimulated MVE cells to extend many lamellipodial protrusions. This pseudopodial branching was blocked by an inhibitor for Src or phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase. Consistently, Lm 3 B 11 stimulated the phosphorylation of Src and Akt more strongly than other <b>laminins,</b> suggesting that the integrin-derived signaling is mediated by these factors. The unique activity of Lm 3 B 11 appears to be favorable to the branching of capillaries and venules...|$|R
50|$|<b>Laminins</b> were {{previously}} numbered - e.g. laminin-1, laminin-2, laminin-3 - but the nomenclature was recently changed to describe which chains {{are present in}} each isoform.|$|R
25|$|As {{noted in}} the above section, {{transforming}} growth factor-β2 (TGFβ2) is an important glial scar stimulant that directly affects astrocyte proliferation. Logan et al. developed monoclonal antibodies to TGFβ2, cerebral wounds were generated in rat brains, and the antibodies were administered via the ventricles, daily for 10 days. Subsequent analysis showed a marked reduction in glial scarring. Particularly, extracellular matrix protein deposition (<b>laminin,</b> fibronectin, and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans) was closer to baseline (levels of protein expression in an uninjured animal). Further, a reduction in astrocytes and microglia, {{as well as a}} reduction in inflammation and angiogenesis, were observed.|$|E
25|$|The basal {{membrane}} is a histopathological extracellular matrix feature that forms {{at the center}} of injury and partially covers the astrocytic processes. It is composed of three layers with the basal lamina as the prominent layer. Molecularly, the {{basal membrane}} is created by glycoprotein and proteoglycan protomers. Further, two independent networks are formed within the basal membrane by collagen IV and <b>laminin</b> for structural support. Other molecular components of the basal membrane include fibulin-1, fibronectin, entactin, and hepparan sulfate proteoglycan perlecan. Ultimately, the astrocytes attach to the basal membrane, and the complex surrounds the blood vessels and nervous tissue to form the initial wound covering.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have been}} {{conducted}} in attempts to enhance the migratory ability of Schwann cells. Schwann cell migration is regulated by integrins with ECM molecules such as fibronectin and <b>laminin.</b> In addition, neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) is known to enhance Schwann cell motility in vitro. NCAM is a glycoprotein that is expressed on axonal and Schwann cell membranes. Polysialic acid (PSA) is synthesized on NCAM by polysialyltransferase (PST) and sialyltransferase X (STX). During {{the development of the}} CNS, PSA expression on NCAM is upregulated until postnatal stages. However, in the adult brain PSA is found only in regions with high plasticity. PSA expression does not occur on Schwann cells.|$|E
40|$|We {{have found}} {{previously}} that human plasma-membrane-associated sialidase (NEU 3), a key glycosidase for ganglioside degradation, was markedly up-regulated in human colon cancers, with an involvement in suppression of apoptosis. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying increased NEU 3 expression, {{in the present}} study we investigated its role in cell adhesion of human colon cancer cells. DLD- 1 cells transfected with NEU 3 exhibited increased adhesion to <b>laminins</b> and consequent cell proliferation, but decreased cell adhesion to fibronectin and collagens I and IV, compared with control cells. When triggered by <b>laminins,</b> NEU 3 clearly stimulated phosphorylation of FAK (focal adhesion kinase) and ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase), whereas there was no activation on fibronectin. NEU 3 markedly enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of integrin β 4 with recruitment of Shc and Grb- 2 only on laminin- 5, and NEU 3 was co-immunoprecipitated by an anti-(integrin β 4) antibody, suggesting that association of NEU 3 with integrin β 4 might facilitate promotion of the integrin-derived signalling on laminin- 5. In addition, the promotion of phosphorylation of integrin β 1 and ILK (integrin-linked kinase) was also observed on <b>laminins.</b> GM 3 depletion as the result of NEU 3 overexpression, assessed by TLC, appeared {{to be one of the}} causes of the increased adhesion on <b>laminins</b> and, in contrast, of the decreased adhesion on fibronectin – NEU 3 probably having bimodal effects. These results indicate that NEU 3 differentially regulates cell proliferation through integrin-mediated signalling depending on the extracellular matrix and, on <b>laminins,</b> NEU 3 did indeed activate molecules often up-regulated in carcinogenesis, which may cause an acceleration of the malignant phenotype in cancer cells...|$|R
40|$|<b>Laminins</b> form {{essential}} {{components of}} the basement membrane and are integral to forming and maintaining muscle integrity. Mutations in the human Laminin-alpha 2 (LAMA 2) gene result in {{the most common form}} of congenital muscular dystrophy, MDC 1 A. We have previously identified a zebrafish model of MDC 1 A called candyfloss (caf), carrying a loss-of-function mutation in the zebrafish lama 2 gene. In the skeletal muscle, <b>laminins</b> connect the muscle cell to the extracellular matrix (ECM) by binding either dystroglycan or integrins at the cell membrane. Through epistasis experiments, we have established that both adhesion systems individually contribute to the maintenance of fibre adhesions and exhibit muscle detachment phenotypes. However, larval zebrafish in which both adhesion systems are simultaneously genetically inactivated possess a catastrophic failure of muscle attachment that is far greater than a simple addition of individual phenotypes would predict. We provide evidence that this is due to other crucial <b>laminins</b> present in addition to Lama 2, which aid muscle cell attachments and integrity. We have found that lama 1 is important for maintaining attachments, whereas lama 4 is localized and up-regulated in damaged fibres, which appears to contribute to fibre survival. Importantly, our results show that endogenous secretion of <b>laminins</b> from the surrounding tissues has the potential to reinforce fibre attachments and strengthen laminin-ECM attachments. Collectively these findings provide a better understanding of the cellular pathology of MDC 1 A and help in designing effective therapies...|$|R
50|$|<b>Laminins,</b> {{a family}} of {{extracellular}} matrix glycoproteins, are the major noncollagenous constituent of basement membranes. They have been implicated {{in a wide variety}} of biological processes including cell adhesion, differentiation, migration, signaling, neurite outgrowth and metastasis.|$|R
25|$|Collagen {{is a major}} {{component}} of the extracellular matrix, and it is found in the supporting tissues of peripheral nerves. A terpolymer (TERP) was synthesized by free radical copolymerization of its three monomers and cross-linked with collagen, creating a hybrid biological-synthetic hydrogel scaffold. The terpolymer is based on poly(NIPAAM), which is known to be a cell friendly polymer. TERP is used both as a cross-linker to increase hydrogel robustness and as a site for grafting of bioactive peptides or growth factors, by reacting some of its acryloxysuccinimide groups with the –NH2 groups on the peptides or growth factors. Because the collagen-terpolymer (collagen-TERP) hydrogel lacks a bioactive component, a study attached to it a common cell adhesion peptide found in <b>laminin</b> (YIGSR) in order to enhance its cell adhesion properties.|$|E
25|$|As PMCs {{begin to}} undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, the lamina which binds them dissolves {{to begin the}} {{mechanical}} release of the cells. Expression of the membrane protein that binds <b>laminin,</b> integrin, also becomes irregular {{at the beginning of}} ingression. The microvilli which secure PMCs to the hyaline layer shorten, as the cells reduce their affinity for the extraembryonic matrix. These cells concurrently increase their affinity for other components of the basal matrix, such as fibronectin, in part driving the movement of cells inward. The apical junctions which bind PMCs to their neighboring epithelial cells become disrupted during this transition, and are absent in cells that have fully ingressed into the blastocoel. Because staining for cadherins and catenins in ingressing cells decreases and develops as intracellular accumulations, apical junctions are thought to be cleared by endocytosis during ingression.|$|E
25|$|For {{patterns}} containing 0.5mg/ml <b>laminin,</b> {{a higher}} proportion of neurites grew on the microdispensed lines than between the lines. On 10mg/ml and 1mg/ml BSA protein patterns and fatty-acid free BSA protein patterns a significant number of neurites avoided the protein lines and grew between the lines. Thus, the fatty-acid-containing BSA lines were just as non-permissive for neurite growth as lines containing BSA with fatty acids. Because microdispensing does not require direct contact with the substrate surfaces, this technique can utilitze surfaces with delicate micro- or nanotopology that could be destroyed by contact. It is possible to vary the amount of protein deposited by dispensing more or less droplets. An advantage of microdispensing is that patterns can be created quickly in 5–10 minutes. Because the piezoelectric microdispenser does not require heating, heat-sensitive proteins and fluids as well as living cells can be dispensed.|$|E
40|$|Certain <b>laminins</b> of {{vascular}} basement membranes {{have been}} identified in human breast tumors and brain gliomas that share the same β 1 chain. These <b>laminins</b> are new carcinoma angiogenic markers and might represent potential targets for antiangiogenic therapy. Breast cancer {{is the leading cause of}} death from malignant tumors in women. In recent years, various biomarkers associated with breast cancer growth and angiogenesis have been described. The process of angiogenesis has attracted considerable interest as a target for cancer therapy, and inhibitors of the process may be less toxic than conventional chemotherapy as well as being associated with a lower risk of drug resistance. On the basis of these discoveries, several clinical trials are using angiogenesis inhibitors: type...|$|R
40|$|Apoptotic nucleosomes are {{structurally}} and immunologically {{involved in}} lupus nephritis. The {{purpose of this}} study was to examine the expression and function of <b>laminins</b> and their interactions with nucleosomes in the kidneys of patients with lupus nephritis, using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis...|$|R
50|$|The EGF-like domain is {{also part}} of <b>laminins,</b> an {{important}} group of extracellular proteins. The EGF-like domains are usually masked in intact membranes, but become exposed when the membrane is destroyed, e.g. during inflammation, thereby stimulating membrane growth and restoring damaged membrane parts.|$|R
25|$|Anti-dsDNA {{antibodies}} {{are highly}} associated with glomerulonephritis in SLE, although some patients with high titers of anti-dsDNA antibodies do not develop renal disease. This {{is most likely}} {{due to the fact}} that anti-dsDNA are a heterogeneous population, some of which have been found not to be pathogenic. Anti-dsDNA antibodies can be present in normal individuals, however these antibodies are usually low avidity IgM isotype. In contrast, pathogenic anti-dsDNA antibodies found in SLE are usually of IgG isotype and show high avidity for dsDNA. One possible mechanism for anti-dsDNA and their role in nephritis is the formation of immune complexes that arise by indirect binding to DNA or nucleosomes that are adhered to the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). Another mechanism is direct binding of antibodies to GBM antigens such as C1q, nucleosomal proteins, heparin sulphate or <b>laminin,</b> which can initiate an inflammatory response by activating complement. They can also be internalised by certain molecules on the GBM cells and cause inflammatory cascades, proliferation and alteration of cellular functions.|$|E
25|$|Prior to delamination, {{presumptive}} {{neural crest}} cells are initially anchored to neighboring cells by tight junction proteins such as occludin and cell adhesion molecules such as NCAM and N-Cadherin. Dorsally expressed BMPs initiate delamination by inducing {{the expression of}} the zinc finger protein transcription factors snail, slug, and twist. These factors play a direct role in inducing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition by reducing expression of occludin and N-Cadherin in addition to promoting modification of NCAMs with polysialic acid residues to decrease adhesiveness. Neural crest cells also begin expressing proteases capable of degrading cadherins such as ADAM10 and secreting matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that degrade the overlying basal lamina of the neural tube to allow neural crest cells to escape. Additionally, neural crest cells begin expressing integrins that associate with extracellular matrix proteins, including collagen, fibronectin, and <b>laminin,</b> during migration. Once the basal lamina becomes permeable the neural crest cells can begin migrating throughout the embryo.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} {{presenting}} multiple stimuli types such as chemical, physical, and biological cues on neural progenitor cell differentiation {{has not been}} explored. A {{study was conducted in}} which three different stimuli were presented to adult rat hippocampal progenitor cells (AHPCs): postnatal rat type-1 astrocytes (biological), <b>laminin</b> (chemical), and micropatterned substrate (physical). Over 75% of the AHPCs aligned within 20° of the grooves compared to random growth on the non-patterned substrates. When AHPCs were grown on micropatterned substrates with astrocytes, outgrowth was influenced by the astrocytes that had aligned with the grooves; namely, the AHPCs extended processes along the astrocytic cytoskeletal filaments. However, the alignment was not as significant as that seen by the AHPCs in culture alone with the micropatterned substrate. In order to assess the different phenotypes expressed as a result of differentiation, the cells were stained with antibodies for class III β-tubulin (TuJI), receptor interacting protein (RIP), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which are markers for early neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes, respectively. The greatest amount of differentiation was seen with AHPCs cultured on patterned substrates with astrocytes.|$|E
40|$|SummaryEndocrine {{pancreatic}} β cells require endothelial signals {{for their}} differentiation and function. However, the molecular basis for such signals remains unknown. Here, {{we show that}} β cells, {{in contrast to the}} exocrine pancreatic cells, do not form a basement membrane. Instead, by using VEGF-A, they attract endothelial cells, which form capillaries with a vascular basement membrane next to the β cells. We have identified <b>laminins,</b> among other vascular basement membrane proteins, as endothelial signals, which promote insulin gene expression and proliferation in β cells. We further demonstrate that β 1 -integrin is required for the β cell response to the <b>laminins.</b> The proposed mechanism explains why β cells must interact with endothelial cells, and it may apply to other cellular processes in which endothelial signals are required...|$|R
50|$|ECM-tumor cell {{interactions}} play {{a critical}} role in each of the events of the metastatic cascade. Interactions of the breast cancer cells with integrins, fibronectin, <b>laminins,</b> collagens, hyaluronan and proteoglycans can contribute to the metastatic process. Some of these proteins are discussed here in relation to breast-cancer metastasis.|$|R
50|$|Nidogen-1 is {{a member}} of the nidogen family of {{basement}} membrane glycoproteins. The protein interacts with several other components of basement membranes. Structurally it (along with perlecan) connects the networks formed by collagens and <b>laminins</b> to each other. It may also play a role in cell interactions with the extracellular matrix.|$|R
25|$|Microdispensing {{was used}} to create micropatterns on {{polystyrene}} culture dishes by dispensing droplets of adhesive <b>laminin</b> and non-adhesive bovine serum albumin (BSA) solutions. The microdispenser is a piezoelectric element attached to a push-bar {{on top of a}} channel etched in silicon, which has one inlet at each end and a nozzle in the middle. The piezoelectric element expands when voltage is applied, causing liquid to be dispensed through the nozzle. The microdispenser is moved using a computer-controlled x-y table. The micropattern resolution depends on many factors: dispensed liquid viscosity, drop pitch (the distance between the centre of two adjacent droplets in a line or array), and the substrate. With increasing viscosity the lines become thinner, but if the liquid viscosity is too high the liquid cannot be expelled. Heating the solution creates more uniform protein lines. Although some droplet overlap is necessary to create continuous lines, uneven evaporation may cause uneven protein concentration along the lines; this can be prevented through smoother evaporation by modifying the dispensed solution properties.|$|E
25|$|Semaphorin-neuropilin repulsive {{signaling}} works synergistically with EphB signaling {{to guide}} neural crest cells down the rostral half of somites in mice. In chick embryos, semaphorin {{acts in the}} cephalic region to guide neural crest cells through the pharyngeal arches. On top of repulsive repulsive signaling, neural crest cells express β1and α4 integrins which allows for binding and guided interaction with collagen, <b>laminin,</b> and fibronectin of the extracellular matrix as they travel. Additionally, crest cells have intrinsic contact inhibition with one another while freely invading tissues of different origin such as mesoderm. Neural crest cells that migrate through the rostral half of somites differentiate into sensory and sympathetic neurons of the peripheral nervous system. The other main route neural crest cells take is dorsolaterally between the epidermis and the dermamyotome. Cells migrating through this path differentiate into pigment cells of the dermis. Further neural crest cell differentiation and specification into their final cell type is biased by their spatiotemporal subjection to morphogenic cues such as BMP, Wnt, FGF, Hox, and Notch.|$|E
25|$|Anti-double {{stranded}} DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies {{are highly}} associated with SLE. They {{are a very}} specific marker for the disease, with some studies quoting nearly 100%. Data on sensitivity ranges from 25–85%. Anti-dsDNA antibody levels, known as titres, correlate with disease activity in SLE; high levels indicate more active lupus. The presence of anti-dsDNA antibodies is also linked with lupus nephritis and there is evidence they are the cause. Some anti-dsDNA antibodies are cross reactive with other antigens found on {{the glomerular basement membrane}} (GBM) of the kidney, such as heparan sulphate, collagen IV, fibronectin and <b>laminin.</b> Binding to these antigens within the kidney could cause inflammation and complement fixation, resulting in kidney damage. Presence of high DNA-binding and low C3 levels have been shown to have extremely high predictive value (94%) for the diagnosis of SLE. It is also possible that the anti-dsDNA antibodies are internalised by cells when they bind membrane antigens and then are displayed on the cell surface. This could promote inflammatory responses by T-cells within the kidney. It {{is important to note that}} not all anti-dsDNA antibodies are associated with lupus nephritis and that other factors can cause this symptom in their absence. The antigen of anti-dsDNA antibodies is double stranded DNA.|$|E

40|$|SummaryTarget-derived factors {{organize}} synaptogenesis {{by promoting}} differentiation of nerve terminals at synaptic sites. Several candidate organizing molecules {{have been identified}} based on their bioactivities in vitro, but {{little is known about}} their roles in vivo. Here, we show that three sets of organizers act sequentially to pattern motor nerve terminals: FGFs, β 2 <b>laminins,</b> and collagen α(IV) chains. FGFs of the 7 / 10 / 22 subfamily and broadly distributed collagen IV chains (α 1 / 2) promote clustering of synaptic vesicles as nerve terminals form. β 2 <b>laminins</b> concentrated at synaptic sites are dispensable for embryonic development of nerve terminals but are required for their postnatal maturation. Synapse-specific collagen IV chains (α 3 – 6) accumulate only after synapses are mature and are required for synaptic maintenance.
