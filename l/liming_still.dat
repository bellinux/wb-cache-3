40|$|To {{assess the}} effects of dolomitic {{limestone}} applications on soil microbial communities' dynamics and bacterial and fungal biomass, relative abundance, and diversity in metal reclaimed regions. The {{study was conducted in}} reclaimed mining sites and metal uncontaminated areas. The limestone applications were performed over 35 years ago. Total microbial biomass was determined by Phospholipid fatty acids. Bacterial and fungal relative abundance and diversity were assessed using 454 pyrosequencing. There was a significant increase of total microbial biomass in limed sites (342 ng/g) compared to unlimed areas (149 ng/g). Chao 1 estimates followed the same trend. But the total number of OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units) in limed (463 OTUs) and unlimed (473 OTUs) soil samples for bacteria were similar. For fungi, OTUs were 96 and 81 for limed and unlimed soil samples, respectively. Likewise, Simpson and Shannon diversity indices revealed no significant differences between limed and unlimed sites. Bacterial and fungal groups specific to either limed or unlimed sites were identified. Five major bacterial phyla including Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria were found. The latter was the most prevalent phylum in all the samples with a relative abundance of 50 %. Bradyrhizobiaceae family with 12 genera including the nitrogen fixing Bradirhizobium genus was more abundant in limed sites compared to unlimed areas. For fungi, Ascomycota was the most predominant phylum in unlimed soils (46 %) while Basidiomycota phylum represented 86 % of all fungi in the limed areas. Detailed analysis of the data revealed that although soil liming increases significantly the amount of microbial biomass, the level of species diversity remain statistically unchanged even though the microbial compositions of the damaged and restored sites are different. Soil <b>liming</b> <b>still</b> have a significant beneficial effects on soil microbial abundance and composition > 35 years after dolomitic limestone applications...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{the extension of}} a flexibility-based large increment method (LIM) for the case of cyclic loading. In the last few years, LIM has been successfully tested for solving a range of non-linear structural problems involving elastoplastic material models under monotonic loading. In these analyses, the force-based LIM algorithm provided robust solutions and significant computational savings compared to the displacement-based finite element approach by using fewer elements and integration points. Although in cyclic analysis a step-by-step solution procedure has to be adopted {{to account for the}} plastic history, <b>LIM</b> will <b>still</b> have many advantages over the traditional finite element method. Before going into the basic idea of this extension, a brief discussion regarding LIM governing equations is presented followed by the proposed solution procedure. Next, the formulation is specified for the treatment of the elastic perfectly plastic beam element. The local stage for the beam behavior is discussed in detail and the required improvement for the LIM methodology is described. Illustrative truss and beam examples are presented for different non-linear material models. The results are compared with those obtained from a standard displacement method and again highlight the potential benefits of the proposed flexibility-based approach...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] Immobilization-induced atrophy is {{a general}} {{phenomenon}} caused by prolonged muscle dis-use associated with orthopaedic conditions. However, changes in the phosphorylation of atrophy-related cofilin and <b>LIM</b> kinases are <b>still</b> poorly understood. In this study, we examined whether or not phosphorylation of cofilin and LIM kinases is altered in the skeletal muscles of rats after 3, 7, 14, and 21 days of cast immobilization. [Methods] We used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, and western blotting to examine protein expression and phosphorylation in atrophied rat gastrocnemius muscles. [Results] The expression of the cofilin was detected in gastrocnemius muscle strips using proteomic analysis. Cast immobilization after 3, 7, 14, and 21 days significantly diminished the phosphorylation of cofilin and LIM kinases. [Conclusion] The present results suggest that cast immobilization-induced atrophy may be in part related {{to changes in the}} phosphorylation of cofilin and LIM kinases in rat skeletal muscles...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to improve the {{understanding}} of the large-scale mechanisms underlying the recovery of the zooplankton of Lake Orta from historical contamination following the liming intervention (1989 / 90).). The pollution has been severe and long-lasting (1929 - 1990). Previous analysis of subfossil Cladocera remains and rotifer resting stages in sedimentary archives, coupled with long-term monitoring data of planktonic pelagic population has indicated both the extinction of many taxa than the attempt of recolonization by rotifers. Our results highlighted that the most number of new taxa recorded by countings belonged to Rotifers, and that, Calanoids and big Cladocera predators (Bythotrephes and Leptodora) living in the nearby Lake Maggiore, 17 years after <b>liming,</b> were <b>still</b> absent. We assessed, also, the annual persistence of Crustacea and Rotifer taxa (P) as an estimator of whether introduced propagules that survived, also thrived. We found that the rate of introduction of zooplankton colonists and their persistence in the water column of Lake Orta have changed over time (1971 - 2007). New rotifers taxa attempted to colonize the lake after middle 2 ̆ 780, when the discharge of toxic substances decreased, but their persistence was low (P < 0. 5) until the beginning of 2000 s. The unexpected high values of Crustacea persistence recorded in Lake Orta in 2001 and 2007, in comparison to other environments (Sudbury lakes), could be related to the lack of zooplanktivorous fish in the pelagic waters...|$|R
40|$|Summary Cells {{recognize}} {{and respond to}} changes in intra- and extracellular mechanical conditions to maintain their mechanical homeostasis. Linear contractile bundles of actin filaments and myosin II known as stress fibres (SFs) mediate mechanical signals. Mechanical cues such as excessive stress driven by myosin II and/or external force may damage SFs and induce the local transient accumulation of SF-repair complexes (zyxin and VASP) at the damaged sites. Using an atomic force microscope mounted on a fluorescence microscope, we applied mechanical damage to cells expressing fluorescently tagged cytoskeletal proteins and recorded the subsequent mobilization of SF-repair complexes. We found that a LIM protein, paxillin, transiently accumulated at the damaged sites earlier than zyxin, while paxillin knockdown {{did not affect the}} kinetics of zyxin translocation. The C-terminal half of paxillin, comprising four-tandem <b>LIM</b> domains, can <b>still</b> translocate to damaged sites on SFs, suggesting that the LIM domain is essential for the mechanosensory function of paxillin. Our findings demonstrate a crucial role of the LIM domain in mechanosensing LIM proteins...|$|R

40|$|The {{retrieval}} of series of proxy {{data on the}} past c limate will serve to acquire {{a deeper understanding of}} the climate system and a more accu rate prediction of its future development, as a priority task for the scientific community. In particular, the analysis of climate data of the past is an essential tool for s tudying the dynamics of the earth's climatic system under conditions different from those of tod ay, and irreplaceable for testing the validity of medium- and long-term forecasting model s. The determination of the influence of anthropogenic impacts on the planet’s environmen t is predicated on a clear understanding of the natural ways in which the eart h's climate responds to the complex set of external forcings. Therefore, in recent decades, many national and international research groups have focused attention on the study of the climate evolution in late- Quaternary sediments from the Mediterranean area. B y virtue of its close relationship with continental masses subject to different climatic pr ocesses, the Mediterranean basin permits the documentation of climate evolution both globally and in the Northern Hemisphere. Finally, it is worth noting that shallo w sea (continental shelf) areas are natural repositories for the monitoring of short-term clima te change and anthropogenic impacts on the marine system. To make available information on climate history and environment yielded by marine sediments, this WP will be dedica ted to analyzing and, where possible, collecting cores of marine sediments, especially th ose drilled in shallow sea environments, and focusing on climate dynamics in the Mediterrane an over past centuries. During its course, the project will analyse and, where possibl e, sample marine sediment cores in continental shelf environments and in different sec tors of the Mediterranean basin.

40|$|Forest liming has {{received}} increased {{attention in the}} 1980 s, when unusual needle yellowing and fall were observed in large parts of Europe and North America. This ‘new forest decline’ {{has been attributed to}} several causes acting individually or synergetically, amongst which were acidification, N saturation and nutritional imbalances. This time, liming did not aim at increased productivity, but as a counteracting measure to the soil acidification and to remove nutritional imbalances. 	The Belgian Ardennes were not exempt from this phenomena and symptoms of forest dieback were reported in 1983 by Weissen (Weissen et al., 1983). Soils are naturally poor in magnesium and the observed dieback {{was supposed to be the}} consequence of increased pollution exacerbating the deficiency in magnesium. A reduction in productivity and financial losses were predicted. Liming was suggested for prevention and correction, however possible side effects, in particular on soil solution (tree nutrition) and stream water chemistry (drinking water) needed to be evaluated. 	In this paper, we present results from a case study in four Picea abies watersheds in southern Belgium. The paired watersheds of approximately 80 ha were situated in the ‘Haute Ardenne’ and in the ‘Ardenne occidentale’ regions, on acid brown soils. One watershed of each pair was limed with 3 T/ha of fine ground dolomite ((Ca,Mg) CO 3) 55 / 40 and 200 kg/ha K 2 SO 4 in 1992 and 1993, respectively. Rainfall, throughfall and monolith lysimeter soil solution were analysed at monthly intervals, and runoff chemistry at two-weekly intervals (volume-weighed reconstructed daily samples). Time series intervention analysis was used as a tool to detect statistically significant changes in stream water chemistry due to the liming event, and fluxes were calculated to evaluate losses of the applied dolomitic lime to the catchment stream. 	Dolomite dissolution distinctively affected streamwater chemistry in the watershed situated in the Hautes Ardennes (Waroneu). Magnesium concentrations increased immediately after liming, most likely due to surface runoff. Four years after <b>liming,</b> concentrations were <b>still</b> higher than prior to liming. However, the proportions of magnesium lost were relatively low compared to the dose applied. Calcium concentrations did not change after liming in either catchment, nor did the concentrations of the major cations and anions measured. In the monolith lysimeters, magnesium concentrations increased immediately after liming under the organic horizons, and one year after liming under the mineral horizons. Calcium concentrations increased only three years after the application of lime under the organic and mineral horizons. These results led to the conclusions that for the soils under study and the doses applied, a major part of the lime was retained by the soil system, and that consequences on water chemistry were minor...|$|R
