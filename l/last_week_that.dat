500|$|United had {{won four}} of the first five editions of the newly-branded league, and were on course to {{continue}} their domination after opening up a sizeable lead in February 1998. Injuries and poor results however destabilised the team, {{and by the time}} Arsenal visited Old Trafford in March, a title race was looking probable. Wenger was bullish of his team's chances: [...] "I told you <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>that</b> the race was not over when the bookmakers stopped betting. Surprise, surprise, they have started taking money again." [...] A goal from Marc Overmars set Arsenal on the way to victory, which put them six points behind with three games in hand. They eventually won the league, and secured the double by beating Newcastle United in the Cup final.|$|E

2500|$|Every Conservative MP {{has been}} {{instructed}} by pager message not to voice doubts {{about a possible}} war to journalists, but to share them privately with Mr Duncan Smith or the chief whip, David Maclean. Despite this warning, several Tories, including one on the front bench, have openly dissented from the party line. Jonathan Sayeed, a shadow Environment minister, told the Commons <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>that</b> he had heard no convincing case for war. [...] "Every television company will broadcast to the world, including the Arab world, harrowing pictures of the human catastrophe that warfare leaves in its wake, and the closer war comes to Baghdad the greater will be the innocent casualties." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the news}} broke {{at the end}} of the week tributes have poured in for the former Ajax and Netherlands legend, with all Eredivisie games {{featuring}} a round of applause on 14 minutes, Cruyff’s former shirt number. Ahead of their league game against Eibar at the Camp Nou (25 October 2015), Barcelona players showed their support for Cruyff by wearing orange T-shirts bearing the words 'Ànims Johan' (Catalan for 'Get well soon Johan'). Writing in his weekly De Telegraaf column, Cruyff admitted, “Often the media are an additional tax, but the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>that</b> has been different. The way in which a reply is posted via a variety of media in my situation, was emotional and heartwarming. I am extremely proud of the appreciation shown by all responses.” On his condition, Cruyff added, “Meanwhile, we have to wait. It’s really annoying that it has been leaked so quickly, because the only thing I know now is that I have lung cancer. No more. Because the investigation is ongoing.” ...|$|E

40|$|Remote {{northern}} {{indigenous communities}} {{are prone to}} annual flood, cyclonic events, and severe fire danger periods <b>lasting</b> <b>weeks,</b> <b>that</b> frequently result in environmentally destructive wildfires. Although effective responses to such events are typically hindered by inadequate infrastructural resources, of equal concern is the paucity of culturally appropriate ‘two-way’ planning aids which can help inform both non-indigenous and indigenous governance institutions, and build local community resilience. Based on extensive savanna fire management research describing fire impacts {{on a variety of}} ecosystem services and values, here we describe the development and testing of mapping tools to assist community-based fire management planning in two remote Arnhem Land communities...|$|R

6000|$|But in our polite {{society we}} have as yet found no better method than {{beginning}} {{with a sort of}} medical diagnosis--"How do you do?" [...] This admits of no answer.
