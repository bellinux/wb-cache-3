40|$|Land {{leveling}} or {{land grading}} for irrigation is modifying the surface relief {{of a field}} to a planned grade {{to provide a more}} suitable surface for efficiently applying irrigation water. Normally land leveling requires moving a lot of earth over several hundred feet. This {{should not be confused with}} land planning, <b>land</b> <b>smoothing,</b> or land floating. They are usually accomplished with special equipment to eliminate minor irregularities, and they do not change the general topography of the land surface. Rough grading is removing knolls, mounds, or ridges and filling pockets or swales in a field that is not to have a planned grade. Often no construction stake. are set and reliance is placed on the 2 ̆ 2 eye 2 ̆ 2 of the equipment operator to obtain the desired field surface. Rough grading is seldom adequate for lands to be surface irrigated...|$|E

The same applies to our people; they're bubbling over with raw, optimistic vigor, their corners are not rubbed off. Some of them would jar on overcivilized people, but not, I think, on any one with understanding." [...] He spread out his hands. [...] "You have an example; I'm spouting at large again." ...|$|R

40|$|Land {{has always}} {{been one of the most}} {{important}} and controversial assets in Ireland and land mobility continues to be a critical issue to the future success of the Irish agricultural sector (FH 2020). The Irish agricultural sector is still portrayed by a low level of land mobility and late transfer pattern with small farms and an older farming population. Policies and schemes applied to the agricultural sector to improve land mobility situation appear to be failing to have the desired effect. The overall objective of this study is to assess the present situation and identify potential solutions that could improve <b>land</b> mobility and <b>smooth</b> <b>land</b> transfer in the Irish agricultural sector as perceived by the Irish farmer...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{an online}} {{adaptation}} algorithm for bipedal walking on uneven surfaces with height uncertainty is proposed. In order to generate walking patterns on flat terrains, the trajectories {{in the task}} space are planned to satisfy the dynamic balance and slippage avoidance constraints, and also to guarantee <b>smooth</b> <b>landing</b> of the swing foot. To ensure <b>smooth</b> <b>landing</b> of the swing foot on surfaces with height uncertainty, the preplanned trajectories in the task space should be adapted. The proposed adaptation algorithm consists of two stages. In the first stage, once the swing foot reaches its maximum height, the supervisory control is initiated until the touch is detected. After the detection, the trajectories in the task space are modified to guarantee <b>smooth</b> <b>landing.</b> In the second stage, this modification is preserved during the Double Support Phase (DSP), and released in the next Single Support Phase (SSP). Effectiveness of the proposed online adaptation algorithm is experimentally verified through realization of the walking patterns on the SURENA III humanoid robot, designed and fabricated at CAST. The walking is tested on a surface with various flat obstacles, where the swing foot is prone to either land on the ground soon or late...|$|R

50|$|This {{undercarriage}} (built by Dowty in England) was {{the subject}} of patents in Norway, Sweden, and Canada, and was constructed {{in such a way that}} the skis would be properly aligned for retraction and extension, and while lowered in flight, but would be free to move under landing forces, pivoting and deflecting to facilitate a <b>smooth</b> <b>landing</b> on rough snow or ice.|$|R
50|$|In September 1993 the Pond racer {{was entered}} again and once more, piloted by Rick Brickert. During qualifying, the {{aircraft}} began leaking oil and suffered an engine failure leaving the right propeller unfeathered. Brickett pulled up, lowered the landing gear, and chose {{to perform a}} belly landing by retracting the gear again. The aircraft overshot a <b>smooth</b> <b>landing</b> area and crashed in rough terrain, killing the pilot.|$|R
50|$|The robot uses gyro {{stabilization}} to stay level during flight, {{to provide}} a clear view from the onboard camera, and to ensure a <b>smooth</b> <b>landing.</b> Sand Flea can jump about 25 times on one charge.

50|$|In Tongan cosmogony, {{the sky and}} the sea, and {{the land}} of Pulotu (the dark underworld, the home of the souls of {{departed}} chiefs) existed from the earliest times. All other lands were created later. Either they were thrown down from the sky by Havea Hikuleo or, subsequently, they were fished up by Maui {{from the bottom of the}} ocean. All the makafonua (landstones) of Hikuleo were full of unevenness, and tended to jump around (that is, they were the source of earthquakes) and were full of holes and pits (that is, volcanoes), while Maui's <b>lands</b> were <b>smooth</b> (coral islands and atolls). Ata and Eua, the islands which were fished up first, were quite hilly, as Maui apparently was not an expert fisherman yet. His next catch, (Tongatapu) he kept much smoother.|$|R
50|$|The Mountbatten class {{hovercraft}} is {{the largest}} civilian hovercraft ever built, and is capable of traveling over relatively <b>smooth</b> <b>land</b> in addition to water. It is capable of carrying 418 people, and 60 cars. Hovercraft are also used by the military for their amphibious landing capabilities. They are {{commonly referred to as}} air-cushioned landing craft. These vehicles are usually very large compared to other land vehicles, and commonly carry other land vehicles like jeeps and armored vehicles.|$|R

Secondly, the villains rarely had a <b>smooth</b> <b>landing</b> in their arrival, always ending either in awkward poses or locations.|$|R
40|$|The {{study area}} {{of this work}} is the region of Machado, South {{of the state of}} Minas Gerais in Brazil. This area is {{representative}} of the region?s coffee production <b>lands,</b> including <b>smooth</b> to undulating landscapes. The region produces quality and organic coffees in small holding farms. Due to its importance, Machado?s coffee production has been studied by the Epamig Geotechnology Laboratory since the year 2000. The objective of this work was to evaluate the region?s coffee lands in time and space. The region was mapped using remote sensing images and the GIS SPRING for the years 2000, 2003, 2005 and 2007. It was observed that coffee production in Machado is not static and is being renovated since 2000. Using GIS it was possible to quantify and map the changes that occurred during these seven years. 200...|$|R
5000|$|Koonawarra is {{a suburb}} of Wollongong, New South Wales, Australia. It {{is located on the}} western shore of Lake Illawarra. Koonawarra, or Exmouth, as it was then called, {{was one of the first}} five land grants located in the Illawarra. It was a grant of 1300 acres made to Richard Brooks in 1817. The grant faced Lake Illawarra and {{extended}} from Brook's Creek to Mullet Creek. Koonawarra was the aboriginal name for the area. [...] "Exmouth" [...] was later secured by Henry Osborne and became part of his central Illawarra estate, extending from Macquarie Rivulet to Mullet Creek, and from Lake Illawarra to the mountains. The name Koonawarra is from the aboriginal word [...] "gkoonawarra" [...] meaning [...] "a high point of <b>land</b> with <b>smooth,</b> round stones".

50|$|Later {{that same}} year Merrill {{received}} a Signal Corps radio message to fly to Ninilchik and airlift a schoolteacher, near death from a gunshot wound, to Anchorage. Merrill, with his critically wounded passenger, circled and recircled Anchorage at night trying to distinguish the landing field on the park strip. When the citizens realized his plight, they set bonfires around the field and used automobile lights to help indicate the direction. Merrill executed a <b>smooth</b> <b>landing,</b> thus making the first night landing ever in Anchorage.|$|R
25|$|After further ocean landing tests, {{the first}} stage of the CRS-5 launch vehicle {{attempted}} to land on a floating platform, the autonomous spaceport drone ship, in January 2015. The rocket guided itself to the ship successfully but landed too hard for survival.
