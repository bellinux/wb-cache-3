40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} an {{investigation}} of the mechanisms of edge wicking in retortable paperboard. Retortable board is used for packaging preserved food, a process which requires that the package and its contents be sterilised by exposure to high temperature steam for up to three hours. The board used must thus have higher water repellence than traditional liquid packaging. Water vapour that condenses on the cut edges {{on the outside of the}} board causes particular concern. The paperboards studied were made from refined and unrefined bleached softwood kraft pulp and from refined unbleached softwood kraft pulp in one or two plies with different sizing levels and structures. Samples of each of the boards were immersed in a water bath at 95 °C. Other samples from the same boards were exposed to a combination of saturated steam at 130 °C and condensed steam in a special apparatus developed for this purpose. The board samples were placed on a cooling plate to simulate the temperature gradient when a container of cold food is sterilised with heated steam. Still other samples were exposed to heated steam in the absence of condensation by hanging them freely in the apparatus. The extent of edge wicking in the boards was determined by gravimetric measurements and also by near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, a technique that yields more information about the moisture content profiles and the mechanisms of liquid sorption. The moisture content profiles of boards exposed to saturated steam in the absence of condensation show more uniform water uptake. This phenomenon can be explained by rapid vapour phase transport throughout the pore structure, followed by slower water uptake in the fibres. By contrast, in samples exposed to both heated steam and condensed steam, there was both liquid sorption in the fibre network and rapid vapour phase transport of the steam. The moisture content in those samples was much higher close to the edge and lower behind the liquid frontier. The edge wicking of high temperature water was greatest in board that was not fully sized, in <b>low</b> <b>density</b> <b>board,</b> and in board made from unrefined pulp. The greater edge wicking in board made from unbleached pulp can be accounted for in terms of its greater swelling potential. In the <b>low</b> <b>density</b> <b>board</b> and the board made from unrefined pulp, the lumens at the unsized edge and the weaker bonding strength are suggested to affect the results. Capillary sorption takes place in lumens and delaminated bonds at the edge and then any further propagation takes place entirely by fibre diffusion. Capillary sorption may also be important in damaged areas where broken fibre-fibre bonds are exposed to liquid. The weaker bonded area in <b>low</b> <b>density</b> <b>board</b> therefore also contributes to water sorption. Edge wicking in the boards placed on the cooling plate and exposed to a combination of saturated and condensed steam was of a different nature. For these samples, density was not an important factor. The difference is due to the different mechanism at work in this case, where the relative area of the edge exposed to condensed steam was larger in the high density boards than in the low density boards. In the high density boards, condensed steam was sorbed in the structure by diffusion in the fibre structure, whereas in low density boards, the dominant effect was vapour phase transport in the void spaces followed by water uptake in the fibres.

50|$|Cement {{boards are}} mainly cement bonded {{particle}} boards and cement fibre. Cement bonded particle boards have treated wood flakes as reinforcement, whereas in cement fibre boards have cellulose fibre, {{which is a}} plant extract as reinforcement. Cement acts as binder in both the cases. The fire resistance properties of cement bonded blue particle boards and cement fibre boards are the same. In terms of load-bearing capacity, cement-bonded particle boards have higher capacity than cement fibre boards. Cement particle boards can be manufactured from 6 mm to 40 mm thickness making it ideally suitable for high load bearing applications.These boards are made of a homogeneous mixture and hence are formed as single layer for any thickness.Cement fibre boards are more used in decorative applications and can be manufactured from 3 mm to 20 mm thickness. Fibre boards are made in very thin layers, making it extremely difficult to manufacture high thickness boards. Many manufacturers use additives like mica, aluminium stearate and cenospheres {{in order to achieve}} certain board qualities. Typical cement fiber board is made of approximately 40-60% of cement, 20-30% of fillers, 8-10% of cellulose, 10-15% of mica. Other additives like above mentioned aluminium stearate and PVA are normally used in quantities less than 1%. Cenospheres are used only in <b>low</b> <b>density</b> <b>boards</b> with quantities between 10-15%. The actual recipe depends on available raw materials and other local factors.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} use of {{agricultural}} waste materials as alternative raw material for thermal insulation for dwellings in Thailand. A literature review carried out to study the potential of several agricultural waste materials suggested that coconut husks, bagasse and rice hulls offer high potential due to their availability in Thailand, low thermal conductivity, and ability to be made into <b>low</b> <b>density</b> <b>boards.</b> The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was carried out to compare the environmental and health impacts of thermal insulation boards made from agricultural waste materials currently available on the market with conventional insulation materials. This suggested that the currently available thermal insulation boards made from agricultural waste materials generally had more environmental and health impacts than conventional insulation materials. However, coconut husks and bagasse showed potential; the environmental and health impacts of the insulation boards made from these materials were low and could be lower provided that they were produced with lower thermal conductivity and lower density and without chemical binder. Low-density binderless thermal insulation boards were then developed from coconut husks and bagasse using a hot pressing method with varying hot pressing conditions. The results showed that <b>board</b> <b>density,</b> hot pressing temperature and pressing time {{were associated with the}} physical properties of both coconut husk and bagasse insulation boards, including modulus of rupture, modulus of elasticity and internal bond. It was also found that while both binderless coconut and bagasse insulation boards had thermal conductivity values in the same range as those of conventional insulation materials, the binderless bagasse insulation boards had better mechanical properties than coconut boards. Binderless bagasse insulation boards produced at a density of 350 kg/m 3 treated at a hot pressing temperature of 200 °C for 13 min could satisfy the requirements of JIS A 5905 : 2003 Insulation Fibreboards except for thickness swelling. LCA was carried out for two potential bagasse insulation boards (350 and 230 kg/m 3 density) in comparison with conventional insulation materials. The results suggested that a board of 230 kg/m 3 density offers lower environmental impacts than cellulose, fibreglass and rock wool insulations. The outcome of this study indicates that bagasse, an agricultural waste material, has significant potential as alternative raw material for thermal insulation production in the context of Thailand.

The hot pressing method was used and this article reports on the effect of <b>board</b> <b>density</b> and pressing conditions on the properties of the insulation boards. Mechanical properties of the coconut husk and bagasse insulation boards were measured for comparison with the standard employed in Thailand: JIS A 5905 : 2003 Insulation Fibreboards.

The composites are produced from industrial byproducts, such as shavings and ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene), without coupling agent. The two components are derived from industrial processes of furniture manufacturing: the first one consists of wood residues resulted from planing machine as planer shavings, and the second one from ABS edge banding operation. A wide array of mixtures varying from 100 % ABS to 50 % ABS: 50 % shavings were used to produce eight variants of <b>boards.</b> <b>Density</b> was determined for each board and the method for the determination of ABS particle size distribution by oscillating screen method using sieve apertures up to 4 mm was also applied, {{in order to establish}} the particle fractions and the distribution of their sizes. Based on ABS properties, several technologies of manufacturing wood-plastic composites from the waste materials were tested {{and one of them was}} selected. The results of the first stage analysis, when the physical integrity and the compactness of the panels’ structures were tested, have shown that a maximum proportion of 30 % of wood shavings is accepted in the mixture.

In this context high quality aerogel based thermal super insulation materials are {{of critical importance}} to energy-efficiency, {{as a lot of}} thermal and therefore energy losses can be reduced for example in industrial processes, buildings or even in the transportation sector. Research and development made great progress and nowadays the properties of silica aerogels with respect to density, thermal conductivity, mechanical strength and shrinkage are adjustable via sol-gel processing. Also the development of composite materials, like embedding aerogel granulates or infiltrating them to nonwoven felts improved the materials. Further investigations to manufacture super-insulating, <b>low</b> <b>density,</b> flame resistant <b>boards</b> leads to the combination of aerogels with honeycombs in general and silica aerogels with paper honeycombs especially. In this combination the selected silica aerogels provide a <b>low</b> <b>density</b> around 0. 1 g/cm 3, a specific surface area in the range of 100 - 1000 m 2 /g, low thermal conductivity under SATP conditions between 0. 01 - 0. 03 W/mK and a high sound absorption. The paper-honeycombs on the other hand are cheap and widely used for all kinds of packaging, easy and sustainable in production. They possess a <b>low</b> <b>density</b> and thus combine light weight with high stiffness. We report on successfully manufacturing of such composites. The challenges in the preparation are to have almost shrinkage free aerogels, no cracks developing during drying and a perfect bonding at the paper-silica interface. The composite materials are characterized with respect to their mechanical properties (compression and bending tests), microstructure analysis (SEM/TEM), thermal conductivity, flammability and gas permeability. The composite withstand easily 20 minutes at 1000 °C open flame without damage on the backside of the aerogel filled board.

40|$|The direct {{vasoactive}} {{effects of}} native and oxidatively modified <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins {{as well as}} their effects on endothelium-dependent relaxations to 5 -hydroxytryptamine were studied in isolated rings of pig right coronary artery. Slowly developing contractions were caused by native <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins (100 micrograms protein/ml). The contractions were more pronounced in the absence than {{in the presence of the}} trace metal chelator, EDTA, and coincided with the formation of lipid peroxides during the response. The lipophilic antioxidant, butylated hydroxytoluene, prevented the oxidation of, and contraction to, native <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins. <b>Low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins oxidized by exposure to copper contracted coronary arteries more rapidly with a threshold of only 1 micrograms protein/ml, but with a similar maximal contraction at 100 micrograms protein/ml. Superoxide dismutase inhibited the contraction to native <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins, but not to oxidized <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins. Catalase blocked contractions to both native and oxidized <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins. Contractions to oxidized <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins were unaffected by indomethacin, but were abolished by removal of the endothelium or by inhibitors of endothelium-derived relaxing factor. Oxidized <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins but not native <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins inhibited endothelium-dependent relaxations to 5 -hydroxytryptamine. Thus, oxidized <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins caused endothelium-dependent coronary artery contractions which are mediated by a hydroperoxide. Contractions to native <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins are due to their oxidation in the organ chamber by the superoxide anion radical. Oxidized, but not native, <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins impair normal endothelial cell vasodilator function in vitro.

The B apoprotein separated from other apoproteins by delipidation and selective precipitation with tetramethylurea could not be distinguished from B apoprotein prepared by the conventional gel filtration technique. After injection of [3 H]lysine, specific activity of B apoprotein was maximal in very <b>low</b> <b>density</b> and <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins 1 and 11 / 2 -h later, respectively, {{in a manner consistent}} with a precursor-product relationship. When protein-labeled very <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins were injected into rats, the relationships of specific activity again indicated that B apoprotein of very <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins may be the sole precursor of that of <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins. However, less than 10 % of the B apoprotein that disappeared from very <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins appeared in density lipoproteins.

40|$|Summary: Oxidatively {{modified}} <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins {{are thought}} {{to play an important}} role in the generation of macrophage-derived foam cells in early atherosclerotic lesions. Cultured endothelial cells, monocytes, macrophages and smooth muscle cells can modify <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins, either by a free radical mechanism or by the action of lipoxygenases. Previous studies demonstrated that activated human polymorphonuclear leukocytes can oxidize <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein lipids. Stimulation of the cells with phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate resulted in an increase both in Superoxide anion production and in <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein oxidation. The present results show that the oxidative modification of <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins by human polymorpho-nuclear leukocytes can be inhibited by Superoxide dismutase but not by the lipoxygenase inhibitor, (5, 8, 11, 14) -eicosatetraynoic acid.

MethodsThe sensitivity of plasma <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein for cupric ion (Cu 2 +) —induced peroxidation was examined. <b>Low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein was isolated from plasma in 112 patients: 21 with active variant angina, 18 with inactive variant angina without anginal attacks during the preceding 6 months, 39 with significant organic coronary artery stenoses but without rest angina and 34 control subjects without coronary artery disease. Lipid peroxidation products in <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein were assayed as thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances before and after incubation with various concentrations of Cu 2 +at 37 °C for 24 h. ResultsSignificantly higher levels of generation of thiobarbituric acid—reactive substances from plasma <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein after incubation with Cu 2 +were seen in patients with active variant angina than in patients in the other three groups. The dose-response curve of <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein peroxidation induced by Cu 2 +shifted to the left in this group as compared with the curve in the other three groups. The vitamin E (alphatocopherol) content of <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein fraction in these patients was significantly lower than that in the other groups. After ≥ 6 months of an angina-free period in five patients with active variant angina, thiobarbituric acid—reactive substances induced by 0. 5 μmol/liter Cu 2 +in <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein were significantly decreased and vitamin E content was significantly increased. ConclusionsThese results indicate that vitamin E-deficient plasma <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein in patients with active variant angina is highly susceptible to peroxidative modification...|$|R

MethodsReceptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cell ligand and osteoprotegerin were determined under oxidized <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein treatment of human osteoblast-like cells. The involvement of oxidative stress, of the extracellular signal regulated kinase {{and of the}} transcription factors nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells and nuclear factor of activated T cells was demonstrated. ResultsCu 2 +-oxidized <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein increased cell-associated and extracellular receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cell ligand levels whereas osteoprotegerin levels were not affected. The increase in receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cell ligand was parallel to the generation of reactive oxygen species provoked by Cu 2 +-oxidized <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein. The lipid extract of Cu 2 +-oxidized <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein, together with other forms of oxidized <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins such as smooth muscle cell-oxidized <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein and myeloperoxidase-oxidized <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein, also induced an increase in reactive oxygen species and cell-associated receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cell ligand. The effect of Cu 2 +-oxidized <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein was prevented by the antioxidant vitamin E, and mimicked by the prooxidant compounds hydrogen peroxide and buthionine sulfoximine. Inhibitors of mitogen activated protein kinase/extracellular signal regulated kinase (PD 98059), nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (Ro 106 - 9920) and nuclear factor of activated T cells (Vivit) reduced the effect of Cu 2 +-oxidized <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein on receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cell ligand expression. Cu 2 +-oxidized <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein signaling was also reduced by vitamin E. General significanceThis work describes a new molecular mechanism and elucidates the signaling pathway whereby oxidized <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein, by means of its lipid moiety, can modulate the crosstalk between osteoblasts/osteoclasts and bone remodeling, leading to an eventual risk of osteoporosis...|$|R
40|$|In a 2 x 2 {{factorial}} arrangement, miniature pigs {{were fed}} four diets containing vegetable protein and fat (soybean) and animal protein (egg white) and fat (beef tallow) {{to investigate the}} effects of protein and fat source on transport of cholesterol in the plasma, uptake of cholesterol from the plasma by tissues and distribution of cholesterol in tissues;Beef tallow consumption resulted in greater plasma cholesterol concentrations, decreased <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein-cholesterol concentrations and lower ratios of cholesterol to protein in <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein than did consumption of soybean oil. The ratio of high <b>density</b> lipoprotein-cholesterol to <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein-cholesterol was increased by beef tallow consumption. The percentage by weight of cholesterol in <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein was significantly greater in pigs consuming soybean oil than in pigs consuming beef tallow. Dietary protein source had no significant effect on plasma cholesterol concentration or on lipoprotein cholesterol. Dietary fat source had no consistent effect on removal of <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein from plasma whereas egg white consumption tended to decrease the fractional catabolic rate and irreversible loss of <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein-cholesterol and -protein when compared with consumption of soy protein;Soybean oil feeding, compared with beef tallow feeding, resulted in greater concentrations of cholesterol in aorta, heart and large and small intestines. Similar trends were seen in liver, adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. Dietary protein had no significant effect on tissue cholesterol concentrations. Uptake of intact <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein tended to be greater when soybean oil or soy protein was fed, compared with beef tallow or egg white. Net exchange of free cholesterol from <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein to tissues tended to be greater when the vegetable products were fed;Dietary protein and fat seemed to influence lipoprotein metabolism by different mechanisms: Fat source altered lipoprotein concentrations and <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein composition whereas protein source affected the removal rate of <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein from plasma. The association between soybean oil or soybean protein consumption and increased cholesterol concentration and greater uptake of intact <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein in some tissues may have implications {{for the development of}} atherosclerosis...|$|R
40|$|Hepatic lipase {{deficiency}} produces significant distortion in {{the plasma}} lipoprotein profile. Particles with reduced electrophoretic mobility appear in very <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein (VLDL). Intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) increases markedly in the circulation and plasma <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein (LDL) levels fall. At {{the same time}} there is a mass redistribution within the high density lipoprotein (HDL) spectrum leading to dominance in the less dense HDL 2 subfraction. The present study examines apolipoprotein B turnover in a patient with hepatic lipase deficiency. The metabolism of large and small very <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins was determined in four control subjects and compared to the pattern seen in the patient. Absence of the enzyme did not affect the rate at which large very <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins were converted to smaller particles within this density interval (i. e., of VLDL). However, subsequent transfer of small very <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins to intermediate density particles was retarded by 50 %, explaining the abnormal accumulation of VLDL in the patient's plasma. Despite this, intermediate density particles accumulated to a level 2. 4 -times normal because their subsequent conversion to <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein has been almost totally inhibited. Consequently, the plasma concentration of <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein was only 10 % of normal. On the basis of these observations, hepatic lipase appears to be essential for the conversion of small very <b>low</b> <b>density</b> and intermediate <b>density</b> particles to <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins. The pathways of direct plasma catabolism of these species were not affected by the enzyme defect. In vitro studies were performed by adding purified hepatic lipase to the patient's plasma.

The best way to use <b>low</b> <b>density</b> chips is to impute data to a more dense coverage such as the standard 50 K genotype. Two alternative in silico chips are presented and include markers selected to optimise Minor Allele Frequency and spacing. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare imputation accuracy of these custom <b>low</b> <b>density</b> chips with the commercially available 3 K chip. Three French dairy and beef breeds were studied: Holstein, Montbéliarde and Blonde d’Aquitaine with respectively 4, 037, 1, 219 and 991 50 K-genotypes. Markers were masked for the validation population in order to mimic a <b>low</b> <b>density</b> genotype. Imputation was realised with Beagle software. 95 % to 99 % of alleles were correctly imputed depending on the breed and the <b>low</b> <b>density</b> chip. Custom <b>low</b> <b>density</b> chip gave better results. The gain to use 6 K chip was found to be even higher for beef breeds such as Blonde d’Aquitaine. A <b>low</b> <b>density</b> chip with 6, 000 markers is a valuable genotyping tool that is suitable for both dairy and beef breeds.

40|$|Studies in cultured {{fibroblasts}} {{from patients}} with the clinical syndrome of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia have disclosed two different mutations affecting {{the functions of the}} <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein receptor. One of these mutations, described previously, results in a functionless receptor that does not bind <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins. In the cells of six patients who appear to be homozygous for this mutant allele, i. e., receptor-negative homozygotes, <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins neither suppress hydroxymethylgultaryl-CoA reductase (NADPH) [mevalonate:NADP+ oxidoreductase (CoA-acylating) EC 1. 1. 1. 34] activity nor stimulate cellular cholesterol esterification, even when examined in the presence of concentrations of lipoprotein 500 times higher than those cells. The second type of mutation, described herein, results in a receptor that has a reduced but not absent function. Fibroblasts from three subjects who possess this mutation, i. e., receptor-defective homozygotes, show partial suppression of the same enzyme activity and a detectable increase in cholesterol esterification capacity in the presence of high levels of <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoproteins. It was calculated that their degree of function could be achieved if they possessed only about 10 % of the normal binding of <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein. This level of binding was too low to be reliably detected by the 125 -I-labeled <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein binding assay. The finding of a second class of mutant cells in which a defect in <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein binding is associated with simultaneous defects in both suppression of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity and stimulation of cholesterol ester formation provides further evidence for the coordinate control of these two processes by the <b>low</b> <b>density</b> lipoprotein receptor...|$|R
