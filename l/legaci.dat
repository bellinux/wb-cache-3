5000|$|<b>Legaci</b> rose to fame {{through their}} YouTube channel with over 140 {{thousand}} subscribers and 23 million views. Their cover of Justin Bieber's smash hit [...] "Baby" [...] {{caught the attention}} of Bieber and his manager Scooter Braun, and landed <b>Legaci</b> the opportunity to tour the world with the teen sensation as his official backing group. Bieber reserved them a special a capella slot in each of his concerts for <b>Legaci</b> to showcase their talents. With Bieber they performed in over 30 countries and approximately 300 cities. As a social networking phenomenon, <b>Legaci</b> maintains over 45 thousand “likes” on Facebook and over 120 thousand combined followers on Twitter as of January 2013.|$|E
50|$|<b>Legaci</b> and Kamikaze Records parted ways late 2006. <b>Legaci</b> {{continued}} to perform {{and went back}} into the studio to start work on their next album, Sessions. With new member Delfin Lazaro, they pushed the Sessions EP in 2007, with plans to finish a full album in the future.|$|E
5000|$|The Land use, Economic development, Growth, Agriculture, Conservation, and Investment (<b>LEGACI)</b> {{grant program}} issued nearly $5,000,000 in grants to nonprofit groups, {{community}} organizations, {{and local governments}} in the Central Valley between 1999 and 2004. [...] The <b>LEGACI</b> program has since narrowed in focus to become the Citi Success Fund.|$|E
5000|$|Their {{cover of}} Bieber's song [...] "Baby" [...] with YouTube users Cathy Nguyen and Traphik, caught the {{attention}} of Bieber's music manager Scooter Braun. He contacted them the day after the video was posted, and sent <b>Legaci</b> to start rehearsing the very next week for the promotion run of Bieber's [...] "My World 2.0" [...] album. Since then, the band has performed with Bieber to 30 different countries around the world. Taking a break in the middle of each concert, Bieber introduced <b>Legaci</b> to sing their own mix of a cappella pop melodies.|$|E
5000|$|Formed in 1997, Legaci's {{original}} members {{consisted of}} Mathew Arcilla (guitar/vocals), Jason Atencion (vocals), John Daria (vocals), and Micah Tolentino (guitar/keyboard/vocals). The founding members of <b>Legaci</b> got {{together under the}} leadership of their late manager, Mike Viernes of Point Blank Entertainment. They performed cover songs and original pieces at various parties, talent shows, cultural events and competitions throughout California. In 2001, <b>Legaci</b> self-published and released their first CD single [...] "Make Sweet Love" [...] with an accompanying music video to promote themselves to their fans as well as potential music industry contacts. The group performed as the opening act for 107.9FM KDND's EndFest at Sacramento, California in 2001 {{as a result of their}} first-place victory in a local [...] "Battle of the Bands" [...] competition. They opened for artists such as LFO, Vertical Horizon, Uncle Kracker, Dream, 3LW, and Smash Mouth.|$|E
5000|$|In late 2007, <b>Legaci</b> {{turned to}} YouTube {{as a method}} of {{promotion}} to gain more of a fan base and attention. [...] Over the course of 2 years, their channel has accumulated over 1 million unique views and their videos have cumulatively reached over 12 million views, collaborating with several other rising Asian-American YouTube stars.|$|E
50|$|<b>Legaci</b> {{continued}} to perform seeing {{the departure of}} Mathew Arcilla, {{and the addition of}} Chris Abad, Jason Guison, and Chris Mamitag. They also worked on recording their first studio album. What started as an independent project soon changed when Kamikaze Records, a local independent label, picked them up in late 2003 and helped to push the release of their album, Little Black Book on March 14, 2006.|$|E
5000|$|After 2 {{years of}} being on the road with Bieber for the My World Tour, <b>Legaci</b> {{released}} their debut single entitled [...] "All Day" [...] on December 20, 2011, which was followed by the release of [...] "Never Got Over You" [...] on May 29, 2012. Their Driven EP was released on December 11, 2012. As of 2014 Driven has sold 43 million copies worldwide.|$|E
50|$|<b>Legaci</b> is a Filipino American R&B {{band from}} the San Francisco Bay Area, California. The current line-up {{consists}} of Micah Tolentino(keyboard, vocals), Jason Atencion, Chris Abad, and Del Lazaro (guitar/keyboard/vocals). Their dream {{was not only}} {{to succeed in the}} music industry, but to give Asian-Americans mainstream relevance. The band released their debut album Little Black Book in 2006 (under a different roster) and continued this momentum with release of Sessions-EP in 2008.|$|E
50|$|The Citi Success Fund, {{which is}} funded by Citibank, is {{a subset of the}} Land use, Economic development, Growth, Agriculture, Conservation, and Investment (<b>LEGACI)</b> grant program. The fund {{provides}} small cash grants to K-12 educators who develop programs which encourage at-risk students to stay in school. Only programs in certain subregions of the Central Valley are eligible and priority is given to programs which train students in financial literacy, teach them about career options, or help them search and apply for colleges.|$|E
40|$|Initial {{planetary}} explorations {{with the}} Apollo program had a veritable ground support army monitoring {{the safety and}} health of the 12 astronauts who performed lunar surface extravehicular activities (EVAs). Given the distances involved, {{this will not be}} possible on Mars. A spacesuit for Mars must be smart enough to replace that army. The next generation suits can do so using 2 software systems serving as virtual companions, <b>LEGACI</b> (Life support, Exploration Guidance Algorithm and Consumable Interrogator) and VIOLET (Voice Initiated Operator for Life support and Exploration Tracking). The system presented in this study integrates data inputs from a suite of sensors into the MIII suit s communications, avionics and informatics hardware for distribution to remote managers and data analysis. If successful, the system has application not only for Mars but for nearer term missions to the Moon, and the next generation suits used on ISS as well. Field tests are conducted to assess capabilities for next generation spacesuits at Johnson Space Center (JSC) as well as the Mars and Lunar analog (Devon Island, Canada). <b>LEGACI</b> integrates data inputs from a suite of noninvasive biosensors in the suit and the astronaut (heart rate, suit inlet/outlet lcg temperature and flowrate, suit outlet gas and dewpoint temperature, pCO 2, suit O 2 pressure, state vector (accelerometry) and others). In the Integrated Walkback Suit Tests held at NASA-JSC and the HMP tests at Devon Island, communication and informatics capabilities were tested (including routing by satellite from the suit at Devon Island to JSC in Houston via secure servers at VCU in Richmond, VA). Results. The input from all the sensors enable <b>LEGACI</b> to compute multiple independent assessments of metabolic rate, from which a "best" met rate is chosen based on statistical methods. This rate can compute detailed information about the suit, crew and EVA performance using test-derived algorithms. VIOLET gives <b>LEGACI</b> voice activation capability, allowing the crew to query the suit, and receive feedback and alerts that will lead to corrective action. <b>LEGACI</b> and VIOLET can also automatically control the astronaut's cooling and consumable use rate without crew input if desired. These findings suggest that non-invasive physiological and environmental sensors supported with data analysis can allow for more effective management of mission task performance during EVA. Integrated remote and local view of data metrics allow crewmember to receive real time feedback in synch with mission control in preventing performance shortcomings for EVA in exploration missions...|$|E
