60|$|<b>Look</b> <b>now</b> <b>at</b> {{this piece}} of fresh coral--for coral it is, though not like the coral which your sister wears in her necklace. You see {{it is full of}} pipes; in each of those pipes has lived what we will call, for the time being, a tiny sea-anemone, joined on to his {{brothers}} by some sort of flesh and skin; and all of them together have built up, out of the lime in the sea-water, this common house, or rather town, of lime.|$|E
60|$|<b>Look</b> <b>now</b> <b>at</b> {{the wondrous}} {{traditional}} {{story of how}} this island was settled by the red-men. Thus goes the legend. In olden times an eagle swooped down upon the New England coast and carried off an infant Indian in his talons. With loud lament the parents saw their child borne out of sight over the wide waters. They resolved {{to follow in the}} same direction. Setting out in their canoes, after a perilous passage they discovered the island, and there they found an empty ivory casket,-- the poor little Indian's skeleton.|$|E

60|$|If we <b>look</b> <b>now</b> <b>at</b> Paris, {{one thing}} is too evident: that the Baker's shops have got their Queues, or Tails; their long strings of purchasers, {{arranged}} in tail, so that the first come be the first served,--were the shop once open! This waiting in tail, {{not seen since the}} early days of July, again makes its appearance in August. In time, we shall see it perfected by practice to the rank almost of an art; and the art, or quasi-art, of standing in tail become one of the characteristics of the Parisian People, distinguishing them from all other Peoples whatsoever.|$|E

6000|$|Spoon in hand, I paused, <b>looking</b> <b>now</b> <b>at</b> Mrs Bowater and <b>now</b> <b>at</b> {{the coveted}} book. [...] "Mr Bowater," [...] she added from deep down in herself, [...] "followed the sea."

6000|$|... 'Ah, sweetest Empress! {{you forget}} {{sometimes}} that I, too, world-worm as I am, am a Greek, with as intense {{a love of}} the beautiful as even you yourself have. Do not fancy that every violation of correct taste does not torture me as keenly as it does you. Some day, I hope, you will have learned to pity and to excuse the wretched compromise between that which ought to be and that which can be, in which we hapless statesmen must struggle on, half-stunted, and wholly misunderstood--Ah, well! <b>Look,</b> <b>now,</b> <b>at</b> these fauns and dryads among the shrubs upon the stage, pausing in startled wonder at the first blast of music which proclaims the exit of the goddess from her temple.' ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{never left}} him all that night. As {{if she had}} done him a wrong which her {{tenderness}} could hardly repair, she sat by him in his sleep, at times softly kissing him with suspended breath, and calling him in a whisper by some endearing name. At times she stood aside {{so as not to}} intercept the low fire-light, and, watching him when it fell upon his sleeping face, wondered did he <b>look</b> <b>now</b> <b>at</b> all as he had looked when he was prosperous and happy; as he had so touched her by imagining that he might look once more in that awful time. At the thought of that time, she kneeled beside his bed again, and prayed, 'O spare his life! O save him to me! O look down upon my dear, long-suffering, unfortunate, much-changed, dear dear father!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, sheer communism, sir,' said Mr. Blenkinsopp, severely: 'sheer communism, I {{can tell}} you. Co-operation of workmen to rob their {{employers}} of profits; gross denunciation {{of capital and}} capitalists; and regular inciting of them against the Property of the landlords, by quoting Scripture, too, Doctor, by quoting the very words of Scripture. They say the devil can quote Scripture to his own destruction, don't they, Doctor? Well, he quoted {{something out of the}} Bible about woe unto them that join field to field, or words to that effect, to make themselves a solitude {{in the midst of the}} earth. Do you know, it strikes me that it's a very dangerous book, the Bible--in the hands of these socialistic demagogues, I mean. <b>Look</b> <b>now,</b> <b>at</b> that passage, and at what Mr. Le Breton said about Christian communism!' ...|$|E

6000|$|She paused, {{but if she}} had a {{habit of}} asking disconcerting {{questions}} she did not at any rate insist upon answers, and she went on to confess that she believed she would be a happier woman poor than rich--"not that Ben isn't all he should be"--but that then she would have been a fashionable dressmaker. [...] "People want help," [...] she said, [...] "so much more help than they get. They go about with themselves--what was it Mr. Radlett Barns said the other night--oh!--like people leading horses they daren't ride. I think he says such good things at times, don't you? So wonderful to be clever in two ways like that. Just <b>look</b> <b>now</b> <b>at</b> your wife--now I mean, that they've drawn that peacock-coloured curtain behind her.

60|$|<b>Look</b> <b>now</b> <b>at</b> Stubb; {{a man who}} {{from his}} humorous, {{deliberate}} coolness and equanimity in the direst emergencies, was specially qualified to excel in pitchpoling. Look at him; he stands upright in the tossed bow of the flying boat; wrapt in fleecy foam, the towing whale is forty feet ahead. Handling the long lance lightly, glancing twice or thrice along its length {{to see if it}} be exactly straight, Stubb whistlingly gathers up the coil of the warp in one hand, so as to secure its free end in his grasp, leaving the rest unobstructed. Then holding the lance full before his waistband's middle, he levels it at the whale; when, covering him with it, he steadily depresses the butt-end in his hand, thereby elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon his palm, fifteen feet in the air. He minds you somewhat of a juggler, balancing a long staff on his chin. Next moment with a rapid, nameless impulse, in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming distance, and quivers in the life spot of the whale. Instead of sparkling water, he now spouts red blood.|$|E
6000|$|... "The people I know well, Excellency, for I dwelt {{among them}} {{in past years}} and speak their language; {{and that is why}} I have left Granada to look after itself for a while, and am here to-day, to watch and make report----" [...] He checked himself, then added, [...] "As for the ceremony, were I a king I would have it otherwise. Why, in that house just now those vulgar Commons--for so they call them, do they not?--almost {{threatened}} their royal master when he humbly craved a tithe of the country's wealth to fight the country's war. Yes, and I saw him turn pale and tremble at the rough voices, as though their echoes shook his throne. I tell you, Excellency, that the time will come in this land when those Commons will be king. <b>Look</b> <b>now</b> <b>at</b> that fellow whom his Grace holds by the hand, calling him 'sir' and 'master,' and yet whom he knows to be, as I do, a heretic, a Jew in disguise, whose sins, if he had his rights, should be purged by fire. Why, to my knowledge last night, that Israelite said things against the Church----" ...|$|E
6000|$|For a {{long time}} they debated in voices so low that none could hear what they said, <b>looking</b> <b>now</b> <b>at</b> one and <b>now</b> <b>at</b> another of the parties to this strange suit. Also, some priest was called into their council, which Margaret thought a bad omen. At length they made up their minds, and in a low, quiet voice and {{measured}} words her Majesty, as Queen of Castile, gave the judgment of them all. Addressing herself first to Morella, she said: ...|$|R

60|$|Young Thomas {{expressed}} these sentiments sitting astride {{of a chair}} {{before the}} fire, with his arms on the back, and his sulky face on his arms.

6000|$|... 'It had need be sharp,' {{answered}} Otomie. 'My {{love has}} harmed none, see before you but one {{grain of the}} countless harvest of your own. In yonder chair Guatemoc your king was this day tortured by your master Cortes, who swore to treat him with all honour. By his side sat Teule, my husband and your friend; him Cortes gave over to has private enemy, de Garcia, whom you name Sarceda. See how he has left him. Nay, do not shudder, gentle lady; <b>look</b> <b>now</b> <b>at</b> his wounds! Consider to what a pass we are driven when you find us about to die thus like dogs, he, my husband, {{that he may not}} live to see me handled as he has been, and I with him, because a princess of the Otomie and of Montezuma's blood cannot submit to such a shame while death has one door through which to creep. It is but a single grain of your harvest, outcast and traitress, the harvest of misery and death that is stored yonder in the ruins of Tenoctitlan. Had I my will, I tell you that I had sooner die a score of times than take help from a hand so stained with the blood of my people and of yours--I--' ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Look,</b> <b>now,</b> <b>at</b> {{these tiny}} saucers of the {{thinnest}} ivory, the largest not {{bigger than a}} silver threepence, which contain in their centres a milk-white crust of stone, pierced, as you see under the magnifier, into a thousand cells, each with its living architect within. Here are two kinds: in one the tubular cells radiate from the centre, giving it {{the appearance of a}} tiny compound flower, daisy or groundsel; in the other they are crossed with waving grooves, giving the whole a peculiar fretted look, even more beautiful than that of the former species. They are Tubulipora patina and Tubulipora hispida; - and stay - break off that tiny rough red wart, and look at its cells also under the magnifier: it is Cellepora pumicosa; and now, with the Madrepore, you hold in your hand the principal, at least the commonest, British types of those famed coral insects, which in the tropics are the architects of continents, and the conquerors of the ocean surge. All the world, since the publication of Darwin's delightful [...] "Voyage of the Beagle,"' and of Williams' [...] "Missionary Enterprises," [...] knows, or ought to know, enough about them: for those who do not, there are a few pages in the beginning of Dr. Landsborough's [...] "British Zoophytes," [...] well worth perusal.|$|E
60|$|<b>Look</b> <b>now</b> <b>at</b> {{the fate}} of Cortes--that great man whom I have known clothed with power like a god. Nearly forty years ago, so I have heard, he died poor and disgraced in Spain; he, the conqueror--yes, and I have learned also that his son Don Martin has been put to the torture in that city which the father won with so great cruelties for Spain. Malinche, she whom the Spaniards named Marina, the chief and best beloved of all the women of this same Cortes, foretold it to him in her anguish when after all that had been, after she had so many times {{preserved}} him and his soldiers to look upon the sun, at the last he deserted her, giving her in marriage to Don Juan Xaramillo. Look again at {{the fate of}} Marina herself. Because she loved this man Cortes, or Malinche, as the Indians named him after her, she brought evil on her native land; for without her aid Tenoctitlan, or Mexico, {{as they call it}} now, had never bowed beneath the yoke of Spain--yes, she forgot her honour in her passion. And what was her reward, what right came to her of her wrongdoing? This was her reward at last: to be given away in marriage to another and a lesser man when her beauty waned, as a worn-out beast is sold to a poorer master.|$|E
30|$|Modelling our lack-of-knowledge about q in a Bayesian way [6, 10, 27] by {{replacing}} them with random variables (RVs), the problem becomes well-posed [26]. But of course one is <b>looking</b> <b>now</b> <b>at</b> the problem of finding a probability distribution that best fits the data; and one also obtains a probability distribution, not just one value q.

60|$|She {{stepped aside}} and knelt down before the {{crucifix}} to pray, and I stood by and <b>looked</b> <b>now</b> <b>at</b> her and <b>now</b> <b>at</b> {{the object of}} her adoration, <b>now</b> <b>at</b> the living figure of the penitent, and <b>now</b> <b>at</b> the ghastly, daubed countenance, the painted wounds, and the projected ribs of the image. The silence was only broken by the wailing of some large birds that circled sidelong, as if in surprise or alarm, about {{the summit of the}} hills. Presently Olalla rose again, turned towards me, raised her veil, and, still leaning with one hand on the shaft of the crucifix, looked upon me with a pale and sorrowful countenance.|$|R
