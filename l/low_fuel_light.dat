5000|$|The KB Centuras {{sold and}} {{assembled}} in Australia {{not only had}} a 1,981 cc version of the 4-cylinder Simca engine but were also available with Australian-made 6-cylinder pushrod 3,523/4,014 cc hemi engines and BorgWarner 3-speed automatic and 3- or 4-speed manual gearboxes. The four offered 122 hp (SAE), the sixes 142/167 hp (SAE) respectively. The KB series was sold in XL and GL trims, the latter having more equipment, including tachometer, clock, <b>low</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>light</b> (rare for 1975), rear bumper overriders, console (no storage) and optional vinyl roofs. There were no rear demister fitted, although a Smiths unit was fitted by some dealers. The KB model's European pedigree was obvious, with instrumentation in the opposite order and steering column controls on opposite sides. All KB GL spec cars came equipped with a tachometer, however it was optional on XL spec cars (whereas later KC cars only gained a tachometer through special order, {{or as part of}} the Sports option package) Interior flow ventilation was improved over the larger Valiant models, as the Centura had two face-level ventilation outlets. Although the A55 6 cylinder Centura Sports Package was fitted to some vehicles ( [...] included body stripes, styled wheels, woodgrain instrument cluster with tachometer, clock and Boca Raton cloth trim), it was common to see dealer fitted options including the styled road wheel option, and stencilled side stripes and bonnet black outs. The sixes also came with larger brakes (60 mm ventilated front discs and 25.4 mm rear finned drums) and a tandem brake reservoir. The six-cylinder Hemi cars used a 5-stud wheel bolt pattern, and the early 4-cylinder cars used a 4-stud wheel bolt pattern and only featured solid unventilated brake discs. Later 4-cylinder cars shared the same brakes and stud pattern as the 6 cylinder cars, and thus the same wheels. All Centura models were factory fitted with rack-and-pinion steering, however there was no power steering option. Steering could be heavy, so correct tyre fitment and pressures were a must. Factory / dealer fitted air, with the unit located below the heater controls was available but seldom optioned. Very few Centura's left the dealership with e33 engine code although a few examples do exist. One owned by a previous valiant production worker who ordered the option from new, it is now a sought after collectors item.|$|E

It is possible to purchase garages and setup branch offices across the United Kingdom to accommodate own growing truck fleet. The player can upgrade trucks and keep them in top condition for maximum efficiency such as fuel, and condition of the truck.

50|$|The FJ1200 {{features}} a standard 12 volt electrical system. The alternator and starter motor are mounted behind the cylinders. Nippondenso Transistor Controlled Ignition (TCI) {{is used in}} conjunction with two coils. Yamaha's self-cancelling indicator unit is used and a variable resistance gauging system is used to monitor engine oil contents with associated warning <b>lights.</b> A large <b>fuel</b> gauge is provided as is a <b>low</b> <b>fuel</b> level warning <b>light.</b> A digital clock is also fitted. A safety feature of the FJ1200 is that the engine ignition is cut if first gear is selected with the sidestand down, this is now commonplace on modern motorcycles.|$|R
50|$|Both the Classic 350 and the Classic 500 {{feature the}} new unit {{construction}} engine in their 350cc and 500cc variants respectively. However the Classic 350 uses a carburettor for fuel delivery and the Classic 500 has EFI. Also the Classic 350 has an ammeter while the Classic 500 has a <b>low</b> <b>fuel</b> indicator <b>light</b> and {{engine check light}} instead of the ammeter. The ammeter on the Classic 350 {{is more of a}} vestigial remain as the modern Classic 350 has no practical use for it. In the older models with CB points, when the piston was in the top dead centre (CB Points closed) then the ammeter would stay in the middle. This feature allowed the rider to use the decompresson lever to move the piston to top dead center and kick starter with relative ease. Both of these models are more expensive and targeted at a market segment above the Royal Enfield Bullet 350 and the Bullet 500.|$|R

2500|$|... 1977 saw the {{steering}} column repositioned [...] {{closer to the}} dashboard to allow a more [...] "arms out" [...] position for the driver. The custom interior with leather seat trim was now standard, with cloth and leather a no-cost option. A redesigned center console permitted universal Delco radio options. One consequence of this modification was that an 8-track tape player was now available as an option. Auxiliary gauges were restyled and the ammeter was replaced with a voltmeter. The sun visors were redesigned to swivel so as to provide some glare protection from the side {{as well as the}} front. Chevrolet responded to the criticism of the previous year’s steering wheel with an all new three-spoke leather-wrapped unit, which was well received. Chevrolet featured this new wheel prominently on the front of their new Corvette sales brochure. The new wheel came on all cars fitted with the optional tilt-telescopic steering column which was ordered on all but a few thousand Corvettes. Corvette's refinement as a touring sports car continued as both power steering and power brakes became standard and new options included body-colored sport mirrors, cruise control, and a new convenience group. Cruise control was only available on cars with automatic transmissions. The convenience group included dome light delay, headlight warning buzzer, underhood <b>light,</b> <b>low</b> <b>fuel</b> warning <b>light,</b> interior courtesy lights, and passenger side visor mirror. The black exterior paint color returned (last offered in 1969). Unchanged was the horsepower ratings for both base and L-82 engines. Early in production, the engine paint color was changed from Chevy orange to Corporate blue. The “Stingray” script, seen on front fenders since 1969 disappeared, but new cross-flags emblems began appearing on fenders before the model year ended. Windshield posts were now painted black for a “thin pillar” look and this was the final year of the [...] "sugar scoop" [...] tunneled roof-line and vertical back window. A Corvette milestone was reached during 1977 as Chevrolet had built a half million Corvettes since production began in 1953.|$|R
