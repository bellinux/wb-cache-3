There was the old Marquis de Guy, a roué, a degenerate, but still overbearing and full of personality, from whose lips came some of Graillot's most brilliant sayings; Louise, his wife; and Faraday, a friend of the old marquis, and obviously the intended lover of his wife.|$|R

Icelandic pop musician Björk makes use of disc-mechanism music boxes in the 2001 album Vespertine, with specially cut discs. London-based composer Richard Barrett has written a four-minute piece, 'trace', for two diatonic music boxes. French musician Colleen released Colleen et les Boîtes à Musique in 2006—an album composed and recorded using only music boxes. Electronica composer Aphex Twin created a piece called [...] "Nannou" [...] by sampling a music box. Austrian composer Karlheinz Essl wrote two pieces for punch-tape controlled music <b>box,</b> <b>Listen</b> Thing (2008) and Pandora's Secret (2009, with live-electronics). New Zealand electronica composer Rhian Sheehan uses music boxes as major instrumental and thematic devices, such as in 'Part 3' of his album Standing In Silence. Special edition pre-orders of the album came with a reproduction of the music box that played the main melody composed for the piece. Argentine composer Juan María Solare composed a series of pieces for music boxes in early 2015, a cycle Fairy Lullabies and Kate Crackernuts, based on a Scottish fairy tale.|$|R

Based on the Explanation above the researcher interested to analyzing the teaching learning activities of “English On Sky” English textbook for second year students published by Erlangga. In detail this study want to investigate (1) the teaching learning activities of reading, (2) the teaching learning activities of writing, (3) the teaching learning activities of listening, (4) the teaching learning activities of speaking. In analyzing the textbook, the writer used descriptive research design. The population in this study is the English Textbook for the second year students of Junior High school and the sample of this study is the language skills aspect of this book (reading, writing, listening, and speaking). The finding of this research shows that (1) the teaching learning activities of reading are reading the text, answering the question based on the text, choosing the right or wrong answer, reading and rearranging the sentences, labeling the parts of the story, matching the descriptions in the box the correct picture, and reading and deconstructing, (2) the teaching learning activities of writing are writing the question based on the pictures, answering the questions, completing the paragraph, writing a sentence following the pictures, arranging the following phrases or words to make good sentences, writing Yes / No question, making question with the underlined word(s) as the answer, making a dialogue with working in pair, matching and writing with pictures and words in the box, writing any funny experience, writing a word to be a sentence in the box, completing the table, and arranging the following phrase or word to make a good sentences, (3) the teaching learning activities of listening are listening and putting a tick (Ö) by the word, composing and practicing, listening and choosing, listening and completing the conversation with suitable words provided in the <b>box,</b> <b>listening</b> and answering the questions, listening to the conversation and completing the sentences, answering true and false question, looking at the pictures and listening the activities, labeling pictures, listening and practicing the models, matching and arranging the sentences or pictures in a good order based on the cassette, circling the word that the students hear, listening and retelling, and listening and repeating, (4) the teaching learning activities of speaking making a short conversations with working in pair, saying the words using pictures, circling the words with sound, practicing the models, completing and practicing the conversation, studying the conversation and answer the following question, telling story using pictures, and composing short conversation based on the pictures below, then practicing in pair...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. May 2014. Major: Rhetoric and Scientific and Technical Communication. Advisor: Lee-Ann Kastman Breuch. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xii, 297 pages, appendices A-G. This dissertation {{responds to the}} concerns rhetoric and composition teachers have with student interaction in online writing spaces. Specifically, the study conducted here {{is part of a}} recent conversation regarding the way students listen in online environments. This dissertation explores listening from a rhetorical perspective. Current frameworks for online interaction center largely on reducing three types of conflict: flaming, lurking, and low/non-participation. As a response to the challenge of how to proceed in light of these online conflicts, this dissertation offers "listening language" as one solution. Drawing upon the works of Wayne Booth, Sharon Crowley, Jacqueline Jones Royster, and Krista Ratcliffe, I argue that listening language becomes an approach to online interaction that students and teachers may use in three distinct online spaces: asynchronous discussion forums, virtual peer reviews, and a final narrative analysis assignment that is uploaded to a graded drop <b>box.</b> <b>Listening</b> approaches like the one I develop have the potential to transform the way individuals interact with each other from a position of mastery and argumentative superiority to one of mutual exploration and exchange. This dissertation is guided by the following research questions: Does exposure to pedagogy based on listening language a) change students' attitudes about the relationship between listening and writing and b) their online discourses? Are there differences between the online discourses of students who have been exposed to a pedagogy based on listening language and those who have not? If so, how can those differences be characterized? Taken together, these questions help researchers interesting in listening and online writing instruction understand some of the ways listening happens in online spaces. To assess the impact of a pedagogy based on the principles of listening language, I use a mixed methodology for data collection and analysis. This study was conducted on two sections of first-year writing at a large, mid-western research university during the Spring 2013 semester. I created a sequential design that begins with a quasi-experiment data collection process followed by rhetorical analysis of student texts generated through the duration of the study. This study also uses statistical analysis of an original pretest/posttest survey results that {{are a part of the}} quasi-experimental research design. Sentence-level and whole-paper rhetorical analysis were also conducted on student-written texts collected during this study. The findings suggest that listening language does impact student attitudes toward listening. Though there are differences between the written texts of students in treatment and control groups, neither group makes use of listening language's entrance and exit moves. This study also finds that hedging and qualifying are the most frequent ways students acknowledge troubles others may have with listening to their ideas. Moreover, students acknowledge troubles with listening most frequently during peer reviews rather than in discussion forums or the narrative analysis assignment...|$|R
