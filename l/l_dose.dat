Radio-opaque fluids were given and their destination determined by fluoroscopy and radiography. Fluids containing glucose and xylose were also given and plasma glucose and xylose concentrations measured. In at least 93 % of calves, the radio-opaque fluids entered the reticulum, indicating that the reticular groove did not close. Oral administration of sodium bicarbonate, copper sulfate and guanidine HCl did not influence groove closure in calves that received fluids through an esophageal feeder. As administration of the fluids continued, overflow to the abomasum occurred after about 400 mL had been given. When 2. 0 L of glucose and electrolyte solution was given by esophageal feeder, plasma glucose levels rose significantly (p less than 0. 01), showing that absorption had occurred.

30|$|Fms-related {{tyrosine}} kinase 3 ligand (Flt 3 L) stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of various blood cell progenitors, including T cells, B cells, NK cells and DCs (Drexler and Quentmeier, 2004). OVA specific mucosal and plasma immune responses were significantly induced by intranasal administration of OVA and plasmid encoded murine Flt 3 L {{in comparison with}} OVA alone, leaning to a Th 2 type (Kataoka et al., 2004). CD 4 + T cells from the spleen and CLNs were highly proliferative {{and higher levels of}} IL- 2 and IL- 4 production were significantly accumulated in mice adjuvanted with Flt 3 L. The numbers of CD 11 c+ DCs in the mucosal effector sites, such as NPs, NALT and SMG, were remarkably enhanced due to nasal application of the expression plasmid encoding the Flt 3 L gene. Nasal administration of OVA and plasmid encoding mouse Flt 3 L enhanced OVA-specific mucosal and plasma antibodies and elicited Th 2 immune response (Fukuiwa et al., 2008). Plasmacytoid DCs and CD 8 + DCs were activated and expanded in the presence of plasmid encoding Flt 3 L. Mice nasally immunized with OVA and adenovirus expressing murine Flt 3 L exhibited high levels of OVA-specific mucosal and plasma antibodies as well as hyper-proliferation of OVA-specific CD 4 + T cell and OVA-induced IFN-γ and IL- 4 production in NALT, CLN and spleen (Sekine et al., 2008). OVA-specific CTL response was also enhanced in the spleen and CLN, and the number of CD 11 b+CD 11 c+ DCs expressing high levels of costimulatory molecules was preferentially increased in NALT, which migrated to mucosal effector lymphoid tissues.

40|$|In Section I, a model {{combining}} algal mortality due to selective zooplankton grazing {{with the}} Monod model of phytoplankton growth {{was used to}} predict phytoplankton species composition along a gradient of phosphorus (P) concentration and zooplankton grazing pressure. Model predictions were compared {{to the results of}} a mesocosm experiment of phytoplankton species composition along a range of P concentrations of 5 to 115 ug/l and potential grazing loss rates of 0. 001 to 0. 27 per day. The effect of the P gradient was measured by monitoring phytoplankton and zooplankton species composition and biomass, and physical and chemical parameters for 7 wk in 12 fiberglass tanks (5500 L) filled with lake water and associated plankton. P concentrations were manipulated so that the tanks were evenly distributed along the gradient. ^ Using laboratory derived Monod growth constants for P and literature values of phytoplankton selectivity coefficients, zooplankton filtering rates, and zooplankton assimilation efficiencies, the model predicted (1) the existence of three alternate states, (2) breakpoints between the alternate states which are similar to the P concentrations defining Vollenweider 2 ̆ 7 s lake trophic states, and (3) that phytoplankton species composition along the P gradient is dependent on a trade-off between a species ability to compete for P and their susceptibility to zooplankton grazing. Results from the mesocosm study generally supported these predictions and suggest that (1) the trade-off between competitive ability for P and edibility is a primary factor structuring phytoplankton communities, (2) multiple states exist along an environmentally realistic P gradient, and (3) these multiple states are consistent with the long-standing P-based lake trophic classification. ^ In Section II, the effects of a reduction in total-P concentration on the water quality and plankton community structure in a 86 -ha hypereutrophic sandpit lake with high internal P loading were assessed by dosing an isolated 4. 6 -ha section of the lake with 34, 065 <b>L</b> (<b>dose</b> = 10 mg Al.

40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid in critically ill patients. Methods: In this observational pharmacokinetic study, multiple blood samples were taken over one dosing interval of intravenous amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (1000 / 200 mg). Blood samples were analysed using a validated ultra HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry technique. Population pharmacokinetic analysis and dosing simulations were performed using non-linear mixed-effects modelling. Results: One-hundred-and-four blood samples were collected from 13 patients. For both amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, a two-compartment model with between-subject variability for both the clearance and the volume of distribution of the central compartment described the data adequately. For both compounds, 24 h urinary creatinine clearance was supported as a descriptor of drug clearance. The mean clearance of amoxicillin was 10. 0 L/h and the mean volume of distribution was 27. 4 L. For clavulanic acid, the mean clearance was 6. 8 L/h and the mean volume of distribution was 19. 2 <b>L.</b> <b>Dosing</b> simulations for amoxicillin supported the use of standard dosing regimens (30 min infusion of 1 g four-times daily or 2 g three-times daily) for most patients when using a target MIC of 8 mg/L and a pharmacodynamic target of 50 % fT(>MIC), except for those with a creatinine clearance > 190 mL/min. Dosing simulations for clavulanic acid showed little accumulation when high doses were administered to patients with high creatinine clearance. Conclusions: Although vast pharmacokinetic variability exists for both amoxicillin and clavulanic acid in intensive care unit patients, current dosing regiments are appropriate for most patients, except those with very high creatinine clearance...|$|R
40|$|Background Most {{methods of}} {{assessing}} colonic motility are poorly acceptable to patients. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can monitor gastrointestinal motility and fluid distributions. We predicted that {{a dose of}} oral polyethylene glycol (PEG) and electrolyte solution would increase ileo-colonic inflow and stimulate colonic motility. We aimed to investigate the colonic response to distension by oral PEG electrolyte in healthy volunteers (HVs) and to evaluate the effect of single 2 L vs split (2 × 1 <b>L)</b> <b>dosing.</b> Methods Twelve HVs received a split <b>dose</b> (1 <b>L</b> the evening before and 1 L on the study day) and another 12 HVs a single <b>dose</b> (2 <b>L</b> on the main study day) of PEG electrolyte. They underwent MRI scans, completed symptom questionnaires, and provided stool samples. Outcomes included small bowel water content, ascending colon motility index, and regional colonic volumes. Key Results Small bowel water content increased fourfold from baseline after ingesting both split (p = 0. 0010) and single dose (p = 0. 0005). The total colonic volume increase from baseline was smaller for the split dose at 35 ± 8 % than for the single dose at 102 ± 27 %, p = 0. 0332. The ascending colon motility index after treatment was twofold higher for the single dose group (p = 0. 0103). Conclusions & Inferences Ingestion of 1 and 2 L PEG electrolyte solution caused a rapid increase in the small bowel and colonic volumes and a robust rise in colonic motility. The increase in both volumes and motility was dose dependent. Such a challenge, being well-tolerated, could be a useful way of assessing colonic motility in future studies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In vivo {{administration}} of soluble Flt 3 L increases dendritic cell (DC) numbers to favor im-proved DC targeting of vaccine antigens, augment-ing vaccine efficiency. In addition to confirming {{the effectiveness of}} human Flt 3 L in macaques, we strove to determine the optimal regimen to elevate numbers of functional DCs. Circulating DCs were identified within lineage–human leukocyte antigen-DR cells, which comprised CD 11 c–CD 123 plas-macytoid DCs (PDCs) and CD 123 – cells including CD 11 cCD 123 – myeloid DCs as well as CD 11 c– CD 123 – cells. Traditionally, DCs have been mon-itored 1 – 2 days after 10 - to 14 -day treatments with Flt 3 L (100 g/kg/day). We demonstrate that al-though standard treatment increased macaque DC percentages, as little as 5 – 7 days of treatment was sufficient, if not more effective at mobilizing DCs. Moreover, DC frequency continued to escalate over the ensuing days, peaking at 4 days post 7 days of treatment and ultimately decreasing there-after. As expected, there was a more pronounced increase in the percentages and actual numbers of CD 123 – cells (CD 11 c and CD 11 c – subsets) com-pared with PDCs. Flt 3 L-mobilized DCs exhibited slightly increased CD 80 /CD 86 expression but typ-ically still that of immature DCs and were resilient to freeze-thawing. Overnight culture activated the cells, up-regulating CD 80 /CD 86 expression as well as interleukin- 12 release, typically being boosted by CD 40 L. This was even more apparent for en-riched DC cultures. These data verify that peak mobilization {{of large numbers of}} functional ma-caque DCs occurs a few days, not immediately, after short-term Flt 3 <b>L</b> <b>dosing.</b> This has important implications for improved DC-targeting vaccine strategies to prevent infection with human immu-nodeficiency virus and other pathogens.

40|$|Lantana camara L. is {{a widely}} {{distributed}} plant on tropics region belonging to the Family Verbenaceae. In Indonesia, the plant is used in traditional medicines of edema and rheumatisms. The aims of this research were to compare saponins, flavonoids, and essential oils constituents among the roots, the leaves, and the fruits and to know about anti-inflammatory effects of ethanolic extracts of L. camara on white male rats. The framework of the research was that the saponins, flavonoids, and essential oils constituents of L. camara have an anti-inflammatory effect. Organs with the highest constituents of saponins, flavonoids and essential oils would expect giving optimal anti-inflammatory effects. Complete Randomized Design with five treatment groups, each of the treatment had five repetitions, {{was used in this}} study. Each group have been treated: Group I CMC 0. 5 % control (placebo), Group II positive control (Na-diclofenac), Group III, IV and V giving ethanolic extracts of <b>L.</b> camara <b>dose</b> 720, 1080 and 1440 mg/kg BW, respectively. The inflammation was produced by sub plantar injection of carrageenan suspension in the right hind paw of the rats.

40|$|AIMS [...] To {{determine}} {{the changes in}} serum zinc concentration {{and the extent of}} urinary zinc excretion in patients with iron overload receiving the oral iron chelator 1, 2 -dimethyl- 3 -hydroxypyrid- 4 -one (L 1) or desferrioxamine (DFX), and to correlate these results with blood glucose concentration. METHODS [...] Serum zinc and ferritin concentrations, urinary zinc and iron excretion were regularly assayed in 39 patients and the glucose tolerance test (GTT) was performed in each patient. Patients were segregated according to their GTT into normal, diabetic, and those with an abnormal GTT. The mean of L 1 - or DFX associated urinary zinc excretion for each group was determined and compared with the other two groups and with normal value. L 1 associated urinary zinc excretion was also compared with <b>L</b> 1 <b>dose,</b> serum ferritin values, and urinary iron excretion. RESULTS [...] Both DFX and L 1 were associated with a significantly increased urinary zinc excretion (15. 1 (7. 3) mumol/ 24 hours, 11. 1 (6. 0) mumol/ 24 hours, respectively) compared with normal subjects. In patients receiving DFX this increase only occurred in patients with diabetes mellitus. Both diabetic and non-diabetic patients receiving L 1 treatment excreted more zinc than normal. Diabetic patients receiving L 1 or DFX excreted more zinc than non-diabetics receiving the same treatment. No correlation was found between urinary zinc excretion and <b>L</b> 1 <b>dose</b> or patients' serum ferritin concentrations. In seven patients receiving long term L 1 treatment a fall in serum zinc was observed from an initial 13. 6 (1. 6) mumol/l to a final 9. 6 (0. 8) mumol/l. In one patient this was associated with symptoms of dry skin and itchy skin patches requiring treatment with oral zinc sulphate. CONCLUSIONS [...] In contrast to DFX, L 1 treatment is associated with increased zinc loss. This, however, is modest and does not lead in most patients to subnormal serum zinc concentrations. In a few patients whose negative zinc balance may give rise to symptoms, zinc supplementation rapidly corrects the deficit...|$|R
