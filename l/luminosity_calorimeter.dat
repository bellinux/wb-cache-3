40|$|One {{proposed}} {{technology for}} the <b>luminosity</b> <b>calorimeter</b> in the detector of the fu-ture TESLA linear collider is a homogeneous crystal calorimeter with longitudinal segmentation and ber readout. The <b>luminosity</b> <b>calorimeter</b> located in the forward region of the detector near the beam pipe will be aected by a high radiation dose. Therefore the material of the calorimeter and the readout bers must have a high radiation hardness. The material should be as dense as possible, to have a lower Moliere radius. The scintillation light from a relatively small piece of scintillator has to be cou-pled into a ber with a reasonable light yield. The worsening of the time resolution should be reasonable. Since most crystals create isotropic light through scintillation, in heavy crystals there is light from Cerenkov radiation. The possibility to couple the directed light from Cerenkov radiation into bers is studied. The scintillation process in the material must be fast to avoid negative eects on the time resolution of the calorimeter. Materials must be found that fulll these requirements. Several Measurement are presented concerning the absolute light yield, light yield reduction due to the ber readout and also the time resolution of dierent materials and readout methods. In the proposed calorimeter design potential crosstalk between the several seg-ments of the calorimeter and between the segments and the read out bers could be a problem. Measurements were done to investigate if there is crosstalk between readout bers crossing a scintillating segment...|$|E
40|$|The International Linear Collider (ILC) is a {{proposed}} electron-positron collider with a center-of-mass energy of 500 GeV, and a peak luminosity of 2 · 10 ^ 34 cm^- 2 s^- 1. The ILC will complement the Large Hadron Collider, a proton-proton accelerator, and provide precision measurements, which may help in solving {{some of the}} fundamental questions at the frontier of scientific research, such as the origin of mass and the possible existence of new principles of nature. The linear collider community has set a goal to achieve a precision of 10 ^- 4 on the luminosity measurement at the ILC. This may be accomplished by constructing a finely granulated calorimeter, which will measure Bhabha scattering at small angles. The Bhabha cross-section is theoretically known to great precision, yet the rate of Bhabha scattering events, which would be measured by the luminosity detector, will be influenced by beam-beam effects, and by the inherent energy spread of the collider. The electroweak radiative effects can be calculated to high precision and partially checked with events with final state photon radiation by distinguishing between the observable energy deposits of electrons and of photons in the <b>luminosity</b> <b>calorimeter,</b> using a clustering algorithm. In order to achieve the design goal, the geometrical parameters of the calorimeter need to be reevaluated. This must {{be done in a}} generalized manner, so as to facilitate future modifications, the need for which is foreseen, due to expected changes in the detector concept.

40|$|A {{first study}} of single diffractive central high-p{sub T} dijet events in p{bar p} {{collisions}} at center-of-mass energy {radical}s = 1. 96 TeV is presented, using data {{recorded by the}} D 0 detector at the Tevatron during RunIIa in 2002 - 2004. The total integrated luminosity corresponding to the data sample is 398 pb{sup - 1 }. A diffractive sample is selected using a rapidity gap approach. A precise definition of the rapidity gap constitutes {{the first part of}} the thesis. The rapidity gap is defined by means of two parts of the D 0 detector [...] <b>luminosity</b> detectors and <b>calorimeter.</b> <b>Luminosity</b> detectors serve as a basic indicators of diffractive candidates and the calorimeter is used to confirm the low energy activity in the forward region (a rapidity gap). Presented studies of energy deposited in forward part of calorimeter by various types of events yield two rapidity gap definitions. Both of them use a fixed rapidity interval in calorimeter |{eta}| {element_of} [2. 6, 5. 2] and introduce an upper limit on the energy deposited in this region. First definition, which corresponds to the lowest systematical errors, uses a limit of 10 GeV, an energy limit in the second definition is set to 3 GeV. This alternative definition corresponds to the lowest contamination of diffractive sample by non-diffractive events, on the other hand it is accompanied with rejection of high percentage of diffractive candidates. Using the gap definition dijet diffractive data are then selected and compared to inclusive dijet events in various distributions. The main focus is to measure the difference in azimuthal angles between two leading jets in events with at least two high p{sub t} central jets. This variable is sensitive to the dynamics of the process. Indeed, the results show the different behavior of {Delta}{phi} distributions between the inclusive and diffractive samples. It is also shown that this difference is bigger for lower p{sub T} jets. Other distributions presented in the thesis show that most of the properties are the same for inclusive and diffractive events. The only observed difference is in the transversal properties of the jets, which could be explained as that diffractive jets are narrower than inclusive ones. Results are compared to Monte Carlo Pomwig (for diffractive sample) and Herwig (for inclusive sample); both show a good agreement with the data...|$|R
