50|$|Kerry is an unincorporated {{community}} in Columbia County, Oregon, United States, located about 30 {{miles east of}} Astoria. It was founded to extend the Columbia & Nehalem River Railroad and named in 1912 by <b>lumberman</b> Albert <b>S.</b> Kerry. In the 1920s it had about 200 inhabitants. Its post office opened in 1917 and closed in 1938.|$|R
50|$|The {{district}} {{contains a}} {{high concentration of}} mostly early twentieth-century dwellings built by prominent local <b>lumberman</b> Charles <b>S.</b> Belford. Of the 81 structures within the district's confines, 70 are classified as contributing and add to the historic character of the area. The district provides a cross-section of Belford's career in the construction business, and a wide variety of styles and types of residences can be found, such as L- and modified L-plan houses, small bungalows, Prairie-style homes, and Belford's own Queen Anne residence. The neighborhood has long been an area where many of Georgetown's leading citizens, such as former mayor Marsh F. Smith and Judge Cooper Sansom, have lived.|$|R
30|$|We {{assumed that}} {{diameter}} on tally trees {{is measured in}} two directions. Here we tested two subsample tree selection strategies. In the first one (fixed strategy or <b>S</b> 1), <b>tally</b> trees with d 1.3 [*]>[*] 25  cm were measured as subsample trees, along with all tally trees closer than 1  m to the plot center. The assumption here is that large trees are more important subsample trees than small trees, as they contribute more to the plot volume and the variance of their volume estimates is {{higher than that of}} small trees (see discussion below). In the second strategy (relascope strategy or S 2) the subsample trees were selected using a relascope factor 5  m 2 /ha, also assuming that large trees are more important than small trees. We assumed that the volume of the subsample trees could be measured error free (in fact there is error but it is assumed negligible), while for tally trees we assumed an error.|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change is}} an uneasy topic. Good news is welcome. For those {{lucky enough to}} live well in Manhattan, it 2 ̆ 7 s comforting to imagine that {{at least as far}} as carbon is concerned, the borough 2 ̆ 7 s density is right and good. Sure, the streets of midtown are clogged with cars. But walking, subways, and tall {{buildings}} with their cozy apartments and offices—all are exemplars of energy efficiency. Low-carbon virtuous, by default. This is the story told by the New Yorker writer David Owen in his classic essay 2 ̆ 2 Green Manhattan. 2 ̆ 2 It 2 ̆ 7 s the story that 2 ̆ 7 s been repeated a thousand more times by Michael Bloomberg. But the story is incomplete. And the implications are global. Manhattan isn 2 ̆ 7 t a snow globe, and neither is New York City. It just pretends to be one in its annual carbon-accounting reports, the city 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> official <b>tallies</b> of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming and of those gases 2 ̆ 7 attribution to local activities. The unfortunate norm, which New York follows, is to use a method that ignores the emissions caused by growing and raising the city 2 ̆ 7 s food, ignores the carbon emitted to power the factories that assemble New Yorker 2 ̆ 7 s smart phones and weave their clothes, and ignores the fumes spewed by planes that ferry New Yorkers around the world...|$|R
40|$|Cambridge University Press 2013. “Is {{there any}} point {{to which you}} would wish to draw my attention?” “To the curious {{incident}} of the dog in the night-time. ” “The dog did nothing in the night-time. ” “That was the curious incident,” remarked Sherlock Holmes. – Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Silver Blaze INTRODUCTION: Postwar constitutionalism in Japan can be likened {{to the story of}} the dog that did not bark: the absence of the most routine forms of constitutional change is a source of mystery. Since its promulgation in 1947, the Nihonkoku Kenpō has yet to be amended even once, a record unmatched by any other constitution currently in force (Elkins et al. 2009 : 180). (By way of comparison, the average national constitution lasts only nineteen years before it is replaced [129], to say nothing of how frequently it is amended. Germany alone has amended its postwar constitution more than fifty times.) Nor would it seem that judicial lawmaking has supplanted formal amendment. The Supreme Court of Japan almost never strikes down laws on constitutional grounds: since its establishment in 1947, it has done so just eight times. (Germany's constitutional court, created at roughly the same time, has struck down more than 600 laws; the U. <b>S.</b> Supreme Court's <b>tally</b> over the same period is roughly 900.)

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effects of an intergenerational program on {{children}} 2 ̆ 7 s learning outcomes and behaviours and on teachers 2 ̆ 7 attitudes towards the use of seniors as volunteers in schools. To measure learning outcomes, 41 children 2 ̆ 7 s curriculum test scores from two junior division classrooms were compared to 45 children 2 ̆ 7 s test scores from two different classrooms. To measure children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> behaviour, a <b>tally</b> adapted from the BDRS was used to compare four different types of behaviour when seniors were present and when teachers were present. The four behaviours measured were disruptiveness, needing attention, inattentiveness, and distractiveness. Six teachers were involved in the study. Their attitudes towards using seniors as volunteers in schools were measured using a 6 point Likert scale and open ended questions. Curriculum results indicated that there were no significant differences in test scores between the two groups of children. Significant results were found for three behaviours when comparing the children with teachers and with seniors present. The three behaviours were disruptiveness, needing attention, and inattentiveness. Results of the teachers 2 ̆ 7 questionnaire indicated that they all had positive attitudes towards having seniors volunteer in the school. More research is needed to examine the effects of these programs on children 2 ̆ 7 s learning outcomes and behaviours.
