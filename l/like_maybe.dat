500|$|For me, in my {{mind the}} {{accomplishment}} is just that much sweeter. In terms of my ethnicity, always feeling like an outsider, always feeling different ... for me it's about saying, 'Thank you Lord, for giving me the faith to believe in myself when other people had written me off.' I've gone through enough of my life worrying {{about that kind of}} thing. I want to encourage anyone else out there who feels <b>like</b> <b>maybe</b> they can't overcome an obstacle, I feel like I'm living proof ... never lose your faith. I'm seriously a grateful individual right now.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Time Magazine listed it as {{the worst}} comic of 2003, {{although}} the list's composer later stated [...] "he didn't actually mean {{it was the worst}} comic of the year." [...] UGO's Darren Latta noted as a downside to the series that [...] "the approach maybe a little too subdued at times." [...] Latta also felt that despite being familiar with the setting, Gaiman never utilized the period to its full potential. Others simply felt that Gaiman's involvement led to inflated expectations; one review noted that while reading [...] "I [...] felt at times <b>like</b> <b>maybe</b> it was all a little bit too cute, a little bit too in-jokey." ...|$|E
500|$|Although the survivors' {{experiences}} after Rosewood were disparate, none publicly acknowledged {{what had}} happened. Robie Mortin, Sam Carter's niece, {{was seven years}} old when her father put her on a train to Chiefland, [...] east of Rosewood, on January 3, 1923. Mortin's father avoided the heart of Rosewood {{on the way to the}} depot that day, a decision Mortin believes saved their lives. Mortin's father met them years later in Riviera Beach, in South Florida. None of the family ever spoke about the events in Rosewood, on order from Mortin's grandmother: [...] "She felt <b>like</b> <b>maybe</b> if somebody knew where we came from, they might come at us".|$|E

500|$|Maisie Williams {{also spoke}} with Entertainment Weekly and {{described}} the process behind Arya's scenes, saying [...] "We wanted people to think {{this could be the}} end, or the start of the end. <b>Like</b> <b>maybe</b> her wound is going to fester – like The Hound. We did so many different takes of emerging out of the water the first time she's stabbed and sliced. I had been to a music festival so I hadn't slept the whole weekend. Then I was jumping in the Irish sea. It was a totally manic day. We did a million different takes. We wanted it to be real frantic and panicked. Arya hasn't been emotional in a long time and we wanted to bring that emotion." ...|$|E
500|$|In an interview, Maisie Williams {{described}} the thought process behind Arya's scenes, {{as well as}} the process of filming saying [...] "We wanted people to think this could be the end, or the start of the end. <b>Like</b> <b>maybe</b> her wound is going to fester – like The Hound." [...] She continued, [...] "There was this constant spectrum of conversation with Mark Mylod during the chase of about how petrified she needs to look, but also how safe she is. Arya's been very lucky with the people she's encountered so far. The whole time she was with The Hound she took a back seat because he was really good. So I wanted her to look like she was struggling." [...] Williams also stated that she gave input on how the scene should take place, stating [...] "I didn't want the chase stunt to be unnecessary or superhuman. I got on set {{and they were going to}} have Arya rolling around, and diving, and I was like, [...] "That looks amazing, but no." [...] I'd be like, [...] "Why would she run over there? She'd just duck under here and just get out." [...] It doesn’t look quite as cinematic, maybe, but they'll have to find something else if they want cinematic. And I felt awful because the job of the stunt guys is to make everything look as crazy and cool as possible. But I know Arya now. In the beginning it was a lot of guesswork and now I've figured her out." ...|$|E

[...] On June 25, 2015, Reed announced on social media that production of Ant-Man was officially complete. In early July 2015, an international teaser trailer revealed that Anthony Mackie would appear in the film as Sam Wilson / Falcon. Mackie appears in the post-credit sequence as well, along with Chris Evans and Sebastian Stan as Steve Rogers / Captain America and Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier, respectively. Stan stated the scene that was used for the post-credit sequence was shot in May 2015, and would appear in the middle of Civil War. Also in the month, Reed revealed that the quantum realm in the film was the MCU's version of the microverse, which could not be called that due to legal reasons. The alternate name was suggested by consultant Spiros Michalakis, a quantum physicist and staff researcher at the California Institute of Technology, to [...] "inject elements of modern physics into the script". Reed also said that the end of the film originally had a sequence where Ant-Man went after Carson to retrieve the stolen vial of Cross' particles, [...] "...But then for a couple reasons, it felt <b>like</b> <b>maybe</b> we should leave those particles out there." [...] For the title sequences, Marvel again went with design firm Sarofsky, who had done the credits for both Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy, with the credits [...] "intricately connected to the film's overall narrative." ...|$|E
