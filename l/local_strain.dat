500|$|Eastern Kentucky {{is known}} for its gaited breeds, created through a mixture of Spanish horses from the {{southern}} United States and English horses from the North. American Saddlebreds, Tennessee Walking Horses and Missouri Fox Trotters also originated in the same general geographic area, from the same mixing of Spanish and English blood. Rocky Mountain Horses have a similar history to the Kentucky Mountain Saddle Horse, and together are sometimes called [...] "Mountain Pleasure Horses". The Rocky Mountain Horse originated in eastern Kentucky from a foundation stallion brought to the Appalachian Mountains from the Rocky Mountains around 1890. Brought to the area as a colt, oral histories state that the [...] "Rocky Mountain Horse", as he was known, possessed the preferred chocolate color and flaxen mane and tail found in the breed today, as well as the single-foot gait. He was used to breed local saddle mares, and due to the small area in which he was bred, a <b>local</b> <b>strain</b> of horse originated.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Med. Sc.) -University of Natal, Durban, 1998. Two {{areas of}} the HTLV-I genome were {{targeted}} for an in-house molecular diagnostic test, namely the pol and env regions. The pol primers proved the most sensitive (100 %) and specific (100 %). Amplification using the env primer pair was not reproducible, and was not pursued further. The AmpliSensor assay (Acugen Systems, Lowell, MA) was also tested. The assay was very specific, but not as sensitive as our in-house PCR. To investigate the predominant HTLV-I subtype in the region, a 1535 by env gene was isolated from peripheral blood obtained from five local HTLV-I seropositive patients. Four of the patients presented with HAM/TSP, and the fifth presented with a skin disease. Nucleotide sequencing of the amplified products revealed the <b>local</b> <b>strains</b> to be very conserved, differing by 0. 1 % to 0. 9 % among themselves. No apparent difference was noted for the two clinical manifestations. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using repesentative strains from around the world.

40|$|Biological {{methods have}} gained {{attention}} {{as an alternative}} treatment for oil degradation in pollution remediation. External and internal factors have a great influence on crude oil biodegradation. This experiment studied the effect of oil concentrations and ratios of Ammonium and Phosphate on oil degradation in mixed cultures of <b>local</b> <b>strains</b> of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Arthrobacter simplex. The oil degradation ability of this mixed culture was compared to the dormant culture of Epyzim. The increase of oil concentration, from 1, 3, 5 and 10 % (w/v), significantly lowered the ability of both cultures to degrade the oil i. e from 83 % for 1 % oil concentration to 64 % for 10 % oil concentration using <b>local</b> <b>strains.</b> The <b>local</b> <b>strains</b> showed better capability compare to the dormant culture. Medium composition was designed by three levels of ammonium concentration (7. 6, 37. 9 and 75. 8 mg l- 1) and two levels of phosphate concentration (2. 0 and 9. 9 mg l- 1). The ratio of ammonium to phosphate of 3. 8 : 1. 0 in the growth media has resulted the maximum level of oil degradation, i. e 83 % and 88 %, for dormant and local cultures respectively. The results suggest a potential usage of local microorganisms in degrading crude oil-polluted water...|$|R

5000|$|Only a {{very small}} amount of carbon can be {{dissolved}} in ferrite; the maximum solubility is about 0.02 wt% at 723 C and 0.001% carbon at 0 C. This is because carbon dissolves in iron interstitially, with the carbon atoms being about twice {{the diameter of the}} interstitial [...] "holes", so that each carbon atom is surrounded by a strong <b>local</b> <b>strain</b> field. Hence the enthalpy of mixing is positive (unfavourable), but the contribution of entropy to the free energy of solution stabilises the structure at low carbon content. 723 C also is the minimum temperature at which iron-carbon austenite (0.8 wt% C) is stable; at this temperature there is a eutectoid reaction between ferrite, austenite and cementite.|$|E
40|$|This work {{examined}} the mechanical properties of single bovine trabeculae and cortical bone tissue experimentally. In particular, microdamage and <b>local</b> <b>strains</b> were assessed for bovine bone tissue. A three-point bending experimental setup was designed capable of measuring <b>local</b> <b>strains</b> {{at the surface}} of such small specimens, using the digital image correlation technique. Microdamage formation and propagation were detected using the bone whitening effect, an optical non-invasive technique. This technique enabled to follow the progression of <b>local</b> <b>strains</b> and microdamage in real-time from which <b>local</b> <b>strains</b> at microdamage initiation and failure could be derived. This technique was used to investigate three fundamental aspects of bone mechanics. The first study {{examined the}} strain rate sensitivity of single bovine trabeculae. No linear relationship was observed between the strain rate and the Young’s modulus, the amount of microdamage, the maximum tensile strain at failure and at microdamage initiation. The second study compared the mechanical behaviour of single bovine trabeculae and similarly sized cortical bone samples. Cortical bone tissue exhibited significantly lower maximum strains and less accumulated damage at failure. However, no significant difference was detected for the maximum strain at microdamage initiation. Finally, the anisotropy of bovine cortical bone tissue was investigated. No {{significant difference was found}} between the Young’s modulus, the amount of microdamage and failure strains of longitudinal and tangential bone samples. However, these parameters were significantly lower for the radial samples. For strains at whitening onset, no significant difference was seen for the longitudinal and radial groups, whereas the tangential values were significantly greater. The insights gained from this work enhanced our understanding of the damage properties of bovine bone at the microstructural level. Future work is required to investigate the relevance of the above findings to human bone tissue. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

50|$|Modern sugar beets {{date back}} to mid-18th century Silesia where the king of Prussia subsidised {{experiments}} aimed at processes for sugar extraction. In 1747 Andreas Marggraf isolated sugar from beetroots and found them at concentrations of 1.3-1.6%. He also demonstrated that sugar could be extracted from beets that was identical with sugar produced from sugarcane. His student, Franz Karl Achard, evaluated 23 varieties of mangelwurzel for sugar content and selected a <b>local</b> <b>strain</b> from Halberstadt in modern-day Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Moritz Baron von Koppy and his son further selected from this strain for white, conical tubers.

40|$|Purpose Mechanical {{interactions}} between muscles {{have been shown}} for in situ conditions. In vivo data for humans is unavailable. Global and local length changes of calf muscles were studied {{to test the hypothesis}} that <b>local</b> <b>strains</b> may occur also within muscle for which global strain equals zero. Methods For determination of globally induced strain in m. gastrocnemius in dissected human cadavers several knee joint angles were imposed, while keeping ankle joint angle constant and measuring its muscle-tendon complex length changes. In vivo <b>local</b> <b>strains</b> in both gastrocnemius and soleus muscles were calculated using MRI techniques in healthy human volunteers comparing images taken at static knee angles of 173 ° and 150 °. Results Imposed global strains on gastrocnemius were much smaller than <b>local</b> <b>strains.</b> High distributions of strains were encountered, e. g. overall lengthened muscle contains locally lengthened, as well as shortened areas within it. Substantial strains were not limited to gastrocnemius, but were found also in synergistic soleus muscle, despite the latter muscle-tendon complex length remaining isometric (constant ankle angle: i. e. global strain = 0), as it does not cross the knee. Based on results of animal experiments this effect is ascribed to myofascial connections between these synergistic muscles. The most likely pathway is the neurovascular tract within the anterior crural compartment (i. e. the collagen reinforcements of blood vessels, lymphatics and nerves). However, direct intermuscular transmission of force may also occur via the perimysium shared between the two muscles. Conclusions Global strains imposed on muscle (joint movement) are not good estimators of in vivo <b>local</b> <b>strains</b> within it: differing in magnitude, as well as direction of length change. Substantial mechanical interaction occurs between calf muscles, which is mediated by myofascial force transmission between these synergistic muscles. This confirms conclusions of previous in situ studies in experimental animals and human patients, for in vivo conditions in healthy human subjects. © 2011 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
