40|$|Abstract. The {{importance}} of <b>house</b> <b>fly</b> (Musca domestica L) wings in mechanical transmission of bacteria was studied. A droplet of phosphate-buffered saline containing Vibrio cholerae was rolled along one wing of each <b>house</b> <b>fly.</b> None {{adhered to the}} wings but small proportions of the bacterium were isolated from about half the wings. Vibrio cholerae was spread onto the ventral wing surfaces of each unconscious <b>house</b> <b>fly</b> which then was placed inside a bottle. When it regained consciousness, the types of activity it performed over five minutes were noted before the <b>house</b> <b>fly</b> was killed and the bacteria on its wings numerated. Control were <b>house</b> <b>flies</b> killed before inoculation. The proportion of <b>house</b> <b>flies</b> with bacteria on their wings and {{the mean number of}} bacteria remaining were significantly less on live <b>house</b> <b>flies</b> than killed controls. Among the live <b>house</b> <b>flies,</b> bacteria were detected on fewer <b>house</b> <b>flies</b> which flew (25 %) than those which did not fly (81 %). In addition, the mean number of bacteria on the former was significantly less than the latter (5 against 780 colonies). However, both these parameters were not significantly different between the group which performed and the group which did not perform wing grooming; takeoff and alighting over short distances, and somersaulting.

40|$|<b>House</b> <b>fly</b> larvae face several {{challenges}} {{during their}} development to adulthood. They must: (1) condition their nutritional resources while avoiding intraspecific competition; (2) avoid competitive fungi and/or inhibit fungal growth; and (3) obtain sufficient bacteria as food supplements.

Specifically, I have shown that: (1) gravid female <b>house</b> <b>flies</b> deposit, and respond to, a time-dependent bacterial cue, Klebsiella oxytoca, that proliferates over time on the surfaces of deposited eggs, inhibiting further oviposition when a threshold bacterial density is reached. This affords female <b>house</b> <b>flies</b> the resource-conditioning benefits of aggregated oviposition while decreasing the risks of cannibalism by older conspecifics; (2) <b>house</b> <b>fly</b> eggs are associated with several bacterial strains, each with a different spectrum of anti-fungal properties that aid in inhibiting the growth of competitive fungi. Volatile semiochemical cues produced by these fungi inhibit oviposition by gravid female <b>house</b> <b>flies,</b> helping them avoid detrimental competition with them; (3) gravid female <b>house</b> <b>flies</b> deposit bacteria that significantly increase larval survival in resources lacking in appropriate bacterial food, likely through supplementation of larval nutrition.

Light {{of the same}} intensity reflected from multiple plastic visual targets showed that <b>house</b> <b>fly</b> compound eye and ocellus were capable of color vision. The greatest neurological responses for the compound eyes and ocelli were to white, blue, and yellow. Behavioral responses of <b>house</b> <b>flies</b> to colored plastic and fabric visual targets compared to black were determined using a two-sided light tunnel.

40|$|ABSTRACT The insect growth regulator, CGA 72662 (N-cyclopropyl-l, 3, 5 -triazine- 2, 4, 6 -tria-mine), {{was tested}} {{both as a}} topical spray and feed {{additive}} for controlling the <b>house</b> <b>fly</b> (Musca domestica L.) breeding in chicken manure. Dosage concentrations of. 025 %,. 05 %, and. 1 % were sprayed on sections of manure surface in a shallow pit egg layer operation at rates of 1. 9 and 3. 8 liters/ 10. 2 m 2. At 17 days posttreatment each concentration at both rates, except. 025 % at 1. 9 liters/ 10. 2 m 2, provided at least a 70 % reduction of native <b>house</b> <b>flies</b> and 100 % inhibition of laboratory reared <b>house</b> <b>flies.</b> CGA 72662 fed to both hens and broilers at rates of 1. 5 ppm and 5 ppm provided up to 100 % mortality of <b>house</b> <b>flies</b> 1 day after birds were started on treated feed to 1 day after treated feed was removed.

40|$|This NebGuide {{describes}} flies {{found in}} confined livestock facilities, how they breed, {{and how they}} can be controlled. The stable <b>fly</b> and <b>house</b> <b>fly</b> are the major insect pests at confined livestock units. The stable fly has a piercing-type mouthpart which is used to pierce the skin to obtain a blood meal. <b>House</b> <b>flies</b> do not bite because they have a sponging-type mouthpart with which they feed on semi-liquid material. The life cycles of the two species are similar, consisting of eggs, larvae (maggots), pupae, and the adult. During summer months the stable fly completes its life cycle in about three weeks and the <b>house</b> <b>fly</b> in about two weeks. Both species deposit eggs in wet, decaying organic matter. This includes spilled livestock feed and manure mixed with soil and moisture. In addition, the <b>house</b> <b>fly</b> will breed in fresh manure. The two species generally overwinter as slowly developing larvae in breeding areas below the frost line. The <b>house</b> <b>fly</b> may breed during the winter in warm buildings if breeding material is present...|$|R
40|$|The pupal parasitoids, Spalangia cameroni Perkins and Muscidifurax raptor Girault and Sanders, can be {{purchased}} for biological control of <b>house</b> <b>flies</b> Musca domestica L. and stable flies Stomoxys calcitrans (L.) (Diptera: Muscidae). Little {{is known about the}} odors involved in host-seeking behavior of these two species, so odors associated with <b>house</b> <b>flies</b> were investigated in the laboratory using a Y-tube olfactometer. Odor stimuli from <b>house</b> <b>fly</b> host puparia, larvae, pine-shavings bedding with horse manure, and developing flies in the pine-shavings-manure substrate were evaluated in bioassays using the two pteromalid species. In choice tests, naı¨ve female S. cameroni were strongly attracted to odor from the substrate containing <b>house</b> <b>fly</b> larvae and secondarily from the uninfested substrate and substrate with puparia versus humidified and purified air. This species also selected the substrate with larvae versus the substrate with the <b>house</b> <b>fly</b> puparia or uninfested substrate. Muscidifurax raptor was attracted to odor from the substrate containing puparia, washed puparia, and substrate with puparia removed. The data suggest that coexistence between the two pteromalid parasitoids, S. cameroni and M. raptor, might be promoted by different host-seeking behavior...|$|R

40|$|<b>House</b> <b>flies</b> (Musca domestica L.) {{are one of}} {{the major}} pests found in poultry farms {{resulting}} in not onlyannoyance and indirect damage to the poultry production but also transmitting many infectious organismsmechanically and biologically. A highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H 5 N 1 (HPAIV H 5 N 1) collectedfrom field <b>house</b> <b>flies</b> in Java Island, have fully succeeded identified and isolated in 2008. The AIV H 5 N 1 isolates were further {{used in the present study}} to determine the presence and persistence of the AIV H 5 N 1 in the laboratory infected <b>house</b> <b>flies.</b> One hundred <b>house</b> <b>flies</b> from a free AIV poultry farm in Yogyakarta,Indonesia were used in this study. The collected <b>house</b> <b>flies</b> were fasted for 12 hours then divided equallyin control and treated groups. The treated group was allowed to imbibe Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium(DMEM) containing AIV H 5 N 1 while the control group imbibed medium without virus for one hour. Theflies from each group were collected at 12 and 24 hours post-exposure, respectively. All flies were immobilizedat 4 °C, immersed in absolute ethanol for a few seconds and dissected under the stereomicroscope to collectthe gastrointestinal (GI) tracts. Based on the RT-PCR results, it is concluded that AIV H 5 N 1 remainedexist in GI tracts of <b>house</b> <b>flies</b> for at least 24 hours post-exposure...|$|R
