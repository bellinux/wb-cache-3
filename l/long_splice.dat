40|$|Synaptic {{transmission}} is highly plastic {{and subject to}} regulation by {{a wide variety of}} neuromodulators and neuropeptides. In the present study, we have examined the role of isoforms of the cytochrome b 561 homologue called no extended memory (nemy) in regulation of synaptic strength and plasticity at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) of third instar larvae in Drosophila. Specifically, we generated two independent excisions of nemy that differentially affect the expression of nemy isoforms. We show that the nemy 45 excision, which specifically reduces the expression of the <b>longest</b> <b>splice</b> form of nemy, leads to an increase in stimulus evoked transmitter release and altered synaptic plasticity at the NMJ. Conversely, the nemy 26. 2 excision, which appears to reduce the expression of all splice forms except the <b>longest</b> <b>splice</b> isoform, shows a reduction in stimulus evoked transmitter release, and enhanced synaptic plasticity. We further show that nemy 45 mutants have reduced levels of amidated peptides similar to that observed in peptidyl-glycine hydryoxylating mono-oxygenase (PHM) mutants. In contrast, nemy 26. 2 mutants show no defects in peptide amidation but rather display a decrease in Tyramine β hydroxylase activity (TβH). Taken together, these results show non-redundant roles for the different nemy isoforms and shed light on the complex regulation of neuromodulators...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn Drosophila, the RNA helicase VASA (VAS) is {{required}} for both germ line formation and oocyte differentiation. While the murine VAS homologue {{is required}} for spermatogenesis, it is dispensable for germ line formation. The molecular basis for this apparently dual role of VAS in germ line ontogeny is, however, unclear. Recent evidence indicates that fish, like flies, employs VAS both in early and late stages of the germ line development {{and that there is}} a sex-linked differential expression of splice variants. We show here that the longer of two splice variants of zebrafish vas is transiently downregulated in the germ line around the time when the germ cells reach the developing gonad. Using transgenic vas::EGFP fish lines, which allow us to distinguish between male and female individuals, we show that the <b>long</b> <b>splice</b> variant reappears in both sexes at around day 25 and is subsequently downregulated during male gonadal development.

50|$|Duchenne muscular {{dystrophy}} (DMD) is caused when a mutation in the dystrophin gene changes the RNA {{so that it}} no longer codes for functional dystrophin protein. This usually happens due to a mutation that alters the reading frame of the RNA downstream of the mutation, so-called frameshift mutation. If an exon with an appropriate number of bases lies near the mutation, removing that exon can correct the downstream reading frame, restoring the production of partially functional dystrophin. This is the general strategy used in the design of exon-skipping oligonucleotides for DMD. As there are 79 exons in the <b>longest</b> <b>splice</b> form of the dystrophin transcript, many different oligonucleotides are needed to address the range of mutations present in the population of people with DMD.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the prevalence of}} Neurotensin Receptor 1 and Tenascin-C in Esophageal Squamous cell and Adenocarcinoma. Neurotensin Receptor 1 (NTR- 1) is overexpressed in many tumours of the gastrointestinal tract, but until now its overexpression in esophageal cancer had not been investigated. Tenascin-C (TnC) is a hexamer glycoprotein of the extracellular matrix. Especially the long unspliced isoform of TnC {{is known to be}} overexpressed in malignomas. While there are two small studies showing Tenascin-C to be overexpressed in esophageal squamous cell and adenocarcinoma until this point there has been no bigger systematic study of Tenascin-C in oesophageal cancer. Furthermore no existing study focuses on the long unspliced isoform of Tenascin-C. Material and Methods 54 samples were obtained from patients with oesophageal adenocarcinoma (AC) or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) operated at Charité Campus Virchow Klinikum. Oesophageal tissue without tumour infiltration existed for 36 of these patients and was used as control sample. In addition we used a commercial tissue array with 60 samples of AC and SCC coated with paraffin wax. In total we had 68 SCC samples,, 40 AC samples and six rare tumour entities. To detect NTR- 1 and TnC mainly immunohistochemical methods were applied. Immunofluorescence in cell cultures, transfection, Western-Blot and Autoradiography were used to proof the methods and the results obtained. Results The presence of NTR- 1 in esophageal carcinoma is first described here in 10 of 54 tissue samples. The <b>long</b> <b>splicing</b> variant of TnC was detected in the connective tissue of all 114 tissue samples of esophageal cancer. There were significant differences in the intensity of staining between frozen and paraffine-coated tissue samples. The presence of TnC in control tissues was significantly lower. Discussion G-Protein-coupled receptors like NTR- 1 are known to be a difficult target in immunohistochemistry. Nevertheless the positive staining of transfected cells found within this study gives some evidence as to the specifity of this staining. The <b>long</b> <b>splicing</b> form of TnC is a good histologic marker of oesophageal cancer, which can distinguish between malignant and non-malignant tissue with good sensitivity and specifity. Up to now there is no clinical application of TnC-Antibodies in gastrointestinal tumours. This study shows that TnC is a promising target for clinical applications...|$|R

40|$|Fas, a death domain-containing {{member of}} the tumor {{necrosis}} factor receptor family and its ligand FasL have been predominantly studied {{with respect to their}} capability to induce cell death. However, a few studies indicate a proliferation-inducing signaling activity of these molecules too. We describe here a novel signaling pathway of FasL and the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) that triggers transcriptional activation of the proto-oncogene c-fos, a typical target gene of mitogenic pathways. FasL- and TRAIL-mediated up-regulation of c-Fos was completely dependent on the presence of Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) and caspase- 8, but caspase activity seemed to be dispensable as a pan inhibitor of caspases had no inhibitory effect. Upon overexpression of the <b>long</b> <b>splice</b> form of cellular FADD-like interleukin- 1 -converting enzyme (FLICE) inhibitory protein (cFLIP) in Jurkat cells, FasL- and TRAIL-induced up-regulation of c-Fos was almost completely blocked. The short splice form of FLIP, however, showed a rather stimulatory effect on c-Fos induction. Together these data demonstrate the existence of a death receptor-induced, FADD- and caspase- 8 -dependent pathway leading to c-Fos induction that is inhibited by the <b>long</b> <b>splice</b> form FLIP-L...|$|E
40|$|The {{activity}} of dopaminergic (DA) substantia nigra (SN) neurons {{is essential for}} voluntary movement control. An intrinsic pacemaker in DA SN neurons generates their tonic spontaneous activity, which triggers dopamine release. We show here, by combining multiplex and quantitative real-time single-cell RT– PCR with slice patch–clamp electrophysiology, that an A-type potassium channel mediated by Kv 4. 3 and KChip 3 subunits has {{a key role in}} pacemaker control. The number of active A-type potassium channels is not only tightly associated with the pacemaker frequency of individual DA SN neurons, but is also highly correlated with their number of Kv 4. 3 L (<b>long</b> <b>splice</b> variant) and KChip 3. 1 (<b>long</b> <b>splice</b> variant) mRNA molecules. Consequently, the variation of Kv 4 α and Kv 4 β subunit transcript numbers is sufficient to explain the full spectrum of spontaneous pacemaker frequencies in identified DA SN neurons. This linear coupling between Kv 4 α as well as Kv 4 β mRNA abundance, A-type channel density and pacemaker frequency suggests a surprisingly simple molecular mechanism for how DA SN neurons tune their variable firing rates by transcriptional control of ion channel genes...|$|E
40|$|The {{neuronal}} scaffolding protein AIDA- 1 {{is believed}} {{to act as a}} convener of signals arising at postsynaptic densities. Among the readily identifiable domains in AIDA- 1, two closely juxtaposed sterile alpha motif (SAM) domains and a phosphotyrosine binding domain are located within the C-terminus of the <b>longest</b> <b>splice</b> variant and exclusively in four shorter splice variants. As a first step towards understanding the possible emergent properties arising from this assembly of ligand binding domains, we have used NMR methods to solve the first structure of a SAM domain tandem. Separated by a 15 -aa linker, the two SAM domains are fused in a head-to-tail orientation that has been observed in other hetero- and homotypic SAM domain structures. The basic nuclear import signal for AIDA- 1 is buried at the interface between the two SAM domains. An observed disparity between the thermal stabilities of the two SAM domains suggests a mechanism whereby the second SAM domain decouples from the first SAM domain to facilitate translocation of AIDA- 1 to the nucleus...|$|R

We examined the function of Siah 1 A in ubiquitination and degradation of group 1 mGluRs in heterologously expressing cell lines. Coexpression of Siah 1 A markedly decreased the SID-containing splice forms of group 1 mGluRs but not the SID-lacking mGluR 1 b splice form or the SID-deleted mGluR 1 a mutant. The decrease of mGluR 1 a resulted from accelerated protein turnover, as revealed by pulse–chase experiments. The Siah 1 A-mediated degradation of group 1 mGluRs was abrogated by not only mutations at the RING-finger domain of Siah 1 A but also treatment with a proteasome inhibitor. Siah 1 A coexpression induced strong ubiquitination of group 1 mGluRs. Replacements of lysine residues with arginine showed that Siah 1 A-mediated ubiquitination occurs at multiple lysine residues spanning both the seven-transmembrane region and carboxyl-terminal tail of mGluR 5. In situ hybridization histochemistry showed a wide-spread distribution of Siah 1 mRNAs, with high expression in the hippocampal pyramidal neurons and cerebellar Purkinje cells. Group 1 mGluRs play critical roles in the neural plasticity in both the hippocampal neurons and Purkinje cells. This investigation indicates that Siah 1 A serves as a selective ubiquitin ligase that mediates ubiquitination-dependent degradation of <b>long</b> <b>splice</b> variants of group 1 mGluRs and would contribute to posttranslational down-regulation of group 1 mGluRs...|$|E
40|$|Members of the pacifastin {{family have}} been {{characterized}} as serine peptidase inhibitors (PI), but their target enzyme(s) are unknown in insects. So far, the structural and biochemical characteristics of pacifastin-like PI {{have only been}} studied in locusts. Here we report the molecular identification and functional characterization of a pacifastin-like precursor in a lepidopteran insect, i. e. the silkworm Bombyx mori. The bmpp- 1 gene contains 17 exons and codes for two pacifastin-related precursors of different length. The <b>longest</b> <b>splice</b> variant encodes 13 inhibitor domains, {{more than any other}} pacifastin-like precursor in arthropods. The second transcript lacks two exons and codes for 11 inhibitor domains. By studying the expression profile of the Bombyx pacifastin-like gene a different expression pattern for the two variants was observed suggesting functional diversification. Next, several PI domains of BMPP- 1 were produced and, contrary to locust pacifastin peptides, they were found to be potent inhibitors of both bovine trypsin and chymotrypsin. Surprisingly, the same Bombyx PI are only weak inhibitors of endogenous digestive peptidases, indicating that other peptidases are the in vivo targets. Interestingly, the Bombyx PI inhibit a fungal trypsin-like cuticle degrading enzyme, suggesting a protective function for BMPP- 1 against entomopathogenic fungi. status: publishe...|$|R

Our X-gal staining results revealed that Shank 3 proteins encoded by exon 9 -containing splice variants are abundant in upper cortical layers, striatum, hippocampus, and thalamus, {{but not in the}} olfactory bulb or cerebellum, despite the significant Shank 3 mRNA levels in these regions. The hippocampal CA 1 region of Shank 3 ∆ 9 mice exhibited reduced excitatory transmission at Schaffer collateral synapses and increased frequency of spontaneous inhibitory synaptic events in pyramidal neurons. In contrast, prelimbic layer 2 / 3 pyramidal neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex displayed decreased frequency of spontaneous inhibitory synaptic events, indicating alterations in the ratio of excitation/inhibition (E/I ratio) in the Shank 3 ∆ 9 brain. These mice displayed a mild increase in rearing in a novel environment and mildly impaired spatial memory, but showed normal social interaction and repetitive behavior.

DISC 1 is interrupted by a balanced chr(1; 11) translocation in a Scottish family in which the translocation predisposes to psychiatric disorders. We investigate the consequences of DISC 1 interruption in human neural cells using TALENs or CRISPR-Cas 9 to target the DISC 1 locus. We show that disruption of DISC 1 {{near the site of}} the translocation results in decreased DISC 1 protein levels because of nonsense-mediated decay of <b>long</b> <b>splice</b> variants. This results in an increased level of canonical Wnt signaling in neural progenitor cells and altered expression of fate markers such as Foxg 1 and Tbr 2. These gene expression changes are rescued by antagonizing Wnt signaling in a critical developmental window, supporting the hypothesis that DISC 1 -dependent suppression of basal Wnt signaling influences the distribution of cell types generated during cortical development...|$|E

The splicing makes {{the edges of the}} “stub” rounded and smooth, improving the optical performance. The fabricated MSRs had typical stem/cavity diameters of 125 µm/ 200 µm, respectively, and 50 - 200 µm lengths. Strong resonances with coupling efficiencies and Q factors > 15 dB and 106, respectively, were demonstrated. Using a special Ytterbium doped fiber with doped core diameter of 220 µm and cladding diameter of 240 µm, we formed active MSRs with 50 - 500 µm lengths and 125 µm stem diameters. The active MSRs were side pumped by 980 nm single-mode diodes through their stems. Residual pump and generated signal were monitored at the opposite fiber stem end. Strong lasing peaks in the 1060 nm wavelength range were observed. No transversely scattered signal/pump light was detected. This indicates that the whispering-gallery modes were formed at the inner doped core/cladding interface. In stark contrast with previous microlaser demonstrations, this laser does not need additional microtapers/waveguides for launching or collecting light. This is the first demonstration of a robust, fully integrated, stand-alone microresonator laser where pump launching and signal collection is achieved by the fiber stems, used to form the microcavity.

Methods: Expression of GABRB 2, and the epigenetic regulatory enzymes histone deacetylases (HDACs) and DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in mouse and postmortem human brains was analyzed using real-time PCR. Results: Results showed that expression of GABRB 2 isoforms significantly increased over time in both mouse and human, especially for the <b>long</b> <b>splicing</b> isoform. In the brains of non-psychiatric controls (CON), a significant positive correlation of GABRB 2 expression with age was observed in individuals with MM genotypes of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs 187269 and rs 1816072. This was reversed to a significant negative correlation in schizophrenics (SCZ). A similar reversal was also displayed by bipolar disorder (BPD) patients. In parallel, a significant co-variation of HDAC 1 with GABRB 2 expression observed in CON remained significant in BPD but not in SCZ; comparably, a significant co-variation of HDAC 2 with GABRB 2 expression observed in CON became non-significant in both SCZ and BPD. Moreover, co-variations of DNMT 1 and DNMT 3 B with GABRB 2, not observable in CON, became significant in BPD. Conclusion: These findings demonstrated that GABRB 2 expression was under epigenetic regulation that varied with development, genotype and disease status, and these regulatory mechanisms were observably disrupted in SCZ and BPD. This study provided insight into the complex inheritance patterns of psychiatric disorders, {{and pointed to the}} involvement of epigenetic dysregulation in the disease process of major psychotic disorders. © 2011...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn mammals, {{an array}} of MEF 2 C {{proteins}} is generated by alternative splicing (AS), yet specific functions have not been ascribed to each isoform. Teleost fish possess two MEF 2 C paralogues, mef 2 ca and mef 2 cb. In zebrafish, the Mef 2 cs function to promote cardiomyogenic differentiation and myofibrillogenesis in nascent skeletal myofibers. We found that zebrafish mef 2 ca and mef 2 cb are alternatively spliced in the coding exons 4 – 6 region and these splice variants differ in their biological activity. Of the two, mef 2 ca is more abundantly expressed in developing skeletal muscle, its activity is tuned through zebrafish development by AS. By 24 hpf, we found the prevalent expression of the highly active full length protein in differentiated muscle in the somites. The splicing isoform of mef 2 ca that lacks exon 5 (mef 2 ca 4 – 6), encodes a protein that has 50 % lower transcriptional activity, and is found mainly earlier in development, before muscle differentiation. mef 2 ca transcripts including exon 5 (mef 2 ca 4 – 5 – 6) are present early in the embryo. Over-expression of this isoform alters the expression of genes involved in early dorso-ventral patterning of the embryo such as chordin, nodal related 1 and goosecoid, and induces severe developmental defects. AS of mef 2 cb generates a <b>long</b> <b>splicing</b> isoform in the exon 5 region (Mef 2 cbL) that predominates during somitogenesis. Mef 2 cbL contains an evolutionarily conserved domain derived from exonization of a fragment of intron 5, which confers the ability to induce ectopic muscle in mesoderm upon over-expression of the protein.

To assess whether leptin is involved in fetal growth and development we have examined the distribution of mRNAs encoding leptin and the leptin receptor (which has at least six splice variants) in the 14. 5 -day postcoitus mouse fetus and in the placenta using reverse transcription–PCR and in situ hybridization. High levels of gene expression for leptin, the leptin receptor, and the <b>long</b> <b>splice</b> variant of the leptin receptor with an intracellular signaling domain were observed in the placenta, fetal cartilage/bone, and hair follicles.

The location of the splice acceptor of the human foamy virus pol mRNA was confirmed to map in gag. The pol splice acceptor site in gag of the cat foamy virus is located further downstream than that of human foamy virus...|$|R
40|$|According to Dr. Hart Smith "If {{the well}} known {{fuselage}} splice fatigue problem {{were removed from}} consideration, {{the remainder of the}} structure have performed well enough to outlast the arrival of the next generation of improved engines or systems most of the time". In other words, apart from the lap splices, technical obsolescence for the whole aircraft arrived before the airframe became too expensive to continue to operate. The paper gives a glimpse of the historical development of fuselage splice joints. Through many ups and downs in aircraft industry, design of <b>long</b> life <b>splice</b> joint has come to a mature stage. Many forgotten features of splice design of early 50 's have been revived. To extend the fatigue life considerably, new features have been incorporated. Some of the intricacies of fuselage splices are discussed in detail in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Recent {{results showed}} that certain DEAD box protein RNA helicases, DDX 3 and DDX 1, play an {{important}} role in the HIV infection cycle by facilitating the export of <b>long,</b> singly <b>spliced</b> or unspliced HIV RNAs from the nucleus via the CRM 1 -Rev pathway. Close examination of an extensive microarray expression profiling dataset obtained from cells latently infected with HIV induced to undergo lytic viral replication indicated that additional DEAD box proteins, beyond DDX 3 and DDX 1, exhibit differential expression during lytic HIV replication, and in latently infected cells prior to induction into active replication. This finding provides additional evidence that the involvement of DEAD box proteins and other RNA-binding proteins may play roles in active HIV replication and in the control of viral latency. Agents targeting these functions may offer new approaches to antiretroviral therapy and the therapeutic manipulation of HIV latency. </p...|$|R
