500|$|Pint-sized pop diva Kylie Minogue's {{continued}} crossover from lightweight pop puppet to respected artist {{continued with}} the release of this, a compilation of remixed singles from the Impossible Princess album. [...] walks an unrelenting line — with ten versions of four songs ("Breathe" [...] clocks in with the highest total at four versions), there's not a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>room</b> for variation — and the repetition certainly makes for classic club fodder. This is the voice of the new Minogue doing dance as the faded remnants of the Stock, Aitken and Waterman patsy is left well and truly behind — she's now the voice behind the DJs — and there's plenty of their work on this double CD set to sink your teeth into [...] Hardcore Minogue fans with a good pair of dancing shoes may find this gyrating repetition worthwhile; general fans, however, may find the original Impossible Princess more accommodating.|$|E
500|$|In a 2012 interview, Vladimir Kramnik {{stated that}} Carlsen's [...] "excellent {{physical}} shape" [...] was {{a contributing factor}} to his success against other top players as it prevents [...] "psychological lapses", which enables Carlsen to maintain a high standard of play over long games {{and at the end}} of tournaments, when the energy levels of others have dropped. Tyler Cowen gave a point of view on Carlsen's playing style: [...] "Carlsen is demonstrating one of his most feared qualities, namely his 'nettlesomeness,' to use a term coined for this purpose by Ken Regan. Using computer analysis, you can measure which players do the most to cause their opponents to make mistakes. Carlsen has the highest nettlesomeness score by this metric, because his creative moves pressure the other player and open up a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>room</b> for mistakes. In contrast, a player such as Kramnik plays a high percentage of very accurate moves, and of course he is very strong, but those moves are in some way calmer and they are less likely to induce mistakes in response." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Harvest Festival" [...] was {{the first}} episode of the season written and {{produced}} separately from the second season. The previous six episodes from the third season were filmed almost immediately after the second season ended {{as part of an}} early shooting schedule to accommodate Poehler's pregnancy. Series co-creator Michael Schur described it as a particularly empowering episode for the Leslie Knope character: [...] "When you see this episode [...] it makes you love her even more. This episode is about Leslie being noticed for the incredible hard work she does." [...] Schur also said he believed the subplot with April and Andy was one that several young people in their situation have faced in real life: [...] "Andy is put into a situation {{that a lot of people}} have been put into in our lives and he does the exact wrong thing you can do. And that's sort of the template for them going forward is what's the wrongest thing you can do? That's sort of how we follow them." [...] Chris Pratt said he believed the conflict provided strong romantic and comedic potential for the characters: [...] "There definitely will be conflict in their relationship [...] there's still a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>room</b> for comedy in there, because we have good writers." ...|$|E

They appeared alongside the Second Doctor (Patrick Troughton) in The Ice Warriors (1967) and The Seeds of Death (1969) and returned in the Third Doctor (Jon Pertwee) stories The Curse of Peladon (1972) and The Monster of Peladon (1974). Showrunner Steven Moffat had originally been hesitant {{to bring back the}} Ice Warriors, worrying that they were seen as [...] "the default condition for what people thought of as rubbish Doctor Who monsters— things that moved very, very slowly and spoke in a way that meant you couldn't hear a word they said." [...] Writer Mark Gatiss, however, was a fan of the Ice Warriors' stories and had been campaigning to bring them back. In a phone conversation with Moffat that was originally supposed to be about their show Sherlock, Gatiss pitched new and [...] "very clever ideas" [...] {{of what to do with}} the Ice Warriors, and Moffat agreed. What sold Moffat were the submarine setting and seeing what the Ice Warriors looked like underneath their suits. Gatiss felt that the Ice Warriors had a lot of gaps in their timeline and had not been featured in a while, which allowed a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>room</b> to explore them.|$|E
500|$|Early in {{the writing}} process, Donegan created guitar riffs. The rest of the band then listened to the riffs, and wrote {{the rest of the}} music, with the riffs being the base. As Donegan commented, [...] "The writing process is... pretty much the same since the beginning... of this band. It's always been riffs; {{something}} musically that I'll come up with [...]" [...] Wengren commented, [...] "We're always tossing around riffs and beats, but it isn't really until we get home and we are able to clear our minds, decompress for a little bit, and then hit it, especially Danny and I, and just start throwing the riffs and the beats out, that the music starts to finally come to life." [...] Bassist John Moyer left the studio during the recording process, due to his wife being pregnant. Donegan and Wengren sent him demos through e-mail, and he continued to write bass lines for the songs from his home studio. Regarding electronics on the album, Donegan said, [...] "When the basic guitar, bass, [...] drums were being laid down, at first I didn't really see a whole <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>room</b> for some of the electronics, but as the songs were starting to develop, I was just in that frame of mind to try and toy around with some of the electronics." ...|$|E

500|$|Weiss {{additionally}} {{spoke about}} the introduction of Lyanna Mormont in the series, with Weiss saying, [...] "We were excited {{about the prospect of}} the character because she's mentioned in passing in the previous season," [...] referring to her letter to Stannis denying him men, and swearing fealty to House Stark. Weiss added, [...] "The more we thought about it, Jon is going to come up against so many old guys with beards in the North that like 'What if she was a tougher audience?' It seemed like an inherently fun scene to watch, it also is terrifying because it's putting a lot of dramatic weight on the shoulders of somebody who needs to be very young." [...] David Benioff concluded the featurette speaking about the Ironborn story, noting [...] "Yara's not a therapist, in our kind of sense of the word, she's not there to tell him to 'buck up' and 'everything's going to be okay,' it's a pretty brutal kind of therapy, but that's who they are, I mean they're essentially a Viking people. There's not a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>room</b> for sort of soft, and gentle psychology. I think it's the kind of tough love Theon needed at this point, and when he finally raises his eyes, and looks into her eyes, we see a glimpse of the old Theon that had been lost for so long." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{background}} vocals in {{the song}} were compressed using a compressor program called Waves Renaissance Compressor, which was used {{in order to create}} an enhanced polished effect. In an interview with Sound on Sound, mixing engineer Phil Tan, who carried out the audio mixing on [...] "SOS", explained that he compressed the background vocals because [...] "SOS" [...] is a [...] "high energy track", and he wanted the vocals to complement it. Tan also noted that the background vocals were pitch shifted to increase tonal quality and create an enhanced effect during the chorus. The pitch shifting consisted of making the left vocals flat and the right vocals sharp, with varying degrees of delay, and later mixing them together. When asked about the production of the lead vocals, Tan described the song as [...] "a pounding type of song, and the lyrics are a cry for help, so the vocals need to be 'in your face', almost aggressive," [...] and said that he wanted the vocals to remain constant. As with the background vocals, the lead vocals were compressed using the Waves Renaissance Compressor. Tan continued to note that the lack of reverb included on [...] "SOS" [...] was largely {{due to the fact that}} being an uptempo song, there was not a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>room</b> left to add anything else. Tan explained the production process of sampling [...] "Tainted Love", as well as the changes which were made: ...|$|E
500|$|Soap opera {{commentator}} Jenn Bishop {{said she}} {{found it difficult to}} explain Todd's popularity, and that if she is perplexed about her feelings regarding him, it is understandable that others would be as well. [...] "If I were to give a surface level assessment of Todd, I'd say he's an abhorrent character with little to no redeeming qualities," [...] she said. [...] "His actions, which span from the immoral to criminal, can be downright heinous. I wouldn't want to know Todd, let alone be around him in real life. Nor would I want any woman to have any sort of relationship with him." [...] Instead of seeing Todd as an antihero, she saw him as more of [...] "an anti-anti-hero" [...] and stated that what added to his appeal was that his rape storyline was authentic. [...] "While Todd is not the first (or the last) soap character to have committed this crime, the realness of this particular storyline didn't leave a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>room</b> for rewrites," [...] Bishop commented. [...] "For example, Luke's rape of Laura on General Hospital was rewritten and for years was referred to as a 'seduction.' There was no 'grey area'. This [...] could not be dismissed as simply the behavior of a romantic rogue." [...] To Bishop, the end result of this aspect, and that the writers had Todd generally pay for his crimes, [...] "was the development of a dynamic, unpredictable, multi-faceted character with many traits that conflict with one another" [...] and [...] "ll this makes for one messed up guy, intriguing to the viewers and one I can't help but like".|$|E

Porter highlighted the song as an album stand out track. Brendan Swift from AllMusic was mixed {{in his review}} from Impossible Remixes, which the Brothers in Rhythm remix of [...] "Too Far" [...] was included on. He commented that [...] "with ten versions of four songs ("Too Far", [...] "Some Kind of Bliss", [...] "Did it Again", and [...] "Breathe"), there's not a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>room</b> for variation... and the repetition certainly makes for classic club fodder." [...] However, Swift acknowledge that Brothers in Rhythm, and other remix artists from the two accompanying albums, [...] "do their best to mix it up, and they succeed by drip-drying the pop melodies and distilling them into pure club-style mash." [...] Despite an airplay and vinyl release, the Brothers in Rhythm remix failed to appear on any record charts. No music video was directed or produced.|$|E
2500|$|Let's Play videos {{have been}} {{considered}} a favorable way to market game titles, in particularly for smaller developers. In one case for Thomas Was Alone, Mike Bithell, its developer, attributed {{the success of the}} game to a Let's Play video by game commentator and critic John Bain, also known as TotalBiscuit. Similarly, Davey Wreden, the developer of The Stanley Parable developed a relationship with various Let's Play channels prior to the release to assure they could play and record his game; his team further created specialized demos for two popular channels (Rev3Games and Steam Train) that jokingly teased the specific players. Wreden believes this helped lead to the over 100,000 sales of the full game within the first three days of release. Some developers have designed their games to be favorable for Let's Play videos.

2500|$|Life cycle {{assessment}} {{is a powerful}} tool for analyzing [...] aspects of quantifiable systems. Not every factor, however, can be reduced to a number and inserted into a model. Rigid system boundaries make accounting for changes in the system difficult. This is sometimes referred to as the boundary critique to systems thinking. The accuracy and availability of data can also contribute to inaccuracy. For instance, data from generic processes may be based on averages, unrepresentative sampling, or outdated results. Additionally, social implications of products are generally lacking in LCAs. Comparative life-cycle analysis is often used to determine a better process or product to use. However, because of aspects like differing system boundaries, different statistical information, different product uses, etc., these studies can easily be swayed in favor of one product or process over another in one study and the opposite in another study based on varying parameters and different available data. There are guidelines to help reduce such conflicts in results but the method still provides a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>room</b> for the researcher to decide what is important, how the product is typically manufactured, and how it is typically used.|$|E

[...] "Another guy that came from Cretin-Derham Hall, Paul Molitor, was very similar, [...] had a good short swing", O'Neill said. [...] "And they're both able to wait on the ball so long because they don't have the big swing.

[...] When offered the series regular position, Dane was not aware of the character's future on the show, noting the boldness of the character's introduction in the previous season, by contrast to his first {{appearance in the}} third season. Fellow cast member Pompeo offered her insight on Sloan's reintroduction, noting that the inevitability of the character's return was due to his overwhelming popularity, mainly among the female audience, who immediately responded to the concept of the character. Dane only makes a short, uncredited appearance in the episode, seeing his naked character exiting a steamy bathroom. The scene {{has become one of the}} most iconic of the series.
