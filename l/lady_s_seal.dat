50|$|The short {{opens with}} Masked Man M taking on an {{extremely}} obese female wrestler in the ring. She traps {{him in her}} skin folds, but Masked Man M manages to escape. The obese wrestler taps out to <b>Lady</b> <b>S,</b> who kicks Masked Man M in the chest - a move he appears to greatly enjoy. This prompts him to accidentally swap out with his partner Chicken, who tries and fails to attack <b>Lady</b> <b>S.</b> She proceeds to beat him while an envious Masked Man M watches, begging for Chicken to swap out with him. Chicken succeeds, {{but at this point}} <b>Lady</b> <b>S</b> also swaps out with the obese wrestler, to his dismay. Masked Man M manages to beat the obese wrestler, which angers The Boss. He storms down to the dressing room to confront Masked Man M and Chicken, as <b>Lady</b> <b>S</b> was supposed to win the match. The Boss just barely misses the two as they flee the arena, Masked Man M carrying a box of <b>Lady</b> <b>S</b> dolls he stole.|$|R

5000|$|Later {{that night}} Romeo {{receives}} {{a call from}} The Boss, who tells him that <b>Lady</b> <b>S</b> has specifically asked to fight him. The winner will receive $50,000 in prize money. Romeo agrees, and, the next night, he eagerly goes out into the ring as Masked Man M. The two proceed to fight one another, much to Masked Man M's joy. The fight progresses until <b>Lady</b> <b>S</b> traps Masked Man M in a headlock, suffocating him while telling him [...] "This is what you want, right?" [...] She brings him to a near death experience while telling him that he should just remain in his fantasy world. However, the children from his orphanage are attending that night and beg Masked Man M not to give up, which spurs him to touch one of the wrestling ring ropes with his foot. This forces <b>Lady</b> <b>S</b> to release him from the headlock, but she then proceeds to continually beat him. <b>Lady</b> <b>S</b> overestimates the power {{in one of her}} jumps and ends up getting knocked out by the impact when Masked Man M moves out of the way at the last minute. He holds her down and almost wins, but, at the last minute, is signaled to throw the match, which he does. After the match Masked Man M's popularity takes off and Romeo returns to the orphanage where he realizes that Sister Juliet is <b>Lady</b> <b>S,</b> as she has used the money to fix the place up.|$|R
