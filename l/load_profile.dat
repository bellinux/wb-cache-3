40|$|<b>Load</b> <b>profiles</b> play an {{important}} role in electricity industry. They are widely used in tariff design and system operation planning. In the UK, the <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> currently used by the industry were developed in 1990 s. Although they have served the industry well for decades, the increasing number of low carbon customers may cause the actual <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> to deviate from the original benchmarks. Thus, these existing <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> may not be able to appropriately reflect the energy usage patterns nowadays. Therefore, it is necessary to test the accuracy and applicability of the existing classic <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> and further refine them to better mimic the actual power consumption patterns. Theoretically, it is more accurate to obtain <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> by measuring the power consumption of all customers in each class; however, the reality is that it is often too expensive or impractical to collect and analyze the load data for an entire area. This report proposes a power synthesis approach to testify and analyze the representativeness of the existing <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> in the new power environment. The <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> currently used by the UK's industry are first introduced and they are further tested with the recorded data taken from Dowlishford substation in Southwest England. Obtained results show that the current <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> are out of date, and the corresponding errors are identified and the causes are analyzed...|$|R

40|$|A proper {{estimation}} of the residential <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> in the LV network is an important aspect for distribution system design, planning and operation. However, the currently used approaches to characterize the LV residential <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> are not comprehensive enough for a thorough evaluation of the operational conditions in the LV network, as highlighted in [1]. Therefore, in this paper, an approach for LV residential customers' <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> characterization is proposed together with a methodology for applying it to generate more realistic synthetic load data. Based on comprehensive measurements conducted in a typical LV network, real <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> from residential customers were obtained.

First, we use measured <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> for households and simulate stochastic <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> for commercial consumers. We combine the generated <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> with data on PV output to determine the net demand <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> at 1 km 2 grid. Thirdly, we {{study the effects of}} a large scale implementation of rooftop PV on the energy system using the JRC EU TIMES model. We find that (excluding night hours) on average in 9 % of the hours supply exceeds demand, differing between 0 % and 60 % depending on the grid cell. When only including household <b>load</b> <b>profiles,</b> surplus production increases to 23 %. This suggests to giving priority to decentralized PV development in areas with a higher share of commercial consumers.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} an electricity consumer charac-terization framework {{based on a}} knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) procedure, supported by data mining (DM) techniques, ap-plied on the different stages of the process.

Two main modules com-pose this framework: the <b>load</b> <b>profiling</b> module and the classifica-tion module. The <b>load</b> <b>profiling</b> module creates a set of consumer classes using a clustering operation and the representative <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> for each class.

40|$|With the {{promotion}} of demand side responses (DSRs) and low carbon technologies (LCTs), {{there is a growing}} interest in visualising the demand information at individual consumer and low voltage (LV) network level, where demands are less aggregated and highly volatile. Yet, traditional <b>load</b> <b>profiling</b> techniques, which are carried out on small data, are struggling to meet the requirements on accuracy and granularity. This thesis contributes to this area by extending traditional <b>load</b> <b>profiling</b> to a big-data context, where refined <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> (smart data) can be extracted by two novel <b>load</b> <b>profiling</b> techniques for LV networks and individual consumers. The refined <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> aim to: i) economically visualise LV networks with limited smart-grid monitoring data; ii) transform the smart metering data into a high-detail granular representation of the customers’ daily demand. For the LV networks, this thesis develops a novel concept, LV network templates, which aim to visualise the LV networks in a cost-effective manner. A novel three-stage <b>load</b> <b>profiling</b> method is proposed as: clustering, classification and scaling. By using statistical time-series analysis, three steps are undertaken: i) cluster a vast amount of load data according to their load shapes; ii) classify un-monitored substations to the most similar cluster without sample metering; iii) and also scale them to the right magnitude without sample metering. Through this method, limited representative monitoring data can be used to develop a library of typical <b>load</b> <b>profiles</b> for un-monitored networks, thus saving the cost of extensive monitoring for every single substation. In addition, it is the first <b>load</b> <b>profiling</b> method that can accurately express both load shapes and magnitudes for LV networks. Regarding the customer’s demand representation, the developed time-series analysis needs to be updated due to the volatile and uncertain nature of smart metering data, including inter-related factors such as overall load shapes, sudden spikes and magnitudes. Therefore, an innovative spectral <b>load</b> <b>profiling</b> is proposed to decompose these factors into different spectral levels, characterised by spectral features. By analysing the extracted features on each spectral level separately through multi-resolution analysis, the interference among different factors can effectively be prevented. The proposed method, for the first time, is able to fully capture the energy characteristics at the household level. The developed LV network load templates provide an economical but straightforward way to quantify the available headroom of unmonitored substations over time, providing quantitative information for distribution network operators to integrate LTCs at the minimal costs. The spectral <b>load</b> <b>profiling</b> gives an insight into customer’s energy behaviours with high granularity and accuracy. It can support the customer-specified DSR, tariff design, smart metering validation and load forecasting...|$|R
