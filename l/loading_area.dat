5|$|Six Flags designers' {{decorative}} theme {{attempts to}} capture the spirit of Batman's world for those queuing to board the ride. As the queue moves through Gotham City Park, the theme becomes more ominous. Modeled after Anton Furst's award-winning set design for the original Batman film, the atmosphere indicates a crime-ridden and dirty environment, with wrecked cars, discarded pieces of equipment, crumbling concrete, and a Gotham City Police car riddled with bullet holes. The queue then enters the ride structure. The ride passenger <b>loading</b> <b>area</b> is modeled on Batman's Batcave, and features {{a replica of the}} Batsuit from the 1989 film.|$|E

5000|$|The Pilot was {{available}} in capacities from 2.2 to 2.6 tonnes in a [...] <b>load</b> <b>area.</b> Power came from a 1.9 litre Peugeot diesel engine driving the rear wheels through a 5-speed gearbox. Access to the <b>load</b> <b>area</b> is from either the rear or a sliding side door.|$|R
50|$|The {{thinking}} {{behind the}} car {{was similar to that}} of Renault chairman Pierre Lefaucheux at this time: the 171 was intended to satisfy similar marketplace objectives to those addressed by the Renault Colorale. It first appeared formally at the Paris Motor Show in 1949, but sales started only in 1950 of two different “Pick-up” versions, designed to take a ton of load. The “Pick-up Normal” version, with an advertised starting price of 991,500 Francs, had its <b>load</b> <b>area</b> behind the vehicle's cabin but between the two rear wheels, giving a <b>load</b> <b>area</b> that was unencumbered by wheel arches but relatively narrow. With the “Pick-up Large” version the <b>load</b> <b>area</b> extended to the full width of the cabin, but with the intrusion of the wheel arches. The bodywork of the <b>load</b> <b>area</b> did not extend beyond the cabin width on either version.|$|R
25|$|Blast mining or {{conventional}} mining, is {{an older}} practice that uses explosives such as dynamite {{to break up}} the coal seam, after which the coal is gathered and loaded onto shuttle cars or conveyors for removal to a central <b>loading</b> <b>area.</b> This process consists of a series of operations that begins with “cutting” the coalbed so it will break easily when blasted with explosives. This type of mining accounts for less than 5 percent of total underground production in the US today.|$|E

25|$|At the <b>loading</b> <b>area,</b> guests {{board the}} troop transport. Through the radio, Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) reminds the {{tourists}} to fasten their seat belts, {{and points out}} {{a problem with the}} transport. The transport takes off, past a cluster of mirrors concealing the maintenance dock entrance, and turns a corner into the Chamber of Destiny, where guests are presented with three doors. One of the three doors begins to glow more brightly than the other two, and Mara announces which gift the passengers have chosen to receive. The doors open, and the passengers enter the Hall of Promise.|$|E

500|$|According to the Universal Orlando Resort Rider's Guide, {{both legs}} must {{protrude}} {{from under the}} restraint and form a lap. In practice, above-knee amputees will {{not be permitted to}} ride unless their residual natural limb reaches the edge of the seat (or at least includes a knee), even if the lock-bar appears to successfully engage the limb. Lower-limb prosthetics will not offset this requirement since they must be removed prior to boarding the ride. These particular restrictions are not clearly posted at the ride or on the website, which lists the height requirement only. The lower limb prosthetic removal requirement {{can be found at the}} [...] "Accessibility Information" [...] page under [...] "Guests with Prosthetic Limbs." [...] The residual limb length requirement is not listed there but will be enforced at the ride prior to boarding. [...] Wheelchair users who are able to transfer directly to the ride vehicle may do so at a separate area, which does not contain the introductory theming of the Floo Network. [...] Instead, wheelchair users pass through a series of unthemed elevators and corridors to arrive at the accessible <b>loading</b> <b>area.</b> [...] Only one accessible ride vehicle is available, and each party must wait for the previous group to return before they may enter the <b>loading</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
500|$|The tower's loading dock, however, was {{not due to}} be {{finished}} in time to move equipment into the completed building, so five temporary loading bays were added {{at a cost of}} millions of dollars. The temporary PATH station was not to be removed until its official replacement, the World Trade Center Transportation Hub, was completed, blocking access to the planned <b>loading</b> <b>area.</b> By March 2012, One World Trade Center's steel structure had reached 93 floors, growing to 94 floors and [...] {{by the end of the}} month. However, because the floor numberings were based on standard measurements, the 94th floor was numbered [...] "floor 100", because the extra space was occupied by the high-ceilinged 91st floor, which was used for mechanical purposes.|$|E

500|$|As {{the only}} proper {{station on the}} line, Flekkefjord was built in brick in Art Nouveau. The two-story [...] {{building}} which was designed by Paul Armin Due had a ground floor with a ticket office, four offices and three waiting rooms. The second story was an apartment for the station master. Due chose to design the building symmetrically around the waiting room. It had arched widows and doors, curved corners and two round towers. This gave both a tight and soft form in organic interaction. It has been considered one of Due's best works of Art Nouveau. Beside the station there was a [...] single story restaurant building. In addition to a large main building, the station had a freight building, a wharf, a locomotive and wagon depot, and a <b>loading</b> <b>area.</b> There were four tracks past the station, in addition to two track to the cargo area. The cargo building had room for three wagons. The locomotive depot had places for six steam locomotives.|$|E
500|$|The {{gardens and}} menagerie area {{includes}} {{an encounter with}} a [...] "cute little bunnyoid on the stump". It looks like a horned rabbit on a tree stump, but when approached, the stump develops fangs and its roots become tentacles, which it then uses to attack the characters. The next encounter involves a froghemoth, a large alien frog-like creature with tentacles and three eyes on an eyestalk. In the sixth and final section, the activity deck, the players' characters must contend with various sports robots, including a [...] "boxing and wrestling trainer" [...] and a [...] "karate master". If the characters can communicate with the karate master and tell it that boxing is superior to karate, it will attack the boxing robot until both are destroyed, else they will both attack the characters. The last area of the activity deck is the <b>loading</b> <b>area,</b> where the characters can leave the spaceship. The adventure then ends, with no postscript.|$|E

5000|$|The van {{took its}} 4-cylinder [...] engine, {{initially}} of 1628 cc, from the company's Traction 7C. In the car the engine sat comfortably {{just behind the}} front wheels, but in the van most of the engine's weight, along with the driver's feet, was ahead of the front wheels. The driver's cab was raised sufficiently to allow most of the mechanical elements to be installed beneath it, although the engine itself intruded from the front into the central portion of the cab. The floor of the <b>load</b> <b>area</b> was just 42 cm (16 inches) above ground level, and {{it was possible for}} anyone less than 175 cm tall to stand in it without needing to stoop. Access from the driver's seat to the <b>load</b> <b>area</b> behind was excellent, especially since {{on the right side of}} the driver's cab there was normally no second seat fitted. The side door on the pavement side was a sliding door, and in this respect another radical innovation in contemporary terms. The sliding door on the right of the <b>load</b> <b>area</b> was fashioned from light-weight low cost materials. On each side of the <b>load</b> <b>area,</b> the upper side portions of the van's sides consisted tarpaulin-material curtains, incorporating little windows of flexible plastic. Again, the emphasis was on avoiding complexity, saving weight and minimising cost. On the left-side, there being here no side door, the curtain ran the full length of the <b>load</b> <b>area</b> and could be rolled up and fixed to the roof edge, revealing a load space in excess of 6 cubic meters. The overall result was a structure which combined extreme practicality with extreme simplicity. The spare wheel and battery were stored in a locker on the left side of the van, accessible from the outside but completely sealed off from the <b>load</b> <b>area.</b> Production of the van's bodywork was entrusted to a coach building firm called Fernand Genève.|$|R
40|$|Aggregated <b>load</b> <b>area</b> model (ALAM) is {{a method}} of {{modelling}} the power system load by aggregating loads within a <b>load</b> <b>area</b> to derive a simplified load model. The aggregated model will generalise a set of equivalent system parameters which are unknown and immeasurable. The paper presents three different ALAM approaches, in which different parameter identification methods are adopted, which are voltage-two-step (VTS), current-two-step (CTS) and direct-one-step (DOS) approaches. The VTS approach identifies the parameters of by adopting a voltage-matching scheme but the CTS approach using a current-matching scheme. The DOS approach identifies the parameters based on a bus-matching scheme. Theoretical explanation and analysis to the three approaches are given in the paper and simulation {{studies were carried out}} for IEEE- 14, IEEE- 57 and IEEE- 118 power systems. The three approaches are compared and an initial test on topological organisation of <b>load</b> <b>areas</b> is carried out.

40|$|In {{this study}} we compare climber {{abundance}} and size in centres of post-logging skid tracks and log <b>loading</b> <b>areas</b> to their adjacent relatively undisturbed border zones, in a selectively logged forest in the west-centre of Me d'Ivoire. We also evaluate the effect of time after logging (age) on these climber parameters. In 19 plots, 3 months to 17 years after logging we counted and measured climber individuals and shoots by species. Skid tracks and <b>loading</b> <b>areas</b> had similar abundance and size of climbers, only the densities of herbaceous species and of pioneer species were both higher in <b>loading</b> <b>areas.</b> Skid tracks had the same abundance and size of climbers as their adjacent border areas. Densities of long climbers (> 3 m length), woody species and non-pioneer species {{were higher in the}} border areas, and densities of herbaceous species and pioneer species were lower, compared to centre areas. With the exception of density of long climbers (higher in the border areas), climber abundance and size in <b>loading</b> <b>areas</b> were similar to those in their adjacent border areas. Climber species richness in skid tracks decreased with time after logging. All other climber parameters studied were not correlated with time after logging. We conclude that despite the mechanical damage in logging related areas most climbers were not much affected, and that time since logging only affects climber species richness in skid tracks.

40|$|This paper proposes {{an online}} {{steady-state}} voltage stability assessment scheme {{to evaluate the}} proximity to voltage collapse at each bus of a <b>load</b> <b>area.</b> Using a non-iterative holomorphic embedding method (HEM) with a proposed physical germ solution, an accurate loading limit at each load bus can be calculated based on online state estimation on the entire <b>load</b> <b>area</b> and a measurement-based equivalent for the external system. The HEM employs a power series to calculate an accurate Power-Voltage (P-V) curve at each load bus and accordingly evaluates the voltage stability margin considering load variations in the next period. An adaptive two-stage Pade approximants method is proposed to improve the convergence of the power series for accurate determination of the nose point on the P-V curve with moderate computational burden. The proposed method is illustrated in detail on a 4 -bus test system and then demonstrated on a <b>load</b> <b>area</b> of the Northeast Power Coordinating Council (NPCC) 48 -geneartor, 140 -bus power system.
