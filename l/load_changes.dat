25|$|The {{governor}} {{could not}} actually hold a set speed; the engine would assume a new constant speed {{in response to}} <b>load</b> <b>changes.</b> The governor was able to handle smaller variations such as those caused by fluctuating heat load to the boiler.

As a consequence, engines equipped with this governor were not suitable for operations requiring constant speed, such as cotton spinning.|$|E
