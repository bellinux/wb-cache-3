5000|$|The {{wings of}} <b>tortoiseshell</b> <b>butterflies</b> help conceal them {{extremely}} well from predators. When closed, their wings look like leaves, {{helping them to}} hide from predators. On the ground, it may take birds up to 30 minutes to see them. In addition to this, when discovered, <b>tortoiseshell</b> <b>butterflies</b> will flick their wings open to reveal bright colours. While they don’t have eyespots like many other butterflies, these bright contrasting colours can often scare a predator, giving the <b>tortoiseshell</b> <b>butterfly</b> ample time to escape. [...] Not only does this colouration tend to frighten birds, it can also act as a warning. The bright red colouration serves as a cautionary sign to the predator about the poor taste of the <b>butterfly.</b> <b>Tortoiseshell</b> <b>butterflies</b> tend to be unpalatable to birds. If a bird sees this bright red colouring, then they will {{be less likely to}} eat the butterfly.|$|R

5000|$|For most adult butterflies, {{including}} the small <b>tortoiseshell</b> <b>butterfly,</b> nectar {{is one of}} the main sources of nutrients. In order to obtain the nectar, the butterfly must be able to recognize distinct floral aromas and colours. The small <b>tortoiseshell</b> <b>butterfly</b> is able to differentiate between various flowers through visual signals. [...] <b>Tortoiseshell</b> <b>butterflies</b> in particular tend to prefer colours at both ends of the visible light spectrum for humans, 400 nm and 600 nm. [...] These correspond to the colours violet and red respectively. This ability comes from their compound eye. The flowers depend on the butterflies for pollination, so it is a mutually beneficial relationship.|$|R

5000|$|During migration, <b>tortoiseshell</b> <b>butterflies</b> {{position}} themselves {{in accordance with}} air currents; they only start migration at certain wind speeds. They {{are able to do}} this because of an extra sensory organ in their antennae. These butterflies have a developed Johnston's organ in their second antennae responsible for determining air currents {{in a number of other}} insects. [...] Because their host plants, Urtica dioica, grow in widely distributed areas, <b>tortoiseshell</b> <b>butterflies</b> tend to move around more than some other butterflies. These areas tend to be short thickets and shrubs.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Tortoiseshell</b> <b>butterflies</b> usually {{began to}} emerge from their pupa from mid-June into August. They began {{hibernation}} sometime in October and immediately show territorial behaviour after hibernation. The <b>tortoiseshell</b> <b>butterflies</b> that {{are found in the}} north usually have one brood a season, whereas further south these butterflies can have two broods. The ability to go through three generations of butterflies in a year is due to the tortoiseshell butterflies' decreased thermal requirement. The larvae of this butterfly are social. [...] These larvae can be found on Urtica dioica, which have a high nitrogen content and lots of water in the leaves.|$|R
5000|$|The small <b>tortoiseshell</b> <b>butterfly</b> {{tends to}} enter {{hibernation}} by {{mid to late}} September. [...] Typically this butterfly will try to hibernate in dark sheltered locations. Because of this hibernation, they need to accumulate a lot of fat to survive the winter. The tortoiseshell needs at least 20% of its body weight in lipids in order to survive, making them much slower. [...] Towards {{the end of their}} foraging for hibernation, they are much more susceptible to attacks by birds because of their low muscle to body mass ratio. During the first few weeks of hibernation, <b>tortoiseshell</b> <b>butterflies</b> are very susceptible to predator attacks. Up to 50% of the population hibernating in any given area can be eaten. The butterflies that hibernate in areas containing more light, and that are accessible to rodents who can climb, are the most susceptible to this type of predation. [...] During hibernation <b>tortoiseshell</b> <b>butterflies</b> are able to supercool in order to keep from freezing. In sheltered areas, these butterflies can stand up to -21 degrees Celsius without freezing. However, they experience rapid weight loss during unusually mild winters.|$|R

50|$|The small <b>tortoiseshell</b> <b>butterfly</b> is {{severely}} affected by droughts. During periods of drought, the butterfly experiences a vastly reduced reproductive rate. The drought directly affects the Urtica leaves; {{the higher the}} nitrogen and water level in the leaves, the more rapid {{the growth of the}} larvae. During a drought, both of these levels drop significantly, leaving the tortoiseshell larvae nothing to feed on. The timing of rainfall is also a crucial factor. If there is not adequate rainfall in the early summer, then the plants {{will not be able to}} fully develop, leaving the larvae without a suitable source of nutrition. These butterflies actively produce smaller broods under these conditions.|$|R
50|$|Nymphalis cyanomelas, the Mexican <b>tortoiseshell,</b> is a <b>butterfly</b> {{species in}} the family Nymphalidae. It resides from {{southern}} Mexico to El Salvador.|$|R
50|$|Most {{butterflies}} fail {{to display}} any territorial behaviour, {{probably due to}} selective environmental pressures. The female <b>tortoiseshell</b> <b>butterflies</b> generally are found in concentrated areas, so it is advantageous for males to stay in that particular area to increase their mating opportunities. Male butterflies usually bask and feed until mid-day and then display territorial behaviour until roosting. Males typically defend a certain territory for up to 90 minutes, unless they attempt to follow a female or are ousted by another male. The next day they find a new territory to defend. These territories tend to be in direct sunlight in areas that females choose to lay their eggs. More often than not, two or more males may end up sharing territory if the cost of defending the territory {{is greater than the}} benefit gained from monopolising the females.|$|R
5000|$|Males’ {{reproductive}} successes {{are often}} limited by access to mates, whereas females’ reproductive successes {{are more often}} limited by access to resources. Thus, for a given sexual encounter, it will benefit the male to mate but the female to be choosy and resist. [...] For example, male small <b>tortoiseshell</b> <b>butterfly</b> will compete {{in order to gain}} the best territory to mate. [...] Another example of this conflict {{can be found in the}} Eastern carpenter bee, Xylocopa virginica. Males of this species are limited in reproduction primarily by access to mates, so they will claim a territory and wait for a female to pass through. Big males are, therefore, more successful in mating because they claim territories near the female nesting sites that are more sought after. Smaller males, on the other hand, will monopolize less competitive sites in foraging areas so that they may mate with reduced conflict.|$|R

Three known overwintering butterflies stay as adults during the winter in the garden's man-made butterfly houses. The concept of the butterfly house was designed by the garden's original director, Bernard Jackson, who currently resides in England. The three species are known as the green comma, the mourning cloak, and Milbert's <b>tortoiseshell.</b> These <b>butterflies</b> are three of the very few butterflies that hibernate as adults during the winter.|$|R

40|$|The small <b>tortoiseshell</b> <b>butterfly</b> (Aglais urticae L.) is {{considered}} to be a widespread and abundant generalist species in Northern Europe. However, it declined sharply in the U. K. between 2003 and 2008, coinciding with the arrival and spread of a parasitoid, Sturmia bella Meig. (Diptera: Tachinidae), which specialises on nymphalid butterflies. Whether the decline in A. urticae is associated with the arrival of S. bella was investigated using data from a large-scale butterfly monitoring scheme, and by collecting larvae to assess parasitoid incidence and parasitism frequency. Similar data were compiled for a related butterfly (Inachis io) which is also parasitised by S. bella but which is not declining. Sturmia bella was recorded as far north as north Lincolnshire (53. 53 °N). Aglais urticae has declined significantly to the south of this latitude, but not to the north. Sturmia bella was present in 26 % and 15 % of the larval groups of A. urticae and I. io, respectively, and now kills more individuals of A. urticae (but not I. io) than any native parasitoid. Survival was 25 - 48 % lower in batches of A. urticae larvae where S. bella was present, indicating that S. bella causes host mortality in addition to that caused by native parasitoids. Our results suggest that S. bella may be playing a role in the recent decline of A. urticae. However, further research is needed to establish its effects relative to other potential drivers of trends in the abundance of this butterfly. © 2011 The Authors.

60|$|Mr. Lavender {{entered a}} room {{which had a}} {{considerable}} resemblance {{to the office of}} a lawyer save for the absence of tomes. It seemed furnished almost exclusively by the Minister, who sat with knees crossed, in a pair of <b>large</b> round <b>tortoiseshell</b> spectacles, which did not, however, veil the keenness of his eyes. He was a man with close cropped grey hair, a broad, yellow, clean-shaven face, and thrusting grey eyes.|$|R
60|$|In {{other parts}} of the world an exactly {{parallel}} series of facts have been observed. The Danaidæ and the Acræidæ of the Old World tropics form in fact one great group with the Heliconidæ. They have the same general form, structure, and habits: they possess the same protective odour, and are equally abundant in individuals, although not so varied in colour, blue and white spots on a black ground being the most general pattern. The insects which mimic these are chiefly Papilios, and Diadema, a genus allied to our peacock and <b>tortoiseshell</b> <b>butterflies.</b> In tropical Africa there is a peculiar group of the genus Danais, characterized by dark-brown and bluish-white colours, arranged in bands or stripes. One of these, Danais niavius, is exactly imitated both by Papilio hippocoon and by Diadema anthedon; another, Danais echeria, by Papilio cenea; and in Natal a variety of the Danais is found having a white spot at the tip of wings, accompanied by a variety of the Papilio bearing a corresponding white spot. Acræa gea is copied in its very peculiar style of colouration by the female of Papilio cynorta, by Panopæa hirce, and by the female of Elymnias phegea. Acræa euryta of Calabar has a female variety of Panopea hirce from the same place which exactly copies it; and Mr. Trimen, in his paper on Mimetic Analogies among African Butterflies, published in the Transactions of the Linnæan Society for 1868, gives a list of no less than sixteen species and varieties of Diadema and its allies, and ten of Papilio, which in their colour and markings are perfect mimics of species or varieties of Danais or Acræa which inhabit the same districts.|$|R
60|$|But {{even the}} conjectural {{explanation}} now given fails {{us in the}} other cases of local modification. Why the species of the Western islands should be smaller than those further east,--why those of Amboyna should exceed in size those of Gilolo and New Guinea--why the tailed species of India should begin to lose that appendage in the islands, and retain no trace {{of it on the}} borders of the Pacific,--and why, in three separate cases, the females of Amboyna species should be less gaily attired than the corresponding females of the surrounding islands,--are questions which we cannot at present attempt to answer. That they depend, however, on some general principle is certain, because analogous facts have been observed {{in other parts of the}} world. Mr. Bates informs me that, in three distinct groups, Papilios which on the Upper Amazon and in most other parts of South America have spotless upper wings obtain pale or white spots at Pará and on the Lower Amazon; and also that the Æneas-group of Papilios never have tails in the equatorial regions and the Amazons valley, but gradually acquire tails in many cases as they range towards the northern or southern tropic. Even in Europe we have somewhat similar facts; for the species and varieties of butterflies peculiar to the island of Sardinia are generally smaller and more deeply coloured than those of the mainland, and the same has recently been shown to be the case with the common <b>tortoiseshell</b> <b>butterfly</b> in the Isle of Man; while Papilio Hospiton, peculiar to the former island, has lost the tail, which is a prominent feature of the closely allied P. Machaon.|$|R

[25] detected up to 212  n/(cm 2  day) on Urtica leaves {{close to the edge}} of the field; however, that study has been criticised as methodologically unrepresentative [39] and biased towards excessively low values. Lang et al. [24, 40] detected daily deposition rates of up to 429  n/(cm 2  day) on slides, with significantly lower levels (31  ±  14  %) found on leaves of Daucus carota. Gathmann et al. [41] reported higher levels: up to 972  n/cm 2 on Chenopodium album and 894  n/cm 2 on Sinapis alba at a distance of 1  m from the field edge. Kawashima et al. [30] measured daily deposition rates as high as 1710  n/(cm 2  day) on slides; Shirai and Takahashi [42] recorded levels up to 624 n/(cm 2  day). During a 10 -day rainless period in Iowa, Pleasants et al. [22] found that the highest values in the field ranged from 752 to 1.449  n/cm 2 on A. syriaca leaves. In that study, however, high deposition values at aggregation zones around midribs were excluded from the risk assessment on the basis of a single personal communication [22] that young butterfly larvae do not eat midribs [22 (p. 11, 921), 43]. Lang and Otto [44] have recently reported that such a general assumption is not justified: larvae of the small <b>tortoiseshell</b> <b>butterfly</b> (Aglais urticae) have been observed to consume leaf-ribs, including midribs, although they feed on the latter to a lesser extent.|$|R
