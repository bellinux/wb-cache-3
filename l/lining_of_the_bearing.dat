5000|$|A {{bearing compass}} is a {{magnetic}} compass mounted {{in such a way}} that it allows <b>the</b> taking <b>of</b> <b>bearings</b> of objects by aligning them with <b>the</b> lubber <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> compass. A surveyor's compass is a specialized compass made to accurately measure heading of landmarks and measure horizontal angles to help with map making. These were already in common use by the early 18th century and are described in the 1728 Cyclopaedia. <b>The</b> <b>bearing</b> compass was steadily reduced in size and weight to increase portability, resulting in a model that could be carried and operated in one hand. In 1885, a patent was granted for a hand compass fitted with a viewing prism and lens that enabled the user to accurately sight <b>the</b> heading <b>of</b> geographical landmarks, thus creating the prismatic compass. [...] Another sighting method was by means of a reflective mirror. First patented in 1902, the Bézard compass consisted of a field compass with a mirror mounted above it. [...] This arrangement enabled the user to align the compass with an objective while simultaneously viewing its <b>bearing</b> in <b>the</b> mirror.|$|R

Dvije su sonde (S- 5 i S- 7) u kojima se očekivalo eventualno rasprostiranje ranosrednjovjekovnoga groblja, bile u potpunosti sterilne. U sondi S- 6 istražen je dio naselja prepoznat prijašnjih godina i evidentirano je 9 novih kulturnih tvorevina. Od toga mogu se izdvojiti tri naseobinska objekta od kojih je jedan, onaj smješten najbliže meandru, veoma dobro očuvan te je dao osnovne konstruktivne i oblikovne elemente ranosrednjovjekovnih kuća u ovom naselju otvorenog tipa. Od pokretnih nalaza iz istraženih objekata valja izdvojiti polovicu mlinskog kamena - žrvnja, brončanu karičicu, spiralni ulomak karičice, željeznu britvu, ulomke željeznih nožića te ulomak koštanog češlja. Od keramičkih nalaza pronađeni su ulomci pršljena te mnoštvo ulomaka običnih kuhinjskih lonaca i pekača. Na prikupljenim ulomcima ističu se ukrasi češljastom valovnicom na ramenima i trbusima posuda, ali i na vanjskim i unutarnjim stranama rubova jednostavnih profilacija. Sve su to odlike ranosrednjovjekovne keramike koja se uklapa u dosadašnje rezultate istraživanja. Ovo naselje prostiralo se uz sam južni rub isušenog meandra, a oblicima kuća i pokretnim nalazima, uklapa se u sliku naseljavanja poznatu u okolnim zemljama jugoistočne Europe tijekom ranoga srednjega vijeka. In {{the archaeological}} {{excavations}} conducted in 2008, three archaeological digs were opened. The overall excavated surface {{in all three}} trial trenches (S- 5, S- 6 and S- 7) was 692 m². Two trial trenches (S- 5 and S- 7), in which a possible early medieval cemetery was expected, were completely sterile. Therefore, based on the excavation results thus far, {{it can be concluded}} that the skeletal burial found in <b>the</b> archaeological excavations <b>of</b> 2005, dated with <b>the</b> help <b>of</b> <b>the</b> C 14 analysis to <b>the</b> latter half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eight century, was individual; no other burials were discovered. The cemetery was probably at another nearby, yet undefined place. Trial trench S- 6 yielded very good results. <b>The</b> continuation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> settlement excavated in past years was registered in it. A total of nine cultural formations were excavated. Among them, three residential structures can be identified, <b>of</b> which <b>the</b> one situated closest to the meander was very well preserved, and it brought about the basic construction and form elements of early medieval houses in this open-type settlement. <b>The</b> form <b>of</b> residential houses was rectangular, with an east-west orientation, with a round fireplace at <b>the</b> western side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structure. At <b>the</b> southern side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fireplace, within the structure itself, in its western part, there was a thick wooden pillar that bore some type <b>of</b> roof structure. <b>The</b> roof structure may have leaned on the structure’s eastern periphery, since a slight, round broadening was registered, without digs along <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pillar <b>bearing</b> <b>the</b> roof construction. At <b>the</b> western side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structure there was a deep fireplace, possibly with a domed construction, <b>the</b> remains <b>of</b> which collapsed into the structure further east. The form and construction elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other two, rather poorly preserved residential structures can only be assumed, since all excavated structures were very shallow, directly beneath ploughed soil, and in some parts only several centimetres were preserved. Besides residential houses, two round formations and one oval shallow formation were found; {{it is not possible to}} identify their primary function with certainty, but it is possible that they represent some auxiliary structures near the houses. Furthermore, two shallow pillars and a round, smaller formation were registered and excavated as well, also of unknown function. Among the moveable finds from the excavated structures, those worth mentioning are: half of a millstone/grindstone, a bronze ring, a spiral fragment of a ring, an iron razor, fragments of small iron knives, and a fragment of a bone comb. Out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ceramics, fragments <b>of</b> whorls were found, and numerous fragments of simple kitchen pots and baking pans. On the collected fragments, decorations with a combed wavy line on the vessel’s shoulders and bellies, but also on the outer and inner sides of simple-profiled brims stand out. All of these are characteristics of early medieval pottery which fit well in the excavation results thus far. The excessively large surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> archaeological digs in S- 5, S- 6 and S- 7 of approximately 700 m² was excavated this year, which – along with the approximately 208 m² of S- 4, opened in 2007, with no archaeological finds in the southern zones, leads to the conclusion that the medieval settlement extended along <b>the</b> southern periphery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> meander, and that in <b>the</b> follow-up <b>of</b> <b>the</b> excavations trial trenches should be dug directly along the old, dried-out branch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Drava River. <b>The</b> selection <b>of</b> settlement positions along old meanders and river beds, and the square or rectangular shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structures comply with <b>the</b> picture <b>of</b> settlements known in other nearby South-east European countries in the Early Middle Ages...|$|R

On <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conducted studies it was stated that <b>the</b> main cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> damage to  <b>the</b> pitch surfaces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bearings</b> is <b>the</b> excessive load <b>of</b> rolling elements. Based on <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conducted analysis, actions limiting <b>the</b> occurrence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> damage to <b>the</b> pitch surfaces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bearings,</b> which lead to their premature exchange, have been proposed. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> suggested actions, limiting <b>the</b> premature exchange <b>of</b> <b>bearings,</b> is <b>the</b> necessity <b>of</b> exceptionally thorough design and selection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slewing <b>bearings,</b> including <b>the</b> conditions <b>of</b> their foundatio...|$|R
40|$|Hydrodynamically air-lubricated foil journal {{bearings}} are prospective applicants for machine elements that can support a small-sized rotor of high-speed rotary machinery, {{such as a}} micro gas turbine. <b>The</b> smooth surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> deforms elastically, depending on an applied bearing load, since it is a flexible foil that is supported elastically. Bump foil journal bearing is a kind <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bearings.</b> <b>The</b> <b>bearing</b> consists <b>of</b> two foils. One is cylindrical and named as a top foil. The other is corrugated and named as a bump foil. The top foil is supported elastically by the bump foil. As the foils are forced into <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> sleeve in assembling <b>the</b> <b>bearing,</b> <b>the</b> top foil deforms due to the assembly preload from the bump foil. The previous prediction was conducted without the preload being considered. This study aims at predicting the maximum load capacity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> with <b>the</b> preload, by using two models. One corresponds to <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> with an infinitely static friction between the two foils {{and the other to}} <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> without <b>the</b> friction. It is found that each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bearing</b> design variables has an effect on the capacity obtained with the preload being considered...|$|R
