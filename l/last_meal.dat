5|$|Corythosaurus was an ornithopod, and {{therefore}} a herbivore. Benson et al. (2012) realized that the beak of Corythosaurus was shallow and delicate, and concluded {{that it must have}} been used to feed upon soft vegetation. Based on the climate of the Late Cretaceous, they guessed that Corythosaurus would have been a selective feeder, eating only the juiciest fruits and youngest leaves. Corythosaurus specimens have been preserved with its <b>last</b> <b>meal</b> in its chest cavity. Inside the cavity were remains of conifer needles, seeds, twigs, and fruits, meaning that Corythosaurus probably fed on all of these.|$|E
5|$|Around AD 30, Jesus and his {{followers}} traveled from Galilee to Jerusalem to observe Passover. Jesus caused a disturbance in the Second Temple, which {{was the center of}} Jewish religious and civil authority. Sanders associates it with Jesus' prophecy that the Temple would be totally demolished. Jesus had a <b>last</b> <b>meal</b> with his disciples, which is the origin of the Christian sacrament of bread and wine. Jesus' words are recorded in the Synoptics and in Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians. The differences in the accounts cannot be completely reconciled, and {{it is impossible to know}} what Jesus intended, but in general the meal seems to point forward to the coming Kingdom. Jesus probably expected to be killed, and he may have hoped that God would intervene.|$|E

5|$|Corythosaurus {{is known}} from many {{complete}} specimens, including the nearly complete holotype found by Brown in 1911. The holotype skeleton is only missing {{the last section}} of the tail, {{and part of the}} forelimbs, but was preserved with impressions of polygonal scales. Corythosaurus is known from many skulls with tall crests. The crests resemble the crests of the cassowary and a Corinthian helmet. The most likely function of the crest is thought to be vocalization. As in a trombone, sound waves would travel through many chambers in the crest, and then get amplified when Corythosaurus exhaled. A Corythosaurus specimen has been preserved with its <b>last</b> <b>meal</b> in its chest cavity. Inside the cavity were remains of conifer needles, seeds, twigs, and fruits: Corythosaurus probably fed on all of these.|$|E
5|$|Lindow Man's <b>last</b> <b>meal</b> was {{preserved}} {{in his stomach}} and intestines and was analysed in some detail. It was hoped that investigations into {{the contents of the}} stomach would shed light on the contemporary diet, {{as was the case with}} Grauballe Man and Tollund Man in the 1950s. The analysis of the contents of the digestive system of bog bodies had become one of the principal endeavours of investigating such remains. Analysis of the grains present revealed his diet to be mostly of cereals. He probably ate slightly charred bread, although the burning may have had ritual significance rather than being an accident. Some mistletoe pollen was also found in the stomach, indicating that Lindow Man died in March or April.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of death, Lindow Man was a healthy male in his mid-20s, {{and he may have}} been someone of high status, as his body shows little {{evidence}} of heavy or rough work. There has been debate over the reason for Lindow Man's death, for the nature of his demise was violent, perhaps ritualistic; after a <b>last</b> <b>meal</b> of charred bread, Lindow Man was strangled, hit on the head, and his throat cut. Dating the body has proven problematic, but it is thought that Lindow Man was deposited into Lindow Moss, face down, some time between 2 BC and 119AD, in either the Iron Age or Romano-British period. The body has been preserved by freeze-drying and is on permanent display at the British Museum, although it occasionally travels to other venues such as the Manchester Museum.|$|E
50|$|Before his {{execution}} Brewer ordered a large meal that included two chicken fried steaks, a triple-meat bacon cheeseburger, {{a large bowl}} of fried okra, a pound of barbecue, three fajitas, a meat lover's pizza, a pint of ice cream, and a slab of peanut butter fudge with lots of crushed peanuts. However he did not eat any {{of it and the}} meal was discarded, prompting Texas prison officials to end the 87-year-old tradition of giving special <b>last</b> <b>meals</b> to condemned inmates.|$|R

5|$|The fossils {{found in}} {{abundance}} along this coastline {{provide evidence of}} how animals and plants evolved in this region. During the Triassic this area was a desert, while in the Jurassic {{it was part of}} a tropical sea, and in the Cretaceous it was covered by swamps. The fossilised remains of the animals and plants that lived in those periods are very well preserved, providing a wealth of information on their body shapes, the way they died and even the fossilised remains of their <b>last</b> <b>meals.</b> Fossil groups found here include crustaceans, insects, molluscs, echinoderms, fish, amphibians, reptiles and a few mammals. At Lulworth Cove there is a fossil forest of conifers, tree-ferns and cycads.|$|R
5|$|Scully {{tells her}} {{version of the story}} via a {{flashback}} to the previous day. She arrives at work and Mulder tells her about a murder in Texas, which he believes to be the work of vampires. In her version, Mulder is exuberant, insensitive, and irritating, while she is calm and mindful of her thoughts. The agents travel to the small town of Chaney, Texas where they meet Sheriff Hartwell (Luke Wilson), whom Scully finds highly charming. Mulder and Hartwell leave to investigate further while Scully autopsies the body. She discovers that the victim, whose <b>last</b> <b>meal</b> had been pizza, was incapacitated with chloral hydrate. She returns to the motel room and orders a pizza, but Mulder soon appears and sends her back to autopsy another body. She leaves him just as her food is delivered. When she finds that the second victim had also ingested chloral hydrate in a pizza, she realizes Mulder is in danger and returns to the motel room. She finds him about to be attacked by the pizza delivery boy, Ronnie Strickland (Patrick Renna). She shoots at Ronnie, who runs off into the woods. When she catches up to him, Mulder has gotten there first and hammered a stake into Ronnie's heart.|$|E

60|$|But at <b>last</b> the <b>meal</b> was ended, and the Earl {{washed his}} hands and his mouth and his beard from a silver basin of scented water held by {{another one of the}} squires. Then, leaning back against the pillows, he beckoned to Myles.|$|R
60|$|The <b>meal</b> <b>lasted</b> {{for some}} time longer, for Reuben Hawkshaw was a good trencherman, and one not given to hurrying himself, unless there was need; and neither {{of the other men}} were far behind their chief, in the matter of the stowage of victuals. But at <b>last</b> the <b>meal</b> was done, and the trenchers were carried off. The {{earthenware}} mugs were again filled with cider, and then Reuben Hawkshaw--sitting {{at one end of the}} table, with Roger facing him, and the mates one on either hand--threw himself back in his settle, which he used in right of captaincy, while the others contented themselves with stools, and began.|$|R
60|$|At <b>last</b> the <b>meal</b> was ready. Lilly {{drew the}} curtains, {{switched}} off the central light, put the green-shaded electric lamp on the table, {{and the two men}} drew up to the meal. It was good food, well cooked and hot. Certainly Lilly's hands were no longer clean: but it was clean dirt, as he said.|$|R
25|$|The {{stomach and}} {{intestines}} were examined and tests {{carried out on}} their contents. Scientists identified the man's <b>last</b> <b>meal</b> as porridge or gruel made from grains and seeds, both cultivated and wild. Approximately 40 kinds of seeds were identified, but the porridge was primarily composed of four types: barley, flax, false flax (Camelina sativa) and knotgrass. From the stage of digestion {{it was concluded that}} the man had eaten 12 to 24 hours prior to his death. Porridges were common for people of this time. Because neither meat nor fresh fruit was found in the <b>last</b> <b>meal,</b> it is suggested that the meal was eaten in winter or early spring when these items were not available.|$|E
25|$|Several {{states also}} allow victims' {{families}} and relatives {{selected by the}} prisoner to watch executions. An hour or two before the execution, the condemned is offered religious services and to choose his <b>last</b> <b>meal</b> (except in Texas which abolished it in 2011).|$|E

25|$|According to the Mahaparinibbana Sutta of the Pali canon, {{at the age}} of 80, the Buddha {{announced}} that he would soon reach Parinirvana, or the final deathless state, and abandon his earthly body. After this, the Buddha ate his <b>last</b> <b>meal,</b> which he had received as an offering from a blacksmith named Cunda. Falling violently ill, Buddha instructed his attendant Ānanda to convince Cunda that the meal eaten at his place {{had nothing to do with}} his passing and that his meal would be a source of the greatest merit as it provided the <b>last</b> <b>meal</b> for a Buddha. Mettanando and von Hinüber argue that the Buddha died of mesenteric infarction, a symptom of old age, rather than food poisoning.|$|E
25|$|Episode 3 of {{the second}} series of The Doctor Blake Mysteries, A Foreign Field draws heavily on the case.

25|$|The {{death penalty}} is carried out by hanging in an {{execution}} chamber within the detention centre. When an execution order has been issued, the condemned prisoner is informed {{in the morning of}} their execution. The condemned is given a choice of the <b>last</b> <b>meal.</b> The prisoner's family and legal representatives, and also the general public, are informed only afterwards. Since 7 December 2007, the authorities have been releasing the names, natures of crime, and ages of executed prisoners.|$|E

60|$|As the {{darkness}} thickened, the electric lamps were switched {{on and the}} whole courtyard turned blue-white with black velvet shadows.

25|$|On {{the morning}} of May 9, 1994, Gacy was {{transferred}} from the Menard Correctional Center to Stateville Correctional Center in Crest Hill to be executed. That afternoon, he was allowed a private picnic on the prison grounds with his family. For his <b>last</b> <b>meal,</b> Gacy ordered a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken, a dozen fried shrimp, french fries, fresh strawberries, and a Diet Coke. That evening, he observed prayer with a Catholic priest before being escorted to the Stateville execution chamber to receive a lethal injection.|$|E
25|$|Two {{days prior}} to the execution, a letter written by Saddam {{appeared}} on the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party website. In the letter, he urged the Iraqi people to unite, and not to hate the people of countries that invaded Iraq, like the United States, but instead the decision-makers. He said {{he was ready to}} die as a martyr and he said that this is his death sentence. In the hours before the execution, Saddam ate his <b>last</b> <b>meal</b> of chicken and rice with a cup of hot water and honey.|$|E
25|$|Alternative {{theories}} of the murders, supposedly shared by Simpson, have suggested they were related to drug trafficking in the Los Angeles area, and that Michael Nigg, a friend of Goldman and a fellow Mezzaluna waiter was as well. Simpson himself has stated in numerous interviews that he believes the two had been killed over their involvement in drug dealing in the area, and that other murders {{at the time were}} carried out for the same reason. Brown, her former husband believed, had been planning to open a restaurant of her own using proceeds from cocaine sales. Mezzaluna Trattoria, where she ate her <b>last</b> <b>meal,</b> and where both Nigg and Goldman had worked, was reportedly a nexus for drug trafficking in Brentwood.|$|E
50|$|The Mallas are {{frequently}} mentioned in Buddhist and Jain works. They were a powerful people dwelling in Northern South Asia. According to Mahabharata, Panduputra Bhimasena {{is said to}} have conquered the chief of the Mallas/Malls {{in the course of his}} expedition in Eastern India. During the Buddhist period, the Mallas/Malls Kshatriya were a republican people with their dominion consisting of nine territories corresponding to the nine confederated clans. These republican states were known as Gana. Two of these confederations - one with Kuśināra (modern Kasia near Gorakhpur) as its capital and the second with Pava (modern Padrauna, 12 miles from Kasia) as the capital - had become very important at the time of Buddha. Kuśināra and Pava are very important in the history of Buddhism and Jainism since Buddha and Lord Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankara took their <b>last</b> <b>meals</b> at Kushinara and Pava/Pavapuri respectively. Buddha was taken ill at Pava and died at Kusinara, whereas lord Mahavira took his Nirvana at Pavapuri. It is widely believed that Lord Gautam died at the courtyard of King Sastipal Mall of Kushinagar/Kushinara. Kushinagar is now the centre of the Buddhist pilgrimage circle which is being developed by the tourism development corporation of Uttar Pradesh.|$|R
60|$|Now {{all that}} was pure acting. A lynx likes beaver meat better than {{anything}} else; and this fellow had caught some of the colony, no doubt, in the well-fed autumn days, as they worked on their dam and houses. Sharp hunger made him remember them as he came through the wood on his nightly hunt after hares. He knew well that the beavers were safe; that months of intense cold had made their two-foot mud walls like granite. But he came, nevertheless, just to pretend he had caught one, and to remember how good his <b>last</b> full <b>meal</b> smelled when he ate it in October.|$|R
60|$|She {{followed}} him without a word. She seemed, indeed, {{like a person}} dreaming, not wholly able to realize the things happening around her, even the moments that passed. Deane waited upon her at breakfast, and talked in a matter-of-fact way, accepting her monosyllabic answers as natural things,--carrying on a conversation, too, {{with the man who}} waited at the sideboard. By degrees, a more natural expression came into her face. When at <b>last</b> the <b>meal</b> was over and the servant had left the room, she burst suddenly into tears. Deane took her outside and placed her in a chair, sitting by her side on the sands.|$|R
