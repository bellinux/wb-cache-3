5|$|After the Second World War, Māori were {{discouraged}} from speaking {{their own language}} (te reo Māori) in schools and workplaces and it existed as a community language only in a few remote areas. It has recently undergone a process of revitalisation, being declared one of New Zealand's official languages in 1987, and is spoken by 3.7% of the population. There are now Māori <b>language</b> <b>immersion</b> schools and two television channels that broadcast predominantly in Māori.

5|$|Initially, the Māori {{language}} (te reo Māori) {{was permitted}} in native schools to facilitate English instruction, {{but as time}} went on official attitudes hardened against any use of the language. Māori were discouraged from speaking their own language in schools and work places and it existed as a community language only in a few remote areas. The language underwent a revival beginning in the 1970s, and now more people speak Māori. The future of the language {{was the subject of a}} claim before the Waitangi Tribunal in 1985. As a result, Māori was declared an official language in 1987. In the 2013 census, 21.3percent of Māori people—and 3.7percent of all respondents, including some non-Māori people—reported conversational fluency in the language. There are now Māori <b>language</b> <b>immersion</b> schools and two Māori Television channels, the only nationwide television channels to have the majority of their prime-time content delivered in Māori. Many places have officially been given dual Māori and English names in recent years.|$|E
5|$|Maud W. Gordon Elementary School in Bellaire {{does not}} have a zoning boundary; before 2012 it drew excess {{students}} from apartments west of Bellaire, in Houston, to relieve other schools in Houston west of Bellaire such as Benavidez, Cunningham, Elrod, and Milne. From its opening to 1953 to 1983 Gordon served as a neighborhood school. After its closure Gordon temporarily housed the Post Oak School and later served as administrative offices. It re-opened as a relief school in 1988 for Elrod and Cunningham schools. It was scheduled to re-open in September of that year. In 2012 HISD opened the Mandarin Chinese <b>Language</b> <b>Immersion</b> Magnet School Chinese language-immersion magnet school, in the former Gordon Elementary building. It is HISD's first Chinese immersion school. The school was scheduled to move to the St. George Place area of Houston; it was scheduled to open in August 2016. In 2017 HISD announced plans to demolish the Gordon/former MIMS campus so Bellaire High School's baseball practice field could be relocated there, allowing HISD to easily rebuild the high school main campus.|$|E

40|$|<b>Immersion</b> <b>language</b> education, {{originally}} developed in Canada, {{is one of}} the most thoroughly researched areas of second language acquisition. Its proven utility in producing high levels of second language competence while simultaneously supporting first language academic development has resulted in its widespread popularity and adoption in bilingual education programs around the world. The spread of the <b>immersion</b> <b>language</b> education model has also extended to Japan, where due to the successful results of pioneer immersion programs, many schools are now considering it as an alternative. Due to a current push for English education reform in Japan, particularly towards the promotion of communicative competence, the <b>immersion</b> <b>language</b> education model represents an alternative worthy of consideration for adoption.

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an overview of}} immersion pedagogy and how it has developed {{over the years in}} conjunction with classroom research and evolving classroom practices.

We then review classroom research investigating various pedagogical means of enhancing immersion students’ metalinguistic awareness through form-focused instruction, corrective feedback, and cross-lingual pedagogy. We conclude with questions and issues for future research and development in the realm of immersion pedagogy...|$|R

25|$|To evade a {{shift to}} English, some Native American tribes have {{initiated}} <b>language</b> <b>immersion</b> schools for children, where a native Indian language is the medium of instruction. For example, the Cherokee Nation instigated a 10-year language preservation plan that involved growing new fluent speakers of the Cherokee language from childhood on up through school immersion {{programs as well as}} a collaborative community effort to continue to use the language at home. This plan was part of an ambitious goal that in 50 years, 80% or more of the Cherokee people will be fluent in the language. The Cherokee Preservation Foundation has invested $3 million into opening schools, training teachers, and developing curricula for language education, as well as initiating community gatherings where the language can be actively used. Formed in 2006, the Kituwah Preservation & Education Program (KPEP) on the Qualla Boundary focuses on <b>language</b> <b>immersion</b> programs for children from birth to fifth grade, developing cultural resources for the general public and community language programs to foster the Cherokee language among adults.|$|E
