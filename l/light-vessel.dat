25|$|On 31 May 1958 Henry Blogg {{took part}} in an unusual rescue when she was called to aid the Sheringham {{lifeboat}} Forester's Centenary. This service began with a call at 9.50am to the Sheringham honorary secretary from the Trinity House Superintendent of Great Yarmouth requesting that a sick man {{be taken off the}} Dudgeon <b>Light-vessel.</b> At 10.15am the Sheringham lifeboat Forester's Centenary was launched with a doctor on board and she reached the <b>light-vessel</b> by 1.10pm. The doctor went aboard the <b>light-vessel</b> and dispensed a sedative to the sick man and he was then strapped to a stretcher and transferred to the Forester's Centenary. The lifeboat then set off on the return journey to her station. Nine miles north east from home at around 4.40pm the Forester's Centenary was in trouble when her skew gear which drives the lifeboat's oil and water pumps broke down. Henry Blogg was called out and had to take the Sheringham lifeboat in to tow. Both boats arrived back at the Sheringham station at 7.00pm and the sick man was taken to hospital.|$|E
60|$|Now {{the time}} for action had come. The Goodwin <b>light-vessel,</b> being nearest to the wrecks, fired a signal-gun and sent up a rocket.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mum's {{the word}} for three minutes," [...] said Dick, {{pointing}} to a huge Yankee clock which stood on the chimney-piece, with a model frigate in a glass case, and a painted sea and sky {{on one side of}} it, and a model <b>light-vessel</b> in a glass case, and a painted sea and sky on the other.|$|E
25|$|Lighthouse keepers {{who served}} under the three Lighthouse Authorities and keepers of <b>Light-Vessels</b> under those authorities, {{who did not}} qualify for the 1939-1945 Star.|$|R
6000|$|It was a calm sunny evening, {{about the}} end of autumn, when the Trinity tender, having {{effected}} [...] "the relief" [...] of the old Gull, left her in order to perform the same service for her sister <b>light-vessels.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Not often," [...] replied Jim. [...] "Considering the {{constancy}} {{of their}} exposure {{to all sorts of}} weather, and the number of <b>light-vessels</b> afloat, it is amazin' how few accidents take place. There has been nothing of the kind as long as I can remember anything about the service, but my father has told me of a case where one of the <b>light-vessels</b> that marked a channel {{at the mouth of the}} Thames once broke adrift in a heavy gale. She managed to bring up again with her spare anchor, but did not dare to show her light, being out of her proper place, and therefore, a false guide. The consequence was that eight vessels, which were making for the channel, and counted on seeing her, went on the sands and were lost with nearly all hands." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{the great}} work {{of that night}} still {{remained}} to be done. Not far from the <b>light-vessel</b> a flare-light was seen burning brightly. It seemed to be well tended, and was often renewed. Towards this the tug now steered with the little sister in tow. They soon came near enough to observe {{that she was a}} large ship, going to pieces on the sands.|$|E
60|$|These sand-sharks (if we may {{be allowed}} the expression) {{separate}} the main channels, which are named respectively the Swin or King's channel, on the north, and the Prince's, the Queen's, and the South channels, on the south. The channel through which the Nora passed was the Swin, which, though not used by first-class ships, {{is perhaps the most}} frequented by the greater portion of the coasting and colliery vessels, and all the east country craft. The traffic is so great as to be almost continuous; innumerable vessels being seen in fine weather passing to and fro {{as far as the eye}} can reach. To mark this channel alone there was, at the time we write of, the Mouse <b>light-vessel,</b> at the western extremity of the Mouse sand; the Maplin lighthouse, on the sand of the same name; the Swin middle <b>light-vessel,</b> at the western extremity of the Middle and Heaps sand; the Whittaker beacon, and the Sunk <b>light-vessel</b> on the Sunk sand--besides other beacons and numerous buoys. When we add that floating lights and beacons cost thousands and hundreds of pounds to build, and that even buoys are valued in many cases at more than a hundred pounds each, besides the cost of maintenance, it may be conceived that the great work of lighting and buoying the channels of the kingdom--apart from the light-house system altogether--is one of considerable expense, constant anxiety, and vast national importance. It may also be conceived that the Elder Brethren of the Corporation of Trinity House--by whom, from the time of Henry VIII down to the present day, that arduous duty has been admirably performed--hold a position of the highest responsibility.|$|E
60|$|As they {{ploughed}} {{through the}} foam together, the tug was frequently obliged to ease-steam and give herself {{time to recover}} from the shock of those heavy cross seas. Suddenly a bright flaring light was observed in the vicinity of a shoal called the Break, which lies between the Goodwins and the shore. It went out in a few seconds, but not before the master of the tug had taken its bearings and altered his course. At the same time signal-guns and rockets were observed, both from the North sandhead <b>light-vessel</b> and the Gull, and several flaring lights were also seen burning on or near the Goodwin sands.|$|E
60|$|The <b>light-vessels</b> {{belonging}} to the Corporation are 43 in number: 38 in position and 5 in reserve to meet casualties. [See note 2.] Of lighthouses there are 76; sixty-one of which, built of brick, stone, or timber, are on shore; eleven, of granite, are on outlying rocks; and four, on iron piles, are on sandbanks. There are 452 buoys of {{all shapes and sizes}} on the coast, and half as many more in reserve, besides about 60 beacons of various kinds, and 21 storehouses in connection with them. Also 6 steam-vessels and 7 sailing tenders maintained for effecting the periodical relief of crews and keepers, shifting and laying buoys, etcetera.|$|R
6000|$|This tale, reader--if {{you read}} it through--will give you {{some insight into the}} condition, value, and vicissitudes of the <b>light-vessels,</b> or {{floating}} lighthouses, which guard the shores of this kingdom, and mark the dangerous shoals lying off some of our harbours and roadsteads. It will also convey to you--if you don't skip--a general idea of the life and adventures of some of the men who have manned these interesting and curious craft in time past, as well as give you some account of the sayings and doings of several other personages more or less connected with our coasts. May {{you read it}} with pleasure and profit, and--"may your shadow never be less." ...|$|R
6000|$|The tender was now {{bearing down}} on one of the {{numerous}} buoys which mark off the channels around the Goodwin sands, and it required careful steering in order to avoid missing it on the one hand, or running into it on the other. A number of men stood on the bow of the vessel, with ropes and boat-hooks, in readiness to catch and make fast to it. These men, with the exception of two or three who formed the permanent crew of the tender, were either going off to [...] "relieve" [...] their comrades and take their turn on board the floating lights, or {{were on their way to}} land, having been [...] "relieved"--such as George Welton the mate, Dick Moy, and Jerry MacGowl. Among them were several masters and mates belonging to the <b>light-vessels</b> of that district--sedate, grave, cheerful, and trustworthy men, all of them--who had spent the greater part of their lives in the service, and were by that time middle-aged or elderly, but still, with few exceptions, as strong and hardy as young men.|$|R
6000|$|The {{mate and}} men rushed on deck {{in time to}} see a large ship pass close to the bow of the Gull. Jack had cast loose the tiller, because, {{although}} in ordinary circumstances the helm of a <b>light-vessel</b> is of no use, {{this was one of the}} few occasions in which it could be of service. The rush of the tide past a ship at anchor confers upon it at all times, except during [...] "slack water" [...] (i.e., when the tide is on the turn), the power of steering, so that she can be made to sheer swiftly to port or starboard, as may be required. But for this power, floating lights would undoubtedly be run into more frequently than they are.|$|E
60|$|I gratefully {{express my}} {{acknowledgment}} and tender my best {{thanks to the}} Elder Brethren of the Trinity House, to whose kindness I am indebted for having been permitted {{to spend a week}} on board the Gull-stream <b>light-vessel,</b> one of the three floating-lights which mark the Goodwin Sands; and to Robin Allen, Esquire, Secretary to the Trinity House, who has kindly furnished me with valuable books, papers, and information. I have also gratefully to tender my best thanks to Captain Valle, District Superintendent under the Trinity House at Ramsgate, for the ready and extremely kind manner in which he afforded me every facility for visiting the various light-vessels and buoys of his district, and for observing the nature and duties of the service.|$|E
60|$|It takes {{courts of}} inquiry,--formed of {{competent}} men, who examine competent witnesses {{and have the}} counsel of competent seamen,--many days of anxious investigation {{to arrive at the}} precise knowledge of the when, how, and wherefore of a wreck. We do not, therefore, pretend {{to be able to say}} whether it was the fault of the captain, the pilot, the man at the lead, the steersman, the look-out, or the weather, that the good ship Wellington met her doom. All that we know for certain is, that she sighted the southern <b>light-vessel</b> some time before midnight during the great gale, that she steered what was supposed to be her true course, and that, shortly after, she struck on the tail of the sands.|$|E
60|$|We {{leave to}} hard-headed {{politicians}} to say what, or whether, improvements {{of any kind}} might be made {{in connection with the}} Trinity Corporation. We do not pretend to be competent to judge whether or not that work might be better done. All that we pretend to {{is a certain amount of}} competency to judge, and right to assert, that it is well done, and one of the easiest ways to assure one's-self of that fact is, to go visit the lighthouses and <b>light-vessels</b> on the coast, and note their perfect management; the splendid adaptation of scientific discoveries to the ends they are designed to serve; the thoroughness, the cleanliness, the beauty of everything connected with the materiel employed; the massive solidity and apparent indestructibility of the various structures erected and afloat; the method everywhere observable; the perfect organisation and the steady respectability of the light-keepers--observe and note all these things, we say, and it will be impossible to return from the investigation without a feeling that the management of this department of our coast service is in pre-eminently able hands.|$|R
60|$|The Narcissus, heeling over to {{off-shore}} gusts, {{rounded the}} South Foreland, {{passed through the}} Downs, and, in tow, entered the river. Shorn of the glory of her white wings, she wound obediently after the tug {{through the maze of}} invisible channels. As she passed them the red-painted <b>light-vessels,</b> swung at their moorings, seemed for an instant to sail with great speed in the rush of tide, and the next moment were left hopelessly behind. The big buoys on the tails of banks slipped past her sides very low, and, dropping in her wake, tugged at their chains like fierce watchdogs. The reach narrowed; from both sides the land approached the ship. She went steadily up the river. On the riverside slopes the houses appeared in groups--seemed to stream down the declivities at a run to see her pass, and, checked by the mud of the foreshore, crowded on the banks. Further on, the tall factory chimneys appeared in insolent bands and watched her go by, like a straggling crowd of slim giants, swaggering and upright under the black plummets of smoke, cavalierly aslant. She swept round the bends; an impure breeze shrieked a welcome between her stripped spars; and the land, closing in, stepped between the ship and the sea.|$|R
6000|$|... "There was one occasion," [...] {{said the}} mate, [...] "when I {{had a tough}} set-to with a bird, {{something}} like what you have had to-night, youngster. I was stationed {{at the time in}} the Newarp <b>light-vessel,</b> off the Norfolk coast. It happened not long after the light had gone up. I observed a very large bird settle {{on the roof of the}} lantern, so I went cautiously up, hopin' it would turn out a good one to eat, because you must know we don't go catchin' these birds for mere pastime. We're very glad to get 'em to eat; and I can assure you the larks make excellent pies. Well, I raised my head slowly above the lantern and pounced on it. Instantly its claws went deep into my hands. I seized its neck, and tried to choke it; but the harder I squeezed, the harder it nipped, until I was forced to sing out for help. Leavin' go the neck, in order to have one hand free, I descended the ladder with the bird hanging to the other hand by its claws. I found I had no occasion to hold tight to it, for it held tight to me! Before I got down, however, it had recovered a bit, let go, and flew away, but took refuge soon after in the lantern-house on deck. Here I caught it a second time, and once more received the same punishment from its claws. I killed it at last, and then found, to my disgust, that it was a monster sparrow-hawk, and not fit for food!" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{shore in}} these wild regions {{was not like}} the shore elsewhere. Firm as it looked, the garden {{ground in front of}} the reed-cutter's cottage was {{floating}} ground, that rose and fell and oozed into puddles under the pressure of the foot. The boatmen who guided the visitors warned them to keep to the path, and pointed through gaps in the reeds and pollards to grassy places, on which strangers would have walked confidently, where the crust of earth was not strong enough to bear the weight of a child over the unfathomed depths of slime and water beneath. The solitary cottage, built of planks pitched black, stood on ground that had been steadied and strengthened by resting it on piles. A little wooden tower rose {{at one end of the}} roof, and served as a lookout post in the fowling season. From this elevation the eye ranged far and wide over a wilderness of winding water and lonesome marsh. If the reed-cutter had lost his boat, he would have been as completely isolated from all communication with town or village as if his place of abode had been a <b>light-vessel</b> instead of a cottage. Neither he nor his family complained of their solitude, or looked in any way the rougher or the worse for it. His wife received the visitors hospitably, in a snug little room, with a raftered ceiling, and windows which looked like windows in a cabin on board ship. His wife's father told stories of the famous days when the smugglers came up from the sea at night, rowing through the net-work of rivers with muffled oars till they gained the lonely Broads, and sank their spirit casks in the water, far from the coast-guard's reach. His wild little children played at hide-and-seek with the visitors; and the visitors ranged in and out of the cottage, and round and round the morsel of firm earth on which it stood, surprised and delighted by the novelty of all they saw. The one person who noticed the advance of the evening--the one person who thought of the flying time and the stationary Pentecosts in the boat--was young Pedgift. That experienced pilot of the Broads looked askance at his watch, and drew Allan aside at the first opportunity.|$|E

50|$|The present {{lighthouse}} {{was erected}} in 1908, {{but the first}} proposal to build a lighthouse here was made in 1825 by Trinity House. The lighthouse replaces a <b>light-vessel</b> previously moored {{in the south of}} Cardigan Bay. The lighthouse is similar in construction to Skokholm Lighthouse and is among the last lighthouses to be built in Britain.|$|E
50|$|The Norderney {{was built}} in 1949 as the MV HH 294 Paul J Müller in Hamburg-Finkenwerder. This 50 meter long trawler was in service as fishing-vessel in the waters around Island from 1950 until 1956 and in July of that year it was sold to the Niedersächsische Hochseefischerei GmbH. (Lower Saxony deepsea fishing Ltd.) and was re-christened as NC 420 NorderneyIn 1960 the then 11-year-old vessel was sold to a Dutch company for scrapping. In early 1964 the {{brothers}} Verweij bought the ship. The 3 brothers formed the management of Radio Veronica. The Norderney was bought to replace the former German lightvessel Borkum Riff from 1911 as that vessel was completely worn-out and also {{a little bit to}} small to continue to be operated as a radio ship. As (former) <b>light-vessel</b> the Borkum Riff had her name printed in large letters on the hull of the ship: this idea was copied on the Norderney, even though she wasn't a light-ship.|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we have {{investigated}} air-sea exchanges in the Belgian coastal area located in the Southern Bight of the North Sea. Since 1980 the tropospheric aerosol contents for the trace elements Cd, Cu, Mn, Pb, Zn and for the reference elements Al, Fe, Na have been monitored on an intermittent basis from a maritime sampling platform (<b>Light-Vessel</b> West-Hinder; position: 51 ° 23. 5 'N- 2 ° 21. 5 'E, fig. 1). During 1981 sampling campaigns at sea were paralleled by sampling campaigns on land, in the coastal area (natural reserve De Blankaert, located at 20 Km inland), {{in order to allow}} for a better evaluation of the specific source or sink role of the sea. No major source of pollution exists between the maritime and the continental sampling sites. During these simultaneous land-sea campaigns dry deposition and rainwater were sampled, besides aerosols. Furthermore, the sea surface microlayer and the water column {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>Light-Vessel</b> were investigated for possible enrichments and in order to allow an estimation of the resuspension flux...|$|E
