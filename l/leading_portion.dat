60|$|A {{hundred other}} infirmities or {{shortcomings}} in a {{people might be}} pointed out which pro tanto disqualify them from making {{the best use of}} representative government; but in regard to these it is not equally obvious that the government of One or a Few would have any tendency to cure or alleviate the evil. Strong prejudices of any kind; obstinate adherence to old habits; positive defects of national character, or mere ignorance, and deficiency of mental cultivation, if prevalent in a people, will be in general faithfully reflected in their representative assemblies; and should it happen that the executive administration, the direct management of public affairs, {{is in the hands of}} persons comparatively free from these defects, more good would frequently be done by them when not hampered by the necessity of carrying with them the voluntary assent of such bodies. But the mere position of the rulers does not in these, as it does in the other cases which we have examined, of itself invest them with interests and tendencies operating in the beneficial direction. From the general weaknesses of the people or of the state of civilization, the One and his councillors, or the Few, are not likely to be habitually exempt; except in the case of their being foreigners, belonging to a superior people or a more advanced state of society. Then, indeed, the rulers may be, to almost any extent, superior in civilization to those over whom they rule; and subjection to a foreign government of this description, notwithstanding its inevitable evils, is often of the greatest advantage to a people, carrying them rapidly through several stages of progress, and clearing away obstacles to improvement which might have lasted indefinitely if the subject population had been left unassisted to its native tendencies and chances. In a country not under the dominion of foreigners, the only cause adequate to producing similar benefits is the rare accident of a monarch of extraordinary genius. There have been in history a few of these who, happily for humanity, have reigned long enough to render some of their improvements permanent, by leaving them under the guardianship of a generation which had grown up under their influence. Charlemagne may be cited as one instance; Peter the Great is another. Such examples however are so unfrequent that they can only be classed with the happy accidents which have so often decided at a critical moment whether some <b>leading</b> <b>portion</b> of humanity should make a sudden start, or sink back towards barbarism--chances like the existence of Themistocles at the time of the Persian invasion, or of the first or third William of Orange. It would be absurd to construct institutions for the mere purpose of taking advantage of such possibilities, especially as men of this calibre, in any distinguished position, do not require despotic power to enable them to exert great influence, as is evidenced by the three last mentioned. The case most requiring consideration in reference to institutions is the not very uncommon one in which a small but <b>leading</b> <b>portion</b> of the population, from difference of race, more civilized origin, or other peculiarities of circumstance, are markedly superior in civilization and general character to the remainder. Under those conditions, government by the representatives of the mass would stand a chance of depriving them of much of the benefit they might derive from the greater civilization of the superior ranks, while government by the representatives of those ranks would probably rivet the degradation of the multitude, and leave them no hope of decent treatment except by ridding themselves of one of the most valuable elements of future advancement. The best prospect of improvement for a people thus composed lies in the existence of a constitutionally unlimited, or at least a practically preponderant authority in the chief ruler of the dominant class. He alone has by his position an interest in raising and improving the mass, of whom he is not jealous, as a counterpoise to his associates, of whom he is; and if fortunate circumstances place beside him, not as controllers but as subordinates, a body representative of the superior caste, which, by its objections and questionings, and by its occasional outbreaks of spirit, keeps alive habits of collective resistance, and may admit of being, in time and by degrees, expanded into a really national representation (which is in substance the history of the English Parliament), the nation has then the most favorable prospects of improvement which can well occur to a community thus circumstanced and constituted.|$|E

50|$|The event cloak {{works by}} {{designing}} a medium in which {{different parts of}} the light illuminating a certain region can be either slowed or accelerated. A <b>leading</b> <b>portion</b> of the light is accelerated so that it arrives before the events occur, whilst a trailing part is slowed and arrives too late. After their occurrence, the light is reformed by slowing the leading part and accelerating the trailing part. The distant observer only sees a continuous illumination, whilst the events that occurred during the dark period of the cloak's operation remain undetected. The concept can be related to traffic flowing along a highway: at a certain point some cars are accelerated up, whilst the ones behind are slowed. The result is a temporary gap in the traffic allowing a pedestrian to cross. After this, the process can be reversed so that the traffic resumes its continuous flow without a gap. Regarding the cars as light particles (photons), the act of the pedestrian crossing the road is never suspected by the observer down the highway, who sees an uninterrupted and unperturbed flow of cars.|$|E

40|$|Onset {{asynchrony}} is {{an important}} cue for segregating sound mixtures. A harmonic of a vowel that begins before the other components contributes less to vowel quality. This asynchrony effect can be partly reversed by accompanying the <b>leading</b> <b>portion</b> of the harmonic with an octave-higher captor tone. The original interpretation was that the captor and <b>leading</b> <b>portion</b> formed a perceptual group, but it has recently been shown that the captor effect depends on neither a common onset time nor harmonic relations with the <b>leading</b> <b>portion.</b> Instead, it has been proposed that the captor effect depends on wideband inhibition in the central auditory system. Physiological evidence suggests that such inhibition occurs both within and across ears. Experiment 1 compared the efficacy of a pure-tone captor presented in the same or opposite ear to the vowel and leading harmonic. Contralateral presentation was at least as effective as ipsilateral presentation. Experiment 2 used multicomponent captors in a more comprehensive evaluation of harmonic influences on captor efficacy. Three captors with different fundamental frequencies were used, one of which formed a consecutive harmonic series with the leading harmonic. All captors were equally effective, irrespective of the harmonic relationship. These findings support and refine the inhibitory account. © 2007 Acoustical Society of America...|$|E

40|$|Preservation of ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) {{minerals}} {{formed at}} depths of 90 – 125 km require unusual conditions. Our subduction model involves underflow of a salient (250 ± 150 km wide, 90 – 125 km long) of continental crust embedded in cold, largely oceanic crust-capped lithosphere; loss of <b>leading</b> <b>portions</b> of the high-density oceanic lithosphere by slab break-off, as increasing volumes of microcontinental material enter the subduction zone; buoyancy-driven return toward midcrustal levels of a thin (2 – 15 km thick), low-density slice; finally, uplift, backfolding, normal faulting, and {{exposure of the}} UHP terrane. Sustained over ≈ 20 million years, rapid (≈ 5 mm/year) exhumation of the thin-aspect ratio UHP sialic sheet caught between cooler hanging-wall plate and refrigerating, downgoing lithosphere allows withdrawal of heat along both its upper and lower surfaces. The intracratonal position of most UHP complexes reflects consumption of an intervening ocean basin and introduction of a sialic promontory into the subduction zone. UHP metamorphic terranes consist chiefly of transformed, yet relatively low-density continental crust compared with displaced mantle material—otherwise such complexes could not return to shallow depths. Relatively rare metabasaltic, metagabbroic, and metacherty lithologies retain traces of phases characteristic of UHP conditions because they are massive, virtually impervious to fluids, and nearly anhydrous. In contrast, H 2 O-rich quartzofeldspathic, gneissose/schistose, more permeable metasedimentary and metagranitic units have backreacted thoroughly, so coesite and other UHP silicates are exceedingly rare.

40|$|The {{kinetic energy}} of a star in orbit about a supermassive black hole is a {{significant}} fraction of its rest mass energy when its periapse is comparable to its tidal radius. Upon its destruction, a fraction of this energy is extracted and injected into the stellar debris, half of which becomes unbound from the black hole, with the fastest material moving at ∼ 0. 03 c. In this paper, we present a formalism for determining the fate of these unbound debris streams (UDSs) as they depart from the black hole and interact with the surrounding gas. As the density and velocity varies {{along the length of}} a UDS, we find that hydrodynamical drag quickly shapes UDSs into loop-like structures, with the densest portions of the streams <b>leading</b> <b>portions</b> of lower density. As UDSs travel outwards, their drag against the ISM increases quadratically with distance, which causes UDSs to deposit their momentum and energy into the ambient medium before the surrounding shocked ISM has a chance to cool. This sudden injection of ∼ 10 ^ 50 erg into the ambient medium generates a Sedov-like unbound debris remnant (UDR) that mimics supernova remnants (SNRs) in energetics and appearance, accelerates particles which will produce cosmic rays and synchrotron emission, and provides momentum feedback into the molecular clouds surrounding a black hole. We estimate that a few of these UDRs might be present within a couple degrees of the Galactic Center masquerading as SNRs, and that the UDR scenario is a plausible explanation for Sgr A East.

40|$|Asynchrony is an {{important}} grouping cue for separating sound mixtures. A harmonic incremented in level makes a reduced contribution to vowel timbre when it begins before the other components. This contribution can be partly restored by adding a captor tone in synchrony with, and one octave above, the <b>leading</b> <b>portion</b> of the incremented harmonic [Darwin and Sutherland, Q. J. Exp. Psychol. A 36, 193 - 208 (1984) ]. The captor is too remote to evoke adaptation in peripheral channels tuned to the incremented harmonic, and so the restoration effect is usually attributed to the grouping of the <b>leading</b> <b>portion</b> with the captor. However, results are presented that contradict this interpretation. Captor efficacy {{does not depend on}} a common onset, or harmonic relations, with the leading component. Rather, captor efficacy is influenced by frequency separation, and extends to about 1. 5 oct above the leading component. Below this cutoff, the captor effect is equivalent to attenuating the <b>leading</b> <b>portion</b> of the incremented harmonic by about 6 dB. These results indicate that high-level grouping does not govern the captor effect. Instead, it is proposed that the partial restoration of the contribution of an asynchronous component to vowel timbre depends on broadband inhibition within the central auditory system. © 2006 Acoustical Society of America...|$|E
