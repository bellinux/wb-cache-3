5|$|A cold front's {{location}} {{is at the}} <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of the temperature drop-off, which in an isotherm analysis shows up as the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of the isotherm gradient, and it normally lies within a sharp surface trough. Cold fronts can move up to {{twice as fast as}} warm fronts and produce sharper changes in weather, since cold air is denser than warm air and rapidly lifts the warm air as the cold air moves in. Cold fronts are typically accompanied by a narrow band of showers and thunderstorms. On a weather map, the surface position of the cold front is marked with the symbol of a blue line of triangles/spikes (pips) pointing in the direction of travel, at the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of the cooler air mass.|$|E

40|$|Hypersonic {{waverider}} {{design has}} become an important concern in the aerospace industry. As one part of an inverse design effort for waveriders, {{work has been done}} to apply existing Euler and Navier-Stokies flow solvers to hypersonic geometries with sharp <b>leading</b> <b>edges.</b> Previously, calculations were done on bodies with rounded <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> or with conical solutions for the nose initial conditions. In this paper, solutions are computed about waveriders and conical shapes with sharp <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> without resorting to either shortrcut. All solutions show attached shocks with fully supersonic flows at the nose and along the <b>leading</b> <b>edges.</b> Flows about several waverider shapes are shown, as well as a preliminary cone with inlet calculation to study the shock/inlet interaction...|$|R

Conversely, a left-handed boomerang is constructed as {{a mirror image}} with the aerofoils' <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> {{on the left side}} of the wings, as seen from above, causing it to produce lift when circling clockwise. Although appearing symmetrical from a plan view, the <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> are on opposite edges of the wings (leading and trailing) so as to present the <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> of the aerofoil to the wind when spinning.|$|R
40|$|A {{computational}} {{investigation of}} sharp and blunt <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> in rarefied hypersonic flow are presented. Leading-edge bluntness {{effects on the}} aerodynamic surface quantities have been investigated by employing the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. The results highlight {{the sensitivity of the}} heat transfer, pressure, skin friction, drag, and lift cofficients for four different nose radius in order to assess the relative importance of the leading-edge bluntness and the underwedge-surface angle of <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> for waverider configurations. Comparisons based on drag, lift and lift-to-drag ratio are made between these blunt configurations and sharply pointed <b>leading</b> <b>edges.</b> Some significant differences between these shapes are noted on the aerodynamic surface quantities investigated. The analysis is of great importance since it is impossible to achieve ideally sharp <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> of airframes such as waveriders...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{steady-state}} aerodynamic {{characteristics of}} a new family of blunted <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> immersed in high-speed rarefied air flow are examined by using a Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. The work is motivated by interest in investigating the flowfield properties of these new blunt shapes as possible candidates for blunting geometries of hypersonic <b>leading</b> <b>edges.</b> Comparisons are made between these new blunt configurations and round shapes based on stagnation point heating and total drag. Some significant differences between these shapes is noted on the aerodynamic surface quantities. It was found that round <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> provided smaller stagnation point heating than the new blunt <b>leading</b> <b>edges.</b> The analysis also shows that, despite the seeming advantages of the new blunt shapes, round shapes still provides smaller stagnation point heating, however large total drag under the range of conditions investigated...|$|R

The wing, built around two duralumin spars and with a thin profile, was trapezoidal in plan out to rounded tips, with sweep only on the <b>leading</b> <b>edges.</b> Much of the wing surface was formed by thin, smooth radiators for the liquid-cooled engine; the rest was wood-covered with spruce <b>leading</b> <b>edges.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Hunter is a {{conventional}} swept wing all-metal monoplane. The fuselage is of monocoque construction, with a removable rear section for engine maintenance. The engine is fed through triangular air intakes in the wing roots {{and has a}} single jetpipe {{in the rear of}} the fuselage. The mid-mounted wings have a <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> sweep of 35° and slight anhedral, the tailplanes and fin are also swept. The Hunter's aerodynamic qualities were increasingly infringed upon by modifications in later production models, such as the addition of external containers to collect spent gun cartridges, underwing fuel tanks to increase range, <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> extensions to resolve pitch control difficulties, and a large ventral air brake.|$|E

The equivalent depths of arcs vary in the range 1.25–2.15km (0.77±0.13km for the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of Liberté arc). The fraction of dust in the arcs is from 40% to 70%.

5|$|Ahead of the spar, the thick-skinned <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of {{the wing}} formed a strong and rigid D-shaped box, which took most {{of the wing}} loads. At the time the wing was designed, this D-shaped <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> was {{intended}} to house steam condensers for the evaporative cooling system intended for the PV-XII. Constant problems with the evaporative system in the Goshawk led {{to the adoption of}} a cooling system which used 100% glycol. The radiators were housed in a new radiator-duct designed by Fredrick Meredith of the RAE at Farnborough. This used the cooling air to generate thrust, greatly reducing the net drag produced by the radiators. In turn, the leading-edge structure lost its function as a condenser, but it was later adapted to house integral fuel tanks of various sizes – a feature patented by Vickers-Supermarine in 1938.|$|E

40|$|The present {{paper is}} devoted to an {{investigation}} on the flow-induced noise control downstream of bluff bodies with various <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> using the surface perturbation technique. Four typical <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> used in various engineering applications were studied in this work: the semi-circular, square, 30 degrees symmetric trapezoid and 30 degrees asymmetric trapezoid <b>leading</b> <b>edges.</b> The surface perturbation was created by piezo-ceramic actuators embedded underneath {{the surface of a}} bluff body placed in a cross flow. To suppress the flow-induced noise downstream bluff bodies with those <b>leading</b> <b>edges,</b> the surface perturbation technique was implemented. Based on the experiments, a noise reduction in the duct of more than 14. 0 dB has been achieved for all leading-edge cases. These results indicated that the vortex shedding and its flow-induced noise have been successfully suppressed by the proposed control scheme. The flow structure alteration around the bluff bodies and the shear layer shift phenomenon observed on the trailing edges were then investigated for interpreting the control mechanism for this flow-induced noise suppression, which were based on the vortex shedding strength suppression and vortex shedding frequency shift phenomenon. The effective control position for various <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> was also studied for developing optimal control strategies for practical engineering applications.

5|$|In development, {{significant}} {{attention was}} given to the Tornado's short-field take-off and landing (STOL) performance. Germany, in particular, encouraged this design aspect. For shorter take-off and landing distances, the Tornado can sweep its wings forwards to the 25-degree position, and deploy its full-span flaps and <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> slats to allow the aircraft to fly at slower speeds. These features, in combination with the thrust reverser-equipped engines, give the Tornado excellent low-speed handling and landing characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{found that}} as the jet was {{beginning}} its takeoff rotation, engine number one separated from the left wing, flipping {{over the top of}} the wing and landing on the runway. As the engine separated from the aircraft, it severed hydraulic lines that locked the wing's <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> slats in place and damaged a three-foot section of the left wing's <b>leading</b> <b>edge.</b> Aerodynamic forces acting on the wing resulted in an uncommanded retraction of the outboard slats. As the jet began to climb, the damaged left wing, with no engine, produced far less lift (stalled) than the right wing, with its slats still deployed and its engine running at full takeoff speed. The disrupted and unbalanced aerodynamics of the aircraft caused it to roll abruptly to the left until it was partially inverted, reaching a bank angle of 112 degrees, before crashing in an open field by a trailer park near the end of the runway. The engine separation was attributed to damage to the pylon structure holding the engine to the wing, caused by improper maintenance procedures used at American Airlines.|$|E
