A goods shed was built in 1860 at the east end of the station, behind the platform for trains to Plymouth and cattle pens were added the following year. A footbridge across the line was built by Mr Robartes in 1860 to enable visitors to reach Lanhydrock more easily. This was later replaced by a passage beneath the tracks. This path is still used by those visitors to this National Trust property who arrive by train.|$|E
5000|$|The son of Governor of Western Australia Dr John Hampton, George Hampton {{arrived in}} the colony with his father in February 1862 on board the Stathallen. In 1866 he was holding the offices of private {{secretary}} to his father, clerk of council {{and member of the}} Finance Board, when he was in addition appointed acting Comptroller General of Convicts. As Hampton had no particular qualifications for the position, this [...] "unusually blatant act of nepotism"1 was extremely unpopular within the colony. It was further rumoured that George Hampton received a <b>lodging</b> <b>allowance</b> for the position, an allowance to which he was entitled by regulations but did not need since he lived with his father at Government House. The Perth Gazette sarcastically commented that Hampton could not apply the money to the purpose for which it was granted [...] "unless His Excellency intends to charge him rent for the rooms he occupies in his residence, in which case, of course, the amount will be placed to the credit of the colonial revenue."2 Both Hamptons became figures of public hostility and ridicule thereafter, especially George.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} the relationship between selected individual factors and student opinions regarding the funding of intercollegiate athletics at Winona State College. In the study, consideration was given to whether or not: 1. The personal factors (sex, age, marital status and military status) are related to the student opinions regarding the funding of intercollegiate athletics at Winona State College. 2. The academic factors (student classification, cumulative grade point average, major area of concentration in school, method of financing education and employment while attending college) are related to the student opinions regarding the funding of intercollegiate athletics at Winona State College. 3. The socio-economic factors (size of high school graduating class, participation in varsity athletics, father's occupation, and hometown population) are related to the student opinions regarding the funding of intercollegiate athletics at Winona State College. The major source for obtaining data was the "Administrator's Survey Instrument" which was in the form of a questionnaire administered to 500 full-time undergraduate students at Winona State College. The first section was concerned with the selected factors regarding each respondent and was designed to obtain information relative to the subject's personal, academic and socioeconomic background. The second section was designed to obtain data regarding student philosophy and opinions toward intercollegiate athletics and their source of funding at Winona State College. The chi-square test of independence was used to statistically examine the four hypotheses of the study to determine the statistically significant relationships between selected individual factors and student opinions regarding the funding of intercollegiate athletics at Winona State College. One primary and three subordinate null hypothesesPrimary HypothesisThere are no significant relationships between selected individual factors and student opinions regarding the funding of intercollegiate athletics at Winona State College. Subordinate Hypothesis AThere are no significant relationships between selected personal factors and student opinions regarding the funding of intercollegiate athletics at Winona State College. Subordinate Hypothesis BThere are no significant relationships between selected academic factors and student opinions regarding the funding of intercollegiate athletics at Winona State College. Subordinate Hypothesis CThere are no significant relationships between selected socio-economic factors and student opinions regarding the funding of intercollegiate athletics at Winona State College. Analysis of the data revealed that the three subordinate hypotheses could be rejected at the. 05 level. In other words, there appears to be a relationship between selected personal, academic and socio-economic characteristics of the students and the opinions these students expressed about the funding of intercollegiate athletics at Winona State College. Twenty percent (20 %) reached statistical significance in Subordinate Hypothesis A, nineteen percent (19 %) reached statistical significance in Subordinate Hypothesis B, and eleven percent (11 %) reached statistical significance in Subordinate Hypothesis C. Sixteen percent (16 %) reached statistical significance in the Primary Hypothesis. On this basis, the Primary Hypothesis was rejected and it was concluded that there were statistically significant relationships between selected individual factors and student opinions regarding the funding of intercollegiate athletics at Winona State College. Results obtained from the study indicate the following recommendations relative to funding intercollegiate athletics at Winona State College: (1) continue support ofthe intercollegiate athletic program through the primary source of student fees, (2) continue aid to athletes based on need and for a four year period, (3) continue funding of intercollegiate athletics through student organizations, (4) recommend no increase of monies for additional recruiting of outstanding athletes, (5) recommend no increase of varsity athletic program, (6) provide additional money for national tournament participation, (7) continue to stabilize current team expenses for food, lodging and travel, (8) continue the conventional mode of travel (bus and car) and do not increase monies for air travel except when circumstances demand, (9) when curtailment of a sport is necessary within the athletic program, consider the elimination of the sports in the following order: golf, cross country, hockey, tennis, football, track, wrestling, swimming, baseball and basketball, (10) when teams qualify for national competition, continue to fund them for participation nationally, (11) coaches salaries not to be funded from student fees, (12) permit students to have an option relative to purchasing the student activity ticket for extra-curricular events, (13) when a reduction of the yearly allocation comes about, consider such actions as requiring student admission fees to each home athletic event, limit the size of traveling squads for all sports, eliminate spring football, reduce food and <b>lodging</b> <b>allowances</b> and reduce the travel distances for all teams.

5000|$|The Police Commissioner was the British Army Colonel CMG, OBE, Gerald Richardson [...] A Scotland yard Officer, from Nottingham, he had {{his first}} {{experience}} as Police Officer, when himself {{and other members of}} a local rowing club decided to volunteer, for the Special Constabulary in Nottingham, when a general strike broke out. The strike lasted 9 days, from May 3, 1926 to May 13, 1926. At the end of the strike, he had realized that Law enforcement would have been his future career. He applied for the London Metropolitan Police where, after having passing the tests, he was admitted in 1927, and entered in the Police Training School at the Peel House in Westminster. After the graduation he spent 12 months on the beat, and then requested the assignment to the Criminal Investigation department; in August 1929 he was appointed Detective Constable. On July 13, 1943 he was Commissioned into the British Army. He would {{spend the rest of the}} war as law enforcement officer in the territories occupied by the British Forces. From London he was initially sent to Tangier, and after the landing in Italy he was in Sicily and Naples where for 18 months, he was Chief Public Safety Officer. At the end of the war he was serving in Northern Italy. It was during a period of rest on lake Maggiore, that an urgent telephone call summoned him, to report immediately, to the 8th Army HQ, where he received a new assignment as Director of the Public Safety of the City of Trieste. His task was not an easy one since there was no existing police force in the city. Among the reasons which had made the allied to take the direct rule of the area was that of, avoiding future confrontation between Italy and Yugoslavia who were still struggling for the possession of the border regions and the Port of Trieste. The port was a strategic hub to supply the allied forces in the occupied Austria. Colonel Gerald Richardson, has been described as a worthy gentleman always well dressed, and with the typical English trait. He tried to infuse the esprit de corps, and to create a cohesion into the newly formed unit. When creating the V.G.P.F, He abolished disciplinary code in use in the Royal Carabineer Corps, judging it too harsh and vicious, encouraged the development of, the new force traditions, personal responsibilities, and the concept of impartiality. Police Force personnel welfare was one of his priorities; he made sure that they all received an adequate salary, appropriate <b>lodging,</b> family <b>allowances,</b> and sickness benefits. However, when a regrettable incident occurred at a village outside Trieste, where a political demonstration had later developed into a riot, was taking place, and three demonstrators were shot dead, three Police Officers and an Inspector were charged with manslaughter, and had to appear before an Allied Military Court presided by British and American judges. As soon as he took up office, one of his first decision was to disband the Difesa Popolare, or Popular Defense, the uniformed People’s Police Force the Communists had built up. He soon noticed that, they were keeping no-record of what they were doing as well as for the arrestees, and when asked about it, were not able to produce any record at all; that their prisons were full, and most of the times, the interviewed prisoners could not give an account regarding their arrest. In addition all the evidences he collected, suggested that the Difesa Popolare, was financing itself with a protection racket system and looting. The uniform they wore were done by a local clothing manufacturer who had been doing the same job for the Germans. They wore red stars, and red scarfs around the neck and their chest were trimmed with hand grenades. Col. Gerald Richardson also find out that, their courts had no professional judges and that at the best, the trials were presided by some zealous young Law student, which in most of the cases, had forgotten everything he had studied. All these facts were intolerable for him and for the Allied authorities, and therefore two weeks after he took office the Difesa Popolare was officially disbanded. When they asked for a Victory parade, to be held on Sunday morning, their request was granted. The Difesa Popolare marched thru the street of Trieste, for the last time, and reached the Rossetti barracks. When the last one of them had filed into the barracks, the heavy doors were dragged shut behind them. From the opening windows, and roof British troops covered them with rifles, and machine guns; they had to surrender their own arms. They were told that they could go everywhere they liked, women as well as men. Those who wanted to go to Yugoslavia had to form a line on the left, assuming that the others on the right would have stayed, and were escorted to the frontier. British Personnel quickly went to the Difesa Popolare Posts and seized their weapon. However some of them were also given the chance of joining the V.G.P.F., although Richardson’s preference was for the former Royal Carabineers and Questura personnel whom he judged a better training material. His office was located at Foro Ulpiano, inside the Trieste Court House, and also included the Deputy Chief of Police, the Legal Advisor and Disciplinary Officer. In March 1955, Col. Richardson became the Commissaire, Chef de la Sureté, Police Générale, in the International zone of Tangier.|$|R
