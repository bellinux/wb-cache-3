40|$|Seismic {{events are}} {{generally}} {{followed by a}} number of secondary shakings (aftershocks). Buildings which have resisted mainshocks are more or less vulnerable to further shakings as the have experienced damaging during the first event. Masonry infill walls are commonly used in reinforced concrete structures and {{it is well known that}} they strongly interact with primary structures in presence of seismic loads. Infills may be beneficial or not to the capacity of buildings to resist earthquakes, but since they have a role in seismic response in mainshocks, they also influence the structural behavior during aftershocks. An assessment framework aimed at determining fragility curves of bare and infilled frames subject to previous seismic damage is presented in this paper. Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA) has been used by adopting a set of ground motions defined by combining a fixed (mainshock) and a variable (aftershock) part of the signal, which has been scaled in amplitude with respect to increasing intensity levels. Fragility curves are finally derived considering the cases of no pre-damaging, low predamaging, and high pre-damaging for both bare and infilled framed structures.

40|$|Graduation date: 1975 The usual {{approach}} to {{calculation of the}} ultimate bearing capacity of plastic silt is to assume no porewater drainage occurs during the loading period. The coefficient of permeability of plastic silt is generally significantly larger than clay; therefore, partial drainage of porewater may occur during the loading period. This study evaluates {{the validity of the}} no porewater drainage assumption as it applies to a particular plastic silt. A series of plate load tests were performed on three circular footings of different sizes, placed on the bottom of a shallow excavation. Ultimate bearing capacity for each footing is interpreted from load-settlement curves. Samples were taken from the test pit and the shear strength was evaluated by laboratory testing. The shear strength is used in the Terzaghi, Meyerhof, and Hansen bearing capacity equations.

By preparing standard specimens in field sampling, the mineral composition analysis, water rational test and uniaxial compression test were carried out.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the drained bearing response of circular footings resting on structured soil deposits. Numerical simulations {{have been carried}} out using a finite element formulation of the Structured Cam Clay model. A parametric study was conducted by varying the parameters that govern the behaviour of structured soils and guidelines are given for designers to identify when effects of the soil structure are important. Under fully drained conditions, deformation within the structured soil supporting the footing usually occurs as a <b>local</b> or punching <b>shear</b> <b>failure</b> due to high compressibility of the structured soil and the mobilised bearing pressure increases with the footing movement, without reaching an ultimate value. A novel approximate method is presented to obtain the load–displacement response of a rigid circular footing resting on the surface of a structured soil deposit. This requires the properties of the soil in the reconstituted state and two additional parameters, which govern the natural structure of the soil. The proposed method has been applied to a published case study, where plate load test results are given for rigid circular steel plates resting on structured soil deposits. Fair agreement is observed between the computed and experimental results, suggesting the approximate method may be useful in design studies of foundations on structured soil deposits...|$|R

Fuzzy mathematical models of safety repertories were introduced into the SFEM to analyze the stability of embankments and foundations in order to describe the fuzzy failure procedure for the random safety performance function. The fuzzy models were developed with membership functions with half depressed gamma distribution, half depressed normal distribution, and half depressed echelon distribution. The fuzzy stochastic mathematical algorithm was used to comprehensively study the local failure mechanism of the main embankment section near Jingnan in the Yangtze River in terms of numerical analysis for the probability integration of reliability on the random field affected by three fuzzy factors. The result shows that the middle region of the embankment is the principal zone of concentrated failure due to local fractures.

40|$|Due {{to their}} {{economic}} and architectural benefits, flat slabs made of reinforced or prestressed concrete {{are widely used}} for high-rise and residential buildings. In the surrounding area of slab-column connections, high moment and shear stresses arise, which can cause both bending failure and shear failure. <b>Local</b> <b>shear</b> <b>failure</b> of flat slabs, which is called punching, is classified as a nonductile failure. With internal columns of horizontally stiffened structures, the stresses are almost symmetrically distributed. However with edge and corner columns, the fixed-end moment from the rigidity of the framework and the shear force result in an asymmetric stress distribution. The relationship of the shear capacity and the moment transferred, which is called the moment-shear interaction, governs the punching shear resistance of slabs with an asymmetric shear stress distribution. For the design a flat slab, apart from an adequate shear resistance in the punching area, a restriction of the deflection is often authoritative. Prestressing reduces deflection and improves the shear resistance. In order to investigate punching and load bearing behaviour, 11 tests with and without prestressing on edge to column connections using a realistic slab thickness were carried out at the Institute of Structural Concrete at Aachen University of Technology. Based on the test results and on non-linear three-dimensional FE simulations a design model was developed to predict the punching resistance of internal, edge and corner column slab connections {{taking into account the}} effect of eccentricity and prestressing. Assuming a linear shear stress distribution along the yield line, a scientific model for punching of flat slabs is presented. The derivation assumes that the transmission of shear forces takes place in the compression zone, and the highest shear stress occurs at column-slab transition. The effect of prestressing on the resistance is described by an arch action model. For edge and corner columns a new simplified formulation to calculate the eccentricity factor b was derived. The final comparison of the method with results of punching tests at internal, corner and edge columns shows that all key parameters including the moment-shear interaction and the prestressing are described almost trend-free...|$|E
40|$|The {{safety and}} {{reliability}} of structures {{is influenced by the}} uncertainties of actions and resistances. The random character of the structural variables can be considered via probabilistic approaches and the failure probability can be calculated as a measure for safety. The concept of limit states allows the deduction of the partial safety factors considering the random character of actions and resistances. The main methods of structural reliability analyses are presented and applied to determine the safety of punching design equations for footings. Around the columns large moments and vertical shear forces arise in the footings. These forces can cause a <b>local</b> <b>shear</b> <b>failure,</b> which is called punching shear failure. In general, design codes do not distinguish between the punching shear strength of flat slabs and footings. Although experimental investigations clearly indicate that the shear span-depth ratio significantly affects the punching shear behaviour of footings, this effect is not considered in most design codes. A test data bank was established and different design provisions were critically reviewed. In addition, probabilistic methods were used to thoroughly investigate the existing safety level. A total of 22 reinforced concrete footings were tested to investigate the punching shear behaviour of footings. Ten specimens were realistically supported on sand in cooperation with the Institute of Geotechnical Engineering. Whereas the remaining footings were supported on the column stub and a uniform surface load was applied. The present tests indicated that the shear span-depth ratio significantly affects the punching shear behaviour. The angle of the failure shear crack is steeper in punching tests on compact footings than observed in tests on more slender footings. The shear strength decreases with increasing shear span-depth ratio. Shear reinforcement can substantially increase the punching capacity of footings. However, it is less effective with decreasing shear span-depth ratio. Nonlinear numerical analyses were conducted to study the main parameters affecting the punching shear strength of footings systematically. In the simulations, different failure modes were observed. The load-bearing behaviour of the compact footings can be described by a strut and tie model. The compression struts are inclined and expand like a conical shell from the edges of the column towards the bottom of the footing. Hence, the punching cone primarily develops due to splitting failure of the inclined compression struts. In more slender footings the ultimate load is achieved when the highly stressed compression zone at the column faces crushes. Based on the experimental and numerical investigations, the model according to AN-DRÄ was adapted to footings without shear reinforcement. For footings without shear reinforcement, the empirical design rule of Eurocode 2 was modified with a factor taking into account the shear slenderness. The reliability of the final equation was verified via semi-probabilistic calculations. In addition, a design proposal for footings with shear reinforcement was derived. For eccentrically loaded footings with and without shear reinforcement, the proposed design equations can be combined with a sector model...|$|E

40|$|Stone columns {{are known}} to be a cost {{effective}} and environmental friendly ground improvement technique, which is widely used to enhance the performance of shallow foundations built on soft ground. Stone columns increase bearing capacity, reduce settlement, reduce significantly the consolidation period and minimize the liquefaction potential of the ground. The current design of these columns is generally based on theories developed for single columns, ignoring the group interaction and accordingly the group efficiency. In the literature, reports can be found to confirm that the failure of single stone column is mostly due to bulging, meantime for a group of stone columns, the failure mechanism takes place by massive <b>shear</b> <b>failure</b> of the group and the surrounding soils. The objective of this thesis is to develop a numerical model, based on a two dimensional finite element technique. The model is capable to identify the different mode of failures of single and group of stone columns for a given columns/soil/loading condition. In these cases, group interactions were examined and evaluated. Parametric study was conducted on the parameters believed to govern this behavior. The results produced in this study showed that ground reinforced by group of stone columns may fail by general, <b>local</b> or punching <b>shear</b> <b>failure,</b> depending on geometry of the group and properties of the surrounding soils. Analytical models were developed for the ultimate bearing capacity of single and groups of stone columns. The models take into consideration the column interaction among the group and the strength of the surrounding soils and accordingly depict the appropriate mode of failure. Furthermore, analytical model was developed for the prediction of settlement of foundations under single or widely spaced stone columns.

40|$|Low {{weight is}} one of the most {{important}} factors in the design process of high speed naval ships, road vehicles and aircrafts. Lower structural weight enables the possibility of down-sizing the propulsion system and thus decrease manufacturing and operating costs as well as reducing the environmental impact. Two efficient ways of reducing the structural weight of a structure is by using high performance composite materials and by using geometrically efficient structures such as the sandwich concept. In addition to good quasi-static performance different structures have dynamic impact requirements. For a road vehicle this might be crash worthiness, an aircraft has to be able to sustain bird strikes or debris impact and a naval ship needs to be protected against blast or ballistic loading. In this thesis important aspects of dynamic loading of composite and sandwich structures are addressed and presented in the appended papers as follows. In paper A the notch sensitivity of non-crimp fabric glass bre composites is investigated. The notch sensitivity is investigated for several different laminate con gurations at varying tensile loading rate. It is shown that the non-crimp fabrics have very low notch sensitivity, especially for laminate con gurations with a large amount of bres in the load direction. Further, the notch sensitivity is shown to be fairly constant with increasing loading rates (up to 100 /s). In paper B a heuristic approach is made in order to create an analytical model to predict the residual strength of composite laminates with multiple randomly distributed holes. The basis for this model is a comprehensive experimental programme. It is found that unidirectional laminates with holes predominantly fail through three failure modes: global net-section failure, local net-section failure and <b>local</b> <b>shear</b> <b>failure.</b> Each failure mode can be described by a physical geometric constant which is used to create the analytical model. The analytical model can predict the residual strength of unidirectional laminates with multiple, randomly distributed holes with good accuracy. In paper C and paper D, novel prismatic high performance all-composite sandwich cores are proposed. In paper C an analytical model is developed that predicts the strength and sti ness properties of the suggested cores. In paper D the prismatic cores are manufactured and tested in shear loading and out-of-plane compression loading. Further, the analytical model is used to create failure mechanism maps to map out the overall behaviour of the different core con gurations. The novel cores show very high speci c strength and sti ness and are potential candidates as cores in high performance naval ship hulls. In paper E the dynamic properties of prismatic composite cores are investigated. The dynamic out-of-plane strength of an unit cell is tested experimentally in a gas gun - Kolsky bar set-up. Especially, different failure mechanisms and their e ect on the structural strength are investigated. It is found that cores with low relative density (slender core members) show very large inertial stabilisation e ects and have a dynamic strength that can be more than seven times higher than the quasi-static strength. Cores with higher relative density show less increase in dynamic strength. The main reason for the dynamic strengthening is due to the strain rate sensitivity of the parent material rather than inertial stabilisation of the core members. QC 2010101...|$|E
