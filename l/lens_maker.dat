50|$|The Waterhouse stop or Waterhouse {{diaphragm}} is an interchangeable diaphragm with an aperture (hole) {{for controlling}} {{the entry of}} light into a camera. A thin piece of metal (the diaphragm) is drilled with a hole (the aperture); a set of these with varying hole sizes makes up a set of Waterhouse stops, corresponding to what today we call f-stops or f-numbers.

Nicolaas started to make a living as a <b>lens</b> <b>maker</b> in Rotterdam, and was instructed in optics by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. In 1674, he and a fellow student, assisted by Van Leeuwenhoek, were the first to observe semen, a situation that would later lead to a priority dispute between Hartsoeker and Leeuwenhoek over the discovery of spermatozoids.|$|E
5000|$|Traditionally, <b>lens</b> <b>makers</b> like to {{mark the}} {{location}} of the company conspicuously on their lenses.

40|$|The {{microscope}} {{is undoubtedly}} {{one of the}} greatest inventions that men have ever made. The use of lenses for spectacles (eyeglasses), distant vision (telescopes), and high magnification (microscopes) required early <b>lens</b> <b>makers</b> accurately to grind lenses with different focal lengths. During the 16 th and 17 th centuries, Holland and Italy were the principal countries for the construction and use of telescopes and microscopes. The compound microscope (with two convex lenses) was invented in Holland around 1590 by two spectacle makers, Hans Jannsen and his son, Zacharias. During the early 1600 ’s, Galileo (1564 - 1642) made several telescopes and microscopes tha...|$|R
50|$|Brown {{was born}} in Portobello, London, in 1930, He was one of non-identical twins. His father was a <b>lens</b> <b>maker</b> {{and his mother had}} been a waitress. He left school at 16 and {{initially}} moved between a number of jobs, including work in the Post Office. In 1948, he was called up for national service - in the Air Force. He then went to University College London in 1951 studying archaeology and anthropology. After a series of jobs he obtained a research post at the Social Psychiatry Research Unit at the Maudsley Hospital, London. It was here that he began his research into schizophrenia.|$|E
50|$|Thus, {{starting}} with the first FD lenses produced in late 1970, all FD lenses had the capability of supporting full-aperture metering and multiple Automatic Exposure (AE) modes using both shutter-preferred and aperture-preferred modes. Even Programmed AE was possible with no modifications to the lens mount, though {{at the time of}} its introduction Canon did not have an AE camera body in the FD line. This was a design triumph for Canon that no other camera or <b>lens</b> <b>maker</b> was able to equal in 1970. Every other camera manufacturer had to make one or more alterations to its lens mount to enable full aperture metering, and later AE and or Programmed AE operation.|$|E
50|$|Langley was the {{director}} {{when he returned home}} in Allegheny City on July 8, 1872 following a conference. Observatory staff advised him that the lens of the 13 inch Fitz Telescope had been taken for ransom which Langley refused to pay; an argument with the unknown lens-napper ensued without resolve. It has been speculated that Langley knew the identity of the lens-napper, his or her identity is still a mystery. The lens-napper thought that with the involvement of the newspapers investigating the incidents his identity may be discovered so told Langley he could have back the lens. No clue was given as to its location but it was eventually found in a Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania hotel wastepaper basket. It being scratched made it useless so it was re-ground by <b>lens</b> <b>maker</b> Alvan Clark. When it was reinstalled the clarity was improved so the lens-napping benefited the observatory. In gratitude, Langley added Clark's name to the telescope.|$|E
5000|$|... "Macro" [...] lenses {{specifically}} designed for close-up work, with a long barrel for close focusing and optimized for high reproduction ratios, {{are one of the}} most common tools for macro photography. (Unlike most other <b>lens</b> <b>makers,</b> Nikon designates its macro lenses as [...] "Micro" [...] because of their original use in making microform.) Most modern macro lenses can focus continuously to infinity as well and can provide excellent optical quality for normal photography. True macro lenses, such as the Canon MP-E 65 mm f/2.8 or Minolta AF 3x-1x 1.7-2.8 Macro, can achieve higher magnification than life size, enabling photography of the structure of small insect eyes, snowflakes, and other minuscule objects. Others, such as the Infinity Photo-Optical's TS-160 can achieve magnifications from 0-18x on sensor, focusing from infinity down to 18 mm from the object.|$|R
5000|$|Because {{soft focus}} results from what are {{considered}} technical flaws, typically spherical and chromatic aberration, many older lenses had soft focus built in {{as a side}} effect of their construction. Some <b>lens</b> <b>makers,</b> such as Pinkham-Smith and Busch Nicola Perscheid (see Nicola Perscheid), intentionally designed lenses to take advantage of these flaws and, as color became available, chromatic aberration was less desirable, but well-managed spherical aberration was desirable. Newer lenses are optimized to minimize optical aberrations, but there are lenses such as the Canon EF 135mm lens f/2.8 with Softfocus, [...] Pentax SMC 28mm f2.8 FA Soft Lens, Mamiya 180mm f/4.0 Soft Focus Lens for RZ67 Cameras, and the Lensbaby Velvet 56mm lens, which have adjustable levels of spherical aberration at wide apertures. The effect can be disabled entirely as well, in which case the lens is sharp.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the end of}} 1839, Chevalier {{had created}} an {{achromatic}} version of the meniscus that combined field flattening and chromatic aberration control. The lens had the reverse concave flint glass side facing the subject and an f/16 aperture stop at its radius of curvature, making it reasonably sharp over a wide field of about 50°. Reversing the lens did increase chromatic aberration, but this fault could be lessened by adjusting the achromat to bring colors at the blue {{end of the spectrum}} into focus to match the blue-sensitive nature of the photographic emulsion. This design was copied by other <b>lens</b> <b>makers.</b> Because of its large flat field over a wide angle of view and its [...] "slow" [...] f/16 aperture (requiring twenty to thirty minutes for outdoor daguerreotype exposures), this lens {{came to be known as}} the [...] "French landscape lens" [...] or simply the [...] "landscape lens".|$|R

40|$|This {{time of year}} we {{look back}} at the year that has passed and make plans for the next year. I like to reflect on things that I have learnt and people that I have met, {{especially}} those who facilitated that learning. In 2009 I went to various conferences, The BCLA conference in Manchester, The Romanian Optical Society meeting in Brasov, Transylvania (where the university is actually on Vlad Tepes Street), The European Council for Optometry and Optics (ECOO) in Brno, Czech Republic, The American Academy of Optometry (AAO) in Orlando USA, The International Association of Contact Lens Educators (IACLE) meeting in Tianjin China and finally The Vereinigung Deutscher Contactlinsen-Spezialisten (VDCO) meeting in Jena. All were interesting places and thoroughly all were enjoyable conferences with their own highlights but I wanted to focus on Jena and one person I met there and his inspirational search for knowledge and the contributions he made in the field of contact lenses. Jena itself is a fascinating place and should be on the ‘must visit’ list of anyone involved in eye care. It is the birth place of Carl Zeiss of course and where he started his company. It is also the birth place of Ernst Abbe (physicist and optometrist and expert <b>lens</b> <b>maker),</b> and Otto Schott (chemist and technologist who made high quality glass. There are many road signs bearing witness to these famous pioneers. The optical museum is worth spending a few hours looking around too. I was invited to speak at the VDCO at the kind invitation from colleagues at the Jena School of Optometry, Professor Wolfgang Sickenberger and Professor Sebastian Marx. At this meeting I met 87 -year-old Willi KAUE who was being awarded the Adolf Wilhelm Müller-Welt prize by the VDCO for contribution to contact lenses over his 60 -year career. At the age of 15 Willi Kaue took up an apprenticeship to become an Optician in Germany in 1937. At this time he first heard about the scleral glass lenses made by the Carl Zeiss Company in Jena. This started his lifelong fascination which was to become his passion but not yet his career. During the war he was enlisted into military service but immediately after was back to his former career. In 1950 Willi corrected his own 3. 5 dioptres of myopia with a plastic scleral lens. His fascination strengthened as {{for the first time he}} himself could experience a wider field of view than his spectacles gave him, less aberrations and less retinal minification. He also appreciated the fact that contact lenses did not cause pressure on the nose or ears and did not slide down his nose plus remained optically centred with his eye movements. He decided that form now on he would make fitting contact lenses his career. He travelled to London to learn more about contact lenses and how to fit them but initially did not find many willing teachers and to start with became largely self-taught. He wanted to know how to make scleral lenses. So far he only knew that pulverized polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) was pressed and moulded. In 1951 he met Berlin optician Otto Marzock. He made his only scleral lenses from using military PMMA windshields. His process involved lathe cutting the lenses and resulted in lenses that were thinner than moulded ones. Willi developed a manufacturing method, using a rotary diamond drill, starting form the outer edge and towards the centre at a constant cut speed. This enabled him to make more reproducible lenses and in less time. His enthusiasm in the field was clear from the travels he made in the pursuit of advancement - travelling around Europe, South America, North America and Asia. In 1963 he visited George Nissel in Hemel Hempstead, England. Constantly thriving towards innovations Willi came across the new Naturalens from the USA made from HEMA at a congress in Marseille in 1969. Amongst his contributions to the field, was his own technique of fitting ocular prosthetics, using an alginate impression of the orbit. I was fortunate enough to have dinner with Willi Kaue and learnt more about his fascinating career through the patient interpreting skills of Hilmar Bussacker (the 2008 winner of the same award and the 2007 winner of the European Federation of the Contact Lens and IOL Industries Award). I look forward to 2010 with eager anticipation as to what I may learn and who I might meet!!...|$|E
50|$|Assuming lens axis front tilt, {{here are}} the trade offs in {{choosing}} between a small degree of tilt (say less than 3) and a larger tilt: A small tilt causes a wider or fatter wedge but one that is far off axis from the cone of light seen by the lens. Conversely, a large tilt (say 10 degrees) makes the wedge more aligned with the lens view, but with a narrower wedge. Thus, a modest tilt is often, or even usually, the best starting point.Small and medium format cameras have fixed bodies that do not allow for misalignment of the film and lens planes, intentionally or not. Tilt/shift (“TS”) or perspective control (“PC”) lenses that provide limited movements for these cameras can be purchased {{from a number of}} <b>lens</b> <b>makers.</b> High-quality TS or PC lenses are expensive. The price of a new Canon TS-E or Nikon PC-E lens is comparable to that of a good used large-format camera, which offers a much greater range of adjustment.|$|R

50|$|Some, but not all, camera-bodies {{capable of}} in-body {{stabilization}} can be pre-set manually {{to a given}} focal length, and their stabilization system will correct as if that focal length lens is attached, allowing older lenses and <b>lenses</b> from other <b>makers</b> to be stabilized. This isn't viable with zoom lenses, whose focal length is variable. Some adapters will communicate focal length information from the <b>maker</b> of one <b>lens</b> {{to the body of}} another <b>maker.</b> Some <b>lenses</b> that do not report their focal length can have a chip added to the lens, which will report a pre-programmed focal-length to the camera body. Sometimes, none of these techniques is viable, and image-stabilization simply cannot be used with such lenses.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} 17th century Johannes Kepler {{expanded}} on geometric optics in his writings, covering lenses, reflection by flat and curved mirrors, {{the principles of}} pinhole cameras, inverse-square law governing the intensity of light, and the optical explanations of astronomical phenomena such as lunar and solar eclipses and astronomical parallax. He was also able to correctly deduce {{the role of the}} retina as the actual organ that recorded images, finally being able to scientifically quantify the effects of different types of <b>lenses</b> that spectacle <b>makers</b> had been observing over the previous 300 years.

2500|$|Spinoza {{earned a}} modest living from lens-grinding and {{instrument}} making, {{yet he was}} involved in important optical investigations of the day while living in Voorburg, through correspondence and friendships with scientist Christiaan Huygens and mathematician Johannes Hudde, including debate over microscope design with Huygens, favouring small objectives and collaborating on calculations for a prospective 40ft telescope which would {{have been one of the}} largest in Europe at the time.

What I hope to achieve with {{this paper is to}} present initial material that could start a dialogue; a conversation that needs to happen to clarify what 2 ̆ 2 Collaboration in the Digital Age 2 ̆ 2 means. I am going to give an example of a truly magnificent collaboration and compare and contrast that with my personal trajectory. I want to preface this by saying that my comments are filtered through the <b>lens</b> of a <b>maker</b> and an educator. I chair the Fiber program at the Kansas City Art Institute so I am keenly {{aware of the fact that}} we are facing a bit of a crises. The world needs more creative problem solvers, yet I witness the steady decline of problem solving skills in the generation entering college. Here I would like to quote Einstein who said: 2 ̆ 2 We can 2 ̆ 7 t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them 2 ̆ 2. This does not bode well for the millennials, the generation that is self absorbed and only interested in having a relationship with their cell phones. Every year when I evaluate our curriculum and teaching methodologies I ask myself the question: is what we are teaching still relevant and more importantly, how do we engage these millennials, who seem so disengaged. How do you deliver content in an age where access to content and the democratization of information has exploded? At KCAI, we recognized the importance of teaching problem solving skills and decided to tackle the problem by facilitating the development of collaborative thinking with several new initiatives. One of them is our brand new Fablab with an exhibition space and the latest of all of the now ubiquitous digital tools including cnc-routers, laser cutters and 3 -D printers. In addition to the standard technology we also have a TC- 2, a hand operated digital Jacquard Loom developed and manufactured in Norway. Surprisingly it is the loom that is getting all of the attention and intrigues the students most. We designed the space from the start to bring disciplines together, remove barriers and create an atmosphere and space that would include all phases of the workflow including a classroom in the fabrication area. By focusing on an open structure for the main hall, we have created a space where community building and collaboration can be a part of the process. Students from different disciplines come with very different skillsets and learn from each other. They put their phones away and talk. In doing so they are laying the foundation for more collaborative engagement and expanding their thinking. These tools are so new that the playing field has been leveled as we are all earning together...|$|R
