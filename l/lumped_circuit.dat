500|$|One of {{the main}} {{drawbacks}} of the image parameter design method in this, as in other, filters is that the impedance match at the terminations is not good. [...] This usually requires that impedance matching sections are provided at the input and output. [...] These usually {{take the form of}} multi-section stepped impedance transformers. [...] These add considerably to the overall length of the filter.Matthaei et al., pp.397–408 [...] A small improvement to matching can be had by starting and ending the filter on a half-space instead of a full tooth or space. [...] The <b>lumped</b> <b>circuit</b> equivalent of this is T-half-sections terminating the filter at either end. [...] Starting and ending on a half-tooth instead of a half space is the equivalent of Π-half-sections.|$|E
500|$|Waveguide filter designs {{frequently}} {{consist of}} two different components repeated a number of times. [...] Typically, one component is a resonator or discontinuity with a <b>lumped</b> <b>circuit</b> equivalent of an inductor, capacitor, or LC resonant circuit. [...] Often, the filter type will take {{its name from the}} style of this component. [...] These components are spaced apart by a second component, a length of guide which acts as an impedance transformer. [...] The impedance transformers have the effect of making alternate instances of the first component appear to be a different impedance. [...] The net result is a lumped element equivalent circuit of a ladder network. [...] Lumped element filters are commonly ladder topology, and such a circuit is a typical starting point for waveguide filter designs. [...] Figure 4 shows such a ladder. [...] Typically, waveguide components are resonators, and the equivalent circuit would be LC resonators instead of the capacitors and inductors shown, but circuits like figure 4 are still used as prototype filters {{with the use of a}} band-pass or band-stop transformation.|$|E

This amplifier will be centered on an ideal switch but, specific characteristics of the chosen transistor will be taken into account.

The first step is to use standard equations, which describe the behavior of ideal Class-E amplifies, to solve for <b>lumped</b> element <b>circuit</b> parameters.

5000|$|Lengths {{of lines}} in {{distributed}} element circuits, for generality, are usually {{expressed in terms}} of the circuit's nominal operational wavelength, λ. Lines of the prescribed length in a commensurate line circuit are called unit elements (UEs). A particularly simple relationship pertains if the UEs are λ/8. [...] Each element in the <b>lumped</b> <b>circuit</b> is transformed into a corresponding UE. However, Z0 of the lines must be set according to the component value in the analogous <b>lumped</b> <b>circuit</b> and this may result in values of Z0 that are not practical to implement. This is particularly a problem with printed technologies, such as microstrip, when implementing high characteristic impedances. High impedance requires narrow lines and there is a minimum size that can be printed. Very wide lines, on the other hand, allow the possibility of undesirable transverse resonant modes to form. A different length of UE, with a different Z0, may be chosen to overcome these problems.|$|E
