5|$|The war of 1918 led to {{disintegration}} within both socialist and the non-socialist factions. The power political {{shift toward}} the right caused a dispute between conservatives and liberals {{on the best}} system of government for Finland to adopt: the former demanded monarchy and restricted parliamentarianism, the latter demanded a Finnish republic with full-scale democracy and social reforms. Both sides justified their views via political and <b>legal</b> <b>grounds.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{conservation}} groups and environmental organizations had voiced {{opposition to the}} pipeline project before 1970, {{the introduction of the}} National Environmental Policy Act allowed them <b>legal</b> <b>grounds</b> to halt the project. Arctic engineers had raised concerns about the way plans for a subterranean pipeline showed ignorance of Arctic engineering and permafrost in particular. A clause in NEPA requiring a study of alternatives and another clause requiring an environmental impact statement turned those concerns into tools used by the Wilderness Society, Friends of the Earth, and the Environmental Defense Fund in their Spring 1970 lawsuit to stop the project.|$|E
5|$|Before the Reformation, the {{extensive}} prohibited degrees of kinship, {{up to the}} fourth degree through consanguinity, meant that most noble marriages necessitated a papal dispensation. This could later be used as grounds for annulment if the marriage proved politically or personally inconvenient, {{although there was no}} divorce as such. After the mid-sixteenth century the prohibited degrees were reduced to those in Leviticus 13: 4–13, which limited them to relationships in the second degree of kinship. Separation from bed and board continued to be allowed in exceptional circumstances, usually adultery, and under the Reformed Kirk divorce was allowed on grounds of adultery or desertion. Scotland {{was one of the first}} countries to allow desertion as <b>legal</b> <b>grounds</b> for divorce and, unlike England, where divorce necessitated and act of parliament, divorce cases were initiated relatively far down the social scale.|$|E

Furthermore, it is advisable to rely on a different <b>legal</b> <b>ground</b> for processing than for consent, when it is available and applicable [23]. The <b>legal</b> <b>ground</b> must be chosen according to the purpose of the processing.|$|R
5|$|Marriages, {{particularly}} {{higher in}} society, were often political {{in nature and}} the subject of complex negotiations over the tocher (dowry). Some mothers took a leading role in negotiating marriages, as Lady Glenorchy did for her children in the 1560s and 1570s, or as matchmakers, finding suitable and compatible partners for others. Before the Reformation, the extensive marriage bars for kinship meant that most noble marriages necessitated a papal dispensation, which could later be used as grounds for annulment if the marriage proved politically or personally inconvenient, although there was no divorce as such. Separation from bed and board was allowed in exceptional circumstances, usually adultery. Under the reformed Kirk, divorce was allowed on grounds of adultery, or of desertion.

5|$|Joseph married Max Joseph's sister, Maria Josepha, in 1765, {{hoping he}} could claim the Bavarian {{electorate}} for his offspring. After {{two years of}} unhappy marriage, Maria Josepha died without issue. When Max Joseph died ten years later, Joseph could only present a weak legal claim to Lower Bavaria through a dubious and ancient grant made by the Emperor Sigismund to the House of Habsburg in 1425. Knowing its poor <b>legal</b> <b>grounds,</b> Joseph negotiated a secret agreement with Charles Theodore shortly after Max Joseph's death. In this agreement (3 January 1778), Charles Theodore ceded Lower Bavaria to Austria in exchange for uncontested succession to {{the remainder of the}} duchy. Charles Theodore also hoped to acquire from Joseph some unencumbered parts of the Austrian Netherlands and parts of Anterior Austria that he could bequeath to his bastards, but this was not written into the agreement and Joseph was not a particularly generous man. Furthermore, the agreement entirely ignored the interests of Charles Theodore's own heir presumptive, Charles II August, of the House of Palatinate-Zweibrücken-Birkenfeld. Charles August was the presumptive heir of Charles Theodore's domains and titles. He had a clear and direct interest in the disposition of the Bavarian duchy, especially in its territorial integrity.|$|E

30|$|Second, {{we studied}} the legal {{conditions}} for the collection of data and data retention. Administrators of honeypots and honeynets, who are seen as personal data controllers {{in the eyes of}} the law, because IP addresses are considered personal data within EU law, can rely on the <b>legal</b> <b>ground</b> of legitimate interest to collect and process personal. In production honeypots, the legitimate interest lies in safeguarding the security of the service. In our opinion, the <b>legal</b> <b>ground</b> of legitimate interest is applicable also for research honeypots. An adequate length of retention of personal data is also an important issue for the processing of honeypot data, since the data minimization principle applies. In situations where a researcher wants to publish data collected by honeypots and honeynets, anonymization is needed.|$|R
50|$|There was no <b>legal</b> <b>ground</b> for the extradition. According to the Hague Conventions, {{after the}} end of a war a neutral power is not {{required}} to extradite warfighters to anyone. Furthermore, prisoners must be free to return home, but only if they wish to do so.|$|R
25|$|The private {{shareholders}} {{decided not}} to appeal against the judgment, {{because there were no}} <b>legal</b> <b>grounds</b> for doing so. For many of them – who had contributed around £50 each, on average, to the fighting fund to bring the action – the case had served its purpose.|$|E
25|$|Also in June, {{parliament}} {{passed a}} law banning adoption of Russian children by foreign same-sex couples and by unmarried individuals from countries where marriage for same-sex couples is legal.

25|$|Despite {{receiving}} strong support, Ghenadie formally obeyed the Synod's orders.

Iosif Gheorghidan returned to the Metropolitan seat for a second reign.|$|E

30|$|First, we {{investigated}} {{the data collected}} by honeypots {{from the perspective of}} the EU law.

25|$|Adultery (anglicised from Latin adulterium) is extramarital {{sex that}} is {{considered}} objectionable on social, religious, moral, or <b>legal</b> <b>grounds.</b> Though what sexual activities constitute adultery varies, {{as well as the}} social, religious, and legal consequences, the concept exists in many cultures and is similar in Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. A single act of sexual intercourse is generally sufficient to constitute adultery, and a more long-term sexual relationship is sometimes referred to as an affair.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 17/18 May 1918 French had Sinn Féin leaders arrested and {{documents}} were seized, but even supporters like Repington and Macready were disappointed {{at the lack of}} clear evidence of collaboration with the Germans and the flimsy <b>legal</b> <b>grounds</b> for the arrests, which caused endless legal wrangles. Michael Collins and Cathal Brugha escaped arrest and increased their own power in the vacuum created by the arrest of more moderate leaders.|$|E
25|$|Another bidder, BP-Metropolitan Investors, {{filed an}} {{official}} protest in April 2012 against GSA for awarding the redevelopment to The Trump Organization. The bidding group, which included Hilton Worldwide, said GSA {{failed to take}} into account Trump's repeated bankruptcies and unrealistic economic assumptions. GSA said Metropolitan lost the award because it offered to spend only $140 million to renovate the building. GSA responded to the protest by noting that since the redevelopment was not a procurement, there were no <b>legal</b> <b>grounds</b> for protesting its decision.|$|E
