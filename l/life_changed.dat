5|$|The monks' {{dormitory}} {{was on the}} {{top floor}} of the east range, a long room with a high pitched roof (the mark of which can still be seen on the transept wall) which ran the length of the building. This was entered by two staircases: the day stair went down into the cloister in the south-east corner; the night stair led into the south transept of the church to allow the monks to get easily from bed to choir at night. Initially the dormitory was an open hall, with the monks' beds placed along the walls, one under each of the small, slit-like windows. During the fourteenth century, when views of the necessity of sleeping in the same space together for the common <b>life</b> <b>changed,</b> the dormitory at Netley would, as at other houses, have been divided into sections with wooden dividers to give every monk his own private area, each leading off a central corridor. The treasury, a tiny vaulted room, was at the north end of the dormitory, preumably located for security at night.|$|E
5|$|William Stacy {{was born}} in Gloucester, Massachusetts in 1734 and died in Marietta, Ohio in 1802. Slightly {{different}} years of birth and death have been reported. Stacy grew up in Gloucester {{on the coast of}} Massachusetts and worked as a shoemaker, a trade learned from his father; he may also have worked in the seafaring business. William Stacy married Sarah Day in 1754. Subsequently, during 1757, they moved away from the coast to New Salem in western Massachusetts, and raised a large family. Stacy took up farming and continued his work as a shoemaker. He also became a commercial banker, loaning money at interest before there were any banks in the area. His customers were from New Salem and other towns in the Province of Massachusetts Bay. By the time of his early middle age, William Stacy was living a comfortable life; he was successful and widely known. During 1775, at the age of 41, William Stacy's <b>life</b> <b>changed</b> with the onset of friction between the Thirteen Colonies and the British Empire.|$|E

40|$|A {{group of}} hospitalized {{psychiatric}} patients and a randomly selected non-therapy group {{responded to the}} Schedule of Recent Experiences questionniare. In {{order to determine the}} magnitude of <b>life</b> <b>change</b> events for the two groups, <b>Life</b> <b>Change</b> Unit totals were derived for the years 1966 and 1967. To test the hypothesis that patients in psychiatric treatment have experienced a quantitatively significant greater amount of <b>life</b> <b>change</b> than a group of non-therapy subjects, an analysis of variance was used to determine whether there were significant differences between the scores for the two groups. For the year 1966, no significant difference was found between the therapy and non-therapy samples. For the year 1967, {{there was a significant difference}} between the mean <b>Life</b> <b>Change</b> Unit scores for the two groups. As a result of these findings, it is concluded that an accumulation of <b>life</b> <b>change</b> events may serve to precipitate mental health change, and that that probability of such health change occurring is significantly greater when there is a clustering of <b>life</b> <b>change</b> events during any given year than when such a clustering does not occur...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} in psycho-oncology {{that people can}} experience posttraumatic growth (PTG), or positive <b>life</b> <b>change,</b> {{in addition to the}} distress that may occur after a cancer diagnosis. Many studies utilise existing PTG measures that were designed for general trauma experiences, such as the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory. However, such inventories may not take into account <b>life</b> <b>changes</b> associated with a crisis specifically in a health-related context. METHOD: The current study presents a mixed method exploration of the post-diagnosis experience of cancer survivors (N?=? 209) approximately 3 years after diagnosis. RESULTS: Quantitative and qualitative assessment of PTG showed that appreciating life was the most salient area of positive <b>life</b> <b>change</b> for cancer survivors. The results also revealed that in addition to several PTG domains captured by existing quantitative PTG measures, further positive <b>life</b> <b>changes</b> were reported, including compassion for others and health-related <b>life</b> <b>changes.</b> CONCLUSIONS: These domains of PTG highlight the unique context of a cancer diagnosis and the potential underestimation of positive <b>life</b> <b>change</b> by existing inventories. Further research is warranted that is directed towards designing a context-specific PTG measure for cancer survivors. No Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|The {{relations}} between <b>life</b> <b>changes,</b> {{locus of control}} {{and changes in the}} parameters of the metabolic syndrome were examined. A three-year follow-up study of 671 randomly selected, healthy adolescents and young adults was used. Somatic parameters measured both at the baseline and the follow-up were serum insulin, serum HDL chol, serum triglyceride, SBP and BMI. Locus of control was measured with the Nowicki-Strickland locus of control scale and subjects were asked about <b>life</b> <b>changes</b> that they had faced during the follow-up period. Results showed that, in women, there were significant main effects for <b>life</b> <b>changes</b> in predicting (high) somatic risk level, whereas, in men, an opposite association was found. In addition, locus of control had a moderating effect on the life change-metabolic parameters relation, i. e. most of the <b>life</b> <b>changes</b> predicted a lower level of somatic risk in subjects with an external rather than internal locus of control. Results question the universal applicability of beneficial health effects of internal locus of control.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 96 - 104) A {{questionnaire was}} utilized {{to study the}} relationship between <b>life</b> <b>change</b> stress and its consequences. Illness, drug usage and various alternative methods for relieving tension and anxiety were examined as responses to stress. The principle hypothesis predicted that <b>life</b> <b>change</b> scores (LC), determined by weighting individual <b>life</b> <b>changes</b> by their perceived stressfulness, would correlate positively with a combined drug use, illness, and alternative score (TOT). A second hypothesis, corollary to the first, predicted that individual correlations between <b>life</b> <b>change</b> scores and the three components of TOT, namely, drug use (Drug), illness (Ill), and use of alternative stress relievers (Alt) would also be positive and large. The above predictions were {{borne out by the}} data. An additional finding was that use of the alternatives seems to be a relatively immediate response to stress whereas illness and drug use appear to be longer term reactions. A third hypothesis, that subjects rating stressfulness of <b>life</b> <b>change</b> low would have a larger number of effective alternative methods for relieving stress, was not substantiated. Similarly, the prediction that those experiencing a larger number of <b>life</b> <b>changes</b> would rate them individually as more stressful than those experiencing fewer disruptions, was also disconfirmed. Sex differences, as well as disparities between religious and political groups were explored in regards to characteristic <b>life</b> <b>changes,</b> rated stressfulness of these changes, illness and drug usage patterns, and the use and rated effectiveness of the various alternative methods of stress reduction.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, Positive Psychology (PP) has {{promoted}} the {{scientific study of}} positive <b>life</b> <b>changes</b> in the aftermath of cancer. These have been integrated within negative <b>life</b> <b>changes,</b> based on the same human experience framework. Innovative interventions have been designed, prioritizing the pathways to the reduction of emotional distress and psychopathology in cancer, through the facilitation of positive psychological functioning. These interventions have achieved promising results. A theoretical and integrative review of the PP-related constructs was performed in the relevant databases (PsycINFO, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, etc.). These constructs have been linked to positive <b>life</b> <b>changes</b> after cancer and their therapeutic potential. Finally, we provide a summary of a positive psychotherapy program for cancer survivors, indicating the therapeutic strategies that facilitate positive <b>life</b> <b>changes</b> in the aftermath of cancer. Positive <b>life</b> <b>changes</b> after suffering cancer are more the norm than the exception.

Within two weeks 1740 new kolkhozes were established {{and by the end}} of 1950, just 4.5% of Latvian farmsteads remained outside the collectivized units; about 226,900 farmsteads belonged to collectives, of which there were now around 14,700. Rural <b>life</b> <b>changed</b> as farmers' daily movements were dictated to by plans, decisions and quotas formulated elsewhere and delivered through an intermediate non-farming hierarchy. The new kolkhozes, especially smaller ones, were ill-equipped and poor - at first farmers were paid once a year in kind and then in cash, but salaries were very small and at times farmers went unpaid or even ended up owing money to the kholhoz. Farmers still had small pieces of land (not larger than 0.5 ha) around their houses where they grew food for themselves. Along with collectivization, the government tried to uproot the custom of living in individual farmsteads by resettling people in villages. However this process failed due to lack of money since the Soviets planned to move houses as well.|$|E
