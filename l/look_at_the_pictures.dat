25|$|Arriving on land just as Lauren's {{father is}} about to cancel the wedding, Stu makes a defiant speech where he rejects being boring and instead states {{that he is in}} fact quite wild. Impressed, Lauren's father gives the couple his blessing. After they {{exchange}} their vows, Alan presents Stu with a special gift at the post-reception dance: a musical guest performance by Mike Tyson. Teddy later discovers that he had taken many pictures during the night on his cell phone. The group, along with Tyson, agree to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> together once (some of which reveal Teddy lost his finger playing the knife game) before erasing the evidence of their exploits once again.|$|E
500|$|The {{group is}} first pictured sitting around {{backstage}} while waiting {{to have their}} hair and make-up done. In another scene, Little Mix are filmed on their tour bus. This scene features Jade Thirlwall scribbling in a notebook as the other group members play around, laugh and take pictures of each other sleeping using the Samsung Galaxy. The group then <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> they took together. In a different scene, Perrie Edwards is seen cuddling a puppy. Little Mix are also pictured singing [...] "Change Your Life" [...] {{to each other in}} a studio and preparing to go on stage at their Rhyl Pavilion tour date. Other scenes features the group in a dance rehearsal, using funny facial expressions and bonding with their mothers backstage. During the dance rehearsal, the group is seen practising dance moves to their DNA Tour setlist with their tour choreographer and backing dancers. In other scenes, the group is seen playing with their own Little Mix dolls and Thirlwall, sporting blue hair, is wheeled away in a cardboard box. Before going onstage, Leigh-Anne Pinnock is seen smiling as a make-up artist applies her final touches while Thirlwall is pictured applying her own make-up. The group then centre themselves as they show each other support by hugging one another before heading to the stage. After the show, the foursome is seen showing their solidarity by embracing one another again.|$|E
2500|$|The next morning, {{they meet}} with Chow {{in the desert}} and {{exchange}} the money, {{only to find that}} [...] "Doug" [...] is the black drug dealer who accidentally sold Alan Rohypnol. With the wedding set to occur in 5 hours, Phil calls Tracy and tells her that they cannot find Doug. When [...] "Black Doug" [...] mentions that, [...] "If you take Roofies, you're more likely to end up on the floor than on the roof," [...] Stu realizes where Doug is. The trio travels back to their hotel where they find a badly sunburned Doug on the roof. Stu, Phil, and Alan had moved him there on his mattress the night before as a practical joke, but forgot where they left him. Doug had thrown his own mattress onto the statue, in an attempt to signal help. Before leaving, Stu makes arrangements to go on a date with Jade the following week. With less than four hours before the wedding and with no flights to L.A. available, the four quickly drive home. Along the way, Doug reveals he has possession of Chow's original $80,000. Despite their late arrival, Doug and Tracy are married, the former learns the damaged Mercedes was a wedding gift, and Stu breaks up with Melissa, having grown tired of her controlling attitude. As the reception ends, Alan finds Stu's digital camera containing photos of the events they cannot remember, and the four agree to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> together before deleting the evidence of their exploits. All of them, save for Alan, are traumatized by what they see.|$|E
5000|$|Don't {{know much}} about <b>the</b> middle ages, <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> then I turned the pages, ...|$|R
60|$|Bert <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> over Anson's shoulder, but did {{not seem}} to pay much {{attention}} to it.|$|R
6000|$|She idly <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures.</b> Beautiful, <b>the</b> pure women, {{with their}} clear-dropping gowns. Her heart became colder. What did they mean to him? ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Parkman paid, at first, no {{attention}} to this request, but continued to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> around him.|$|E
60|$|I {{went into}} the chapel to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures.</b> There was St. Bernard {{standing}} {{in the midst of}} a desolate, snowy waste, with a little child on one arm and a great dog beside him.|$|E
60|$|They {{passed along}} through {{one or two}} streets, walking very slowly, so that the boys might <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> and curious things in the shop windows. At length {{they came to a}} toy-shop, and all went in.|$|E
60|$|Sabatini lit his cigarette, and, leaning {{slightly}} {{against the}} back of a chair, stood with folded arms <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> over <b>the</b> fireplace.|$|R
60|$|Corky and I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture,</b> then <b>at</b> {{each other}} in an awed way. Jeeves was right. There could be no other title.|$|R
60|$|Taking {{due care}} to dismiss all ideas of Nature from my mind, to begin with, I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> which {{represented}} <b>the</b> Passions first.|$|R
60|$|The {{sight of}} the {{pictures}} reconciled George to Polly's departure, and seeing the lad was amused and comfortable, she started with Luke, Dick taking his place near the bed, where he could also enjoy a <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures.</b>|$|E
60|$|I escorted her home, {{while they}} {{continued}} to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures.</b> He was a romanticist. He liked Copley, Fielding, Cattermole and Birket Foster; he could see nothing whatsoever in Girtin or David Cox. They fell out decidedly over George Clausen.|$|E
6000|$|He {{bowed to}} Stella. Romayne thought his guest {{might have taken}} the English freedom of shaking hands. [...] "When will you come and <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> again?" [...] he asked. [...] "Will you dine with us, {{and see how they}} bear the lamplight?" ...|$|E
60|$|Blended {{with the}} look that Carker bent upon him, was a devilish <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> over his head, that struck upon {{it like a}} flash of lightning.|$|R
60|$|We found Corky near <b>the</b> door, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture,</b> {{with one}} hand up in a {{defensive}} sort of way, as if he thought it might swing on him.|$|R
60|$|The second {{falsehood}} was, {{that the}} Pre-Raphaelites did not draw well. This was asserted, {{and could have}} been asserted only by persons who had never <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "There is no sort {{of reason}} for our pushing through this crowd {{in a gang}} of three. Besides, I want to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures,</b> and not after you to see which way you go. I shall meet you here at six o'clock, sharp. Good-bye." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{replied that}} I {{did not know}} exactly what I wanted, and that I would see what he had. I now began to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> on the walls, {{occasionally}} mentioning my ideas in regard to their merits, when suddenly my companion {{turned to me and}} said: ...|$|E
60|$|It was a wet evening, {{and we all}} {{stayed in}} the house. Harold brought {{in one of his}} {{political}} economy studies from the library, and I tried to wile Dora to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> in a curious big old Dutch Scripture history, the Sunday delight of our youth.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was trying}} to draw; Lord knows who--Lord Newcome, who was killed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> battle of Bosworth," [...] said the artist, and the girl ran to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> {{minister}} <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture.</b> A stern expression {{came into}} his gentle blue eyes and he got as near to frowning as {{it was possible for}} him to get.|$|R
6000|$|And then {{he stood}} and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> which was as his child's to him, turned and said, [...] "Well for him that {{he is out of}} all this!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Most women always are," [...] said Henrietta, with {{conscientious}} evasiveness and generalising less hopefully than usual. [...] "If {{you go to}} Rome," [...] she added, [...] "I hope you'll be a true friend--not {{a selfish}} one!" [...] And she turned off and began to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Then, as {{they could}} not pretend to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> any longer, they went away, too. Their issue into the open air seemed fraught with novel emotion for Mrs. Verrian. [...] "Well, now," [...] she said, [...] "I have seen the woman I would be willing my son should marry." ...|$|E
6000|$|This in turn {{brought about}} in Lady Grace an {{immediate}} drop of the subject. [...] "Tell my father, please, that I'm expecting Mr. Crimble; of whom I've {{spoken to him}} even if he doesn't remember, and who bicycles this afternoon ten miles over from where he's staying--with some people we don't know--to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures,</b> about which he's awfully keen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That 's true!" [...] cried Fan, as Polly {{paused to}} <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture,</b> which {{appeared}} to regard her with a grave, steady look, which seemed rather to belie her assertions.|$|R
60|$|He stood {{them in a}} row {{against the}} wall. Anne had to turn round in her chair to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> them. There was the big canvas of the man fallen from the horse, there was a {{painting}} of flowers, {{there was a small}} landscape. His hands {{on the back of the}} chair, Denis leaned over her. From behind <b>the</b> easel <b>at</b> <b>the</b> other side of the room Mr. Scogan was talking away. For a long time they <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures,</b> saying nothing; or, rather, Anne <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures,</b> while Denis, for <b>the</b> most part, <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> Anne.|$|R
6000|$|The {{voice of}} Mrs. Tallents Smallpeace broke through: [...] "But do {{please tell me}} who is that young girl with <b>the</b> young man <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> over there. She's quite charming!" ...|$|R
60|$|He rarely {{showed them}} to anyone; Irene, whose opinion he {{secretly}} respected and perhaps for that reason never solicited, had only been into the room on rare occasions, in discharge of some wifely duty. She was not asked to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures,</b> and she never did. To Soames this was another grievance. He hated that pride of hers, and secretly dreaded it.|$|E
60|$|Sir Philip induced two of {{his sisters}} to perpetrate a duet. He gave {{occupation}} to the Misses Sympson. The elder ladies were conversing together. He was pleased to remark that meantime Shirley rose to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures.</b> He had a tale to tell about one ancestress, whose dark beauty seemed {{as that of a}} flower of the south. He joined her, and began to tell it.|$|E
6000|$|... 118. Dean of St. Paul's. Is it not {{the case}} when ladies with very {{brilliant}} dresses look at pictures through glass, that {{the reflection of the}} color of their dresses is so strong as greatly to disturb the enjoyment and the appreciation of the pictures?--Certainly; but I should ask the ladies to stand a little aside, and <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> one by one. There is that disadvantage.|$|E
6000|$|On May 2, {{as he was}} <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> in <b>the</b> Academy, Lord Granville {{brought him}} tidings of the Russian answer, which meant peace. His short entries tell a brave story:— ...|$|R
60|$|He {{picked his}} way across the disorderly chamber, and, {{adjusting}} his eyeglass, stood <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture.</b> Helen made a hasty movement towards the door, and Mr. Brown followed her into the adjoining room.|$|R
60|$|We {{are very}} fond of pine-apple, all three of us. We <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> on <b>the</b> tin; we thought of the juice. We smiled at one another, and Harris got a spoon ready.|$|R
