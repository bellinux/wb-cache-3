Findings support the accepted notion of a distinct student identity and perceived divides between students and local people based on spatiality, <b>locality,</b> <b>class</b> and student habitus, which also inter-sected with gender to produce ‘locally specific ’ experiences of space and safety within this setting. However, the article confounds the middle-class student and working-class local dichotomy by exploring accounts from a varied sample of women in terms of age, class, ethnicity and domestic background, which reveal alternative university experiences and shifting class relations as a result of deindustrialisation.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a qualitative research project, ‘Localising Health: Space, class and gender {{and the lives}} of young people’. This qualitative, ethnographic study was undertaken with 25 young people from diverse socio-economic households who resided in Lyttelton, 2000 - 2005 and illustrated the complex intersections of <b>locality,</b> <b>class,</b> gender and social networks in the constructions of their identities and health related practices. It considered young people’s health in a broad perspective, how it is experienced and lived out at a practical level. By focusing on locality, this research highlights how health related practices are interpreted by young people in the context of cultural norms and practices within their social networks. Understanding how locality and social context shapes young peoples attitudes to and participation in health related behaviours has relevance for public health policy and practice. I will discuss how public health needs to strive for better understandings of young people’s diverse cultures and meanings of health related behaviours within contextualized settings in order to develop more effective health promotion strategies. A challenge for public health is to incorporate more sophisticated analyses of young people’s health, and to address the diversity of young people’s health as complex, multifaceted, social and cultura...|$|E

The Inventing Adulthoods (IA) archive currently consists of qualitative interview transcripts for 30 young people interviewed up to six times. Transcripts for a further 20 young people {{will be included in}} the archive in the near future. Inventing Adulthoods is a qualitative longitudinal (QL) study that 'walked alongside' young people as they moved from early teenage years to young adulthood in five contrasting areas of England and Northern Ireland. This dataset showcases the biographical material collected between 1998 and 2004, providing a unique window on many aspects of young people's lives {{at the turn of the}} 21 st century. The case data for each of these young people comprise biographical data that illustrate change over time in most aspects of their lives: home and family, leisure, education, work, relationships, identity and adulthood. Interview 1 : focuses more specifically on moral development Interview 2 : includes perceptions of life chances and the future, as well as reflections on the research process Interview 3 : if young people had responded to the memory book research method, this involves data based on discussion of the content of the memory book. If not, the content reflects that of Interview 2 Interview 4 : includes material on social perceptions and responses to issues of social exclusion and reflections on the research process Interview 5 : includes material on perceptions of community, networks and social change Interview 6 : includes material on spirituality and responses to the researcher's interpretations of the case narrative The focus for investigation shifted from values, to adulthood, to social capital across these three studies. However, a consistent concern was to investigate agency and the 'reflexive project of self'; values and the construction of adult identity; how the social and material environment in which young people grow up acts to shape the values and identities that they adopt; and the impact of globalisation on the individual. Working with the complexity of young people's accounts, the study focused on the dynamic interplay between the individual, the resources available to them and the structuring effects of time, <b>locality,</b> <b>class</b> and gender. The study also offers considerable methodological potential not only for the further development of prospective QL methodology and biographical and case history approaches but also for application to policy and practice. Further information is available at the project's site, Inventing Adulthoods. In September 2011, the title was shorted to Inventing Adulthoods, 1996 - 2006 to describe the current data collection. For the third edition (July 2011), 44 semi-structured interview transcripts with 10 new, young female respondents were added to the data collection (5777 int 108 to 5777 int 151).

40|$|Little {{attention}} has been directed at how locality shapes young adolescents attitudes to, and participation in, a range of health related practices. This thesis explores the talk of twenty-five 11 - 13 year old young people from diverse socio-economic households who live in Lyttelton, New Zealand and illustrates the complex intersections of <b>locality,</b> <b>class,</b> gender and social networks {{in the construction of}} their identities and health related practices. It investigates this complexity by examining young people’s active engagement with their social contexts. It draws on various conceptual frameworks from social theory including the social studies of childhood, materialist/discursive analysis, a critical application of Bourdieu’s theory of practice and qualitative methodology to understand young people’s own perspectives; how they make sense of and (re) create the health cultures in which they participate. It considers young people’s health in a broad perspective, and how it is experienced and lived out at a practical level, in the everyday lives of young people. This thesis addresses a set of key questions: how do participants make sense of their locatedness in Lyttelton? How are they enabled and constrained by their location, in particular social networks? How do they construct their identities and how are social networks, locality, gender and class relevant to this construction? How do young people who participated in this study negotiate, contest and take up health related practices? How can this research inform youth-focused health promotion? It highlights how young people are articulate and knowledgeable about the settings that structure their lives. It examines the complex relationship between social processes such as class and gender, participants’ interactions in these processes and their active identity-making. This approach highlights a situated understanding of young people’s agency. The analytic focus of this thesis is to understand young people’s health behaviours as social practices performed in specific social contexts. By focusing on a locality, this research highlights how health related practices are interpreted by young people in the context of cultural norms and practices within their social networks. Understanding how locality and social context shapes young people 2 ̆ 7 s attitudes to and participation in health related behaviours has relevance for public health practice. Examining the relationships between young people’s social contexts and practices within an appreciation of their embeddedness in social structures helps in understanding the complexity of young people’s health related practices. This research highlights how health related practices take place in specific cultural contexts, where the contexts influence the ways that these practices are experienced. Public health needs to strive for better understandings of young people’s cultures and meanings of health related behaviours within contextualised settings in order to develop more effective health promotion strategies.

40|$|The {{analysis}} {{presented in}} this paper provides a development of the idea that subject agreement markers in Bantu can be analysed as pronouns.

The relevant context includes both the wider, pragmatic context as well as the relation between overt subject and agreeing subject marker, and thus includes word-order variation between subject-verb and verb-subject structures. Lexical restrictions on the interpretation of subject markers interact with different ways in which logical subjects can be syntactically related to the verb, expressing different information structure relations such as topic and focus. By employing the Dynamic Syntax notion of incremental growth of semantic representations, a formal analysis is developed which shows how the interaction between context, word-order and lexical information from agreement markers results in the step-by-step development of the context-specific interpretation...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a mixed methods study of {{individual}} and collective anti-wind energy activism in the UK, USA and Europe. A ‘grounded theory’ approach {{was taken to the}} generation of theoretical material in that research questions evolved as the research progressed and no ‘a priori’ hypotheses were proposed. However, the initial aims of the research were: to assess the applicability of the ‘NIMBY’ label; to investigate the extent of the anti-wind activist network and to judge whether the phenomenon could legitimately be described as a ‘social movement’. The research involved two types of quantitative analysis: Social Network Analysis of hyperlink and real world network data; and an assessment of the strength of Place Attachment for anti-wind energy activists. Qualitative analysis of semi-structured interview and biographical data was also used to gain an understanding of the characteristics of leading anti-wind activists: their similarities, differences, motivations, underpinning ideologies and biographical trajectories. The thesis frames the development and deployment of wind energy as a strategic response of advanced capitalism to geopolitical factors and historic energy crises. New forms of energy generate new relations of production and externalities which impact on <b>localities</b> and <b>class</b> interests. For onshore wind energy, these particularly (but not exclusively) affect elements of the rural middle class who have deeply entrenched views of the ‘pastoral ideal’. A conceptual model is developed to show how the expansion of industrial wind energy presents instrumental and ideological challenges to this ideal, and to identities. As a consequence individual and collective protests take place. These are sufficiently organised, connected, purposive and large-scale as to qualify as a social movement. The thesis contributes to Social Movement and Social Network theory by combining quantitative and qualitative methods to better understand anti-wind activis...|$|R

Fourteen to sixteen year old boys in Brockhill lead homosocial lives and learn about sex and develop their sexual identities almost entirely from males. Hetero-sexuality is taken-for-granted as the cultural norm. There is considerable ambivalence about heterosexual sex, however, because of the gulf between male and female worlds, the inconsistencies between the dominant norm of teenage male sexuality and the boys' own personal experiences and emotions, and the vulnerability of their sexual identities. Although most boys conform to the convention of talking about sex in a way that objectifies women and focuses on male gratification, this discourse does not always reflect their more private views, particularly amongst those most familiar with girls. Several of these latter respondents expressed frustration with the passive role to which girls usually conform. There is a strong sense of the social construction of sexuality, but resignation to the idea that existing norms are inevitable...|$|R

It {{arose in}} the course of social and political troubles and complications, analogous to those of our own time on earth, and was, indeed, the last of a number of political and religious experiments dating back to the first dawn of philosophical state-craft in Greece. That hasty despair of specialisation for government that gave our poor world individualism, democratic liberalism, and anarchism, and that curious disregard of the fund of enthusiasm and self-sacrifice in men, which is the fundamental weakness of worldly economics, do not appear in the history of Utopian thought. All that history is pervaded with the recognition of the fact that self-seeking is no more the whole of human life than the satisfaction of hunger; that it is an essential of a man's existence no doubt, and that under stress of evil circumstances it may as entirely obsess him as would the food hunt during famine, but that life may pass beyond to an illimitable world of emotions and effort. Every sane person consists of possibilities beyond the unavoidable needs, is capable of disinterested feeling, even if it amounts only to enthusiasm for a sport or an industrial employment well done, for an art, or for a <b>locality</b> or <b>class.</b> In our world now, as in the Utopian past, this impersonal energy of a man goes out into religious emotion and work, into patriotic effort, into artistic enthusiasms, into games and amateur employments, and an enormous proportion of the whole world's fund of effort wastes itself in religious and political misunderstandings and conflicts, and in unsatisfying amusements and unproductive occupations. In a modern Utopia there will, indeed, be no perfection; in Utopia there must also be friction, conflicts and waste, but the waste will be enormously less than in our world. And the co-ordination of activities this relatively smaller waste will measure, will be the achieved end for which the order of the samurai was first devised.|$|R

Allozyme genotype frequencies for all loci {{were consistent with}} random mating expectations at each <b>locality</b> and age <b>class.</b> Fish from all sites had comparable levels of enzyme polymorphism and heterozygosity regardless of the associated sediment PAH concentrations. Allozyme frequencies for 12 of 15 loci were homogeneous for mummichog from all localities except that allozyme frequencies were significantly different for the Idh- 2 locus of (adult and juvenile) mummichog at the heavily-contaminated Atlantic Wood site relative to all other sites. Additionally, allele frequency differences were noted for Ldh-C and Gpi- 1 among juvenile mummichog. Values for Fst were 0. 0254 and 0. 0141 in the juvenile and adult samples, respectively, indicating greater among-locality genetic differentiation for juvenile mummichog than for adults.

Using ten polymorphic microsatellite loci we compared {{various aspects of the}} large-scale genetic diversity of individuals from 30 sites in the native distribution range with those from 30 sites in the European adventive distribution range. To investigate the ascertained pattern of genetic diversity of this intercontinental comparison further, we surveyed fine-scale genetic diversity patterns and changes over time within four highly invasive populations in the adventive range. Results: Our data show that at the large scale the genetic diversity found within the relatively small adventive range in Central Europe, surprisingly, equals the diversity found within the sampled area in the native range, which is about thirty times larger. Bayesian assignment grouped individuals into two genetic clusters separating North American native populations from the European, non-native populations, without any strong genetic structure shown over either range. In the case of the fine scale, our comparison of genetic diversity parameters among the <b>localities</b> and age <b>classes</b> yielded no evidence of genetic diversity increase over time. We found that SGS differed across age classes within the populations under study.

Accepting the existing reserve system {{as part of the}} plan, we first selected spatially fixed surrogates for biodiversity processes; then we included those planning units that were essential for achieving targets for land classes, Proteaceae and vertebrate species; next we included areas required to accommodate population and design targets for large and medium-sized mammals; we then selected planning units required to conserve entire upland–lowland and macroclimatic gradients; and finally we resolved the options for achieving remaining targets while also con-solidating the design of conservation areas. The result was a system of conservation areas, requiring, in addition to the existing reserve system, 52 % of the remaining extant habitat in the planning domain, as well as restorable habitat, that will promote the persistence and continued diversification of much of the region’s biota in the face of ongoing habitat loss and climate change. After describing the planning process, we discuss implementation priorities in relation to conservation value and vulnerability to habita...|$|R
