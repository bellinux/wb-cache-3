5000|$|The Indian city of Jinotega {{existed before}} the Spanish arrived. It is unknown {{when the first}} Spanish settled in Jinotega. It had to be after the year 1581, because the Spanish Census of 1581 shows it was still an Indian town. Even in 1703 when missioner Fray Margil de Jesus visited Jinotega there were no {{permanent}} Spanish settlers there. However by 1731 there were some permanent ones, like Juan de Castro, othe Spaniard <b>lastnames</b> like Gadea, Duarte, Altamirano, Alburquerque, Fray Juan de Zeledon, and some soldiers. Zeledon {{is said to have}} invited some nephews to come here who let descendants who still live there: some of them are Zeledon of La Concordia, Umure and Ocotal Espeso and Pacsila, idilic communities located between the cities of Matagalpa and Jinotega.According to locals, Jinotega was founded when five Spanish families moved north from Nueva Segovia by year 1700 to settle the [...] "dry zone" [...] or [...] "zona seca" [...] community of Jocomico, Naranjo, Umure, Ocotal Espeso, which lies bout 15 kilometers south of the city.

In 1703 a large cross was placed by Spanish friar Margil de Jesus at the highest point of Chirinagua in the western edge of the city, now called Cerro de la Cruz.

The word [...] "Neighbors" [...] here should be understood as being like the ending [...] "ville" [...] or [...] "land". The interpretation as [...] "Neighbors of the Jiñocuabos" [...] is more likely to be the right one, since Jiñocuabo is a tree (Bursera simaruba (L.)

He pointed out that these two species are closely related, the first to Julis poecilopterus SCHL., the second to Julis pyrrhogramma SCHL., both from Japan. <b>Lastnamed</b> species differ from the javanese species, besides by slightly different colourmarkings, by having 14 rays in the dorsal and the anal, against 11 rays in both fins of the javanese species. BLEEKER says that but for {{the difference in the}} number of dorsal and anal rays, which is considerable, at least for this genus, he would be temped to consider the javanese species as climatic variations (“klimaatvarieteiten”) of the japanese ones. He also draws attention to the great resemblance of these four species inter se, as they are all characterised by having 4 canines anteriorly in each jaw, and the outer pair in the upper jaw greatly curved backwards. When at a later date (2, p. 100) he found that the pharyngealia inferiora of H. cyanopleura and H. pyrrhogrammatoides differ from those of {{the other members of the}} genus Halichoeres by being concave posteriorly, he created a new genus Leptojulis with L. cyanopleura as the type. It is curious that in the discussion of this new genus in the Atlas Ichthyologique (3, p. 128) BLEEKER says: “Je ne connais du genre Leptojulis que les deux espèces de mon cabinet, qui toutes les deux habitent la mer de Batavia”, and that no mention is made of the two japanese species, which formerly he considered to be so very closely related to them. We can guess why he did so, for some years later (4, p. 251) he gave an elaborate description of Julis poecilopterus and pyrrhogramma. The inferior pharyngeals are described as being not concave behind and agreeing in all respects with those of other species of Halichoeres, in which genus he now places the two species. Again, no mention is made of his species of Leptojulis, but the japanese species are now compared with Halichoeres bicolor and hyrtli, which have the same disposition of bands on the body, but differ in the number of canines and in the number of dorsal and anal rays...|$|R

5000|$|Statonia vexata quaestio.The Statonia quaestio is open.Directly cite by George Dennis, The Cities and Cemeteries of Etruria vol I pag. 467 ss. Chapter XXIV STATONIA: [...] "... If not on {{this site}} (CASTRO), where shall we place the ancient Statonia? it is a {{question}} not to be answered definitely. Pliny indeed indicates a site not far from the sea (8: Plin. XIV, 8, 5. He records the renown of its wine.), though not actually on the coast (9: Plin. III 8; cf. Strab. V. p. 226). From his and other notices of it in connection with Tarquinii, it seems highly probable that it stood close to, if not actually within the territory of that city, as Vitruvius appears to intimate (1: Vitruv. II, 7; Plin. XXXVI. 49; Varro, de Re Rust. III. 12. The <b>lastnamed</b> writer says there were immense preserves of hares, stags and wild sheep, in the ager of Statonia. Cluver thinks that Statonia could not have stood in the direct line between Tarquinii and the lake of Volsinii, because the ager Tarquiniensis extended up to that lake. Dempster offers no opinion on his own.). There is {{every reason to believe that}} Statonia stood somewhere in this northern district of the Etruscan plain, but to which of the ancient sites in this quarter, of undetermined name, to assign it, we have yet no means of deciding. Four or five miles west of Ischia lies Valentano, on a hill of black ashes, part of the lip of the great crater-lake of Bolsena. It is a larger than ischia or Farnese, but can offer no better accommodation to the traveller. From a terrace outside the walls a magnificent view of the lake is to be had, but I saw it in lowering weather, when the clouds lay like a gray pall on its waters, and only when they occasionally broke could I catch a glimpse of its broad, leaden surface, with its two islets of fabulous renown, and the headland of Capo di Monte appearing like a third. This town is supposed by Cluver to be the representative of Verentum, a place of which no express mention is made, but which he conjectures to have existed, from the persuasion of a corruption in the text of Pliny. But I cannot think he has adequate ground for this opinion (2: Cluver II. p. 516. He thinks that in Pliny's catalogue of Roman colonies in Etruria (III, 8), the [...] "Veientani" [...] of the ordinary version should be [...] "Verentani", as some readings have it, both because it comes next in the list to Vesentini- Vesentum being the island Bisentino, in the lake of Bolsena - and because Veii had ceased to exist before pliny's time. But it must venture here to differ entirely from Cluver: Pliny's list is clearly alphabetical, and has no reference to toppographical relations; and Veii, a century before Pliny's day, had been recolonised by the Romans, and was then existing as a municipium. The balance is also greatly in favour of [...] "Veientani", inasmuch as Pliny in his catalogue would surely not omit all mention of that colony, which was the nearest of all, almost within sight of the Seven Hills, and whose past history was so intimately interwoven with that of rome. if this be the correct reading, there is no proof of the existence of such a town as Verentum. Cramer, I pag. 223, follows Cluver's opinion). I perceived no traces of ancient habitation on this site, Etruscan or Roman, not could I learn that such exist. The walls are wholly mediaeval, and tombs there are none;in ttrth, the volcanic ashes and scoriae of which the hill is composed would render it impraticable to construct tombs here in the usual manner of the Etruscans. From Valentano there is a track, a mere bridle-path, to pitigliano, within the Tuscan frontier, about twelve miles distant. About midway it passes the lake of Mezzano, a small piece of water embosomed among wooded hills, which is pronounced by Cluver to be the Laces Statoniensis (Cluver II, p. 517. He speacks of it as undoubted - haud dubium est. Mannert and Cramer agree with him). That lake, however, is said by pliny and Seneca to have contained an island, which this of Mezzano does not, so that we must either reject Cluver's conclusion, or suppose that the island has since disappeared (4 plin. II, 96; Seneca, Nat. Qauest. II, 25. there are only four other lakes in Etruria which contain, or are said to have contained, islands - the Thrasymene, and lcus Prilis or Prelius. The first two are mentioned by pliny, and the second by Seneca, in addition to the Lake of Statonia, so that it cannot be confounded with them. Th Thrasymene is too much inland, secing that Statonia was not far from the coast. And of Lacus Prilis, now Lago Castiglione, may be said, what will be apply with equal force to the Thrasymene, that it is much too remote from Tarquinii; for Statonia, as already shown, was either close to or within the ager of that city.), and to have become eventually attached to the shores of the lake. Such seems to have been the case with Vadimonian lake, which is now almost choked by the encroachment of its banks on the water; and a similar process is going forward in the Lacus Cutiliae, in Sabina, and in the Sulphureous lakes below Tivoli; where masses of vegetables matter, floating on the water, assume the appearance of islands, and having had their cruise awhile, become entangled at length by some prominent rock or tree on the shore, attach themselves permanently to it, and settle down into respectable portions of terra firma.|$|R
