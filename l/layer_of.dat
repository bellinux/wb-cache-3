5|$|All whales have a thick <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> blubber. In {{species that}} {{live near the}} poles, the blubber can be as thick as 11 inches. This blubber can help with {{buoyancy}} (which is helpful for a 100-ton whale), protection to some extent as predators {{would have a hard}} time getting through a thick <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> fat, and energy for fasting when migrating to the equator; the primary usage for blubber is insulation from the harsh climate. It can constitute as much as 50% of a whale's body weight. Calves are born with only a thin <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> blubber, but some species compensate for this with thick lanugos.|$|E
5|$|Another use {{concerns}} X-ray optics, especially X-ray telescopes. The mirrors of the Chandra X-ray Observatory are {{coated with}} a <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> iridium 60nm thick. Iridium {{proved to be the}} best choice for reflecting X-rays after nickel, gold, and platinum were also tested. The iridium layer, which had to be smooth to within a few atoms, was applied by depositing iridium vapor under high vacuum on a base <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> chromium.|$|E

30|$|The 16 -ply, 30 -ply, and 34 -ply plaster casts {{each had}} 16, 30, and 34 plies of plaster, respectively. For the {{composite}} casts {{of a given}} ply (16, 30, or 34), four <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> plaster were replaced with synthetic Scotchcast. For example, a 16 -ply composite cast was composed <b>of</b> 12 <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> plaster and four <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> synthetic. A 30 -ply composite cast had 26 <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> plaster and four <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> synthetic. A 34 -ply composite cast had 30 <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> plaster and four <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> synthetic. This was done to simulate the clinical situation in which slightly less plaster is applied when an outer strength wrap of synthetic is planned.|$|R

5|$|Foundation: For {{every square}} chi, apply two dan of earth; {{on top of}} it lay a mixture of broken brick, tile and crushed stones, also two dan. For every five-cun <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> earth, two men, {{standing}} face to face, should tamp six times with pestles, each man pounding three times on a dent; then tamp four times on each dent, two men again standing face to face, each pounding twice on the same dent; then tamp two more times, each man pounding once. Following this, tamp the surface with pestles or stamp with feet randomly to even out the surface. Every five-cun <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> earth should be compressed to three cun; every three-cun <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> brick and stone to one and a half cun.|$|E
5|$|River {{dolphins}} have {{a relatively}} thin <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> blubber. Blubber can help with buoyancy, protection from predators (they {{would have a hard}} time getting through a thick <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> fat), energy for leaner times, and insulation from harsh climates. The habitats of river dolphins lack these needs.|$|E
50|$|Covering the Torso Limb Suit Assembly was an Integrated Thermal Micrometeoroid Garment (ITMG).This garment {{protected}} the suit from abrasion and {{protected the}} astronaut from thermal solar radiation and micrometeoroids which could puncture the suit.

5|$|The {{innermost}} <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> bark {{is known}} as the phloem and this is involved in the transport of the sap containing the sugars made by photosynthesis {{to other parts of the}} tree. It is a soft spongy <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> living cells, some of which are arranged end to end to form tubes. These are supported by parenchyma cells which provide padding and include fibres for strengthening the tissue. Inside the phloem is a <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> undifferentiated cells one cell thick called the vascular cambium layer. The cells are continually dividing, creating phloem cells on the outside and wood cells known as xylem on the inside.|$|E
5|$|The {{innermost}} <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> {{the heart}} is called the endocardium. It {{is made up of}} a lining of simple squamous epithelium, and covers heart chambers and valves. It is continuous with the endothelium of the veins and arteries of the heart, and is joined to the myocardium with a thin <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> connective tissue. The endocardium, by secreting endothelins, may also play a role in regulating the contraction of the myocardium.|$|E
5|$|The {{shedding}} {{of scales}} is called ecdysis, or, in normal usage moulting or sloughing. In {{the case of}} snakes, the complete outer <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> skin is shed in one layer. Snake scales are not discrete but extensions of the epidermis hence they are not shed separately, but are ejected as a complete contiguous outer <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> skin during each moult, akin to a sock being turned inside out.|$|E
5000|$|The terraced {{fields are}} built along the slope winding from the {{riverside}} {{up to the}} mountain top, between 600 to 800 m above sea level.

The first <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> tissue is black, leathery and compact, and covered with a fine <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> brownish-black hairs (a tomentum); the second layer consists of loosely interlaced brown hyphae suspended in a gelatinous matrix. The third layer is the fertile, spore-bearing surface, the brownish-black hymenium.|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of the cormorants and some terns, and in common with most other birds, all seabirds have waterproof plumage. However, compared to land birds, they have far more feathers protecting their bodies. This dense plumage is better able to protect the bird from getting wet, and cold is kept out by a dense <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> down feathers. The cormorants possess a <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> unique feathers that retain a smaller <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> air (compared to other diving birds) but otherwise soak up water. This allows them to swim without fighting the buoyancy that retaining air in the feathers causes, yet retain enough air to prevent the bird losing excessive heat through contact with water.|$|E

It {{examines}} how <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> motion, produced from the contrapuntal <b>layering</b> <b>of</b> voices, interact within each selected chorale prelude. It shows how <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> motion either align and produce synchronous rhythmic motion or misalign and produce non-synchronous rhythmic motion. In particular, this thesis investigates how alternations between synchronous and non-synchronous <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> motion correspond to and articulate both phrase form and tonal structure in these works...|$|R

5|$|A {{much larger}} star, however, is massive {{enough to create}} {{temperatures}} and pressures needed to cause the carbon in the core to begin to fuse when the star contracts {{at the end of}} the helium-burning stage. The cores of these massive stars become layered like onions as progressively heavier atomic nuclei build up at the center, with an outermost <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen gas, surrounding a <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen fusing into helium, surrounding a <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> helium fusing into carbon via the triple-alpha process, surrounding layers that fuse to progressively heavier elements. As a star this massive evolves, it undergoes repeated stages where fusion in the core stops, and the core collapses until the pressure and temperature are sufficient to begin the next stage of fusion, reigniting to halt collapse.|$|E
