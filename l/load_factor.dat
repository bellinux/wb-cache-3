5|$|The <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> (or {{capacity}} factor) for South Australian {{wind farms}} is {{usually in the}} range 32-38%. This means that a wind farm could typically produce between 32 and 38% of its nameplate capacity averaged over a year.|$|E

5|$|Alternatively, it is {{possible}} to use a lazy deletion strategy in which a key–value pair is removed by replacing the value by a special flag value indicating a deleted key. However, these flag values will contribute to the <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> of the hash table. With this strategy, it may become necessary to clean the flag values out of the array and rehash all the remaining key–value pairs once too large a fraction of the array becomes occupied by deleted keys.|$|E
40|$|As {{early as}} the 1950 s ACI began {{publishing}} papers on <b>load</b> <b>factors</b> {{for the design of}} concrete structures. These early <b>load</b> <b>factors</b> were primarily based on heuristic arguments, and the experience and judgment of the code framers. Later on, ASCE 7 codified the use of <b>load</b> <b>factors</b> based on a reliability framework. Although these <b>load</b> <b>factors</b> have produced safe structures, several issues suggest the need for a more transparent design approach, particularly for conditions beyond the code framework. After a review of the basis of <b>load</b> <b>factors,</b> partial <b>load</b> <b>factors</b> are evaluated, and related issues identifi d.

Measured <b>loading</b> <b>factors</b> are linear function of a flow coefficient at an impeller exit. The performance does not depend on the compressibility criterion. To simulate <b>loading</b> <b>factor</b> performances, the authors present two parameters: a <b>loading</b> <b>factor</b> at zero flow rate and an angle between an ordinate and performance line.

5|$|From 3 June to 30 September 1960, Braathens SAFE {{was granted}} {{concession}} {{on the route}} from Oslo via Sandefjord Airport, Torp to Aalborg Airport in Denmark. This became possible because SAS had abandoned the route the previous year. It was flown with a DC-3, giving an 80% <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> On 22 July, the Braathens SAFE applied for a three-year concession, but this was rejected because SAS stated that they would restart the route. In 1961, SAS started the route Stavanger–Kristiansand–Ålborg, and in 1963 on the route Oslo–Kristiansand–Ålborg. The concession allowed SAS to also take passengers on the domestic legs, giving Braathens SAFE competition on the routes to Kristiansand.|$|E
5|$|In September, SAS {{announced}} that if Braathens {{took the first}} step to reduce capacity between Bergen and Oslo, they would follow immediately to reduce the overcapacity in the combined 37 daily departures. However, Braathens was not willing to reduce. On 15 September, Color Air {{announced that}} they would start flying five round trips from Oslo to Stavanger Airport, Sola on 1 October, following the delivery of their fourth aircraft. At the same time, the airline would reduce the number of round trips to Ålesund from four to two. The <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> in August was 43%, and management stated that 50% load would not be sufficient to make money. In particular, the company stated that while aircraft were full during the weekends, the company was not succeeding at garnering the necessary business ridership to fill up the planes during the weekdays. To become more attractive, the company changed its fares to two classes: Business Full Flex and Saver No Flex. The company also stated that to attract more business travelers, it was looking for an international partner to conduct codesharing on international routes, and perhaps also introduce a frequent flyer program alone or in cooperation with the partner.|$|E
25|$|Average <b>load</b> <b>factor,</b> {{in transit}} systems, is {{the ratio of}} the total number of riders to the total {{theoretical}} capacity. A transit vehicle running at full capacity has a 100% <b>load</b> <b>factor,</b> while an empty vehicle has 0% <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> If a transit vehicle spends half the time running at 100% and half the time running at 0%, the average <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> is 50%. Higher average <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> corresponds to lower energy consumption per passenger, so designers attempt to maximize this metric.|$|E

25|$|Scheduled {{mass transit}} (i.e. buses or trains) trades off service {{frequency}} and <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> Buses and trains must {{run on a}} predefined schedule, even during off-peak times when demand is low and vehicles are nearly empty. So to increase <b>load</b> <b>factor,</b> transportation planners try to predict times of low demand, and run reduced schedules or smaller vehicles at these times. This increases passengers' wait times. In many cities, trains and buses do not run at all at night or on weekends.|$|E
