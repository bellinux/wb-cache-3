500|$|Broadcasters {{sometimes}} make sweeping changes to winning songs {{before they go}} to Eurovision. For example, at Melodifestivalen 1961, Siw Malmkvist won with [...] "April, April". Performing after her victory, she stumbled on the lyrics of the song and <b>laughed</b> <b>out</b> loud. The press criticised this as childish. SR replaced her with Lill-Babs for the Eurovision Song Contest. The 1987 winner [...] "Fyra bugg och en Coca Cola", performed by Lotta Engberg, is another example; the song's title was changed to [...] "Boogaloo" [...] for Eurovision, as use of a brand name was against the Contest's rules. This name was chosen as Sweden's two previous Eurovision winners had also included the suffix [...] "-loo".|$|E
500|$|Kidd's {{work for}} the 1954 film Seven Brides for Seven Brothers brought him acclaim. [...] The film was {{directed}} by Stanley Donen, with music by Saul Chaplin and Gene de Paul and lyrics by Johnny Mercer. It was written directly for the screen {{and based on the}} short story [...] "The Sobbin' Women", by Stephen Vincent Benét, which was based in turn on the ancient Roman legend of The Rape of the Sabine Women. He initially turned down the assignment, recalling in 1997: [...] "Here are these slobs living off in the woods. They have no schooling, they are uncouth, there's manure on the floor, the cows come in and out—and they're gonna get up and dance? We'd be <b>laughed</b> <b>out</b> of the house." ...|$|E

Hershock, in {{discussing}} these terms in the context of performative utterances, points out the difference between telling someone that one is <b>laughing</b> <b>out</b> loud and actually <b>laughing</b> <b>out</b> loud: [...] "The latter response is a straightforward action. The former is a self-reflexive representation of an action: I not only do something but also show you that I am doing it. Or indeed, I may not actually <b>laugh</b> <b>out</b> loud but may use the locution 'LOL' to communicate my appreciation of your attempt at humor." ...|$|R

500|$|Colbert, a {{historian}} and former head writer {{on the television}} quiz show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, {{became interested in the}} books and bought the first novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, to see what the story was about. As he was reading, he began to notice mythological references in the book. He commented: [...] "I almost <b>laughed</b> <b>out</b> loud when I came across the three-headed dog [...] I instantly knew it was a reference to Cerberus, the threeheaded beast which Ancient Greeks believed guarded the gates to the Underworld." [...] Inspired by this, Colbert continued to search the book for more references and noticed that most characters' names are based on their personality and every magic creature is a reference to mythology and folklore.|$|E
500|$|Tommy Smith, booked {{during the}} game for his tackle on Clarke, had been called to the hearing to give evidence. He {{condemned}} the whole affair as a farce. Smith confirmed that the initial foul on Keegan was committed by Johnny Giles, not Bremner, but Bremner was the first Leeds player Keegan saw {{when he turned to}} retaliate. Smith says that as soon as he came into the hearing, an unnamed FA official immediately accused him of starting all the trouble with his [...] "very first tackle of the game". Smith retorted that the man was not even at the game and so how could he know that? The FA official replied by saying: [...] "This is a democratic hearing of the evidence, you're not allowed to ask questions". Smith says he <b>laughed</b> <b>out</b> loud at the absurdity of that statement. At this point Matt Busby, who was on the FA committee, intervened and said: [...] "I saw what happened. That'll be all, Tommy, thanks for coming". Smith says he left the room [...] "wondering how it was possible that a person such as that committee member could have {{a key role in the}} running of football in this country".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally mixed reviews. IGN contributor Robert Canning {{felt that}} the episode [...] "didn't have the same comedic appeal" [...] as [...] "Klaus and Greta", but did say there were [...] "some funny moments to be sure", but overall the episode lacked. He commented that the main plot had its faults, but that the weak link in the story was Cheyenne Jackson's Danny. He wrote that the Sue character had been great in the past, but that her [...] "expanded role" [...] in this episode was less successful. In conclusion, Canning gave the episode a 7.5 out of 10 rating. The A.V. Clubs Todd VanDerWerff wrote that [...] "Black Light Attack!" [...] was [...] "dead in spots. I mean, I <b>laughed</b> <b>out</b> loud a number of times, {{but not nearly as}} much". He noted he liked Liz and Jack battling over Danny, but [...] "something about it never landed in the way it should have", and opined that the show {{did not know what to}} do with Jackson. Overall, he gave the episode a B rating. Sean Gandert for Paste {{felt that the}} Liz, Jack, and Danny plot was less interesting [...] "and in general pretty meh." [...] He noted that [...] "Black Light Attack!" [...] was [...] "a big let-down" [...] after the airing of [...] "Klaus and Greta". Leonard Pierce for The A.V. Club called the episode uneven.|$|E

500|$|Spence D. of IGN {{stated that}} [...] "the only draw for this album {{are the three}} new tracks and the three remixes." [...] He further commented that Most Wanted is a [...] "filler album" [...] and that [...] "he new songs that are served up still show Duff chasing trends rather than setting them and {{actively}} searching for her own voice and image." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine was critical of the album writing he [...] "literally <b>laughed</b> <b>out</b> loud when I heard the Duffster was releasing a best-of album titled Most Wanted." [...] He praised the Dead Executives produced tracks and concluded the review by writing that [...] "apparently there aren't even enough bearable moments in Duff's recording career to fill one CD". Gabriel Leong of MTV Southeast Asia started the review by writing [...] "A greatest hits album seems a tad flagrant when you've only had two albums so far. So let's call this one a compilation album instead." [...] Leong noted that the title fitted the album perfectly and that it proves [...] "its innocuous appeal of infectious bubblegum pop." [...] David Hiltbrand of The Philadelphia Inquirer commented that it was [...] "a little early in the career" [...] to release a greatest hits album and that it showcased that [...] "Duff is more product than talent." [...] Aidin Vaziri of San Francisco Chronicle also commented that it was premature as {{it was too early}} in Duff's career to release a greatest hits compilation. He commended the new tracks produced by the Dead Executives writing that they [...] "help alleviate the feeling that this is a total cash grab." [...] In 2006, Rolling Stone included the album in their Lamest Greatest Hits Albums Ever list.|$|E

2500|$|Following his {{graduation}} {{from high school}} in 1988, Parker spent a semester at Berklee College of Music before transferring to the University of Colorado at Boulder. During his time there, he took a film class in which students were required to collaborate on projects. In the course, he met Matt Stone — a math major from the nearby town of Littleton — and the two immediately bonded over provocative, anti-authoritarian humor and Monty Python. Parker's first film was titled Giant Beavers of Southern Sri Lanka (1989), parodying Godzilla-style rampages with beavers; fellow student Jason McHugh later remarked that the idea nearly got him <b>laughed</b> <b>out</b> of class. Parker and Stone wrote and acted in many short films together, among those First Date, Man on Mars and Job Application. Parker later remarked that he and Stone would shoot a film nearly every week, but he has since lost most of them. Parker first used a construction paper animation technique on American History (1992), a short film made for his college animation class. It became an unexpected sensation, resulting in Parker's first award — a Student Academy Award. Parker recalled sitting in the auditorium in front of students from animation schools such as CalArts, who had produced works of a higher artistic caliber and were [...] "fuming" [...] that he won.|$|E

The latest commercial film is titled [...] "LOL" [...] (acronym for <b>Laugh</b> <b>Out</b> Loud or <b>Laughing</b> <b>Out</b> Loud), starring Miley Cyrus and Demi Moore.
