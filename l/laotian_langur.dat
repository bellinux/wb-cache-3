50|$|The <b>Laotian</b> <b>langur</b> or white-browed black langur (Trachypithecus laotum) is {{a species}} of primate in the family Cercopithecidae. It is endemic to Laos. Its natural habitat is {{subtropical}} or tropical dry forests. Genetically the Indochinese black and Hatinh langurs {{are very close to}} the <b>Laotian</b> <b>langur,</b> and consequently it has been suggested they should be considered subspecies of it.|$|E
50|$|This diurnal, largely {{arboreal}} langur {{is social}} and typically seen {{in groups of}} 2-15, but occasionally groups may number as many as 30 individuals. It has often been considered a subspecies of the François' langur, but was elevated to a full species by Bradon-Jones in 1995, and {{this was followed by}} Groves, 2005. Both, however, listed it as a subspecies in 2004, and genetic work suggest it should be considered a subspecies of the <b>Laotian</b> <b>langur</b> (T. laotum). Morphological and genetic data also suggests the Indochinese black langur (T. ebenus) is a morph of the Hatinh langur.|$|E
50|$|Delacour's langur is {{somewhat}} larger than its two closest relatives, François' langur and the <b>Laotian</b> <b>langur,</b> {{but in other}} respects has a similar appearance. Adults measure from 57 to 62 cm in head-body length, with a tail 82 to 88 mm long. Males weigh between 7.5 and 10.5 kg, while the females are slightly smaller, weighing between 6.2 and 9.2 kg. Their fur is predominantly black, with white markings on the face and distinctive creamy-white fur over the rump and the outer thighs, while females also have a patch of pale fur in the pubic area. Like other closely related lutungs, Delacour's langur has a crest of long, upright, hair over the forehead and crown; this is, however, somewhat taller and narrower than in other species.|$|E
