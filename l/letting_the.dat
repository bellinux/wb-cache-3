5|$|A solitary male {{purple-throated cotinga}} attracts a female by {{perching}} above the canopy and <b>letting</b> <b>the</b> sun highlight its iridescent plumage.

5|$|Beetles are {{sometimes}} used as instruments: the Onabasulu of Papua New Guinea historically used the weevil Rhynchophorus ferrugineus as {{a musical instrument}} by <b>letting</b> <b>the</b> human mouth serve as a variable resonance chamber for the wing vibrations of the live adult beetle.|$|E

5|$|By the 2010s the {{building}} was owned by Enterprise Inns, who own around 5,500 pubs in the UK. Despite advertising for a new lease of {{the building}} in circa 2013 whilst <b>letting</b> <b>the</b> property for a peppercorn rent, Enterprise Inns ultimately decided to sell the property as a freehold in March 2015. No offers to continue operating the building as a pub were received, although some offers were received from developers seeking to redevelop the property, perhaps due to the substantial refurbishment of the building that was required.|$|E

5|$|Conceived by Amusement Vision head Toshihiro Nagoshi, Super Monkey Ball {{involves}} guiding {{a transparent}} ball containing {{one of four}} monkeys—AiAi, MeeMee, Baby, and GonGon—across a series of maze-like platforms.

There are also several multiplayer modes: independent minigames as well as extensions of the main single-player game.|$|E
5|$|Little {{research}} has been done on this species, and not much is known about its ecology. The purple-throated cotinga is primarily frugivorous, although it does occasionally eat small insects. A solitary male attracts a female by perching in the canopy and <b>letting</b> <b>the</b> sunlight reflect off its iridescent feathers. It is suspected to breed year-round and is non-migratory. Despite being considered naturally uncommon or rare across its vast range, the purple-throated cotinga is listed as a species of Least Concern.|$|E

The Doctor and Amy return to the TARDIS, where Amy sights her future self on the hillside without Rory. The Doctor takes out the object he pulled from the crack: a burnt piece of the TARDIS's sign. He worriedly compares it to the real thing. Aside from the damage, they appear identical.|$|E

5|$|Some months later, {{the town}} has {{constructed}} a statue of the Giant in its memory, friendship, and heroism, and Dean and Annie are starting a relationship. Hogarth receives a package from Rogard, a bolt from the Giant being the only remnant they could find. That night, Hogarth sees the bolt trying to move on its own, and he opens the window, <b>letting</b> <b>the</b> bolt roll free. The bolt joins many other parts as they converge on the Giant's head on the Langjökull glacier in Iceland. The Giant's head activates, and he smiles as he puts itself back together.|$|E
5|$|The Warden of the Fleet Prison, who {{was also}} keeper of Westminster Hall, was tasked with keeping it clean and <b>letting</b> <b>the</b> shops and booths along the sides. Despite acting as gaoler to the Exchequer of Pleas, Court of Chancery and Star Chamber {{as part of his}} duties the Warden was {{considered}} an officer of the Court of Common Pleas. All court officers were appointed for life, and could only be removed for misbehaviour. Despite this, the sheer number of positions meant that several came up for reappointment in each Chief Justice's tenure, and selling them could be very profitable.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} reasons for showing Oscar's head and {{shoulders}} within the frame during the flashback scenes, rather than <b>letting</b> <b>the</b> camera be the character's eyes. The first was {{that this is the}} way Noé usually sees himself in dreams and when recalling past events. He also thought it would be easier for the viewer to care about a character who is visible, as many point-of-view films, in his opinion, look unintentionally funny.|$|E

5|$|Throughout Edwards' three {{terms as}} governor, he showed a {{willingness}} to surrender his own considerable powers in order to expand participatory government in the Illinois Territory. Before 1812, while Illinois had a first-grade territorial status, Edwards had vast powers to appoint county and local officials; however, he made it his practice to consider local opinion {{as much as he}} could when making appointments, often giving weight to petitions signed by local residents. He attempted to do the same for militia officers for a time, <b>letting</b> <b>the</b> men of a unit elect their leaders, but he soon abandoned this policy as impractical.|$|E
5|$|Butlin's, {{the holiday}} camp giant {{purchased}} No. 46229 Duchess of Hamilton following {{the withdrawal of}} this locomotive in February 1964 and it was put {{on display at the}} Minehead holiday camp. In 1975, following a slow deterioration due to the Minehead's salty atmosphere and the looming maintenance costs, Butlin's signed a twenty-year loan agreement for it to be taken under the wing of the National Railway Museum. In 1976, following a cosmetic overhaul, No. 46229 was put on static display in the museum's York premises. In due course a fundraising appeal allowed an overhaul to take place as a precursor to <b>letting</b> <b>the</b> locomotive operate on the national rail network once more.|$|E
5|$|During the mid-1990s, {{television}} critics praised Jennings for {{his insistence}} on not <b>letting</b> <b>the</b> O.J. Simpson murder case swamp the newscast. Instead, Jennings devoted his energies to covering the War in Bosnia and Herzegovina, anchoring three hour-long prime time specials {{on the subject}} and one Saturday-morning special aimed at children. ABC dedicated more time to covering the conflict than any other network from 1992 to 1996. Jennings received the Goldsmith Career Award for Excellence in Journalism from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, in large part for his passion for the story. Jennings was also credited for raising the profile in the U.S. of another international story, the 1995 Quebec referendum. The Canadian press in particular raved about his in-depth coverage of the issue, {{and he was the}} only anchor to broadcast from Canada {{on the eve of the}} referendum.|$|E

5|$|Gravel {{actively}} {{campaigned for}} the office of Vice President of the United States during the 1972 presidential election, announcing on June 2, 1972, over a month before the 1972 Democratic National Convention began, that he was interested in running for the nomination should the choice be opened up to convention delegates. Towards this end he began soliciting delegates for their support in advance of the convention. He was not alone in this effort, as former Governor of Massachusetts Endicott Peabody had been running a quixotic campaign for the same post since the prior year. Likely presidential nominee George McGovern was in fact considering the unusual move of naming three or four acceptable vice-presidential candidates and <b>letting</b> <b>the</b> delegates choose.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Lyn was in deep {{financial}} difficulties {{after having been}} promoted to the Elite League after the 1991 season. To create additional liquidity, the club sold its 44% share in Ullevaal to the Football Association for NOK4.4 million in January 1993. At the same time, NFF bought the 5.1% stake owned by the other clubs, making NFF the sole owner of the stadium. In October, the limited company Lyn Fotball AS was founded {{to take over the}} elite football teams in Lyn. At the same time, the club announced that it planned to purchase back their shares in Ullevaal Stadion, by <b>letting</b> <b>the</b> club take up a loan.|$|E
