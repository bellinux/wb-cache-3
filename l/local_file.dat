5|$|Windows 8.1 adds tighter {{integration}} with several Microsoft-owned services. OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) is integrated {{at the system}} level to sync user settings and files. Files are automatically downloaded in the background when they are accessed from the user's OneDrive folder, unless they are marked to be available offline. By default, only file metadata and thumbnails are stored locally, and reparse points are used to {{give the appearance of}} a normal directory structure to provide backwards compatibility. The OneDrive app was updated to include a <b>local</b> <b>file</b> manager. OneDrive use on Windows 8.1 requires that a user's Windows account be linked to a Microsoft account; the previous SkyDrive desktop client (which did not have this requirement) is not supported on Windows 8.1.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Kinne was {{associated}} with two mysterious deaths. On March 19 of that year, her husband, James Kinne, was found {{shot in the head}} with the couple's two-year-old daughter playing nearby. Sharon Kinne claimed that the little girl, who had often been allowed to play with her father's guns, had accidentally shot him, and police were initially unable to disprove this theory. The case was closed as an accidental death and remained that way until the evening of May 27, when the body of twenty-three-year-old Patricia Jones, a <b>local</b> <b>file</b> clerk, was found by Kinne and a boyfriend in a secluded area. Investigation showed that Jones had been the wife of another of Kinne's boyfriends, and that Jones's husband had tried to break off his affair with Kinne shortly before Patricia Jones went missing. When Kinne admitted to having been the last person to speak to Patricia Jones, she was charged with Jones's death and, upon further investigation of his death, with the murder of James Kinne.|$|E
25|$|Some file {{managers}} provide {{network connectivity}} via protocols, such as FTP, NFS, SMB or WebDAV. This {{is achieved by}} allowing the user to browse for a file server (connecting and accessing the server's file system like a <b>local</b> <b>file</b> system) or by providing its own full client implementations for file server protocols.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{the main}} C API of QuickTime {{where it is}} {{necessary}} to call MoviesTask in a loop to load a media file, DirectShow handles all of this in a transparent way. It creates several background threads that smoothly play the requested file or URL without much work required from the programmer. Also in contrast to QuickTime, nothing special is required for loading a URL instead of a <b>local</b> <b>file</b> on diskDirectShow's filter graph abstracts these details from the programmer, although recent developments in QuickTime (including an ActiveX control) have reduced this disparity.|$|E
25|$|KeePass Password Safe is a {{free and}} {{open-source}} password manager primarily for Windows. It officially supports macOS and Linux operating systems {{through the use of}} Mono. Additionally, there are several unofficial ports for Windows Phone, Android, iOS, and BlackBerry devices. KeePass stores usernames, passwords, and other fields, including free-form notes and file attachments, in an encrypted file. This file can be protected by a master password, key file, and/or the current Windows account details. By default, the KeePass database is stored on a <b>local</b> <b>file</b> system (as opposed to cloud storage).|$|E
25|$|Windows Search indexes offline caches {{of network}} shares, in {{addition}} to the <b>local</b> <b>file</b> systems, Microsoft Outlook e-mail stores and Microsoft OneNote stores indexed by WDS Windows Search also supports queries against a remote index. This means if the file server, on which a network file share is hosted, is running either Windows Vista or a later version of Windows or Windows Search 4.0 on Windows XP, any searches against the share will be queried against the server's index and present the results to the client system, filtering out the files the user does not have access to. This procedure is transparent to the user.|$|E

25|$|Other {{high-level}} mechanisms may read in {{and process}} larger parts or the complete FAT on startup or on demand when needed and dynamically build up in-memory tree {{representations of the}} volume's file structures different from the on-disk structures. This may, on volumes with many free clusters, occupy even less memory than {{an image of the}} FAT itself. In particular on highly fragmented or filled volumes, seeks become much faster than with linear scans over the actual FAT, even if an image of the FAT would be stored in memory. Also, operating on the logically high level of files and cluster-chains instead of on sector or track level, it becomes possible to avoid some degree of file fragmentation in the first place or to carry out <b>local</b> <b>file</b> defragmentation and reordering of directory entries based on their names or access patterns in the background.|$|E

50|$|The {{combination}} of both techniques is intended to ensure streams cannot be sniffed and stored into a <b>local</b> <b>file,</b> as SWF verification is intended to prevent third party clients from accessing the content. However, it does not achieve this goal. Third party clients are free to write the decrypted content to a <b>local</b> <b>file</b> simply by knowing the hash of the SWF file and its size. In practice, therefore, Adobe's own implementation of the Macromedia Flash Player is the only client which does not allow saving to a <b>local</b> <b>file.</b>|$|E
