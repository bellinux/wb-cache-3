25|$|Abrahams {{reached the}} {{conclusion}} that the only solution was to end the status of resident native, leaving him free to quit the estate or to stay there on terms satisfactory both to himself and the landlord, substituting contractual for statutory rights. The 1948 <b>Land</b> <b>Planning</b> Committee of senior civil servants did not wholly agree with Abraham’s recommendations, holding the view that 'African and European enterprise in Nyasaland are complementary and inter-dependent; neither can progress without the goodwill of the other; both must be prepared to co-operate for their mutual benefit and progress'. Under this two-fold policy land could still, under certain conditions, be alienated to non-Africans.|$|E

In 1941 the Service published its first comprehensive report, A Study of the Park and Recreation Problem in the United States, a careful review of the whole problem of recreation and of national, state, county, and municipal parks in the United States. Interrupted by World War II, Director Wirth arranged for these studies to be resumed with the inception of Mission 66, and a second comprehensive report was published in 1964 entitled Parks for America, A Survey of Park and Related Resources in the Fifty States and a Preliminary Plan. Numerous <b>land</b> <b>planning</b> studies of individual areas, river basins, and regions accompanied and supported these comprehensive reports. The four new types of Federal Recreation Areas added to the System between 1933 and 1964 were generally consistent with recommendations in these studies.|$|E
25|$|On 5 October 1992, the Board of Governors of the Bundesbahn and the Reichsbahn {{determined}} {{the route of}} the new line. The spatial planning procedure was launched on 20October 1992. The Free State of Bavaria gave its opinion on the 1March 1993. It confirmed the compatibility of two options with the goals of <b>land</b> <b>planning.</b> The essential requirements were an ICE stop in Coburg, the replacement of embankments by bridges in ecologically sensitive areas, the relocation of the planned over-taking station in Dorfles-Esbach to the south and the lowest possible crossing of the Main valley to the north of Ebensfeld. An option, which involved a route through Coburg, was abandoned in this context. In its opinion of 20 April 1993, the State of Thuringia sought, among others, an Interregio stop in the Ilmenau area, a shift of the line in the Gehren / Gräfinau-Angstedt area to the west, a western bypass of Molsdorf to protect the drinking water catchment area of Erfurt and the bundling of the route with the A71 autobahn between Erfurt and Ilmenau. The planning approval procedure (as of mid-1994) would be carried out jointly in accordance with the railway law for both routes in this section.|$|E
25|$|In 1948 the {{government}} {{set up a}} <b>Land</b> <b>Planning</b> Committee, whose first report recommended that government should re-acquire land which was either undeveloped or occupied by large numbers of Africans. This included the projected re-purchase of {{about two-thirds of the}} British Central Africa Company’s freehold land. The company had long fought to retain its landholdings, much of which was undeveloped, claiming that soil exhaustion and erosion, deforestation and poor husbandry would result if the land were resettled by smallholders. In 1948, the company was still unwilling to sell its better land to {{the government}}. However, it was prepared to sell inferior land, and in 1948 the government bought freehold land from the British Central Africa Company in the Chingale area {{in the western part of}} Zomba District to convert it to land held by customary tenure and resettle Africans evacuated from other estates in the Shire valley and highlands on it. The Chingale resettlement scheme took place from 1948 to 1954. Following a serious famine in 1949, Geoffrey Colby, the Governor of Nyasaland from 1948 to 1956, attempted to get the major estate companies to sell the under-used parts of their land to the government for resettlement. However, Colby made it clear he would not use the compulsory purchase powers he had been granted, preferring voluntary agreement. By ruling compulsion out, he gave unintended encouragement to the British Central Africa Company’s plans to retain its estates. In 1955, the Nyasaland government agreed to purchase almost 36,470 acres in Cholo District with 24,600 residents from the British Central Africa Company for resettlement. Before this, the company had owned 74,262 acres with 36,400 residents. The company retained 38,143 acres, but of the 11,800 residents, 3,240 were moved onto Crown lands. However, it was only in 1962, when independence was clearly in prospect, that the company accepted the need to sell its surplus land, retaining only its most profitable assets. At the time of its takeover by Lonrho (Malawi) Ltd in 1964, the Central Africa Company Ltd owned a 3,500 acre tea plantation, two tea factories and some other small estates. The Central Africa Company Ltd, with its remaining agricultural assets, was sold by Lonrho to African Plantations Corporation June 1997.|$|E

40|$|Some {{would say}} that <b>land</b> use <b>plans</b> are the dinosaurs of {{planning}} policy. And indeed, in almost every country in continental Europe <b>land</b> use <b>plans</b> emerged as main instruments in the earliest/almost prehistoric periods of organic planning legislation. But unlike the dinosaurs, <b>land</b> use <b>plans</b> have managed to survive {{in most of these}} countries and they have adapted successfully until now as some kind of living fossils. That is why we prefer to see them as crocodiles. Like crocodiles, <b>land</b> use <b>plans</b> appear quite frightening because of their non contemporary unattractive look and their lethal/legal power. Unfortunately, similar to the gradual extinction of crocodiles because of climate change, <b>land</b> use <b>plans</b> seem to become endangered and mainly too because of drastic changes in contextual factors. Since their features seem rather unappealing at first sight, acolytes of crocodiles as well as <b>land</b> use <b>plans</b> rarely raise their voices in the debate about their survival. However, this contribution wants to change strategy. It consciously ignores the characteristics of <b>land</b> use <b>plans</b> that might make them vulnerable. Instead, it addresses three main contextual aspects of its questionable survival. In other words it focuses on the destructive ways in which planners, policy makers and citizens more and more position <b>land</b> use <b>plans</b> as planning instruments. First, planners and policy makers seem to have almost blind faith in the power of <b>land</b> use <b>plans.</b> The latter are still too often considered, by planners as well as policy makers, as the universal solution of each planning process. This dogmatic belief burdens <b>land</b> use <b>plans</b> with impossible expectations since it ignores the original ambition of <b>land</b> use <b>plans,</b> namely offering a framework for the assessment of building permits. It also neglects the role and position of other policy instruments in consolidating the outcomes of a planning process. Secondly, convinced of the robustness of <b>land</b> use <b>plans,</b> {{in the last two decades}} policy makers in closely related policy domains such as for instance environmental, nature conservation and cultural heritage policy, have legally linked their own sectoral assessment tools to the approval process of <b>land</b> use <b>plans.</b> Despite the integrating character of planning, this strategy has led primarily to a formal overload of <b>land</b> use <b>plans</b> with sectoral policy goals what makes them obese and vulnerable. Finally, the sensitivity of individual citizens for interference of government in their private property rights has grown tremendously, even when this interference is inspired by public interests. The combination of government’s preference for <b>land</b> use <b>plans</b> as a tool to limit these rights on the one hand and the vulnerability of these plans because of the lethal amount of linked sectoral policies on the other hand, make <b>land</b> use <b>plans</b> ideal subjects for judicial procedures. Already weakened because of the combination of the first two aspects, <b>land</b> use <b>plans</b> are easy preys. Before officially declaring <b>land</b> use <b>plans</b> extinct, this contribution pleads for a drastic sanitation of the societal and political context in which <b>land</b> use <b>plans</b> have to function. We want to prevent these crocodiles from extinction because, in our opinion, <b>land</b> use <b>plans</b> still have an optimistic and meaningful life expectancy. But as crocodiles have adapted to and need a specific climate, <b>land</b> use <b>plans</b> need to be strictly used for the purposes they were generated for originally...|$|R

2500|$|As {{a result}} of the Abrahams report, in 1947 the Nyasaland {{government}} set up a <b>Land</b> <b>Planning</b> Committee of civil servants to advise on implementing its proposals and deal with the acquisition of land for re-settlement. Its original official members co-opted six representatives of the estate owners and six missionaries, but no Africans, although it took evidence from several chiefs. The committee realised the difficulty of its task, and considered it would be expensive and take time to complete. However, it was pressed to achieve results, and decided to concentrate on the Shire Highlands. [...] The committee did not go as far as Abrahams proposed, and its guiding principle was that land should be put to the best use possible, whether as working estates or African farmland. It recommended that government should only re-acquire land which was either undeveloped or occupied by large numbers of African residents or tenants. On the other hand, land capable of future “European development” (the phrase used by the <b>Land</b> <b>Planning</b> Committee) should be “protected against indiscriminate settlement and unorganised cultivation” (in Abraham’s words).|$|E
