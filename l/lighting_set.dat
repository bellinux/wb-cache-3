500|$|The Cat and the Canary is {{the product}} of early 20th century German expressionism. According to art {{historian}} Joan Weinstein, expressionism includes the art styles of Die Brücke and Der Blaue Reiter, cubism, futurism, and abstraction. The key element that connects these styles is the concern for the expression of inner feelings over verisimilitude to nature. Film historian Richard Peterson notes that [...] "German cinema became famous for stories of psychological horror and for uncanny moods generated through <b>lighting,</b> <b>set</b> design and camera angles." [...] Such filmmaking techniques drew on expressionist themes. Influential examples of German expressionist film include Robert Wiene's The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920) about a deranged doctor and Paul Leni's Waxworks (1925) about a wax figure display at a fair.|$|E

2500|$|The 1963 tree {{lighting}} {{ceremony was}} scheduled for December 18. But President Kennedy was assassinated on November 22.

[...] After a one-hour candle-lighting ceremony at the Lincoln Memorial, President Johnson traveled to the Ellipse and lit the tree. That year, the General Electric company began donating the lights for the tree, changing the <b>lighting</b> <b>set</b> every year. In addition to the life-size nativity scene, Yule log, stage, and live reindeer, the International Paper Company donated 80 cut, small Christmas trees which were decorated with white lights and erected {{in the shape of}} a [...] "Cross of Peace" [...] on the Ellipse.

2500|$|Much of {{the credit}} for this look and feel can be {{attributed}} to the hiring of Gerald Finnerman as the director of photography. Finnerman, a second-generation cinematographer, was brought up in the old school of cinematography by working with his father, Perry Finnerman, and later as a camera operator for Harry Stradling on such films as My Fair Lady and The Picture of Dorian Gray. Finnerman would then go on to be the director of photography for the TV series [...] and was responsible for creating much of the mood in that show by employing black-and-white lighting techniques for color film. This background meshed perfectly with what Caron was trying to portray in the series and earned him an Emmy nomination for the black-and-white episode “The Dream Sequence Always Rings Twice”. Hired for the show after the pilot was shot, Finnerman would become involved in virtually every aspect of the show including the scripts, <b>lighting,</b> <b>set</b> design, and even directing some of the later episodes.|$|E
