5|$|In a dogfight, {{particularly}} when attacking Allied aircraft in a <b>Lufbery</b> <b>circle,</b> Marseille would often favour dramatically reducing the throttle and even lowering the flaps {{to reduce speed}} and shorten his turn radius, rather than the standard procedure of using full throttle throughout.|$|E
5|$|Marseille {{developed}} his own special tactics, which differed {{significantly from the}} methods of most other pilots. (When attacking a <b>Lufbery</b> <b>circle)</b> he had to fly very slowly. He even {{took it to the}} point where he had to operate his landing flaps as not to fall down, because, of course he had to fly his curve (turns) more tightly than the upper defensive circle. He and his fighter were one unit, and he was in command of that aircraft like no-one else.|$|E
25|$|In combat with {{single-seater}} fighters, {{the pilots}} of F.E.2b and F.E.2d fighters would form what {{was probably the}} first use of what later became known as a <b>Lufbery</b> <b>circle</b> (defensive circle). In {{the case of the}} F.E.2, the intention was that the gunner of each aircraft could cover the blind spot under the tail of his neighbour and several gunners could fire on any enemy attacking the group. On occasion formations of F.E.2s fought their way back from far over the lines, while under heavy attack from German fighters, using this tactic.|$|E
2500|$|His {{first victory}} came on February 21, 1953, during his 18th mission as 335th FIS commander. Engaging {{a pair of}} MiGs in a [...] "dogfight", Garrison was nearly shot down as he became too focused on his quarry and failed to detect a MiG closing in from behind, then became locked into a <b>Lufbery</b> <b>circle.</b> When the MiGs broke the circle and tried to escape, both he and his wingmen {{destroyed}} one. With just two MiG credits in his {{first six months of}} his tour, Garrison's tally increased dramatically in the final three months of combat before the Korean armistice. In the spring of 1953, the size of the Fifth Air Force's F-86 force doubled, increasing competitiveness among its pilots for victories over largely inexperienced communist pilots. Garrison achieved two kills in May.|$|E
2500|$|Some DAF units {{initially}} {{failed to}} use the P-40's strengths or used outdated defensive tactics such as the <b>Lufbery</b> <b>circle.</b> The superior climb rate of the Bf 109 enabled fast, swooping attacks, neutralizing the advantages offered by conventional defensive tactics. Various new formations were tried by Tomahawk units from 1941–42, including [...] "fluid pairs" [...] (similar to the German rotte); one or two [...] "weavers" [...] {{at the back of}} a squadron in formation and whole squadrons bobbing and weaving in loose formations. Werner Schröer, who was credited with destroying 114 Allied aircraft in only 197 combat missions, referred to the latter formation as [...] "bunches of grapes", because he found them so easy to pick off. The leading German expert in North Africa, Hans-Joachim Marseille, claimed as many as 101 P-40s during his career.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Lufbery</b> <b>Circle,</b> or Lufbery Wheel, also spelled [...] "Lufberry" [...] or [...] "Luffberry", is a {{defensive}} air combat tactic first used during World War I.|$|E

5000|$|Lundstrom, in {{chronicling the}} {{operational}} history of US carrier-based {{activities in the}} Pacific from Pearl Harbor through the Battle of Midway, provides an extensive discussion of fighter tactics of the time.

5000|$|The <b>Lufbery</b> <b>Circle,</b> {{or follow}} the leader formation, {{a great help}} to each man’s tail. In other words you dive down on a trench, spray it with your guns, and zoom up without {{worrying}} much whether a load of nickel jacketed steel is going to crease the seat of your pants. And you don’t worry much because the pilot behind you is taking his turn at spraying the troops in the trench, {{with the result that}} they are too occupied with getting {{out of his way to}} turn around and blaze away at you as you zoom up. And in the case of the <b>Lufbery</b> <b>Circle,</b> it wouldn’t be healthy for a Hun to try and drop down on the tail of the ship in front of you because you would simply pull up your nose a bit and chew off the soles of his field boots with your bursts.|$|E

5000|$|Here he was {{involved}} in many air combats throughout the second half of 1942, claiming at least 14 air victories and sharing many others. He claimed his first kill on 4 June, a Curtiss P-40 over Bir Hakeim. He shot down another P-40 on 17 June, over Sidi Rezegh. On 10 July, Capitano Lucchini led eleven C.202s from 84a Squadriglia, 10° Gruppo, in a free hunt mission in El Alamein area, attacked a formation of 15 P-40s. The Curtiss P-40s formed a defensive <b>Lufbery</b> <b>circle.</b> The combat ended after 30 minutes when the Macchis had no more ammunition and Lucchini claimed a P-40. Three more were claimed by other Italian pilots.|$|E

5000|$|On 9 September KG 1 {{mounted the}} single largest raid on this date. It appears the target was Farnborough again. II./KG 1 {{committed}} 26 bombers to the attack supported by 20 Bf 110s from ZG 76 and 60 Bf 109s from JG 3. The German intruders headed on a westerly course, to avoid the main concentration of RAF bases at Biggin Hill, RAF Kenley, RAF Croydon and RAF Northolt. The approach failed and nine RAF squadrons engaged the German flights. The British made a head-on-attack with around 70 fighters. The Bf 110s adopted a <b>Lufbery</b> <b>circle</b> and one staffel of bombers jettisoned their bombs over Purley and Epsom, and turned back. The fleeing bombers joined up with 40 Junkers Ju 88s from KG 30, which was under attack from 253 and No. 303 Squadron RAF. [...] 30 lost five bombers. [...] 1 suffered only three He 111s damaged—two with around sixty percent damage and one with thirty-five. III./ZG 76 lost three fighters and one damaged and JG 3 lost another three protecting KG 1.|$|E
5000|$|... 264 Squadron {{developed}} a counter against single-seat aircraft {{such as the}} Bf 109. By flying in an ever-descending <b>Lufbery</b> <b>circle,</b> Defiant crews sacrificed the advantage of height but eliminated the possibility of attack from underneath, while giving 360° of defensive fire. This tactic was used by 264 Squadron, but when the Defiants of 141 Sqn were committed to combat {{a few months later}} during the Battle of Britain, it chose to ignore their advice. On 19 July, seven out of nine 141 Squadron Defiants sent to cover a convoy off Folkestone were shot down by Bf 109s of JG 51, and the remaining two survived, one badly damaged, thanks only to the intervention of Hurricanes of 111 Sqn. The Hurricane pilots reported that the Defiants had shot down four Bf 109s. Although 264 Squadron claimed 48 kills in eight days over Dunkirk, the cost was high with 14 Defiants lost. Actual German losses were no more than 12-15 enemy aircraft; the turrets wide angle of fire meant that several Defiants could engage the same target at one time, leading to multiple claims.|$|E
5000|$|Ward {{was sent}} with his unit to Egypt {{and participated in}} the North African Campaign. Around midday on 17 June 1942, Ward's {{squadron}} was returning to base, very low on fuel, when they were attacked by Messerschmitt Bf 109s from Jagdgeschwader 27. Two Hawker Hurricanes were shot down and their pilots bailed out. Most of the Squadron had not noticed this and landed, but according to Allied reports, Ward returned to protect the pilots in their parachutes only to be shot down and killed. According to the German report of the action: Around midday four Bf 109s ran into ten Hurricanes and approximately 20 Curtiss planes in the air between Gambut and Ras Azeiz. Oberleutnant Marseille {{was the first to}} dive into a thick crowd of enemy fighters and shot one of them down on his first pass. As he was breaking to shake an enemy off his tail, another plane flitted across his gunsight. Marseille fired immediately and this opponent, too, fell burning. He then sighted four fighters flying in a defensive circle protecting their fellow pilots in the chute harness. Marseille shot down two more out of the <b>Lufbery</b> <b>circle.</b>|$|E
