5|$|The next morning, Ashley {{plays on}} the beach and builds sand castles. When Ashley's drunken mother phones, {{demanding}} to know where her son is, Uncle David feigns ignorance, telling her that he himself is not in Sheppey but in Manchester. Taking Ashley to an abandoned military bunker, he injects an unknown substance into his nephew's vein as they kiss. Ashley enters an altered state of consciousness, and David guides him back to the caravan as they smoke marijuana. Once there, David gives Ashley a second injection, as they sit and <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the shore. After dark, David places his near-catatonic nephew in a dog bed, showing him a copy of a picture book titled Is Britain Great?. He proceeds to give him a third and final injection, which he remarks will make Ashley lose consciousness and suffer organ failure. As Ashley dies, David professes that he has never loved anyone else as much before. The next morning, he goes onto the beach to place his nephew's body in a shallow grave, tearfully kissing the body goodbye before it is swept away by the sea.|$|E

25|$|Pope John Paul II Park Reservation: The Pope John Park Reservation is {{approximately}} 66 acres in size, {{and is also}} open year-round for the residents of Dorchester. In its earlier times it {{was used as a}} landfill and also a drive-in theatre. It also serves as a barricade between the Town of Dorchester, Boston and Neponset River waterfront. This park now gives residents various resources such as; Picnic facilities, soccer fields, play areas, paths for walking, and also spacious land to plant trees and shrubs. Unfortunately, it was not always like this. In May 2015, According to James W. Dolan, Pope John Paul Park Reservation was not the same as it used to be. The State Department of Conservation and Recreation, which is responsible for the park, is not really doing its job. The plants are either dead or overgrown. There are no gardens or trees that would catch anyone's eye and also no picnic tables or grills where families could gather around and do a cookout. Dolan states that he wants to see people of the community planting vegetables and tending flower beds in the park, paddling canoes in the river, and also a grove of trees so people could sit in the shade and <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the river.|$|E

It doesn't mean it's less wondrous and it doesn't mean that there can't be some power greater than any of us that has been behind and is behind whatever is going on." ...|$|E
