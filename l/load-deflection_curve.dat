40|$|The <b>load-deflection</b> <b>curve</b> {{simulating}} {{the response}} of pile foundation under horizontal loading is indispensable {{for the design of}} piles to resist lateral loads. A static horizontal pile load test or even an adequate p-y analysis is capable to provide load-deflection curves for a single pile, which significantly differ from those of a pile group, depending on the particular layout and the level of loading. In this paper the results of a horizontal pile load test was initially used to adjust the soil parameters through a back-analysis. A parametric analysis was then carried out to numerically establish the <b>load-deflection</b> <b>curve</b> for various pile group arrangements. The reduction factors were quantitatively estimated and are given in normalised charts, while a relationship is proposed, giving the ability of establishing the <b>load-deflection</b> <b>curve</b> of any pile group layout in soft clayey soils, assuming that the <b>load-deflection</b> <b>curve</b> of the single pile is known...|$|E
40|$|The {{cushion spring}} plays an {{important}} role in an automotive dry-clutch system. It strongly influences the clutch torque transmission from the engine to the driveline through its non-linear <b>load–deflection</b> <b>curve.</b> Therefore, knowledge of the cushion spring compression behaviour is crucial to improve the gearshift performance in an automated manual transmission. Furthermore, the cushion spring compression behaviour is influenced by the temperature because of the frictional heat generation of the clutch facings with the flywheel and the pressure plate surfaces during the engagement phase. In this paper an analysis of the <b>load–deflection</b> <b>curve,</b> taking into account the thermal load to which it is subjected, of a typical passenger car cushion spring is proposed.

40|$|In {{addition}} to the initial crook to a column, the structural integrity is often not as reliable as expected due to the immaturity of current engineering techniques. Thus, the actual load response is sometimes {{not consistent with the}} design predictions for the column. For design considerations, it is necessary to establish experimentally an analytical method for determining the <b>load-deflection</b> <b>curves</b> and buckling load. In this paper, a dynamic method is described for building the <b>load-deflection</b> <b>curves</b> up to its buckling load for an imperfect column. The proposed method does not require the application of axial load and is feasible for arbitrary types of boundary conditions. The <b>load-deflection</b> <b>curves</b> and buckling load are determined from the measured natural frequencies and the vibration modes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

As shown in this figure, the behavior and characteristics of the two beams are nearly identical, as the backbone of <b>load–deflection</b> <b>curve</b> of specimen S 1  M appears as the envelope curve for the <b>load–deflection</b> <b>curve</b> of specimen S 1 C.

The increase in load capacity of S 1 C, compared with that of the beam CC, was 15 %. The failure mode of beam S 1 C was the interfacial debonding of CFRP laminates, followed by complete debonding of top and bottom CFRP laminates. For the cyclic strengthened specimen (S 1 C), the debonding of top and bottom laminates occurred in upward and downward 4 th cycles of load, respectively. The debonding of top laminate initiated from the location of close to the left load position, and propagated towards the left end of the beam and the mid-span, while that of the bottom laminate initiated at the mid-span, and propagated towards both ends of beam.|$|E

The model proposed is able to calculate also the flexural response of fibrous reinforced concrete (FRC) beam-to-column sub-assemblages in term of a multilinear <b>load-deflection</b> <b>curves.</b> The model is able to take into account of the tensile behavior of main bars embedded in the surrounding concrete and of the softening of the compressed strut, the arrangement and percentage of the steel bars, the percentage and the geometry of steel fibers.

40|$|Static {{tests were}} carried out on {{moderately}} anisotropic, simply supported circular plates made of graphite fibre reinforced plastic laminates of various thicknesses, loading them at the centre by a hemispherical tup. A non-linear solution available for large deflections of isotropic plates was suitably modified {{to account for the}} Hertzian contact phenomena, and adopted to model the plate behaviour in the elastic field. From the experimental results, an unacceptable error is made in predicting the force-deflection curve up to first failure, if the non-linear portion of the deflection is neglected. This error is the more evident when thin laminates are concerned. For thick laminates, the Hertzian contact plays a significant role in affecting the plate behaviour. Taking into account both the local deformation and non-linearity due to large deflections, a very accurate prediction of the <b>load-deflection</b> <b>curve</b> was obtained. Only {{in the case of the}} thinnest composites tested, a divergence of the theoretical curve from the experimental data was observed at sufficiently high loads.

In {{order to}} {{determine}} the impact resistance of lightweight aggregate concrete (LWC), especially the effect of steel fibers on impact resistance of LWC, a series of drop-weight tests, recommended by the ACI committee 544, have been carried out in the present study. Impact and flexural tests were carried out on lightweight aggregate concrete reinforced with five different percentages of steel fibers 0. 0 %, 0. 5 %, 1. 0 %, 1. 5 % and 2. 0 % by volume of concrete.
