The inner diameter of bi-metal <b>lining</b> <b>pipe</b> decreases 1 mm∼ 8 mm as compared to carbon steel pipe.

40|$|The {{present study}} is {{motivated}} {{by the use of}} lined pipes in energy pipeline applications (oil, gas, etc.) where a corrosion-resistant thin-walled liner is fitted inside a carbon-steel outer pipe. The paper focuses on wrinkling of lined pipes (sometimes referred to as clad pipes), which are candidates for offshore pipeline applications. The pipe is composed by two pipes that are in contact; a thick-walled carbon-steel "outer pipe", and a thin-walled corrosion-resistant inner pipe, referred to as "liner pipe" fitted inside the carbon steel outer pipe. The lateral confinement of the liner pipe due to the deformable outer pipe and its interaction with the outer pipe has a decisive influence on the wrinkling behaviour of the <b>lined</b> <b>pipe.</b> The problem is solved numerically, using nonlinear finite elements to simulate the <b>lined</b> <b>pipe</b> and its interaction with the outer pipe. Nonlinear geometry with large strains is taken into account, and the material of both pipes is elastic-plastic. Stresses and strains are monitored throughout the deformation stage with emphasis on possible detachment of the liner from the outer pipe and the formation of wrinkles. It is shown that the behaviour is characterized by a first bifurcation in a uniform wrinkling pattern, followed by a secondary bifurcation.

40|$|AbstractLining {{internally}} {{a carbon}} steel pipe {{with a thin}} layer of corrosion resistant material is an economical method for protecting offshore tubulars from the corrosive ingredients of hydrocarbons. In applications involving severe plastic bending, such as in the reeling installation process, the liner can detach from the outer pipe and develop large amplitude buckles that compromise the flow. This paper outlines a numerical framework for establishing the extent to which <b>lined</b> <b>pipe</b> can be bent before liner collapse. The modeling starts with the simulation of the inflation process through which the two tubes develop interference contact pressure. Bending the composite structure leads to differential ovalization and eventually separation of part of the liner from the outer pipe. The unsupported strip of the liner on the compressed side first wrinkles and at higher curvature buckles and collapses in a diamond shaped mode. The sensitivity of the collapse curvature to the various parameters of the problem is studied, and amongst other findings the onset of collapse is shown to be very sensitive to small geometric imperfections in the liner. It is also demonstrated that bending the pipe under modest amounts of internal pressure can delay liner collapse to curvatures that make it reelable...|$|E

The hypothesis tested in this project is that water in bioswells improves water quality. Water quality in both a bioswell and an underground concrete lined ditch, both containing ground and surface water, were tested for certain water quality parameters. These parameters consisted of: Dissolved Oxygen, pH, water temperature, weather temperature, Total Dissolved Solids, Specific Conductivity, Alkalinity, Total Dissolved Carbon, Chemical Oxygen Demand, and depth and width of the sampling site. An additional contaminant that was looked at was motor oil. This was measured by comparing Total Organic Carbon with Chemical Oxygen Demand. A variety of different methods to measure the water quality parameters were utilized. The concrete site had more stable readings, but much higher water temperatures. However, the bioswell water is mainly from surface water runoff, and the underground concrete <b>lined</b> <b>pipe</b> is from underground water, so the two cannot be directly compared.

40|$|AbstractAn {{analytical}} bifurcation {{solution is}} presented for axisymmetric wrinkling on a <b>lined</b> <b>pipe</b> under axial compression without internal pressure. The internal liner consists of corrosion-resistant alloy (CRA), {{it is not}} metallurgically bonded to the carbon steel backing pipe, and it {{is assumed to be}} in a snug fit condition: i. e. there is no gap between the liner and the backing pipe, but also no prestress that would lead to a positive contact or gripping pressure between the liner and the backing. The backing is assumed to be much thicker than the liner, so that wrinkling-related deformations of the backing pipe can be neglected. The solution indicates that the incipient wrinkling strain for the snug-fit pipe without any imperfections {{is the same as the}} incipient wrinkling strain for a single pipe with (5 / 3) times the wall thickness of the liner, and the same midsurface diameter, as determined by the solution of Batterman (1965) for the case of small strains, or Peek (2000 a) for the case of finite strains. For the case when the liner-pipe friction is included the factor (5 / 3) increases slightly. A positive contact pressure due to prestress or internal pressure raises the wrinkling strain, whereas imperfections (e. g. at seam or girth welds) reduces it. The snug-fit solution accounts for neither, but nevertheless provides a useful reference wrinkling strain, and can be used to validate numerical solutions, and it gives a bifurcation modeshape and wrinkle length that can be used in numerical models to investigate post-bifurcation behaviour...|$|E
