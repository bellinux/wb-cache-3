50|$|<b>Lithiasis</b> (formation of stones) is {{a global}} human health problem. Stones can form in both urinary and {{gastrointestinal}} tracts. Related {{to the formation of}} stones is the formation of crystals; this can occur in joints (e.g. gout) and in the viscera.|$|E

50|$|Congenital {{disorders}} of the meatus, in the male, include epispadias - the misplacement to {{the upper}} aspect and hypospadias - the misplacement to {{the underside of the}} penis. A congenital mis-shaping can result in its narrowing (meatal stenosis) causing a partial or total urinary blockage, or the bifurcation of the urinary stream. A urethral blockage can also be caused by foreign material, kidney or bladder stones (<b>lithiasis).</b>|$|E
50|$|Biocrystallization is the {{formation}} of crystals from organic macromolecules by living organisms. This may be a stress response, {{a normal part of}} metabolism such as processes that dispose of waste compounds, or a pathology. Template mediated crystallization is qualitatively different from in vitro crystallization. Inhibitors of biocrystallization are of interest in drug design efforts against <b>lithiasis</b> and against pathogens that feed on blood, since many of these organisms use this process to safely dispose of heme.|$|E
5000|$|He was {{proficient}} in Arabic and English and learned French, German and Syriac for his archival research in history. He wrote almost a hundred articles on various medical topics including genera surgery and urology, and half in English and half in Arabic. Ten {{of his books}} were written in English, including Notes on Embryology (unpublished), Essentials of Urinary and Genital Disease (1946), and eight volumes of the Annual Report of the Orient Hospital (AROH) (1948-1955). The Contributions of the Arabs to the Medical Sciences (1936) and The Tradition According to Omar (1940) were written in Arabic. His articles on urology dealt with cystoscopy, pyolography, hematuria, genitourinary tuberculosis, renal and ureteral <b>lithiasis,</b> hemangioma of the urinary bladder, calculi, prostatic enlargement, and prostatic cancer.|$|E
50|$|This phase {{may develop}} {{months or years}} after initial infection. Adult flukes in the bile ducts cause {{inflammation}} and hyperplasia of the epithelium. The resulting cholangitis and cholecystitis, combined with the large body of the flukes, are sufficient to cause mechanical obstruction of the biliary duct. In this phase, biliary colic, epigastric pain, fatty food intolerance, nausea, jaundice, pruritus, right upper-quadrant abdominal tenderness, etc., are clinical manifestations indistinguishable from cholangitis, cholecystitis and cholelithiasis of other origins. Hepatic enlargement {{may be associated with}} an enlarged spleen or ascites. In case of obstruction, the gall bladder is usually enlarged and edematous with thickening of the wall (Ref: Hepatobiliary Fascioliasis:Sonographic and CT Findings in 87 Patients During the InitialPhase and Long-Term Follow-Up.

30|$|In the {{diagnosis}} of small renal <b>lithiasis,</b> integrating gray-scale with color Doppler {{may be the most}} suitable procedure, because the color-Doppler twinkling sign is able to confirm the doubtful diagnosis of renal <b>lithiasis</b> and to detect some <b>lithiasis</b> that are not visible on b-mode.|$|E

30|$|As already mentioned, CT negative, grey-scale {{positive}} <b>lithiasis</b> (regardless {{of diagnostic}} certainty) {{were excluded from}} our study. <b>Lithiasis</b> might be CT negative {{because of the presence}} of false positives on grey-scale and, quite seldom, because of sampling mistakes due to CT parameters that were not compatible with the dimensions of the small <b>lithiasis.</b> In our opinion, including this group of <b>lithiasis</b> would imply a loss of objectivity in our study, leading our team to make philosophical speculations on the existence or non-existence of what might appear on the images. For this reason, we decided to focus on clearly diagnosed <b>lithiasis,</b> using CT as selection technique.|$|E
30|$|In {{the case}} of small renal <b>lithiasis</b> (_ 5 mm), {{differential}} diagnosis between suspected renal <b>lithiasis</b> and hyperechoic foci caused by other factors (e.g. vascular and/or parenchymal calcifications, clots, arcuate arteries) is difficult [3, 4]. The identification of an additional sonographic feature of renal <b>lithiasis</b> is therefore important {{to reduce the number}} of false negatives and false positives as well as the number of examinations [5, 6]. The Doppler twinkling sign has often been associated with <b>lithiasis</b> [7 – 9].|$|E
30|$|Medical {{literature}} {{shows that}} the most valuable echographic parameters for renal <b>lithiasis,</b> i.e. the posterior shadow cone and the hyperechogenic foci with marked echogenicity difference from the surrounding tissue have a low sensitivity compared to the total cases of renal <b>lithiasis.</b> This factor explains why CT is so often required in the diagnosis of suspected renal <b>lithiasis.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: Although the {{association}} of urinary <b>lithiasis</b> and urinary tract malformation is not rare, their management poses challenges. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the relationship between urolithiasis and malformations of the urinary system. There were 34 patients (19 males and 15 females) with a mean age of 4. 8 years (range, 2 months to 14 years). All patients had urinary <b>lithiasis</b> with a urinary tract malformation. Abdominal pain was the most frequent clinical symptom (38 %). Urinary infection was found in 7 patients (21 %) and macroscopic haematuria was present in 10 patients (29 %). The most frequent urinary tract malformations were megaureter (8 cases), uretero-pelvic junction obstruction (7 cases) and vesico-ureteric reflux (8 cases), but its malformative origin could not be confirmed. Treatment consisted of <b>lithiasis</b> extraction in 32 cases associated with specific treatment of the uropathy in 27 cases. Postoperative outcome was uneventful in all cases. In fact, urinary <b>lithiasis</b> and urinary tract malformation association is not rare. Indeed, 9 - 34 % of urinary <b>lithiasis</b> are noted to be associated with urinary tract malformation. Positive diagnosis relies specifically on kidney ultrasound, intravenous urography, and urethrocystography. Treatment depends on the type of urinary tract malformation, localisation and size of the urinary <b>lithiasis.</b> Conclusion: In conclusion, urinary <b>lithiasis</b> and urinary tract malformation association is a frequent eventuality. Surgical intervention is the usual mode of treatment...|$|E

30|$|<b>Lithiasis</b> that, on grey-scale, {{provided}} the same diagnosis of CT (i.e., CT positive and absolutely positive on ultrasound (US), same side and location). <b>Lithiasis</b> showing posterior shadow cone and/or marked echogenicity difference (compared {{to the surrounding}} parenchyma) were classified as absolutely positive on US.|$|E
30|$|In conclusion, the {{twinkling}} sign {{showed the}} highest sensitivity {{in the case}} of certain or doubtful diagnosis of renal <b>lithiasis</b> on grey-scale.

30|$|This study {{demonstrates}} that the twinkling sign {{is often associated with}} the presence of small renal <b>lithiasis</b> (_ 5 mm) and its identification can increase ultrasonography capabilities almost to CT levels.
