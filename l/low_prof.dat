40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} the paper is twofold: to {{determine}} firm characteristics that explain mergers in the banking industry and to predict {{the likelihood of a}} merger. Design/methodology/approach – A logit model is used to estimate coefficients. The paper also tests the effect of the Financial Services Modernization Act on market structure and uses a national sample from 1997 to 2003. Findings – Results indicate that profitability (PROF), size (SIZE), asset management (ASSETMGT), and solvency (SOLV) are factors in explaining mergers in the full sample model. Poor ASSETMGT, large target banks, <b>low</b> <b>PROF,</b> and solvent banks represent merged firms in the full sample model. The results also indicate that loan activity is not a factor in explaining mergers. It appears that banks merged before the Financial Services Modernization Act (Pre- 1999 Merger Model) are characterized by poor ASSETMGT, and are solvent. In contrast, the only factor explaining mergers after the Financial Services Modernization Act (Post- 1999 Merger Model) was PROF. Originality/value – The paper shows that the results for the full sample model and the sub-sample models are the same except for PROF. This suggests that acquiring banks seek to provide better management, technology, and access to better markets than the smaller merged banks. Acquisitions and mergers, Banks, Financial services, Financial Services Act...|$|E

I would like to express my utmost gratitude to them, for their enormous guidance and help. Their patience and encouragement accompanied me to hurdle all the obstacles {{during the past two}} years. I really learned a lot from both of them. I am also grateful to my collaborators, Lachlan Andrew and Minghong Lin. They have always provided insightful discussions and constructive suggestions. The atmosphere and environment of the RSRG, Computer Science department and Caltech are amazing and helpful. It is really a pleasure to work and study here. Last but not least, my family provided me a pleasant environment, which helped a lot during this research. I would like to thank my wife Zheng especially for her understanding and love all the time. This thesis {{would not have been possible}} without their support! iv Energy expenditure has become a significant fraction of data center operating costs. Recently, “geographical load balancing ” has been suggested to reduce energy cost by exploiting the electricity price differences across regions.

40|$|In {{the current}} context of {{television}} audience fragmentation, reducing costs {{and looking for}} simple but high audience, it has bloomed a series of formats that interpret direct as a simple action of probe on the daily to show the real. The format of the program Callejeros (S panish TV channel Cuatro) is an example. In this kind of programs the enunciative strategy is the pure viewing, the approach is nihilist, the discourse does not reflect or constructs a verifiable reality. The aim is the shock, the collision, not with the reality in fact, but with his arbitrary possibility. What is presented as the real is abruptly showed, without significant suture, or with an aberrant significance. The pre-production does not contemplate documentation, the speciality of the different assignments in the audio-visual production line is lost, and any possibility of critical action becomes annulled, so in production, so in the reception {{of this kind of}} television product. The ENG journalist becomes a <b>low</b> human resources <b>prof</b> essional. That’s the new production strategy based on the " succedane ous direct " format...|$|R
40|$|I {{will begin}} with {{a brief review of}} some basic aspects of Basque clause {{structure}} (1). In main clauses, the verbal complex contains obligatory marking of pronominal categories in ergative, absolutive, and dative cases. Ergative is the case of transitive subjects (TS's), absolutive that of transitive objects and intransitive subjects (TO's, IS's), and dative that of indirect objects. In modern Basque. these pronominal markers are ordinarily added to a special auxiliary verb, while the main verb has only an aspect suffix (periphrastic conju-gation); only a few verbs can optionally add the pronominal markers directly (synthetic conjugation). The predominant periphrastic type can be illustrated by this example (Guipuzcoan dialect) : (1) txakurr- a il- tzen det dog the kill asp 1 s- 3 s The notation « 1 s- 3 s » indicates first singular ergative plus third singular absolutive, so the translation is «I am killing the dog». The overt TO txakurr-a has no case suffix, since ahsolutive is the un-marked case. If the independent first singular pronoun were added, (1) It is a pleasure to thank Prof. Michelenaanc Prof. De Rijk for their helpfulness to me, and the Nevada Basque Studies Program staff in general. I also wish to thank Prof. Haritschelhar of Bordeaux for answering my questions on his <b>Low</b> Navarrese dialect. <b>Prof.</b> De Rijk also suggested several factual and stylistic changes which have been incorporated-into {{the final version of the}} paper...|$|R
