25|$|Judged {{a charismatic}} and {{experienced}} leader, Nouri {{was considered the}} greatest threat faced by Déby since the rebellion of another former Minister of Defense, Youssouf Togoïmi. Another reason of danger represented by Nouri for Déby was {{that he may have}} been seen by western powers such as the United States and France as an acceptable alternative to the current president. Such scenarios were elaborated by the Chadian newspaper <b>Le</b> <b>Temps,</b> which, remembering Nouri's past links with Sudan and Egypt while a man of Habré, speculates about a French and American plan to overthrow Déby with Egyptian and Sudanese support. Part of the alleged plan would be his taking the overall command of the Chadian armed opposition from the contested Mohammed Nour.|$|E
25|$|Since then, the {{government}} has expropriated other valuable land, mostly the homes of poor and middle-class Equatoguineans. Thousands {{of people have been}} the victims of these seizures, for which very few of them are compensated and in response to which they have no legal recourse. Many of those who have protested these expropriations have been abused and intimidated by soldiers or police. Officially, these lands are seized for public purposes, but in fact they have ended {{up in the hands of}} members of the Nguema/Mongomo group, who have built homes or businesses on the properties. In 2003, for example, <b>Le</b> <b>Temps</b> (Geneva) reported on a village in which 75 people lived in abject poverty having been uprooted by the regime from their homes, which had been used to construct a methanol factory without compensation or apology. A 2013 Amnesty report stated that over 1,000 families in the country had been forcibly removed from their homes so that {{the government}} could build roads, luxury homes and hotels, and shopping centers. Many of the homes demolished were in perfect shape, with the vast majority of those living there holding land titles. Despite promises from the government to relocate victims to new homes, to date no one has been compensated in any way.|$|E
25|$|The {{winter of}} 194445 was {{especially}} difficult {{for most of}} the population. Inflation showed no sign of slowing down and food shortages were severe. The prime minister and the other Gaullists were forced to try to balance the desires of ordinary people and public servants for a return to normal life with pressure from Bidault's MRP and the Communists for the large scale nationalisation programme and other social changes that formed the main tenets of the CNR Charter. At the end of 1944 the coal industry and other energy companies were nationalised, followed shortly afterwards by major banks and finance houses, the merchant navy, the main aircraft manufacturers, airlines and a number of major private enterprises such as the Renault car company at Boulogne-Billancourt, whose owner had been implicated as a collaborator and accused of having made huge profits working for the Nazis. In some cases, unions, feeling that things were not progressing quickly enough, took matters into their own hands, occupying premises and setting up workers' committees to run the companies. Women were also allowed the vote for the first time, a new social security system was introduced to cover most medical costs, unions were expanded and price controls introduced to try to curb inflation. At de Gaulle's request, the newspaper Le Monde was founded in December 1944 to provide France with a quality daily journal similar to those in other countries. Le Monde took over the premises and facilities of the older <b>Le</b> <b>Temps,</b> whose independence and reputation had been badly compromised during the Vichy years.|$|E

500|$|Reviewing the {{painting}} after the Salon, Tr.L. in the [...] praised Chabas's technique as drawing [...] "of a rare purity", and modeling [...] "of a remarkable delicacy".

500|$|The {{play was}} a {{pronounced}} box-office success; however, critical reception was mixed.

In <b>Le</b> <b>Temps,</b> Francisque Sarcey panned the play with a brief notice, claiming that all the other plays running that week were [...] "far more interesting and entertaining." [...] He noted the innovative Verne-d'Ennery idea of using the human characters of Volsius and Ox to represent good and evil in the fantasy, rather than resorting to the typical [...] "Good Fairy" [...] and [...] "Bad Fairy" [...] characters in such plays, but added that he [...] "didn't quite see what we've gained by the substitution." ...|$|E
500|$|Apart from {{a single}} early work for unaccompanied choir ("Chanson à boire", 1922), Poulenc began writing choral music in 1936. In that year he {{produced}} three works for choir: Sept chansons (settings of verses by Éluard and others), Petites voix (for children's voices), and his religious work Litanies à la Vierge Noire, for female or children's voices and organ. The Mass in G major (1937) for unaccompanied choir is described by Gouverné as having something of a baroque style, with [...] "vitality and joyful clamour on which his faith is writ large". Poulenc's new-found religious theme continued with Quatre motets pour un temps de pénitence (1938–39), but among his most important choral works is the secular cantata Figure humaine (1943). Like the Mass, it is unaccompanied, and to succeed in performance it requires singers of the highest quality. Other a cappella works include the Quatre motets pour <b>le</b> <b>temps</b> de Noël (1952), which make severe demands on choirs' rhythmic precision and intonation.|$|E
