40|$|Membrane {{currents}} {{were recorded}} {{from the wild}} type and two pawn mutants of the ptoA complementation group in Paramecitan tetraurelia under a voltage clamp. Most currents are not changed by the mutations. Transient inward currents of a <b>leaky</b> <b>mutant,</b> proA-^, upon step depolari-zations are less {{than those in the}} wild type. The inward transient is com-pletely lacking in a non-leaky mutant, pwA^^. The time course of the residual inward currents in the <b>leaky</b> <b>mutant</b> is not significantly different from that of wild type. The voltage sensitivity of the Ca channels in the <b>leaky</b> <b>mutant</b> is also similar to that of wild type. The inward currents upon mem-brane hyperpolarizations in the mutants show normal characteristics in {{the presence or absence of}} external K+. With sufficiently large, prolonged depolarization, outward currents progressively develop in the wild type but decay in the mutants. The simplest conclusion we can draw is that the pwA mutations reduce the number of functional Ca channels but do not change the channel characteris-tics. From the conductance measurements, 45 % of the Ca channels remain in the <b>leaky</b> <b>mutant</b> pwA 19 i, and none remain in the non-leaky mutant ptvA^. By subtracting the outward currents of pwAy ^ from the slow and pro-longed outward currents of the wild type, we have tentatively separated a Ca-induced K+ current from the voltage-dependent K+ current. The time courses of these two currents differ by two orders of magnitude...|$|E

40|$|Functional {{expression}} of the multidrug resistance protein P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in Escherichia coli is providing an appropriate system for structure/function studies and might provide an invaluable tool to screen potential P-gp substrates and inhibitors. The major problem encountered in such studies, however, is the impermeability of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, which protects microorganisms against the cytotoxic effects of many lipophilic cancer drugs and blocks accessibility of P-gp reversal agents. In the present study we have constructed, by mutagenesis, a "leaky" (containing a permeable outer membrane) strain of E. coli, which is significantly more susceptible to the toxic effect of known P-gp substrates and cytotoxic agents. Expression of mouse Mdr 1 in the mutant confers cross-resistance to daunomycin, quinidine, chloroquine, rhodamine 6 G, and puromycin. Most importantly, reserpine and doxorubicin completely abolish Mdr 1 -mediated rhodamine resistance. The results provide strong support for previous observations, suggesting that Mdr 1 can be expressed functionally in E. coli and indicate that the <b>leaky</b> <b>mutant</b> will be useful for further structure/function studies of the heterologously expressed eukaryotic drug efflux protein...|$|E

The cultures fell into three nutritional groups: group A, absolute purine requirement satisfied by adenine or hypoxanthine; group B, stimulatory purine requirement (leaky) satisfied by adenine or hypoxanthine; group C, absolute purine requirement satisfied only by adenine. Although adenosine, adenylic acid (AMP), inosine, and inosinic acid (IMP) {{could not be used}} by the absolute <b>mutants,</b> the <b>leaky</b> <b>mutants</b> were stimulated by these compounds. The rapid growth on adenine observed with members of all three nutritional groups was delayed by guanine. No inhibition was observed with guanosine or guanylic acid (GMP). Guanine and its derivatives did not inhibit growth of wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The slow growth of the <b>leaky</b> <b>mutants</b> in unsupplemented medium was inhibited by guanine, guanosine, and GMP. The results were interpreted as follows. (i) Yeasts lack GMP-reductase. (ii) Group A and B yeasts are blocked before IMP; group C yeasts lack one of the enzymes leading from IMP to AMP. (iii) The absolute mutants cannot take ribonucleotides or ribonucleosides into the cell and cannot break down these compounds extracellularly to the free base; the <b>leaky</b> <b>mutants</b> can slowly use extracellular nucleosides and nucleotides. (iv) Guanine competes with adenine for entry into the cell. (v) Guanine inhibits de novo synthesis of AMP.

40|$|The most {{prominent}} {{systems for the}} study of adaptive mutability depend on the specialized activities of genetic elements like bacteriophage Mu and the F plasmid. Searching for general adaptive mutability, we have investigated the behavior of Salmonella typhimurium strains with chromosomal lacZ mutations. We have studied 30 revertible nonsense, missense, frameshift, and insertion alleles. One-third of the mutants produced >= 10 late revertant colonies (appearing three to seven days after plating on selective medium). For the prolific mutants, the number of late revertants showed rank correlation with the residual β-galactosidase activity; for the same mutants, revertant number showed no correlation with the nonselective reversion rate (from fluctuation tests). <b>Leaky</b> <b>mutants,</b> which grew slowly on selective medium, produced late revertants whereas tight nongrowing mutants generally did not produce late revertants. However, the number of late revertants was not proportional to residual growth. Using total residual growth and the nonselective reversion rate, the expected number of late revertants was calculated. For several <b>leaky</b> <b>mutants,</b> the observed revertant number exceeded the expected number. We suggest that excess late revertants from these mutants arise from general adaptive mutability available to any chromosomal gene...|$|R
40|$|How {{misfolded}} proteins are exported {{from the}} ER to the cytosol for degradation (ER-associated Degradation, ERAD) and which proteins {{are participating in}} this process is not understood. Several studies using a single, <b>leaky</b> <b>mutant</b> indicated that Sec 63 p might be involved in ERAD. More recently, Sec 63 p was also found strongly associated with proteasomes attached to the protein-conducting channel in the ER membrane which presumably form part of the export machinery. These observations prompted us to reinvestigate the role of Sec 63 p in ERAD by generating new mutants which were selected in a screen monitoring the intracellular accumulation of the ERAD substrate CPY*. We show that a mutation in the DnaJ-domain of Sec 63 p causes a defect in ERAD, whereas mutations in the Brl, acidic, and transmembrane domains only affect protein import into the ER. Unexpectedly, mutations in the acidic domain which mediates interaction of Sec 63 p with Sec 62 p also caused defects in cotranslational import.

Three rf 1 -m alleles were derived from the progenitor allele Rf 1 -IA 153 and one was derived from Rf 1 -Ky 21.

40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{studies of}} gene {{amplification}} in Escherichia coli {{have suggested that}} it occurs in two steps: duplication and expansion. Expansion is thought to result from homologous recombination between the repeated segments created by duplication. To explore the mechanism of expansion, a 7 kbp duplication in the chromosome containing a <b>leaky</b> <b>mutant</b> version of the lac operon was constructed, and its expansion into an amplified array was studied. Results Under selection for lac function, colonies bearing multiple copies of the mutant lac operon appeared at a constant rate of approximately 4 to 5 per million cells plated per day, on days two through seven after plating. Expansion was not seen in a recA strain; null mutations in recBCD and ruvC reduced the rate 100 - and 10 -fold, respectively; a ruvC recG double mutant reduced the rate 1000 -fold. Expansion occurred at an increased rate in cells lacking dam, polA, rnhA, or uvrD functions. Null mutations of various other cellular recombination, repair, and stress response genes had little effect upon expansion. The red recombination genes of phage lambda could substitute for recBCD in mediating expansion. In the red -substituted cells, expansion was only partially dependent upon recA function. Conclusion These observations {{are consistent with the}} idea that the expansion step of gene amplification is closely related, mechanistically, to interchromosomal homologous recombination events. They additionally provide support for recently described models of RecA-independent Red-mediated recombination at replication forks. </p...|$|E

40|$|In {{the genetic}} system of Cairns and Foster, a nongrowing {{population}} of an E. coli lac frameshift mutant appears to specifically accumulate Lac(+) revertants when starved on medium including lactose (adaptive mutation). This behavior has {{been attributed to}} stress-induced general mutagenesis in a subpopulation of starved cells (the hypermutable state model). We have suggested that, on the contrary, stress has no direct effect on mutability but favors only growth of cells that amplify their <b>leaky</b> <b>mutant</b> lac region (the amplification mutagenesis model). Selection enhances reversion primarily by increasing the mutant lac copy number within each developing clone on the selection plate. The observed general mutagenesis is attributed to a side effect of growth with an amplification-induction of SOS by DNA fragments released from a tandem array of lac copies. Here we show that the S. enterica version of the Cairns system shows SOS-dependent general mutagenesis and behaves in every way like the original E. coli system. In both systems, lac revertants are mutagenized during selection. Eliminating the 35 -fold increase in mutation rate reduces revertant number only 2 - to 4 -fold. This discrepancy is due to continued growth of amplification cells until some clones manage to revert without mutagenesis solely by increasing their lac copy number. Reversion in the absence of mutagenesis is still dependent on RecA function, as expected if it depends on lac amplification (a recombination-dependent process). These observations support the amplification mutagenesis model...|$|E
40|$|The {{procedure}} for {{the selection of}} a temperature-sensitive recombination mutant in Drosophila is described. Use of this procedure has led to the recovery of three alleles at a new recombination locus called rec- 1, located within the region of chromosome 3 circumscribed by Deficiency (3 R) sbd 105. One allele, rec- 126, is temperature sensitive, and the other two alleles, rec- 16 and rec- 116, are temperature insensitive. Gene dosage studies reveal rec- 126 to be a <b>leaky</b> <b>mutant</b> with greater recombination activity in two doses than in one. The other two alleles show no dose response, implying that they may be null mutants. The temperature response curves of rec- 126 as a homozygote and in heteroallelic combination with rec- 116 suggest that the sharp decrease in recombination between 28 ° and 31 ° indicates temperature denaturation of an enzyme or other protein specified by the mutant and associated with the recombination process. The ability of small changes in temperature to reverse or abolish polarity in recombination along the X chromosome arm in rec- 1 26 /rec- 116 females brings into question the use of the "polarity" criterion to partition mutants into two functional types, i. e., precondition mutants that display polarity and exchange mutants that do not.

40|$|To study {{polyhydroxyalkanoate}} (PHA) accumulation and PHA {{regulation in}} Bacillus megaterium, transposon mutagenesis with Tn 917 -LTV 1 {{was carried out}} and seventy two mutants that produce more or less PHA than normal were isolated and partially characterized. The chromosomal regions of B. megaterium flanking the Tn 917 -LTV 1 insertions were cloned and sequenced from two PHA over-producing and six leaky mutants. The results showed that Tn 917 -LTV 1 was less than ideal for generating a mutant bank due to the unavoidable occurrence of sibling transposants. Furthermore, the sequence data revealed that chromosomal deletions mediated by Tn 917 -LTV 1 insertions were common. An alternative method was developed using a direct plating procedure and it was shown to circumvent these two problems. ^ One PHA <b>leaky</b> <b>mutant</b> and one overproducing mutant were studied in more detail. The PHA <b>leaky</b> <b>mutant,</b> T 4, had significantly reduced levels of PHA accumulation in all media tested and could not form spores. Chromosomal DNA, contiguous with the transposon was cloned and sequenced. Analysis of the sequence data showed Tn 917 -LTV 1 inserted 24 -bp upstream of an operon encoding a putative RNA helicase (deaD) gene and a nuclease (nucP) gene. A chromosomal target repeat 5 '-TATTT- 3 ' was found {{on both sides of}} the insertion which indicated that no deletion was involved in the Tn 917 -LTV 1 transposition. A plasmid carrying the intact RNA helicase operon was constructed and transformed into mutant T 4. The transformant recovered the ability to form spores and accumulate wild-type levels of PHA in minimal media. Deletions in either DeaD or NucP did not complement the T 4 mutant to the phenotype of VT 1660. The results show that both DeaD and NucP are involved in PHA accumulation and are required for spore formation. The DeaD protein of B. megaterium is the first protein in the DEAD-box helicase family that is not essential for the organism. The fact that the growth rate of mutant T 4 and VT 1660 were similar in both LB and minimal media indicates that this DeaD protein may target specific mRNA, such as those of pha and spo genes. ^ B 001 S, a PHA over-producing mutant, unlike its parental strain VT 1660, produced large quantities of PHA in rich media. The chromosomal DNA flanking the transposon was cloned from both sides of the insertion. The 8. 4 kilobase pairs of chromosomal sequence from left end (IR-L side) of Tn 917 -LTV 1 coded for sixteen open reading frames (ORFs). Ten putative products of the sixteen ORFs shared sequence homology with known gas vesicle proteins (Gvp). The 8. 4 -kb fragment and its deletion derivatives were cloned into pBluescriptIISK and the plasmids were transformed into E. coli. Gas vesicles were formed and observed by phase contrast microscope, differential interference contrast microscopy and electron microscopy. The deletion analysis and sequence comparison with known gas vesicle proteins suggested 14 out of the 16 ORFs formed the gvp operon of B. megaterium VT 1660. The deletion analysis showed that 11 genes are the maximum required for the gas vesicle formation in E. coli. The E. coli cells containing gas vesicles showed increased buoyancy.

We {{refer to the}} process that coordinately affects these traits as phenotype conversion (PC) and the resulting mutants as PC types. Previous research with the wild-type strain AW 1 suggested that inactivation of a single locus could mimic phenotype conversion (T. P. Denny, F. W. Makini, and S. M. Brumbley, Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1 : 215 - 223, 1988). Additional Tn 5 mutagenesis of AW 1 generated three more mutants (AW 1 - 81, AW 1 - 82, and AW 1 - 84) that were indistinguishable from the PC type and one slightly <b>leaky</b> <b>mutant</b> (AW 1 - 87); all four had single insertions in the same 4. 0 -kilobase (kb) EcoRI fragment that {{were responsible for the}} PC-like phenotype. Another insertion mutant, AW 1 - 83, which lacks an insertion in this 4. 0 -kb fragment, resembled the PC type except that it was reversibly induced to produce wild-type levels of EPS when cultured adjacent to AW 1. The wild-type region containing the gene that controls traits affected by phenotype conversion in AW 1, designated phcA, was cloned on a 2. 2 -kb DNA fragment that restored all the phcA::Tn 5 mutants and 11 independent spontaneous PC-type derivatives of AW 1 to wild-type status. Homology with the phcA region was found in diverse wild-type strains of P. solanacearum, although restriction fragment length polymorphisms were seen. No major DNA alterations were observed in the phcA homologous region of PC types from strain AW 1 or 82 N. PC types from 7 of 11 conjugal strains of P. solanacearum were restored to EPS+ by phcA from AW 1; however, only some PC types of strain K 60 were restored, whereas others were not. We believe that a functional phcA gene is required to maintain the wild-type phenotype in P. solanacearum, and for most strains phenotype conversion results from a loss of phcA gene expression or the function of its gene product...|$|E

Some transductants (0. 5 to 5 % as many as from S recipients) were obtained from most semirough recipients, either of class D (presumed <b>leaky</b> rouA <b>mutants)</b> or of a class due to mutation near his (presumed <b>leaky</b> rouB <b>mutants),</b> and from recipients lacking uridine diphosphogalactose epimerase or phosphomannose isomerase. Transductants were not obtained from several rouA, rouB, “heptose-negative,” and glucose- 1 -transferase mutants, nor from most semirough class C mutants, whose LPS side chains each bear a single O oligosaccharide unit. Most transductants evoked from non-S recipients by temperate (c+) phage P 22 were nonlysogenic, and virulent P 22. c 2 phage was about as effective as P 22. c+ in transduction to non-S recipients; probably all P 22 transducing particles neither lysogenize nor kill. The extended-host-range mutant P 22 h gave qualitatively similar results,but evoked 5 - to 30 -fold more transductants from some non-S recipients than did P 22. Probably, the LPS of non-S mutants susceptible to transduction contains a few O-specific oligosaccharide units, conferring a slight ability to adsorb P 22 and a greater ability to adsorb P 22 h...|$|R
40|$|R 9 was {{isolated}} {{as one of}} several mutations that enhanced {{the growth of a}} <b>leaky</b> amber (am) <b>mutant</b> of bacteriophage T 4 gene 62 (product required for phage DNA synthesis) under conditions of partial suppression by ribosomal ambiguity. R 9 also enhanced the growth of <b>leaky</b> am <b>mutants</b> of some, but not all, other T 4 “early” gene functions. R 9 mapped between mutations in genes 43 and 62. By using assays involving polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, we observed the following. (i) R 9 resulted in an overproduction of many T 4 “early” proteins in infected cells. The most pronounced effects of R 9 were observed when phage DNA synthesis and/or the functions of maturation genes 55 and 33 were not expressed. (ii) In rifampintreated infected cells, the capacity to synthesize T 4 “early” proteins decayed more slowly {{in the presence of the}} R 9 mutation than in the presence of the wild-type counterpart of R 9. R 9 appeared to have no effect on the rates of RNA synthesis either during early or late times after infection. The results suggest that the R 9 mutation leads to increased functional stability of T 4 “early” messengers...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} 13 mutagen-sensitive (mus) mutants (representing seven loci) on mitotic {{chromosome}} stability in nonmutagenized cells {{have been examined}} genetically. To do this, mus-bearing flies heterozygous for the recessive somatic-cell marker, multiple wing hairs (mwh), were examined for increased frequencies of mwh clones in the wing blade. Mutants at the mus- 103, mus- 104 and mus- 106 loci do not affect the frequency of mwh clones, while mus- 101, mus- 102, mus- 105 and mus- 109 alleles cause increases {{in the frequency of}} mwh clones. These data show that the wild-type alleles of latter four loci specify functions that are required for chromosome stability in nonmutagenized cells. Analysis of the size distribution of mwh clones produced by these mutants suggests that most chromosome instability caused by these mutants is the consequence of chromosome breakage; in the presence of mus- 105 and mus- 109 alleles {{a small fraction of the}} mwh clones are produced by an event (mitotic recombination, mutation, nondisjunction) that produces euploid clones. To inquire whether any of the extant alleles of the mus- 101, mus- 102, mus- 105 and mus- 109 loci might be leaky alleles of loci that carry out essential mitotic functions, chromosome stability in females homozygous for alleles of these loci has been compared to that of females carrying one dose of a mutant over a deficiency for that mus locus. These comparisons show that the extant alleles at the mus- 101, mus- 109 and mus- 105 loci are all <b>leaky</b> <b>mutants.</b> It is suggested that all three of these loci may specify essential mitotic functions...|$|R
40|$|Secretins are gated outer-membrane {{channels}} {{with large}} internal pore sizes (6 - 10 nm). They are the outer membrane components of bacterial trans-envelope complexes that assemble/export filamentous bacteriophages {{as well as}} pili, complex protein toxins and virulence factors. 12 - 14 identical subunits form the radially symmetrical channels which share a common architecture - a 3 -tiered barrel with middle septum. Secretins are essential components of Gram-negative Type 2 / 3 secretion systems, spanning the outer membrane and interacting with the inner membrane components of transport machinery. Since secretins have such large pore diameters a simple channel would allow noxious compounds through the normally impermeable outer membrane. The presence of a gate structure allows for the controlled opening and closing of secretin channels, in response to specific cues regulating protein export. Here I have determined gate-structural elements of the Klebsiella oxytoca Type 2 Secretin, PulD. Random mutagenesis coupled with selection for open or 'leaky'-gate phenotypes created a library of mutations which were mapped by DNA sequence analysis. Analysis of <b>leaky</b> <b>mutants</b> revealed 12 distinct missense point mutations in pulD. Additionally, two deletion mutants were isolated, spanning 5 and 9 amino acids, both conferring a leaky gate phenotype. Comparison of these pulD mutations with those previously identified in another secretin gene encoding the Escherichia coli filamentous phage f 1 secretin pIV, reveals mutations in both are localised in two main clusters that correspond to regions within the secretin homology domain. Named GATE 1 and GATE 2, these clusters indicate functional gate regions in both secretins...|$|R
40|$|Mutants of the HIS 1 {{locus of}} the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are {{suitable}} reporters for spontaneous reversion events because most reversions are topical, that is, within the locus itself. Thirteen mutations of his 1 - 1 now {{have been identified}} with respect to base sequence. Revertants of three mutants and their spontaneous reversion rates are presented: (1) a chain termination mutation (his 1 - 208, née his 1 - 1) that does not revert by mutations of tRNA loci and reverts only by intracodonic suppression; (2) a missense mutation (his 1 - 798, née his 1 - 7) that can revert by intragenic suppression by base substitutions of any sort, including a back mutation {{as well as one}} three-base deletion; and (3) a - 1 frameshift mutation (his 1 - 434, née his 1 - 19) that only reverts topically by + 1 back mutation, + 1 intragenic suppression, or a - 2 deletion. Often the + 1 insertion is accompanied by base substitution events at one or both ends of a run of A's. Missense suppressors of his 1 - 798 are either feeders or nonfeeders, and at four different locations within the locus, a single base substitution encoding an amino acid alteration will suffice to turn the nonfeeder phenotype into a feeder phenotype. Late-appearing revertants of his 1 - 798 were found to be slowly growing <b>leaky</b> <b>mutants</b> rather than a manifestation of adaptive mutagenesis. Spontaneous revertants of his 1 - 208 and his 1 - 434 produced no late-arising colonies...|$|R
40|$|In vitro {{studies with}} {{purified}} glycerol kinase from Enterococcus faecalis have established that this enzyme is activated by phosphorylation of a histidyl residue in the protein, catalyzed by the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS), but the physiological {{significance of this}} observation is not known. In the present study, the regulation of glycerol uptake was examined in a wild-type strain of E. faecalis {{as well as in}} tight and <b>leaky</b> ptsI <b>mutants,</b> altered with respect to their levels of enzyme I of the PTS. Glycerol kinase was shown to be weakly repressible by lactose and strongly repressible by glucose in the wild-type strain. Greatly reduced levels of glycerol kinase activity were also observed in the ptsI mutants. Uptake of glycerol into intact wild-type and mutant cells paralleled the glycerol kinase activities in extracts. Glycerol uptake in the <b>leaky</b> ptsI <b>mutant</b> was hypersensitive to inhibition by low concentrations of 2 -deoxyglucose or glucose even though the rates and extent of 2 -deoxyglucose uptake were greatly reduced. These observations provide strong support for the involvement of reversible PTS-mediated phosphorylation of glycerol kinase in the regulation of glycerol uptake in response to {{the presence or absence of}} a sugar substrate of the PTS in the medium. Glucose and 2 -deoxyglucose were shown to elicit rapid efflux of cytoplasmic [14 C]lactate derived from [14 C]glycerol. This phenomenon was distinct from the inhibition of glycerol uptake and was due to phosphorylation of the incoming sugar by cytoplasmic phosphoenolpyruvate. Lactate appeared to be generated by sequential dephosphorylation and reduction of cytoplasmic phosphoenolpyruvate present in high concentrations in resting cells.

40|$|Roles {{played by}} {{homocysteine}} and choline {{in the regulation}} of MS (methionine synthase) have been examined in fungi. The Aspergillus nidulans metH gene encoding MS was cloned and characterized. Its transcription was not regulated by methionine, but was enhanced by homocysteine and repressed by choline and betaine. MS activity levels were regulated in a similar way. The repression by betaine was due to its metabolic conversion to choline, which {{was found to be}} very efficient in A. nidulans. Betaine and choline supplementation stimulated growth of <b>leaky</b> metH <b>mutants</b> apparently by decreasing the demand for methyl groups and thus saving methionine and S -adenosylmethionine. We have also found that homocysteine stimulates transcription of MS-encoding genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe...|$|R
40|$|During fine {{structure}} analyses of artificially induced waxy mutants in maize {{by use of}} Nelson's pollen analysis methods, it was noticed that some mutants showed a phenotype intermediate between waxy and normal nonwaxy. Such intermediate or <b>leaky</b> waxy <b>mutants</b> were frequent among mutants induced by a chemical mutagen, EMS. They seemed to be located evenly within the waxy locus. This would suggest {{that they might have}} been missense mutations, which would produce full-sized but partially inactivated enzymes, rather than deletions or frameshift mutations. To confirm the intermediate phenotype, a rapid measuring system was developed to measure waxyness of endosperm quantitatively. It was based on the blue value method and is applicable to a single grain of rice. Among the 27 waxy mutant lines of maize, including 11 EMS-induced, two of the EMS-induced mutants were clearly intermediate. Eighteen EMS induced wx mutants of rice were also examined, and nine were intermediate...|$|R
40|$|An indole-requiring (Ind−) mutant of Salmonella typhimurium, {{isolated}} from {{a culture of}} a <b>leaky</b> trpA <b>mutant,</b> was genetically analyzed by P 22 -mediated transduction. The mutation site giving the Ind− phenotype was shown to be in trpB, the second gene of the trp operon. A second mutation at this site resulted in change of nutritional requirement from indole to anthranilic acid (Anth−). This phenotype is normally associated with mutations in the first trp gene, trpA. However, the Anth− mutant also excreted anthranilic acid and showed “self-feeding” on unsupplemented media. Of two possible explanations for this aberrant phenotype, the first, that the trpB mutations {{may be in the}} “unusual” region, was dismissed on genetic evidence and on the biochemical evidence that an active anthranilate synthetase (AS) is produced. The alternative explanation, that the affected enzymatic activity, phosphoribosyl transferase, is unstable in vivo, but its AS component 2 activity is stable, is considered more probable...|$|R
40|$|A <b>leaky</b> guaB <b>mutant</b> of Salmonella typhimurium LT- 2 was {{obtained}} during a selection for mutants resistant {{to a combination}} of the two pyrimidine analogs, 5 -fluorouracil and 5 -fluorouridine. In the absence of exogenous guanine compounds, the growth rate of this mutant is limited by the endogenous supply of guanine nucleotides due to a defective inosine 5 '-monophosphate dehydrogenase. Under these conditions the guanosine 5 '-triphosphate pool is about 20 % of normal, the cytidine 5 '-triphosphate pool is reduced to below 60 %, and the uridine 5 '-triphosphate pool is slightly elevated. Simultaneously, levels of the pyrimidine biosynthetic enzymes are abnormal: aspartate transcarbamylase, orotate phosphoribosyltransferase, and orotidylic acid decarboxylase levels are increased 4 -, 11 -, and 3 -fold, respectively. Levels of dihydroorotase and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase are decreased to 10 and 20 %, respectively. The pyrimidine metabolism of the guaB mutant is restored completely by addition of guanine (or xanthine) to the growth medium. The data indicate purine nucleotide involvement in the regulation of expression of the pyr genes of S. typhimurium...|$|R
40|$|Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} (Mtb) must {{cope with}} exogenous oxidative stress {{imposed by the}} host. Unlike other antioxidant enzymes, Mtb's thioredoxin reductase TrxB 2 has been predicted to be essential not only to fight host defenses but also for in vitro growth. However, the specific physiological role of TrxB 2 and its importance for Mtb pathogenesis remain undefined. Here we show that genetic inactivation of thioredoxin reductase perturbed several growth-essential processes, including sulfur and DNA metabolism and rapidly killed and lysed Mtb. Death was due to cidal thiol-specific oxidizing stress and prevented by a disulfide reductant. In contrast, thioredoxin reductase deficiency did not significantly increase susceptibility to oxidative and nitrosative stress. In vivo targeting TrxB 2 eradicated Mtb during both acute and chronic phases of mouse infection. Deliberately <b>leaky</b> knockdown <b>mutants</b> identified the specificity of TrxB 2 inhibitors and showed that partial inactivation of TrxB 2 increased Mtb's susceptibility to rifampicin. These studies reveal TrxB 2 as essential thiol-reducing enzyme in Mtb in vitro and during infection, establish the value of targeting TrxB 2, and provide tools to accelerate the development of TrxB 2 inhibitors...|$|R
