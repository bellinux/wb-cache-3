30|$|In {{the above}} discussions, {{it has been}} brought out that if the {{strength}} at plastic <b>limit</b> <b>and</b> at liquid <b>limit</b> are 1.7 <b>and</b> 170  kPa respectively, then experimental results indicate that both liquid <b>limit</b> <b>and</b> plastic <b>limit</b> are uniquely related as given in Eq. (7). This leads to the redundent of plasticity chart which is extensively used by practicing geotechnical engineers. Though the concept that undrained shear strength at liquid <b>limit</b> <b>and</b> at the plastic limit can be uniquely related which in turn leads to unique relation between liquid <b>limit</b> <b>and</b> plastic <b>limit</b> of the soils, this {{can be said to}} be true only when plastic limit is determined from the cone penetration test assuming a 100 -fold increase in shear strength over that at the liquid limit.|$|R

The analytic method {{used in the}} developed system was different to traditional method of treating soil liquid <b>limit</b> <b>and</b> plastic <b>limit</b> data. N-S algorithm flowchart demonstrated that switch statement and condition statement were taken as main algorithm and second level select nested structure was taken as main frame for the developed system. Three kinds of soil specimens were tested with liquid <b>and</b> plastic <b>limit</b> combined test <b>and</b> the test data was treated with graphic method, Excel software <b>and</b> Soil Liquid <b>Limit</b> <b>and</b> Plastic <b>Limit</b> Data Treating System. The comparative conclusion indicated that Soil Liquid <b>Limit</b> <b>and</b> Plastic <b>Limit</b> Data Treating System improved efficiency and accuracy evidently for treating soil liquid <b>and</b> plastic <b>limit</b> data <b>and</b> had advantages of easy operation and high reliability...|$|R
