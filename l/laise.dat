In fluorescent materials, energy from a certain band of incident wavelengths is reflected or reradiated at larger wavelengths, i. e. with lower energy per photon. While fluorescent materials are common in everyday life, they have received little attention in computer graphics. Especially, no bidirectional reflectance measurements of fluorescent materials have been available so far. In this paper, we develop the concept of a bispectral BRDF, which extends the well-known concept of the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) to account for energy transfer between wavelengths. Using a bidi-rectional and bispectral measurement setup, we acquire reflectance data o...|$|E

We performed a systematic review of studies published in the 1965 - 2012 period and indexed in the MEDLINE and LILACS databases. A total of 1, 389 articles were initially selected. After reading their abstracts, we selected 85 studies. Of those 85 studies, 16 {{were included in the}} review. Risk factors for adverse reactions to antituberculosis drugs included age> 60 years, treatment regimens, alcoholism, anemia, and HIV co-infection, as well as sodium, iron, and albumin deficiency. Protective factors against hepatic adverse effects of antituberculosis drugs included being male (combined OR = 0. 38; 95 % CI: 0. 20 - 0. 72) and showing a rapid/intermediate N-acetyltransferase 2 acetylator phenotype (combined OR = 0. 41; 95 % CI: 0. 18 - 0. 90). There is evidence to support the need for management of adverse reactions to antituberculosis drugs at public health care facilities...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{taxation}} of North Sea oil {{is found to}} deter oilfield investment substantiaty - investment which it pursued would bring about Pareto benefits. Analysis of both the comparative static tax effects and the dynamics of taxation on oilfield development decisions reveals {{the nature of the}} deterrent, while a specially developed econometric model is used to quantify the impact of the tax structure and of tax changes on recoverable reserves. By detailing the mechanisms through which taxation distorts the allocation of investment resources away from North Sea developments, the thesis stresses that individual tax clauses tend not to perform the roles allotted to them and that tax changes alter the economics of oil projects in ways and in magnitudes that {{do not seem to be}} realised. Hence, not only is the nature of these effects misunderstood, but the extent oi these effects is much more damaging than commonly appreciated. These findings are reached by following the principles laid out in the early chapters which suggest that, if an improvement in the allocation of resources is to occur, <b>laise</b> beliets must be reclined. In particular, the inconsistencies between the targets and instruments of North Sea policy suggest there are false beliets about the need to stimulate development decisions and about the role of taxation - suggestions which are confirmed in the detailed research of the thesis. Having condemned existing North Sea oil tax policy, a practical, feasible and attainable alternative to the current tax system, that would not distort investment decisions so severely, is recommended...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to place the value {{creation}} process within sustainable growth strategies. Building on Drucker (1968, 1999 a, b), Pulic (2000, 2004, 2008) and other papers by the same authors (Iazzolino and <b>Laise,</b> 2013) the specific aim of this research is to propose an accounting-based framework able to: distinguish between knowledge-intensive firms (KIFs) and nonknowledge intensive firms (nonKIFs); and investigate the contribution of the two sets of firms (KIFs and nonKIFs) to overall sustainability, from a social point of view, of the economic system. Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses the notion of value added (VA) (Pulic, 2000, 2004, 2008) as the main indicator to measure the value creation in a knowledge economy context. As regard the first point of the framework, the approach is based on the analysis of VA and its components, starting from a reinterpretation of the concept of value added intellectual coefficient made by the same authors of this paper. An empirical analysis based on the composition of VA in ten Italian industries, by using an overall sample of 1, 000 firms, has been carried out and is described in the paper. As regards the second point, the paper analyses, from a theoretical point of view, the necessary conditions to set up a sustainable value creation strategy in social terms, using the conceptual categories introduced by Drucker (1968, 1999 a, b) and Pulic (2000, 2004, 2008). Findings – From results of the empirical analysis it emerges that: first, in traditional industries the weight of the cost of employees on VA (human capital investments) is less than the other sectors (low human capital intensity). In these sectors the value creation strategy is mainly based on “dead knowledge,” embedded in machines (physical capital); and second, in nontraditional industries (consulting, advertising, research, etc.) the economic value creation is mainly based on “living knowledge,” embedded in human resources (high human capital intensity). In these sectors we have lower productivity of work (VA/human capital) and higher employment. Practical implications – The framework proposed makes it possible to reduce the risk of myopic valuation of economic performance. Through this methodology it is possible to highlight the effects of sustainable strategies based on knowledge investments oriented toward the stakeholder value theory and corporate social responsibility. The approach can be very useful for top managers and for accountants, as it underlines the importance of the VA income statement and constructs a strong link to the themes of knowledge management. Originality/value – The originality and the value of this methodological proposal can be appreciated by taking into account that in the literature there is no accounting-based methodology that is able to identify: the knowledge-intensive firms; and the firms that can contribute to overall social sustainability, within the set of all firms. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|E
