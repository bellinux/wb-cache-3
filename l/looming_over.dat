5|$|The {{remaining}} {{parts of}} the castle continued {{to be used as}} a manor house into the 14th century. By the 18th century, however, Dolbadarn Castle was ruined and uninhabited. From the 1760s onwards, however, it became a popular topic for painters interested in the then fashionable landscape styles of the Sublime and the Picturesque. Typically the castle was painted in the middle ground, allowing the viewer's eye to contrast its ruined outline with the lakes and mountains of Snowdonia; frequently the landscape was misrepresented by the artist, to create a more striking or dramatic effect. J. M. W. Turner's 1800 work Dolbadarn Castle depicted the back-lit castle <b>looming</b> <b>over</b> the landscape and became particularly famous, but the paintings of the castle by Richard Wilson and Paul Sandby also represent important artistic works of the period.|$|E

25|$|A {{combination}} of Moray's early death in battle and his close association with Wallace, {{a man who}} has become a near mythical figure in Scottish history, has meant that his achievements were little known. Although there are many statues to Wallace scattered across Scotland, from Aberdeen in the northeast to Dryburgh in the Scottish borders, though these are all surpassed by the Gothic extravagance of the National Wallace Monument <b>looming</b> <b>over</b> the site of the battle of Stirling Bridge, there is no similar monument to Moray. This situation {{has been turned into a}} political issue. At the close of December 2009, Murdo Fraser, a Conservative List MSP for Mid-Scotland and Fife, called for a national debate on an appropriate monument to Moray. He stated that it should raise awareness of his historical role.|$|E
25|$|Closer {{as friends}} over summer 2006, sexual tension between Babe and Josh becomes evident. Even though still married to JR, Babe starts to have romantic {{feelings}} for Josh and feels {{the need to}} be there for him when Dr. Greg Madden (the man he believes to be his father) goes missing. Babe supports Josh, talks him down, and tries to be there for him as a friend. When it is found that Greg Madden has died due to being buried alive underground for weeks, Babe sticks by Josh and seeks to help him through this. This enrages JR, causing more problems for their marriage. Due to the lack of communication, JR's murder attempt on her, their increased fighting, the Greg Madden murder mystery <b>looming</b> <b>over</b> their heads, and the search for Kate (JR's long-lost sister), JR and Babe begin shutting down on one another. This leads Babe to turn to Josh, confiding in him even more and spending more time with him.|$|E
25|$|In 1348, {{while the}} black plague ravaged Europe, the Alcazaba and the castle of Gibralfaro took their final shape. The city had several gates that allowed {{passage through the}} walls, some of which still stand today, such as the Puerta Oscura (Dark Gate) and the Puerta del Mar (Sea Gate). <b>Looming</b> <b>over</b> the port, the Alcazaba was the Moorish citadel built on the hill called Mount Gibralfaro in {{the centre of the}} city, on whose summit was the castle. The citadel and the castle were {{connected}} by a corridor known as La Coracha between two zig-zagging walls that followed the contours of the land. Erected in the 11th century, the Alcazaba combined defensive fortifications with residential palaces and inner gardens; it was fortified with three walls towards the sea, and two facing the town. Antonio de Nebrija counted, in the circumference of the castle, 110 large towers, besides a great number of turrets. The same walls also enclosed the whole compound, though each building had its own entrance. The Puerta de los Arcos (Gate of the Arch) of the Torre del Tinel (Tower of Tinel) was the entrance to the Nasrid palace in the enclosure dating to the 13th and 14th centuries. Remnants of the old city wall remain today in Calle Alamos and Calle Carreteria.|$|E

25|$|Percy Jackson {{learns that}} Kronos' forces are {{preparing}} to attack Olympus. Poseidon, Percy's father, decides {{that it is time}} for Percy to now fulfill the Great Prophecy. Seeking to defeat Kronos, like Achilles did, Percy bathes in the River Styx, making his body invulnerable except one small chosen part of his body (the small of his back). Kronos leads a siege of New York City and puts its citizens to sleep. Percy leads the campers, Hunters, nature spirits, and centaurs to protect Mount Olympus from Kronos and his forces. While they protect Olympus, the gods hold down the monster Typhon as he makes his way to New York. Kronos, possessing Luke's body, forces his way into Olympus and battles Percy in Olympus' throne room. Typhon reaches New York but is defeated after the arrival of Poseidon's forces, led by Tyson. Annabeth is able to make Luke come back to his senses, and Percy gives him Annabeth's knife. Luke stabs himself in his mortal spot (as he also was invulnerable from bathing in the River Styx) to destroy Kronos and save Mount Olympus, but Luke dies. The gods reward Percy and his friends, and offer him immortality. He rejects the offer, but instead requests the gods to claim all their children and to have cabins for all the gods, including the minor ones. Rachel Elizabeth Dare becomes the Oracle and recites the next Great Prophecy. The book finishes with Percy and Annabeth becoming a couple, and ominous clouds <b>looming</b> <b>over</b> Rachel's next Great Prophecy.|$|E

[...] In June 1939, the Rossis sailed for New York, where they were greeted by Fermi and his wife Laura, who had also left Italy because of the racial laws. [...] After a brief reunion with the Fermis, the Rossis were offered a ride to Chicago by Bethe. [...] They gratefully accepted, and arrived at the University of Chicago in mid-June 1939.|$|E
500|$|Karma is also criticised on {{the grounds}} that it leads to the {{dampening}} of spirits with men suffering the ills of life because the course of one's life is determined by karma. [...] It is often maintained that the impression of karma as the accumulation of a mountain of bad deeds <b>looming</b> <b>over</b> our heads without any recourse leads to fatalism. However, as Paul Dundas puts it, the Jain theory of karma does not imply lack of free will or operation of total deterministic control over destinies. Furthermore, the doctrine of karma does not promote fatalism amongst its believers on account of belief in personal responsibility of actions and that austerities could expatiate the evil karmas and it was possible to attain salvation by emulating the life of the Jinas.|$|E

The poster for [...] "Providence", created by Paolo Rivera, highlights the rise of Hydra by showing a melded Hydra and S.H.I.E.L.D. logo, and depicts the team divided by Coulson, Raina, and Ward. The poster for [...] "The Only Light in The Darkness", created by Pascal Campion, focuses on Coulson and his cellist lover, Audrey, while also hinting at the villain for the episode, Marcus Daniels. The poster for [...] "Nothing Personal", created by Stephanie Hans, [...] highlights Skye and Ward in a depiction of a moment from the episode, with Deathlok <b>looming</b> <b>over</b> them, and the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo in the background. The poster for [...] "Ragtag", created by Emma Ríos, depicts significant moments in Ward's life, as well as Fitz–Simmons in danger, and Skye looming behind the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo, {{as if she is}} a presence that Ward cannot seem to shake. The poster for [...] "Beginning of the End", created by Phantom City Creative, is reminiscent of the first official poster released, with differences including the characters' order and clothing, the poster's coloring, a broken S.H.I.E.L.D. logo over Hydra's, and Ward being tinted by Hydra.|$|E

2500|$|The British {{government}} initially {{accepted the}} Peel report in principle. However, with war clouds <b>looming</b> <b>over</b> Europe, {{they realized that}} to attempt to implement it against {{the will of the}} Palestinian Arab majority would rouse up the entire Arab world against Britain. The Woodhead Commission considered three different plans, one of which was based on the Peel plan. Reporting in 1938, the Commission rejected the Peel plan primarily {{on the grounds that it}} could not be implemented without a massive forced transfer of Arabs (an option that the British government had already ruled out). [...] With dissent from some of its members, the Commission instead recommended a plan that would leave the Galilee under British mandate, but emphasised serious problems with it that included a lack of financial self-sufficiency of the proposed Arab State. The British Government accompanied the publication of the Woodhead Report by a statement of policy rejecting partition as impracticable due to [...] "political, administrative and financial difficulties".|$|E
2500|$|Unfortunately, Elderspeak {{is based}} on {{stereotypes}} and not actual behaviour of elders because it is used in situations where older adults are clearly functioning well. Elderspeak is actually offensive but nursing home residents are no longer offended by these speech patterns because they have claimed it as a normal habit. [...] The use of elderspeak in more [...] “warmth” [...] and lower in a “superiority” dimension when the speaker was a family member and/or friend compared to an unfamiliar. Generally, young adults use an overstated version of elderspeak when addressing impaired older persons. When older adults converse with older people with cognitive impairments, they make speech accommodations {{to a lesser extent}} than young people. They speak more slowly and incorporate more pauses, however they do not use more repetition as young people do. It is possible that older speakers may not accommodate their speech as much in order to avoid seeming patronizing. Research shows that approximately 80% of communication is non verbal. Elderspeak involves communicating to the older adult in a coddling way, which includes non verbal cues and gestures. An example would be <b>looming</b> <b>over</b> a wheelchair or bed in dominancy, or a pat on the buttocks resembling parent-child touching.|$|E
