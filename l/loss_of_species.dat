5|$|The {{end of the}} Permian saw a major {{turnover}} in fauna during the Permian–Triassic extinction event: probably the most severe mass extinction event of the phanerozoic. There was a protracted <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>species,</b> due to multiple extinction pulses. Many of the once large and diverse groups died out or were greatly reduced.|$|E
5|$|The <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>species</b> from {{ecological}} communities, defaunation, {{is primarily}} driven by human activity. This {{has resulted in}} empty forests, ecological communities depleted of large vertebrates. In the Quaternary extinction event, the mass die-off of megafaunal variety coincided {{with the appearance of}} humans, suggesting a human influence. One hypothesis is that humans hunted large mammals, such as the woolly mammoth, into extinction.|$|E
5|$|Humans play a {{key role}} in the biosphere, with the large human {{population}} dominating many of Earth's ecosystems. This has resulted in a widespread, ongoing mass extinction of other species during the present geological epoch, now known as the Holocene extinction. The large-scale <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>species</b> caused by human influence since the 1950s has been called a biotic crisis, with an estimated 10% of the total species lost as of 2007. At current rates, about 30% of species are at risk of extinction in the next hundred years. The Holocene extinction event is the result of habitat destruction, the widespread distribution of invasive species, hunting, and climate change. In the present day, human activity has had a significant impact on the surface of the planet. More than a third of the land surface has been modified by human actions, and humans use about 20% of global primary production. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by close to 30% since the start of the Industrial Revolution.|$|E

50|$|But the few {{species that}} were hunted by humans that became extinct doesn’t {{account for the}} <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> so many <b>species.</b> The <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> some {{cornerstone}} <b>species</b> typically can result in an implosion of population and diversity similar to what we see during the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene. This was probably caused by some <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> major <b>species</b> <b>of</b> vegetation.|$|R

25|$|The {{groups with}} the highest {{survival}} rates generally had active control of circulation, elaborate gas exchange mechanisms, and light calcification; more heavily calcified organisms with simpler breathing apparatuses suffered the greatest <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>species</b> diversity. In {{the case of the}} brachiopods, at least, surviving taxa were generally small, rare members of a formerly diverse community.|$|E
25|$|Although {{biodiversity}} loss can {{be monitored}} simply as <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>species,</b> effective conservation demands {{the protection of}} species within their natural habitats and ecosystems. Following human migration and population growth, species extinctions have progressively increased to a rate unprecedented since the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. Known as the Holocene extinction event this current human-induced extinction of species {{ranks as one of}} the worlds six mass extinction events. Some scientific estimates indicate that up to half of presently existing species may become extinct by 2100. Current extinction rates are 100 to 1000 times their prehuman levels with more than 10% birds and mammals threatened, about 8% of plants, 5% of fish and more than 20% of freshwater species.|$|E
25|$|Animal {{diversity}} is modest, {{as a result}} of factors including the island's small land area, the relatively recent age of the habitats developed since the last glacial period and the island's physical separation from continental Europe, and the effects of seasonal variability. Great Britain also experienced early industrialisation and is subject to continuing urbanisation, which have contributed towards the overall <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>species.</b> A DEFRA (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) study from 2006 suggested that 100 species have become extinct in the UK during the 20th century, about 100 times the background extinction rate. However, some species, such as the brown rat, red fox, and introduced grey squirrel, are well adapted to urban areas.|$|E

25|$|The Fraterculini {{are thought}} to have {{originated}} in the Pacific primarily because of their greater diversity there; there is only one extant species in the Atlantic, compared to two in the Pacific. The Fraterculini fossil record in the Pacific extends at least {{as far back as the}} middle Miocene, with three fossil species of Cerorhinca, and material tentatively referred to that genus, in the middle Miocene to late Pliocene of southern California and northern Mexico. Although there no records from the Miocene in the Atlantic, a re-examination of the North Carolina material indicated that the diversity of puffins in the early Pliocene was as great in the Atlantic as it is in the Pacific today. This diversity was achieved through influxes of puffins from the Pacific; the later <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>species</b> was due to major oceanographic changes in the late Pliocene due to closure of the Panamanian Seaway and the onset of severe glacial cycles in the North Atlantic.|$|E
500|$|Repeated {{formation}} of new species (speciation), change within species (anagenesis), and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>species</b> (extinction) throughout the evolutionary history {{of life on}} Earth are demonstrated by shared sets of morphological and biochemical traits, including shared DNA sequences. These shared traits are more similar among species that share a more recent common ancestor, {{and can be used}} to reconstruct a biological [...] "tree of life" [...] based on evolutionary relationships (phylogenetics), using both existing species and fossils. The fossil record includes a progression from early biogenic graphite, to microbial mat fossils, to fossilised multicellular organisms. Existing patterns of biodiversity have been shaped both by speciation and by extinction.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The fish {{communities}} of all Austrian natural lakes (n 43) larger than 50 ha in surface area were assessed {{and the historical}} fish communities in c. 1850 were reconstructed. During the last 150 years, the fish {{communities of}} Austrian lakes have altered: in 49 % of lakes at least one indigenous fish species, usually sensitive or small-bodied taxa, is now missing. Conversely, {{in all but one}} of the 43 lakes the number <b>of</b> fish <b>species</b> has increased. In particular, certain fish <b>species</b> <b>of</b> interest to angling and commercial fisheries now occur in more lakes. Generalised linear models were used to identify variables that would explain the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> fish <b>species</b> using categories <b>of</b> lake use (ranking score). The category human population density around the lakes seemed to be one of the main causes for the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> fish <b>species.</b> KEYWORDS: Directive. fish communities, human impact, indigenous fish <b>species,</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> fish <b>species,</b> Water Framewor...|$|R
2500|$|The {{depletion}} {{of natural resources}} can have dramatic effects on island ecology. [...] On Easter Island, the {{depletion of}} the forest by humans not only resulted in widespread <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>species,</b> but also {{the collapse of the}} island civilization. [...] Today there are over 500 million people on islands, all dependent on local resources either directly (traditional use) or indirectly (ecotourism revenue). [...] Population growth and development result in heavy deforestation, pollution, and over-exploitation. [...] Overharvesting of ocean fauna is particularly troubling as yields of coral reef fish species are an important food source for island populations.|$|E
2500|$|The {{construction}} of the large dams necessary to harness the power of water starkly change the natural shape of the environment.

[...] Also, the major amounts of concrete needed for these dams mean more CO2 being discharged into the atmosphere and promote runoff that limits the recharging ability of underground aquifers that provide potable water. [...] Some legislation that seeks to curb the negative environmental effects of dam-building can be found below.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{disturbance}} on local species diversity {{have been well}} documented, but less recognized {{is the possibility that}} disturbances can alter diversity at regional spatial scales. Since regional diversity can dictate which species are available for recolonization of degraded sites, the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> diversity at regional scales may impede the recovery of biodiversity following a disturbance. To examine this we used a chemical disturbance of rotenone, a piscicide commonly used for fish removal in aquatic habitats, on small fishless freshwater ponds. We focused on the non-target effects of rotenone on aquatic invertebrates with the goal <b>of</b> assessing biodiversity <b>loss</b> and recovery at both local (within-pond) and regional (across ponds) spatial scales. We found that rotenone caused significant, large, but short-term <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>species</b> at both local and regional spatial scales. Using a null model of random extinction, we determined that species were selectively removed from communities relative to what would be expected if species loss occurred randomly. Despite this selective <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> biodiversity, <b>species</b> diversity at both local and regional spatial scales recovered to reference levels one year after the addition of rotenone. The rapid recovery of local and regional diversity in this study was surprising considering the large <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> regional <b>species</b> diversity, however many aquatic invertebrates disperse readily or have resting stages that may persist through disturbances. We emphasize the importance of considering spatial scale when quantifying the impacts of a disturbance on an ecosystem, as well as considering how regional species loss can influence recovery from disturbance...|$|R

40|$|When species presence–absence {{data are}} {{analyzed}} across {{a range of}} sites, many communities show a “checkerboard distribution” in which two or more species do not co-occur despite sharing geographic ranges and habitat requirements. It is not clear how the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> native <b>species</b> might shift the underlying checkerboard structure. I tracked changes in the incidence of 175 vascular plant species across 59 sites in northern Wisconsin that have declined in species density between 1950 and 2000. Based on C-scores and the number of perfect checkerboard distributions, there was significant co-occurrence structure in both time periods. The nature of that structure depended on the particular null model was constructed. When only row values are fixed, plant species showed greater degrees of co-occurrence than the null model predicted, while fixing both rows and columns yielded less co-occurrence than found in the null model. Changes in species density did not strongly influence co-occurrence patterns, reflecting relative stability of co-occurrence patterns over a 50 -year interval. This suggests that minor <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>species</b> will not necessarily lead to fundamental changes in co-occurrence structure...|$|R
40|$|This {{work was}} {{conducted}} in a tropical montane cloud forest in south Ecuador. For three years, water-chemical, hydrological and biological parameters were measured and compared between land-uses. Pasture streams showed higher concentrations of base cations, probably resulting from deforestation and burning of the forest. Another factor influencing the water chemistry was gravel excavation and the input of road construction material. These results highlight the high susceptibility of cloud forest streams to different kinds of anthropogenic disturbances. The macroinvertebrate fauna also differed considerably between forested and pasture streams. There was a shift in macroinvertebrate species, higher abundances in pasture streams and a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> some <b>species</b> with deforestation, {{the most prominent of}} which was the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> Odonata <b>species...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{importance}} of stability in community ecology is clear. An unstable ecosystem {{will be more}} likely to lose species. Thus, if there is indeed a link between diversity and stability, it is likely that <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> diversity could feedback on themselves, causing even more <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>species.</b> Productivity, on the other hand, has a less clear importance in community ecology. In managed areas like cropland, and in areas where animals are grown or caught, increasing productivity increases the economic success of the area and implies that the area has become more efficient, leading to possible long term resource sustainability. It is more difficult to find the {{importance of}} productivity in natural ecosystems.|$|R
