Partridge also observed, [...] "Dylan has always loved American mythology and all things archaic, and his best songs on recent albums have been rooted in pre-rock pop. When he gets wistful on [...] "The Night We Called It a Day" [...] or grabs hold of moonbeams on the South Pacific favorite [...] "Some Enchanted Evening", he's natural and sincere." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian praised the album, stating that [...] "it may be the most straightforwardly enjoyable album Dylan's made since Time Out of Mind". Jesse Cataldo of Slant Magazine thought that the album [...] "deepens the innate sorrow of these old tunes by establishing them on a long, irregular continuum, possessing the same inherent mutability as the folk songs of Dylan's early days".|$|E

Reed added that he spends [...] "a lot of time" [...] talking with the other writers and directors of MCU films, and {{that he and the}} writers on this film wished to maintain [...] "our little Ant-Man corner of the universe.

Tulsa head coach Todd Graham said of Johnson, [...] "We'd <b>like</b> to have <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> can run, but we've adapted to Dave's style with more drop-back passes instead of naked bootlegs."

Ally & Gargano creative director Ron Berger said that Vale got the role because of his likeability and believability: [...] "Michael was 100% believable. He looked and talked and walked and breathed <b>like</b> he was <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> got up at 4 a.m... Lou was good. But when it came to the final decision, Michael was the donut maker.

5000|$|During this show, Carlin criticized {{elections}} as {{an illusion}} of choice. He said {{the last time he}} voted was in 1972, for George McGovern, who ran for President against Richard Nixon. He also criticized religion, mocked traditional oath affirmations on the Bible as [...] "bullshit," [...] "make believe," [...] and [...] "kid stuff"; however, in the same show, he warned, [...] "Be happy, don't be proud, there's too much pride as it is. 'Pride goeth before the fall'—never forget Proverbs." [...] He described and derided the types of hats that religions ban, or require, as part of their practices, and remarked that he would never {{want to be a part}} of a group that requires or bans the wearing of hats. Carlin joked in his second book, Brain Droppings, that he worshipped the Sun because he could see it, and prayed to Joe Pesci [...] "because he seems <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> could get things done."

5000|$|In its {{review of}} the inaugural Premier Boxing Champions event on NBC, Bad Left Hook praised the event's on-air {{production}} style for feeling more like a [...] "modern", [...] "true mainstream sports show" [...] than the boxing events of HBO and Showtime, along {{with the performance of}} Al Michaels, Steve Smoger, and BJ Flores. The performance of Marv Albert was panned, noting that he [...] "missed a lot of the action", along with Steve Farhood's lack of contributions beyond scoring the fights. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack was also criticized for being [...] "generic" [...] and [...] "robbing fighters of their own personalities." [...] Bleacher Report was similarly mixed, describing the atmosphere as being too [...] "sterile" [...] for a sport that [...] "thrives on chaos", and that [...] "the bland short walks to the ring and generic music presenting the fighters as interchangeable automatons are more NFL than WWE". NBC's on-air talent also received mixed reviews, especially the poor performance of Albert, explaining that [...] "Albert, who hasn't called boxing since 1985, sounded <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> hadn't called boxing in 30 years. He had a hard time keeping up with the action, eventually giving up on play-by-play and occasionally adding a booming 'Yes!' whenever a particularly telling blow landed." ...|$|E
50|$|With {{the game}} on the line, Marshall {{suddenly}} looked <b>like</b> anything but <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who's</b> had six weeks to learn an offense. He hit freshman Marcus Davis on three straight passes to cover 29 yards, then had a 17-yarder to Jaylon Denson. He also salvaged short gains {{with a couple of}} runs before heading out of bounds. Tre Mason's 3-yard run pushed it to the 11 before Auburn called timeout with 15 seconds left.Marshall was 23-of-34 passing for 339 yards and two touchdowns but was intercepted twice. He passed for just 246 yards and two TDs in his first two games as starter combined. Marshall showed a knack for turning potential miscues into big plays. He dropped the shotgun snap, collected it on the bounce and hit a wide-open Quan Bray downfield for a 76-yard touchdown on the opening drive. Ryan White then hit Brandon Fulse for the two-point conversion.In the third quarter, Marshall caught his own batted pass and raced for a 37-yard gain. The Bulldogs forced the Tigers to settle for Cody Parkey's 47-yard field goal after Jamerson Love tackled Corey Grant for a loss. Parkey also had a 40-yarder and 19-yarder.|$|R
5000|$|Simon Baz's {{debut in}} Green Lantern #0 was, overall, met with {{positive}} reviews, praising Baz's characterization {{as well as}} the opportunities for social commentary provided by his background. Joey Esposito of IGN wrote, [...] "Johns showcases Baz’s strength of character by allowing him to admit that he is, in fact, a criminal (he was stealing a car), and that upon learning the car he jacked carried a bomb on board, he had heroic intentions. Johns is able to rely on the very real climate of a post-9/11 America to let readers infer certain aspects of Baz’s younger years, leaving him ample space for a well-written interrogation scene that reveals more about both Baz and the agents interrogating him," [...] before going on to say [...] "Though it’s only been one issue, I fully expect Baz - if he survives for a while, of course - to become another successful addition to Earth’s Green Lanterns." [...] Doug Zawisza of Comic Book Resources wrote of Baz, [...] "Geoff Johns makes Baz a sympathetic character despite his obvious flaws. Make no mistake, Baz isn't <b>a</b> hero <b>like</b> Hal Jordan, but he also isn't <b>a</b> villain <b>like</b> Sinestro. He's <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> is trying to get by the best he can and, right now, he's breaking a few rules to do that."
