5|$|Raucher's novelization of his {{screenplay}} of {{the same}} name was released prior to the film's release and became a runaway bestseller, to the point that audiences <b>lost</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fact that the book was based on the film and not vice versa. Though a pop culture phenomenon {{in the first half of}} the 1970s, the novelization went out of print and slipped into obscurity throughout the next two decades until a Broadway adaptation in 2001 brought it back into the public light and prompted Barnes & Noble to acquire the publishing rights to the book.|$|E
5|$|At {{about this}} time, Yūnagi {{detached}} from the Japanese column and reversed direction, perhaps because she <b>lost</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other Japanese ships ahead of her, or perhaps she was ordered to provide a rearguard for Mikawa's force. One minute later, Japanese lookouts sighted a warship to port. This ship was the destroyer , heavily damaged {{the day before and}} now departing Guadalcanal independently for repairs in Australia. Whether Jarvis sighted the Japanese ships is unknown, since her radios had been destroyed. Furutaka launched torpedoes at Jarvis, which all missed. The Japanese ships passed as close to Jarvis as 1,100 meters, close enough for officers on Tenryū to look down onto the destroyer's decks without seeing any of her crew moving about. If Jarvis was aware of the Japanese ships passing by, she did not respond in any noticeable way.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Patterson {{engaged in}} a gun duel with the Japanese column. Patterson {{received}} a shell hit aft, causing moderate damage and killing 10 crew members. Patterson continued to pursue and fire at the Japanese ships and may have hit Kinugasa, causing moderate damage. Patterson then <b>lost</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Japanese column as it headed northeast along {{the eastern shore of}} Savo Island. Bagley, whose crew sighted the Japanese shortly after Patterson and Canberra, circled completely around to port before firing torpedoes {{in the general direction of}} the rapidly disappearing Japanese column; one or two of which may have hit Canberra. Bagley played no further role in the battle. Yūnagi exchanged non-damaging gunfire with Jarvis before exiting the battle area to the west with the intention of eventually rejoining the Japanese column north and west of Savo Island.|$|E

5|$|Lipsett {{decided to}} tow New Mexico for {{scrapping}} at Newark, New Jersey. The proximity of Newark to rail lines {{made it an}} ideal location for dismantling the ship and hauling away the steel. In early November 1947 New Mexico departed Boston, towed by two tugs. On 12 November, while {{off the coast of}} New York, the tugs pulling the battleship encountered heavy weather and were forced to cut the tow lines. Running lights were kept on aboard New Mexico along with three crewmembers, but the tugs eventually <b>lost</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battleship. New Mexico then drifted as a derelict until spotted by a Coast Guard plane the next day, 35 miles off the coast. The two tugs then secured tow lines and continued the journey to the scrapyard.|$|E
5|$|The {{blockade}} squadron off Lorient {{comprised the}} ships {{of the line}} HMS Theseus, HMS Triumph and HMS Valiant under Commodore John Poo Beresford, watching three ships in the harbour under Contre-amiral Amable Troude. At 15:15 Paget, who had <b>lost</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French, reached the waters off Lorient and signaled a warning to Beresford. At 16:30, Beresford's squadron sighted Willaumez's fleet, tacking to the southeast. Willaumez ordered his second-in-command, Contre-amiral Antoine Louis de Gourdon to drive Beresford away and Gourdoun brought four ships around to chase the British squadron, with {{the remainder of the}} French fleet following more distantly. Beresford turned away to the northwest, thus clearing the route to Lorient. His objective achieved, Gourdan rejoined Willaumez and the fleet sailed inshore, anchoring near the island of Groix.|$|E
5|$|Müller {{then decided}} to depart, owing {{to the risk of}} encountering {{superior}} warships. Upon leaving the harbor, he encountered a British freighter, , loaded with ammunition, that had already stopped to pick up a harbor pilot. While preparing to take possession of the ship, Emden had to recall her boats when she spotted an approaching ship. This proved to be the French destroyer , and the unprepared ship was quickly destroyed. Emden stopped to pick up survivors from Mousquet and departed at around 08:00 as the other French ships were raising steam in preparation to get underway. One officer and thirty-five sailors were plucked from the water. Another French destroyer tried to follow, but <b>lost</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German raider in a rainstorm. On 30 October, Emden stopped the British steamer Newburn and put the French sailors aboard her after they signed statements promising not to return to the war. The attack on Penang was a significant shock to the Entente powers, and caused them to delay the large convoys from Australia, since they would need more powerful escorts.|$|E

60|$|Not {{long after}} this, a boat arrived with orders for my companion, Mr Anderson, {{to pack up}} his worldly goods and start for Tadousac. The same day he bade me adieu and set sail.

5|$|Shortly after 20:00, the III Flotilla of torpedo boats {{attempted}} to rescue Wiesbadens crew, but heavy {{fire from the}} British battle line drove them off. Another attempt to reach the ship was made, but the torpedo boat crews <b>lost</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cruiser and were unable to locate her. The ship finally sank sometime between 01:45 and 02:45. Only one crew member survived the sinking; he {{was picked up by}} a Norwegian steamer the following day. Among the 589 killed was the well-known writer of poetry and fiction dealing with the life of fishermen and sailors, Johann Kinau, known under his pseudonym of Gorch Fock, who has since then been honored by having two training windjammers of the Kriegsmarine and the German Navy, respectively, named after him. The wreck of Wiesbaden was found in 1983 by divers of the German Navy, who removed both of the ship's screws. The ship lies on the sea floor upside down, and was the last German cruiser sunk at Jutland to be located.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, as Australia faced a large deficit on {{the first}} innings, Bert Oldfield played a long innings in support of Bill Ponsford, who scored 85. In {{the course of the}} innings, the English bowlers used bodyline against him, and he faced several short-pitched deliveries but took several fours from Larwood to move to 41. Having just conceded a four, Larwood bowled fractionally shorter and slightly slower. Oldfield attempted to hook but <b>lost</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ball and edged it onto his temple; the ball fractured his skull. Oldfield staggered away and fell to his knees and play stopped as Woodfull came onto the pitch and the angry crowd jeered and shouted, once more reaching the point where a riot seemed likely. Several English players thought about arming themselves with stumps should the crowd come onto the field. The ball which injured Oldfield was bowled to a conventional, non-bodyline field; Larwood immediately apologised but Oldfield said that it was his own fault before he was helped back to the dressing room and play continued. Jardine later secretly sent a telegram of sympathy to Oldfield's wife and arranged for presents to be given to his young daughters.|$|E
5|$|Within {{hours of}} departing from Toulon, the {{squadron}} {{was struck by}} a heavy gale. One of the ships of the line lost its mainmast and turned back for Toulon, and the remainder of the force was scattered. The British blockade force sighted the disparate squadron on the following morning and although the French escaped pursuit, HMS Minerve succeeded in capturing one of the isolated merchant vessels. By 25 March, all but three of Ganteaume's ships had been recovered and the force was limping southwards through the Tyrrhenian Sea when it ran directly into Warren's squadron as it returned from Sicily. Ganteaume turned southeastwards to escape and Warren gave chase, the faster vessels in his squadron gaining on the French but the slower ships, particularly HMS Gibraltar and HMS Athenienne, falling far behind. Concerned that this placed his squadron in danger of becoming separated during the night, Warren ordered his faster ships to slow down and gradually <b>lost</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French during the evening. Ganteaume took advantage of the respite to turn northwards in the darkness, and once again returned to Toulon.|$|E

25|$|The {{next round}} of the Championship had a {{staggered}} start: three matches began on 9 May, and five on 10 May. Warwickshire <b>lost</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leaders after a 193-run loss to Hampshire, while Lancashire {{had to give up}} their league lead while being on a bye. They played Durham UCCE, drawing the three-day game. Sussex seized the chance, beating defending champions Nottinghamshire inside three days at Hove despite going 86 down on first innings, which was enough to see them take the league lead. Middlesex lost their third successive Championship match, to Durham, while Kent and Yorkshire drew.|$|E
25|$|Their Championship cricket {{was less}} impressive, as they <b>lost</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leaders after a four-wicket defeat to Kent, where they conceded 232 in 35 overs {{to lose the}} match, and their one-day form was as woeful as usual, as they conceded 219 runs in 22 overs to Sussex in a {{shortened}} Sunday League game at Guildford, which they lost by 48 runs. A draw - their sixth of the Championship season - with Nottinghamshire followed, to leave them fourth in the table, twenty points adrift of the leaders Nottinghamshire. The Twenty20 Cup semi-finals and final was hosted at Surrey's home ground The Oval, but the home fans were disappointed in the team as Surrey {{went out in the}} semi-finals to Lancashire Lightning.|$|E

25|$|The {{investigation}} commission {{concluded that}} the accident {{was caused by the}} aircraft losing altitude, falling into a sideslip and descending into the ground, first hitting it with the right wingtip. The cause of loss of altitude was unknown, but could either have been part of a sideways banking maneuver or uncontrolled. The varying weather with pockets of good and poor visibility led the commission to believe that the aircraft could have flown into an area with fog and <b>lost</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horizon. It reported that the accident took place towards the end of a very long flight and that fatigue could have reduced the pilots' faculties. This could be a decisive pivoting factor in the narrow margins while maneuvering at such low altitudes. The commission found no signs of technical error on the aircraft. It also commented that flying at low altitudes over the sea was common because of the lower wind speeds.|$|E

At about 1:00 AM on July 17, Aroostook assisted in the capture of the SS James Battle.|$|E
25|$|Teutberga was {{not capable}} of bearing {{children}} and Lothair's reign was chiefly occupied by his efforts to obtain an annulment of their marriage, and his relations with his uncles Charles the Bald and Louis the German were influenced by his desire to obtain their support for this endeavour.
