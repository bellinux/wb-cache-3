50|$|The two {{subsequent}} Winchcombe Carson woolstores {{have their}} own entrances and are brick built, but are three-storey and less decorative. No 2 has tubular steel columns on the top floor, arched windows and <b>louvred</b> <b>ventilator</b> openings. Though connected {{to the rear of}} the Vernon Street store, it has an internal loading bay running between Ethel and Dath Streets for road transport. The third woolstore, which was completed in the 1950s, faces Ethel Street.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} {{rests on}} a base of pale cream bricks and the red brick exterior walls are decorated with bands of the same cream brick, which accent the wall face and the window sills and heads. Windows are simple lancets and door openings have flat stone lintels with corbelled shoulders or pointed arches of cream brick. The roof is of corrugated iron over exposed timber framing, with a timber-boarded ceiling. There is a timber-framed spire with <b>louvred</b> <b>ventilator</b> openings at the crossing of the transepts with the main roof.|$|E
50|$|Purported to be {{the oldest}} {{building}} on the property, the slab hut (with later additions) is situated west of the main homestead. The hut is lowset on timber stumps and has a steep, gabled, corrugated galvanised iron roof with no guttering. Its external walls comprise vertical timber slabs with battens covering the joints and horizontal boarding forming the gable ends. A small <b>louvred</b> <b>ventilator</b> is located in each gable. A timber-framed verandah with corrugated galvanised iron roof is attached along {{one side of the}} building and an addition attached along the opposite side. The addition is timber framed with chamferboard cladding on a suspended concrete slab on a concrete block base and a skillion roof of corrugated galvanised-iron. Windows comprise casements with eight pane sashes, casements with three pane sashes and louvres. The central section of the back wall is screened and has a screen door opening to the dining section.|$|E
50|$|The {{single storey}} sheds used for dyeing can be {{recognised}} by the <b>louvred</b> <b>ventilators</b> on their roofs.|$|R
50|$|The cab {{arrangement}} was made especially convenient for the crew. The double roof {{was lined with}} teak while side <b>louvre</b> <b>ventilators</b> with roller slides were fitted. The cab front and sides had ventilating doors. Sliding louvres in the cab sides provided adequate weather protection while the lookout had hinged adjustable glass windscreens. The cab was completely enclosed with sliding side doors and the crew had upholstered hinged seats with armrests.|$|R
2500|$|Oast {{houses are}} often called hop kilns in Australia. Tasmania {{is a major}} hop-growing area, as were parts of Victoria. During the 19th century, some of the Kentish hop growers emigrated, and took hops with them. Initially, Tasmanian oasts were {{converted}} from existing buildings (New Norfolk, Ranelagh) but later purpose built oasts were built (Valley Field, Bushy Park). These oasts had <b>louvred</b> <b>ventilators</b> instead of a cowl. The New Norfolk oast was converted from a watermill {{and is now a}} museum. Another location that has oasts was Tyenna. A modern oast of [...] was built at Bushy Park in 1982.|$|R
50|$|The former Australian Estates {{building}} is a two storeyed brick building set in alignment with the street boundary. The building currently displays the street number 184. Its cement rendered facade is painted, and is asymmetrically arranged allowing for separate access to both levels of the building from the street frontage. The upper windows of the facade are timber framed double-hung sashes fitted into round-arched openings supported on pilasters, enframed by larger pilasters. The apron of each upper window is decorated with a relief, intersecting spherical design. The ground level shop fronts are aluminium framed single-paned glass windows, which are enframed by pilasters that have stylised leaf design capitals. Both entrance doors are multi-paned timber framed doors, which are not original. The gabled roof of the {{building is}} hidden from the street by a pediment that is capped with a simple cornice moulding. A large <b>louvred</b> <b>ventilator</b> exists in the rear gable end. Tie rods have been introduced into the facade and suggest previous structural instability. An awning has been unsympathetically attached across {{the width of the}} facade. The south-eastern elevation of the {{building is a}}lso cement rendered but is unpainted and features only an ashlar ruled finish. The other two elevations are face brickwork that has been over painted. The windows on these elevations are part of the original 1860's building fabric, being timber framed, double-hung windows with six panes per sash. Several of the upper level windows have had window mounted air conditioned fitted to them.|$|E
50|$|Early {{fabric that}} survives include the {{majority}} of the perimeter walls which are constructed of English bonded brickwork. These walls have arrised corners to openings and engaged piers in the form of bull nosed brickwork to prevent injury. Several of the original openings in external walls are apparent including the bricked in windows to the Petrie Terrace elevation which correspond and provide evidence of the location of the stalls and loose boxes that were positioned along that elevation. Other elements include the roof structure of substantial timber trusses and large timber framed <b>louvred</b> <b>ventilators</b> to each of the ridges. The timber posts supporting the trusses to the central wing demonstrate where the former stalls and timber partition walls were located.|$|R
50|$|A bitumen {{car park}} set amongst a {{collection}} of ancillary buildings covers much of the area {{to the rear of}} the building. These structures are single storey and constructed of both brickwork and timber with simple gable and hip roof forms. The roofs are clad with corrugated metal sheeting and some include timber <b>louvred</b> ridge <b>ventilators.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{building}} {{closest to}} Gregory Terrace {{is referred to}} as [...] "No.8 The Avenue." [...] Its frontage to Gregory Terrace consists of a face brick wall with rectangular casements of narrow metal <b>louvre</b> <b>ventilators</b> and a large central steel roller door providing access from the street. The gabled roof structure is visible from Gregory Terrace. The gable nearest Alexandria Street is of a different design to the two gables at the rear and possibly constitutes the earliest part of the building, the outer part being an addition. The earliest part of the building most probably dates from the late 1920s. There is evidence of this earlier smaller timber structure in the timber wall separating buildings Nos.8 and 9 that only extends across half the breadth of the current interior space. The rear of this building is clad with metal sheeting with the same casements of narrow metal louvres. The interior is a large space with numerous supporting posts and exposed roof trusses. There are entrances from the rear, the side and front and a through way in the dividing wall between this building and the adjacent Building No.9. Building No.8 is wider than the other buildings.|$|R
50|$|The South Sea Islander Church is a single-storey, timber building, set on {{concrete}} stumps, with a gabled roof clad with corrugated iron. The church is clad externally with chamferboards. <b>Louvred</b> timber <b>ventilators</b> are located {{high in the}} west & east elevations (gable ends). Two sets of casement windows {{are located in the}} north & south elevations (long ends). Each window has a simple, diamond decorative motif in the central panel. There is an entry door and set of timber stairs {{at each end of the}} church in the southern elevation. Ramp access has been recently added to the church.|$|R
50|$|The Flour Mill is {{a complex}} of {{attached}} buildings. The main (former milling) section consist of three floors plus a basement; because of the steep slope, the basement is above ground level at the rear. The mill section is built of load-bearing polychrome brickwork, ornamented with pilasters, arches and string courses. There are pairs of windows on the upper two levels at the front and five windows on each level on the sides. The roof is corrugated galvanised iron with a raised <b>louvred</b> timber <b>ventilator.</b> The basement level extends at the rear and now has an outdoor eating area on top; the brickwork has been built up to form a flat floor for the eating area, but {{the line of the}} original skillion roof is still detectable.|$|R
50|$|The Revival Gothic form {{includes}} a steeply-gabled roof clad in corrugated galvanised iron {{and with a}} timber <b>louvred</b> roof ridge <b>ventilator.</b> The earlier portions of the building are of painted rendered brickwork with projecting buttresses and tall lancet windows. The rear portion is of English bond face brickwork with painted window and door dressings, string courses, gable decoration and buttress cappings. Window sills are of painted sandstone and the plinth to the walls is of painted rendered sandstone.|$|R
5000|$|In 1911 to 1913 {{he planned}} and oversaw the {{building}} of {{the second phase of the}} King's Hall. For this, Palmer had to dig an even bigger hole in October 1912: [...] "many thousands of yards of London Clay" [...] were removed to extend the building into the cliff. The 1904 phase remained as vestibule for the new Hall which was dug into the cliff at its back, or south side. The Hall was intended to accommodate 1,500 people inside, plus an audience of 1,100 above, for the rooftop bandstand. So inside the Hall there were large windows, ceiling roses doubling as natural ventilators, and two large <b>louvred</b> natural <b>ventilators</b> at the corners. The total cost for this phase was Â£6,000, the high price reflecting the excavation work and the new and fashionable use of ferro-concrete.|$|R
50|$|The rolled {{galvanised}} iron roof has five tall chimneys and seven roof ventilators of varied size. The court room roof is raised above both {{the roof of}} the rear and front sections. The separate flat arcade roofing at the half elevation maintains access for light and ventilation through the clerestory windows. The roof is a gable hipped, with <b>ventilator</b> <b>louvres</b> in the gablets and corresponding smaller gablets cap the east and west wings. A small forward projecting gablet proclaims the arched entrance to the rear verandah.|$|R
50|$|The Cooch Behar Palace, {{noted for}} its elegance and grandeur, is a {{property}} of The Mantri's. It is a brick-built double-storey structure in the classical Western style covering an area of 51309 sq ft. The whole structure is 395 ft long and 296 ft wide and is on rests 4 ft above the ground. The Palace is fronted {{on the ground and}} first floors by a series of arcaded verandahs with their piers arranged alternately in single and double rows. At the southern and northern ends, the Palace projects slightly and in the centre is a projected porch providing an entrance to the Durbar Hall. The Hall has an elegantly shaped metal dome which is topped by a cylindrical <b>louvre</b> type <b>ventilator.</b> This is 124 ft high from the ground and is {{in the style of the}} Renaissance architecture. The intros of the dome is carved in stepped patterns and Corinthian columns support the base of the cupola. This adds variegated colours and designs to the entire surface. There are various halls in the palace and rooms that include the Dressing Room, Bed Room, Drawing Room, Dining Hall, Billiard hall, Library, Toshakhana, Ladies Gallery and Vestibules. The articles and precious objects that these rooms and halls used to contain are now lost.|$|R
