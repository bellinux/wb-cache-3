50|$|Portland cement {{is by far}} {{the most}} common type of cement in general use around the world. This cement is made by heating {{limestone}} (calcium carbonate) with other materials (such as clay) to 1450 °C in a kiln, in a process known as calcination, whereby a molecule of carbon dioxide is liberated from the calcium carbonate to form calcium oxide, or quicklime, which then chemically combines with the other materials that have been included in the mix to form calcium silicates and other cementitious compounds. The resulting hard substance, called 'clinker', is then ground with a small amount of gypsum into a powder to make 'ordinary Portland cement', the most commonly used type of cement (often referred to as OPC).Portland cement is a basic ingredient of concrete, mortar and most non-specialty grout.

40|$|Disproportionate {{collapse}} {{occurs when}} the removal of <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> members (one or more columns, or <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> walls) results in localized structural damage which leads to further loss of <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> members and, ultimately, {{to the collapse of}} whole or part of the structure.

The <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> structure is made of reinforced concrete, based on strip and isolated foundation footings, slabs, columns and walls. It is analysed with the programme Tower 7, which utilises the final elements method. Two computational models of the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> structure are built.

Besides the slab, we also include some vertical <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>elements</b> {{above and below the}} slab into the model. To analyse the vertical <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>elements</b> we create a more complex three-dimensional computational model of the whole <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> construction.

Experimental bearing capacity factors are in the range Nc = 14. 3 – 14. 6, which is appreciably higher than existing solutions for vanishingly thin circular plates.

The core of panel consists of a set of corrugated plywood shells that are stiffened with longitudinal and shear stiffness diaphragms which are made of plywood. Both sides of panel consist of flat plywood plate. The free space between panels surfaces are filled with expanded polystyrene foam (EPS). The panel is used as a load bearing construction of wall or slab. As a result of defects and heterogeneity of the panel construction during the exploitation the moisture content of wood at local regions can change significantly. It can produce a significant reduction of load bearing capacity. The moisture content change is modeled as bound water (water content below wood fiber saturation point- FSP) diffusion in wood. Mathematically it is described by Fick`s second law (isothermal case). Data of temperature-moisture seasonality in Riga was used in the calculation. The moisture diffusion depends on initial moisture content of plywood. Stress state and deflection of panel change in time are analyzed.

The experimental work includes geotechnical centrifuge modelling and field tests using three different reduced anchor scales, whereas the numerical work focused on investigating anchor capacity for a rage of geometries, embedment depths and seabed conditions. The experimental work indicates that expected tip embedments are in the range 2 to 3. 3 times the anchor length and depend on the impact velocity, anchor mass and shear strength of the soil. As with other plate anchors, the anchor needs to key before maximum capacity can be mobilised.

40|$|The ostrich is {{a highly}} cursorial bipedal land animal with a {{permanently}} elevated metatarsophalangeal joint supported by only two toes. Although locomotor kinematics in walking and running ostriches have been examined, these studies have been largely limited to above the metatarsophalangeal joint. In this study, kinematic data of all major toe joints were collected from gaits with double support (slow walking) to running during stance period in a semi-natural setup with two selected cooperative ostriches. Statistical {{analyses were conducted to}} investigate the effect of locomotor gait on toe joint kinematics. The MTP 3 and MTP 4 joints exhibit the largest range of motion whereas the first phalangeal joint of the 4 th toe shows the largest motion variability. The interphalangeal joints of the 3 rd and 4 th toes present very similar motion patterns over stance phases of slow walking and running. However, the motion patterns of the MTP 3 and MTP 4 joints and the vertical displacement of the metatarsophalangeal joint are significantly different during running and slow walking. Because of the biomechanical requirements, osctriches are likely to select the inverted pendulum gait at low speeds and the bouncing gait at high speeds to improve movement performance and energy economy. Interestingly, the motions of the MTP 3 and MTP 4 joints are highly synchronized from slow to fast locomotion. This strongly suggests that the 3 rd and 4 th toes really work as an “integrated system” with the 3 rd toe as the main <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>element</b> whilst the 4 th toe as the complementary load sharing element with a primary role to ensure the lateral stability of the permanently elevated metatarsophalangeal joint...|$|E

40|$|A {{dynamically}} embedded {{plate anchor}} (DEPLA) is a rocket or dart shaped anchor that comprises a removable central shaft {{and a set}} of four flukes. Similar to other dynamically installed anchors, the DEPLA penetrates to a target depth in soft seabed sediments by the kinetic energy obtained through free-fall in water and the self-weight of the anchor. In this paper DEPLA performance was assessed through a series of beam centrifuge tests conducted at 200 times earth?s gravity. The results show that the DEPLA exhibits similar behaviour to other dynamically installed anchors during installation, with tip embedments of 1. 6 – 2. 8 times the anchor length. After anchor installation the central shaft of the DEPLA, termed a follower, is retrieved and reused for the next installation, leaving the DEPLA flukes vertically embedded in the soil. The load–displacement response during follower retrieval is of interest, with mobilisation of frictional and bearing resistance occurring at different rates. The load required to extract the DEPLA follower is typically less than three times its dry weight. The vertically embedded DEPLA flukes constitute the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>element</b> as a circular or square plate. The keying and pullout response of this anchor plate is similar to other vertically embedded plate anchors, with an initial stiff response as the anchor begins to rotate, followed by a softer response as the rotation angle increases, and a final stiff response as the effective eccentricity of the padeye reduces and anchor capacity is fully mobilised. For the padeye eccentricity ratios considered (0. 38 – 0. 63 times the plate breadth or diameter), the loss in plate anchor embedment is between 0. 50 and 0. 66 times the corresponding plate breadth or diameter. Finally, the bearing capacity factors determined experimentally are typically in the range 14. 2 – 15. 8 and are higher than numerical solutions for flat circular and square plates. This is considered to be due to the cruciform fluke arrangement which ensures that the failure surface extends {{to the edge of the}} orthogonal flukes and mobilises more soil in the failure mechanism...|$|E

40|$|In 1968 a {{relatively}} small gas exposition on the 18 th floor of the Ronan Point tower building resulted in the partial collapse of the structure. This event highlighted that progress collapse may occur to structures under an accidental loading event. Other events, including {{the bombing of the}} Murrah federal building in 1993 in Oklahoma, have resulted in the common design requirement that a structure be capable of surviving the removal of a <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>element.</b> This approach, {{often referred to as the}} sudden column loss scenario, effectively ignores the cause of the damage and focuses on the structure’s response afterwards. The refinement of the analysis varies, with options to include the nonlinear and dynamic behaviours associated with extreme events, or to use simplified linear and static models with factors included to account for the full behaviour. Previous research into progressive collapse has highlighted that providing ductility in the connections, and avoiding brittle failures, is important in ensuring the structure maintains integrity after a column loss event. However, the majority of this work has been focused on the behaviour of steel and Reinforced Concrete (RC) frame structures. As flat slab construction is a popular method for many structures, due to the flexibility it offers for layouts and its low storey heights, it is an important to consider flat slab behaviour in more detail. Furthermore, slab elements behave differently to frame structures due to the Alternative Load Paths (ALPs) that can develop after a column loss via two-dimensional bending mechanisms. Additionally, punching shear failure is a known issue due to the thin section depths. This work addresses the issue of the response of RC flat slab structures after a sudden column loss. As previous case studies have demonstrated that brittle failures may lead to progressive collapse of such structures, a complete understanding of the response is required. The nonlinear behaviour of a slab structure, due to both material and geometric factors, is investigated to determine the additional capacity available beyond the usual design limits. Additionally, the dynamic factors involved, primarily due to inertial effects, are also considered. To achieve this, experimental and numerical studies were conducted. A series of 1 / 3 scale models of slab substructures were constructed to replicate column loss events. Two types of tests were conducted, a static push down test with a support removed and a sudden dynamic column removal case. Displacements, strains and support reactions were recorded throughout, along with cracking patterns. For the dynamic tests a high speed camera was used to obtain the deflection response in the short time period after removal and to observe the formation of cracks. Comparisons between the two cases allowed determination of the dynamic effects on the response of the system. The experimental programme was then replicated using a Finite Element (FE) model. The results taken from the experimental case were used to validate the material and modelling assumptions made during the numerical simulations. This validated model was finally used to investigate a wider range of variables and assess the response of typical structural arrangements, with particular focus on the nonlinear and dynamic factors involved after a sudden column loss. The experimental and numeral investigations demonstrated that after the loss of a column, flat slab structures can maintain integrity due to a change in the load paths away from the removal location. Although in some cases a large amount of flexural damage to the concrete and reinforcement occurred, such effects did not lead to complete failure. However, during the experimental programme some punching shear failures occurred, usually at the corner column locations. From the numerical analysis, shear forces of over twice the fully supported condition occurred as a result of removing a column, which may exceed the designed capacity. Comparisons between a static and dynamic analysis provides information into a suitable Dynamic Amplification Factor (DAF) for use with simplified modelling approaches. Based on the range of structures considered, the maximum increase in deflections as a result of a sudden removal was 1. 62 times the static case, this is less than the commonly used factor of 2. 0. Additionally, this factor reduces as the nonlinearity increases due to further damage, with a smallest DAF calculated at 1. 39. This factor can be reduced further if the column is not removed instantaneously. Finally, the material strengthening effect, due to high strain rates, was considered with the conclusion that as such effects only make a limited increase in the capacity of the slab and may be conservatively ignored. In conclusion, RC flat slab structures are capable of resisting progressive collapse after the loss of a column. This is primarily due to their ability to develop ALPs. However, while flexural damage is usually fairly minimal, progressive punching shear failure is a critical design condition as it may result in a complete collapse. Furthermore, the inertial effects involved after a sudden removal can increase the damage sustained, although current design methods may be over conservative...|$|E

40|$|The fatigue {{behaviour}} of fibres is {{an important}} knowledge fibres being the main <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>elements</b> in fibre reinforced composites. The fatigue strength of composites largely depends on the fatigue behaviour of fibres. While the static strength of reinforcing fibres has been extensively investigated, {{there are very few}} data available on their fatigue properties. The main reason is the difficulty of conducting fatigue tests on un-impregnated fibres. Scope of this chapter is to provide insight on the fatigue properties of different types of reinforcing fibres, with a focus on the high performance glass and carbon fibres. Moreover, some data on the fatigue behaviour of natural fibres, aramid fibres, optical fibres and steel fibres is mentioned. Experimental characterization methods, as well as modelling approaches for the fatigue strength of single fibres and fibre bundles are addressed...|$|R
