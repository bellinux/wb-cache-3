40|$|This {{document}} {{is the result}} of systematic evaluation and analysis of international best practice (see <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>Supporting</b> <b>Documents)</b> and comprehensive discussion undertaken by a working group of the Irish Council for Bioethics. It is based on requirements for ethical review established in international guidelines and provides guidance on general standards and principles that should be considered by Research Ethics Committees when reviewing research proposals. This guidance is intended to facilitate and support efficient and effective ethical review of proposals. This document should be viewed as a basis upon which Research Ethics Committees can establish and develop their standard operating procedures. Impartial ethical review is designed to maintain ethical standards of practice in research, to protect participants in research and research workers from harm or exploitation, to preserve the subject's rights, including the right to privacy and to provide reassurance to the public that all of this is being done. In promoting these goals Research Ethics Committees should be mindful that appropriately regulated, ethically acceptable, rigorous research benefits society as a whole. The primary task of Research Ethics Committees is the protection of the welfare and the rights of participants in research. Another important role is to facilitate and support the progress that the research community seeks to achieve...|$|E

40|$|In early 1998, the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) {{was asked}} to assist the PROGRESA {{administration}} to “determine if PROGRESA is functioning in practice as {{it is intended to}} by design. ” PROGRESA {{is one of the major}} programs of the Mexican government aimed at developing the human capital of poor households. Targeting its benefits directly to the population in extreme poverty in rural areas, it aims to alleviate current poverty through monetary and in-kind benefits, as well as reduce future levels of poverty by encouraging investments in education, health and nutrition. This document synthesizes the findings contained in a series of reports prepared by IFPRI for PROGRESA between November 1998 and November 2000. A more detailed description of the research, rationale and methods appears in the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>documents</b> from which this document has been derived. The evaluation is based on data collected from seven states that were among the first states to receive PROGRESA, including Guerrero, Hidalgo, Michoacán, Puebla, Querétero, San Luis Potosi, and Veracruz. A total of 24, 000 households from 506 localities in these states were interviewed periodically between November 1997 and November 1999. Focus groups and workshops with beneficiaries, local leaders, PROGRESA officials, health clinic workers, and schoolteachers were also carried out. This report offers some key highlights beginning to emerge from this study related to the impact of PROGRESA on its target group, Mexico’s rural poor.

40|$|In early 1998, the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) {{was asked}} to assist the PROGRESA {{administration}} to “determine if PROGRESA is functioning in practice as {{it is intended to}} by design. ” This document summarizes the findings contained in a series of reports presented by IFPRI to PROGRESA from November 1998 through August 2000. A more detailed description of the research, rationale and methods appears in the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>documents</b> from which this document has been derived. In brief, the findings of IFPRI’s evaluation are that after just three years, the poor children of Mexico in the rural areas where PROGRESA is currently operating are more likely to enroll in school, are eating more diversified diets, getting more frequent health care and learning that the future may look quite different from the past. The majority of the evaluation findings suggest that PROGRESA’s combination of education, health, and nutrition interventions into one integrated package can be an effective means of breaking the intergenerational transmission of poverty. However, PROGRESA is still in its beginning stages. Many of the impacts of the program are likely to manifest themselves in the future. Clearly, the simultaneous intervention in the health and nutrition of 0 to 5 year old children of poor households today will positively reinforce school attendance, performance and attainment of children tomorrow. Thus, in addition to the benefits measured after three years of operation, it is likely that PROGRESA will have additional benefits in future years. Whether the vicious cycle of poverty and its intergenerational transmission are indeed broken can only be determined by continuing with PROGRESA and continuing to evaluate in the medium and long run its impact on the livelihood of Mexico’s poor. The possibility of expanding the coverage of PROGRESA to poor households in urban areas implies that there is opportunity to use program evaluation, such as that presented herein, as a means to adapt some of the components of the program to suit the needs of households in different environments. The IFPRI research team would encourage Mexico’s policy leaders to capitalize on the innovative precedent established by PROGRESA and to consider program evaluation as an indispensable component of all social policies.
