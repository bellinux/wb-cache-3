5|$|The {{reason for}} {{estimating}} the pressure (in lieu of direct measurements) {{is the fact}} that most of these storms did not threaten <b>land.</b> <b>As</b> Kenna and Patricia were threatening land, their pressures were measured by Hurricane Hunters using dropsondes.

5|$|A reoccurring {{theme in}} legend and folktale {{consists}} of a man or, more often, {{a woman who is}} challenged to gain as much <b>land</b> <b>as</b> can be traveled within a limited amount of time.

In six tales from Jutland, Denmark and one from Germany a plough is used similarly as in Livy's account, though the conditions are often met by walking or riding.|$|E

The Aircraft Synthetic Training Aids (ASTA) provided by Thales Training & Simulation was an electronic training suite to allow the training of crew members to transfer from active MRA4 aircraft to ground-based training systems; this change was made to increase the availability of the aircraft for operational missions and allow for more intensive training exercises.|$|E

5|$|All Atlantic Category5 hurricanes {{have made}} {{landfall}} at some location at hurricane strength. Most Category5 hurricanes in the Atlantic make landfall {{because of their}} proximity to land in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, where the usual synoptic weather patterns carry them towards <b>land,</b> <b>as</b> opposed to the westward, oceanic mean track of Eastern Pacific hurricanes. Sixteen of the storms made landfall while at Category5 intensity; 2007 and 2017 are the only years in which two storms made landfall at this intensity.|$|E

The U.S. Army's introduction of aviation to Ford Island triggered expansion throughout Hawaii {{with the development of}} civilian airports, the creation of the Hawaii chapter of the National Aeronautic Association, and a national flying code.

5|$|Because Tropical Depression Ten never {{approached}} <b>land</b> <b>as</b> {{a tropical}} cyclone, no tropical cyclone watches and warnings were issued for any land masses.

The system did not attain tropical storm status; as such, it was not given a name by the National Hurricane Center. The storm partially contributed to the formation of Hurricane Katrina, which became a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale and made landfall in Louisiana, causing catastrophic damage. Katrina was the costliest hurricane, and one of the five deadliest, {{in the history of the}} United States.|$|E
