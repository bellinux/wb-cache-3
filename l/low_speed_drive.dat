Various aspects involved in the design of these generators and their electromagnetic modelling using the finite element simulations are presented. For a detailed study, a 5 kW prototype generator has been designed and constructed based on finite element based simulations. Several experiments were conducted on the prototype generator. The experimental results were compared with the corresponding case simulations on the designed generator.

Furthermore, due to the bad drainage system of the city, water tends to accumulate at the depression areas and inundation occurs. Generally, this inundated water completely blocks the road, resulting in almost zero capacity of that section of the road. This causes an increase in travel time and a decrease in road capacity. This inundation sometimes remains for days, if ponded water is not drained by some external means like pump.|$|R

To meet the most demanding requirements of CNC machine tools, robots and transfer lines in terms of productivity, accuracy and dynamic performance, brushless DC drives are very widely used. These drives employ brushless torque motors which are of high torque, <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> direct <b>drive</b> type.

Range, acceleration ability and grade ability of electric driven small size city vehicle depend on: total vehicle mass, energy storage type and size, vehicle exploitation conditions (motorway, city traffic). Energy storage type and size optimization and full utilization of regenerative braking system leads to significant amount energy saving. Regenerative braking is particularly important in city traffic, {{where a lot of}} acceleration/braking cycles occur. Advanced secondary energy source consist of electrochemical battery and stack of supercapacitors. Using supercapacitors as an additional energy source makes it possible to improve battery life cycle and simultaneously to decrease the exploitation costs of electric vehicle.

40|$|Variable speed {{generators}} {{are used}} for large turbines, as they can extract more energy with attenu-ated structural stresses and acoustic emissions when compared to fixed speed systems. The doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) with a partially rated rotor side converter is currently the main-stream product in the market. But other topologies exist and new ones are being developed with incentives in cost, performance and reliability. For instance, <b>low</b> <b>speed,</b> direct <b>drive</b> generators offer the further benefit of eliminating the gearbox which is undesirable where maintenance of lubrication is difficult. In many direct drive systems fully rated converters are required to control the generator and interface to the grid. 2. Why? It is quite easy to obtain high current rating in a power electronic converter. With respect to that, the cost of high voltage rating can however be prohibitively high and in a low voltage system, high current flows through cables of considerable length inducing significant I 2 R loss. Parallel connection of cables reduces the loss but it increases the initial cost as high current cables are expensive and mechanically stiff. Moreover, in order to minimise the component cost, wind farm developers often use step-up transformers that are marginally rated. Reliability of the whole system is reduced...|$|R
40|$|For high {{performance}} drive applications, {{the accuracy of}} speed estimation from a digital shaft encoder is reduced in the <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> range. <b>Drive</b> performance can be further impaired at <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> when <b>low</b> cost low-resolution digital encoders are used. This thesis contributes {{to the development of}} a quasi-sensorless solution for AC induction motor drives, where instead of a conventional position sensor and MH" or closed loop observer, an artificial intelligence based 64 PPR SKF sensor bearing is proposed. Furthermore, the performance of speed-controlled IM drives is sensitive to rotor time constant mismatch. A newly developed closed loop RMLE-GNA observer is proposed as a new adaption mechanism with a Model Reference Adaptive Scheme for rotor flux estimation and on-fine rotor time constant adaptation. For {{high performance}} sensorless <b>speed</b> controlled IM <b>drive</b> applications, the IM is required to operate at <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> in all four-quadrants in a stable manner whilst maintaining constant air-gap flux and torque. Such <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> operation fails with conventional open loop observers and MRAS, and closed loop observers such as EKF suffer from a tuning problem and extensive computing time. Parameter uncertainty is a further factor limiting drive performance. A new joint state estimation and parameter adaptation closed loop Recursive Maximum Likelihood Estimator with an iterative Gauss Newton Raphson Algorithm (RMLE-GNA) is developed for the sensorless speed estimation and on-line parameter adaptation of IM drives. Two case studies are presented: correct and stable convergence of the closed loop observer within two iteration local loops utilising a full order IM model, and correct and stable convergence within a single iteration local loop utilising a simplified full order IM model. In both cases it is shown that the closed loop observer can provide satisfactory and stable convergence for 4 -quadrant operation. Of particular interest are the correct convergence, robustness against parameter mismatch and the stability of the sensorless <b>speed</b> controlled IM <b>drive</b> at zero <b>speed</b> and zero stator flux frequency. Thus, a small signal transfer function of the closed loop observer with the sensorless speed vector controlled IM drives is derived. The stability analysis shows the robustness and the convergence of the observer for 4 -quadrant operation for high and low speed' and up to the rated load torque. The effect of various machine model parameters on the stability and convergence of the RMLE-GNA-based sensorless drive system is investigated, providing an insight into the inherent dynamic characteristics of the proposed closed loop observer-based sensorless speed-controlled IM drives.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> sensorless control techniques for low voltage permanent magnet motor drives. The specific application of these drives is for power steering in small to medium sized cars. The focus of the project {{is to create a}} <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> sensorless <b>drive</b> with minimum current distortion, such that any additional torque ripple or audible noise is acceptable for the steering application. A comparison of two sensorless control methods is made, in terms of their benefits and drawbacks. The first method uses a measurement of the motor current derivative in response to the normally applied PWM switching vectors, to obtain a position estimate. The second method uses the high frequency current response to an injected high frequency voltage in the d-axis of the machine. Both methods track the variation of inductance in the machine due to local saturation as the machine rotates. The quality of the position estimate, current distortion and audible noise generated by the methods are investigated and compared. Experimental results show that the position quality of the current derivative method is better and is quieter than the d-axis method. However it produces a larger current distortion compared to the d-axis method. The d-axis method requires a large injection voltage (10 % of rated) to be applied due to the poor quality of the estimated position signal below this voltage. For the current derivative method it was found experimentally that increas- ing the vector extension time (tmin) up to 1 OJ. L 3 gave an improved position es- timation performance. at the cost of increased current distortion and audible noise. For the d-axis method increasing the injection frequency from 1. 5 kHz to 2 kHz causes a decrease in position estimation quality, an increase in audible noise but a decrease in current distortion.

40|$|A {{conceptual}} design methodology was produced and subsequently coded into a Visual C++ (GUI) environment {{to facilitate the}} rapid comparison of several possible configurations to satisfy High Altitude Long Endurance (FIALE) unmanned aircraft (UAV) missions in the <b>Low</b> <b>Speed</b> (propeller <b>driven</b> aircraft) regime. Several comparative studies were performed to verify the applicability of traditional design methods. The traditional computational design methodologies fail in several areas such as high aspect ratio wing weight estimation and design, low Reynolds number wing design, high altitude engine performance, low Reynolds number drag estimation, unmanned aircraft design, and the {{conceptual design}} of unconventional configurations. The methodology developed for this thesis was robust enough to allow not only for consideration of these areas of inadequacy in traditional methods, but also {{to allow for the}} inclusion of advancements in the relevant technologies as they become more widely available. The following configurations were evaluated for suitability to the <b>Low</b> <b>Speed</b> HALE UAV application: conventional, canard, twin boom, multiple fuselage (conventional or canard), tandem wing, multiple fuselage tandem wing or flying wing configuration. The configurations were compared on the basis of aircraft endurance for takeoff weights ranging from 2, 000 to 20, 000 pounds and wing loadings ranging from 5 to 25 lbs 1 fe. Initial drag estimates were made using traditional parabolic drag estimation techniques. A more refined drag buildup was performed using a vortex lattice drag estimation for the lift induced drag (for all lifting components) and calculated skin friction coefficients for the parasite drag. Statistically based methods were used for other components of drag having much smaller contributions. In addition, a statistical approach was taken to the weight estimation of the major aircraft components. However, this approach made comparison of alternative configurations more difficult. Thus wing bending moments trends were evaluated and utilized in the development of weight saving values for multiple fuselage wing weight estimation. The comparative performance of each configuration is justified with direct reference to the terms in the Breguet Endurance equation. Validation was performed where possible on all modules and segments associated with the methodology, {{as well as for the}} macroscopic results. In addition, parametric studies on endurance were performed for the conventional configuration for geometric characteristics and operating conditions directly and indirectly effecting the calculated endurance and generalized results presented. Finally, a case study was performed to demonstrate this capability. A new relation was developed for aircraft empty weight prediction, a <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> airfoil figure of merit was proposed, and new constants were offered for UAV fuselage length prediction. In addition, horizontal and vertical tail volume coefficients were proposed for all of the <b>Low</b> <b>Speed</b> HALE UAV configurations considered.
