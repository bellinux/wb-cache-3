25|$|Liquid metal cooled reactor. Since {{water is}} a moderator, it cannot {{be used as a}} coolant in a fast reactor. Liquid metal {{coolants}} have included sodium, NaK, lead, <b>lead-bismuth</b> eutectic, and in early reactors, mercury.|$|E
25|$|Two other lead-cooled fast {{reactors}} {{under development}} are the SVBR-100, a modular 100 MWe <b>lead-bismuth</b> cooled {{fast neutron reactor}} concept designed by OKB Gidropress in Russia and the BREST-OD-300 (Lead-cooled fast reactor) 300 MWe, to be developed after the SVBR-100, and built over 2016-20, it will dispense with the fertile blanket around the core and will supersede the sodium cooled BN-600 reactor design, to purportedly give enhanced proliferation resistance.|$|E
25|$|Using lead as {{the liquid}} metal {{provides}} excellent radiation shielding, {{and allows for}} operation at very high temperatures. Also, lead is (mostly) transparent to neutrons, so fewer neutrons are lost in the coolant, and the coolant does not become radioactive. Unlike sodium, lead is mostly inert, so there is less risk of explosion or accident, but such large quantities of lead may be problematic from toxicology and disposal points of view. Often a reactor of this type would use a <b>lead-bismuth</b> eutectic mixture. In this case, the bismuth would present some minor radiation problems, as it {{is not quite as}} transparent to neutrons, and can be transmuted to a radioactive isotope more readily than lead. The Russian Alfa class submarine uses a lead-bismuth-cooled fast reactor as its main power plant.|$|E
25|$|The {{fracture}} filling of diamond {{is often}} the last {{step in the process}} of diamond enhancement, following laser drilling and acid-etching of inclusions, though if the fractures are surface-reaching, no drilling may be required. This process, which involves the use of specially-formulated solutions with a refractive index approximating that of diamond, was pioneered by Zvi Yehuda of Ramat Gan, Israel. Yehuda is now used as a brand name applied to diamonds treated in this manner. Koss & Schechter, another Israel-based firm, attempted to modify Yehuda's process in the 1990s by using halogen-based glasses, but this was unsuccessful. The details behind the Yehuda process have been kept secret, but the filler used is reported to be lead oxychloride glass, which has a fairly low melting point. The New York-based Dialase also treats diamonds via a Yehuda-based process, which is believed to use <b>lead-bismuth</b> oxychloride glass, but research into creating better, more durable, less traceable solutions is still being done, creating more silicone based solutions for the fracture filling process.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lead-bismuth</b> {{produces}} {{a considerable amount}} of polonium, a highly radioactive and quite mobile element. This can complicate maintenance and pose a plant contamination problem. Lead produces orders of magnitudes less polonium, and so has an advantage over <b>lead-bismuth</b> in this regard.|$|E

5000|$|The Soviet [...] K-27 and {{all seven}} s used {{reactors}} cooled by a <b>lead-bismuth</b> alloy (VT-1 reactors in K-27; BM-40A and OK-550 reactors in others). Both the Soviet and US navies had earlier constructed prototype attack submarines using LMFR power units.|$|E
5000|$|A {{joint venture}} called AKME Engineering was {{announced}} on 25 December 2009 between Rosatom and En+ Group, {{to develop a}} commercial <b>lead-bismuth</b> reactor. The SVBR-100 ('Svintsovo-Vismutovyi Bystryi Reaktor' - <b>lead-bismuth</b> fast reactor) {{is based on the}} Alfa designs and will produce 100MWe electricity from gross thermal power of 280MWt, about twice that of the submarine reactors. They can also be used in groups of up to 16 if more power is required. [...] The coolant increases from 345 C to 495 C as it goes through the core. Uranium oxide enriched to 16.5% U-235 could be used as fuel, and refuelling would be required every 7-8 years. A prototype is planned for 2017.|$|E

50|$|Fast {{reactors}} have a {{high power}} density and do not need neutron moderation. Most have been liquid metal cooled reactors using molten sodium. Lead, <b>lead-bismuth</b> eutectic, and other metals have also been proposed and occasionally used. Mercury {{was used in the}} first fast reactor.|$|E
50|$|Hyperion {{plans to}} use natural {{circulation}} of the <b>lead-bismuth</b> coolant through the reactor module {{as a means of}} primary cooling. Coolant temperatures within the primary loop should be approximately 500 C. Powered intermediate heat exchangers, also using <b>lead-bismuth</b> coolant, are located within the reactor and run an intermediate loop going to a third ex-reactor heat exchanger (the steam generator), where heat is transferred to the working fluid, heating it to approximately 480 C. Two schemes of power generation exist at this point: either using superheated steam or supercritical carbon dioxide to drive Rankine cycle or Brayton cycle turbines. In addition to the classical use of power generation, further uses for the heated working fluid can include desalinization, process heat, and district heating and cooling.|$|E
50|$|The thermal {{hydraulics}} of the <b>lead-bismuth</b> reactor are {{dictated by}} the high heat capacity and unique properties of the <b>lead-bismuth</b> eutectic coolant. This coolant has several extremely beneficial properties for a reactor: it is opaque to gamma radiation, but transparent to neutron flux; it melts easily at a low temperature, but does not boil until an extremely high temperature is reached; it does not greatly expand or contract when exposed to heat or cold; it has a high heat capacity; it will naturally circulate through the reactor core without pumps being required - whether during normal operation or {{as a means of}} residual decay heat removal; and it will solidify once decay heat from a used reactor has dropped to a low level.|$|E
5000|$|The Russians are the {{acknowledged}} {{experts in}} <b>lead-bismuth</b> cooled reactors, with EDO [...] "Gidropress" [...] (the Russian developers of the VVER-type LWRs) having special expertise in their development. The SVBR-75/100, a modern design of this type, {{is one example}} of the extensive Russian experience with this technology.|$|E
50|$|A {{compound}} analyzed as lead carbide PbC2 {{has also}} been obtained accidentally, as a thin layer (about 10 μm thick) on the inner wall of a graphite crucible {{that had been used}} to heat a <b>lead-bismuth</b> eutectic alloy for 100 hours at 1073 K in a helium atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|K-27 was {{the only}} {{submarine}} of Project 645 in the Soviet Navy. Project 645 was not assigned a NATO reporting name. That project produced one test model nuclear submarine, which incorporated a pair of experimental VT-1 nuclear reactors that used a liquid-metal coolant (<b>Lead-bismuth</b> eutectic), placed into the modified hull of a November class submarine (Project 627A).|$|E
50|$|Even though 1960s {{technology}} was barely sufficient to produce reliable LCFRs, which are even today considered challenging, their advantages were considered compelling. Two power plants were developed independently, BM-40A by OKB Gidropress (Hydropress) in Leningrad and OK-550 by the OKBM design bureau in Nizhniy Novgorod, both using a eutectic <b>lead-bismuth</b> {{solution for the}} primary cooling stage, and both producing 155 MW of power.|$|E
50|$|In a {{fast reactor}} the fission product poison {{situation}} may differ significantly because neutron {{absorption cross sections}} can differ for thermal neutrons and fast neutrons. In the RBEC-M <b>Lead-Bismuth</b> Cooled Fast Reactor, the fission products with neutron capture more than 5% of total fission products capture are, in order, 133Cs, 101Ru, 103Rh, 99Tc, 105Pd and 107Pd in the core, with 149Sm replacing 107Pd for 6th place in the breeding blanket.|$|E
50|$|Molten lead or <b>lead-bismuth</b> {{eutectic}} {{can be used}} as {{the primary}} coolant in a nuclear reactor, because lead and bismuth have low neutron absorption and relatively low melting points. Neutrons are slowed less by interaction with these heavy nuclei, (thus not being neutron moderators) and therefore help make this type of reactor a fast-neutron reactor. The coolant does however serve as a neutron reflector, returning some escaping neutrons to the core.|$|E
