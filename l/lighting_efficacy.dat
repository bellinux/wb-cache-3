The reliability of LED is dependent on its junction temperature. This study confers on the thermal and stress characterization of LED chip with copper cylindrical heat slug through simulation method. The simulation characterization was carried out with Ansys version 11 at ambient temperature of 25 °C under natural convection condition. The LED package was powered with input powers of 0. 1 W, 0. 5 W and 1 W. Results indicated that input power influences the junction temperature and stress of LED chip...|$|E
40|$|Power-electronics {{interface}} and {{the technique}} of pulsewidth modulation have been the heart of controlling the illumination intensity of lighting devices. It is, however, observed that for some lighting devices, {{the use of such}} a methodology leads to a lower energy-conversion efficiency (with a lower light intensity for the same amount of electrical input power) than potentially possible. The main problem is related to the saturable characteristic of the electrical-to-optical energy conversion, which follows that of an exponential characteristic, and the fast nature of this reaction in these lighting devices. This paper presents an in-depth discussion on the phenomenon and offers a solution to the problem. Specifically, it is proposed that an n -level type of driving approach to be adopted in the design and construction of power-electronic drivers for fast-response saturable lighting devices to achieve a quasi-optimal <b>lighting</b> <b>efficacy.</b> The result is energy saving for the same required light illumination. Theoretical proofs and experimental results are provided for verification. The topic of discussion in this paper and the proposed approach are not only applicable to the area of electronic circuits and lighting devices, but also to general controlled systems which comprise components that inherit a saturable and fast-reactive energy conversion characteristic. © 2010 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Lighting {{designs for}} {{architectural}} (aesthetic) purposes, vision and safety, and plant growth {{have many features}} in common but several crucial ones that are not. The human eye is very sensitive to the color (wavelength) of light, whereas plants are less so. There are morphological reactions, particularly to the red and blue portions of the light spectrum but, in general, plants appear to accept and use light for photosynthesis everywhere over the PAR region of the spectrum. In contrast, the human eye interprets light intensity on a logarithmic scale, making people insensitive to significant differences of light intensity. As a rough rule, light intensity must change by 30 to 50 % for the human eye to recognize the difference. Plants respond much more linearly to light energy, at least at intensities below photosynthetic saturation. Thus, intensity differences not noticeable to the human eye can have significant effects on total plant growth and yield, and crop timing. These factors make luminaire selection and lighting system design particularly important when designing supplemental lighting systems for plant growth. Supplemental lighting for plant growth {{on the scale of}} commercial greenhouses is a relatively expensive undertaking. Light intensities are often much higher than required for task (vision) lighting, which increases both installation and operating costs. However, and especially in the northern regions of the United States (and Canada, Europe, etc.), supplemental lighting during winter may be necessary to produce certain crops (e. g., tomatoes) and very useful to achieve full plant growth potential and crop timing with most other greenhouse crops. Operating costs over the life of a luminaire typically will exceed the initial investment, making <b>lighting</b> <b>efficacy</b> a major consideration. This report reviews tests completed to evaluate the efficiencies of various commercially-available High-Pressure Sodium luminaires, and then describes the results of using a commercial lighting design computer program, Lumen-Micro, to explore how to place luminaires within greenhouses and plant growth chambers to achieve light (PAR) uniformity and relatively high lighting efficacies. Several suggestions are presented which could encourage systematic design of plant lighting systems...|$|E

We examined whether ophthalmic dysfunction explains unique variance in melatonin excretion {{of older adults}} {{over and above the}} variance explained by daily illumination, medical, and sociodemographic factors. We also examined whether ophthalmic dysfunction influences relationships between ambient illumination and melatonin. Methods Thirty older adults (mean age = 69 years; Blacks = 42 % and Whites = 58 %) of both genders participated in the study. Demographic and health data were collected at baseline. Participants underwent eye exams at SUNY Downstate Medical Center, wore an actigraph to monitor illumination and sleep, and collected urine specimens to estimate aMT 6 s concentrations. Results Hierarchical regression analysis showed that illumination factors explained 29 % of the variance in aMT 6 s mesor. The proportion of variance explained by ophthalmic factors, sleep duration, and race was 10 %, 2 %, and 2 %, respectively. Illumination factors explained 19 % of the variance in aMT 6 s acrophase. The proportion of variance explained by ophthalmic factors, sleep duration, and race was 11 %; 17 %; and 2 %, respectively. Controlling for sleep duration and race reduced the correlations between illumination and melatonin, whereas controlling for ophthalmic factors did not. Conclusion Ophthalmic exams showed that elevated intraocular pressure and large cup-to-disk ratios were independently associated with earlier melatonin timing. Lower illumination exposure also had independent associations with earlier melatonin timing. Conceivably, ophthalmic and illumination factors might have an additive effect on the timing of melatonin excretion, which in turn might predispose individuals to experience early morning awakenings. </p...|$|R

Forty-eight volunteers were randomly divided either a HP 6 or HP 35. Two clinical sessions were performed with an interval of 7 days between them for each group. In each session, two consecutive applications of each bleaching agent were performed and activated by a hybrid LED/laser <b>light.</b> <b>Efficacy</b> was determined by color alteration (Delta E), recorded with reflectance spectroscopy. It was assessed at baseline and after {{the first and second}} bleaching session. TS was characterized according to occurrence, intensity, duration, and type. Efficacy was analyzed by repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc Bonferroni test, and TS was analyzed by means of chi(2) test (alpha = 0. 05). For HP 35, highest and significant values of Delta E were found after bleaching when compared to HP 6 (p = 0. 002). However, HP 35 showed a significantly higher occurrence of TS than HP 6 (p = 0. 008). Also, intensity and duration were higher in HP 35. The majority of volunteers classified the type experienced in their sensitivity {{in the form of a}} "shock. " The use of HP 6 despite reducing efficacy when compared to an in-office bleaching in higher concentration (35 %) produced less tooth sensitivity.
