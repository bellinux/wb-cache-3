2500|$|Cortical {{stimulation}} mapping {{in patients}} with epilepsy has shown that critical language {{areas of the brain}} vary greatly in patients, highlighting the need to perform accurate mapping prior to surgeries in language areas. Traditional landmarks such as Broca's and Wernicke's areas cannot be relied on to distinguish essential <b>language</b> <b>cortex.</b> Rather, experiments that have tested for vital language sites are variable, and the exact role of a specific cortex area in a language task is difficult to judge. A further complication is that many patients who have undergone language mapping have epilepsy and it is possible this causes changes in language sites. Since the procedure is so invasive, cortical stimulation mapping for language organization is not done on healthy individuals. [...] Additionally the distribution and abundance of specific task-related language sites have shown variation based on IQ and gender.|$|E

40|$|Purpose and Background: Inter-gender {{cortical}} {{and functional}} asymmetry {{is an ongoing}} topic of investigation. In the current study, we investigated auditory and language cortical activation patterns in the dominant hemisphere to text listening under changing levels of background acoustic scanner noise in normal hearing male and female subjects. Materials & Methods: Echo-planar functional MRI (1. 5 T) was performed on 12 healthy right-handed subjects (6 males, 6 females). Passive text listening tasks were employed under two different background acoustic scanner noise conditions (12 slices/ 2 sec TR (6 Hz) and 4 slices/ 2 sec TR (2 Hz)), with the first 4 slices in identical locations in the left hemisphere. Cross correlation {{analysis was used to}} construct activation maps in subregions of auditory and <b>language</b> relevant <b>cortex</b> of the dominant (left) hemisphere, and activation areas were calculated using coefficient thresholds of 0. 5, 0. 6, and 0. 7.

These studies have sparked an interest in applying some of the paradigms to various clinically relevant questions, such as {{the identification of the}} cortical regions mediating language function in surgical candidates for refractory epilepsy. Here we present data from a group of adult control participants in order to investigate the potential of using frequency specific spectral power changes in MEG activation patterns to establish lateralisation of language function using expressive language tasks. In addition, we report on a paediatric patient whose language function was assessed before and after a left hemisphere amygdalo-hippocampectomy. Our verb generation task produced left hemisphere decreases in beta-band power accompanied by right hemisphere increases in low beta-band power in the majority of the control group, a previously unreported phenomenon. This pattern of spectral power was also found in the patient's post-surgery data, though not her pre-surgery data. Comparison of pre and post-operative results also provided some evidence of reorganisation in <b>language</b> related <b>cortex</b> both inter- and intra-hemispherically following surgery. The differences were not limited to changes in localisation of <b>language</b> specific <b>cortex</b> but also changes in the spectral and temporal profile of frontal brain regions during verb generation.

40|$|RATIONALE: The intracarotid {{amobarbital}} procedure (IAP) {{has historically}} been {{the gold standard for}} lateralization in language function. Localization of <b>language</b> <b>cortex</b> has previously been performed through cortical stimulation studies and more recently with functional neuroimaging procedures. Good concordance has been reported in lateralizing language. Systematic comparison of techniques that localize <b>language</b> <b>cortex</b> has been limited. The current study reports our preliminary experience comparing fMRI, magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electrocortical stimulation in patients with language dominance established by IAP. METHODS: The subjects were 13 patients who were candidates for epilepsy surgery (8 M; 5 F). Ages ranged from 7 to 47 yrs. Eleven patients were right-handed, one was left-handed and one was ambidextrous. Eleven of the patients were left-hemisphere dominant by IAP and two were undetermined.

Results: (i) Heschl’s gyrus and planum polare showed typical hemisphere asymmetry patterns; (ii) posterior Superior Temporal Gyrus (pSTG) showed significant rightward asymmetry; and (iii) PT showed a trend for rightward asymmetry that was significant when constrained to right-handed boys (n[*]=[*] 30). For right-handed boys, symmetry indices for pSTG were significantly positively correlated with those for PT. PT asymmetry was age dependent, with greater rightward asymmetry with age. Conclusions: results provide evidence for rightward asymmetry in auditory association areas (pSTG and PT) known to subserve language processing. Cumulatively, our data provide evidence for a differing maturational path for PT for lower functioning children with AD, with both pre- and post-natal experience likely {{playing a role in}} PT asymmetry...|$|E

40|$|Speech {{perception}} {{requires the}} rapid and effortless extraction of meaningful phonetic {{information from a}} highly variable acoustic signal. A powerful example of this phenomenon is categorical speech perception, in which a continuum of acoustically varying sounds is transformed into perceptually distinct phoneme categories. We found that the neural representation of speech sounds is categorically organized in the human posterior superior temporal gyrus. Using intracranial high-density cortical surface arrays, we found that listening to synthesized speech stimuli varying in small and acoustically equal steps evoked distinct and invariant cortical population response patterns that were organized by their sensitivities to critical acoustic features. Phonetic category boundaries were similar between neurometric and psychometric functions. Although speech-sound responses were distributed, spatially discrete cortical loci were found to underlie specific phonetic discrimination.

The patient presented here experienced new-onset seizures {{caused by a}} medium-grade tumor in very close proximity to expressive language regions.

Our results demonstrate that intraoperative mapping using high-resolution ECoG is feasible and, within minutes, produces results that are qualitatively concordant to those achieved by extraoperative mapping modalities. They also suggest that functional language mapping of expressive language areas with ECoG may prove useful in many intraoperative conditions given its time efficiency and safety. Finally, they demonstrate that integration of results from multiple functional mapping techniques, both intraoperative and extraoperative, may serve to improve the confidence in or precision of functional localization when pathology encroaches upon eloquent <b>language</b> <b>cortex...</b>|$|E

Specific language impairment (SLI) and autism share similar language deficits and may share genetic links. This study evaluated asymmetry of frontal <b>language</b> <b>cortex</b> in a new, independent sample of right-handed boys, including a new sample of boys with autism {{and a group of}} boys with SLI. The boys with autism were divided into those with language impairment (ALI) and those with normal language ability (ALN). Subjects (right-handed, aged 6. 2 - 13. 4 years) included 22 boys with autism (16 ALI and 6 ALN), 9 boys with a history of or present SLI, and 11 normal controls. MRI brain scans were segmented into grey and white matter; then the cerebral cortex was parcellated into 48 gyral-based divisions per hemisphere. Group differences in volumetric asymmetry were predicted a priori in language-related regions in inferior lateral frontal (Broca 2 ̆ 7 s area) and posterior superior temporal cortex. Language impaired boys with autism and SLI both had significant reversal of asymmetry in frontal language-related cortex; larger on the right side in both groups of language impaired boys and larger on the left in both unimpaired language groups, strengthening a phenotypic link between ALI and SLI. Thus, we replicated the observation of reversed asymmetry in frontal <b>language</b> <b>cortex</b> reported previously in an independent autism sample, and observed similar reversal in boys with SLI, further strengthening a phenotypic link between SLI and a subgroup of autism. Linguistically unimpaired boys with autism had similar asymmetry compared with the control group, suggesting that Broca 2 ̆ 7 s area asymmetry reversal is related more to language impairment than specifically to autism diagnosis...|$|E

40|$|Humans are {{especially}} good at taking another’s perspective — representing what others might be thinking or experiencing. This “mentalizing” capacity {{is apparent in}} everyday human interactions and conversations. We investigated its neural basis using magnetoencephalography. We focused on whether mentalizing was engaged spontaneously and routinely to understand an utterance’s meaning or largely on-demand, to restore "common ground" when expectations were violated. Participants conversed with 1 of 2 confederate speakers and established tacit agreements about objects’ names. In a subsequent “test” phase, some of these agreements were violated by either the same or a different speaker. Our analysis of the neural processing of test phase utterances revealed recruitment of neural circuits associated with <b>language</b> (temporal <b>cortex),</b> episodic memory (e. g., medial temporal lobe), and mentalizing (temporo-parietal junction and ventro-medial prefrontal cortex). Theta oscillations (3 - 7 Hz) were modulated most prominently, and we observed phase coupling between functionally distinct neural circuits. The episodic memory and language circuits were recruited in anticipation of upcoming referring expressions, suggesting that context-sensitive predictions were spontaneously generated. In contrast, the mentalizing areas were recruited on-demand, {{as a means for}} detecting and resolving perceived pragmatic anomalies, with little evidence they were activated to make partner-specific predictions about upcoming linguistic utterances...|$|R

40|$|Introduction The {{posterior}} temporal {{region is}} {{generally considered to be}} the "eloquent cortex" containing the primary auditory cortex and a receptive language center (Wernicke's area). Functional monitoring or neurosurgical navigation for this area has not been established although somatosensory evoked magnetic fields (SEFs) have been already used to identify the central sulcus in the Rolandic region [1, 2]. Since major deflections at about 20 msec after the stimulus (N 20) in somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) are quite stable under general anesthesia, they have been commonly used for the intraoperative functional mapping of the primary somatosensory cortex. Since the primary auditory cortex commonly locates near the sensory <b>language</b> <b>cortex</b> in the dominant hemisphere, a localization of the cortical auditory function would be useful for monitoring the language functions of the temporal lobe.

While functional imaging {{studies have suggested}} the association of certain patterns of brain activity with sub-syndromes or single symptoms (e. g. positive symptoms like hallucinations), there has been only limited evidence from structural imaging or post mortem studies. In this study, we investigated the relation of local brain structural deficits to severity of auditory hallucinations, particularly in perisylvian areas previously reported {{to be involved in}} auditory hallucinations. In order to overcome certain limitations of conventional volumetric methods, we used deformation-based morphometry (DBM), a novel automated whole-brain morphometric technique, to assess local gray and white matter deficits in structural magnetic resonance images of 85 schizophrenia patients. We found severity of auditory hallucinations to be significantly correlated (p< 0. 001) with volume loss in the left transverse temporal gyrus of Heschl (primary auditory cortex) and left (inferior) supramarginal gyrus, as well as middle/inferior right prefrontal gyri.

40|$|This {{special issue}} of Cortex focuses on the {{relative}} contribution of different neural networks to memory and the interaction of 'core' memory processes with other cognitive processes. In this article, we examine both.

This approach forces a consideration of the roles of brain regions outside of the frontal, medial-temporal, and diencephalic regions that form a central part of neurobiological theories of memory. Certain kinds of damage to visual cortex or lateral temporal cortex produced impairments of visual imagery or semantic memory; these patterns of impairment are associated with a unique pattern of amnesia that was distinctly different from the pattern associated with medial-temporal trauma. On the other hand, damage to <b>language</b> regions, auditory <b>cortex,</b> or parietal cortex produced impairments of language, auditory imagery, or spatial imagery; however, these impairments were not associated with amnesia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Simultaneous EEG-fMRI was acquired at 7 T using an optimized setup in nine patients with lesional epilepsy. According to the localization of the lesion, mapping of eloquent <b>cortex</b> (<b>language</b> and motor) was also performed in two patients. RESULTS: Despite strong artifacts, efficient correction of intra-MRI EEG could be achieved with optimized artifact removal algorithms, allowing robust identification of interictal epileptiform discharges. Noise-sensitive topography-related analyses and electrical source localization were also performed successfully. Localization of epilepsy-related hemodynamic changes compatible with the lesion were detected in three patients and concordant with findings obtained at 3 T. Local loss of signal in specific regions, essentially due to B 1 inhomogeneities were found to depend on the geometric arrangement of EEG leads over the cap.

40|$|The syntax {{of human}} {{language}} is a recursive, generative system. Both of these properties are ubiquitous in the natural world.

According to Mosterín, the nature of our species Homo sapiens is the information genetically transmitted and present in the human genome (in the genetic pool).

Methods: A total of 70 patients with acute cerebral infarction (ACI) and motor aphasia who were admitted in our hospital from March, 2015 to March, 2016 {{were included in the}} study and randomized into the observation group and the control group, 35 in each group. The patients in the control group were given blood pressure reduction, intracranial pressure reduction, blood lipid regulation, anti-platelet aggregation, symptomatic and supportive treatments, edaravone (30 mg) + normal saline (100 mL), ivdrip, 2 times/d, continuously for 2 weeks. On this basis, the patients in the observation group were given additional rTMS, continuously for 10 d. Hs-CRP, IL- 6, IL- 8, and TNF-α levels before treatment, 1 week and 2 weeks after treatment in the two groups were detected. MRS was used to detect NAA and Cho in Broca district before treatment, 1 week and 2 weeks after treatment in the two groups. ABC was used to evaluate the linguistic function before treatment, 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months in the two groups. Results: Hs-CRP, IL- 6, IL- 8, and TNF-α levels 1 week and 2 weeks after treatment in the observation group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P< 0. 05). NAA value on the left side 1 week and 2 weeks after treatment in the observation group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P< 0. 05), while Cho value was significantly lower than that in the control group (P< 0. 05). ABC score 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after treatment in the observation group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P< 0. 05). Conclusions: Edaravone in combined with low-rTMS in the treatment of ACI can effectively inhibit the inflammatory reaction, improve the neurological deficit degree, and promote the recovery of <b>cortex</b> <b>language</b> neural network...|$|R

After surgical placement of subdural grid and/or strip EEG electrodes (Figure 1), patients return to the EMU for VEEG monitoring to identify the epileptogenic zone. Provocative procedures and medication reduction can also be employed. Provocative procedures are different at this phase. Cortical mapping of eloquent <b>cortex</b> (<b>language,</b> motor, sensory, visual, etc.) and brain stimulation are common procedures performed in the EMU. 8 Cortical mapping is accomplished utilizing direct current to the brain while the physician observes the patient for a clinical change. Verbal language and memory testing {{can be carried out}} at this time. Cortical stimulation utilizing direct electrical current to the brain can facilitate localization of the epileptogenic focus. Once the epileptogenic zone is identified and necessary mapping of eloquent cortex has been completed, patients return to the operating room for electrode removal and resection of the epileptogenic zone (Figure 2). 6 Physicians frequently evaluate patients with paroxysmal non-epileptic spells. The differential diagnosis of these spells is summarized in Table 1. Common etiologies include syncope, staring, pseudoseizures, paroxysmal dyskinesias and sleep-related events. 4, 7 These diagnoses sometimes prove elusive, requiring either videorecording by the parents of events or formal EEG evaluation. Patients suffering recurrent episodes are often admitted for VEEG to determine if they are experiencing epileptic or non-epileptic spells. Such patients represent 15 to 20 percent of EMU admissions. A confounding finding is that 19 to 80 percent of patients with non-epileptic events may also have epileptic events. 4, 9 Evaluation of such children and adolescents in an EMU usually results in a correct diagnosis, eliminating unnecessary use of anti-epileptic medications. The EMU is therefore {{an integral part of the}} comprehensive evaluation of patients with epilepsy and patients experiencing recurrent spells of undetermined origin...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: A {{review of}} all {{published}} evidence for mapping eloquent (motor, <b>language</b> and memory) <b>cortex</b> using advanced functional neuroimaging (functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} [fMRI] and magnetoencephalography [MEG]) for paediatric epilepsy surgery candidates has not been conducted previously. Research in this area has predominantly been in adult populations and applicability of these techniques to paediatric populations is less established. Methods: A review was performed using an advanced systematic search and retrieval of all published papers examining the use of functional neuroimaging for paediatric epilepsy surgery candidates. Results: Of the 2, 724 papers retrieved, 34 met the inclusion criteria. Total paediatric participants identified were 353 with an age range of 5 months- 19 years. Sample sizes and comparisons with alternative investigations to validate techniques are small and variable paradigms are used. Sensitivity 0. 72 (95 % CI 0. 52 - 0. 86) and specificity 0. 60 (95 % CI 0. 35 - 0. 92) values with a Positive Predictive Value of 74 % (95 % CI 61 - 87) and a Negative Predictive Value of 65 % (95 % CI 52 - 78) for fMRI language lateralisation with validation, were obtained. Retrieved studies indicate evidence that both fMRI and MEG are able to provide information lateralising and localising motor and language functions. Conclusions: A striking finding of the review is the paucity of studies (n = 34) focusing on the paediatric epilepsy surgery population. For children, it remains unclear which language and memory paradigms produce optimal activation and how these should be quantified in a statistically robust manner. Consensus needs to be achieved for statistical analyses and the uniformity and yield of language, motor and memory paradigms. Larger scale studies are required to produce patient series data which clinicians may refer to interpret results objectively. If functional imaging techniques are to be the viable alternative for pre-surgical mapping of eloquent cortex for children, paradigms and analyses demonstrating concordance with independent measures must be developed...|$|R
