5|$|A 2006 {{study by}} Milan Ćirković and colleagues {{extended}} {{the notion of}} a time-dependent galactic habitable zone, analyzing various catastrophic events as well as the underlying secular evolution of galactic dynamics. The paper considers that the number of habitable planets may fluctuate wildly with time due to the unpredictable timing of catastrophic events, thereby creating a punctuated equilibrium in which habitable planets are more likely at some times than at others. Based on the results of Monte Carlo simulations on a toy model of the Milky Way, the team found that the number of habitable planets is likely to increase with time, though not in a perfectly <b>linear</b> <b>pattern.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The present paper {{proposes a}} method of texture {{classification}} based on long <b>linear</b> <b>patterns.</b> <b>Linear</b> <b>patterns</b> of long size are bright features defined by morphological properties: linearity, connectivity, width and by a specific Gaussian-like profile whose curvature varies smoothly along the crest line. The most significant information of a texture often appears in the occurrence of grain components. That’s why the present paper used sum of occurrence of grain components for feature extraction. The features are constructed from the different combination of long <b>linear</b> <b>patterns</b> with different orientations. These features offer a better discriminating strategy for texture classification. Further, the distance function captured from the sum of occurrence of grain components of textures is expected to enhance the class seperability power. The class seperability power of these features is investigated in the classification experiments with arbitrarily chosen texture images taken from the Brodatz album. The experimental results indicated good analysis, and how the classification of textures will be effected with different long <b>linear</b> <b>patterns...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Tendons {{are easily}} damaged if placed under too much strain, which {{can result in}} a painful, and {{possibly}} career-ending, injury. Tendinitis is most commonly seen in high performance horses that gallop or jump. When a tendon is damaged the healing process is slow because tendons have a poor blood supply, reducing the availability of nutrients and oxygen to the tendon. Once a tendon is damaged the tendon will always be weaker, because the collagen fibres tend to line up in random arrangements instead of the stronger <b>linear</b> <b>pattern.</b> [...] Scar tissue within the tendon decreases the overall elasticity in the damaged section of the tendon as well, causing an increase in strain on adjacent uninjured tissue.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn plants, {{specialized}} epidermal {{cells are}} arranged in semiordered patterns. In grasses such as maize, stomata and other specialized cell types differentiate in <b>linear</b> <b>patterns</b> within the leaf epidermis. A variety of mechanisms have been proposed to direct patterns of epidermal cell differentiation. One class of models proposes that patterns of cellular differentiation depend on the lineage relationships among epidermal cells. Another class of models proposes that epidermal patterning depends on positional information rather than lineage relationships. In the dicot epidermis, cell lineage {{is an important factor}} in the patterning of stomata, but not trichomes. In this study, the role of cell lineage in the <b>linear</b> <b>patterning</b> of stomata and bulliform cells in the maize leaf epidermis is investigated. Clones of epidermal cells in juvenile leaves were marked by excision of dSpm from gl 15 -m and in adult leaves by excision of Ds 2 from bz 2 -m. These clones were analyzed in relation to patterns of stomata and bulliform cells, testing specific predictions of clonal origin hypotheses for the patterning of these cell types. We found that the great majority of clones analyzed failed to satisfy these predictions. Our results clearly show that lineage does not account for the <b>linear</b> <b>patterning</b> of stomata and bulliform cells, implying that positional information must direct the differentiation patterns of these cell types in maize...|$|R
