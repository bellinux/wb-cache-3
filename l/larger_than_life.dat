In the UK, Sikorski received honoris causa degrees from the University of Liverpool and University of St Andrews.

5|$|Harihara's nephew and protégé, the {{dramatic}} poet Raghavanka of Hampi, whose style {{is compared to}} that of 10th-century poet Ranna, was the first to establish the shatpadi metre in Kannada literature in the epic Harishchandra Kavya (1200). According to L. S. Seshagiri Rao, it is believed that in no other language has the story of King Harishchandra been interpreted in this way. The writing is an original in tradition and inspiration that fully develops the potential of the shatpadi metre. The narration has many noteworthy elegiac verses such as the mourning of Chandramati over the death of her young son Lohitashva from snake bite. The very writing that made Raghavanka famous was rejected by his guru, Harihara. His other well-known writings, adhering to strict Shaiva principles and written to appease his guru, are the Siddharama charitra (or Siddharama Purana), a <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>life</b> stylistic eulogy of the compassionate 12th-century Veerashaiva saint, Siddharama of Sonnalige; the Somanatha charitra, a propagandist work that describes the life of saint Somayya (or Adaiah) of Puligere (modern Lakshmeshwar), his humiliation by a Jain girl and his revenge; the Viresvara charita, a dramatic story of the blind wrath of a Shaiva warrior, Virabhadra; the Hariharamahatva, an account of the life of Harisvara of Hampi; and Sarabha charitra. The last two classics are considered lost.|$|E

25|$|The frontal view of {{the figures}} in paintings, sculptures, and relief is not an {{invention}} of the Parthians. In the ancient Near East the custom was to depict figures in the profile view, although the frontal view was always present to some degree, especially in sculpture.

Daniel Schlumberger argues that these are always special figures which particular attention given to be perceived as <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>life</b> and more important than other figures in the depiction.

25|$|The Deuteronomistic Historians, who {{redacted}} the Former Prophets (Joshua, Judges, 1 & 2 Samuel, 1 & 2 Kings), idealized Samuel as {{a figure}} who is <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>life</b> like Joshua. Samuel's father, Elkanah, is described as having originated from Zuph, specifically Ramathaim-Zophim, {{which was part of}} the tribal lands of Ephraim, while the Books of Chronicles state that he was a Levite. Samuel is a judge who leads the military like in the Book of Judges and also who exercises judicial functions. In 1 Sam 12:6–17, the Deuteronomic Historians composed a speech of Samuel that portrays him as the judge sent by God to save Israel. In 1 Samuel 9:6–20, Samuel is seen as a local “seer”. The Deuteronomistic Historians preserved this view of Samuel while contributing him as “the first of prophets to articulate the failure of Israel {{to live up to its}} covenant with God.” For the Deuteronomistic Historians, Samuel was an extension of Moses and continuing Moses’ function as a prophet, judge, and priest, which made historical Samuel uncertain.|$|E

However strictly speaking we only have empirical knowledge of the laws that hold true for the analogical system, and if the time constant for the target system is <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> the <b>life</b> cycle of human being (as in the case of the geobiosphere) it is therefore very difficult for any single human to empirically verify the validity of the extension of the laws of their model to the target system in their lifetime.|$|R
