50|$|Estoppel is {{sometimes}} {{said to be}} a rule of evidence whereby a person is barred from leading evidence of a fact that has already been settled or they are otherwise precluded from asserting. However, that may be an oversimplification. Firstly, although some estoppels relate to preventing a party from asserting facts, others relate to preventing a party from asserting a right or a claim. Secondly, under the conflict of laws in common law jurisdictions matters of evidence are usually treated as procedural matters for the law of the local court (the lex fori), whereas it is generally accepted that an estoppel may affect substantive rights and are therefore matters to be determined by the proper law (or <b>lex</b> <b>causae)</b> which governs the particular issue.|$|E
5000|$|The {{local law}} determines who can {{sue and be sued}} as {{parties to the}} action. The case law on this {{question}} is not very consistent. For example, the English court held in Banque Internationale de Commerce de Petrograd v Goukassow 1923 2 KB 682 that a dead person cannot be a party to an action even though this was possible under the <b>lex</b> <b>causae.</b> However, if a foreign entity has legal personality under the law where it was established, it can be a party to English proceedings. Thus, in Bumper Development Corp. v Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis 1991 1 WLR 1362 an Indian temple that was [...] "little more than a pile of stones" [...] could be a party.|$|E

Thus, {{it is no longer}} necessary for the case to be based on a tort actionable in England. The English courts must apply wider international tests and respect any remedies available under the [...] "Applicable Law" [...] or <b>lex</b> <b>causae</b> including any rules on who may claim (e.g. whether a personal representative may claim for a fatal accident) and who the relevant defendant may be (i.e. the English court would have to apply the applicable law's rules on vicarious liability or the identity of an [...] "occupier" [...] of land).|$|E
5000|$|The lex loci arbitri is {{an element}} {{in the choice of}} law rules applied to cases testing the {{validity}} of a contract. As an aspect of the public policy of freedom of contract, the parties to an agreement are free to include a forum selection clause and/or a choice of law clause and, unless {{there is a lack of}} bona fides, these clauses will be considered valid. If there is no express selection of a proper law, the courts will usually take the nomination of a forum as a [...] "connecting factor", i.e. a fact that links a case to a specific geographical location. For these purposes, one of the [...] "forums" [...] that may be selected is arbitration. Hence, the fact that the parties have chosen a state as the place of arbitration is an indication that parties may have intended the local law to apply. This indication will be weighed alongside other connecting factors. The state that has the largest number of connecting factors will be the <b>lex</b> <b>causae</b> applied to resolve the dispute between the parties. If there is a tie, the connecting factors which relate to performance will be given a greater weighting.|$|E
5000|$|In the Roman {{conflict}} of laws, an incidental {{question is a}} legal issue that arises {{in connection with the}} major cause of action in a lawsuit. The forum court will have already decided that it has jurisdiction to hear the case (resolving any issue relating to forum shopping) and will be working through the next two stages of the conflict process, namely: characterisation and choice of law. For example, the court may classify the cause as [...] "succession", but it notes that the plaintiff brings the claim for relief as the deceased's widow. Before the court can adjudicate on the main issue, it must first decide whether the plaintiff actually has the status claimed, i.e. the incidental question would be the validity of the claimed marriage. The inconvenient reality is that many lawsuits involve a number of interdependent legal issues. In purely domestic cases, this poses no difficulty because a judge will freely move from one domestic law to another to resolve the dispute. But in a conflict case, {{the question is whether the}} incidental question is resolved by reference either to its own choice of law rules, or to the same law that governs the main issue (the <b>lex</b> <b>causae).</b> States have not formulated a consistent answer to this question.|$|E
5000|$|... if {{the effect}} of the relief would be so {{different}} from that available under the <b>lex</b> <b>causae</b> that it makes the right sought to be enforced a different right. For example, in English law, the court was asked in Phrantzes v Argenti 1960 2 QB 19 to enforce a Greek marriage dowry agreement. Although the forum had no public policy objections and agreed that such agreements were enforceable, relief was denied because there were no local rules to calculate the amount to be paid. A different result would have been achieved if the agreement had stipulated a liquidated sum to be paid. Thus, in Shahnaz v Rizwan 1965 1 QB 390, a deferred mahr (dowry) was enforced as part of an ante-nuptial agreement made in India in consideration of marriage at a time when ante-nuptial agreements were not generally enforceable under English law. The judge accepted the difference between maintenance and a dowry, and enforced payment as a right ex contractu rather than as a matrimonial right. Hence, a remedy was granted to enforce a right in personam, enforceable by the wife or widow against the husband or his heirs. The same result is achieved in the United States, see Aziz v. Aziz 1985 where a New York court enforced a deferred mahr of $5,000 because the terms of the contract complied with New York's General Obligations Law. The court rejected the husband's claim that it was a matrimonial action.|$|E
40|$|The {{thesis is}} based on the {{previous}} work of the author written as a thesis to terminate undergraduate studies in law. In the beginning, it covers two main sources of the EU law regarding the <b>lex</b> <b>causae</b> of contracts with an international element in the area of civil and commercial obligations, i. e. The Rome convention and the Rome I Regulation. In order to better capture the evolution in determination of the <b>lex</b> <b>causae</b> in commercial and civil contracts with an international element, the author introduces first the former and consequently in a comparative way, also the latter. Since this part of the thesis is presented in more general way, it follows that the author deals with the particular issue of consumer protection in the second part. The second part of the thesis covers the issue of consumer contracts as regards the Rome convention and the Rome I Regulation. While generally, contracts are characterized by their nature of performance, in the case of consumer contracts, it is the nature of contractual parties which is decisive. Regarding the consumer contracts, the author analyses the basic terminology of therein in the Czech and the EU context and also indicates possible linguistic problems.

40|$|This work {{analyses}} {{international economic}} sanctions {{from the point}} of view of the interaction between international law and the domestic legal systems of the States concerned. In doing so, it may prove useful to resort to the private international law tools. International economic sanctions, when observed through the lens of a municipal legal system in which they claim implementation, take the form of measures interfering in the regulation of private economic intercourse. To better understand how such measures are to be dealt with, the present work sorts out some of these measures by the form they take in their implementation at the municipal level. They can take the form of prohibitive measures directly affecting commercial transactions, seizures, measures consisting in the deprivation of rights or status, the non-recognition of juridical situations as created by non-domestic decisions. The author stresses moreover that the furtherance of the respect of existing legal rules can also be carried out by positive sanctions and measures: inducements that prove sometimes to be far more effective, as they determine the harmonization of municipal law with the international standards and rules whose respect is at stake. To understand how measures of economic sanction become effective, it is important to face the question of their application as raised before a judge vested with the authority of settling a dispute at the municipal level. In dealing with this issue, the work follows in principle European private international law, as shaped by the Rome Convention of 1980 on the law applicable to contractual obligations. Firstly, the author deals with cases where sanctions are incorporated into the judge’s State legal system. For such cases, he analyses the three alternative situations: the least problematic one is that of the lex fori governing the relationship as a whole. Where <b>lex</b> <b>causae</b> is a foreign law which incorporates international sanctions, the authors thesis is that the lex fori should not prevail on it automatically: a functional comparison of the measures should be carried out, and only in case of violation of the core objectives of the lex fori sanctioning approach should the ordre public limit operate. If however the <b>lex</b> <b>causae</b> does not contain provisions enacting the sanctions that the lex fori wants to be applied, the latter’s provisions will be considered as internationally mandatory. The author then deals with the case in which the law of the forum does not incorporate any sanc- tions against the violator State, but the foreign law which is to be applied under the conflict-of-laws rules of the forum does. In such cases, the sanctioning provi- sions of the <b>lex</b> <b>causae</b> will normally apply, except in cases where ordre public considerations require a different outcome. The possible adoption of so called blocking regulations will be a straight forward case of such a contrast. Soft law recommending a given sanctioning attitude, on the other end, will significantly reduce the possibility of a judge considering foreign law incorporating sanctions to be contrary to the forum’s public policy. The work then deals with the case of sanctions not incorporated in the lex fori or in the <b>lex</b> <b>causae,</b> but in the law of a third State, and considers the role former art. 7. 1 of the Rome Convention, or equivalent approaches, could play: in this framework, an extensive analysis of the relevant case law is carried out. A similar analytical approach is followed when dealing with the recognition of foreign judicial decisions, and their relationship with international economic sanctions. The work then deals with the interplay between international economic sanctions and transnational commercial arbitration, in terms of arbitrability issues, of recognition and enforcement, as well as the setting aside of arbitral awards. Then, the question of the application of international economic sanctions by arbitrators is considered, in the light of the absence of a forum state in strict legal terms. Further, the author assesses the role of internal judges in evaluating the lawfulness of the adopted sanctions, at the international level, and suggests that a non negligible role could be played by judges. Among other things, national judges should take into considerations limitations arising from jus cogens, and in particular a so-called humanitarian exception to a full scale embargo. The last part of the work is devoted to a tentative dogmatic assessment of so-called positive sanctions and measures. Their role in shaping the public policy exceptions, for conflict of law purposes, is finally outlined...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{difficult}} problems of application of conflict-of-laws rules in the international private law is the problem of statement and permission of a preliminary (collateral) question. This results from {{the fact that in the}} scientific doctrine there was no uniform understanding of the legal nature and ways of permission of a preliminary question, and lack of his fixing at the legislative level. In article the concept of a preliminary (collateral) question as legal treatment of the actual circumstances accompanying consideration of the main legal relationship reveals and also examples of those actions which need to be executed before definition of applicable law to the main legal relationship or in the course of its application are given. Permission of a preliminary question is necessary for the correct and complete idea of all actual facts of the case arising by consideration of the civil dispute complicated by a foreign element. The author reveals possible solutions of various options of a preliminary (collateral) question, in particular, by means of use of the right of the country of court (lex fori), the right of the country with which legal relationship in general (<b>lex</b> <b>causae),</b> and also the legal procedure of the national right is connected...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the rationale of the theory, which prevals in most conflicts of laws systems, including the Rome I Regulation, that non-national rules cannot be applied by courts as the governing law of contracts. The paper {{begins with an}} analysis of the case law of domestic courts on the application of the Unidroit Principles and concludes that courts increasingly hold that the Principles can be relevant to the solution of issues before them. It then goes on to analyze the traditional reasons for the hostility of national legal systems and of many authors towards the application of such rules qua <b>lex</b> <b>causae</b> and concludes that they are unfounded. In particular the fragility of the belief that such a solution is needed to preserve the application of mandatory rules is exposed, as is the myth of the aptitude of national systems to provide predictable and satisfactory solutions in all cases. The author particularly criticizes the solution of Regulation Rome I and finds that the one adopted by the Hague Principles on Choice of Law in International Commercial Contracts is more modern and in keeping with the needs of the business community. The author also discusses the relative merits of national law and non-national rules to govern contracts and concludes that, whilst in many cases national law may be preferable, there are many situations where non-national rules, and notably the Unidroit Principles, may prove preferable...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{rules of}} private {{international}} law are regulated in the Civil Code, Book VII “Provisions of Private International Law”, Chapter II is called “The Family”. The conflict of laws {{in the field of}} matrimonial agreement is set out in art. 2593 and art. 2594 of the Civil Code. From the provisions of art. 2591 of the Civil Code in conjunction with art. 2593 paragraph 1 letter a and b of the Civil Code we note that we have two types of agreement. Thus, the first type of agreement from art. 2593 paragraph 1 letter a of the Civil Code is called the agreement of election of the law applicable to the matrimonial regime and refers to the conditions of validity “on the election of the law applicable to the matrimonial regime, except capacity” and the second type called matrimonial agreement is regulated by art. 2593 paragraph 1 of the Civil Code referring to “the admissibility and validity conditions of matrimonial agreement, except capacity. ”To clarify the meaning of the conflict of laws of Article 2590 of the Civil Code in conjunction with 2593 of the Civil Code we need to perform the primary classification of the concept of agreement of election of the law applicable to matrimonial regime. Application of {{private international law}} is impossible without deciphering the meaning of the legal rules specific to this branch or without classifying the test cases on categories. We can observe that art. 2593 paragraph 1 letter b and art. 2594 of the Civil Code does not define the notion of agreement of election of the law applicable to matrimonial regime. Once the operation of primary qualification is completed, by framing the legal relationship of private international law among the conflict of laws mentioned above and the applicable law determined, the agreement of election of the law applicable to matrimonial regime shall acquire new content and a new scope, due to the operation of secondary qualification, which is achieved by <b>lex</b> <b>causae,</b> namely by the substantive law applicable to the legal relationship in question...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} use of domicilium as a {{criterion}} in choice of law and jurisdiction in South African law with special reference to private-law status. In {{this area of the}} law adherence to the status theory has, in the recent past, resulted in {{the use of}} domicile as an exclusive ratio jurisdictionis. This has impacted negatively on choice of law issues in status matters: since domicile constituted the sole jurisdictional criterion, little attention was devoted to choice of law. Even though the lex domicilii was, in actual fact, applied to choice of law issues concerning private-law status, it happened only {{as a result of the}} assumption of jurisdiction by the forum domicilii. With the emergence of alternative jurisdictional criteria, such as ordinary residence, choice of law issues will have to be addressed from a conflict of laws perspective, since the jurisdictional criteria will no longer ensure the application of the appropriate <b>lex</b> <b>causae.</b> In this regard recognition of the functional diversification of jurisdictional and conflicts connecting factors is crucial: different principles and policies underlie the fields of jurisdiction and choice of law and this must be borne in mind when a connecting factor is selected. In view of the prominence of domicilium as a connecting factor, problem areas in regard to the interpretation and ascertainment of domicile, especially the domicile of choice, is investigated within the context of the Domicile Act 3 of 1992 and with a view to future reform. It is submitted that the subjective animus requirement for the acquisition of a domicile of choice remains uncertain and undefined. Since domicile constitutes such an important connecting factor in issues pertaining to private-law status, as well as other non-status matters, it is essential that it should be readily and easily ascertainable. In this regard certain concrete proposals for future reform are advanced. Ultimately the domicile of an individual should indicate the community to which he/she truly belongs: only then will domicile constitute a conflicts connecting factor which satisfies the demands of conflicts justice.

40|$|Este trabajo estudia las cuestiones de competencia {{judicial}} internacional, derecho aplicable y reconocimiento de decisiones que plantean los supuestos de ausencia y declaración de fallecimiento vinculados con varios ordenamientos jurídicos. Como presupuesto, incluye un análisis sobre los diversos modelos de regulación de la ausencia y declaración de fallecimiento en el panorama comparado. [...] The Private International Law {{questions raised}} by the disappearance of persons are diverse and complex. This complexity {{is partly due to}} the different methods used by the various legal orders to regulate these factual situations. Spanish law is a typical representative of the so-called mixed systems, which includes both declaration of absence and declaration of death. As regards jurisdiction issues, a number of significant legal systems show a trend to admit flexible bases of competence. Such an approach is helpful to guarantee the fulfilment of the protective nature of these proceedings. In Spain the terms of Article 22. 3 LOPJ (which includes only the last domicile of the absent person as basis of competence) make necessary an interpretation providing a widening of the circumstances in what is appropriate for our courts to intervene (as they do in practice). Concerning choice of law the idea of applying the <b>lex</b> <b>causae</b> –the legal order which governs the relationship (marriage, succession…) affected by the disappearance- seems only reasonable in those legal systems based on judicial presumptions of death without generally binding effect (as is typical of the common law countries). In Spanish law, according to article 9. 1 C. c., the basic criterion is that absence and declaration of death questions are governed by the law of the nationality of the absentee {{at the time of the}} disappearance. However, the distinction between procedure (governed by the lex fori) and substance raises here special difficulties. As far as recognition of foreign decisions in Spain is concerned, it is generally accepted that exequatur is not required due to the non-contentious nature of these proceedings. However, opinions vary regarding the conditions which these foreign decisions must fulfil. Finally the lack of effect of substantive res judicata which is proper of the non-contentious decisions for protective assistance and the possibility of revoking these decisions bring up special questions for discussion. ...|$|E
40|$|Die Arbeit behandelt die Voraussetzungen für die Anwendung von Eingriffsnormen durch {{international}}e Schiedsgerichte. Zur Erstellung einer Anknüpfungsnorm wird rechtsvergleichend die Behandlung von Eingriffsnormen in kontinentaleuropäischen Rechtskreisen und im angloamerikanischen Rechtsraum untersucht. Aus den Ergebnissen wird eine Anknüpfungsnorm, die vor internationalen Schiedsgerichten angewendet werden kann, abgeleitet. Parties {{to international}} contracts will invariably agree {{to resolve their}} disputes by arbitration. One reason for this choice will be their expectation {{to be able to}} exercise a greater measure of control over the arbitral tribunal than they would over a national court. This will also apply to the application to the law the arbitrators are to apply to a contract. It is a fundamental principle of contractual freedom that the parties are free to choose the applicable law they wish the tribunal to apply to their case. In most cases, the arbitral tribunal will be obliged to follow this choice. However, national legislators enact rules of law they intend to be applicable regardless of the otherwise applicable law. Such mandatory rules in most cases protect fundamental interests of states which the legislators consider to important to be circumvented by the choice of law of the parties. Before national courts of the states which enacted such laws, the application will be natural consequence of the national conflict of laws rules. If the dispute is to be decided before foreign courts, this will be substantially different. As will be set out in detail in this thesis, legislators and courts have elaborated rules according to which national courts will apply foreign mandatory rules. Most modern systems of arbitration law, however, provide a detachment of the arbitrators from the conflict of laws systems of the lex arbitri. Therefore, the rules established for the application of foreign mandatory rules do not apply in arbitration. The absence of such rules would, however, lead to the situation that the parties could circumvent the application of rules which may be essential for the interests of states. Further, one party may invoke a mandatory rule claiming that the rule has a certain impact on the contractual relationship with the other party which the arbitral tribunal must take into consideration. The arbitral tribunal in such a situation must decide whether and under which circumstances it will apply mandatory rules of law both of the <b>lex</b> <b>causae</b> and of third legal orders. The examination of the rules which arbitral tribunal shall follow in such a case {{is the subject of this}} thesis...|$|E
