40|$|Problem Based Learning (PBL) is one {{of several}} methods applied in current medical education. PBL tutors are {{expected}} to have the competency of a good facilitator so that they can guide the students to achieve their <b>learning</b> <b>objective.</b> This study aims to identify the correlation between the knowledge, attitude and behavior of PBL tutors and their competency in guiding students to achieve their <b>learning</b> <b>objective.</b> This cross-sectional study was conducted in the Medical Faculty of Maranatha Christian University in July – November 2007. Respondents were all the tutors who had joined a tutor training. The questionnaires used in this study were set by modifying “the characteristics of a good tutor” developed by Queen University. The data were collected in July – August 2007 and analyzed by using STATA 6. 0 program. Of the 87 tutors who had completed the training, 11 tutors were excluded from this study because they had never been assigned as a  PBL tutor.  Multivariate analysis with linier regression was conducted on 76 samples. The final model revealed that the tutors’ ability in giving feedback could increase their competency in guiding students to achieve their <b>learning</b> <b>objective</b> (CR= 0. 46; 95 %CI= 0. 26 - 0. 66). Another factor that could increase the tutors’ competency was their ability to clarify the <b>learning</b> <b>objective</b> (CR= 0. 3; 95 %CI=- 0. 18 - 0. 58).

Savery (1994) contends that the more structured the learning environment, the harder it is for the learners to construct meaning based on their conceptual understandings. A facilitator should structure the learning experience just enough {{to make sure that the}} students get clear guidance and parameters within which to achieve the <b>learning</b> <b>objectives,</b> yet the learning experience should be open and free enough to allow for the learners to discover, enjoy, interact and arrive at their own, socially verified version of truth.|$|E

25|$|Instructional design, the {{systematic}} design of materials, activities and interactive environments for learning, is broadly informed by educational psychology theories and research. For example, in defining learning goals or objectives, instructional designers often use a taxonomy of educational objectives created by Benjamin Bloom and colleagues. Bloom also researched mastery learning, an instructional strategy in which learners only advance {{to a new}} learning objective after they have mastered its prerequisite objectives. Bloom discovered {{that a combination of}} mastery learning with one-to-one tutoring is highly effective, producing learning outcomes far exceeding those normally achieved in classroom instruction. Gagné, another psychologist, had earlier developed an influential method of task analysis in which a terminal learning goal is expanded into a hierarchy of <b>learning</b> <b>objectives</b> connected by prerequisite relationships.|$|E

40|$|A {{successful}} {{approach to}} structured learning {{is to write}} the <b>learning</b> <b>objective</b> as a joint function of linear parameters and inference messages, and iterate between updates to each. This paper observes that if the inference problem is "smoothed" through the addition of entropy terms, for fixed messages, the <b>learning</b> <b>objective</b> reduces to a traditional (non-structured) logistic regression problem with respect to parameters. In these logistic regression problems, each training example has a bias term determined by the current set of messages. Based on this insight, the structured energy function can be extended from linear factors to any function class where an "oracle" exists to minimize a logistic loss.

500|$|Seductive {{details are}} often used in textbooks, lectures, slideshows, {{and other forms of}} {{educational}} content to make a course more interesting or interactive. Seductive details can take the form of text, photos, illustrations, sounds or music and are by definition: (1) interesting and (2) not directed toward the <b>learning</b> <b>objectives</b> of a lesson. [...] John Dewey, in 1913, first referred to this as “fictitious inducements to attention.” While illustrated text can enhance comprehension, illustrations that are not relevant can lead to poor learning outcomes. Since the late 1980s, many studies in the field of educational psychology have shown that the addition of seductive details results in poorer retention of information and transfer of learning. Thalheimer conducted a meta-analysis that found, overall, a negative impact for the inclusion of seductive details such as text, photos or illustrations, and sounds or music in learning content. This reduction to learning is called the seductive details effect. Recently, there have been many criticisms of this theory. Critics cite unconvincing and contradictory evidence to argue that seductive details do not always impede understanding and that seductive details can sometimes be motivating for learners.|$|E
