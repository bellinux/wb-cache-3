40|$|The paper {{provides}} a theoretical rationale for flexicurity policies, which consist of <b>low</b> employment <b>protection,</b> generous unemployment insurance and active labor market programmes. It analyzes in which conditions flexicurity can be optimal. <b>Low</b> employment <b>protection</b> encourages costly education efforts to access high productivity and high innovation sectors, with firms {{more likely to}} survive and thus not exposing much their workers to unemployment risk. Activation programmes support the reallocation flow from unproductive to productive firms, helping to reduce unemployment. <b>Low</b> employment <b>protection</b> thus provides incentives for costly self-insurance against unemployment risk through education, mitigating the moral hazard cost of unemployment insurance and activation programmes. The paper provides realistic numerical illustrations where flexicurity is optimal, {{and where it is}} not optimal...|$|R

40|$|The Paper {{analyses}} {{the political}} decision that determines {{the degree of}} investor protection. We show that entrepreneurs and workers can strike a political agreement by which <b>low</b> investor <b>protection</b> is exchanged for high employment protection. This ‘corporatist’ agreement is feasible if the political system favours the formation of coalition governments. In contrast, ‘non-corporatist’ countries will feature high investor <b>protection</b> and <b>low</b> employment <b>protection.</b> The model also shows that the more diffused is share ownership, the higher the chosen degree of shareholder protection. Finally, the model predicts the frequency of mergers and acquisitions to be negatively correlated with employment protection. These predictions are shown {{to be consistent with}} OECD evidence.

40|$|Using a {{panel of}} Uruguayan {{manufacturing}} firms we analyze the adjustment process in capital, blue collar and white collar employment. Our results confirm the lumpy nature of factor adjustment, the relevance of nonlinearities and the interdependence between factor shortages. The average annual estimated output gap due to adjustment cost for 1982 - 1995 was 2 %. Trade openness affected the adjustment functions of all three factors. Highly protected sectors adjust less when creating jobs (reducing labor shortages) than sectors with <b>low</b> <b>protection.</b> This {{may be due to}} fears of policy reversal in highly protected sectors. Also, highly protected sectors adjust more easily (than <b>low</b> <b>protection</b> sectors) when destroying jobs (reducing labor surpluses), {{especially in the case of}} blue collar labor. This suggests that trade protection may in fact destroy rather than create jobs within industries, as firms in highly protected sectors are more reluctant to hire and more ready to fire than firms in sectors with <b>low</b> <b>protection.</b> The results for capital are qualitatively similar but quantitatively smaller. Overall the impact of higher international exposure is larger for blue collar workers than white collar workers. Adjustment costs, Adjustment functions, Openness...|$|E
40|$|Investor {{protection}} regimes {{have been}} shown to partly explain why the same type of corporate event may attract different investor reactions across countries. We compare the value effects of large bank merger announcements in Europe and the US and find an inverse relationship between the level of investor protection prevalent in the target country and abnormal returns that bidders realize during the announcement period. Accordingly, bidding banks realize higher returns when targeting <b>low</b> <b>protection</b> economies (most European economies) than bidders targeting institutions which operate under a high investor protection regime (the US). We argue that bidding bank shareholders need to be compensated for an increased risk of expropriation by insiders which they face in a <b>low</b> <b>protection</b> environment where takeover markets are illiquid and there are high private benefits of control. ...|$|E

40|$|Cahier de {{recherche}} du Groupe HEC Paris, n° 951 This {{study examines}} whether auditors are {{employed as a}} monitoring mechanism to mitigate agency problems between controlling shareholders and minority shareholders (named Type II agency conflict). In a context of ownership concentration and poor investor protection, controlling shareholders can easily expropriate minority shareholders and profit from private benefits of control. However, this agency conflict has been rarely studied, as the most commonly assumed agency conflict resides between managers and shareholders (Type I). Using an audit fees model derived from Simunic (1980), we study the impact of type I and type II agency conflicts on audit fees in high vs. <b>low</b> investor <b>protection</b> countries. We then focus on two countries (Germany and France) providing a lower investor protection level, and two countries (the USA and UK) providing a higher investor protection level (La Porta et al. 1998, 2000). Our results show 1) a negative relation between audit fees and managerial shareholding, which is stronger for strong than for <b>low</b> investor <b>protection</b> countries; 2) a curvilinear (concave) relation between audit fees and controlling shareholding for <b>low</b> investor <b>protection</b> countries; 3) a lower Type II conflict in the strong investor protection countries. These results illustrate the mixed effects of the legal environment and both agency conflicts on audit fees...|$|R

40|$|The authors use a {{panel of}} {{manufacturing}} firms to analyze the adjustment process in capital blue collar and white collar employment in Uruguay {{during a period of}} trade liberalization when average tariff protection fell from 43 to 14 percent. They calculate the desired factor levels arising from a counterfactual profit maximization in the absence of adjustment costs, generating a measure of factor shortages or surpluses. The average estimated output gap for 1982 - 95 is 2 percent. The authors'policy analysis shows that trade openness affected the adjustment functions of all three factors of production. Highly protected sectors adjust less when creating jobs (reducing labor shortages) than sectors with <b>low</b> <b>protection.</b> This may be due to fears of policy reversal in highly protected sectors. Also, highly protected sectors adjust more easily (than <b>low</b> <b>protection</b> sectors) when destroying jobs (reducing labor surpluses), {{especially in the case of}} blue collar labor. This suggests that trade protection may in fact destroy rather than create jobs within industries, as firms in highly protected sectors are more reluctant to hire and more ready to fire than firms in sectors with <b>low</b> <b>protection.</b> The results for capital are qualitatively similar but quantitatively smaller, suggesting that trade protection plays less of a role in explaining adjustment costs for capital. Interestingly, export-oriented sectors have lower adjustment costs for blue collar labor but not for white collar employment or capital, suggesting that export-led growth may be particularly successful in reducing blue collar unemployment.
