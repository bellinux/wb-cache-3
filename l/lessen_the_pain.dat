5|$|In 1994, 18-year-old Sharon {{arrives in}} Genoa City and begins {{attending}} a local high school. She meets Nick Newman (son of wealthy tycoon Victor Newman), who is dating Amy Wilson (Julianne Morris). Nick {{falls in love}} with Sharon, despite Sharon's ex-boyfriend Matt Clark's (Eddie Cibrian) attempts to win her back. Nick and Sharon briefly separate after Matt exposes Sharon's secret about her motherhood at 16, but they reunite shortly afterwards. An angry Matt later rapes Sharon in his car, traumatizing her. Nick and Sharon become engaged; she tells him about the rape, which leads him to avenge Matt. Matt is shot, and Nick is the chief suspect. He is convicted and acquitted several months later, when Amy confesses to the shooting. After Matt leaves town, Nick and Sharon marry; to hold on to Nick, Sharon stops using birth control and becomes pregnant. Nick complains that he is unready for fatherhood; Sharon nearly has an abortion, but he stops her. In 1997, she gives birth to Noah Newman, who nearly dies after his premature birth. While Noah was critically ill Sharon's best friend (Grace Turner) tracks down the child Sharon gave birth to as a teenager (Cassie) and brings her to Genoa City, believing Cassie was <b>lessen</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> if Noah died.

This last was collected and put in one of the breakers, which was emptied of the salt water in order to receive it. As water, however, was the great necessity in that latitude, Mulford did not deem it prudent to set sail with so small a supply, and he accordingly commenced a search, on some of the adjacent rocks, Jack Tier accompanying him. They succeeded in doubling their stock of water, and collected several shell-fish, that the females found exceedingly grateful and refreshing. On the score of hunger and thirst, indeed, no one was now suffering. By judiciously sipping a little water at a time, and retaining it in the mouth before swallowing, the latter painful feeling had been gotten rid of; and as for food, there was even more than was actually needed, and that of a very good quality.

The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of {{administration of}} gabapentin and dextromethorphan on <b>the</b> postoperative <b>pain</b> after open prostatectomy. Methods: In a randomized clinical trial, 80 adult males with ASA class of I, II and III who were candidate for open prostatectomy under spinal anesthesia in Shahid Hasheminejad Educational Center (in Tehran) were enrolled and randomly allocated to two groups of gabapentin (n= 40) and dextromethorphan (n= 40). In dextromethorphan group, 60 mg of dextromethorphan syrup and in gabapentin group, 300 mg of gabapentin syrup were administered 2 hours preoperatively. During operation, the maximum height of block was determined at 5, 10 and 15 minutes after spinal anesthesia establishment. In postoperative period, at 1, 2, 12, and 24 hours, <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> intensity was measured through Visual Analogue Pain Scale (VAS); and, overall opioid consumption and the time to first analgesic request were recorded as well. Results: While <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> intensity in all the measurements was comparable between groups, at the 2 nd hour, <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> was significantly lesser in gabapentin group (2. 70 ± 1. 51 vs. 3. 74 ± 1. 77, P= 0. 006). Also, the time for the first analgesic request was comparable between study groups; however, the total dose of postoperative opioid consumption was lesser in gabapentin group (45. 0 ± 39. 32 vs. 64. 45 ± 32. 12 mg, P= 0. 018). Moreover, the height of block showed no significant difference. Conclusion: Preemptive oral administration of 300 mg of gabapentin syrup in patients undergoing open prostatectomy under spinal anesthesia significantly <b>lessens</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> intensity and <b>the</b> total dose of opioid consumption compared with 60 mg of dextromethorphan syrup.

Only surgical treatment ensures stabilization of a broken bone and thus <b>lessens</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> and restores <b>the</b> function of the limb. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate fitness and quality of life after intramedullary fixation stabilizing of pathological fractures. Material and methods 12 patients (8 femoral shaft fractures, 2 pertrochanteric fractures, 2 tibial shaft fractures) were treated with this method. In all patients a disseminated neoplastic disease was diagnosed. In 10 patients closed intramedullary fixation with a Kuntscher nail was performed (in 7 patients it was locked in a dynamic manner), in two patients fixation was made with Ender nails. Fitness was evaluated according to the ability to move, to load the operated limb, the range of motion in adjacent joints and muscle atrophy. One month after the operation quality of life was evaluated according to: the ability of self care, self dependence, subjective feeling of pain, necessity of analgesic intake and psychosomatic state. ResultsThree patients achieved preoperative fitness, despite worsened of fitness 6 patients were able to function independently and three patients required continuous care. All patients had to take analgesics, relief in severe pain typical of fracture was observed, but chronic pain typical of metastases was still present. The patients died within 2 to 16 months after the operation.

40|$|In {{discussing}} Bonheur d 2 ̆ 7 occasion Patrick Coleman {{has identified}} Gabrielle Roy 2 ̆ 7 s difficulty finding {{a vehicle to}} convey convincingly her insight that 2 ̆ 2 an awareness of separation is a necessary condition of any moment of real connection 2 ̆ 2 {{as one of her}} chief esthetic problems (77). Her successful negotiation of this tension in La Route d 2 ̆ 7 Altamont owes much to presenting consolation as an antidote to separation. First, rather than deny the reality of separation, consolation mediates between it and union by allowing Roy to portray separation coexisting with communion; even the most stable consolations must be constantly renewed since consolation is more a process than a permanent state achieved once and for all. Consolation is adjusting to loss, not restoration of the lost object. It <b>lessens</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> of separation, but does not heal the wound of absence completely. Second, the dialectic of absence and presence in consolation is enhanced by the retrospective first-person narrative form Roy uses particularly effectively in this novel. While retelling moments of shared joy, the older narrator can signal their transience, and likewise episodes of loss and dejection are retold in a way that reminds readers of the possibility of consolation. Furthermore the fact that the reader gradually realizes that older narrator Christine has become a writer makes the reflective nature of Roy 2 ̆ 7 s version of consolation more plausible. The mature writer-narrator intervenes frequently to interpret the experience of her younger self who was only just becoming aware of the sacrifices her emerging vocation would demand...|$|R

Materical and Methods: The patient presented with pain from a nonhealing lesion in the posterior maxilla following extraction of the maxillary right third molar. The lesion had not responded to any conventional dental treatment. The patient had suffered from breast cancer, and her treatment included several years of therapy with Zometa (zoledronic acid), a bisphosphonate. Results: The patient stopped taking Zometa and commenced rinsing with phosphate buffer–stabilized 0. 1 % chlorine dioxide–containing mouthwash. After 5 months, changes in the morphology of the lesion were noted and the soft tissue had closed over the open wound. Conclusion: Cessation of bisphosphonate therapy and usage of a phosphate buffer–stabilized 0. 1 % chlorine dioxide–containing mouthwash <b>lessened</b> <b>the</b> patient’s <b>pain</b> and resulted in closure of the soft tissue lesion.

40|$|How, if at all, {{should we}} {{remember}} {{the histories of}} injustice and atrocity that haunt most modern states? Since World War II, it has become commonplace to suggest that properly responding to injustices requires societies to remember them, and to remember the experiences of those they touched. But what specific value might memory in this sense constitute in or contribute to the lives and societies of those coping with troubled history? This question raises two issues. The first is ontological: {{what does it mean}} to say that a society should remember in the first place? Is it to say that the individuals who make up society should each privately remember, or is to say that the society as a whole should somehow create or maintain a collective memory that is not reducible to the sum of individual cognitive processes? The second issue is normative: what exactly can memory so conceived do to ameliorate the undesirable legacies that historical injustices leaves on the world? How might remembering help us to move forward, or help us to <b>lessen</b> <b>the</b> <b>pains</b> we can’t leave behind? This study takes on both of these issues. On the first, I suggest that when we speak of societies remembering, we’re speaking of irreducibly social processes, by which individual memories are translated into publicly available traces of the past, which can then inform recollection by others, perhaps at some distance from the original event. On the second, I suggest that this sort of remembering can be valuable in the wake of injustice as a way of combating the legacies of persistent harm and exclusion that sometimes follow victims long after an injustice is over, and challenge their abilities to stand, participate, and identify as full members of the political community.
