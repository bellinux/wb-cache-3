40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of central solar heating plants with seasonal storage (CSHPSS) to cover {{part of the}} heating demand of buildings with district heating in the residential sector is becoming an economically viable option that can contribute significantly to {{the reduction of the}} consumption of fossil fuels. The calculation of CSHPSS systems, with a highly dynamic behaviour, is a complex process in which climatic, demand and design data are required. Simple calculation methods can be used to perform feasibility and pre-design studies enabling an estimation of the annual result. A review of several simple methods that have been proposed for the evaluation and design of the main components of CSHPSS is presented. The methods share some characteristics: main <b>equipments</b> <b>considered,</b> dependence with solar radiation and heating demand; and differ in other aspects: design parameters of the main <b>equipments,</b> secondary <b>equipment</b> <b>considered,</b> degree of detail of climatic and demand input data and equations of the model used to calculate the performance of the system.

The scheme performance is evaluated via numerical simulations performed by using realistic parameter values. (C) 2011 Elsevier By. All rights reserved. CNPqCNP...|$|R
