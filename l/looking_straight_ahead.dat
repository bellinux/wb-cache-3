5|$|Hope {{is closely}} related to Idle Child of Fancy, {{completed}} by Watts in 1885, which also shows a personification of one of the traditional virtues (in this case Love) sitting on a cloud-shrouded globe. In traditional depictions of the virtues, Love was shown blindfolded while Hope was not; in Hope and Idle Child Watts reversed this imagery, depicting Love <b>looking</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> and Hope as blind. It {{is believed to be the}} first time a European artist depicted Hope as blind.|$|E
25|$|Test: Finally, infants {{are tested}} in the lab using the Headturn-preference procedure, a {{behavioral}} data-collection tool that measures preferences for one kind of auditory stimulus over another. The Headturn-preference procedure maintains that an infant will turn its head towards a stimulus it prefers. This procedure is conducted in a testing booth, with the infant sitting on the lap {{of his or her}} mother. A light is located {{on either side of the}} infant. The trial begins when the infant is <b>looking</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead.</b> Mother and experimenter are required to wear tight-fitting earphones which deliver masking music for the duration of the entire procedure. This is done to guarantee that neither mother, nor experimenter bias the infant's response. During each trial, one sidelight flashes, urging the infant to look at it. Once the infant turns his or her head and looks at the light, the sound stimulus is played. The stimulus continues to play until the sound finishes or the infant looks away. When the infant turns away from the source for at least two seconds, sound and light turn off and the trial ends. A new trial begins when the infant looks at the center panel again.|$|E
500|$|Yar's {{death in}} the episode was after Crosby had asked to be let out of her contract, and rumors had {{circulated}} of her departure. She later described her time spent on Star Trek: The Next Generation as [...] "miserable", and it was well known {{at the time that}} she was unhappy with the way her role had been developed. She later said that if she'd had more scenes written for her similar to the one she shared with Worf {{at the start of the}} episode then she wouldn't have wanted to leave the show. Yar's memorial scene was filmed twice, the first was with Crosby reciting the lines while <b>looking</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead,</b> which was the director's preferred choice. However a version with her looking towards each of the other characters in turn was ultimately used. Scanlan later said [...] "Don't ask me how she knew where they'd be standing". Marina Sirtis's tears in the scene were real, as she was cued by Crosby standing off camera. [...] "Skin of Evil" [...] was not the last episode in the first season in which Denise Crosby appeared. [...] "" [...] was subsequently filmed after this episode, but was aired earlier in the run. In fact, toward the end of [...] "Symbiosis" [...] you can see Crosby waving goodbye to the fans (it is the scene where Picard and Crusher leave the cargo bay). Crosby would also later return to the Yar role in [...] "Yesterday's Enterprise", the two part series finale [...] "" [...] and as Yar's half-Romulan daughter Sela in several episodes. Guest stars in [...] "Skin of Evil" [...] included Walker Boone as Leland T. Lynch, Brad Zerbst as a nurse and Raymond Forchion as Ben Prieto. Even though this episode marked the death of Yar, Crosby would be credited for the remaining three first season episodes.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Smokin'" [...] was {{directed}} by Peter Gray and also appears on the DVD version of Songbook: The Singles, Vol. 1. The video begins with {{a shot of the}} Super Furry Animals' 'SFA' logo which appears {{on the cover of the}} Ice Hockey Hair EP. The logo fades out and the camera pans through a crowd of dark figures wearing berets towards a woman standing behind a long, black table. The woman is wearing a short sleeved black dress and has a blonde bob haircut. Her arms and face are illuminated in the otherwise dark room and she is shown walking backwards down the table, giving coloured cards to each of the figures wearing berets. The woman walks up and down the table observing the crowd as they each use the piece of card they were given to make an origami animal. As each person completes a model animal the woman gives them a new piece of coloured card. Approximately two minutes into the video the woman returns to a central position behind the table and looks down at one of the beret wearers. The camera cuts to show him screwing up a piece of green card into a ball which turns into an origami crane and flies away as he opens his hands. The rest of the figures in berets are shown from behind, bowing their heads before the camera cuts to a close up view of several origami animals on the table. These animals also begin to move, and interact with each other until a large red animal arrives. The camera cuts to a close-up of the red animal's head with smoke shown coming from its nose. The next shot shows the origami animals stationary on the table as the camera pans up to the beret wearers who are <b>looking</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> while smoke moves across from the right. The woman walks up and down the table giving the beret wearers new pieces of card as they complete more and more origami animals. As the video draws to an end she rapidly piles up the origami animals into a heap in the middle of the table. When all the animals have been collected into the pile the beret wearers bow their heads and the woman puts her arms around the pile and smiles at the camera. In the final shot the woman places her hands on the table and stares at the camera as the video fades out to show the same Super Furry Animals' 'SFA' logo which appeared at the very beginning.|$|E
2500|$|The Department of the Environment {{report on}} the {{collision}} was published on 4 March 1976 and tests showed no equipment fault on the train. Postmortem evidence indicated that, {{at the time of}} impact, the driver's hand was on the [...] "dead man's handle", rather than {{in front of his face}} to protect it, implying he had made no attempt to stop. Witnesses were interviewed; some passengers on the train reporting that the train accelerated when entering the station, and some witnesses standing in the station reported that the driver, 56-year-old Leslie Newson, was sitting upright in his seat and <b>looking</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> as the train passed through the station. The state of the motor-control gear, as found after the accident, indicated that power had been applied to the motors until within two seconds of the impact.|$|E
