500|$|Admiral d'Estaing {{rejected}} Macartney's proposed {{terms of}} capitulations, countering with a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>articles</b> {{that he had}} drafted. Macartney found d'Estaing's proposed articles [...] "not merely unprecedented and humiliating, but so ensnaring and uncertain in their nature, extent, and aim that they might at any time supply a pretext for taking away the lives, together with the fortunes, of the capitulants." [...] His council was unanimous in rejecting the proposed capitulation, and the British chose to surrender unconditionally instead. [...] As a consequence, d'Estaing permitted his troops to pillage St. George's. [...] Among the items taken or destroyed were most of Macartney's silver and plate, much of his clothing, and his personal papers. The latter came as a particularly harsh blow to the governor, for copies of those papers sent to St. Lucia with his wife for safeguarding were destroyed by fire. [...] When d'Estaing invited Macartney to dine with him, the governor apologized for his garb, noting that the coat he was wearing {{was the only one}} left him. Macartney and other leading Grenadians were also refused parole, and were sent to France as prisoners of war.|$|E

2500|$|Jimmy Wales has {{described}} Wikipedia as [...] "an {{effort to create}} and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language". Though each language edition functions more or less independently, some efforts are made to supervise them all. They are coordinated in part by Meta-Wiki, the Wikimedia Foundation's wiki devoted to maintaining all of its projects (Wikipedia and others). For instance, Meta-Wiki provides important statistics on all language editions of Wikipedia, and it maintains a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>articles</b> every Wikipedia should have. The list concerns basic content by subject: biography, history, geography, society, culture, science, technology, and mathematics. As for the rest, it is not rare for articles strongly related to a particular language not to have counterparts in another edition. For example, articles about small towns in the United States might only be available in English, even when they meet notability criteria of other language Wikipedia projects.|$|E
2500|$|He {{worked like}} a jovial demon. His {{comments}} on prospective manuscripts were detailed and constructive, or dispositive, as the manuscript merited. Many an author might have listed him as co author, so extensive and excellent were his suggestions. The meetings {{of the board of}} editors of the Journal,(The American Journal of International Law) under his cheery chairmanship, were a delight. He would annually distribute, among other items, a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>articles</b> he had not deemed worthy of submission to other editors for analysis but had rejected on his own authority; he disposed of a hundred or more each year, in addition to all of his other work. Each entry was accompanied by a pithy dispositive comment worthy of The New Yorker magazine. This list was destroyed at the meeting to avoid embarrassing those whose submissions had been rejected-an act typical of the consideration for the feelings of others with which Baxter acted. – Stephen Schwebel ...|$|E
