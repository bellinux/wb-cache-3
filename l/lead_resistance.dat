5|$|After news of {{the atomic}} bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki reached the Indies in early August 1945, {{followed}} by the proclamation of Indonesian independence on 17 August, {{it was evident that}} Japanese control was weakening. Sudirman led a break out from the camp in Bogor. Although his fellow internees wanted to attack the Japanese soldiers, Sudirman convinced them against it. After ordering the others to their hometowns, Sudirman made his way to Jakarta and met with President Sukarno, who asked him to <b>lead</b> <b>resistance</b> against Japanese forces in the city. Unfamiliar with Jakarta, Sudirman refused, instead offering to lead forces in Kroya. He left for his former command on 19August 1945. At the same time, Allied forces {{were in the process of}} retaking the Indonesian archipelago for the Netherlands. The first British forces arrived on 8September 1945.|$|E
25|$|In {{occupied}} areas, North Korean Army political officers purged South Korean {{society of}} its intelligentsia by executing every educated person—academic, governmental, religious—who might <b>lead</b> <b>resistance</b> against the North; the purges continued during the NPA retreat. When the North Koreans retreated north in September 1950, they abducted {{tens of thousands}} of South Korean men. The reasons are not clear, but the intention might have been to acquire skilled professionals to the North.|$|E
25|$|Resistors of {{extremely}} high precision are manufactured for calibration and laboratory use. They may have four terminals, using one pair to carry an operating current {{and the other}} pair to measure the voltage drop; this eliminates errors caused by voltage drops across the lead resistances, because no charge flows through voltage sensing leads. It is important in small value resistors (100–0.0001ohm) where <b>lead</b> <b>resistance</b> is significant or even comparable with respect to resistance standard value.|$|E

500|$|Indonesia is the world's largest majority-Muslim country. This {{has had a}} large {{influence}} {{on the development of}} Indonesia, both in its national revolution and in modern times. However, it has been used to justify and promote political positions. The Dutch colonial government minimized the role of the religious leaders, the kyai and ulama, in an attempt to prevent them using their influence to <b>lead</b> <b>resistance.</b> Modern rulers have used it to [...] "maintain the status quo", while those pushing for change use Islam as a means for justice or other political ends. This has led to a general fragmentation.|$|E
2500|$|Measurement of low {{resistance}} requires <b>lead</b> <b>resistance</b> (measured by touching the test probes together) to be subtracted for best accuracy. This {{can be done}} with the [...] "delta", [...] "Zero", or [...] "null" [...] feature of many digital multimeters.|$|E
2500|$|US Army Special Forces' {{original}} {{mission was}} to train and lead guerrillas in a nation occupied by another: [...] " [...] advisory personnel and mobile training teams to advise, train and provide operational assistance for paramilitary forces." [...] The most likely case, at the time Special Forces were created, would be to <b>lead</b> <b>resistance</b> groups in European countries overrun by the expected Soviet Bloc attack. Over time, the term guerrilla warfare, especially led by Americans, fell into disfavor, and unconventional warfare took its place.|$|E

40|$|A novel thermistor-based {{temperature}} indicator using an RC oscillator and an up/down counter {{has been developed}} and described. The indicator provides linear performance over a wide dynamic temperature range of 0 - 100 °C. This indicator is free from the error due to <b>lead</b> <b>resistances</b> of the thermistor and gives a maximum error of ± 0 · 1 °C in the range 0 - 100 °C. Test results are given to support the theory...|$|R

2500|$|The {{government}} formally {{authorized the}} operation on March 17, 1960 when President Eisenhower {{signed off on}} a CIA paper entitled “A Program of Covert Action Against the Castro Regime.” A declassified report by the Inspector General Lyman Kirkpatrick details {{the history of the}} operation, and states that the presidential order gave the agency authorization to create an organization of exiled Cubans to manage opposition programs, begin a “propaganda offensive” to draw support for the movement, create an intelligence gathering network inside Cuba, and to “develop a paramilitary force to be introduced into Cuba to organize, train and <b>lead</b> <b>resistance</b> groups against the Castro regime. The CIA’s budget estimation for this covert operation was approximately $4.4 million. The paper signed by Eisenhower was also the sole report issued by the government throughout the entire project. This highlights the U.S. Government’s secrecy in carrying out the operation as well as its policy of plausible deniability. This program required the agency to work around the clock and collect a large amount of detail-specific information, as well as to cooperate with other agencies.|$|E

50|$|The RC time {{constant}} associated with contact resistance can limit the frequency response of devices. The charging and discharging of the <b>leads</b> <b>resistance</b> {{is a major}} cause of power dissipation in high clock rate digital electronics. Contact resistance causes power dissipation via Joule heating in low frequency and analog circuits (for example, solar cells) made from less common semiconductors. The establishment of a contact fabrication methodology is a critical part of the technological development of any new semiconductor. Electromigration and delamination at contacts are also a limitation on the lifetime of electronic devices.|$|R

5000|$|On 29 September 2013, she {{attended}} a political event {{organized by the}} Vlaams Belang in Boom, near Antwerp. On this occasion, she explained: [...] "It is important that a front of patriotic and euro-critical parties form in sight of European elections, which is the case, and get some good results in order to <b>lead</b> <b>resistance</b> to Euro and globalism".|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{minimize}} {{the effects of the}} lead resistances, a three-wire configuration can be used. In this method the two leads to the sensor are on adjoining arms. There is a <b>lead</b> <b>resistance</b> in each arm of the bridge, so that the resistance is cancelled out if the two lead resistances are accurately the same. This configuration allows up to 600 m of cable.|$|E

50|$|The ubiquitin-independent p53 {{degradation}} pathway {{is regulated}} by NQO1. NQO1 stabilizes p53, protecting it from degradation. Individuals with decreased NQO1 expression/activity have reduced p53 stability, which may <b>lead</b> to <b>resistance</b> to {{drugs such as}} chemotherapeutics.|$|R

50|$|The {{specific}} part of ATP synthase {{affected by}} bedaquiline is subunit c which is encoded by the gene atpE. Mutations in atpE can <b>lead</b> to <b>resistance.</b> Mutations in drug efflux pumps {{have also been}} linked to resistance.|$|R
50|$|It is usual {{to arrange}} the sense wires as the inside pair, while the force wires are the outside pair. If the force and sense {{connections}} are exchanged, accuracy can be affected, because more of the <b>lead</b> <b>resistance</b> {{is included in the}} measurement. The force wires may have to carry a large current when measuring very small resistances, and must be of adequate gauge; the sense wires can be of a small gauge.|$|E
50|$|For {{the next}} three months No. 3 Troop carried out patrols in advance of the British lines. These patrols were not without loss. The troop {{commander}} Captain Bryan Hylton-Jones was captured trying to <b>lead</b> <b>resistance</b> fighters through the lines. Some of the men captured would become prisoners of war while others were never heard of again. Hylton-Jones was later released from captivity by No. 46 (Royal Marine) Commando when they captured a German field hospital at Pont-l'Évêque.|$|E
50|$|In Poland, the Sonderfahndungsbuch Polen ("Special Prosecution Book-Poland") was {{the book}} of {{political}} proscription for the killing of socially important Poles who might <b>lead</b> <b>resistance</b> against the Nazi Occupation of Poland (1939-45). Compiled before the war began in 1939, the book contained lists that identified more than 61,000 members of the Polish elites — political and social activists, the intelligentsia, scholars, actors, former military officers — as enemies of the state dangerous to the Third Reich.|$|E

50|$|The Sultan's reign {{was marked}} by Siamese rule where its army invaded and {{occupied}} Kedah between 1821 and 1842. Local Kedahan Arab families supported the Sultan's efforts to <b>lead</b> <b>resistance</b> efforts against Siamese rule. Arab leaders employed a two-pronged approach of religious militancy and diplomacy to free Kedah from Siamese rule, among which the Jamallulail family {{played a leading role}} in these efforts and often carried out negotiations to persuade the Siamese to regain the state's independence.|$|E
5000|$|On March 31, 1933, on the {{installation}} of President Gabriel Terra's rule by decree, Brum attempted to <b>lead</b> <b>resistance</b> to Terra's government. After having increasingly realized {{during the course of}} that day that Terra's authoritarian rule enjoyed at least tacit support by many Uruguayans, Brum hurried into the middle of a road in Montevideo, was heard to shout [...] "viva la libertad! viva Batlle!" [...] (long live liberty! long live Batlle!), and committed suicide by gunshot. He was aged 49 {{at the time of his}} death.|$|E
40|$|A {{practical}} single {{constant current}} loop circuit for the signal conditioning of variable-resistance transducers has been synthesized, analyzed, and demonstrated. The strain gage and the resistance temperature device {{are examples of}} variable-resistance sensors. Lead wires connect variable-resistance sensors to remotely located signal-conditioning hardware. The presence of lead wires in the conventional Wheatstone bridge signal-conditioning circuit introduces undesired effects that reduce {{the quality of the}} data from the remote sensors. A practical approach is presented for suppressing essentially all <b>lead</b> wire <b>resistance</b> effects while indicating only the change in resistance value. An adaptation of the current loop circuit is presented that simultaneously provides an output signal voltage directly proportional to transducer resistance change and provides temperature information that is unaffected by transducer and <b>lead</b> wire <b>resistance</b> variations...|$|R
40|$|During the {{individual}} cell short-down procedures {{often used for}} storing or reconditioning nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cd) batteries, {{it is possible for}} significant reversal of the lowest capacity cells to occur. The reversal is caused by the finite resistance of the common current-carrying leads in the resistive network that is generally used during short-down. A model is developed to evaluate the extent of such a reversal in any specific battery, and the model is verified by means of data from the short-down of a f-cell, 3. 5 -Ah battery. Computer simulations of short-down on a variety of battery configurations indicate the desirability of controlling capacity imbalances arising from cell configuration and battery management, limiting variability in the short-down resistors, minimizing <b>lead</b> <b>resistances,</b> and optimizing <b>lead</b> configurations...|$|R
