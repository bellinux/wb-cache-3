50|$|Nordzucker AG, {{headquartered}} in Braunschweig, Germany, is Europe’s second largest sugar manufacturer.The production of <b>sugar,</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>sugars</b> and other specialities {{for the application}} in the nutrition, beverage and sweets industry {{as well as other}} sugar specialities like refined sugar, icing sugar, lump sugar, preserving sugar, tea sugars and flavoured sugars for consumers are the core business of the company. In addition to that, Nordzucker produces animal feed and bioethanol from sugar beet.In the 2012/2013 financial year, the company produced 2.8 million tons of sugar from 17.3 million tons of sugar beet which were cultivated on 266,000 hectares. Sales added up to EUR 2.4 billion and net income came to EUR 360 million. 40% of sales were generated in Northern Europe, 44% in Germany and 16% in Eastern Europe.|$|R
50|$|The <b>liquid</b> <b>sugar</b> is {{blended with}} a small amount of royal icing. The heat from the sugar causes the air {{incorporated}} in the icing to rapidly expand, causing the mixture to grow to several times its original volume. The mixture is quickly poured into a lined dish, and placed into a blast chiller to set. This process produces a sugar mass with the texture of volcanic pumice, the color of which is determined by the color of the sugar syrup.|$|E
50|$|Es buah is an Indonesian iced fruit {{cocktail}} dessert. This cold and sweet beverage {{is made of}} diced fruits, such as honeydew, cantaloupe, pineapple, papaya, squash, jackfruit and kolang kaling (Arenga pinnata fruit), mixed with shaved ice or ice cubes, and sweetened with <b>liquid</b> <b>sugar</b> or syrup. The type of fruit used in this dessert may vary, some might add any available fruits such as mango, watermelon or longan — some imported fruits — such as lychee, kiwi, strawberry, pear, peach or grapes. Other ingredients might be added too, such as agar-agar jelly, grass jelly, seaweed or nata de coco.|$|E
50|$|In the {{extrusion}} process, {{raw materials}} are first {{ground to the}} correct particle size, usually the consistency of coarse flour. The dry mix is passed through a pre-conditioner, in which other ingredients are added depending on the target product; these may be <b>liquid</b> <b>sugar,</b> fats, dyes, meats or water. Steam is injected to start the cooking process, and the preconditioned mix (extrudate) is then passed through an extruder. The extruder consists of a large, rotating screw tightly fitting within a stationary barrel, {{at the end of}} which is the die. The extruder's rotating screw forces the extrudate toward the die, through which it then passes. The amount of time the extrudate is in the extruder is the residence time.|$|E

40|$|Interesterification {{becomes a}} very {{powerful}} tool in food industry. A blend of coconut oil and palm stearin is enzymatically interesterified by lipase (EC 3. 1. 1. 3) in an aquarium reactor. The interesterified blend obtained is then incorporated in madeleines, mini croissants, and mini rolls. Physicochemical parameters’ assessment for molasses used is in good agreement with the international standards. Fatty acid composition of the interesterified blend and sugar content of molasses were assessed by gas chromatography (GC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). A sensory evaluation of the madeleines, mini croissants, and buns {{has been carried out}} by untrained tasters, with a statistical analysis by a principal component analysis (PCA). Chromatographic characterization by Gas Chromatography revealed fatty acids, ranging from C 6 : 0 to C 22 : 0. <b>Liquid</b> <b>sugar’s</b> content by high performance liquid chromatography revealed three main sugars: sucrose, glucose, and fructose. Results of the sensory analysis showed the good quality of the prepared products...|$|R
50|$|Method:Soak {{the sugar}} in about 0.5 liters of water. Clean all the {{ingredients}} & soak them in 400 ml. of water. Keep the mixture for 2-3 hours. Grind the soaked ingredients for getting a paste. Add the remaining water and put under strong stir. Filter the <b>liquid,</b> add <b>sugar</b> solution, milk and rose water. Mix well. Get chilled before serving, can add ice for the purpose.|$|R
50|$|The {{quality of}} ice cream and its smooth texture depend on the {{structure}} of their ice crystals and their dimensions, and on the viscosity of the ice cream. Water freezes out of a liquid in its pure form as ice. The concentration of the remaining <b>liquid</b> <b>sugar</b> mixture increases due to water removal, hence the freezing point is further lowered. Thus the structure {{of ice cream}} can be described as a partly frozen foam with ice crystals and air bubbles occupying most of the space. Tiny fat globules flocculate and surround the air bubbles {{in the form of a}} dispersed phase. Proteins and emulsifiers in turn surround the fat globules. The continuous phase consists of a concentrated, unfrozen liquid of sugars.|$|E
50|$|From June to December, {{cuttings}} {{from the}} tops of cane are laid in holes about five inches deep by five feet square then covered with soil. As the cane grows taller, fertilizer is used. Between planting and harvesting, bananas, corn, peas, potatoes, and other crops are cultivated. January to May, the ripe cane are cut and delivered to the mill to be ground. Boiling and clarifying the cane juice is the next operation. The juice is strained after grinding and then taken to the clarifying copper to be boiled. (Wood coal is the main source fuel). Lime is added {{to speed up the}} operation. The <b>liquid</b> <b>sugar</b> is put into coolers for about 14 hours. The molasses is then drained off and taken to the still house to be made into rum.|$|E
5000|$|Jellies and gums:Jellies and gums are thick <b>liquid</b> <b>sugar</b> candies. [...] Gums, such as wine gums, are drier than jellies. They {{are made}} from sugar syrup plus a gelling agent. They are cooked to the lowest {{temperature}} of all sugar candies and consequently have the highest water content of sugar candies, about 20 to 25% water. Their stiffness depends on the type and amount of gelling agent, the final concentration, the pH of the product, and other factors. The most popular forms of gelling agent are gelatin, agar-agar, starch (more typical of American jelly candies), and pectin (more typical of European candies). These produce different effects. For example, starch produces cloudy jellies, while high-methoxyl pectin produces clear ones. Agar-based jellies are harder to dissolve, and gelatin-based jellies have a more rubbery texture.|$|E
50|$|It is a boiled rice cake, {{stuffed with}} <b>liquid</b> palm <b>sugar</b> (gula jawa/merah/melaka), covered in coconut bits. The dough {{is made from}} glutinous rice flour, {{sometimes}} mixed with tapioca. It is green because the glutinous rice dough is flavoured and coloured with a paste made from the leaf of pandan or dracaena plant (daun suji) — whose leaves are used widely in Southeast Asian cooking.|$|R
5000|$|In Korea, a thick drink called yulmu cha (율무차, {{literally}} [...] "Job's tears tea") is {{made from}} powdered Job's tears. A similar drink, called Yi Ren Jiang [...] (薏仁漿), also appears in Chinese cuisine, and is made by simmering whole polished Job's tears in water and sweetening the resulting thin, cloudy <b>liquid</b> with <b>sugar.</b> The grains are usually strained from the liquid but may also be consumed separately or together.|$|R
