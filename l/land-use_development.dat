For this purpose, a real-world case in Tokyo, where a corridor-based approach is central to the coordination of public transport and <b>land-use</b> <b>developments,</b> was examined. The analysis combines and links spatial and institutional dimensions. Three criteria are employed in the spatial analysis: corridor transport characteristics, land-use densities, and land-use mix. On the institutional side, the role the local government and the private railway sector play in developing railway corridors in Tokyo is discussed. The exploration seems to support the proposition that the railway corridor can be a convenient spatial and institutional unit in which to integrate transport and <b>land-use</b> <b>developments.</b> However, translation to other metropolitan areas of elements of the Tokyo approach would have to adequately acknowledge contextual differences...|$|R

40|$|Mixed <b>land-use</b> <b>development</b> is the {{integration}} of different land-use functions like residential, commercial, recreational, and institutional in an urban sector or a neighbourhood. Integrating transport and land-use mix {{is one of the}} goals of planning policies around the world. Prior studies mention the benefits of mixed <b>land-use</b> <b>development</b> towards creating sustainable environment, but do not specify the proportion of the mix of compatible land uses.

To investigate the users’ insight, the study further examines residents’ perception with the help of parameters such as safety, satisfaction, pollution, and mix. The sustainability indices are computed for both residents’ travel behaviour and perception, for each neighbourhood. The study revealed that neighbourhoods with high and moderate land-use mix are sustainable with travel behaviour.

40|$|Abstract. The authors {{advance a}} new {{approach}} to transportation and land-use planning: the transportation impact statement (TIS). Current planning practice suffers from a lack of understanding of and adequate tools to evaluate the complex relationships that exist between land use and transportation. Consequently, <b>land-use</b> <b>development</b> frequently overloads the transportation system. A TIS exposes the complex interdependencies with a multimodal and regional assessment of the impact of <b>land-use</b> <b>development</b> on the transportation system. The authors offer a theoretical background for this new approach and an empirical illustration of its potential use through a case study based on the city of Haifa in Israel. The objective of the study is to investigate the local and regional transportrelated impacts of proposed land developments, thus improving the planning decisionmaking process. The impact of the proposed land developments on the transportation system was studied utilizing several transportation scenarios, including travel-demand management (TDM) strategies, using the metropolitan database and travel-demand modeling systems. The results show that the total number of trips generated by the proposed land developments is by far inconsistent with the capacity of the transportation network to accommodate all the forecasted demands under all transport scenarios. These results have a number of implications. First, TIS clearly improves our understanding of th...|$|E

Assessments of policy effectiveness face many methodological problems that are briefly discussed here. We choose to analyse the contribution of Dutch policies to open-space preservation by comparing actual <b>land-use</b> <b>developments</b> within different restrictive planning regimes. The presented analysis differs from comparable efforts that usually rely on census statistics through its use of local-level geographical data and spatial analysis techniques. Our approach has the advantage of being able to analyse the impact of spatially explicit regional zoning regulations. In addition to comparing regions with strict and less strict regimes, this paper also assesses the importance of another open-space characterisation. The latter refers to a distinction in agriculturally shaped and exploited landscapes and natural areas. We conclude the analysis with a discussion on possible spatial planning implications.

40|$|Plausible {{scenarios}} of future land use derived from model projections may differ substantially {{from what is}} actually desired by society, and identifying such mismatches is important for identifying policies to resolve them. This paper presents an approach to link explorative projections of future land use for the European Union to normative visions of desired land-use futures. We used the results of 24 scenario projections obtained from seven linked simulation models to explore uncertainty in future <b>land-use</b> <b>developments.</b> <b>Land-use</b> projections were linked to statements made by stakeholders for three normative visions of desired, future land use. The visions differed in the scale of multifunctionality of land use: at European (Best Land in Europe), regional (Regional Connected) or local (Local Multifunctional) level. To identify pathways to these visions, we analysed in which cases projected land-use changes matched with the land-use changes desired in the visions. We identified five pathways to the vision Regional Connected, two pathways to the vision Best Land in Europe, but no pathway to the vision Local Multifunctional. Our results suggest that policies {{have the ability to}} change the development of land use such that it is more in line with land-use futures desired by society. We believe our approach represents an interesting avenue for foresight studies on land use, as it combines the credibility from explorative scenarios with legitimacy and saliency of normative visions. </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} urban {{planning}} and change processes potentially impacting local infrastructure. The overarching theoretical frame is social-ecological resilience thinking {{and its potential}} application to as well as implications for urban <b>land-use</b> <b>development.</b> The paper draws its main attention on if this concept can be of use for urban planners dealing with change and urban infrastructure and if a readiness towards its application can be identified. This endeavor is informed by two explorative studies in Germany. One study gains its material from a scenario process with planning practitioners and further urban stakeholders of a medium-sized city. Main topic was {{how to deal with}} the challenges of climate change impacts in urban planning and development. The second explorative study reflects research results on the readiness to apply the resilience concept to urban planning dealing with change and local infrastructure in a small community. The scenario process showed that applying social-ecological resilience thinking to urban planning helps to critically reflect so far taken paths in local built infrastructure, to take on an integrated perspective and to develop new and innovative strategies for further <b>land-use</b> <b>development.</b> Nevertheless, such a process requires additional financial as well as human resources and translation exercises.

40|$|Land-use {{models have}} been {{developed}} for predicting future land-use patterns. We describe a logistic regression model for residential development in the Netherlands that takes the neighbourhood effects of land use and infrastructure into account. Hereto, a new methodology was developed, single parameter impact estimation, for estimating the influence of land use and infrastructure in the neighbourhood on residential developments. The model also incorporates initial land use and a set of policy-related and suitability-related variables. In essence, the neighbourhood effects typically simulated with cellular automata-based land-use {{models have been}} integrated into a logistic regression model. The model was calibrated and validated on historic <b>land-use</b> <b>developments</b> in the Netherlands. On the basis of the model, residential areas develop preferably at the fringe of the city, on agricultural land in the neighbourhood of residential areas. The probability of residential development depends on the cluster size of the land-use categories.
