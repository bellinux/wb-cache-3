40|$|The target tree {{establishment}} density for rehabilitated mine pits in the jarrah {{forest is}} currently 1300 stems ha- 1 {{and is designed}} to ensure that 300 stems ha- 1 of sawlogs are available for future timber production. However, tree density may affect other ecosystem parameters such as water use and understorey species richness. Rehabilitated sites were historically seeded with an understorey mix that included vigorous legumes to establish rapid vegetation cover and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Similar to high tree density, these vigorous legumes may have the undesirable effect of out-competing the small understorey species, which are the main contributors to the species richness of rehabilitated mined sites. The major objectives {{of this study were}} to determine 1) if high tree densities reduce the richness, density and cover of understorey species and 2) if the competitive effect of a vigorous native <b>legume</b> <b>seed</b> mix on smaller understorey species is evident 15 years post-rehabilitation. A complete factorial experiment of four tree densities (625, 1250, 2500 or 10 000 stems ha- 1) and two seed treatments (a high rate of vigorous native <b>legume</b> <b>seed</b> [+L] and no vigorous <b>legume</b> <b>seed</b> [-L]) were established in five replicate sites in 1988 i...|$|R

40|$|Choice of an {{insecticide}} treatment {{to be used}} on a <b>legume</b> <b>seed</b> crop in bloom should be determined by its hazard o bees {{as well as its}} economic effectiveness in controlling harmful insects.

Grain legume {{performances in the}} cropping system are highly dependent upon N nutrition of the crop relying on root assimilation of soil N in combination with symbiotic fixation of atmospheric dinitrogen. In order to improve the competitive ability of grain legumes for growth resources an enlargement of the crop surface area production in combination with a judicious management of both inputs and N acquisition (and allocation to the harvested organs) is needed. Competitive ability implies {{to take into account}} economical constraints and the crop production effect on the environment, reducing the amount of N remaining after the crop harvest preventing N leaching.

40|$|The {{seeds of}} Spartium junceum {{contained}} a large quantity of lectin-like protein {{that did not}} appear to be either a hemagglutinin or active lectin. The cross-reactive material (CRM), like most <b>legume</b> <b>seed</b> lectins, was a tetrameric glycoprotein of about 130, 000 Mr. The singlesized subunits of about 33, 000 Mr were not covalently associated. The amino acid composition was typical of legume lectins and was rich in hydroxy-amino acids and poor in sulfur-containing amino acids. The Spartium CRM contained about 3. 5 % covalently associated carbohydrate, most likely of the high-mannose type, since the CRM was precipitated by concanavalin A. The CRM was localized by electron-microscopic immunocytochemistry and found to be exclusively in protein-filled vacuoles (protein bodies).

40|$|Abstract. The {{aim of this}} {{experiment}} {{was to determine the}} effect of root excretions of spring cereal seedlings on seed germination of field pea and common vetch. The experiment carried out in March and April 2009 under laboratory conditions (in the IUNG laboratory) involved oat, barley, wheat, triticale, field pea and common vetch. Two concentrations of excretions were applied: I – corresponding to the effect of one cereal seedling on one <b>legume</b> <b>seed,</b> II – corresponding to the effect of five cereal seedlings on one <b>legume</b> <b>seed.</b> The effects were examined after 4 and 8 days. Root excretions applied in a lower concentration usually had no effect on the tested parameters characterizing the germination of peas and vetch seeds. However, the stimulating effect of barley excretions on the length of the pea and vetch rootlet was recorded as well as the effect of triticale on the length of rootlet and the mass and length of germ in pea. Favorable effect of triticale excretions was found both after 4 and 8 days from their application. Cereal excretions with higher concentrations, except for oat excretions, had mostly an inhibitory and in some cases even destructive effect on seed germination. No favorable effect of wheat excretions on <b>seeds</b> of both <b>legume</b> species was observed on any treatments...|$|R
