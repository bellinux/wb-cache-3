5|$|In early March 2005, the {{official}} Lebanese Eurovision Song Contest website did not list Israel as a participant. After the EBU asked Télé Liban {{to resolve the}} issue within 24 hours or face disqualification, the site removed the complete <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>participants</b> and replaced the page with a link to Eurovision.tv, {{the official}} Eurovision website.|$|E
5|$|On December 15, 2004, Télé Liban {{announced}} that financial constraints {{forced them to}} withdraw from the contest, and denied reports that it was due to political conflicts with Israel. However, five days later, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) reached an agreement with Télé Liban and Lebanon was put on the official <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>participants.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{the use of}} English in worship {{services}} spread, {{the need for a}} complete uniform liturgy for the Church became evident. Initial meetings to start what would eventually become the Book of Common Prayer were held in the former abbey of Chertsey and in Windsor Castle in September 1548. The <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>participants</b> can only be partially reconstructed, but it is known that the members were balanced between conservatives and reformers. These meetings were followed by a debate on the Eucharist in the House of Lords which took place between 14 and 19 December. Cranmer publicly revealed in this debate that he had abandoned the doctrine of the corporeal real presence and believed that the Eucharistic presence was only spiritual. Parliament backed the publication of the Prayer Book after Christmas by passing the Act of Uniformity 1549; it then legalized clerical marriage.|$|E

In that gathering, Dr. Spence Watson got applause when stating at the podium that [...] "The swooping down of the Christian nations on China [...] the most detestable bit of greed that history records". The conference as a whole adopted resolutions clearly condemning that Western intervention in China (though in milder terms) and stating that defence of Western missionaries active in non-European countries, or of connverts to Christianity, was not an acceptable reason for waging war.|$|E
