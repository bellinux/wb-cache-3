This new variant has a cargo <b>loading</b> <b>system</b> capable of handling virtually every type of container and pallet, and a side door {{at the rear of}} the lower deck capable of handling large items of general freight. The airline took its first delivery of this new aircraft in September 2004, with the eighth and final aircraft delivered on 22 June 2006. The new freighters were powered by two General Electric (GE) CF6-80C2 engines and signed a 14-year Maintenance Cost Per Hour (MCPH) programme with GE on 25 January 2005.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – This paper mainly {{deals with}} the {{development}} and computer control for heat <b>load</b> <b>system</b> with rapid response and large heat flux. Firstly, the structure and working principle of the IGBT based heat <b>load</b> <b>system</b> are analyzed, and the design method for major parts is discussed. Secondly, a mathematical model to describe the dynamic characteristics is established, and conventional PID and Fuzzy PID control algorithms for the controlled plant are designed. Furthermore, simulations and experimental investigations focused on the developed heat <b>load</b> <b>system</b> and its control strategies are carried out. The simulation and experiment results show that {{to achieve the same}} heat flux density, the developed heat <b>load</b> <b>system</b> is five times faster than the traditional heat <b>load</b> <b>system.</b> So it can acquire the satisfactory performance, what is more, the heat <b>load</b> <b>system</b> combined with fuzzy PID control strategy is the more reliable than open loop case and one with conventional PID strategy.

25|$|Argon is {{used for}} {{experiments}} involving laser heating because it is chemically insulating. Since it condenses at a temperature above that of liquid nitrogen, it can be loaded cryogenically. Helium and neon have low X-ray scattering factors and are thus used for collecting X-ray diffraction data. Helium and neon also have low shear moduli; minimizing strain on the sample. These two noble gases do not condense above that of liquid nitrogen and cannot be loaded cryogenically. Instead, a high-pressure gas <b>loading</b> <b>system</b> has been developed that employs a gas compression method.|$|E

Both Volta and Mogador were refitted in January 1940 and had their turrets modified, although loading still could not be done at angles higher than 10°. The surrender of France in June 1940 ended any work on a new <b>loading</b> <b>system.</b> Five-round ready racks for each gun were added to the sides of the turrets during the refit to compensate for any problems with the loading systems. The magazines were designed to store 1440 138mm shells, 180 rounds per gun, plus there was a separate magazine for 85 starshells which supplied turret Nr. 2.|$|E

500|$|The Iowas torpedo {{defense was}} {{virtually}} {{the same as the}} South Dakotas, consisting of four longitudinal torpedo bulkheads behind the outer hull plating with a system depth of [...] to absorb the energy of a torpedo warhead. The extension of the armor belt to the triple bottom, where it tapers to a thickness of , serves as one of the torpedo bulkheads and was hoped to add to protection. Additionally, several compartments were liquid loaded in order for the torpedo bulkheads to elastically deform and absorb energy. The outer hull was intended to detonate a torpedo, with the outer two compartments absorbing the shock and with any splinters or debris being stopped by the armored belt and the empty compartment behind it. However, the Navy discovered in caisson tests in 1938 and 1939 that this torpedo defense system was actually less effective than the previous design used on the North Carolina-class due to the rigidity of the lower armor belt causing leakage into adjacent compartments. To mitigate the effects, the liquid <b>loading</b> <b>system</b> was altered so that the two outermost compartments were filled, while the two inboard compartments were void spaces. Based on costly lessons in the Pacific theater, concerns were raised about the ability of the armor on these battleships to withstand aerial bombing, particularly high altitude bombing using armor piercing bombs. Developments such as the Norden bombsight further fueled these concerns. When these concerns surfaced nothing could be done to adequately address the problem. Furthermore, experience in the Pacific theater demonstrated that high altitude bombing was not particularly effective against maneuvering warships.|$|E
500|$|Development {{of the new}} {{tank was}} offered to five {{separate}} manufacturers: Atelier de Construction d'Issy-les-Moulineaux (AMX), Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée (FCM), Renault, Societe Lorraine de Dietrich (SLD-Lorraine) and Societé d'Outillage Mécanique et d'Usinage d'Artillerie (SOMUA). The new vehicle {{was based on the}} new post-war requirement for a single battle tank. The new vehicle was designated the AMX 50. Its hull and suspension were {{similar to that of the}} German Panther tank, which had been used by the French Army in the immediate post-war. The French government's specifications for the new tank were strongly influenced by both the Panther tank and the heavier Tiger I; specifically, the French Army was looking for a tank with the protection of the former and the firepower of the latter. Although the design borrowed from German tanks, including the Maybach [...] engine, based on an earlier model, and the torsion bar sprung road wheels, the AMX 50 also included a number of unique features. For example, it included an oscillating turret, mounted on trunnions, which was the first of its kind. The oscillating turret consisted of two parts, one of which was mounted on the trunnions of the lower part, attached to the turret ring. The main gun was attached to the upper part, facilitating gun elevation and depression, as well as simplifying the fire control equipment and the installation of the automatic <b>loading</b> <b>system.</b> Of the three contractors, Renault withdrew from the program, while in early 1946 the French government selected AMX and SOMUA to continue the development. The prototypes were designated M4s, and AMX completed its prototype in 1949, while SOMUA would not be finished until 1956. AMX's first prototype was armed with a [...] cannon, although a second prototype was fitted with a larger [...] gun in July 1950 Although it was intended to put the AMX 50 into production as the standard medium tank of the Western European Union, financial reasons and the arrival of military aid from the United States in the form of 856 M47 Patton tanks caused the original program to be abandoned. In 1951 it was decided to turn the program into a heavy tank project with an even larger [...] tank gun; though three prototypes were built, this too was abandoned in 1956, mainly due to a failure to design a powerful enough engine.|$|E

2500|$|The 747-400ER {{included}} {{the option of}} one or two additional [...] body fuel tanks in the forward cargo hold, however Qantas was the only customer that ordered the single body tank configuration, and no airplanes were delivered with dual body fuel tanks. Manufactured by Marshall Aerospace, these tanks utilized metal to metal honeycomb-bonded technology to achieve a high fuel volume-to-dry weight ratio. The tanks featured a double wall, integrated venting system, and achieve fuel control via a modified Fuel System Management Card (FSMC) which optimizes fuel transfer into the Center Wing Tank (CWT) in flight along with the fuel transfer from the Horizontal Stabiliser Tank (HST). The tank is removable using tooling that interfaces with the cargo <b>loading</b> <b>system.</b> Similar technology has been used by Marshall in the development of body fuel tanks for the Boeing 777-200LR and Boeing P-8A Poseidon. Other changes to the 747-400ER include relocation of oxygen system components and the potable water system tanks and pumps since the body fuel tanks prevent access to the standard locations.|$|E
