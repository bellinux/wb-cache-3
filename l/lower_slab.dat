60|$|Had it {{not been}} for a bootblack at Charing Cross I should {{probably}} never have bought the smoking-table. I had to pass that boy every morning. In vain did I scowl at him, or pass with my head to the side. He always pointed derisively (as I thought) at my boots. Probably my boots were speckless, but that made no difference; he jeered and sneered. I have never hated any one as I loathed that boy, and to escape him I took to going round by the Lowther Arcade. It was here that my eye fell on the smoking-table. In the Lowther Arcade, if the attendants catch you looking at any article for a fraction of a second, it is done up in brown paper, you have paid your money, and they have taken down your address before you realize that you don't want anything. In this way I became the owner of my smoking-table, and when I saw it in a brown-paper parcel on my return to my chambers I could not think what it was until I cut the strings. Such a little gem of a table no smokers should be without; and I am not ashamed to say that I was in love with mine as soon as I had fixed the pieces together. It was of walnut, and consisted mainly of a stalk and two round slabs not much bigger than dinner-plates. There were holes in the centre of these slabs for the stalk to go through, and the one slab stood two feet from the floor, the other a foot higher. The <b>lower</b> <b>slab</b> was fitted with a walnut tobacco-jar and a pipe-rack, while on the upper slab were exquisite little recesses for cigars, cigarettes, matches, and ashes. These held respectively three cigars, two cigarettes, and four wax vestas. The smoking-table was an ornament to any room; and the first night I had it I raised my eyes from my book to look at it every few minutes. I got all my pipes together {{and put them in the}} rack; I filled the jar with tobacco, the recesses with three cigars, two cigarettes, and four matches; and then I thought I would have a smoke. I swept my hand confidently along the mantelpiece, but it did not stop at a pipe. I rose and looked for a pipe. I had half a dozen, but not one was to be seen--none on the mantelpiece, none on the window-sill, none on the hearth-rug, none being used as book-markers. I tugged at the bell till William John came in quaking, and then I asked him fiercely what he had done with my pipes. I was so obviously not to be trifled with that William John, as we called him, because some thought his name was William, while others thought it was John, very soon handed me my favorite pipe, which he found in the rack on the smoking-table. This incident illustrates one of the very few drawbacks of smoking-tables. Not being used to them, you forget about them. William John, however, took the greatest pride in the table, and whenever he saw a pipe lying on the rug he pounced upon it and placed it, like a prisoner, in the rack. He was also most particular about the three cigars, the two cigarettes, and the four wax vestas, keeping them carefully in the proper compartments, where, unfortunately, I seldom thought of looking for them.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Improving {{the steel}} {{properties}} and production processes with reduced energy demand for high strength steels requires improved process control in close {{relation to the}} steel composition. Hot rolling of steel is an energy-intensive process, especially in respect of preheating the steel slabs. The present work was carried out {{with the aim of}} reducing the initial slab temperature {{while at the same time}} improving properties by optimization of the steel composition and process parameters. Optimization of slab reheating and hot rolling parameters in connection with plate and strip rolling was carried out on low C-Mn high-strength steels microalloyed with Mo-Ti-Nb-B, both in laboratory and full scales processing. The effects of a low slab reheating temperature, high finish rolling temperature (FRT) during thermo-mechanical controlled processing (TMCP) and accelerated cooling rates following hot rolling to RT or to the coiling temperature have been investigated. Improvement of yield strength of the plate has been obtained by <b>lowering</b> the <b>slab</b> reheating temperature, especially with high cooling rates (> 20 °C/s) to room temperature. The results obtained for strip steels also show that a reduced reheating temperature combined with high finish rolling temperatures and cooling rates (> 20 °C/s) to a coiling temperature of 450 °C produces very positive microstructures and mechanical properties in the present steels. <b>Lowering</b> the <b>slab</b> reheat temperature reduces energy consumption and accordingly releases less CO 2 into the atmosphere during the thermo-mechanical processing of the present steels...|$|R

40|$|The Southwest Pacific {{region is}} tectonically complex and {{is home to}} {{numerous}} fossil and active subduction zones. At the Earth's surface, there remains a geological controversy regarding the polarity and continuity of fossil subduction zones in New Zealand and New Caledonia, the origin of obducted ophiolites, the presence of high-pressure metamorphism, the occurrence of widespread Cenozoic magmatism, and the potential disappearance {{of one or more}} ocean basins. This controversy can be solved by looking at the lower mantle rather then at the Earth's surface. New P-wave and S-wave mantle tomography models from the Southwest Pacific are presented, which identify a previously unrecognized lower-mantle high-velocity anomaly that cannot be linked to Pacific subduction. The anomaly is located below the Tasman Sea at ~ 1100  km depth, strikes NW-SE and is ~ 2200  km by 600 - 900  km in lateral extent. By combining relative and absolute plate motions it is demonstrated that when the geological structures at the surface are reinterpreted as a single northeast-dipping 2500 -km middle Cenozoic subduction zone (the so-called New Caledonia subduction zone) the lower mantle anomaly can be accounted for, as it is found at the predicted location and depth. Discovery of the <b>lower</b> mantle <b>slab</b> anomaly thereby solves a long-standing geological controversy in the New Zealand-New Caledonia region.

40|$|Abstract. Bioadband S and ScS {{displacement}} pulses from deep-focus earthquakes inthe Sea of Okhotsk, {{recorded at}} analog and digital stations in North America and Europe, show com-plexities produced by velocity heterogeneity inthe <b>lower</b> mantle. The <b>slab</b> beneath the Sea of Okhotsk strikes N 40 øE, while the stations {{used in this}} study range from N 40 øW to N 70 øE, allowing a test of the hypothesis that multipathing ina <b>lower</b> mantle <b>slab</b> extension gives rise to the waveform complexities. Comparisons of the S and ScS displacement pulses at a given station indicate that in many cases the direct S pulses have a broader, more complex waveform than the ScS pulses. We parameterized the waveform complexity by the energy tempo/al centroid ifference (Cs-Csc s) between the S and ScS pulses. The largest Cs-Csc s anomalies are observed along the strike of the slab. There is also a correlation between the Cs-Csc s values and ScS-S travel time residuals for stations along the strike ofthe slab and no correlation for off-strike azimuths. However, Cs-Csc sanomalies are ob-served over the entire azimuth range, including azimuths to the southwestern U. S., for which the raypaths hould quickly exit any deep slab structure. These data suggest hat lateral velocity heterogeneities both near the source (possibly due to slab pene-tration) and deep in the mantle near the S wave turning points contribute to the S and ScS complexity...|$|R

To make receiver functions from tiltmeter data, stacked vertical components of broadband seismograms were used as source-time functions. Since such source-time functions may include biases from local structure, we also produced regional stacked source-time functions.

In the images derived from the receiver-function gathers, we were able to visualize both the oceanic Moho and the <b>lower</b> <b>slab</b> boundary, which could be traced down to depths of 400 km and 600 km, respectively.

40|$|This is {{a survey}} of mantle provinces (large-scale seismic anomalies) under North America, from the surface down to 1500 - 1800 km depth. The {{underlying}} P velocity model was obtained by multifrequency tomography, a waveform-based method that systematically measures and models the frequency-dependence of teleseismic body waves. A novel kind of three-dimensional rendering technique is {{used to make the}} considerable structural complexities under North America accessible. In the transition zone and below, the North American mantle is dominated by seismically fast provinces, which represent distinct subduction episodes of the Farallon plate. I attempt to date and interpret the various slab fragments by reconciling their present positions with paleotrench locations from plate tectonic reconstructions and with major geologic surface episodes. Differences in vertical sinking velocity have led to large vertical offsets across adjacent, coeval slabs. Some of the mantle provinces have not been discussed much previously, including (1) a seismically slow blanket overlying the oldest Farallon subduction along the eastern continental margin, (2) a transition zone slab coeval with the Laramide orogeny (ca. 80 - 60 Myr), which I discuss in analogy to the "stagnant slab" subduction style commonly found in the western Pacific today, (3) the lower mantle root of present-day Cascadia subduction, which may have started out as intraoceanic subduction,(4) a <b>lower</b> mantle <b>slab</b> under Arizona and New Mexico, the last material to subduct before strike-slip motion developed along the San Andreas boundary, and (5) two narrow plate tears thousands of kilometers long, one of which is the subducted conjugate of the Mendocino Fracture Zone.

40|$|Shear wave travel times, amplitudes and {{broadband}} waveforms from 16 {{events in}} the Kurile slab are analyzed to place further constraints on the seismic velocity heterogeneity associated with the subducted oceanic lithosphere. Several previous studies have proposed that the Kurile slab penetrates into the lower mantle with little deformation other than a steepening of the dip angle, while other studies suggest hat strong slab deformations occur with perhaps negligible lower mantle penetration. In an effort to detect any deep slab effects, we compare anomaly patterns covering a 60 ø azimuthal range straddling the strike of the slab for events in three different depth intervals (> 500 km, 350 - 500 km, and 100 - 200 km). S and ScS pulse broadening {{is used as a}} measure of waveform complexity. Complexity of broadband shear waves does not vary systematically across our azimuthal range as the propagation direction changes with respect to the postulated <b>lower</b> mantle <b>slab</b> model for this region. Strong residual sphere travel time variations are found for shear waves from events at all depths; however, these variations do not display the dep{h dependence apparent in previous P wave analysis that has been interpreted as requiring a change in <b>slab</b> geometry and <b>lower</b> mantle penetration. The same S wave residual pattern is apparent in sS depth phases, and is well predicted by a recent model of shear velocity Structure beneath North America. A combination of deep mantle and near-receiver aspherical structure can explain most of our observed shear wave trave...|$|R

These shocks would have gone unnoticed {{if they had not}} occurred beneath habitations and close to the surface, some events being only 200 -m deep. A several months' monitoring of the seismic activity by a 16 -station mobile network showed that earthquakes clustered along a N–S-trending, at least 5 -km long, shallow rupture zone, with no corresponding fault mapped in the surface. Half of the seismic events occurred in a massive, c. 250 -m-thick, <b>Lower</b> Cretaceous limestone <b>slab</b> that outcrops near by. Since the late eighteenth century, several much more severe earthquake swarms have struck Tricastin. The 1772 – 1773 and 1933 – 1936 swarms were prolific and protracted, with reports of numerous detonations and even damage. Obviously, the abnormal noises that caused panic in the past centuries {{can be explained by the}} shallowness of the phenomena, a 200 -m focal depth being perhaps a record value for tectonic earthquakes...|$|R
