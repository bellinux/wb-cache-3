40|$|A close {{examination}} {{is made of}} the conceptual basis underlying a step function {{in order to identify}} the parts of steps and relate them to an economic interpretation. Emphasis is placed on the relevance of (1) the "relation, " "function, " and "discontinuity " definitions, (2) the identity of marginal cost in the steps, and (3) the MR ~ Me profit-maximization criterion to the interpretation. It is contended that, if producers conform to linear programming specifications, their step supply functions should be interpreted as representing a sporadic response which calIs for a modified applicability of elasticity, reversibility, and <b>length-of-run</b> concepts. T E N years ago, Candler [6, pp. 416 - 417] raised the question, "Shouldwe think of a firm's supply function as being smooth or stepped?"! Since then, step functions derived by linear programming have matured into full bloom in supply studies. Now, questions of interpretation are being raised. Does a step supply function have the same conceptual basis as a smooth supply function? Is elasticity a meaningful measure of responsive-ness for step supply functions [2, 10]? Can a step function be converted to...|$|E
40|$|The {{standard}} nonparametric 1 -sample runs test, {{which is}} based on the total number of runs, has recently been found to give anomalous results in the case of data consisting solely of runs of length 2. Furthermore, tests based on the total number of runs provide little information as to the length of the individual runs. An explanation for that anomaly is provided, and tests based on the length of runs are described. Such tests can be successfully applied to runs of length 2 but usually use asymptotic methods of assessing statistical significance. In addition, such tests generally impose arbitrary limits as to the maximum run length. A new procedure that allows the maximum run length to be empirically determined is described. In that procedure, one uses a Monte Carlo permutation test to ascertain statistical significance. The new Monte Carlo omnibus <b>length-of-runs</b> procedure is illustrated with examples from suicide research and from psycholinguistics. status: publishe...|$|R
