5|$|The Line {{was built}} by the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) and opened on 1 December 1909, along with the <b>last</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bergen Line.

It was also possible to reach Oslo from Hønefoss via the Randsfjord Line, albeit terminating at Oslo West Station. NSB also ran a local service between Hønefoss and Oslo along the Roa–Hønefoss Line. Oslo–Bergen trains ran via the Randsfjord Line after 1989 and local train services have been terminated. However, the line remains in use for freight trains along the Oslo–Bergen route.|$|E

5|$|The winning {{time was}} set {{early on in}} the stage, by Cervélo TestTeam rider and reigning Lithuanian {{national}} time trial champion Ignatas Konovalovas. Konovalovas, the 79th man to leave the starthouse, {{was one of the last}} riders to take the course before it started to rain. Garmin's Bradley Wiggins started his ride not long after, and though he had the best time at the second and third intermediate time checks, he was slowed by the rain he encountered on the <b>last</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> course as well as a stopped Bbox Bouygues Telecom team car attending to Matthieu Sprick, who had crashed.|$|E
5|$|By 2005, {{ridership}} {{had increased}} to 2.5 million per year, up 278% from 1991, giving a 7% {{market share in}} the corridor. To further increase capacity and regularity, the Norwegian National Rail Administration decided to rebuild the section from Stavanger to Sandnes to double track. At the same time, a new freight terminal was to be built at Ganddal, meaning that the section would only have to be shared with intercity trains. The upgrade involved closing Hillevåg Station, and building three new stations: Paradis, Jåttåvågen and Gausel. Construction was started in 2006 and {{was estimated to be}} completed by 2009. It was estimated to cost 2.2 billion Norwegian krone. From April to November 2009, the section from Ganddal to Stavanger was closed while the <b>last</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upgrade was completed. The new line was opened on 16 November 2009 and from 14 December, the 15-minute headway was introduced between Stavanger and Sandnes.|$|E
5|$|Caracciola and {{his wife}} Alice {{returned}} to their home in Lugano. For {{the duration of the}} war he was unable to drive; the rationing of petrol meant motor racing was unfeasible. The pain in his leg grew worse, and they went back to the clinic in Bologna to consult a specialist. Surgery was recommended, but Caracciola decided against that option, deterred by the minimum three months it would take to recover from the operation. He spent much of the <b>last</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war—from 1941 onwards—attempting to gain possession of the two W165s used at the 1939 Tripoli Grand Prix, with a view to maintaining them {{for the duration of the}} hostilities.

5|$|Combat {{was also}} criticized. Reviewers called it poor, clumsy, and unsatisfactory, {{complaining}} that Bloodlines favors melee combat; firearms were weak, unwieldy and slow, even for characters specializing in guns. PC Zone, however, called the first-person shooting entertaining and challenging. Although melee combat was criticized as sluggish and difficult due to enemy attacks interrupting the player's, reviewers considered it overpowered; according to GameSpot, a boss character was killed with melee weapons {{on a first}} attempt after the repeated {{failure to do so}} with a gun. The New York Times found the unavoidable combat in the <b>last</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game to be so difficult that they had to cheat to succeed. Stealth was criticized, with IGN noting that even with low stealth skill it was possible to sneak around many enemies and feed from a guard without alerting another guard next to them. GameSpot opined that some of the best missions were stealth-based, as combat was more straightforward.|$|E
5|$|During the snatch {{phase of}} the event, Hale was given three {{attempts}} to lift as much weight as she could in snatches. She successfully lifted 74kilograms on her first attempt and 78 kilograms on her second, but failed to lift 82kilograms on her third and final try. The second and <b>last</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> event included lifting weights using the clean and jerk method. Hale successfully lifted 95kilograms in this manner on her first attempt, but failed to lift 100kilograms on her second and third tries. Her combined score was 173kilograms. This placed the Solomon Islander at twelfth place of the twelve athletes in the event, directly behind the Philippines' eleventh-place finalist Hidilyn Diaz (192kilograms), who in turn ranked behind Poland's tenth-place finalist Marieta Gotfryd (200kilograms). The gold medalist in the event was China's Chen Yanqing, who set an Olympic record with 244kilograms.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1947 {{nationalisation}} of Britain's railways, {{the use of}} {{the railway}} to transport coffins to Brookwood went into steep decline. New operating procedures required that coffins be carried in a separate carriage from other cargo; as regular services to Brookwood station used electric multiple unit trains which did not have goods vans, coffins for Brookwood had to be shipped to Woking and then carried by road for the <b>last</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> journey, or a special train had to be chartered. The last railway funeral to be carried by British Rail anywhere was that of Lord Mountbatten in September 1979, and from 28 March 1988 British Rail formally ceased to carry coffins altogether. Since Mountbatten, the only railway funeral to be held in the United Kingdom has been that of former National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers General Secretary Jimmy Knapp, carried from London to Kilmarnock for burial in August 2001.|$|E

5|$|From 06:00 Wellington was in {{the field}} supervising the {{deployment}} of his forces. At Wavre, the Prussian IV Corps under Bülow was designated to lead the march to Waterloo as it {{was in the}} best shape, not having been involved in the Battle of Ligny. Although they had not taken casualties, IV Corps had been marching for two days, covering the retreat of the three other corps of the Prussian army from the battlefield of Ligny. They had been posted farthest away from the battlefield, and progress was very slow. The roads were in poor condition after the night's heavy rain, and Bülow's men had to pass through the congested streets of Wavre and move 88artillery pieces. Matters were not helped when a fire broke out in Wavre, blocking several streets along Bülow's intended route. As a result, the <b>last</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corps left at 10:00, six hours after the leading elements had moved out towards Waterloo. Bülow's men were followed to Waterloo first by I Corps and then by II Corps.|$|E
5|$|In 1660 the {{population}} of the town (only including the urban parts of the parish) has been estimated at 1,800, which made it the 10th largest town in Devon and Cornwall. The town's population grew to 2,750 by 1750 (meaning it was the 8th largest town) but it then fell rapidly so that it was only 2,275 by 1805 - only the 23rd largest town in Devon and Cornwall. This fall in population, in a period when many other towns grew rapidly, was probably due to the decline in the importance of the cloth trade in this period. The population of the parish changed little {{from the start of the}} 19th century until the 1970s, remaining at around 3,000 (see chart). However it increased rapidly in the <b>last</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century and the start of the 21st. Cullompton's population growth looks set to continue as Mid Devon's core strategy foresees 95 new dwellings being built per year in the period to 2026.|$|E
5|$|In the Early Middle Ages, {{after the}} decline of the Roman Empire, the Adriatic coasts of the region were ruled by Ostrogoths, Lombards, and the Byzantine Empire. The Carolingian Empire arose in the <b>last</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> period and {{subsequently}} the Frankish Kingdom of Italy took control of the Adriatic Sea's western coast extending to the Kvarner Gulf, while Byzantine control of the opposite coast gradually shrunk following the Avar and Croatian invasions starting in the 7th century. The region was gradually incorporated into the medieval Kingdom of Croatia by the 11th century, when the kingdom reached its territorial peak, and the city of Senj became the most important centre of the region. Items of significance to Croatian historical heritage originated from the region in that period. The most notable among them is the Baška tablet, one of the oldest surviving inscriptions in the Croatian language.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} stage, the riders fell {{after only a}} few kilometres. Lipman broke a finger, and became the first rider to abandon this Tour. Around 100km in the race, Lucien Pothier lost ten minutes to the main group, led by Maurice Garin, because of a broken bicycle. In Cosne, at 174km, Pothier had reached the leading group. Aucouturier had lost more than one hour at that point. Just before the next control post in Nevers, Aucouturier fell on his face, and {{continued}} the race covered in blood. In the <b>last</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> race, Maurice Garin and Lucien Pothier rode away from the others. They were attacked by four masked men in a car, but still finished as the first two, with Garin beating Pothier by 50m. The many flat tires and crashes of Aucouturier, seemingly the results of sabotage, gave him a time loss of several hours.|$|E
5|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2015 season, three practice sessions were scheduled, two 1.5-hour sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday. Lewis Hamilton was fastest {{in the first}} free practice session, run in clear and sunny conditions, lapping {{in a time of}} 1m43.754s, over one-tenth of a second faster than teammate Rosberg in second. Rosberg had set new fastest sector times on his last fast run, but a mistake in the <b>last</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> track lost him a chance at the best time. Kimi Räikkönen was third fastest for Ferrari, ahead of Daniil Kvyat. Kvyat's Red Bull teammate Ricciardo changed back to his older specification Renault power unit, after being unsatisfied with the performance of his updated unit at the previous race in Brazil. He finished the session seventh fastest. At Lotus, Jolyon Palmer replaced Romain Grosjean, but had to sit out most of the session due to a water leak, managing just nine laps.|$|E
5|$|The Bryce Canyon area shows {{a record}} of {{deposition}} that spans from the <b>last</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cretaceous period and {{the first half of}} the Cenozoic era. The ancient depositional environment of the region around what is now the park varied. The Dakota Sandstone and the Tropic Shale were deposited in the warm, shallow waters of the advancing and retreating Cretaceous Seaway (outcrops of these rocks are found just outside park borders). The colorful Claron Formation, from which the park's delicate hoodoos are carved, was laid down as sediments in a system of cool streams and lakes that existed from 63 to about 40million years ago (from the Paleocene to the Eocene epochs). Different sediment types were laid down as the lakes deepened and became shallow and as the shoreline and river deltas migrated.|$|E
