5|$|With the Germans mostly {{unable to}} operate and advance {{without the support}} of the {{experienced}} Finnish units, their hope now <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> continuation of the attack led by the Finns themselves. These hopes were soon squashed. Field Marshal Carl Mannerheim, supreme commander of the Finnish forces, insisted on delaying further offensive operations, citing military and logistical reasons. On 17 November, Siilasvuo ordered an immediate stop to the Finnish III Corps' offensive, despite positive feedback from his field commanders that further ground could be taken. This sudden change in Finnish behaviour was, in some part, the result of diplomatic pressure by the United States and Britain. Finland was no longer interested in spearheading such an offensive. With the Finnish refusal to be involved in further offensive operations, Arctic Fox came to an end in November and both sides dug in.|$|E

Equipped mostly with farming equipment, the locals were attacked by the conquest of Islamic armies circa 711 CE and surrendered. Neroon was dethroned.|$|E

25|$|With great difficulty, Lafaille {{managed to}} climb down the 75 degree {{face to the}} pair's last bivouac site, where he found 20 metres of thin rope, {{allowing}} him to make short abseils {{down some of the}} hardest parts. With no technical equipment to use as anchors he was forced to entrust his weight to tent pegs or, on one occasion, a plastic bottle. He finally reached what should have been the relative safety of the top of a fixed rope which he and Beghin had installed on a steep rock band, but almost immediately he was struck by a falling rock, which broke his right arm. Disabled and helpless, he <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> ledge for two days in the hope that other climbers would rescue him. However, while there was a Slovenian team attempting a route on {{a different part of the}} South Face, they judged that a rescue attempt would be too dangerous to undertake, so help never came. The cruellest thing about the ordeal, Lafaille said, was being able to see life in the valley below, and by night, the flashbulbs of trekkers' cameras. In spite of this, he later agreed that the Slovenians had made the right decision in not trying to save him.|$|E
25|$|He {{was born}} on 8 December 65 BC in the Samnite south of Italy. His home town, Venusia, <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> trade route in the border region between Apulia and Lucania (Basilicata). Various Italic dialects were spoken {{in the area and}} this perhaps enriched his feeling for language. He could have been {{familiar}} with Greek words even as a young boy and later he poked fun at the jargon of mixed Greek and Oscan spoken in neighbouring Canusium. Literary Latin must have sounded to him like a semi-foreign language, heard only at school. One of the works he probably studied in school was the Odyssia of Livius Andronicus, crammed into Italian boys with threats and floggings by teachers like the 'Orbilius' mentioned in one of his poems. School was made particularly irksome by a number of his fellow pupils, the overgrown sons of beefy centurions. The army veterans could have been settled there at the expense of local families uprooted by Rome as punishment for their part in the Social War (91â€“88 BC). Such state-sponsored migration must have added still more linguistic variety to the area. According to a local tradition reported by Horace, a colony of Romans or Latins had been installed in Venusia after the Samnites had been driven out early in the third century. In that case, young Horace could have felt himself to be a Roman though there are also indications that he regarded himself as a Samnite or Sabellus by birth. Italians in modern and ancient times have always been devoted to their home towns, even after success in the wider world, and Horace was no different. Images of his childhood setting and references to it are found throughout his poems.|$|E

500|$|Berkhamsted Castle {{was built}} during the Norman conquest of England in 1066. After William the Conqueror {{defeated}} the Anglo-Saxons at the Battle of Hastings he advanced from the coast, across the Thames Valley and north into Hertfordshire. Chroniclers {{suggest that the}} Archbishop of York surrendered to William in Berkhamsted, and William probably ordered {{the construction of the}} castle before proceeding south into London. Berkhamsted was strategically significant, as it <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> key route into the Midlands from London through the Chiltern Hills. The actual construction work was probably overseen by William's half-brother, Robert of Mortain, who owned it {{by the time of the}} writing of the Domesday Book.|$|E
500|$|From 1930 onwards, Reich {{began to}} treat {{patients}} outside {{the limits of}} psychoanalysis's restrictions.

He had noticed that after a successful course of psychoanalysis his patients would hold their bodies differently, so he began to try {{to communicate with the}} body using touch. He asked his male patients to undress down to their shorts, and sometimes entirely, and his female patients down to their underclothes, and began to massage them to loosen their body armour. He would also ask them to simulate physically the effects of certain emotions in the hope of triggering them.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the {{dismantling}} project, there was debate by local residents {{on whether the}} wrecked stern should be removed. Some local officials believed the stern, which <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> remote area of the beach, was not a hazard or an eyesore. Arnie Roblan, a state representative from Coos Bay, called the wreck a potential tourist attraction. For some residents, uncertainty remained surrounding Titan's removal plan, with the worry that the stern {{would be unable to}} withstand the force of the hydraulic pullers and that parts of the ship already buried in the sand would be unmovable. The president of the Coos Bay city council expressed concern that the proposed removal operation could cause ecological damage that would not occur if the ship were left on the beach. He further noted that [...] "shipwrecks on the Oregon Coast are part of our history. There are a lot of ways you could better spend the money here." ...|$|E
500|$|At [...] distant, {{the tsunami}} was {{perceptible}} on the Hawaiian island of Maui at Kahului. The {{location of the}} islands <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> great circle route that is also perpendicular to the region of (presumed) uplifted land at the coast near Cape Mendocino and any energy distributed would be the strongest in that direction. No tsunami was detected [...] at Johnston Atoll, [...] from Cape Mendocino in the north Pacific Ocean, but bottom pressure recorders registered a maximum amplitude of [...] in [...] {{of water in the}} Gulf of Alaska, with 3.75 hours of travel time. While the waves generated by the earthquake were limited, the event demonstrated the rapid onset of tsunami hazards, giving little time for coastal residents to prepare. And in this case, the strongest waves came ashore in Crescent City three to four hours after the initial surge, but it is possible to be just the opposite where the first waves could be the strongest. Also detailed from this event was that the wave hazard can be of long duration, with wave action lingering for more than eight hours.|$|E

500|$|A decade later, a New York Times {{reporter}} {{visiting the}} zoo noted that [...] "...an Asiatic Black Bear <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> rock {{a short distance}} from a guard rail. A shattered wine bottle, a cracked stick, and a number of empty beer cans were strewn about the ground a few feet in front of him. 'How many times have I seen a bear lift his foot and leave a bloody foot print?' said John Kinzig, a park supervisor at the Prospect Park Zoo. 'Vandalism is a major problem, and deterioration is overtaking repairs.'" [...] Activists were pressing for major renovations of the zoo, which, in 1983, was rated by the Humane Society of the United States as one of the [...] "10 worst" [...] zoos in the country. Others felt that a zoo was not in keeping with the original design of Prospect Park and urged its complete removal from the grounds. A fatal accident of an 11-year-old boy scaling the fence to the polar bear pit only served to underscore difficulties with the fifty-year-old facility.|$|E
500|$|Isurava {{sits in a}} {{clearing}} on the first main peak of the Owen Stanleys on the southern route from Kokoda as the track rises towards its highest peak at Mount Bellamy. It is positioned {{to the south of}} Deniki and the north of Alola on a northâ€“south ridgeline. A rest house was positioned about [...] to the south, {{with a view of the}} Eora Valley. To its east, the high ground falls steeply towards the fast-flowing Eora Creek which sits at the bottom of a deep ravine. Isurava <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> spur that jagged west from the Isurava ridgeline towards Eora Creek, and was bounded to the north and south by two small tributaries that cut the track. To the west of Eora Creek on the other side of the steep ravine, opposite Isurava, was the village of Missima. It lay on the slope that rose towards the Abuari ridgeline, sitting astride a smaller parallel track that joined the main Kokoda Track after passing through Abuari and crossing Eora Creek via a log bridge near Alola. Overlooked by a ridge to the north, Isurava was ultimately unsuited to defensive operations. The ridge to its north offered the Japanese artillery, of which at that stage of the campaign they had a significant advantage, the ability to range their fire down on the Australian position. The track to the east of Eora Creek and the track junction around Alola offered the Japanese an easy avenue of advance around the flank towards the Australian rear. Nevertheless, it was chosen over the Isurava rest house position further south when the area was reconnoitred in mid-August by Major Allan Cameron, the brigade major of the 30th Infantry Brigade and temporary commander of the 39th Infantry Battalion.|$|E
