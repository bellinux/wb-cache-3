40|$|In list-method {{directed}} forgetting {{participants are}} cued to intentionally forget a previously studied <b>list</b> (<b>List</b> 1) before encoding a subsequently presented <b>list</b> (<b>List</b> 2). Compared with remember-cued participants, forget-cued participants typically show impaired recall of <b>List</b> 1 and improved recall of <b>List</b> 2, {{referred to as}} <b>List</b> 1 forgetting and <b>List</b> 2 enhancement. In three experiments, we examined how amount of postcue encoding influences directed forgetting. Two results emerged dissociating <b>List</b> 1 forgetting from <b>List</b> 2 enhancement. First, an increase in amount of postcue encoding led {{to an increase in}} <b>List</b> 1 forgetting but did not affect <b>List</b> 2 enhancement. Second, the forget cue influenced all <b>List</b> 1 items but affected only early <b>List</b> 2 items. A two-mechanism account of directed forgetting is suggested, according to which <b>List</b> 1 forgetting reflects reduced accessibility of <b>List</b> 1 items, and <b>List</b> 2 enhancement arises from a reset of encoding processes...|$|R
