5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{medications}} available including phenytoin, carbamazepine and valproate. Low-quality evidence suggests that phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproate may be equally effective in both focal and generalized seizures. Controlled release carbamazepine appears to work as well as immediate release carbamazepine, and may have fewer side effects. In the United Kingdom, carbamazepine or <b>lamotrigine</b> are recommended as first-line treatment for focal seizures, with levetiracetam and valproate as second-line due to issues of cost and side effects. Valproate is recommended first-line for generalized seizures with <b>lamotrigine</b> being second-line. In those with absence seizures, ethosuximide or valproate are recommended; valproate is particularly effective in myoclonic seizures and tonic or atonic seizures. If seizures are well-controlled on a particular treatment, it is not usually necessary to routinely check the medication levels in the blood.|$|E
5|$|Adverse {{effects from}} {{medications}} {{are reported in}} 10 to 90% of people, depending on how and from whom the data is collected. Most adverse effects are dose-related and mild. Some examples include mood changes, sleepiness, or an unsteadiness in gait. Certain medications have side effects that {{are not related to}} dose such as rashes, liver toxicity, or suppression of the bone marrow. Up to a quarter of people stop treatment due to adverse effects. Some medications are associated with birth defects when used in pregnancy. Many of the common used medications, such as valproate, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbitol, and gabapentin have been reported to cause increased risk of birth defects, especially when used during the first trimester. Despite this, treatment is often continued once effective, because the risk of untreated epilepsy is believed to be greater than the risk of the medications. Among the antiepileptic medications, levetiracetam and <b>lamotrigine</b> seem to carry the lowest risk of causing birth defects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lamotrigine</b> {{has been}} {{associated}} with a decrease in white blood cell count (leukopenia). <b>Lamotrigine</b> does not prolong QT/QTc in TQT studies in healthy subjects.|$|E
25|$|These studies {{suggested}} that <b>lamotrigine</b> acts presynaptically on voltage-gated sodium channels to decrease glutamate release. Several electrophysiological studies {{have investigated the}} effects of <b>lamotrigine</b> on voltage-dependent sodium channels. For example, <b>lamotrigine</b> blocked sustained repetitive firing in cultured mouse spinal cord neurons in a concentration-dependent manner, at concentrations that are therapeutically relevant {{in the treatment of}} human seizures. In cultured hippocampal neurons, <b>lamotrigine</b> reduced sodium currents in a voltage-dependent manner, and at depolarised potentials showed a small frequency-dependent inhibition. These {{and a variety of other}} results indicate that the antiepileptic effect of <b>lamotrigine,</b> like that of phenytoin and carbamazepine, is at least in part due to use- and voltage-dependent modulation of fast voltage-dependent sodium currents. However, <b>lamotrigine</b> has a broader clinical spectrum of activity than phenytoin and carbamazepine and is recognised to be protective against generalised absence epilepsy and other generalised epilepsy syndromes, including primary generalised tonic–clonic seizures, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lamotrigine</b> is {{approved}} in the US for maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder and bipolar II disorder. While the anticonvulsants carbamazepine and valproate are predominantly antimanics, <b>lamotrigine</b> {{is most effective}} for preventing the recurrent depressive episodes of bipolar disorder. The drug seems ineffective {{in the treatment of}} current rapid-cycling, acute mania, or acute depression in bipolar disorder; however, it is effective at prevention of or delaying of manic, depressive, or rapid cycling episodes. According to studies in 2007, <b>lamotrigine</b> may treat bipolar depression without triggering mania, hypomania, mixed states, or rapid-cycling.|$|E
25|$|Many {{studies have}} found no {{association}} between <b>lamotrigine</b> exposure in utero and birth defects, while those that have found an association have found only slight associations with minor malformations like cleft palates. Review {{studies have found}} that overall rates of congenital malformations in infants exposed to <b>lamotrigine</b> in utero are relatively low (1-4%), which is similar to the rate of malformations in the general population. It is known that <b>lamotrigine</b> is a weak inhibitor of human dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and other, more powerful, human DHFR inhibitors like methotrexate are known to be teratogenic.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lamotrigine</b> {{does not}} appear to be {{effective}} for neuropathic pain.|$|E
25|$|December 1994 — <b>Lamotrigine</b> was {{approved}} {{for the treatment}} of partial seizures.|$|E
25|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>lamotrigine</b> follow first-order kinetics, with a half-life of 29 {{hours and}} volume of distribution of 1.36 L/kg. <b>Lamotrigine</b> is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration. Its absolute bioavailability is 98% and its plasma Cmax occurs from 1.4 to 4.8 hours. Available {{data indicate that}} its bioavailability is not affected by food. Estimate of the mean apparent volume of distribution of <b>lamotrigine</b> following oral administration ranges from 0.9 to 1.3 L/kg. This is independent of dose and is similar following single and multiple doses in both patients with epilepsy and in healthy volunteers.|$|E
25|$|Sertraline had {{no effect}} on the actions of digoxin and atenolol, which are not metabolized in the liver. Case reports suggest that taking {{sertraline}} with phenytoin or zolpidem may induce sertraline metabolism and decrease its efficacy, and that taking sertraline with <b>lamotrigine</b> may increase the blood level of <b>lamotrigine,</b> possibly by inhibition of glucuronidation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lamotrigine</b> is {{a member}} of the sodium channel {{blocking}} class of antiepileptic drugs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lamotrigine</b> is a phenyltriazine, {{making it}} {{chemically}} distinct from other approved anticonvulsants. It enhances {{the action of}} gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the chief inhibitory neurotransmitter in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS; which consists of the brain and spinal cord). <b>Lamotrigine</b> may also inhibit voltage-gated sodium channels thereby suppressing the release of glutamate and aspartate, two of the dominant excitatory neurotransmitters in the CNS. It is generally accepted {{to be a member of}} the sodium channel blocking class of antiepileptic drugs, but it could have additional actions since it has a broader spectrum of action than other sodium channel antiepileptic drugs such as phenytoin and carbamazepine and is effective in the treatment of the depressed phase of bipolar disorder, whereas other sodium channel blocking antiepileptic drugs are not, possibly on account of its sigma receptor activity. In addition, <b>lamotrigine</b> shares few side-effects with other, unrelated anticonvulsants known to inhibit sodium channels, which further emphasises its unique properties. <b>Lamotrigine</b> is inactivated by glucuronidation in the liver.|$|E
25|$|Bipolar disorder: lithium carbonate, {{antipsychotics}} (like olanzapine or quetiapine), anticonvulsants (like valproic acid, <b>lamotrigine</b> and topiramate).|$|E
25|$|<b>Lamotrigine</b> is metabolized {{predominantly}} by {{glucuronic acid}} conjugation. Its major metabolite is an inactive 2-n-glucuronide conjugate.|$|E
25|$|The {{basis for}} this broader {{spectrum}} of activity of <b>lamotrigine</b> is unknown, but could relate to actions of the drug on voltage-activated calcium channels. <b>Lamotrigine</b> blocks T-type calcium channels weakly, if at all. However, it does inhibit native and recombinant high-voltage–activated calcium channels (N- and P/Q/R-types) at therapeutic concentrations. Whether this activity on calcium channels accounts for lamotrigine's broader clinical spectrum of activity in comparison with phenytoin and carbamazepine remains to be determined.|$|E
25|$|No {{high quality}} {{evidence}} has shown any drug very useful as of 2013. Rufinamide, <b>lamotrigine,</b> topiramate and felbamate may be useful.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lamotrigine</b> {{has also}} {{been found to have}} a role in the {{treatment}} of adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder with comorbid depression.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lamotrigine</b> was {{originally}} brought to market by GlaxoSmithKline's trademarked as Lamictal; it {{also available in}} generic form under many brand names worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Off-label uses {{include the}} {{treatment}} of peripheral neuropathy, trigeminal neuralgia, cluster headaches, migraines, and reducing neuropathic pain. Although a systematic review conducted in 2013 concluded that well-designed clinical trials have shown no benefit for <b>lamotrigine</b> in neuropathic pain. Off-label psychiatric usage includes {{the treatment of}} treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder, depersonalization disorder, hallucinogen persisting perception disorder, schizoaffective disorder, borderline personality disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder. In at least two cases, <b>lamotrigine</b> seemed efficacious for Kleine-Levin syndrome but caused no improvement {{in at least one}} case.|$|E
25|$|In overdose, <b>lamotrigine</b> {{can cause}} {{uncontrolled}} seizures in most people. Reported results in overdoses involving up to 15 g include increased seizures, coma and death.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lamotrigine</b> {{does not}} have {{pronounced}} effects {{on any of the}} usual neurotransmitter receptors (adrenergic, dopamine D1 and D2, muscarinic, GABA, histaminergic H1, serotonin 5-HT2, and N-methyl-D-asparate). Inhibitory effects on 5-HT, norepinephrine, and dopamine transporters are weak. <b>Lamotrigine</b> is a weak inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase, but whether this effect is sufficient to contribute to a mechanism of action or increases risk to the fetus during pregnancy is not known. Early studies of lamotrigine's mechanism of action examined its effects on the release of endogenous amino acids from rat cerebral cortex slices in vitro. As is the case for antiepileptic drugs that act on voltage-dependent sodium channels, <b>lamotrigine</b> inhibited the release of glutamate and aspartate evoked by the sodium-channel activator veratrine and was less effective in the inhibition of acetylcholine or GABA release. At high concentrations, it had no effect on spontaneous or potassium evoked amino acid release.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lamotrigine,</b> {{originally}} {{marketed as}} Lamictal and available under many brands worldwide, is an anticonvulsant drug {{used in the}} treatment of epilepsy and bipolar disorder. For epilepsy, it is used to treat focal seizures, primary and secondary tonic-clonic seizures, and seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Like the anticonvulsant medications carbamazepine and valproate, <b>lamotrigine</b> also seems to act as an effective mood stabilizer, and was the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug for this purpose since lithium, a drug approved almost 30 years earlier. It is approved for the maintenance treatment of bipolar type II.|$|E
25|$|Mood {{stabilizers}} (used {{primarily to}} treat Bipolar disorder) such as lithium or <b>lamotrigine</b> {{may be of}} some use to help depressed or labile periods, as well as rapid changes in mood.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lamotrigine</b> {{was first}} marketed in the UK in 1991 and first US FDA {{approved}} in 1994. It {{is on the}} World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lamotrigine</b> {{has fewer}} drug {{interactions}} than many anticonvulsant drugs, although pharmacokinetic interactions with carbamazepine, phenytoin and other hepatic enzyme inducing medications may shorten half-life. Dose adjustments {{should be made}} on clinical response, but monitoring may be of benefit in assessing compliance.|$|E
25|$|Less than 1% of {{primidone}} {{users will}} experience a rash. Compared to carbamazepine, <b>lamotrigine,</b> and phenytoin, {{this is very}} low. The rate is {{comparable to that of}} felbamate, vigabatrin, and topiramate. Primidone also causes exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.|$|E
25|$|There {{is also an}} {{increased}} incidence of these eruptions in patients who are currently on, or recently discontinued a valproate-type anticonvulsant drug, as these medications interact {{in such a way}} that the clearance of both is decreased and the effective dose of <b>lamotrigine</b> is increased.|$|E
25|$|A 2013 review about <b>lamotrigine</b> {{concluded}} that it is recommended in bipolar maintenance when depression is prominent and that {{more research is needed}} in regards to its role in the treatment of acute bipolar depression and unipolar depression. Furthermore, no information to recommend its use in other psychiatric disorders was found.|$|E
25|$|Benign {{myoclonus}} {{can occur}} in healthy individuals and is most commonly caused by nothing other than arbitrary muscle contractions. Myoclonus may develop in response to infection, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, head or spinal cord injury, stroke, stress, brain tumors, kidney or liver failure, lipid storage disease, chemical or drug poisoning, as {{a side effect of}} certain drugs (such as tramadol, quinolones, benzodiazepine, gabapentin, sertraline, <b>lamotrigine),</b> or other disorders.|$|E
25|$|Concerns exist when ginseng is used chronically, {{potentially}} causing {{side effects}} such as headaches, insomnia, and digestive problems. The risk of interactions between ginseng and prescribed medications {{is believed to}} be low, but ginseng may have adverse effects when used with the blood thinner, warfarin. Ginseng has been shown to have adverse drug reactions with phenelzine. A potential interaction has also been reported with imatinib, resulting in hepatotoxicity, and with <b>lamotrigine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ample {{supporting}} animal {{evidence and}} human case reports show successful {{use in this}} way. In the UK, efforts {{have been made to}} publicise this use more widely and lipid rescue has now been officially promoted as a treatment by the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland. One published case has been reported of successful treatment of refractory cardiac arrest in bupropion and <b>lamotrigine</b> overdose using lipid emulsion.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lamotrigine</b> is {{approved}} in the US {{for the treatment}} of partial seizures. It is considered a first-line drug for primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures (includes simple partial, complex partial and secondarily generalised seizures), and as an adjuvant therapy in partial seizures (focal onset tonic-clonic, atypical absence, myoclonic, and due to Lennox-Gastaut syndrome). As well, it is used as an alternative drug for absence seizure and atypical absence, myoclonic, and atonic seizures.|$|E
25|$|Motte {{reported}} in 1997 that <b>lamotrigine</b> {{was effective in}} the treatment of LGS, with the most common side effect in the treatment group relative to placebo being colds or viral illnesses. Two years later, it was approved by Health Canada for adjunctive therapy in Lennox Gastaut in adults and children.Sharing' News |accessdate=13 November 2005}} The United States Food and Drug Administration approved it for that in August 1998.|$|E
25|$|Licensed for {{generalized}} tonic-clonic {{and complex}} partial seizures in the United Kingdom. In the United States, primidone is approved for adjunctive (in {{combination with other}} drugs) and monotherapy (by itself) use in generalized tonic-clonic seizures, simple partial seizures, and complex partimple partial seizures, and myoclonic seizures. In juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), it is a second-line therapy, reserved for when the valproates and/or <b>lamotrigine</b> do not work and when other second-line therapiesacetazolamid work either.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lamotrigine</b> can {{induce a}} type of seizure known as a myoclonic jerk, which tends to happen soon after {{the use of the}} medication. When used in the {{treatment}} of myoclonic epilepsies such as juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, lower doses (and lower plasma levels) are usually needed, as even moderate doses of this drug can induce seizures, including tonic-clonic seizures, which can develop into status epilepticus, which is a medical emergency. It can also cause myoclonic status epilepticus.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, primidone, {{along with}} phenobarbital, was a second-line agent in partial {{epilepsy}} {{with or without}} secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures {{and was one of}} four agents (the others being carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital) that was used along with ethosuximide or a benzodiazepine for any absence or myoclonic seizures when valproate failed to control tonic-clonics (at least in the United States). After zonisamide, other new anticonvulsants came onto the market: felbamate, gabapentin, <b>lamotrigine,</b> and vigabatrin. All four were structurally distinct both from other anticonvulsants already on the market. They all had larger protective indexes than conventional agents and unlike these agents, the new ones did not cause birth defects in laboratory animals or antagonize folic acid. They seemed to be relatively mild in terms of side effects. Out of all of them <b>lamotrigine</b> was the most similar to phenytoin in its pattern of efficacy. Felbamate was the most effective for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and was seen as a second-line agent in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy after valproate. These new agents were aggressively marketed. In 1994, felbamate became the anticonvulsant of last resort after ten people out of 100,000 came down with aplastic anemia.|$|E
