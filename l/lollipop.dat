5|$|Support for {{the protests}} started to {{extend to the}} local {{community}} when Jean Gosling, a <b>lollipop</b> lady in Wanstead, upon learning of the tree's impending destruction, rallied the support of local children (and was later fired from her job for doing so while wearing her uniform), who in turn recruited their parents into the protests. It was then that the non-resident radicals realised that they had significant local support. When local residents gathered for a tree dressing ceremony on 6 November, they found their way barred by security fencing. With support from the protesters, they pulled it down.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a scene of red nail polish {{dripping}} from a bottle. It then cuts to Buchanan, who is lying and tapping her foot against the floor. She begins to start feeling her body. In the next scene, Range is seen {{standing in front of}} a mirror with a red <b>lollipop,</b> where she later begins to dance against the sink. Next, all the Sugababes are featured in separate toilet cubicles where they have their hands against the walls. The video cuts to Berrabah walking towards a hand dryer, which she rotates towards her face, causing her hair to be blown.

Later, Buchanan, Range and Berrabah are featured in front of red curtains with traditional silver, gold and black outfits, respectively. The final scene shows the group in front of the cubicles where they begin dancing robotically.|$|E

5|$|Ferrari ordered Massa {{to reduce}} his car speed on his out-lap to help Alonso {{minimise}} the effects of losing second position. Glock drove back to his pit box where his mechanics examined his car for damage and decided to retire him from the race. Kubica avoided making contact with Sutil when his <b>lollipop</b> man stopped him before he could drive away from his pit box. It {{was the second time}} that season Kubica and Sutil were involved in an incident in a pit lane; Kubica had made contact with Sutil when the latter was driving into his pit box in the Hungarian Grand Prix. The safety car drove into the pit lane {{at the end of the}} thirty-fourth lap and Vettel led at the restart. Hamilton ran deep, heading into the first corner and allowing Alonso to retake second position and immediately came under attack from Massa. Kubica took eighth place from Hülkenberg by taking the inside line at the third corner. Sutil took to the inside line and passed Button for twelfth on lap thirty-six. Button was pushed wide onto the run-off area and fell to fifteenth position.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Sing {{engineers}} his and Bones {{escape from}} confinement, and Sum is impressed, offering them {{membership in the}} Gang if they can kill a person. Sing and Bone attempt to kill the Landlady, but their plan backfires, and Sing barely escapes from the Landlady's wrath. Seeking safety in a traffic pulpit, Sing is surprised as his body rapidly heals from the injuries sustained in the escape, the pain causing him to strike {{the sides of the}} pulpit with extreme force, covering the surface in indentations. Later, he attempts to mug an ice cream vendor, who {{turns out to be the}} mute girl; she offers him a <b>lollipop</b> but he knocks it away, humiliated at himself. After sending Bone away, blaming his failure on Bone, Sing is bought before Sum. Sum wants Sing to use his escape skills to free a legendary fighter, the Beast, from a mental asylum to use against Pig Sty Alley, offering Sing membership in the Gang for doing so. Upon being released, the Beast appears to be a middle-aged, slovenly, and flippant man, but is quickly shown to be a formidable and ruthless fighter.|$|E
