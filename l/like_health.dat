5|$|In 2012, {{during the}} {{contract}} {{negotiations between the}} city the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU), compromise {{could not be reached}} over issues <b>like</b> <b>health</b> insurance increases, teacher evaluations, and seniority pay increases. On August 8, 2012, the CTU voted 90% to authorize a strike. On September 10, the CTU began a strike after CTU President Lewis declared that negotiations with the city were not succeeding. On September 14, the CTU reached a tentative agreement with the city which included preferences for teachers who have been laid off due to a school closing to be hired in another school and student test scores having less of a role in teacher evaluations than the city had originally planned. This tentative agreement did not hold, and the strike continued, after which Emanuel announced his intention to seek a legal injunction, forcing teachers back to work. On September 17, Emanuel's efforts to end the strike stalled as the walkout went into the second week. Delegates from the CTU voted to end the strike on September 18, 2012, and students began their return to the schools the following day.|$|E

25|$|What {{is clear}} is that Harappan society was not entirely peaceful, with the human {{skeletal}} remains demonstrating some of the highest rates of injury (15.5%) found in South Asian prehistory. Paleopathological analysis demonstrated that leprosy and tuberculosis were present at Harappa, with the highest prevalence of both disease and trauma present in the skeletons from Area G (an ossuary located south-east of the city walls). Furthermore, rates of cranio-facial trauma and infection increased through time demonstrating that the civilization collapsed amid illness and injury. The bioarchaeologists who examined the remains have suggested that the combined evidence for differences in mortuary treatment and epidemiology indicate that some individuals and communities at Harappa were excluded from access to basic resources <b>like</b> <b>health</b> and safety, a basic feature of hierarchical societies world-wide.|$|E

25|$|Business {{enterprises}} contributed 59.1 % of US GERD in 2012, {{down from}} 69.0 % in 2000. Private non-profits and foreign entities each contribute {{a small fraction}} of total R, 3.3% and 3.8% respectively. The USA has historically been a leader in business R and innovation. The economic recession of 2008–2009 has had a lasting impact, however. While the major performers of R largely maintained their commitments, the pain of the US recession was felt mainly by small businesses and start-ups. Statistics released by the US Census Bureau showed that, in 2008, the number of business ‘deaths’ began overtaking the number of business ‘births’ and that the trend continued at least through 2012. From 2003 to 2008, business research spending had followed a generally upward trajectory. In 2009, the curve inverted, as expenditure fell by 4% over the previous year then again in 2010, albeit by 1–2% this time. Companies in high-opportunity industries <b>like</b> <b>health</b> care cut back less than those in more mature industries, such as fossil fuels. The largest cutbacks in R spending were in agriculture production: -3.5% compared to the average R to net sales ratio. The chemicals and allied products industry and electronic equipment industry, on the other hand, showed R to net sales ratios that were 3.8% and 4.8% higher than average. Although the amount of R spending increased in 2011, it was still below the level of 2008 expenditure. By 2012, the growth rate of business-funded R had recovered. Whether this continues will be contingent on the pursuit of economic recovery and growth, levels of federal research funding and the general business climate.|$|E

500|$|Writing for Rock, Paper, Shotgun, Robert Florence {{praised the}} app for calculating {{variables}} like movement range and tracking statistics <b>like</b> <b>health</b> and ability cooldowns, but {{spoke of a}} disconnect caused by constantly shifting focus between the screen and the board. While ultimately questioning {{the need for the}} physical components at all, Florence also saw the game as having potential in the future. Chris Hutton of Tom's Guide took a much more negative view. Hutton found it cumbersome that the starter kit came with only one stylus and that only one device running the app could be synced to a given game at a time, necessitating that the screen and stylus be passed back and forth between players. He also found the stylus itself to be unresponsive, slowing the game down to the point that he lost interest. VentureBeats Jay Henningsen, on the other hand, had nothing but praise for the app and stylus. After fifteen minutes he found using the stylus to be [...] "almost natural", and found that the app handling all of the rules and stat-keeping made for [...] "one of the easiest experiences I’ve ever had getting into a new game". He {{went on to say that}} players will look to see the technology spread to other miniature wargaming products.|$|E

2500|$|Paul Krugman {{wrote in}} November 2014 that: [...] "The basic story of {{political}} polarization {{over the past}} few decades is that, as a wealthy minority has pulled away economically from the rest of the country, it has pulled one major party along with it...Any policy that benefits lower- and middle-income Americans at the expense of the elite – <b>like</b> <b>health</b> reform, which guarantees insurance to all and pays for that guarantee in part with taxes on higher incomes – will face bitter Republican opposition." [...] He used environmental protection as another example, which was not a partisan issue in the 1990s but has since become one.|$|E
2500|$|Keynesian {{economic}} theory has {{played an important}} role in the economic philosophy of modern American liberals. Modern American liberals generally believe that national prosperity requires government management of the macroeconomy, in order to keep unemployment low, inflation in check, and growth high. They also value institutions that defend against economic inequality. In The Conscience of a Liberal Paul Krugman writes: [...] "I believe in a relatively equal society, supported by institutions that limit extremes of wealth and poverty. I believe in democracy, civil liberties, and the rule of law. That makes me a liberal, and I'm proud of it." [...] Liberals often point to the widespread prosperity enjoyed under a mixed economy in the years since World WarII. They believe liberty exists when access to necessities <b>like</b> <b>health</b> care and economic opportunity are available to all, and they champion the protection of the environment.|$|E
2500|$|Stanhope {{asserted}} in a Letter to the People of the ACT, {{that this}} is the [...] "first time in 17 years that any ACT Government has embarked on strategic and structural reform of this magnitude." [...] He asserts that demographic shifts have led to 18,000 empty desks in ACT government schools and that it costs up to $10,000 more per year to educate children in schools with low enrolments, compared with a child at a school which is at or near capacity. [...] Quoting figures from the Commonwealth Grants Commission, Stanhope argues that [...] "it costs some 20% more, across the board, to deliver basic services <b>like</b> <b>health</b> and education in the ACT than the national average.". [...] The budget announcements have provoked strong criticism from the ACT Council of Parents and Citizens Associations, Australian Education Union ACT branch, [...] the ACT Opposition and members of the public.|$|E

2500|$|In 2012, Price {{sought the}} {{position}} of Republican Conference Chairman, which would have made him the fourth highest ranking Republican in the House. He was endorsed by Ryan, {{as well as by}} the Tea Party-affiliated organization FreedomWorks, conservative political commentator Erick Erickson, future Vice-President and then-governor of Indiana Mike Pence, and outgoing Republican Conference Chairman Jeb Hensarling. Ryan said of Price, [...] "He was instrumental in drafting our House Republican budget. His vocal leadership on issues <b>like</b> <b>health</b> care, tax reform, and fiscal matters has been vital to our messaging and policy efforts. No one will work harder than Congressman Price at building a strong and compelling communications and policy strategy that reflects the will of our membership and the needs of the nation." [...] Although then-Speaker of the House John Boehner did not publicly endorse anyone in the race, he was seen as preferring Price's challenger for the position, Cathy McMorris Rodgers, and offered Price a separate position if he dropped out of the race for Conference Chairman - Price turned down the offer. He lost the election to McMorris Rodgers in November.|$|E
2500|$|In general, Kuznets curves {{have been}} found for some {{environmental}} health concerns (such as air pollution) but not for others (such as landfills and biodiversity). Advocates of the EKC argue that this does not necessarily invalidate the hypothesis – {{the scale of the}} Kuznets curves may differ for different environmental impacts and different regions. If the search for scalar and regional effects can salvage the concept, it may yet be the case that a given area will need more wealth in order to see a decline in environmental pollutants. In contrast, a thermodynamically enlightened economics suggests that outputs of degraded matter and energy are an inescapable consequence of any use of matter and energy (so holds the second law); some of those degraded outputs will be noxious wastes, and whether and how their production is eliminated depends more on regulatory schemes and technologies at use than on income or production levels. [...] In one view, then, the EKC suggests that [...] "the solution to pollution is more economic growth;" [...] in the other, pollution is seen as a regrettable output that should be reduced when the benefits brought by its production are exceeded by the costs it imposes in externalities <b>like</b> <b>health</b> decrements and loss of ecosystem services.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the end of}} DADT, {{approximately}} 114,000 servicemembers who {{had been}} separated from military service since WW II under the categories [...] "other than honorable discharge", [...] "general discharge", or [...] "dishonorable discharge" [...] became eligible to have their discharges amended. Those without an honorable discharge are often excluded from veterans benefits <b>like</b> <b>health</b> care and tuition assistance, {{and the lack of}} an honorable discharge can create a hurdle to employment in the civilian sector as well. The Armed Forces established procedures for processing such requests through the Military Department Board for Correction of Military/Naval Records or the Military Department's Discharge Review Board. In June 2013, after advocates for gay and lesbian veterans complained about the process, Representatives Mark Pocan (D-Wisconsin) and Charles Rangel (D-New York) introduced the Restore Honor to Service Members Act in the House of Representatives to codify the process and reduce inconsistencies. Pocan said the legislation represented the same policies as those currently in place, but was needed because [...] "without having it in law, it could change at some date in the future with a different administration." [...] The American Bar Association endorsed the legislation on November 21, 2013. On January 30, 2014, Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) introduced the same legislation in the Senate.|$|E
