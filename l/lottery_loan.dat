40|$|In the 18 th century Holland and England used, {{among other}} tools, lottery loans to raise capital. This thesis {{examines}} what lottery loans are, {{why they were}} organized, and who invested in them. It will do so by studying the first <b>lottery</b> <b>loan</b> of Holland of 1711. The thesis {{will argue that the}} lottery loans were only issued in times of great financial distress. In 1711 wealthy investors demanded higher interest payments than the payments on the ordinary bonds of Holland. The province was forced to listen to the market, and issued a <b>lottery</b> <b>loan,</b> which was more profitable to the investors. We will see that most of the tickets were bought by wealthy investors, who were part of the regent class and had acces the capital market...|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s Battle Sr. was worried again when {{several of his}} {{associates}} were indicted. So he fled to Lima, Peru where he built a hotel and casino complex. But when the smoke settled he moved back to his $1.5 million Florida ranch. The Corporation was making hundreds of millions from gambling, racketeering, illegal <b>lottery</b> and <b>loan</b> sharking, and operated in the US, Central- and South America, the Caribbean, and Europe.|$|R
50|$|Palmer {{returned}} to Europe, staying in Paris {{for a time}} before being convinced to return to Greece {{in the autumn of}} 1929 and commence the planning of the second Delphic Festival. It is unclear if the issue of the Delphic Lottery and the Ministry of the Navy was resolved and how the festival would be paid for; if by the <b>lottery,</b> <b>loans</b> or by Palmer's own money. Her concerns regarding debt still owed from the first festival lend evidence to the unlikelihood she had sufficient funds herself to pay for all the costs of a second festival. Nevertheless she {{returned to}} Greece and planning for the second festival began. She and Sikelianos decided on The Suppliants as the featured play. This play featured the Greek Chorus as the centerpiece and antagonist of the play, and as such she dove into the preparations fully. Fifty chorus performers were needed and unlike the early struggles of the first festival, volunteers were plenty and enthusiastic. The Greek Ministry of War also again provided ready support in men and materials for the festival. The irony of this was not lost on Palmer. Though such an organization was preoccupied with the business of war, the very antithesis of the Delphic Idea, she reasoned who more than any knew the horrors of war than soldiers.|$|R
50|$|Metro has {{proposed}} a 600-room hotel adjacent to the Convention Center, to be built by Mortenson Construction, then owned and operated as a Hyatt Regency. The $212 million hotel would be partially paid for by Metro using $60 million in revenue bonds and $18 million from Oregon <b>Lottery</b> funds, <b>loans,</b> and grants. The plan has attracted criticism from existing hoteliers as being an unfair subsidy, while Metro has championed {{it as a way}} to attract larger conventions. Suits from opponents were rejected in county courts, and in May 2015, the Oregon Legislature authorized Metro to issue the bonds.|$|R
5000|$|Stephan Keglevich {{became the}} {{youngest}} member of the Hungarian Parliament in 1861 at an age of 21. In 1867 he laid back his parliamentary mandate on the same day as Gyula Andrássy became Prime Minister, and he began to take care about the economy of his goods. In 1873 he went bankrupt at the Vienna stock market crash (see Panic of 1873), he was in debt to his wife, his children and his relatives, who had taken over the third-largest bank in Hungary, the bankruptcy estate was auctioned until 1890. He started in 1873 from zero. He gave out <b>lottery</b> - <b>loans</b> again as before in 1847, which were covered with all his assets, which, however, was zero at this time, what, may be, not everyone knew. He became very successful. He was the Intendant of the National Theater in Budapest 1886-1887. He became again a member of the Parliament. In 1895 he proved with arguments the permission of the state to reform the marriage law, that also Christians compels to the form of the civil marriage at the registry office, because it was in his opinion not a question of the freedom of conscience. He inferred from this a necessity to reform the Upper House of the Parliament. In 1905 he was killed in a duel by another member of the Parliament.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{identifies}} {{the relative importance}} of human and physical capital for entrepreneurship. A subset of rural microfinance clients were offered eight full time days of business training and the opportunity to participate in a <b>loan</b> <b>lottery</b> of up to Rs. 100, 000 (USD 1, 700), about seven times the average loan size. The study finds that business training increased business knowledge, reduced business failure, improved business practices and increased household expenditures by about $ 40 per year. It also improved financial and labor allocation decisions. These effects are concentrated among male clients, however. Women improve business knowledge but show no improvements in other outcomes. A cost-benefit analysis suggests that business training was not cost-effective for the microfinance institution, despite having a positive impact on clients. This may explain why so few microfinance institutions offer training. Access to the larger loan, in contrast, had little effect, indicating that existing loan size limits may already meet the demand for credit for these clients...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} social and financial activities of Buddhist nuns to demonstrate how and why they deployed Buddhist doctrines, rituals, legends, and material culture to interact with society outside the convent. By examining {{the activities of the}} nuns of the Daihongan convent (one of the two administrative heads of the popular pilgrimage temple, Zenkōji) in Japan’s early modern period (roughly 1550 to 1868) as documented in the convent’s rich archival sources, I shed further light on the oft-overlooked political and financial activities of nuns, illustrate how Buddhist institutions interacted with the laity, provide further nuance to the discussion of how Buddhist women navigated patriarchal sectarian and secular hierarchies, and, within the field of Japanese history, give voice to women who were active outside of the household unit around which early modern Japanese society was organized. Zenkōji temple, surrounded by the mountains of Nagano, has been one of Japan’s most popular pilgrimage sites since the medieval period. The abbesses of Daihongan, one Zenkōji’s main sub-temples, traveled widely to maintain connections with elite and common laypeople, participated in frequent country-wide displays of Zenkōji’s icon, and oversaw the creation of branch temples in Edo (now Tokyo), Osaka, Echigo (now Niigata), and Shinano (now Nagano). The abbesses of Daihongan were one of only a few women to hold the imperially sanctioned title of eminent person (shōnin 上人) and to wear purple robes. While this means that this Pure Land convent was in some ways not representative of all convents in early modern Japan, Daihongan’s position is particularly instructive because the existence of nuns and monks in a single temple complex allows us to see in detail how monastics of both genders interacted in close quarters. This work draws heavily from the convent’s archival materials, which I used as a guide in framing my dissertation chapters. In the Introduction I discuss previous works on women in Buddhism. In Chapter 1, I briefly discuss the convent’s history and its place within the Zenkōji temple complex. In Chapter 2, I examine the convent’s regular economic bases and its expenditures. In Chapter 3, I highlight Daihongan’s branch temples and discuss the ways that they acted as nodes in a network connecting people in various areas to Daihongan and Zenkōji, thus demonstrating how a rural religious center extended its sphere of influence in urban settings. In Chapter 4, I discuss the nuns’ travels throughout the country to generate new and maintain old connections with the imperial court in Kyoto, confraternities in Osaka, influential women in the shogun’s castle, and commoners in Edo. In Chapter 5, I examine the convent’s reliance upon irregular means of income such as patronage, temple <b>lotteries,</b> <b>loans,</b> and displays of treasures, and how these were needed to balance irregular expenditures such as travel and the maintenance or reconstruction of temple buildings. Throughout the dissertation I describe Daihongan’s inner social structure comprised of abbesses, nuns, and administrators, and its local emplacement within Zenkōji and Zenkōji’s temple lands. Exploring these themes sheds light on the lives of Japanese Buddhist nuns in this period. While the tensions between freedom and agency {{on the one hand and}} obligations to patrons, subordination to monks, or gender- and status-based restrictions on the other are important, and I discuss them in my work, my primary focus is on the nuns’ activities and lives. Doing so demonstrates that nuns were central figures in ever-changing economic and social networks as they made and maintained connections with the outside world through Buddhist practices and through precedents set centuries before. This research contributes to our understanding of nuns in Japan’s early modern period and will participate in and shape debates on the roles of women in patriarchal religious hierarchies.
