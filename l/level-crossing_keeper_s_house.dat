5000|$|Calbourne and Shalfleet railway station, was an {{intermediate}} [...] station of the Freshwater, Yarmouth and Newport Railway, incorporated in 1860, opened over a ten-month period between 1889 and 1889 and closed 65 years later. Situated {{between the two}} villages [...] and serving a moderately populous rural area [...] it was a [...] "reasonably" [...] successful station on an ultimately unprofitable line. Originally the station had a cottage style front but after absorption by the Southern a corrugated building from the acrimonious-split era was relocated to the site. The station itself, situated on the down side, has long been demolished and replaced with a modern bungalow; but the <b>level-crossing</b> <b>keeper’s</b> cottage, {{a short distance away}} at Pounds Lane, is still visitable.|$|R
50|$|As president, his {{eccentric}} behaviour {{caused some}} consternation; on one occasion, after {{a delegation of}} schoolgirls had presented him with a bouquet, he tossed the flowers back at them one by one. On another occasion he received the British Ambassador to France naked except for the ceremonial decorations of his office. It all culminated when, late one night, 24 May 1920, he fell out of a large window of the presidential train near Montargis after taking some sleeping pills and was found wandering in his nightshirt by a platelayer, who {{took him to the}} nearest <b>level-crossing</b> <b>keeper's</b> cottage. Soon afterwards, Deschanel walked out of a state meeting, straight into a lake, fully clothed. His resignation was offered on 21 September 1920, and he was placed in an institution. Nevertheless, he was narrowly elected to the senate in January 1921, serving until his death.|$|R

The Mother 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>House</b> facility {{has been used}} to house antepartum women on hospital property as an alternative to inpatient management. This study looked at the cost effectiveness of this facility. Study Design A retrospective chart review on occupants (n = 3 D 111) of the Mother 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>House</b> from 2003 - 2005 was performed. Admission, discharge, and outcome data were collected.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{existence}} of a U. <b>S.</b> <b>house</b> price bubble. Specifically, we focus on the time series statistical relationship between real U. <b>S.</b> and regional <b>house</b> prices and a number of fundamental economic variables related to house prices using quarterly data from the first quarter of 1975 through the second-quarter of 2005, the approximate end of the recent house price rise. We find that U. <b>S.</b> <b>house</b> prices and our fundamental economic variables are unit root variables that are not cointegrated, even after allowing for structural breaks. Thus our analysis confirms the existence of an interesting and important anomaly suggested by some prior research on this period. We then discuss the implications of our results for the common practice of using error correction models of house prices, and for the current policy debate regarding the causes of the recent U. <b>S.</b> <b>housing</b> market collapse.

40|$|Abstract: The U. <b>S.</b> <b>house</b> {{price boom}} {{has been linked}} to an {{unsustainable}} easing of mortgage lending standards. However, time series models of U. <b>S.</b> <b>house</b> prices ignore changes in mortgage lending standards and perform poorly in the 2000 s. We incorporate data on mortgage standards for first time buyers into a model of US house prices based on the (inverted) demand for housing services. Our first time buyer loan-to-value series is weakly exogenous. It captures shifts in the supply of mortgage credit and not expectations of future house price appreciation. Using this series, we estimate a U. <b>S.</b> <b>house</b> price equation that yields a stable long-run cointegrating relationship, plausible income and price elasticities and an improved fit. Our findings suggest that swings in credit standards played a major, if not the major, role in driving the recent boom and bust in U. <b>S.</b> <b>house</b> prices...|$|R

40|$|Housing {{and land}} prices in China have {{increased}} continuously and dramatically {{for the past}} two decades. In fact, housing price growth has significantly outstripped income growth.

40|$|The key aim of {{this project}} carried out by Terry Burke and Robin Zhakarov {{was to develop a}} small number of {{scenarios}} about the nature of Australia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>housing</b> system at a specified future date. As such, the project involved the development of a significant exercise in strategic foresight about alternative futures for Australia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>housing,</b> the conditions and policies which would support these futures, and the implications for research and policy. The project drew on the literature and experiences of the field of foresight studies, a creative field of investigation, analysis and postulation to develop scenarios that help prepare organisations and nations for possibilities and challenges. The project applied foresight methodology to the issues of Australia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> broader <b>housing</b> system, examining the effect of major economic, technological and social trends, and exploring alternative policy pathways on a future housing system. In analysing the implications of scenarios, questions of winners and losers, impact on ecologically sustainable communities and implications for and impacts of government interventions are explored. A secondary aim of the project was to run a collaborative dialogue across a wide range of players in housing policy in all sectors, particularly those within AHURI. Questions that emerged from this project are: What do we understand are the key trends and influences on Australia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>housing</b> system? What are the interrelationships between key trends and influences on Australia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>housing</b> system? What possibilities can we anticipate for Australia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>housing</b> system in the next 10, 20 or 30 years?

We start by reviewing the history of the GSEs and their contributions to the operation of U. <b>S.</b> <b>housing</b> and mortgage markets, including the actions that led to their failure in conjunction with the recent mortgage market crisis. The reform options we consider include those proposed in a 2011 U. S.
