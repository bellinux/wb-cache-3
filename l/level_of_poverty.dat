25|$|In Metropolitan Lima in 2013, the {{percentage}} of the population living in households in poverty was 12.8%. The <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> is measured by households that are unable to access a basic food and other household goods and services, such as clothing, housing, education, transportation and health. The <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> has decreased from 2011 (15.6%) and 2012 (14.5%). Lima Sur is the area in Lima with the highest proportion of poverty (17.7%), followed by Lima Este (14.5%), Lima Norte (14.1%) and Lima Centro (6.2%). In addition 0.2% of the population lives in extreme poverty, meaning that they are unable to access a basic food basket.|$|E
25|$|The <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> in Tanzania is very high. Tanzania {{has made}} little {{progress}} towards reducing extreme hunger and malnutrition. The 2010 Global Hunger Index ranks {{the situation as}} “alarming”. Children in rural areas suffer substantially higher rates of malnutrition and chronic hunger, although urban-rural disparities have narrowed as regards both stunting and underweight. Low rural sector productivity arises mainly from inadequate infrastructure investment; limited access to farm inputs, extension services and credit; limited technology as well as trade and marketing support; and heavy dependence on rain-fed agriculture and natural resources.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Comparisons <b>of</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> across {{contexts}} and circumstances overlook the composi-tion {{and characteristics of}} the domain of non-poor. But implications <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> in terms <b>of</b> compro-mised welfare {{as well as its}} potential for alleviation do depend on the structure and composition of the non-poor. On this premise, this note empirically illustrates a contrast between the <b>levels</b> and burden <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> for Indian states. It finds that burden <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> is not linear with <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> implying that similar <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> have differential potential for its alleviation...|$|R

25|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, Union-Miles Park {{had become a}} {{transitional}} neighborhood. As poor African Americans in the Kinsman neighborhood achieved a measure of financial stability and wealth, they moved into Union-Miles Park. As working-class African Americans moved into the middle class, they left Union-Miles Park for suburbs like Warrensville Heights. Despite improvements in some city services in the late 1980s, including the refurbishment of Bisbee and Dove parks, Union-Miles Park suffered a 10 percent population loss between 1980 and 1990. By 1990, the racial composition of the neighborhood had risen to 95 percent African American. Poverty had also worsened in the neighborhood. Union-Miles Park was ranked 13th in 1970 {{in terms of the}} Cleveland neighborhoods with the highest <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>poverty.</b> By 1990, it was ranked 8th, with 60.9 percent of all residents living below the federal poverty line—making it one of the poorest neighborhoods anywhere in Cleveland or Cuyahoga County.|$|E

Early attempts were to discontinue the nationalisation programme by Gillani's government and instead replacing it with a new system based on state capitalism. The state-owned corporations were set off to privatisation menu and his government approved a new menu of privatisation based on public private partnership (PPP) with transfer of management control and 26% shares of 21 state owned enterprises (SOEs). No timetable was given instead his government announced that the privatisation process would be completed when international market would be feasible. During his first years of government, Gillani's government obtained unprecedented loans from International Monetary Fund which increased the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> in the country.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} avoid a rigid poor/non-poor {{dichotomy}} (see e. g. Â Hagenaars, 1986), the fuzzy sets approach to poverty measurement has been used. The aim {{of this paper is}} to propose fuzzy measures of unidimensional and multidimensional poverty by distinguishing three <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>poverty.</b> A methodological research is proposed as follows: first, the poor are analyzed by partitioning the total population in three mutually exclusive groups around the poverty line, and three <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> are distinguished. Second, a general rule for the construction of different fuzzy measure unionsÂ (Zadeh, 1975) is proposed, that is, rules for the construction <b>of</b> overall <b>poverty</b> starting from different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>poverty.</b> Finally, classes <b>of</b> fuzzy measures <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> referring to the overall population are suggested. An application using individual well-being data from Tunisian households in 1990 is presented to illustrate use of one of the proposed concepts.

500|$|This {{legislation}} {{provided the}} basis of what would later be known as the [...] "Old Poor Law" [...] in Scotland, which remained in place until the mid-nineteenth century. Most subsequent legislation built on the principles of provision for the local deserving poor and punishment of mobile and undeserving [...] "sturdie beggars". The most important later act was that of 1649, which declared that local heritors were to be assessed by kirk session to provide the financial resources for local relief, rather than relying on voluntary contributions. The system was largely able to cope with the general <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> and minor crises, helping the old and infirm to survive and provide life support in periods of downturn at relatively low cost, but was overwhelmed in the major subsistence crisis of the 1690s.|$|E
500|$|The parish {{also became}} an {{important}} unit of local government after three major pieces of legislation, in 1574, 1579 and 1592, established what would become known as [...] "the Old Poor Law".

By the mid-seventeenth century the system had largely been rolled out across the Lowlands, but was limited in the Highlands. It was able to cope with the general <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> and minor crises, helping the old and infirm to survive and provide life support in periods of downturn at relatively low cost, but was overwhelmed in major subsistence crisis like that of the [...] "seven ill years" [...] of the 1690s. Behaviour could be regulated through kirk sessions, composed of local church elders, which replaced the church courts of the Middle Ages, and which dealt with moral and religious conduct. The local court baron remained important in regulating minor interpersonal and property offences. They were held {{at the behest of the}} local baron when there was a backlog of cases and could appoint birleymen, usually senior tenants, who would resolve disputes and issues. The combination of kirk sessions and courts baron gave considerable power to local lairds to control the behaviour of the populations of their communities.|$|E
