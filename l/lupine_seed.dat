The main objective was to compare different strategies to apply <b>lupine</b> <b>seeds</b> (Lupinus angustifolius L. cv. Azuro and cv. Boruta) as N-fertilizers for a white cabbage crop (Brassica oleracea capitata L. cv. Impuls). Since during the germination process the seedlings use storage carbohydrates as an energy source by respiration, {{the amount of carbon}} in the plant and hence the C:N ratio decreases with time.

40|$|<b>Lupine</b> <b>seeds</b> are {{excellent}} source of plant protein. We here report on dry fractionation by combining milling and electrostatic separation providing {{an alternative to}} wet extraction of protein from <b>lupine</b> <b>seeds.</b> Relatively coarse milling was preferred as this provides sufficient detached protein bodies with less agglomeration of particles. After a single separation step a fraction with protein content 57. 3 g/ 100 g dry solids was obtained. After three successive steps protein content was increased further to 65. 0 g/ 100 g dry solids. By extra milling and recycling the fractions with comparable protein content as the flour, yield was improved without compromising protein content. A final fraction with protein content 65. 1 g/ 100 g dry solids and yield of 6 % was obtained, which means 10 % of protein in the flour was recovered. Based on our findings an optimised scheme for protein enrichment from <b>lupine</b> <b>seeds</b> by combining milling and electrostatic separation is proposed. Industrial relevance <b>Lupine</b> <b>seeds</b> are {{an excellent source of}} plant protein. Wet extraction of protein from <b>lupine</b> <b>seeds</b> consumes large amounts of water and energy. Alternatively, dry fractionation is more sustainable and retains the native functional properties of the protein. Previously, it was shown that dry milling and electrostatic separation could be used to further enrich protein from lupine flour. In this study, the process was further investigated with a new custom-build bench scale electrostatic separator. We found that a lupine protein concentrate could be obtained with higher purity compared to conventional air classification and earlier lab-scale experiments. Subsequently, a scheme was developed to improve the yield of the lupine protein concentrate without compromising the purity, and this provides a guideline for scaling-up this technique for industrial application. </p...|$|R

50|$|The lupine {{has been}} declining in number and range since the Industrial Revolution. It is {{estimated}} that it has declined in number by about 90% since 1900. This decline has been deemed {{one of the primary}} causes of the Karner blues' endangerment. The main causes of its decline are thought to be habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, and poor management. Currently it is threatened in Iowa, Maryland, and New Hampshire; it is endangered in Vermont and is extirpated in Maine. Human development has eliminated a large portion of its viable habitat. Remaining habitat is often fragmented, which is problematic for the lupine because it limits the range over which it can reproduce. Viable lupine habitat is often difficult to maintain because it flourishes after fires and other forms of disturbance. One reason this occurs is that <b>lupine</b> <b>seed</b> coats are so tough that only pressure changes due to rapid heating or abrasion are strong enough to allow water to penetrate and start germination. Moreover, fires, feeding by large ungulates, and mowing can improve habitat quality for established lupines by changing soil quality, vegetative structure, leaf litter depth. The exact mechanism for this is currently being investigated. Overall, the primary issue is that not enough habitat is burned or otherwise disturbed frequently enough to support the plant.|$|E

Many secondary plant metabolites have been shown to possess antioxidant activities, improving the effects of oxidative stress in diabetic patient. Thus the present study tries to evaluate the role of different preparations from Lupinus termis as a hypoglycemic agent. Alloxan diabetic rats were orally treated with either 5 ml/Kg b. wt/day aqueous <b>lupine</b> <b>seeds</b> extract or 20 % w/w in diet edible boiled <b>lupine</b> <b>seeds</b> powder or 20 % w/w dry <b>lupine</b> <b>seeds</b> powder for 30 days. The results recorded high levels of glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol as well as low levels of total protein, HDL-cholesterol, liver glycogen and serum insulin in diabetic rats. Phospholipids content was increased in the serum but decreased in the liver and pancreas of diabetic rats. In addition, the results confirmed that the alloxan diabetic rats were subjected to oxidative stress as indicated by the extent of lipid peroxidation (high malondialdehide levels) present in the liver and pancreas and significantly alter activities of some scavenging enzymes (low glutathione reductase, glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase, superoxide dismutase and catalase).

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of solid state fermentation (SSF) and submerged fermentation (SmF) with bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (BLIS) producing lactic acid bacteria (LAB) (Pediococcus acidilactici, Lactobacillus sakei and Pediococcus pentosaceus) on the content of alkylresorcinols (ARs) and lignans in plant products (barley bran, pea fiber, and <b>lupine</b> <b>seeds).</b> Lignans analysis was performed by HPLC-MS/MS, and alkylresorcinols content was evaluated by GC/MS. We found that with the experimentally tested LAB, under SSF conditions more organic acids were produced and in most cases a higher count of the LAB was found in SSF samples, compared to the SmF samples. The matairesinol content was increased by using fermentation (from 7. 9 to 35. 4 % in pea fiber, from 33. 2 to 81. 5 % in <b>lupine</b> <b>seeds,</b> and from 5. 9 to 74. 9 % in barley bran), and in most cases a higher content of matairesinol was found in the SSF samples.

40|$|A {{comparative}} study {{was carried out}} on the dynamics of lipid accumulation in developing seeds of three lupine species. Lupine seeds differ in lipid content; yellow lupine (Lupinus luteus L.) seeds contain about 6 %, white lupine (Lupinus albus L.) 7 – 14 %, and Andean lupine (Lupinus mutabilis Sweet) about 20 % of lipids by dry mass. Cotyledons from developing seeds were isolated and cultured in vitro for 96 [*]h on Heller medium with 60 [*]mM sucrose (+S) or without sucrose (–S). Each medium was additionally enriched with 35 [*]mM asparagine or 35 [*]mM NaNO 3. Asparagine caused an increase in protein accumulation and simultaneously decreased the lipid content, but nitrate increased accumulation of both protein and lipid. Experiments with [1 - 14 C]acetate and [2 - 14 C]acetate showed that the decrease in lipid accumulation in developing lupine seeds resulted from exhaustion of lipid precursors rather than from degradation or modification of the enzymatic apparatus.

Wild varieties of Lupinus could represent a viable alternative looking for new protein resources, from the techno-functional and nutritional point of view. Lupin flour is {{a good source of}} minerals and functional compounds, like carotenoids as antioxidant or dietary fiber, with health-promoting properties. Antinutritional factors associated to lupin can be minimized or eliminated by processing (soaking, dehulling and cooking). These characteristics of wild Lupinus varieties result in a revalorization of these crops as a protein and other healthy promoting compounds for human or animal consumption...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the fact}} that the use of feed of animal origin in the {{nutrition}} of monogastric animals has been limited, an essential problem arose as how to replace a high quality animal protein without adverse effect on animal health and performance. Most European countries are dependent on im-ported soy, which is a source of protein for poultry and pig diets. The heat treatment of soy is neces-sary for inactivation of anti-nutritional substances. Moreover, some soy cultivars contain estrogen-like agents (Sommer, 2003). The use of alternative home prepared diets with a high nutritional value and of reasonable price is attractive. <b>Lupine</b> <b>seeds</b> meet these requirements among leguminous plants cul-tivated in our country. According to a prospective study (Dijkstra et al., 2003) lupine has been included among eight poten-tial vegetable sources of protein for the use in feed and food production. The <b>seeds</b> of sweet <b>lupine</b> cultivars (Lupinus albus, L. angustifolius, L. luteus) contain 28 to 48 % crude protein (CP) in dry matter (DM), which depends on the lupine cultivar an...|$|R

The seeds were also assayed {{for the presence}} of aflatoxins and toxigenic fungi. Forty-seven species and 10 varieties in 14 genera of fungi were recovered. Among these, 45 species and 10 varieties were new to <b>lupine</b> <b>seeds,</b> and 5 species and 2 varieties were new to the mycoflora of the Sudan. The genus Aspergillus (10 species, 8 varieties) was the most common, followed by Rhizopus (1 species), Fusarium (6 species) and Alternaria (5 species), while the remaining genera (Chaetomium, Cladosporium, Curvularia, Drechslera, Penicillium, Phoma, Emericella, Mucor, Sclerotium, Ulocladium) displayed lower levels of contamination. Of possible pathogens on lupine plants, Alternaria (5 species) (stem lesion) and F. oxysporum (root rot) were recovered from the seeds. Thin-layer chromatographic analysis of chloroform extracts of the 13 seed samples revealed that two samples contained very low concentrations of aflatoxins B 1 and B 2 (4. 5 - 6. 5 µg/kg) ...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} proven that white <b>lupine</b> <b>seeds</b> (WLS) is a {{suitable}} crude protein (CP) source for growing-fattening rabbits, {{as well as for}} the lactating rabbit does. There are no reports, however, in the literature regarding the effect of blue <b>lupine</b> <b>seeds</b> (BLS) on rabbit doe milk production and composition as well as the growth of their litters. Therefore, the aim of this diploma thesis was to evaluate the effect of lactation and weaning diets based on BLS (Lupinus angustifolius cv Probor) on milk yield and milk composition of the rabbit does, as well as on growth performance and carcass quality of their progeny. Two lactation diets (LLB and LLU, having identical DP/DE ratio) and two weaning diets (VLB and VLU, having identical DP/DE ratio) were formulated. The LLB diet (control) contained WLS (25. 0 %) as the main CP sources, whereas the LLU diet was based on BLS (28. 5 %). As a result, the LLB diet had slightly greater ether extract content than did the LLU diet. The VLB diet (control) included WLS (12. 0 %) as the main CP source, whereas the VLU diet was based on BLS (15. 0 %). No additional fat was added to any of the diets. A total of 32 Hyplus rabbit does (16 animals per treatment; at the 3 rd parturition) were fed 1 of the 2 lactation diets during the entire lactation (35 days). Does were housed in modified cages which allowed controlled suckling (once a day at 7 am) and separate access of does and their litters to feed. Feed intake and milk yield were measured daily during the entire lactation period, whereas litter weight was measured every 7 d. Milk yield was measured by weighing the rabbit does immediately before and after suckling. Five does of each group were used to evaluate milk composition. Milk was collected manually at d 21 of lactation. The litters were standardized to 9 kits on the day of birth. Litters were offered weaning diets with the same CP source as in the lactation diet of their mothers from d 17 to 80 of age. At d 37 of age (weaning), 99 rabbits on each weaning diet were used to evaluate growth performance and health. Feed intake, feed efficiency and milk production of does (on average 263 g/d) were not affected by dietary treatments, as well as milk efficiency (on average 0. 59) and the growth of their litters (on average 30. 4 g/d per rabbit). Live weight at weaning (P= 0. 005), milk dry matter (P= 0. 028) and fat contents (P= 0. 016), as well as fat output per kg of metabolic weight (P< 0. 001) were higher in does fed the WLS diet. After weaning, final live weight (by 168 g; P= 0. 061), average daily weight gain (by 3 g/d; P= 0, 024) and carcass weights were lower in rabbits fed the diet based on BLS than in those fed with the WLS diet. The number of ill + dead rabbits caused by digestive disease was lower (23 rabbits vs. 38 rabbits; P= 0. 042) in rabbits fed the diet based on WLS. The results of the diploma thesis confirmed that WLS is a suitable CP source for the rabbit diets. Negative findings such as a higher mobilisation of body reserves of does in the later phase of lactation, as well as the lower final live weight and the higher sanitary risk index of rabbits fed the diets based on blue <b>lupine</b> <b>seeds</b> suggest difference between lupine species in terms of feed efficiency. These findings should be elucidated and confirmed by the comparing with other blue lupine varieties...|$|R
40|$|In {{the process}} of {{pneumatic}} separation we use as separating characteristics aerodynamic properties of particles, their critical velocity being the characteristic value. The investigations were carried out on a pneumatic separator whose design enabled {{a wide range of}} regulations of parameters. Based on the study results the essential fa- ctors that affected the course of the process were identified and the theoretical correlation between them, deciding about the efficacy of pneumatic separation, were determined. The main aim {{of the study was to}} analyse the separation process in an air stream of broken-up <b>lupine</b> <b>seeds,</b> chiefly involving theoretical considerations of movement and behaviour of mixture particles in a pneumatic canal. Investigations and observations gave ground for an attempt at determining a deriving a movement equation of particles in an unrestrained, uniform air stream. The equations obtained can be used for calculating the parameters of particle movement in pneumatic canals. The velocities of air stream, then, can be a few times higher than the critical velocity /convection/ of individual particles. While working out the above problems there were consi-dered, on the one hand possibilities of obtaining the greatest effectiveness of the separation process, and on the other, the smallest possible losses of valuable material in the discard-ed lot...|$|R

Deformation varied significantly (P < 0. 02) with crop type and was the highest in <b>lupine</b> <b>seeds.</b> Feed pea had the highest strain resistance value. Both deformation energy and volume energy requirements varied significantly (P < 0. 0001) with crop type. Moduli of deformation of compressed feed pea, lupine, and soybean at an applied force of 100 kN were 269. 7, 306. 3, and 455. 2 MPa, indicating the proportionate resistance of the crop materials to compressive strain.

The trials were always performed on a group of six sports horses (weight of 495 to 742 kg). Six feed rations were tested, which contained different proportion of certain forage legume in empirical feed mixtures. Three feed mixtures contained white <b>lupine</b> <b>seeds</b> (WLS) – Lu 0 (0. 01 % WLS), Lu 7 (7 % WLS), Lu 14 (14 % WLS) and surplus three feed mixtures contained field pea seeds (FPS) – Hr 0 (0. 01 % FPS), Hr 10 (10 % FPS), Hr 20 (20 % FPS). Amount of WLS in feed mixtures Lu 0 and Lu 7 was completed with starch to value 14 % and amount of FPS in feed mixtures Hr 0 and Hr 10 was completed with starch to value 20 %. Indicator method was used to predict dietary nutrients digestibility. Apparent digestibility values of all organic nutrients were higher at the feed rations with the content of FPS. Average values of apparent digestibility coefficient of those feed rations were: dry matter (77. 79 %; SD = 2. 91), organic matter (78. 43 %; SD = 2. 78), crude protein (79. 89 %; SD = 3. 43), fat (66. 57 %; SD = 2. 40), crude fiber (68. 97 %; SD = 3. 21) and nitrogen-free extract (83. 30 %; SD = 2. 71) ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Lupine allergy {{is caused}} by {{ingestion}} of the flour of a plant called Lupinus albus, {{a member of the}} Leguminosae family. Lupine allergy has been described in adult patients previously known to have peanut allergy (cross-reactivity). OBJECTIVE: To describe the first case of an anaphylactic reaction caused by ingestion of lupine flour in a pediatric patient without a known peanut allergy. METHODS: Symptom assessment, nutritional history, and skin and blood tests. RESULTS: An otherwise healthy 8 -year-old boy had nose and eye discharge followed by facial edema and difficulty breathing 30 minutes after eating an industrially prepared waffle containing eggs, sugar, and lupine flour. He had no history of food allergy and was eating a normal diet, including peanuts and other legumes. Results of skin prick tests using commercial extracts were positive to peanuts and negative to eggs, soy, and nuts; results of a prick-to-prick test using lupine flour were strongly positive (+ + + +). His total IgE level was 1, 237 UI/mL. Specific IgE antibodies were positive to <b>lupine</b> <b>seeds</b> (20. 8 kU/L) and peanuts (&gt; 100 kU/L). CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, we describe the first case of an anaphylactic reaction after ingestion of lupine flour in a child without known allergy. In the case of peanut allergy or any anaphylactic reaction without evident cause, especially after industrially prepared food ingestion, lupine should be considered in the list of allergens tested. Lupine is increasingly used in industrially prepared food but is not regularly declared in the composition, leading to difficulties in allergen avoidance...|$|R
