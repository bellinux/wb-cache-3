25|$|The touted Washington plan {{ignored the}} fact that Communist troops had long since <b>learned</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> mass {{where they could be}} struck by {{tactical}} air power. Current communist tactics saw them dispersed around the Royalist positions and concentrating their fire on a strongpoint, converging for assaults at the last moment. The proposed defense also ignored the lack of viable defensive positions on the Vientiane Plain, and the dwindling air power allotment to support Royalist operations in northern Laos.|$|E
25|$|A manhunt for {{the other}} two {{suspects}} was conducted throughout the night and into the next day, when police located the two remaining suspects, who had been hiding in the woods; they were arrested without incident. The shootout between Lopez and the gunman had been videotaped by a camera in Lopez's cruiser. After the incident, Lopez told authorities that he believed the video of Lunsford's murder is what had saved his life that night. The video had helped him deal with the three suspects and he had <b>learned</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> make the same mistakes that Lunsford had made eight months earlier. For his actions, Trooper Lopez was awarded the Texas Department of Public Safety Medal of Valor, the highest award a commissioned trooper can receive.|$|E

Degas also introduced her to etching, of which he was a recognized master. The two worked side-by-side for a while, and her draftsmanship gained considerable strength under his tutelage. He depicted her in a series of etchings recording their trips to the Louvre. She treasured his friendship but <b>learned</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> expect too much from his fickle and temperamental nature after a project they were collaborating on at the time, a proposed journal devoted to prints, was abruptly dropped by him. The sophisticated and well-dressed Degas, then forty-five, was a welcome dinner guest at the Cassatt residence, and likewise they at his soirées.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the usage}} of 'not' in {{splitting}} infinitives {{is an issue that}} has not attracted much attention from the English users, contemporary English grammar puts the phrase into the same category as above. This appears to be because the traditional idiom, placing the negation before the marker (I soon <b>learned</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> provoke her) or with verbs of desire, negating the finite verb (I don't want to see you anymore) remains easy and natural, and is still overwhelmingly the more common construction in British English. On the other hand, in the case of American English, a search on the corpus of contemporary American English displays a different aspect. Its usage is more commonly found in the American context, where we can find at least 2,200 cases of {{the usage of}} 'not' in splitting infinitives.|$|E
25|$|Genie {{spent almost}} all of her {{childhood}} locked alone in a bedroom with almost no environmental stimuli, where her father left her severely malnourished and almost always kept her either strapped to a child's toilet or bound inside a crib with {{her arms and legs}} completely immobilized. He refused to speak to or around her, beating her or forcing her brother to do so if she made any sound or showed any emotion, and to discourage her from making any outward expression he would bare his teeth and bark and growl at her like a dog. As a result, she <b>learned</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> vocalize or make noise and to remain as unexpressive as possible. On some occasions when she was hungry or seeking some kind of attention she made environmental noises, but otherwise maintained silence at all times.|$|E
500|$|The {{influence}} of Taoism on Le Guin's writing is evident {{through much of}} the book, especially in her depiction of the [...] "balance". At the end of the novel, Ged, may be seen to embody the Taoist way of life, as he has <b>learned</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> act unless absolutely necessary. He has also learned that seeming opposites, like light and dark or good and evil, are actually interdependent. Light and dark themselves are recurring images within the story. Reviewers have identified this belief as evidence of a conservative ideology within the story, shared with much of fantasy. In emphasizing concerns over balance and equilibrium, scholars have argued, Le Guin essentially justifies the status quo, which wizards strive to maintain. This tendency is in contrast to Le Guin's science fiction writing, in which change is shown to have value.|$|E

[...] When Joseph was age 2, David Reece died, and the Foraker family purchased the mill and adjacent farm. [...] There, Joseph grew up as a typical farm boy. He received little formal education, attending the local school {{for three or four}} months each winter. [...] Nevertheless, young Joseph acquired a taste for military history, and a gift for speaking. [...] He also became interested in politics; at age 10, he became an adherent of the newly formed Republican Party. [...] Four years later, he supported the Republican candidate, former Illinois representative Abraham Lincoln, in the 1860 presidential race, marching in processions of the Wide Awakes and other pro-Lincoln groups, and attending as many rallies as he could.

In his {{assessment}} of the song, Richie Unterberger commented [...] "Never <b>Learn</b> <b>Not</b> <b>to</b> Love" [...] is far more notorious for its relation <b>to</b> Manson, <b>not</b> the music itself which he describes as [...] "average". Author Carl Larkin, in his book The Encyclopedia of Popular Music, wrote the track [...] "had the ironic distinction of putting Charles Manson in the charts". Journalist Nathan Jolly called the song [...] "softer but still eerie", also noting how fans of the Beach Boys who listened to the song over the years [...] "had no idea of the inherent evil of its actual composer". Throughout the years, [...] "Never <b>Learn</b> <b>Not</b> <b>to</b> Love" [...] has appeared on several other Beach Boys compilations and bootlegs.|$|R

Some champion bucking horses got their start as spoiled riding horses that learned to quickly and effectively unseat riders. [...] Due to the rigors of travel and the short bursts of high intensity work required, most horses in a bucking string are at least 6 or 7 years old before they are used extensively, {{and are expected to}} be sound performers for many years. [...] Awards are given to the owners of the best bucking horses, who are respected as equine athletes and perform for many years. Many are retired to pasture {{at the end of their}} careers. Many bucking horses understand their job well and reduce or stop their bucking, even while still wearing a flank strap, as soon as they either unseat the rider or hear the buzzer.

2500|$|The ASB survived {{until the}} turn of the Millennium. General Synod <b>learned</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> repeat the time-hungry debates through which it had been born, and had amended {{standing}} orders allowing for a much more expeditious means of liturgical revision. The Daily or Sunday offices had been superseded in many churches [...] by less formal forms - the Services of the Word - which accommodated the desire of some Evangelicals, particularly those in the charismatic tradition, not to be bound very much by liturgical forms, and by the growing popularity of informal family services. Additional material had been provided for use by General Synod in such books as 'Patterns for Worship' and seasonal material in the book [...] 'Lent, Holy Week and Easter' and, for the winter seasons of Advent, Christmas and Epiphany, in 'The Promise of his Glory'. Some parishes were using the Roman Catholic-derived Revised Common Lectionary, which allowed each Biblical writer to speak in his own voice and on a three-year cycle. The intention had been to replace the ASB and the time seemed ripe. The single, if somewhat bulky book that the ASB was, was replaced by a series of books, none of which include readings, and by software packages and online support. This was Common Worship.|$|E
