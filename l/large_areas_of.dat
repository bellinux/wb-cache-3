5|$|Other pest {{include the}} coconut hispine beetle, Brontispa longissima, which feeds on young leaves, {{seedlings}} and mature coconut trees, causing serious economic {{damage in the}} Philippines.

5|$|The Brazilian {{government}} in the late 1960s used herbicides to defoliate a large section of the Amazon rainforest so that Alcoa could build the Tucuruí dam to power mining operations. <b>Large</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> rainforest were destroyed, along with the homes and livelihoods of thousands of rural peasants and indigenous tribes.|$|E
5|$|A postwar {{review of}} {{inadequate}} housing {{led to the}} clearance and redevelopment of <b>large</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> the city in a postwar style, often at variance with the Georgian style of the city. In the 1950s the nearby villages of Combe Down, Twerton and Weston were incorporated into Bath to enable the development of further housing, much of it council housing such as the Whiteway estate.|$|E
50|$|The Ankeniheny-Zahamena Corridor (CAZ) is a <b>large</b> <b>area</b> <b>of</b> {{protected}} forest biome {{in eastern}} Madagascar.

Over 2,000 species of plants have been recorded in the CAZ, nearly 1,700 of which are endemic to the region.|$|R

5|$|According to Di Tella and Zymelman (1967), {{the main}} {{difference}} between Argentina and other settler societies such as Australia and Canada was its failure to seek adequate alternatives to compensate for the end of geographical expansion with the definitive closing of the frontier. Solberg (1985) noted the differences between the land distribution in Canada, which led to a rising number of small farmers, and the small number of landowners each with <b>large</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> land in Argentina.|$|E
5|$|After the First World War, the Urban District Council, {{which had}} {{replaced}} the District Board in 1894, began a programme of urban improvement. <b>Large</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> open farmland were purchased for the building of council houses, and a notorious slum area, Ogley Square, which had been declared unfit for human habitation, was demolished after a long legal dispute and the tenants rehoused. The final farmland {{within the boundaries of}} Brownhills was sold for redevelopment in 1952.|$|E
5|$|As {{the desert}} {{mountains}} decay, <b>large</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> shattered rock and rubble occur. The process continues {{and the end}} products are either dust or sand. Dust is formed from solidified clay or volcanic deposits whereas sand results from the fragmentation of harder granites, limestone and sandstone. There is a certain critical size (about 0.5mm) below which further temperature-induced weathering of rocks does not occur and this provides a minimum size for sand grains.|$|E

5|$|At {{the close}} of the 20th century, malaria {{remained}} endemic in more than 100 countries throughout the tropical and subtropical zones, including <b>large</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> Central and South America, Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic), Africa, the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and Oceania. Resistance of Plasmodium to anti-malaria drugs, as well as resistance of mosquitos to insecticides and the discovery of zoonotic species of the parasite have complicated control measures.|$|E
5|$|Baculoviruses are {{specific}} to individual insect host species and {{have been shown to}} be useful in biological pest control. For example, the Lymantria dispar multicapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus has been used to spray <b>large</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> forest in North America where larvae of the gypsy moth are causing serious defoliation. The moth larvae are killed by the virus they have eaten and die, the disintegrating cadavers leaving virus particles on the foliage to infect other larvae.|$|E
5|$|Early in its duration, Alibera {{produced}} gusty winds in the Seychelles. Upon moving ashore in Madagascar, the cyclone lashed {{coastal cities}} with heavy rainfall {{and up to}} 250-km/h (150-mph) wind gusts. In Mananjary, nearly every building was damaged or destroyed, and locals considered it the worst storm since 1925. Across the region, the cyclone destroyed <b>large</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> crops, thousands of houses, and several roads and bridges. Alibera killed 46people and left 55,346people homeless. After the storm, the Malagasy government requested for international assistance.|$|E

5|$|From the {{opposite}} end of Europe (the Iberian Peninsula) came the few people who formed during the 2500-1900 BCE period the Bell-Beaker culture. It was named after the shape of their typical, carefully finished and precisely ornamented pottery. Southwestern Poland was at the eastern edge of their range. Because of their mobility, the Bell-Beaker people helped spread new inventions, including developing metallurgy, over <b>large</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> Europe.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-16thcentury Henry VIII of England {{dissolved}} the monasteries, {{resulting in}} the <b>large</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> land owned by Meaux Abbey, Bridlington Priory and other monastic holdings being confiscated.

5|$|In the sparsely {{populated}} area where Item moved ashore, the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall. Newspaper reports considered it the worst storm to hit Mexico in ten years, with damage in Veracruz totaling around $1.5million (1950USD, $ USD). The strong winds sank 20ships, and although there were no reports of casualties, Item caused 15injuries. Communications were disrupted across the region, and downed trees blocked roads.
