5|$|King Louis XV honored Franklin {{after seeing}} {{some of the}} {{electrical}} experiments done in the royal palace at St. Germain near Paris, France. However physicist Jean-Antoine Nollet (1700–1770), a skeptic who had published his own theory on electricity, declared Franklin's ideas were wrong. He claimed in 1753 that Franklin's lightning rod was not only dangerous but useless and would attract <b>lightning</b> <b>bolts</b> to wooden buildings, causing them to be hit more often. Franklin in time proved to the scientific community that his lightning rod invention not only was a protective device, but it {{also served as a}} preventive way to divert destructive <b>lightning</b> <b>bolts</b> away from hitting buildings.|$|E

Before the song begins to play, <b>lightning</b> <b>bolts</b> are projected onto {{a wall in}} which Rihanna stands in front of. She and her lover are depicted as enamored with each other, and enjoying activities such as fairground rides and eating in fast food restaurants. During the chorus, images of drugs, pills, and dilated pupils are shown, while brief scenes of Rihanna and her boyfriend preparing to have sex are shown.|$|E
5|$|During their patrol, Wish Bear spots Christy {{stranded}} in a canoe within a lake; the other Bears and Cousins {{set out to}} rescue her. Dark Heart fires <b>lightning</b> <b>bolts</b> before the team, and captures many of them with his magic bag the favor he wanted Christy to do all along. The few Family members at hand determine that she {{has teamed up with}} him. This prompts Tenderheart Bear to hold a conference at the Hall of Hearts; Friend Bear, Secret Bear and Christy's friends later join them.|$|E

The four-track EP includes four tracks ranging in length {{from six to}} eleven minutes. The first two tracks are credited to The Flaming Lips with <b>Lightning</b> <b>Bolt,</b> while the latter two are credited to <b>Lightning</b> <b>Bolt</b> with The Flaming Lips.|$|R

25|$|The <b>lightning</b> <b>bolt</b> {{is used to}} {{represent}} the instantaneous communication capabilities of electrically powered telegraphs and radios. It was a commonly used motif in Art Deco design, especially the zig-zag Art Deco design of the late 1920s. The <b>lightning</b> <b>bolt</b> is a common insignia for military communications units throughout the world. A <b>lightning</b> <b>bolt</b> is also the NATO symbol for a signal asset.|$|R
5|$|In a Christianized version, the duel {{involves}} the Christian St.Elijah and the ala, {{but there is}} a belief that the saint and the dragons in fact cooperate: as soon as St.Elijah spots an ala, he summons the dragons, either takes them aboard his chariot or harnesses them to it, and they jointly shoot the ala with lightning. Arrow-shaped stones, like belemnites or stone-age arrowheads, are regarded as materialized <b>lightning</b> <b>bolts</b> imbued with a beneficial magical power, and finding one is a good omen.|$|E
5|$|The Storm {{was always}} going to go with the colours of their state, Victoria (Navy blue with a white 'V'), but club {{consultant}} at the time, Peter McWhirter of the JAG fashion house, suggested that they should also have purple and gold to make their merchandise more attractive. These colours appear in the logo, however, on the home jersey they have varied. Between 1998 and 2004 these four colours also appeared but between 2005 and 2009, gold was completely removed and silver introduced. Between 2010–2012, gold returned and silver was omitted, purple also became the dominant colour in the jersey. For 2013 a new design was announced featuring a deeper V, with more navy blue in the jersey, gold disappeared along with most of the white, the <b>lightning</b> <b>bolts</b> were also changed to purple. During 2015 the jersey changed again for the first time not featuring a V at all, but the V returned somewhat along with the <b>lightning</b> <b>bolts</b> in 2016 with a manufacturer change. Over the years and in all variations of the Jersey, Navy Blue and Purple always remain the main colours.|$|E
5|$|Thunderstorms {{strongly}} influenced many early civilizations. Greeks {{believed that they}} were battles waged by Zeus, who hurled <b>lightning</b> <b>bolts</b> forged by Hephaestus. Some American Indian tribes associated thunderstorms with the Thunderbird, who they believed was a servant of the Great Spirit. The Norse considered thunderstorms to occur when Thor went to fight Jötnar, with the thunder and lightning being the effect of his strikes with the hammer Mjölnir. Hinduism recognizes Indra as the god of rain and thunderstorms. Christian doctrine accepted the ideas of Aristotle's original work, called Meteorologica, that winds were caused by exhalations from the Earth and that fierce storms were the work of God. These ideas were still within the mainstream as late as the 18th century.|$|E
50|$|There are two power-ups: the {{hourglass}} and the <b>lightning</b> <b>bolt.</b> The hourglass stops all enemy {{movement for}} a short period of time. The <b>lightning</b> <b>bolt</b> kills all enemies on-screen, except for Ghidorah.|$|R
50|$|The {{trademark}} <b>lightning</b> <b>bolt</b> or slash ("/") used {{to separate}} the 'AC' and 'DC' in the band's name contravened the naming policy of the Office of the Registrar of Geographic Names, so the punctuation was omitted on the street sign. One month after the renaming a <b>lightning</b> <b>bolt</b> was erected {{above and below the}} street sign by an artist named Knifeyard. The <b>lightning</b> <b>bolt</b> was removed at a later date.|$|R

5|$|The single-player {{adventure}} {{begins by}} personalizing a player character. Each character has randomly generated values for their statistical character attributes: charisma, constitution, dexterity, intelligence, strength, and wisdom. While the algorithm stays the same, the player can randomize repeatedly for new character attribute distributions until satisfied. The player {{begins with a}} sword, armor, shield, and no money, and can only see his immediate surroundings, rather than the whole level. Monsters spawn randomly, and players have three options in battle: fight, use magic, or evade. Magic includes combative missiles, fireballs, <b>lightning</b> <b>bolts,</b> and turning the undead, as well as health regeneration and trap navigation. The effects of the game's most complex spells are not outlined in the instruction manual and must be learned by trial and error. Like the game, the battle events are carried out in real time instead of in turns. Enemies increase in difficulty as the player progresses through the dungeon. They include both living and undead monsters such as elves, dragons, mummies, and wraiths. Defeating enemies awards experience points, which accrete to raise the player's experience level and increase player stats. The player is rewarded with treasures that include magical weapons, armor items, and potions. Players can code their own features into the game.|$|E
5|$|The dungeon has a fleshed-out ecology: certain {{creatures are}} natural enemies. For example, Flies and Spiders are often found {{at odds with}} one another. Common {{behaviours}} when a creature is angry include vandalising the dungeon and deserting the player. The creatures are varied in their statistics; some excel at certain tasks, and others refuse to perform certain tasks. Which creatures enter the dungeon depends on which rooms the player has and how large they are; most creatures have prerequisites for entering service. Creatures require paying regularly, and when 'Payday' comes, will head for the Treasure room to collect their wages. Other ways to obtain creatures include imprisoning and torturing them, 'scavenging' (persuaded to defect to the player) from enemy keepers, and performing certain sacrifices at the Temple. Creatures entering via the Portal are at the lowest experience level, and must gain experience, usually by training in the training room. Training creatures increases their attributes (such as hit points) and abilities (such as which spells they can cast). Such spells include <b>lightning</b> <b>bolts,</b> rebounding projectiles, and increasing armour. Creatures will frequently enter combat with heroes or creatures belonging to another keeper. Each creature has a star of the colour of the keeper it belongs to above it, displaying its experience level. The star is a health meter; as a creature takes damage, the spikes turn black. The player {{has the ability to}} possess a creature, seeing the dungeon from its first-person perspective and using its attacks and abilities. This is one of the spells; others include speeding creatures up, and healing them.|$|E

These determine the chemistry that one Sim has with another {{in the form of}} <b>lightning</b> <b>bolts.</b> Sims can have up to 3 <b>lightning</b> <b>bolts</b> with another Sim. The higher the chemistry is that a Sim has with another Sim, the greater the chance for social interactions to be accepted. New turn-ons and turn-offs are introduced with the Bon Voyage expansion pack.|$|E

25|$|In Georges Dumézil's view, Jovian {{theology}} (and that of {{the equivalent}} gods in other Indo-European religions) is an evolution from a naturalistic, supreme, celestial god identified with heaven to a sovereign god, a wielder of <b>lightning</b> <b>bolts,</b> master and protector of the community (in other words, of a change from a naturalistic approach {{to the world of}} the divine to a socio-political approach).|$|E

25|$|Sand worms behave {{differently}} in Dune 2000 than in its predecessor. They {{can not be}} selected, nor their health is displayed. Their movement sight is more grainy rather than vibrating, and <b>lightning</b> <b>bolts</b> can be seen where the worm is. Their appearance is constant {{from the very first}} mission to the very end, and every multiplayer/practice map has 3 or more Sand worms (they can be turned off in multiplayer and practice).|$|E
25|$|The {{depiction}} of the fighting begins here with the great mother goddess of Asia Minor, Rhea/Cybele. With bow and arrow she rides into battle on a lion. On the left can be seen the eagle of Zeus holding a bundle of <b>lightning</b> <b>bolts</b> in his claws. Next to Rhea, three of the immortals fight with a mighty, bull-necked Giant. The first, a goddess, has not been identified; she is followed by Hephaistos, who raises a two-headed hammer aloft. He is followed by another unidentified, kneeling god who thrusts a spear into the body.|$|E

25|$|Bartman Meets Radioactive Man is a side-scrolling {{platform}} game. Throughout {{the four}} levels, Bartman {{is faced with}} enemies he has to defeat. He only has five life points, but if he loses {{one or more of}} them they can be restored. This is done by collecting radioactive signs. The player is able to collect lightning icons that give Bartman the ability to shoot <b>lightning</b> <b>bolts</b> at enemies. His other weapons are kicking and punching. In addition, Bartman must avoid the deadly traps that are scattered at various places in the levels.|$|E
25|$|Faced by {{a period}} of bad weather {{endangering}} the harvest during one early spring, King Numa resorted to the scheme of asking {{the advice of the}} god by evoking his presence. He succeeded through the help of Picus and Faunus, whom he had imprisoned by making them drunk. The two gods (with a charm) evoked Jupiter, who was forced to come down to earth at the Aventine (hence named Iuppiter Elicius, according to Ovid). After Numa skilfully avoided the requests of the god for human sacrifices, Jupiter agreed to his request to know how <b>lightning</b> <b>bolts</b> are averted, asking only for the substitutions Numa had mentioned: an onion bulb, hairs and a fish. Moreover, Jupiter promised that at the sunrise of the following day he would give to Numa and the Roman people pawns of the imperium. The following day, after throwing three <b>lightning</b> <b>bolts</b> across a clear sky, Jupiter sent down from heaven a shield. Since this shield had no angles, Numa named it ancile; because in it resided the fate of the imperium, he had many copies made of it to disguise the real one. He asked the smith Mamurius Veturius to make the copies, and gave them to the Salii. As his only reward, Mamurius expressed the wish that his name be sung in the last of their carmina. Plutarch gives a slightly different version of the story, writing that the cause of the miraculous drop of the shield was a plague and not linking it with the Roman imperium.|$|E
25|$|Though not {{technically}} third jumpers, the Centenary of Rugby League celebrations left all teams with special jerseys for the Centenary round, and in 2009 several teams {{wore the same}} jerseys (the Newcastle Knights, however, wore their foundation strip, in 2008 they wore a Newcastle Rebels jersey, {{which was the first}} Newcastle team in the NSWRL and played in the NSWRL's foundation season.
