40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{computational}} model capable to predict the viewer perception of car advertisements videos by using a set of low-level video descriptors. Our research goal relies on the hypothesis that these descriptors could reflect the aesthetic value of the videos and, in turn, their viewers' perception. To that effect, and as a novel approach to this problem, we automatically annotate our video corpus, downloaded from YouTube, by applying an unsupervised clustering algorithm to the retrieved metadata linked to the viewers' assessments of the videos. In this regard, a regular k-means algorithm is applied as partitioning method with k ranging from 2 to 5 clusters, modeling different satisfaction <b>levels</b> <b>or</b> <b>classes.</b> On the other hand, available metadata is categorized into two different types based on {{the profile of the}} viewers of the videos: metadata based on explicit and implicit opinion respectively. These two types of metadata are first individually tested and then combined together resulting in three different models or strategies that are thoroughly analyzed. Typical feature selection techniques are used over the implemented video descriptors as a pre-processing step in the classification of viewer perception, where several different classifiers have been considered as part of the experimental setup. Evaluation results show that the proposed video descriptors are clearly indicative of the subjective perception of viewers regardless of the implemented strategy and the number of classes considered. The strategy based on explicit opinion metadata clearly outperforms the implicit one in terms of classification accuracy. Finally, the combined approach slightly improves the explicit, achieving a top accuracy of 72. 18 % when distinguishing between 2 classes, and suggesting that better classification results could be obtained by using suitable metrics to model perception derived from all available metadata.

Considering the skills gap that is identified among literature on future employees abilities and readiness, study utilizes a collection of skills, termed 21 st century skills, by Casner-Lotto and Barrington (2006) to specifically focus on student's perception of personal readiness, attainment of skills, and importance of skills in their future workplace. The sample yielded 131 participants employed or volunteers, crew members, of the Pirate Academic Success Center (PASC). Survey collection was compiled via Qualtrics then exported into SPSS for analysis. Overall results suggest a gap remains among student, crew members, rating of skills needed in the workplace and their own readiness of skills.

40|$|IntroductionFew {{children}} in the United States achieve the recommended 60 minutes of physical activity per day. Identifying successful interventions that increase physical activity for children is critical. This observational study evaluated the effects of Move-To-Improve (MTI), a classroom-based physical education program designed for kindergarten to third-grade teachers in New York City public schools. MTI organizes 3 -hour trainings for teachers that demonstrate strategies for integrating activity into daily classroom schedules. MethodsRandomly sampled elementary schools (N = 39) with classrooms trained in MTI in spring 2010 participated in the evaluation. In each school, we observed 2 classrooms trained in MTI and 2 untrained classrooms in the same school matched by grade level for 1 full school day. We analyzed data from 72 trained and 72 untrained classrooms. ResultsNinety-nine percent of MTI-trained classroom teachers led their students in physical activity. MTI-trained classrooms spent an average of 9. 5 minutes in physical activity per day, compared with 2. 4 minutes in untrained classrooms (P <. 001), an almost fourfold increase in activity. Levels of activity were higher in trained versus untrained classrooms regardless of grade <b>level</b> <b>or</b> <b>class</b> size. ConclusionTeachers trained in MTI led their classrooms in significantly more physical activity compared with teachers who were not trained. The MTI program is an effective strategy for increasing physical activity during the school day. A curriculum that empowers classroom teachers to incorporate activity into their regular day is a practical approach to promoting healthier living for children. 1 U 58 DP 002418 - 01 /DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United States 22974754 PMC 347553...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to review the {{empirical}} research evidence on the effect of teacher certification on student achievement. An exploratory meta-analysis was conducted on studies that examined the effect of fully certified and less-than-fully certified teachers on student achievement. The meta-analysis focused on the areas of mathematics, science and reading and explored trends across areas of achievement, school level and research design. The study was directed towards (a) a synthesis of findings, and (b) recommendations for future research and policy decisions. The meta-analysis population consisted of five individual studies that generated twenty-seven effect size estimates. Three studies utilized either an individual <b>level</b> <b>or</b> <b>class</b> <b>level</b> of analysis and yielded twelve mean difference effect size estimates. Two studies utilized either a school <b>or</b> state <b>level</b> of analysis and yielded fifteen correlational effect size estimates. The majority of findings in mathematics favor the positive effect of fully certified teachers. In science, the findings pointed towards equivalent levels of student achievement for fully certified and less-than fully certified teachers. All the findings associated with reading favored the positive effect of fully certified teachers. It appears that certification may be more crucial to student achievement in reading and mathematics than in science. Across school levels, the overall trend suggests that full certification may be more crucial to student achievement in elementary school than middle or high school. Across levels of analysis and research design, studies that utilize an aggregate level of analysis yield a greater number of positive study outcomes than designs conducted at the individual <b>or</b> <b>class</b> <b>level.</b> A key finding is that given the specifications of the meta-analysis, direct evidence of the relationship between certification and student achievement is limited to five peer-reviewed, published studies. Additional findings illuminated several issues that are vital to improving the quantity and quality of research on teacher certification. Eight specific recommendations were directed towards academic researchers who plan to study the topic. Four recommendations are directed towards policy-makers at the state and federal level who are involved in setting standards and planning legislation for educator preparation...|$|R

The residualallocated-resources will be measured by the service-quantization-overhead which is the summation of the differences between the required QoS and the offered service level for all traffic streams. We formulate the classification as a Dynamic-Programming problem. We then present a group of polynomial-timealgorithms to obtain the optimal classification for soft and hard QoS requirements. We also present the concept of &quot;differentiation factor &quot; and show the effect of this factor on minimizing the quantization-overhead. ...|$|R
