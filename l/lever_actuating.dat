50|$|In 1974, BMW {{introduced}} the “/6” models, which offered front disc brake, revised instrumentation, and a five-speed transmission. The single disc brake was a hybrid cable/hydraulic system, whereby a cable from the handlebar <b>lever</b> <b>actuated</b> the master cylinder underneath the fuel tank. The rectangular tank was dropped.|$|R
50|$|The Penn Model F was a surf reel {{designed}} for distance casting. It had bakelite side plates and weighed twelve ounces. This model was a surf reel used mainly for surf fishing. The similar Model K added a <b>lever</b> <b>actuated</b> free spool and durable metal reinforced plates. It was offered {{with and without}} a star drag. An adjustable bearing allowed the spool be tightened to prevent backlash.|$|R
2500|$|In [...] "double action" [...] firearm designs, {{the trigger}} {{is also used}} to cock the firearm — and there are many designs where the trigger is used for a range of other functions.

50|$|The Honda TR200 {{series of}} bikes was {{produced}} only in 1986 and 1987. The engine was a 199 cc four-stroke OHC single {{linked to a}} five-speed transmission and automatic clutch. It featured <b>lever</b> <b>actuated</b> drum brakes on both wheels. This bike was unique in that it used two ATV-type tires. Presently complete bikes are quite uncommon, though replacement parts are readily available as they interchange with other Honda ATCs.|$|R
50|$|Sunroof {{systems may}} be manual or electric, while most moonroof systems are electric/electronic. Manual sunroofs may be <b>lever</b> <b>actuated,</b> as in venting type pop-ups, manual lever or crank {{operated}} for sliding systems. Electric roof systems are usually cable {{driven by a}} motor and feature some form of sliding opening. Most moonroof systems today are electric and have either a combination pop-up/inbuilt or a pop-up/spoiler configuration (see sunroof types below).|$|R

50|$|An AdvancedTCA board (blade) is 280 mm {{deep and}} 322 mm high. The boards have a metal front panel and a metal cover {{on the bottom}} of the printed circuit board to limit {{electromagnetic}} interference and to limit the spread of fire. The locking injector-ejector handle (<b>lever)</b> <b>actuates</b> a microswitch to let the Intelligent Platform Management Controller (IPMC) know that an operator wants to remove a board, or that the board has just been installed, thus activating the hot-swap procedure. AdvancedTCA boards support the use of PCI Mezzanine Card (PMC) or Advanced Mezzanine Card (AMC) expansion mezzanines.|$|R
50|$|Power {{interlockings}} {{may also}} use mechanical locking {{to ensure the}} proper sequencing of levers, but the levers are considerably smaller as they themselves do not directly control the field devices. If the lever is free to move based on the locking bed, contacts on the <b>levers</b> <b>actuate</b> the switches and signals which are operated electrically or electro-pneumatically. Before a control lever may be moved into a position which would release other levers, an indication must be received from the field element that it has actually moved into the position requested. The locking bed shown is for a GRS power interlocking machine.|$|R
5000|$|The Hackworth {{valve gear}} is a design of valve gear used to {{regulate}} the flow of steam to the pistons in steam engines. It is a radial gear, with an <b>actuating</b> <b>lever</b> driven from the crank. The drive may be taken directly from the crank (top picture) or indirectly via a return crank (lower picture). The {{other end of the}} <b>actuating</b> <b>lever</b> is attached to a die block which slides in a slotted link. When the link is vertical, the engine is in mid-gear. Forward, reverse and cut-off adjustments are made by moving the link away from the vertical. The valve rod is pivoted to a point on the <b>actuating</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{throttle}} lever assembly is often designed to incorporate high-pressure (HP) cock switches {{so that the}} pilot has instinctive control of the fuel supply to the engine. Microswitches {{are located in the}} throttle box so that the throttle <b>levers</b> <b>actuate</b> the switches to shut the valves when the levers are at their aft end of travel. Pushing the levers forward automatically operates the switches to open the fuel cocks, which remain open during the normal operating range of the levers. Two distinct actions are required to actuate the switches again. The {{throttle lever}} must be pulled back to its aft position and a mechanical latch operated, or a detent (hard point) overcome, to allow the lever to travel further and shut off the fuel valve.|$|R
50|$|The {{rate of flow}} of {{the gases}} was {{controlled}} by the driver by means of dampers placed {{at the top of}} the superheater box.

5000|$|Shunting tank engines. 30 engines, {{designed}} {{under the}} supervision of C J Bowen-Cooke, and built at Crewe during 1911-1917. Intended for duties formerly needing two locomotives. Essentially a tank version of the G class 0-8-0s. When introduced they had the then new style of 12″ letters for the company's initials on the tank sides. They were fitted with saturated [...] "Precursor" [...] class boilers with lagged ends, round-top fireboxes, and sloping coal bunkers. The main wheels were coupled by three overlapping rods and the third pair of wheels were flangeless. <b>Lever</b> <b>actuated</b> Joy reversing gear appeared in-lieu of the normal Ramsbottom screw system. The earlier engines initially had slender tapered Cooke buffers but these were replaced by those of standard Webb pattern: The latter type was fitted from new on later engines. Braking was by steam, but vacuum brakes were provided to operate fitted or passenger stock if required.|$|R

50|$|Common small {{portable}} hoists are of {{two main}} types, the chain hoist or chain block and the wire rope or cable type. Chain hoists {{may have a}} <b>lever</b> to <b>actuate</b> the hoist or have a loop of operating chain that one pulls through the block (known traditionally as a chain fall) which then activates the block {{to take up the}} main lifting chain.|$|R
50|$|The cloth {{focal plane}} shutter has speeds from 1 sec to 1/1000 and B. The {{electronic}} flash sync. speed is 1/60. A delayed action timer gives 8 - 10 seconds delay, using the same front of body <b>lever</b> that <b>actuates</b> the stop-down metering. The mirror can be locked up for vibration reduction or for use with special FL lenses like the original 19mm f3.5 wide angle which projects deeply into the body and would foul the mirror.|$|R
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is built}} from welded 4130 steel tubing, with a 6061-T6 aluminum engine mount plate. In flight steering is accomplished via <b>levers</b> that <b>actuate</b> the canopy brakes, creating roll and yaw. On the ground the aircraft has lever-controlled nosewheel steering. The {{main landing gear}} incorporates spring rod suspension. The design uses an overhead adjustable canopy hang point, called a [...] "cg spreader bar" [...] to establish the correct canopy attachment point and hence the aircraft's flight attitude and torque offset.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{prototype}} {{was completed}} at the Swindon Works of the GWR (Lot 132) in February 1902. It was numbered 100 and in June 1902 was named Dean (later William Dean) {{to mark the}} latter's retirement. The new design incorporated all of Churchward's current ideas including a domeless parallel boiler, raised Belpaire firebox, 19 in diameter outside cylinders with 30 in piston stroke, and boiler pressure of [...] The piston valves were driven by rocking <b>levers</b> <b>actuated</b> by the expansion link of Stephenson valve gear - this particular design was only used on no. 100. The parallel boiler was later replaced with a taper boiler, and then the first superheated taper boiler in 1910. Churchward had studied American boiler design, {{but he was also}} later influenced by continental practice in efficient motion design. From the Société Alsacienne de Constructions Mécaniques (SACM) a de Glehn 4-4-2 compound engine was ordered for comparative trials on the GWR. According to E.C. Poultney, No. 100 was the first 4-6-0 locomotive to have high enough boiler capacity and steam ports large enough to handle the steam flow required by large cylinders: [...] "The engine probably influenced to a large extent the use made of engines of the 4-6-0 type". No.100 was renumbered 2900 in 1912, and was withdrawn from service in 1932.|$|R
50|$|A Wakefield mechanical-feed {{lubricator}} {{was arranged}} {{on the right-hand}} side running board and was operated through a <b>lever</b> and crank, <b>actuated</b> from the crosshead. Mechanical lubricators had the advantage that the rate of oil-feed was always proportional to the speed of the engine. This type of oil feed was later superseded for the sight-feed lubricator.|$|R
50|$|The TR6 and TR6R were renamed Tiger for 1969, {{leaving the}} TR6C model with the Trophy name. The front brake used a {{modified}} <b>actuating</b> <b>lever</b> to avoid snagging {{of the cable}} on the front mudguard. Other changes included the larger RM21 alternator and twin Windtone horns. The signature parcel grid was finally dropped for all models.|$|R
40|$|We {{assembled}} a chain {{composed of a}} periodic arrangement of aluminum and steel spheres encased in a 4 -rod polycarbonate holder with tunable static precompression applied {{by means of a}} <b>lever</b> <b>actuated</b> system. To excite periodic oscillations we perturbed the chain with a piezo-stack actuator driven by both continuous and finite bursts of a sinusoidally varying periodic signal. The amplitude of the periodic signal ranged from linear to strongly nonlinear regimes. We report the tunability of the frequency range for the band gap edges {{as a function of the}} material parameters, chain geometry and stress conditioning. We analyze the data by means of force-time plot and Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT). We observe a dramatic reduction of the transmitted wave amplitude for harmonic excitations with fundamental frequencies within the gap. The application of both continuous and short bursts of perturbation allows for observation of different dynamic phenomena at selected frequency ranges (in particular close to the lower optical branch edge). By varying the amplitude of the dynamic excitation (and therefore the level of the nonlinearity present in the system) we seek localized discrete breathing modes and surface instabilities. The comparison between continuum theory, discrete numerical modeling and experiments show a qualitative agreement and provide fundamental understanding for future investigation and numerous engineering applications. The challenges and considerations involved with the construction of an experimental system capable of capturing and leveraging on the described phenomena will be detailed...|$|R
50|$|Another mechanism, used on Stephenson's {{locomotives}} in the 1830s, was the 'coupled gab'. Two open gabs were used, as for {{the manual}} open gab, although in this case they were both operated automatically by a single reversing <b>lever.</b> One was <b>actuated</b> by a bellcrank, the other through a reversing linkage from this, so that as one engaged the other was already lifted clear.|$|R
5000|$|George Chinn {{notes about}} the 1907 model that: [...] "While it was gas {{actuated}} {{by means of}} a piston, the French reversed the conventional principle. Instead of the piston thrust rearward furnishing the source of energy to operate the piece, the gas propels the piston forward to unlock the bolt. The piston is attached by a spring-loaded rod to a gear rack. This in turn engages a spur gear which is fastened to an <b>actuating</b> <b>lever.</b> When the lever is in the forward horizontal position and engages a cam slot in the bolt, the gun is locked. Upon firing, the gas drives the piston forward, compressing the spring and causing the spur gear to rotate clockwise. The <b>actuating</b> <b>lever</b> turns with the gear for a half revolution, retracting the bolt and stopping at the rear horizontal position. The driving spring then forces the piston rearward, which reverses the action and returns the bolt to battery." ...|$|R

40|$|Apparatus and {{a method}} of {{capturing}} an orbiting spacecraft by attaching a grapple fixture are discussed. A probe is inserted into an opening, such as a rocket nozzle, in the spacecraft until {{a stop on the}} prove mechanism contacts the spacecraft. A <b>lever</b> is <b>actuated</b> releasing a spring loaded rod which moves axially along the probe removing a covering sleeve to expose spring loaded toffle fingers which pivot open engaging the side of the opening. The probe is shortened and tensioned by turning a screw thread, pressing the fingers inside of the opening to compress the spacecraft between the toggle fingers and the stop. A grapple fixture attached to the probe, which is thus secured to the spacecraft, is engaged by appropriate retrieval means such as a remote manipulator arm...|$|R
50|$|The Compact series {{had four}} models. On the Compact Duo dual manual organs, tone and volume were {{regulated}} by {{controls on the}} F/AR combination preamp, reverb and power supply unit. On most other models the tone controls and a bass section volume were located on an indented panel on {{the rear of the}} keyboard. Underneath the keyboards, a knee-high <b>lever</b> could be <b>actuated</b> for the tone boost feature, turned on by rocker levers on the console. All models had reverb except for the mini-compact.

50|$|Hammer and gong - The hammer <b>lever</b> (F) is <b>actuated</b> by pins or teeth (G) {{on one of}} the {{striking}} train wheels. As the wheel turns the pin lifts the hammer lever, until the lever slips off the pin, allowing the hammer to drop, hitting the gong (E). Early house clocks used traditional hemispherical shaped bells. Later house clocks used gongs made of long steel tubes or bars, which have a sound more like large church bells. Mantel and other small clocks use thick hardened steel wires, which are coiled into a spiral to save space.|$|R
5000|$|The MP5 has {{a hammer}} firing mechanism. The trigger group is housed inside an {{interchangeable}} polymer trigger module (with an integrated pistol grip) and {{equipped with a}} three-position fire mode selector {{that serves as the}} manual safety toggle. The [...] "S" [...] or Sicher position in white denotes weapon safe, [...] "E" [...] or Einzelfeuer in red represents single fire, and [...] "F" [...] or Feuerstoß (also marked in red) designates continuous fire. The SEF symbols appear {{on both sides of the}} plastic trigger group. The selector <b>lever</b> is <b>actuated</b> with the thumb of the shooting hand and is located only on the left side of the original SEF trigger group or on both sides of the ambidextrous trigger groups. The safety/selector is rotated into the various firing settings or safety position by depressing the tail end of the lever. Tactile clicks (stops) are present at each position to provide a positive stop and prevent inadvertent rotation. The [...] "safe" [...] setting disables the trigger by blocking the hammer release with a solid section of the safety axle located inside the trigger housing.|$|R
