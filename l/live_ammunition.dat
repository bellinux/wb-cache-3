5|$|Living {{conditions}} were primitive in the camp, with trainees housed either under canvas in tents or in Nissen huts {{and they were}} responsible for cooking their own meals. Correct military protocols were enforced: Officers were saluted and uniforms had to be clean, with brasses and boots shining on parade. At {{the end of each}} course the final exercise was a simulated night beach landing using <b>live</b> <b>ammunition.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, army forces {{stationed in}} the Pearl Roundabout fired <b>live</b> <b>ammunition</b> on hundreds of protesters who tried to re-occupy the site. At least 120 protesters were hurt and one was fatally wounded, bringing {{the number of deaths}} to seven. The Crown Prince offered dialogue with opposition parties. On 19 February, tens of thousands of protesters re-occupied Pearl Roundabout after the army was ordered to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|Using improvised weapons, {{the prisoners}} capture an armored vehicle and the prison helicopter, which Yates uses to kill Zamorro. The prisoners place {{a call to}} Wheeler's {{headquarters}} and inform him of the riot. Winter has little time to regain control before Wheeler will arrive to see the prison under siege, so orders the use of <b>live</b> <b>ammunition</b> against the prisoners.|$|E

50|$|A cheat {{cartridge}} is {{a device}} that connects to any sort of cartridge-based video game system. It allows a user to input special cheat codes to manipulate a game in a way not permitted by its original programming. Usually the effect is to gain infinite <b>lives,</b> <b>ammunition,</b> unlock secrets, or do things that would otherwise allow an unfair advantage (or disadvantage in some cases). Some games have codes to activate unreleased levels, weapons, or items {{that may not have}} been available normally, and some even have codes to access debug menus used by programmers (as for beta testing purposes). Equivalent non-cartridge devices have been released and sold for modern game systems that use optical media instead of cartridges to store games.|$|R
5|$|Exercises were {{conducted}} using <b>live</b> <b>ammunition</b> and explosives to make training as realistic as possible. Physical fitness was a prerequisite, with cross country runs and boxing matches to improve fitness. Speed and endurance marches {{were conducted}} {{up and down}} the nearby mountain ranges and over assault courses that included a zip-line over Loch Arkaig, all while carrying arms and full equipment. Training continued by day and night with river crossings, mountain climbing, weapons training, unarmed combat, map reading, and small boat operations on the syllabus.|$|E
5|$|His earlier {{insistence on}} not filming with <b>live</b> <b>ammunition</b> {{proved to be}} a good decision. Having been told while filming Angels with Dirty Faces that he would be doing a scene with real machine gun bullets (a common {{practice}} in the Hollywood of the time), Cagney refused and insisted the shots be added afterwards. As it turned out, a ricocheting bullet passed through exactly where his head would have been.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after 8:00pm, Colonel Peters ordered three {{companies}} of 120 {{men of the}} 6th to move as commanded by the governor and General Herbert to Camden Station. As they exited, they were assaulted by stones from the crowd, believing those of the 6th Regiment were armed only with blank cartridges. The troops returned fire, with <b>live</b> <b>ammunition</b> as they were equipped, and the frightened crowd retreated west across Fayette Street Bridge.|$|E
50|$|The {{trial of}} Habib el-Adly follows two streams of legal charges: the first {{pertains}} to profiteering activities, {{and the second}} pertains to allegations that el-Adly ordered the use of <b>live</b> <b>ammunitions</b> against the demonstrators, during the January 2011 protests in different Egyptian cities, and {{was responsible for the}} opening of different jails in Egypt during the protests in order to cause criminal unrest and justify the use of force. A fact-finding panel was formed to assess the responsibility for incidents of criminal unrest. On March 9 the Egyptian daily newspaper Almasry Alyoum reported that el-Adly's charges in this case may have been of a political rather than criminal nature; evidence made available to the fact-finding mission suggested that he might have acted on orders from former president Mubarak and not on his own accord.|$|R

50|$|In March 1988, {{since it}} was found that wooden cudgels were prone to shatter in beating Palestinians, plastic and fibre-glass truncheons were soon introduced. Within two years, the Swedish Branch of the Save the Children Fund {{estimated}} that some 23,600 to 29,000 children required medical assistance after being beaten by Israeli forces {{in the first two years}} of the Intifada, while in the same period, Palestinian attacks resulted in the death of five Israeli children.In August 1988 plastic bullets were introduced which retained effectiveness at 100 metres, out of range of stone-throwers, and were potentially lethal at 70 yards. Over 5 months, these munitions still killed 47 Palestinians, and injured a further 288 in riot dispersal clashes. By the autumn of 1988 the de facto rule permitted the use of <b>lived</b> <b>ammunition</b> against children caught stone-throwing or seen fleeing from a scene where such behavior had occurred, even if there was no impending risk to soldiers' lives.|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} day, army forces {{stationed in}} the Pearl Roundabout fired <b>live</b> <b>ammunition</b> on hundreds of protesters who tried to re-occupy the site. At least 120 protesters were hurt and one was fatally wounded, bringing {{the number of deaths}} to seven. The CP offered dialogue with opposition parties. On 19 February, tens of thousands of protesters re-occupied Pearl Roundabout after the army was ordered to withdraw. In March, martial law was declared and Saudi troops were called in. Despite the hard crackdown and official ban, the protests continued.|$|E
5|$|Winter knows from Yates that Irwin's {{ultimate}} goal is to raise the American flag upside down, a classic signal of distress. Irwin's men create havoc but ultimately are confronted by overwhelming numbers of guards, armed with <b>live</b> <b>ammunition.</b> Irwin orders the prisoners to stand down and elects to personally hoist the flag. After Winter's men, including Captain Peretz, disobey his orders and refuse to kill Irwin, Winter fatally shoots Irwin in the back as he lifts the flag.|$|E
5|$|Five police officers, {{who volunteered}} {{to carry out the}} execution, were each paid $300. The {{shooters}} used identical Winchester Model 94 rifles. One prison official selected each rifle at random from a table and handed them to another prison official sitting in a small room, out of sight. The second prison official would then load the rifle, and return it to the table. Four of the rifles were loaded with <b>live</b> <b>ammunition.</b> One was secretly loaded with a wax bullet so that none of the officers would be certain that they fired a deadly shot. The non-lethal cartridge was tested to ensure that the report and recoil was difficult to distinguish from a real cartridge.|$|E
50|$|A cheat cartridge's {{operation}} is simple. When powered on, the console {{will run the}} software stored on the cheat device. This is usually a menu from which the correct game is selected, and various cheats toggled on or off. When the user is ready, the device's software then runs the actual game. However, the activated cheats modify values in the game's code as it runs, producing the desired effects, such as infinite <b>lives</b> and <b>ammunition.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 1976, Finnish magician Aimo Leikas {{killed himself}} in front of a crowd while {{performing}} his Russian roulette act. He had been performing the act for about a year, selecting six bullets from a box of assorted <b>live</b> and dummy <b>ammunition.</b>|$|R
50|$|Possession {{of a live}} {{firearms}} {{round can}} lead to severe penalties. <b>Live</b> firearms <b>ammunition,</b> other than most shotgun ammunition, may only be purchased and possessed with the authority of a Firearm Certificate. Shotgun cartridges can be possessed by anybody {{over the age of}} 15 but no licence is required to hold such ammunition so long as the cartridges contain 5 or more shots. However, a licence covering possession of a firearm capable of firing shotgun ammunition is required for purchase.|$|R
5|$|While Cagney was in New York, his brother, who had {{effectively}} {{become his}} agent, angled {{for a substantial}} pay raise and more personal freedom for his brother. The success of The Public Enemy and Blonde Crazy forced Warner Bros.' hand. They eventually offered Cagney a contract for $1000 a week. Cagney's first film upon returning from New York was 1932's Taxi!. The film is notable for not only being {{the first time that}} Cagney danced on screen, but it was also the last time he allowed himself to be shot at with <b>live</b> <b>ammunition</b> (a relatively common occurrence at the time, as blank cartridges and squibs were considered too expensive and hard to find to use in most motion picture filming). He had been shot at in The Public Enemy, but during filming for Taxi!, he was almost hit.|$|E
5|$|At 8:32a.m., FAA {{officials}} were notified Flight 11 had been hijacked and {{they in turn}} notified the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). NORAD scrambled two F-15s from Otis Air National Guard Base in Massachusetts and they were airborne by 8:53a.m. Because of slow and confused communication from FAA officials, NORAD had 9minutes' notice that Flight 11 had been hijacked, and no notice {{about any of the}} other flights before they crashed. After both of the Twin Towers had already been hit, more fighters were scrambled from Langley Air Force Base in Virginia at 9:30a.m. At 10:20a.m. Vice President Dick Cheney issued orders to shoot down any commercial aircraft that could be positively identified as being hijacked. These instructions were not relayed in time for the fighters to take action. Some fighters took to the air without <b>live</b> <b>ammunition,</b> knowing that to prevent the hijackers from striking their intended targets, the pilots might have to intercept and crash their fighters into the hijacked planes, possibly ejecting at the last moment.|$|E
5|$|On 28September2000, then-opposition {{leader of}} Israel Ariel Sharon {{and members of}} the Likud Party, along with 1,000 armed guards, visited the al-Aqsa compound; a large group of Palestinians went to protest the visit. After Sharon and the Likud Party members left, a {{demonstration}} erupted and Palestinians {{on the grounds of the}} Haram al-Sharif began throwing stones and other projectiles at Israeli riot police. Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at the crowd, injuring 24 people. The visit sparked a five-year uprising by the Palestinians, commonly referred to as the al-Aqsa Intifada, though some commentators, citing subsequent speeches by PA officials, particularly Imad Falouji and Arafat himself, claim that the Intifada had been planned months in advance, as early as July upon Yasser Arafat's return from Camp David talks. On 29September, the Israeli government deployed 2,000 riot police to the mosque. When a group of Palestinians left the mosque after Friday prayers (Jumu'ah,) they hurled stones at the police. The police then stormed the mosque compound, firing both <b>live</b> <b>ammunition</b> and rubber bullets at the group of Palestinians, killing four and wounding about 200.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{museums in}} Hanstholm, {{one of which}} enables {{visitors}} to go down into the World War II bunkers, see how the soldiers <b>lived,</b> drive the <b>ammunition</b> train from ammunition depots to the cannons, and get an impression of how huge they were.|$|R
50|$|The {{hardware}} and software used limit what types of games a Laser Quest center can hold. Up to four different groups of settings can be created; it is normal for everyone on a team {{to have the same}} settings, though this is not required. When giving packs within a team different settings, the packs will not be visibly different in-game, with the exception of 'sentinel' packs that have the ability to give <b>lives</b> and <b>ammunition</b> to teammates. These packs are identified by an alternate light pattern on the front and back sensor.|$|R
2500|$|The 2013 Annual Report on the Protection of the Constitution by the German Federal Ministry of the Interior {{said that}} as a result of a June 2013 search by police in three German federal states [...] "two <b>live</b> arms with <b>ammunition,</b> blank-firing guns, batons, {{electric}} stun guns and Samurai swords" [...] were seized from members of the Grey Wolves.|$|R

25|$|A {{general strike}} and demonstrations across {{northern}} Israel began on 1 October and continued for several days. In some cases, the demonstrations escalated into clashes with the Israeli police involving rock-throwing, firebombing, and live-fire. Policemen used tear-gas {{and opened fire}} with rubber-coated bullets and later <b>live</b> <b>ammunition</b> in some instances, many times in contravention of police protocol governing riot-dispersion. This use of <b>live</b> <b>ammunition</b> was directly linked {{with many of the}} deaths by the Or Commission.|$|E

5|$|Batwoman {{appears in}} , voiced by Yvonne Strahovski. This version of Batwoman has {{military}} training but is berated by Batman for using <b>live</b> guns and <b>ammunition</b> in combat. Her lesbianism is freely addressed {{by her father}} at one point early in the film and she is shown meeting Renee Montoya, who comes to her house {{at the end of}} the movie.|$|R
50|$|Ownership of handguns is {{forbidden}} to the public, hunting rifles and ceremonial swords are {{registered with the}} police, and the manufacture and sale of firearms are regulated. The production and sale of <b>live</b> and blank <b>ammunition</b> are also controlled, as are the transportation and importation of all weapons. Crimes are seldom committed with firearms, yet knives remain a problem {{that the government is}} looking into, especially after the Akihabara massacre.|$|R
25|$|Union Brig. Gen. Thomas Ewing, Jr. {{moved with}} {{reinforcements}} down the railroad from St. Louis to Ironton to retard Price's advance. On {{the morning of}} September 27, Price attacked, driving the Federals back into their defenses, which were anchored by Fort Davidson, a redoubt of earthworks and wooden palisades near a hill called Pilot Knob. After maneuvering elements of his army onto the hills surrounding the fort, Price launched repeated assaults {{in the late afternoon}} hours, suffering horrific casualties. During the night, the Federals quietly evacuated the structure and then blew up its powder magazine with a timed fuse. Though he had taken the field, Price had paid a high price in <b>lives</b> and <b>ammunition,</b> giving Union forces the necessary time to concentrate and oppose his raid, while gaining little if any lasting military value.|$|R
25|$|Although the {{military}} has denied using <b>live</b> <b>ammunition,</b> autopsy reports indicated that the students had been shot with live rounds from a distance.|$|E
25|$|On 29 September 2000, the {{day after}} Sharon's visit, {{following}} Friday prayers, large riots broke out around the Old City of Jerusalem. After Palestinians on the Temple Mount threw rocks over the Western Wall at Jewish worshippers, Israeli police fired back. The switch to <b>live</b> <b>ammunition</b> occurred when the chief of Jerusalem's police force was knocked unconscious by a rock. Police then switched to <b>live</b> <b>ammunition,</b> killing four Palestinian youths. Up to 200 Palestinians and police were injured. Another three Palestinians {{were killed in the}} Old City and on the Mount of Olives. By the end of the day, 7 Palestinians had been killed and 300 had been wounded. 70 Israeli policemen were also injured in the clashes.|$|E
25|$|As {{word of the}} {{incident}} spread throughout the occupied territories, confrontations broke out in which a further 20 Palestinians were killed and 120 injured. In the first 6 days following the massacre, 21 Palestinians were killed by <b>live</b> <b>ammunition</b> from the IDF.|$|E

50|$|As {{with all}} such weapons, {{it can be}} fired from the shoulder, hip, or underarm position. However, to achieve the maximum {{effective}} range, {{it is recommended that}} a bipod-steadied position or a tripod-mounted position be used and fired in bursts of 3-5 rounds. The weapon is heavy and difficult to aim when firing without support, though the weight helps reduce the felt recoil. The large grip also allowed the weapon to be conveniently carried at the hip. The gun can be stripped using a <b>live</b> round of <b>ammunition</b> as a tool.|$|R
50|$|For {{the final}} {{three and a half}} weeks of training, the class goes offshore, about 60 miles from Coronado to San Clemente Island. On the island, the class {{practices}} the skills they learned in third phase. The days become longer and more work intensive, set to mirror the work hours spent in the field. Many students view this as one of the hardest parts of training, as training is conducted seven days a week, with very minimal sleep, all while handling <b>live</b> explosives and <b>ammunition.</b> Interaction with instructors is also never ending, and punishments are at their harshest levels yet.|$|R
