5000|$|The distinctive, and unusual, {{feature of}} the engine was its use of wet liners to form the {{cylinders}}. Rather than the cylinders being bored into the cast-iron block, separate thin-walled steel tubes were inserted into a hollow block. The space between liner and block formed a large uninterrupted water jacket, which improved cooling, as did the thin tubes of the liners. The liners only loosely installed into the block with hand pressure. They sealed into the block at the bottom {{by a pair of}} soft metal [...] "spectacle washers" [...] that each sealed a pair of liners. Each liner stood slightly proud of the cylinder block face. so that it formed a good seal against the head gasket when assembled. Such wet liners had been used in high performance engines for many years, but this was an early use of them for a <b>low-cost,</b> <b>mass-production</b> engine. Particularly with the advanced grinding techniques necessary to make such a thin-walled tube with good concentricity and surface finish, other manufacturers saw them as over-complex. However Banner Lane's building of sleeve-valve Bristol engines during the war had given them the necessary experience and equipment. Throughout the engine's service it was seen as a dependable and reliable, if slightly staid and tractor-like, engine and these liners never gave the trouble experienced by other engines such as the much later Rover K-series.|$|E

40|$|Semiconductor {{corrugated}} {{ridge waveguide}} (CRW) distributed feedback (DFB) lasers offer compelling advantages over standard DFB lasers. Indeed, {{the use of}} surface gratings etched on the ridge waveguide sidewalls in CRW-DFB devices avoids any epitaxial overgrowth. This provides a considerable simplification in the fabrication process, reducing cost and time of manufacturing, and ultimately increasing yield. It offers also the potential for monolithic integration with other devices, paving the way towards <b>low-cost</b> and <b>mass-production</b> of photonics integrated circuits. In recent years, the re-consideration of growth-free DFB lasers has drawn considerable attention, particularly with the current state-of-the-art photolithography machines. In this work, we present an experimental investigation on two generations of InGaAsP/InP multiple-quantum-well (MQW) CRW-DFB lasers that have been fabricated using stepper lithography. An early developed 1310 nm CRW-DFB laser showed stable single mode with high side-mode suppression ratios (SMSR) (> 50 dB), albeit with thresholds higher than anticipated. A subsequent single-mode 1550 nm CRW-DFB laser showed stable operation with SMSR (> 50 dB) and narrow spectral linewidths (≤ 250 kHz), observed {{for a wide range}} of current injection. Besides, novel multi-electrode CRW-DFB lasers have been tested. The experimental investigation showed that narrower linewidth (3 nm) have been recorded using different multi-electrode current injection configurations. The application of a time-domain modeling approach for semiconductor CRW-DFB lasers is then described for the first time. We numerically studied the effect of the radiation modes on CRW-DFB laser properties by using time-domain coupled wave equations. High-order corrugated gratings with λ/ 4 phase-shit were analyzed, where the degree of longitudinal spatial hole burning (LSHB) can be effectively reduced by means of fine tuning of the grating duty cycle. Additionally, we showed how the side-mode suppression ratio can be predicted depending on the device geometry...|$|R

Agriculture is now required {{to be concerned with}} the quality of food, ecosystem services, inclusion of marginalized populations, revitalization of rural territories, energy production, etc. This opening up of the future of agriculture encourages rural actors to experiment with new farming systems, using imagination, creativity and determination to replace dominant models. At the same time, <b>low-cost</b> <b>mass-production</b> systems continue on their way, with promises of a future based on green technologies.

What role can research and public policies play in supporting the emergence of these innovations? This book takes the debate beyond the purely technical options and considers social and institutional innovations as well. It demonstrates that innovation is the result of a confrontation between visions of actors who often have divergent interests. There is no single path towards sustainable development and we must find ways to encourage the emergence and co-existence of different types of agriculture and food systems.

40|$|Abstract. Reducing the {{resource}} requirements of various electronic devices is continually being demanded, {{and the research}} and development of miniaturized and highly efficient MEMS devices is being actively pursued. Although, the manufacture of tip-shaped devices is easy using MEMS technology, it is, in general, difficult to manufacture three dimensional structures. A nanofabrication technology aiming at the mass production of three dimensional structures would be a very welcome addition to the range of technologies currently in use. One process which has been attracting attention is a molding process for resins using microstructural molds manufactured using the LIGA process. In this research, we manufactured a capacitive type inclination sensor using this LIGA based process. By using this molding process, the production cost can be kept low compared with the processes used currently for these types of sensors. A silicon mold with a pattern size of 7 × 7 mm 2 and a structure height of 100 µm etched by ICP dry etching was produced. The pattern in the silicon mold was transferred to a resin by hot embossing, and assembled to produce an inclination sensor. Evaluation of the inclination sensor showed it to have good linear performance. We expect that these techniques can be introduced to the <b>low-cost</b> <b>mass-production</b> of other MEMS devices (including sensors), so that the range of applications can be further expanded to new areas of technology and industry...|$|E
40|$|The use of ultra high {{strength}} steels (UHSS) in {{the automotive industry}} presents a significant opportunity for continued vehicle light-weighting, due to possible strength-to-weight improvements of {{three to four times}} that of conventional sheet steel grades. This performance benefit is achievable whist maintaining most of the advantages of <b>low-cost</b> <b>mass-production</b> associated with the cold stamping of sheet steel for automotive body components. However, the introduction of UHSS can result in significantly increased wear of the stamping tools, which is difficult to predict at the design stage and can lead to unexpected process failure during mass-production. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} be able to monitor and predict the onset of severe wear, such that the best course of condition-based maintenance can be scheduled and unscheduled stoppages due to tool wear eradicated. This paper describes a novel active monitoring system that is being developed by researchers at Deakin University, The Australian National University and Ford Motor Company, Asia Pacific and Africa. The aim of the active monitoring system is to detect the initial onset of a change of state, such as wear, through the measurement of variables such as punch force and audio signals. A semi-industrial stamping process, using a progressive die setup and {{high strength}} steel sheet with hardened tool steel tooling, is the experimental basis for the initial model and system development...|$|E
40|$|Microfluidics {{has emerged}} as a {{valuable}} tool for the high-resolution patterning of biological probes on solid supports. Yet, its widespread adoption as a universal biological immobilization tool is still limited by several technical challenges, particularly for the patterning of isolated spots using three-dimensional (3 D) channel networks. A key limitation arises from the difficulties to adapt the techniques and materials typically used in prototyping to <b>low-cost</b> <b>mass-production.</b> In this paper, we present the fabrication of thin thermoplastic elastomer membranes with microscopic through-holes using a hot-embossing process that is compatible with high-throughput manufacturing. The membranes provide the basis for the fabrication of highly integrated 3 D microfluidic devices with a footprint of only 1 7 1 cm 2.

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} impact of recent CMOS process {{technology}} shrinks on analogue integrated circuit design. Two LNAs in a wireless communication application serve as an application example for the investigation. Two LNAs have been implemented in a contemporary 65 nm standard CMOS process technology for usage in a low-cost low-power mobile 2. 5 G GSM receiver front-end. The first LNA serves the GSM low bands whereas the second LNA serves the GSM high bands. The underlying LNA architecture, consisting of two cascaded differential stages with capacitive feedback, achieves appropriate gain, noise and linearity performance at moderate current consumption while omitting die area consuming integrated inductors. The LNAs are embedded into the zero-IF receiver front-end of a complete GSM SoC transceiver solution that will enter mass production {{by the beginning of}} 2009. Due to the manifold interdependencies and interactions with other receiver front-end components like the quadrature down-conversion mixer, the LNAs have been designed and evaluated {{in the context of a}} complete analogue receiver front-end in close cooperation with a business partner from the industrial wireless communication background. The performance specifications for the receiver front-end and the individual circuit blocks have been derived directly from the official 3 GPP GSM system specifications. With the specification requirements in mind it has been elaborated on the choice of a direct-conversion receiver as the most reasonable wireless receiver topology for <b>low-cost</b> <b>mass-production</b> in standard CMOS technologies. Design challenges i. e. {{the impact of}} flicker noise on the receiver sensitivity are countered by an innovative mixer architecture with a passive current-commutating stage and a careful design of the receiver baseband circuit blocks. The developed GSM transceiver is a transfer and adaptation of a 130 nm GSM chip to the special environment introduced by a 65 nm low-power CMOS process technology. Consequently the impact of CMOS technology scaling on analogue and RF circuit design in terms of amplifying potential, noise and linearity performance has been analysed in a profound model based comparison of transistor unit cells and passive components in a 130 nm and a 65 nm CMOS process technology. It is illustrated that the amplifying potential of transistors gM/gDS with minimum gate lengths l is severely deteriorated when going from l= 120 nm to l= 60 nm devices. Moreover, an inferior noise performance is observed for minimum channel length transistor devices. It is also shown that for realistic bias conditions the individual transistor device with l= 60 nm exhibits less odd order distortion than with l= 120 nm. The performance of the designed and implemented analogue circuit blocks of the receiver frontend have been evaluated by pre-layout and post-layout circuit simulation results with a special focus on the LNAs. The LNAs achieve satisfactory S 11 18. 3 dB, CP 1 i> 22. 8 dBm and IIP 3 >- 14. 1 dBm in all four GSM frequency bands. The noise figures are an excellent NF 58. 3 dB and NF 54. 0 dB and NF - 16. 3 dBm while IIP 2 > 42. 2 dBm. The good accordance between simulation results and measurement results gives rise to superior product-ready performance expectations for future testchips. The overall transfer of the receiver front-end under investigation from a 130 nm CMOS technology to a 65 nm technology is considered successful. The work is concluded by a summary of prospects of future CMOS process technology nodes with respect to analogue and RF circuit design. After the constraints and limits of conventional deep sub-micron CMOS devices have been pointed out, light is shed on promising approaches to overcome these roadblocks on the ITRS. The ongoing shrink of CMOS process technologies is driven by the semiconductor manufacturers’ desire to integrate given electrical functionality on less die area and consequently reduce the production costs in mass production. Thus the economical benefits of future CMOS process technology shrinks are briefly investigated. It is stressed that significant economical benefits result only for the miniaturisation of systems with a large amount of digital functionality of extended feature sets...|$|E
40|$|The {{realization}} of the first bipolar junction transistor in the year 1948 by Bardeen, Brattain and Shockley [1] sparked off the semiconductor industry, which gradually revolutionized the way we live. Nowadays, semiconductors are the fundamental building blocks of every high-tech electronic device, most notably the computer which has become an inescapable part of our daily lives. Besides voltage and current control capabilities, semiconductors exhibit intriguing opto-electronic properties; the best known and commercially most successful applications are light emitting diodes (LEDs), laser diodes, charged coupled devices (CCD) and solar cells. [2, 3, 4] Due to the broad variety of material systems, they cover virtually the complete optical spectrum while simultaneously being cost-efficient and easy to miniaturize. Until the late 90 ies, commercially available devices were exclusively based on inorganic semiconductors, primarily on Silicon. However, over the last decade, the class of organic semiconductors has gained an increasing amount of interest, e. g., {{now one of the}} most popular smartphone’s display 1 is based on OLED 2 -technology. Flexibility upon stress and deeper color contrasts are typically named as their main advantages over conventional liquid crystal displays (LCD). While organic semiconductor devices are already well established as light emitters, they are still in research state as light harvesters. In general, organic solar cells offer high photon cross sections in combination with similar flexibility as OLED displays. Additionally, they exhibit the potential for <b>low-cost</b> <b>mass-production,</b> including innovative and versatile procedures such as ink-jet printing. [6, 7] However, two major challenges still exist which need to be addressed before organic solar cells become compatible: the long-term stability and the quantum efficiency. [8] The fast degradation of organic solar cells is caused by oxidation, reduction and thermal instabilities. Research in this field focuses on the synthesis of new organic molecules, thus, it can be assigned to the organic chemistry sector. Quantum efficiencies are determined by the microscopic photon to carrier conversion, i. e., the photovoltaic effect, therefore, it is predominantly a research topic of solid state physics. This thesis focuses mainly on aspects of the quantum efficiency in the polyacene Perfluoropentacene (PFP) and its underlying decay processes, namely the electronic relaxation dynamics after optical excitation. In particular, the process of singlet exciton fission is analyzed which promises to double the quantum efficiencies, as it converts one singlet exciton into two triplet excitons. [9] Excitons are correlated electron and hole pairs: neutral excitations of the crystal after absorption of a photon. Singlet exciton fission was first proposed in 1968 in order to explain the drastic photoluminescence quench of Tetracene crystals compared to Anthracene crystals. [10] It has gained renewed attention lately, due to its potential application in the growing field of organic solar cells. However, the microscopic understanding is still in its infancy which hampers essential progress in this field; for instance, the influence of the geometrical order of the molecules within the crystal on singlet exciton fission has only been analyzed theoretically. The reason is the lack of single crystal samples allowing for the correlation of molecular packing and electronic dynamics. [9] This issue is resolved in Chapter 5 for the model system of PFP single crystals, where for the first time the singlet exciton fission dynamics are observed along the three crystal axes by polarization-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy. Moreover, the efficient coupling direction is identified as well as the preceding electronic species of the two triplet excitons. Although spectroscopic analysis on polyacenes date back to the 40 ies [11], lack of computational power and interest lead to the sad state that even interpretations of the linear absorption are still debated today. However, basic knowledge of the linear absorption is essential in order to interpret the non-linear dynamics. Therefore, Chapter 4 serves as a precursor, where the linear absorption of the PFP samples is interpreted using phenomenological models. Here, first indications are given for a dominant coupling direction within the PFP crystal which are then confirmed in Chapter 5. Furthermore, the amount of exciton splitting in PFP is determined, also known as the Davydov-splitting. [12] It is induced by dipole coupling between the two basis molecules of the crystal lattice during excitation. In Chapter 6 the focus is shifted to inorganic semiconductors. The chapter introduces a fast and convenient method to determine dephasing times of induced coherent exciton polarizations with more precision than a common lineshape analysis of the absorption spectrum. In pump-probe spectroscopy, the transients of the coherent oscillations are exploited to serve as phase indicators for the several excitonic transitions. These transients are observed during the coherent regime before pump and probe pulses perfectly overlap in time. [13] As a proof of principle, the methodology is applied to a set of Germanium quantum well samples and evaluated in respect to their optical quality. In addition, the main dephasing mechanism in Germanium quantum wells is identified. These three chapters capture the results of the thesis and are preceded by introductory chapters covering basic light-matter interactions and experimental details; they are succeeded by a conclusion chapter summarizing the essential findings...|$|E
