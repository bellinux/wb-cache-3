5|$|Able and Baker are {{the first}} two <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet, used from 1941 until 1956. Alpha and Bravo are their {{counterparts}} in the current NATO phonetic alphabet. Charlie is the third letter in both systems. According to eyewitness accounts, the time of detonation for each test was announced as H or How hour; in the official JTF-1 history, the term M or Mike hour is used instead.|$|E

During subsequent trips to Los Angeles he placed mosaics on the eight other <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sign.|$|E

Permitted characters within a URI are the ASCII characters for the lowercase and uppercase <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modern English alphabet, the Arabic numerals, hyphen, period, underscore, and tilde. Octets represented {{by any other}} character must be percent-encoded.|$|E
5|$|The name-letter {{effect is}} the {{tendency}} of people to prefer the letters in their name over other letters in the alphabet. Whether subjects are asked to rank all <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alphabet, rate each of the letters, choose the letter they prefer out {{of a set of}} two, or pick a small set of letters they most prefer, on average people consistently like the letters in their own name the most. Crucially, subjects are not aware that they are choosing letters from their name.|$|E
5|$|Unconscious {{self-regulation}} {{has been}} found to increase under psychological threat. For the effect to be one of unconscious self-regulation it too should increase under threat. Jones, Pelham, Mirenberg, and Hetts found that when people who were high in explicit self-esteem were exposed to a psychological threat, they showed exaggerated name-letter preferences. In contrast, low self-esteem participants showed evidence of the opposite tendency. Komori and Murata later replicated this response to threat with Japanese bilinguals who were asked to select preferred <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English alphabet.|$|E

Her <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time show interest in Albert's education for the role {{he would have to}} play, although she resisted attempts to rush her into marriage. In the winter of 1838–39, the prince visited Italy, accompanied by the Coburg family's confidential adviser, Baron Stockmar.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids {{are made}} into {{proteins}} by being joined {{together in a}} chain of peptide bonds. Each different protein has a unique sequence of amino acid residues: this is its primary structure. Just as the <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alphabet can be combined to form an almost endless variety of words, amino acids can be linked in varying sequences to form a huge variety of proteins. Proteins are made from amino acids that have been activated by attachment to a transfer RNA molecule through an ester bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA precursor is produced in an ATP-dependent reaction carried out by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the ribosome, which joins the amino acid onto the elongating protein chain, using the sequence information in a messenger RNA.|$|E
5|$|Cross-lingual {{studies were}} {{performed}} at 13 European universities, using 12 different languages, viz. Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek (the {{only one with}} a non-Roman alphabet), Hungarian, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, and Spanish. Because the original yoked design did not lend itself well to long-distance research and standardization, it {{was replaced by a}} simpler, easier to replicate experimental design. Subjects were asked to mark the six capital letters they liked most in a randomized list containing all <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local alphabet, again without giving it much thought. They had to mark their first preference with 1, their second with 2, etc. The new method was first applied in Belgium. When results showed the name-letter effect at work again, it was copied in the other countries. A total of 2,047 subjects participated, all students.|$|E

5|$|Most {{people like}} themselves; {{the name is}} {{associated}} with the self, and hence the <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> name are preferred, {{despite the fact that they}} appear in many other words. People who do not like themselves tend not to exhibit the name-letter effect. A similar effect has been found for numbers related to birthdays: people tend to prefer the number signifying the day of the month on which they were born. Alternative explanations for the name-letter effect, such as frequent exposure and early mastery, have been ruled out. In psychological assessments, the Name Letter Preference Task is widely used to estimate implicit self-esteem.|$|E
5|$|Scholz saw the {{manuscript}} in 1845, and Paul de Lagarde in 1853, {{but they did}} not decipher it. The lower text of the codex was deciphered, transcribed, and edited by Tregelles in 1861. Tregelles used types originally cast for printing the Codex Alexandrinus, which only approximately represented the shape of the <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> codex. The hand-written letters are smaller than the type. Tregelles included one page of typographical facsimile in this edition. He did not decipher the small Patristic writing and doubted that it could be read without chemical restoration.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the ninth}} century, English {{has been written}} in a Latin {{alphabet}} (also called Roman alphabet). Earlier Old English texts in Anglo-Saxon runes are only short inscriptions. The great majority of literary works in Old English that survive to today are written in the Roman alphabet. The modern English alphabet contains 26 <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Latin script: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z (which also have capital forms: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).|$|E

25|$|As <b>the</b> last <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greek alphabet, Omega {{is often}} used to denote the last, the end, or <b>the</b> {{ultimate}} limit <b>of</b> a set, in contrast to alpha, <b>the</b> first <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greek alphabet.|$|R
5|$|The Letter Preference Task is the second-most popular {{method to}} measure {{implicit}} self-esteem, surpassed {{only by the}} Implicit Association Test. The task has also been called the Name Letter Preference Task, Name-Letter-Ratings Measure, and Initial Preference Task. There is no standard method for applying the task. The most commonly used one is a letter rating task, which involves having participants judge all the <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alphabet. Even within this method there are variations in the instructions (how much you like the letters or how attractive you find them), in the rating scales (five-point, seven-point, or nine-point), {{in the order of}} the letters (random or alphabetical), and in data collection (paper-and-pencil or computer-based).|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{names were}} used for named storms in the North Atlantic in 2005. The names not retired from this list were used again in the 2011 season. This is the same list used in the 1999 season. The names Franklin, Lee, Maria, Nate, Ophelia, Philippe, Rita, Stan, Tammy, Vince and Wilma {{were used for}} Atlantic storms {{for the first time}} in 2005. Also, the 2005 season ran out of named storms so they used <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greek Alphabet such as Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon and Zeta.|$|E

Some Rebbes requested from the Hasid a sum of money equal to twice the numerical value of the Hebrew word Chai (life), which equals 18.
