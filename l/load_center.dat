40|$|Globalisation and the {{development}} of the international transport network have increased the role of ports as nodes in the global logistics and supply chain systems. Meanwhile, seaports encounter great challenges, uncertainties and risks than ever before. The development of different markets has contributed to intensifying competition in the port industry (Haezendonck & Notteboom, 2002). The reform of liner shipping service networks as well as the increased bargaining power of the shipping lines, has contributed to the deterioration of existing ports and to {{the development}} of new ones which, in turn, causes change in market structure and port hierarchy. Container ports, in particular, have not only encountered competition from the large <b>load</b> <b>centers</b> in the same port range but also from the medium and small <b>load</b> <b>centers</b> having the same hinterland and, to some extent, from <b>load</b> <b>centers</b> in other port ranges.

The aim of this paper is to assess the competitiveness level of hub-ports and to analyse the impact of inter-port competition on the Mediterranean container market structure. In doing so, the research is divided into five sections. The first section comprises a general introduction that includes research aims and the research plan.
