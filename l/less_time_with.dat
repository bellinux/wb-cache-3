5|$|March {{was more}} {{successful}} in selling large numbers of customer cars in the lower formulae. Mosley organised extensive test sessions for the 1971 cars for journalists and drivers, and arranged a successful scheme for drivers to rent cars and engines for the season, rather than buying them outright. Losing money on a deal to supply Jochen Neerpasch, then motorsport manager at Ford, with a Formula Two car paid off when Neerpasch moved to BMW and offered March an exclusive deal to use BMW's Formula Two engine for the 1973 season. March cars powered by BMW engines won five of the next 11 European Formula Two championships. However, BMW also put pressure on Herd {{to concentrate on the}} Formula Two programme. As a result, he spent <b>less</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> the Formula One team, where Mosley started to act as a race engineer.|$|E
5|$|After being {{released}} from prison for assaulting a teenage boy who propositioned Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), Tony joins his partner Bianca Butcher (Patsy Palmer) and her family in Walford, including her son Morgan Jackson-King, whom he has adopted. It is revealed {{that he is a}} paedophile who has been grooming and sexually abusing Whitney, Bianca's adopted daughter, since she was 12. He immediately resumes his sexual relationship with Whitney, despite his displeasure at her more adult appearance, insisting she remove her make-up and jewellery. When Whitney gets a role in the school play, Romeo and Julie, Tony is angry about having <b>less</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> her, becoming jealous of her co-star Peter Beale (Thomas Law). Tony deceives Whitney into believing they will run away and start a new life together when she turns sixteen. Whitney gives him money she has been keeping for his return, which he gives Bianca as a deposit for a flat. Tony assaults Peter {{as a result of his}} growing jealousy, and is nearly reported to the police by Peter's sister Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield). Whitney convinces Lucy not to go to the police, but not before Lucy tells Bianca what happened. When Bianca angrily tells Tony that she is not a child anymore, he realizes he is no longer attracted to her.|$|E

This is not to be, however, as a race of beings known as the Anglar rise from the acidic oceans of Venom, thought to be unable to support life. The leader of the Anglar plans on {{destroying}} the Lylat system, which Fox McCloud and crew set out to save. The Star Fox team has broken up, but re-assembles to fight the threat. Peppy is made the General of the Cornerian Army, replacing Pepper. Fox flew around the Lylat system with ROB on patrol, and Krystal broke off her relationship with Fox after she left the team, because he was afraid she would receive injury and it would affect him. Slippy finds love with a frog named Amanda, and spends <b>less</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> the team. Falco left the team and went around on solo missions (as he has done before in Star Fox Adventures), spending <b>less</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> a team also.

500|$|Over {{the course}} of the group's existence, several hundred people joined and left. In the early 1990s, their {{membership}} dwindled, numbering as few as 26; these defections gave Applewhite a sense of urgency. In May 1993, the group took the name [...] "Total Overcomers Anonymous". They then spent $30,000 to publish a full-page advertisement in USA Today that warned of catastrophic judgment to befall the Earth. Its publication led about 20former members to rejoin the group. This, along with a series of public lectures in 1994, caused membership to double from its nadir {{at the beginning of the}} decade. By this time, Applewhite did not regiment his disciples' lives as strictly as he had and spent <b>less</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> them.|$|E
500|$|Thereafter, Mandela {{rejected}} Lembede's Africanism {{and embraced}} {{the idea of}} a multi-racial front against apartheid. Influenced by friends like Moses Kotane and by the Soviet Union's support for wars of national liberation, his mistrust of communism broke down and he began reading literature by Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, and Mao Zedong, eventually embracing the Marxist philosophy of dialectical materialism. Commenting on communism, he later stated that he [...] "found [...] strongly drawn to {{the idea of a}} classless society which, to [...] mind, was similar to traditional African culture where life was shared and communal." [...] In April 1952, Mandela began work at the H.M.

2500|$|Denisof complimented {{the season}} three Angel episode [...] "Billy", in which Wesley tries to murder Fred after {{becoming}} supernaturally misogynous, [...] "because {{it was the}} first real dark change in Wesley to experiment with". Discussing Wesley's betrayal of his friends to protect Angel's baby, Denisof explains, It isn't that he's purely bad or purely good, we're discovering a deeper and more complicated area of the character where good and bad aren't as clear, where Wesley does something motivated, he thinks, for the good of all [...] i.e. saving Connor and relieving Angel of the responsibility of murdering his son [...] and in doing so creates the situation in which the baby could be kidnapped, Angel loses his son and Wesley has his throat slit for the trouble. So it's grey rather than black or white. Science fiction magazine Starburst said that [...] "somber, subdued, bearded Wesley is worlds away from the foolish, pompous Wesley". Denisof says of the period, [...] "It was a great opportunity to explore some of the character's darker layers. You couldn't have predicted it when he arrived in Sunnydale. This was an important element to introduce and explore, to be consistent with the show and to continue the organic exploration of all the characters." [...] Whilst the character spent <b>less</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> his old friends, Denisof was [...] "more or less isolated from the , barring one or two scenes of mild confrontation when they would come to visit me and we'd chew each other out. There's definitely a cold war going on with Wesley versus the world." [...] Wesley's dark attitude is alleviated somewhat when the gang decide to take over Wolfram & Hart. The tension between Wesley and his co-workers did not go away because of the mind-wipe but because [...] "we decided we were better off as a team than as separate entities. And we had to put our differences behind us and build our trust again as a group." [...] Discussing the way Wesley's English accent softens over the course of Angel, Denisof says, [...] just sits on him better. As an actor, it just felt that organically the way he was changing, and it also seemed to be accurate when you consider the amount of time he's spent in L.A. that the accent could have softened. And since he isn't surrounded by upper-crust academics as he was as a young Watcher in the Academy in England, it's understandable that he is changing the way he speaks and changing his voice, his delivery, {{as a result of his}} environment.|$|E

Based on a self-completion survey of 2078 14 - 16 -year-olds (mean age of 15 years) attending seven standard state-run secondary schools in south London, an assessment was made of rates and risk factors for cannabis use. Twenty-four per cent {{of the total sample}} had ever used cannabis, with 15 % having done so in the month prior to assessment. In addition to greater likelihood of illicit drug use, lifetime cannabis users were less likely to spend <b>time</b> regularly <b>with</b> both their mothers and fathers, but more likely to spend free <b>time</b> <b>with</b> friends who smoked, drank alcohol and used illicit drugs, and with friends involved in criminal activities.
