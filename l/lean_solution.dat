5000|$|Ford's early success, however, was not sustainable. As James P. Womack and Daniel Jones {{pointed out}} in [...] "Lean Thinking", what Ford {{accomplished}} represented the [...] "special case" [...] rather than a robust <b>lean</b> <b>solution.</b> The major challenge that Ford faced was that his methods were built for a steady-state environment, rather than for the dynamic conditions firms increasingly face today. Although his rigid, top-down controls {{made it possible to}} hold variation in work activities down to very low levels, his approach did not respond well to uncertain, dynamic business conditions; they responded particularly badly to the need for new product innovation. This was made clear by Ford's precipitous decline when the company was forced to finally introduce a follow-on to the Model T.|$|E
5000|$|Not to be {{confused}} with [...] "Lean Design &reg;" [...] (copyrighted and patented by Munro & Associates, of Michigan), design for lean manufacturing builds on the set of principles that emerged from design for the customer value and design for manufacturability. Since some lean tools are used in the practice of design for lean manufacturing, it borrows the first word in its name from lean manufacturing as exemplified by the Toyota Production System. [...] Design for lean manufacturing was first coined by Womack, Jones, and Roos after studying the differences between conventional development at American automotive companies and lean methods at Japanese automobile producers. While lean manufacturing focuses on optimization of the production stream and removal of wastes (commonly referred to as muda, mura, and muri) once the value stream has been created, Lean Design ® (Munro & Associates)concerns itself with methods and techniques to create a <b>lean</b> <b>solution</b> from the start, resulting in more value and fewer wastes across the value stream. [...] Lean design ® seeks to optimize the development process through rapid learning cycles to build and test multiple concepts early. [...] Managing the knowledge value stream, systematic problem solving with analysis of the trade-offs between various design options, and solutions generated from ideas filtered by systematic innovation methods are viewed as methods within the lean design process.|$|E
30|$|The {{contents}} of CO 2 and H 2 S {{in the wet}} purified gas decreased with the increasing circulation rate of the <b>lean</b> <b>solution.</b> However, the CO 2 absorption rate eventually dropped when the circulation rate of the <b>lean</b> <b>solution</b> was increased beyond 320  m 3 /h. This was because the reaction rate between CO 2 and MDEA decreased. To remove {{a large amount of}} CO 2, the retention time of the <b>lean</b> <b>solution</b> on the tray had to be maximized. Thus, increasing the circulation rate inevitably shortened the retention time of the <b>lean</b> <b>solution</b> on the tray, which slowed down the CO 2 absorption rate. In addition, the reboiler load increased with the increasing circulation rate. Based on the simulation results, the circulation rate of the <b>lean</b> <b>solution</b> was estimated to be 330  m 3 /h when the design margin of the apparatus was taken into account.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{translate}} the eight wastes of Lean for Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), identify some examples of each waste and to propose appropriate <b>Lean</b> <b>solutions</b> to those wastes. Design/methodology/approach – To identify wastes within HEIs a combination of observation and cause-and-effect analysis utilising brainstorming were employed using a convenience sample of HE academic staff. Findings – Once all eight wastes were successfully translated for HEIs a range of examples were identified in both academic and support services, including excessive movement of people, over production of materials, excessive inventory and waste of human resources. Appropriate <b>Lean</b> <b>solutions</b> to the identified wastes include the use of 5 S, point-of-use-storage, process mapping/value stream mapping and level scheduling. Research limitations/implications – The cited examples come from a limited number of observations in only a few HEIs. More valid and reliable data would come from a more extensive sample of HEIs. Practical implications – In order to improve bottom-line performance in times of constrained resources HEIs can reduce waste and hence costs of poor quality by using Lean thinking and accessing, what Joseph Juran (1962) called, “The gold in the mine”. This can be done without reducing the level of services. Social implications – Particularly in a recession, HEIs need to show that they are using government funding (public money) in the most efficient and effective way possible. Lean thinking can help achieve both these objectives. Originality/value – Previous papers on Lean thinking applied to HEIs have concentrated on individual processes such as curriculum design or student assessment. This paper takes a holistic view demonstrating how Lean thinking theories can be practically applied across both academic and administrative areas of HEI operations...|$|R

30|$|The results {{shown in}} Fig.  2 {{revealed}} that {{an increase in}} the input temperature of the <b>lean</b> <b>solution</b> caused a slight increase in the H 2 S content and a continuous decrease in the CO 2 content in the wet purified gas, as well as a decrease in the flow rate of the wet purified gas leaving the tower. Based on this trend, a decrease in the input temperature of the <b>lean</b> <b>solution</b> reduced the CO 2 content significantly while the H 2 S content remained almost constant. This result demonstrated that the input temperature of the <b>lean</b> <b>solution</b> primarily affected the absorption rate of CO 2, while the MDEA-DEA mixed-amines solution did not significantly affect the absorption rate of H 2 S when the operating temperature was lower than 47  °C.|$|E
30|$|The mixed-amines-rich {{solution}} (F 8) {{coming from}} the bottom of the flash drum passed through the filtration system to purge the degradation products and mechanical impurities that had been dissolved in the rich solution. After that, the mixed-amines-rich solution (F 9) entered the heat exchanger and was warmed by the <b>lean</b> <b>solution</b> (F 10) coming out {{from the bottom of}} the regenerator unit. Then, the rich solution (F 11) re-entered the regenerator unit from the top and had countercurrent contact with the up-flowing vapor, leading to further desorption of the H 2 S and CO 2 gases to achieve regeneration of the solution. A reboiler at the bottom of the tower provided the heat for regeneration. After passing through the heat exchanger, the warm mixed-amines <b>lean</b> <b>solution</b> (F 12) was removed {{from the bottom of the}} regenerator unit and cooled by the rich solution. It (F 12) then entered the air cooler and cooler to be further chilled.

30|$|Optimization and {{analysis}} of the primary operating parameters for the desulfurization and decarbonization processes were conducted to obtain the optimized values for the input temperature of the <b>lean</b> <b>solution</b> (42  °C), reflux ratio (0.8), number of trays in the absorber unit (17), and circulation rate of the <b>lean</b> <b>solution</b> (330  m 3 /h), etc. Additionally, the influence of the operating pressure of the regenerator unit on the regeneration system was also investigated. The energy consumption of the apparatus and the corrosion level of sour gas to the apparatus were reduced after optimization. Based on the investigation of the natural gas treatment for this gas field, it can serve as a reference for the purification of high carbon contents natural gas.|$|E

A cost saving effect can often be achieved as an outcome of concrete challenging targets for materials reduction {{in the context of}} future limited material availability and high price. It was also concluded that materials research needs to progress even further and stretch the limits of what can be achieved. It was concluded that the sector should aim for lean and light packaging materials, but also that all packaging materials have to be recoverable. These results are in line with the findings of earlier studies [34], whereby more recent studies [13] broaden the environmental dimension to stress sustainability aspects, including social and financial dimensions. Sustainability aspects are most often closely linked to the materials used. Material development requires a lot of resources and foresight input was considered essential to get decisions right in the light of long lead times and large investments.|$|R

The chemical reaction in the liquid phase is based on the bicarbonate ion formation from CO 2 as the rate-determining step. Gas solubility, mass and heat transfer coefficients, reaction kinetics and equilibrium were estimated using correlations from literatures. Therefore, multi-component absorption phenomena were considered in the mathematical model. The model was validated using plant data and was used to compute temperature and concentration profiles in the absorber.

30|$|It {{is known}} that feed gas {{contains}} high CO 2 content. Although the MDEA solution possesses a number of advantages, it has a slower reaction rate in the removal of CO 2. To overcome this problem, {{a certain amount of}} DEA (MEA) was mixed with the MDEA solution to improve the absorption rate of CO 2. As a result, the MDEA-DEA mixed-amines solution exhibited a faster absorption rate, higher CO 2 removal efficiency, and lower circulation rate of <b>lean</b> <b>solution</b> (Li and Zhao 2009; Wang and Wang 2003). After comparing the simulations of solutions with different ratios and the DEA method, a mixed-amines solution with a ratio of 43  %(w) MDEA +  12  %(w) DEA was chosen as the absorber for the desulfurization and decarbonization processes after purification efficiency, economic benefits, and recycling issues were taken into account.|$|E
40|$|The growing {{pressure}} in spaceflight {{to reduce costs}} together with technological progress results in a trend towards smaller, lighter satellites using commercial off-the-shelf parts where possible. However this process of using <b>lean</b> <b>solutions</b> in the space segment stops halfway {{if it is not}} balanced by corresponding smart and flexible concepts in the ground segment.

In many cases, the changes involve {{a reduction of}} the subsystems structure, dropping the number of territorial units or finding <b>leaner</b> <b>solutions</b> and outsourcing of activities which were once fulfilled {{within the boundaries of}} the party organization. Specifically, the phenomenon of outsourcing concerns, on the one hand, aggregation of interests and policymaking and, on the other, electoral mobilization and management of political communication. Looking for new solutions – flexible, without a unique centre – can lead to a process of de-differentiation that characterizes organization in postmodern society: a new definition of levels of hierarchy and "transgression of boundaries", through a continuous exchange of resources with the environment, which is unpredictable and constantly changing. As in other organizations, parties en-courage the formation of horizontal links with new external actors - associations, informal groups, indi-viduals and influencers - in order to build networks that cooperate to exchange essential resources for the party itself. In this framework, the study aims to interpret de-differentiation in political parties from a specific point of view: the analysis of political campaigns as indicators of this process. The “outside campaign”, created by a set of non-party actors, is growing: the sector of organized interests, that, unlike in the past, is "de-aligned" from the political parties and does not respond to traditional socio-political cleavage, is present in parties and candidates’ campaigns with greater resources than was the case formerly. <br /...|$|R
