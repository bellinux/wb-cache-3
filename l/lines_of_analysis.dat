5000|$|The {{theoretical}} {{analysis of}} parasitic gaps {{is not a}} settled matter by any means, since accounts of the phenomenon vary drastically. In very broad terms, there are two <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> that one can pursue. The first is to assume that parasitic gaps are extraction gaps (the extraction analysis); parasitic gaps arise {{by way of the}} same basic mechanism that licenses [...] "normal" [...] extraction gaps. This sort of approach must augment the analysis of extraction gaps in some way in order to accommodate parasitic gaps under the same theoretical umbrella. The alternative approach rejects the analysis that takes parasitic gaps to be extraction gaps. One assumes instead that parasitic gaps actually contain a covert element, this element having the status of definite proform. (the proform analysis). Some analyses mix and match these two basic <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis,</b> although in general, both are well represented in the literature on parasitism and most accounts can be placed in the one or the other camp.|$|E

50|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, the {{intellectual}} agendas of heterodox economists have taken a decidedly pluralist turn.

This cross-fertilization of ideas is creating {{a new generation of}} scholarship in which novel combinations of heterodox ideas are being brought to bear on important contemporary and historical problems, such as socially grounded reconstructions of the individual in economic theory; the goals and tools of economic measurement and professional ethics; the complexities of policymaking in today's global political economy; and innovative connections among formerly separate theoretical traditions (Marxian, Austrian, feminist, ecological, Sraffian, institutionalist, and post-Keynesian) (for a review of post-Keynesian economics, see Lavoie (1992); Rochon (1999)).|$|E
50|$|Sally Eden’s {{research}} and writing focuses on important and significant questions about how society understands and manages the environment, including issues of sustainable consumption, green lifestyles, environmental action and forms of public engagement with the environment.

In her writing she has developed carefully critical <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> and argument drawing on concepts from human geography but also science and technology studies and environmental politics. Much of her work has been drawn together in the book ‘Environmental Publics’ (Routledge 2017) which from the starting point that ‘the public’ is not one thing and their engagements with the environment take multiple forms, provides a fascinating account of how environmental publics know, participate, consume, enjoy, campaign, vote and work.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} {{sustainability}} accounting {{has emerged from}} developments in accounting, with roots, in a broader sense {{over a period of}} the past forty years, and in the narrow sense, over the past ten years. The development reveals two distinct <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis.</b> The first line is the philosophical debate about accountability, if and how it contributes to sustainable development, and which are the necessary steps towards sustainability. This approach is based on an entirely new system of accounting designed to promote a strategy of sustainability. The second line is the management perspective associated with varied terms and tools towards sustainability. This could be seen as an extension of or modification to conventional financial cost or management accounting. The former may be more appealing: To develop sustainability accounting de novo allows a complete reappraisal of the relative significance of social, environmental and economic benefits and risks and their interactions in corporate accounting systems.The development which leads to sustainable accounting could be distinguished in several time periods in which a number of trends were evident: 1971-1980, 1981-1990, 1991-1995 and up to the present. These periods distinguish in volume of empirical studies, normative statements, philosophical discussion, teaching programmes, literature and regulatory frameworks.|$|E

5000|$|HYPO’s {{method of}} {{creating}} an argument and justifying a solution or position has several steps. HYPO begins its processing with the current fact situation ("cfs") which is direct input by the user into HYPO’s representation framework. Once the user inputs the case, HYPO begins its legal analysis. The cfc is analyzed for relevant factors. Based on these factors HYPO selects the relevant cases and produces a case-analysis-record that records which dimensions apply to the cfc and which nearly apply (i.e. are [...] "near misses"). The combined list of applicable and near miss dimensions is called the D-list. At this point the fact gathered module may request additional information from the user in order to draw a legal conclusion. Once all the facts are in the case-positioner module it uses the case-analysis record to create the claim [...] This is a technique that organizes the relevant retrieved cases {{from the point of}} view of the cfc and makes it easy for HYPO to ascertain the most-on point cases (mopc) and to least on-point-cases. HYPO’s arguments are 3ply, leading to the construction of the skeleton of an argument: it makes a point for one side, drawing the analogy between the problem and the precedent, responds with an argument for the opponent side, endeavoring to differentiate the cited case and citing other cases as counterarguments. Then it makes a final rebuttal, attempting to differentiate the counterarguments. The claim lattice also enables the HYPO-generator module to produce legally hypotheticals. With its use of dimension-based heuristics, the HYPO-generator does a heuristic search of the space of all possible cases. Lastly, the Explanation module expands upon the argument skeleton and provides explanation and justification for the different <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> and cases found by HYPO.|$|E
