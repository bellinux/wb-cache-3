Although there are numerous flammability literature data available for pure substances, for fuel mixtures these are not always available. Especially, for fuel mixture storage, operation, and transportation, inert gas inerting and blanketing have been widely applied in chemical process industries while the related date are even more scarce. <b>Lower</b> and upper <b>flammability</b> limits of hydrocarbon mixtures in air with and without additional nitrogen were measured in this research. Typically, the fuel mixture <b>lower</b> <b>flammability</b> limit almost keeps constant at different contents of added nitrogen. The fuel mixture upper flammability limit approximately linearly varies with the added nitrogen except mixtures containing ethylene. The minimum added nitrogen concentration at which <b>lower</b> <b>flammability</b> limit and upper flammability limit merge together is the minimum inerting concentration for nitrogen, roughly falling into the range of 45 plus/minus 10 vol % for all the tested hydrocarbon mixtures. Numerical analysis of inert gas dilution effect on <b>lower</b> <b>flammability</b> limit and upper flammability limit was conducted by introducing the parameter of inert gas dilution coefficient. Fuel mixture flammability limit can be quantitatively characterized using inert gas dilution coefficient plus the original Le Chatelier's law or modified Le Chatelier's law. An extended application of calculated adiabatic flame temperature modeling was proposed to predict fuel mixture flammability limits at different inert gas loading. The modeling <b>lower</b> <b>flammability</b> limit results can represent experimental data well except the flammability nose zone close to minimum inerting concentration. Le Chatelier's law is a well-recognized mixing rule for fuel mixture flammability limit estimation.

40|$|Flammable gases such as hydrogen, ammonia, and methane are {{observed}} in the tank dome space of the Hanford Site high-level waste tanks. This report assesses the steady-state <b>flammability</b> <b>level</b> under normal and off-normal ventilation conditions in the tank dome space for 177 double-shell tanks and single-shell tanks at the Hanford Site. The steady-state <b>flammability</b> <b>level</b> was estimated from the gas concentration of the mixture in the dome space using estimated gas release rates, Le Chatelier's rule and <b>lower</b> <b>flammability</b> limits of fuels in an air mixture. A time-dependent equation of gas concentration, which {{is a function of}} the gas release and ventilation rates in the dome space, has been developed for both soluble and insoluble gases. With this dynamic model, the time required to reach the specified <b>flammability</b> <b>level</b> at a given ventilation condition can be calculated. In the evaluation, hydrogen generation rates can be calculated for a given tank waste composition and its physical condition (e. g., waste density, waste volume, temperature, etc.) using the empirical rate equation model provided in Empirical Rate Equation Model and Rate Calculations of Hydrogen Generation for Hanford Tank Waste, HNF- 3851. The release rate of other insoluble gases and the mass transport properties of the soluble gas can be derived from the observed steady-state gas concentration under normal ventilation conditions. The off-normal ventilation rate is assumed to be natural barometric breathing only. A large body of data is required to do both the hydrogen generation rate calculation and the <b>flammability</b> <b>level</b> evaluation. For tank waste that does not have sample-based data, a statistical-based value from probability distribution regression was used based on data from tanks belonging to a similar waste group. This report (Revision 3) updates the input data of hydrogen generation rates calculation for 177 tanks using the waste composition information in the Best-Basis Inventory Detail Report in the Tank Waste Information Network System, and the waste temperature data in the Surveillance Analysis Computer System (SACS) (dated July 2003). However, the release rate of methane, ammonia, and nitrous oxide is based on the input data (dated October 1999) as stated in Revision 0 of this report. Scenarios for adding waste to existing waste levels (dated July 2003) have been studied to determine the gas generation rates and the effect of smaller dome space on the flammability limits to address the issues of routine water additions and other possible waste transfer operations. In the flammability evaluation with zero ventilation, the sensitivity to waste temperature and to water addition was calculated for double-shell tanks 241 -AY- 102, 241 -AN- 102, 241 -AZ- 101, 241 -AN- 107, 241 -AY- 101 and 241 -AZ- 101.

The control strategy exploits the highly nonlinear relationship between equivalence ratio and reaction rate at lean operating conditions to dampen the instabilities via high-speed injection of supplemental fuel. Timing of the control perturbations is determined by monitoring the combustor pressure for characteristic mediating trajectories which lead to misfire. The nonlinear nature of the system allows combustion stabilization to be achieved with relatively small injections of supplemental fuel.

A certain amount of flammability limit data for pure hydrocarbons {{are available in the}} literature, but for industrial applications, there are conditions including different combinations of fuels at standard and non-standard conditions, in which the flammability limit data are scarce and sometimes unavailable. This research is two-fold: (i) Performing experimental measurements to estimate the <b>lower</b> <b>flammability</b> limits and upper flammability limits of binary hydrocarbon mixtures, conducting experimental data numerical analysis to quantitatively characterize the flammability limits of these mixtures with parameters, such as component compositions, flammability properties of pure hydrocarbons, and thermo-kinetic values; (ii) Estimating flammability limits of binary hydrocarbon mixtures through CFT-V modeling prediction (calculated flame temperature at constant volume), which is based on a comprehensive consideration of energy conservation. For the experimental part, thermal detection was used in this experiment. The experimental results indicate that the experimental results fit Le Chatelier?s Law within experimental uncertainty at the <b>lower</b> <b>flammability</b> limit condition. At the upper flammability limit condition, Le Chatelier?s Law roughly fits the saturated hydrocarbon mixture data, while with mixtures that contain one or more unsaturated components, a modification of Le Chatelier?s is preferred to fit the experimental data. The easy and efficient way to modify Le Chatelier?s Law is to power the molar percentage concentrations of hydrocarbon components. For modeling prediction part, the CFT-V modeling is an extended modification of CAFT modeling at constant volume and is significantly related to the reaction vessel configuration. This modeling prediction is consistent with experimental observation and Le Chatelier?s Law at the concentrations of <b>lower</b> <b>flammability</b> limits.

40|$|Alternative {{aviation}} fuels {{are being}} developed recently to partially replace the limited resources of traditional liquid fuels in the aviation industry. The fire-safety properties of these fuels, however, are unknown. Especially, the flammability limit of a fuel is a crucial parameter. The present work focuses on measurements of concentration and temperature flammability limits of four pure hydrocarbon fuels, as well as traditional and alternative aviation fuels, including Jet-A, HEFA, SIP, and FT-S 8. The lower and upper concentration flammability limits of these selected fuels were determined under specific temperatures and pressures. An experiment including a customized power supply system to generate sufficient spark energy for ignition near the flammability limits was built to measure the lower and upper limits. The temperature flammability limits were also measured using a different experimental apparatus for the four selected aviation fuels. As the initial temperature increases, the <b>lower</b> concentration <b>flammability</b> limit decreases. In terms of the fuel-air mass ratio, the limit is {{within the range of}} 0. 032 - 0. 04 for all four aviation fuels. The upper flammability limit increases with temperature within a range of 0. 21 - 0. 23 except for SIP. Unlike temperature, pressure has minor influence on the <b>lower</b> concentration <b>flammability</b> limit for all fuels. Among the four aviation fuels, Jet-A and HEFA have similar results, and FT-S 8 is considered to be least sensitive with temperature variation. Three correlations and models were used to predict the <b>lower</b> concentration <b>flammability</b> limits of the four pure fuels. The predictions were compared to the measurements. As for temperature flammability limits, SIP has the highest <b>lower</b> temperature <b>flammability</b> limit.

40|$|This {{document}} {{serves as}} a notice of construction (NOC) {{for the use of}} a portable exhauster on 241 -A- 101 single-shell tank (SST) during salt well pumping and other routine activities at the tank. Approval for salt well pumping is not being requested as this is a routine activity performed to manage the waste within the SST Tank System. The primary objective of providing active ventilation to the 241 -A- 101 tank is to satisfy the requirements of a Los Alamos National Laboratories (LANL) Safety Analysis Report (SAR) that requires postulated accidents to remain within risk guidelines. It is anticipated that salt well pumping will release gases entrapped within the waste as the liquid level is lowered, because of less hydrostatic force keeping the gases in place. Other routine activities also have the potential to release trapped gases by interrupting gas pockets within the waste. Hanford Site waste tanks must comply with the National Fire Protection Association guidelines, which mandate that flammable gas concentration be less than 25 percent of the <b>lower</b> <b>flammability</b> limits.
