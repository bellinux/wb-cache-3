25|$|The precise set {{of primary}} colors {{to be used}} in a {{specific}} color application depends on gamut requirements as well as on application-specific constraints such as cost, power consumption, <b>lightfastness,</b> mixing behavior, etc.|$|E
25|$|Selection of a pigment for a {{particular}} application is determined by cost, and by the physical properties and attributes of the pigment itself. For example, a pigment {{that is used to}} color glass must have very high heat stability in order to survive the manufacturing process; but, suspended in the glass vehicle, its resistance to alkali or acidic materials is not an issue. In artistic paint, heat stability is less important, while <b>lightfastness</b> and toxicity are greater concerns.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{hundreds}} of commercially available pigments for visual artists to use and mix (in various media such as oil, watercolor, acrylic, and pastel). [...] A common approach is to use just a limited palette of primary pigments (often between four and eight) that can be physically mixed to any color that the artist desires in the final work. [...] There are no specific set of pigments that are primary colors, the choice of pigment depends entirely on the artist's subjective preference of subject and style of art as well as material considerations like <b>lightfastness</b> and mixing heuristics. [...] Contemporary classical realists have often advocated that a limited palette of white, red, yellow, and black pigment (often described as the [...] "Zorn palette") is sufficient for compelling work.|$|E
50|$|The most {{well known}} scales {{measuring}} the <b>lightfastness</b> are the Blue Wool Scale, Grey {{scale and the}} scale defined by ASTM (American Standard Test Measure). On the Blue Wool Scale the <b>lightfastness</b> is rated between 1-8. 1 being very poor and 8 being excellent <b>lightfastness.</b> In grey scale the <b>lightfastness</b> is rated between 1-5. 1 being very poor and 5 being excellent <b>lightfastness.</b> On ASTM scale the <b>lightfastness</b> is rated between I-V. I is excellent <b>lightfastness</b> and it corresponds to ratings 7-8 on Blue Wool Scale. V is very poor <b>lightfastness</b> and it corresponds to Blue Wool scale rating 1.|$|E
50|$|When {{mixing the}} {{printing}} inks the <b>lightfastness</b> of the ink being weaker by its <b>lightfastness</b> defines the <b>lightfastness</b> {{of the whole}} color. The fading {{of one of the}} pigments leads to tone shift towards to component with better <b>lightfastness.</b> If it is required that there will be something visible from the printing even though its dominant pigment would fade, small amount of pigment with excellent <b>lightfastness</b> can be mixed with it.|$|E
50|$|The actual <b>lightfastness</b> is {{dependent}} on the strength of the radiation of the sun, so <b>lightfastness</b> is relative to geographic location, season, and exposure direction. The following table is listing suggestive relations of the <b>lightfastness</b> ratings on different measure scales and the relation relative to time in direct sunlight and normal conditions of display: away from a window, under indirect sunlight and properly framed behind a UV protective glass.|$|E

50|$|In {{the screen}} {{printing}} the particle {{size of the}} pigment is not limiting factor. Thus it is preferred printing method for printing print jobs requiring extreme <b>lightfastness.</b> Thickness of the ink layer effects to the <b>lightfastness</b> bt the amount of pigment laid on the substrate. Ink layer printed by the screen printing is thicker than layer printed on offset printing. In other words, it contains more pigment per area. This leads to better <b>lightfastness</b> even though the used printing ink in both methods {{would be based on}} the same pigment.|$|E

50|$|Azo {{pigments}} {{consist of}} colorless particles (typically earths or clays) colored using an azo compound. Azo pigments {{are important in}} a variety of paints including artist's paints. They have excellent coloring properties, again mainly in the yellow to red range, as well as good <b>lightfastness.</b> The <b>lightfastness</b> depends not only on the properties of the organic azo compound, but also on the way they have been absorbed on the pigment carrier.|$|E
50|$|Earth {{pigments}} {{are known}} for their fast drying time in oil painting, relative inexpensiveness, and <b>lightfastness.</b> Cave paintings done in sienna still survive today.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lightfastness</b> is {{measured}} by exposing a sample to a lightsource for a predefined {{period of time and}} then comparing it to an unexposed sample.|$|E
50|$|Many of {{the same}} {{companies}} that produce artist-grade colored pencils also offer student-grade materials and scholastic-level colored pencils. <b>Lightfastness</b> rating is usually not included in student- and scholastic-grade colored pencils. Core composition and pigment-binder ratio vary among artist- and student-grade colored pencils even when the same company produces them. As they are intended for different users, student- and scholastic-grade colored pencils lack the high quality pigments and <b>lightfastness</b> standards that hold artist-grade products true to their name. Also their color range is smaller, most often limited to 24 or 36 colors.|$|E
50|$|Mars Black is an {{iron oxide}} pigment {{developed}} in the 20th century. Also known under the names of black iron oxide, magnetic oxide, Pigment Black 11, and ferrous ferric oxide (Fe3O4), it has no known health hazards and is considered non-toxic, with an ASTM <b>lightfastness</b> rating of I. It is more opaque and less toxic than other black pigments. Artists' paint manufacturers have rated {{it one of the}} most satisfactory black pigments for acrylic paints with regard to opacity, <b>lightfastness,</b> and permanence. It takes its name from Mars, the god of war and patron of iron.|$|E
50|$|Synthetic {{pigments}} {{are also}} now available. Natural pigments {{have the advantage}} of being well understood through centuries of use, but synthetics have greatly increased the spectrum of available colors, and many are tested well for their <b>lightfastness.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Blue Wool Scale {{measures}} and calibrates {{the permanence of}} colouring dyes. Traditionally this test was developed for the textiles industry but {{it has now been}} adopted by the printing industry as measure of <b>lightfastness</b> of ink colourants.|$|E
50|$|The unripe {{buckthorn}} berries are also called Rhamni Immaturi. The color it produces is dark brown in its dense form, {{and turns to}} a bright yellow in a thin layer. It has a low <b>lightfastness</b> rating of about 4.|$|E
50|$|After {{considerable}} research, {{scientists and}} engineers have identified dyes have proven suitable for use for liquid crystal displays(2). The dyes need adequate <b>lightfastness,</b> suitable wavelength bands, and sufficient order parameter in a liquid crystal host to function as display ingredients.|$|E
50|$|Phenoxazine dyes {{were once}} widely used for silk dyeing, {{but due to}} their lack of <b>lightfastness</b> they have {{disappeared}} over time from the market. However, since their light resistance is significantly better on acrylic fibers, these dyes have experienced a renaissance.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lightfastness</b> is a {{property}} of a colourant such as dye or pigment that describes how resistant to fading {{it is when}} exposed to light. Dyes and pigments are used for example for dyeing of fabrics, plastics or other materials and manufacturing paints or printing inks.|$|E
50|$|A {{relatively}} recent development in taxidermy restoration, {{metal complex dyes}} {{have been used to}} recolor fur. The American Museum of Natural History performed extensive research and tests using these dyes to recolor the furs of taxidermy specimens during the restoration of the Hall of North American Mammals. Many of the dyes have a high <b>lightfastness</b> and are more resistant to fading. When applied to fur, they also allow for a more natural look and feel. Another major benefit to using dyes, as opposed to acrylic paints, to recolor fur is they are reversible. The dyes can be reduced or entirely removed with application of ethanol. Research is still being done into the dyes’ <b>lightfastness</b> and fixability, as well as whether or not they cause the fur to degrade over time.|$|E
50|$|Since World War II, {{the company}} {{concentrated}} on the development and production of high quality art pencils. In recent years, high <b>lightfastness</b> has become an issue of increasing importance to artists, and Cretacolor {{has been one of}} the first manufacturers launching ranges of lightfast color pencils with its AquaStick and Marino lines.|$|E
50|$|Some {{organizations}} publish {{standards for}} rating the <b>lightfastness</b> of pigments and materials. Testing is typically done by controlled exposure to sunlight, or to artificial light {{generated by a}} xenon arc lamp. Watercolors, inks, pastels, and colored pencils are particularly susceptible to fading over time, so choosing lightfast pigments is especially important in these media.|$|E
50|$|The cadmium {{pigments}} {{have been}} partially replaced by azo pigments. These have significantly inferior <b>lightfastness,</b> but still good, {{and they have}} the advantage of both being cheaper and non-toxic. In some countries, consumer activists such as Michael Vernon in Australia were successful in banning the use of cadmium pigments in plastics {{that could be used for}} toy manufacture, owing to the toxicity of cadmium.|$|E
50|$|Artist-grade pencils {{are filled}} with higher {{concentrations}} of high-quality pigments than student-grade colored pencils. Their <b>lightfastness</b> - resistance to UV rays in sunlight - is also measured and documented. Core durability, break and water resistance, and brand popularity are also notable features of artist-grade colored pencils. Artist-grade pencils have the largest color ranges; 72 color sets are very common {{and there are several}} brands of 120 colors or more. They are also typically available as individual pencils.|$|E
50|$|Selection of a pigment for a {{particular}} application is determined by cost, and by the physical properties and attributes of the pigment itself.

In artistic paint, heat stability is less important, while <b>lightfastness</b> and toxicity are greater concerns.|$|E
5000|$|Colored pencils {{vary greatly}} {{in terms of}} quality and usability; {{concentration}} of pigments in the core, <b>lightfastness</b> of the pigments, durability of the colored pencil, and softness of the lead are some indicators of a brand’s quality and, consequently, its market price. There is no general quality difference between wax/oil-based and water-soluble colored pencils, although some manufacturers rate their water-soluble pencils as less lightfast than their similar wax/oil-based pencils.Rising popularity of colored pencils as an art medium sparked {{the beginning of the}} Colored Pencil Society of America (CPSA). According to its website, “CPSA was founded in 1990 as a nonprofit organization dedicated to artists over 18 years of age working with colored pencil”. The CPSA not only promotes colored pencil art as fine art, but also strives to set <b>lightfastness</b> standards for colored pencil manufacturers. Other countries such as United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia and Mexico - among many others - have formed their own organizations and societies for colored pencil artists. In Canada, colored pencils are known as pencil crayons, or, regionally in Newfoundland [...] "leads" [...] or [...] "coloured/colouring leads." [...] Colored pencils are commonly stored in pencil cases to prevent damage.|$|E
5000|$|The vivid green {{color of}} copper(II) acetate made {{this form of}} {{verdigris}} a much used pigment. Until the 19th century, verdigris was the most vibrant green pigment available and was frequently used in painting. Verdigris is lightfast in oil paint, as numerous examples of 15th-century paintings show. However, its <b>lightfastness</b> and air resistance are very low in other media. Copper resinate, made from verdigris by boiling it in a resin, is not lightfast, even in oil paint. In the presence of light and air, green copper resinate becomes stable brown copper oxide.|$|E
50|$|Relative {{amount of}} fading can be {{measured}} and studied by using standard test stripes. In the workflow of Blue Wool test one reference stripe set shall be stored protected from any exposure of light. Simultaneously with samples another equivalent test stripe set is exposed under the light source defined in the standard. For example, if the <b>lightfastness</b> of the colourant is indicated to be 5 on Blue Wool scale, it {{can be expected to}} fade similar amount as the strip number 5 in Blue Wool test strip set. The accompisment of the test can be confirmed by comparing the test stripe set with the reference set stored protected from the light.|$|E

5000|$|Acrylic is lightweight, soft, and warm, with a wool-like feel. It {{can also}} be made to mimic other fibers, such as cotton when spun on short staple equipment. Some acrylic is {{extruded}} in colored or pigmented form; other is extruded in [...] "ecru", otherwise known as [...] "natural," [...] "raw white," [...] or [...] "undyed." [...] Pigmented fiber has the highest <b>lightfastness.</b> Its fibers are very resilient compared to both other synthetics and natural fibers. Some acrylic is used in clothing as a less expensive alternative to cashmere, due to the similar feeling of the materials. Some acrylic fabrics may fuzz or pill easily, though there are low-pilling variants. Acrylic takes color well, is washable, and is generally hypoallergenic. End-uses include socks, hats, gloves, scarves, sweaters, home furnishing fabrics, and awnings. Acrylic {{can also be}} used to make fake fur and to make many different knitted clothes.|$|E
5000|$|A set {{of primary}} colors is an {{arbitrary}} set of pigmented physical media, lights or purely abstract {{elements of a}} mathematical colorspace model. Distinct colors from a larger gamut can be specified {{in terms of a}} mixture of primary colors which facilitates technological applications such as painting, electronic displays and printing. Any small set of pigments or lights are [...] "imperfect" [...] physical primary colors in that they cannot be mixed to yield all possible colors that can be perceived by the human color vision system. The abstract (or [...] "imaginary") primaries X, Y and Z of the CIEXYZ colorspace can be mathematically summed to specify essentially all colors that can be perceived but these primaries cannot be physically realized due to the underlying structure and overlapping spectral sensitivities of each of the human cone photoreceptors. [...] The precise set of primary colors that are used in a specific color application depend on gamut requirements as well as application-specific constraints such as cost, power consumption, <b>lightfastness,</b> mixing behavior etc.|$|E
30|$|The vibrancy of the {{contrasting}} {{colors in the}} Haku Maki prints {{and the potential for}} lengthy or repeated exhibition raised concerns over the stability of the inks to light. Chrome based pigments are known to darken upon exposure to light, and the <b>lightfastness</b> of aniline black is variously reported as either good or questionable. Herbst and Hunger’s authoritative industrial textbook describes the <b>lightfastness</b> of aniline black as good in the masstone, but weaker when admixed with titanium white [12]. However, several artists’ websites and watercolor manuals list the pigment in commercial paints as being of only moderate <b>lightfastness</b> or fugitive unless mixed with carbon black [19, 20]. Molybdate orange in particular is considered to have only modest <b>lightfastness</b> [18 – 20].|$|E
