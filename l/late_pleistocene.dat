From fossils, the Floridan Gymnogyps kofordi from the Early Pleistocene and the Peruvian Gymnogyps howardae from the <b>Late</b> <b>Pleistocene</b> have been described. A condor found in <b>Late</b> <b>Pleistocene</b> deposits on Cuba was initially described as Antillovultur varonai, but has since been recognized as another member of Gymnogyps, Gymnogyps varonai. It may even have derived from a founder population of California condors.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea that}} Ciomadul {{could be a}} still active volcano was first {{proposed}} in 1780 {{on the basis of}} its young appearance and the release of gas.

5|$|Differences in songs, {{genetics}} and morphology {{suggests that the}} Azores were colonised in a single invasion in the <b>late</b> <b>Pleistocene,</b> about 100,000 years ago. It {{is likely that the}} initial colonisation was of the easternmost islands, with a subsequent spread to the central and western island groups from the western caldera of São Miguel, where both eastern and western song types are found.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>Late</b> <b>Pleistocene,</b> {{the more}} southerly {{occurring}} dire wolf (Canis dirus) {{had the same}} shape and proportions as the Yukon wolf, but the dire wolf subspecies C.dirusguildayi is estimated to have weighed on average , and the subspecies C.dirusdirus on average , with some specimens being larger. The dire wolf was heavier than the Beringian wolf and possessed a more robust skull and dentition.|$|E
40|$|The Mirador cave {{is located}} in the Sierra de Atapuerca (Ibeas de Juarros, Burgos, Spain).

In this paper we have studied the <b>latest</b> <b>Pleistocene</b> levels, MIR 50 and MIR 51. The palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatical data obtained with the small mammal assemblage show that the level MIR 51 may be probably related with a cool moment {{from the end of the}} <b>latest</b> <b>Pleistocene.</b> Taking into account, the absolute dating for this level, this moment could be corresponds to the Heinrich Event 1 (H 1). This event, dated between 14, 000 to 16, 000 years BP, is globally characterized for being a generally cold moment, as detected at the level MIR 51, but with small peaks of climatic amelioration, as it is detected in the level MIR 50...|$|R

5|$|The Burns–Hines {{region has}} a high-desert climate but was much wetter {{in the recent}} {{geologic}} past.

5|$|A {{study of}} isotope data of La Brea dire wolf fossils dated 10,000YBP {{provides}} {{evidence that the}} horse was an important prey species at the time, and that sloth, mastodon, bison, and camel were less common in the dire wolf diet. This indicates that the dire wolf was not a prey specialist, and {{at the close of}} the <b>late</b> <b>Pleistocene</b> before its extinction it was hunting or scavenging the most available herbivores.|$|E

5|$|Analysis of {{mitochondrial}} DNA, from {{a limited}} number of specimens, suggested that there was gene flow within the continental Asian populations until the 20th century reductions in range, and that Australia was colonized only in the <b>Late</b> <b>Pleistocene,</b> some 35,000 years ago. This has been corroborated by nDNA microsatellite analyses with four times the sample size. This study further suggests that the Australian population is quite inbred. As there exists the possibility of (limited) hybridization with the genetically distinct brolga, the Australian sarus crane can be expected to be an incipient species.|$|E
5|$|By about 15,000 years ago, Equus ferus was a {{widespread}} holarctic species. Horse bones {{from this time}} period, the <b>late</b> <b>Pleistocene,</b> are found in Europe, Eurasia, Beringia, and North America. Yet between 10,000 and 7,600 years ago, the horse became extinct in North America and rare elsewhere. The reasons for this extinction are not fully known, but one theory notes that extinction in North America paralleled human arrival. Another theory points to climate change, noting that approximately 12,500 years ago, the grasses characteristic of a steppe ecosystem gave way to shrub tundra, which was covered with unpalatable plants.|$|E
5|$|Extinct North American cats {{resembling}} the cheetah had historically {{been assigned to}} Felis, Puma or Acinonyx. However, a phylogenetic analysis in 1990 placed these species under the genus Miracinonyx. Miracinonyx exhibited {{a high degree of}} similarity with the cheetah. However, in 1998, a DNA analysis showed that Miracinonyx inexpectatus, M.studeri, and M.trumani (early to <b>late</b> <b>Pleistocene</b> epoch), found in North America, are not true cheetahs; in fact, they are close relatives of the cougar.|$|E

5|$|Hamersley's soil is an {{infertile}} yellow-brown sand {{composed of}} fine to coarse quartz grains, with Tamala Limestone beneath. Locally known as Karrakatta Sand, {{it is almost}} certainly the leached remnants of coastal sand deposited by eolian processes in the <b>late</b> <b>Pleistocene</b> period, between 11,000 and 100,000 years ago. Below the sand are Paleozoic rocks of the Perth Basin. The sand contains an unconfined aquifer with large supplies of low-salinity potable groundwater which is recharged by rainfall.|$|E
5|$|Mallards {{frequently}} interbreed {{with their}} closest {{relatives in the}} genus Anas, such as the American black duck, and also with species more distantly related, such as the northern pintail, leading to various hybrids that may be fully fertile. This is quite unusual among such different species, and is apparently because the mallard evolved very rapidly and recently, during the <b>Late</b> <b>Pleistocene.</b> The distinct lineages of this radiation are usually kept separate due to non-overlapping ranges and behavioural cues, but have not yet {{reached the point where}} they are fully genetically incompatible. Mallards and their domesticated conspecifics are also fully inter-fertile.|$|E
5|$|Some early writers {{theorized that}} the last saber-toothed cats, Smilodon and Homotherium, became extinct through {{competition}} with the faster and more generalized felids that replaced them. It was even proposed that the saber-toothed predators were inferior to modern cats, as the ever-growing canines were thought to inhibit their owners from feeding properly. Yet fast felids such as the American lion and the American cheetah also became extinct during the <b>Late</b> <b>Pleistocene.</b> The fact that saber-teeth evolved many times in unrelated lineages also attests {{to the success of}} this feature.|$|E

5|$|Starting about 3million {{years ago}} and {{continuing}} {{at least through the}} <b>late</b> <b>Pleistocene,</b> extensional faulting of the Earth's crust led to eruption of small volcanoes in the Boring volcanic field. This field extended roughly from Portland and Tualatin on the west to Battle Ground, Washington, on the north to Sandy and Boring on the east. Two of these volcanoes, Mount Sylvania and Cook's Butte, are in the Tryon Creek watershed. The Mount Sylvania eruptions included ash plumes and lava flows that covered some of the Waverly Heights Formation and Columbia River basalts.|$|E
5|$|The {{district}} of Faisalabad {{is part of}} the alluvial plains between the Himalayan foothills and the central core of the Indian subcontinent. The alluvial deposits are typically over a thousand feet thick. The interfluves are believed to have been formed during the <b>Late</b> <b>Pleistocene</b> and feature river terraces. These were later identified as old and young floodplains of the Ravi River on the Kamalia and Chenab Plains. The old floodplains consist of Holocene deposits from the Ravi and Chenab rivers.|$|E
5|$|The koala's {{geographic}} range covers roughly , and 30 ecoregions. It extends throughout eastern and southeastern Australia, encompassing northeastern, central and southeastern Queensland, eastern New South Wales, Victoria, and southeastern South Australia. The koala was introduced near Adelaide and on several islands, including Kangaroo Island and French Island. The population on Magnetic Island represents the northern limit of its range. Fossil {{evidence shows that}} the koala's range stretched as far west as southwestern Western Australia during the <b>late</b> <b>Pleistocene.</b> They were likely driven to extinction in these areas by environmental changes and hunting by indigenous Australians.|$|E
