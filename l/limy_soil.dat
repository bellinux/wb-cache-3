25|$|The {{maritime}} pine (Pinus pinaster) is found at an intermediate altitude and on generally siliceous soil, which in Galicia {{goes down to}} sea level and inland alternates with Pyrenean oak. Over limestone, the black pine (Pinus nigra subsp salzmannii) {{plays an important role}} in many of the mountain ranges in the centre, east and south of the Peninsula; in <b>limy</b> <b>soil,</b> and at the same altitude, it usually displaces the former. Both are displaced at higher altitudes by the Scots pine.|$|E
50|$|A Minoan seal-stone {{from the}} site {{representing}} a ship {{is a reminder that}} the harbour was essential. The Minoan community supported itself by fishing and subsistence agriculture. They deeply tilled and terraced agricultural sites where they manured the thin <b>limy</b> <b>soil</b> with human waste from the settlement. They did not enclose their planting sites, as the island's much later Byzantine practice was, a sign that goats did not roam free in Minoan Pseira; neither were pigs kept. Dams collected seasonal run-off, for water was scarce on the island, though the Aegean region was less dry in the second millennium BC than now.|$|E
50|$|Monarda fistulosa is an {{herbaceous}} perennial {{that grows}} from slender creeping rhizomes, thus commonly occurring in large clumps. The plants are typically up to 3 ft (0.9 m) tall, {{with a few}} erect branches. Its leaves are about 2-3 in (5-8 cm) long, lance-shaped, and toothed. Its compact flower clusters are solitary {{at the ends of}} branches. Each cluster is about 1.5 in (4 cm) long, containing about 20 - 50 flowers. Wild bergamot often grows in rich soils in dry fields, thickets, and clearings, usually on <b>limy</b> <b>soil.</b> The plants generally flower from June to September.|$|E
50|$|It {{prefers to}} grow in well drained, sandy, or rocky, and <b>limy</b> <b>soils.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{closely related}} Gentiana clusii, often {{called by the}} same common name as this species, differs by growing on <b>limy</b> <b>soils.</b> It also has shorter leaves and the flowers have no olive-green stripes.|$|R
25|$|The warmest of all {{the pine}} forests are those of Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis), which are {{situated}} on rocky crests and sunny hillsides. Aleppo pine is the typical pine of the Mediterranean coast, from sea level to an altitude of 800–1000 metres in the interior; these prefer <b>limy</b> <b>soils.</b>|$|R
40|$|Road and {{railroad}} verges {{may contribute to}} nature conservation by providing habitat for many species, but due to limited resources, {{there is a need}} to select the most important road {{and railroad}} stretches for adapted management. We explore the responsibility species concept as a tool for the Swedish Transport Administration to make this selection. We propose lists of candidate responsibility species based on relative abundance of conservation priority species in the vicinity of roads and railroads, respectively. Abundance data were derived from crowd-sourced species observations. Species with ≥ 20 % of observations in infrastructure habitats were included as candidate responsibility species. For roads 32 species were included in the list, for railroads seven species, with an overlap of three species between the lists. We analyzed habitat and management requirements of the listed species to try identifying functional groups. Most of the species require open or semi-open habitats, mainly dry grassland or heathland on sandy or <b>limy</b> <b>soil,</b> un-sprayed crop fields, or solitary trees. Host plants or substrates include broom (genus Genista), patches of bare soil, and sun exposed wood. Conservation actions prescribed for the species include, e. g., late or irregular mowing, removal of the field layer, planting of host species, protecting and providing particular substrates, and special protection of certain sites. We argue that road and railroad managers are particularly well suited to conduct most of these actions. We consider the responsibility species concept to be a useful tool for transportation agencies to set priorities for adapted verge management, and the current method to be effective in identifying a first list of candidate species. We discuss the possibility of also identifying responsibility habitats or general management measures based on the results...|$|E
50|$|With {{the drying}} of Australia, the laurel forests habitat {{gradually}} retreated, and laurel forests {{were replaced by}} the more drought-tolerant sclerophyll plant communities familiar today. Corynocarpus rupestris grows well in <b>limy</b> <b>soils</b> where there is shelter due to its late flowering. Growth as a multi-stemmed shrub rather than a tree is an adaptation to this new habitat. Corynocarpus rupestris subsp. rupestris is naturally adapted to dry summers, although it also grows well in cool, wet summers. Corynocarpus rupestris is a typical representative of the laurel forest ecoregion.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{most of the}} Ericaceae, A. unedo grows well {{in basic}} (<b>limy)</b> pH <b>soils.</b> In cold climates it prefers a {{sheltered}} position due to its late flowering habit.|$|R
50|$|Teucrium botrys, the cutleaf germander or {{cut-leaved germander}} {{is a low}} to short downy annual, {{sometimes}} biennial, plant. It was noted by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 and is classified {{as part of the}} genus Teucrium in the family Labiatae (Lamiaceae). It has oval, but deeply cut leaves, which appear almost pinnate in form. Its flowers are two-lipped but with the upper lip diminutive. They are pink to purple and form from the stem {{at the base of the}} leaves, in whorls. It is in flower in the northern hemisphere from June to October. It prefers <b>limy</b> <b>soils</b> and bare stony ground. It is native to Western Europe, especially France and Germany. It has been introduced into north-eastern North America.|$|R
2500|$|The Sauternes wine region {{comprises}} five communes— Barsac, Sauternes, Bommes, Fargues and Preignac. While {{all five}} communes {{are permitted to}} use the name Sauternes, the Barsac region is also permitted to label their wines under the Barsac appellation. The Barsac region {{is located on the}} west bank of the Ciron river where the tributary meets [...] the Garonne. The area sits on an alluvial plain with sandy and <b>limy</b> <b>soils.</b> In general, Barsac wine is distinguished from other Sauternes in being drier with a lighter body; currently more Barsac producers are choosing to promote the wines under their own name. In years when the noble rot does not develop, Sauternes producers will often make dry white wines under the generic Bordeaux AOC. To qualify for the Sauternes label, the wines must have a minimum 13% alcohol level and pass a tasting exam where the wines need to taste noticeably sweet. There is no regulation on the exact amount of residual sugar that the wine needs to have.|$|R
25|$|Towards the {{interior}} of the peninsula, these forests become progressively more scarce: as the continental characteristics of the climate become stronger, the species most sensitive to cold become steadily more scarce. The continental groves, on soils lacking lime (calcium oxide), tend to be rich in junipers (Juniperus oxycedrus) and are superseded at higher altitudes and on cooler slopes by Pyrenean Oaks. This phenomenon is apparent in the Sierra de Guadarrama: when the oak forests have been destroyed, the soil is so poor and the environmental conditions so unfavourable, that it leads to ragged thickets dominated by common rock rose, Spanish lavender and rosemary. On <b>limy</b> <b>soils</b> something similar takes place, above all at altitudes of over 900 metres, oaks are accompanied by Spanish juniper (Juniperus thurifera) and the scarcity of shrubs is such that the same Holm oak (Q. ilex subsp. rotundifolia or ballota) dominates almost entirely on its own the first phases of deterioration of the forest. The degradation caused by burning or felling leads to thickets of Scorpion's thorn (Genista scorpius), thyme and common lavender (Lavandula angustifolia).|$|R
50|$|Melaleuca squamea is {{a useful}} plant as a screen or {{background}} plant. It is frost and drought tolerant and survives in poorly drained soil. It does not do well in <b>limy</b> or saline <b>soils</b> and prefers a sunny situation.|$|R
3000|$|... n+ {{among others}} [11, 12]. This {{chemical}} feature of HS improves physical soil properties favoring {{the formation of}} stable clay–humic aggregates through cation bridges, and soil fertility increasing mineral nutrient (P, Fe, Mn or Zn) availability for plants grown in alkaline and calcareous soils [15]. In fact, several studies have reported that a very significant fraction of Cu, Zn, Fe and Mn in <b>soil</b> solution from <b>limy,</b> alkaline <b>soils</b> was present {{in the form of}} complexes with DOM [16 – 18].|$|R
50|$|H. hirsutum {{grows in}} poor {{grassland}} on well-drained clay, <b>limy</b> and chalky <b>soils.</b> It is often {{found at the}} edges of woodland, on river banks and roadside verges. It is found throughout Western Europe, and in the United Kingdom it flowers from July to August.|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} five soil {{profiles}} developed on carbonatic sediments of Tertiary Miocene origin {{has been carried}} out. The topography of the area was basically flat and the traditional uses of the soils are the cultivation of dry cereals and grapevine. The geochemical characterization of the aforementioned profiles involves {{a study of the}} contents of major and trace elements among other pedologic aspects (texture, pH, organic matter, etc.). The results of this study also indicate a superficial enrichment of trace elements due to the leaching of Ca and moderate biological and anthropic activity. We can consider strontium, Sr, as the trace element that characterizes these <b>limy</b> <b>soils</b> (435 [*]mg/kg average content in total soil and 708 [*]mg/kg in the original rock). These contents are similar to the average value in Castilla-La Mancha of 380 [*]mg/kg and are higher than the average in world soils of about 200 [*]mg/kg. High levels of dangerous or pollutant elements (Cd, Hg, Pb, Cu, Zn, or Ni) were not detected. The majority of trace element anomalies are related to calcareous material and the leaching of calcium carbonate (Ca), while the influence of the anthropogenic factor is secondary. Soil quality does not indicate toxicity although surficial enrichment suggests a weak threat from consuming crops...|$|R
50|$|Atropa baetica grows {{among the}} {{undergrowth}} of mixed, upland forest on dry, sunny, rocky or stony slopes (and also, occasionally, in moister, shadier areas near watercourses) in <b>limy</b> (Calcium-rich) <b>soils</b> (often in disturbed, nitrogen-rich locations - see Nitrification and Human {{impact on the}} nitrogen cycle) at altitudes of 900-2,000 m. It is not, however, a quick coloniser of recently disturbed areas, preferring instead locations which have been disturbed {{at some time in}} the past e.g. the margins of disused or seldom-used paths, bridle paths and trackways (see ridgeway (road) and Drover's road) and also forest clearings, often in rather remote areas. A. baetica is frequently found growing in woodland of which the conifers Pinus nigra subsp. salzmanii var. salzmanii, Abies pinsapo and Juniperus communis form major components. Other frequent companion plants include the hawthorn Crataegus monogyna, the shrubs Buxus sempervirens, Viburnum tinus, Genista scorpius and Daphne laureola - and the tussock (grass) Brachypodium phoenicoides.|$|R
50|$|Paeonia delavayi is {{cultivated}} as an ornamental in gardens. In China, it is cultivated {{to produce}} a traditional medicine. It {{is said to be}} grown with ease, preferring a neutral or <b>limy,</b> deep rich <b>soil</b> in sun or partial shade. It is however sensitive to stagnant water at the roots and does best in soils with good drainage, such as in raised beds. Planting tree peonies in a sheltered position may help to prevent strong winds from breaking branches, particularly during flowering. Tree peonies in general can suffer from peony wilt (Botrytis paeoniae, a grey mould blight) and verticillium wilt, which may cause wilting and dieback of young shoots. In infected soils, honey fungus can cause instant death.|$|R
40|$|The {{qualitative}} {{indicators of}} wine are also sensoric properties besides analytic properties. The specimens were evaluated immediately after their stabilization. Of course, {{by the time}} the sensoric properties are changing and can influence later evaluation, even customers in their desicion for repeating purchase. Specialists evaluated specimen of white wines such as: rhine Riesling, Sauvignon blanc and gruner Veltliner from three locations of Znojmo winery region. All specimen weren´t fermented to dry and they weren´t procesed the same technology, in spite of this, the speciments were evaluated objectively as possilble. The common parameters of vineyards were: exhibition, evaluation above sea-level and average annual temperatrature. The climatic factors had minimum differences in both monitoring vintages of growing season. A different parametr had soils, their geological origin, type of soil, structure and po­wer of topsoil. The acquired results were evaluated and graphically displayed. Gruner Veltliner – specimen No. 1 – this variety was covered in smell and taste by used technology. An outstanding location was a vineyard Weinperky with paleozoic sediments of neogene and higher pH and deeper arable level provides this location incommutable feature in contrast to from other recognizing vineyards of future wine. More likely geological-soil features have even specimens No. 3 and 4, which showed balance characteristic features in recognizing vintage. The specimens No. 2 and 1 had quantity untypical variety shades and they showed balance large differences both in evaluating committees and in recognizing vintages. Sauvignon blanc – the most suitable location was a vineyard Knížecí vrch – a specimen No. 6, which lies on lighter <b>limy</b> <b>soils</b> of Dyje massif together with higher pH created nice feature of variety. A spe­cimen No. 8 had more likely characteristics of location than a specimen No. 6. That express in evaluation. A specimen No. 7 seems less typical and characteristic substitute in evaluation. Riesling rhine – the most suitable location was chosen vineyard Šobes by judges, which gives incommutable features to smell and taste by sandy soils of Dyje massif above river Dyje. A specimen No. 9 represented the smell; specimens No. 10 and 11 were evaluated as average and untypical. They had quite different features in recognizing vintages. The authenticity was extended by sensorial evaluation {{and at the same time}} the outstanding locations were chosen, which can give wines of unusual quantity every year in connecting certain variety. The most suitable locations for singular type of wine with extending authenticity are Riesling rhine – vineyard Šobes, Sauvignon blanc – vineyard Knížecí vrch, Veltliner grun – vineyard Weinperky...|$|R
