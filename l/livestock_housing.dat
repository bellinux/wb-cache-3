Located on {{the borders of the}} Yonne and Nièvre, the fortress hosted armies that came to defend the borders of Burgundy, being an independent duchy at the time.In the twelfth century, the castle became a fortress, composed of tall towers linked by a thick battlement and guarded by a walkway. Wooden buildings are backed along the walls. They are used for <b>livestock</b> <b>housing</b> and the storage of animal feed. Comfort was nonexistent and homes played a very minor role compared to the [...] "defensive" [...] role of the fortress. The tower of St. John is the last remnant of this fortress. The tower, one of the oldest in Europe, consists of five levels. The staircase leading to the floors was cut into the thickness of the wall (a thickness of 3.5 meters at ground level). On the second floor is a prison officer and a dungeon accessed through an opening in the floor. The roof is topped with a lantern containing the warning bell, to alert the castle inhabitants of impending danger.|$|E

40|$|Most {{countries}} where the livestock sector has an important social and economical place would like to reduce their emissions of ammonia and greenhouse gases. However emission estimates per building and per year are usually observed or measured with uncertainties higher than the reduction targets. Therefore mitigation strategies and public fund efficiency should benefit from progress in measurement and modeling of emissions from <b>livestock</b> <b>houses.</b> The quantification of <b>livestock</b> <b>house</b> emissions requires accurate measurements of gas concentration gradients. Infrared photoacoustic is used since decades because of selectivity, reduced drift in calibration, existence of industrialized analyzers. But even if the infrared bands selected by optical filters are narrow, unexpected interferences between gases and cascade effect can induce overestimation or underestimation of gas concentration. In <b>livestock</b> <b>houses,</b> molecules emitted by animals, the feed, the manure, the heating or motor-driven equipments can interfere with measurements of CH 4, N 2 O, NH 3 and CO 2 as {{it is not possible}} to compensate all the interferences. The aim of this study is to show how unexpected interferences in <b>livestock</b> <b>houses</b> can lead to either over/underestimation of NH 3, N 2 O or CH 4 concentration (e. g. for NH 3, 12 instead of 2 mg/m 3, and N 2 O, 3 instead of 1 mg/m 3) and to discuss how to detect unexpected interferences and cascade effects and to decrease the uncertainty on concentration measurements...|$|R
40|$|Intensive {{poultry and}} pig houses are major point sources of {{particulate}} matter (PM) emissions. The knowledge on {{the contribution of}} individual sources to PM in different fractions is essential to improve PM reduction from <b>livestock</b> <b>houses.</b> We developed a methodology to investigate which input data (particle chemical, morphological or combined characteristics) were best to distinguish amongst specific sources of airborne PM in <b>livestock</b> <b>houses.</b> We used a validation procedure with classification rules based on decision trees and analyzed misclassification errors. The PM from two livestock species (poultry and pigs), and in two different fractions (fine and coarse) was studied.

Using only particle chemical characteristics resulted in higher overall classification accuracies (62 – 68 %) than using only morphological characteristics (40 – 64 %) in poultry and pigs. Particle morphological characteristics can add value when sources show distinctive and well defined morphologies or differ in size. Using combined chemical and morphological resulted in the highest overall classification accuracies (average of 69 % of particles correctly assigned to their source) and lowest misclassification errors. This study provides a methodological approach to assess input data and identifies the most effective characteristics to apportion PM in <b>livestock</b> <b>houses.</b> These data are promising to determine the contribution of different sources to PM in <b>livestock</b> <b>houses</b> and give insight in under- and overestimation errors in the source apportionmen...|$|R
50|$|A linhay (English: , -nee) {{is a type}} of farm {{building}} found particularly in Devon, south-west England. It is characterised as a two-storied building with an open front, with tallet or hay-loft above and <b>livestock</b> <b>housing</b> below. It often has a lean-to roof, and the front generally consists of regularly spaced pillars or columns. Cattle linhays were used to house cattle in the winter with hay storage above. Due to the wide open front hay was easily thrown up into the tallet by use of a pitch-fork by a man standing on a hay-cart for storage after haymaking operations. The hay was kept dry by the roof {{and at the same time}} acted as insulation for the livestock below and was easily fed as daily rations to the cattle below by dropping it through openings in the floor directly into hay racks accessible to the livestock. A cart linhay stored carts and other farm machinery in place of livestock, with hay above. Linhays are now largely obsolete as in England cattle are generally housed in large pole barns with corrugated iron or plastic roofs and are fed silage, either in large round bales or in troughs, chopped up by machinery. These modern structures make possible feeding and mucking-out with large tractors.|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to morphologically and chemically characterize several sources of PM from <b>livestock</b> <b>houses.</b> We collected known sources of PM from different housing systems for poultry and pigs, which were later aerosolized in a customized laboratory dust generator to collect fine and coarse PM samples. These samples were morphologically and chemically characterized using scanning electron microscopy with X-ray microanalysis to develop comprehensive morphological and chemical source profiles. Moreover, source particle-size distribution was determined. Results showed distinct and unique particle morphologies in collected sources from different housing systems for poultry and pigs. Although presence of N, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, and Ca were identified in all sources, their relative element concentrations varied amongst sources and could be used to discriminate amongst them. Particle size and size distribution also varied amongst sources (size ranged from 2. 1 µm to 18. 1 µm projected area diameter), and mainly depended on its mineral or organic origin.

The three multi-stage scrubbers were one double-stage scrubber (acid stage+ bio-filter), one double-stage scrubber (acid stage + bio-scrubber), and one triple-stage scrubber (water stage + acid stage + bio-filter). Results showed that these scrubbers reduced concentrations of PM 10 by 61 % to 93 %, concentrations of PM 2. 5 by 47 % to 90 %, concentrations of airborne total bacteria by 46 % to 85 %, and concentrations of ammonia by 70 % to 100 %. Concentrations of CO 2 were not affected. Most of the airborne bacteria emitted from the pig houses were larger than 3. 3 µm (73 % to 95 %).

Being mainly carried out by mechanical systems, climate control entails a remarkable energy consumption. Considering the expected rise of energy use in the livestock sector, {{the lack of information}} regarding this energy share and the absence of an agreed methodology for its evaluation, specific studies are required. In this paper, results of EPAnHaus project are discussed. The project final objective is the improvement of the energy performance for climate control in livestock houses by establishing an energy certification scheme. EPAnHaus project also produced a set of general and specific information regarding energy performance levels of animal houses, valuable for decision management by breeders, agricultural engineers and politicians. An exhaustive literature review, for identifying existing energy benchmark values for climate control at European level, preceded and provided the basis for the identification of a methodology to estimate the energy consumption for heating, cooling and ventilation of the houses. The chosen methodology was adopted in developing energy simulation models for different animal production (pigs, poultry), which were calibrated and validated by means of a wide dataset of acquired data.

The concentrations of C, N, P, K, Ca, and Mg, and the C:N ratio of manure-composts prepared on-farm were analysed. The P concentration of manure was higher from zero-grazing units than from improved or traditional housing, higher from housing with roofs than from that without, higher when animals were fed concentrates than when not, and higher when manure was stored in a heap or pit rather than in a deep littering system. Use of bedding in the <b>livestock</b> <b>housing</b> resulted in manure with lower mineral N concentration and higher C:N ratio. Turning manure during composting resulted in manure with a higher mineral N concentration and lower C:N ratio. Results suggest that modification of traditional <b>livestock</b> <b>housing</b> (boma) to the zero-grazing system may have beneficial effects on some aspects of manure quality. Data on manure texture, colour, smell and biological activity were collected in an attempt to relate manure nutrient concentration and C:N ratio to easily discernible characteristics of manure-composts on-farm. Significant relationships were found between manure texture and the concentrations of P and mineral N, and C:N ratio. Significant relationships were also found between manure colour and N concentration and between manure age and mineral N concentration.

40|$|Nitrogen (N) {{losses from}} <b>livestock</b> <b>houses</b> and manure storage {{facilities}} contribute {{greatly to the}} total loss of N from livestock farms. Volatilisation of ammonia (NH 3) is the major process responsible {{for the loss of}} N in husbandry systems with slurry (where average dry matter content varies between 3 and 13 %). Concerning this volatilisation of NH 3, the process parameters of pH and air temperature are crucial. During a period of approximately 10 years, systematic measurements of NH 3 losses originating from a large variety of different <b>livestock</b> <b>houses</b> were made. One of the problems with NH 3 emissions is the large variation in the measured data due to the season, the production of the animals, the manure treatment, type of <b>livestock</b> <b>house,</b> and the manure storage. Generally speaking, prevention and control of NH 3 emission can be done by control of N content in the manure, moisture content, pH, and temperature[1]. In houses for growing pigs, a combination of simple housing measures can be taken to greatly reduce NH 33 emissions[2]. In houses for laying hens, the control of the manure drying process determines the emission of NH 3 [1]. Monteny[3] has built an NH 3 production model with separate modules for the emission of the manure storage under the dairy house and the floor in the house. Manure spreading is also a major source of NH 3 emission and is dependent on slurry composition, environmental conditions, and farm management. The effects of these factors have been employed in a model[4]. Losses via NO, N 2 O, and N 2 are important in husbandry systems with solid manure and straw. The number of experimental data is, however, very limited. As N 2 O is an intermediate product of complex biochemical processes of nitrification and denitrification, optimal conditions are the key issues in N 2 O reduction strategies. We may expect that in the near future the emission of greenhouse gases will get the same attention from policy makers as NH 3. Sustainable livestock production has to combine low emissions of gaseous N compounds with acceptable odour emissions, low emissions of greenhouse gases, and acceptable standards of animal welfare. For the entrepreneur, the strategy must be built on the regulations, the special conditions of his farm, and what is reasonably achievable...|$|R
