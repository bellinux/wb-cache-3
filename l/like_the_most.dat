5|$|In April 2012, it was {{announced}} that the Nickelodeon Suites Resort in Orlando would be reviving Double Dare as a nightly live stage presentation, Double Dare Live. As part of the Studio Nick feature of the hotel, shows were performed each night exclusively for the resort's guests. The show featured elements and updates from the various versions of Double Dare, including remixed music, physical challenges and an obstacle course similar to the TV show. <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> recent formats of the program, eight contestants were selected to participate for the game-playing teams, while additional audience members played other physical challenges throughout the program. Previews of Double Dare Live began on May 21, 2012, with an official launch date of May 25. The production continued until Nickelodeon Suites Resort Orlando rebranded as a Holiday Inn Resort on June 1, 2016. A scaled-down version of Double Dare Live, called Double Dare Challenge, was presented at Nickelodeon Universe in Mall of America from June 13 to September 24, 2016, and ran again from June 16 to September 30, 2017.|$|E

25|$|The next determinative {{style is}} the Gothic {{architecture}} in Budapest. The few remaining ones {{can be found}} in the Castle District. Buildings to look for are no. 18, 20 and 22 on Országház Street, which date back to the 14th century and No. 31 Úri Street, which has a Gothic façade that dates back to the 15th century. Another building with Gothic remains is the Inner City Parish Church in Pest, built in the 12th century. The most characteristic Gothic-style buildings are actually Neo-Gothic, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> well-known Budapest landmarks, the Hungarian Parliament Building and the Matthias Church, where much of the original material was used (originally built in Romanesque style in 1015).|$|E
25|$|Inserting neurons into a bioartificial nerve conduit seems <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> obvious {{method for}} {{replacing}} damaged nerves; however, neurons {{are unable to}} proliferate and they are often short-lived in culture. Thus, neural progenitor cells are more promising candidates for replacing damaged and degenerated neurons because they are self-renewing, which allows for the in vitro production of many cells with minimal donor material. In order {{to confirm that the}} new neurons formed from neural progenitor cells are a part of a functional network, the presence of synapse formation is required. A study by Ma, Fitzgerald et al. is the first demonstration of murine neural stem and progenitor cell-derived functional synapse and neuronal network formation on a 3D collagen matrix. The neural progenitor cells expanded and spontaneously differentiated into excitable neurons and formed synapses; furthermore, they retained the ability to differentiate into the three neural tissue lineages. It was also demonstrated that not only active synaptic vesicle recycling occurred, but also that excitatory and inhibitory connections capable of generating action potentials spontaneously were formed. Thus, neural progenitor cells are a viable and relatively unlimited source for creating functional neurons.|$|E

500|$|The subplot of Homer {{entering}} the childproofing business {{was inspired by}} an instance when a salesman visited Payne and his pregnant wife to see if their home was safe for children.

They make you feel <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> horrible {{person in the world}} and that your house is the temple of doom."

[...] A review in the influential entertainment-trade magazine Variety commented, [...] "Olivier is convincing in his role {{throughout most of the}} saga, {{the only member of the}} cast to achieve that status. [...] Screenplay [...] generally treats all others as one-dimensional buffoons, giving them lines that are unintentionally laughable. One reason is that all plot digressions are simply window dressing to the film's focus on the brutally invading North Koreans and the big-scale counterattack by the good guys. No speaking roles are given to the Communists, for example." ...|$|E

[...] While Setchfield was {{not a fan of}} Kay, he found his performance in this episode funny. IGN's Ahsan Haque gave the episode a score of 9.5 out of 10, particularly praising the dialogue. However, he felt that some of the sadder aspects [...] "seemed out of place in {{what should have been a}} purely light-hearted comedic episode". Slant Magazine reviewer Ross Ruediger was positive towards [...] "Love & Monsters", saying that [...] "there's no reason the series can't do something this quirky and beautiful when an inspired mind conjures up such a scenario." [...] Ruediger commented on the truths of meeting other fans on the Internet and praised the depth of Jackie's character.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{positively}} {{received the}} song, complimenting Minaj's cameo and the track's production and lyrics. Andrew Winistorfer of Prefix Magazine thought that Usher {{should have gone}} with [...] "Lil Freak" [...] as the album's first big single, saying, [...] "It (OMG) doesn't come close to matching the filthy heights of [...] "Little Freak ..." [...] He also said the song was [...] "by a wide margin, the best track to be leaked from Usher's long-delayed Raymond vs. Raymond album". In his initial reaction, he pointed out flaws of the song, but said that the song [...] "could become unavoidable if it gets traction on radio". Chris Ryan of MTV News called the song, [...] "slick, sexy hip-hop-infused R done to its finest". He also called the song [...] "nothing short of freak nasty," [...] and [...] "is so full of sexy sexuality that it's enough to make Tiger Woods blush". Vibe magazine commented that [...] "wedding ring is definitely off on this Usher cut", and that Nicki Minaj stole {{the scene in the}} song. Pitchfork Media commented favourably on the songs explicit nature, stating the song [...] "isn't some R. Kelly-esque devotional hymn to sexual addiction", and that [...] "The whole towering mess makes a drunken 3 a.m. threesome sound <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> epic endeavor anyone could hope for.." [...] The review also compared the song to Justin Timberlake's [...] "Cry Me a River", stating, [...] "it pushes into [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] territory {{for the same reason that}} [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] transcended: the gigantic, operatic backing track".|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} that the writers' and directors' guide for the series was published, dated March 23, 1987, the {{character}} was named Natasha [...] "Tasha" [...] Yar. Her surname was suggested by Robert Lewin, drawing inspiration from the Babi Yar atrocities in Ukraine during the Second World War. Her biography stated that she was 28years old, and confirmed her Ukrainian descent. She was planned to have a friendship with teenager Wesley Crusher, and was described in the guide as [...] "treat this boy <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> wonderful person imaginable. Wes is the childhood friend that Tasha never had." [...] In April 1987, Lianne Langland, Julia Nickson, Rosalind Chao, Leah Ayres and Bunty Bailey were each listed as being in contention for the role. Chao was a favorite candidate, while Denise Crosby was described as [...] "the only possibility" [...] for the character of Troi. The production staff were not keen on having two actresses in the bridge crew roles with similar physical types and hair colors, and so the team took account of the casting of the two parts together. The writers and directors guide described Yar as having a muscular but very feminine body type, and being sufficiently athletic to defeat most other crew members in martial arts. After Crosby and Marina Sirtis had each auditioned for Troi and Yar respectively, Gene Roddenberry decided to switch the actresses and cast Crosby as Tasha Yar. He felt that Sirtis' appearance was better suited to the [...] "exotic" [...] Troi.|$|E
