40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} peritoneal fluid (PF) {{proteome}} {{of women with}} and without uterine <b>leiomyomas.</b> STUDY DESIGN: PF samples were collected at laparoscopy from 14 women with uterine <b>leiomyomas</b> and 14 patients without <b>leiomyomas</b> who underwent tubal sterilization. PF samples were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, silver stained, digitally captured, and compared by computerised analysis. Protein spots with aberrant expression in PF of women with <b>leiomyomas</b> were identified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: One isoform of leucine-rich alpha- 2 -glycoprotein (LRGm), one immunoglobulin light chain, and one unidentified protein (pI: 5. 62; M(r) : 51. 1 kDa) had significantly higher expression in PF of women with <b>leiomyomas.</b> Two isoforms of fibrinogen gamma chain had decreased expression in PF of women with uterine <b>leiomyomas.</b> Following Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, the aberrant expressions of LRGm and of one isoform of fibrinogen gamma chain was confirmed. The expression of these molecules was not affected by the phase of the menstrual cycle. CONCLUSIONS: Uterine <b>leiomyomas</b> are associated with changes in proteins present within the peritoneal fluid. The physiopathological relevance of the increased expression of LRGm in PF of women with uterine <b>leiomyomas</b> remains unclear...|$|R

25|$|A {{physical}} examination, {{including a}} pelvic examination, and a pelvic ultrasound (transvaginal or otherwise) are both essential for diagnosis: physical examination may reveal increased abdominal girth and/or ascites (fluid within the abdominal cavity), while pelvic examination may reveal an ovarian or abdominal mass. An adnexal mass {{is a significant}} finding that often indicates ovarian cancer, especially if it is fixed, nodular, irregular, solid, and/or bilateral. 13–21% of adnexal masses are caused by malignancy; however, there are other benign causes of adnexal masses, including ovarian follicular cyst, <b>leiomyoma,</b> endometriosis, ectopic pregnancy, hydrosalpinx, tuboovarian abscess, ovarian torsion, dermoid cyst, cystadenoma (serous or mucinous), diverticular or appendiceal abscess, nerve sheath tumor, pelvic kidney, ureteral or bladder diverticulum, benign cystic mesothelioma of the peritoneum, peritoneal tuberculosis, or paraovarian cyst. Ovaries that can be felt are also a sign of ovarian cancer in postmenopausal women. Other parts of a physical examination for suspected ovarian cancer can include a breast examination and a digital rectal exam. Palpation of the supraclavicular, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes may reveal lymphadenopathy, which can be indicative of metastasis.

30|$|<b>Leiomyomas</b> are {{smooth muscle}} tumors that are {{generally}} well differentiated. They exhibit interlacing fascicles of uniform spindle cells with elongated nuclei that have blunt ends [10]. Angiomyomas are also described as vascular <b>leiomyomas</b> and angioleiomyomas. They are <b>leiomyomas</b> that apparently {{arise from the}} smooth muscles of blood vessels. In contrast to <b>leiomyomas,</b> angioleiomyomas contain many dilated vascular spaces amidst smooth muscle bundles arranged in a more concentric fashion. These vascular spaces are lined with an endothelium [11]. Angioleiomyomas are well circumscribed or encapsulated and contain minimal collagen. In addition, larger angioleiomyomas frequently have areas of mucinous alteration.|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Cutaneous <b>leiomyomas</b> are rare, benign {{smooth muscle}} {{neoplasms}} of the skin.

To present an uncommon case of cutaneous <b>leiomyomas</b> which, due to clinical similarities, had been previously misdiagnosed and managed as keloids. Case report. A 23 -year-old woman with Fitzpatrick skin type 4 / 5 was referred to the outpatient department of dermatology for treatment of keloids on the left shoulder. After examination we decided to take a skin biopsy for histopathological and immunohistochemical investigation, which revealed cutaneous <b>leiomyomas.</b> Conclusions. Cutaneous <b>leiomyomas</b> may be misdiagnosed as keloids. The former are of clinical relevance as they may denote hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer.

2500|$|It is {{believed}} that estrogen and progesterone have a mitogenic effect on <b>leiomyoma</b> cells and also act by influencing (directly and indirectly) {{a large number of}} growth factors, cytokines and apoptotic factors as well as other hormones. Furthermore, the actions of estrogen and progesterone are modulated by the cross-talk between estrogen, progesterone and prolactin signaling which controls the expression of the respective nuclear receptors. It {{is believed}} that estrogen promotes growth by up-regulating IGF-1, EGFR, [...] TGF-beta1, TGF-beta3 and PDGF, and promotes aberrant survival of <b>leiomyoma</b> cells by down-regulating p53, increasing expression of the anti-apoptotic factor PCP4 and antagonizing PPAR-gamma signaling. Progesterone is thought to promote the growth of <b>leiomyoma</b> through up-regulating EGF, TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta3, and promotes survival through up-regulating Bcl-2 expression and down-regulating TNF-alpha. Progesterone is believed to counteract growth by downregulating IGF-1. Expression of transforming growth interacting factor (TGIF) is increased in <b>leiomyoma</b> compared with myometrium. TGIF is a potential repressor of TGF-β pathways in myometrial cells.|$|E
2500|$|Both hypoxic {{conditions}} and serum deprivation induced increased expression of SFRP1 in <b>leiomyoma</b> cells. [...] However, the smooth muscle cells cultured from the myometrium {{showed no significant}} correlation between SFRP1 expression and oxygen concentration. [...] This suggests that SFRP1 may protect the cells from {{the damage caused by}} these stresses.|$|E
2500|$|Imaging {{modalities}} cannot clearly {{distinguish between}} the benign uterine <b>leiomyoma</b> and the malignant uterine leiomyosarcoma, however, the latter is quite rare. Fast growth or unexpected growth, such as enlargement of a lesion after menopause, {{raise the level of}} suspicion that the lesion might be a sarcoma. Also, with advanced malignant lesions, there may be evidence of local invasion. A biopsy is rarely performed and if performed, is rarely diagnostic. [...] Should there be an uncertain diagnosis after ultrasounds and MRI imaging, surgery is generally indicated.|$|E
40|$|Although uterine <b>leiomyomas</b> are {{the most}} common {{neoplasms}} of the female genital tract, {{this is not the case}} when referring to women under the age of 20. Only a few cases of uterus <b>leiomyomas</b> have been reported in this age.

The patient underwent multidetector CT examination of the abdomen and MR examination of the pelvis. Both imaging modalities revealed uterine enlargement and the presence of innumerable variably sized <b>leiomyomas.</b> Histopathologic examination following exploratory laparotomy confirmed the presence of uterus <b>leiomyomas.</b> The patient underwent laparoscopic myomectomy two years after the first operation, following MR examination of the pelvis...|$|R
30|$|We {{conducted}} a retrospective study of women undergoing hysterectomy for benign disease with a histologic diagnosis of adenomyosis, {{a diagnosis of}} both adenomyosis and <b>leiomyomas</b> and women with uterine <b>leiomyomas</b> but no adenomyosis.|$|R
30|$|Discussion: Thorough {{preoperative}} {{evaluation is}} of utmost importance in patients with <b>leiomyomas.</b> <b>Leiomyomas</b> with malignancy are extremely rare, nevertheless to improve the accuracy of clinical behavior of these tumors, a multivariate approach should be adopted.|$|R
2500|$|A {{blood test}} for a marker {{molecule}} called CA-125 {{is useful in}} differential diagnosis and in follow up of the disease, but it by itself has not {{been shown to be}} an effective method to screen for early-stage ovarian cancer due to its unacceptable low sensitivity and specificity. CA-125 levels in premenopausal people over 200 U/mL may indicate ovarian cancer, as may any elevation in CA-125 above 35 U/mL in post-menopausal people. CA-125 levels are not accurate in early stage ovarian cancer, as fully half of stage I ovarian cancer patients have a normal CA-125 level. CA-125 may also be elevated in benign (non-cancerous) conditions, including endometriosis, pregnancy, uterine fibroids, menstruation, ovarian cysts, systemic lupus erythematosus, liver disease, inflammatory bowel disease, pelvic inflammatory disease, and <b>leiomyoma.</b> [...] HE4 is another candidate for ovarian cancer testing, though it has not been extensively tested. Other tumor markers for ovarian cancer include CA19-9, CA72-4, CA15-3, immunosuppressive acidic protein, haptoglobin-alpha, OVX1, mesothelin, lysophosphatidic acid, osteopontin, and fibroblast growth factor 23.|$|E
