40|$|Objective: Identify {{similarities}} and/or {{differences in}} the distribution of Value Added characterizing family businesses as opposed to non-family held firms, and analyse productivity by linking the distribution of the wealth generated by the company to a variety of related agents or stakeholders (employees, providers of <b>loan</b> <b>capital,</b> and <b>shareholders).</b> Design/methodology: A data series consisting of VA distribution in a sample of 8, 609 Spanish companies, of which 5, 109 are family firms and another 3, 500 companies which are not, for the period comprising 2008 to 2013 was employed for this study. The data from the financial statements pertaining to these companies was taken from the SABI system (a privately-funded database analysing the financials of Spanish and Portuguese firms, operated by INFORMA, SA), selecting only those companies that employ standardized financial reporting practices. Findings and results: The work shows the existence of significant differences between family and non-family businesses {{in the distribution of}} value added among the different stakeholders. Given that, although both types of company spend most of the value added to remunerate staff, the family company spends a higher proportion thereof on self-financing as compared to non-family businesses, which spend a higher percentage on the remuneration of firm ownership. On the other hand, the lower labour productivity of family businesses is apparent, a result that can be explained both by the lower staff monetary remuneration, as well as the use of production technologies that are also less capital-intensive. Limitations: The study included only medium and large companies. These are companies that report financial statements offering more disaggregated data (through use of the standard forms). This owes to the legal requirement of these companies to file a cash flow statement, a necessary source for deriving information on dividends paid by the company. Added value: This is the first study in which the workings of added value are used to analyse the presence of measurable management differences in a large sample of companies using family ownership as the main criteria for differentiation...|$|R

40|$|This study investigates tax and non-tax {{determinants}} of corporate acquisition structure. In contrast to previous research, this study analyzes acquisitions from an investment financing perspective and investigates the tax implications of transaction structure {{for all three}} contracting parties [...] acquiring firm, target firm and target firm shareholders. Results indicate that the probability of an equity-financed tax-free transaction structure is an increasing function of the acquiring firm's likelihood of tax exhaustion. The probability of a debt-financed taxable transaction is a decreasing function {{of the percentage of}} the acquiring firm's value represented by growth opportunities (market to book ratio), and an increasing function of acquiring firm leverage and size. The results provide mixed support for the notion that target firm tax attributes and potential target firm <b>shareholder</b> <b>capital</b> gains tax liabilities influence acquisition structure. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 was expected to increase the likelihood that corporate acquisitions would be completed as tax-free transactions. Evidence in this study fails to support the conclusion that TRA 86 impacted the way in which corporate acquisitions are consummated in the aggregate. Furthermore, results indicate that TRA 86 did not modify the impact, on acquisition structure, of target firm tax attributes or <b>shareholder</b> <b>capital</b> gains tax liabilities. Overall, this study provides new evidence that tax and non-tax characteristics of acquiring firms are important {{determinants of}} the structure of corporate acquisitions...|$|R

3000|$|We {{apply to}} the {{concrete}} setup of a bank engaged into bilateral trade portfolios the XVA theoretical framework of [...] (Albanese and Crépey 2017), whereby so-called contra-liabilities and cost of capital are charged by the bank to its clients, {{on top of the}} fair valuation of counterparty risk, in order to account for the incompleteness of this risk. The transfer of the residual reserve credit <b>capital</b> from <b>shareholders</b> to creditors at bank default results in a unilateral CVA, consistent with the regulatory requirement that capital should not diminish as an effect of the sole deterioration of the bank credit spread. Our funding cost for variation margin (FVA) is defined asymmetrically since there is no benefit in holding excess capital in the future. Capital is fungible as a source of funding for variation margin, causing a material FVA reduction. We introduce a specialist initial margin lending scheme that drastically reduces the funding cost for initial margin (MVA). Our capital valuation adjustment (KVA) is defined as a risk premium, i.e. the cost of remunerating <b>shareholder</b> <b>capital</b> at risk at some hurdle rate.|$|R
