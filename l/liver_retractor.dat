30|$|A 64 -year-old woman {{diagnosed}} with early gastric cancer on the posterior midbody {{of the stomach}} was referred to our hospital for treatment. Computed tomography showed levocardia and inverted abdominal organs without enlarged lymph nodes or distant metastases. Polysplenia syndrome, intestinal malrotation, and left-sided gallbladder were also detected. RADG with D 1 + lymph node dissection and Billroth I reconstruction (delta-shaped anastomosis) were performed using robotics. Hepatopathy caused by a <b>liver</b> <b>retractor</b> and pancreatic fistula were identified during the postoperative course, and the latter was classified as grade II based on Clavien-Dindo classification. The patient was discharged 18  days after the operation.|$|E
40|$|Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomies becamemore {{common in}} the past few years as a safe and {{effective}} treatment option for benign and low-grade malignant tumors of the body and tail of the pancreas. Adequate exposure and wide operative field are crucial to perform this procedure, and this is achieved by retraction of the stomach with an angled <b>liver</b> <b>retractor</b> or a grasper through a subxiphoid trocar, that is usually used only to this purpose. We developed an innovative technique to retract the stomach during laparoscopic distal pancreatectomies that provides excellent operative field and frees the subxiphoid trocar to be used in other tasks during the surgery...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The laparoscopic access, {{with its}} classically known benefits, pushed {{implementation}} in other components, better ergonomy and aesthetic aspect. AIM: To minimize {{the number and}} diameter of traditional portals using miniport and flexible <b>liver</b> <b>retractor</b> on bariatric surgery. METHOD: This prospective study was used in patients with less than 45 kg/m 2, with peripheral fat, normal umbilicus implantation, without previous abdominoplasties. Were used one 30 o optical device with 5 mm in diameter, four accesses (one mini of 3 mm to the left hand of the surgeon, one of 5 mm to the right hand alternating with optics, one of 12 mm for umbilical for surgical maneuvers as dissection, clipping, in/out of gauze, and one portal of 5 mm for the assistant surgeon), {{resulting in a total}} of 25 mm linear incision; additionally, one flexible <b>liver</b> <b>retractor</b> (covered with a nelaton probe to protect the liver parenchyma, anchored in the right diaphragmatic pillar and going out through the surgeon left portal) to visualize the esophagogastric angle. RESULTS: In selected patients (48 operations), gastric bypass was performed at a similar time to the procedures with larger diameters (5 or 6 portals and 10 mm optics, with sum of linear incision of 42 mm) including oversuture line on excluded stomach, gastric tube and mesenteric closing. The non sutured portal of 3 mm and the two of 5 mm with subdermal sutures, were hardly visible in the folds of the skin; the one of 12 mm was buried inside the umbilicus or in the abdominoplasty incision. CONCLUSION: Minimizing portals is safe, effective, good ergonomic alternative with satisfactory aesthetic profile without need for specific instruments, new learning curve and limited movement of the instruments, as required by the single port...|$|E

40|$|Background: Laparoscopic {{insertion}} of a gastric band for weight reduction is increasingly performed in obese and morbidly obese patients. Complication rates after gastric band insertion are reduced by using certain techniques. Patients and Methods: This was a prospective study of all patients who underwent laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) insertion at our unit. This procedure is performed through the classical 4 -port technique {{and the use}} of a <b>liver</b> <b>retractor.</b> The pars flaccida method is performed in all patients, and the gold finger, a malleable instrument, is used to guide the band through the retroesophageal window in patients with difficult anatomy. Band slippage is avoided by using 2 types of gastric plication, depending on the anatomical characteristics of the stomach. Outcomes and morbidity are recorded, and patients are followed up in outpatient clinics. Results: Laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) insertion was performed in 464 patients. A single consultant surgeon performed all procedures over a 2 -year period...|$|E
40|$|Type I choledochal cyst {{is a rare}} saccular or {{fusiform}} congenital dilatation of the extrahepatic biliary tract. It {{is usually}} treated by laparotomy at which the cyst is completely excised and a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy is performed to establish biliary enteric drainage. We report the laparoscopic excision and hepaticoduodenostomy of type I choledochal cyst in two girls aged 1 and 3 years. The entire procedure was performed laparoscopically using needlescopic instruments. A 7 -mm telescope port was inserted at the umbilicus, a 3 -mm port in the right upper quadrant, and a 6 -mm port in left upper quadrant. An additional 3 -mm fan-shaped <b>liver</b> <b>retractor</b> was passed through the abdominal wall without a trocar. The gallbladder and choledochal cyst was dissected and removed en bloc. The {{lower end of the}} common bile duct was closed with 5 - 0 polydioxanone. The duodenum was anastomosed to the common hepatic duct below the confluence of the right and left hepatic ducts. There were no intraoperative complications, and the children were asymptomatic with no episodes of cholangitis at 6 months follow-up. Pediatric surgeons trained in advanced laparoscopic techniques including intracorporeal suturing can perform laparoscopic repair of choledochal cyst safel...|$|E
40|$|Nine adult Asiatic {{black bears}} (Ursus thibetanus) {{previously}} rescued from illegal bile farming in Vietnam were examined via abdominal ultrasound and exploratory laparoscopy for liver and gall bladder pathology. Three bears demonstrated notable gall bladder pathology, and minimally invasive cholecystectomies were performed using an open laparoscopic access approach, standard 10 to 12 mmHg carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum and a four-port technique. A single bear required insertion {{of an additional}} 5 mm port and use of a flexible <b>liver</b> <b>retractor</b> due {{to the presence of}} extensive adhesions between the gall bladder and quadrate and left and right medial liver lobes. The cystic duct was dissected free and this and the cystic artery were ligated by means of extracorporeal tied Meltzer knot sutures. The gall bladder was dissected free of the liver by blunt and sharp dissection, aided by 3. 8 MHz monopolar radiosurgery. Bears that have had open abdominal cholecystectomies are reported as taking four to six weeks before a return to normal activity postoperatively. In contrast, these bears demonstrated rapid unremarkable healing, and were allowed unrestricted access to outside enclosures to climb trees, swim and interact normally with other bears within seven days of surgery...|$|E
40|$|Background: Liver {{retraction}} {{is necessary}} for optimal exposure during laparoscopic gastric surgery. Though transient venous congestion of the retracted lobe of the liver is invariably seen during operations, major parenchymal injury is rare. We describe a case of Nathanson liver retractor-induced left lobe liver necrosis and review the pertinent literature. Case Report: A 78 -year-old man underwent a laparoscopic-assisted total gastrectomy for gastric cancer. A Nathanson <b>liver</b> <b>retractor</b> was used to retract a large fatty left liver lobe. The operation was prolonged due to splenic bleeding requiring splenectomy. On the second postoperative day, the patient deteriorated rapidly and developed multi-organ failure. A computerized tomogram confirmed necrosis of the left lobe of the liver with gas in the liver parenchyma. The necrotic liver lobe was excised at reoperation. The patient died from a postoperative myocardial infarction. Discussion: Though minor liver injuries, {{in the form of}} intraoperative trauma and congestion, are common with laparoscopic liver retraction, major lacerations and necrosis are rare. Prolonged surgery and enlarged fatty liver lobe increases the risks of major injury. In our report, we discuss various types of retractor-related liver injuries and their management and highlight the importance of intermittent release of retraction during prolonged surgery...|$|E
40|$|Background: Mirizzi {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} complication of cholecystolithiasis characterized by jaundice due to compression of the common hepatic duct. The diagnosis may not be immediately apparent, and management is controversial with open surgery still recommended by some authors. Method: A case is detailed herein of a 67 -year-old man who presented with abdominal pain, fever, and jaundice. A dilated bile duct was found on ultrasound, but the gallbladder could not be seen. The diagnosis of Mirizzi syndrome was made at ERCP, and a stent was placed through the papilla. Laparoscopic retrograde (fundus first) cholecystectomy was carried out utilizing a laparoscopic <b>liver</b> <b>retractor.</b> Results: In this particular case, {{it was not possible}} at ERCP to get a guidewire and stent past the obstruction. A stent was left through the papilla, below the obstruction and this allowed primary duct closure during surgery. Conclusion: Acute Mirizzi syndrome should be suspected when a patient presents with acute cholecystitis and jaundice with dilated intrahepatic ducts on ultrasound. ERCP is useful to confirm the diagnosis and allows stenting to alleviate the jaundice and facilitate the subsequent operation. Laparoscopic ultrasound is useful to locate the impacted stone and to partially replicate the touch of the surgeon’s hand, which is not available in laparoscopic surgery...|$|E
40|$|Background: Bariatric surgery {{has been}} {{established}} as the best option of treatment for morbid obesity. In recent years single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) has emerged as another modality of carrying out the bariatric procedures. While SILS represents an advance, its application in morbid obesity at present is limited. In this article, we review the technique and results of SILS in bariatric surgery. Methods: The PubMed database was searched and totally 11 series reporting SILS in bariatric surgery were identified and analyzed. The case reports were excluded. Since 2008, 114 morbidly obese patients receiving SILS bariatric surgeries were reported. Results: The procedures performed included SILS gastric banding, sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass. No mortality {{was reported in the}} literatures. Sixteen patients (14. 05 &#x 0025;) needed an additional incision for a <b>liver</b> <b>retractor,</b> a trocar or for conversion. Only one complication of wound infection was reported in these series. All the surgeons reported that the patients were highly satisfied with the scar. Conclusion: Because of abundant visceral and subcutaneous fat and multiple comorbidities in morbid obesity, it is more challenging for surgeons to perform the procedures with SILS. It is clear that extensive development of new instruments and technical aspects of these procedures as well as randomized studies to compare them with traditional laparoscopy are essential before these procedures can be utilized in day-to-day clinical practice...|$|E
40|$|Abstract During {{bariatric surgery}} in morbidly obese patients, the surgeon’s {{operative}} view is often {{obscured by the}} hypertrophic fatty left lobe of the liver. The use of a conventional <b>liver</b> <b>retractor</b> mandates an additional sub-xiphoid wound, resulting in pain and scar formation, {{in addition to the}} risk of iatrogenic liver injury during retractor insertion. To overcome these limitations, we developed a simple, rapid, and safe technique for liver retraction—V-shaped liver suspension technique (V-LIST) —by using a Penrose drain and laparoscopic stapler. A silicone Penrose drain was inserted into the peritoneal cavity and stapled to the pars condensa of the lesser omentum and parietal peritoneum using a laparoscopic stapler. The left lobe of the liver was retracted by the V-shaped suspension. At the end of the surgery, the drain could be easily removed. In October 2009 –February 2010, 14 patients underwent liver retraction with the use of this technique. We performed 12 Roux-en-Y gastric bypasses and 2 sleeve gastrectomies. This series also included three cases of single incision transumbilical laparoscopic surgery. The mean time re-quired to complete the liver retraction was 8 min 21 s (range, 2 – 18 min 40 s). Retraction was appropriate in all patients, without the need for additional retractors or conversion. There were no V-LIST-related perioperative complications. Our V-LIST technique using a Penrose drain is safe and simple. It has potential applications in single incision laparoscopic bariatric procedures...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Retrograde ("fundus first") {{dissection}} {{is frequently}} used in open cholecystectomy and although feasible in laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) {{it has not}} been widely practiced. LC is most simply carried out using antegrade dissection with a grasper to provide cephalad fundic traction. A series is presented to investigate the place of retrograde dissection {{in the hands of an}} experienced laparoscopic surgeon using modern instrumentation. Methods A prospective record of all LCs carried out by an experienced laparoscopic surgeon following his appointment in Bristol in 2004 was examined. Retrograde dissection was resorted to when difficulties were encountered with exposure and/or dissection of Calot's triangle. Results 1041 LCs were carried out including 148 (14 %) emergency operations and 131 (13 %) associated bile duct explorations. There were no bile duct injuries although conversion to open operation was required in six patients (0. 6 %). Retrograde LC was attempted successfully in 11 patients (1. 1 %). The age ranged from 28 to 80 years (mean 61) and there were 7 males. Indications were; fibrous, contracted gallbladder 7, Mirizzi syndrome 2 and severe kyphosis 2. Operative photographs are included to show the type of case where it was needed and the technique used. Postoperative stay was 1 / 2 to 5 days (mean 2. 2) with no delayed sequelae on followup. Histopathology showed; chronic cholecystitis 7, xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis 3 and acute necrotising cholecystitis 1. Conclusions In this series, retrograde laparoscopic dissection was necessary in 1. 1 % of LCs and a <b>liver</b> <b>retractor</b> was needed in 9 of the 11 cases. This technique does have a place and should be in the armamentarium of the laparoscopic surgeon. </p...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: We present 2 {{patients}} with free perforation of the anterior {{wall of the}} Roux limb due to marginal ulceration after an antecolic laparoscopic gastric bypass and describe the surgical management and laparoscopic repair technique. Methods: A 15 mm Hg pneumoperitoneum was established with a Veress needle via the left subcostal approach in both patients. Entrance into the abdomen was achieved with the 5 mm Optiview blunt trocar. The Genzyme <b>liver</b> <b>retractor</b> was used to lift the left lobe of the liver and expose the gastrojejunal anastomosis. A 30 ° 5 mm telescope was used for visualization. In both cases, free fluid and purulent material were noted in the subdiaphragmatic region and along the right paracolic gutter, but the gastrojejunal anastomoses was intact. A 1 cmperforation with surrounding inflammatory exudate was identified on the anterior surface of the Roux limb distal to the gastrojejunostomy. The edges were debrided and intracorporeal 1 -layer repair of the ulcer was performed with simple interrupted 2 – 0 Vicryl sutures. Fibrin glue {{was applied to the}} suture line and covered with an omental onlay patch. The anastomosis was tested with air insufflation and methylene blue dye with no evidence of a leak. A Jackson-Pratt drain was placed in the left upper quadrant. Results: Both patients underwent an unremarkable hospital course, and follow-up EGD examination after 3 months revealed no evidence of ulceration. Conclusion: Laparoscopic exploration and the repair of the gastrointestinal perforations in {{patients with}} a recent history of laparoscopic RYGBP is safe, if patients are hemodynamically stable and present within the first 24 hours of the onset of symptoms...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurpose: In {{an effort}} to {{overcome}} the limitations of single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) while preserving the cosmetic benefits of reduced ports cholecystectomy, we have developed a 2 -port LC that allows for the full, unrestricted use of 4 laparoscopic instruments. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data of patients who had undergone either 4 -port LC or 2 -port LC for benign gallbladder diseases between March 2007 and March 2013. Two incisions of 2 -port LC were composed of an umbilical incision as the manner of single-port laparoscopic surgery and a 5 -mm epigastric incision. These two incisions were utilized for comfortable bimanual manipulation under the liver-elevated vision provided by a <b>liver</b> <b>retractor.</b> Results: During the study period, 766 patients underwent LC; 263 (34. 3 %) started with 4 -port LC, and 503 (65. 7 %) started with 2 -port LC. Of patients started with 2 -port LC, 486 patients (96. 6 %) was ended up with 2 -port without open conversion or addition of port(s). The two groups had similar operative time, open conversion rate, incidence of complications, analgesic requirement, and length of postoperative hospital stay. Multivariate analyses revealed that the independent factors related to prolonged operative time (≥ 90 th percentile) in 2 -port LC were the presence of cholecystitis (odds ratio [OR] 2. 412, 95 % CI 1. 246 – 4. 668, p =  0. 009) and admission through the emergency department (OR 2. 132, 95 % CI 1. 135 – 4. 004, p =  0. 019). Conclusion: This study suggests that 2 -port LC for benign gallbladder diseases is as safe and feasible as 4 -port LC when it is performed by surgeons trained in conventional laparoscopic techniques...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The {{aim of this}} {{experimental}} study was {{the determination of the}} hand assisted laparoscopic total gastrectomy operative approach. Material – Method: For this {{experimental study}} we used 12 pigs with a mean body weight of 35 Kg, operated under general anaesthesia. In the first 6 pigs we tested operative techniques suggested in recent studies, as well as some variants of them, when the presented technique was not satisfactory. A new technique of hand assisted laparoscopic total gastrectomy was then developed and applied to the remaining 6 animals. A small, 6 mm midline incision over the umbilicus was made and the hand access device for the surgeon’s non dominant hand was put in place. A 5 / 10 mm camera trocar was placed about 10 cm subumbillicaly and 6 - 8 cm {{to the left of the}} midline. On the left and right midclavical line, 5 cm below the costal bow, two additional trocars were placed; a 5 / 12 mm handling channel trocar on the left and a 5 mm trocar to handle the right leading rib (thread) of the esophagus. Finally, on the posterior axillary line bilaterally and just below the costal bow, another pair of trocars was placed; a 10 mm trocar on the right for the entry of the <b>liver</b> <b>retractor</b> and a 5 mm trocar to handle left leading rib (thread) of the cross-sected esophagus. The gastrosplenic ligament and the short gastric arteries were firstly divided, followed by division of the duodenum. The vagus nerves were then recognized and divided. At this point the esophagus was divided and two threads were put in place. After careful division of the right and left gastric artery, the stomach was extracted through the hyperumbillical incision. An esophagojejunal Roux en Y anastomosis was then made using a circular and a linear stapler. The Roux en Y praparation was made extraabdominally through the hyperumbilicus incision. Results: No leak was identified and no bleeding occurred. The suggested technique is quite similar to the open technique, thus contributing not only to a quicker learning curve but also to an oncologic excision of the stomach. The method also proved to be safe, regaiding bleeding and anastomosis leak. The described surgical steps were followed fluently and without problems in all experiments, making the proposed technique easy to perform and repeatable. Conclusions: The described method of the hand assisted laparoscopic total gastrectomy is safe, sufficient, easy and repeatable. We think that, initially, the method can be used in benign disease cases and, as experience is gained, it can be used in malignant stomach tumors as well. However, in due time, we believe that the method will be applied in all cases that require total excision of the stomach. ...|$|E
