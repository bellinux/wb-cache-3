40|$|Topside ionograms {{obtained}} in the low-latitude region around the magnetic equator reveal cusp formation, indicating the existence <b>of</b> a <b>ledge</b> due to an enhancement <b>of</b> <b>ionization</b> in the vertical electron density profiles. The present work discusses two examples <b>of</b> <b>ledge</b> observations, one at noontime and the other at a pre-midnight hour. The noontime observations indicate that the ledge is formed in the region above the F 2 layer maximum where O(+) ions are predominant. A mechanism for ledge formation is discussed, in which a field-aligned anomaly in neutral density and temperature plays a significant role. Such an anomaly inhibits plasma flow along the field line and causes an enhancement <b>of</b> <b>ionization</b> along a particular field line over the magnetic equator...|$|R

I am answerable only for what I profess to have seen.|$|R
