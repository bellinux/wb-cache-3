25|$|The Panzerfaust 3's name {{dates back}} to the Panzerfaust used by the German army in World War II, which {{consisted}} of a small, disposable preloaded <b>launch</b> <b>tube</b> firing a high explosive anti-tank warhead, operated by a single soldier.|$|E
25|$|The Short Range Air-to-Air Missile, or SRAAM, was an {{experimental}} British infrared homing ("heat seeking") air-to-air missile, developed between 1968 and 1980 by Hawker Siddeley Dynamics. It {{was designed to}} be very manoevrable for use at short range in a dogfight situation. SRAAM was unusual in that it was launched from a <b>launch</b> <b>tube</b> instead of being attached to a launch rail, allowing two to be carried on single mounting point.|$|E
25|$|The Dragon Spears were {{equipped}} with a Bushmaster II GAU-23/A 30mm gun (an improved version of the MK44 MOD0 30mm gun), sensors, communications systems, and the Gunslinger precision-guided munitions system: a <b>launch</b> <b>tube</b> designed to fire up to 10 GBU-44/B Viper Strike or AGM-176 Griffin small standoff munitions in quick succession. Initial supplemental funds to the 2010 Defense Authorization Bill were for two kits to be installed in 2010.|$|E

5000|$|AR-3 - Chinese {{development}} of the AR-2 manufactured by Norinco, with its caliber increased to 370 mm; although it can still fire the 300 mm rockets. As with the AR-1/1A/2, the AR-3 adopts a modular design by incorporating two launching boxes containing several <b>launching</b> <b>tubes,</b> with the <b>launching</b> boxes replaced after the launching of rockets. When using 300 mm caliber rockets, each launching box contains five <b>launching</b> <b>tubes</b> like the earlier AR-1/1A/2, and when using 370 mm caliber rockets, each launching box contains four <b>launching</b> <b>tubes.</b>|$|R
25|$|SRAAM was {{designed}} to be carried in a <b>launch</b> <b>tube</b> to protect the missile. The fins on the missile were hinged and designed to extend following launch. The launcher comprised two tubes and an optional radar cueing system, enabling the missile to be carried by almost any aircraft with little modification. The missile could be fired automatically when a target came into view of the seeker (unlike e.g. Firestreak, which needed to be fed targeting information by the aircraft's radar).|$|E
25|$|Man-portable {{anti-tank}} systems (MANPATS or MPATS) are shoulder-launched anti-tank rockets. They {{are typically}} unguided weapons {{and are a}} threat to armored vehicles, low-flying aircraft (especially helicopters), and field fortifications. Generally MANPATS fall into three distinct categories. The first consist of a small, disposable preloaded <b>launch</b> <b>tube</b> firing a high explosive anti-tank warhead operated by a single soldier. The second is a firing system onto /into which a rocket is loaded, operated by a single soldier. The third are manufactured prepacked and issued as a single unit of ammunition with the launcher discarded after a single use.|$|E
25|$|Unlike Western designs, the R-21 used a cold launch {{solid rocket}} to eject the missile from the flooded <b>launch</b> <b>tube</b> before the main motor ignited. This allowed {{missiles}} {{to be launched}} in a water depth of 40-60m. The propulsion system used an IRFNA-amine fuel, AK-27I/TG-02. AK-27I {{was a mixture of}} 73% nitric acid, 27% nitrogen tetroxide, and an iodine passivant. The fuel was originally used in the Wasserfall rocket under the name TONKA-250 and consisted of 50% triethylamine and 50% xylidine. This gave the R-21 a range of , double that of first-generation sub-launched missiles. The Naval Institute Guide suggests that the range was initially 1300km, and extended to 1650km later {{in the life of the}} missile. There was a single warhead of approximately 800 kilotons.|$|E
50|$|A {{development}} study {{for a longer}} range version of the Polaris missile achieved by enlarging it to the maximum possible size allowed by existing <b>launch</b> <b>tubes</b> started in 1963. Tests had already shown that Polaris missiles could be operated without problems in <b>launch</b> <b>tubes</b> that had their fiberglass liners and locating rings removed.|$|R

500|$|In 1918 Admiral Miklós Horthy de Nagybánya became {{rear admiral}} of the fleet, and he {{determined}} {{to use the}} fleet to attack the Otranto Barrage. On 8 June 1918 he took Viribus Unitis and Prinz Eugen south with a small supporting flotilla; {{on the evening of}} 9 June, Szent István and Tegetthoff followed. In trying to make maximum speed in order to catch up, Szent Istváns turbines started to overheat and speed had to be reduced to [...] When an attempt was made to raise more steam in order to increase to [...] Szent István produced an excess of smoke, attracting the attention of a pair of patrolling Italian torpedo boats at 3.20a.m. on 10 June. MAS-21 attacked Tegetthoff, but one of her torpedoes failed to leave the <b>launch</b> <b>tube</b> and the other failed to explode. MAS-15 however hit Szent István with two torpedoes at 3:31a.m. Tegetthoff returned to the scene to take Szent István in tow. An attempt to beach the ship on nearby Molat Island (northwest of Zara) was considered, but the ship was taking on too much water. At 6:12am, with the pumps unequal to the task, Szent István capsized, taking 89 of her crew with her. The last half-hour of the sinking was filmed in stages from Tegetthoff . (It was one of only two battleship sinkings on the high seas to ever be filmed, the other being that of the British battleship [...] in World War II.) Fearing further attacks by torpedo boats or destroyers from the Italian navy, his element of surprise now compromised, Admiral Horthy called off the attack and the fleet returned to base {{for the remainder of the}} war.|$|E

2500|$|Besides the {{previously}} mentioned family of popular 40-mm grenades, {{the only other}} major use of a High-Low System was by the Swedish firm FFV in their development of the 1960s-era Miniman one man infantry antitank weapon. [...] The Miniman was simpler and cheaper than anything imagined by designers in World War II. [...] Inside {{what looked like a}} rocket launcher tube, is a HEAT projectile attached by a break away bolt to an alloy aluminum tube with ports drilled in it and which acts like a kind of high-pressure chamber. [...] The <b>launch</b> <b>tube</b> in which it is mounted acts as the low-pressure chamber. [...] When the propellant is ignited in the aluminum tube, gases escape through the ports and are allowed to build up in the <b>launch</b> <b>tube</b> to the point of almost causing a recoil. [...] The break-away bolt then snaps, allowing the projectile to move forward. [...] Unlike other High-Low Systems, gases are allowed to escape {{to the rear of the}} <b>launch</b> <b>tube,</b> achieving a totally recoilless effect.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1950s and 1960s some Whiskey {{submarines}} {{were converted}} to guided missile submarines, with the capability to fire one to four SS-N-3 Shaddock cruise missiles. In 1956, the first prototype was ready. a regular Whiskey class modified with a <b>launch</b> <b>tube</b> aft of the sail containing a single SS-N-3c. This vessel was known in the West as Whiskey Single Cylinder. Between 1958 and 1960, six additional Whiskey-class submarines {{were converted to}} carry guided missiles.

2500|$|Maintenance records {{revealed}} that the 65–76 [...] "Kit" [...] practice torpedo carried by Kursk came from a batch of ten manufactured in 1990, six of which were rejected due to faulty welding. An investigation {{revealed that}} because the torpedoes were not intended to carry warheads, the welds had not been inspected as carefully as welds on torpedoes carrying warheads. When salvage crews finally recovered {{the remains of the}} torpedo and the <b>launch</b> <b>tube,</b> analysis determined that both bore signs of distortion and heat damage that were consistent with an explosion near the middle of the torpedo, very close to an essential welded joint. The official conclusion of the commission was that a faulty weld had led to the explosion.|$|E
2500|$|The Werfergranate 21 (Wfr. Gr. 21), {{also called}} the 21cm BR (BR {{believed}} to be the abbreviation for [...] "Bordrakete" [...] in official Luftwaffe manuals) was an unguided air-to-air rocket version of the projectile used in the Nebelwerfer 42 and was first used in the defense of Schweinfurt on 17 August 1943. The Wfr. Gr. 21 was mounted on Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighters (one <b>launch</b> <b>tube</b> under each wing) and on the Messerschmitt Bf 110 and Messerschmitt Me 410 heavy fighters (two launch tubes under each wing) and was the first air-to-air rocket used by the Luftwaffe. Photographic evidence indicates that the Hungarians fitted three tubes under each wing of some of their twin-engined Me 210 Ca-1 heavy fighters. The rockets were used to break up Allied bomber combat box formations in order to enable more effective German fighter attacks against the scattered Allied aircraft. However, the high drag caused by the launchers reduced the speed and maneuverability of the launching aircraft, a handicap that could prove fatal if Allied fighters were encountered. Also, the launch tube's underwing mounting setup, which usually aimed the projectile at about 15° upwards from level flight to counter the considerable ballistic drop of the projectile in flight after launch, added to the drag problem.|$|E

50|$|Some water rocket {{launchers}} use launch tubes. A <b>launch</b> <b>tube</b> fits {{inside the}} nozzle of the rocket and extends upward toward the nose. The <b>launch</b> <b>tube</b> is {{anchored to the}} ground. As the rocket begins accelerating upward, the <b>launch</b> <b>tube</b> blocks the nozzle, and very little water is ejected until the rocket leaves the <b>launch</b> <b>tube.</b> This allows almost perfectly efficient conversion of the potential energy in the compressed air to kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy of the rocket and water. The high efficiency during the initial phase of the launch is important, because rocket engines are least efficient at low speeds. A <b>launch</b> <b>tube</b> therefore significantly increases the speed and height attained by the rocket. Launch tubes are most effective when used with long rockets, which can accommodate long launch tubes.|$|E
5000|$|When {{launched}} the missile is propelled from the <b>launch</b> <b>tube</b> at around 72 {{meters per second}} by a gas generator {{at the rear of}} the <b>launch</b> <b>tube.</b> Once the missile is clear of the <b>launch</b> <b>tube</b> the sustainer motor engages and accelerates the missile to a speed of 250 meters per second. Once the missile is about 400 meters from the launcher, the sustainer motor cuts out and the missile continues in free flight.|$|E
50|$|The {{system uses}} a gas {{generator}} {{to push the}} missile out of the <b>launch</b> <b>tube,</b> which exits {{from the rear of}} the <b>launch</b> <b>tube</b> in a manner similar to a recoilless rifle. The missile leaves the <b>launch</b> <b>tube</b> at 80 m/s, and is then quickly accelerated to 186 m/s by its solid fuel motor. This initial high speed reduces the missile's deadzone, since it can be launched directly at the target, rather than in an upward arc.|$|E
