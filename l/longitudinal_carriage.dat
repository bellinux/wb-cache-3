40|$|<b>Longitudinal</b> <b>carriage</b> {{studies of}} colonizing {{bacteria}} such as Neisseria meningitidis can {{provide important insights}} into the transmission dynamics of these organisms. Carriage is detected by culturing from a nasopharyngeal swab, but the sensitivity of this technique is low and varies between studies. This paper applies a statistical method for estimating the sensitivity of swabbing, infection rate, recovery rate and initial prevalence of carriage to three <b>longitudinal</b> <b>carriage</b> studies of N. meningitidis. These parameters and 95 % confidence intervals were estimated using maximum likelihood techniques. The sensitivity of swabbing {{was estimated to be}} 60 - 83 % and this should be taken into account when interpreting carriage studies. The estimates of force of infection and recovery rates seem to be consistent with estimates from more traditional methods. Differences in the parameter estimates between datasets may be due to differences in study design. This method could be used to assist in the design of future carriage studies...|$|E
40|$|Rates of {{acquisition}} and mean duration of nasal carriage of different serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae have been estimated by fitting a stochastic model to <b>longitudinal</b> <b>carriage</b> data in children from Papua New Guinea. Immunogenicity and two indices of relative invasiveness were determined for each serotype. Immunogenic serotypes were less frequently acquired and were carried for shorter periods, but {{no relationship between}} immunogenicity and invasiveness was apparent using either index of invasiveness. Frequent invasion {{was associated with a}} high acquisition rate and high frequency and prolonged duration of carriage. Carriage studies can provide a broad indication of which serotypes cause invasive disease but not the proportion of disease due to individual serotypes; some serotypes which cause invasive disease (e. g. serotype 46) are not found even in extensive carriage studies. The antibiotic resistance of carriage organisms, however, does approximate the resistance patterns of invasive organisms and thus may be used to monitor changing patterns of antimicrobial susceptibility in the community...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} {{protective effect}} of existing vaccines against serogroup B meningococci, based on outer membrane proteins, {{is limited by}} strain restriction and apparent short duration of immune responses. In contrast, meningo-coccal colonization is known to stimulate the production of cross-protective antibodies {{as defined by the}} develop-ment of serum bactericidal activity (SBA) against heterologous serogroup B strains. In the current study, a resource of human serum samples and meningococcal carriage strains from studies of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>carriage</b> has been subjected to immunoproteomic analysis to investigate the outer membrane protein antigens associated with the development of SBA to both homologous and heterologous meningococcal serogroup B strains. Proteins from outer membranes of homologous and heterologous strains were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis and reacted with paired sera which showed an increase in SBA following colonization. Individuals showed differing patterns of reactivity upon colonization, with an increase in SBA being associated with increases in the number of spots detected before and after colonization and/or with increases in the intensity of individual spots. Analysis of immunoreactive spots by mass spectrometry resulted in the identification of 43 proteins potentially associated with the development of SBA against both homologous and heterologous strains. The list of protein immunogens generated included not only well-established antigens but also novel proteins that represent potentially new candidates for inclusion i...|$|E

40|$|Invasive {{meningococcal}} disease (IMD) {{is thought}} to occur {{within a few days}} of pharyngeal acquisition of Neisseria meningitidis. During a <b>longitudinal</b> study of <b>carriage</b> and acquisition among 2453 first-year undergraduates we identified a male student from whom N. lactamica was isolated in October 1997 followed by N. meningitidis in December 1997. In mid-January 1998 this student suffered a mild episode of IMD (meningitis) during which N. meningitidis was isolated from his CSF. The meningococcus carried in December 1997 was phenotypically and genotypically indistinguishable from the invading organism, suggesting the possibility that the organism may have been carried for 7 weeks prior to the onset of invasive disease.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesOur {{previous}} <b>longitudinal</b> multicenter-based <b>carriage</b> {{study showed}} that the average carriage rate of Streptococcus pneumoniae was 16. 8 % in 582 healthy children attending kindergarten or elementary school in Seoul, Korea. We assessed serotype-specific prevalence and antimicrobial resistance among colonizing pneumococcal isolates from young children {{in the era of}} low use of the seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV 7). MethodsSerotypes were determined by an agglutination test with specific antisera or by a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. An antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed with broth microdilution in Korean 96 -well panels from Dade-MicroScan (Sacramento, CA, USA). ResultsPneumococcal colonization patterns were dynamic and longterm persistent carriage was rare, which indicated a sequential turnover of pneumococcal strains. Of the 369 pneumococci (except for 23 killed isolates), 129 (34. 9 %) isolates were PCV 7 vaccine serotypes (VTs); 213 (57. 8 %) isolates were nonvaccine serotypes (NVTs); and the remaining 27 (7. 2 %) isolates were nontypable (NT). The highest rates of multidrug resistance (MDR) were observed in VTs (86. 0 %; 111 / 129 isolates) and NVTs (70. 0 %; 149 / 213 isolates). ConclusionThis study overall showed the frequent carriage of VTs and NVTs with MDR in healthy children attending kindergarten or elementary school. Efforts should be directed toward reducing the extensive prescription of antibiotics and using new broader vaccines to reduce the expansion of MDR strains of NVTs in our community...|$|R
40|$|The dog is {{the natural}} host of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius. Many {{research}} efforts are currently being undertaken to expand our {{knowledge and understanding of}} this important canine commensal and opportunistic pathogen. The objective of this review is to summarize the current knowledge of the species, including the latest research outcomes, with emphasis on taxonomy, diagnostics, ecology, epidemiology and pathogenicity. Despite the important taxonomic changes that have occurred over the past few years, the risk of misidentification in canine specimens is low and does not have serious consequences for clinical practice. Staphylococcus pseudintermedius carriage in the dog is more frequent and genetically heterogeneous compared with that of Staphylococcus aureus in man. It appears that these staphylococcal species have evolved separately through adaptation to their respective natural hosts and differ with regard to various aspects concerning ecology, population structure and evolution of antibiotic resistance. Further understanding of the ecology and epidemiology of S. pseudintermedius is hampered by the lack of a standard method for rapid and discriminatory typing and by the limited data available on <b>longitudinal</b> <b>carriage</b> and population structure of meticillin-susceptible strains. With regard to pathogenicity, it is only now that we are starting to explore the virulence potential of S. pseudintermedius based on genomic and proteomic approaches, and {{more research is needed to}} assess the importance of individual virulence factors and the possible existence of hypervirulent strains...|$|E

In this study, we sought to determine PI– 1 prevalence in carried pneumococcal isolates and explore its relationship with transmissibility or carriage duration. We studied 896 pneumococcal isolates collected during a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>carriage</b> study that included monthly nasopharyngeal swabbing of 234 infants and their mothers {{between the ages of}} 1 and 24 months.

Overall, 35. 2 % of the isolates were PI- 1 -positive, but PI- 1 presence was restricted to ten of the 34 serotypes studied and was most frequently associated with serotypes 19 F and 23 F; 47. 5 % of transmitted and 43. 3 % of non-transmitted isolates were PI- 1 -positive (OR 1. 2; 95 % CI 0. 8 - 1. 7; p 0. 4). The duration of first-ever infant pneumococcal carriage was significantly longer with PI- 1 -positive organisms, but this difference was not significant at the individual serotype level.

40|$|Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) {{has been}} reduced in the US {{following}} conjugate vaccination (PCV 7) targeting seven pneumococcal serotypes in 2000. However, increases in IPD due to other serotypes have been observed, in particular 19 A. How much this 2 ̆ 2 serotype replacement 2 ̆ 2 will erode the benefits of vaccination and over what timescale is unknown. We used a population genetic approach to test first whether the selective impact of vaccination could be detected in a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>carriage</b> sample, and secondly how long it persisted for following introduction of vaccine in 2000. To detect the selective impact of the vaccine we compared the serotype diversity of samples from pneumococcal carriage in Massachusetts children collected in 2001, 2004 and 2007 with others collected in the pre-vaccine era in Massachusetts, the UK and Finland. The 2004 sample was significantly (p 3 ̆e 0. 0001) more diverse than pre-vaccine samples, indicating the selective pressure of vaccination. The 2007 sample showed {{no significant difference in}} diversity from the pre-vaccine period, and exhibited similar population structure, but with different serotypes. In 2007 the carriage frequency of 19 A was {{similar to that of the}} most common serotype in pre-vaccine samples. We suggest that serotype replacement involving 19 A may be complete in Massachusetts due to similarities in population structure to pre-vaccine samples. These results suggest that the replacement phenomenon occurs rapidly with high vaccine coverage, and may allay concerns about future increases in disease due to 19 A. For other serotypes, the future course of replacement disease remains to be determined...|$|E

40|$|Background. Natural {{immunity}} to Streptococcus pneumoniae {{is thought to}} be induced by exposure to S. pneumoniae or cross-reactive antigens. No <b>longitudinal</b> studies of <b>carriage</b> of and immune responses to S. pneumo-niae have been conducted using sophisticated immunological laboratory techniques. Methods. We enrolled 121 families with young children into this study. Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs were collected monthly for 10 months from all family members and were cultured in a standard fashion. Cultured S. pneumoniae isolates were serotyped. At the beginning (month 0) and end (month 10) of the study, venous blood was collected from family members 118 years old. Serotype-specific antipolysaccharide immunoglobulin G (IgG) and functional antibody and antibodies to pneumolysin, pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA), and pneumo-coccal surface antigen A (PsaA) were measured in paired serum samples. Results. Levels of anticapsular IgG increased significantly after carriage of serotypes 9 V, 14, 18 C, 19 F, and 23 F by an individual or family member. For serotype 14, a higher level of anticapsular IgG {{at the beginning of the}} study was associated with reduced odds of carriage ().

In young children, high rates of false positive results have been documented due to detection of concurrent nasopharyngeal pneumococcal carriage. The relationship between pneumococcal carriage and urinary antigen detection in adults from developing countries with high pneumococcal carriage prevalence has not been well established. Methods We nested {{an evaluation of the}} BinaxNOW S. pneumoniae test within a <b>longitudinal</b> mother-infant pneumococcal <b>carriage</b> study in Karen refugees on the Thailand-Myanmar border. Paired urine and nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected from 98 asymptomatic women at a routine study follow-up visit. The urine specimens were analyzed with the BinaxNOW test and the nasopharyngeal swabs were semi-quantitatively cultured to identify pneumococcal colonization. Results 24 / 98 (25 %) women were colonized by S. pneumoniae but only three (3 %) had a positive BinaxNOW urine test. The sensitivity of the BinaxNOW test for detection of pneumococcal colonization was 4. 2 % (95 % CI: 0. 1 - 21. 1 %) with a specificity of 97. 3 % (95 % CI: 90. 6 - 99. 7 %).

40|$|BACKGROUND. To {{prepare for}} {{national}} {{introduction of a}} pneumococcal vaccine of restricted valency, we studied the pattern of nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae and its transmission in Gambian villages over time. METHODS. We collected nasopharyngeal swab specimens every 2 weeks from 158 villagers in 19 households in 2 villages over 1 year. We studied the prevalence and duration of S. pneumoniae carriage, the effect of household size and composition on carriage, and sequence type-specific carriage within and between households. RESULTS. Ninety-seven percent of children and 85 % of adults carried S. pneumoniae at some time. Fifty-three serotypes were represented among 1522 isolates. Carriage was more common among children than adults for all serotypes studied except 9 V. There was an overall trend toward shorter carriage with increasing age (P =. 043) and significant differences in carriage duration between serotypes. For most serotypes, the odds of being a carrier were greater if there were other carriers in the household. The prevalence of carriage varied by serotype. Most notably, serotype 5 carriage occurred in only 1 village and was transient. Multilocus sequence typing of serotype 6 B isolates from 1 village revealed 8 different sequence types and strong evidence of nonrandom distribution among households (P <. 001). Study by sequence type suggested household spread starting most commonly in children, followed by spread to adults. CONCLUSIONS. This <b>longitudinal</b> <b>carriage</b> study in Gambian villages provides unique information on the pattern of spread of S. pneumoniae in rural Africa and a baseline for evaluating {{the impact of the}} introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine into the region...|$|E

40|$|Canine infections with {{antimicrobial}} resistant (AMR), particularly multi-drug resistant (MDR) {{bacteria are}} increasing, severely limiting therapeutic options, and representing an animal health issue. In addition, with potential transfer of AMR bacteria between dogs, their environment, humans and other animals, {{there may also}} be a public health risk. Commensal isolates can be a source of clinical infections and studies reporting the prevalence of AMR and risk factors for such isolates are important. Furthermore, {{one of the most significant}} impacts upon commensal bacterial populations is antimicrobial therapy that may select for pre-existing AMR organisms or transmission of resistance determinants. The aim of this work was to investigate AMR amongst canine commensal bacterial populations and the effects of five different antimicrobials, authorised to treat dogs in the UK, on these populations both during and after therapy. Three groups of dogs were enrolled: healthy non-antimicrobial treated, non-vet visiting dogs (n = 28), to investigate <b>longitudinal</b> <b>carriage</b> of faecal E. coli; healthy non-antimicrobial treated, non-vet visiting, dogs (n = 73) and antimicrobial treated, non-hospitalised dogs (n = 127) to investigate <b>longitudinal</b> <b>carriage</b> of mucosal staphylococci and faecal E. coli. Staphylococci and E. coli isolated from swabs (nose/perineum) and faecal samples respectively, were tested for phenotypic AMR and carriage of resistance genes by PCR assay. Staphylococci were assigned to species by PCR assay (nuc gene), MALDI-TOF-MS and sequencing (tuf gene). Healthy dog E. coli underwent phylo-typing, and a selection of longitudinal healthy dog E. coli isolates were genotyped. Questionnaire data were used to formulate independent variables. Statistical analysis included Pearson’s Chi-square, survival analysis and multivariable logistic regression; multilevel for clustered data. The prevalence of meticillin-resistant (MR; 42 %) and MDR staphylococci (resistant to ≥ 3 antimicrobial classes; 34 %) was high amongst healthy dogs, however MR-coagulase positive staphylococci were not detected. The most common species detected was S. epidermidis (52 % of dogs), followed by S. pseudintermedius (44 %). S. aureus was only detected in a small number of dogs (8 %). Faecal E. coli with AMR to at least one tested drug (63 %), MDR (30 %) and AmpC-production (16 %) were prevalent in healthy dogs, however ESBL-producers (1 %) were rare. Healthy dogs carried a predominance of phylogenetic group B 1; group B 2 E. coli isolates were less likely to have AMR while group D isolates were more likely. Carriage of E. coli with AMR to at least one tested drug was common and persistent, whereas MDR, AmpC- and ESBL-types were intermittent or transient. Genotyping revealed high intra-dog diversity with frequent new genotypes and resistance phenotypes detected over time. AMR staphylococci and E. coli were detected in more dogs following antimicrobial treatment than baseline, but generally returned to pre-treatment levels within three months. Eating raw meat/animal stools, living with other dogs/in-contact humans or pets that had been hospitalised/in-contact humans working with farm animals were associated with the detection of AMR canine commensal bacteria. In particular, following treatment with beta-lactams or fluoroquinolones there was a significant increase in the detection of MDR and AmpC-producing E. coli or MR- and MDR staphylococci, respectively. However significant differences were not detected at one month after the end of treatment. Antimicrobial therapy is a risk factor for antimicrobial resistant commensal bacteria in dogs and recovery may take up to three months after the end of treatment. This highlights the importance of prudent antimicrobial use and prescribing guidelines. However other factors, such as diet, in-contacts, co-selection and bacterial fitness may be involved in the carriage of resistant bacteria and should be considered...|$|E

However, the mode of C. difficile carriage in infants remains to be fully elucidated. We investigated <b>longitudinal</b> changes in <b>carriage</b> rates, counts, and strain types of toxigenic C. difficile in infants. Stools collected from 111 healthy infants in Belgium periodically from birth until the age of 6 months were examined by quantitative PCR targeting 16 S rRNA and toxin genes. Toxigenic C. difficile was detected in 18 of 111 infants (16 %) in the period up to the age of 6 months. The carriage rate of toxigenic C. difficile remained below 5 % until the age of 3 months. The carriage rate increased to 13 % 1 week after weaning (average age, 143 days) and reached 16 % at the age of 6 months. Counts of toxigenic C. difficile bacteria ranged from 10 4 to 10 8 cells/g of stool. Notably, two infants retained > 10 8 cells/g of stool for at least several weeks. Average counts in the 18 infants hovered around 10 7 cells/g of stool from the age of 3 days until the age of 6 months, showing no age-related trend. Genotyping of toxigenic C. difficile isolates from the 18 infants revealed that 11 infants each retained a particular monophyletic strain for at least a month. The genotype most frequently identified was the same as that frequently identified in symptomatic adult CDI patients.

40|$|This thesis explores {{aspects of}} Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) {{epidemiology}} and control, {{in view of}} the possible widespread introduction of conjugate vaccines in England and Wales. A review and analysis of a range of different epidemiological data sources showed that the burden of pneumococcal disease in England and Wales is high and remains mostly a condition of the very young and the elderly. A meta-analysis demonstrated the effectiveness of the polysaccharide vaccine against invasive pneumococcal disease among healthy elderly, to whom vaccination was not recommended at the start of this work. Using this result, a costeffectiveness analysis assessed the economic acceptability of such a programme, from the public health perspective. A better understanding of pneumococcal carriage and transmission is required to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of mass vaccination strategies with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. A novel model framework was developed and fitted to a <b>longitudinal</b> dataset of <b>carriage</b> in UK families. The results demonstrated an inverse relationship between duration of carriage and age and highlighted the importance of both family size and composition for persistence in a household. Great dissimilarities were estimated among the specific serotypes in terms of transmissibility, duration of carriage and level of competition. Realistic age structured dynamic models were developed and used to investigate the impact of a range of vaccine strategies. The importance of serotype replacement, as a consequence of vaccination, was demonstrated. The economic acceptability of alternative interventions with the conjugate vaccine depended on the magnitude of its indirect effects. Herd immunity had a considerable impact on the overall cost-effectiveness of the programmes since it may substantially reduce the burden of disease in older age groups. However, serotype replacement may counterbalance this reduction and lead to a non cost-effective result...|$|R
40|$|The Gram-positive {{pathogen}} Streptococcus pneumoniae is a {{major cause}} of community acquired pneumonia as well as of upper respiratory tract infections such as acute otitis media and sinusitis, and invasive diseases like meningitis, bacteremia, and endocarditis. However, S. pneumoniae is also a commensal of the upper respiratory tract, especially of young children, which represent the reservoir for pneumococcal transmission within the community. A major virulence factor of Streptococcus pneumoniae is the polysaccharide capsule. The pneumococcal capsule displays an extremely high variability (it exists in fact in at least ninety different types, known as serotypes) and provides an effective barrier against host-cell mediated phagocytosis allowing bacterial persistence in the blood. In addition to the capsular determinant, many other secreted or surface exposed factors have been described to be of importance for virulence through in vivo animal model studies and in vitro experiments (i. e. choline-binding protein A (CbpA), the pneumococcal toxin pneumolysin, pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA), pneumococcal surface adhesin A (PsaA), pilus components; however, their direct contribution to and essentiality for disease development in humans have still to be determined. Streptococcus pneumoniae pilus islet- 1 (PI- 1) -encoded pilus enhances in vitro adhesion to the respiratory epithelium and may contribute to pneumococcal nasopharyngeal colonization and transmission. The pilus subunits are regarded as potential protein vaccine candidates. In {{the first part of this}} study, we sought to determine PI- 1 prevalence in carried pneumococcal isolates and explore its relationship with transmissibility or carriage duration. We studied 896 pneumococcal isolates collected during a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>carriage</b> study that included monthly nasopharyngeal swabbing of 234 infants and their mothers between the ages of 1 and 24 months. These were cultured according to the WHO pneumococcal carriage detection protocol. PI- 1 PCR and genotyping by multilocus sequence typing were performed on isolates chosen according to specific carriage and transmission definitions. Overall, 35. 2 % of the isolates were PI- 1 -positive, but PI- 1 presence was restricted to ten of the 34 serotypes studied and was most frequently associated with serotypes 19 F and 23 F; 47. 5 % of transmitted and 43. 3 % of non-transmitted isolates were PI- 1 -positive (OR 1. 2; 95 % CI 0. 8 – 1. 7; p 0. 4). The duration of first-ever infant pneumococcal carriage was significantly longer with PI- 1 -positive organisms, but this difference was not significant at the individual serotype level. In conclusion, PI- 1 is commonly found in pneumococcal carriage isolates, but does not appear to be associated with pneumococcal transmissibility or carriage duration. In the second part of this work, we focused on non-typeable Streptococcus pneumoniae (NTPn). NTPns are typically isolated from nasopharyngeal carriage or from conjunctivitis. Since the isolation of NTPn from invasive disease is rare, we characterized the genetic basis for non-typeability of two isolates obtained in Italy from two cases of bacteremic pneumonia. Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) revealed that both NTPn belonged to ST 191, which, according to the MLST database, is associated with serotype 7 F. Sequencing of the capsular locus (cps) confirmed the presence of a 7 F cps in both strains and revealed the existence of distinct single point mutations in the wchA gene (a glycosyltransferase), both leading to the translation of proteins truncated at the C-terminus. To verify if these mutations were responsible for non-typeability of the isolates, a functional 7 F WchA was over-expressed in both NTPn. The two NTPn along with their WchA over-expressing derivatives were analyzed by Transmission Electron Microscopy and by high-resolution magic angle spinning NMR spectroscopy. Both NTPn were devoid of a polysaccharide capsule and WchA over-expression was sufficient to restore the assembly of a serotype 7 F capsule on the surface of the two NTPn. In conclusion, we identified two new naturally-occurring point-mutations leading to the non typeability in pneumococcus and demonstrated that WchA is essential for the biosynthesis of the serotype 7 F capsule...|$|E
