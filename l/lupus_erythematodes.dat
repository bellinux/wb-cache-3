However in spite of many reports the mechanism of their relationship and its details have not been made clear yet. For the purpose of studying this relation, the vearious kinds of liver funtion tests were performed to obtain the following data. 1. The disturbance of the liver function was observed in almost all the group. 2. The disturbed liver function was observed in 53 (32. 5 %) out of 163 cases. 3.

Values higher than 0. 80 UA on the absorption scale were considered pathological, namely 2 standard deviations above the mean (0. 32 UA) in the subjects examined; in the patients, values between a minimum of 0. 98 UA and a maximum of 2. 38 UA were observed. Longitudinal study of these cases also pointed to the disappearance of immune complexes during therapy. The results suggest that the PEG precipitation technique can play an important part as a screening test in situations in which circulating IC pathology is suspected; it is also a sensitive means of monitoring treatment...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{results of}} translation research (bedside to bench and back) in JDM. It focuses {{both on the}} state of literature and the research of biomarkers in JDM with the view to improving the care and outcome of patients. Chapter 2, through the SHARE initiative, gives an overview of the current literature with the goal of providing recommendations for clinicians in both diagnosis and treatment of JDM patients in order to unify the management in Europe. Recommendations were developed by an evidence-informed consensus process resulting in total, in seven overarching principles, 33 recommendations on diagnosis and 19 recommendations on therapy. Topics include assessment of skin, muscle and major organ involvement and treatment suggestion at disease onset and in refractory disease. Disease activity and damage scores have been developed, principally for clinical trials, but may be challenging and time consuming to use in daily clinical practice. Up to now, disease activity and damage score relay mainly on clinical evaluation, so, one of the major setbacks in the care of JDM patients is the lack of an objective marker to define response to treatment and disease remission. Having stated this, we describe in Chapter 3, 4 and 5 the detection of new biomarkers, Galectin- 9 and CXCL 10 and TNFRII, which have been detected by a multiplex immunoassay. This assay allows the measurement of a large panel of proteins in a single sample and a very small volume and is therefore a technique especially suitable for pediatric patients. We discovered these markers in a study cohort of Dutch patients; they had a remarkably high discriminative power between patients with active disease and those in disease remission, even in a very small cohort (chapter 3). The three proteins have also been shown to normalize in patients, which gained remission after autologous stem cell transplantation (aSCT) and are still high in those in which disease remained active (chapter 4). Of note, the markers did not decline directly after conditioning. Instead, the levels showed a slow and steady reduction after successful transplantation, correlating with improving clinical scores of the patients. This underscores the utility of these markers even in patients with a high immunosuppression. Furthermore, as CXCL 10 and Galectin- 9 are produced by immune and non-immune cells, these data suggests, that after aSCT non immune cells continue to produce these cytokines and sustain a low inflammation after aSCT. Thanks to an international collaboration with the Juvenile Dermatomyositis Research Group (JDRG) in the UK {{and with the help of}} the Dutch JDM patient’s organization (Bas Stichting), we were able to validate these markers in a larger cohort. The study showed that Galectin- 9 is the strongest biomarker in terms of discriminative power between active and remitting disease (chapter 5). We also measured Galectin- 9 in other autoimmune diseases and could show that levels of Galectin- 9 was higher in patients with JDM compared to patients with systemic <b>erythematodes</b> <b>lupus</b> or morphea and could discriminate between active disease and disease remission only in JDM. To ease access for patients, we tested these markers also on dried blood spots (DBS). For the DBS, several blood drops are collected on a card, but the tested marker must be stable at room temperature and for a longer time period, as the cards are supposed to be sent from home by mail (chapter 5). Only one of the markers showed enough stability: CXCL 10. In conclusion, we validated two biomarkers measured in serum or plasma to discriminate active and remitting disease: Galectin- 9 and CXCL- 10. Further studies with interventional and prospective design are needed to prove their utility in clinics regarding tapering and stopping medication. In the last chapter (chapter 6), the role of regulatory T cells (Treg) in muscle and peripheral blood of JDM patients was established. We showed that patients with JDM had normal Treg percentages in peripheral blood compared to age matched controls, independent of disease activity, while in patients with high dose steroid treatment increased Treg percentages were observed. Furthermore, Treg from JDM patients in disease remission did exert suppressive function in vitro, while those from patients with active disease were not consistently suppressive. Thus, Tregs are able to migrate towards the inflamed tissue, but somehow are unable to suppress inflammation. In conclusion, Tregs are probably involved in JDM pathogenesis, but are not controlling the disease. Promotion of Treg function and frequency may improve disease outcome...|$|R
40|$|Our {{investigations}} of the macrophage system in systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematodes</b> developing mice, have revealed increased numbers of macrophages in the liver of lupus prone mouse strains. This phenomenon was already shown in phenotypically unaffected, four weeks old mice. Based on these results we studied the proliferation of different organ-associated macrophage populations from mice at an age of four weeks and stimulated the cells with recombinant murine GM-CSF. In these experiments only a slightly increased proliferation {{under the influence of}} GM-CSF was observed. The incubation of non parenchymal liver cells in the presence of indomethacine, however, resulted in an increased spontaneous and GM-CSF induced proliferation in the autoimmune strains. The latter was found also in spleen and bone marrow derived cells.

40|$|Summary: Acquired von Willebrand {{syndrome}} (AVWS) in systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematodes</b> (SLE) {{is caused}} by autoantibod-ies directed against the circulating von Willebrand factor (vWF) /factor VIII (FVIII) complex. The autoantibody-vWF/ FVIII antigen complex is cleared rapidly from the circulation, leading to a moderate to severe quantitative and qualitative deficiency of both vWF and FVIIIc. Consequently, AvWS in SLE is featured by a prolonged bleeding time and normal plate-let count, a prolonged {{activated partial thromboplastin time}} (APTT) and normal prothrombin time (PT), decreased or ab-sent ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation (RIPA), and type II vWF deficiency on multimeric analysis of the vWF protein. Acquired von Wittebrand syndrome type II in SLE responds poorly to 1 -desamino- 8 -D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP) and FV III concentrate, but responds transiently well to high-dose gammaglobulin given intravenously. All reported cases of AvWS in SLE were cured by appropriate treatment of the un-derlying autoimmune disease with prednisone or immunosup-pressifln.

When applying this approach on clinically obtained chronologic data, autoregressive coefficients {{were obtained by}} means of a least squares method.

Judging from the degree of contribution, thus estimated, of the T 4 + lymphocyte level to the T 8 + lymphocyte level in a patient with systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematodes</b> (SLE), it seems that slower components in the movements of suppressor T-cells are governed almost exclusively by those of helper T-cells, indicating the malfunction of suppressor T-cells in such a patient. Also, by putting the obtained autoregressive coefficients into a state space representation of the system under study, it became possible for us to simulate an impulse response and/or a step response of the system are thereby to understand the abnormality of networks in pathologic conditions.

40|$|AbstractCD 23 is atypically highly {{expressed}} in various chronic diseases, including B-CLL, <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematodes</b> and rheumatoid arthritis. Its expression {{can be further}} enhanced by interleukin 4 (IL- 4). We have shown before that in B-CLL cells nuclear factor(s) of activated T cells (NF-ATs) show permanent nuclear localization and therefore constitutive transcriptional activity. Here we identify CD 23 b promoter as a novel target for NF-AT factors in B-CLL cells. The CD 23 b promoter contains two NF-AT binding sites to which NF-ATp and NF-ATc factors bind with high affinity. Mutations introduced into these sites abolished NF-AT binding and impaired the promoter activity, as did cyclosporin A (CsA), an inhibitor of nuclear transport of NF-ATs. Furthermore, we show that IL- 4 -induced transcription factor STAT 6 cooperates with NF-ATs in the induction of the CD 23 b promoter activity. These {{results show that the}} CD 23 b promoter is a target for NF-AT factors and suggest that the cooperation between NF-AT and STAT factors might be one of the molecular mechanisms responsible for high-level expression of CD 23 on the surface of B-CLL cells...|$|E
40|$|Vasculitis (angiitis) is a {{systemic}} autoimmune disease that often causes fatal symptoms. We aimed to isolate cDNA markers {{that would be}} useful for diagnosing not only vasculitis but also other autoimmune diseases. For this purpose, we used stepwise subtractive hybridization and cDNA microarray analyses to comprehensively isolate the genes whose expressions are augmented in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs) pooled from vasculitis patients. Subsequently, we used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT–PCR) to examine the mRNA levels of each candidate gene in individual patients. These analyses indicated that seven genes exhibit remarkably augmented expression in many vasculitis patients. Of these genes, we analyzed G 0 /G 1 switch gene 2 (G 0 S 2) further because G 0 S 2 expression is also enhanced in the PBMCs of patients with systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematodes</b> (SLE).

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{position}} of the pulsed dye laser (PDL) {{in the treatment of}} inflammatory skin diseases is still unclear. Evidence-based recommendations are lacking. OBJECTIVES: We sought to systematically review all available literature concerning PDL treatment for inflammatory skin diseases and to propose a recommendation. METHODS: We searched for publications dated between January 1992 and August 2011 in the database PubMed. All studies reporting on PDL treatment for an inflammatory skin disease were obtained and a level of evidence was determined. RESULTS: Literature search revealed 52 articles that could be included in this study. The inflammatory skin diseases treated with PDL consisted of: psoriasis, acne vulgaris, <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematodes,</b> granuloma faciale, sarcoidosis, eczematous lesions, papulopustular rosacea, lichen sclerosis, granuloma annulare, Jessner lymphocytic infiltration of the skin, and reticular erythematous mucinosis. The efficacy of PDL laser treatment for these inflammatory skin diseases was described and evaluated. LIMITATIONS: Most conclusions formulated are not based on randomized controlled trials. CONCLUSIONS: PDL treatment can be recommended as an effective and safe treatment for localized plaque psoriasis and acne vulgaris (recommendation grade B). For all other described inflammatory skin diseases, PDL seems to be promising, although the level of recommendation did not exceed level C...|$|E

40|$|Vasculitis, {{defined as}} a non-infectious {{inflammatory}} disorder of blood vessels, can affect vessels of any type in any organ. The gastrointestinal (GI) tract may thus also be involved. In systemic disorders as {{mixed connective tissue disease}} (MCTD) and systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematodes</b> (SLE), patients may present with symptoms of gastrointestinal disfunction such as motility disorders, caused by alterations in the connective tissue. True vasculitis however also occurs in the GI tract. Severe, occlusive damage often leads to ischemia that may result in ulceration and perforation. Non-occlusive vascular disease may lead to vascular leakage resulting in oedema and haemorrhage. Those patients often present with diarrhoea or symptoms of bleeding. GI involvement is frequent in Henoch-Schönlein purpura and also often noted in polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), microscopic polyangiitis, Wegener's syndrome and Churg-Strauss syndrome. Furthermore, GI vasculitis has also been described in giant cell arteritis, Takayasu's disease, Buerger's disease and leucocytoclastic vasculitides as essential mixed cryoglubulinemia, lupus vasculitis, rheumatoid disease, MCTD, drug-induced vasculitis and Behçet's disease. The diagnosis and classification of vasculitis relies upon a combination of clinical, serological, haematological, radiological and histological findings.

We previously demonstrated increased serum antibody responses against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) in various clinical phenotypes of X-ALD allowing speculations that myelin specific humoral immune responses might be involved in phenotype generation of X-ALD. In the present study, we investigated the possible association of (1) a naturally occurring variable number tandem repeat (vntr) polymorphism (C allele) in the 3 ' flanking region of the interleukin- 6 gene (IL- 6), previously demonstrated to modify the course of Alzheimer's disease, systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematodes</b> and Multiple Sclerosis (MS), (2) a tetranucleotide repeat polymorphism (TAAA) (n) in the 3 ' flanking region of the MOG gene and (3) HLA class II alleles with adult clinical phenotypes and serum antibody responses to MOG in 70 adult X-ALD patients.

However, serious side-effects occurred in up to 40 % and, in many cases, tolerance developed. Mortality was 25 - 38 % in 3 - 6 months, 50 % by one year. In five studies using hydralazine (sometimes combined with long acting nitrates), 150 patients observed from six up to 29 months showed sustained benefit in 26 to 59 %, while in many cases hemodynamic values returned to pretreatment values.

40|$|The aetiopathogenesis {{of acute}} and chronic {{myocarditis}} is rather complex {{as a great}} variety of infectious agents can induce cardiac inflammation. Moreover, many systemic and autoimmune diseases such as sarcoidosis, giant cell myocarditis and systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematodes,</b> drugs and toxins have been described as non-infectious causes of inflammatory heart disorders. Myocarditis may cause sudden death and lead to dilated cardiomyopathy. The correct and timely diagnosis of myocarditis is still a difficult clinical challenge, since the clinical spectrum of myocarditis is broad and comprises (amongst others) even those patients with no symptoms or those presenting with acute cardiogenic shock. Although endomyocardial biopsy still represents the gold standard for the diagnosis of myocarditis, new non-invasive imaging techniques such as cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging promise the non-invasive diagnosis of myocarditis. Considering the hallmarks of acute and chronic myocarditis (accumulation of inflammatory cells; swelling, necrosis and/or apoptosis of cardiomyocytes; increase in extracellular space and water content; myocardial remodelling with fibrotic tissue replacement), an imaging modality such as CMR that enables non-invasive detection of changes in myocardial tissue composition is highly valuable and welcome.

40|$|Chaperonin CCT {{containing}} t-complex polypeptide 1 is a cytosolic {{molecular chaperone}} that assists in the folding of actin, tubulin, and other proteins {{and is a}} member of the 60 -kDa heat shock protein (Hsp 60) family. We examined antibody titers against human CCT and other Hsp 60 family members in the sera of patients with rheumatic autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematodes,</b> Sjögren syndrome, and mixed connective tissue disease. Autoantibody titers against not only human mitochondrial Hsp 60 but also CCT were significantly higher in the sera of patients with rheumatic autoimmune diseases than in healthy control sera. Although immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers against Escherichia coli GroEL were high in all the groups of sera tested, no significant differences in anti-GroEL responses were detected between patients and healthy controls. IgG titers against mycobacterial Hsp 65 showed a similar pattern to titers of autoantibodies recognizing GroEL. Immunoabsorption experiments demonstrated that most of the autoantibodies recognizing CCT were cross-reactive with mitochondrial Hsp 60, E coli GroEL, and mycobacterial Hsp 65. Although most of the anti-Hsp 60 IgG recognized CCT, anti-GroEL (or antimycobacterial Hsp 65) IgG contained antibodies specific for GroEL (or mycobacterial Hsp 65) in addition to antibodies cross-reactive with CCT and Hsp 60. Results from immunoblot analyses, together with weak (15 % to 20 %) amino acid sequence identities between CCT and the other Hsp 60 family members, suggested that CCT-reactive autoantibodies recognize conformational epitopes that are conserved among CCT and other Hsp 60 family members...|$|E

The patients were instructed by a cosmetician how to use decorative cosmetics (Unifiance, La Roche-Posay, France) and applied it daily for 2 weeks. The dermatology quality of life questionnaire (DLQI) was performed before the first application and 2 weeks afterwards. The clinical course was documented by standardised photography. Unifiance was well tolerated and no side effects occurred. It completely masked the unwanted coloration and application resulted in a significant amelioration of the appearance. The mean DLQI score dropped significantly from 9. 2 to 5. 5 (p = 0. 0009). Improvement of quality of life reached statistical significance among patients with acne (2. 8 versus 7. 8, p = 0. 0078) and among individuals with a less severe initial impairment of quality of life (2. 4 versus 4. 2, p = 0. 007).

Diseased phases were repeatedly accompanied by minor skin lesions, which were initially classified as mixed tissue disorder. Psychotic phases were waxing–waning over years. During one later relapse, skin involvement was severe, classified to likely represent {{an allergic reaction}} to psychopharmaca; this generalized exanthema remitted rapidly with cortisone treatment and azathioprine. Under continued azathioprine and low dose neuroleptics, the patient remitted completely, appearing psychiatrically healthy for 16 [*]years. When azathioprine was set off due to pregnancy, an extraordinary severe relapse of schizophrenia like psychosis accompanied by most severe skin lesions developed within a few weeks, then requiring 2 [*]years of psychiatric inpatient treatment.

Those liver diseases in which the liver auto-antibody can be detected are infectious hepatitis, chronic infectious mononucleosis, and <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematodes,</b> and in addition, there are fatty liver, hepatoler ticular degeneration (Wilson's disease), mechanical jaundice, Banti's syndrom, and hepatoma; and all the liver auto-antibody of them start from necrotic destruction of liver tissue. 2. The liver auto-antibody titer were well correlated {{with the proliferation of}} interstitial connective tissue, exsudation in sinusoid, liver cell necrosis, and stellate cell activation, but have poor correlation with the portal cell infiltration and degeneration of liver cells. 3. Active chronic infectious hepatitis that later develops to liver cirrhosis, cholangiolitic hepatitis, and a portion of the chronic infectious hepatitis in which inflammation spreads to portal and periportal region show a high liver auto-antibody titer which persists {{for a long period of}} time. However, in such diseases as active chronic epidemic hepatitis or in serum hepatitis (posttransfusion hepatitis), the possibility of the liver auto-antibody becoming an endogenous factor to spread the local tissue changes to wider area is doubtful in the former, but it markedly strong in the latter. 4. It has been confirmed that heterophile antibody is produced by viral infection in infections hepatitis.

RESULTS: Mean absolute Constant scores improved from 29. 1 to 65. 9 points (P <. 001), age- and sex-adjusted Constant scores improved from 40. 1 to 87. 7 % (P <. 001), and subjective shoulder values improved from 35 % to 75. 2 % (P <. 001). Mean pain scores improved from 4. 2 points to 13. 1 (P <. 001). Three cases had a fractured glenoid component. Only these 3 had a definite loosening. Polyethylene wear was found in 2 cases. CONCLUSION: Use of an uncemented SMBG component yields controversial results. Osteointegration appears possible and loosening signs have virtually not been observed. Conversely, the current implant can be associated with a high failure rate (13. 6 %) because of implant fractures despite short follow-up. As loosening seems absent or minimal but implant stability insufficient, design changes need to be performed and tested in view of solving the implant failure problem while preserving the actually excellent bone-implant interface characteristics...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} several study groups concluded, after {{evaluation}} of prospective epidemiological studies, that depressive disorders are an independent risk factor towards cerebrovascular disorders. This {{proved to be}} true even if controlling {{for all of the}} so far known influential factors on risk of stroke. Which pathophysiological mechanism between depression and stroke is the intermediary so far though is unknown and part of intensive studies. A reduced cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) was found with different pathological conditions like Diabetes mellitus, untreated hypertension and systemic <b>Lupus</b> <b>erythematodes.</b> A reduced CVR (independent of cause) further got identified as independent risk-factor towards firsttime cerebral infarction. We hypothesized that depression is a condition in and of itself that leads to reduced CVR and thereby raises the risk of stroke in patients affected. Our studies showed mainly that CVR is indeed reduced in acutely depressive patients even if excluding all known vascular risk factors including consumption of nicotine compared to a healthy control group. Further we could show that contrary to our hypothesis it normalized in a state of remission being comparable to that of the control group. With our results {{it is not possible to}} conclude that the higher risk of stroke initially mentioned to have been found with depressive patients is mediated by CVR. Future studies have to evaluate if there is a subgroup of patients that does not show a normalization of CVR after remission or if the risk is only to be found with those who do not reach remission from depression and thereby continue to have a reduced CVR. The implication a reduced CVR might have in terms of prognostic course has to be studied further...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{clinical and}} immunological aspects of immunoablative therapy followed by reinfusion of T-cell depleted autologous stem cells {{in patients with}} progressive refractory Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA). After an intensive immunoablative therapy in order to eradicate auto-agressive T cells, autologous hematopoietic stem cells of bone marrow, purged of potentially autoreactive mature T lymphocytes, were reinfused as rescue to reduce the aplastic phase after autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Chapter 1 addresses the background and rationale leading to this study. Chapter 2 describes the safety, efficacy, complications and long term clinical outcome after ASCT in 22 patients with JIA, who were refractory to conventional medication. In chapter 3 the efficacy and safety of ASCT in 34 JIA patients transplanted in 9 different centers in Europe were evaluated. In chapter 4 the immunological effects of the conditioning on cellular infiltrates and expression of cytokines in the synovial tissue of two JIA patients were studied before and 6 months after ASCT. The subject of chapter 5 of this thesis is macrophage activation syndrome in systemic JIA patients. The actual effect of conditioning in vivo and graft manipulation ex vivo on the intended elimination of the adaptive (auto) immunological memory after ASCT was studied in 19 JIA/systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematodes</b> (SLE) and 10 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients (chapter 7). In order to obtain reference values for anti-rabies specific humoral and cellular immune responses after a single and booster vaccination, we conducted a study in 18 healthy controls as described in chapter 6.

40|$|Rubinstein–Taybi {{syndrome}} (RSTS) is {{a well-known}} autosomal dominant mental retardation syndrome with typical facial and skeletal abnormalities. Previously, we have reported two patients presenting with RSTS and additional clinical features including failure to thrive, seizures, and intractable infections (Bartsch et al. in Eur J Hum Genet 7 : 748 – 756, 1999). Recently we identified a third patient with this condition, termed here severe RSTS, or chromosome 16 p 13. 3 deletion syndrome. The three patients died in infancy, and all displayed a specific mutation, a chromosomal microdeletion including the 3 ′-end of the CREBBP gene. Using {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} and closely spaced DNA probes, we characterized the deletion intervals in these patients and in three individuals with a deletion of CREBBP and typical RSTS. The deleted DNA segments were found to greatly vary in size, spanning from ∼ 40 kb to > 3 Mb. Four individuals, including the patients with severe RSTS, exhibited deletions containing gene/s in addition to CREBBP. The patients with severe RSTS all had deletions comprising telomeric neighbor genes of CREBBP, including DNASE 1, a dominant gene encoding a nuclease that has been associated with systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematodes.</b> Our findings suggest that severe RSTS is distinct from RSTS and represents a novel true contiguous gene syndrome (chromosome 16 p 13. 3 deletion syndrome). Because of the risk of critical infections and high mortality rate, we recommend that the size of the deletion interval should be determined in CREBBP deletion-positive patients with RSTS, especially in young children. Further studies are needed to delineate the clinical spectrum of the new disorder and to clarify the role of DNASE 1...|$|E
40|$|A 51 -year-old man {{had been}} {{suffering}} from blood-stained purulent sinusitis for 4 months. He had proteinuria of 2. 62 g/ 24 h, microhaematuria and sero-logical evidence of inflammation (ESR: 92 / 135 mm, CRP: 12 mg/dl). When admitted to hospital with a suspected postinfectious glomerulonephritis, he com-plained of spontaneous colic-like pains in the left flank. Laboratory findings were as follows: serum total protein was 63 g/l and albumin, 24 g/l. Blood urea nitrogen was 20 mmol/l and creatinine, 469 mmol/l. On the 17 th day of admission he developed acute abdominal pain, combined with haemorrhagic shock. Hb fell rapidly from 10. 5 to 4 g/dl. An urgent CT scan of the abdomen revealed perirenal haematoma with dubious contrast escape from the right renal capsule. On operation, this {{was found to be}} a rupture of the kidney with perirenal bleeding, which was treated without removing the kidney (Figure 1). No biopsy was taken, but serological tests showed antineutrophil cytoplasmatic antibodies (cANCA), indicating Wegener’s granulomatosis as the cause of renal insufficiency and spontaneous renal rupture. Postoperatively, the patient’s condition deteriorated fast and he died 2 days before surgery. Spontaneous renal rupture is rare, but may be the first sign of Wegener’s granulomatosis. To our knowledge, no case of spontaneous renal rupture due to Wegener’s granulomatosis has been reported in the medical literature. Our case had a similar presenta-tion to an acute abdomen, which is a perplexing problem for the physician. In our case, serological signs of marked inflammatory activity, urinary sedi-ments of nephritis and spontaneous retroperitoneal bleeding should suggest that, in addition to <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematodes</b> and panarteritis nodosa [1, 2], Wegener’s granulomatosis be included in the differential diagnosis of spontaneous kidney rupture...|$|E
40|$|Peripheral CD 4 CD 8 double {{positive}} (DP) T {{cells have}} been reported {{to play a role in}} several autoimmune diseases, virus infections and cancer. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), both CD 4 and CD 8 single positive (SP) T cells are known to be involved in the pathogenesis, but the role of peripheral CD 4 CD 8 DP T cells has not been investigated in detail. Anti cyclic citrullinated antibodies (ACPA) positive and ACPA negative RA patients, patients with systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematodes</b> (SLE) and age matched healthy donors (HD) were enrolled in the analysis. The frequencies and phenotype of DP T cells in PBMC were investigated. In addition, DP T cells were quantified in biopsies from rheumatoid synovium. After in vitro restimulation, the cytokine production of DP T cells was investigated in cultures of PBMC. CMV specific cytokine secretion as well as proliferation was analyzed following antigen specific restimulation after an appropriate culture duration. DP T cells were found more frequently in RA patients than in healthy controls or patients with SLE. These DP T cells express ab TCRs, are of a memory phenotype and share features of both CD 4 as well as CD 8 SP T cells. Importantly, DP T cells were found to also be present in the rheumatoid synovium. Further characterization of DP T cells from RA patients revealed increased production of IL- 21 and IL- 4, implying a possible role as T helper cells. In addition, DP T cells in RA seem to contribute to the inflammatory process, because they produce significantly more IFNc than counterparts from HD and are increased in CMV+ RA patients. Given their capacity to produce a variety of cytokines (IL 4, IL 21 and IFNc), their association with ACPA positiv...|$|E
40|$|Antisera against free light (FL) chains were {{prepared}} and {{the determination of}} urinary FL chain {{was carried out by}} the single radial immunodiffusion technique clinically in various diseases including monoclonal gammopathy (M'-proteinemia) and malignant neoplasms. The results obtained are as follows. 1) Determinations of both free κ- and λ-chains (Fκ and Fλ) showed good reproducibility in concentrations between 10 to 80 mg/dl by use of the standard samples of κ- and/or λ-chain dimer. The error caused by the monomer was negligible in most of the urinary specimens except for those of monomeric Bence-Jones proteinuria. 2) The mean urinary excretions of Fκ and Fλ in control subjects were 4. 3 and 0. 9 mg/day, respectively. The ratio of κ- to λ-chain was in general around 4. 8 : 1 showing a tendency of κ-dominance. 3) A significant increase in urinary excretion of Fκ was found in the aged control as compared with the adult control whereas the relation of Fλ to aging was not clearly seen. 4) In diseases with M-proteinemia, FL chains coincident with the light chain types of serum M-proteins were elevated in urine and identified as Bence-Jones proteins. The serial determinations of these appeared to be useful as a monitor of patients with M-proteinemia. 5) It was noted that urinary excretion of FL chains different from light chain types of serum M-proteins increased together with Bence-Jones proteins. These FL chains were confirmed to be polyclonal in nature by immunoelectrophoresis. 6) Polyclonal FL chains often increased in urine from patients with cancer, leukemia and systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematodes,</b> and only one of either Fκor Fλ increased in urine from some patients. Therefore,it was conjectured that an imbalance in immunoglobulin synthesis might be involved in these disease conditions, and a possible relevance to hypergammaglobulinemia was considered {{to be one of the}} factorscausing the increase of FL chain excretion in urine...|$|E

This is the first study investigating serum concentrations of MMP- 3 in German cohorts of 34 patients with RA, 27 with systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematodes</b> (SLE), 14 patients with primary Sjögren’s syndrome (pSS) and 177 healthy controls by using a newly developed sandwich ELISA. In a retrospective follow-up study {{over a period of}} at least one year, serum levels of MMP 3 were correlated to clinical manifestations and Steinbrocker’s score in sequential antero-posterior radiographic images of hand/wrists and feets. MMP- 3 concentrations were significantly elevated in serum samples of RA patients compared to healthy controls and pSS. Concentrations of MMP- 3 correlated significantly with clinical activity (for DAS 28 -CRP r = 0. 46, P < 0. 0005) and radiological score (r = 0. 341, P < 0. 0005) in RA. Serum concentrations of MMP- 3 were highest in RA patients being in radiological stage IV (median 188. 2 SD +- 162. 59 ng/ml). Although highest concentrations of MMP- 3 were found in serum samples of SLE, no correlation was found with any laboratory marker or clinical indices. Based on the fact that MMP- 3 showed good correlation with clinical indices and radiologic stage of disease, these results indicate that measurement of MMP- 3 concentration is an independent marker for severity of RA. Since MMP- 3 is also markedly increased in other rheumatic diseases, MMP- 3 level is not specific for RA or erosive arthritis and therefore, cannot be recommended to confirm the diagnosis of RA...|$|E
40|$|The Lupus Nephritis (LN) is {{a serious}} {{complication}} of a Systemic <b>Lupus</b> <b>Erythematodes</b> (SLE), and {{is associated with a}} severely worsened prognosis. In the course of this inflammation, {{especially in the case of}} LN from WHO class IV, there is an accumulation of primarily T-cells in the interstitium of the kidney. Due to this fact, a thesis was formulated that these T-cells would also be found in the urine of such patients, reflecting the pathomechanics of the T-cell recruitment in the affected kidney, and serving as a marker for the kidney involvement in the course of the disease. The current article describes a clinical-experimental study comprising 67 SLE patients. Urine and blood samples from the participants, analyzed using flow cytometry, were compared to the current activity level of the disease as well as to any concurrent kidney biopsies available. The results show an increased incidence of CD 3 +CD 4 +T-cells in the urine from the SLE patients with kidney involvement. Neither the patients without kidney involvement, nor the healthy controls showed increased urine cell counts (p = 0. 003). Interestingly, a strong correlation was observed between the number of T-helper-cells and the activity level of the disease (p-value = 0. 0004; r-value = 0. 417). The majority of the observed urine cells proved to be activated memory/effector T-cells, which displayed a rather low concurrent blood concentration (p = 0. 006 und p = 0. 051). Similarly, very low blood concentrations were observed for chemokin receptors 1 and 5 on T-cells. Receptor analysis on the T-cells found in urine show a significantly higher expression of CCR 5 (p = 0. 038), while only an increased trend could be established for CCR 1 (p = 0. 052). According to the histological analysis, as well as the theorized pathomechanisms of the different WHO LN classes, the higher urine cell counts corresponded to the concurrent kidney biopsies in all 12 cases of class IV LN.

The main goal {{of this study was}} to examine PSL main polymorphisms of serotonin transporter gene, 5 -HTTLPR, rs 25531 and 5 -HTTin 2 VNTR to determine their potential association with depression and fatigue in patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS). Special goal in this study was to explore the frequency of signal hyperintensities (SH) of the brain in patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome who suffered frequent episodic tensio-type headache (FETTH) enough to sustain brain MRI, and association between SH and PSL. Clear difference between pSS patients and healthy controls was found, with PSL values being significantly lower in patient groups. Decreased PSL in Sjogrens' group, not in control group, is strongly influenced by the „low expressing“genotype s/s 5 -HTTin 2 VNTR, indicating the important role of interaction gene x environment (G x E) on disease fenotypes, whereas genetic effects are potentially facilitated by environmental factors. PSL has strongly influenced on depression and fatigue in Sjogrens' patients, which suggests that PSL could be used as biomarker of the depression and fatigue in these patients. These results support a biopsychosocial model od pSS in which 5 -HTT genotypes modifies risk for depression and fatigue. Long term, practiotioners may individualize treatment of pSS patients with depression and fatigue by sing PSL and 5 -HTT genotype as two valuable parameters. Furthermore, the current study demonstrated that signal hyperintensities (SH) on brain MRI are more common in specific region of the brain of Sjögren's patients with frequent episodic tension-type headache (FETTH) than in age-matched controls with FETTH, indicating more widespread cerebral vasculopathy in Sjögren's group. Brain MRI represents a sensitive screening tool for detection of SH in pSS patients with FETTH. Association between PSL and periventricular lesions in this study is in line with hypothesis of interrelation between increased platelet serotonin release and pathophysiology of brain tissue damage in specific region of the brain in pSS patient with FETTH...|$|E
40|$|Systemic <b>Lupus</b> <b>Erythematodes</b> (SLE) is an {{autoimmune}} disease {{characterized by the}} production of autoantibodies and immune complexes deposition. However there is growing evidence that cytokines production as Interleukin 17 (IL- 17), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, has a pathogenic role in this disease. Data suggests that a specific IL- 17 producing T-cell type (Th 17 cells) might play an important role; their differentiation might be controlled by IL- 27, an anti-inflammatory cytokine. The aim {{of the study is}} to analyze the relevance of IL- 17, IL- 27 and Th 17 cells in SLE patients compared to healthy donors (HD) and the specifity to SLE patients by comparing with other {{autoimmune disease}}s (OAD). Therefore, the frequencies of Th 1 and Th 17 of 21 SLE patients, 21 HD and 12 patients with OAD were analyzed by flow cytometry after stimulation with viral and bacterial antigenes. The concentration of IL- 17 and IL- 27 were measured by enzyme linked immuno assay (ELISA) in the serum of 131 SLE patients, 42 HD and 37 OAD. IL- 17 concentrations in sera of SLE patients were not increased compared to HD nor did they correlate to frequencies of IL- 17 in the peripheral blood or disease activity. Analysis of only female SLE patients revealed significant differences in Il- 17 concentartions of the sere compared to female healthy donors. Il- 27 concentrations in sera of SLE patients were significantly lower than in sera of HD. Our results showed that the frequencies of Th 17 cells after stimulation between SLE patients and HD were similar; but the frequencies of Th 1 were significally lower in SLE patients compared to HD. The concentration of IL- 17 in the sera of SLE patients was comparable with those from HD; while IL- 27 was significantly lower in SLE patients compared to HD. Interestingly neither of the concentration of IL- 17 nor IL- 27 in the serum correlated with disease activity or any clinical data analyzed. This study showed that raher than a disturbance in Th 17 cells in SLE, there is a disbalance between Th 1 and Th 17 cells which is consistent with a low IL- 27 concentration in serum of the patients...|$|E

Methods: This is a retrospective study of case series of patients {{and the effects of}} RTX on clinical, serological and immunological parameters. Therefore we analysed data from 21 patients who had been treated at the Charité, Berlin. Results: 12 of our 13 studied SLE patients responded to rituximab. One patient achieved a complete remission and the anti-dsDNA antibodies became negative, whereas the other 11 patients reached a remarkable amelioration of clinical activity scores BILAG and SLEDAI. Using SLEDAI without the consideration of serological items 2 / 3 of the patients showed a clinical remission. The median time to flare was 11, 5 months. Complement levels improved and the dose of glucocorticoids could be decreased. We did not find any general predictors for a successful treatment with rituximab. All of our 6 patients with GPA responded to rituximab. The median time to flare was 7 months. The disease activity score BVAS and the c-ANCA levels decreased significantly. The dose of glucocorticoids could be reduced. There was no association between the level of c-ANCA after rituximab and the time to flare. Both patients with scleroderma/polymyositis overlap showed a distinct decrease of those serological parameters characterizing muscle decay. Time to flare was 7 and 21 months. One patient had to start a therapy with methylprednisolone 3 months after rituximab because of an increased loss of hair and a minimal increase in creatine kinase (CK), whereas the dose of cyclophosphamide could be reduced. The dose of methotrexate of the other patient could be reduced and she experienced a normalization of serological biomarkers (CK and myoglobin). Unfortunately, the data set regarding flow cytometric analysis (FACS) of B cells and their subgroups was not complete. But the available data showed an effective B cell depletion of peripheral blood B cells. The rituximab infusions were well tolerated. There were only 5 SLE patients who showed adverse reactions. 1 patient developed a serious infusion reaction two days after rituximab. Another patient had a transient slight neutropenia. Conclusions: This retrospective study of rituximab treatment in refractory patients with SLE, GPA and scleroderma/polymyositis overlap underlines {{the efficacy of}} B cell depletion therapy in severe systemic autoimmune diseases refractory to glucocorticoids or conventional immunosuppressive agents...|$|E
