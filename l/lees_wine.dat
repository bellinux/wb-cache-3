40|$|The study {{examines}} {{the potential of}} wine industry by-product, the lees, as a rich mixture of natural polyphenols, and its physiological potential to reduce postprandial metabolic and oxidative stress caused by a cholesterol-rich diet in in vivo model. Chemical analysis of <b>wine</b> <b>lees</b> showed that their total solid content was 94. 2 %. <b>Wine</b> <b>lees</b> contained total phenols, total nonflavonoids and total flavonoids expressed in mg of gallic acid equivalents per 100 g of dry mass: 2316. 6 ± 37. 9, 1332. 5 ± 51. 1 and 984. 1 ± 28. 2, respectively. The content of total anthocyanins expressed in mg of cyanidin- 3 -glucoside equivalents per 100 g of dry mass was 383. 1 ± 21. 6. Antioxidant capacity of <b>wine</b> <b>lees</b> determined by the DPPH and FRAP methods and expressed in mM of Trolox equivalents per 100 g was 259. 8 ± 1. 8 and 45. 7 ± 1. 05, respectively. The experiment lasted 60 days using C 57 BL/ 6 mice divided in four groups: group 1 was fed normal diet and used as control, group 2 was fed normal diet with added <b>wine</b> <b>lees,</b> group 3 was fed high-cholesterol diet (HCD), i. e. normal diet {{with the addition of}} sunflower oil, and group 4 was fed HCD with <b>wine</b> <b>lees.</b> HCD increased serum total cholesterol (TC) by 2. 3 -fold, triacylglycerol (TAG) by 1. 5 -fold, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) by 3. 5 -fold and liver malondialdehyde (MDA) by 50 %, and reduced liver superoxide dismutase (SOD) by 50 %, catalase (CAT) by 30 % and glutathione (GSH) by 17. 5 % compared to control. Conversely, treatment with HCD and <b>wine</b> <b>lees</b> reduced TC and LDL up to 1. 4 times more than with HCD only, with depletion of lipid peroxidation (MDA) and restoration of SOD and CAT activities in liver, approximating values of the control. HDL levels were unaffected in any group. Serum transaminase activity showed no hepatotoxic properties in the treatment with lees alone.

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 One of {{the most}} common {{problems}} in wine production is the formation of hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) and other volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs), which can mask positive aromas at low concentrations and result in unpleasant aromas such as rotten egg, cabbage, garlic, and rubber at higher concentrations. Despite the large body of work researching formation of H₂S during wine fermentation, it remains a frequent issue. Furthermore, much less is known about the formation of these VSCs during post-fermentation aging and impact of factors such as <b>wine</b> <b>lees</b> composition. In particular, {{little is known about the}} role of lees composition on the VSC precursor compounds cysteine, methionine, and glutathione. In addition, while the impact of grape must nitrogen content on H₂S formation has been documented, the effect of nitrogen composition on the formation of VSCs is relatively unknown. This study investigated the role of <b>wine</b> <b>lees</b> quantity and composition on formation of VSCs as well as the impact of nitrogen concentration and composition. The role of elemental sulfur in the formation of VSCs during and after fermentation was also investigated. The impact of <b>wine</b> <b>lees</b> was investigated by fermenting Pinot noir grapes with either a common Pinot noir yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae RC 212, or a non-H₂S producing yeast S. cerevisiae P 1 Y 2. After fermentation was complete, wines were settled for 0, 24, or 96 hours, resulting in wines with high, medium, or low amounts of <b>lees.</b> <b>Wines</b> were sampled after 0, 14, 30, 60, 90, 180, and 270 days and assessed for VSCs by GC-PFPD and for free amino acids by HPLC-DAD. Glutathione was also assessed after 0 and 30 days by LC-MS/MS. Results showed an increase in methionine and cysteine between 14 and 30 days, which corresponded to an increase in H₂S at the same time. Concentrations of methionine and cysteine increased during aging and were influenced by yeast strain and level of <b>wine</b> <b>lees.</b> <b>Wines</b> produced using P 1 Y 2 contained higher concentrations of methionine and cysteine than wines produced by RC 212 at each level of <b>wine</b> lees; higher <b>lees</b> levels also resulted in higher amounts of cysteine and methionine. Increasing levels of methionine and cysteine did not necessarily result in increased amounts of VSCs in the wines. In general, the concentrations of VSCs in the wines were below sensory thresholds. Hydrogen sulfide decreased after the first 30 days of aging, but other VSCs such as methanethiol and dimethyl sulfide persisted at low levels. The influence of concentration and composition of yeast assimilable nitrogen (YAN) was also investigated. Fermentations were performed by either a high H₂S producing Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain (UCD 522) or a non-H₂S producing S. cerevisiae strain (P 1 Y 2). YAN was adjusted to high (346 mg/L) and low (112 mg/L) treatments containing mostly primary amino acids; a third treatment was prepared where the majority of the 346 mg/L YAN was derived from diammonium phosphate (DAP). Lead acetate tubes were used to monitor H₂S production during fermentation; wines were lead acetate tubes then assessed for additional VSCs by GC-PFPD. YAN concentration and composition affected H₂S production during fermentation. Treatments fermented by UCD 522 with high DAP had increased formation of H₂S late in fermentation and significantly more methyl thioacetate in the wine post-fermentation. In addition to YAN, the presence of elemental sulfur is also known to impact VSCs. Pinot noir was fermented with an addition of 0, 5, or 15 mg/g elemental sulfur. Fermentations were conducted by UCD 522 or P 1 Y 2 at 27 °C and H 2 S production was again measured using lead acetate tubes. Wines were assessed for additional VSC by GC-PFPD. Addition of elemental sulfur resulted in H₂S formation during the alcoholic fermentation even with non-H 2 S yeast. Elemental sulfur increased production of H₂S late in fermentation and resulted in wines that contained higher concentrations of methyl thioacetate post-fermentation. Wines were analyzed for elemental sulfur by HPLC-DAD; almost no elemental sulfur remained in the wines post-fermentation...|$|R

The use of phosphoric acid and sodium methabisulphate to achieve a partial control of marc fermentation had no effects using the Grappa system method.
