500|$|... "Stronger" [...] is a dance-pop and electropop {{song with}} {{a length of}} three minutes and 41 seconds. According to the sheet music {{published}} by Hal Leonard Corporation, it {{is set in a}} common time and has a moderately fast tempo of 116 beats per minute. Written in the key of A minor, it follows the chord progression Am–F–C-G/B. Clarkson's vocals span two octaves, from G3 to G5. The song begins with a [...] "rumbling guitar" [...] and a [...] "shimmering synth" [...] riff as Clarkson sings the opening line [...] "You know the bed feels warmer / Sleeping here alone." [...] Jason Lipshutz of Billboard noted that the guitar riff in the verses is reminiscent of Clarkson's [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] which narrates an anthem of personal reinvention, and dancing. The bridges contain pulsating beats with synth and electric guitar that display some elements of electronic sound. During chorus, the song explodes into an upbeat dance-pop number, complete with guitars and electronic drums as Clarkson sings [...] "What doesn't kill you makes you stronger / Stand a little taller / Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone." [...] Jonathan Keefe of Slant felt nobody else could sell the song's [...] "ginormous chorus" [...] better than Clarkson. Lyrically, [...] "Stronger" [...] explores the theme of moving on from an inimical relationship. In an interview, Clarkson remarked that the song doesn't refer to a specific person, stating [...] "I didn't have a bad breakup or anything, I just think <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> relationships so I always write all about these different ones going on in my life. And I don't have a filter, so it's pretty verbatim." [...] Jason Scott of Blogcritics felt that out of all tracks in Stronger, Clarkson's vocals are best and trendiest in [...] "What Doesn't Kill You (Stronger)".|$|E

2500|$|Fraud {{includes}} essays {{that are}} largely autobiographical and humorous. Rakoff stated, {{in relation to}} the theme of the book, [...] "The central drama of my <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> being a fraud, alas." [...] He went on to say [...] "That's a complete lie, really; the central drama of my <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> being lonely, and staying thin, but fraudulence gets a fair amount of play." [...] He has said that he thought of other titles for Fraud, like [...] "Smart mouth" [...] and [...] "The jig is up". Rakoff described the first-person essays that comprise the collection as more inwardly focused than his later work. The work contains material from public radio's This American Life and from Outside and Salon, which was significantly lengthened and re-written, as well as a few new pieces.|$|E

Hansis and Silbermann also spoke of this aspect regarding their own roles; they detailed what, if anything, they find useful in their lives when creating Luke and Noah. Hansis stated, [...] "Luke is all about the need to be loved and accepted. I think that need is universal. <b>Life</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> acceptance from the people who you want to love you. If that means family, a wife, a husband, a girlfriend/boyfriend, a best friend, you just want people to love you for who you are. Anyone can relate to that."

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Ryan Seacrest, Clarkson stated {{that she and her}} producers strove to record her voice in the album as it is heard at live performances, with as little auto-tune processing as possible, saying [...] "What separates this album are the vocals. They sound richer and fuller, and, for the first time, how I sound when I’m performing live. The producers I worked with just let me sing and be me." [...] Clarkson remarked that [...] "It was a lot of soulful stuff. You know what I'm saying? Like, Radiohead is alternative, but they're very soulful. And Sheryl Crow, very soulful singer-songwriter. So it's all very soulful, rhythmic pop rock." [...] Shortly after the final track listing was revealed, MTV observed that the word [...] "you" [...] featured prominently in the songs' titles. Clarkson asserted [...] "They're all different 'you's'. There's no common, like, it wasn't like one, I didn't have a bad breakup or anything, it wasn't like that.

2500|$|Westbrook's {{struggle}} with cocaine addiction {{has been widely}} documented in the British press and media. She has confessed that she first tried the drug {{at the age of}} 14, in a nightclub. After winning her role in EastEnders at the age of 16, Westbrook was a regular on the London club scene, and her cocaine usage escalated. She has commented [...] "I was always in clubs and everyone was doing coke and it was glamorous – except obviously, it wasn't at all. I was just very young, very stupid and very easily led...I think there should be someone at EastEnders to say to young people when they come in, 'Look, your <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> to change, you're going to be invited to things, and you'll be offered drugs.' Someone who can tell them what sort of people are about, and what sort of papers, and how quickly what you've worked for all those years can be gone." [...] It is estimated that she has spent over £250,000 on drugs, used 5g of cocaine every single day throughout her first pregnancy, and has admitted that during her lowest ebb she attempted suicide several times.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Late Night host David Letterman was {{preparing}} to leave, prompting executive producer Lorne Michaels {{to search for a}} new host. Michaels approached O'Brien to produce; then-agent Gavin Polone stressed that O'Brien wanted to perform, rather than produce. He arranged with Michaels that O'Brien would do a test audition on the stage of The Tonight Show. Jason Alexander and Mimi Rogers were the guests, and the audience was composed of Simpsons writers. Wolodarksky recalled the experience: [...] "Seeing this friend of yours, this guy that you worked with, walk out from behind that curtain and deliver a monologue was like something you could only dream up that you couldn’t ever imagine actually happening." [...] The performance was beamed by satellite to New York, where Lorne Michaels and NBC executives watched. O'Brien was picked as the new host of Late Night on April 26, 1993. As the writers headed to the voice record for [...] "Homer Goes to College", O'Brien {{received a phone call from}} Polone informing him of the decision. [...] "He was passed out facedown into this horrible shag carpet. He was just quiet and comatose down there on that carpet," [...] recalled postproduction supervisor Michael Mendel. [...] "I remember looking at him and saying, 'Wow. Your <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> to change, in a really dramatic way.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{must first}} learn to know himself before knowing {{anything}} else (γνῶθι σεαυτόν). Not until {{a man has}} inwardly understood himself and then sees the course he is to take does his life gain peace and meaning; only then is he free of that irksome, sinister traveling companion — that irony of life, which manifests itself {{in the sphere of}} knowledge and invites true knowing to begin with a not-knowing (Socrates) just as God created the world from nothing. But in the waters of morality it is especially at home to those who still have not entered the tradewinds of virtue. Here it tumbles a person about in a horrible way, for a time lets him feel happy and content in his resolve to go ahead along the right path, then hurls him into the abyss of despair. Often it lulls a man to sleep with the thought, [...] "After all, things cannot be otherwise," [...] only to awaken him suddenly to a rigorous interrogation. Frequently it seems to let a veil of forgetfulness fall over the past, only to make every single trifle appear in a strong light again. When he struggles along the right path, rejoicing in having overcome temptation's power, there may come at almost the same time, right on the heels of perfect victory, an apparently insignificant external circumstance which pushes him down, like Sisyphus, from the height of the crag. Often when a person has concentrated on something, a minor external circumstance arises which destroys everything. (As {{in the case of a}} man who, weary of <b>life,</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> to throw himself into the Thames and at the crucial moment is halted by the sting of a mosquito.) Frequently a person feels his very best when the illness is the worst, as in tuberculosis. In vain he tries to resist it but he has not sufficient strength, and it is no help to him that he has gone through the same thing many times; the kind of practice acquired in this way does not apply here.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, I {{will tell}} you, {{and you must}} {{understand}} if you can. You belong to a singular race. Every man is a suffering-machine and a happiness-machine combined. The two functions work together harmoniously, with a fine and delicate precision, on the give-and-take principle. For every happiness turned out in the one department the other stands ready to modify it with a sorrow or a pain--maybe a dozen. In most cases the man's <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> equally divided between happiness and unhappiness. When {{this is not the}} case the unhappiness predominates--always; never the other. Sometimes a man's make and disposition are such that his misery-machine is able to do nearly all the business. Such a man goes through life almost ignorant of what happiness is. Everything he touches, everything he does, brings a misfortune upon him. You have seen such people? To that kind of a person life is not an advantage, is it? It is only a disaster. Sometimes for an hour's happiness a man's machinery makes him pay years of misery. Don't you know that? It happens every now and then. I will give you a case or two presently. Now the people of your village are nothing to me--you know that, don't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Some solemn and {{superficial}} people (for {{nearly all}} very superficial people are solemn) have {{declared that the}} fairy-tales are immoral; they base this upon some accidental circumstances or regrettable incidents in the war between giants and boys, some {{cases in which the}} latter indulged in unsympathetic deceptions or even in practical jokes. The objection, however, is not only false, but very much the reverse of the facts. The fairy-tales are at root not only moral in the sense of being innocent, but moral in the sense of being didactic, moral in the sense of being moralising. It is all very well to talk of the freedom of fairyland, but there was precious little freedom in fairyland by the best official accounts. Mr. W.B. Yeats and other sensitive modern souls, feeling that modern <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> as black a slavery as ever oppressed mankind (they are right enough there), have especially described elfland as a place of utter ease and abandonment--a place where the soul can turn every way at will like the wind. Science denounces the idea of a capricious God; but Mr. Yeats's school suggests that in that world every one is a capricious god. Mr. Yeats himself has said a hundred times in that sad and splendid literary style which makes him the first of all poets now writing in English (I will not say of all English poets, for Irishmen are familiar with the practice of physical assault), he has, I say, called up a hundred times the picture of the terrible freedom of the fairies, who typify the ultimate anarchy of art-- ...|$|E
