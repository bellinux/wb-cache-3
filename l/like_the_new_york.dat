5|$|Born in 1889 in Cannes to Swiss-French parents, Noémi {{moved to}} New York in 1900, and later studied Fine Art and Philosophy at Columbia Teachers College. Here, she was {{influenced}} by the painter and educator Arthur Wesley Dow. During Raymond's period of training as a painter, Noémi supported them both by doing graphic work for publications <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> Sun and New York Herald Tribune. When they both moved to Taliesin she became interested in 3D design. She also polished her knowledge of Japanese crafts, becoming a broker for clients such as Rudolph Schindler's wife, Pauline Gibling.|$|E

5|$|From 1999–2001, Western {{media reports}} on Falun Gong—and in particular, the mistreatment of practitioners—were frequent, if mixed. By {{the latter half}} of 2001, however, the volume of media reports {{declined}} precipitously, and by 2002, coverage of Falun Gong by major news organizations <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> Times and Washington Post had almost completely ceased, particularly from within China. In a study of media discourse on Falun Gong, researcher Leeshai Lemish found that Western news organizations also became less balanced, and more likely to uncritically present the narratives of the Communist Party, rather than those of Falun Gong or human rights groups.|$|E

5|$|A further £8,000, {{raised with}} the help of the society's members, was set aside for the {{construction}} and stocking of the park. Initially the zoo occupied only the southernmost , while the land to the north was used as a golf course. The park was designed by town planner Patrick Geddes and his son-in-law Frank Mears. Following Gillespie's vision, they modeled the park after the open designs of zoos <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> Zoological Park and Hagenbeck's zoo in Hamburg. These modern zoological parks promoted a more spacious and natural environment for the animals, and stood in stark contrast to the steel cages typical of the menageries built during the Victorian era. The Scottish National Zoological Park, as it was initially called, opened to the public with a large collection of donated and borrowed animals on 22 July 1913, after only 15 weeks of work. The zoo still occupies very much the same area of land today, though the park is being extensively redeveloped.|$|E

25|$|In 1898, Herbert {{became the}} {{principal}} {{conductor of the}} Pittsburgh Symphony, a position he held until 1904. Under his leadership, the orchestra became a major American ensemble and was favorably compared by music critics with ensembles <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> Philharmonic and Boston Symphony Orchestra. The orchestra toured to several major cities during Herbert's years as conductor, notably premiering Herbert's Auditorium Festival March for {{the celebration of the}} twelfth anniversary of Chicago's Auditorium Theatre in 1901. After a disagreement with the management of the Pittsburgh Symphony in 1904, Herbert resigned, founding the Victor Herbert Orchestra. He conducted their programs of light orchestral music paired with more serious repertoire (as he had done earlier with Anton Seidl's Brighton Beach orchestra concerts) at summer resorts and on tours for most of his remaining years. His orchestra made many acoustical recordings for both Edison Records, from 1909 to 1911, and the Victor Talking Machine Company, from 1911 to 1923. Herbert was also a cello soloist in several Victor recordings as well.|$|E

500|$|The term [...] "new style" [...] {{was created}} by dancers outside of the United States. According to Moncell Durden, adjunct {{professor}} at Drexel University {{and director of the}} film History and Concept of Hip-Hop Dance, the 1992 dance documentary Wreckin' Shop From Brooklyn was very influential to hip-hop dancers in France and Japan. These dancers wanted to move <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> hip-hop dancers who were profiled in the documentary. They called the social dancing (party dancing) they saw [...] "new style" [...] which was short for [...] "New York Style".|$|E
500|$|Numerous {{layers of}} metaphors are present {{throughout}} The Downward Spiral, leaving it open to wide interpretation. The album relays nihilism and {{is defined by}} a prominent theme of self-abuse and self-control. It is a semi-autobiographical concept album, in which the overarching plot follows the protagonist's descent into madness in his own inner solipsistic world through a metaphorical [...] "downward spiral", dealing with religion, dehumanization, violence, disease, society, drugs, sex, and finally, suicide. Reznor described the concept as consisting of [...] "someone who sheds everything around them to a potential nothingness, but through career, religion, relationship, belief and so on." [...] Media journalists <b>like</b> <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> Times writer Jon Pareles noted the album's theme of angst had already been used by grunge bands like Nirvana, and that Nine Inch Nails' depiction was more generalized.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} the game was first {{conceived}} as the production team thought that endless runner games were popular but were always too similar. To create an endless runner that would differentiate itself from others in the genre, the staff focused on Spider-Man's main powers, which originally led to a swinger-only game. However, they found it [...] "a bit boring", and it was complicated to have boss fights and to add new systems and gameplay styles. Then they reconceptualized the game as a runner with elements of swinging, fighting, wall-climbing, and free-falling. The storyline of the game was created {{to focus on the}} Sinister Six and the multiple versions of Spider-Man. Gameloft was allowed to explore other stories such as the Spider-Verse, but they were required to consult with Marvel to decide which were to be featured. The product manager, Tatiana Nahai, was the responsible for choosing among the options and she discusses the ideas with the narrative designer. After the narrative designer creates the main plotline and dialogues, they consult Marvel writer Fred Van Lente for feedback. The same process of having Marvel feedback occurs for the addition of new characters and environments. Environments were created by the level design team, which was responsible for deciding which obstacles or types of boss attacks fit best, based on how distinct they would be from other levels. As new updates were released, new environments <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> Highline, 2099 New York and snowy New York were added.|$|E
