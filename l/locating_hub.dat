In this study, we focus on cargo applications of the hub location problem. Through observations from the Turkish cargo sector, we propose a new mathematical model for the hub location problem that relaxes the complete hub network assumption. Our model minimizes the cost of establishing hubs and hub links, while designing a network that services each origin-destination pair within a time bound. We formulate a single-allocation hub covering model that permits visiting at most three hubs on a route.

The complex problem is formulated as a simple variant of the classical network design model by judiciously redefining commodity-flows. Exploiting the special structure of the problem, a dual-based heuristic is then developed which yields near-optimal design plans.

40|$|Abstract: The hub {{location}} {{problem is}} concerned with <b>locating</b> <b>hub</b> facilities and allocating demand nodes to hubs in order to route the traffic between origin-destination pairs efficiently. In this paper, we propose a bi-objective mathematical model by introducing the objective of minimizing the maximum waiting time on the hubs along with the traditional cost minimizing objective function. Both the waiting time and cost functions are treated in a fuzzy environment considering the fuzzy flows and service rates. Two different fuzzy programming models are provided for this problem according to different criteria. For solving the proposed fuzzy models, some hybrid intelligent algorithms are designed by embedding fuzzy simulations into a simulated annealing algorithm. Finally, the numerical results are reported. Key words: Hub location problem • fuzzy programming • fuzzy simulation • queuing • simulated annealin...|$|E

Our experimentation shows that general variable neighborhood search based heuristics outperform the best-known heuristics in terms of solution quality and computational effort.

This is followed by an allocation phase using a reduced sized formulation which returns the optimal solution. In order to get a good upper bound for the branch and bound we developed a heuristic for the single allocation p-hub center problem based on an ant colony optimization approach. Numerical results on benchmark instances show that the new solution approach is superior over traditional MIP-solver like CPLEX.

Four special cases of the general hub arc location model are examined in detail. We provide motivation for the new models, and present examples and optimal solutions, using data for U.

The results reveal interesting spatial patterns and help identify promising cities and regions for hubs.

40|$|Within {{the context}} of the Logistics and supply chain and management, the Hybrid Hub and Spoke system has certain {{complexities}} regarding the selection of the hub location in the supply chain facility system. The performance and efficiency of the network route selection and hub location depends upon the percentage savings that has been made by choosing the appropriate location for the hub to maintain the efficient flow of the goods within the network. Hub location selection mostly depends on the profit margins shared by the carrier, supply and demand status of the facility and amount of flow of the goods through the facilities. This research develops a mathematical model using Centralized Carrier Collaborative and Multi-Hub Location Problem. The model encompasses various cost like costs of transportation for Direct Transport and Collaborative Transport, cost related to loading, unloading and operations, holding costs and maintenance cost, these are incorporated in taking decision for <b>locating</b> <b>hub</b> within a set of nodes/facilities. A Genetic algorithm meta-heuristic is used to solve the large size problems. The solution obtained using this meta-heuristics are compared with solution obtained from using Lagrangian Relaxation approach.

40|$|Hub-and-spoke {{designs are}} {{frequently}} {{used in many}} types of transportation and communication networks. The challenge to academics is to develop effective solution procedures for determining the number of hubs, <b>locating</b> <b>hub</b> facilities and allocating the non-hubs to the hubs. In this note, {{we deal with the}} capacitated single allocation hub location problem (CSAHLP) in which each non-hub can only be allocated to a single hub, each hub has its capacity constraint, and the objective function includes fixed costs for establishing hubs. A problem closely related to the CSAHLP is the uncapacitated single allocation hub location problem (USAHLP). We have proposed a hybrid heuristic for solving the USAHLP with competitive results obtained. In this note, an effective procedure to allocate the non-hubs to the capacitated hubs is developed to be embedded in the previous hybrid heuristic to solve the CSAHLP. Computational results show the presented heuristic is capable of obtaining optimal solutions for almost all small-scale problems and outperforms a simulated annealing algorithm from the literature in solving the large-scale CSAHLP. It is expected that this note can provide distribution managers an effective heuristic to design hub-and-spoke networks where the volume of traffic that a hub can collect is restricted. capacitated hub location problem; CHLP; p-hub median problem; uncapacitated hub location problem; UHLP; hub-and-spoke design; hub allocation. ...|$|E

Furthermore, logistics costs are calculated for each single chain composed of transportation, inventory and other logistics costs. The construction of transport chains thus follows the approach of minimizing total costs [9, 26].|$|R
