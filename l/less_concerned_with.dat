5|$|Rodin was a naturalist, <b>less</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> monumental {{expression}} {{than with}} character and emotion. Departing with centuries of tradition, {{he turned away}} from the idealism of the Greeks, and the decorative beauty of the Baroque and neo-Baroque movements. His sculpture emphasized the individual and the concreteness of flesh, and suggested emotion through detailed, textured surfaces, and the interplay of light and shadow. To a greater degree than his contemporaries, Rodin believed that an individual's character was revealed by his physical features.|$|E

5|$|Arrangers called gamemasters (GMs) {{determine}} {{the rules and}} setting of a LARP, and may also influence an event and act as referees while it is taking place. The GMs may also do the logistical work, or {{there may be other}} arrangers who handle details such as advertising the event, booking a venue, and financial management. Unlike the GM in a tabletop role-playing game, a LARP GM seldom has an overview of everything that is happening during play because numerous participants may be interacting at once. For this reason, a LARP GM's role is often <b>less</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> tightly maintaining a narrative or directly entertaining the players, and more with arranging the structure of the LARP before play begins and facilitating the players and crew to maintain the fictional environment during play.|$|E
5|$|Cochrane {{establishes}} {{the book as}} a work of normative political theory asking to what extent animals {{should be included in the}} domain of justice. States can and do regulate human-animal relationships, whether the animals in question are used in agriculture, as companions, or in some other way. Cochrane's focus is not on why laws are passed or on comparing laws, but in exploring what kind of laws should be passed. As his focus is on political theory, he is <b>less</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> questions about individual moral obligations than he is with institutional arrangements. He notes, however, that questions about animals have been neglected in political theory. In the second chapter, Cochrane considers the history of thinking on the relationship between justice and animals. He argues that within ancient philosophy there was disagreement about the inclusion of animals within accounts of justice, in medieval Christian philosophy there was a consensus that they should be excluded, and in modern philosophy there has been a return to disagreement.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{aggressive}} tactics of Haywood and the IWW, {{along with their}} call for abolition of the wage system and the overthrow of capitalism created tension with moderate electorally-oriented leaders of the Socialist Party. Haywood and the IWW focused on direct action and strikes, which often led to violence, and were <b>less</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> political tactics. When Haywood was quoted speaking at public meetings in New York City {{to the effect that}} he had never advocated the use of the ballot by the workers but had instead favored the tactics of direct action, an initiative recalling Haywood from the NEC was launched by the State Executive Committee of the Socialist Party of New York. In February 1913 the recall of Haywood was approved by a margin of more than 2-to-1. Following his defeat, Haywood left the ranks of the Socialist Party, joined by thousands of other IWW members and their sympathizers.|$|E
25|$|Lack of {{sanitation}} {{refers to}} the absence of sanitation. In practical terms it usually means lack of toilets or lack of hygienic toilets that anybody would want to use voluntarily.

5|$|Over {{the month}} of July, the Autodromo Nazionale Monza race track's main {{straight}} was straightened and the Variante Goodyear and Seconda Variante chicanes were reconfigured by the race organisers to become a series of narrower corners with the exit away from the entry of turn one. The run-off areas around the two sections of the circuit were enlargened. Some of the drivers, however, were unhappy with the modifications, though, as there were fears of a multi-car accident on the first lap. Coulthard claimed that the new corner would make braking more difficult and was concerned over the amount of penalties issued to other competitors. However, Michael Schumacher believed his and other teams would be <b>less</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> suspension damage. Jean Alesi {{who was the first}} driver to test the new circuit, said that it would be easier for drivers to pull off the track {{in the event of a}} technical issue.|$|E
5|$|The Liber {{is one of}} {{a number}} of monastic {{histories}} written during the middle and later 12th century, when a number of monasteries in northern and southern England produced works devoted to recording the histories of their religious houses and local areas. In the south, these included the Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis of Abingdon Abbey, the Chronicon Abbatiae Rameseiensis of Ramsey Abbey, the Chronicon Angliae Petriburgense of Peterborough Abbey, a history of the see of Bath and Wells, and the Chronicon Monasterii de Bello of Battle Abbey. The northern histories record the foundation stories of the various Cistercian houses in the north, along with other information relating to those houses. Those from the south, including the Liber Eliensis, mainly concern themselves with the various controversies involving their respective religious houses. The northern histories are <b>less</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> controversy, and overall are more prone to hagiography.|$|E
5|$|This revival did {{not last}} long. Following the death of Charles of Anjou in 1285 {{and the end of}} the threat of an {{invasion}} from Italy, Michael's successor Andronikos II Palaiologos (1282–1328) assumed that, by relying on the naval strength of his Genoese allies, he could do without the maintenance of a fleet, whose particularly heavy expenditure the increasingly cash-strapped treasury could no longer afford. At the same time, Andronikos was <b>less</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> the West and more with affairs in Asia Minor and his—eventually futile—attempt to stop the Turkish advance there, a policy where the fleet lacked a role. Consequently, the entire fleet was disbanded, its crews dismissed and the ships broken up or left to rot. The results were quick to follow: during Andronikos' long reign, the Turks gradually took permanent possession of the Aegean coasts of Anatolia, with the Empire unable to reverse the situation, while the Venetian fleet was able to attack Constantinople and raid its suburbs at will during the 1296–1302 war.|$|E
30|$|Accounting {{conservatism}} is the timeliness of loss {{recognition and}} profit recognition, {{which is more}} important for creditors. Zhu and Li (2008) and Chen et al. (2010 a) provide evidence that state-owned companies adopt less conservative accounting methods than non-state-owned ones due to <b>less</b> <b>concern</b> <b>with</b> downside risk for state-owned companies and state-owned banks demanding less conservative accounting information. Mao and Dai (2009) provide evidence that the adoption of fair value accounting could decrease accounting conservatism and leave more space for earnings manipulation and literature shows accounting conservatism appears as a U-shaped curve in {{the life cycle of}} enterprises.|$|R
50|$|In 1964, Eugene Nida {{described}} translation {{as having}} {{two different types}} of equivalence: formal and dynamic equivalence. Formal equivalence is when there is focus on the message itself, in both form and content. The message in the target language should match the message in the source language as closely as possible. In contrast, there is <b>less</b> <b>concern</b> <b>with</b> matching the message in the target language with the message in the source language in dynamic equivalence. The goal is, however, to produce the same relationship between target text and target audience, as there was with the original source text and its audience.|$|R
50|$|Many environmentalists {{believe that}} human {{interference}} with 'nature' should be restricted or minimised {{as a matter}} of urgency (for the sake of life, or the planet, or just {{for the benefit of the}} human species), whereas environmental skeptics and anti-environmentalists do not believe that there is such a need. One can also regard oneself as an environmentalist and believe that human 'interference' with 'nature' should be increased. Nevertheless, there is a risk that the shift from emotional environmentalism into the technical management of natural resources and hazards could decrease the touch of humans with nature, leading to <b>less</b> <b>concern</b> <b>with</b> environment preservation.|$|R
5|$|While {{walking in}} the woods, Andrei and Foma have a {{conversation}} about Foma’s faults, especially lying. Foma confesses to taking honey from the bee garden, after Andrei notices his cassock is tacky, and smears mud on his face to soothe a bee sting. While Foma has talent as an artist, he is <b>less</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> the deeper meaning of his work and more concerned with practical aspects of the job, like perfecting his azure, a colour which in painting was often considered unstable to mix. They encounter Theophanes in the forest, and the old master sends Foma away. As he leaves, the apprentice finds a dead swan and pokes at it with a stick. We cut to banks of a stream where Andrei and Theophanes are arguing about religion, while Foma cleans his master's paint brushes. Theophanes argues that the ignorance of the Russian people is due to stupidity, while Andrei says that he doesn’t understand how {{he can be a}} painter and maintain such views. This section contains a reenactment of Christ's Crucifixion on a snow-covered hillside which plays out as Andrei recounts the story and expresses his belief that the men who crucified Jesus were obeying God's will and loved him.|$|E

The members completed measures assessing perceptions of their own physical health, mental health, and appearance. Demographic information, including preferred club resources and body measurements, was also provided. Results indicated that long-term members, over five years, had greater satisfaction with their bodies and fewer health problems. In addition, members with lower Body Mass Index (BMI) scores showed more <b>concern</b> <b>with</b> their appearance and health, <b>less</b> <b>concern</b> <b>with</b> weight preoccupation, and had smaller discrepancies between actual and ideal body images. It was also found that club resources were a factor in maintaining long-term memberships.

30|$|China is {{typically}} {{regarded as a}} collectivistic culture, in which obligations to the greater society and social institutions (e.g., the family) are considered more important than individual traits and needs (Kwang 2001; Ting-Toomey et al. 1991). Within individualistic cultures, romantic love is regarded as essential to marital satisfaction and well-being (Dion and Dion 1988). Hence, individual choice within dating relationships and mate selection processes {{is more likely to}} occur within individualistic cultures. Collectivistic cultures prompt young adults to regard love and romantic relationships within the larger context of their familial and societal obligations (Yang 1968). This, then, may lead young adults within collectivistic cultures to emphasize the pragmatic functions of dating and eventual marriage, while having <b>less</b> <b>concern</b> <b>with</b> notions of “love” and “romance” (Hsu 1981).|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The paper {{seeks to}} {{determine}} the effect of exchange rate changes on consumer prices in Nigeria using recursive vector autoregression (VAR) model. It uses data from first quarter 2000 to fourth quarter 2013. The results of the investigation show that exchange rate fluctuation has a positive and insignificant effect on consumer prices and the increase in consumer prices are mainly due to its own shocks and the increase in money supply in the long run. A stable monetary policy with a low inflationary environment will lessen the pressure of exchange rate changes on consumer prices. So, the Central Bank of Nigeria should be <b>less</b> <b>concern</b> <b>with</b> the inflation impact of exchange rate shocks and focus fully on other objectives such as growth and export competitiveness in designing exchange rate policy...|$|R

5000|$|ICT4D 2.0: late-2000s onwards. There is {{no clear}} {{boundary}} between phases 1.0 and 2.0. The focus in the phase 2.0 increasingly shifts toward technologies in use, such as the mobile phone and SMS technologies. There is <b>less</b> <b>concern</b> <b>with</b> e-readiness and more interest in the impact of ICTs on development. Additionally, there is more focus on the poor as producers and innovators with ICTs (as opposed to being consumers of ICT-based information). ICT4D 2.0 is about reframing the poor. Where ICT4D 1.0 marginalised them, allowing a supply-driven focus, ICT4D 2.0 centralises them, creating a demand-driven focus. Where ICT4D 1.0 -- fortified by the [...] "bottom of the pyramid" [...] concept -- characterized them largely as passive consumers, ICT4D 2.0 sees the poor as active producers and active innovators.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} public perceived risk on various issues in present-day China. Two surveys were conducted in urban China in 1996 and 1998. In the first survey, risk perceptions of different occupational groups are compared. Gender differences within each occupational group are also analyzed. In the second survey, participants with diverse employment status were recruited. The overall risk rankings of both surveys indicate great <b>concern</b> <b>with</b> risks that threaten national stability and economic development, and <b>less</b> <b>concern</b> <b>with</b> high-technology risk such as threat from a nuclear power plant. It is also found that employees from high-profit firms are more concerned about macroscopic catastrophic risks, whereas laid-off workers and employees from money-losing enterprises are more concerned about daily life or self-concerned risks. The importance of actual exposure to risk, mass media coverage, culture, and psychometric dimensions are discussed.

40|$|The study aims to {{understand}} the use and relative importance of sustainability indicators based on the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines, through case studies in two expressive Brazilian electrical power supply companies. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews and questionnaires. The results show that both companies have used the majority of GRI indicators and their managers have identified all the three dimensions – economic, social and environmental – as important, although the degrees of importance are different between the two companies, possibly due to the diverse sustainability management maturity and different scope in their operations along the value chain. Therefore Company 1, which works on generation, transmission and distribution of electrical energy, has shown higher maturity on sustainability management and presents a more balanced indicators system among the three dimensions, while Company 2, which operates in transmission and distribution, shows <b>less</b> <b>concern</b> <b>with</b> environmental indicators...|$|R
