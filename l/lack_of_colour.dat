25|$|Given the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>colour</b> {{contrast}} in the monochromatic aizuri-e, late Edo artists began {{to experiment with}} techniques to increase image complexity. This {{led to the development}} of bokashi, a printing technique which allowed for the reproduction and mixing of differing colour tones within a single image. This is achieved through carefully graded applications of water and pigment mixtures to the woodblock with a hake brush. The result is a single-coloured print characterised by shading and tonality. It was practiced most effectively in the rendering of skies and water. While aizuri-e themselves were inexpensive to print, bokashi was costly. It is therefore generally seen in formal prints, and not regularly seen in cheaper media such as uchiwa-e. Kunisada has, however, used the technique on this fan print, most notably in the cloud and ground regions, where the value of the blue pigment deepens from very pale blue to near-black opacity.|$|E
500|$|In 1901, as Lear explains, a Potter {{family friend}} and {{sometime}} poet, Canon Hardwicke Rawnsley, set Potter's tale into [...] "rather dreadful didactic verse and submitted it, along with Potter's illustrations and half her revised manuscript, to Frederick Warne & Co.," [...] {{who had been}} among the original rejecters. Warne editors declined Rawnsley's version [...] "but asked to see the complete Potter manuscript" [...] – their interest stimulated by the opportunity The Tale of Peter Rabbit offered the publisher {{to compete with the}} success of Helen Bannerman's wildly popular Little Black Sambo and other small-format children's books then on the market. When Warne inquired about the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>colour</b> illustrations in the book, Potter replied that rabbit-brown and green were not good subjects for colouration. Warne declined the book but left open the possibility of future publication.|$|E

500|$|... "From a View to a Kill" [...] was {{initially}} {{intended to be}} the backstory for Hugo Drax, the villain of the novel Moonraker. The story would have taken place during World War II, and featured Drax as the motorcycle assassin who crashes his bike and is taken to an American field hospital. Later, the hospital is bombed, leaving Drax with amnesia and a disfigured face. The story was one that Fleming had drawn up for the television series. The SHAPE head of security, Colonel Schreiber, {{was designed to be}} the antithesis of Bond, with greying hair, the air of a bank manager, desk with silver framed photographs of his family and a single white rose; the description shows Fleming using colour to show Schreiber's <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>colour</b> and personality. The idea of the underground hideout was inspired by Fleming's brother Peter's band of Auxiliary Units who dug tunnel networks in Britain in 1940 as part of a resistance movement in advance of a German invasion. The original name for the story was [...] "The Rough with the Smooth", which was also the original title of the books, before For Your Eyes Only was chosen for publication.|$|E
2500|$|The Green Room {{was shot}} in the fall of 1977 in Honfleur, France with a budget of 3 million francs {{provided}} by United Artists. That summer, Truffaut scouted locations and hired his longtime collaborator, Néstor Almendros, as cinematographer. To give the film a Gothic look, Almendros used candle light as both source and practical lighting, with electrical lights used to [...] "exploit the contrast between electric light and a flood of candlelight to give the film a ghostly quality." [...] Truffaut also intended a resulting <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>colour</b> throughout filming, condemning colour as a removal of the final [...] "barrier" [...] between film and reality: [...] "If there is nothing false in a film, then it is not a film." [...] Almendros later said that, despite the film's somber tone, [...] "this film was put together with joy, and the shooting was the most pleasant" [...] of his career. Many of the scenes were shot in the four-story Maison Troublet in Honfleur. This house and its grounds included sets for many of the film's main locations: Davenne's house, his office at The Globe and the auction room.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, there is an {{increasing}} emphasis, from the food industry of the industrialized world, to obtain and market new, non toxic, colorants of plant origin, owing to a restrictive legislation which bans the use of toxic synthetic colorants. Among the natural pigments, the anthocyanins are molecules capable of displaying a large range <b>of</b> <b>colours,</b> from blue to red and even white, unlike the two other families of vegetable pigments, the chlorophylls and the carotenoids, which exhibit only the colours green and orange, respectively. Although anthocyanins are easily available from most flowers and fruits, its use by the food industry is hampered by a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>colours</b> stability in aqueous solution. In this work, after characterization of the several anthocyanin forms existing in acidic aqueous solutions, both {{in the ground and}} excited states, are studied the mechanism and kinetics of the thermal and photochemical colour loss reactions.

60|$|Calling for my greatcoat, {{and paying}} no heed to the jeers {{of the company}} for leaving before the toasts and the play, I fairly ran to Arlington Street. I was in a passion of remorse. Comyn had been but just. Granting, indeed, that she had refused to marry me, was that any reason why I should desert my life-long friend and playmate?

60|$|He {{remembered how}} {{he lay there}} in the grass, wet-cheeked but no longer sobbing, {{listening}} to the sound and wondering {{that he had been}} able to hear it on the beach of Ringmanu. Some freak of air pressures and air currents, he reflected, had made it possible for the sound to carry so far. Such conditions might not happen again in a thousand days or ten thousand days, but the one day it had happened had been the day he landed from the Nari for several hours' collecting. Especially had he been in quest of the famed jungle butterfly, a foot across from wing-tip to wing-tip, as velvet-dusky of <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>colour</b> as was the gloom of the roof, of such lofty arboreal habits that it resorted only to the jungle roof and could be brought down only by a dose of shot.

60|$|Helen {{looked at}} her. Her face was weak rather than decided, saved from insipidity {{by the large}} enquiring eyes; denied beauty, {{now that she was}} {{sheltered}} indoors, by the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>colour</b> and definite outline. Moreover, a hesitation in speaking, or rather a tendency to use the wrong words, made her seem more than normally incompetent for her years. Mrs. Ambrose, who had been speaking much at random, now reflected that she certainly did not look forward to the intimacy of three or four weeks on board ship which was threatened. Women of her own age usually boring her, she supposed that girls would be worse. She glanced at Rachel again. Yes! how clear it was that she would be vacillating, emotional, and when you said something to her it would make no more lasting impression than the stroke of a stick upon water. There was nothing to take hold of in girls--nothing hard, permanent, satisfactory. Did Willoughby say three weeks, or did he say four? She tried to remember.|$|E

60|$|As {{he spoke}} a tall, gaunt man appeared, {{advancing}} towards them. His gait was a shambling trot that seemed slow, although, in truth, he was covering {{the ground with}} extraordinary swiftness. Moreover, he moved so silently that even on the frost-held soil his step could not be heard, and so carefully that not a reed stirred as he threaded in and out among their clumps like an otter, his head crouched down and his long bow pointed before him {{as though it were}} a spear. Half a minute more, and he was before them--a very strange man to see. His years were not so many, thirty perhaps, and yet his face looked quite old because <b>of</b> its <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>colouring,</b> its thinness, and the hard lines that marked where the muscles ran down to the tight, straight mouth and up to the big forehead, over which hung hair so light that at a little distance he seemed ashen-grey. Only in this cold, rocky face, set very far apart, were two pale-blue eyes, which just now, when he chose to lift their lids that generally kept near together, as though he were half asleep, were full of fire and quick cunning.|$|R

Nonetheless, some colours problems presented in the casuistry are not solved yet such as dark and light camouflage. Then, in order to solve this problems a new cue —edge cue — is proposed. Finally, our approach which fuses colour, intensity and edge cues is presented, thereby obtaining accurate motion segmentation in both indoor and outdoor scenes...|$|R
5|$|In Australia, {{the adults}} may be {{confused}} with large native frogs from the genera Limnodynastes, Cyclorana, and Mixophyes.

40|$|I want {{to begin}} by thanking the editors of this special issue for the {{opportunity}} to reflect critically upon my contributions to research in the arena of media and minority representation. I came to this field when I was a television news pro-ducer. I was struck by the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> journalists <b>of</b> <b>colour</b> {{on the floor of the}} news-room and puzzled by the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> critical and nuanced attention given to stories related to race. This led me to complete a review of the literature on media and minority relations when I became a postdoctoral fellow. I made recommendations for future research in this area, based on interviews I conducted with journalists, communication scholars, and leaders of not-for-profits. It has been particularly gratifying for me to see that this piece has proven valuable to other scholars who are now conducting research on this topic. I was asked to do a follow-up piece on research on immigration and media in Canada (Mahtani, 2008). More recently, my research is exploring diversity—and the complicit and complicated use of this term in newsrooms.
