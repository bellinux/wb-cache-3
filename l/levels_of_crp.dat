40|$|Objective: {{to study}} the {{association}} <b>of</b> C-reactive protein (<b>CRP)</b> with cytokines in polytrauma. Subjects and methods. Eighty-four victims with severe concomitant injury were examined. Twenty-five (29. 7 %) patients developed sepsis, death being observed in 83. 3 %. CRP was daily determined in the sera of the victims, by using CRP latex test kits (HUMATEX, Germany). On days 1, 3, 7, 10, and 15 after injury, serum and lymphocytic culture IL- 2, IL- 4, TNF-a, IFN-y, and HLA-DR were studied on an automatic Elx 800 Universal Microplate Reader enzyme immunoassay analyzer (BIO-TEK INSTRUMENTS, Inc., USA), by applying enzyme immunoassay systems (OOO «Cytokine», Saint Petersburg, Russia). Results. No complications were observed with a <b>CRP</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> 40 mg/l on day 1 and its further reduction. The <b>CRP</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> 40 mg/l on day 1 (without use of glucocorticoids) and its prolonged increase were determined in visceral inflammatory and infectious complications. The <b>CRP</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> 120 mg/l within the first 7 days was noted in subsequently developed sepsis. Glucocorticoids and specific immune drugs resulted in a reduction or complete disappearance <b>of</b> <b>CRP.</b> When the latter were discontinued, CRP appeared in the quantity reflecting the effect of treatment. In the absence of multiple organ dysfunctions, the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>CRP</b> decreased as the infectious process diminished. The low <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>CRP</b> and the activation of an infectious process suggest the areactivity of an organism. With the <b>CRP</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> 40 mg/l, the spontaneous production and <b>level</b> <b>of</b> blood IL- 4 increased less significantly, whereas those of IFN-y rose more substantially; the induced activity of TNF-a also more drastically decreased (by 10 times versus 2. 2) with a <b>CRP</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> 40 mg/l.

40|$|Abstract: Urticaria {{is a kind}} of {{skin rash}} that {{sometimes}} caused by allergic reactions. Acute viral infection, stress, pressure, exercise and sunlight are some other causes of urticaria. However, chronic urticaria and angioedema could be either idiopathic or caused by autoimmune reaction. They last more than six weeks and could even persist for a very long time. It is thought that the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> C-reactive protein <b>CRP</b> increases and the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) decreases in patients with chronic urticaria. Thirty four patients with chronic or recurrent urticaria were selected for the treatment with wet cupping. Six of them, because of having a history of recent infection/cold urticaria, were eliminated and the remaining 28 were chosen for this study. ESR and CRP were measured in these patients aged 21 - 59, comprising 12 females and 16 males, ranged from 5 - 24 mm/h for ESR with a median 11 mm/h and 3. 3 - 31. 2 mg/L with a median of 11. 95 mg/L for CRP before and after phlebotomy (250 - 450 mL) which was performed as a control for wet cupping therapy. Three weeks after phlebotomy, wet cupping was performed on the back of these patients between two shoulders and the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> ESR and <b>CRP</b> were measured again three weeks after wet cupping.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is {{associated}} with evidence of systemic oxidative stress, activation of circulating inflammatory cells and increased plasma <b>level</b> <b>of</b> proinflamatory cytokines which include C-reactive protein (CRP). CRP is one biomarker of extrapulmonary or systemic consequences of COPD that can be detected. AIM: The aim {{of this research is}} to determine whether the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>CRP</b> statistically significantly correlates with the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> bronchial obstruction and the accompanying co-morbidities in patients with COPD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study included 80 patients with exacerbation of COPD, hospitalised at the Institute for Lung Diseases and Tuberculosis in Skopje. We measured the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>CRP</b> in the blood in all of these patients in fasting conditions. The classification of COPD patients by the severity of airflow limitation was made according to the actual version of the Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD). The Student’s Independent Samples t-test was used for the statistic analysis of the data. RESULTS: In 52 (65 %) of the patients with exacerbation of COPD we detected an increase of the mean value <b>of</b> <b>CRP.</b> The statistical analysis using the Student’s t-test showed statistically significant differences in the mean value <b>of</b> <b>CRP</b> in patients with different <b>level</b> <b>of</b> bronchial obstruction.

On the other hand, increased <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>CRP</b> has been seen in atherosclerosis. According to this finding, we decided to conduct this study to assess the relationship between CRP and complex lesions of coronary arteries in patients with unstable angina. METHODS: In this analytical cross sectional study which was conducted in 2007 in Chamran hospital, samples were collected using simple sampling and included 80 patients who referred to the hospital due to angina pectoris, had the diagnosis of unstable angina and were candidates of angiography. At first, a questionnaire was filled for each patient including demographic factors and their medical history. Then a blood sample was taken to assess <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>CRP,</b> FBS, and lipid profiles. The results of angiographic studies were considered by three cardiologists and abnormal patients were classified into simple and complex groups according to Ambrose criteria. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 15, t-student and chi-square tests. RESULTS: Mean age of samples was 58. 27 ± 6. 23 years old. Considering the risk factors, most simple and complex lesions happened in obese patients however the only significant difference was observed in BMI between two groups (P < 0. 05). Mean <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>CRP</b> in the population under study was 6. 05 ± 4 mg/dl which was 1. 37 ± 2 and 8. 01 ± 6 in simple and complex groups respectively (P < 0. 05).

CONCLUSION: According to our findings, there is a significant difference considering CRP level in unstable angina patients who have complex lesions compared with simples ones.
