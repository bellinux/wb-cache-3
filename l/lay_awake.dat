60|$|That night Kramer lay in bed, tossing {{from side}} to side, unable to sleep. The moon gravity, even artificially increased, was {{unfamiliar}} to him and it made him uncomfortable. A thousand thoughts wandered loose in {{his head as he}} <b>lay,</b> fully <b>awake.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The episode {{opened up}} to {{universal}} acclaim with the television critics lauding the writing and performance of the entire cast as well. The performances of guest stars Mandy Moore and Michael O'Neill along with Ellen Pompeo, Sandra Oh, Chandra Wilson, Kevin McKidd, James Pickens, Jr. and Sarah Drew garnered most praise.

Some of the back-and-forths between the characters were truly memorable, and some of the developments so heartbreaking that we don't even know where to begin now. Seriously, the Season 6 finale left us <b>laying</b> <b>awake</b> afterward thinking about everything, a feeling we haven't had from Grey's in years and rarely achieved by any program." ...|$|R
