5|$|It soon {{becomes clear}} that MacPherson is being poisoned. Nikola {{believes}} that Brandt is responsible, because of his recent disappearances, but is proven wrong. After MacPherson dies, Sarah Walker takes his place as commander of Strike Force Centauri. Walker sends Nikola, disguised as a pirate, on an espionage mission to discover the traitor's identity. Nikola finds information that incriminates Ashford, who, when confronted, boasts of his actions and <b>leaps</b> <b>to</b> his death from a docking bay. The squad continues the war, and the Hegemony is eventually forced to gather its remaining forces at a base on Thatcher. The squad destroys the facility by detonating a highly explosive fuel tank inside it. Following its defeat, the Hegemony denies involvement in the war, declares Pentheus a rogue agent and appoints a new ambassador to the system. While angered by the announcement, Strike Force Centauri celebrates its victory as the game ends.|$|E
5|$|Batman {{returns to}} the botanical gardens and defeats Ivy, halting the rampaging plants. The Joker announces that the {{preparations}} for his party are finally complete and Batman travels to the asylum's visitor center where the Joker's applauding henchmen welcome him. The Joker reveals he has recaptured Gordon and tries to shoot him with a Titan-filled dart; Batman <b>leaps</b> <b>to</b> Gordon's defense and is shot instead. Batman attempts to resist the change, and an upset Joker takes an overdose of Titan, mutating into a massive monster. In a makeshift arena on the building's roof, the Joker challenges Batman to a fight as Titan-induced monsters in front of news helicopters. Batman refuses to transform, uses the antidote on himself, and defeats the Titan-affected Joker and his henchmen, knocking his nemesis unconscious with an explosive gel-enhanced punch. In the aftermath, those affected by Titan begin to revert to normal, including the Jokerwho is restrained and taken into custody as police officers retake the asylum. Batman overhears a call about a crime led by Two-Face in progress and flies back to Gotham City in the Batwing. In a post-credits scene, a crate of Titan formula is shown floating in the ocean near the asylum when a hand surfaces and grabs it.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{theories}} {{about the nature and}} identity of Spring-heeled Jack. This urban legend was very popular in its time, due to the tales of his bizarre appearance and ability to make extraordinary <b>leaps,</b> <b>to</b> the point that he became the topic of several works of fiction.|$|E

25|$|Athletics {{does not}} have a very high profile in Britain on a week-in week-out basis, but it <b>leaps</b> <b>to</b> {{prominence}} during major championships. The level of attention received by successful British athletes is illustrated by the fact that athletes have won far more BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards than practitioners of any other sport. The governing body of British Athletics is UK Athletics. There are also semi-independent athletics associations in each of the home nations.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, Katherine McCoy {{took two}} major <b>leaps</b> <b>to</b> advance the program, {{in terms of}} student work. First, she began to change the {{introductory}} typography projects to allow students a new semiotic interpretation. This allowed students to begin {{to drive to the}} solutions and to depart from the strict Modernist vocabulary used in the program in previous years. Included are stylistic elements that had previously been underused by Modernist typographers, such as historical or vernacular type forms or images. The second leap was to allow the more advanced and able students to take lead on the exploration of theory.|$|E
25|$|The {{most celebrated}} of these dances is the karakattam. In its {{religious}} form, the dance is performed {{in front of}} an image of the goddess Mariamman. The dancer bears on his or her head a brass pot filled with uncooked rice, decorated with flowers and surrounded by a bamboo frame, and tumbles and <b>leaps</b> <b>to</b> the rhythm of a song without spilling a grain. Karakattam is usually performed to a special type of song known as temmanguppāṭṭu a folk song in the mode of a lover speaking to his beloved, to the accompaniment of a nadaswaram and melam.|$|E

25|$|In 1841, Brower {{teamed up}} with banjoist Dan Emmett, who had been playing banjo in the circus orchestra. Brower took up the playing of the bones, making {{him one of the}} {{earliest}} to marry the instrument with blackface theater. The following season, Brower and Emmett toured with Raymond and Waring's Circus. The duo became well known, and Brower earned a reputation as a first-tier dancer. Brower's introduction of acrobatic <b>leaps</b> <b>to</b> the stage caught on with other blackface performers. His act was well enough known that Master Juba (William Henry Lane) did an impression of Brower dancing (an 1845 playbill for the Ethiopian Minstrels, with whom Juba was touring, lists Brower as the fifth ranked dancer in Juba's show).|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{inspired}} by observing white children {{pretending to be}} ghosts to scare black children, Ben fights back by forming the Ku Klux Klan. As a result, Elsie, out of loyalty to her father, breaks off her relationship with Ben. Later, Flora Cameron goes off alone into the woods to fetch water and is followed by Gus, a freedman and soldier {{who is now a}} captain. He confronts Flora and tells her that he desires to get married. Frightened, she flees into the forest, pursued by Gus. Trapped on a precipice, Flora warns Gus she will jump if he comes any closer. When he does, she <b>leaps</b> <b>to</b> her death. Having run through the forest looking for her, Ben has seen her jump; he holds her as she dies, then carries her body back to the Cameron home. In response, the Klan hunts down Gus, tries him, finds him guilty, and lynches him.|$|E
25|$|While helping Théoden gather his forces, Aragorn is {{approached}} by Elrond who informs him Arwen is dying. Following {{a vision of}} her son, she refused to leave Middle Earth. Elrond gives Aragorn the sword Andúril, Isildur's sword Narsil reforged, so he can reclaim his birthright while gaining reinforcements from the Dead Men of Dunharrow. Joined by Legolas and Gimli, Aragorn travels to the Paths of the Dead, recruiting the Army of the Dead. Faramir is gravely wounded after a futile effort to retake Osgiliath, and believing his son to be dead, Denethor falls into madness. Gandalf is left to command the city defences against the Orc army led by Gothmog. But as Gothmog's forces eventually force {{their way into the}} city, Denethor attempts to kill himself and Faramir on a pyre. Pippin alerts Gandalf and they save Faramir, but Denethor <b>leaps</b> <b>to</b> his death from the top of Minas Tirith just before Théoden and his nephew, Éomer, arrive with the Rohirrim. Initially, the Rohirrim have the advantage at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, but are eventually overwhelmed by the Oliphaunt-riding Haradrim while the Witch-king mortally wounds Théoden. Though Théoden's niece Éowyn, having posed as a male soldier, battles and slays the Witch-King with Merry's help, Théoden dies of his wounds. Aragorn arrives with the Army of the Dead, they overcome the Orcs and win the battle. Aragorn and the other captains of Men decide to lead all who can march upon the Black Gate as a distraction, so Frodo and Sam can get to Mount Doom.|$|E

500|$|In Round the Horne, as well {{as acting}} as link man, Horne also played other {{character}} roles in the film and melodrama spoofs, but always sounded exactly like Kenneth Horne. Referring to his ability with voices, he commented that [...] "between them Betty, Ken W., Hugh and Bill Pertwee can provide at least 100 voices, {{and if you take}} me into account the figure <b>leaps</b> <b>to</b> 101." [...] Williams reported that Horne had a card index mind, [...] "in which there seemed to be stored every funny voice, every dialect, every comedy trick, which he knew that each member of the cast was capable of", and would suggest a change in approach if a line did not work during rehearsals.|$|E
500|$|Evolution {{had less}} obvious {{applications}} to anatomy and morphology, {{and at first}} had little impact on the research of the anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley. Despite this, Huxley strongly supported Darwin on evolution; though he called for experiments to show whether natural selection could form new species, and questioned if Darwin's gradualism was sufficient without sudden <b>leaps</b> <b>to</b> cause speciation. Huxley wanted science to be secular, without religious interference, and his article in the April 1860 Westminster Review promoted scientific naturalism over natural theology, praising Darwin for [...] "extending the domination of Science over regions of thought into which she has, as yet, hardly penetrated" [...] and coining the term [...] "Darwinism" [...] {{as part of his}} efforts to secularise and professionalise science. Huxley gained influence, and initiated the X Club, which used the journal Nature to promote evolution and naturalism, shaping much of late Victorian science. Later, the German morphologist Ernst Haeckel would convince Huxley that comparative anatomy and palaeontology could be used to reconstruct evolutionary genealogies.|$|E
500|$|In the {{execution}} scene which follows, a theme emerges, the incessant repetition of which reminded Newman of the Transformation Music which separates {{the two parts}} of act1 in Wagner's Parsifal. In the final bars, as Tosca evades Spoletta and <b>leaps</b> <b>to</b> her death, the theme of [...] "E lucevan le stelle" [...] is played tutta forze (as loudly as possible). This choice of ending has been strongly criticised by analysts, mainly because of its specific association with Cavaradossi rather than Tosca. Joseph Kerman mocked the final music, [...] "Tosca leaps, and the orchestra screams {{the first thing that}} comes into its head." [...] Budden, however, argues that it is entirely logical to end this dark opera on its blackest theme. According to historian and former opera singer Susan Vandiver Nicassio: [...] "The conflict between the verbal and the musical clues gives the end of the opera a twist of controversy that, barring some unexpected discovery among Puccini's papers, can never truly be resolved." ...|$|E

500|$|Jocelyn Vena of MTV News praised Beyoncé for her [...] "never-miss-a-note voice" [...] and [...] "razzle-dazzle dance moves", and for {{matching}} the crowd's energy with her enthusiasm during live performances. Jozen Cummings of The Wall Street Journal described {{the show as}} Beyoncé's [...] "most intimate work to date", adding {{that it was an}} intimate night between [...] "Beyoncé and her fans, one in which there need not be a specific stand-out moment". Gavin DeGraw of VH1 noted that [...] "there's no doubting Beyoncé's talent as a performer; her undeniable vocal ability, show(wo)manship, and charm" [...] which infused the room the entire evening." [...] By contrast, Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone gave the show a mixed review, writing [...] "a Beyoncé concert is a big, blowsy affair, a bit like a Las Vegas floor show crossed with a typhoon. 'Intimate' is not the adjective that <b>leaps</b> <b>to</b> mind". However, he described Beyoncé as [...] "a woman who can make a club feel like a coliseum". Rosen coined the live performance of [...] "I Was Here" [...] as [...] "a hollow exercise in self-mythologizing". Maura Johnston of The Village Voice placed 4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé on her list of The 10 Best Live Shows of 2011. In a review of the show, she commented [...] "The serenity at her core is borne from a supreme amount of confidence; that it comes off as something generously given is a testament to her prodigious talents as a performer on every level. Plus, I mean, have you heard her sing? Nobody has pipes like her right now. Not a single person out there. At the very least, we can all learn breath control from her." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Papal {{state also}} used Sant'Angelo as a prison; Giordano Bruno, for example, was imprisoned there for six years. Another {{prisoner}} was the sculptor and goldsmith Benvenuto Cellini.

2500|$|Hrothgar is {{plunged into}} gloom and near-despair after Grendel's mother attacks {{the hall and}} kills Hrothgar's best friend and closest advisor; but when Beowulf advises him not to despair, and that [...] "it is better to avenge our friends than to mourn overmuch", Hrothgar <b>leaps</b> <b>to</b> his feet and thanks God for Beowulf's wise words, and leads the Danes and Geats out to attack the small lake (mere) where Grendel's mother lives.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the trial}} {{progresses}} {{it becomes clear}} that Hans is still in love with Ondine. [...] Ondine, in a vain attempt to get out of her pact with the Old One (Hans must die because he deceived Ondine with Bertha) continues to insist that she deceived Hans first with Bertram. [...] Bertram is summoned and supports Ondine's story. [...] But no-one believes them, least of all the second fisherman. [...] Ondine is accused of sorcery. [...] The Old One <b>leaps</b> <b>to</b> her defense saying, [...] "This woman could call upon the earth and the heavens to do her bidding. [...] But she gave up her power to be human. [...] Write this into your record, Judge—this Ondine was the most human being that ever lived. [...] She was human by choice." [...] In the end the judges decide that Ondine transgressed the boundaries of nature, but in so doing she brought only kindness and love. [...] So they are compassionate in merely sentencing her to death while sparing her a public execution.|$|E
