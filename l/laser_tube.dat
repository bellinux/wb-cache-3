Angling of the light energy produced by the laser is detected by having a beam of light go through a suspension and then onto a sensor.

The sizes the laser can analyze depend on the lens' focal length, the distance from the lens to its point of focus. As the focal length increases, the area the laser can detect increases as well, displaying a proportional relationship. A computer can then be used to detect the object's particle sizes from the light energy produced and its layout, which the computer derives from the data collected on the particle frequencies and wavelengths.|$|E

30|$|As seen in {{previous}} researches, {{in the first}} approximation, the stabilization is normally carried out by controlling {{the length of the}} laser. In the case of internal-mirror He–Ne lasers, the length of the laser can be controlled by adjusting the temperature of the <b>laser</b> <b>tube.</b> For this purpose, generally, the current of a strip heater wound around the <b>laser</b> <b>tube</b> can be controlled by an electronic circuit. Although in this method one can achieve a quite high stability, ∼ 10 − 9 [19], using a heater may change the original features of <b>laser</b> <b>tube,</b> making the stabilization process more difficult due to additional temperature increase in the <b>laser</b> <b>tube,</b> which in turn reduces its lifetime. To overcome the problem, in 1982 Sasaki et al. [14] controlled the temperature of the <b>laser</b> <b>tube</b> by a cooling fan and obtained a stability of ∼ 10 − 8 by this procedure. In 2012, Qian et al. achieved a stability of 4.3  ×  10 − 9 by removing some drawbacks. They realized that the short-term stability may be limited by mechanical vibration of the fan and air flow, which can be improved by utilizing a mini cooling fan with lower vibration. In addition, to achieve a smoother rotation of the fan, they optimized the drive circuit [15]. Although the use of fan apparently prevents the temperature rise of the <b>laser</b> <b>tube,</b> the least disruption in the fan revolution adjustment severely affects short-term stability. To control the length of laser cavity, Ellis et al. utilized a Peltier thermoelectric cooler in 2010 and 2012 [16, 17]. They used a mixed mode within the optical cavity to stabilize the absolute laser frequency. But in the papers, the effect of laser plasma ambient temperature on the output power has not been examined.|$|E

30|$|An {{approach}} for frequency stabilization of an ambience-isolated internal-mirror He–Ne laser (632.8  nm) utilizing temperature {{control of the}} <b>laser</b> <b>tube</b> with Peltier thermoelectric coolers is demonstrated. Measurements indicate that there are an optimal temperature (23  °C) and an optimal discharge current (5.5  mA) of <b>laser</b> <b>tube</b> for which the laser light power is separately maximized. To prevent the effect of fluctuation of discharge current on the laser stability, an adjustable current source is designed and fabricated so that the current is set to be optimal (5.50  ±  0.01  mA). To isolate the <b>laser</b> <b>tube</b> from the environment, the laser metallic box connected to two Peltier thermoelectric coolers is surrounded by two thermal and acoustic insulator shells. The laser has two longitudinal modes very often. Any change {{in the frequency of}} longitudinal modes at the optimal temperature is monitored by sampling the difference of longitudinal modes’ intensities. Therefore, using a feedback mechanism, the current of thermoelectric coolers is so controlled that the frequency of modes stays constant on the gain profile of the laser. The frequency stability is measured equal to 1.17  ×  10 − 9 (∼ 2700 ×) for less than 1  min and 2.57  ×  10 − 9 (∼ 1200 ×) for more than 1  h.|$|E
30|$|In this paper, {{an active}} method for {{frequency}} stabilization of an internal-mirror red He–Ne laser was scrutinized. First of all, {{the number of}} laser longitudinal modes and {{the direction of the}} laser principal axes were determined using a polarizer and an SF–PI. Then, the laser light power versus the discharge current was measured, and it was proved that there was an optimal current (5.5  mA) for which the laser power was the maximum. In addition, the measurement of the laser output power versus the temperature of the <b>laser</b> <b>tube</b> indicated that there was also an optimal temperature (23  °C) in which the laser power was the maximum. Therefore, the current of the <b>laser</b> <b>tube</b> was set at 5.50  ±  0.01  mA by an adjustable current source. High-precision current source prevents any alteration or deviation from the optimal current due to power supply instability or city electricity’s fluctuation, which, at first-order approximation, leads to a short-term stability of about 4.30  ×  10 − 8. Moreover, the laser system was isolated from the environment using two thermal and acoustic insulator shells. To appropriately control the temperature of the <b>laser</b> <b>tube,</b> two Peltier thermoelectric coolers were connected to the laser box through an aluminum block. By adjusting the current of the coolers, the <b>laser</b> <b>tube</b> was set at the optimal temperature. Then, to overcome any fluctuations in laser frequency, the laser tube’s temperature was controlled by a feedback mechanism whose input receives a signal related to the difference of laser longitudinal modes’ intensities. The measurement by the comparison method signified that the stability of laser frequency for less than 1  min (short-term stability) is 1.17  ×  10 − 9, and for more than 1  h (long-term stability) is 2.57  ×  10 − 9, corresponding to a coherence length of the order ~ 250  m.|$|E
