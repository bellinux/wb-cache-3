Results and conclusion: The paper shows that, compared with all the previous classifications, the 2008 European Glaucoma Society classification is one step ahead (in the way of classifying the group of secondary angle-closure glaucomas), two steps behind (in rejecting two useful categories of congenital glaucoma), and similar in several respects: that it is based on criticizable fundamental and secondary criteria that cannot cover all forms of sickness gathered at a particular crossing; that it uses several equally weighted criteria for one single crossing (division); that it frames one clinical entity in several clinical categories; that it does not reflect reality in some aspects; and that it does not offer direct therapeutic suggestions: after framing a case in a scheme built on the basis of gonioscopic observation, it requires a second stage of pathogenic analysis, so that the ophthalmologist is able to decide the correct treatment only in the third stage. All these considerations justify the efforts to find a new classification that will be able to correct the abovementioned shortcomings.

40|$|Drastic {{changes in}} hormone titers, in {{particular}} of steroid hormones, are intuitively interpreted as necessary and beneficial for optimal functioning of animals. Peaks in progesterone- and estradiol titers that accompany the estrus cycle in female vertebrates {{as well as}} in ecdysteroids at each molt and during metamorphosis of holometabolous insects are prominent examples. A recent analysis of insect metamorphosis yielded the view that, in general, a sharp rise in sex steroid hormone titer signals that somewhere in the body some tissue(s) is undergoing programmed cell death/apoptosis. Increased steroid production is part of this process. Typical examples are ovarian follicle cells in female vertebrates and invertebrates and the prothoracic gland cells, the main production site of ecdysteroids in larval insects. A duality emerges: programmed cell death-apoptosis is deleterious at the cellular level, but it may yield beneficial effects at the organismal level. Reconciling both opposites requires reevaluating the probable evolutionary origin and role of peptidic brain hormones that direct steroid hormone synthesis. Do e. g. Luteinizing Hormone in vertebrates and Prothoracicotropic Hormone (PTTH: acting through the Torso receptor) in insects still retain an ancient role as toxins in the early immune system? Does the functional link of some neuropeptides with Ca(2 +) -induced apoptosis make sense in endocrine archeology?

It was noted down, that in the last decade there were 11 mass riots that caused many victims, materially and psychologically. This problem even became the ·main city issue that caused mass disturbance. The early stage of this research aimed to formulate a social defense model in the community by doing Focus Discussion Group. The supporting data of this research ware taken from home stakeholders in Surakarta, such as professional organizations, local association and local government. The data are taken in the form of facts and other things that {{have something to do with}} the actual condition in the daily life. Therefore, this research tends to be an explorative research. A harmony concept would be used in explaining the social defense. That stress not only on many indicators in the social harmony hilt also the social relationship among the different social level. These are due to the community need of social harmony to realize safely and comfortably situation in community. Therefore a harmony relationship in forming social defense system will be appeared. In accordance with the formation of a safe and comfortable city environment, there are several conditions of social defense that could be identified by the ability of keeping peace, anticipating conflict and recovering social condition. Based on the research, the social defense values could be produced by planning development in every district through the ability of the community to identify the rising issues and through the social defense potencies as <b>logical</b> <b>frames.</b> Later on the researcher strengthened the social defense by forming an appropriate organization which concerns on researching the community management and social defense by forming of social defense Keywords: Social defense, peace keeping, conflict anticipation, social recovery, division of social defence...|$|R
40|$|Constantin-Dan Bordeianu Private Practice, Ploiesti, Prahova, Romania Purpose: To {{suggest a}} new {{glaucoma}} classification that is pathogenic, etiologic, and clinical. Methods: After discussing the logical pathway used in criteria selection, the paper presents the new classification and compares {{it with the}} classification currently in use, that is, the one issued by the European Glaucoma Society in 2008. Results: The paper proves that the new classification is clear (being based on a coherent and consistently followed set of criteria), is comprehensive (framing all forms of glaucoma), and helps in understanding the sickness understanding (in that it uses a <b>logical</b> <b>framing</b> system). The great advantage is that it facilitates therapeutic decision making in that it offers direct therapeutic suggestions and avoids errors leading to disasters. Moreover, the scheme remains open to any new development. Conclusion: The suggested classification is a pathogenic, etiologic, and clinical classification that fulfills the conditions of an ideal classification. The suggested classification is the first classification in which the main criterion is consistently used for the first 5 to 7 crossings until its differentiation capabilities are exhausted. Then, secondary criteria (etiologic and clinical) pick up the relay until each form finds its logical place in the scheme. In order to avoid unclear aspects, the genetic criterion is no longer used, being replaced by age, one of the clinical criteria. The suggested classification brings only benefits to all categories of ophthalmologists: the beginners will have a tool {{to better understand the}} sickness and to ease their decision making, whereas the experienced doctors will have their practice simplified. For all doctors, errors leading to therapeutic disasters will be less likely to happen. Finally, researchers will have the object of their work gathered in the group of glaucoma with unknown or uncertain pathogenesis, whereas the results of their work will easily find a logical place in the scheme, as the suggested classification remains open to any new development.

40|$|The present {{paper has}} {{reviewed}} the potential {{interpretations of the}} incubation process and examined in detail the basic types of corporate incubators having an increasing role in everyday practice together with the main objectives of the different types. We have also mapped how {{the different types of}} enterprises can join the incubation process and highlighted that for-profit organisations can also play a significant role within financing solutions. We made an attempt to prove that – under adequate conditions – the cooperation of private capital and incubators is suitable for creating a bridge over the equity and knowledge gap, which means that such co-operations can also have significant economic development effects. Incubators operating on such bases can support small and medium-sized enterprises not only by offering financial and professional help. Experience has shown that the incubation process can be "naturally accompaniedâ€ by the initiation of a networking process, the advantages of which can also be used by the companies participating in incubation. After examining the special features related to the operation of corporate incubators –which served to set the <b>logical</b> <b>frames</b> of the analysis – we studied in detail what role the state can assume in such type of incubation. Following some theoretical considerations and an analysis of successful and failed practical examples we reached the conclusion that governmental interventions â€žcan have their placeâ€ in this process. Since there are various different ways for the development of incubators, the types of roles taken by the state can also differ. A model was developed in which we summarized potential governmental strategies, also discussing the possible effects on the players of the incubation industry. We are convinced that the analysis of this highly new and dynamically developing area may also lead to conclusions that can be applied in practice and the recognition of defined rules and laws may contribute to the improvement of the national practice. business incubation, corporate business incubation, knowledge and capital gap, V 2 C (venture to capital), Community/Rural/Urban Development, Financial Economics,...|$|R

The theories include forms of “positive ” and “bounded ” induction on W and naturally characterize primitive recursive and polytime functions (respectively). We prove that the recursive content of the theories under investigation (i. e. the associated class of provably total functions on W) is invariant under addition of 1. an axiom of choice for operations and a uniformity principle, restricted to positive conditions; 2. a (form of) self-referential truth, providing a fixed point theorem for predicates. As to the proof methods, we apply a kind of internal forcing semantics, non-standard variants of realizability and cut-elimination. § 1. Introduction.

The participants were female junior students majoring in English literature at Kerman Azad University. These learners were regarded as intermediate ones scoring 400 - 550 in the proficiency test. Then, the learners were provided with an argumentative topic to write a 250 -word essay in 45 minutes. The number of misuses of metadiscourse markers were counted with regard to their use of textual and interpersonal markers of this kind, and the subcategories of textual (<b>logical</b> connectives, <b>frame</b> markers, endophoric markers, evidentials, and code glosses), and the subcategories of interpersonal metadiscourse markers (hedges, emphatics, attitude markers, relational markers, and person markers). Moreover, different classifications of misuses were explored. The results of Chi-square analysis indicated that misuses of metadiscourse makers can be due to overuse of these markers (e. g. logical connective and person markers), punctuation,interlingua, and intralinguaerrors.

In psychometric theory, Spearman’s law of diminishing returns postulates that increasing g allows increasing differentiation of cognitive abilities, because increased mental power allows variable investment in domain-specific learning. Empirical {{evidence has been}} inconsistent so far, with some studies supporting and others contradicting this mechanism. This state of affairs {{is due to a}} developmental phenomenon: Both differentiation and strengthening of relations between specific processes and g may happen but these changes are phase-specific and ability-specific, depending upon the developmental priorities in the formation of g in each phase. We present eight studies covering the age span from 4 to 85 years in support of this phenomenon. Using new powerful modeling methods we showed that differentiation and binding of mental processes in g occurs in cycles. Specific processes intertwine with g at the beginning of cycles when they are integrated into it; when well established, these processes may vary with increasing g, reflecting its higher flexibility.
