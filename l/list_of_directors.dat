500|$|The {{cornerstone}} of The First Church of Christ, Scientist, containing the Bible, Eddy's writings and a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>directors</b> and financial contributors, was laid in May 1894 in the Back Bay area of Boston. Church members raised {{funds for the}} construction, and the building was finished in December 1894 {{at a cost of}} $250,000. It contained a [...] "Mother's Room" [...] in the tower for Eddy's personal use, furnished with rare books, silks, tapestries, rugs, a dressing gown and slippers, though she spent only one night there and it was later turned into a storage room. The archway into the room was made of Italian marble, and the word Mother was engraved on the floor.|$|E

60|$|To {{tell the}} truth, Mr. Walker had {{determined}} to make his fortune. And what is easier in London? Is not the share-market open to all? Do not Spanish and Columbian bonds rise and fall? For what are companies invented, but to place thousands {{in the pockets of}} shareholders and directors? Into these commercial pursuits the gallant Captain now plunged with great energy, and made some brilliant hits at first starting, and bought and sold so opportunely, that his name began to rise in the City as a capitalist, and might be seen in the printed <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>directors</b> of many excellent and philanthropic schemes, of which there is never any lack in London. Business to the amount of thousands was done at his agency; shares of vast value were bought and sold under his management. How poor Mr. Eglantine used to hate him and envy him, as from the door of his emporium (the firm was Eglantine and Mossrose now) he saw the Captain daily arrive in his pony-phaeton, and heard of the start he had taken in life.|$|E

It's {{not one of those}} sham things that melt away like snow and leave the {{shareholders}} nowhere. There's the prospectus, Mr. Wharton. Perhaps you have not seen that before. Take it away and cast your eye over it at your leisure." [...] Mr. Wharton put the somewhat lengthy pamphlet into his pocket. [...] "Look at the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>Directors.</b> We've three members of Parliament, a baronet, and one or two City names that are as good--as good as the Bank of England. If that prospectus won't make a man confident I don't know what will. Why, Mr. Wharton, you don't think that your son-in-law would get those fifty shares at par unless he was going out as our general local manager. The shares ain't to be had. It's a large concern as far as capital goes. You'll see if you look. About {{a quarter of a million}} paid up. But it's all in a box as one may say. It's among ourselves. The shares ain't in the market. Of course it's not for me to say what should be done between you and your son-in-law. Lopez is a friend of mine, and a man I esteem, and all that. Nevertheless I shouldn't think of advising you to do this or that,--or not to do it. But when you talk of safety, Mr. Wharton,--why, Mr. Wharton, I don't scruple to tell you as a man who knows what these things are, that this is an opportunity that doesn't come in a man's way perhaps twice in his life." ...|$|E
