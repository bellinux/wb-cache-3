5|$|The {{band was}} formed by Scogin shortly after he left his {{position}} of vocalist in Norma Jean. In 2004, a record deal was signed with Solid State Records and a debut album was released, titled Everything Is Alive, Everything Is Breathing, Nothing Is Dead, and Nothing Is Bleeding. The band toured constantly after that. The Chariot released the Unsung EP in 2005, which was then followed by three successful studio albums: The Fiancée in 2007, Wars and Rumors of Wars in 2009, and <b>Long</b> <b>Live</b> in 2010. The band entered the studio in May 2012 to record their fifth full-length album titled One Wing which was released August 28, 2012. The Chariot disbanded following a farewell tour in late 2013.|$|E

However, his soldiers clamored {{for an end to}} the fighting. Instead of the usual shouts of Vive l'Empereur (<b>long</b> <b>live</b> the emperor), cries of Vive la paix (<b>long</b> <b>live</b> peace) were heard in the bivouacs when the emperor passed by. On 17 February the French began their withdrawal westward into winter quarters. By the 23rd the French reached their cantonments, with Bernadotte's I Corps on the left, Soult's IV Corps in the center, and Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout's III Corps on the right. Ney's VI Corps occupied an advanced position at Guttstadt, while the Imperial Guard and the Reserve Cavalry occupied the rear area around Ostróda (Osterode). Napoleon stationed the V Corps in a position to cover Warsaw. Marshal Pierre Augereau's decimated VII Corps was broken up and its survivors were allotted to the other corps.|$|E

25|$|After the Revolution of 1979, and {{following}} the Cultural Revolution, a new age emerged in Iranian cinema, starting with <b>Long</b> <b>Live!</b> by Khosrow Sinai and followed by many other directors, such as Abbas Kiarostami and Jafar Panahi. Kiarostami, an acclaimed Iranian director, planted Iran firmly on the map of world cinema {{when he won the}} Palme d'Or for Taste of Cherry in 1997. The continuous presence of Iranian films in prestigious international festivals, such as the Cannes Film Festival, the Venice Film Festival, and the Berlin International Film Festival, attracted world attention to Iranian masterpieces. In 2006, six Iranian films, of six different styles, represented Iranian cinema at the Berlin International Film Festival. Critics considered this a remarkable event in the history of Iranian cinema.|$|E
25|$|With no {{constitutional}} amendment done, Annadurai declared 26 January 1965, the 15th Republic Day of India {{and also the}} day the Constitution, which in essence enshrined Hindi as the official language of India, came into practice, as a day of mourning. This move was opposed by the then Chief Minister of Madras State, Bhakthavatchalam, as blasphemous. Hence Annadurai, who by then {{had been trying to}} shake off the secessionist image of his party, declared 24 January as a day of mourning. He also replaced the slogan of the protests to Down with Hindi; <b>Long</b> <b>live</b> the Republic. Nevertheless, violence broke out on 26 January, initially in Madurai which within days spread throughout the state. Robert Hardgrave Jr, professor of humanities, government and Asian studies, suggests that the elements contributing to the riots were not instigated by DMK or Leftists or even the industrialists, as the Congress government of the state suggested, but were genuine frustrations and discontentment which lay {{beneath the surface of the}} people of the state.|$|E

25|$|In 1923, {{extracts}} {{from all three}} Henry VI plays were broadcast on BBC Radio, performed by the Cardiff Station Repertory Company as the third episode {{of a series of}} programs showcasing Shakespeare's plays, entitled Shakespeare Night. In 1947, BBC Third Programme aired a one-hundred-and-fifty-minute adaptation of the trilogy as part of their Shakespeare's Historical Plays series, a six-part adaptation of the eight sequential history plays, with linked casting. Adapted by Maurice Roy Ridley, King Henry VI starred John Byron as Henry and Gladys Young as Margaret. Almost the entirety of 1 Henry VI was cut, with everything related to the conflict in France being removed. In 1952, Third Programme aired an adaptation of the tetralogy by Peter Watts and John Dover Wilson under the general name The Wars of the Roses. The tetralogy was adapted into a trilogy but in an unusual way. 1 Henry VI was simply removed, so the trilogy contained only 2 Henry VI, 3 Henry VI and Richard III. The adaptation starred Valentine Dyall as Henry and Sonia Dresdel as Margaret. In 1971, BBC Radio 3 presented a two-part adaptation of the trilogy by Raymond Raikes. Part 1 contained an abridged 1 Henry VI and an abridged version of the first three acts of 2 Henry VI. Part 2 presented Acts 4 and 5 of 2 Henry VI and an abridged 3 Henry VI. Nigel Lambert played Henry, Barbara Jefford played Margaret, Francis de Wolff played Talbot and Elizabeth Morgan played Joan. In 1977, BBC Radio 4 presented a 26-part serialisation of the eight sequential history plays under the general title Vivat Rex (<b>long</b> <b>live</b> the King). Adapted by Martin Jenkins as part of the celebration of the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II, 1 Henry VI comprised episodes 15 ("Joan of Arc") and 16 ("The White Rose and the Red"). James Laurenson played Henry, Peggy Ashcroft played Margaret, Clive Swift played Talbot, Hannah Gordon played Joan, and Richard Burton narrated.|$|E

The analysis brings clarity to the key components of the relaxation mechanism of <b>long</b> <b>lived</b> states by focusing exclusively on the symmetry of the spin Hamiltonian. Our study shows that the dipole-dipole coupling between protons of a methyl group and between the protons and an external spin are both symmetry breaking interactions {{that can lead to}} relaxation pathways that transform the polarization from symmetry order to Zeeman order, but the net contribution of the internal dipolar interaction to the NMR observation of <b>long</b> <b>lived</b> states is zero. Our calculation is in agreement with the reported features of the observed spectra. Comment: 13 pages and 3 figure...|$|R
