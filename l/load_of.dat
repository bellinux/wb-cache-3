5|$|Several factors {{affect the}} cost to move a bulk cargo by ship. The bulk freight market is very volatile, and it fluctuates, along {{with the type of}} cargo, the ship's size, and the route {{traveled}} all affect the final price. Moving a capesize <b>load</b> <b>of</b> coal from South America to Europe cost anywhere from $15 to $25 per ton in 2005. Hauling a panamax-sized <b>load</b> <b>of</b> aggregate materials from the Gulf of Mexico to Japan that year could cost as little as $40 per ton to as much as $70 per ton.|$|E
5|$|There is scant {{record of}} the ship's {{movements}} under any of her later names. The Los Angeles Times reports her arrival at West Coast ports as Seisho Maru at least twice. In March 1930, the ship arrived at Tacoma, Washington, from Singapore {{to pick up a}} <b>load</b> <b>of</b> logs for export. Another notice in November 1933 noted her impending return to Los Angeles, where she was scheduled to take on a <b>load</b> <b>of</b> borax and scrap brass. In early May 1939, Seisho Maru ran aground in Tokyo Bay, but was refloated after several days.|$|E
5|$|At New York, West Lianga {{took on a}} <b>load</b> <b>of</b> 6,882 tons of {{materiel}} for the United States Army and a deck-load of 32 {{trucks and}} departed for France in a convoy. After unloading her cargo at Bordeaux, she returned to New York on 16 October. After voyage repairs, she loaded another 6,685 tons of cargo for the Quartermaster Corps and departed for Europe on 3 November. West Lianga was en route to France when the Armistice that ended fighting was signed on 11 November. West Lianga delivered her cargo to Saint-Nazaire and took on a <b>load</b> <b>of</b> 1,700 tons for delivery to the United States. After departing from France on 21 December, West Lianga arrived at New York on 4 January 1919.|$|E
30|$|PC 1 {{explaining}} 19.45 % {{of total}} variance has strong loading on pH and PO 4 -P and moderate negative <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> COD. The positive <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> pH {{is associated with}} alkaline nature of wastewater, with elevated levels of phosphates mainly from phosphate-based detergents and soaps; thus, PC 1 represents alkaline factor. PC 2 explaining 17.34 % of variance has strong positive <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> EC, moderate positive <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> NO 3 -N and strong negative <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> TSS; thus, PC 2 represents salts/ions factor. PC 3 explaining a variance of 15.18 % has strong positive <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> Ca and moderate negative <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> Cl, whereas moderate positive <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> BOD 5. The negative <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> Cl indicates the source of Ca is other than catchment as Ca is mainly contributed by catchment geology, but its positive association with BOD 5 indicated it is added during the usage of water due the addition of organic matter; thus, PC 3 represents household/water usage factor. PC 4 with a total variance of 14.08 % has strong positive <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> TDS and K as {{both of them are}} in dissolved state; thus, PC 4 represents dissolved salts factor. PC 5 explaining 12.29 % of total variance has strong positive <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> TP and moderate positive <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> Cl. Phosphates and chlorides are mainly contributed by soaps and detergents, in addition to catchment, thus PC 5 represents soap/detergent factor. PC 6 with a total variance of 11.94 % has strong positive <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> Na and moderate positive <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> Mg. Na is contributed by both catchment and household usage of water, but its association with Mg indicates its source as catchment since the Mg is mainly contributed by catchment; thus, PC 6 also represents catchment factor. Thus, overall characteristics of the wastewater are attributed by the household usage along with catchment geology.|$|R
40|$|Investigations {{were carried}} out on the {{bacterial}} flora of water {{and the quality of}} rotifers in outdoor mass culture tanks. Brachionus plicatilis and B. rotundiformis were cultured in 10 numbers of 1 tonne tanks and the physico-chemical parameters and microbial <b>loads</b> <b>of</b> water, and total bacterial and Vibrio <b>loads</b> <b>of</b> microalgae and rotifers, during the period 2014 - 15, were studied. The study revealed a significant variation of the ammonia levels and total bacterial loads with different diets (P < 0. 05). A positive correlation was observed between the total bacterial <b>loads</b> <b>of</b> algal concentrations and <b>loads</b> <b>of</b> rotifers, but no correlation was observed between Vibrio <b>loads</b> <b>of</b> water and rotifers. The prevalence <b>of</b> Vibrio <b>loads</b> <b>of</b> rotifers was low in tanks fed with Nannochloropsis oculata and maximum Vibrio loads were recorded in Chaetoceros calcitrans fed rotifers. The Vibrio loads significantly varied with days of culture and also with the algal diets. A positive correlation was observed between the total Vibrio <b>loads</b> <b>of</b> water and rotifers...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To test {{different}} models for {{ways in which}} birth weight and familial loading influence the risk for psychopathology in bipolar offspring. Method: DSM-IV diagnoses of 140 bipolar offspring (12 - 21 years of age) were assessed with the K-SADS-PL. Parents were interviewed using the Family History-Research Diagnostic Criteria to determine familial <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> mood and substance use disorders. Parents reported the birth weight of their offspring. Age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratios were calculated. Results: Low birth weight was associated with mood and non-mood disorders in bipolar offspring (hazard ratio = 0. 6, confidence interval = 0. 4 - 0. 8), even after controlling for familial <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> unipolar disorder, bipolar disorder, or substance use disorder. There were no significant interactions between birth weight and familial <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> unipolar disorder, familial <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> bipolar disorder, and familial <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> substance use disorder. Conclusions: Birth weight is associated with mood as well as non-mood disorders. This association is independent from the association <b>of</b> familial <b>loading</b> <b>of</b> mood and substance use disorder with mood- and non-mood disorders in bipolar offspring...|$|R

5|$|The {{airframe}} {{incorporates the}} use of composite materials, which comprise nine percent of its original structural weight (all models outside the 777-8 and 777-9). Elements made from composite material include the cabin floor and rudder. The main fuselage cross-section is circular and tapers rearward into a blade-shaped tail cone with a port-facing auxiliary power unit. The aircraft also features the largest landing gear and the biggest tires ever used in a commercial jetliner. The six-wheel bogies are designed to spread the <b>load</b> <b>of</b> the aircraft over a wide area without requiring an additional centerline gear. This helps reduce weight and simplifies the aircraft's braking and hydraulic systems. Each tire of a 777-300ER six-wheel main landing gear can carry a <b>load</b> <b>of</b> , which is heavier than other wide-bodies such as the 747-400. The aircraft has triple redundant hydraulic systems with only one system required for landing. A ram air turbine –a small retractable propeller which can provide emergency power– is also fitted in the wing root fairing.|$|E
