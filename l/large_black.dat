5|$|At {{its peak}} of popularity, the <b>Large</b> <b>Black</b> was used mainly for meat production, {{especially}} bacon. The {{meat from the}} <b>Large</b> <b>Black</b> {{is known for its}} lean quality and flavour without an excess of back fat, but for commercial production it was often crossed with the Yorkshire and Middle White pigs, producing a vigorous hybrid that was well regarded by farmers. However, today commercial processors do not favour the black skin of the purebred <b>Large</b> <b>Black.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 19th century, the <b>Large</b> <b>Black</b> grew in popularity. A breed association, the <b>Large</b> <b>Black</b> Pig Society, {{was formed in}} 1898 or 1899, in Ipswich, Suffolk. A trademark, {{consisting}} of the letters LBP within a shield, was registered in 1902.|$|E

5|$|In 1955 the Howitt {{report on}} the {{development}} of pig production in the United Kingdom was published. Its main conclusions were that UK pig farms were poorly placed to compete with European producers, that the diversity of local breeds in the UK was an obstacle to progress, and that British pig farmers should focus on three breeds only: the Welsh, the British Landrace, and the Large White. The report initiated a period of decline in all other British pig breeds, including the <b>Large</b> <b>Black.</b> By the time the Rare Breeds Survival Trust was founded 1973, numbers of all traditional pig breeds were dangerously low, and many of them were extinct. The <b>Large</b> <b>Black</b> was placed on the Trust's endangered list.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Large</b> <b>Black</b> {{combined}} local black pig breeds {{from the}} West Country and the East of England. With {{the founding of}} a breed association in 1898 or 1899, variations between the types from the two areas decreased. The <b>Large</b> <b>Black</b> was popular in the early 1900s and was exported to {{many areas of the}} world. Population numbers declined after the Second World War as farmers turned to breeds more suitable to intensive pig farming, and by the 1960s the breed was almost extinct. Numbers have slowly risen, but it is still considered vulnerable by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust, the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy, and Rare Breeds Canada.|$|E

5|$|By 1913, <b>Large</b> <b>Black</b> had by {{then spread}} {{throughout}} most of Britain, and had been exported to most of mainland Europe and to North and South America, Africa and Oceania. The first exports to Australia were in 1902 or 1903, with the <b>Large</b> <b>Black</b> being chosen over the Berkshire pig because {{of their ability to}} thrive in hot weather, their foraging abilities and their fecundity. By 1930, Large Blacks represented only 1 percent of Australia pig population, and were raised mainly by breeders in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. The breed population continued to hover around 1 percent of the total population, with a slight increase after World War II and a decrease to almost zero new registrations in the 1980s. The first exports to the US were in the 1920s, but the population in that country dwindled to the point where imports were again necessary in 1985. Today, small herds {{can be found in the}} US that descend from the pigs imported in 1985 and 1990, and there are also herds in Canada, Australia, and South Africa.|$|E
