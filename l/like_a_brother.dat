5|$|Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe (née Clemm; August 15, 1822 – January 30, 1847) was {{the wife}} of American writer Edgar Allan Poe. The couple were first cousins and {{publicly}} married when Virginia Clemm was 13 and Poe was 26. Biographers disagree as {{to the nature of}} the couple's relationship. Though their marriage was loving, some biographers suggest they viewed one another more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>brother</b> and sister. In January 1842 she contracted tuberculosis, growing worse for five years until she died of the disease at the age of 24 in the family's cottage, at that time outside New York City.|$|E

He has strong bonds with Kondōwho raised Okita {{from the age of}} nine after Okita's mother and {{siblings}} could no longer afford to care for him, and Hijikatawhom he loves and respects <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>brother.</b> He is the first person to discover Sei's true sex and he is her main confidant on matters relating to it. He had wanted her {{to go back to a}} normal girl's life after she had gotten her revenge because of the brutality of the life of a samurai. After the Ikedaya Affair, he admits he has affections for Sei as if she were his own kin. Over a year after those events he realizes he is in love with her. When he was 17, a woman he rejected attempted suicide in front of him and Okita came to the conclusion that falling in love was not worth such pain, and he has kept his distance from women ever since. Another hindrance to romance is that he has dedicated his life to the path of the samurai and has vowed to himself that he will never marry. The character is based on the historical figure of Okita Sōji.|$|E
500|$|For years, Ike & Tina Turner's success {{had made}} {{separation}} unthinkable. Back in 1956, 16-year-old Anna Mae Bullock {{was fascinated by}} Ike Turner and his Kings of Rhythm. One night she grabbed the mike [...] and belted out the B.B. King standard ”You Know I Love You,” Ike was impressed and later invited her to join the band when she needed money. In 1958 after Tina's mom put her and her infant son Craig out of the house, she moved into Ike's home in East St. Louis. During that period, Ike began musically training Tina. At the beginning, the two had no mutual attraction; Tina felt Ike was not the [...] "ideal-looking man" [...] and felt he was <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>brother.</b> Tina preferred light-skinned guys better than dark-skinned guys. Ike viewed her as a sister and favored [...] "curvaceous women." [...] Ike was still married to his common-law wife, Lorraine Taylor, during this period.|$|E

The victim, Percy Howell, appeared to suffer sustained blows to the head from a blunt object but waited days before seeking treatment. Although initially suspicious of the boy's cold and uncaring father (Dan Moran), a devout Christian who makes antisemitic remarks at Munch, the detectives eventually question another teen (Gavin Goren) who spent time with Howell right before he died. After convincing the gullible teen that the copy machine was actually an [...] "electrolyte neutron magnetic scanner" [...] that could detect lies, they learn Howell was killed by Colin Dietz (Joe Fersedi), the teenage leader of a gang called the Zaps, with a baseball bat. Munch and Bolander arrest Dietz, who says he loved Howell <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>brother</b> and the beating was an initiation. Bolander is deeply disturbed by Dietz's cold casualness in discussing the murder. Later, Bolander talks to a bartender (John Waters) about his divorce, and the episode ends with Bolander drinking alone at the bar, quietly singing an Elvis Presley song.|$|E

Owens was devastated. [...] "He was <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>brother,</b> {{a son and a}} best friend," [...] he said in the late 1990s. [...] "Something I never said before, maybe I couldn't, but I think my music life ended when he died.

He went through the process with us, and now he's <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>brother.</b> He was completely an outsider to what we were doing, {{and that was the}} one thing that we consciously decided. For this record we wanted to go out of our comfort zone, usually we’re around friends of ours. For this one, I think it was important to work with somebody who didn’t even know what some of our influences were. Someone completely out of the box for us, and I think he was key in making this record sound the way it does." ...|$|E

He always lived on the edge and I was always waiting for a 'phone call {{to say that he}} had died but I never dreamed it would be under those circumstances. He's never got the credit he deserves. He should be in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame because he was the greatest white soul singer that England ever produced. I'm certain that if you caught the likes of Rod Stewart and Paul Rodgers in a private moment and asked them who was the main man, they would say, Steve Marriott." [...] – Jerry Shirley ...|$|E

2500|$|Cao Cao admired Guan Yu's character, {{but he also}} {{sensed that}} Guan had no {{intention}} of serving under him for long. He told Zhang Liao, [...] "Why don't you make use of your friendship with Guan Yu to find out his objective?" [...] When Zhang Liao asked Guan Yu, the latter replied, [...] "I'm aware that Lord Cao treats me very generously. However, I've also received many favours from General Liu and I've sworn to follow him until I die. I cannot break my oath. I'll leave eventually, so you should help me convey my message to Lord Cao." [...] Zhang Liao did so, and Cao Cao was further impressed with Guan Yu. The Fu Zi gave a slightly different account of this incident. It stated that Zhang Liao had a dilemma on whether to convey Guan Yu's message to Cao Cao or not: if he did, Cao Cao might execute Guan Yu; if he did not, he would be failing in his service to Cao Cao. He sighed, [...] "Lord Cao is my superior and is like a father to me; Guan Yu is <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>brother</b> to me." [...] He eventually made his decision to tell Cao Cao. Cao Cao said, [...] "A subject who serves a lord but does not forget his origins is truly a man of righteousness. When do you think he will leave?"

2500|$|On 6 September 2008, Quo Vadis {{played a}} concert at The Medley in Montreal, at which Stéphane Paré {{confirmed}} that Yanic and {{him would be}} leaving the band, leaving Bart as the only original member still left in the band. Bart speculated that {{the distance between the}} band and Yanic contributed to his departure; [...] "With regard to Yanic, I know {{it was a very difficult}} decision to make on his part. People change, priorities change, personal situations change and he's been flying in from Tennessee for all the shows so you can imagine with the recent developments in the US/gas prices/travel and the fact that we were working remotely on the new record had probably something to do with it. I guess sometimes you have to make difficult decisions and this one was Yanic's. For sure on my end I will miss him on stage and working with him because he's been <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>brother</b> to me for 15 years and we've been through so much together." [...] At the same show, Bart's right knee, which had both ligaments torn away in a sports injury, gave in completely and he supported his entire weight on his left knee for the rest of the show. However, this was to no avail as eventually Rob [...] "The Witch" [...] from Necronomicon and Stephane from BCI had to carry Bart around for the rest of the set, eventually having him sit up on a chair for the remainder of the show. Stéphane proposed cutting the show short but Bart refused and played on till the end. In the following months, both his knees had to have surgery.|$|E
