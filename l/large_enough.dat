Based on the {{experiments}} of a reinforced concrete frame column, 5 new members with different volumetric percentage of stirrups which are applied with constant axial load and horizontal low-frequency cyclic load are analyzed with ABAQUS. This paper aims {{to study the}} relationship between volume-stirrup ratio and seismic behavior of reinforced concrete column. By analyzing skeleton curve and hysteretic curve of members, the results show that, if stirrups are reasonably arranged and the volume-stirrup ratio is <b>larger</b> <b>enough,</b> the good ductility, carrying capacity, energy dissipation capacity, and seismic behavior still be obtained with high axial compression ratio...|$|R

Because HIP 78530 b's characteristics blend the line between {{whether or not it is}} a brown dwarf or a planet, astronomers have tried to determine what HIP 78530 b is by predicting whether it was created in a planet-like or star-like (how brown dwarves are formed) manner.|$|E

The numerical results show that the behavior of BRCS normalized to that in free space, which indicates the random medium effect on the BRCS, is independent of the polar-ization of incident waves and the body configuration.

40|$|The {{volume flow}} rates of Eyring-fluids inside the wavy-rough nanoannulus were {{obtained}} analytically (up {{to the second}} order) by using the verified model and boundary perturbation method. Our {{results show that the}} wavy-roughness could enhance the flow rate especially for smaller forcing due to the larger surface-to-volume ratio and slip-velocity effect. Meanwhile, the phase shift between the outer and inner walls of nanoannuli could tune the transport of Eyring-fluids either forward or backward when the wavy-roughness of a nanoannulus is <b>larger</b> <b>enough.</b> Our results could be applied to the flow control in nanofluidics as well as biofluidics. ...|$|R
40|$|In image registration, {{a proper}} {{transformation}} should be topology preserving. Especially for landmark-based image registration, if {{the displacement of}} one landmark is <b>larger</b> <b>enough</b> than those of neighbourhood landmarks, topology violation will be occurred. This paper aim to analyse the topology preservation of some Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) which are used to model deformations in image registration. Matérn functions are quite common in the statistic literature (see, e. g. Matern 86,Stein 99). In this paper, we use them to solve the landmark-based image registration problem. We present the topology preservation properties of RBFs in one landmark and four landmarks model respectively. Numerical results of three kinds of Matérn transformations are compared with results of Gaussian, Wendland's, and Wu's functions...|$|R

40|$|This study {{proposes a}} new {{factorization}} method for shape and motion recovery. In past, the fourth greatest singular {{value of the}} measurement matrix was ignored. But when noise is <b>larger</b> <b>enough</b> so that the fourth greatest singular value can not be ignored, {{it would be difficult}} to get reliable results by using the traditional factorization method. In order to acquire reliable results, We start with adopting an orthogonalization method to find a matrix which be composed of three mutually orthogonal vectors. By using this matrix another matrix can be obtained. Then, the two expected matrices which represent shape of object and motion of camera/object, can be obtained through normalization. This study also conducts several experiments to discuss the feasibility of the proposed method...|$|R

40|$|The plateau-non-plateau {{transition}} in the antiferromagnetic-(ferromagnetic) _n polymerized S= 1 / 2 XXZ chains under {{the magnetic field}} is investigated. The universality class of this transition belongs to the Brezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) type. The critical points are determined by level spectroscopy analysis of the numerical diagonalization data for 4 ≤ p ≤ 13 where p(≡ n+ 1) {{is the size of}} a unit cell. It is found that the critical strength of ferromagnetic coupling decreases with p for small p but increases for <b>larger</b> <b>enough</b> p. It is also found that the plateau for large p is wide enough for moderate values of exchange coupling so that it should be easily observed experimentally. This is in contrast to the plateaus for p = 3 chains which are narrow for a wide range of exchange coupling even away from the critical point...|$|R

40|$|Pyrolisis reactions, {{existing}} in explosive components and mixtures, {{are very difficult}} to follow by experiments, because these processes are very fast and proceed with increasing pressure and temperature. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) tests and conventional cook-off methods do not give precise and correct answer to the problem of detecting the life time of chemical explosive or propellant. The method, here presented, is based in experimental analysis correlated with a simple ignition and transition model. The original experimental set-up, presented in an a previous paper, is based in classical thermogravimetry equipment (TGA), recording the evolution of sample weight as a function of temperature, for samples <b>larger</b> <b>enough</b> to solve heterogeneity problems.

40|$|Pulse vaccination, the {{repeated}} application of vaccine over a defined age range, is gaining prominence {{as an effective}} strategy {{for the elimination of}} infectious diseases. An SIR epidemic model with pulse vaccination and distributed time delay is proposed in this paper. Using the discrete dynamical system determined by the stroboscopic map, we obtain the exact infection-free periodic solution of the impulsive epidemic system and prove that the infection-free periodic solution is globally attractive if the vaccination rate is <b>larger</b> <b>enough.</b> Moreover, we show that the disease is uniformly persistent if the vaccination rate is less than some critical value. The permanence of the model is investigated analytically. Our results indicate that a large pulse vaccination rate is sufficient for the eradication of the disease.
