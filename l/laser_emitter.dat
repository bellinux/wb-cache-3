25|$|Besides {{the cost}} of {{implementing}} such a system, SBSP also introduces several technological hurdles, including the problem of transmitting energy from orbit to Earth's surface for use. Since wires extending from Earth's surface to an orbiting satellite are neither practical nor feasible with current technology, SBSP designs generally {{include the use of}} some manner of wireless power transmission and its concomitant conversion inefficiencies, as well as land use concerns for the necessary antenna stations to receive the energy at Earth's surface. The collecting satellite would convert solar energy into electrical energy on board, powering a microwave transmitter or <b>laser</b> <b>emitter,</b> and transmit this energy to a collector (or microwave rectenna) on Earth's surface. Contrary to appearances of SBSP in popular novels and video games, most designs propose beam energy densities that are not harmful if human beings were to be inadvertently exposed, such as if a transmitting satellite's beam were to wander off-course. But the vast size of the receiving antennas that would be necessary would still require large blocks of land near the end users to be procured and dedicated to this purpose. The service life of space-based collectors in the face of challenges from long-term exposure to the space environment, including degradation from radiation and micrometeoroid damage could also become a concern for SBSP.|$|E

50|$|Triangulation based 3D laser {{scanners}} {{are also}} active scanners that use laser light {{to probe the}} environment. With respect to time-of-flight 3D laser scanner the triangulation laser shines a laser on the subject and exploits a camera {{to look for the}} location of the laser dot. Depending on how far away the laser strikes a surface, the laser dot appears at different places in the camera's field of view. This technique is called triangulation because the laser dot, the camera and the <b>laser</b> <b>emitter</b> form a triangle. The length of one side of the triangle, the distance between the camera and the <b>laser</b> <b>emitter</b> is known. The angle of the <b>laser</b> <b>emitter</b> corner is also known. The angle of the camera corner can be determined by looking at the location of the laser dot in the camera's field of view. These three pieces of information fully determine the shape and size of the triangle and give the location of the laser dot corner of the triangle. In most cases a laser stripe, instead of a single laser dot, is swept across the object to speed up the acquisition process. The National Research Council of Canada was among the first institutes to develop the triangulation based laser scanning technology in 1978.|$|E

40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{analysis and}} experimental research of possibility of using commercially available semiconductor laser diodes at low temperatures (down {{to the temperature}} of 50 K) has been performed in the paper. The relevance of this work {{is caused by the}} need to develop sensors for remote measurement of low temperatures on the basis of semiconductor <b>laser</b> <b>emitters.</b> To implement the idea some analysis of wavelength emitted by the semiconductor laser diode as a function of medium temperature has been made. Physical causes that determine this relationship have been discussed. It has been shown that the temperature coefficient of change of the band gap width is a key factor in determining the dependence of the wave length of the laser radiation from the medium temperature. The calculation of numerical values of the temperature coefficient of change of the band gap width for the studied semiconductor laser diodes has been performed. Comparison of the experimental results with the published data has been performed. The temperature coefficient of change of the band gap width for some diode brands has been determined experimentally. It has been shown that in the temperature range 130 ÷ 150 K there is a sharp change in the parameter being analyzed. It has been commented that further studies are needed in this direction to explain possible reasons for the observed effect. To determine the effect of temperature {{on the nature of the}} semiconductor laser diode emission spectrum the emission spectra at several temperatures have been measured. It has been shown that at a certain temperature the semiconductor laser diode can be operated in a single mode.
