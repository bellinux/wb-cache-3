50|$|The <b>Lesser</b> Asiatic <b>Yellow</b> House Bat (Scotophilus kuhlii) {{is smaller}} and leaner than the African Yellow House Bat. The total body length is about 120 mm {{and the average}} body weight is around 16 grams (Siyabona Africa Travel). The forearm length can extend up to 52 mm. A unique {{physical}} characteristic of the <b>Lesser</b> <b>Yellow</b> House Bat is the tail, which is long and covered with the interfemoral membrane between the hind legs. The <b>Lesser</b> Asiatic <b>Yellow</b> House Bat has pointy ears and a dog-like face with a dull muzzle. The <b>Lesser</b> Asiatic <b>Yellow</b> House Bat has soft dense yellowish-brown fur on the back. The abdomen fur is composed of either a white or off-white color (Baker).|$|R

50|$|Noctuid moths {{commonly}} {{begin the}} reproductive season from spring to fall, and mostly are multivoltine, {{such as the}} Eastern Panthea moth (Panthea furcilla), which reproduces over the year.

40|$|A novel {{technique}} for controlling {{cabbage root fly}} was tested. Companion plants of either birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus), red clover (Trifolium pratense) or <b>yellow</b> <b>trefoil</b> (Medicago lupulina) were sown into modules together with calabrese (Brassica oleracea var Italica). The presence of companion plants subsequently reduced cabbage root fly egg-laying by up to 48 % and reduced root damage considerably. Companion plant species did not affect egg-laying in this trial. Although, financially, this technique compares very favourably with an alternative strategy of applying fleece, further refinement is needed to improve the survival of companion plants on a commercial field scale as they were particularly vulnerable to damage by steerage hoes, which are used commonly in organic systems...|$|R
50|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>yellow</b> bat (Scotophilus borbonicus) is a vesper bat {{found only}} on Madagascar and Réunion. On Réunion, it was {{considered}} common early in the 19th century, but was last sighted late in the 19th century. Only a single specimen attributed to this species, collected in 1868, is known from Madagascar. It was listed as a critically endangered species in 1996 due to habitat loss, and may be extinct.|$|R

50|$|Colias chrysotheme, the <b>lesser</b> clouded <b>yellow,</b> {{is a small}} {{butterfly}} {{belonging to}} the family Pieridae. It favors flowered meadows, sparse forests and plains, at altitudes below 2,000 m. The female is white, with a tinge of yellow green.

50|$|During the Cold War, many {{countries}} built fallout shelters for high-ranking {{government officials and}} crucial military facilities, such as Project Greek Island and Cheyenne Mountain nuclear bunker in the United States and Canada's Emergency Government Headquarters. Plans were made, however, to use existing buildings with sturdy below-ground-level basements as makeshift fallout shelters. These buildings were usually placarded with the <b>yellow</b> and black <b>trefoil</b> sign.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{ultrasound}} (US) (40 kHz, 200 W, 3 min), blanching (85 °C, 3. 5 min), {{and the combination}} of both methods was evaluated {{on the quality of}} vacuum-packaged potato strips stored at 3 ± 1 °C for up to 10 days. For this study, two cultivars of potatoes were assessed. For blanched Agata samples, the lightness (L*) decreased over 12 % (p < 0. 05). Moreover, their hue increased up to 100, obtaining <b>lesser</b> <b>yellow</b> potato strips. In contrast, US did not affect the hue values. The losses of firmness of blanched potato strips were notable (35 % for Agata and 51 % for Agria), whereas US did not change this property (p < 0. 05). Nevertheless, {{no significant differences were found}} in the total starch content at 10 days. Agata and Agria showed different metabolic behaviors of sucrose in the refrigerated storage. Therefore, Agria cultivar retained better color after frying. These results suggest that US had less impact on color and improve the firmness in vacuum-packaged potato strips with no added chemicals.
