The development of local cyclones/anticyclones and semi-diurnal atmospheric tides also contribute to these diurnal variations...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{establish}} cephalometric {{norms for}} Chinese using {{the analysis of}} Pancherz (1982), and to compare them with those of Caucasians. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Lateral cephalometric radiographs taken in natural head posture of {{a random sample of}} 200 male and 205 female 12 -year-old southern Chinese together with 43 male and 43 female 12 -year-old British Caucasian children in Hong Kong. The radiographs were digitised twice using the CASSOS program. RESULTS: In males with Pancherz’s sagittal analysis, the position of the maxillary base, mandibular base, mandibular length and molar relationship were significantly <b>larger</b> <b>in</b> Caucasians than in Chinese, while the maxillary central incisor related to point A and mandibular central incisor related to pogonion were significantly <b>larger</b> <b>in</b> Chinese than in Caucasians. In males with Pancherz’s vertical analysis, the overbite was significantly <b>larger</b> <b>in</b> Caucasians than in Chinese while the position of the mandibular central incisor, maxillary and mandibular permanent first molars, nasal plane angle, mandibular plane angle and mandibular occlusal plane angle were significantly <b>larger</b> <b>in</b> Chinese than in Caucasians. For females using Pancherz’s sagittal analysis, the position of the maxillary and mandibular base, maxillary permanent first molar, mandibular length, overjet, jaw relationship and molar relationship were significantly <b>larger</b> <b>in</b> Caucasians than in Chinese, but the maxillary central incisor related to point A and the mandibular central incisor relate to pogonion were significantly <b>larger</b> <b>in</b> Chinese than in Caucasians. In females using Pancherz’s vertical analysis, overbite was significantly <b>larger</b> <b>in</b> Caucasians than in Chinese, but lower face height, the position of the mandibular central incisor, the maxillary and mandibular permanent first molars, nasal plane angle and mandibular plane angle were significantly <b>larger</b> <b>in</b> Chinese than in Caucasians. CONCLUSION: There are significant differences between Chinese and Caucasian using Pancherz’s analysis. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Four {{hundred and}} twenty-one subjects, who were either farmers, {{fishermen}} or stonecutters, {{participated in the}} nutrient survey. They were 236 males and 185 females, aged from 40 to 59. Nutrient intakes and food consumption structures analysed {{by means of the}} questionnaire were compared among the 3 different occupations. In men, the intakes of the rice and soy bean products were statistically significantly <b>larger</b> <b>in</b> the farmers, the fishes <b>larger</b> <b>in</b> the fishermen and the cakes <b>larger</b> <b>in</b> the stonecutters than in any other occupation groups, respectively. In women, the intake of the rice was significantly <b>larger</b> <b>in</b> the farmers and the fats and the oils <b>larger</b> <b>in</b> the fishermen than in any other groups, respectively. The deficiency of the intakes of the fats, calcium, iron and vitamines (A, B 1, B 2 and C) was observed in all 3 groups, and particularly the fat-energic ratio was as small as 16. 6 %. The average amount of daily salt intake was 16. 0 g for men and 15. 7 g for women, which were approximately 4 g above the average amount of the daily salt intake in Japanese. Percentage of recommend dietary allowance was identical among the 3 groups in men, while it was significantly lower in female stone-cutters than in other 2 groups. In men, the protein-energic, the fat-energic and animal protein ratios were significantly <b>larger</b> <b>in</b> the fishermen than in the farmers but not different from those in the stone-cutters. On the other hand, in women, the cereal caloric ratio was <b>larger</b> <b>in</b> the farmers than in other 2 groups and the fat-energic ratio was <b>larger</b> <b>in</b> the fishermen than in the farmers. In conclusion, the food consumption pattern of the stone-cutter group was relatively modern as compared with those of other 2 groups.
