5000|$|This {{species is}} not {{currently}} listed as threatened or endangered, and the {{populations in the}} southern United States {{are thought to be}} secure. Because of this, it is somewhat difficult to find management plans for this species. There has been research done to determine its usefulness in improving the growth of largemouth bass, a popular sporting fish, though {{it does not seem to}} be able to sustain the predator by itself. Since the fish is secure throughout 50% of its range, states like Alabama have listed it as a fish species of lowest concern. There are some areas where the chubsucker has been extirpated, or is at least thought to be, such as in New York. According to their website, New York management includes trying to find extant populations if they are still present. The most important cause of decline in abundance would appear to be siltation due to human practices of agriculture. There do not appear to be any refuges or conservation easements specific to the <b>lake</b> <b>chubsucker</b> as it is not considered endangered. In Canada some research was conducted to determine how the <b>lake</b> <b>chubsucker</b> was faring, since it has been extirpated in several areas. With no further harm and no recovery efforts, it was suggested that the extant <b>lake</b> <b>chubsucker</b> populations would reach minimum viable population standards in about 12 years. Populations of E. sucetta in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia, are listed as secure; Michigan’s is ranked as apparently secure, Texas, Oklahoma, Tennessee, North Carolina, Indiana, and Wisconsin are listed as vulnerable, and the populations of Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Ohio, Virginia, and Ontario are imperiled. The fish is presumed extirpated in Iowa and Pennsylvania.|$|E
50|$|The <b>lake</b> <b>chubsucker</b> {{is found}} in North America in the Great Lakes and Mississippi River basin lowlands. Its range extends from {{southern}} Ontario to the Gulf of Mexico, west to Wisconsin and Texas, and east to southern Virginia and southern Florida. In Canada it {{is thought to have}} been extirpated from Jeanette’s Creek and areas of Big Creek and Tea Creek. In the US it has been extirpated from areas of southern Illinois, Iowa, and Pennsylvania. It is also declining in abundance in Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Ohio. This decline in abundance is largely due to habitat modification or destruction, such as changing the level of turbidity of the water, changing sedimentation levels, introducing exotic, invasive species, altering nutrient levels, and introducing toxins. In some of these areas, {{it is possible that the}} fish is still around in small numbers, but it is very difficult to collect and therefore hard to establish extirpation conclusively.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>lake</b> <b>chubsucker</b> (Erimyzon sucetta) is a {{freshwater}} fish endemic to North America, being {{found in the}} Great Lakes and the Mississippi River basin, {{as far north as}} Ontario, Canada, extending south to the Gulf of Mexico. It is mostly found in lakes, ponds, and swamps, rarely in streams. It is a {{freshwater fish}}, and intermediate level consumer as it feeds on benthic detritus. More specifically it eats microcrustacea and midge larvae. Its average length is 25.8 cm. E. sucetta reportedly scatters its eggs randomly over aquatic vegetation and submerged grass in ponds [...] or over gravelly areas cleared by males. While the chubsucker is not in acute danger, 50% of its current range is secure, it is facing some difficulties because of siltation caused by agricultural practices. It can also be affected by coal ash spills, both directly by decreased swimming performance and indirectly by decreased energy resources available to it after release of coal ash into its environment. This being said, its range has declined in many states like Missouri, Arkansas, Ohio, and possibly even Tennessee.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>lake</b> <b>chubsucker</b> {{is found}} in warmer waters, {{approximately}} 28°-34°C. Other specifications include clear, still water, with low turbidity. A high level of vegetative cover is also often present, often more than 70% coverage. Wetlands, ponds, and floodplain lakes are areas where the chubsucker is typically found. It is a benthic fish, preferring shallow, freshwater. They are found where the lakes have sand or silt mixed with organic debris. The chubsucker is an omnivore, eating both vegetation and invertebrates, such as small crustaceans, chironomid larvae, and algae. [...] Vegetation can make up to 70% of its diet. When chubsuckers are small (83-103mm) filamentous algae had a 100% occurrence, cladocerans and chironomid larvae had a 25%, and copepods a 13% occurrence. However, when they are larger, (127-152mm) copepods becomes more important with a 50% occurrence, followed by algae with a 25% occurrence, and cladocera, ostracods, and chironomid larvae all had 13% occurrences. Its predators include largemouth bass (‘’Micropterus salmoides’’), and other basses, Humans {{have the power to}} interfere with the chubsucker, {{particularly when it comes to}} coal combustion. Studies performed by Snodgrass et al. showed that although mortality rates did not necessarily significantly increase in the presence of coal combustion by-products, altered swimming performance, as well as increased toxin levels given less food availability, were both side effects of living in contaminated waters. Other activities, such as building dams, which dramatically changes the siltation levels of the chubsucker habitat, also negatively affect the abundance of the fish.|$|E
40|$|Lake chubsuckers (Erimyzon sucetta (Girard)) were {{introduced}} into two ponds {{to examine their}} suitability as a sustainable forage for largemouth bass (Micropterns salmoides (Lacepede)). A summary of <b>lake</b> <b>chubsucker</b> suitability followed the criteria of Bennett and Childers (1966). Lake chubsuckers were capable of growing larger than the size range for predation by most largemouth bass, however, their growth rate made them vulnerable to largemouth bass for several years. Young of the lake chubsuckers were not available as forage for age 0 largemouth bass. Even though lake chubsuckers possess round bodies and soft rayed fins, this was not demonstrated to be a superior attribute. Lake chubsuckers {{were not able to}} maintain a viable population of adults in combination with dominant largemouth bass. <b>Lake</b> <b>chubsucker</b> diets revealed neither predation on largemouth bass eggs or fry nor competition with various sized largemouth bass for food. Mean annual measures of selected physical, chemical and biological characteristics of the fish habitat indicated significant changes in total alkalinity, Secchi disk transparency and surface coverage by rooted aquatic macrophytes. It was concluded lake chubsuckers were not directly responsible for these changes. In this study lake chubsuckefs did not significantly improve largemouth bass growth...|$|E
40|$|Electrofishing catch {{per unit}} effort (CPUE) data are {{commonly}} used to index temporal trends in abundance in fish monitoring programs, but the reliability of this index requires {{the assumption that the}} fraction of fish stock caught per unit effort (catchability, q) is relatively precise and constant through time. A wide range of biological, environmental, and technical factors can affect catchability, potentially violating these assumptions. To understand if CPUE data can be used to index abundance through time for Florida lakes, I evaluated how electrofishing catchability varies temporally with different biotic and abiotic factors in five small lakes in north central Florida. I also evaluated the influence of variable electrofishing catchability on the ability of a monitoring program to detect a true change in abundance in response to a perturbation, such as could occur following changes in water levels or disruption to vegetation via hurricane using a simulation. Lastly, I evaluated the effect of submersed aquatic vegetation on mean electrofishing catchability using a series of hatchery ponds. Electrofishing catchability in the lakes study varied season, lake, and species. Catchability was higher but substantially more variable for largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides and <b>lake</b> <b>chubsucker</b> Erimyzon sucetta than for bluegill Lepomis macrochirus. Catchability was highly variable between years in the same season for both largemouth bass and <b>lake</b> <b>chubsucker</b> in some of the lakes, which could preclude the use of CPUE as a reliable index of abundance. Catchability for bluegill was low but precise; indicating that electrofishing CPUE could monitor abundance for this species. Simulation results revealed that statistical power decreased and the Type-I error rate (i. e., the probability of detecting a difference when in fact no difference occurred) increased substantially if q varies through time as I observed for largemouth bass and <b>lake</b> <b>chubsucker.</b> Type-I error rates were well above the expected value of 0. 05, reaching as high as 0. 7 for largemouth bass and 0. 6 for <b>lake</b> <b>chubsucker</b> at high sample sizes. This resulted because increasing sample size improves the ability to detect real changes, but also increases the probability of detecting spurious changes due to variable q (i. e., Type-I error). Thus, variable catchability hinders our ability to use CPUE data to index trends in fish abundance. Mean electrofishing catchability in the hatchery pond study showed no difference between the pond treatments, indicating that relatively high coverages of submersed aquatic plants had no substantial influence on average electrofishing catchability. Mean catchability was higher for largemouth bass than bluegill, similar to the lake results. Mean catchability was more variable for both largemouth bass and bluegill in ponds with abundant vegetation than in those with low aquatic plant abundance. This suggests that abundant vegetation does not influence average q values, but it does increase the variability in electrofishing catchability and thus could increase the uncertainty in CPUE data used to index fish abundance. These results indicated that variable electrofishing catchability hinders our ability to detect trends in abundance using CPUE data for two of the three species I evaluated. Further research should evaluate the temporal variability in electrofishing catchability and explore alternate sampling methods and data sources for their reliability for monitoring fishery trends...|$|E

40|$|In 1998 and 2000, we sampled {{small stream}} fish {{communities}} at 67 sites {{to evaluate the}} status of nongame fish species in the Greater Rock River Basin. Forty-five sites were located in the Lower Rock River sub-basin and twenty-two sites in the Sugar-Pecatonica River sub-basin. All of the sites were originally sampled {{as part of the}} Fish Distribution Study during the 1970 ’s. Most of the stream sites had not been sampled since that time. Survey results indicated a decline in species richness, intolerant species and species listed as Endangered Resources. Species that were found in 1974 - 75 but not in 1998 and 2000 included blackchin shiner (Notropis heterodon), ozark minnow (Notropis nubila), redfin shiner (Lythrurus umbratilis), <b>lake</b> <b>chubsucker</b> (Erimyzon sucetta) and rainbow darter (Etheostoma caeruleum). The number of locations supporting redside dace (Clinostomus elongatus), banded killifish (Fundulus diaphanus) and least darter (Etheostoma microperca) declined as well. The reasons for these declines can encompass water quality, physical habitat degradation and competition with exotic species. However, expanding livestock operations during the 1970 ’s and 1980 ’s may also be a contributing factor as several of the sites showing a decline in species are small streams with documented animal waste management problems...|$|E
