25|$|Grey {{noise is}} random white noise {{subjected}} to a psychoacoustic equal loudness curve (such as an inverted A-weighting curve) over a given range of frequencies, giving the listener the perception that it is equally loud at all frequencies.

25|$|The UV Index is a <b>linear</b> <b>scale,</b> {{with higher}} values {{representing}} {{a greater risk}} of sunburn (which is correlated with other health risks) due to UV exposure. An index of 0 corresponds to zero UV radiation, as is essentially the case at night. An index of 10 corresponds roughly to midday summer sunlight with a clear sky when the UV Index was originally designed, now summertime index values in the teens are common for tropical latitudes, mountainous altitudes, and areas with above-average ozone layer depletion.|$|E
40|$|International audienceDensity {{functional}} theory calculations are computationally extremely {{expensive for}} systems containing many atoms {{due to their}} intrinsic cubic scaling. This fact {{has led to the}} development of so-called <b>linear</b> <b>scaling</b> algorithms during the last few decades. In this way it becomes possible to perform ab initio calculations for several tens of thousands of atoms within reasonable walltimes. However, even though the use of <b>linear</b> <b>scaling</b> algorithms is physically well justified, their implementation often introduces some small errors. Consequently most implementations offering such a linear complexity either yield only a limited accuracy or, if one wants to go beyond this restriction, require a tedious fine tuning of many parameters. In our <b>linear</b> <b>scaling</b> approach within the BigDFT package, we were able to overcome this restriction. Using an ansatz based on localized support functions expressed in an underlying Daubechies wavelet basis -which offers ideal properties for accurate <b>linear</b> <b>scaling</b> calculations -we obtain an amazingly high accuracy and a universal applicability while still keeping the possibility of simulating large system with <b>linear</b> <b>scaling</b> walltimes requiring only a moderate demand of computing resources. We prove the effectiveness of our method on a wide variety of systems with different boundary conditions, for single-point calculations as well as for geometry optimizations and molecular dynamics...|$|R

25|$|LogMAR {{is another}} {{commonly}} used scale, expressed as the (decadic) logarithm {{of the minimum}} angle of resolution (MAR). The LogMAR scale converts the geometric sequence of a traditional chart to a <b>linear</b> <b>scale.</b> It measures visual acuity loss: positive values indicate vision loss, while negative values denote normal or better visual acuity. This scale is rarely used clinically; it is more frequently used in statistical calculations because it provides a more scientific equivalent for the traditional clinical statement of “lines lost” or “lines gained”, which is valid only when all steps between lines are equal, which is not usually the case.|$|E
25|$|In {{mathematical}} terms, the Hausdorff dimension generalizes {{the notion}} of the dimension of a real vector space. That is, the Hausdorff dimension of an n-dimensional inner product space equals n. This underlies the earlier statement that the Hausdorff dimension of a point is zero, of a line is one, etc., and that irregular sets can have noninteger Hausdorff dimensions. For instance, the Koch curve summarized earlier is constructed from an equilateral triangle; in each iteration, its component line segments are divided into 3 segments of unit length, the newly created middle segment is used as the base of a new equilateral triangle that points outward, and this base segment is then deleted to leave a final object from the iteration of unit length of 4. That is, after the first iteration, each original line segment has been replaced with N=4, where each self-similar copy is 1/S = 1/3 as long as the original. Stated another way, we have taken an object with Euclidean dimension, D, and reduced its <b>linear</b> <b>scale</b> by 1/3 in each direction, so that its length increases to N=SD. This equation is easily solved for D, yielding the ratio of logarithms (or natural logarithms) appearing in the figures, and giving—in the Koch and other fractal cases—non-integer dimensions for these objects.|$|E
25|$|For example, some {{theoretical}} planet orbiting about 1.25 AU from Alpha CentauriA (so {{that the}} star appears roughly {{as bright as}} the Sun viewed from the Earth) would see Alpha CentauriB orbit the entire sky once roughly every one year and three months (or 1.3(4) a), the planet's own orbital period. Added to {{this would be the}} changing apparent position of Alpha CentauriB during its long eighty-year elliptical orbit with respect to Alpha CentauriA. (The average speed, at 4.5 degrees per Earth year, is comparable in speed to Uranus here. With the eccentricity of the orbit, the maximum speed near periapse, about 18 degrees per Earth year, is faster than Saturn, but slower than Jupiter. The minimum speed near apoapse, about 1.8 degrees per Earth year, is slower than Neptune.) Depending on its and the planet's position on their respective orbits, Alpha Centauri B would vary in apparent magnitude between −18.2 (dimmest) and −21.0 (brightest). These visual apparent magnitudes are much dimmer than the apparent magnitude of the Sun as viewed from the Earth (−26.7). The difference of 5.7 to 8.6 magnitudes means Alpha CentauriB would appear, on a <b>linear</b> <b>scale,</b> 2500 to 190 times dimmer than Alpha CentauriA (or the Sun viewed from the Earth), but also 190 to 2500 times brighter than the full Moon as seen from the Earth (−12.5).|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{extension}} of density matrix based <b>linear</b> <b>scaling</b> electronic structure theory to incorporate spin degrees of freedom. When the spin multiplicity of the system can be predetermined, the generalization of the existing <b>linear</b> <b>scaling</b> methods to spin unrestricted cases is straightforward.
