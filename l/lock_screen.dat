25|$|Android {{distributions}} {{by other}} manufacturers typically use different <b>lock</b> <b>screen</b> designs than what stock Android utilizes; newer versions of HTC's Sense used a metallic ring dragged {{from the bottom}} of the screen to unlock the phone, and also allows users to launch apps by dragging their respective shortcut icon into the ring instead. On recent Samsung devices, the <b>lock</b> <b>screen</b> involves dragging in any direction from any location on the screen (with TouchWiz Nature devices, such as the Galaxy S III and S4, it is also accompanied by a visual effect such as a pond ripple or lens flare); similarly to HTC's <b>lock</b> <b>screen,</b> app shortcuts can be dragged up {{from the bottom of}} the screen to unlock directly into them.|$|E
25|$|At first, Android {{did not use}} a gesture-based <b>lock</b> <b>screen,</b> electing to just {{require the}} user to press the phone's Menu button. On Android 2.0, a new gesture-based <b>lock</b> <b>screen</b> was introduced, {{displaying}} two icons: one for unlocking the phone, and one for setting the volume mode, activated by dragging the relevant icon {{to the center of}} the screen on a curve (similarly to a rotary dial). On Android 2.1, the rotary dial was replaced by two tabs on either end of the screen. Android 3.0 introduced a new design: a ball with a padlock icon is dragged to the outside of a circular area. On 4.0, the option to unlock straight to the camera is provided, while 4.1 adds the ability to unlock into a Google Search screen by dragging up. Android 4.2 makes additional changes to the <b>lock</b> <b>screen,</b> allowing users to add widgets to pages accessible on the <b>lock</b> <b>screen</b> by swiping from the left edge of the screen. The camera is accessed in a similar manner by swiping from the right edge of the screen. Android also allows devices to be locked using a password, passcode, a pattern on a grid of 9 circles, fingerprint sensing, or with facial recognition.|$|E

25|$|A <b>lock</b> <b>screen</b> is a {{computer}} user interface element used by various operating systems. They regulate immediate access to a device by requiring that the user perform a certain action {{in order to receive}} access, such as entering a password, using a certain button combination, or performing a certain gesture using a device's touchscreen. While most lock functions on PC operating systems only utilize a login screen, lock screens on mobile devices often provide more functionality beyond unlocking the phone: such as notifications for emails and text messages, a date and time display, or shortcuts to certain applications.|$|E

25|$|The usual {{technique}} for authorities, either public entities such as law enforcement or private organizations like companies, seizing a computer (usually a laptop) {{that they believe}} is being used improperly is to first physically separate the suspect user from the computer enough {{that he or she}} cannot touch it, to prevent them from closing its lid, unplugging it or typing a command. Once they have done so, they often install a device in the USB port that spoofs minor actions of a mouse, touchpad or keyboard, preventing the computer from going into sleep mode, from which it would usually return to a <b>lock</b> <b>screen</b> which would require a password. One program commonly used for this purpose is Mouse Jiggler.|$|E
25|$|Operating {{systems that}} run on {{smartphones}} and tablets typically use a gestures based lock-screen. Mobiles manufactured by Neonode were unlocked by swiping to the right on its touchscreen. Apple's iOS, used by the iPhone and iPad lines, utilizes a similar unlock mechanism using an on-screen slider widget to the right. Beginning on iOS 5, sliding {{in the other direction}} sends the user directly to the camera app. On iOS 7, the slider widget was removed {{as part of a larger}} overhaul of the iOS interface, and users can now swipe from any point of the screen. The <b>lock</b> <b>screen</b> also displays a clock, notifications, and provides audio playback controls. In iOS 10 the slide to unlock feature was replaced with the Press Home to Unlock feature.|$|E

It maintains a whitelist of devices allowed to connect to the computer's USB ports; if a device not on that whitelist connects, it can take actions ranging from merely returning to the <b>lock</b> <b>screen</b> to encrypting the hard drive, or even deleting all the data on it. However, it can also be used as part of a computer security regime to prevent the surreptitious installment of malware or spyware or the clandestine duplication of files, according to its creator.|$|E

Critics argued that this change was meant to discourage Windows 10 Pro from being used in business environments, since Microsoft was making it less attractive by reducing the amount of control administrators have over their devices' environment without using an enterprise version of Windows 10.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of iOS 10 {{were mostly}} positive. Reviewers {{highlighted}} the significant updates to iMessage, Siri, Photos, 3D Touch, and the <b>lock</b> <b>screen</b> as welcome changes.

The HTC First {{was also the first}} smartphone to include the recently acquired Instagram as a pre-loaded app. Although support for Facebook Home {{is not limited to the}} HTC First (it was also released for select HTC and Samsung models as well, and the Chat Heads feature was added to the standalone Facebook Messenger app), integration with certain system functions (such as the ability to display non-Facebook notifications on the <b>lock</b> <b>screen)</b> is exclusive to the First due to technical limitations.|$|E
500|$|In July 2013, HTC began {{rolling out}} an upgrade to Android 4.2.2 in {{selected}} regions; alongside internal changes, it added a quick settings panel to the notification area, Instagram support for BlinkFeed, auto focus/auto exposure lock to the camera, additional Highlights themes, and optimized how Zoes are saved (producing a static JPG and a MP4 video file, instead of saving each frame {{as a separate}} image file). The upgrade also added the ability to show the current battery percentage on the status bar, more consistent behavior for the home key, allows the removal of icons from the home screen’s dock, allows the Home key {{to serve as the}} deprecated [...] "Menu" [...] key in certain apps by long-pressing (in lieu of displaying it on a black bar on-screen), allows Google Now to be accessed by swiping up from the home button, and adds support for displaying widgets on the <b>lock</b> <b>screen</b> (however, unlike stock Android, only one widget can be placed on the <b>lock</b> <b>screen</b> at a time).|$|E

500|$|Engadgets Devindra Hardawar {{wrote that}} iOS 10 is Apple [...] "basically {{polishing}} a pearl".

He wrote that the <b>lock</b> <b>screen</b> is now [...] "far more customizable than before". He praised the new features added to 3D Touch, writing that it [...] "finally feels useful", where he likes that [...] "3D Touch works in almost every part of the OS". In regard to iMessage, he wrote that it has new features that are [...] "particularly useful", including [...] "Invisible ink" [...] that obscures text in a conversation when others might be looking, but criticized the user interface, writing that it [...] "needs some work". The [...] "Memories" [...] feature in the new Photos app [...] "usually turned out well", but wrote that [...] "they're still clearly a work in progress". Hardawar praised the new Apple Music app, but added that [...] "really, anything is better than the last iteration". He also liked lyrics support. He wrote that Siri's third-party support was [...] "actually starting to get useful", but did run into accuracy issues. He finished by writing that although iOS 10 does add features seen in Google's Android operating system before, the mobile industry is [...] "shamelessly getting [...] "inspired" [...] by the competition". His summary states that [...] "iOS 10 is a collection of useful changes to an already solid OS".|$|E
5000|$|The N900's {{proximity}} sensor, {{which is}} designed to <b>lock</b> the touch <b>screen</b> when the phone is against the user's ear to prevent accidental operation, <b>locks</b> the <b>screen</b> unintentionally in bright light (usually outdoors) when a call is placed or received.

To unlock the screen in a phone call, a tactile unlock switch in {{the right side of the}} device can be used. This however will keep the touch screen active and accidental operation of the phone keys in a call may occur when device is used as a handset.

Before, it was normal to leave your house unlocked, but soon residents started locking doors, pulling down shades, blocking windows, and arming themselves with guns. Some people would nail sheets over their windows or nail the window down. Some used screened-door braces as window guards. The next day after Starks' death, several residents bought firearms and locks. Stores sold out of locks, guns, ammunition, and window shades and Venetian blinds.
