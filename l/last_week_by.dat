Stewart criticized Comedy Central's decision to alter the episode, while simultaneously acknowledging they likely did so to protect their employees from [...] "possible harmful repercussions". Bill Maher, host of the HBO talk show Real Time with Bill Maher, said the threats against [...] "201" [...] demonstrated {{the importance of the}} First Amendment and other American civil liberties, and said, [...] "When South Park got threatened <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>by</b> Islamists incensed at their depiction of Muhammad, it served—or should serve—as a reminder that our culture isn't just different than one that makes death threats to cartoonists. It's better." [...] He added jokingly, [...] "If you don't get that, and you still want to kill someone over a stupid cartoon, please make it Garfield." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his junior}} year, Petoskey {{was one of}} the {{favorite}} pass receivers for [...] quarterback Harry Newman, who won the Douglas Fairbanks trophy as the Most Valuable Player in college football. [...] Coach Harry Kipke shifted Petoskey to fullback midway through the 1932 season, and he scored two touchdowns in a 32–0 win over Illinois. [...] The United Press noted: [...] "A running attack which featured Ted Petoskey, converted from an end to a fullback in the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>by</b> Coach Harry Kipke dovetailed nicely with the Wolverine aerial play to produce the touchdowns. [...] With Petoskey plunging the line and sweeping inside the ends for many sizeable gains, the Michigan eleven showed power through the line {{for the first time this}} season." [...] An Associated Press writer warned opponents to watch out for Petoskey: [...] "It is about time for grid foeman to wake up when Ted Petoskey, end and fullback on the University of Michigan football team, gets to dreaming. [...] Petoskey's dreams have a habit of coming true, and happily for Petoskey, most of his dreams are good ones." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1944, Rifenburg {{enrolled}} at the University of Michigan. The United Press syndicate ran a feature article about Rifenburg in September 1944 that opened as follows: [...] "Another great end has made his appearance on the Big Ten football horizon {{in the person of}} Dick Rifenburg, 18-year-old Michigan freshman. Every so often a great offensive end comes along, a player who has to learn how to play defense, but who has the natural speed, smooth actions, height and big hands that is the mark of an outstanding pass receiver. Rifenburg has laid claim to that rating. A loose-limbed 180-pound freshman from Saginaw, Mich., Rifenberg is being boomed as the Big Ten's next 'freshman sensation.'" [...] As a freshman, he caught two touchdown passes in his first college football game against Iowa. In an article titled [...] "Teens and TNT," [...] Time reported on Rifenburg's performance: [...] "Of the few teams already in action, Michigan's teens rang the freshman bell loudest <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>by</b> winning their opener, 12 -to-7, against the strong Iowa Seahawks (Naval Pre-Flight); 6-ft. 4 Freshman End Dick Rifenburg caught passes and ran for both Michigan touchdowns." ...|$|E

6000|$|In {{the face}} of such efforts as these, {{opposition}} itself melted rapidly away. The Plutorian Times was soon able to announce that various undesirable candidates were abandoning the field.

Mr. Gorfinkel stated that he should not offer himself as a candidate in the approaching election. He was, he said, weary of civic honours. He had had enough. He felt it incumbent on him to step out and make way for others who deserved their turn as well as himself: in future he proposed to confine his whole attention to his Misfit Semi-Ready Establishment which he was happy to state was offering as nobby a line of early fall suiting as was ever seen at the price." ...|$|E

The case was concerned with a will, and possessed some features of interest.
