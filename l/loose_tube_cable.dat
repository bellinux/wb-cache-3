40|$|Cabling of {{dispersion}} compensating tibres (DCF) {{has been}} examined {{for the first}} time. The micro and macro bending performance has been evaluated and compared to standard non-shifted single mode fibres (SSMF). At 1550 nm, {{it is found that}} the macro bending performance of DCF is comparable to SSMF. At 1550 nm, the micro bending performance is better for DCF than SSMF. The wavelength dependence of both macro and micro bending loss is much steeper for DCF than SSMF. The DCF has been cabled in a <b>loose</b> <b>tube</b> <b>cable</b> with good result. Compared to measurement on fibre spools, the attenuation dropped both at 1550 and 1580 nm on all fibres. On five out of six fibres, the PMD dropped as well. The cable was temperature cycled between - 40 and 70 �C without any significant change in attenuation...|$|E

5000|$|Another type {{of design}} uses four {{glass-reinforced}} plastic strength member strands, and <b>loose</b> buffer <b>tubes</b> <b>cabled</b> into an assembly and {{protected by a}} jacket. This is more flexible than the outer cylinder type first described, but does not provide as much protection to the fibers.|$|R
50|$|The strain margin {{requirements}} tend to favour cable designs using multiple <b>loose</b> <b>tubes.</b> Tight-buffer <b>cable</b> designs {{do not provide}} sufficient strain margin and the optical fibre transmission performance is compromised under strong winds, heavy ice accretions and at high temperatures. In cables based on a single <b>loose</b> <b>tube</b> design, the optical fibres have too much freedom of movement along the cable axis. Consequently, mechanical {{energy in the form}} of wind-induced vibration of the host conductor causes the optical fibres to move gradually ‘downhill’ and allowing the excess fibre length to collect in the low point of the span. This uneven distribution of excess fibre length compromises the optical performance of the cable with increased optical attenuation at low temperatures in the relatively crowded sections of tube in the middle of spans and at high temperatures where the fibres are under strain at the high sections close to the towers. These problems are worse on longer spans.|$|R
50|$|<b>Loose</b> <b>Tubes</b> is {{the debut}} album by English jazz <b>Loose</b> <b>Tubes.</b> It was {{released}} in 1985 as an LP on <b>Loose</b> <b>Tubes</b> Limited. The recording has never been reissued on CD.|$|R
40|$|Optical fibre cables {{are made}} by placing optical fibres inside a <b>loose</b> <b>tube</b> packed with a water based gel, and then winding these <b>loose</b> <b>tubes</b> on to a central {{strength}} member in helically wound sections of alternating twist separated by reversing sections. The length of the <b>loose</b> <b>tubes</b> and their position on the strength member was modelled along with an analysis of where the optical fibres lie in the <b>loose</b> <b>tubes...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} protect the stay cable and to {{construct}} it easily in Cable-stayed Bridge, the cable ends are equipped with <b>cable</b> <b>tubes.</b> The dip and the coordinates of <b>cable</b> <b>tubes</b> lying in the main beam are changing in the process of cantilever cradle construction. The theoretical orientation parameters must be corrected during construction to ensure that the <b>cable</b> <b>tube</b> coordinates with the cable. Aimed at obtaining alignment parameters of the <b>cable</b> <b>tubes,</b> the paper analyzed the various factors affecting <b>cable</b> <b>tube</b> positioning and the importance of them, derived correction formula of <b>cable</b> <b>tubes</b> positioning and elucidated it with dip and the coordinates correction, verified the calculation combining with Nan Ping Bridge engineering practice...|$|R
