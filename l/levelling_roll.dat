40|$|An {{experimental}} study using a passenger ride quality apparatus (PRQA) {{was conducted to}} determine the subjective reactions of passengers to roll vibrations. The data obtained illustrate the effect upon human comfort of several roll-vibration parameters: namely, <b>roll</b> acceleration <b>level,</b> <b>roll</b> frequency, and seat location (i. e., distance from axis of rotation). Results of {{an analysis of variance}} indicated that seat location had no effect on discomfort ratings of roll vibrations. The effect of <b>roll</b> acceleration <b>level</b> was significant, and discomfort ratings increased markedly with increasing <b>roll</b> acceleration <b>level</b> at all <b>roll</b> frequencies investigated. Of particular interest, {{is the fact that the}} relationship between discomfort ratings and <b>roll</b> acceleration <b>level</b> was linear in nature. The effect of roll frequency also was significant as was the interaction between <b>roll</b> acceleration <b>level</b> and <b>roll</b> frequency...|$|R

40|$|A {{randomised}} complete {{block design}} {{was used to}} study the effects on animal performance of (1) the increasing level of supplementary concentrate with grass silage (GS), and (2) feeding GS and concentrates separately or as a total mixed ration (TMR). A feeding experiment comprised 32 dairy bulls with average initial live weight of 145 kg. The feeding treatments were: (1) GS (660 g kg- 1 dry matter intake) plus medium <b>level</b> of <b>rolled</b> barley (330) offered separately, (2) GS (660) plus medium <b>level</b> of <b>rolled</b> barley (330) offered as TMR, (3) GS (330) plus high <b>level</b> of <b>rolled</b> barley (660) offered separately, and (4) GS (330) plus high <b>level</b> of <b>rolled</b> barley (660) offered as TMR. During the experiment (398 days) the bulls were fed ad libitum either GS or TMR. The increasing concentrate level increased energy intake, carcass gain and dressing proportion of the bulls but had no effects on carcass conformation or fat score. TMR feeding had no effects on carcass gain, dressing proportion, carcass conformation or fat score but increased dry matter and energy intake compared to the separate feeding...|$|R

From this the pilot can tell whether the wings are <b>level</b> (<b>roll)</b> and if the aircraft nose is pointing above or below the horizon (pitch). This is a primary instrument for instrument flight and is also useful in conditions of poor visibility. Pilots are trained to use other instruments in combination should this instrument or its power fail.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT One hundred eight-day old {{meat type}} chicks were {{randomly}} allotted into {{a control group}} and four music exposure treatment groups as follows: high level dinner music, low level dinner music, low <b>level</b> rock and <b>roll</b> music, and high <b>level</b> rock and <b>roll</b> music. Low <b>level</b> music reached a maximum decibel reading of 70 and high level music a maximum reading of 85. Feed consumption by group and individual weights were determined weekly during a nine-week feeding period. Feed consumption by groups was very similar and did not indicate any apparent tranquilizing effect or stress associated with treatments. Final live weight and carcass weight of the high <b>level</b> rock and <b>roll</b> group were somewhat less heavy than the others with the difference between low level dinner (1491 g.) and high <b>level</b> rock and <b>roll</b> (1398 g.) approaching statistical significance (P <. 1) ...|$|R
