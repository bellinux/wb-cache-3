30|$|It is {{well-known}} that efficient p-type doping in ZnO thin films is extremely hard partially {{due to the}} very limited dopant solubility in high-quality lattice [1, 2]. Dopants are found to distribute along grain boundaries possibly due to the relatively degraded crystalline quality there. Grain boundaries would form low-resistive electrical channels, and the carrier transport is thus dominated by them, which has no practical significance [3]. However, micro-/nanostructured ZnO materials may provide an alternative to realize considerable doping efficiency by utilizing abundant surface areas. Similar as grain boundaries in thin films, surface areas in micro-/nanostructured ZnO are more chemically active, which results in <b>lowered</b> <b>formation</b> <b>energies</b> for impurities or defects.

The proposed structures for Sb and As are large-gap semiconductors that are potentially interesting for applications in future nanodevices. The Bi structures have nontrivial topological properties with a large and direct nontrivial band gap. The nontrivial gap is shown to arise from a band inversion at the Brillouin zone center due to the strong intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in Bi atoms.

The T-site has a barrier of 0. 48 eV, whereas the DB-site has no barrier for the interstitial to penetrate into the crystal from the vacuum.

Comparative ab initio pseudopotential calculations for Pt and Pt_ 2 on the stoichiometric and reduced TiO 2 surfaces, and oxygen vacancy (V_O) formation energies are performed to address the microscopic origin of this finding.

Since Pt-Bi is considered as a new critical charge-transfer pair for superconductivity, it inspired us to investigate the Sr-Pt-Bi system.

First-principles calculations show that it has <b>lower</b> <b>formation</b> <b>energies</b> than the prototype GBs adopted widely in previous studies.
