40|$|One typical {{approach}} {{to characterize the}} experimental dynamic behaviour of a mechanical system is performing experimental modal analysis. Different practical methodologies are available and depend on the specific mechanical system. In the case of mechanical transmissions several challenges need to be overcome. Among the most important are: - Lack of physical space within the transmission to host the instruments, since the transmission is typically enclosed in a housing which retains lubricant and whose overall packaging volume is kept to a minimum; - Acquisition of signals from rotating components if the analysis {{has to be done}} in operating conditions; - Correctly capturing the non-linear effects introduced by gear and bearing contact, also affected by clearance, and by coupling elements, often made of elastomeric material. To address these points, besides other aspects, the authors have developed a precision gear test rig to evaluate the dynamic behaviour of a gear pair system in tightly controlled operating conditions (applied <b>load,</b> <b>centre</b> <b>distance,</b> misalignments) and for a set of tooth microgeometry modifications. Furthermore the relative stiffness between the gears and the shafts can be adjusted in order to evaluate the effects of structural coupling. In this paper, an outline of modal analysis experiments will be provided along with a discussion of the uncertain boundary conditions at connections between components. Modal analysis has been performed on the test rig first at a component level in free-free conditions, then at a sub-assembly level and finally at the full assembly level. The effects of gear meshing, bearings and couplings have been evaluated for mode shapes and natural frequencies. Although there is substantial structural coupling between the gears and the shaft bending modes, it is observed that the dynamic response of the gear pair is dominated by the first torsional mode due to the elastic deflection of gear teeth. status: publishe...|$|E

Energy consumption per person is also rising tremendously in developing countries. However, installing a new power plant cannot be a solution every time.

40|$|Overcut means tip {{interference}} of a pinion and {{an internal}} gear outside {{the line of}} action. Until 1969, the phenomenon was described by an involute theory with fixed <b>centre</b> <b>distance,</b> either kinematically [1. [...] 6] or geometrically [8]. The cutting process was neglected or confused with radial assembly. Inspired by a partly correct comment in [4], the mystery of tip interference [9] was solved by a study of interference at changing <b>centre</b> <b>distance</b> [10, 11]. Now, the theory includes the cutting process when the cutter moves in an arbitrary direction (oblique retraction). A reference <b>centre</b> <b>distance</b> defines a cycloidal tip curve, whilst a conjugate <b>centre</b> <b>distance</b> defines the generated involute that recovers the excavation of the reference cycloid. The conjugation of <b>centre</b> <b>distances</b> provides an effective mathematical tool, which is developed into easy computation procedures...|$|R

40|$|Quietness and reliability, {{together}} with efficiency and lightweight design, are key requirements {{to compete in}} current mechanical industry. Within the latter, gearboxes {{play an important role}} as the usual choice to transmit mechanical power with high energy density, especially when using cylindrical involute gears. Noise and vibration performance are strongly influenced by tooth microgeometry modifications. Typical modifications are applied along the profile and the lead of the teeth. Profile modifications mainly compensate for tooth deflections; lead modifications mainly compensate for angular misalignments. Both modification types yield optimal performance at a given operating condition (e. g. nominal transmitted torque under ideal alignment), minimizing the meshing excitation. One key operating condition for the gear pair is represented by the instantaneous <b>centre</b> <b>distance</b> between the gears. <b>Centre</b> <b>distance</b> variations affect mainly the pressure angle for the transmitted contact force, the total contact ratio and the active tooth height. Furthermore after a change in <b>centre</b> <b>distance,</b> the contacting surfaces on the tooth flanks shift with respect to each other; this yields a mismatch with respect to the theoretical start for the tooth profile modifications. A precision gear test rig, where operating conditions can be varied and tightly controlled, is used in this paper to evaluate the effects of <b>centre</b> <b>distance</b> variations on the dynamic behaviour of a spur gear pair. The dynamic behaviour is characterized relying on the so-called Static Transmission Error (STE). Spectral analysis of the STE provides an indication of the internal excitation generated by gear meshing. Results show that the STE is sensitive to small changes in <b>centre</b> <b>distance</b> (in the order of 0. 1 % of the nominal value). In particular, it is also observed that the transmitted torque for obtaining minimum STE peak to peak value changes significantly {{as a function of the}} <b>centre</b> <b>distance.</b> status: submitte...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—To {{provide a}} quality and secured power supply {{in all the}} <b>load</b> <b>centres</b> is a {{challenging}} task. Due {{to the increase in}} load and various emergency conditions the voltage level in <b>load</b> <b>centres</b> may vary beyond the acceptable level which leads to voltage collapse and increase the system losses. To maintain the voltage levels within the acceptable range in all <b>load</b> <b>centres</b> reactive power support is very essential. The control centres has to provide the optimal reactive power where ever necessary to prevent these critical situations. To provide the controllable amount of reactive power and voltage in the needy region efficient power flow analysis are required. Many traditional methods are available but it has limitations and converged in poor optimal solution. In this paper an effective hybrid Differential Evolution Algorithm assisted Genetic Algorithm approach with multi objective functions are considered. In this approach the best features of Differential Evolution Algorithm and Genetic Algorithm are combined together and developed.
