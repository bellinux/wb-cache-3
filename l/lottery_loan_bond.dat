This thesis {{examines}} what <b>lottery</b> <b>loans</b> are, {{why they were}} organized, and who invested in them. It will do so by studying the first <b>lottery</b> <b>loan</b> of Holland of 1711. The thesis {{will argue that the}} <b>lottery</b> <b>loans</b> were only issued in times of great financial distress. In 1711 wealthy investors demanded higher interest payments than the payments on the ordinary bonds of Holland. The province was forced to listen to the market, and issued a <b>lottery</b> <b>loan,</b> which was more profitable to the investors. We will see that most of the tickets were bought by wealthy investors, who were part of the regent class and had acces the capital market...|$|R
