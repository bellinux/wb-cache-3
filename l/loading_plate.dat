The forklift and load must be considered a unit with a continually varying center of gravity with every movement of the load. A forklift must never negotiate a turn at speed with a raised load, where centrifugal and gravitational forces may combine to cause a disastrous tip-over accident. The forklift is designed with a load limit for the forks which is decreased with fork elevation and undercutting of the load (i.e., when a load does not butt against the fork [...] "L").

50|$|Many analysts use {{simplified}} {{methods to}} calculate related parameters that are empirical in nature. The most common is maximum deflection under {{the centre of}} the load plate (D0) which is related to empirical measures such as the Benkelman Beam deflection (after minor adjustment for differences in the two devices). Historically some used the radius of curvature (D0-D200) but this is out of favour now because {{it is clear that the}} steel <b>loading</b> <b>plate</b> of 300mm diameter affects the shape of the deflection bowl between the centre (D0) and the D200 sensor at 200mm. However this means that a lot of useful information about the shape of the deflected bowl is wasted. Horak and Emery have published indices that use this information: BLI=D0-D300 and gives an indication of the basecourse performance, MLI = D300-D600 and gives an indication of the subbase performance, and LLI=D600-D900 and gives an indication of subgrade performance. These and other similar indices are known as shape factors. The FWD data can also be very useful in helping the engineer divide the length of the pavement into homogeneous sections.|$|E

It {{is important to note}} that although these parameters are not strains and stresses according to their classic tensoral definitions[23], they are used herein as simple scalar measures in a manner consistent with previous studies[5, 6]. Because the initial gap distance h 0 is the same as the non-bonded cutoff radius between the rigid plate atoms and the CG beads (Table  1), any displacement of the plate toward the particle results in an axial loading via the repulsive energy potential; thus, there is no loading slack in the system when ϵ[*]=[*] 0.

Patches of local disorders (weakness) in the <b>loading</b> <b>plate</b> can cause such a situation in the system. We find that in 2 d a finite crossover (between global and local load sharing behaviours) point comes up at a finite value of the disorder concentration (near p_c∼ 0. 53), which is slightly below the site percolation threshold. We numerically determine the phase diagrams (in 1 d and 2 d) and identify the critical behavior below p_c with the mean field behavior (completely global load sharing) for both dimensions. This crossover can occur due to geometrical percolation of disorders in the <b>loading</b> <b>plate.</b> We also show how the critical point depends on the loading history, which is identified as a special property of local load sharing.

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} the failure mechanism of beams composed of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) box {{with and without}} infill concrete, and subjected to four point bending and axial load. In an experimental study performed with twenty small scale beams from five types of CFRP laminates, the beams failed near a <b>loading</b> <b>plate.</b> This study employs finite element analysis to investigate the failure mechanism. Concrete is modeled as an isotropic material capable of cracking in tension and crushing in compression. CFRP is modeled as an orthotropic material with linear constitutive relation, and Tsai-Wu failure criterion is employed for CFRP. The analysis reproduces the observed beam failure. Local bending of top flange governs the failure of empty beams. CFRP failure near <b>loading</b> <b>plate</b> governs the failure of filled beams. Failure of CFRP occurs with more than 60 % contribution by longitudinal compressive stress and the rest by in-plane shear stress. The contribution of the longitudinal compression increases {{with an increase in}} axial load. Moreover, the beams with more fibers in the transverse direction fail by longitudinal compression.

The internal surface of the panel is cooled by high pressure helium as that is cooled to - 423 F by liquid helium heat exchangers.

40|$|Comprehensive {{results from}} cyclic plate loading at a {{diameter}} of 300 mm supported by layers of geocell are presented. The plate load tests were performed in a test pit measuring in plane and 700 mm in depth. To simulate half and full traffic loadings, fifteen loading and unloading cycles were applied to the <b>loading</b> <b>plate</b> with amplitudes of 400 and 800 kPa. The optimum embedded depth of the first layer of geocell beneath the <b>loading</b> <b>plate</b> and the optimum vertical spacing of geocell layers, based on plate settlement, are both approximately 0. 2 times <b>loading</b> <b>plate</b> diameter. The results show that installation of the geocell layers in the foundation bed, increase the resilient behavior in addition to reduction of accumulated plastic and total settlement of pavement system. Efficiency of geocell reinforcement was decreased by {{increasing the number of}} the geocell layers for all applied stress levels and number of cycles of applied loading. The results of the testing reveal the ability of the multiple layers of geocell reinforcement to 'shakedown' to a fully resilient behavior after a period of plastic settlement except when {{there is little or no}} reinforcement and the applied cyclic pressure are large. When shakedown response is observed, then both the accumulated plastic settlement prior to a steady-state response being obtained and the resilient settlements thereafter are reduced. The use of four layers of geocell respectively decreases the total and residual plastic settlements about 53 % and 63 % and increases the resilient settlement 145 % compared with the unreinforced case. The inclusion of the geocell layers also reduces the vertical stress transferred down through the pavement by distributing the load over a wider area. For example, at the end of the load cycle of the applied pressure of 800 kPa, the transferred pressure at the depth of 510 mm is reduced about 21. 4 %, 43. 9 %, 56. 1 % for the reinforced bases with one, two, and three layers of geocell, respectively, compared to the stress in the unreinforced bed...|$|E

40|$|Vertebral {{compression}} fracture is {{a common}} medical problem in osteoporotic individuals. The quantitative computed tomography (QCT) -based finite element (FE) method {{may be used to}} predict vertebral strength in vivo, but needs to be validated with experimental tests. The aim {{of this study was to}} validate a nonlinear anatomy specific QCT-based FE model by using a novel testing setup. Thirty-seven human thoracolumbar vertebral bone slices were prepared by removing cortical endplates and posterior elements. The slices were scanned with QCT and the volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) was computed with the standard clinical approach. A novel experimental setup was designed to induce a realistic failure in the vertebral slices in vitro. Rotation of the <b>loading</b> <b>plate</b> was allowed by means of a ball joint. To minimize device compliance, the specimen deformation was measured directly on the <b>loading</b> <b>plate</b> with three sensors. A nonlinear FE model was generated from the calibrated QCT images and computed vertebral stiffness and strength were compared to those measured during the experiments. In agreement with clinical observations, most of the vertebrae underwent an anterior wedge-shape fracture. As expected, the FE method predicted both stiffness and strength better than vBMD (R 2 improved from 0. 27 to 0. 49 and from 0. 34 to 0. 79, respectively). Despite the lack of fitting parameters, the linear regression of the FE prediction for strength was close to the 1 : 1 relation (slope and intercept close to one (0. 86 kN) and to zero (0. 72 kN), respectively). In conclusion, a nonlinear FE model was successfully validated through a novel experimental technique for generating wedge-shape fractures in human thoracolumbar vertebrae...|$|E
