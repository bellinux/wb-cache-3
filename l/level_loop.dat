There is no experimental evidence to date that confirms string theory's predictions of supersymmetry and Kaluza–Klein extra dimensions.

Proponents of string theory will often point to the fact that, among other things, it demonstrably reproduces the established theories of general relativity and quantum field theory in the appropriate limits, which Loop Quantum Gravity has struggled to do.

In this paper, we apply the same method to study the linear relations for <b>loop</b> <b>level</b> four point color-ordered gluon amplitudes in gauge theory with group and find that there are 1, 6, 10, 13, 16 constraint relations at L= 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 <b>loop</b> <b>level.</b> It is expected that there are more group-theoretic constraints for high <b>loop</b> <b>levels.</b> The constraint relations should be derived order by order in gauge theories.

For leptons at one <b>loop</b> <b>level</b> we find that the ratio of the charged lepton mass and the power of g 1 varies ≃ 4 × 10 − 5 in the whole energy range. At the two <b>loop</b> <b>level</b> we have found two relations between the quark masses and the gauge couplings that vary ≃ 4 % and ≃ 1 %, respectively. For leptons at the two <b>loop</b> <b>level</b> we have derived a relation between the charged lepton mass and the gauge couplings g 1 and g 2 that varies ≃ 0. 1 %.

40|$|We {{present a}} plan to add loop nest {{optimizations}} in GCC based on polyhedral representations of loop nests. We advocate a static analysis approach based on a hierarchy of interchangeable abstractions with solvers that range from the exact solvers such as OMEGA, to faster but less precise solvers based on more coarse abstractions. The intermediate representation GRAPHITE (GIMPLE Represented as Polyhedra with Interchangeable Envelopes), built on GIMPLE and the natural loops, hosts the high <b>level</b> <b>loop</b> transformations. We base this presentation on the WRaP-IT project developed in the Alchemy group at INRIA Futurs and Paris-Sud University, on the PIPS compiler developed at École des mines de Paris, and on a joint work with {{several members of the}} static analysis and polyhedral compilation community in France. The main goal of this project is to bring more high <b>level</b> <b>loop</b> optimizations to GCC: loop fusion, tiling, strip mining, etc. Thanks to the WRaP-IT experience, we know that the polyhedral analyzes and transformations are affordable in a production compiler. A second goal of this project is to experiment with compile time reduction versus attainable precision when replacing operations on polyhedra with faster operations on more abstract domains. However, the use of a too coarse representation for computing might also result in an over approximated solution that cannot be used in subsequent computations. There exists a trade off between speed of the computation and the attainable precision that has not yet been analyzed for real world programs. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} {{two-dimensional}} statistical physics models leads naturally {{to the analysis}} of various conformally invariant mathematical objects, such as the Gaussian free field, the Schramm-Loewner evolution, and the conformal loop ensemble. Just as Brownian motion is a scaling limit of discrete random walks, these objects serve as universal scaling limits of functions or paths associated with the underlying discrete models. We establish a new convergence result for percolation, a well-studied discrete model. We also study random sets of points surrounded by exceptional numbers of conformal loop ensemble loops and establish the existence of a random generalized function describing the nesting of the conformal loop ensemble. Using this framework, we study the relationship between Gaussian free field extrema and nesting extrema of the ensemble of Gaussian free field <b>level</b> <b>loops.</b> Finally, we describe a coupling between the set of all Gaussian free field <b>level</b> <b>loops</b> and a conformal loop ensemble growth process introduced by Werner and Wu. We prove that the dynamics are determined by the conformal loop ensemble in this coupling, and we use this result to construct a conformally invariant metric space. by Samuel Stewart Watson.
