5|$|The {{body was}} found inside a plastic garbage bag on the {{shoreline}} of Deer Island in Boston, Massachusetts. A woman walking her dog discovered Bond's remains {{on the afternoon of}} June 25, 2015, when the dog stopped at the plastic bag. After the {{body was found}}, the public placed flowers near the scene. She wore only a pair of white <b>leggings</b> designed with a black polka-dot pattern. A zebra-print blanket was also inside the bag. Initially, police were unsure if there would be additional bodies at the scene, so they attempted unsuccessfully to use cadaver dogs to locate any other possible remains.|$|E
25|$|The <b>leggings</b> {{were made}} from domesticated goat leather. A similar set of 6,500-year-old <b>leggings</b> {{discovered}} in Switzerland {{were made from}} goat leather which may indicate the goat leather was specifically chosen.|$|E
25|$|Hampshire Constabulary also list <b>leggings</b> as part an {{optional}} piece of uniform.|$|E

25|$|Ötzi's {{clothes were}} sophisticated. He wore a cloak made of woven grass and a coat, a belt, {{a pair of}} <b>leggings,</b> a loincloth and shoes, all made of leather of {{different}} skins. He also wore a bearskin cap with a leather chin strap. The shoes were waterproof and wide, seemingly designed for walking across the snow; they were constructed using bearskin for the soles, deer hide for the top panels, and a netting made of tree bark. Soft grass went around the foot and in the shoe and functioned like modern socks. The coat, belt, <b>leggings</b> and loincloth were constructed of vertical strips of leather sewn together with sinew. His belt had a pouch sewn to it that contained a cache of useful items: a scraper, drill, flint flake, bone awl and a dried fungus.|$|E
25|$|Clothing {{used was}} {{similar to that of the}} samurai, but loose {{garments}} (such as <b>leggings)</b> were tucked into trousers or secured with belts.

25|$|Modern craftswomen weave and {{embroider}} traditional garments that command {{very high}} prices. In winter the skins of animals were worn, with <b>leggings</b> of deerskin and in Sakhalin, boots {{were made from}} the skin of dogs or salmon. Ainu culture considers earrings, traditionally made from grapevines, to be gender neutral. Women also wear a beaded necklace called a tamasay.|$|E
25|$|Ankle weights, {{which are}} {{typically}} about 1lb./0.5kg of shot, {{are used to}} counteract the positive buoyancy of diving suit <b>leggings,</b> made worse in drysuits by the migration of the internal bubble of air to the feet, and positively buoyant fins. Some divers prefer negatively buoyant fins. The additional effort needed when finning with ankle weights or heavy fins increases the diver's gas consumption.|$|E
25|$|The Crow wore {{clothing}} {{distinguished by}} gender. Women wore dresses made of deer and buffalo hide, decorated with elk teeth or shells. They covered their legs with <b>leggings</b> during winter and their feet with moccasins. Crow women wore their hair in two braids. Male clothing usually {{consisted of a}} shirt, trimmed <b>leggings</b> with a belt, a long breechcloth, and moccasins. Robes made from the furred hide of a bison were often worn in winter. <b>Leggings</b> were either made of animal hide which the Crow made for themselves or made of wool which were highly valued trade items made specifically for Indians in Europe. Their hair was worn long, in some cases reaching the ground. The Crow are famous for often wearing their hair in a pompadour which was often coloured white with paint. Crow men were notable for wearing two hair pipes made from beads {{on both sides of}} their hair. Men often wore their hair in two braids wrapped in the fur of beavers or otters. Bear grease was used to give shine to hair. Stuffed birds were often worn in the hair of warriors and medicine men. Like other plains Indians the Crow wore feathers from eagles, crows, owls, and other birds in their hair for symbolic reasons. The Crow wore a variety of headdresses including the famous eagle feather headdress, bison scalp headdress with horns and beaded rim, and split horn headdress. The split horn headdress is made from a single bison horn split in half and polished into two nearly identical horns which were attached to a leather cap and decorated with feathers and beadwork. Traditional clothing worn by the Crow is still worn today with varying degrees of regularity.|$|E
25|$|The {{city was}} {{surrounded}} by ramparts from the early Roman Empire. This house would put in place between 15 BC and 15 AD. In 1869, excavations {{to the south of}} the old town revealed the existence of a monumental gate defended by two protruding towers. The façade, or at least the pillars which were observed during the excavation, was covered with a large piece of sandstone and adorned with a frieze of military trophies: Shields, <b>leggings</b> and reastplates.|$|E
25|$|The {{standing}} {{figure is}} in typical pilgrim or travelling priest garb: waraji, a grey robe, and light-coloured <b>leggings</b> and arm covers. In addition, {{he wears a}} gong around his waist and carries a shakujō (錫杖) pilgrim's staff. Behind him, the body and straps of a portable shrine are just visible. Heroes and their foes disguising themselves as pilgrims is a popular kabuki motif. The character's aggressive pose—right arm removed from his robe, menacing facial expression—indicates that he is likely not a benign pilgrim.|$|E
25|$|In 1859, {{new dress}} uniform {{regulations}} were issued; the new uniform had a French-style shako with an unpopular pom-pon. There {{was also the}} option of a fatigue cap, fashioned after the French képi. In the expeditionary period post Civil War, Marines began wearing a khaki field uniform, better suited to tropical and arid environments. In the 1890s, the Marines adopted some practical changes to the field uniform, adding a campaign cover, with a large Marine emblem on the side, and canvas <b>leggings.</b>|$|E
25|$|Yellow Robe {{dressed in}} a 19th-century Lakota Indian costume: a deerskin dress, <b>leggings,</b> and moccasins, with a {{feathered}} warbonnet, not customarily worn by women. Rosebud taught children about Native American culture through stories and legends Rosebud and her sisters heard from her father, handicraft, games, and songs. Each year ended with the Annual American Indian Art Exhibit, where the projects the children {{had been working on}} were showcased and judged. Winners were awarded with authentic Native American artifacts which were then displayed in participating local schools.|$|E
25|$|Skaters are {{generally}} free to select their own attire, {{with a few}} restrictions. In competition, females may wear a dress, typically with matching attached briefs, and since 2004, they may also choose trousers. They may wear opaque flesh-colored <b>leggings</b> or tights under dresses and skirts, which may extend to cover their skates. Men must wear trousers – {{they are not allowed}} to wear tights, although, officials do not always impose a deduction for violations. Matching costumes are not required in pair skating and ice dancing.|$|E
25|$|In 1950, {{under the}} Director General Jose Mauricio Lopez Escobar, the uniform {{was changed to}} dark green and the helmet was changed from khaki cork to a dark green or black American M-1 steel helmet with a liner made of {{laminated}} fiber; the shoes and <b>leggings</b> worn with the trousers were also black. In 1961, the Czech Mauser {{was replaced by the}} M1 carbine, as it did not possess a modern weapon. The carbine was replaced eight years in January 1969 by the German 7.62mm G-3 rifle.|$|E

25|$|The Akha {{people are}} often noted for their very {{recognizable}} sartorial practices. Akha women spin cotton into thread with a hand spindle and weave it on a foot-treadle loom. The cloth is hand dyed with indigo. Women wear broad <b>leggings,</b> a short black skirt with a white beaded sporran, a loose fitting black jacket with heavily embroidered cuffs and lapels. Akha women {{are known for their}} embroidery skills. While traditional clothes are typically worn for special ceremonies, one is more likely to see Akha villagers in full traditional garb in areas that have heavy volumes of tourists, particularly in Thailand.|$|E
25|$|Western riders wear a long-sleeved shirt, denim jeans, boots, and a wide-brimmed cowboy hat. Cowboy boots, {{which have}} pointed toes and higher heels than a {{traditional}} riding boot, {{are designed to}} prevent the rider's foot from slipping through the stirrup during a fall, preventing the rider from being dragged—most western saddles have no safety bars for the leathers or automatic stirrup release mechanism. A rider may wear protective leather <b>leggings</b> called chaps. Clean, well-fitting work clothing is the usual outfit seen in rodeo, cutting and reining competitions, especially for men, though sometimes {{both men and women}} wear brighter colors or finer fabrics for competition than for work.|$|E
25|$|The first {{standard}} uniforms {{used by the}} National Guard was khaki colored, worn with long pants, with metal buttons running down the front and emblems of the neck.

These hats were worn with the left wing brim bent upward which carryed a fabric Cockade in {{the colors of the}} Flag of El Salvador, the Cockade was changed to metal. The issued weapon was the 7mm Spanish Mauser rifle which was used until 1924. This dress was an early idea of Colonel Garrido.|$|E
25|$|Kurtas {{are often}} worn with jeans. Women {{sometimes}} wear kurtas as blouses, usually over jeans pants. Jeans are sometimes preferred over pajamas or <b>leggings</b> {{as they are}} more durable for rough use. Most colours of kurtas match with blue jeans. In 2014, an Indian family court in Mumbai ruled that a husband objecting to his wife wearing a kurta and jeans and forcing her to wear a sari amounts to cruelty inflicted by the husband and can be a ground to seek divorce. The wife was thus granted a divorce on the ground of cruelty as defined under section 27(1)(d) of Special Marriage Act, 1954.|$|E
25|$|The sisters {{descended from}} Martin Van Buren, the eighth President of the United States. In 1916, 24-year-old Augusta and 22-year-old Adeline Van Buren, or Gussie and Addie {{as they were}} known, were in their 20s and active in the {{national}} Preparedness Movement. America was about to enter World War I, and the sisters wanted to prove that women could ride {{as well as men}} and would be able to serve as military dispatch riders, freeing up men for other tasks. They also hoped to remove one of the primary arguments for denying women the right to vote. For their ride, they dressed in military-style <b>leggings</b> and leather riding breeches, a taboo at that time.|$|E
25|$|When a man {{proposed}} to a woman, he visited her house, ate half a full bowl of rice handed {{to him by}} her, and returned the rest to her.

When a man became engaged to a woman or they learned that their engagement had been arranged, they exchanged gifts. He sent her a small engraved knife, a workbox, a spool, and other gifts. She sent him embroidered clothes, coverings for {{the back of the}} hand, <b>leggings</b> and other handmade clothes. According to some books, many yomeiri marriages, in which a bride went to the house of a bridegroom with her belongings to become a member of his family, were conducted in the old days.|$|E
25|$|In the Livre d'Artus, Merlin enters Rome in {{the form}} of a huge stag with a white fore-foot. He bursts into the {{presence}} of Julius Caesar and tells the emperor that only the wild man of the woods can interpret the dream that has been troubling him. Later, he returns {{in the form}} of a black, shaggy man, barefoot, with a torn coat. In another episode, he decides to do something that will be spoken of forever. Going into the forest of Brocéliande, he transforms himself into a herdsman carrying a club and wearing a wolf-skin and <b>leggings.</b> He is large, bent, black, lean, hairy and old, and his ears hang down to his waist. His head is as big as a buffalo's, his hair is down to his waist, he has a hump on his back, his feet and hands are backwards, he is hideous, and is over 18 feet tall. By his arts, he calls a herd of deer to come and graze around him.|$|E
25|$|On April 9, 2015, Spears and Azalea {{were spotted}} {{shooting}} scenes {{for the music}} video around the streets of Studio City, Los Angeles, after Spears shared lyrics of the track and a behind-the-scenes snapshot on her Twitter account. Spears shared a picture from the video shoot captioning it with lyrics of the song on her social media accounts. In the '80s-inspired visuals seen on the candid images, Spears wore a leopard print crop top, ripped jeans, and pumps with matching sunglasses, triangle-shaped earrings, and pink lipstick, while Azalea was wearing matching jean jacket and shorts with a crimped hairstyle, while posing together in a bright red convertible Fox-Body Mustang and with Spears also driving around in a yellow Jeep CJ. Azalea then shared a selfie from the set on her Instagram account along with a hashtag of the song title. Later that day, Azalea was also seen swapping into a second outfit, a green top, jet black studded <b>leggings</b> and electric blue heels. They were pictured again {{on the second day}} of production of the video shoot on April 10, 2015, with Spears wearing a repeat outfit from the day before but with a shorter hairdo sporting a voluminous curly bob, and Azalea changing into a sleeveless tie-dye number. Spears filmed a car wash scene with male backup dancers completing a dance routine. That same day, a snippet of the unreleased track went viral on Twitter after a fan, who was near the set, recorded and uploaded a clip online.|$|E
500|$|When {{designing}} Sakura, Kishimoto {{focused on}} her silhouette and created a costume as simple as possible. This is a divergence from the other main characters of the series, whose costumes are very detailed. The <b>leggings</b> are the most notable aspect of her design, as they are meant to show that she is very active. At {{the start of the}} series her <b>leggings</b> extended below her knees and closely resembled trousers. As Part I progressed, the <b>leggings</b> became increasingly shorter and tighter. Similar to his inexperience with drawing heroines, Kishimoto lacked the experience needed to make Sakura [...] "cute" [...] when he first began drawing her. Although he implies that her appearance has become cuter since then, Kishimoto and much of the Naruto manga staff agree that Sakura was [...] "far from cute" [...] {{at the start of the}} series. In retrospective, he found Sakura one of the hardest character to draw alongside Sasuke. Kishimoto first planned Sasuke and Sakura's romance in early production of Naruto. In regards to Sakura's feelings to Sasuke, Kishimoto tried to write them as realistic as possible but ended getting complaints from young girls about her.|$|E

Her choreography for the final was arranged by Mia Michaels. Although considered a favorite, she finished in an honorable 9th position, making Greece only one of two countries that were automatically in the final that managed a top 10 position. She received 128 points, including the coveted [...] "douze points" [...] from Bulgaria and Cyprus.|$|E
500|$|In The Virgin Tour, [...] "Into the Groove" [...] was {{the third}} song of the setlist. Madonna wore a blue see-through crop-top, {{revealing}} her characteristic black bra. She had lacy <b>leggings</b> and crucifixes around her ear and her neck. Her hair was tied {{at the top and}} fell in unkempt manner around her ears. She had a tambourine in her hand like her two male dancers, and together they sang the song while {{standing in front of a}} microphone, in tandem. The performance was included on the video release titled , shot in Detroit. She also performed it on her Live Aid concert on July 13, 1985.|$|E
500|$|... {{used for}} making anchor ropes and ﬁshing lines, cooking mats, baskets, sandals and <b>leggings</b> for {{protection}} when travelling in the South Island high country, {{home of the}} prickly speargrasses (Aciphylla) and tūmatakuru or matagouri (Discaria toumatou). Morere swings provided a source of amusement for Māori children. The ropes had to be strong, so they were often made from the leaves or fibre of C.australis, which were much tougher than the fibres of New Zealand flax. The leaves were also used for rain capes, although the mountain cabbage tree C.indivisa, was preferred. The ﬁbre made from cabbage tree leaves is stronger than that made from New Zealand ﬂax.|$|E
