5|$|The first updated Mk. V sets {{arrived in}} April 1942 and were fitted to the de Havilland Mosquito as they became available. A Mk. V {{equipped}} Mosquito claimed its first kill on 24/25 June, when a Mosquito NF.II from No. 151 Squadron shot down a Dornier Do 217E-4 over the North Sea. In practice {{it was found}} that pilots had considerable difficulty <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> display at the last minute, and the system was used only experimentally. By this time the microwave units had started to arrive in small numbers, so Mk. V production was repeatedly delayed pending their arrival, and eventually cancelled.|$|E
