While lobbyists may spend freely on advocacy, they are limited in gifts to legislators and in their ability to contribute to campaigns. Ethics issues related to <b>lobbyists</b> <b>and</b> other matters are handled by the Joint Committee on Legislative Ethics, a twelve-member committee that includes six Senators. Members of the Senate may turn to either this committee or an ethics counsel to help them resolve questions of potential ethical conflict. Members are encouraged to avoid conflicts of interest, and are required to submit public financial disclosures to the state. In addition to employment prohibitions laid out in the state constitution, members are barred from advocating for any paying client before any part of the state government.|$|E

25|$|In the west, the Black Seminoles {{were still}} {{threatened}} by slave raiders. These included pro-slavery {{members of the}} Creek tribe and some Seminole, whose allegiance to the blacks diminished after defeat by the US in the war. Officers of the federal army may have tried to protect the Black Seminoles, but in 1848 the U.S. Attorney General bowed to pro-slavery <b>lobbyists</b> <b>and</b> ordered the army to disarm the community.

25|$|However, it {{has been}} shown that in river policy, the {{strength}} of opposing interest groups also mattered. The TVA bill was passed in 1933 because reformers like Norris skillfully coordinated action at potential choke points and weakened the already disorganized opponents among the electric power industry lobbyists. In 1936, however, after regrouping, opposing river <b>lobbyists</b> <b>and</b> conservative coalition congressmen took advantage of the New Dealers' spending mood by expanding the Army Corps' flood control program. They also helped defeat further valley authorities, the most promising of the New Deal water policy reforms.|$|E
25|$|The Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 was {{supported}} by a broad base of activists, <b>lobbyists,</b> <b>and</b> organizations, particularly Just Detention International.

The report {{concluded that there was}} an appearance of favoritism and conflicts of interest in the awarding of city contracts and development deals, a perception that large contracts had an undue influence on city hall, and patronage with the hiring of campaign workers, contributors, legislative colleagues, and friends to government positions.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to the entry on September 15 of Harvard Law Professor Elizabeth Warren into the Senate campaign, Khazei issued a direct challenge to the other Democratic candidates — and specifically to Warren — to forego campaign funds from corporate <b>lobbyists</b> <b>and</b> all Political Action Committees.

The Boston Globe's Noah Bierman reported that Khazei was leading the field of Democratic candidates in campaign funds as of the previous reporting period (June 30, 2011) with a reported total of $920,000, but that Senator Brown had a dramatic lead over all of the Democrats, having amassed about $9.6 million in campaign funds as of June.|$|E
25|$|House rules forbid {{members to}} accept travel {{expenses}} from <b>lobbyists,</b> <b>and</b> require that members inquire into {{the sources of}} funds that nonprofits use to pay for trips. DeLay denied knowing that lobbyists had paid for travel expenses. In July 2000, DeLay voted against {{a bill that would}} have restricted Internet gambling. Both eLottery and the Choctaws opposed the bill. Rudy, who was then DeLay's deputy chief of staff, doomed the bill by engineering a parliamentary maneuver that required a two-thirds majority vote, rather than a simple majority, for the bill to pass. Rudy's actions on behalf of Abramoff's clients during this time were mentioned in Abramoff's guilty plea in January 2006.|$|E
25|$|Some of Wasserman Schultz's {{actions that}} the news covered during the {{primaries}} were: having reduced the debate schedule, disinvited former DNC Vice Chair Tulsi Gabbard to the first primary Democratic debate, in an altercation shut down Sanders' campaign's access to the DNC server and thus halting their campaign until immense backslash led to her to rescind it, defended the system of superdelegates {{that were used to}} signal to the support base that Clinton would be nominee, quietly rescinded Obama's 2008 ban on donations to the DNC from corporate <b>lobbyists</b> <b>and</b> PACs and thus paving way for the Hillary Victory Fund that was later reported by Politico to have laundered money to their campaign and DNC having hid the details of its agreement with the Clinton campaign and falsely accused Sanders supporters of violence at the Nevada Convention..|$|E
