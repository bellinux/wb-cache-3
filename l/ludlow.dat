5|$|In the 21st century, <b>Ludlow</b> Castle {{is owned}} by John Herbert, the current Earl of Powis, but is held and managed by the Trustees of the Powis Castle Estate as a tourist attraction.

5|$|Hugh de Lacy died childless around 1115, and Henry I gave <b>Ludlow</b> Castle {{and most}} of the {{surrounding}} estates to Hugh's niece, Sybil, marrying her to Pain fitzJohn, one of his household staff. Pain used <b>Ludlow</b> as his caput, the main castle in his estates, using the surrounding estates and knight's fees to support the castle and its defences. Pain died in 1137 fighting the Welsh, triggering a struggle for the inheritance of the castle. Robert fitzMiles, who had been planning to marry Pain's daughter, laid claim to it, as did Gilbert de Lacy, Roger de Lacy's son. By now, King Stephen had seized the English throne, but his position was insecure and he therefore gave <b>Ludlow</b> to fitzMiles in 1137, in exchange for promises of future political support.|$|E

5|$|In 1501, Prince Arthur {{arrived in}} <b>Ludlow</b> for his honeymoon with his bride Catherine of Aragon, before dying the {{following}} year. The Council in the Marches of Wales continued to operate, however, {{under the guidance}} of its president, Bishop William Smyth. The council evolved into a combination of a governmental body and a court of law, settling a range of disputes across Wales and charged with maintaining general order, and <b>Ludlow</b> Castle became effectively the capital of Wales.|$|E
5|$|Josce {{was married}} to Sybil, the widow of Pain fitzJohn, who died in 1137. Sybil had held <b>Ludlow</b> Castle against Stephen in 1139, but {{surrendered}} after a siege. <b>Ludlow</b> was an important strategic stronghold {{for control of the}} Welsh Borders, and Stephen decided to marry Pain's widow to someone he felt was trustworthy. Upon his marriage Josce also acquired control of the castle, built in the late 11th century. Josce probably also received many of the de Lacy family's holdings in southern Shropshire, but he rebelled against Stephen and fortified <b>Ludlow</b> against the king. Josce's position was so strong that when Stephen granted much of the surrounding lands to Robert de Beaumont, Earl of Leicester, <b>Ludlow</b> was specifically exempted. Stephen told Robert that he would have a royal grant of the castle if he could secure Josce's submission as a vassal.|$|E
5|$|On 10 July 1137 Pain {{was killed}} by a javelin blow to the head during an ambush by the Welsh as he was leading a relief {{expedition}} to the garrison at Carmarthen. He was buried in Gloucester Abbey, following a funeral service conducted by Robert de Bethune. A number of barons from the Welsh Marches attended, including Miles of Gloucester. Pain's widow continued to hold <b>Ludlow</b> Castle until the middle of 1139, when she was forced to surrender it to King Stephen. Stephen then gave Sybil in marriage to Jocelin de Dinan, who consequently acquired <b>Ludlow</b> Castle through his new wife, setting up the background to Gilbert Lacy's attempts to seize <b>Ludlow</b> from Dinan on which the medieval Welsh romance work Fouke le Fitz Waryn is based.|$|E

5|$|A {{civil war}} between Stephen and the Empress Matilda soon broke out and Gilbert took his chance to rise up against Stephen, seizing <b>Ludlow</b> Castle. Stephen responded by taking an army into the Welsh Marches, where he {{attempted}} to garner local support by marrying one of his knights, Joce de Dinan, to Sybil and granting the future ownership of the castle to them. Stephen took the castle after several attempts in 1139, famously rescuing his ally Prince Henry of Scotland when the latter was caught on a hook thrown over the walls by the garrison. Gilbert still maintained {{that he was the}} rightful owner of <b>Ludlow,</b> however, and a private war ensued between Joce and himself. Gilbert was ultimately successful and retook the castle around a few years {{before the end of the}} civil war in 1153. He ultimately left for the Levant, leaving <b>Ludlow</b> in the hands of firstly, his eldest son, Robert, and then, after Robert's death, his younger son, Hugh de Lacy.|$|E

5|$|Henry {{placed the}} young heir to <b>Ludlow,</b> another Edmund Mortimer, {{under house arrest}} {{in the south of}} England, and kept a firm grip on <b>Ludlow</b> Castle himself. This persisted until Henry V finally granted Edmund his estates in 1413, with Edmund going on to serve the Crown overseas. As a result, the Mortimers rarely visited the castle during {{the first part of the}} century, despite the {{surrounding}} town having become prosperous in the wool and cloth trades. Edmund fell heavily into debt and having sold his rights to his Welsh estates to a consortium of nobles, before dying childless in 1425.|$|E

5|$|In 1223, King HenryIII {{met with}} the Welsh prince Llywelyn ab Iorwerth at <b>Ludlow</b> Castle for peace talks, but the {{negotiations}} were unsuccessful. The same year Henry became suspicious of Walter's activities in Ireland and, among other measures to secure his loyalty, <b>Ludlow</b> Castle {{was taken over by}} the Crown for a period of two years. This was cut short in May 1225 when Walter carried out a campaign against Henry's enemies in Ireland and paid the King 3,000marks for the return of his castles and lands. During the 1230s, however, Walter had accumulated a thousand pounds of debt to Henry and private moneylenders which he was unable to repay. As a result, in 1238 he gave <b>Ludlow</b> Castle as collateral to the King, although the fortification was returned to him sometime before his death in 1241.|$|E

5|$|<b>Ludlow</b> Castle is {{a ruined}} medieval {{fortification}} {{in the town}} of the same name in the English county of Shropshire, standing on a promontory overlooking the River Teme. The castle was probably founded by Walter de Lacy after the Norman conquest {{and was one of the}} first stone castles to be built in England. During the civil war of the 12th century the castle changed hands several times between the de Lacy's and rival claimants, and was further fortified with a Great Tower and a large outer bailey. In the mid-13th century, <b>Ludlow</b> was passed on to Geoffrey de Geneville who rebuilt part of the inner bailey, and the castle played a part in the Second Barons' War. Roger Mortimer acquired the castle in 1301, further extending the internal complex of buildings, and the Mortimer family went on to hold <b>Ludlow</b> for over a century.|$|E
5|$|The Wars of the Roses {{broke out}} between the Lancastrians and Richard's Yorkist faction in the 1450s. <b>Ludlow</b> Castle did not find itself in the front-line {{of most of the}} conflict, instead acting as a safe retreat away from the main fighting. An {{exception}} to this was the Battle of Ludford Bridge which took place just outside the town of <b>Ludlow</b> in 1459, resulting in a largely bloodless victory for the Lancastrian Henry VI. After the battle, in a bid to break Richard's power over the region, Edmund de la Mare was placed in charge of the castle as constable, with John Talbot, the Earl of Shrewsbury, being given the wider lordship. Richard was killed in battle in 1460, and his son Edward seized the throne the following year, retaking control of <b>Ludlow</b> Castle and merging it with the property of the Crown.|$|E
5|$|The new Edward IV {{visited the}} castle {{regularly}} {{and established a}} council there to govern his estates in Wales. He probably conducted only modest work on the property, although he may could {{have been responsible for}} the remodelling of the Great Tower. In 1473, possibly influenced by his own childhood experiences at <b>Ludlow,</b> Edward sent his eldest son, the future Edward V, and his brother Prince Richard to live at the castle, which was also made the seat of the newly created Council in the Marches of Wales. By now <b>Ludlow</b> had become primarily residential, rather than military, but was still rich in chivalric connotations and a valuable symbol of the Yorkist authority and their claim to the throne. Edward died in 1483, but after Henry VII took the throne in 1485 he continued to use <b>Ludlow</b> Castle as a regional base, granting it to his son, Prince Arthur, in 1493, and reestablishing the dormant Council in the Marches at the property.|$|E

5|$|The town of <b>Ludlow</b> was {{increasingly}} fashionable and frequented by tourists, with the castle forming a particularly popular attraction. Thomas Warton published an edition of Milton's poems in 1785, describing <b>Ludlow</b> Castle and popularising the links to Comus, reinforcing the castle's {{reputation as a}} picturesque and sublime location. The castle became a topic for painters interested in these themes: J. M. W. Turner, Francis Towne, Thomas Hearne, Julius Ibbetson, Peter de Wint and William Marlowe all produced depictions of the castle during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, usually taking some artistic licence with the details {{in order to produce}} atmospheric works.|$|E
5|$|Walter began {{building}} a castle within the manor of Stanton Lacy; the fortification was originally called Dinham Castle, before it acquired its later name of <b>Ludlow.</b> <b>Ludlow</b> {{was the most}} important of Walter's castles: as well as being at the heart of his new estates, the site also lay at a strategic crossroads over the Teme River, on a strong defensive promontory. Walter died in a construction accident at Hereford in 1085 and was succeeded by his son, Roger de Lacy.|$|E
5|$|Walter de Lacy {{travelled}} to Ireland in 1201 and {{the following}} year his properties, including <b>Ludlow</b> Castle, were once again confiscated to ensure his loyalty and placed {{under the control of}} William de Braose, his father-in-law. Walter's lands were returned to him, subject to the payment of a fine of 400marks, but in 1207 his disagreements with royal officials in Ireland led to King John seizing the castle and putting it under the control of William again. Walter reconciled himself with John the following year, but meanwhile William himself had fallen out with the King; violence broke out and both Walter and William took refuge in Ireland, with John taking control of <b>Ludlow</b> yet again. It was not until 1215 that their relationship recovered and John agreed to give <b>Ludlow</b> back to Walter. At some point during the early 13th century, the innermost bailey was constructed in the castle, creating an additional private space within the inner bailey.|$|E
