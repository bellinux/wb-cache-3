Until now, the refusal of the UK government of {{the time to make}} changes in line with a European Union (EU) directive of 1989 which declared common recognition for all social work courses of minimally three years study in higher education at degree level leading to entry to a regulatory profession, meant that British social work awards were not recognised in other EU countries. Ironically, faced with a recruitment crisis at home, social work employers have been recruiting internationally qualified social workers from overseas and, since 1990, nearly 10, 000 such social workers have applied to have <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>verification</b> to allow them to practise in the UK...|$|E

40|$|Computer-aided <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> {{embedded}} systems {{hinges on the}} availability <b>of</b> good <b>verification</b> models <b>of</b> the systems at hand. Such models must be much simpler than full design models or specifications to be of practical value, because of the unavoidable combinatorial complexities in the <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> any non-trivial system. Good verification models, therefore, are "lean and mean", and cannot be obtained easily or generated automatically. Current research, however, seems to take the construction <b>of</b> <b>verification</b> models more or less for granted, although their development typically requires a coordinated integration of the experience, intuition and creativity <b>of</b> <b>verification</b> and domain experts.
