25|$|WMUR {{has always}} {{promoted}} {{the fact that}} it is the only local television news source in the state; the station's slogan since 2002 (No One Covers New Hampshire <b>Like</b> <b>We</b> <b>Do)</b> reflects this. However, WBIN-TV began offering daily newscasts covering New Hampshire in 2014. The newscasts were known as NH1 News and were based in Concord. NH1 News was an affiliate of CNN, while WBIN-TV was an independent station, and was not affiliated with a major network. Since WBIN went off the air as part of the FCC's spectrum auction in early 2017, WMUR is once again the only television news source in New Hampshire.|$|E
500|$|Vig {{recalled}} that the title [...] "Not Your Kind of People" [...] {{came to him}} when he was stuck in a traffic jam in Los Angeles; he texted Manson the idea for a title and she loved it. Manson wrote all the lyrics that night, and the next day the four of them gathered with acoustic guitars and wrote the music to the song in about half an hour. Manson explained that the album title Not Your Kind of People was [...] "a call to arms in a way to anyone who feels <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> about the world", saying that [...] "it can be great to be outsider." [...] She felt that this applied to them as the band [...] "never fit into a music scene" [...] and that [...] "in my life I've never been an insider." [...] Manson also described the title as [...] "a two-fingered salute to people who reject or criticize us", stating the band was [...] "only really interested in people who share our outlook" [...] as she considered that their fans were [...] "the people who connect with what you're saying and how you say it." ...|$|E

500|$|Perry is a LGBT rights activist. She {{supported}} Stonewall {{during their}} [...] "It gets better..... today" [...] campaign to prevent homophobic bullying, and dedicated the music video to her song [...] "Firework" [...] to the It Gets Better Project. Perry told Do Something in November 2008 {{she was proud}} to be a gay activist, saying [...] "I've always been a very open-minded person, but I definitely believe in equality." [...] She confirmed that she voted against Proposition 8, an amendment (ultimately ruled unconstitutional) that legally defined marriage as a union solely {{between a man and a}} woman in California. In June 2012, Perry expressed her hopes for LGBT equality, commenting [...] "hopefully, we will look back at this moment and think <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> now concerning [...] civil rights issues. We'll just shake our heads in disbelief, saying, 'Thank God we've evolved.' That would be my prayer for the future." [...] In December 2012, Perry was awarded the Trevor Hero Award by The Trevor Project for her work and activism on behalf of LGBT youth. On March 18, 2017, she received a Nation Equality Award from Human Rights Campaign for [...] "using her powerful voice and international platform to speak out for LGBTQ equality", with the organization further stating that [...] "Katy's message of inclusion and equality continues to inspire us and the world".|$|E
2500|$|Dave Brock {{explained}} their {{method of}} working as [...] "we recorded bass, guitar, drums and vocals together, so it's as live {{as it can}} be, and then we put on the other things afterwards... We just let the tapes run and play <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> when we're playing live; do a three-hour track and then cut it up into pieces, use one piece as a complete section, and join it up to another piece with a synthesiser link or something... It's improvised, but it's together in the first place." ...|$|E

Already the cries of motherhood, apple pie, and Jim Buckley reverberate through the halls of the Student Center. Everyone watch out, the 1950s bobby-sox generation is about to take over." ...|$|E

2500|$|In July 2017, it was {{reported}} that Apple had begun to remove listings in China for apps that circumvent government Internet censorship policies and new laws restricting virtual private network (VPN) services. Apple told The New York Times that the app removals were a result of developers not complying with new laws in China requiring a government license for businesses offering VPNs, and that [...] "These apps remain available in all other markets where they do business". In an earnings call the following month, Cook elaborated on the recent news, explainining that [...] "We would obviously rather not remove the apps, but <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> in other countries, we follow the law wherever we do business".|$|E
2500|$|Sex blogger Violet Blue {{has been}} mentioned, interviewed and once contributed at Boing Boing. On 23 June 2008, Blue posted on her blog, Tiny Nibbles, that all posts {{related to her}} had been deleted from Boing Boing, without explanation. The Los Angeles Times {{featured}} an interview that cast the silence {{on the part of}} Boing Boing on the matter as [...] "inexplicable", causing a controversy as Boing Boing [...] "has often presented itself as a stalwart of cultural openness". A heated debate ensued after a brief statement on the Boing Boing site regarding this action stated: [...] "Violet behaved {{in a way that made}} us reconsider whether we wanted to lend her any credibility or associate with her. It's our blog and so we made an editorial decision, <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> every single day". In commentary attached to that blog entry, [...] "many commenters surmised that they had something to do with Blue's suing to stop a porn star from also using the name Violet Blue," [...] and many commenters found the removal troubling, but Xeni Jardin said that she hoped she would not have to make the reasons public.|$|E
2500|$|With Monroe and Lester Flatt, Scruggs {{performed}} on the Grand Ole Opry and in September 1946 recorded the classic hit [...] "Blue Moon of Kentucky"; a song that was designated by the Library of Congress {{to be added to}} the National Recording Registry, and later added to the Grammy Hall of Fame. The work schedule was heavy in Monroe's band. They were playing a lot of jobs in movie theaters all over the south, riding in a 1941 Chevrolet from town to town, doing up to six shows a day and not finishing up until about eleven at night. Lester Flatt said, [...] "It wasn't anything to ride two or three days in a car. We didn't have buses <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> now, and we never had our shoes off". The self-imposed rule was to always get back in time to play the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville each Saturday night. Scruggs said of Monroe that [...] "Bill would never let the music go down no matter how tired we were. If a man would slack off, he would move over and get that mandolin up close on him and get him back up there". Despite the group's success, Scruggs decided the demands were too great. He was single at the time, and the brief few hours on Saturdays that he made it home, it was just to pack his suitcase at the Tulane Hotel where he lived alone, then repeat the cycle—he had done this for two years. He turned in his resignation, planning to go take care of his mother in North Carolina. [...] Flatt had also made up his mind to leave but he had not told anyone. He later gave his two-week notice but, before the notice was up, the bass player Howard Watts announced that he was leaving too. [...] Despite Monroe's pleading, they left the band. Monroe thought Flatt and Scruggs had a secret understanding, but both men denied it. Monroe did not speak to either one for 20 years thereafter, a feud well known in country music circles.|$|E

But we also wanted to add something new, like true Gregorian choirs and acoustic parts, and also tried to structure the songs in a different way from how <b>we</b> normally <b>do,</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> with “Colonies”..." ...|$|R

6000|$|Will {{there ever}} be the same romance about the {{warships}} of the present day,--what those of the future will be <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not care to speculate,--and the old [...] "wooden walls" [...] whose prowess on the high seas founded England's maritime glory? Will a Dibdin ever arise to sing a Devastation or a Glatton? Can a Devastation or a Glatton ever inspire poetic thoughts and images? One would say that the singer must be endowed in no ordinary degree with the sacred fire whom such a theme as a modern ironclad turret-ship should move to lyric utterance. It has been said that all the romance of the road died out with the old coaching days; and certainly a locomotive engine, with its long black train of practical-looking cars, makes hardly so picturesque a feature in the landscape as one of the old stage-coaches with its red-coated driver, horn-blowing guard, and team of mettled greys; but a railway train is an embodiment of poetry compared with a turret-ship. But if it be true that poetry and romance must more and more cease to be associated with our navy, we must just accept the fact, for nothing is more certain than that, whatever the warships of the future may be, we can never again return to the days of the old wooden ships.|$|E
