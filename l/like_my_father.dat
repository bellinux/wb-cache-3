In 1983, {{she wrote a}} book about her mother Legacy: Pura Villanueva Kalaw, Her Times, Life, and Works, 1886-1954.

500|$|In May 1993, Laura {{traveled}} to Attu and {{spoke at a}} 50th anniversary commemorative event of the Battle of Attu. [...] In her speech at the event, Laura stated [...] "How ironic {{that my father was}} killed in combat against his beloved America while in loyal service to his Japanese homeland... <b>Like</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> I too have a great love for Japan and America." ...|$|E
500|$|Chamberlain {{had long}} enjoyed {{excellent}} health, except for occasional attacks of gout, but by July 1940, {{he was in}} almost constant pain. He sought treatment, and later that month entered hospital for surgery. Surgeons discovered that {{he was suffering from}} terminal bowel cancer, but they concealed it from him, instead telling him that he would not require further surgery. Chamberlain resumed work in mid-August. He returned to his office on 9 September. However, renewed pain, compounded by the night-time bombing of London which forced him to go to an air raid shelter and denied him rest, sapped his energy, and he left London for the last time on 19 September, returning to Highfield Park in Heckfield. He offered his resignation to Churchill on 22 September. The Prime Minister was initially reluctant to accept; but as both men realised that Chamberlain would never return to work, Churchill finally allowed him to resign. The Prime Minister asked if Chamberlain would accept the highest order of British chivalry, the Order of the Garter, of which his brother had been a member. Chamberlain refused. He said he would [...] "prefer to die plain 'Mr. Chamberlain' <b>like</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> before me, unadorned by any title".|$|E

[...] "He wanted {{to get a piece of}} property here very cheap, and <b>my</b> <b>father</b> found another customer for the place at five hundred dollars more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is, indeed, but too probable," [...] said Peveril; [...] "but the Court {{shall be}} no element of mine. I will live <b>like</b> <b>my</b> <b>fathers,</b> among <b>my</b> people, {{care for their}} comforts, decide their differences----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, {{that must}} thou. Betray me, and thou shalt have {{the curse of}} the head of thine house. Had thy voice not become so strangely <b>like</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's,</b> I had never made myself known to thee." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "I {{want to die}} peacefully in my sleep, <b>like</b> <b>my</b> <b>father.</b> Not {{screaming}} and terrified like his passengers." [...] (Said on the advert which was broadcast after he had died) ...|$|E
2500|$|Lloyd {{graduated}} from high school when he was 15 and began studies at New York University, but left {{at the end of his}} sophomore year. [...] "All around me I could see the way the Depression was affecting everyone; for my family, for people in business <b>like</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> it was a terrible time," [...] he wrote. [...] "I just wasn't going to stay in college, paying tuition to get a degree to be a lawyer, when I could see lawyers that had become taxi drivers." [...] Lloyd's father died in 1945, at age 55, [...] "broken by the world that he was living in." ...|$|E
2500|$|Crevedia {{saw himself}} as [...] "a man of the right, <b>like</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> before me". In his definition, this meant both [...] "ardent" [...] Romanian {{nationalism}} and calls for [...] "social justice", with particular emphasis on [...] "the peasant issue": [...] "The [...] is rotten with illness, still ignorant, morally ruined, and political parties have turned it into bedlam." [...] Drifting toward Crainic's neo-traditionalist and Romanian Orthodox far-right, he served as editor-in-chief for the dailies Calendarul and Porunca Vremii. He also published in Cuvântul reportage pieces which documented {{the effects of the}} Great Depression on the Bucharest proletariat. He followed up with humorous, satirical prose volumes: Bacalaureatul lui Puiu ("Puiu's Baccalaureate", 1933), Dragoste cu termen redus ("Short-term Love", 1934); together with Al. С. Calotescu-Neicu, he published Antologia epigramei românești ("An Anthology of Romanian Epigrams", 1933). He won the Romanian Writers' Society prize in 1934 and enjoyed commercial success, but was soon after accused of plagiarism by his Calendarul colleague Pan M. Vizirescu and by the epigrammatist Paul I. Papadopol.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{you take}} up the cudgel," [...] said Eystein, merrily; [...] "but I know how to answer. If I did sit at home, <b>like</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> daughter, you cannot deny that, like a sister, I {{furnished}} you forth." ...|$|R
60|$|To {{right and}} left of us, {{scattered}} along the train, rode a dozen or fifteen men and youths on horses. Across their pommels were long-barrelled rifles. Whenever any of them drew near to our wagon I could see that their faces, under the dust, were drawn and anxious <b>like</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's.</b> And <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> <b>like</b> them, had a long-barrelled rifle close to hand as he drove.|$|R
60|$|These merchants {{interested}} me greatly. Humorous, self-contained, remorseless in trade, {{they were most}} delightful companions when off duty. They <b>liked</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> in his private capacity, but as a factor of the Grange he was an enemy. Their kind was new to me and I loved to linger about and listen to their banter when {{there was nothing else}} to do.|$|R
2500|$|In June 1970, {{after one}} season at Miami, Bo Schembechler offered Burton an {{assistant}} coaching position at Michigan, and Burton accepted. [...] Despite his {{strong ties to}} Miami, Burton recalled {{that he could not}} pass on the opportunity to coach at Michigan: [...] "I left Miami to coach at Michigan because of the challenge and an upward move in the profession." [...] Burton remained an assistant coach at Michigan for 22 years from 1970 to 1991. He began in 1970 as the coach of the freshman football team, coached receivers from 1972 to 1980 and then took over as the running backs coach from 1980 to 1992. [...] Burton was the position coach for All-American receivers Jim Smith and Anthony Carter and to running back Jamie Morris. [...] In 1990, Burton said that Morris was favorite Michigan player. Morris gave credit to Burton for his development: [...] "Tirrel was everything to me. He was <b>like</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and mother. He always was in my corner. Bo would get on me, and he would take some of the blame for me. He handled each individual the way he needed to be handled." [...] Burton reported that coaching under Schembechler had been a huge honor: [...] "Bo Schembechler was a great coach. He was from the same mold as Ara ... Bo was demanding of his coaches and his players. I learned most of what I know about football from Bo." ...|$|E
60|$|He was a tall, spare man <b>like</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> a Scotchman, but {{his hair}} was in a cue.|$|E
6000|$|Ralph, however, gave no heed to this observation. [...] "You <b>like</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and {{you like}} Lord Warburton. I infer also that you like my mother." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, there are, Maitre Bertram," [...] Philip laughed. [...] "I {{have a big}} frame <b>like</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's,</b> I will admit; and to look at, it may be as you say; but I shall want many {{another year}} over my head, before my {{strength}} matches my size. I am but just eighteen, and men do not come to their full strength till they are five-and-twenty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Must I tell you, dear sister? When {{you left}} me alone at Kew I asked myself {{whether it would}} not be better to conceal what I had heard and marry you. I don't know what madness possessed me. The instant you spoke the words that Margaret Affleck was your mother's name, I was {{convinced}} that you were my half-sister--the mystery of something in you, which had always puzzled and baffled me, was made plain. Your voice at times was <b>like</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> voice, and perhaps <b>like</b> <b>my</b> own; and in your face and your expression you are <b>like</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> mother in a miniature of her taken when she was a girl, and which I often used to see. And yet"--he paused and turned his face from her,--"this very conviction that you were so closely related to me made my feeling only stronger. Every scornful word you uttered only made it stronger; {{it seemed to me that}} unless I possessed you my life would not be worth having.... Even <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> dying wishes were nothing to me.... And for three days and nights.... How can you forgive me, Fan, when I had it in my heart to do such a thing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ecod, you may {{say what}} you <b>like</b> of <b>MY</b> <b>father,</b> then, and so I give you leave,' said Jonas. 'I think it's liquid {{aggravation}} that circulates through his veins, and not regular blood. How old should you think <b>my</b> <b>father</b> was, cousin?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is just <b>like</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> but I do wish it had {{not been}} so. I might have been down with him for the last three months of his life." ...|$|E
6000|$|Berenice stamped her foot. [...] "Does {{your duty}} go so far, Pollio, that <b>like</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> you would place a guard {{at my door}} if I said aught {{that would seem to}} run counter to your duty?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Dor. No, indeed, she's <b>like</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> [...] With a great beard; 'twould fright {{you to look}} on her: [...] Therefore {{that man}} and she may go together, [...] They are fit for nobody but one another.|$|E
5000|$|The {{childhood}} and adolescence that Shearer once described as [...] "a pleasant dream" [...] ended in 1918, when her father's company collapsed and older sister, Athole, suffered her first serious mental breakdown. Forced {{to move into a}} small, dreary house in a [...] "modest" [...] Montreal suburb, the sudden plunge into poverty only strengthened Shearer's determined attitude: [...] "At an early age, I formed a philosophy about failure. Perhaps an endeavor, <b>like</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> business, could fail, but that didn't mean Father had failed." ...|$|R
5000|$|Douglas {{remained}} {{a close friend}} of Buddy Ebsen for 32 years. In a 2011 interview with The Lincoln Times-News, she described Ebsen as [...] "a wonderful man, very much <b>like</b> <b>my</b> own <b>father,</b> a quiet, reserved, and caring person".|$|R
2500|$|Kirby {{joined the}} Lincoln Newspaper Syndicate in 1936, working there on {{newspaper}} comic strips and on single-panel advice cartoons such as Your Health Comes First!!! (under the pseudonym Jack Curtiss). He remained until late 1939, {{when he began}} working for the movie animation company Fleischer Studios as an inbetweener (an artist who fills in the action between major-movement frames) on Popeye cartoons. [...] "I went from Lincoln to Fleischer," [...] he recalled. [...] "From Fleischer I {{had to get out}} in a hurry because I couldn't take that kind of thing," [...] describing it as [...] "a factory in a sense, <b>like</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> factory. They were manufacturing pictures." ...|$|R
6000|$|There {{was another}} pause, but hardly {{long enough to}} attract notice. [...] "Perhaps so," [...] she said;--"but not quite yet. He is so peculiar, so touchy. The Duke is not quite <b>like</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and he would think himself suspected." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If Geoffrey doesn't jump at what I {{am going}} to offer him," [...] was the son's reply, [...] "I shall agree with my father that the case is hopeless; and I shall end, <b>like</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> in giving Geoffrey up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, indeed, Mrs. Fairfax!" [...] exclaimed I, nettled; [...] "he {{is nothing}} <b>like</b> <b>my</b> <b>father!</b> No one, who saw us together, would suppose {{it for an}} instant. Mr. Rochester looks as young, and is as young, as some men at five-and- twenty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll {{get out of}} {{the reeds}} first," [...] said young Pedgift. He gave his orders to the boatmen, dived briskly into the little cabin, and reappeared with a {{concertina}} in his hand. [...] "Neat, Miss Milroy, isn't it?" [...] he observed, pointing to his initials, inlaid on the instrument in mother-of-pearl. [...] "My name's Augustus, <b>like</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's.</b> Some of <b>my</b> friends knock off the 'A,' and call me 'Gustus Junior.' A small joke goes a long way among friends, doesn't it, Mr. Armadale? I sing a little to my own accompaniment, ladies and gentlemen; and, if quite agreeable, I shall be proud and happy to do my best." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{does seem}} {{so hard to}} me," [...] said Silverbridge, [...] "to find any {{difference}} between the two sets. You who are a true Conservative are much more <b>like</b> to <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> who is a Liberal, than to your own, who is on the same side as yourself." ...|$|R
25|$|Whereas <b>my</b> <b>father</b> laid {{upon you}} a heavy yoke, so shall I add tenfold thereto. Whereas <b>my</b> <b>father</b> chastised (tortured) you with whips, so shall I chastise you with scorpions. For my littlest finger is thicker than <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> loins; and your backs, which bent <b>like</b> reeds at <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> touch, shall break <b>like</b> straws at <b>my</b> own touch.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{shall be}} treated <b>like</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> in the country," [...] Hassim was saying. A heavy dew dripped off the rigging and the darkened sails were black on the pale azure of the sky. [...] "You {{shall be the}} father who advises for good--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Max. [...] And thou hast been [...] So treacherous? That looks not <b>like</b> <b>my</b> <b>father!</b> [...] 195 [...] I trusted not thy words, when thou didst tell me [...] Evil of him; {{much less}} can I now do it, [...] That thou calumniatest thy own self.|$|E
6000|$|BEATRICE: What is it {{that you}} say? I was just {{thinking}} 'Twere better not to struggle any more. Men, <b>like</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> have been dark and bloody, [...] 55 Yet never--Oh! Before worse comes of it 'Twere wise to die: it ends in that at last.|$|E
6000|$|... "Rule of three," [...] said Isobel, [...] "I'm {{quite good}} at it. You see I <b>like</b> figures. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> {{says it is}} the family {{business}} instinct. Here, let me try. Move {{to the other side}} of that big chair, there's plenty of room for two, and show it to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah!' sighed Fernando. 'I {{never heard}} {{anything}} <b>like</b> it since <b>my</b> <b>father</b> said he'd take the cow-hide to poor old Diego, if he caught him teaching me nigger-cant.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{just what}} used to be said of his father. Colonel Brownlow says he is the most <b>like</b> <b>my</b> poor young <b>father</b> of all the children." ...|$|R
