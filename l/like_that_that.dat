Guggenheim said: I've never had so much fun writing a script before ... It was such a blast to work on... I keep telling everyone that we should try for Avengers. It's these two heroes together with a big production value. ... There's the opportunity for inside jokes, and seeing all of the characters together. What happens when Cisco gets his eyes on Thea?

Much {{of it had}} to be {{scrapped}} {{though as}} Broderick had injured his knee badly during the scenes of running through neighbors' backyards. [...] "I was pretty sore", Broderick said. [...] "I got well enough to do {{what you see in the}} parade there, but I couldn't do most of Kenny Ortega's knee spins and things <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> we had worked on. When we did shoot it, we had all this choreography and I remember John would yell with a megaphone, 'Okay, do it again, but don't do any of the choreography,' because he wanted it to be a total mess." [...] "Danke Schoen" [...] was somewhat choreographed but for [...] "Twist and Shout", Broderick said, [...] "we were just making everything up".

500|$|The character's {{return in}} April 2008 saw drastic changes to his personality. [...] Edmondson attested that Abra {{returned}} in [...] "a fragile state" [...] following a traumatic {{incident in the}} Congo, and had become [...] "genuinely horrible". He said of the transformation: [...] "He's not as humorous {{as he used to}} be. I used to <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> <b>that</b> sardonic wit that he used to have and it's kind of gone out of the window. But you can be quite funny when you're feeling everything's pointless. He does some things that are so cruel and cold that they're actually quite funny." [...] While the character had once been known for his brash taste in bright, flamboyant shirts, The Sun noted that Abra's return saw him a [...] "shadow of his former self", wearing far less colourful apparel as a reflection of his more subdued state of mind. [...] Edmondson agreed that Abra's new wardrobe of shirts [...] "aren't quite as bright and dazzling - but that suits his current mood." ...|$|E
500|$|Burton {{insisted that}} the film be bloody, as he felt stage {{versions}} of the play which {{cut back on the}} bloodshed robbed it of its power. For him, [...] "Everything is so internal with Sweeney that [...] is like his emotional release. It's more about catharsis than it is a literal thing." [...] Producer Richard D. Zanuck said that [...] " [...] had a very clear plan that he wanted to lift that up into a surreal, almost Kill Bill kind of stylization. We had done tests and experiments with the neck slashing, with the blood popping out. I remember saying to Tim, 'My God, do we dare do this?'" [...] On set, the fake blood was colored orange to render correctly on the desaturated color film used, and crew members wore bin liners to avoid getting stained while filming. This macabre tone made some studios nervous, and it was not until Warner Bros., DreamWorks and Paramount had signed up for the project that the film's $50 million budget was covered. Burton said [...] "the studio was cool about it and they accepted it because they knew what the show was. Any movie is a risk, but it is {{nice to be able to}} do something <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> doesn't fit into the musical or slasher movie categories." ...|$|E

In 2002, Milian was appointed {{the host of the}} live competitive music series Becoming Presents: Wannabe on MTV, where she met director Joseph Kahn.

500|$|Loveless {{was largely}} {{recorded}} in mono sound, as Shields felt it {{important that the}} album's sound consisted of [...] "the guitar smack bang {{in the middle and}} no chorus, no modulation effect". Shields wavers his guitar's tremolo bar as he strums, which contributes, in part, to the band's distinctive sound. This technique—nicknamed [...] "Glide guitar"—causes the guitar strings to bend slightly in and out of tune. Shields said that due to his use of the tremolo bar, [...] "People were thinking it's hundreds of guitars, when it's actually got less guitar tracks than most people's demo tapes have." [...] The guitarist asserted that unlike other bands of the shoegazing movement of the early 1990s, My Bloody Valentine did not use chorus or flanger pedals. He insisted, [...] "No other band played that guitar like me [...] We did everything solely with the tremolo arm". Shields aimed to use [...] "very simple minimal effects" [...] which often were the result of involved studio work. He stated, [...] "The songs are really simply structured. A lot of them are purposely <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> <b>That</b> way {{you can get away with}} a lot more when you mess around with the contents". In a 1992 Guitar World interview, Shields described how he achieved a sound akin to a wah-wah pedal on [...] "I Only Said" [...] by playing his guitar through an amplifier with a graphic equaliser preamp. After recording the track, he then bounced it to another track through a parametric equaliser while he adjusted the EQ levels manually. The interviewer asked if Shields could have achieved the same effect more easily by simply using a wah-wah pedal, to which the guitarist replied, [...] "In attitude toward sound, yes. But not in approach." ...|$|E

While {{there were many}} good best-selling writers before him, King, more than anybody since John D. MacDonald, brought reality to genre novels. He has often remarked that 'Salem's Lot was [...] "Peyton Place meets Dracula. And so it was. The rich characterization, the careful and caring social eye, the interplay of story line and character development announced that writers could take worn themes such as vampirism and make them fresh again. Before King, many popular writers found their efforts to make their books serious blue-penciled by their editors. ‘Stuff like that {{gets in the way}} of the story,' they were told. Well, it's stuff <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> has made King so popular, and helped free the popular name from the shackles of simple genre writing. He is a master of masters." ...|$|E
2500|$|Opeth {{were signed}} by Candlelight without a demo. For them, {{to go into}} the studio to record a demo was as big a step as going in to record an album. Åkerfeldt explained, [...] "We didn't have any money to spend on things <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> <b>That</b> would cost us, at least, a couple of hundred bucks... We didn't know where to go to record a demo." [...] Åkerfeldt had sent out {{rehearsal}} tapes to several labels, but never received a reply. But the band received an offer from Lee Barrett to record an album. Åkerfeldt found it [...] "quite weird". Anders Nyström (of Katatonia) said Candlelight was interested, based on a rumor from Samoth (of Emperor). Samoth had sent out a tape of unsigned bands to Barrett at Candlelight.

2500|$|The {{effort of}} {{creating}} such a monumental pictureRoberts nicknamed it [...] "The Big Picture"took {{its toll on}} the artist. Nicknamed [...] "Bulldog", he drew {{a picture of a}} bulldog escaping a collar and chain in a letter he wrote informing that the picture was near completion. He described the painting once as his [...] "Frankenstein of 17 feet." [...] Roberts's eyesight was weakened by the strain in representing so many likenesses accurately and the importance that he placed on the task sapped his strength. The biographer Humphrey McQueen claims the picture gave Roberts [...] "an inflated idea of [...] own importance". However, Roberts never established himself as an artist in England and slipped into depression. The completion of the painting is generally seen as a turning point in his artistic career, after which his work never again reached the same heights. Roberts family reject this consensus as a [...] "myth", with his great-granddaughter, artist Lisa Roberts, stating [...] "His son, my grandfather, Caleb, documented that for a year he was depressed which isn't surprising after a huge commission <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> took him away from the thing he loved most which was the landscape. But after that, he went back to it. He continued to paint but not with the desire to be rich and famous." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the band}} {{continues}} to incorporate occasional elements of ska into their music, The Aquabats have since distanced {{themselves from their}} association with the ska genre after having moved away from an overtly ska-based sound in the early 2000s, having since labeled themselves as simply a [...] "rock band" [...] in their official press biographies. In a 2012 interview, singer Christian Jacobs stated [...] "I don't think we ever considered ourselves a ska band. We were just The Aquabats. And some of the songs we happened to play were ska", noting elsewhere, [...] "It was never a deliberate thing , but I think it just naturally happened because there's {{a lot of different}} styles of music that we play. I've always been into bands like Ween and things <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> <b>that</b> can chameleon-like drift from genre to genre and play whatever music they want...there's no boundaries. If you set yourself up as a punk band, then you pretty much just have to play punk. Or if you're a ska band, you just play ska". Chad Larson, speaking on the same matter, explained [...] "Having the same guitar rhythm for every song gets kind of boring...even on the earlier albums that had ska rhythms we were focusing more on the 'adventure' songs than really 'ska' songs. So as we grew as musicians, we wanted to experiment with different rhythms", adding [...] "we were never really a good ska band anyway".|$|E
