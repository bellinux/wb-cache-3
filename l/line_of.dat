North of the Grassmarket the wall runs alongside Granny's Green Steps and has been incorporated into later buildings, including the former Greyfriars Mission Kirk. A <b>line</b> <b>of</b> granite paving across the Grassmarket marks the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> the wall where it was uncovered during construction work in 2008. In the Vennel the last remaining bastion of the town walls survives. The Flodden Tower, as it is sometimes known, comprises two remaining walls with a total length of , pierced by crosslet gunloops and a 19th-century window. Sections of the Flodden Wall can be seen within Greyfriars Kirkyard, adorned with 16th and 17th century tombstones. At the junction of Forrest Road and Bristo Street a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> cobbles and a narrow gap in the later buildings mark the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> the wall.
