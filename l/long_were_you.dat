5000|$|On {{the morning}} of February 10, 1976, Sylvia Mendenhall was walking through the {{concourse}} of Detroit Metropolitan Airport after disembarking a commercial flight returning from Los Angeles. During her walk through the airport, she was noticed by two Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents. The two agents grew suspicious, later stating that she appeared to have {{the characteristics of a}} person unlawfully transporting narcotics. The agents approached Mendenhall and identified themselves as federal agents. Following procedure, they began to question Ms. Mendenhall; their questions included, [...] "How <b>long</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> in California?" [...] to which she responded by stating that hers was a short, two-day trip. The agents later asked her to present identification and an airline ticket. She presented her driver’s license and the airline ticket to the agents. The name on the driver’s license said “Sylvia Mendenhall”, yet the name on the airline ticket was “Annette Ford”. Upon questioning, she responded, “I just felt like using that name.” [...] "Agent Anderson then specifically identified himself as a federal narcotics agent and, according to his testimony, the respondent [...] "became quite shaken, extremely nervous. She had a hard time speaking." [...] The agents requested that the respondent accompany them to the DEA office at the Airport; she did so willingly. At the office, the agents asked for permission to inspect her handbag and her person and informed her of her right to decline. She responded, [...] "Go ahead," [...] while handing her purse to the agent. A female police officer arrived at the office to conduct the search. The officer also proclaimed that the respondent had the right to decline to the search. When asked to remove her clothes, she explained that she had a flight to catch, but was assured that if she had no narcotics on her, {{that there would be no}} issues. Without further comments, she began to disrobe. Two packages were found beneath her undergarments and were handed to the policewoman. One package appeared to contain an illegal substance. The respondent was arrested for possession of heroin. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan denied the motion to suppress the evidence. The court concluded that the agents' actions were permissible in investigating suspicion of criminal activity. The respondent voluntarily accompanied the agents to the DEA office. The court convicted Sylvia Mendenhall. The court of appeals reversed the decision, stating that the respondent did not properly consent to the search.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} recall of {{temporal}} information in very long term memory, particularly event duration. Experiments 1 through 4 examine the estimation of public event duration, for example, how long the Falkland's war lasted. Subjects in Experiment 6, Part a, were asked to date events they had personally experienced (autobiographical events) and thus indicate the time elapsed since the event's occurrence. Subjects in this Experiment {{were also asked to}} recall other information about events, such as where they occurred: the event aspects 'what', 'where' and 'who' were used both as prompts to recall and as the aspects to be recalled. In Experiment 6, Part b, subjects estimated the duration of two types of autobiographical events: empty and filled duration events. Events typical of these two types of event are respectively, 'How long after you ordered the computer game did it arrive?' and 'How <b>long</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> in hospital for?'. 	Experiment 6 employed a method new to memory research, the undirected-diary method. Diarists were used as subjects in this experiment. Their diary records, which were recorded with no prior knowledge of any possible use in research, were obtained and used as a source of information about events they had experienced, for example, the nature and actual duration of events was obtained for Experiment 6, Part b. Because of {{the development of a new}} method, Experiment 5, a survey of diarists, was conducted. The results of this survey are reported in Chapter 3, in which the undirected-diary method is compared to other methods used to investigate autobiographical memory. It is suggested that the undirected-diary method is a useful method, and one which overcomes a number of problems associated with the study of autobiographical memory. Ornstein's (1969) 'storage size' model of duration estimation was examined in Experiment 2 and Experiment 6, Part b. In general, little support was found for this model and an alternative model was developed: the reconstructive model of duration estimation. Predictions made on the basis of this model were tested in Experiment 4, the results of which generally supported the model. Experiment 6, Part a, found results consistent with other studies of event dating and studies which have examined autobiographical memory. Absolute dating error increased and signed dating error varied systematically with retention interval. Recall of event aspect information varied systematically with the cues provided for recall and was interpreted within a uniqueness explanation of autobiographical memory organization...|$|E
