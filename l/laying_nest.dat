40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} in Wolaita Zone, Southern Ethiopia to assess local egg selection practices, brooding practices, practices of breaking broodiness, techniques of egg fertility testing, and factors related with incubation. A multi-stage sampling procedure was employed to select weredas, sample kebeles and respondents in which the three weredas were selected by purposive sampling technique. Pretested structured questionnaire and focused group discussion were employed to generate data. All generated survey {{data were analyzed using}} descriptive statistics of SPSS 20. Broody hens were the only means of egg incubation and chick brooding. Broody hens were selected based primarily on body size, broody character, ability of defending predator and number of eggs laid from which broody character predominates the other parameters. Eggs laid at home were the predominant source of egg for incubation and selected mainly based on size, shape and season in which the egg is laid. A bamboo basket bedded with teff straw, a nest on the ground and a nest under bed were the common <b>laying</b> <b>nest</b> preparations. Farmers practiced to store eggs in either directly on the <b>laying</b> <b>nest,</b> in cold room and on the grain. The preferable season of allowing broody hen to hatch was from October to December because of better feed access, less predator and better chick survivability. Majority of the farmers practice cleaning the egg by cloth as treatment. Shaking the egg was the commonly used method of checking egg fertility. Farmers attempt to increase egg production by stimulating broody hens to resume laying through various practices from which moving to neighbors was the most common...|$|E

Layers kept at Poultry Experiment Station, Tandojam, on flour system, each group provided one <b>laying</b> <b>nest,</b> 16 hr florescent light and 2 sq. ft space per layer were provided. Birds fed 100 g/layer/day and water was provided 24 h. Eggs were collected at 10, 14 and 18 h daily, soundness was checked and stored in dark room. 50 candled and fit eggs randomly selected and settled into hatchery for incubation. Candling was practiced on 3 rd and 14 th day and turning was practiced daily. Hatched chicks of each group were collected, weighed and brooded over two weeks. Layers average feed intake (682, 686 and 685 g/b/w) and egg weight (40. 36, 40. 45 and 40. 54 g/egg) were almost increased followed by significant increase in egg production (5. 03, 5. 19 and 5. 21 egg/b/week) {{with the increase in}} breeding layer group size for a cock in A,B and groups, respectively.

50|$|A female wasp of {{this species}} may take {{anywhere}} from 30 to 60 flies as food to provision each one of her nests; she makes a new nest for every egg she <b>lays.</b> <b>Nests</b> are simple burrows some 15 cm deep, with a single enlarged chamber at the bottom. An egg is laid in the empty chamber, and the female wasp brings back paralyzed flies until the chamber is full (mass provisioning), at which point she closes the nest and begins another. Numerous females often excavate nests within a small area where the soil is suitable, creating large and sometimes very dense nesting aggregations. Nearly all the prey are biting female horse-flies; exceptionally, other flies such as Odontomyia and the screw-worm fly Cochliomyia are taken.|$|R

Large numbers of adult fleas and larvae were extracted by Tullgren funnel from samples of wood shavings used as nest box material. Lower numbers were extracted from the litter under these nest boxes. A pilot trial using infested nest boxes and floor litter showed good control of adult fleas and larvae could be obtained using a. 25 % spray prepared from a permethrin water dispersable powder. In more extensive trials the following year, almost complete control of hen fleas and larvae was obtained following monthly treatments of nest boxes with a. 125 % permethrin spray or a 1 % permethrin powder.

Exploring, alone, {{deep into the}} Tarra Valley vegetation and frequently into dangerous areas where the best-unspoilt specimens were and the egg <b>laying</b> <b>nests</b> of the lyrebird could be found. Kara became one with the natural environment around her. By 1961 Kara had collected over 160 specimens which included types of toadstool and fungi. Significantly, two new types of fungi were named after her - Poria healeyi and Lambertella healeyi. Poria healeyi, which was a previously unidentified fungus causing yellow straw rot in Mountain Ash, and the second, Lambertella healeyi was a fungus growing on another fungus. Further, Kara collected animal and insect specimens using dead animals that she found and forwarded those as well. In total over 500 specimens were collected which also included 80 species of moss. Subsequently Tarra Valley is the most thoroughly studied and recorded area in Australia at the time.|$|R

50|$|Reptiles, such as {{sea turtles}} {{spend most of}} their lives in the ocean. However, their life cycle {{requires}} the females to come on shore and <b>lay</b> their <b>nests</b> on the beach. Consequently, the hatchlings emerge from the sand and have to run toward the water. Depending on their species, sea turtles are described to have either a symmetrical gait (diagonally opposite limbs are moving together) or an asymmetrical gait (Contra-lateral limbs move together). For example, loggerhead sea turtle hatchlings are commonly seen exhibiting symmetrical gait on sand, whereas, leatherback sea turtles employ the asymmetrical gait while on land. Notably, leatherbacks employ their front (pelvic) flippers more during forward terrestrial locomotion. Sea turtles can be seen nesting on subtropical and tropical beaches all around the world and exhibit such behavior such as arribada (Collective animal behavior). This is a phenomenon seen in Kemp's Ridley turtles which emerge all at once in one night only onto the beach to <b>lay</b> their <b>nests.</b>|$|R

A climate chamber was equipped with a floor housing system. The housing system contained a bedding area, a manure bin area with manure conveyors below a draining floor and <b>laying</b> <b>nests</b> that placed close to an end wall. The age of the hens had no influence on the release of ammonia. However, the age had an effect on the amount of manure stored in the bedding which influenced the release of ammonia.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate pens switching, closing nest boxes after egg <b>laying</b> and <b>nest</b> boxes switching inside the same pen as management procedures for controlling broodiness in turkey and Muscovy duck breeders and their role in circulating prolactin. Black bronze turkey (n. = 350) and Muscovy duck (n. = 700) were randomly selected and housed on deep litter. The results showed a significant (P ≤ 0. 05) increase in egg production in turkey and Muscovy duck breeders in response to pens switching and closing nest boxes after end of egg laying. While, there was no significant (P > 0. 05) difference in egg production in response to switching of nest boxes in turkey hens but a significant (P ≤ 0. 05) result was found in Muscovy ducks. On the other hand, there were significant (P ≤ 0. 05) decreases in circulating prolactin level and broodiness in both turkey and Muscovy duck breeders in response to pen switching, closing nest boxes after egg <b>laying</b> and <b>nest</b> boxes switching. In conclusion, application of these management procedures was associated with increased egg production while decreased expression of broodiness (incubation behaviour) and circulating prolactin in turkey hens and Muscovy ducks...|$|R

40|$|Under temperature-dependent sex {{determination}} (TSD), temperatures experienced by embryos during development determine {{the sex of}} the offspring. Consequently, populations of organisms with TSD have the potential to be strongly impacted by climatic warming that could bias offspring sex ratio, a fundamental demographic parameter involved in population dynamics. Moreover, many taxa with TSD are imperiled, so research on this phenomenon, particularly long-term field study, has assumed great urgency. Recently, turtles with TSD have joined the diverse list of taxa that have demonstrated population- level changes in breeding phenology in response to recent climate change. This raises the possibility that any adverse impacts of climate change on populations may be alleviated by individual plasticity in nesting phenology. Here, we examine data from a long-term study on a population of painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) to determine whether changes in phenology are due to individual plasticity and whether individual plasticity in the timing of nesting has the capacity to offset the sex ratio effects of a rise in climatic temperature. We find that individual females show plasticity in the date of first nesting each year, and that this plasticity depends on the climate from the previous winter. First nesting date is not repeatable within individuals, suggesting that it would not respond to selection. Sex ratios of hatchlings within a nest declined nonsignificantly over the nesting season. However, small increases in summer temperature had a much stronger effect on nest sex ratios than did <b>laying</b> <b>nests</b> earlier in the season. For this and other reasons, it seems unlikely that individual plasticity in the timing of nesting will offset the effects of climate change on sex ratios in this population, and we hypothesize that this conclusion applies to other populations with TSD...|$|R
