5|$|In 1982, {{the club}} {{decided that it}} would build a new 2,400-seat stand on the eastern long side. A <b>low</b> <b>{{construction}}</b> cost was secured because the construction industry {{was going through a}} slump. The costs were covered by NOK2.5 million in national lottery grants and NOK2 million in loan, which was planned to be repaid through increased sponsor and ticket revenues from increased attendance. The upgrade also included a reconstruction of the club house to facilitate luxury boxes. They were made available for sponsors, who were allowed to bring guests. The boxes and the vestibule became an important informal meeting area for the town's political and business elite.|$|E
5|$|The Rockefeller Center had {{originally}} been intended by John D. Rockefeller, Jr. {{to be a new}} location for the Metropolitan Opera House, but the Stock Market Crash brought an end to the scheme. Rockefeller decided to develop a large office center instead, taking advantage of the <b>low</b> <b>construction</b> costs during the recession. At the center of the development was the RCA Building, heavily influenced by architect Raymond Hood. The long, slab-like RCA had two distinct axes – from one side, it appeared to be a narrow tower, from the other it rose like a sheer wall. Not only was the structure highly distinctive, but it was also economically very effective. The design maximized the available light to the offices and eliminated any darker internal rooms, as the core of the building was entirely taken up with elevators and other engineering services. It took until 1940 before all of the building had been filled by tenants.|$|E
25|$|Where a dam serves {{multiple}} purposes, a hydroelectric station may {{be added}} with relatively <b>low</b> <b>construction</b> cost, providing a useful revenue stream {{to offset the}} costs of dam operation. It has been calculated that the sale of electricity from the Three Gorges Dam will cover the construction costs after 5 to 8 years of full generation. Additionally, some data shows that in most countries large hydropower dams will be too costly and take too long to build to deliver a positive risk adjusted return, unless appropriate risk management measures are put in place.|$|E

From the {{discussion}} {{of the importance of the}} <b>low</b> carbon <b>construction</b> technology in China, the <b>low</b> carbon <b>construction</b> techniques are summarized in this paper, and especially the main <b>low</b> carbon <b>construction</b> techniques have been analyzed theoretically, then its application foundation and feasibility have been made clear. Through the case analysis, the actual effects of the <b>low</b> carbon <b>construction</b> technology have been grasped, so the related to issues of development optimization have been put forward, in the end can provide the reliable basis of promotion for <b>low</b> carbon <b>construction</b> techniques...|$|R

50|$|The {{switched}} {{reluctance motor}} (SRM) {{is a form of}} stepper motor that uses fewer poles. The SRM has the <b>lowest</b> <b>construction</b> cost of any industrial electric motor because of its simple structure. Common uses for an SRM include applications where the rotor must be held stationary for long periods, and in potentially explosive environments such as mining because it does not have a mechanical commutator.|$|R
25|$|Although budgeted to be {{completed}} for $5 million, in November Salem approved an additional $1 million {{to be spent on}} stadium construction. The following April, costs again rose to $10.1 million for its completion primarily as a result of <b>low</b> <b>construction</b> estimates. Slated to open {{for the start of the}} 1995 season, its opening was pushed back to May 22 then to June 20 and July 25 due to construction delays. On August 7, the stadium opened before a standing-room only crowd of 6,421 with the Avalanche defeating the Frederick Keys 3–2 in 15 innings.|$|E
25|$|On 23 April 2014, the USAF {{announced}} that the KC-46 Pegasus will be based at McConnell Air Force Base in Wichita, Kansas. The base will start receiving the first of 36 tankers in 2016. The KC-135 Stratotanker is currently stationed at this base. McConnell AFB was chosen because it had <b>low</b> <b>construction</b> costs {{and it is in}} a location with a high demand for air refueling. Up to 10 operating bases are to be chosen for the KC-46 fleet. Pegasus crews will be trained at Altus Air Force Base, Oklahoma. Altus AFB was also chosen for its limited construction needs and for other training programs for the C-17 Globemaster and KC-135 already at the base.|$|E
25|$|Funds {{available}} to the development and maintenance of affordable housing are scarce and, {{in order to maximize}} the supply of housing, <b>low</b> <b>construction</b> costs are often favored in choosing projects. However, one of the main arguments for green affordable housing is that a higher upfront cost for construction/renovation can be motivated by a lower operating cost over the life-time of the building, i.e. a lower life-cycle cost. If the initial investment leads to lower operating costs and/or higher durability the higher upfront capital cost needed for construction or renovation can be justified. This is especially true considering that public funding and tax breaks (like the low-income housing tax credit) for housing often require a longer term perspective from its builders. However, the need to preserve affordability of housing sometimes restricts value enhancement over time and may thus be a barrier to investing in green features.|$|E

25|$|Tourism {{became a}} major industry, {{especially}} in the Myrtle Beach area. With its semitropical climate, cheap land and <b>low</b> <b>construction</b> costs (because of low wages), the state became a developer's dream. Barrier islands, such as Kiawah and Hilton Head, were developed as retirement communities for wealthy outsiders. The state's attempts to manage coastal development in an orderly and environmentally sound manner have run afoul of federal court decisions. The U.S. Supreme Court (in Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council) ruled that the state, in forbidding construction on threatened beachfront property, had, in effect, seized the plaintiff's property without due process of law. The rush to build upscale housing along the coast paid its price in {{the billions of dollars}} of losses as Hurricane Hugo swept through on September 21–22, 1989. Charleston was more used to hurricanes; historical preservation groups immediately stepped in to begin salvage and reconstruction, with the result that one year after Hugo, the city was virtually returned to normal.|$|E

500|$|Stelmach's {{approach}} to this deteriorating fiscal situation, part of a global recession, was to invest heavily in infrastructure {{in an effort to}} stimulate the economy and take advantage of <b>low</b> <b>construction</b> costs. [...] He went as far as to advocate borrowing for capital construction, a departure from the Klein government's notoriously anti-debt approach. [...] However, his government was also one of only two in Canada (the other being Saskatchewan's) to cut overall spending in the 2009–2010 budget. This approach drew the ire of Liberal leader David Swann, who supported increased government spending for economic stimulus purposes, but drew support from some economists and was defended by Evans on the basis that capital spending was at twice the per capital level of the Canadian average.|$|E

Five [...] "gangs" [...] of workers were allocated to a [...] length of Great Northern Highway between Meekatharra and Wyndham. However, given the vast distance the highway travelled, and destructive cyclones in the Pilbara and Gascoyne that could destroy multiple weeks worth of work, the overall improvement was relatively insignificant. Over time, though, the road was improved.

Now it is the case that the {{traveller}} who travels into Argyllshire, Perthshire, and Inverness, expects to find lovely scenery; and it was also true that the country through which they had passed for the last twenty miles had been not only bleak and barren, but uninteresting and ugly. It was all rough open moorland, never rising into mountains, and graced by no running streams, by no forest scenery, almost by no foliage. The lodge itself did indeed stand close upon a little river, and was reached by a bridge that crossed it; but there was nothing pretty either in the river or the bridge. It was a placid black little streamlet, which in that portion of its course was hurried by no steepness, had no broken rocks in its bed, no trees on its low banks, and played none of those gambols which make running water beautiful. The bridge was a simple <b>low</b> <b>construction</b> with a low parapet, carrying an ordinary roadway up to the hall door. The lodge itself was as ugly as a house could be, white, of two stories, with the door in the middle and windows on each side, with a slate roof, and without a tree near it. It {{was in the middle of}} the shooting, and did not create a town around itself as do sumptuous mansions, to the great detriment of that seclusion which is favourable to game. [...] "Look at Killancodlem," [...] Dobbes had been heard to say--"a very fine house for ladies to flirt in; but if you find a deer within six miles of it I will eat him first and shoot him afterwards."
