40|$|Micro-organisms {{possibly}} causing {{infectious diseases}} such as gastroenteritis or inflammation of the ear were detected in bathing water that complied with the current European Bathing Water Directive 76 / 160 /EEG. On {{the basis of the}} stricter guidelines in the revised Bathing Water Directive 2006 / 7 /EC, the quality of these bathing waters was assessed as being less favourable. In this study, the presence of <b>pathogenic</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> was related to the current and revised European bathing water guidelines at two official bathing sites in the Netherlands, Katwijk-Noord and Vinkeveenseplassen (island 1). Indicator parameters in the revised Bathing Water Directive were analysed by using two different (permitted) detection methods. The (potentially) <b>pathogenic</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Vibrio, Cryptosporidium and Giardia were detected at both sampling sites. Campylobacter was not found at Katwijk-Noord, but was detected at Vinkeveenseplassen. Salmonella, norovirus and enterovirus were not detected at either site, whereas rotavirus was detected once at Katwijk-Noord and adenovirus once at Vinkeveenseplassen. According to the current Bathing Water Directive, water quality was 'excellent' at Katwijk-Noord and 'good' at Vinkeveenseplassen. The use of different methods for detecting the revised Bathing Water Directive parameters resulted in deviant assessments of water quality. Based on membrane filtration results, water quality at Katwijk-Noord was rated 'good', whereas on the basis of MPN results it was 'acceptable'. Bathing water quality at Vinkeveenseplassen was assessed 'poor' by either method. The assessment of bathing water quality at Dutch bathing sites was, according to the revised Bathing Water Directive, indicated as being dependent on the detection method used for faecal indicators.

40|$|<b>Pathogenic</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> {{have evolved}} many {{strategies}} {{to counteract the}} antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that they encounter upon entry into host systems. These strategies play vital roles in the virulence of <b>pathogenic</b> <b>micro-organisms.</b> The Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium genome has a gene cluster consisting of yejA, yejB, yejE and yejF genes, which encode a putative ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter. Our study shows that these genes constitute an operon. We deleted the yejF gene, which encodes the ATPase component of the putative ABC transporter. The Δ yejF strain showed increased sensitivity to protamine, melittin, polymyxin B, human defensin (HBD) - 1 and HBD- 2, and was compromised in its capacity to proliferate inside activated macrophages and epithelial cells. Inside Intestine 407 cells, Salmonella was found to co-localize with human defensins HD- 5 and HBD- 1; {{this suggests that the}} ability to counteract AMPs in the intracellular milieu is important for Salmonella. In a murine typhoid model, the Δ yejF strain displayed decreased virulence when infected intragastrically.

40|$|A 2006 {{study of}} the {{microbiological}} quality of rainwater collected in reservoirs demonstrated that this water was fecally contaminated at all instances and sometimes contained <b>pathogenic</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> such as Campylobacter, Legionella, Cryptosporidium or Giardia. The amount of rainfall and rainfall intensity influenced the level of faecal contamination of the water. The study reported here - a follow up to a pilot study on the microbiological quality of collected rainwater carried out in 2005 - dealt specifically with the effect of environmental conditions on the microbiological quality of collected rainwater. Samples were taken from three reservoirs at various environmental conditions to study the effect of drought, heavy and normal rainfall (whether or not {{after a period of}} drought) and temperature. The presence of Campylobacter, Salmonella, Vibrio, Legionella, Cryptosporidium, Giardia and enteroviruses was determined. The number of faecal indicator bacteria in the reservoirs increased with high rainfall intensity, especially after a period of drought, and <b>pathogenic</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> such as Campylobacter were detected.

40|$|Motivation: In {{early stage}} of therapeutics, several {{structure}} and ligand-based in-silico approaches have aided the modern drug discovery and design. However, such techniques are limited by availability of resolved 3 D structures of targets and ligands. At {{the same time the}} growing concern of drug resistivity not only demands for new drugs but also the judicious use of presently available drugs. In such a scenario, the utilization of the already available drugs of a target molecule over the different homologous target of wider range of organisms is the better perspective for treatment. This requires confirmation of structural similarity of the targets (enzyme and protein targets) in those organisms. Results: In the present study, based on the structural similarity of the target enzymes shared by different <b>pathogenic</b> <b>micro-organisms,</b> we have reviewed to gain an in-silico perspective of their efficacy in targeting a wider subset of organisms with few available drugs marketed for those. The results suggest efficient binding affinity of such drugs for the enzymes of organisms belonging to the cluster formed on the basis of structurally similarity.

40|$|Rainwater {{collected}} in reservoirs {{and used for}} toilet flushing, for example, is often fecally contaminated and sometimes contains pathogenic bacteria. Estimating risk of infection caused by use of this water, will require additional research for enumerating and typing pathogens and for determining exposure to the contaminated water. Rainwater at the source is not contaminated with potential human <b>pathogenic</b> <b>micro-organisms,</b> but may become so at surface run-off and during storage in containers. This may occur when bird faeces runs off roofs, or rats or other animals have access to rainwater reservoirs or open mains. Examination of collected rainwater at four different sites in the Netherlands showed the presence of faecal indicator bacteria as total coliforms, E. coli and intestinal enterococci in 28, 27 and 27, respectively, of the 28 samples examined. Each of the potential human pathogenic bacteria, Campylobacter and Legionella pneumophila, was detected once at one sampling site. Aeromonas and Clostridium perfringens, which may also cause disease in humans, were detected in 20 and 23 of the 28 tested samples, respectively.

However, shellfish are also well known vectors for human illness as {{they are capable of}} bio-accumulating <b>pathogenic</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> from the wider environment within somatic tissues and hence, are capable of transferring these pathogens into the human food chain. Current European efforts to safeguard consumers include the routine bacteriological monitoring of shellfish tissues using E. coli as a proxy for potential <b>pathogenic</b> <b>micro-organisms.</b> The aims of this thesis were firstly, to identify and quantify the bacterial reservoirs present in commercial shellfish harvesting areas. Secondly, to determine the relative contribution of these reservoirs under different mitigation techniques, and thirdly, {{to examine the relationship between}} the bacterial and viral reservoirs present within shellfish tissues. A single commercial mussel (Mytilus edulis) bed was intensively surveyed to identify both spatial and temporal changes in the bacterial reservoir present within mussel tissues and to examine the relationship between the bacterial reservoir present within the mussel tissues and concentrations of bacteria present in the underlying sediment. This study concluded that the underlying sediments represented a greater bacterial reservoir than within the mussel tissues, however no spatial relationship between the two reservoirs was evident. In addition, we investigated the potential of epizoic organisms to act as a bacterial reservoir. The findings from this study demonstrated that epizoic barnacles contained more than 80...|$|R
