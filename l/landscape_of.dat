40|$|AbstractThis study {{documents}} {{results on}} scenic beauty preferences for the <b>landscapes</b> <b>of</b> Fraser's Hill. The {{results indicate that}} i) natural landscapes have influenced the tourism industry of Fraser's Hill. ii) landscapes with good ecology and man-made attributes have significant relationship to scenic beauty iii) most tourists preferred viewing the <b>landscapes</b> <b>of</b> forest, hilly landform and architectural heritage, iv) most tourists were less preferred for the <b>landscapes</b> <b>of</b> water fall and lake. In conclusion, the attributes of forest, hilly landform and architectural heritage have significant scenic value. The insight may suggest that scenic beauty can be an indicator to good ecology <b>of</b> <b>landscapes</b> <b>of</b> Fraser's Hill...|$|R

Although, KKR's track record since RJR Nabisco was mixed, losses on such investments as Regal Entertainment Group, Spalding, Flagstar and Primedia (previously K-III Communications) were offset by successes in Willis Group, Wise Foods, Inc., Wincor Nixdorf and MTU Aero Engines, among others.|$|E
40|$|This article {{discusses}} the <b>landscapes</b> <b>of</b> skiing from a heritage and memory perspective. Are there certain <b>landscapes</b> <b>of</b> cross-country skiing {{that can be}} seen as a national and/or local heritage? What constitutes these landscapes and how are they portrayed in tourism and marketing today? By the analysis of three examples - Hindås, Vålådalen and Vasaloppet - this article investigates how history and landscape is used to market skiing and to attract (skiing) tourism. How is skiing constructed as cultural heritage and used for present day purposes? The three before-mentioned cases are compared with fourth, Landvetter, a place where cross-country skiing does not have the same historical connection. The conclusion is that ideas about <b>landscapes</b> <b>of</b> skiing unite Vasaloppet, Vålådalen and Hindås, even though the efforts and commercial effects may differ greatly. Another conclusion is that <b>landscapes</b> <b>of</b> skiing (or any sport) are cultural products, and best understood as a form <b>of</b> cultural heritage. <b>Landscapes</b> <b>of</b> sport are now being articulated as sites of cultural heritage, much resembling the articulation process of other previously neglected <b>landscapes</b> <b>of</b> industry, research, cities and other. This articulation implies a broadening of the cultural heritage, a process that risk being paralleled by a commercialization and devaluation of the increasingly inclusive heritage concept. But there are also more positive aspects. The inclusion <b>of</b> <b>landscapes</b> <b>of</b> movement in the cultural heritage can result in both protection and increased attraction, like in the case of the VasaloppsArena.
