40|$|INTRODUCTION: Patients with obstructive {{sleep apnea}} (OSA) often face the {{challenge}} of how to power their positive airway pressure (PAP) devices when alternating current power supplies are not available in remote areas with lack of electricity or frequent power outages. This article elucidates portable power supply options for PAP devices with the aim to increase alternative power source awareness among medical providers. METHODS: A search of scientific databases (Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library) was carried out on the topic of alternative portable power supply options for treatment of OSA. RESULTS: Scientific databases listed above yielded only limited results. Most articles were found via Google search. These articles were reviewed for alternative power supply options for OSA patients when alternating current is not available. The power supply options in this article include <b>lead-acid</b> <b>batteries</b> (<b>starter,</b> marine and deep-cycle batteries), lithium ion batteries, solar kits, battery packs, backup power systems, portable generators, and travel-size PAP devices. CONCLUSIONS: There are several options to power PAP devices with direct current when alternating current is not available. Knowledgeable primary care physicians especially in rural and remote areas can help OSA patients improve PAP compliance in order to mitigate morbidity and long-term complications of OSA...|$|R
50|$|Jump <b>starters</b> are {{portable}} <b>battery</b> {{devices that}} allow for jump starting of vehicles. These devices operate similar to jumper cables but do not require an additional vehicle to provide the power needed to boost the dead vehicle <b>battery.</b> Jump <b>starters</b> come in various sizes (typically rated in Amps). Most jump starters {{on the market today}} use lead-acid batteries and claim 400 to 1700 Amps ratings. The main disadvantage of <b>lead-acid</b> jump <b>starters</b> is weight, size and <b>battery</b> chemistry. <b>Lead-acid</b> jump <b>starters</b> can be extremely heavy and large, making them less than convenient when transporting between vehicles. Lead-acid batteries may self-discharge develop a condition called sulfating, which permanently loses battery capacity. It is entirely possible to destroy a new lead-acid battery within months that will require a replacement.|$|R

50|$|Flooded {{lead-acid}} {{batteries are}} the cheapest and in past most common traction batteries available. There {{are two main}} types of lead-acid batteries: automobile engine <b>starter</b> <b>batteries,</b> and deep cycle batteries. Automobile alternators are designed to provide <b>starter</b> <b>batteries</b> high charge rates for fast charges, while deep cycle batteries used for electric vehicles like forklifts or golf carts, and as the auxiliary house batteries in RV's, require different multi-stage charging. No lead acid battery should be discharged below 50% of its capacity, as it shortens the battery's life. Flooded batteries require inspection of electrolyte level and occasional replacement of water which gases away during the normal charging cycle.|$|R

40|$|In modern {{heavy duty}} trucks the battery {{is a central}} component. Its {{traditional}} role as an energy source for engine cranking has been extended to include powering a number of elec- trical components on the truck, both during driving and during standstill. As a consequence of this {{it is important to}} know how much a battery in use has aged and lost in terms of ca- pacity and power output. The difficulty in measuring these factors on a battery in use causes problem, since heavy duty truck batteries are often replaced too early or too late, leading to unnecessary high replacement costs or truck standstill respectively. The overall goal of the effort, of which this thesis is a part, is to use a model of the cranking behaviour of a heavy duty truck engine, which depends on the battery condition, to estimate the ageing and wear of a heavy duty truck battery. This thesis proposes a modelling approach to model the components involved in engine cranking. In the thesis work, system identification is made of the systems forming part of the cranking of a heavy duty truck engine. These components are the <b>starter</b> <b>battery,</b> the <b>starter</b> motor and its electrical circuit and the internal combustion engine. Measurement data has been provided by Scania AB for the evaluation of the models. The data has been collected from crankings of a heavy duty diesel engine at different temperatures and battery charge levels. For every cranking lapse the battery voltage and current have been measured as well as the engine rotational speed. A <b>starter</b> <b>battery</b> model is developed and evaluated. The resulting battery model is then incorporated into two different engine cranking models, Model 1 and Model 2, including a starter motor model and an internal combustion engine model apart form the battery model. The two cranking models differ in several aspects and their differences and resulting evalu- ations are discussed. The battery model is concluded to be sufficiently accurate during model verification, however the two cranking models are not. Model 2 is verified as more correct in in its output than Model 1, but neither is sufficiently accurate for their purpose. The conclusion is drawn that the modelling approach is sound but development of Model 2 is needed before the model can be used in model-based condition estimation. ...|$|R
