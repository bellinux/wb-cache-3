Due to generally holding lower-ranked jobs, their assigned dwellings were predominantly government-built [...] "hutments" [...] (one-room shacks) located very close to the Y-12 plant, in the one residential area designated as colored. [...] Kenneth Nichols, the MED District Engineer, was told by the main construction contractor for the K-25 plant that the Negro construction labor force had a large turnover rate, so Nichols gave permission to set up a separate black women's camp. When Leslie Groves visited the plant with K. T. Keller of Chrysler, Keller saw twelve Negro women sweeping the thirty-foot wide alley between the production units, and said [...] "Nichols, don't you know there is a machine made to sweep a concrete floor like this?" [...] Nichols replied [...] "Sure I do, but these gals can do more than one of those machines". The men now had an opportunity to [...] "fracas" [...] on Saturday night, and <b>labor</b> <b>turnover</b> had reduced. During the war, plans were made for a colored neighborhood of houses equal in quality to those provided for whites, but it was not implemented due to limited resources.

A conceptual variation between resilience and adaptation was explored to understand the distinction between resilience and adaptation.

Resilience pays {{more attention to the}} short-term response to loss (potential) during and post disaster, while adaptation places stress on system’s response to disaster risk before disaster, loss or impacts in- and after disaster in the long term in order to reduce vulnerability and enhance resilience.

40|$|There exist many {{symptoms}} and emerging economic trends {{suggesting that the}} Japanese economy is headed in the direction where many European economies ended up in much of 1980 s and 1990 s. This paper makes highly speculative long-run forecast, based upon a comparison of two stylized models of the Japanese and "Euro" labor markets. We argue that Japano-Sclerosis, if there is one, should look rather di¤erent from Eurosclerosis in 1980 s and 1990 s. Our forecasts are the following. (1) Because of the resilience of the unique recruiting system of the school leavers, the Japanese economy is unlikely to face chronic high unemployment and joblessness, which plagued the Euro economies for decades, whereas (2) the chronic problem {{in the labor market}} is more likely to manifest itself as extremely low <b>labor</b> <b>turnovers,</b> and stagnant output growth and earnings.

40|$|The thesis {{analyzes}} {{monetary and}} labor policies under different market frictions. In {{the first part}} several versions of a microfounded dynamic general equilibrium model with monopolistic competitors in the product and/or labor market are derived and simulated. First of all, the monetary persistence of a pure price staggering economy is compared to a pure wage staggering economy under different labor market structures (by means of a newly proposed persistence measure) and interactions are explored. Secondly, the thesis simulates the effects of real wage rigidities in a disinflation experiment non-linearly. Thereby, caveats of the conventionally used log-linearization are shown. The {{second part of the}} thesis develops a dynamic microfounded labor market framework with insider wage bargaining, <b>labor</b> <b>turnovers</b> costs and tax distortions. The calibrated model is used in order to analyze different labor market policies. The addressed questions include the labor market development in East Germany after unification, the existence of unemployment traps, their influence on labor market persistence and policy effectiveness, and the optimal targeting of employment subsidies in terms of their employment, equity and welfare implications.

40|$|Firms {{can adjust}} to shocks by laying off and hiring workers or by {{adjusting}} the hours worked by each worker. Adjustment of hours provides job security for employed workers. Adjustment of employment generates higher <b>labor</b> market <b>turnover</b> and, thus, better job prospects for the unemployed. Since high turnover lowers the expected cost of being laid off by reducing the expected duration of unemployment, there is a strategic complementarity between firms {{in the provision of}} job security. This gives the possibility of multiple equilibria with different amounts of turnover. Copyright 1995 by The London School of Economics and Political Science. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of establishment- and industry-level <b>labor</b> market <b>turnover</b> on employees’ job {{satisfaction}} and perceived job insecurity. Our linked employer-employee panel data contain both information on employees’ subjective well-being and register-based information on job and worker flows. The results show that job destruction and worker outflow measures reduce job satisfaction and, especially, perceived security. These effects are much weaker when the individual-specific fixed effects are taken into account. The evidence also reveals that the establishment-level job and worker flows do not translate into higher wages. These findings speak against the existence of compensating wage differentials for job uncertainty. ...|$|R

These predictions are generally confirmed by the parameter estimates, although welfare benefits received when not employed are only found to discourage employment in a restricted model that is rejected by the data.
