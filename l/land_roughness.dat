40|$|With {{extraordinary}} {{resolution and}} accuracy, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) -derived digital elevation models (DEMs) have been increasingly used for watershed analyses and modeling by hydrologists, planners and engineers. Such high-accuracy DEMs have demonstrated their effectiveness in delineating watershed and drainage patterns at fine scales in low-relief terrains. However, these high-resolution datasets are usually only available as topographic DEMs rather than hydrologic DEMs, presenting greater <b>land</b> <b>roughness</b> {{that can affect}} natural flow accumulation. Specifically, locations of drainage structures such as road culverts and bridges were simulated as barriers {{to the passage of}} drainage. This paper proposed a geospatial method for producing LiDAR-derived hydrologic DEMs, which incorporates data collection of drainage structures (i. e., culverts and bridges), data preprocessing and burning of the drainage structures into DEMs. A case study of GIS-based watershed modeling in South Central Nebraska showed improved simulated surface water derivatives after the drainage structures were burned into the LiDAR-derived topographic DEMs. The paper culminates in a proposal and discussion of establishing a national or statewide drainage structure dataset...|$|E

Ground-based point measurement of soil moisture is liable but expensive and impractical for watershed measurement. Remote sensing measurement has provided thriving perspective for spatial and instantaneous measurement of soil moisture. Microwave measurement is effective and successful for surface soil moisture, but {{influenced by the}} vegetation and <b>land</b> <b>roughness,</b> and can’t detect the root zone or below-root zone soil moisture. Vegetation growth is heavily dependent on the water availability in arid and semi-arid areas, and the vegetation index from satellites may respond to the change of soil moisture and reflect the soil moisture to some degree. This study analyzed the profile soil moisture characteristics in three different climate and vegetation sites from Feb 2000 through Apr 2004, compared the collocated and coincided soil moisture and MODIS NDVI, and estimated the soil moisture using NDVI by least square regression model. Results showed that the root and below-root zone soil moisture in semi-arid climate has strong correlation with simultaneous NDVI and can be estimated using NDVI during growing season; the root zone soil moisture in humid climate also has moderate correlation with simultaneous NDVI during growing season; below-root soil moisture in humid climate has weak correlation with NDVI and can’t be effectively estimated using NDVI; Soil moisture has weak correlation with NDVI and can’t be effectively estimated using NDVI during non-growing season (Oct-March) ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{relationships}} between NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and pseudo thermal inertia (land surface temperature difference between day and night AVHRR data) are discussed. A simplified method was established to separate the latent and sensible heat fluxes on vegetation covered land surface. Analogous correlations between surface reflectance and LST (Land Surface Temperature) had been illustrated by several scientists {{who are concerned about}} regional estimation of soil evaporation in arid or semi-arid areas. It proves work well in retrieving of soil evaporation or even aerodynamic resistance of heat transfer [1]. The scattergram of pseudo thermal inertia versus NDVI demonstrates that higher frequency points clearly form a triangle shape, that is to say, the higher frequency points are within the triangle. The upper side of the triangle can be written as: DTu(NDVI) =a(u) +b(u) *NDVI. Similarly, the lower side of it can be denoted as: DTl(NDVI) =a(l) +b(l) *NDVI. Then, Bowen ratio B; can be expressed as following: B-i=(DTu(NDVIi) -DTi) /(DTu(NDVIi) -DTi(NDVIi)) - 1, where DTi is the land surface temperature difference between day and night of the ith pixel, NDVIi; is as well. The soil heat flux G is determined empirically. After separating Rn (net radiation) into Rn-s and Rn, (net radiation for soil and vegetation respectively) based on the vegetation fraction, the G can be obtained by: G= 0. 35 * Rn-s+ 0. 05 * Rn-v, where the constant parameters may vary according to different land cover and land use. Consequently, the separation of latent and sensible heat fluxes can be achieved. The results of this method was compared with in situ data. The characteristic of the method is its simplicity and feasibility especially when the field measurements such as aerodynamic resistance, <b>land</b> <b>roughness</b> and wind speed are not available. At last, two CWSI maps were shown to demonstrate its feasibility to monitor the efficiency of water usage and vegetation growth...|$|E

40|$|International audienceFrictional {{convergence}} {{and thermal}} difference between {{land and sea}} surface are the two surface conditions that govern the intensity and evolution of a coastal front. By means of the mesoscale model MM 5, we investigate the influence of these two processes on wind patterns, temperature and precipitation amounts, associated with a coastal front, observed {{on the west coast}} of The Netherlands in the night between 12 and 13 August 2004. The mesoscale model MM 5 is further compared with available observations and the results of two operational models (ECMWF and HIRLAM). HIRLAM is not capable to reproduce the coastal front, whereas ECMWF and MM 5 both calculate precipitation for the coastal region. The precipitation pattern, calculated by MM 5, agrees satisfactorily with the accumulated radar image. The failure of HIRLAM is mainly due to a different stream pattern at the surface and consequently, a different behaviour of the frictional convergence at the coastline. The sensitivity analysis of frictional convergence is carried out with the MM 5 model, by varying <b>land</b> surface <b>roughness</b> length (z 0). For the sensitivity analysis of thermal difference between sea and land surface, we changed the sea surface temperature (SST). Increasing surface roughness implies stronger convergence near the surface and consequently stronger upward motions and intensification of the development of the coastal front. Setting <b>land</b> surface <b>roughness</b> equal to the sea surface roughness means an elimination of frictional convergence and results in a diminishing coastal front structure of the precipitation pattern. The simulation with a high SST produces much precipitation above the sea, but less precipitation in the coastal area above land. A small increment of the SST results in larger precipitation amounts above the sea; above land increments are calculated for areas near the coast. A decrease of the SST shifts the precipitation maxima inland, although the precipitation amounts diminish. In the situation under study, frictional convergence is the key process that enhances the coastal front intensity. A thermal difference between land and sea equal to zero still yields the development of the coastal front. A lower SST than land surface temperature generates a reversed coastal front. This study emphasizes the importance of accurate prescription of surface conditions as input of the numerical weather prediction model to improve coastal front predictability...|$|R

The regional temperature response to surface roughness associated deforestation is very strong at northern mid-latitudes with a most prominent warming of 0. 72 °C around 50 °N in the Eurasia continent during summer.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{land use}} of the Great Lakes region has changed {{significantly}} during historical times, and continues to change. As a preliminary step in investigating the overall effect that this might have on climate, attention is focused here on one forcing factor and one effect—land surface roughness length and lake effect precipitation, respectively—that are anticipated to be particularly sensitive pieces of the land use-climate interaction. On both a monthly basis and in an individual case of lake effect precipita-tion, a reduction of <b>land</b> surface <b>roughness</b> reduces {{the total amount of}} lake effect precipitation. It also reduces {{the degree to which the}} precipitation is focused on the area closest to the lakeshore. The largest reductions occur immediately adjacent to the lakeshore in an area smaller than the overall lake effect zone. In the individual lake effect event that is investigated here, precipitation increases in some places farther inland when surface roughness is reduced. Because this increase in precipitation farther inland appears to be associated with significant topography, this result is most valid for lake effect zones where there is a high topographic relief, such as near southeastern Lake Erie (the main focus of this study), and to the south and east of Lake Ontario. This displacement in location of precipitation is particularly cru-cial where the boundary of the drainage basin is near the shoreline, and can indicate a flux of moisture out of the Great Lakes drainage basin and into another basin.

Subsequently, logistic regression is used to find the best fitting function to describe the relationship between the occurrence and absence of landslides within an individual grid cell. The results of seismic landslide hazard analysis that includes the topographic effect (AUROC = 0. 890) are better than those of the analysis without it (AUROC = 0. 874) ...|$|R

Using data from an offshore wind farm it is shown that at a distance of 1. 2 ? 1. 7 km from the coast, up to a height of 20 m above the surface, differences in wind speed distributions from onshore and offshore masts are statistically significant for flow moving offshore under all stability conditions. In contrast, differences between the distribution of wind speeds at 38 and 48 m at masts located at the coast and in the coastal zone are not significant for flow moving offshore, indicating that flow at these heights is not fully adjusted to the change in surface <b>roughness</b> (<b>land</b> to sea). These findings are in accordance with calculations of the internal boundary layer (IBL) height which indicate that the IBL would frequently be below the two upper measurement heights at 1. 2 ? 1. 6 km from the coast.

40|$|An {{in-depth}} {{understanding of}} {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) build-up on urban roads is essential for effective stormwater treatment design. Past research studies have pointed out the relationship between influential factors and PAHs build-up individually. However, these studies do not provide a comprehensive analysis of the relationships and the hierarchy of factors {{in terms of their}} importance in influencing PAHs build-up. This paper presents the outcomes of an in-depth investigation into the range of influential factors, including traffic volume, land use, distance to highway and roughness of road surfaces by ranking them in terms of their influence on PAHs build-up. A number of data analysis techniques including forward stepwise linear regression (FSWLR), principal component analysis (PCA) and multiple linear regression (MLR) were employed for the analyses undertaken. The outcomes confirmed that traffic volume is ranked first while <b>land</b> use and <b>roughness</b> of road surfaces are second and the third, respectively. Distance to highway did not show a significant influence on PAHs build-up. Additionally, it was noted that a high traffic volume tended to produce high loads of PAHs with more than 4 rings and the spatial variability of PAHs build-up were relatively higher in high traffic volume areas. These outcomes contributed to the formulation of a robust stormwater treatment strategy and generation of priority area maps focusing on the removal of PAHs...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{decision}} tree model for specifying {{the importance of}} 21 factors causing the landslides in a wide area of Penang Island, Malaysia. These factors are vegetation cover, distance from the fault line, slope angle, cross curvature, slope aspect, distance from road, geology, diagonal length, longitude curvature, rugosity, plan curvature, elevation, rain perception, soil texture, surface area, distance from drainage, <b>roughness,</b> <b>land</b> cover, general curvature, tangent curvature, and profile curvature. Decision tree models are used for prediction, classification, and factors importance and are usually represented by an easy to interpret tree like structure. Four models were created using Chi-square Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID), Exhaustive CHAID, Classification and Regression Tree (CRT), and Quick-Unbiased-Efficient Statistical Tree (QUEST). Twenty-one factors were extracted using digital elevation models (DEMs) and then used as input variables for the models. A data set of 137570 samples was selected for each variable in the analysis, where 68786 samples represent landslides and 68786 samples represent no landslides. 10 -fold cross-validation was employed for testing the models. The highest accuracy was achieved using Exhaustive CHAID (82. 0 %) compared to CHAID (81. 9 %), CRT (75. 6 %), and QUEST (74. 0 %) model. Across the four models, five factors were identified as most important factors which are slope angle, distance from drainage, surface area, slope aspect, and cross curvature...|$|R
40|$|Hydrologic {{similarities}} between catchments {{can be of}} use {{in the context of}} overland flood and mud flow hazards management. In Wallonia, upstream micro-catchments were mapped for each runoff concentration axis. The outlets of these catchments are considered at the point where water reaches the permanent river stream. No less than 145 547 micro catchments were mapped in Wallonia (16900 km²). Their area varies between 1 and 1233 ha (mean area: 7. 8 ha). A data base was built up to synthesize their major characteristics like e. g. area, shape and mean slope. No clear classification appeared. At this stage, it became obvious that the major components of these catchments had to be handled simultaneously from a hydrological point of view in order to produce a clear classification. The main hydrologic significant data are available in Wallonia: the digital soil map at 1 / 20 000 scale, the DTM (raster file of 10 meters resolution), digital land use at 1 / 10 000 scale and spatial statistics for rain (IDF curves for each commune). A hydrologic model was developed using the python programming language in the ArcGis 9. 3 environment. This model is based on the NRCS – USDA method. Rain abstraction is calculated {{on the basis of a}} CN (curve number) which integrates the soil type, the land use and the slope. Water transfer is computed using a convolution based on triangular unit hydrogrammes. This calculation includes the concentration time which integrates the catchment morphology (shape and slope) and the <b>land</b> use (<b>roughness).</b> The MUSLE equation is also computed in order to handle the sediment problem. The results consist in a full project hydrograph, peak flow value, flood water volume and sediment quantification in response to a project rainfall. The CN and MUSLE semi-empirical methods are validated at larger scale in Wallonia but have still to demonstrate their efficiency at the micro-catchment scale. Nevertheless, the aforementioned variables can be considered as integration factors of the whole hydrological context of the micro-catchments. It allows us to build advice on overland flow and mud flow mitigation at watershed scale. This approach can also be of help to compare ungauged micro-catchments between each other and possibly transpose the soil conservation practices from a site to another. Peer reviewe...|$|R
