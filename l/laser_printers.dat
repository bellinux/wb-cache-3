50|$|The <b>laser</b> <b>printer</b> {{was invented}} in 1969 by Xerox {{researcher}} Gary Starkweather by modifying a Xerox 7000 copier. Xerox management was afraid the product version of Starkweather's invention, which became the 9700, would negatively impact their copier business so the innovation sat in limbo until IBM launched the 3800 <b>laser</b> <b>printer</b> in 1976.|$|R

As a fabless semiconductor company, PMC-Sierra designs and tests products, but outsources wafer fabrication and assembly functions to third party suppliers.|$|E
25|$|When {{an outline}} font is used, a {{rasterizing}} routine (in the application software, operating system or printer) renders the character outlines, interpreting the vector instructions {{to decide which}} pixels should be black and which ones white. Rasterization is straightforward at high resolutions such as those used by <b>laser</b> <b>printers</b> and in high-end publishing systems. For computer screens, where each individual pixel {{can mean the difference}} between legible and illegible characters, some digital fonts use hinting algorithms to make readable bitmaps at small sizes.|$|E
25|$|Stepper motors {{were and}} still are often used in {{computer}} printers, optical scanners, and digital photocopiers to move the optical scanning element, the print head carriage (of dot matrix and inkjet printers), and the platen or feed rollers. Likewise, many computer plotters (which since the early 1990s have been replaced with large-format inkjet and <b>laser</b> <b>printers)</b> used rotary stepper motors for pen and platen movement; the typical alternatives here were either linear stepper motors or servomotors with closed-loop analog control systems.|$|E

25|$|The 68000 {{also saw}} great success as an {{embedded}} controller. As early as 1981, <b>laser</b> <b>printers</b> {{such as the}} Imagen Imprint-10 were controlled by external boards equipped with the 68000. The first HP LaserJet—introduced in 1984—came with a built-in 8MHz 68000. Other printer manufacturers adopted the 68000, including Apple with its introduction of the LaserWriter in 1985, the first PostScript laser printer. The 68000 continued to be widely used in printers {{throughout the rest of}} the 1980s, persisting well into the 1990s in low-end printers.|$|E
25|$|The first {{laser printer}} {{designed}} for use with an individual computer was released with the Xerox Star 8010 in 1981. Although it was innovative, the Star was an expensive ($17,000) system that was only purchased by {{a small number of}} laboratories and institutions. After personal computers became more widespread, the first laser printer intended for a mass market was the HP LaserJet 8ppm, released in 1984, using a Canon engine controlled by HP software. The HP LaserJet printer was quickly followed by other <b>laser</b> <b>printers</b> from Brother Industries, IBM, and others.|$|E
25|$|The 68k {{instruction}} set was particularly {{well suited to}} implement Unix, and the 68000 became the dominant CPU for Unix-based workstations including Sun workstations and Apollo/Domain workstations, and also was used for mass-market computers such as the Apple Lisa, Macintosh, Amiga, and Atari ST. The 68000 was used in Microsoft Xenix systems, {{as well as an}} early NetWare Unix-based Server. The 68000 was used in the first generation of desktop <b>laser</b> <b>printers,</b> including the original Apple Inc. LaserWriter and the HP LaserJet. In 1982, the 68000 received an update to its ISA allowing it to support virtual memory and to conform to the Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements. The updated chip was called the 68010. A further extended version, which exposed 31bits of the address bus, was also produced in small quantities as the 68012.|$|E
25|$|A <b>laser</b> <b>printer</b> is {{a common}} type of {{computer}} printer that rapidly produces high quality text and graphics on plain paper. The <b>laser</b> <b>printer</b> was invented at Xerox in 1969 by researcher Gary Starkweather, who had an improved printer working by 1971 and incorporated into a fully functional networked printer system by about a year later.|$|R

The HP LaserJet II was designed {{from the ground}} up as a <b>laser</b> <b>printer</b> with correct order page output as opposed to being leveraged from the Canon PC-20 personal copier. The HP LaserJet II used PCL4, improved features, more memory and fonts for a market price of $2,695.|$|R
25|$|HP Roman is {{a family}} of single byte {{character}} encodings supporting several Latin script based languages of Europe. It was originally introduced by Hewlett-Packard around 1978 as 7- and 8-bit HP Roman Extension for some of their computer terminals and printers. Early versions of the 8-bit variant were also used by some HP workstations in 1978/1979. Several revisions led to more characters being added before the 8-bit variant of the character set became officially known as HP Roman-8 in 1983. Soon later, this became the default character set of the HP-UX operating system and the page description language PCL for inkjet and <b>laser</b> <b>printers</b> in 1984. The character set was again expanded in 1985. A modified adaptation of the 1984 definition of Roman-8 {{was used in the}} HP Portable series of computers, whereas a derivation of the updated 1985 definition of Roman-8 was used in several early RPL calculators and corresponding thermal printers since 1986. The latest off-spring of the family is HP Roman-9, which was introduced in 1999 to include the euro sign.|$|E
