50|$|These {{equations}} are {{the basis}} of the standard big bang cosmological model including the current ΛCDM model. Because the FLRW model assumes homogeneity, some popular accounts mistakenly assert that the big bang model cannot account for the observed <b>lumpiness</b> of the universe. In a strictly FLRW model, there are no clusters of galaxies, stars or people, since these are objects much denser than a typical part of the universe. Nonetheless, the FLRW model is used as a first approximation for the evolution of the real, lumpy universe because it is simple to calculate, and models which calculate the <b>lumpiness</b> in the universe are added onto the FLRW models as extensions. Most cosmologists agree that the observable universe is well approximated by an almost FLRW model, i.e., a model which follows the FLRW metric apart from primordial density fluctuations. , the theoretical implications of the various extensions to the FLRW model appear to be well understood, and the goal is to make these consistent with observations from COBE and WMAP.|$|E

The engine in question {{had been the}} manufacturer's second all-new engine design since the war, although much of its underlying philosophy came from General Motors developments in Detroit and from experience with the new engine developed for the Kadett A earlier in the 1960s. Opel's so-called Camshaft in Head (CIH) engine followed the trends {{of the time in}} replacing side-valves with an overhead valvegear configuration, which was no doubt facilitated by the over-square architecture of the cylinder block: the engine also carried its camshaft directly above the cylinders. However, instead of operating directly on the cylinder valves, the camshaft still operated the valves using rods and rocker arms because, unusually (except within general Motors) the camshaft itself was positioned too low above the cylinders to permit direct action from the camshaft on the valves. One reason for this may have been cosmetic. Opel's Camshaft in Head (CIH) engine configuration enabled a succession of Opels to feature the low bonnet/hood lines that style-conscious product development departments favoured. As on the smaller Kadett engines with their side-mounted camshafts, the [...] "in head" [...] camshaft on the Opel CIH engine was chain driven, a weight-saving option which reduced <b>lumpiness</b> and friction at higher engine speeds when compared with the gear-cogs which had been used to drive camshafts in the previous generation of Opel engines.|$|E

This study analyses the behaviour of forecasting techniques when dealing with lumpy demand at the master production scheduling level. In particular, three forecasting techniques (exponentially weighted moving average, early sales and order overplanning) are considered. It is argued that demand <b>lumpiness</b> is a multidimensional phenomenon, generated by different market characteristics, namely, numerousness of customers, heterogeneity of customers, frequency of order placing, variety of each customer's request and correlation between customers behaviour.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{implications}} for the pattern of international trade of various differences among regions within countries [...] what we call llumpiness.

Thus <b>lumpiness</b> in the geographical distribution of factors can be a determinant of trade. Second, the regional distribution of factors is made endogenous by assuming instead that they are mobile, but that differences now exist among regions in the levels of amenities that either attract labor or assist production. We show that such differences in amenities can cause the endogenous distribution of factors to be sufficiently uneven so as to influence trade. Thus <b>lumpiness</b> of amenities can be a determinant of trade. Finally, we introduce nontraded goods, which turn out also to influence trade.

40|$|Part demand {{forecasting}} methods {{assume that}} the demand for a part over time follows a predictable pattern, and that the patterns observed in historical data provide a reliable indication of future demands. Generally, forecasting studies focus on topics such as: the span of time from which to sample the historical data, an assessment of data {{in order to find}} weekly or annual patterns, and the assignment of probabilities of different demand quantities in any given time period. Using the demand models derived from these forecasting methods, inventory decisions are made [...] decisions which directly impact operating cost and equipment availability. Like most general part demand forecasting methods, aircraft spare part demand forecasting considers historical trends in order to predict future demand. It is a well-known practical observation that aircraft spare part demands are often very erratic (quantity variability), intermittent (variable in timing), and otherwise unpredictable. However, contemporary science does not explain the causes of these variations, and suffers from very poor forecasting accuracy. The objective of this research is to study the likely causes of the variations in demand quantity and from that understanding to develop forecasting methods which are more appropriate for the wearout characteristics and high reliability of many aircraft parts. As a first look at the problem, models of part failure are developed. These models are used to simulate multiple simultaneous parts operating identically. The simulations found that aircraft spare parts demands tend to be lumpy, and that this <b>lumpiness</b> tends to consist of two parts: a random element (called noise), and a cyclic element (called signal). These simulation results are compared to existing aircraft spare parts demand data, and similar lumpy characteristics are identified. The research then more deeply understands these elements of spare part demand <b>lumpiness</b> by developing equations explaining this <b>lumpiness.</b> These equations find that the same factors (quantity of parts operating simultaneously and reliability of those parts) both impact the average demand interval and the demand coefficients of variance, and that they impact these demand characteristics so similarly that demand <b>lumpiness</b> should be expected. Having determined that <b>lumpiness</b> is to be expected, the research proceeds to find forecasting methods that best account for this <b>lumpiness.</b> It is theorized that no one forecasting method would best account for signal <b>lumpiness,</b> noise <b>lumpiness,</b> and smooth demands; thus, the study develops a heuristic to select the best forecasting method based upon key part characteristics (reliability and quantity). The forecasting heuristic development uses Monte Carlo simulations to find ranges of part characteristics for which certain forecasting methods and parameters are most likely to provide the lowest error forecasts. Developing this forecasting method selection heuristic uncovers additional new and unique information, as follows: - The best error in many cases is 100 % error, showing the need to move beyond forecasting for inventory management of many parts. - The forecasting error computation method used by the forecasting professional strongly influences the selection of the best forecasting method. - Certain elementary forecasting methods (e. g. naive or always zero) produce lower errors than any complex methods in some aircraft parts management conditions. - The selection of forecasting method parameters {{is as important as the}} selection of forecasting methods. This dissertation makes an important and unique contribution to the science of aircraft spare parts forecasting in creating a method to develop heuristics to select the lowest error forecasting methods. However, this dissertation makes a simultaneously important contribution in developing the inherent limits of forecasting [...] ...|$|E
