It sought an integrated view of children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> non-narrative <b>writing</b> <b>performance</b> by examining the following questions, in a natural classroom setting. 1. How, if at all, do students distinguish between different types of writing? By what criteria do they make their distinctions and why? 2. What preferences, if any, do students have for particular types of writing? Why do they have such preferences? 3. What do students believe affects their production of non-narrative writing in the classroom? 4. How do students go about non-narrative writing? What writing strategies do they apply? 5. What instructional strategies influence students 2 ̆ 7 non-narrative <b>writing</b> <b>performance</b> (process and product) ...|$|R
40|$|This output {{emerges from}} an ongoing, and long standing, {{research}} {{involvement with the}} field of <b>Performance</b> <b>Writing,</b> established at Dartington College of Arts in the early 1990 <b>s.</b> Briefly, <b>Performance</b> <b>Writing</b> considers an 'expanded' field of writing practice, taking-on writing both 'for', and 'as', performance. This essay applies aspects of his approach {{to the work of}} British Performance Group Lone Twin Theatre. The essay suggests that the way their work works is significantly determined by a very particular use of language that, in grammatical terms, relates to the reconstitution of modes of public address and vernacular discourse, in the context of texts for performance. To open up this idea to scrutiny and extrapolation, I use Bahktin's notion of 'speech genres', proposing that Lone Twin's <b>writing</b> for <b>performance</b> is often developed through the play (or performance) of grammatical construction.

40|$|The {{classrooms}} {{within our}} nation are becoming rich tapestries, interwoven {{with people of}} diverse cultures and ethnic groups. In response to the evolving tapestries, many educators advocate the need to heighten preservice teachers 2 ̆ 7 sensitivity to cultural issues {{so that they might}} apply this cultural knowledge within their teaching and learning. Using a reconstructionist approach, where preservice teachers become caring citizens who reach out to help culturally diverse children, is one way to address these issues. This manuscript describes an alternative tutoring program, where meaningful teaching and learning emerges within an urban community, and its 2 ̆ 7 evaluation process. As a result of participating in this experience, preservice teachers learn to understand the social context within which literacy can occur. The evaluation process reveals, through the use of observations, questionnaires, interviews, and writing samples, the impact of this experience on preservice teachers 2 ̆ 7 teaching and learning, as well as young children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> reading and <b>writing</b> <b>performance...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationships between transcription, high-level writing processes, and <b>writing</b> <b>performance</b> in Grades 7 – 8 (N = 196).

Results showed that the proposed model fitted the data extremely well, explaining 46 % of the variability in <b>writing</b> <b>performance.</b> We found that higher handwriting fluency was associated with better planning skills, higher spelling accuracy was associated with better translating skills, and better planning and translating skills were associated with greater <b>writing</b> <b>performance.</b> We found indirect effects of handwriting fluency and spelling accuracy on <b>writing</b> <b>performance,</b> respectively, via planning and translating.

40|$|Renewed {{calls for}} {{identifying}} other variables and validating previous models {{that account for}} the complex interplay of mechanisms that are activated {{in the writing process}} have been made. In response to this call, the study investigates whether text production processes (idea generation, idea encoding, idea/text revision, and idea transcription) mediate the effect of topic knowledge, linguistic knowledge, writing approach, and writing experience on <b>writing</b> <b>performance.</b> Writer’s performance was measured by timed essays, while the psycholinguistic and linguistic variables were measured by scales and tests. Results yielded by Structural Equations Modeling indicate that topic knowledge and linguistic knowledge have direct effects on <b>writing</b> <b>performance</b> and indirect effects on <b>writing</b> <b>performance</b> through text production process. Writing approach and writing experience do not directly affect <b>writing</b> <b>performance,</b> but they indirectly affect <b>writing</b> <b>performance</b> through text production processes...|$|R

40|$|Writing {{has been}} called the "neglected `R'" in the {{traditional}} trilogy of reading, `riting, and `rithmetic (National Commission on <b>Writing,</b> 2003). <b>Writing</b> <b>performance</b> continues to languish, despite societal expectations that students should be able to write clearly and precisely. Sociocognitive theory predicts that writing beliefs are related to <b>writing</b> <b>performance.</b> Much research has focused on writing self-efficacy beliefs and their link to writing apprehension and <b>writing</b> <b>performance,</b> while research exploring another type of belief, domain-specific beliefs about writing itself, is sparse. This study examined the relations between these beliefs about writing, writing self-efficacy, and writing apprehension, and their links to <b>writing</b> <b>performance.</b> 	This research was a three-phase study. Phases I and II involved instrument construction and validation, while Phase III examined the relations among the research variables. Two hundred eighty-seven Hispanic women students completed a test battery in class measuring demographics, beliefs about writing, writing self-efficacy, and <b>writing</b> apprehension. <b>Writing</b> <b>performance</b> was measured separately on an authentic writing task, a take-home paper, by both an overall grade and six component grades. Inter-rater agreements on these grades ranged from r =. 83 to. 91. 	Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that beliefs about writing independently predicted <b>writing</b> <b>performance</b> and that some beliefs about writing (e. g., Good writers adapt their message to their readers) are adaptive and associated with strong <b>writing</b> <b>performance,</b> while other beliefs about writing (e. g., Readers are impressed by big words) are maladaptive and relate to weak <b>writing</b> <b>performance.</b> In addition, apprehension about making grammatical and other mechanical errors had a stronger negative effect on <b>writing</b> <b>performance</b> than the more traditional concept of writing apprehension, which concerns sharing one's writing with others and having it critiqued. After controlling for domain-specific beliefs, writing self-efficacy weakly predicted <b>writing</b> <b>performance</b> as well. 	These results support the need for future research examining the relations among the research variables and <b>writing</b> <b>performance</b> in samples that are more balanced with respect to gender and ethnicity, and with other writing tasks. Because beliefs about writing demonstrated the largest beta weights in the regression equations, these beliefs may have the most promise for promoting both writing research and practice...|$|R

In keeping with this trend, this study compared the effect of conventional tools as pen-and-paper, and e-mail, on the <b>writing</b> <b>performance</b> in terms of content, organization, language use, vocabulary and mechanics. Forty two English major students from one intact class at Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM), based on their grades in “Expository Writing”, as a subject taken in the previous semester, were randomly assigned into two groups, namely: pen-and-paper dialogue journal and e-mail dialogue journal. Pre and post writing tests were administered to identify two groups’ differences in their <b>writing</b> <b>performance</b> scores.

30|$|Although {{performance}} is often considered an isolated quality attribute, read and <b>write</b> <b>performance</b> can be different. This difference {{is reflected in}} our table, and {{it is interesting to}} analyse the performance quality attribute as a whole with the data presented in the table. Most NoSQL databases polarize on performance characteristics, either having high ratings on read or <b>write</b> <b>performance</b> (Cassandra, Couchbase, HBase and MongoDB), but there are some exceptions. Aerospike provides a balance between <b>write</b> and read <b>performance</b> without reaching the “Great” rating in either of these quality attributes. On the other hand, Voldemort provides high <b>write</b> <b>performance</b> (“Great”) and good read performance (“Good”), while Couchbase offers good <b>write</b> <b>performance</b> (“Good”), but high read performance (“Great”). This implies that software engineers can look to Voldemort, Couchbase and Aerospike as “balanced” systems in terms of performance, with Voldemort and Couchbase tending slightly towards more specific write or read scenarios, respectively.|$|R
