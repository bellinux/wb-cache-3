500|$|In 1847 Felix Mendelssohn {{attended}} a London performance of Robert – an opera which musically he despised – {{in order to}} hear Jenny Lind's British debut, {{in the role of}} Alice. The music critic Henry Chorley, who was with him, wrote [...] "I see as I write the smile with which Mendelssohn, whose enjoyment of Mdlle. Lind's talent was unlimited, turned round and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> if a load of anxiety had been taken off his mind." ...|$|E
500|$|At Fairbanks, {{the three}} B-29s {{encountered}} significant headwinds; {{more than the}} [...] "slight" [...] headwinds observed up to this time. They had expected tailwinds from the jet stream, yet could complete the distance without them, but headwinds meant that Washington might be too far. At 7am Eastern War Time, aircraft Number 2 was over Northway, Alaska, and navigator Bill Townes determined that they were behind schedule. He said later, [...] "When I reported that fact to General LeMay, he <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> if {{he thought it was}} my fault, so I retreated behind my bulkhead to check my figures." [...] Later, the airmen learned that the typhoon near Okinawa the week before had greatly affected the jet stream.|$|E
500|$|Not knowing at {{the time}} that he would be {{referring}} to deleted scenes, Andrew Lincoln told Entertainment Weekly, [...] "I remember going on set for the season premiere and seeing a couple of the prop guys, and they just <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> they gave me my gun and they went, 'You know, in this episode we kill more zombies than in the whole of Season 1.' They actually counted the kills! And when it came time for the taking-of-the-courtyard scene, that was just carnage." [...] He added, [...] "It really wasn't that well plotted. We just got sent zombies towards us and we had to improvise stabbing, so it was a bit touch-and-go from time to time." ...|$|E

60|$|They {{all stood}} <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> if they {{was waiting for}} something. I folded my arms--tight--and stared back at 'em.|$|R

500|$|Mendelssohn met {{and worked}} with Lind many times, and started an opera, Lorelei, for her, based on {{the legend of the}} Lorelei Rhine maidens; the opera was {{unfinished}} at his death. He is said to have tailored the aria [...] "Hear Ye Israel" [...] in his oratorio Elijah to Lind's voice, although she did not sing this part until after his death, at a concert in December 1848. In 1847 Mendelssohn attended a London performance of Meyerbeer's Robert le diable– an opera which musically he despised– in order to hear Lind's British debut, in the role of Alice. The music critic Henry Chorley, who was with him, wrote [...] "I see as I write the smile with which Mendelssohn, whose enjoyment of Mdlle. Lind's talent was unlimited, turned round and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> if a load of anxiety had been taken off his mind. His attachment to Mlle. Lind's genius as a singer was unbounded, as was his desire for her success".|$|E
2500|$|Mendelssohn {{was present}} at Lind's London debut in Robert le Diable, and his friend, the critic H. F. Chorley, who was with him, wrote [...] "I see as I write the smile with which Mendelssohn, whose {{enjoyment}} of Mdlle. Lind's talent was unlimited, turned round and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> if a load of anxiety had been taken off his mind. His attachment to Mademoiselle Lind's genius as a singer was unbounded, as was his desire for her success". Mendelssohn worked with Lind on many occasions and wrote the beginnings of an opera, Lorelei, for her, based on {{the legend of the}} Lorelei Rhine maidens; the opera was unfinished at his death. He included a high F sharp in his oratorio Elijah ("Hear Ye Israel") with Lind's voice in mind.|$|E
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> though {{wondering}} how far I were in earnest.|$|E
60|$|As soon as Col. Positive {{had read}} this much, {{he stopped to}} take breath, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> if expecting some exclamations of admiration and delight.|$|R
50|$|Foley {{is known}} for {{claiming}} a scientific approach to the golf swing. One of his trainees, Justin Rose, said of Foley's instruction style:Sean does not <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> a golfer. He <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> an athlete and from a biomechanical point of view. He is not necessarily wrapped up in what makes a swing pretty. He wants what works for me from a scientific point of view. This {{is not necessarily the}} position that everyone strives for, but that is what I like about Sean.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-morning, Mr. Ducaine," [...] she said. [...] "You {{need not}} <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> though I were a ghost. I always walk before {{breakfast in the}} country." ...|$|R
60|$|Traddles <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> if he {{wondered}} what I was talking about.|$|E
60|$|He <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> {{though in}} reproach at the levity of my question.|$|E
60|$|My mother <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> if {{she doubted}} the {{evidence}} of her own senses.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, come, Felix!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Don't <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> though I were a ghost. You {{have very}} little {{confidence}} in me, after all, I see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am Hardross Courage," [...] I answered. [...] "Please do not <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> though I were {{something}} uncanny. The report of my {{death was a}} little premature!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd buy {{her with}} all the rest,--a girl that wouldn't <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> I am,--would take me for all the rest, you know,--that's {{the way of the}} world." ...|$|R
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> {{though in}} surprise. Her eyes {{were like the}} eyes of a child.|$|E
60|$|She {{lifted her}} {{face from the}} floor, and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> if she doubted whether she had heard aright.|$|E
60|$|I saw {{her thin}} lips working while she <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> {{if they were}} eager to load her with reproaches.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not sadly, if {{you knew}} my heart. Do not <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> if you thought me sorrowful. There is not a happier {{creature}} on earth, than I am now.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I’ve {{been here}} sixteen years,” her friend went on, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> for some charming intelligence. “It {{used to be}} for my education. I don’t know what it’s for now.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{more than}} half believe he speaks the truth. Upon my word I do,' said Varden. 'Do you see how he <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> if he knew what I was saying?' ...|$|R
60|$|Jack {{paused and}} <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> <b>As</b> he paused, I felt my old self revive again more {{completely}} than ever with a rush.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Greene's eyes, {{when she}} had done being hysterical, were terrible, and Sophonisba <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> though I were a convicted thief.|$|E
60|$|The {{coloured}} chappie {{in charge}} of the lift <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> I hopped in, with a good deal of quiet devotion and what not.|$|E
6000|$|... "Papa is so stern with me. Of {{course he}} has given way, and of course I am grateful. But he <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> though I had done {{something}} to be forgiven." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'A {{can hold}} his tongue very clever--very clever truly," [...] echoed Leaf. [...] "'A do <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> if 'a {{could see my}} {{thoughts}} running round like the works of a clock." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She won't talk so pleasantly when I get there," [...] Seth said to himself. [...] "I'd rather take a sound {{flogging}} {{than have}} her <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> if I was a thief!" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{had a way}} {{of looking}} one in the eyes and {{demanding}} the truth, and thus she <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> she asked the question.|$|E
60|$|There was an instant's silence. I {{looked at}} Delora and {{wondered}} what he meant. He <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> a man looks at his enemy.|$|E
6000|$|The Ape-man <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> {{though he}} {{expected}} something. I perceived the pause was interrogative. [...] "He comes {{to live with}} you," [...] I said.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Angry,' I answered, with an {{involuntary}} imitation of his dark frown. 'If {{he was only}} sorry, he wouldn't <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> he does. I am only sorry, {{and it makes me}} feel kinder.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{believe that}} she hates <b>me</b> too. She <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> though I were {{something}} unpleasant, as though she wished me dead. I will not go to her, Arnold. Say that I shall not." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Victor," [...] he cried, [...] "don't <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> {{though you}} wanted to punch my head. Down on your knees, man, and pray {{for a sense of}} humour. It's the very salt of life." ...|$|R
