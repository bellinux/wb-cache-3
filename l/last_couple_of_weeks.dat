5|$|González-Gordon {{has been}} {{described}} as being proud of his Scottish heritage, which centred on the town of Huntly and the Clan Gordon. His personal clothing style reflected this; he was noted for his tweed jackets and British clothes in general. He had been married to Milagro López de Carrizosa y Eizaguirre for 62 years before she died in July 2013. The couple had two children, Bibiana and Mauricio, with Mauricio being the current president of the family company. During the three final years of his life González-Gordon was in poor health and could hardly leave his home. He died on 27 September 2013 in his hometown of Jerez de la Frontera at the age of 89. His family claims that the last thing he drank was a Tío Pepe, the most famous brand of the family business. His death occurred at the Asisa clinic where he had spent his <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks.</b> The memorial service was held at the San Juan Bautista de La Salle church on 28 September.|$|E

Bischoff also invited Steve Austin to make an appearance at next month's No Way Out. The following week, Bischoff stated that Austin has agreed to tell his story in the Raw magazine. On the February 3 episode of Raw, Bischoff headed to Texas, to sign Austin to the Raw brand. But, he was unsuccessful in doing so, as he couldn't locate Austin anywhere. The following week on Raw, Bischoff (kayfabe) fired Jim Ross, after Bischoff stated that it was Ross' fault that Austin hasn't signed yet to the brand. Vince McMahon, who the previous week stated he would fire Bischoff and Chief Morley for the way they were running Raw the <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks,</b> asked Bischoff if he'd signed Austin yet, which prompted Bischoff to say No. J.R. informed McMahon that Austin would be at No Way Out, which led to McMahon booking a match between Bischoff and Austin for the pay-per-view.|$|E
25|$|After 14 {{golden years}} at Werder Bremen, Rehhagel left to manage former hated rivals, Bayern Munich, {{before the start}} of the 1995–96 season. Prior to Rehhagel's arrival, Bayern had a disappointing, but financially lucrative season in 1994–95 (a very poor sixth place in the Bundesliga, but semi-finals in the Champions League). In the summer of 1995, Bayern spent a lot of money, buying Jürgen Klinsmann, Andreas Herzog, and others, and Rehhagel was brought in as manager to replace Giovanni Trapattoni. It was widely {{expected}} that Munich would steamroll the opposition in 1995–96, but from Day 1, Rehhagel clashed with the team and the team environment. His single-minded and occasionally eccentric ways did not mesh at all with Bayern, who quickly felt that Rehhagel was too rural at heart and had no clue about how to interact in the fancy environment of Munich. Moreover, Rehhagel's old-school tactics and patronising of the Bayern players caused major antipathy in the Bayern team, especially from Klinsmann, who never missed an opportunity to take shots at Rehhagel. Despite Rehhagel getting Bayern to the UEFA Cup final, Bayern's results in the Bundesliga dropped alarmingly in the second half of the season, and Rehhagel was famously sacked just 4 days before they were due to play in the first leg of the 1996 UEFA Cup final. Rehhagel's job was taken over by Franz Beckenbauer, who led the team to victory in the 1996 UEFA Cup final, and oversaw an upturn in form in the <b>last</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks</b> in the Bundesliga, but Bayern finished second, as Borussia Dortmund won their second German championship in a row.|$|E

40|$|A major phenological {{event in}} the life of annual {{bluegrass}} is the production of seedheads. The emergence of seedheads in Michigan occurs sometime between the end of April and the middle of May, with seedhead production continuing through late June. Although profuse seedhead production may only <b>last</b> a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks,</b> disruption <b>of</b> the esthetic and playing qualities of the turf occur. Another detrimental effect of seedhead production is the energy imbalance that occurs in the plant. During seedhead production energy in the form of carbohydrates is spent in seedhead formation with little used for root production. The result is little or no root growth with the possibility of actual root reduction, under the right conditions. Knowing when seedheads emerge would allow for better timing of cultural practices and applications of seedhead suppressive compounds. Temperature greatly affects the rate of most biological processes. Growth and development of not only turfgrass but most agricultural plants show a temperature response.
