40|$|A proteomic {{analysis}} of the apoplastic fluid (APF) of coffee leaves was conducted to investigate the cellular processes associated with incompatible (resistant) and compatible (susceptible) Coffea arabica-Hemileia vastatrix interactions, during the 24 - 96 hai period. The APF proteins were extracted by <b>leaf</b> <b>vacuum</b> infiltration and protein profiles were obtained by 2 -DE. The comparative {{analysis of}} the gels revealed 210 polypeptide spots whose volume changed in abundance between samples (control, resistant and susceptible) during the 24 - 96 hai period. The proteins identified were involved mainly in protein degradation, cell wall metabolism and stress/defense responses, most of them being hydrolases (around 70 %), particularly sugar hydrolases and peptidases/proteases. The changes in the APF proteome along the infection process revealed two distinct phases of defense responses, an initial/basal one (24 - 48 hai) and a late/specific one (72 - 96 hai). Compared to susceptibility, resistance {{was associated with a}} higher number of proteins, which was more evident in the late/specific phase. Proteins involved in the resistance response were mainly, glycohydrolases of the cell wall, serine proteases and pathogen related-like proteins (PR-proteins), suggesting that some of these proteins could be putative candidates for resistant markers of coffee to H. vastatrix. Antibodies were produced against chitinase, pectin methylesterase, serine carboxypeptidase, reticuline oxidase and subtilase and by an immunodetection assay it was observed an increase of these proteins in the resistant sample. With this methodology we have identified proteins that are candidate markers of resistance and that will be useful in coffee breeding programs to assist in the selection of cultivars with resistance to H. vastatrix...|$|E
30|$|Histochemical {{staining}} {{was performed}} on fresh leaves as previously described (Qiao et al., 2009) with modifications. In brief, fresh <b>leaf</b> examples were <b>vacuum</b> infiltrated in 0.5 [*]mg[*]ml−[*] 1 nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) or 1 [*]mg[*]ml−[*] 1 3, 3 ′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) for 10 [*]min, and then left {{at room temperature for}} 12 [*]h in the dark. After staining, the chlorophyll was extracted by soaking the samples in 90 % ethanol for 3 [*]h at 42 [*]°C or until the green pigment was completely removed. H 2 O 2 and O 2 − levels in the flag leaves two days after flowering were quantified according to Yang et al. (Yang et al., 2016).|$|R
40|$|The {{activity}} of 1 -aminocyclopropane carboxylate (ACC) synthase increased rapidly in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) <b>leaf</b> discs after <b>vacuum</b> infiltration, reached a maximum after about 30 minutes, and subsequently decayed with an apparent half-life of about 20 minutes. Aminoethoxyvinylglycine, a known inhibitor of ACC synthase, did {{not alter the}} apparent turnover of ACC synthase in vivo although it efficiently blocked inactivation of the enzyme by its substrate S-adenosylmethionine in vitro. Similar results were obtained, using a novel assay with permeabilized cells, for ACC synthase in tomato cell cultures treated with a fungal elicitor. The results indicate that inactivation of ACC synthase in vivo differs from substrate-dependent inactivation in vitro...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{impact of}} xylem {{cavitation}} and embolism on leaf (Kleaf) and stem (Kstem) hydraulic conductance {{was measured in}} current-year shoots of Cercis siliquastrum L. (Judas tree) using the vacuum chamber technique. Kstem decreased at leaf water potentials (YL) lower than 1. 0 MPa, while Kleaf started to decrease only at YL < 1. 5 MPa. <b>Leaf</b> infiltration under <b>vacuum</b> with Phloxine B revealed that minor veins underwent extensive embo-lism and became non-functional at YL < 1. 5 MPa, thus indicating that leaf vein embolism was closely related to Kleaf changes. Field measurements of leaf conductance to water vapour (gL) and YL showed that stomata closed when YL decreased below the YL threshold inducing loss of hydraulic conductance in the leaf. The partitioning of hydraulic resistances within shoots and leaves was measured using the high-pressure flow meter method. The ratio of leaf to shoot hydraulic resistance was about 0. 8, suggesting that stem cavitation had a limited impact on whole shoot hydraulic conductance. We suggest that stomatal aperture may be regulated by the cavitation-induced reduction of hydraulic conductance of the soil-to-leaf water pathway which, in turn, strongly depends on the hydraulic architecture of the plant and, in particular, on leaf hydraulics...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background For {{efficient}} and large scale production of recombinant proteins in plants transient expression by agroinfection {{has a number}} of advantages over stable transformation. Simple manipulation, rapid analysis and high expression efficiency are possible. In pea, Pisum sativum, a Virus Induced Gene Silencing System using the pea early browning virus has been converted into an efficient agroinfection system by converting the two RNA genomes of the virus into binary expression vectors for Agrobacterium transformation. Results By vacuum infiltration (0. 08 Mpa, 1 min) of germinating pea seeds with 2 - 3 cm roots with Agrobacteria carrying the binary vectors, expression of the gene for Green Fluorescent Protein as marker and the gene for the human acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) was obtained in 80 % of the infiltrated developing seedlings. Maximal production of the recombinant proteins was achieved 12 - 15 days after infiltration. Conclusions Compared to the <b>leaf</b> injection method <b>vacuum</b> infiltration of germinated seeds is highly efficient allowing large scale production of plants transiently expressing recombinant proteins. The production cycle of plants for harvesting the recombinant protein was shortened from 30 days for leaf injection to 15 days by applying vacuum infiltration. The synthesized aFGF was purified by heparin-affinity chromatography and its mitogenic activity on NIH 3 T 3 cells confirmed to be similar to a commercial product. </p...|$|R
