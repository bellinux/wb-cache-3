60|$|It {{is proper}} {{in this place}} to mention a short philosophic piece which Diderot wrote in 1751, his <b>Letter</b> <b>on</b> the Deaf and Dumb for the Use of those who Hear and Talk. This is not, like the <b>Letter</b> <b>on</b> the Blind, the {{examination}} of {{a case of the}} Intellect deprived of {{one or more of the}} senses. It is substantially a fragment, and a very important fragment, on Æsthetics, and as such there will be something to say about it in another chapter. But there are, perhaps, one or two points at which the <b>Letter</b> <b>on</b> the Deaf and Dumb touches the line of thought of the <b>Letter</b> <b>on</b> the Blind.|$|R

5|$|In February 1920, a Notice to Airmen {{was issued}} advising pilots {{that had made}} {{emergency}} landings at Penshurst that they could use the War Office telephone to inform the police of their arrival and to obtain conveyances for their passengers {{to take them to}} Penshurst station. On 5 June 1920, the first air mail flight between the Netherlands and the United Kingdom was made. Bert Hinchcliffe departed from Schiphol in a hired Airco DH.9 with 300 <b>letters</b> <b>on</b> board. Despite the bad weather, Hinchcliffe decided not to land at Lympne and pressed on towards Croydon. He was eventually forced to land at Penshurst due to a combination of the weather and running low on fuel. A taxi was hired to take Hinchcliffe and the <b>letters</b> <b>on</b> to London. A linen windsock was installed at Penshurst in November 1920. The War Office telephone was notified as having been discontinued in January 1921. On 24 September 1921, a de Havilland DH.18 aircraft diverted to Penshurst as Croydon was fogbound.|$|E

5|$|Another {{important}} {{source of information about}} Egypt during the reign of Djedkare Isesi is the Abusir papyri. These are administrative documents, covering a period of 24 years during Djedkare's reign; they were discovered in the mortuary temples of pharaohs Neferirkare Kakai, Neferefre and queen Khentkaus II. In addition to these texts, the earliest <b>letters</b> <b>on</b> papyrus preserved to the present day also date to Djedkare's reign, dealing with administrative or private matters.|$|E
5|$|Arcadelt {{remained}} in Rome {{as a singer}} and composer at the Sistine Chapel until 1551, except for one leave of absence to visit France in 1547. During this period, probably in early 1542, he made the acquaintance of Michelangelo, but his madrigalian settings {{of two of the}} artist's sonnets were received with indifference; indeed, from Michelangelo's <b>letters</b> <b>on</b> the topic, he probably considered himself unmusical and incapable of appreciating Arcadelt's work. Michelangelo paid Arcadelt with a piece of satin suitable for making into a doublet.|$|E

5|$|During {{the tour}} an {{anonymous}} person named Publius posted {{a message on}} an internet newsgroup, inviting fans to solve a riddle supposedly concealed in the new album. The veracity of the message was demonstrated when white lights {{in front of the}} stage at a performance in East Rutherford spelled out the words Enigma Publius. During a televised concert at Earls Court in October 1994, the word enigma was projected in large <b>letters</b> <b>on</b> to the backdrop of the stage. Mason later acknowledged that the Publius Enigma did exist, and that it had been instigated by the record company rather than the band. As of 2014 the puzzle remains unsolved.|$|E
5|$|PahWongso {{continued}} operating {{his school}} and employment office, {{under the auspices}} of the PahWongso Foundation, into the 1970s. He touted that the foundation had found positions for 1,000 young women and 11,000 young men, and advertisements offering to place labourers were issued in Indonesian, English, and Dutch. The institution also provided printing services; wrote <b>letters</b> <b>on</b> demand in English, Dutch, and Indonesian; and provided wayang performances with four kinds of puppets. PahWongso died in Jakarta on 13 May 1975.|$|E
5|$|Potter's tale pays {{homage to}} the leisurely summers her father and his companions passed sport fishing at rented country estates in Scotland.

After Potter's death in 1943, licences were issued to various firms to produce the Potter characters. Jeremy and his friends were released as porcelain figurines, plush toys, and other merchandise.|$|E

5|$|The Duchess of Lorraine's {{love for}} her husband was strong and possessive. The letters she sent to him shortly before their {{marriage}} expressed her eagerness to see him; his <b>letters,</b> <b>on</b> the other hand, were stereotyped and formal. She was very jealous {{of her husband and}} his infidelity was the greatest problem of their marriage, with Maria Wilhelmina, Princess of Auersperg, as his best-known mistress.|$|E
5|$|About January 1843, on {{the orders}} of the acting Settlement Engineer, Captain D.H. Stevenson, the slab was blown to pieces to clear and widen the {{passageway}} at the Singapore River mouth to make space for Fort Fullerton and the quarters of its commander. Some sources claim that the Superintendent of Public Works, George Drumgoole Coleman, {{was responsible for the}} Stone's destruction, but he was on leave and not in Singapore {{at the time of its}} blasting. Lieutenant-Colonel James Low had petitioned to have the sandstone slab spared, but had been told that it was in the way of a projected bungalow. On the explosion taking place, he crossed the river from his office and selected fragments that had <b>letters</b> <b>on</b> them. As the fragments were very bulky, he had them chiselled into small slabs by a Chinese man. He selected some of the smaller fragments bearing the most legible parts of the inscription and sent them to the Royal Asiatic Society's museum in Calcutta (now known as the Indian Museum) for analysis, where they arrived in about June 1848.|$|E
5|$|For {{some time}} afterwards, his main {{literary}} output was his voluminous correspondence with his disciples. His letters, {{most of which}} were written in the 1930s, numbered in the several thousands. Many were brief comments made in the margins of his disciple's notebooks in answer to their questions and reports of their spiritual practice—others extended to several pages of carefully composed explanations of practical aspects of his teachings. These were later collected and published in book form in three volumes of <b>Letters</b> <b>on</b> Yoga. In the late 1930s, he resumed work on a poem he had started earlier—he continued to expand and revise this poem {{for the rest of his}} life. It became perhaps his greatest literary achievement, Savitri, an epic spiritual poem in blank verse of approximately 24,000 lines.|$|E

5|$|Irish {{merchant}} shipping {{saw to it}} that vital imports continued to arrive and exports, mainly food supplies to Great Britain, were delivered. Irish ships sailed unarmed and usually alone, identifying themselves as neutrals with bright lights and by painting the Irish tricolour and EIRE in large <b>letters</b> <b>on</b> their sides and decks. Nonetheless twenty percent of seamen serving in Irish ships perished, victims of a war not their own: attacked by both sides, though predominantly by the Axis powers. Often, Allied convoys could not stop to pick up survivors, while Irish ships always answered SOS signals and stopped to rescue survivors, irrespective of which side they belonged to. Irish ships rescued 534 seamen.|$|E
5|$|It {{stands on}} a granite {{pedestal}} also designed by Marochetti and made by Freeman & Co. of Penryn, Cornwall. Bas-relief panels showing Crusaders fighting the Saracens at the Battle of Ascalon and Richard on his deathbed pardoning Bertran de Born, the archer who fatally shot him in 1199, {{were added to the}} east and west sides of the pedestal in 1866–67. As the statue cannot be accessed by the general public – the area around it is used as the House of Lords car park – the west-side scene showing Richard and Bertran is the only one visible from the street. According to Marochetti, the two bas-reliefs were designed in the style of Lorenzo Ghiberti's doors at the Florence Baptistry. Bronze <b>letters</b> <b>on</b> the front of the pedestal bear the inscription RICHARD I CŒUR DE LION / 1189–1199.|$|E
5|$|On 20 February, Kroonland, {{continuing}} to sail for the American Line, returned to New York – Liverpool service after {{an absence of}} 18 months. As a ship of the still-neutral United States sailing in a war zone, Kroonland had her name painted in large <b>letters</b> <b>on</b> each side of her hull. The name was flanked on either side by large American flags and kept illuminated at night. In June, she carried US$1,500,000 of Argentine gold from London for deposit with the Guaranty Trust Company of New York. On late 1916, a cook aboard Kroonland was arrested for smuggling feathers, wings, and heads of birds of paradise and crowned pigeons. The man, who was paid $300 for each load of feathers, smuggled {{in at least three}} loads of the avian contraband before his arrest. In January 1917, a jumble sale held in the saloon on Kroonland raised £73 15s 11d for The Times Fund, {{for the benefit of the}} British Red Cross and the Order of St. John.|$|E
