30|$|The central Philippine Fault Zone {{is found}} to be the locus of great earthquakes, a {{transition}} zone with slow slip and creep activity. This is based on the analysis and correlation of seismic historic data and detailed documentation of recent seismic events in the region. Based on this study the Guinyangan fault is defined to be the northern <b>locked</b> <b>portion</b> with recurrence interval of as short as 65 years. The Masbate fault is the central part with large and medium earthquakes accompanied by unusually large ground rupture.

Unusual seismic activity both on the Masbate fault and Central Leyte fault somehow correlates well with the behavior of known slow events and creep activity. Further investigation of this region could lead to deeper understanding of impending major earthquakes, especially along the Guinyangan fault, which usually produces larger damaging events, and for further understanding of the impact of slow events and creep on the adjoining active structures.|$|R

Comparison of macroseismic data related to the Gorkha earthquake with data from previous events indicates that the rupture remained limited to an area roughly similar to the area shaken by the 1833 AD earthquake (Martin et al., 2015) and ended eastward in the area that was already broken during the 1934 AD earthquake (Adhikari et al., 2015).|$|R
40|$|AbstractMscL, {{the highly}} conserved {{bacterial}} mechanosensitive channel of large conductance, {{is one of}} the best studied mechanosensors. It is a homopentameric channel that serves as a biological emergency release valve that prevents cell lysis from acute osmotic stress. We previously showed that the periplasmic region of the protein, particularly a single residue located at the TM 1 /periplasmic loop interface, F 47 of Staphylococcus aureus and I 49 of Escherichia coli MscL, plays a major role in both the open dwell time and mechanosensitivity of the channel. Here, we introduced cysteine mutations at these sites and found they formed disulfide bridges that decreased the channel open dwell time. By scanning a likely interacting domain, we also found that these sites could be disulfide trapped by addition of cysteine mutations in other locations within the periplasmic loop of MscL, and this also led to rapid channel kinetics. Together, the data suggest structural rearrangements and protein-protein interactions that occur within this region upon normal gating, and further suggest that <b>locking</b> <b>portions</b> of the channel into a transition state decreases the stability of the open state...|$|R

For example, during the 2015 M 7. 8 Gorkha earthquake, Nepal, a slip pulse propagating along strike unzipped the bottom edge of the <b>locked</b> <b>portion</b> of the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT). The lower edge of the rupture produced dominant high-frequency (> 1 Hz) radiation of seismic waves. We show that similar partial ruptures occur spontaneously in a simple dynamic model of earthquake sequences. The fault is governed by standard laboratory-based rate-and-state friction with the ageing law and contains one homogenous velocity-weakening (VW) region embedded in a velocity-strengthening (VS) area. Our simulations incorporate inertial wave-mediated effects during seismic ruptures (they are thus fully dynamic) and account for all phases of the seismic cycle in a self-consistent way. Earthquakes nucleate {{at the edge of}} the VW area and partial ruptures tend to stay confined within this zone of higher prestress, producing pulse-like ruptures that propagate along strike.

Significant shortening and left‐lateral slip occurs across the Longitudinal Valley fault there, both as shallow fault creep and as seismogenic fault slip. The southernmost Longitudinal Valley fault comprises an eastern Peinan strand and a western Luyeh strand. We derive an interseismic block model for these two strands using data from a small‐aperture Global Positioning System (GPS) campaign and leveling. The model provides estimates of fault slip rates and quantifies slip partitioning between the two strands. A 45 [*][*]mm/yr dip‐slip rate on the northern Peinan strand diminishes southward, whereas the left‐lateral component increases.

40|$|Abstract: GPS {{observations}} in Costa Rica from 1994 - 1997 reveal a complex pattern of motion {{consistent with the}} superposition of seismic cycle and secular plate margin deformation. In the south, velocity vectors are consistent with motion of the Panama Block plus postseismic deformation following the 1991 Limon earthquake, and interseismic strain due to partial locking of the Middle America Trench (MAT) thrust. In the northwest, sites west of the volcanic arc are moving to the NW as a forearc sliver. Superimposed on this sliver motion are vertical and horizontal interseismic deformations from the adjacent Nicoya segment of the MAT. We apply two different inverse methods to understand {{the source of the}} seismic strain in NW Costa Rica. We compare fault locking models derived using a singular value decomposition inversion with of that a simulated annealing global optimization approach. Both methods yield similar models for partial locking of the thrust interface beneath the Nicoya Peninsula. Our results define an area of nearly fully locked fault beneath the outer coast of the southern portion of the peninsula, with somewhat lower coupling beneath the northern half, and with low coupling elsewhere. These initial results show the promise for detailed imaging of the <b>locked</b> <b>portion</b> of a thrust interface responsible for future large subduction zone earthquakes...|$|R

The third phase is rapid land subsidence, 1. 7 m, during the earthquake of March 1964 that initiated intertidal silt accumulation above the peat. The final phase is the colonisation of mudflat by salt marsh communities during post-seismic land uplift. The microfossil data compare favourably with sequences from Washington, Oregon and British Columbia that record late Holocene submergence events caused by earthquakes. The comparable changes in microfossil assemblages record the different phases of relative land and sea-level changes and the magnitude of land subsidence caused by each earthquake (expressed relative to the tidal range at the site).

50|$|One {{critical}} test {{is nevertheless}} {{to consider the}} induction from experience that the externally observable world does not seem, at first approach, to be directly manipulable purely by mental energies alone. One can indirectly manipulate {{the world through the}} medium of the physical body, but it seems impossible to do so through pure thought (e.g. via psychokinesis). It might be argued that if the external world were merely a construct of a single consciousness, i.e. the self, it could then follow that the external world should be somehow directly manipulable by that consciousness, and if it is not, then solipsism is false. An argument against this states the notion that such manipulation may be possible but barred from the conscious self via the subconscious self, a 'locked' portion of the mind that is still nevertheless the same mind. Lucid dreaming might be considered an example of when these <b>locked</b> <b>portions</b> of the subconscious become accessible. An argument against this might be brought up in asking why the subconscious of the mind would be locked, also the access, to the autonomous ('locked') portions of the mind during the lucid dreaming, is obviously much different (for instance: is relatively more transient) than the access to autonomous regions of the perceived nature.|$|R
40|$|Creeping dislocations in {{an elastic}} {{half-space}} {{are commonly used}} to model interseismic deformation at subduction zones, and might also apply to major intracontinental thrust faults such as the Main Himalayan Thrust. Here, we compare such models with a more realistic 2 -D finite element model that accounts for the mechanical layering of the continental lithosphere and surface processes, and that was found to fit all available constraints on interseismic and long-term surface displacements. These can also be fitted satisfactorily from dislocation models. The conventional back-slip model, commonly used for subduction zones, may, however, lead to a biased inference about the geometry of the <b>locked</b> <b>portion</b> of the thrust fault. We therefore favour {{the use of a}} creeping buried dislocation that simulates the ductile shear zone in the lower crust. A limitation of dislocation models is that the mechanical response of the lithosphere to the growth of the topography by bending of the elastic cores and ductile flow in the lower crust cannot be easily introduced. Fortunately these effects can be neglected because we may assume, to first order, a stationary topography. Moreover, we show that not only can dislocation models be used to adjust surface displacements but, with some caution, they can also provide a physically sound rationale to interpret interseismic microseismicity in terms of stress variations...|$|R

25|$|Tectonic {{earthquakes}} occur {{anywhere in}} the earth where there is sufficient stored elastic strain energy to drive fracture propagation along a fault plane. The sides of a fault move past each other smoothly and aseismically only {{if there are no}} irregularities or asperities along the fault surface that increase the frictional resistance. Most fault surfaces do have such asperities and this leads to a form of stick-slip behavior. Once the fault has locked, continued relative motion between the plates leads to increasing stress and therefore, stored strain energy in the volume around the fault surface. This continues until the stress has risen sufficiently to break through the asperity, suddenly allowing sliding over the <b>locked</b> <b>portion</b> of the fault, releasing the stored energy. This energy is released as a combination of radiated elastic strain seismic waves, frictional heating of the fault surface, and cracking of the rock, thus causing an earthquake. This process of gradual build-up of strain and stress punctuated by occasional sudden earthquake failure {{is referred to as the}} elastic-rebound theory. It is estimated that only 10 percent or less of an earthquake's total energy is radiated as seismic energy. Most of the earthquake's energy is used to power the earthquake fracture growth or is converted into heat generated by friction. Therefore, earthquakes lower the Earth's available elastic potential energy and raise its temperature, though these changes are negligible compared to the conductive and convective flow of heat out from the Earth's deep interior.|$|R

40|$|Automatically {{detected}} {{and located}} tremor epicenters from episodic tremor and slip (ETS) episodes in northern Cascadia provide a high-resolution map of Washington’s slow slip region. Thousands of epicenters {{from the past}} four ETS events from 2004 to 2008 provide detailed map-view constraints that correlate with geodetic estimates of the simultaneous slow slip. Each of these ETS events exhibits remarkable similarity in the timing and geographic distribution of tremor density and geodetically inferred slip. Analysis of the latest 15 -month inter-ETS period also reveals ageodetic tremor activity similar both in duration and extent to ETS tremor. Epicenters from both ETS and inter- ETS tremor are bounded between the 30 - and 45 -km plate interface depth contours and locate approximately 75 km east of previous estimates of the <b>locked</b> <b>portion</b> of the subducting Juan de Fuca plate. Inter-ETS tremor overlaps but is generally downdip of ETS tremor and does not yet correlate with geodetically observed slip, but this is likely because the slip is below current GPS detection levels. Based on the tremor and slip correlation and the tremor-duration and slip magnitude relationship, we suggest that the well-resolved, sharp updip edge of tremor epicenters reflects a change in plate interface coupling properties. The region updip of this boundary may accumulate stress {{with the potential for}} coseismic shear failure during a megathrust earthquake.

30|$|A second {{scenario}} is suggested {{based on our}} observations in Segment B (Category 1, Fig. 7 (c)). By analyzing permanent GPS data, {{it has been suggested}} that the area located at the down-dip limit of the seismogenic zone off northern Tohoku and south of Hokkaido, extending from 39 °N to 42 °N (Segment B), has been decoupled (Mazzotti et al., 2000). Segment B coincides with the lower limit of the <b>locked</b> <b>portion,</b> which was ruptured during the MW 7.6 San-riku earthquake in December 1994 (Nakayama and Takeo, 1997) (Fig. 1). Thus, a large amount of energy was released by the 1994 mainshock and slow slips followed subsequently in the rupture area (Kawasaki et al., 2001), as expressed by the substantial seismic moment release in the up-dip portion shown in category 2 (Fig. 5 (a)). Meanwhile, a significant part of the elastic energy is dissipated silently through the postseismic afterslip generated in the down-dip area (Heki et al., 1997; Mazzotti et al., 2000; Uchida et al., 2006). An excess of seismic slip in the down-dip area has also been suggested by geodetic data analysis (Hashimoto et al., 2009). As a result, the strain energy has been released aseismically in the down-dip portion of Segment B, which is reflected in the low ΣM 0 value in Figs. 4 (a) and 5 (b). In addition, the large seismic moment released by the previous large earthquakes and the subsequent slow slip in Segment B acted as a barrier to prevent the extension of both the 2011 Tohoku mainshock rupture and its aftershock activity (Kosuga and Watanabe, 2011). This mechanism may explain why there have been only a few postseismic seismic moment increases in the northern part of this area (Fig. 2).|$|R

50|$|MD 285 {{originally}} only included Biddle Street. The highway was paved as a 18 ft concrete {{road from}} Lock Street to the Delaware state line between 1928 and 1930. The <b>Lock</b> Street <b>portion</b> of MD 285 was constructed over multiple steps and assigned multiple designations {{as part of}} the Cecilton - Elkton highway, {{which was one of the}} original state roads the Maryland State Roads Commission designated for improvement in 1909. The portion of the highway from Elkton to the north town limit of Chesapeake City, including both segments of Hemphill Street and the stretch of MD 285 between them, was constructed as a 14 ft macadam road between 1911 and 1914. At that time, the main highway from the north followed Hemphill Street through the northern half of Chesapeake City and crossed the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal on a one-lane bridge.|$|R
40|$|We present {{high-resolution}} {{measurements of}} interseismic deformation along the central {{section of the}} North Anatolian Fault (NAF) in Turkey using interferometric synthetic aperture radar data from the Advanced Land Observing Satellite and Envisat missions. We generated maps of satellite line-of-sight velocity using five ascending Advanced Land Observing Satellite tracks and one descending Envisat track covering the NAF between 31. 2 degrees E and 34. 3 degrees E. The line-of-sight velocity reveals discontinuities of up to similar to 5 mm/yr across the Ismetpasa segment of the NAF, implying surface creep {{at a rate of}} similar to 9 mm/yr; this is a large fraction of the inferred slip rate of the NAF (21 - 25 mm/yr). The lateral extent of significant surface creep is about 75 km. We model the inferred surface velocity and shallow fault creep using numerical simulations of spontaneous earthquake sequences that incorporate laboratory-derived rate and state friction. Our results indicate that frictional behavior in the Ismetpasa segment is velocity strengthening at shallow depths and transitions to velocity weakening at a depth of 3 - 6 km. The inferred depth extent of shallow fault creep is 5. 5 - 7 km, suggesting that the deeper <b>locked</b> <b>portion</b> of the partially creeping segment is characterized by a higher stressing rate, smaller events, and shorter recurrence interval. We also reproduce surface velocity in a locked segment of the NAF by fault models with velocity-weakening conditions at shallow depth. Our results imply that frictional behavior in a shallow portion of major active faults with little or no shallow creep is mostly velocity weakening. Citation: Kaneko, Y., Y. Fialko, D. T.
