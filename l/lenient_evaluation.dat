40|$|Fine-grain non-strict data {{structures}} such as I-structure provide {{high level}} abstraction to easily write programs with potentially high parallelism due to the eager evaluation (<b>lenient</b> <b>evaluation)</b> of non-strict functions and non-strict structured-data such as arrays. Non-strict data structures require frequent dynamic scheduling at fine-grain level, which offsets the gain of latency hiding. Not only the dynamic scheduling but also asynchronous accesses to structured-data using non-strict data structures cause heavy overhead on stock machines. Mutual exclusion of structured-data on shared memory systems also causes overhead. In order to reduce overhead of fine-grain non-strict structured-data, we propose a compilation technique to analyze dependencies between the structured-data and to schedule producers and consumers of the structured-data. The performance evaluation {{results indicate that the}} technique is effective to improve the performance of fine-grain non-strict programs with structured-data on shared memory systems...|$|E
40|$|Lenient languages, such as Id 90, {{have been}} touted {{as among the}} best {{functional}} languages for massively parallel machines [AHN 88]. <b>Lenient</b> <b>evaluation</b> combines non-strict semantics with eager evaluation [Tra 9 1]. Non-strictness gives these languages more expressive power than strict semantics, while eager evaluation ensures the highest degree of parallelism. Unfortunately, non-strictness incurs a large overhead, as it requires dynamic scheduling and synchronization. As a result, many powerful program analysis techniques {{have been developed to}} statically determine when non-strictness is not required [CPJ 85, Tra 91, Sch 94]. This paper studies a large set of lenient programs and quantifies the degree of non-strictness they require. We identify several forms of non-strictness, including functional, conditional, and data structure non-strictness. Surprisingly, most Id 90 programs require neither functional nor conditional non-strictness. Many benchmark programs, however, make use of a limited form of data structure non-strictness. The paper refutes the myth that lenient programs require extensive non-strictness...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the CUHK opinion analysis system, namely Opinmine, for the NTCIR- 6 pilot task. Opinmine comprises of three functional modules: (1) Preprocessing and Assignment Module (PAM) performs word segmentation, part-of-speech (POS) tagging and named entity recognition on the input Chinese text. It {{is based on}} lexicalized Hidden Markov Model and heuristic rules. (2) Knowledge Acquisition Module (KAM) applies unsupervised learning techniques to acquire different opinion knowledge including opinion operator, opinion indicator and opinion words from annotated data and Web data. (3) Sentence Analysis Module (SAM) analyzes each input sentence {{to determine whether it}} is opinionated. For each opinionated sentence, its opinion holders, opinion operators and opinion words are recognized and its polarity is determined. Furthermore, the relevance between the sentence and a topic are judged by based on sentence-topic and document-topic relevance. For <b>lenient</b> <b>evaluation,</b> the F 1 performance of Opinmine in opinion extraction, polarity decision and relevance judgment are 0. 635, 0. 405 and 0. 812, respectively; and for strict evaluation, the F 1 performances are 0. 427, 0. 296 and 0. 616, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{studies have}} shown that the moral {{judgments}} are influenced by many biasing factors, like the consequences of a behavior, certain characteristics of the agent who commits the act, or the words chosen to describe the behavior. In the present study we investigated a new factor that could bias the evaluation of morally relevant human behavior: the perceived similarity between the participants and the agent described in the moral scenario. The participants read a story about a driver who illegally overtook another car and hit a pedestrian who was crossing the street. The latter was taken to the hospital with a broken leg. The driver was described either as being similar to the participant (a student, 21 years old, the same gender as th­e participant) or dissimilar (a retired person, 69 years old, different gender as the participant). The results show that the participants from the increased similarity group expressed more <b>lenient</b> <b>evaluations</b> of the immorality of the driver’s behavior compared to the participants from the decreased similarity group. The results are discussed within a framework which puts emphasis on motivational and protective reasons...|$|R

This thesis investigates three relevant human resource practices: subjective performance evaluations, target agreements and intra-firm trainings. Four empirical papers are presented that reveal insights about biases in performance evaluations, gender differences in manager's evaluation behavior, the determinants and effects of using target agreements and the effects of intra-firm trainings. Chapter 2 examines the often claimed conjecture that subjective performance evaluations are biased due to personal preferences of supervisors towards their subordinates. It is hence empirically analyzed whether the social proximity in a supervisor-subordinate relationship implies <b>lenient</b> <b>evaluations</b> when holding the performance of individuals constant. Based on personnel records of a call-center it is shown, while controlling for objective performance measures and using fixed effects regressions, that employees in smaller teams receive more <b>lenient</b> <b>evaluations</b> compared to employees working in larger teams. Also, a repeated appraisal by the same supervisor implies a more positive evaluation as compared to evaluations in first-time supervisor-subordinate relations. The third chapter analyzes whether female and male managers show different behavior when evaluating their subordinates. In detail, the gender difference in differentiating between employees is investigated. Higher differentiation in evaluations increases the marginal return for effort and should hence improve the incentive setting for employees. While conducting fixed effects regressions and eliminating unobserved heterogeneity between work units it is revealed that units that are supervised by female managers receive more differentiated grades than units with male supervisors. Also, female managers seem to do well in the tough part of differentiation, namely in assigning poor grades to employees. In chapter 4, an empirical analysis on the determinants and the effects of using target agreements on firm's performance is presented. Based on a large-scale survey data set of firms (IAB Panel) for the years 2005 and 2007, the company and workforce characteristics that may determine the use of target agreements in firms are analyzed. Moreover, it is shown that the introduction of target agreements seems to positively affect firm's performance. In the last chapter, the effects of employees' training participation on their absence behavior and turnover probability are being studied. Human capital theory suggests that receiving training in general skills increases their market value for other firms and should imply an increased turnover probability if wages are not adequately matched. Furthermore, accumulating human capital through training increases the employees' opportunity cost of working. Absenteeism should hence decrease persistently. Based on personnel records of a multinational firm we find that, in contrast to human capital predictions, general training leads to a decreased turnover probability. Loyalty is hence even reduced as general training may be perceived as a signal of trust in the employee. Furthermore, only a short term decrease in absenteeism is found for trained employees suggesting that employees might temporarily reciprocate to firm-sponsored trainings...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} suggests that performance evaluations conducted for personnel decisions tend to be substantially more <b>lenient</b> than performance <b>evaluations</b> conducted for research purposes. Because LOE is a “jeopardy ” event, we hypothesized that LOE ratings would be substantially more lenient that comparable LOFT ratings. The results failed to support this hypothesis. However, path analyses suggest that the instructors were using different rating strategies when evaluating overall PIC and SIC performance in LOFT than in LOE. Specifically, PIC and SIC ratings in the LOE tended to emphasize specific behavioral examples (i. e., TECH topics) to a much greater extent than in LOFT...|$|R

It mainly involves two problems, attribute recognition and decision making on whether this attribute belongs to the extracted person. Personal attributes generally involve named entities, which are recognized mainly by adjusting word segmentation software. As for those which cannot be recognized by word segmentation, the combination of feature words and rules can be used for their recognition. The combination of sentences classifications and rules is employed for attribute ownership decision. At first, all the sentences in the document are classified into those with attribute words and those without, with the latter omitted. The former are then classified into description sentences with one person and description sentences with more persons, according to the criterion that whether there are more than one person described in the sentence. According to statistics of description sentences with one person, anaphora resolution is not necessary, which reduces recognition errors from anaphora resolution failures. Minimum slicing is used for description sentences with more persons, and attribute ownership decision is made within the minimum language segment with the co-occurrence of both the person and the attribute. This method achieves 0. 507388780 and 0. 489505010 respectively in the <b>lenient</b> <b>evaluation</b> results and the strict evaluation results of SF_Value in CIPS-SIGHAN 20141 Bakeoff, which {{turns out to be the}} best. The fact has shown that the method is effective...|$|E
40|$|Id is an architecture-independent, {{general-purpose}} {{parallel programming}} language that has evolved and been in {{use for a}} number of years. Id does not have a sequential core; rather, it is implicitly parallel, with the programmer introducing sequencing explicitly only if necessary. Id is a mostly-functional language, in the family of non-strict functional languages with a HindleyMilner static type system. Unlike other non-strict functional languages, it uses <b>lenient,</b> not lazy <b>evaluation,</b> for reasons of parallelism, as well as to give meaning to non-functional constructs. The non-functional constructs come in two layers: I-structures (which preserve determinacy, but not referential transparency, and are closely related to logic variables), and M-structures, which are side-effects with implicit synchronization. The layers are distinguished by syntax and types, so that it is possible for an implementation to force a program to be within a desired layer (e. g., purely functional) [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|Classroom {{observation}} {{is the most}} implemented method to evaluate teaching. To ensure reliability, researchers often train observers extensively. However, schools have limited resources to train observers and often lesson {{observation is}} performed by limitedly trained or untrained colleagues. In this study an evaluation procedure is implemented which is dependent on classroom observation by limitedly trained (3 hours) peers. To study whether observations have sufficient reliability, two different criteria are specified: one more <b>lenient</b> for formative <b>evaluation</b> {{and the other one}} strict for summative evaluation. The study aims to explore whether these criteria are realistic for schools. The sample contains 198 lesson observations of 69 teachers, by 62 peer-colleagues. Two different aspects of reliability are studied: (1) generalizability: the extend to which other lessons observed by other peers would give the same evaluation result, (2) person fit: the extend to which observations fit model assumptions. The results show that three peer-observers are required to achieve sufficient reliability for formative purposes, while more than 10 are required to achieve sufficient reliability...|$|R
