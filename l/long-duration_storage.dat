40|$|A Multilayer Insulation (MLI) and Broad Area Cooling (BAC) shield {{thermal control}} system shows promise for <b>long-duration</b> <b>storage</b> of {{cryogenic}} propellant. The NASA Cryogenic Propellant Storage and Transfer (CPST) project {{is investigating the}} thermal and structural performance of this tank-applied integrated system. The MLI/BAC Shield Acoustic and Thermal Test was performed to evaluate the MLI/BAC shield's structural performance by subjecting it to worst-case launch acoustic loads. Identical thermal tests using Liquid Nitrogen (LN 2) were performed {{before and after the}} acoustic test. The data from these tests was compared to determine if any degradation occurred in the thermal performance of the system as a result of exposure to the acoustic loads. The thermal test series consisted of two primary components: a passive boil-off test to evaluate the MLI performance and an active cooling test to evaluate the integrated MLI/BAC shield system with chilled vapor circulating through the BAC shield tubes. The acoustic test used loads closely matching the worst-case envelope of all launch vehicles currently under consideration for CPST. Acoustic test results yielded reasonable responses for the given load. The thermal test matrix was completed prior to the acoustic test and successfully repeated after the acoustic test. Data was compared and yielded near identical results, indicating that the MLI/BAC shield configuration tested in this series is an option for structurally implementing this thermal control system concept...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{prediction}} of the thermodynamic {{state of the}} cryogenic propellants in launch vehicle tanks is necessary for mission planning and successful execution. Cryogenic propellant storage and transfer in space environments requires that tank pressure be controlled. The pressure rise rate {{is determined by the}} complex interaction of external heat leak, fluid temperature stratification, and interfacial heat and mass transfer. If the required storage duration of a space mission is longer than the period in which the tank pressure reaches its allowable maximum, an appropriate pressure control method must be applied. Therefore, predictions of the pressurization rate and performance of pressure control techniques in cryogenic tanks are required for development of cryogenic fluid <b>long-duration</b> <b>storage</b> technology and planning of future space exploration missions. This paper describes an analytical tool, Tank System Integrated Model (TankSIM), which can be used for modeling pressure control and predicting the behavior of cryogenic propellant for long-term storage for future space missions. It is written in the FORTRAN 90 language and can be compiled with any Visual FORTRAN compiler. A thermodynamic vent system (TVS) is used to achieve tank pressure control. Utilizing TankSIM, the following processes can be modeled: tank self-pressurization, boiloff, ullage venting, and mixing.

40|$|Tests {{conducted}} at the NASA Lewis Research Center's Supplemental Multilayer Insulation Research Facility (SMIRF) demonstrated that a hybrid thermal control system could eliminate boiloff of cryogenic propellants. This is significant because of the substantial mass and cost savings that could be achieved for any long-duration space mission that requires cryogenic propellants. With <b>long-duration</b> cryogenic <b>storage,</b> propellants will boil off because of the environmental heating of the tank. To accommodate these losses, extra propellant is required along with larger propellant tanks.

40|$|Compressed air {{energy storage}} (CAES) is a commercial, {{utility-scale}} technology that provides <b>long-duration</b> energy <b>storage</b> with fast ramp rates and good part-load operation. It is a promising storage technology for balancing the large-scale penetration of renewable energies, such as {{wind and solar}} power, into electric grids. This study proposes a CAES-CC system, {{which is based on}} a conventional CAES combined with a steam turbine cycle by waste heat boiler. Simulation and thermodynamic analysis are carried out on the proposed CAES-CC system. The electricity and heating rates of the proposed CAES-CC system are lower than those of the conventional CAES by 0. 127 kWh/kWh and 0. 338 kWh/kWh, respectively, because the CAES-CC system recycles high-temperature turbine-exhausting air. The overall efficiency of the CAES-CC system is improved by approximately 10 % compared with that of the conventional CAES. In the CAES-CC system, compressing intercooler heat can keep the steam turbine on hot standby, thus improving the flexibility of CAES-CC.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate, in Nellore heifers, intake and digestibility of hydrolyzed sugarcane stored for different periods. The experimental design used was a 4 × 4 Latin square, four diets, four Nellore heifers with ruminal cannulas (initial body weight 285. 4 ± 23. 08 kg and average initial age 14 months) and four periods of 21 days. The diets were composed by fresh sugarcane (time zero) or hydrolyzed sugarcane with addition of 0. 5 % of hydrated lime, stored for 24, 48 or 72 hours, as the unique forage. Intake and digestibility of feed fractions, nitrogen balance, microbial synthesis efficiency, total number of ruminal protozoans and ammoniacal nitrogen did not significantly change by storing sugarcane with addition of 0. 5 % of hydrated lime. Sugarcane pH varied quadratically for storage time, with maximum pH of 7. 02 after 24 hours from lime addition. Ruminal liquid pH values were higher for heifers fed fresh sugarcane, in comparison with those fed hydrolyzed sugarcane. Sugarcane treated with 0. 5 % of hydrated lime stored for up to 72 hours does not change ruminal digestion to alter the amount of feed consumed by pubescent Nellore heifers. Thus, lime is a viable technology, once it allows <b>long-duration</b> <b>storage</b> and bee control on treated forage, which contributes to animal feeding logistics...|$|E
40|$|Compressed air {{energy storage}} (CAES) is a {{large-scale}} technology that provides <b>long-duration</b> energy <b>storage.</b> It is promising for balancing the large-scale penetration of intermittent and dispersed sources of power, such as {{wind and solar}} power, into electric grids. The existing CAES plants utilize natural gas (NG) as fuel. However, China is rich in coal but is deficient in NG; therefore, a hybrid-fuel CAES is proposed and analyzed in this study. Based on the existing CAES plants, the hybrid-fuel CAES incorporates an external combustion heater into the power generation subsystem to heat the air from the recuperator and the air from the high-pressure air turbine. Coal is the fuel for the external combustion heater. The overall efficiency and exergy efficiency of the hybrid-fuel CAES are 61. 18 % and 59. 84 %, respectively. Given the same parameters, the cost of electricity (COE) of the hybrid-fuel CAES, which requires less NG, is $ 5. 48 /MW∙h {{less than that of}} the gas-fuel CAES.

These can be realized by storing the quantum states of light as single-spin excitations in atomic ensembles. However, spin states are often subjected to different dephasing processes that limit the storage time, which in principle could be overcome using spin-echo techniques. Theoretical studies have suggested this to be challenging due to unavoidable spontaneous emission noise in ensemble-based quantum memories.

40|$|For <b>long-duration</b> in-space <b>storage</b> of {{cryogenic}} propellants, an {{axial jet}} mixer is one concept for controlling tank pressure and reducing thermal stratification. Extensive ground-test {{data from the}} 1960 s to the present exist for tank diameters of 10 ft or less. The design of axial jet mixers for tanks {{on the order of}} 30 ft diameter, such as those planned for the Ares V Earth Departure Stage (EDS) LH 2 tank, will require scaling of available experimental data from much smaller tanks, as well designing for microgravity effects. This study will assess the ability for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to handle a change of scale of this magnitude by performing simulations of existing ground-based axial jet mixing experiments at two tank sizes differing by a factor of ten. Simulations of several axial jet configurations for an Ares V scale EDS LH 2 tank during low Earth orbit (LEO) coast are evaluated and selected results are also presented. Data from jet mixing experiments performed in the 1960 s by General Dynamics with water at two tank sizes (1 and 10 ft diameter) are used to evaluate CFD accuracy. Jet nozzle diameters ranged from 0. 032 to 0. 25 in. for the 1 ft diameter tank experiments and from 0. 625 to 0. 875 in. for the 10 ft diameter tank experiments. Thermally stratified layers were created in both tanks prior to turning on the jet mixer. Jet mixer efficiency was determined by monitoring the temperatures on thermocouple rakes in the tanks to time when the stratified layer was mixed out. Dye was frequently injected into the stratified tank and its penetration recorded. There were no velocities or turbulence quantities available in the experimental data. A commercially available, time accurate, multi-dimensional CFD code with free surface tracking (FLOW- 3 D from Flow Science, Inc.) is used for the simulations presented.

40|$|Cryogenic fluid {{management}} {{is a critical}} technical area that is needed for future space exploration. A key challenge is the storability of liquid hydrogen (LH 2), liquid methane (LCH 4), and liquid oxygen (LOX) propellants for <b>long-duration</b> missions. The <b>storage</b> tanks must be well-insulated to prevent over-pressurization and venting, {{which can lead to}} unacceptable propellant losses for long-duration missions to Mars and beyond. Aspen Aerogels had validated the key process step to enable the fabrication of thin, low-density aerogel materials.

40|$|Developments in NASA Glenn Research Center's Centaur {{work have}} led to an {{exciting}} new cryogenic storage concept being considered for future NASA space missions. With <b>long-duration</b> cryogenic <b>storage,</b> propellants will boil off because of the environmental heating of the tank. To accommodate these losses, extra propellant is required along with larger propellant tanks. Analyses of space transportation concepts show that spacetransfer cryogenic stages with the zero boiloff (ZBO) cryogenic storage concept reduce the stage mass for missions longer than approximately 45 days in low Earth orbit. The ZBO system consists of an active cryocooling system using a cryocooler in addition to traditional passive thermal insulation. Engineers at Glenn analyzed, designed, built, and bench tested a heat exchanger and integration hardware for a large-scale ZBO demonstration for the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. The heat exchanger, which transfers the heat that enters the tank from the fluid to the cryocooler, must limit the temperature difference across it to limit the cryocooler size and power requirements. With a low temperature difference, the system efficiency is improved. For that temperature difference to be reduced, the thermal conductivity must {{be as high as}} possible at liquid hydrogen temperatures, around 25 K (- 248 C). In addition, {{it is important for the}} heat exchanger to be welded to a stainless steel flange and have enough strength to accommodate piping stress. High-conductivity copper was selected and fabricated, then integrated with the stainless steel piping tee as shown in the cutaway representation. Literature showed that this conductivity might range from 2 to 100 W/cm/K but that is was likely to be around 13 W/cm/K. Unexpectedly, this conductivity was measured to be 23 W/cm/K, which limited the temperature increase along the heat exchanger to just 2 K. This limited temperature increase, compared with the predicted difference of 3. 5 K, improves the overall system efficiency by 7. 4 percent and limits the expected integration losses to a projected 4 percent with a flight design for liquid hydrogen storage. These results improve the cryocooler integration concept by allowing the cryocooler to operate at a lower input power, or by potentially permitting a smaller cryocooler to be selected...|$|R
40|$|Space mission {{planning}} {{often involves}} long-term storage of volatile liquids or high-pressure gases. These may include cryogenic fuels and oxidizers, high-pressure gases, and life-support-critical consumables. The {{risk associated with}} the storage of fluids and gases in space systems {{has long been an}} issue and the ability to retain these fluids is often tied to mission success. A leak in the storage or distribution system can cause many different problems, including a simple, but mission endangering, loss of inventory or, in severe cases, unbalanced thrust loads on a flight vehicle. Cryogenic propellants are especially difficult to store, especially over a long duration. The propellant can boil off and be lost through the insulating walls of the tank or simple thermal cycling of the fittings, valves, and propellant feed lines may unseat seals allowing the fluid to escape. Current NASA missions call for <b>long-duration</b> in-space <b>storage</b> of propellants, oxidizers, and life support supplies. Leaks of a scale detectable through a pressure drop in the storage tank are often catastrophic and have long been the focus of ground-based mitigation efforts where redundant systems are often employed. However, there is presently no technology available for detecting and monitoring low-level, but still mission-endangering, gas leaks in space. Standard in-space gas detection methods either have a very limited pressure range over which they operate effectively or are limited to certain gases. Mass spectrometer systems are able to perform the detection tasks, but their size, mass and use of high voltage, which could potentially lead to an arc that ignites a combustible propellent, severely limit their usefulness in a space system. In this paper, we present results from testing of the light-based interferometric gas monitoring and leak detection sensor shown in Fig. 1. The output of the sensor is an interference fringe pattern that {{is a function of the}} gas density, and commensurate index of refraction, in the sample region. Changes in the density of gas cause the interference fringes to move across a photodiode detector, providing a temporal history of the leak. The sensor is fiber coupled and constructed from solid optics, allowing for placement almost anywhere on the spacecraft. It is also advantageous in that it consumes very little power and does not introduce an ignition source. Data are presented demonstrating the capability of the sensor to measure density variations in different gas species. In addition, the transient response of the sensor in vacuum is demonstrated. These data extend and improve upon the results previously presented by the authors in Ref. [1]...|$|R
