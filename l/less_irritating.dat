Calcium carbonate preparations should also be avoided; calcium as citrate or gluconate (with 1200mg as calcium) has greater bioavailability independent of acid in the stomach, and will likely be better absorbed.

40|$|Past {{research}} has shown that the sex of a crying infant can affect the way adults perceive an infant's emotions and respond to crying. It was hypothesized that a female infant's crying would be perceived as primarily fearful whereas a male infant's crying would be perceived as primarily angry. It was also predicted that both parents and non-parents would respond more quickly to the distress of an infant they believed to be a female. Forty-one college students and forty parents were shown the same two video clips of a four-month-old infant crying. Participants rated the infant's emotions, their own reactions to the infant, and the time that they would intervene to pick up the infant in two randomly assigned conditions: when the infant was given a male label ("Ethan") or a female label ("Emily"). Contrary to our prediction, results indicated that the sex label assigned to the infant did not significantly impact adult reactions. The sex of the participant, on the other hand, did {{have a significant effect on}} reactions to the infant crying. Women were generally more sympathetic and <b>less</b> <b>irritated</b> by crying. In addition, there was a significant interaction between participant sex and parental status. Parents were <b>less</b> <b>irritated</b> by crying than non-parents, however, this effect was far more pronounced for men than women. This finding is discussed in terms of the role of both biological and experiential factors in promoting sensitive and responsive parenting...|$|R

He found her sense of duty more stubborn than he had anticipated, and soon had no more to say. She might carry it too far; but the principle was sound, and a father could not well controvert it. He had designed the rupture with Louis as a penalty to drive her into his measures; but he could not so propound it, and was wondering how to bring it in, when Mary relieved him by beginning herself, and stating the grounds with such sensible, unselfish, almost motherly care of Louis's happiness, that he was more unwilling than ever to let him resign her, and was on the point of begging her to re-consider, and let Louis wait for ever rather than lose her. But he knew they ought not to be bound, under such uncertainties, and his conviction was too strong to give way to emotion. He thanked her, and praised her with unwonted agitation, and regretted more than ever; and so they closed the conference by deciding that, unless Mr. Ponsonby should be induced to relent by his daughter's representations on her arrival, Mary and Louis must consider themselves as mutually released.|$|R

40|$|An {{increasing}} {{amount of}} people have their work hours displaced to the night and {{there are indications that}} shift work and other irregular working schedules are associated with an increased risk of developing the metabolic syndrome and other pathological conditions. It is therefore important to address the consequences of eating at irregular hours, especially nighttime. Papers I-III refer to a study in which 7 males were given a high-carbohydrate diet (HC) or a high-fat diet (HF), using a cross-over design. Subjects were kept awake for 24 h and food was provided as 6 equally spaced isocaloric meals. Higher energy expenditure and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) concentration, as well as lower glucose and triacylglycerol (TAG) concentrations were observed with the HF-diet, compared to the HC-diet. With the HF-diet, fat oxidation, heat release, heart rate, glucose, NEFA and TAG concentrations differed depending on time of day. The highest postprandial TAG concentrations were seen after the 04. 00 meal with both diets. Insulin and leptin responses to meal intake differed with respect to diet and time of day. Time of day affected glucagon, thyroid stimulating hormone, free thyroxin, total triiodothyronine (tT 3), cortisol, chromogranin A and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) concentrations. PP’s postprandial increase was greater during 08. 00 – 16. 00 compared to 20. 00 – 08. 00. Furthermore, the subjects felt <b>less</b> <b>irritated</b> when eating the HF-diet but hunger was not related to macronutrient composition. Hunger and thirst decreased throughout the 24 h period despite constant activity and energy intake; and were correlated with several endocrine and metabolic variables. In paper IV 7 males were studied twice during 24 -h either given 6 isocaloric meals throughout the 24 -h period, or 4 isocaloric meals from 08. 00 to 20. 00, followed by a nocturnal fast. Energy expenditure, glucose, TAG, insulin and glucagon concentrations were lower; and NEFA concentrations were higher during the nocturnal fast compared to nocturnal eating; although no 24 h differences between the protocols were apparent. The subjects were more passive during the fasting period compared to when food was given. Stepwise regression showed that correlations between metabolic variables and hormones differed between daytime and nighttime. The decreased evening/nocturnal responses of cortisol and PP to meal intake suggest that nocturnal eating might have health implications and that the body reacts unfavorably to nocturnal eating. Smaller meals around the clock, however, showed marginally better effects on postprandial TAG concentrations and mental energy compared to larger meals during daytime. Further studies (long term) are needed before dietary guidelines can be given to shift workers, especially regarding the impact of nocturnal eating on gastrointestinal response and cortisol...|$|R

60|$|When Lucy had {{completed}} {{the reading of the}} letters she sat for a considerable time wrapped in thought. There was, in truth, very much that required thinking. It was proposed that the whole tenour of her life should be changed, and changed in a direction which would certainly suit her taste. She had acknowledged to herself that she had hated the comparative poverty of her Uncle Dosett's life, hating herself in that she was compelled to make such acknowledgment. But there had been more than the poverty which had been distasteful to her,--a something which she had been able to tell herself that she might be justified in hating without shame. There had been to her an absence of intellectual charm in the habits and manners of Kingsbury Crescent which she had regarded as unfortunate and depressing. There had been no thought of art delights. No one read poetry. No one heard music. No one looked at pictures. A sheet to be darned was the one thing of greatest importance. The due development of a leg of mutton, the stretching of a pound of butter, the best way of repressing the washerwoman's bills,--these had been the matters of interest. And they had not been made the <b>less</b> <b>irritating</b> to her by her aunt's extreme goodness in the matter. The leg of mutton was to be developed in the absence of her uncle,--if possible without his knowledge. He was to have his run of clean linen. Lucy did not grudge him anything, but was sickened by that partnership in economy which was established between her and her aunt. Undoubtedly from time to time she had thought of the luxuries which had been thrown in Ayala's way. There had been a regret,--not that Ayala should have them but that she should have missed them. Money she declared that she despised;--but the easy luxury of the bijou was sweet to her memory.|$|E
6000|$|It {{is safe to}} {{say that}} such things took place there in the last century, during the kindly reign of Monsieur and Madame Dupin. This period {{presents}} itself as the happiest in the annals of Chenonceaux. I know not what festive train the great Diana may have led, and my imagination, I am afraid, is only feebly kindled by the records of the luxurious pastimes organised on the banks of the Cher by that terrible daughter of the Medici whose appreciation of the good things of life was perfectly consistent with a failure to perceive why others should live to enjoy them. The best society that ever assembled there was collected at Chenonceaux during the middle of the eighteenth century. This was surely, in France at least, the age of good society, the period when the [...] "right people" [...] made every haste to be born in time. Such people must of course have belonged to the fortunate few--not to the miserable many; for if a society be large enough to be good, it must also be small enough. The sixty years that preceded the Revolution were the golden age of fireside talk and of those amenities that proceed from the presence of women in whom the social art is both instinctive and acquired. The women of that period were, above all, good company; the fact is attested in a thousand documents. Chenonceaux offered a perfect setting to free conversation; and infinite joyous discourse must have mingled with the liquid murmur of the Cher. Claude Dupin was not only a great man of business, but a man of honour and a patron of knowledge; and his wife was gracious, clever, and wise. They had acquired this famous property by purchase (from one of the Bourbons, as Chenonceaux, for two centuries after the death of Catherine de'Medici, remained constantly in princely hands), and it was transmitted to their son, Dupin de Francueil, grandfather of Madame George Sand. This lady, in her Correspondence, lately published, describes a visit that she paid more than thirty years ago to those members of her family who were still in possession. The owner of Chenonceaux to-day[a] is the daughter of an Englishman naturalised in France. But I have wandered far from my story, which is simply a sketch of the surface of the place. Seen obliquely, from either side, in combination with its bridge and gallery, the structure is singular and fantastic, a striking example of a wilful and capricious conception. Unfortunately all caprices are not so graceful and successful, and I grudge the honour of this one to the false and blood-polluted Catherine. (To be exact, I believe the arches of the bridge were laid by the elderly Diana. It was Catherine, however, who completed the monument.) Within, the house has been, as usual, restored. The staircases and ceilings, in all the old royal residences of this part of France, are the parts that have suffered least; many of them have still much of the life of the old time about them. Some of the chambers of Chenonceaux, however, encumbered as they are with modern detail, derive a sufficiently haunted and suggestive look from the deep setting of their beautiful windows, which thickens the shadows and makes dark corners. There is a charming little Gothic chapel, with its apse hanging over the water, fastened to the left flank of the house. Some of the upper balconies, which look along the outer face of the gallery and either up or down the river, are delightful protected nooks. We walked through the lower gallery to the other bank of the Cher; this fine apartment appeared to be for the moment a purgatory of ancient furniture. It terminates rather abruptly; it simply stops, with a blank wall. There ought, of course, to have been a pavilion here, though I prefer very much the old defect to any modern remedy. The wall is not so blank, however, but that it contains a door which opens on a rusty drawbridge. This drawbridge traverses the small gap which divides the end of the gallery from the bank of the stream. The house, therefore, does not literally rest on opposite edges of the Cher, but rests on one and just fails to rest on the other. The pavilion would have made that up; but after a moment we ceased to miss this imaginary feature. We passed the little drawbridge, and wandered awhile beside the river. From this opposite bank the mass of the château looked more charming than ever; and the little peaceful, lazy Cher, where two or three men were fishing in the eventide, flowed under the clear arches and between the solid pedestals of the part that spanned it, with the softest, vaguest light on its bosom. This was the right perspective; we were looking across the river of time. The whole scene was deliciously mild. The moon came up; we passed back through the gallery and strolled about a little longer in the gardens. It was very still. I met my old gondolier in the twilight. He showed me his gondola, but I hated, somehow, to see it there. I don't like, as the French say, to mêler les genres. A gondola in a little flat French river? The image was not <b>less</b> <b>irritating,</b> if less injurious, than the spectacle of a steamer in the Grand Canal, which had driven me away from Venice a year and a half before. We took our way back to the Bon Laboureur, and waited in the little inn-parlour for a late train to Tours. We were not impatient, for we had an excellent dinner to occupy us; and even after we had dined we were still content to sit awhile and exchange remarks upon the superior civilisation of France. Where else, at a village inn, should we have fared so well? Where else should we have sat down to our refreshment without condescension? There were a couple of countries in which it would not have been happy for us to arrive hungry, on a Sunday evening, at so modest an hostelry. At the little inn at Chenonceaux the cuisine was not only excellent, but the service was graceful. We were waited on by mademoiselle and her mamma; it was so that mademoiselle alluded to the elder lady as she uncorked for us a bottle of Vouvray mousseux. We were very comfortable, very genial; we even went so far as to say to each other that Vouvray mousseux was a delightful wine. From this opinion indeed one of our trio differed; but this member of the party had already exposed herself to the charge of being too fastidious by declining to descend from the carriage at Chaumont and take that back-stairs view of the castle.|$|E

The owner of Chenonceaux to-day is the daughter of an Englishman naturalized in France. But I have wandered far from my story, which is simply a sketch of the surface of the place. Seen obliquely, from either side, in combination with its bridge and gallery, the chateau is singular and fantastic, a striking example of a wilful and capricious conception. Unfortunately, all caprices are not so graceful and successful, and I grudge the honor of this one to the false and blood- polluted Catherine. (To be exact, I believe the arches of the bridge were laid by the elderly Diana. It was Catherine, however, who completed the monument.) Within, the house has been, as usual, restored. The staircases and ceilings, in all the old royal residences of this part of France, are the parts that have suffered least; many of them have still much of the life of the old time about them. Some of the chambers of Che- nonceaux, however, encumbered as they are with mo- dern detail, derive a sufficiently haunted and suggestive look from the deep setting of their beautiful windows, which thickens the shadows and makes dark, corners. There is a charming little Gothic chapel, with its apse hanging over the water, fastened to the left flank of the house. Some of the upper balconies, which look along the outer face of the gallery, and either up or down the river, are delightful protected nooks. We walked through the lower gallery to the other bank of the Cher; this fine apartment appeared to be for the moment a purgatory of ancient furniture. It terminates rather abruptly; it simply stops, with a blank wall. There ought, of course, to have been a pavilion here, though I prefer very much the old defect to any mo- dern remedy. The wall is not so blank, however, but that it contains a door which opens on a rusty draw- bridge. This drawbridge traverses the small gap which divides the end of the gallery from the bank of the stream. The house, therefore, does not literally rest on opposite edges of the Cher, but rests on one and just fails to rest on the other. The pavilion would have made that up; but after a moment we ceased to miss this imaginary feature. We passed the little drawbridge, and wandered awhile beside the river. From this opposite bank the mass of the chateau looked more charming than ever; and the little peaceful, lazy Cher, where two or three men were fishing in the eventide, flowed under the clear arches and between the solid pedestals of the part that spanned it, with the softest, vaguest light on its bosom. This was the right perspective; we were looking across the river of time. The whole scene was deliciously mild. The moon came up; we passed back through the gallery and strolled about a little longer in the gardens. It was very still. I met my old gondolier in the twilight. He showed me his gondola; but I hated, somehow, to see it there. I don't like, as the French say, to meler les genres. A gondola in a little flat French river? The image was not <b>less</b> <b>irritating,</b> if less injurious, than the spectacle of a steamer in the Grand Canal, which had driven me away from Venice a year and a half before. We took our way back to the Grand Monarque, and waited in the little inn-parlor for a late train to Tours. We were not impatient, for we had an ex- cellent dinner to occupy us; and even after we had dined we were still content to sit awhile and exchange remarks upon, the superior civilization of France. Where else, at a village inn, should we have fared so well? Where else should we have sat down to our refreshment without condescension? There were two or three countries in which it would not have been happy for us to arrive hungry, on a Sunday evening, at so modest an hostelry. At the little inn at Chenon- ceaux the cuisine was not only excellent, but the ser- vice was graceful. We were waited on by mademoiselle and her mamma; it was so that mademoiselle alluded to the elder lady, as she uncorked for us a bottle of Vouvray mousseux. We were very comfortable, very genial; we even went so far as to say to each other that Vouvray mousseux was a delightful wine. From this opinion, indeed, one of our trio differed; but this member of the party had already exposed herself to the charge of being too fastidious, by declining to de- scend from the carriage at Chaumont and take that back-stairs view of the castle.|$|E
60|$|When the {{particulars}} of this conversation were repeated by Miss Dashwood to her sister, as they very soon were, the effect on her was not entirely such as the former had hoped to see. Not that Marianne appeared to distrust the truth of any part of it, for she listened to it all with the most steady and submissive attention, made neither objection nor remark, attempted no vindication of Willoughby, and seemed to shew by her tears that she felt it to be impossible. But though this behaviour assured Elinor that the conviction of this guilt WAS carried home to her mind, though she saw with satisfaction the effect of it, in her no longer avoiding Colonel Brandon when he called, in her speaking to him, even voluntarily speaking, {{with a kind of}} compassionate respect, and though she saw her spirits <b>less</b> violently <b>irritated</b> than before, she did not see her less wretched. Her mind did become settled, but it was settled in a gloomy dejection. She felt the loss of Willoughby's character yet more heavily than she had felt the loss of his heart; his seduction and desertion of Miss Williams, the misery of that poor girl, and the doubt of what his designs might ONCE have been on herself, preyed altogether so much on her spirits, that she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt even to Elinor; and, brooding over her sorrows in silence, gave more pain to her sister than could have been communicated by the most open and most frequent confession of them.|$|R
40|$|Agitation is an {{overarching}} term {{commonly used to}} describe the behaviour of elderly restless patients with dementia. The concept includes behaviour such as tension, aggression, aimless wandering, pacing, cursing, screaming, and fighting. The overall {{purpose of this study was}} to expand nursing knowledge of how to improve the psycho -social environment for agitated patients with dementia. The aims of these studies were to study, from a nursing perspective, probable reasons for expressed agitation in patients with dementia, to elucidate how integration of cognitively intact and agitated cognitively impaired patients effects perceived quality of care, to explain agitation from the nursing staff's point of view, and to investigate how dinner music and individualised music and other strategies can be used to manage agitation in these patients. The findings were applied to the progressive lowered stress threshold (PLST) model. The model suggests that anxious behaviour occurs when an individual with dementia feels stress. When the perceived stress exceeds the individual stress threshold agitation occurs. Data were collected using systematic observations of video recordings, weighing of helpings, questionnaires, interviews and rating scales. The most probable reasons for expressed agitation were need for assistance related to discomfort, a wish to meet a need immediately, reactions to environmental noise, conflicts between a patient and other individuals, and invasion of personal space. Nursing staff from hospital wards, nursing home wards, and residential homes identified integration of lucid residents and cognitively impaired agitated residents as a specific problem. Many lucid residents become annoyed at or fearful of the behaviours exhibited by cognitively impaired patients. This in turn could lead to an exacerbation of a behaviour in the residents who were already agitated. Many of the staff on two nursing home wards reported agitated patients' behaviour imposed mental strain on them. Experienced nurses suggested music, a slow pace, establishment of close contact with the patients, and avoidance of uncontrolled sounds as strategies to manage agitation in patients with dementia. During the dinner music periods, the patients ate more and became <b>less</b> <b>irritated,</b> anxious, and depressed compared to a control period. The staff members were probably also influenced by the music, as they served larger helpings when music was played. Five agitated patients were further analysed by video observations. Four of those patients spent more time over dinner when music was played. Two of them became unusually calm when dinner music was played. In an individualised case study, the music seemed to affect all four patients. Two patients became distinctly calmer during some of the music sessions. For the two other patients the noticeable effect of the music was minimal. Agitation can be seen as a stress-related form of communication related to dementia patients' diminished power to communicate. Integration of cognitively impaired person with agitated behaviours with lucid residents should, if possible, be avoided. A calm atmosphere with a slow pace on the ward is an important way to reduce the stress level on a care unit. Prerecorded music can affect individuals who suffer from dementia and can therefore be used to soothe agitated patients. Dinner music, particularly soothing music, can reduce agitation in patients with dementia. Playing prerecorded music is a simple means to alter the psychosocial environment in a care unit. If the nursing staff succeed in finding the individual's music preferences, individualised music may be a good nursing intervention to mitigate anxiety and agitation for some patients...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} Generation Y consumers' apparel retail channel preferences, perceived irritating aspects of environmental cues and the linkage of retail preferences and perceived irritability. Shopping orientations and {{questions related to}} patronage of five types of retail outlets (i. e., night markets, generic clothing stores, department stores, specialty stores, and internet) were considered in this study. Four dimensions of shopping irritants, ambient, design, crowdedness, and sales personnel, were factorized to indicate what {{likely to occur in}} local apparel retail settings. A consumer survey was administered following age and gender distribution of the population between the ages of 17 and 34. Total valid samples were 204. Apparel retail channel preferences were utilized to segment respondents into four groups, including night market shoppers, department store shoppers, internet shoppers, and non-specific channel shoppers. Results showed that night market shoppers were <b>less</b> <b>irritated</b> by ambient irritants. Internet shoppers would be irritated by untidiness at night markets as included in the design dimension. Department store shoppers would feel irritated with unsatisfactory services caused by sales personnel at night markets. Generation Y consumers with different retail preferences have distinct reactions while facing the irritating situations caused by ambient, design, and sales personnel at night markets while purchasing apparels.
