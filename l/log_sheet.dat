40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} how music teachers respond to DREAM, a virtual space for exchanging information about digital learning tools. The research determined how teachers experienced DREAM during beta testing in terms of (a) navigation, (b) search and browse functions, and (c) quality of resources. Data were collected from over 80 music teachers using focus groups, questionnaires, <b>log</b> <b>sheets,</b> and site analytics to determine if the tool met their teaching needs. Participants in the final phase of testing completed a questionnaire about professional context and skill level using computers and mobile devices and also filled out <b>log</b> <b>sheets</b> at the end of each of four testing sessions. User experiences were analyzed in terms of usefulness, efficiency, and satisfaction. With each new phase of beta testing, navigation and search mechanisms were improved and more resources were added by the participants. By the end of the study, DREAM provided a intuitive and efficient tool for a range of music teaching needs. The results of the usability study give strong support for the importance of beta testing, which ultimately led to the creation of an effective and attractive tool for studio music teachers to keep abreast about digital technologies. In a profession where many teachers experience isolation, DREAM has the potential to serve as a vital site to enable teachers to find rich digital resources to enhance their music teaching practices...|$|R

The valve is a protective type which remains open in a pipeline loading system during normal operation but shut down the system {{when there is an}} emergency such as storm. The data for the study were ob-tained from measurements at Agbada 1 flow station as well as <b>log</b> <b>sheets.</b> Also, calculations were made using existing and derived formulas to obtain the values of Crude Oil and Pipe parameters that could not be measured directly or derived from data or <b>log</b> <b>sheets.</b> Surge analysis was carried out on the pipeline system to ascertain changes in pressure and flow rates along the pipeline fol-lowing valve shut down at any time using developed pressure and flow equations. The results of the simulation analysis showed remarkable changes in the fluid pressure and flow rates along the pipe on shut down at any time. The pipeline recorded the highest pressure of 37. 4 bar against ini-tial pressure of 25 bar at length 6000 m in 1. 5 second valve closure. There is also remarkable pressure drop along the pipe capable of reducing the crude oil pressure below its vapour pressure. The flow is turbulent even before valve operation with Reynolds number as high as 57024. 53. The model equations compute changes in pressure and flow rates at different points in a pipeline in...|$|R
