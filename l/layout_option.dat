40|$|Construction {{site layout}} {{decisions}} affect the effort involved in materials handling, an activity which occupies {{a substantial portion}} of working time. Much computer software has been developed enabling construction managers to plan and visualize the layout of a construction site, but at present the lack of an accepted practical technique for evaluating the efficiency of a chosen site layout makes it difficult to choose objectively between possibilities, in the search for a better layout design. The research described in this paper explores the practicability of an evaluation procedure intended to help improve this situation, and effectively describes the use of a quantitative material flow network model as the basis for evaluating the efficiency of a given site <b>layout</b> <b>option.</b> The evaluation measure, 'total material flow time', is calculated as part of an evaluation procedure.

40|$|In the low-lying {{coastal regions}} coastal defense {{structures}} are usually designed with a main function {{to protect the}} hinterland from highly vulnerable of sea flooding. Sea dikes are usually {{the most common and}} important elements which form the coastal flood defense system. Sea dikes are designed at a pre-defined circumstance and requirement. For instance, dikes are designed where no overtopping, some overtopping or large overtopping water is allowed. The most interesting issues at the preliminary design stages of a sea dike are its height, layout and associated overtopping discharge criteria. There have been many discussions on whether sea dikes should be designed high enough to not allow any overtopping water or using relatively low but “strong” dikes in order to allow from some to large overtopping water. Recently, the ComCoast 1 project develops and demonstrates innovative solutions for flood protection in coastal areas. In which different types of dike cross section and layouts of defensive system were proposed. Concepts of defensive zones are presented beside the already existing concept of defensive lines. However, within the ComCoast project, attentions are paid mainly to developments of the innovated concepts rather than focusing on comparison of the proposed system with the conventional sea defenses. Thus, there is still lack of guidance and comparative tools to determine the best choice amongst the conventional or innovated options in decision making process. This study focuses on development of the comparative framework and generic guidance to support the decision making process in selection of the best suitable <b>layout</b> <b>option</b> of the sea dike system for a given location. Based on overtopping criteria two situations are considered for the analysis: (i) using one defensive line; (ii) using two defensive lines (defense zone). The multi-criteria analysis (which takes social, economic, environment and technical aspects into account) and the cost-benefit analysis are used in the selection of the best option. Finally application is made for several case studies of coastal flood defense in Vietnam. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|The {{receiving}} warehouse at Diablo Canyon Power Plant, {{owned by}} Pacific Gas and Electric, {{serves as a}} place to recognize the receiving of items into an ERP system, repackage and label items for long-term storage, and organize items for delivery inside the secured area. The warehouse managers would like to redesign the layout and procedures of the warehouse. Currently items are not received, scanned, or shipped in a timely manner. The flow of people and items in the receiving and shipping area is chaotic and space is limited especially during plant outages. The objective of this project is to: • Redesign the current layout to promote flow of items and people and better utilize space. • Create work procedures that standardize processes and save time. • Calculate costs and benefits of proposed solutions. • Suggest ways to implement the solutions. The objectives of the project were met by following the facility design methodology of: 1. Define the problem. 2. Make observations to understand the environment. 3. Collect data. 4. Design alternatives. 5. Evaluate and select alternatives. 11 solutions were found relating to changes in the areas of workstation and layout design, loading and unloading delivery trucks, and employee training and priorities. 3 larger scope options for implementing layout changes were proposed: No Changes, Slight Modifications, and New Layout. The Slight Modifications option suggests combining label printers, computers, and work table space to make one workstation area and moving the current item being received as close to the workstation as possible. The New <b>Layout</b> <b>option</b> suggests implementing moveable workstations on carts and keeping an item in one location between the receiving and security screening processes. Both options reduce travel time for material handlers. Option Slight Modification increased space utilization by 8 %, decreased average travel distance by 154 feet per item, and costs $ 6, 960. Option New Layout increased space utilization by 21 %, decreased average travel distance by 148 feet per item, and costs $ 28, 275. Because of the lower costs and apparent greater decrease of travel distance, Solution Slight Modifications was suggested. The net present value of the project option is $ 6, 500 with a payback period of 3. 89 years. Diablo Canyon was recommended to phase in the changes of Slight Modifications, focusing on the changes that could be implemented without making layout changes. It was also suggested to do further and more accurate analysis on implementation costs and reduced travel time for both option...|$|E

40|$|The paper studies a {{comparative}} evaluation method for the modular cutting tools dynamic properties under the cutting forces loading {{with the help}} of the finite element numerical method. The method allows forecasting the modular cutting tool dynamic properties with identification of the confidence bounds for its exploitation in compliance with its intended use and reference operating conditions. The conducted modeling describes the modular cutting tool structure as a ranked set of structural components, such as a frame, a cassette, a cutting insert, etc., oriented towards a certain direction with some surfaces being contiguous and thus making contact interactions. The analytical model is represented by a multi-mass system in the form of elastic rods connected at elastic and damping joints. The research examined different tool structural component <b>layout</b> <b>options,</b> including those equipped/not equipped with a shim, having a radial/tangential (face or peripheral) location type of cutting components.

40|$|Projecte final de carrera relaitzat en col. laboració amb Institute of High Frequency Technology (IHF) The {{purpose of}} this master thesis was to {{determine}} the fundamental design features of the subsystems that conform a Compact Antenna and RCS Test Range. The major part of this work focused on evaluation and investigation regarding the RF Instrumentation subsystem possibilities of the future measurement range. Since one of the parameters that have more impact on the performance of the future range is the Measurement Dynamic Range, e. g. {{in order to deal with}} sidelobesupression generated in this kind of ranges, the goal of the project focused on conceiving a procedure to obtain a reliable Dynamic Range estimation once the antenna range instrumentation characteristics are known. In addition, comparisons of different RF instrumentation <b>layout</b> <b>options</b> are presented, including not only performance in terms of Dynamic Range; but also in terms of optimal settings for each component configuring the RF Instrumentation subsystem.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 96 - 97 Graphs are data models, {{widely used}} in many areas from networking to biology to computer science. Visualization, interactive editing ability and layout of graphs are critical issues when analyzing the underlying relational information. There are many commercial and non-commercial graph visualization tools. However, overall support for compound or hierarchically organized graph representations is very limited. We introduce a new open-source editing and layout framework named Chisio for compound graphs. Chisio is developed as a free, easy-to-use and powerful academic graph visualization tool, supporting various automatic layout algorithms. It is written in Java and based on Eclipse’s Graphical Editing Framework (GEF). Chisio {{can be used as}} a finished generic compound graph editor with standard graph editing facilities such as zoom, scroll, add or remove graph objects, move, and resize. Object property and <b>layout</b> <b>options</b> dialogs are provided to modify existing graph object properties and <b>layout</b> <b>options,</b> respectively. In addition, printing or saving the current drawing as a static image and persistent storage facilities are supported. Saved graphs or GraphML formatted files created by other tools can be loaded into Chisio. Furthermore, a highlight mechanism is provided to emphasize subgraphs of users interest. The framework has an architecture suitable for easy customization of the tool for end-users’ specific needs as well. Also Chisio offers several layout styles from the basic spring embedder to hierarchical layout to compound spring embedder to circular layout. Furthermore, new algorithms are straightforward to add, making Chisio an ideal test environment for layout algorithm developers. Küçükkeçeci, CihanM. S...|$|R
