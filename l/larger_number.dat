The biggest factor in the increased number of ER patients was insufficient primary care providers to handle the <b>larger</b> <b>number</b> of insured patients.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, {{the number}} of {{supporters}} had surpassed 20,000 and by lending money to the club, Barça was able to build the larger Camp de Les Corts, which had an initial capacity of 20,000 spectators. After the Spanish Civil War the club started attracting more members and a <b>larger</b> <b>number</b> of spectators at matches. This led to several expansion projects: the grandstand in 1944, the southern stand in 1946, and finally the northern stand in 1950. After the last expansion, Les Corts could hold 60,000 spectators.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{develops}} a general {{framework for the}} formulation of generic uniform laws of <b>large</b> <b>numbers.</b> In particular, we introduce a basic generic uniform law of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> that contains recent uniform laws of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> by Andrews [2] and Hoadley [7 J as special cases. We also develop a truncation approach. {{that makes it possible}} to obtain uniform laws of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> for the functions under consideration from uniform laws of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> for truncated versions of those functions. The point of the truncation approach is that uniform laws of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> for the truncated versions are typically easier to obtain. By combining the basic uniform law of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> and the truncation approach we also derive generalizations of recent uniform laws of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> introduced in Potscher and Prucha [13, l 5]. ...|$|R

Factors included increased premiums, higher drug costs, ACA and aging workers. Some firms lowered costs by increasing cost-sharing (for higher employee contributions, deductibles and co-payments). 60% planned to further increase cost-sharing. Coverage and benefits were not expected to change. Approximately one fifth said ACA had pushed them to reduce their workforce. A <b>larger</b> <b>number</b> said they were raising prices.|$|E

Author David Topliss attributes this to political necessity, as he believed the Minister of the Navy could not validate purchasing a seemingly less-powerful dreadnought than the Minas Geraes class: with larger guns ruled out, the only remaining choice was a <b>larger</b> <b>number</b> of guns.|$|E

5|$|Epidemiological {{studies of}} {{serotonin}} syndrome are difficult as many physicians {{are unaware of}} the diagnosis or they may miss the syndrome due to its variable manifestations. In 1998 a survey conducted in England found that 85% of the general practitioners that had prescribed the antidepressant nefazodone were unaware of serotonin syndrome. The incidence may be increasing as a <b>larger</b> <b>number</b> of pro-serotonergic drugs (drugs which increase serotonin levels) are now being used in clinical practice. One postmarketing surveillance study identified an incidence of 0.4 cases per 1000 patient-months for patients who were taking nefazodone.
