5|$|In 1922, {{the number}} of {{supporters}} had surpassed 20,000 and by lending money to the club, Bar√ßa was able to build the larger Camp de Les Corts, which had an initial capacity of 20,000 spectators. After the Spanish Civil War the club started attracting more members and a <b>larger</b> <b>number</b> of spectators at matches. This led to several expansion projects: the grandstand in 1944, the southern stand in 1946, and finally the northern stand in 1950. After the last expansion, Les Corts could hold 60,000 spectators.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{develops}} a general {{framework for the}} formulation of generic uniform laws of <b>large</b> <b>numbers.</b> In particular, we introduce a basic generic uniform law of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> that contains recent uniform laws of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> by Andrews [2] and Hoadley [7 J as special cases. We also develop a truncation approach. {{that makes it possible}} to obtain uniform laws of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> for the functions under consideration from uniform laws of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> for truncated versions of those functions. The point of the truncation approach is that uniform laws of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> for the truncated versions are typically easier to obtain. By combining the basic uniform law of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> and the truncation approach we also derive generalizations of recent uniform laws of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> introduced in Potscher and Prucha [13, l 5]. ...|$|R

Some firms lowered costs by increasing cost-sharing (for higher employee contributions, deductibles and co-payments). 60% planned to further increase cost-sharing. Coverage and benefits were not expected to change. Approximately one fifth said ACA had pushed them to reduce their workforce. A <b>larger</b> <b>number</b> said they were raising prices.|$|E

Author David Topliss attributes this to political necessity, as he believed the Minister of the Navy could not validate purchasing a seemingly less-powerful dreadnought than the Minas Geraes class: with larger guns ruled out, the only remaining choice was a <b>larger</b> <b>number</b> of guns.|$|E

5|$|Epidemiological {{studies of}} {{serotonin}} syndrome are difficult as many physicians {{are unaware of}} the diagnosis or they may miss the syndrome due to its variable manifestations. In 1998 a survey conducted in England found that 85% of the general practitioners that had prescribed the antidepressant nefazodone were unaware of serotonin syndrome. The incidence may be increasing as a <b>larger</b> <b>number</b> of pro-serotonergic drugs (drugs which increase serotonin levels) are now being used in clinical practice. One postmarketing surveillance study identified an incidence of 0.4 cases per 1000 patient-months for patients who were taking nefazodone.
