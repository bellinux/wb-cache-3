40|$|This chapter {{takes as}} its {{starting}} point the insights {{provided by a}} number of authors (Bhatia 1993, 2002, 2004; Bhatia / Candlin / Engsberg / Trosborg 2003; Bhatia / Gotti 2006; Candlin / Bhatia / Jensen 2002; Drew / Heritage 1992; Garzone 2003; Goodrich 1988; Gotti 2003; Maley 1994; Swales 1990, 1996, 2004; Tessuto 2003) to examine discourse and professional practices in employment tribunals first in a national and then in an international context. With a view to investigating legal discourse in different legal systems, the chapter examines the institutional constraints on discourse processes in employment cases at Employment Tribunals in the UK, the European Union Civil Service Tribunal in Luxembourg, and the International Labour Organization Administrative Tribunal (ILOAT) in Geneva. Although in all cases the pragmatic function is the presentation of complaints by employees against their employers for the purpose of obtaining compensation or reinstatement, the procedural rules shaping the discourse are strikingly different, with consequent variation in generic structure and lexical content. In examining the institutional procedures and case materials, it is argued that Employment Tribunals in the UK, standing firmly in the common law tradition, provide for courtroom hearings in which the parties present their evidence orally, following the classic sequence of examination-in-chief and cross-examination. On the other hand, at the European Union Civil Service Tribunal (where cases may be heard in any of the 23 official languages of the EU, depending on the language of the application) and at the ILOAT, the proceedings (in English or French) bear a stronger resemblance to the civil law tradition, with most or all of the discourse taking the form <b>of</b> <b>written</b> <b>pleadings.</b> The jurisdiction <b>of</b> the EU Civil Service Tribunal is supranational, and that of the ILOAT international, dealing with complaints lodged by staff members respectively of EU and UN organizations. In the case of the European Union Civil Service Tribunal, <b>written</b> <b>pleadings</b> may be accompanied by hearings. However, {{in the case of the}} ILOAT, the holding of courtroom hearings would require the parties to travel from all over the world. Partly due to this constraint, the discourse is structured in an entirely different manner compared to the national tribunal, with claims presented and argumentation constructed almost exclusively on the basis <b>of</b> <b>written</b> documents, in a genre chain (Fairclough 2003 : 31) consisting of the complaint, the defendant’s reply, the complainant’s rejoinder, the defendant’s surrejoinder, and finally the judgment. This enables the ILOAT to deal with cases entirely on the basis <b>of</b> <b>written</b> <b>pleadings,</b> with applications for hearings seldom allowed. An examination of the terminology in English in the three Tribunals, one national, one supranational, and one international, reflects significant divergences in legal cultures, as the parties seek to construct and interpret meanings while complying with the institutional constraints prevailing in each of the systems...|$|R

Nevertheless, behavioural and neurophysiological data have demonstrated that word features and semantic sentence context influence linguistic processes already within the first 200 ms following {{the onset of the}} critical word stimulus. The lack of early word-related ERP effects in some studies might be due to large stimulus variance on relevant linguistic parameters, for example the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>written</b> words or their frequency of usage. Here we investigated the effect <b>of</b> the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> words, their standardized lexical frequency and probability to occur in a given semantic context, by orthogonally varying these factors in a sentence-reading task. We found word frequency and probability to be reflected neurophysiologically already at 120 and 180 ms after written word onset. However, at these early stages frequency and probability effects were modulated by word length, as documented by significant interactions, whereas at later stages, around 300 - 500 ms, additive effects of these variables were found. These results indicate that semantic context integration may take place at a surprisingly early stage and near-simultaneously with the processing of information about the form of a word and its lexical properties, therefore challenging serial models of psycholinguistic information access. A methodological implication of this study is that, in order to obtain early psycholinguistic ERP effects, stimulus variance must be kept to a minimum...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} student performance under two different writing-assessment conditions {{to determine whether}} students who receive different types <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> instruction are affected by assessment conditions that differ from instructional conditions. The study grew out of concerns that writing-process students, when compared to traditional (non-process) writing students, are placed at a disadvantage in standardized, timed writing assessments that do not allow students time to engage fully in the writing process. ^ Specific variables in the study are the effect of time and instruction on the amount and quality <b>of</b> <b>writing,</b> amount and type of prewriting, and attitudes of students in large-scale, standardized, writing-assessment situations. Subjects {{in the study were}} 349 eighth-graders from four similar middle schools in Indiana.

As seen from research survey studies, the traditional textbook approach had little, if any, effect on language development. A program that would allow the student to build outward from his own experience and language background was, therefore, explored in this study. A thorough review of the literature revealed that there exists a definite progression in the syntactic development of children. It was seen that this syntactic maturity may be effectively enhanced through special treatment. Methods for analyzing syntactic growth were investigated, and T-unit length proved to be a viable indicator of such growth. From the studies reviewed, the use of literature, in combination with language explorations that emphasized sentence expansion and transformation, appeared to be a highly successful approach to language instruction. Against this background, two comparable third grade classrooms worked for a six month period in differing approaches to English instruction. The control group used a traditional textbook approach. The experimental group, however, became involved with a literature based program that was inner directed. The growth in syntactic maturity was measured by the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>written</b> T-units in the assigned composition tasks. Through the use of the t test, it became apparent that the experimental group had made significant gains in syntactic maturity when compared to the control group. The findings appeared to indicate that this significance was due to the experimental factor. It was found that an English program that employs literature as a basis allows for definite enhancement of children's syntactic maturity...|$|R
