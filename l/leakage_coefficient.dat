40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{two methods}} are {{proposed}} {{to assess the}} efficiency of {{carbon capture and storage}} (CCS) involving back-leakage of CO 2 from geological storage reservoirs to the atmosphere. The first method is a physical approach based on radiative forcing. It leads to a criterion that assesses whether a given technology of CCS is physically beneficial compared to a reference technology without CCS. The second method is an economic approach based on the classical framework of net present value (NPV). It leads to an economic feasibility condition that assesses whether a given CCS technology is economically beneficial compared to a reference technology. The two models are compared with respect to their parametric dependence. In particular, a maximum leakage rate may be defined, above which neither of the feasibility criteria is satisfied. The two approaches are also discussed with respect to the type of decision they may generate. Under general assumptions, the economic criterion is stricter than the physical criterion when the <b>leakage</b> <b>coefficient</b> is small, and the opposite is true when the <b>leakage</b> <b>coefficient</b> is large...|$|E

40|$|Clogging {{refers to}} a {{reduction}} of riverbed hydraulic conductivity. Due to difficulties in determining {{the thickness of the}} clogging layer, the <b>leakage</b> <b>coefficient</b> (L) is introduced and used to quantify the recoverable portion of bank filtrate. L was determined at several riverbank filtration (RBF) sites in field tests and using an analytical solution. Results were compared with data from similar experiments in the early 1970 s and 1991 – 1993. In the 1980 s, severe river water pollution in conjunction with high water abstraction led to partly unsaturated conditions beneath the riverbed. A <b>leakage</b> <b>coefficient</b> L of 5 × 10 − 7 s− 1 was determined. After water quality improvement, L increased to 1 – 1. 5 × 10 − 6 s− 1.

40|$|Stream-aquifer {{interactions}} are influenced significantly by riverbed clogging processes. Detailed field observations {{have been made}} in the “Freudenau reservoir ” of the Danube at Vienna. Different types of clogged layers have been observed. Multi-level-piezometers below the riverbed indicate that the over-all clogging process consists of several clogging cycles of a few weeks each initiated by floods until a stable state is reached. Minor flood events cause a temporary increase in the <b>leakage</b> <b>coefficient</b> follow-ed by a new decrease approaching the original level after a few weeks. Major flood events tended to add a sediment layer which re-initiated the clogging process leading over to a lower level of the <b>leakage</b> <b>coefficient.</b> The computation of the water balance of the two reservoirs of the New Danube indicated a reduction of the seepage rate by about 40 % to 60 % over a period of 4. 5 years.

Comparison of the seals shows the Knurled-pattern stator to be the stiffest and the round-hole pattern stator to yield the largest net damping and the least leakage.

40|$|Urban {{groundwater}} {{is frequently}} contaminated, and {{the exact location}} of the pollution spots is often unknown. Intelligent monitoring of the temporal variations in groundwater flow in such an area assists in selectively extracting groundwater of drinking water quality. Here an example from the city of Zurich (Switzerland) is shown. The monitoring strategy consists of using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for optimally combining online observations and online models for the real-time characterization of groundwater flow. We conducted numerical simulation experiments for the period January 2004 to December 2007 with a 3 -D finite element model for variably saturated groundwater flow. It was found that the daily assimilation of piezometric head data with EnKF results in a better characterization of piezometric heads than does a model which is inversely calibrated with historical data but not updated in real time. The positive impact of model updating with observations can still be observed 10 days after the update. These simulations also suggest that parameters (hydraulic conductivity and leakage) are successfully updated: 1 and 10 day piezometric head predictions are better with than without updating of parameters. Additional experiments with a synthetic model for the same site, in which {{the only difference is that}} certain parameter values are selected as the unknown "true" conditions, show that EnKF also successfully updates unknown parameters. However, this is only the case if spatially distributed hydraulic conductivities and <b>leakage</b> <b>coefficients</b> are jointly updated and if a damping parameter is used. The mean absolute error of estimated log <b>leakage</b> <b>coefficients</b> decreased by up to 63 %; for log hydraulic conductivity a decrease of up to 27 % was observed.

Historically little had been known about the groundwater resource of the Cannington gravel aquifer other than that is had become increasingly utilised for irrigation from the year 2000 onwards. During 2011, Environment Canterbury undertook aquifer testing on three wells [J 39 / 0669 (139. 8 m deep), J 39 / 0887 (146 m deep) and J 39 / 0888 (84 m deep) ] screened in the Cannington marine/beach gravel aquifer in the Pareora Valley, to provide us with {{a better understanding of the}} way the groundwater system behaves. Aquifer testing provides information on well performance and is used to model how an aquifer responds to groundwater pumping. Increasing competition for groundwater means such testing is generally regarded as a requirement for resource consent applications.

40|$|A {{combined}} analytical-computational {{method has}} been developed to calculate the pressure field and dynamic coefficients for tapered high-pressure annular seals. Completely developed turbulent flow is assumed in both the circumferential and axial directions, according to Hirs' (1973) bulk-flow turbulent-lubrication equations. In a numerical experiment with the method, a short bearing approximation is used to derive an analytical expression for the first-order (dynamic) pressure gradient. This expression is integrated numerically to define dynamic coefficients of the seal. Numerical results of the integration are compared with previous results for straight and tapered seals. It is found that direct stiffness and <b>leakage</b> <b>coefficients</b> increase in the present seal, while the remaining coefficients decrease.

40|$|Abstract- The {{energy of}} wind can be {{transferred}} to the generator either by direct connection through a gearbox or by employing an intermediate medium such as hydraulic fluid. Gearless hydraulic wind power transfer systems are considered noble candidates to transfer wind energy to generators since they can collect the energy of multiple wind turbines in one generation unit.
