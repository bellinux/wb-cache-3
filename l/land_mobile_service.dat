50|$|Land {{mobile station}} (or {{land mobile radio}} station) is a mobile radio station in the <b>land</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> that {{operates}} within a country or continent.|$|E
50|$|<b>Land</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> (short: LMS) is - {{in line to}} ITU Radio Regulations - {{a mobile}} service between base {{stations}} and land mobile stations, or between land mobile stations.|$|E
50|$|Some {{services}} are a sub-set of another service. For example, the <b>land</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> {{can be thought}} of as a branch of the mobile service which encompasses the land, maritime and aeronautical mobile services. For many terrestrial radiocommunication communication services, there is a parallel space radiocommunication service e.g., the broadcasting service and the broadcasting-satellite service.|$|E

50|$|Collinear array - a {{broadside}} array consisting of multiple identical dipole antennas oriented vertically in a line. This {{is a high}} gain omnidirectional antenna, often used in the VHF band as base station antennas for <b>land</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>services.</b>|$|R
50|$|Section III of Article 1 of the ITU Radio Regulations {{sets out}} the {{definitions}} of some 40 radio services including such services as the fixed service, the mobile service, the <b>land</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>service,</b> the broadcasting service, the standard frequency and time signal service {{as well as the}} definition of radio astronomy which is defined as “a service involving the use of radio astronomy”. Note that the radio astronomy service is not a radiocommunication service but simply a service involving the use of radio astronomy.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, United Parcel Service (UPS) began {{lobbying}} the FCC to reallocate {{part of the}} 1.25-meter band to the <b>Land</b> <b>Mobile</b> <b>Service.</b> UPS had publicized {{plans to use the}} band to develop a narrow-bandwidth wireless voice and data network using a mode called ACSSB (amplitude-companded single sideband). UPS's main argument for the reallocation was that amateur use of the band was very sparse and that the public interest would be better served by reallocating part of the band to a service that would put it to good use.|$|E
50|$|Further sub-sets of some {{of these}} internationally defined {{services}} are often created at the national level. For example, within the <b>land</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>service,</b> a country may choose to define such services as paging, dispatch two-way radio service, cellular mobile telephone service, trunked mobile radio service, etc. Many of these definitions are based upon the nature of the service being provided rather than the international concept of a radiocommunication service. In other words, the term “service” can be used in these two different ways. No matter what definitions are adopted in a given country, with some specific exceptions which are allowed for in the ITU RRs, the use of the spectrum must fit in with the international definitions of radio services.|$|E
40|$|The {{similarities}} and differences between areas inside and outside U. S. metropolitan areas were evaluated in terms of their commercial/industrial and government employment characteristics. The comparison focuses on the levels, shares, and composition of employment in the commercial/industrial and government sectors that represent potential classes of <b>land</b> <b>mobile</b> communications users. The major findings of the analysis are as follows: (1) non-metropolitan commercial/industrial user classes of <b>land</b> <b>mobile</b> communication <b>services</b> exist in significant numbers; (2) the compositions of non-metropolitan and metropolitan commercial/industrial user classes of <b>land</b> <b>mobile</b> communication <b>services</b> closely resemble each other; (3) non-metropolitan areas have significant levels of the government user classes that represent potential markets for <b>land</b> <b>mobile</b> communication services; and (4) non-metropolitan local governments have a significantly larger proportion of their employment in the primary user classes of private <b>land</b> <b>mobile</b> radio <b>service</b> than do metropolitan local governments...|$|R

50|$|By then-current Mexican law, XHUAA was {{suggested}} to start broadcasting digital television by January 1, 2010, although this station was allowed {{at its discretion}} to start broadcasting DTV before law required it to, and XHUAA-TDT had signed on in 2006. The original assignment was channel 20, but the chosen channel caused issues to <b>land</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>services</b> in Los Angeles, prompting the FCC in the United States to request a channel change.|$|R
40|$|Increased {{demand of}} {{consumers}} on {{services in the}} mobile environment with high data rate and technologically developed mobile broadband communication systems (IMT) will require more spectrum to {{be available in the}} future. The new technologies as well as the existing services require frequencies for their development. The 694 - 790 MHz (700 MHz) band was allocated by World Radiocommunication Conference 2012 (WRC- 12) in ITU Region 1, which includes also Europe, to the mobile service on a co-primary basis with other services to which this band is allocated on a primary basis (broadcasting etc.) and was identified for IMT. The allocation is effective immediately after WRC- 15. 700 MHz band can be putted into use for <b>land</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> only when all necessary electromagnetic compatibility, frequency sharing studies are completed and technical conditions of use of frequencies determined. In the framework of the research a particular attention will be paid to the evaluation of perspective use of the 700 MHz band by <b>land</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>service</b> in Latvia...|$|E

50|$|The {{predecessor}} to GMRS {{was named}} Class A Citizens Radio Service {{when it was}} rolled out in the 1960s. Tube type transceivers were used, and transmitter power was limited to 60 watts (plate input power to the final amplifier tube). The original service ran wideband FM with ±15 kHz transmitter deviation and 50 kHz channel spacing. At the time, this was the norm for all U.S. <b>land</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>services.</b> There was also a Class B Citizens Radio Service which used {{a different set of}} 461 MHz channels and was limited to 5 watts output. Business users were permitted to license in this radio service. Radios were built by consumer electronics firms and commercial two-way radio vendors.|$|R
