5|$|In 1895 Hebrew {{linguist}} {{and publisher}} Rabbi Chaim Hirschensohn became entangled in a failed effort {{to purchase the}} Western Wall and lost all his assets. Even the attempts of the Palestine <b>Land</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Company</b> to purchase the environs of the Western Wall for the Jews just before the outbreak of World War I never came to fruition. In {{the first two months}} following the Ottoman Empire’s entry into the First World War, the Turkish governor of Jerusalem, Zakey Bey, offered to sell the Moroccan Quarter, which consisted of about 25 houses, to the Jews in order to enlarge the area available to them for prayer. He requested a sum of £20,000 which would be used to both rehouse the Muslim families and to create a public garden in front of the Wall. However, the Jews of the city lacked the necessary funds. A few months later, under Muslim Arab pressure on the Turkish authorities in Jerusalem, Jews became forbidden by official decree to place benches and light candles at the Wall. This sour turn in relations was taken up by the Chacham Bashi who managed to get the ban overturned. In 1915 it was reported that Djemal Pasha closed off the wall to visitation as a sanitary measure.|$|E
5|$|In late 1927, Quwatli {{headed the}} Istiqlal-dominated Executive Committee of the Syrian-Palestinian Congress, {{although}} Lutfallah headed a separate rival committee that also called itself the Congress's Executive Committee. Both were based in Cairo. In 1930, Quwatli {{was allowed to}} return to Syria under a general amnesty. Thereafter, he joined the National Bloc, the preeminent opposition movement in Syria—though tolerated by the French. Although he opposed the moderate stances of the Bloc's Damascene leaders, he determined he could only remain a major political player by joining the group. He sought to steer it towards a more determined nationalist course and worked to expand his support base, relying on his relationships with residents in some of Damascus' traditionally nationalist neighborhoods (al-Midan and al-Shaghour) and among the city's merchant and emerging industrialist classes. He also worked to draw support from the staunch pan-Arabists of the League of National Action (LNA) beginning in 1933. He managed to co-opt much of the LNA's members by 1935–36 by financing its <b>land</b> <b>development</b> <b>company</b> (which aimed to prevent land sales to Zionist organizations in Palestine) and assigning some of its leaders to the director boards of companies affiliated with the Bloc.|$|E

50|$|The area to {{the south}} of Main Avenue was {{developed}} by an organisation called the Edlington Co-operative Tenants Ltd. This purchased the 10.837 acre of land, which eventually supported 200 houses, from the <b>Land</b> and <b>Development</b> <b>Company</b> in October 1914. However, it appears that this organisation was essentially the <b>Land</b> and <b>Development</b> <b>Company</b> in another guise, as the membership of its board was identical with that of the <b>Land</b> and <b>Development</b> <b>Company.</b> This may have been done {{to make it easier to}} obtain the mortgage funds necessary to build the houses.|$|R
25|$|Interest {{in the new}} {{subdivision}} was immediate, and in 1917, the Rosedale Park <b>Land</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Company</b> platted {{an addition}} to the original area. However, the actual construction in the neighborhood was slow—from 1917 {{until the end of}} World War I, only 15 houses had been constructed. However, construction soon blossomed, and in 1921 a third addition was platted. The city of Detroit annexed the subdivision in 1926, bringing water and sewer to the neighborhood and making the area more attractive.|$|E
25|$|The land {{on which}} Rosedale Park sits was {{originally}} deeded in 1835 to Otis C. Freeman and George Bellamy as two 80-acre (32 ha) parcels. Over time, these parcels were subdivided until in 1916 the Rosedale Park <b>Land</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Company</b> purchased and platted {{a large portion of}} what was to become the Rosedale Park Historic District. This development company platted other projects in addition to Rosedale Park, most notably the North Rosedale Park neighborhood directly across Grand River Avenue. The company considered the location amenable to development because of its proximity to Grand River Avenue, a direct link to downtown Detroit, and the contemporaneous construction of Outer Drive.|$|E
