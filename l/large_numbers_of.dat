5|$|In 1913, {{a second}} much larger mission hall was opened nearby, named the Walsham-How Mission Hall after William Walsham How, {{leader of the}} Shropshire Mission to East London. The Shropshire Hall, built by the Shropshire Mission in Gladstone Avenue, is now the Noel Park Children's Centre. Noel Park's {{relative}} geographic isolation {{led to the formation}} of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> clubs and societies using the two mission halls for a wide range of activities, including <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> sporting societies.|$|E

5|$|Active {{resistance}} in Belgium {{took the form}} of sabotaging railways and lines of communication as well as hiding Jews and Allied airmen. The resistance produced <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> illegal newspapers in both French and Dutch, distributed to the public to provide news about the war not available in officially approved, censored newspapers. Some such publications achieved considerable success, such as La Libre Belgique, which reached a circulation of 70,000. Attacks on German soldiers were comparatively rare as the German administration made a practice of executing at least five Belgian hostages for each German soldier killed. At great personal risk, Belgian civilians also hid <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> Jews and political dissenters hunted by the Germans.|$|E
5|$|After the Revolution, {{the village}} of Pittsburgh {{continued}} to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building. Flatboats could used to carry <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> pioneers and goods downriver, while keelboats were capable of traveling upriver.|$|E

5|$|In {{the decades}} {{following}} the war, <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> public memorials were erected {{around the country}} in memory of Belgian soldiers who had died fighting for the Allied cause during the conflict. There are numerous monuments and streets dedicated to Allied politicians and generals, including Franklin Roosevelt and Bernard Montgomery in Brussels. The <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> British and American cemeteries and memorials, particularly in the Ardennes region associated with the Battle of the Bulge, meant that the legacy of the war was very visible.|$|E
5|$|Isotopes such as lithium-6, {{as well as}} some {{beryllium}} and boron {{are generated}} in space through cosmic ray spallation. This occurs when a high-energy proton strikes an atomic nucleus, causing <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> nucleons to be ejected.|$|E

5|$|The English {{enjoyed a}} marked superiority over the Scots in cavalry, {{particularly}} with the resurgence of heavy cavalry with their use of demi-lancers. The feudal heavy cavalry had begun to disappear from Scottish armies after Bannockburn in 1314. It was limited by the shortage of suitable horses. James V imported great horses and mares from Denmark {{in an attempt to}} improve the quality of Scottish breading stock. In the mid-sixteenth century the Scots still lacked sufficient heavy cavalry. In their place they fielded relatively <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> light horse, often drawn from the Borders and usually wearing jacks of leather or mail, mounted on small horses and using light lances. As firearms became available they began to field relatively <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> mounted arquebusiers.|$|E
