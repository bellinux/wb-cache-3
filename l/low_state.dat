5|$|World War II {{resulted}} in a dramatic increase of sponsored research, with the 1943–1944 budget being the first in which industry and government contracts exceeded the EES's other income (most notably, its state appropriation). Vaughan had initially prepared the faculty for fewer incoming contracts as the state had cut the station's appropriation by 40 percent, but increased support from industry and government eventually counteracted <b>low</b> <b>state</b> support. The electronics and communications research that Directors Gerald Rosselot and James E. Boyd attracted is still a mainstay of GTRI research.

Nürnberg saw no action during this period. On 27 April 1943, Nürnberg left Narvik for German waters via Trondheim. After arriving in Kiel on 3 May, she had her machinery overhauled.

Commanded by Major Arieh Ben-Or, {{there were}} 44 aircraft and 42 pilots on hand on the morning of June 5, when Israel launched Operation Focus, the strike that started the war. While the Fougas were initially slated to participate in attacks on the Egyptian air bases at El Arish and Jabl Libni, their light armament and lack of effective combat range led to their reassignment to the deception, interdiction and close air support roles. Thus, while the majority of IAF combat aircraft were en route to their respective targets in Egypt and the Sinai, 147 Squadron Fougas took to the air flying seemingly routine training missions and generating seemingly routine radio traffic to give the impression that Israel was on a <b>low</b> <b>state</b> of alert. Other Fougas, however, were making their way to attack Egyptian troop concentrations along the front in support of the Israeli push into the Sinai.

John Blair {{described}} Æthelstan's achievement as [...] "a determined reconstruction, visible to us especially through the circulation and production of books, of the shattered ecclesiastical culture". He was renowned in his own day for his piety and promotion of sacred learning. His interest in education, and his reputation as a collector of books and relics, attracted a cosmopolitan group of ecclesiastical scholars to his court, particularly Bretons and Irish. Æthelstan gave extensive aid to Breton clergy who had fled Brittany following its conquest by the Vikings in 919. He made a confraternity agreement with the clergy of Dol Cathedral in Brittany, who were then in exile in central France, and they sent him the relics of Breton saints, apparently hoping for his patronage. The contacts resulted in a surge in interest in England for commemorating Breton saints. One of the most notable scholars at Æthelstan's court was Israel the Grammarian, who may have been a Breton. Israel and [...] "a certain Frank" [...] drew a board game called [...] "Gospel Dice" [...] for an Irish bishop, Dub Innse, who took it home to Bangor.

The absence of outbursts during such intermediate (as opposed to <b>low)</b> <b>states,</b> which last much longer than typical disc's viscous times, can be explained only if accretion discs are absent when their temperatures would correspond to an unstable state.

He scrambled ashore when the boat was smashed on the rocks. All eight crew members were awarded bronze medals.

Methods: We analyzed spiking and local field potential (LFP) activity of hippocampal CA 1 region alongside neocortical electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) in 19 sessions from four male Long-Evans rats (260 – 360 g) during natural wake/sleep across the 24 -hr cycle as well as data from other brain regions obtained from [URL] Results: <b>LOW</b> <b>states</b> lasted longer than OFF/DOWN states and were distinguished by a subset of “LOW-active” cells. LOW activity sleep was preceded and followed by increased sharp-wave ripple activity. We also observed decreased slow-wave activity and sleep spindles in the hippocampal LFP and neocortical EEG upon LOW onset, with a partial rebound immediately after <b>LOW.</b> <b>LOW</b> <b>states</b> demonstrated activity patterns consistent with sleep but frequently transitioned into microarousals and showed EMG and LFP differences from small-amplitude irregular activity during quiet waking.
