40|$|High {{incidence}} of injuries {{caused by the}} manual handling of heavy idler rollers {{is a major concern}} for the Australian mining industry. Consequently, major mining industry stakeholders called for the development of <b>light</b> <b>weight</b> idler rollers. As a result this project was designed to develop a <b>light</b> <b>weight</b> idler roller using pultruded continuous glass fibre, vinyl ester composite circular hollow section. Current literature on the subject highlighted the need for non-ferrous <b>light</b> <b>weight</b> idler rollers but offers no real solution. A rigorous test regime, including physical static and dynamic testing in conjunction with finite element analysis, was used to analyse a designed <b>light</b> <b>weight</b> composite prototype idler roller. The main empirical finding of the project was the possibility of producing shaftless lightweight composite idler rollers for use in the mining industry. The conceptual shaftless composite rollers are estimated to be 40 - 60 % lighter than traditional steel rollers. The <b>light</b> <b>weight</b> of the concept idler roller, combined with the possibility of manufacturing idler rollers that are dimensionally suitable for mining, addressed the concerns of the Australian mining industry and answered the call to develop a <b>light</b> <b>weight</b> conveyor belt idler roller. ...|$|R

An experimental {{study was conducted}} on restrained shrinkage test of cement mortar and <b>light</b> <b>weight</b> High Performance Fiber Reinforced Cementitious Composites (HPFRCC). Approach: Two types of <b>light</b> <b>weight</b> HPFRCC and a premix mortar containing small amount of fiber {{were included in the}} experiment. Results: Results showed the multiple cracks, as many as 49, in <b>light</b> <b>weight</b> HPFRCC specimens compared to few cracks (about six cracks) in the premix mortar specimen. At the end of shrinkage test, the width of the cracks in the mortar specimen was more than 250 &# 956;m with the largest crack width of about 400 &# 956;m. However, the scenario was quite different in <b>light</b> <b>weight</b> HPFRCC specimens, where the width of almost all cracks was less than 100 &# 956;m. Conclusion: The higher number of multiple cracks with small cracks width in <b>light</b> <b>weight</b> HPFRCC specimens due to drying shrinkage was due to their strain hardening and ductile behavior compared to quasi brittle behavior of premix mortar where less number of wide cracks was observed. </font...|$|R

Different hybrid combinations of PVA fibers with different lengths and volume fractions are considered to reinforce the mortar matrix. Among different hybrid combinations, the composite containing 2 % thicker PVA fibers of 12 mm length and 1 % thinner PVA fibers of 6 mm length and the composite containing 2 % thicker PVA fibers of 24 mm length and 1 % thinner PVA fibers of 6 mm length showed the best performance in terms of highest ultimate load, largest CMOD (crack mouth opening displacement) at peak load and multiple cracking behavior. The effects of four types of <b>light</b> <b>weight</b> sands on the strain hardening and multiple cracking behavior of hybrid fiber composites are also evaluated in this study. It has been observed that the ultimate load and CMOD at peak load for all <b>light</b> <b>weight</b> hybrid fiber composites are almost the same irrespective of volume fractions of <b>light</b> <b>weight</b> sand.
