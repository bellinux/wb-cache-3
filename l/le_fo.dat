40|$|Abnormal surface {{expression}} of HLA-DR by leukocytes {{is associated with}} a poor prognosis in critical care patients. Critical care patients often receive total parenteral nutrition with lipid emulsion (LE). In this study we evaluated the influence of fish oil <b>LE</b> (<b>FO)</b> on human monocyte/macrophage (M phi) {{expression of}} surface HLA-DR under distinct activation states. Mononuclear leukocytes from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers (n = 18) were cultured for 24 hours without LE (control) or with 3 different concentrations (0. 1, 0. 25, and 0. 5 %) of the follow LE: a) pure FO b) FO in association (1 : 1 v/v) with LE composed of 50 % medium-chain trygliceride and 50 % soybean oil (MCTSO), and c) pure MCTSO. The leukocytes were also submitted to different cell activation states, as determinate by INF-gamma addition time: no INF-gamma addition, 18 hours before, or at the time of LE addition. HLA-DR expression on M phi surface was evaluated by flow cytometry using specific monoclonal antibodies. In relation to controls (for 0. 1 %, 0. 25 %, and 0. 5 %: 100) FO decreased the expression of HLA-DR when added alone [in simultaneously-activated M phi, for 0. 1 %: 70 (59 +/- 73); for 0. 25 %: 51 (48 +/- 56); and for 0. 5 %: 52. 5 (50 +/- 58) ] or in association with MCTSO [in simultaneously-activated M phi, for 0. 1 %: 50. 5 (47 +/- 61); for 25 %: 49 (45 +/- 52); and for 05 %: 51 (44 +/- 54) and in previously-activated M phi, for 1. 0 % : 63 (44 +/- 88); for 0. 25 %: 70 (41 +/- 88); and for 0. 5 %: 59. 5 (39 +/- 79) ] in culture medium (Friedman p< 0. 05). In relation to controls (for 0. 1 %, 0. 25 %, and 0. 5 %: 100), FO did not influence the expression of these molecules on non-activated M phi [for 0. 1 % : 87. 5 (75 +/- 93); for 0. 25 %: 111 (98 +/- 118); and for 0. 5 %: 101. 5 (84 +/- 113) ]. Results show that parenteral FO modulates the expression of HLA-DR on human M phi surface accordingly to leukocyte activation state. Further clinical studies evaluating the ideal moment of fish oil LE infusion to modulate leukocyte functions may contribute {{to a better understanding of}} its immune modulatory properties.

40|$|Background & aim: To {{compare the}} effect of fish {{oil-based}} (<b>FO)</b> lipid emulsions (<b>LE)</b> for parenteral administration with standard LE and a new <b>FO</b> containing <b>LE</b> composed of four different oils on the antigen presentation and inflammatory variables. Methods: Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) activated human mononuclear leukocytes were cultured with different LE - Control: without LE; SO: soybean oil; SO/FO: soybean and FO (4 : 1); MCT/SO: medium chain triglycerides and SO (1 : 1); MCT/SO/FO: MCT/SO and FO (4 : 1) and SMOF: a new <b>LE</b> containing <b>FO.</b> Cytokine production was evaluated by ELISA, the expression of antigen-presenting and co-stimulatory surface molecules were analyzed by flow cytometry and lymphocyte proliferation was assessed by H(3) -Thymidine incorporation, after tetanus toxoid-induced activation. Results: All LE decreased the HLA-DR and increased CD 28 and CD 152 expression on monocytes/macrophages and lymphocytes surface (p < 0. 05). SO/FO and MCT/SO/FO decreased lymphocyte proliferation (p< 0. 05). All LE decreased IL- 2 product ion, but this effect was enhanced with MCT/SO/FO and SMOF (p < 0. 05). MCT/SOTO decreased IL- 6 and increased IL- 10, whereas SO had the opposite effect (p < 0. 05). Conclusion: <b>FO</b> <b>LE</b> inhibited lymphocyte proliferation and had an anti-inflammatory effect. These effects seem to be enhanced when FO is mixed with MCT/SO. SMOF had a neutral impact on lymphocyte proliferation and IL- 6 and IL- 10 production.

40|$|Objective ” {{is a term}} {{applied to}} outward things, in {{contrast}} to “subjective, ” used to denote those things that belong to the conscious life. Thus whatever is considered as independent of the perceiving and reasoning self is “objective, ” whereas all that belongs to the conscious life is termed “subjective. ” We speak of a thing as having “objective reality, ” that is, it is an object of perception and thought, a “thing ” external to the mind, that goes on existing even when we are not thinking about it. The term “subjective ” designates the contents of consciousness itself; the term “objective, ” the raw material or {{subject matter of the}} consciousness (the word “matter, ” of course, here not being restricted to its literal meaning). I. VERBALIZATION OF REVELATION The objective aspect of revelation is that embodied in the verbal expression of the message.

40|$|Although {{there have}} been several cycles of debate and re form on higher {{education}} since World War II, the most recent proposals, some implemented and others under considerat ion, are by far the most far reaching and consequential of the period. Mos t aim at resolving the conflict between the ideal of the Humboldt ian model of an elite research university, and the demand for an open, accessible, and differentiated system of higher education that takes into account the pivotal role of higher education in the modern world and in a democrat ic and pluralistic society. Forces and factors at work in other countries have affected the t iming and dynamics of system transformation, but the unification in the early 1990 s of the two German states, in which higher education had very different structures and mandates, has played a great role in the matter. 74 Andrà Wolter RÉSUMÉ Les plusieurs cycles de débats et de ré fo rmes universi taires en Al lemagne depuis 1945 se sont avérés modes tes en compara ison avec <b>les</b> r é <b>fo</b> rmes actuelles, dont certaines sont dé jà en vigueur tandis qu...|$|R
5000|$|The {{typology}} of Lojban is basically subject-verb-object, with subject-object-verb also common. However, it can practically be anything::mi | prami | do (SVO):mi | do | prami (SOV):do | se prami | mi (OVS):do | mi | se prami (OSV):prami | fa mi | do (VSO):prami | fe do | fa mi (VOS)Such flexibility {{has to do}} with the languages intended capability to translate as many expressions of natural languages as possible, based on a unique positional case system. The meaning of the sentence mi prami do is determined by prami realizing, with its own predefined place structure, a specific semantic relation between mi and do; when the positional relation between mi and do changes, the meaning of the sentence changes too. As shown above, Lojban has particular devices to preserve such semantic structure of words while altering their order.
