25|$|Before the {{creation}} of Hangul, people in Korea (known as Joseon at the time) primarily wrote using Classical Chinese alongside native phonetic writing systems that predate Hangul by hundreds of years, including idu, hyangchal, gugyeol, and gakpil. However, due to the fundamental differences between the Korean and Chinese languages, and {{the large number of}} characters needed to be <b>learned,</b> <b>there</b> was much difficulty in learning how to write using Chinese characters for the lower classes, who often didn't have the privilege of education. To assuage this problem, King Sejong created the unique alphabet known as Hangul to promote literacy among the common people.|$|E

The destination was Hobart in Tasmania. During the five-week voyage Amundsen prepared his telegrams and drafted the first report that he would give to the press. On 7 March, Fram reached Hobart, where Amundsen quickly <b>learned</b> <b>there</b> was as yet no news from Scott. He immediately sent telegrams to his brother Leon, to Nansen and to King Haakon, briefly informing them of his success. The next day he cabled the first full account of the story to London's Daily Chronicle, {{to which he had}} sold exclusive rights. Fram remained in Hobart for two weeks; while there she was joined by Douglas Mawson's ship Aurora, which was in service with the Australasian Antarctic Expedition. Amundsen presented them with a gift of his 11 [...] surviving dogs.|$|E

500|$|During a {{spin-off}} series titled , Gilly and Josh Ashworth head to Manchester. The series {{explored the}} dangers of bringe drinking and {{was funded by the}} Home Office. This was the start of changes implemented to the character that would continue into the main series. During the spin-off he was portrayed having negative experiences with excessive alcohol consumption, of this Quinlan said: [...] "Gilly and Josh had a little fight over Ruby (Nika McGuigan), so the character did change due to all the drink consumed. His mood changed further when he attempted to run after Josh after the scuffle, and fell down a set of stairs in the nightclub, losing some of his teeth. After the incident he couldn't wait to get back home to the village."He then stated that he wanted viewers to learn from his character's scenario and be responsible while drinking, stating: [...] "It will make people think twice about binge drinking and make people aware of the consequences if you do." [...] When the character lost his teeth it made the character's low confidence worsen, Quinlan made comment of this saying: [...] "Gilly's confidence was always low really - self-confidence, self-belief. But having no teeth isn't good to look at - not a good look. It's going to draw attention to him and not do him any favours." [...] To enable continuity the character was scripted a slight speech impediment, behind the scenes Quinlan had a special palette fitted, it was a real one fitted by real life dentists and paid for by the show, it would black the character's front teeth and leave a chipped one at the side. Quinlan also revealed it was quite difficult to speak when wearing it, but praised it as being realistic to have some form of speech impediment having teeth knocked out. Talking of his character's changes and lessons learnt during the special episodes Quinlan said: [...] "I think Gilly's learnt to chill out a little, not to follow the crowd and be a sheep. Everyone was drinking loads, he got caught up in it and he came out {{on the wrong side of}} it. So, I think there is a lesson <b>learned</b> <b>there</b> - Gilly will do his own thing and not drink as much." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, {{there have}} been {{investigations}} {{as to whether the}} hippocampus may store other non-spatial information as well. These other explanations in favor of non-spatial components of the hippocampus argue that the hippocampus has [...] "flexible" [...] functions in that it can apply memory in circumstances different from those under which these relationships were <b>learned.</b> <b>There</b> are also views that claim that the hippocampus has functions altogether removed from time and space. However, other explanations of data that prematurely support the existence of non-spatial functions in the hippocampus must be considered. Evidence against this flexibility theory {{comes in the form of}} using the delayed non-match-to sample task. This task uses flexibility in that the rat is first presented with a visual representation such as a block. After a delay, when presented with the block and a novel object, the rat must choose the novel object in order to obtain a reward. Its completion of this task requires flexibility. However, during this task, hippocampal activity does not sufficiently increase and lesioning (induced trauma) in the hippocampus does not change the rat's performance on this task.|$|E

[...] Hoiles went to a school in town; in his elderliness he remarked that the most important thing he had <b>learned</b> <b>there</b> was [...] "that the State, or a majority of citizens, had the right to use taxation to support the public school system". He once mockingly said of his education that [...] "attending government schools … handicapped me in developing my moral and mental faculties. … n short it retarded my education." [...] According to Carl Watner, Hoiles learned from his father at the time he graduated from high school that he should [...] "never ask anybody to do something for him that he was not prepared to do himself". He later studied electrical engineering at Mt. Union College in Ohio, where he worked as a subscription solicitor for The Alliance Review, a newspaper edited by his elder brother.|$|E
