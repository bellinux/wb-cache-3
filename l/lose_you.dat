5|$|Burger King {{introduced}} the Specialty Sandwich line under its Burger King and I promotional campaign {{developed by the}} J. Walter Thompson (JWT) agency. The advertisements featured customers and employees praising the new sandwiches accompanied with {{a brief description of}} the products being sold. Actor Stuart Pankin played a doorman in one commercial in the series. Another one of the promotions used was a scratch card game called What's my Specialty? where the customer would receive a card with their purchase in which they would have to match famous people to said person's profession. The commercial explained that if you expected to <b>lose,</b> <b>you</b> would be disappointed, as all cards were winners. Prizes included fries, sodas and sandwiches.|$|E

25|$|It {{is not my}} main {{ground of}} {{complaint}} that you have her, even though I loved her dearly; that she has you is my chief regret, a loss that touches me more closely. Loving offenders, I excuse you both thus: you love her, because you know I love her; similarly, she abuses me for my sake, in allowing my friend to have her. If I <b>lose</b> <b>you,</b> my loss is a gain to my love; and losing her, my friend picks up that loss. Both find each other, I lose both, and both lay this cross on me for my sake. But there is one consolation in this thought: my friend and I are one; therefore she loves me alone.|$|E
500|$|Two years later, Catherine faced a new {{crisis with}} the death of Charles IX at the age of twenty-three. His dying words were [...] "oh, my mother...". The day before he died, he named Catherine regent, since his brother and heir, Henry the Duke of Anjou, was in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, where he had been elected king the year before. However, three months after his {{coronation}} at Wawel Cathedral, Henry abandoned that throne and returned to France in order to become king of France. Catherine wrote to Henry of Charles IX's death: [...] "I am grief-stricken to have witnessed such a scene and the love which he showed me at the end... My only consolation is to see you here soon, as your kingdom requires, and in good health, for if I were to <b>lose</b> <b>you,</b> I would have myself buried alive with you." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{their brief}} single careers, Bradshaw and Faarooq reunited in WWE's former farm territory, Ohio Valley Wrestling, winning the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship on April 10, 2003. They vacated the Tag Team Championship when they {{returned}} to WWE television on the June 19, 2003 edition of SmackDown!, where they assisted The Undertaker in an ambush from the F.B.I. During their return, they revived their former gimmick of beer drinking and card playing segments in backstage areas. At Vengeance, the APA hosted a Bar Room Brawl, which Bradshaw won. On the September 4, 2003 edition of SmackDown!, the APA were booked in a WWE Tag Team Championship match against the defending champions, Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin, which the APA lost. After sporadic tag team matches, the APA was once again booked in a WWE Tag Team Championship match at WrestleMania XX, in a Fatal-Four way Tag Team match also involving Haas and Benjamin, Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty, and the Basham Brothers, which Rikishi and Hotty won to retain the Tag Team Championship. On March 18, 2004, SmackDown! general manager Paul Heyman forced the APA to face Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty after they mocked his being Stunned by Stone Cold Steve Austin the previous week, with the added stipulation that [...] "If you <b>lose,</b> <b>you</b> will be fired". After they were defeated, Heyman clarified that he would only be firing Simmons, not both men as he implied. He then told Bradshaw to worry about his own career, claiming that as a published author and a Fox financial analyst he was a valued asset to the company. Bradshaw opted to stay, and Faarooq left in disgust. In reality, Simmons retired from professional wrestling, which was covered up in the storyline as an on-screen firing. Three years later in 2006, Layfield retired from professional wrestling, becoming a commentator for Friday Night SmackDown!. Layfield returned as an active wrestler in 2008, on the Raw brand, while Simmons began cutting promos with his trademark catchphrase, [...] "Damn!".|$|E

2500|$|He {{points out}} that if a wager was between the equal chance of gaining two lifetimes of {{happiness}} and gaining nothing, then a person would be a fool to bet on the latter. The same would go if it was three lifetimes of happiness versus nothing. He then argues that it is simply unconscionable by comparison to bet against an eternal life of happiness {{for the possibility of}} gaining nothing. The wise decision is to wager that God exists, since [...] "If you gain, you gain all; if you <b>lose,</b> <b>you</b> lose nothing", meaning one can gain eternal life if God exists, but if not, one will be no worse off in death than if one had not believed. On the other hand, if you bet against God, win or <b>lose,</b> <b>you</b> either gain nothing or lose everything. You are either unavoidably annihilated (in which case, nothing matters one way or the other) or lose the opportunity of eternal happiness. In note 194, speaking about those who live apathetically betting against God, he sums up by remarking, [...] "It is to the glory of religion to have for enemies men so unreasonable..." ...|$|E

The album is a 'folk-opera' concerning a relationship {{between a man and a}} woman who is out of his league, Hayman stating that the album [...] "is a set of songs about someone who doesn't escape. It’s about how pride can <b>lose</b> <b>you</b> love. It's about high and low ambition and the gap between".|$|E

2500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of their [...] "Raise" [...] mini-tour, Swervedriver began recording material for a new album at Birdland Studios in Melbourne and then continued work at Konk Studios over {{the first half of}} 2014. The band took a break from recording to reprise a one-off [...] "Raise" [...] show at The Garage in Highbury, London on 4 April 2014. On 19 September 2014, the band stated via Twitter that they were mixing the album, which had a tentative release date of early 2015. On 7 January 2015, the band announced that their new album, titled I Wasn't Born to <b>Lose</b> <b>You,</b> would be released on 3 March 2015 through the Cobraside record label. The first single off the album, [...] "Setting Sun", was released on 13 January 2015.|$|E
2500|$|The censor, the Lord Chamberlain, {{hastened to}} see the show, and demanded changes. After an {{uncertain}} start, the revue was a huge success; the song [...] "We don't want to <b>lose</b> <b>you,</b> but we {{think you ought to}} go", encouraging young men to join the army, was a particular hit for Delysia. Within weeks the other items in the triple bill were dropped, and Odds and Ends was expanded to a full evening, with only a brief curtain raiser. Within two months of the opening, Delysia was an established star, invited to take part with Muriel Foster, Charles Hawtrey, Oscar Asche and Isidore de Lara in a charity matinée attended by Queen Alexandra. It was the first of many charity appearances that Delysia made during the war. Her biographer Anne Pimlott Baker writes that Delysia entertained wounded troops, and took many French refugees and orphans into her home. In 1916, she made her film début, and took a leading role in SHE, an adaptation of the Rider Haggard story, about a woman's passion for a young traveller.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the first}} three songs, each band member would {{separately}} introduce themselves to the audience as the others changed into their next costume. Initially this change involved removing the padded vests and wearing dark trench coats over the checkerboard turtlenecks from the space costumes. Later in the tour, the group donned black V-neck undershirts with the trenchcoats. They performed [...] "As Long As You Love Me" [...] with the song's signature [...] "chair routine". The backup dancers performed an extended chair routine and the band played an extended instrumental outro as the band changed into leather outfits for the next songs [...] "Don't Wanna <b>Lose</b> <b>You</b> Now" [...] and [...] "Quit Playing Games (With My Heart)", during which the band was again hooked up to wire harnesses and flown over the crowd (each to a different side of the audience) during the song's outro. They would throw stuffed animals out to audience members from the air. During the extended instrumental outro to that song, the band would again change into red and black motocross racing deflectors (plastic upper body armor) on top of black shirts and pants. Metal ladders {{were added to the}} corners of the stage for the band to climb and hang on during the next song, [...] "Don't Want You Back".|$|E
