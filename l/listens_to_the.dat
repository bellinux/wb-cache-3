5|$|Determined to save Marceline, Finn and Jake {{disguise}} {{themselves as}} demons and sneak {{back into the}} Nightosphere by creating a portal that sends them to the seat of government for Marceline's regime. Marceline, in her evil demon form, <b>listens</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> requests of her subjects, often ignoring what they seek and instead punishing them with macabre torture. Finn and Jake are spotted by Marceline, who gives chase. After narrowly avoiding their demonic friend, the duo run into the now-benign Hunson Abadeer, who explains that he only wanted Marceline to follow in his footsteps and rule the hellish realm.|$|E
5|$|Millennium Group {{consultant}} Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) {{watches the}} aftermath of the explosion on the news, knowing that the group will ask for his assistance with the case. Dees is among the rescuers seen on the broadcast. Black travels to DC and meets up with fellow group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn). The two join the FBI task force investigating the bombing, led by special agents Pierson (Sam Anderson) and Takahashi (Hiro Kanagawa). Watts and Black quickly dismiss several false claims of responsibility by terrorist groups. Black <b>listens</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 911 call left by Dees, deducing that the numbers dialled spell the word kaboom on a telephone keypad.|$|E

5|$|Anne is visibly upset upon {{learning}} {{that the new}} tenant of Kellynch Hall will be Admiral Croft, who is the brother-in-law of Frederick Wentworth (Ciarán Hinds)—a naval captain she was persuaded to reject in marriage nine years previously because of his lack of prospects and connections. Wentworth is now wealthy from serving in the Wars, and has returned to England, presumably to find a wife. Later, Anne expresses to Lady Russell her unhappiness at her family's current financial predicament, and her past decision to reject the captain's proposal of marriage. Anne visits her other sister Mary (Sophie Thompson), a hypochondriac who has married into a local farming family. Anne patiently <b>listens</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> various complaints confided in her by each of the Musgrove family; this includes Mary's husband Charles, sisters-in-law Louisa (Emma Roberts) and Henrietta (Victoria Hamilton), and parents-in-law Mr and Mrs Musgrove (Roger Hammond and Judy Cornwell).|$|E
5|$|The {{black-throated blue warbler}} uses social cues in its {{evaluation}} and choice of nesting sites. In particular, it <b>listens</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> post-breeding songs given out by other males. These songs have strong temporal dependencies. Males sing {{at the beginning and}} the peak of breeding season, but songs are not indicative of reproductive success. Near the end of a breeding season, a male that has successfully mated continues to sing while a male that has failed to reproduce abandons the habitat. Therefore, post-breeding songs are reliable indicators of reproductive success within the particular habitat and convey essential information to the natal and breeding dispersers. In comparison to the traditional idea of direct assessment of the vegetation structure, the vocal cue is much more efficient and easier to obtain, hence revealing the advantage of social communication in survival and reproduction. A female, however, does not respond to post-breeding songs directly. Instead, she is likely to rely on the presence of males in deciding nesting sites.|$|E

40|$|Taubah and <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Holy Quran recitation {{are highly}} {{recognizable}} Islamic repentance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Muslim community. Undoubtedly, these beliefs can flourish people's mind and soul. Therefore, this repentance has a miraculous power to reduce anxiety and stress like psychological pessimistic matters from one's mind. Besides this, <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Holy Quran recitation can relieve and calm a disturbed mind. Consequently, this repentance {{may be used}} as the therapeutic agents in some cases. In this work, the authors make use of taubah and <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Holy Quran recitation as stimuli in psychophysiological research, via galvanic skin response (GSR), an objective method for realizing the changes of emotional response of subjects. The results show that GSR {{can be used as a}} measure of mental states by <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Holy Quran. <b>The</b> effect of <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Holy Quran recitation on GSR is compared with that of taubah. Both taubah and <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Holy Quran recitation display changes on GSR; however the former reflects the greater changes than the latter. ...|$|R

25|$|Islam {{recognises}} God as the fountain-head of all excellences, {{free from}} all imperfection as {{understood by the}} Community. God is recognised as a Living God who manifests himself everywhere and <b>listens</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> prayers of his servants. Distinctively, however, Ahmadi Muslims recognise that the attributes of God are eternal. On account of this, Ahmadi teachings propound the view that God communicates with mankind as he did before.|$|E
30|$|All of the {{participants}} were required <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same spoken texts and answer the same questions, but each of the three groups was asked <b>to</b> take <b>the</b> tests in a different format. The students in Class 1 were given a sheet with only options written on it, and were asked <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> spoken texts without reading or <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> questions. After <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> each spoken text, they <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> three questions about the text only once and chose what they thought was <b>the</b> correct answer <b>to</b> each question. They were not able <b>to</b> read <b>the</b> questions but had a chance <b>to</b> hear <b>the</b> explanation of each question in their L 1 after <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> question in English. For example, after <b>the</b> students <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> question “What are the speakers discussing?” in English, I said to them “What is the topic of the conversation?” in Japanese. The test format for Class 1 is similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> TOEFL PBT in that only options can be seen and questions can be heard only once after <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> spoken text. However, it is different from the TOEFL in that students can receive assistance in their L 1.|$|R

25|$|From Biblical {{times to}} today, {{the most common}} form of prayer is to {{directly}} appeal to God to grant one's requests. This in many ways is the simplest form of prayer. Some have termed this the social approach to prayer. In this view, a person directly enters into God's rest, and asks for their needs to be fulfilled. God <b>listens</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> prayer, and may so or not choose to answer in the way one asks of him. This is the primary approach to prayer found in the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, most of the Church writings, and in rabbinic literature such as the Talmud.|$|E
25|$|The {{text of the}} Torah {{says that}} the name of Simeon refers to Leah's belief that God had heard that Jacob {{preferred}} her sister, Rachel, implying a derivation from the Hebrew term shama on, meaning he has heard of my suffering; this is a similar etymology as the Torah gives for the theophoric name Ishmael (God has heard), implying that the names are cognate. The name is sometimes interpreted as meaning he who <b>listens</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> words of God, {{and at other times}} thought to derive from sham 'in, meaning there is sin, which is argued to be a prophetic reference to Zimri's sexual miscegenation with a Midianite woman, a type of relationship which rabbinical sources regard as sinful.|$|E
25|$|The third {{treatise}} discusses war and peace, presenting through animal characters a moral about {{battle of}} wits being a strategic means to neutralize a vastly superior opponent's army. The thesis in this treatise {{is that a}} battle of wits is a more potent force than a battle of swords. The choice of animals embeds a metaphor of a war between good versus evil, and light versus darkness. Crows are good, weaker and smaller in number and are creatures of the day (light), while owls are presented as evil, numerous and stronger creatures of the night (darkness). The crow king <b>listens</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> witty and wise counsel of Ciramjivin, while the owl king ignore the counsel of Raktaksa. The good crows win.|$|E

Lady Carmichael is thrilled to think that Poirot has visited to investigate some special crime but the detective tells her he is simply there to tame four wild horses. He visits General Grant whose house is filled with artifacts from India. The General himself completes the clichéd picture, sitting in an armchair with his foot bandaged up from gout, drinking port and railing against the world. Poirot breaks the news of the drugs and <b>listens</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> old man's cries of anger and sworn threats against whoever is getting his girls into trouble.

25|$|When {{the patient}} visits a doctor, the latter spends {{time with the}} former {{discussing}} his medical problems, including history and/or problems. The doctor performs a physical examination and may request various laboratory or diagnostic studies; will make a diagnosis or differential diagnoses, then decides on a plan of treatment for the patient, which is discussed and explained to the patient, with instructions provided. After the patient leaves the office, the doctor uses a voice-recording device to record {{the information about the}} patient encounter. This information may be recorded into a hand-held cassette recorder or into a regular telephone, dialed into a central server located in the hospital or transcription service office, which will 'hold' the report for the transcriptionist. This report is then accessed by a medical transcriptionist, it is clearly received as a voice file or cassette recording, who then <b>listens</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dictation and transcribes it into the required format for the medical record, and of which this medical record is considered a legal document. The next time the patient visits the doctor, the doctor will call for the medical record or the patient's entire chart, which will contain all reports from previous encounters. The doctor can on occasion refill the patient's medications after seeing only the medical record, although doctors prefer to not refill prescriptions without seeing the patient to establish if anything has changed.|$|E
