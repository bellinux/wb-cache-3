50|$|Each {{processor}} and their secondary cache is contained on a HIMM (Horizontal Inline Memory Module) daughter card that plugs into the node board. At {{the time of}} introduction, the Origin 2000 used the IP27 board, featuring one or two R10000 processors clocked at 180 MHz with 1 MB secondary cache(s). A high-end model with two 195 MHz R10000 processors with 4 MB secondary caches was also available. In February 1998, the IP31 board was introduced with two 250 MHz R10000 processors with 4 MB secondary caches. Later, the IP31 board was upgraded to support two 300, 350 or 400 MHz R12000 processors. The 300 and 400 MHz models had 8 MB <b>L2</b> <b>caches,</b> while the 350 MHz model had 4 MB <b>L2</b> <b>caches.</b> Near {{the end of its}} life, a variant of the IP31 board that could utilize the 500 MHz R14000 with 8 MB <b>L2</b> <b>caches</b> was made available.|$|R
25|$|The earlier {{models of}} Raspberry Pi2 use a Broadcom BCM2836 SoC with a 900MHz 32-bit quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 processor, with 256KB shared <b>L2</b> <b>cache.</b> The Raspberry Pi2V1.2 was {{upgraded}} to a Broadcom BCM2837 SoC with a 1.2GHz 64-bit quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 processor, the same SoC {{which is used}} on the Raspberry Pi3.|$|E
25|$|The chips {{come in two}} sizes, with 6 MB and 3 MB <b>L2</b> <b>cache.</b> The smaller {{version is}} {{commonly}} called Penryn-3M and Wolfdale-3M as well as Yorkfield-6M, respectively. The single-core version of Penryn, listed as Penryn-L here, is not a separate model like Merom-L but {{a version of the}} Penryn-3M model with only one active core.|$|E
25|$|The P24T Pentium OverDrive for 486 {{systems were}} {{released}} in 1995, which {{were based on}} 3.3V 0.6µm versions using a 63 or 83MHz clock. Since these used Socket 2/3, some modifications {{had to be made}} to compensate for the 32-bit data bus and slower on-board <b>L2</b> <b>cache</b> of 486 motherboards. They were therefore equipped with a 32KB L1 cache (double that of pre-P55C Pentium CPUs).|$|E
50|$|On CPUs {{with small}} <b>L2</b> <b>caches,</b> copying memory can be {{expensive}} operations. It {{is important to keep}} copying to a minimum on such machines. This mostly applies to embedded systems.|$|R
50|$|The i.MX31 was {{launched}} in 2005. It integrates a 532 MHz ARM1136 CPU platform (with vector floating point unit, L1 <b>caches</b> and 128KB <b>L2</b> <b>caches)</b> + Video Processing Unit (VPU) + 3D GPU (OpenGL ES 1.1) + IPU + security block It supports mDDR-SDRAM at 133 MHz.|$|R
50|$|In {{a typical}} Tile Processor configuration, the {{switches}} {{in each of}} the tiles are connected to each other using one or more mesh networks. The Tilera TILEPro64, for example, contains 64 tiles. Each of the tiles comprises a CPU, L1 and <b>L2</b> <b>caches,</b> and switches for several mesh networks.|$|R
25|$|By {{the time}} of Barton's release, the Northwood-based Pentium 4 had become more than {{competitive}} with AMD's processors. Unfortunately for AMD, a simple increase in size of the <b>L2</b> <b>cache</b> to 512kB did not have nearly the same impact {{as it did for}} Intel's Pentium 4 line, as the Athlon architecture was not nearly as cache-constrained as the Pentium 4. The Athlon's exclusive-cache architecture and shorter pipeline made it less sensitive to <b>L2</b> <b>cache</b> size, and the Barton only saw an increase of several percent gained in per-clock performance over the Thoroughbred-B it was derived from. While the increased performance was welcome, it was not sufficient to overtake the Pentium 4 line in overall performance. The PR also became somewhat inaccurate because some Barton models with lower clock rates were being given higher PR than higher-clocked Thoroughbred processors. Instances where a computational task did not benefit more from the additional cache {{to make up for the}} loss in raw clock speed created situations where a lower rated (but faster clocked) Thoroughbred would outperform a higher-rated (but lower clocked) Barton.|$|E
25|$|The Conroe-L and Merom-L {{processors}} {{are based}} {{around the same}} core as Conroe and Merom, but only contain a single core and 1 MB of <b>L2</b> <b>cache,</b> significantly reducing production cost and power consumption of the processor {{at the expense of}} performance compared to the dual-core version. It is used only in ultra-low voltage Core 2 Solo U2xxx and in Celeron processors and is identified as CPUID family 6 model 22.|$|E
25|$|The Mac Mini G4 used {{single-core}} 32-bit PowerPC processors with 512KB of on-chip <b>L2</b> <b>cache.</b> The processor accessed memory {{through the}} front-side bus, which was clocked at 167MHz. The chips in these models of Mac Mini ran at either 1.25, 1.33, 1.42, or 1.5GHz. It {{also had an}} ATI Radeon 9200 graphics processor with 32MB of DDR SDRAM in the standard editions, which was upgraded to 64 MB VRAM in the high-end version of the final Mac Mini G4 in 2005.|$|E
50|$|The e600 is a superscalar out-of-order RISC core with 32/32 kB L1 data/instruction caches, a seven-stage, three-issue {{pipeline}} with load/store, system register, powerful branch prediction, integer unit, {{a double}} precision FPU and an enhanced 128-bit AltiVec unit with limited out-of-order execution. The core {{is designed to}} work in multiprocessing and multi core designs and can take large amounts of <b>L2</b> <b>caches</b> on die.|$|R
50|$|The T5 {{processor}} {{includes a}} crossbar network {{that connects the}} 16 cores with the <b>L2</b> <b>caches</b> to the shared L3 cache. Multiprocessor cache coherence is maintained using a directory based protocol. The design scales up to eight sockets without additional silicon (glueless). The snoopy based protocol used in SPARC T4 systems was replaced {{in order to reduce}} memory latency and reduce coherency bandwidth consumption.|$|R
50|$|An {{interesting}} {{aspect of}} the PA-RISC line {{is that most of}} its generations have no Level 2 cache. Instead large Level 1 caches are used, formerly as separate chips connected by a bus, and now integrated on-chip. Only the PA-7100LC and PA-7300LC had <b>L2</b> <b>caches.</b> Another innovation of the PA-RISC was the addition of vectorized instructions (SIMD) in the form of MAX, which were first introduced on the PA-7100LC.|$|R
25|$|Fifth-generation Athlon Barton-core {{processors}} {{released in}} early 2003 with PR of 2500+, 2600+, 2800+, 3000+, and 3200+. While not operating at higher clock rates than Thoroughbred-core processors, they were marked with higher PR by featuring an increased 512kB L2 cache; later models additionally supported an increased 200MHz (400MT/s) front side bus. The Thorton core was a later {{variant of the}} Barton {{with half of the}} <b>L2</b> <b>cache</b> disabled, and thus was functionally identical to the Thoroughbred-B core. The name Thorton is a portmanteau of Thoroughbred and Barton.|$|E
25|$|While the Core {{microarchitecture}} {{is a major}} architectural revision it {{is based}} in part on the Pentium M processor family designed by Intel Israel. The Penryn pipeline is 12–14 stages long — less than half of Prescott's, a signature feature of wide order execution cores. Penryn's successor, Nehalem borrowed more heavily from the Pentium 4 and has 20-24 pipeline stages. Core's execution unit is 4 issues wide, compared to the 3-issue cores of P6, Pentium M, and 2-issue cores of NetBurst microarchitectures. The new architecture is a dual core design with linked L1 cache and shared <b>L2</b> <b>cache</b> engineered for maximum performance per watt and improved scalability.|$|E
25|$|The Athlon's CPU cache {{consisted}} of the typical two levels. Athlon was the first x86 processor with a 128kB split level 1 cache; a 2-way associative cache separated into 2×64kB for data and instructions (a concept from Harvard architecture). This cache was double the size of K6's already large 2×32kB cache, and quadruple the size of Pentium II and III's 2×16kB L1 cache. The initial Athlon (Slot A, later called Athlon Classic) used 512kB of level 2 cache separate from the CPU, on the processor cartridge board, running at 50% to 33% of core speed. This was done because the 250nm manufacturing process was too large to allow for on-die cache while maintaining cost-effective die size. Later Athlon CPUs, afforded greater transistor budgets by smaller 180nm and 130nm process nodes, moved to on-die <b>L2</b> <b>cache</b> at full CPU clock speed.|$|E
5000|$|By {{switching}} the looping {{order for}} [...] and , the speedup in large matrix multiplications becomes dramatic, {{at least for}} languages that put contiguous array elements in the last dimension. This will not change the mathematical result, but it improves efficiency. In this case, [...] "large" [...] means, approximately, more than 100,000 elements in each matrix, or enough addressable memory such that the matrices will not fit in L1 and <b>L2</b> <b>caches.</b>|$|R
50|$|It is a {{high-performance}} core with separate 32 KB instruction and data L1 caches, a seven-stage out-of-order dual-issue pipeline, supporting speeds {{of up to}} 800 MHz and <b>L2</b> <b>caches</b> up to 256 KB. The core lacks a floating point unit (FPU) but it has an associated four-stage FPU that can be included using the APU (Auxiliary Processing Unit) interface. The 440 core adheres to the Power ISA v.2.03 using the Book III-E specification.|$|R
5000|$|... (Such Cache to Cache {{transfers}} {{can reduce}} the read miss latency if the latency to bring the block from the main memory is more than from Cache to Cache transfers which is generally the case in bus based systems. But in multicore architectures, where the coherence is maintained {{at the level of}} <b>L2</b> <b>caches,</b> there is on chip L3 cache, it may be faster to fetch the missed block from the L3 cache rather than from another L2) ...|$|R
25|$|One {{limitation}} (also afflicting the Intel Pentium III) is that SRAM cache designs at {{the time}} were incapable of keeping up with the Athlon's clock scalability, due both to manufacturing limitations of the cache chips and the difficulty of routing electrical connections to the cache chips themselves. It became increasingly difficult to reliably run an external processor cache to match the processor speeds being released—and in fact it became impossible. Thus initially the Level 2 cache ran at half of the CPU clock speed up to 700MHz (350MHz cache). Faster Slot-A processors had to compromise further and run at 2/5 (up to 850MHz, 340MHz cache) or 1/3 (up to 1GHz, 333MHz cache). This later race to 1GHz (1000MHz) by AMD and Intel further exacerbated this bottleneck as ever higher speed processors demonstrated decreasing gains in overall performance—stagnant SRAM cache memory speeds choked further improvements in overall speed. This directly lead to the development of integrating <b>L2</b> <b>cache</b> onto the processor itself and remove the dependence on external cache chips. AMD's integration of the cache onto the Athlon processor itself would later result in the Athlon Thunderbird.|$|E
500|$|The Poulson L3 {{cache size}} is 32MB. <b>L2</b> <b>cache</b> size is 6MB, 512IKB, 256DKB per core. [...] Die size is 544mm², less than its {{predecessor}} Tukwila (698.75mm²).|$|E

5000|$|Designed {{to process}} data that is {{substantially}} larger than memory at in-memory speeds, BLU Acceleration prefetches and streams data into the processing engine—advancing beyond system memory to in-CPU memory optimization. [...] It uses a specialized in-memory optimized columnar prefetching algorithm to determine a few milliseconds in advance what data should be loaded into RAM; every algorithm {{has been designed to}} minimize access to RAM, and maximize processing time in L3 and <b>L2</b> <b>caches,</b> which are an order of magnitude faster than RAM., ...|$|R

50|$|This protocol, a more {{elaborate}} {{version of the}} simpler MESI protocol (but not in extended MESI - see Cache coherency), avoids the need to write a dirty cache line back to main memory when another processor tries to read it. Instead, the Owned state allows a processor to supply the modified data directly to the other processor. This is beneficial when the communication latency and bandwidth between two CPUs is significantly better than to main memory. An example would be multi-core CPUs with per-core <b>L2</b> <b>caches.</b>|$|R
