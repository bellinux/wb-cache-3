5000|$|DAVID Laserscanner is a {{software}} package for low-cost 3D laser scanning. It allows scanning and digitizing of three-dimensional objects using a camera (e.g. a web cam), a hand-held <b>line</b> <b>laser</b> (i.e. one that projects a line, {{not just a}} point), and two plain boards in the background. Its most distinctive feature is that the laser line can simply be swept over the object by hand (like a virtual brush) until the results are satisfactory. At the same time, DAVID Laserscanner generates 3D data in real time and shows them on the computer screen.|$|E
50|$|Early in Anthony's {{literary}} career, {{there was}} a dispute surrounding the original publication (1976) of But What of Earth?. Editor Roger Elwood commissioned the novel for his nascent science-fiction <b>line</b> <b>Laser</b> Books. According to Anthony, he completed But What of Earth?, and Elwood accepted and purchased it. Elwood then told Anthony that he wished to make several minor changes, and {{in order not to}} waste Anthony's time, he had hired copy editor (and author) Robert Coulson to retype the manuscript with the changes. Anthony described Coulson as a friend and was initially open to his contribution.|$|E

50|$|An initial {{calibration}} is made {{to determine}} the lens parameters and location of the camera relative to the background boards, which are two vertical planes positioned at 90 degrees to one another behind the object to be scanned. When scanning, the camera {{must be able to}} see part of the laser line on each board. This enables the software to reconstruct the plane of the projected laser light. Once it has determined the two-dimensional plane that the <b>line</b> <b>laser</b> is projecting, it is able to analyse the image of the laser line falling on the scanned object and resolve it into points in space.|$|E
5000|$|A {{good example}} of where laser {{engraving}} technology has been adopted into the industry norm is the production line. In this particular setup, the laser beam is directed towards a rotating or vibrating mirror. The mirror moves in a manner which may trace out numbers and letters onto the surface being marked. This is particularly useful for printing dates, expiry codes, and lot numbering of products traveling along a production <b>line.</b> <b>Laser</b> marking allows materials made of plastic and glass to be marked [...] "on the move". The location where the marking takes place is called a [...] "marking laser station", an entity often found in packaging and bottling plants. Older, slower technologies such as hot stamping and pad printing have largely been phased out and replaced with laser engraving.|$|E
50|$|In {{the spring}} of 1972, Baumeister {{announced}} a breakthrough. He proposed a label with bars that were slightly longer than the distance across all bars {{that needed to be}} read in a single pass. This label could be scanned with a simple “X” scanner only slightly more complex than the straight <b>line</b> <b>laser</b> scanner. The next day Baumeister suggested if the label were split into two halves the bar lengths could be cut nearly in half. These two proposals reduced the area from the bull’s eye by one third and then one sixth. The image to the right shows the label proposed by Baumeister. He did not specify any specific bar code as that was well understood. Except for the bar coding and ten digits the UPC label today is his proposal. Shortly after that Baumeister transferred to another area of RTP.|$|E

5000|$|Big Fau's primary {{weapons were}} the {{turbines}} mounted just below its hands known as [...] "Saw Cuffs". When activated, they could grind through practically any material or even allow Big Fau to drill its fist straight through an opponent's body. The fists themselves could also spin, giving the megadeus' punches {{an incredible amount}} of destructive power. Additional weapons included two heavy beam cannons mounted in its shoulders, the standard Arc <b>Line</b> <b>laser</b> eyes which all Big type megadeuses have and laser projectors that extended on flexible periscope-like extensions from its back. Big Fau was also able to fire its arms at an opponent, the turbines drilling through any obstacle before detonating. Big Fau is equipped with some kind of energy shield which can repel Big O's fists and other matter-based attacks (missiles, bullets etc.). Judging by Big Fau's streamlined appearance, its turbine wrists, its ability to travel effortlessly through the water shown in the final episode, its conning tower shaped head as well as a conning tower on its back, and the flexible periscope-like laser cannons on its back, it is likely that Big Fau units were used primarily for naval combat, functioning as heavily armed amphibious craft, and providing ocean-based combat support for land- and air-based megadeuses.|$|E
5000|$|In mid 1971, William [...] "Bill" [...] Crouse {{invented a}} new bar code called Delta C.It {{achieved}} {{four times the}} characters per inch as Delta B. Delta B compared bar widths to space width to code bits. This was extremely sensitive to ink spread where too much ink or pressure would cause both edges of a bar to spread outward and too little to cause them to shrink. To make it worse as bars spread spaces shrink and vice versa. Delta C achieved its higher performance by only using leading to leading or trailing to trailing edges which was unaffected by uniform ink spread. The code provided best performance when it had a defined character set with a fixed reference distance that spanned most or preferably all the character. In August, 1971, Crouse joined the scanner effort. After several months they had made no progress. They {{were aware of the}} RCA bull’s eye label that could be scanned with a simple straight <b>line</b> <b>laser</b> scanner, but a readable label was far too large. Although Litton Industries proposed a bull’s eye symbol cut in half to reduce the area, it was still too large and presented the same ink smear printing problems as the RCA symbol. The redundancy and checking ability were removed completely. They were also aware of the many proposals from around the world, none of which were feasible.|$|E
5000|$|Point cloud mapping is {{a process}} being {{developed}} by Michael Taylor [...] using optical parallax scanning technology whereby thousands of measurements are made around {{the trunk of a}} tree. These can be used to recreate a three-dimensional model of the trunk and volume data is among the values that can be calculated. There are a handful of widely available technologies including ground LIDAR) and optical parallax scanners that can quickly and accurately map a trunk. LIDAR has the best range. The problem is in a cluttered forest environment {{you get a lot of}} ‘noise’ and unwanted cloud points, hundreds of thousands potentially, but these can be filtered out. The surface of tree trunks can be mapped using an optical scanner which measures pixel off-set ratio between a digital camera focal center and <b>line</b> <b>laser</b> projection and blends with photo pixel data. Taylor reports [...] this optical data can be supplemented using a system such as an Impulse200LR laser and Mapsmart software [...] to target tight areas where cloud density is low and/or not reachable by optical scanning technology, provided a properly scaled skeleton framework is established with the MapSmart/Impulse200 combination first. The data can be saved as a [...]ply file which can be viewed and manipulated with a variety of software packages including the free open source 3D graphics viewer Meshlab. [...] There are several software programs available that can be used to calculate the volume of the space defined by the point cloud including some tree specific currently under development.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{develops}} a novel calibration method for si-multaneously calibrating the intrinsic parameters {{of a camera}} and the hand–eye–workspace relationships of an eye-to-hand system using a <b>line</b> <b>laser</b> module. Errors in the parameters of a hand-eye coordination system lead to errors in the position targeting in the control of robots. To solve these problems, the proposed method uti-lizes a <b>line</b> <b>laser</b> module that is mounted on the hand to project laser beams onto the working plane. As well as calibrating the system parameters, the proposed method is effective when the eye cannot see the hand and {{eliminates the need for}} a precise calibration pat-tern or object. The collected laser stripes in the images must satisfy nonlinear constraints at each hand pose. A closed-form solution is derived by decoupling nonlinear relationships based on the homo-geneous transform and parallel plane/line constraints. A nonlinear optimization, which considers all parameters simultaneously with-out error propagation problem, is to refine the closed-form solution. This two-stage process can be executed automatically without man-ual intervention. The computer simulation and experiment verify the effectiveness of the proposed method and reveal that using a <b>line</b> <b>laser</b> is more accurate than using a single-point laser.

40|$|Unsupervised {{recognition}} of the reflected <b>laser</b> <b>lines</b> from the arc light modified background is prerequisite for the subsequent measurement and characterization of the weld pool shape, which is of great importance for the modeling and control of robotic arc welding. To facilitate the unsupervised recognition, the reflected <b>laser</b> <b>lines</b> need to be segmented as accurate as possible, which requires the segmented <b>laser</b> <b>lines</b> to be as continuous as possible to decrease the adverse effect of the noise blobs. In this paper, the intensity distribution caused by the arc light in the captured image is modeled. Based on the model, an efficient and robust approach is proposed and it comprises six parts: (1) reduction of the uneven image background by a difference operation; (2) spline enhancement to remove the fuzziness; (3) a gradient detection filter to eliminate the uneven background further; (4) segmentation by an effective threshold selection method; (5) removal of the noise blobs adaptively; (6) clustering based on the on-line computed slope of the <b>laser</b> <b>line.</b> After the <b>laser</b> <b>line</b> is clustered, a second order polynomial is fitted to it.
