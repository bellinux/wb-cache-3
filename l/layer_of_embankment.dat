In the early or mid-10th century, the Vistulan entity, like Silesia, was incorporated by Boleslaus I of Bohemia into the Czech state.

The first known Christian church structures were erected on Wawel Hill. Later in the 10th century, under uncertain circumstances, but in a peaceful way (the gord network suffered no damage on this occasion), the Vistulans became a part of the Piast Polish state.|$|R

40|$|Field and {{laboratory}} {{studies have been}} carried out into the desiccation fissuring of clay fill for flood embankments. The preliminary results confirmed that desiccation fissuring occurs to a depth of typically 60 cm within the outer surface <b>of</b> a flood <b>embankment</b> constructed from clay fill and can occur within 2 years of construction. The critical condition occurs when desiccation creates an interconnected network of sub-vertical and sub-horizontal fissures that increases the mass permeability of the fill material similar to that of coarse sand or gravel and hence allows rapid seepage of flood water through the surface <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> the <b>embankment</b> (crest and sides slopes). The aim of the thesis is to investigate the influence of desiccation fissuring on the stability <b>of</b> flood <b>embankments,</b> In particular, the main objectives of this thesis are as follows: 1.

However, the onset of desiccation fissuring in embankments and its contribution towards breach initiation has not been fully researched. Field and laboratory studies were thus carried out into the desiccation fissuring <b>of</b> clay flood <b>embankments</b> in the UK. The work found that a critical condition is reached when desiccation creates an interconnected network of sub-vertical and sub-horizontal fissures, which significantly increases the mass permeability of the fill material and hence allows rapid seepage of flood water through the surface <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> the <b>embankment.</b> It is suggested high rates of seepage cause localised uplifting of clay blocks, leading to progressive slope failure and successive breaching. Small-scale desiccation tests carried out on discs of soil in pressure plates showed very good agreement between the onset of cracking in the pressure plates and the moisture content recorded in the field. This suggests that it is possible to assess the susceptibility of a fill material to desiccation fissuring from the soil water characteristic curve...|$|R
