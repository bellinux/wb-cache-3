40|$|INTRODUCTION Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome was {{introduced}} into clinical practice in 1996 {{in order to}} describe unique syndrome, clinically expressed during hypertensive and uremic encephalopathy, eclampsia and during immunosuppressive therapy [1]. First clinical investigations showed that leucoencephalopathy is major characteristic of the syndrome, but further investigations showed no significant destruction in white cerebral tissue [2, 3, 4]. In majority of cases changes are <b>localize</b> in posterior <b>irrigation</b> {{area of the brain}} and in the most severe cases anterior region is also involved. Taking into consideration all above mentioned facts, the suggested term was Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) for the syndrome clinically expressed by neurological manifestations derived from cortical and subcortical changes localized in posterior regions of cerebral hemispheres cerebral trunk and cerebellum [5]. CASE REPORT Patient, aged 53 years, was re-hospitalized in Cardiovascular Institute "Dedinje" two months after succesfull aorto-coronary bypass performed in June 2001 due to the chest bone infection. During the treatment of the infection (according to the antibiogram) in September 2001, patient in evening hours developed headache and blurred vision. The recorded blood pressure was 210 / 120 mmHg so antihypertensive treatment was applied (Nifedipin and Furosemid). After this therapy there was no improvement and intensive headache with fatigue and loss of vision developed. Neurological examination revealed cortical blindness and left hemiparesis. Manitol (20 %, 60 ccm every 3 hours) and iv. Nytroglicerin (high blood pressure). Brain CT revealed oedema of parieto-occipital regions of both hemispheres, more emphasized on the right. (Figure 1 a, b, c). There was no sign of focal ischemia even in deeper sections (Figure 1 d, e, f). Following three days enormous high blood pressure values were registered. On the fourth day the significant clinical improvement occurred with lowering of blood pressure, better mental state and better vision. There was no sign of left hemiparesis on the 7 th day. On the 9 th day there were no symptoms or sign of disease. Control brain CT (15 th day) was normal. ETHIOPATHOGENESIS Most common causes of PRES are hypertensive encephalopathy [6 - 8], pre-eclampsia/eclampsia [9 - 12] cyklosporin A administration [13 - 22] and uremic encephalopathy [23]. There are several theories about the mechanism for PRES in hypertensive encephalopathy (reversible vasospasm and hyperperfusion) and administration of cyclosporin A (neurotoxic effect). CLINICAL PICTURE Most common symptoms are headache, nausea, vomiting, confusion, behavioural changes, changes of conciousnes (from somnolencia to stupor), vision disturbances (blurred vision, haemianopsia, cortical blindness) and epileptic manifestations (mostly focal attacs with secondary generalization). Mental functions are characterised with decreased activity and reactivity, confusion, loss of concentration and mild type of amnesia. Lethargy is often initial sign, sometimes accompanied with phases of agitation. Stupor and coma rarely occurred. DIAGNOSIS In patients with hypertensive ecephalopathy and eclampsia high blood pressure is registered. Neurological examination revealed vision changes and damages of mental function as well as increased reflex activity. Today, brain MRI and CT are considered the most important diagnostic method for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with PRES [6]. Brain MRI better detects smaller focal parenhim abnormalities than brain CT. The most often neuroradiological finding is relatively symetrical oedema of white cerebral tissue in parieto-occipital regions of both cerebral hemispheres. Gray cerebral tissue is sometimes involved, usually in mild form of disease. Diagnosis of this "cortical" form of PRES is possible by MR FLAIR (Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery) technique [5]. TREATMENT Therapeutic strategy depends on the cause of PRES and clinical picture. Most important are blood pressure regulation (labetalol, nitroprusid, diuretici), control of epileptic attacs (phenytoin), anti-oedema therapy. (Manitol), induction of vaginal delivery in eclampsia and discontinuation of cyclosporin therapy. In most cases there are no neurological manifestations after the 7 th day but some studies showed normalization of clinical finding after one year and more...|$|R

40|$|Summary Hydraulic {{redistribution}} (HR) by {{roots of}} large Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) trees was investigated {{by means of}} sap flow measurements made with the heat field deformation method. Irrigation was applied to a limited por-tion of the root system to steepen gradients of water potential in the soil and thus enhance rates of HR. On completion of the sap flow measurements, and to aid in their interpretation, the struc-ture of the root system of seven of the investigated trees was ex-posed {{to a depth of}} 30 cm with a supersonic air-stream (air-spade). Before irrigation, vertical redistribution of water was observed in large coarse roots and some adjacent small lateral roots. Immediately after <b>localized</b> <b>irrigation,</b> horizontal redis-tribution of water from watered roots to dry roots via the stem base was demonstrated. The amount of horizontal distribution depended on the position of the receiving roots relative to the watered roots and the absorbing area of the watered root. No re-distribution from watered roots via dry soil to roots of neigh-boring trees was detected. Responses of sap flow to <b>localized</b> <b>irrigation</b> were more pronounced in small lateral roots than in large branching roots where release and uptake of water are in-tegrated. Sap flow measurements with multi-point sensors along radii in large lateral roots demonstrated water extraction from different soil horizons. We conclude that synchronous measurements of sap flow in both small and large lateral roots are needed to study water absorption and transport in tree root systems...|$|E

The aim of this work was to compare fruit and oil yields in olive trees under <b>localized</b> <b>irrigation</b> (LI treatment) to those from trees with the whole root zone under non-limiting soil water conditions (Pond treatment). The LI trees received enough water to replace the crop water needs. The study was made for three consecutive years in mature 'Manzanilla de Sevilla' olive trees growing under field conditions. Main variables were also measured in young trees of the same cultivar growing in 50. L pots. Samples from rain-fed trees were also analysed. The LI trees showed similar water status than the Pond trees, but reduced stomatal conductance. As expected, the effect of the irrigation treatments on net photosynthesis was less evident. We observed a decrease in fruit yield in the LI trees, as compared to the Pond trees, likely because of the reduced gas exchange. No differences between the LI and Pond treatments were found for fruit weight, pulp:stone ratio, volume and the longitudinal and equatorial diameters. The LI treatment did not cause detrimental effect either on total oil content or virgin olive oil yield. The phenols content was greater in the LI treatment, but the (E) -hex- 2 -enal, one of the major volatile compounds and most related to the positive attributes of olive oil, was lower.

Three water treatments were considered: Rainfed, in which the trees had rainfall as {{the only source of}} water supply; FAO, in which the trees were under <b>localized</b> <b>irrigation</b> to replace the crop water demand, with some roots left in drying soil; Pond, in which the whole rootzones of the trees were maintained under non-limiting soil water conditions for the whole dry season. Our aim was to obtain information on the mechanisms behind the reduction of transpiration (Ep) in the FAO trees, as compared to the Pond trees. Our results show a near-isohydric behaviour of the FAO trees, i. e. those trees under <b>localized</b> <b>irrigation</b> in which some roots are left in drying showed lower stomatal conductance than the Pond trees in which all roots were in wetted soil. This helped the FAO trees to maintain similar leaf water potentials than the Pond trees. In addition, the FAO trees maintained a constant difference between the water potential of the canopy and that in the soil. This has been described as an isohydrodynamic behaviour, and it is thought to be an improvement over a typically anisohydric behaviour. These mechanisms were behind the similar values of tree hydraulic conductance (K p) found in the FAO and Pond treatments. The Rainfed trees showed lower Kp values because of the low Ep values of those trees, due to the low soil water availability in that treatment. Our results show, however, that the Rainfed trees were able to maintain similar values of Kp all throughout the dry season, which shows that the hydraulic efficiency of the xylem of those trees was little affected by embolism, despite of the high demanding conditions in the area.

From 1982 to 1987, <b>localized</b> <b>irrigation</b> has been increased (Pollok et al. 1990) hence; value of area waterlogged has been diminished. Also, percentage of area equipped for irrigation salinized has been increased due to increase of agricultural water withdrawal again. From 1987 to 1992, pressurized irrigation and agricultural water withdrawal have been increased. Hence, percentage of area equipped for irrigation salinized has been increased and area waterlogged has been decreased. From 1992 to 1997, values of surface irrigation (in comparison with pressurized irrigation), area waterlogged, agricultural water withdrawal, and percentage of area equipped for irrigation salinized, have been increased due to lack of appropriate management in the previous years and high costs as well as the dilemmas of these systems (Biswas 1986; Famoriyo 1984; Alam 1991). Note that NRI has been decreased from 1992 to 1997 and this indicates highlighted role of increase of surface irrigation (Houk et al. 2006). From 1997 to 2002, problems occurred in the previous period raised tendency to use of pressurized irrigation systems afresh but with a reasonable approach and competent management (Qadir and Oster 2004). This approach led to increase of pressurized irrigation as well as decrease of area waterlogged by irrigation. From 2002 to 2007, pressurized irrigation was still growing (Kigalu et al. 2008; Karlberg et al. 2007; Kheira 2009 b) and values of area waterlogged by irrigation and percentage of area equipped for irrigation salinized were decreased due to suitable management and decrease of agricultural water withdrawal.

With the availability of the input data required, such a method could be employed in other climatic regions for scheduling irrigation...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to apply microbial indicators of soil quality in drip-irrigated olive and peach orchards managed with sustainable agricultural practices. Soil characterization was carried out in different areas of the orchards along the row, under the drippers (Rdr), and along the inter-row, rainfed (IRrf), to evaluate the effects of irrigation. Two parameters were followed during one year: a) a biochemical soil indicator (Nc/Nk ratio) based on soil N/C turnover and soil enzyme activities, and b) the abundance of three important N-cycling genes (nifH, amoA and nosZ). <b>Localized</b> <b>irrigation</b> caused higher values of water content in the Rdrareas, compared to IRrf. The Nc/Nk ratio exhibited all the attributes of a reliable soil fertility indicator, being generally higher in irrigated Rdr areas. The abundance of nifH and amoA in the soil showed a trend similar to Nc/Nk, being affected by higher soil water content, while nosZabundance was generally insensitive to irrigation. Both Nc/Nkand gene abundances, much more than the measured chemical, biochemical and molecular soil parameters considered alone, can give a precise idea on N and C soil dynamics, that in turn, affect soil quality and fertility...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} about hydraulic redistribution and its ecological consequences is emerging. Hydraulic redistribution results from an interplay between competing plant and {{soil water potential}} gradients. In this work, stem-mediated hydraulic redistribution was studied in a 53 -year-old Douglas-fir tree {{during a period of}} drought. Sap flux density measurements using the heat field deformation method were performed at four locations: in two large opposing roots and on two sides of the tree stem. Hydraulic redistribution was induced by <b>localized</b> <b>irrigation</b> on one of the measured roots, creating heterogeneous soil water conditions. Stem-mediated hydraulic redistribution was detected during night-time conditions when water was redistributed from the wet side of the tree to the nonirrigated dry side. In addition to stem-mediated hydraulic redistribution, bidirectional flow in the dry root was observed, indicating radial sectoring in the xylem. It was observed that, through stem-mediated hydraulic redistribution, Douglas-fir was unable to increase its transpiration despite the fact that sufficient water was available to one part of the root system. This resulted from the strong water potential gradient created by the dry soil in contact with the nonirrigated part of the root system. A mechanism of stem-mediated hydraulic redistribution is proposed and its possible implications are discussed...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{difficulties}} {{in the implementation of}} agroenergy’s cropping is the growing area compe-tition with subsistence crops. Few studies have been conducted to show the efficiency of inter-cropping between plants of energy’s potential with cultures of economic sustainability. The objec-tive {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effectiveness of intercropping sunflower cultivars with corn and beans, in the initial growth under <b>localized</b> <b>irrigation.</b> The experiment was conducted at the end of the year 2012, in an area of 950 m 2, located in the Campus II-UEPB, Lagoa Seca, Paraíba. The irrigation system was managed based on the Reference Evapotranspiration (ETo), calculated by the Penmann-Monteith Method with data obtained locally. The experimental design was a rando-mized blocks factorial (2 × 4) × 3, with treatments combining two varieties of sunflower in four plantation systems: single or isolated, intercropped with maize, with bean and with caupi. Each plot consisted of four rows of sunflowers in spacing 0. 3 × 0. 7 m and length of 5 m, interspersed with rows of beans or corn, except in the isolated system. The central rows of sunflowers were used to measure the following growth characteristics: plant height, stem diameter, number of leaves and leaf área. Data were subjected to analysis of variance by F test and the means compare...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{research}} aims {{to present}} the evolution of <b>localized</b> <b>irrigation</b> methods, according to this process the modern equipment will be tested. This study will investigate the technical and economic efficiency compared to the currently used methods in the greenhouse. The {{study was conducted in}} the research center Hortinvest,University of Agronomic Sciences and Veterinary Medicine of Bucharest. The biological material used in this study case was the tomato hybrid Cindel. To obtain reliable conclusions we will provide the same quality parameters of irrigation water, using the same technology and culture in all experimental variants. The efficiency techniques that we adopted will be judged {{by the size of the}} achieved production and by assessing the quality indices of production. During the growing season vegetative growth and biometric measurements will be monitored and the duration of each phenological phase it will determine, depending on the technique used. ObjectivesTo establish the optimum irrigation, to determine the relationship between the type of substrate and the height of tomato plants, to determine the number of irrigations applied during the growing period, to determine the relationship between crop substrate and plants growth.

40|$|Field {{studies on}} citrus roots are {{important}} for genetic selection of cultivars and for management practices such as <b>localized</b> <b>irrigation</b> and fertilization. To characterize root systems of six rootstocks, taking into consideration chemical and physical characteristics of a clayey Typic Hapludox of the Northern State of Paraná, this study was performed having as scion the 'IAC- 5 Tahiti' lime [Citrus latifolia (Yu. Tanaka) ]. The rootstocks 'Rangpur' lime (C. limonia Osbeck), 'Africa Rough' lemon (C. jambhiri Lush.), 'Sunki' mandarin [C. sunki (Hayata) hort. ex Tan. ], Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf., 'C 13 ' citrange [C. sinensis (L.) Osb. x P. trifoliata (L.) Raf] and 'Catânia 2 ' Volkamer lemon (C. volkameriana Ten. & Pasq.) were used applying the trench profile method and the SIARCS® 3. 0 software to determine root distribution. 'C- 13 ' citrange had the largest root system. 'Volkamer' lemon and 'Africa Rough' lemon presented the smallest amount of roots. The effective depth for 80 % of roots was 31 - 53 cm in rows and 67 - 68 cm in inter-rows. The effective distance of 80 % of roots measured from the tree trunk exceeded the tree canopy for P. trifoliata, 'Sunki' mandarin, and 'Volkamer' and 'Africa Rough' lemons...|$|E
