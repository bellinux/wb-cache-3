40|$|The rotary <b>lip</b> <b>seal</b> is {{the most}} widely used dynamic seal. It is used {{extensively}} in the automotive and appliance industries. Experimentally, {{it is well known that}} the microasperities on the shaft surface can significantly affect the performance of a <b>lip</b> <b>seal,</b> even though the shaft roughness, after run-in, is much smaller than the lip roughness. In the present study, several deterministic numerical models are developed to investigate the effect of shaft surface finish on rotary <b>lip</b> <b>seal</b> behavior, through an understanding of the basic physics of <b>lip</b> <b>seal</b> operation. This project is performed in a step by step manner with gradually increasing complexity. Four models are included in this study: hydrodynamic analysis, elastohydrodynamic analysis for full film lubrication, mixed-EHL model for mixed lubrication with asperity contact, and transient dynamic mixed-EHL model for startup and shutdown processes. Those analyses allow the examination of some important seal characteristics, such as the load support sharing between hydrodynamic and contact pressure, contact and cavitation area ratio, reverse pumping rate, liftoff speed for tracing the liftoff process and average film thickness. The development of fluid, contact and cavitation areas as a result of the changing operation condition is also examined. The results of the present deterministic modeling indicate that shaft surface roughness can produce significant desirable effects on <b>lip</b> <b>seal</b> behavior.

40|$|Die Standardlösung zur Abdichtung von Wellen im Maschinenbau sind Radial-Wellendichtringe (RWDR) aus Elastomeren. Allerdings stoßen Elastomer-Werkstoffe in vielen Anwendungen an ihre Belastungsgrenzen. Durch Einsatz von PTFE-Compounds als Dichtungswerkstoff können die Einschränkungen von Elastomeren weitgehend überwunden werden. Daher werden in der Dichtungstechnik immer häufiger Manschettendichtungen aus PTFE-Compounds (PTFE-MD) eingesetzt. Im Gegensatz zu Elastomer-RWDR sind bei PTFE-MD Rückförderstrukturen (RS) erforderlich, um die dynamische Dichtheit zu gewährleisten. Für Anwendungen mit festgelegter Drehrichtung der Welle gehören PTFE-MD mit Spiralrille zum bewährten Stand der Technik. Die Spiralrille als RS ist aber nur für eine Drehrichtung der Welle geeignet. Bei wechselnder Wellendrehrichtung werden andere RS verwendet. Es gibt zwar bereits funktionierende PTFE-MD mit RS für beide Drehrichtungen der Welle, allerdings sind diese noch im Erforschungsstadium und weisen Optimierungspotenziale auf. Trotz des hohen potenziellen Nutzens für Dichtungsanwender durch die Verfügbarkeit von optimierten PTFE-MD mit RS, insbesondere für beide Drehrichtungen der Welle, gibt es kaum Fortschritte seitens der Dichtungshersteller. Dies liegt im Wesentlichen daran, dass die entsprechenden Funktionsmechanismen nicht hinreichend bekannt sind. Ohne Kenntnis der genauen Funktionsmechanismen ist eine gezielte Optimierung nicht möglich. Daher muss mit hohem experimentellem Aufwand durch „Versuch und Irrtum“ optimiert werden. Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit ist es einen Beitrag zum besseren Verständnis der dynamischen Funktionsmechanismen von PTFE-MD mit RS, insbesondere für beide Drehrichtungen der Welle, zu leisten. Dabei liegt das Hauptaugenmerk der Arbeit auf der numerischen Untersuchung der nachfolgenden Zusammenhänge. • Analyse des Strömungsverlaufs und der Druckverteilung um RS und im Dichtspalt. Dies dient einem besseren Verständnis der Vorgänge im Bereich des Dichtspalts. • Untersuchung unterschiedlicher Einflüsse auf das Umlenk- und Fördervermögen von RS. Ziel ist dabei die Identifikation von relevanten Einflussgrößen auf das Fördervermögen von PTFE-MD mit RS. • Analyse des Förderverhaltens durch den hydrodynamischen Dichtspalt und durch lokale Erhöhungen des Dichtspalts. • Betrachtung der Einflüsse der Dichtspaltgeometrie auf den Förderwert einer PTFE-MD mit RS. • Untersuchung der Auswirkungen von Geometrievariationen am Übergang einer RS in den geschlossenen Ring auf das Druckaufbauvermögen und damit auch indirekt auf das Fördervermögen von PTFE-MD mit RS. Durch ein besseres Verständnis der obigen Zusammenhänge können die dynamischen Funktionsmechanismen von PTFE-MD mit RS besser nachvollzogen werden. Hieraus lassen sich besonders wirkungsvolle Maßnahmen zur Verbesserung des Fördervermögens und damit der dynamischen Dichtsicherheit von PTFE-MD mit RS ableiten. Damit ist eine effektivere Optimierung möglich, wodurch der experimentelle Aufwand bei der Weiterentwicklung von PTFE-MD mit RS reduziert werden kann. The common {{solution}} for sealing shafts {{in mechanical engineering}} is the usage of radial shaft seals made of elastomers. However elastomers encounter load limits in many applications. Through the application of PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) compounds as sealing material, the limitations of elastomers can be largely overcome. Therefore the usage of <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> made of PTFE compounds is becoming more common in sealing technology. In contrast to the elastomeric radial shaft seals PTFE <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> require special pumping structures to ensure their dynamic tightness. For applications with a fixed direction of shaft rotation PTFE <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> with a spiral groove as pumping structure are established as state of the art. The spiral groove as pumping structure is only suitable for one direction of shaft rotation. For alternating directions of shaft rotation other pumping structures are used. Although functioning PTFE <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> with pumping structures for both directions of shaft rotation are already in existence, these {{are still in the}} research stage and there is potential for optimization. Despite the high potential benefit for users through the availability of optimized PTFE <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> with pumping structures, particularly for both directions of shaft rotation, there is little progress by the seal manufacturers. The main reason for lack in progress is deficient knowledge about the functional mechanisms of PTFE <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> with pumping structures. Without knowing the exact functional mechanisms targeted optimization is hardly possible. Therefore optimization of PTFE <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> with pumping structures requires high experimental effort and is accomplished by "trial and error". The aim of this thesis is to contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the dynamic functional mechanisms of PTFE <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> with pumping structures, particularly for both directions of shaft rotation. The focus of this thesis is the numerical investigation of the following topics. • Analysis of the flow pattern and pressure distribution around pumping structures and in the sealing gap. This serves a better understanding of the processes in the region of the sealing gap. • Investigation of various influences on the deflection and pumping ability of pumping structures. The objective is to identify the relevant parameters for the pumping ability of PTFE <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> with pumping structures. • Analysis of the pumping behaviour through the hydrodynamic sealing gap and through local elevations of the sealing gap. • Exploration of the influences of the sealing gap geometry on the pumping ability of PTFE <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> with pumping structures. • Investigation of the effects of geometry variations in the transitional area between pumping structures and the continuously closes ring, which is necessary for static tightness. The geometry of this area is crucial for pressure build-up and thus indirectly for the pumping ability of PTFE <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> with pumping structures. Through a better understanding of the above topics, the dynamic functional mechanisms of PTFE <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> with pumping structures are described more accurately than before. This allows to identify especially effective measures to improve the pumping ability and thus the dynamic sealing reliability of PTFE <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> with pumping structures. The mentioned measures imply a more efficient optimization, whereby the experimental effort in the advancement of PTFE <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> with pumping structures can be significantly reduced...|$|E

40|$|Rolling element {{bearings}} contain seals to keep lubricant {{inside and}} contamination outside the bearing system. These bearings {{are more often}} lubricated with grease rather than oil. Much knowledge is available on oil lubricated seals but {{a good understanding of}} grease lubricated seals is lacking. In this thesis, first the lubrication, pumping and sealing mechanisms of oil and grease lubricated radial <b>lip</b> <b>seals</b> have been discussed. The first paper reviews the public literature. This review has shown that very little is known on grease lubrication in radial <b>lip</b> <b>seals.</b> The primary lubrication, sealing and pumping mechanisms found for oil lubricated seals are micro-elastohydrodynamic lubrication between the seal and shaft roughness and tangential deformations of the seal surface for a pumping action. These mechanisms are important but it is felt that other effects have to be included for explaining differences seen in grease lubricated radial <b>lip</b> <b>seals.</b> One effect in grease lubrication is the normal stress effect which is described in the second paper. It is shown that the grease rheology and especially the normal stress effect {{play a significant role in}} film formation in grease lubricated seals. The model predicts that 50 to 60 % of the load carrying capacity can be generated by the normal stress effect for a low contact pressure bearing seal depending on the operating conditions. The oil bleed model presented in the third paper describes the release of oil from the grease. This model is based on viscous flow through the porous soap microstructure and the driving force is the pressure gradient resulting from centripetal forces. It is shown that the soap fibre distribution has to become anisotropic during oil bleed and the model has been validated with experiments at different temperatures and rotating speeds. The model can be used with good confidence for longer periods of time and can be used as input for replenishment models.
