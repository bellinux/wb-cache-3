25|$|Although the United Mine Workers of America {{failed to}} win {{recognition}} by the company, the strike had a lasting impact both on conditions at the Colorado mines and on labor relations nationally. John D. Rockefeller, Jr. engaged labor relations expert and future Canadian Prime Minister W. L. Mackenzie King to help him develop reforms for the mines and towns, which included paved roads and recreational facilities, as well as worker representation on committees dealing with working conditions, safety, health, and recreation. There was to be no discrimination against workers who had belonged to unions, {{and the establishment of}} a company union. The Rockefeller plan was accepted by the miners in a vote. Rockefeller also brought in pioneer public relations guru Ivy Lee, who warned that the Rockefellers were losing public support and developed a strategy that Junior followed to repair it. It was necessary for Junior to overcome his shyness, go personally to Colorado to meet with the miners and their families, inspect the conditions of the homes and the factories, attend social events, and especially to <b>listen</b> <b>closely</b> to the grievances. This was novel advice, and attracted widespread media attention, which opened the way to resolve the conflict, and present a more humanized versions of the Rockefellers.|$|E
25|$|Stories are {{effective}} educational tools because listeners become engaged and therefore remember. Storytelling {{can be seen}} as a foundation for learning and teaching. While the storylistener is engaged, they are able to imagine new perspectives, inviting a transformative and empathetic experience. This involves allowing the individual to actively engage in the story as well as observe, listen and participate with minimal guidance. Listening to a storyteller can create lasting personal connections, promote innovative problem solving and foster a shared understanding regarding future ambitions. The listener can then activate knowledge and imagine new possibilities. Together a storyteller and listener can seek best practices and invent new solutions. Because stories often have multiple layers of meanings, listeners have to <b>listen</b> <b>closely</b> to identify the underlying knowledge in the story. Storytelling is used as a tool to teach children the importance of respect through the practice of listening. As well as connecting children with their environment, through the theme of the stories, and give them more autonomy by using repetitive statements, which improve their learning to learn competence. It is also used to teach children to have respect for all life, value inter-connectedness and always work to overcome adversity. To teach this a Kinesthetic learningstyle would be used, involving the listeners through music, dream interpretation, or dance.|$|E
500|$|News {{footage of}} then-President Bill Clinton was {{digitally}} altered {{to make it}} appear as if he is speaking about alien contact. This was not the original plan for the film; Zemeckis had initially approached Sidney Poitier to play the president, but the actor turned the role down in favor of The Jackal. Shortly after Poitier's refusal, Zemeckis saw a NASA announcement in August 1996. [...] "Clinton gave his Mars rock speech," [...] the director explained, [...] "and I swear to God it was like it was scripted for this movie. When he said the line 'We will continue to <b>listen</b> <b>closely</b> to what it has to say,' I almost died. I stood there with my mouth hanging open." ...|$|E

500|$|At Metacritic, which assigns a {{normalized}} rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream critics, Sale el Sol received an average score of 89 based on 5 reviews, indicating [...] "universal acclaim". Carlos Quintana from About.com praised Shakira's experimentation with merengue and rock sounds on the album, noting that her [...] "never ending innovative style giving us {{an indication of}} her artistic evolution and current musical interests", and that Sale el Sol [...] "shows again why Shakira {{is one of the}} top Latin Pop artists in the world". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave it a very positive review, complimenting Shakira's versatility in her [...] "pan-global approach", and praising the album's simple and [...] "breezy" [...] nature, saying it [...] "never once sounds disparate or overworked -- it's sunny and easy, its natural buoyancy disguising Shakira's range and skill -- but <b>listen</b> <b>closely</b> and it becomes apparent that nobody makes better pop records in the new millennium than she does". The Billboard review of the album was also extremely positive, noting that its composition is [...] "infinitely more memorable and unique than the singer's baffling 2009 set, She Wolf", and that it [...] "manages to bridge the divide between the old and new Shakira with a spark that keeps you listening to the very end".|$|E
500|$|The Publicity Bureau was {{the first}} PR agency and was founded by former Boston journalists, {{including}} Ivy Lee. Ivy Lee is sometimes called the father of PR and was influential in establishing it as a professional practice. In 1906, Lee published a Declaration of Principles, which said that PR work {{should be done in}} the open, should be accurate and cover topics of public interest. According to historian Eric Goldman, the declaration of principles marked the beginning of an emphasis on informing, rather than misleading, the public. Ivy Lee is also credited with developing the modern press release and the [...] "two-way-street" [...] philosophy of both listening to and communicating with the public. In 1906, Lee helped facilitate the Pennsylvania Railroad's first positive media coverage after inviting press to the scene of a railroad accident, despite objections from executives. At the time, secrecy about corporate operations was common practice. Lee's work was often identified as spin or propaganda. In 1913 and 1914, the mining union was blaming the Ludlow Massacre, where on-strike miners and their families were killed by state militia, on the Rockefeller family and their coal mining operation, The Colorado Fuel and Iron Company. On the Rockefeller family's behalf, Lee published bulletins called [...] "Facts Concerning the Struggle in Colorado for Industrial Freedom," [...] which contained false and misleading information. Lee warned that the Rockefellers were losing public support and developed a strategy that Junior followed to repair it. It was necessary for Junior to overcome his shyness, go personally to Colorado to meet with the miners and their families, inspect the conditions of the homes and the factories, attend social events, and especially to <b>listen</b> <b>closely</b> to the grievances. This was novel advice, and attracted widespread media attention, which opened the way to resolve the conflict, and present a more humanized versions of the Rockefellers. [...] In response the labor press said Lee [...] "twisted the facts" [...] and called him a [...] "paid liar," [...] a [...] "hired slanderer," [...] and a [...] "poisoner of public opinion." [...] By 1917, Bethlehem Steel company announced it would start a publicity campaign against perceived errors about them. The Y.M.C.A. opened a new press secretary. AT and others also started their first publicity programs.|$|E

The announcers spoke in stentorian tones, as if giving a formal speech to a crowd and not communicating on a personal level. Godfrey vowed that {{when he returned to the}} airwaves, he would affect a relaxed, informal style as if he were talking to just one person. He also used that style to do his own commercials and became a regional star. [...] Over time, he added wisecracks to his commercials and would kid the sponsors, a risky move that quickly gained acceptance when his sponsors discovered their sales increased after Godfrey's added jokes.|$|E

2500|$|Little Broken Hearts {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 69 based on 27 reviews, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic rated the album three-and-a-half stars {{out of five}} and found that Jones and Burton are [...] "well matched" [...] and added: [...] "Norah Jones may be pouring her heart out but it's been given an elegantly detailed sculpture that camouflages her pain. <b>Listen</b> <b>closely</b> and its evident, but it takes effort to ignore the alluring haze and hear the songs that lie beneath." [...] American Songwriters review was positive about the album, calling it [...] "the most dramatic and rewarding departure she's [...] made in her career" [...] and said: [...] "Little Broken Hearts is her most commanding and compelling role yet." [...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave a positive review to the album and rated it four-stars-out-of-five, writing: [...] "It might be dark, but this stunning collection of anguish is the brightest she's shined in a long time." [...] Marcus J. Moore of BBC Music also gave a positive review to the album, mentioned she [...] "never sounds too depressed on this set", and further expanded: [...] "She keeps the mood fairly moderate amongst Burton's fluid soundtrack, setting the pace with a wry bravado that makes this album a dynamic listen." [...] Maerz of Entertainment Weekly gave a B grade to the album and wrote: [...] "With Brian Burton (a.k.a. Danger Mouse) producing, the heavy-lidded-vixen thing works for her here." [...] Consequence of Sound critic Adam Kivel went in-depth on his review of the album, finally giving it three-and-a-half stars out of five and concluded: [...] "This is a serious indie pop album. Jones and Burton have created something that should fit in the record collection of any Feist-loving indie kid just as easily as that of those soccer moms she won over years ago." ...|$|E
