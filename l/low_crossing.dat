50|$|Native Americans {{were the}} first to utilize Rollins Pass as a natural, <b>low</b> <b>crossing</b> over the Continental Divide for the {{purposes}} of communal hunting of large game, including big-horn sheep and elk. There are more than 96 documented game drives, including the Olson Game Drive, found largely above timberline and near the summits of multiple mountain ridges. Handmade rock walls drove prey towards hunters waiting in blinds. These unique high-altitude constructs were built, refined, and continually used over millennia. Currently the game drives are being studied by Colorado State University archaeology graduate students led by Dr. Jason M. LaBelle, associate professor, Department of Anthropology, Center for Mountain and Plains Archaeology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins.|$|E

50|$|Around this time, the Romans {{defeated}} the Brigantes, a peaceful, farming people. The Romans named this new settlement Lagentium. They built a turf and timber fort {{sometime in the}} early 70s to guard the river crossings and the vital road to the north. The fort was built on either a natural ridge or a man-made mound, we are not certain. The Roman engineers chose Lagentium for its strongly strategic position. The mound offered a strong and clear vantage point, and the river offered a source of water and food. The <b>low</b> <b>crossing</b> point also had the advantage that {{both sides of the}} river could be farmed on. So a fort was built on top of a Brigantian settlement. Over the sixty years since the fort was built, permanent shops and gardens were built, and traders began to arrive.|$|E
5000|$|After {{returning}} to New York, Maciunas became reacquainted with Henry Flynt, who encouraged members of Fluxus {{to take a}} more overtly political stance. One of the results of these discussions was to set up a picket line at the American premiere of Originale, a recent work by the German composer Karlheinz Stockhausen, 8 September 1964. Stockhausen was deemed a 'Cultural Imperialist' by Maciunas and Flynt, while other members vehemently disagreed. The result was members of Fluxus, such as Nam June Paik and Jackson Mac <b>Low,</b> <b>crossing</b> a picket line made up of other members, including Ben Vautier and Takako Saito who handed out leaflets denouncing Stockhausen as [...] "a characteristic European-North American ruling-class Artist". Dick Higgins participated in the picket, and then coolly joined the other performers inside;Maciunas and his friend Henry Flynt tried to get the Fluxus people to march around outside the circus with white cards that said Originale was bad. And they tried to say that the Fluxus people who were in the circus weren't Fluxus any more. That was silly, because it made a split. I thought it was funny, and so first I walked around with Maciunas and with Henry with a card, then I went inside and joined the circus; so both groups got angry with me. Oh well. Some people say that Fluxus died that day—I once thought so myself—but it turned out I was wrong.The event, arranged by Charlotte Moorman as part of her 2nd Annual New York Avant Garde Festival, would cement animosities between Maciunas and her, with Maciunas frequently demanding that artists associated with Fluxus {{have nothing to do with}} the annual festival, and would often expel artists who ignored his demands. This hostility continued throughout Maciunas' life—much to Moorman's bemusement—despite her continued championing of Fluxus art and artists.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{crossing}} {{number of}} a graph G {{is the smallest}} number of edge crossings in any drawing of G into the plane. Recently, the first branch-and-cut approach for solving the crossing number problem has been presented in [3]. Its major drawback was the huge number of variables out of which only very few were actually used in the optimal solution. This restricted the algorithm to rather small graphs with <b>low</b> <b>crossing</b> number. In this paper we discuss two column generation schemes; the first is based on traditional algebraic pricing, and the second uses combinatorial arguments to decide whether and which variables need to be added. The main focus {{of this paper is}} the experimental comparison between the original approach, and these two schemes. We also compare these new results to the solutions of the best known crossing number heuristic. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{extend the}} earlier {{suggested}} QCD-motivated {{model for the}} Q 2 -dependence of the generalized Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn (GDH) sum rule which assumes the smooth dependence of the structure function gT, while the sharp dependence {{is due to the}} g 2 contribution and is described by the elastic part of the Burkhardt-Cottingham sum rule. The model successfully predicts the <b>low</b> <b>crossing</b> point for the proton GDH integral, but is at variance with the recent very accurate JLAB data. We show that, at this level of accuracy, one should include the previously neglected radiative and power QCD corrections, as boundary values for the model. We stress that the GDH integral, when measured with such a high accuracy achieved by the recent JLAB data, is very sensitive to QCD power corrections. We estimate the value of these power corrections from the JLAB data at Q 2 ∼ 1 GeV 2. The inclusion of all QCD corrections leads to a good description of proton, neutron and deuteron data at all Q 2...|$|E
40|$|The {{number of}} {{selectively}} neutral polymorphic sites {{in a random}} sample of genes can be affected by ancestral selectively favored substitutions at linked loci. The degree to which this happens depends on when {{in the history of the}} sample the selected substitutions happen, the strength of selection and the amount of crossing over between the sampled locus and the loci at which the selected substitutions occur. This phenomenon is commonly called hitchhiking. Using the coalescent process for {{a random sample of}} genes from a selectively neutral locus that is linked to a locus at which selection is taking place, a stochastic, finite population model is developed that describes the steady state effect of hitchhiking on the distribution of the number of selectively neutral polymorphic sites in a random sample. A prediction of the model is that, in regions of <b>low</b> <b>crossing</b> over, strongly selected substitutions in the history of the sample can substantially reduce the number of polymorphic sites in a random sample of genes from that expected under a neutral model...|$|E
