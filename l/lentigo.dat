Most of these mutations involve singe amino acid changes {{at one of}} the two 14-3-3 binding motifs. Mutation of c-Raf is one of the possible causes of Noonan syndrome: affected individuals have congenital heart defects, short and dysmorphic stature and several other deformities. Similar mutations in c-Raf can also cause a related condition, termed LEOPARD syndrome (<b>Lentigo,</b> Electrocardiographic abnormalities, Ocular hypertelorism, Pulmonary stenosis, Abnormal genitalia, Retarded growth, Deafness), with a complex association of defects.|$|E
25|$|Excisional biopsies may {{remove the}} tumor, but further surgery is often {{necessary}} {{to reduce the}} risk of recurrence. Complete surgical excision with adequate surgical margins and assessment for the presence of detectable metastatic disease along with short- and long-term followup is standard. Often this is done by a wide local excision (WLE) with 1 to 2cm margins. Melanoma-in-situ and <b>lentigo</b> malignas are treated with narrower surgical margins, usually 0.2 to 0.5cm. Many surgeons consider 0.5cm the standard of care for standard excision of melanoma-in-situ, but 0.2cm margin might be acceptable for margin controlled surgery (Mohs surgery, or the double-bladed technique with margin control). The wide excision aims to reduce the rate of tumor recurrence at the site of the original lesion. This is a common pattern of treatment failure in melanoma. Considerable research has aimed to elucidate appropriate margins for excision with a general trend toward less aggressive treatment during the last decades.|$|E

40|$|International audienceLasers {{are a very}} {{effective}} approach for treating many hyperpigmented lesions. They are the gold standard treatment for actinic <b>lentigos</b> and dermal hypermelanocytosis, such as Ota nevus. Becker nevus, hyperpigmented mosaicisms, and lentigines can also be succesfully treated with lasers, but they could be less effective and relapses can be observed. However, lasers cannot be proposed {{for all types of}} hyperpigmentation. Thus, freckles and café-aulait macules should not be treated as the relapses are nearly constant. Due to its complex pathophysiology, melasma has a special place in hyperpigmented dermatoses. Q-switched lasers (using standard parameters or low fluency) should not be used because of consistent relapses and the high risk of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Paradoxically, targeting the vascular component of the melasma lesion with lasers could have a beneficial effect. However, these results have yet to be confirmed. In all cases, a precise diagnosis of the type of hyperpigmentation is mandatory before any laser treatment, and the limits and the potential side effects of the treatment must be clearly explained to patients...|$|R
40|$|The {{incidence}} of basal layer melanocytes has been assessed in the epidermis overlying and adjacent to melanocytic and other tumors of {{and in the}} skin. The technique employed was direct counting of melanocytes in 6 μ vertical sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin. A summary of the author's work {{on the distribution of}} melanocytes in normal human epidermis and age, sex and site related frequency variations is included. A raised {{incidence of}} melanocytes was observed over primary malignant melanomas, compound nevi, juvenile melanomas and <b>lentigos.</b> The normal area incidence of melanocytes was noted in the epidermis over simple intradermal nevi, blue nevi, secondary malignant melanomas, secondary carcinoma in the dermis and most simple and malignant non-melanocytic epidermal tumors. Three abnormal patterns of melanocyte distribution were noted around malignant melanomas, symmetrical field change, asymmetrical field change and no field change. Patients with tumors arising in areas of field change had a better five year survival rate and less frequent hematogenous dissemination than those with no evidence of field change. The relevance of quantitative variations in melanocyte incidence to site distribution of malignant melanoma, the relationship of clinical 'lentigo' to histologically assessed melanocyte patterns, the histogenesis of the blue nevus and mechanisms of malignant transformation of melanocytes are considered...|$|R
40|$|Skin {{hyperpigmentation}} {{is characterized}} by increased melanin synthesis and deposition that can cause significant psychosocial and psychological distress. Although several cytokine-receptor signaling cascades contribute {{to the formation of}} ultraviolet B-induced cutaneous hyperpigmentation, their possible involvement in other types of skin hyperpigmentation has never been clearly addressed. Since our continuous studies using skin specimens from more than 30 subjects with ethnic skin diversity emphasized a consistent augmentation in the expression of endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) and its receptor (Endothelin B receptor, ET-B) in hyperpigmented lesions, including senile <b>lentigos</b> (SLs), the precise function of ET- 1 signaling was investigated in the present study. In line with previous studies, ET- 1 significantly induced melanogenesis followed by increases in melanosome transport in melanocytes and in its transfer to keratinocytes while inhibition of ET-B function substantially depressed melanogenic ability in tissue-cultured SLs. Additionally, in agreement with a previous report that the formation of autophagosomes rather than melanosomes is stimulated according to starvation or defective melanosome production, ET- 1 was found to remarkably augment the expression of components necessary for early melanosome formation, indicating its counteraction against autophagy-targeting melanosome degradation in melanocytes. Despite the lack of substantial impact of ET- 1 on keratinocyte melanogenic functions, the expression of ET- 1 was enhanced following melanosome uptake by keratinocytes. Taken together, our data suggest that ET- 1 plays a substantial role in the development and/or maintenance of skin hyperpigmentation in reciprocal cooperation with increased melanosome incorporation...|$|R
2500|$|Excisional skin biopsy is the {{management}} of choice. Here, the suspect lesion is totally removed with an adequate (but minimal, usually 1 or 2mm) ellipse of surrounding skin and tissue. [...] To avoid disruption of the local lymphatic drainage, the preferred surgical margin for the initial biopsy should be narrow (1mm). The biopsy should include the epidermal, dermal, and subcutaneous layers of the skin. This enables the histopathologist to determine {{the thickness of the}} melanoma by microscopic examination. This is described by Breslow's thickness (measured in millimeters). However, for large lesions, such as suspected <b>lentigo</b> maligna, or for lesions in surgically difficult areas (face, toes, fingers, eyelids), a small punch biopsy in representative areas will give adequate information and will not disrupt the final staging or depth determination. In no circumstances should the initial biopsy include the final surgical margin (0.5cm, 1.0cm, or 2cm), as a misdiagnosis can result in excessive scarring and morbidity from the procedure. A large initial excision will disrupt the local lymphatic drainage and can affect further lymphangiogram-directed lymphnode dissection. A small punch biopsy can be used at any time where for logistical and personal reasons a patient refuses more invasive excisional biopsy. Small punch biopsies are minimally invasive and heal quickly, usually without noticeable scarring.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the relative risk for cutaneous melanoma associated with phenotypic and environmental variables in a population in central Italy and to assess how the combination of the different risk factors contributes to the overall risk for melanoma. We performed a case-control study of 100 patients with sporadic cutaneous melanoma and 200 controls matched for sex, age, ethnicity and residential area. Individuals were interviewed concerning pigmentary traits and sun exposure, and underwent a total body skin examination. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between cutaneous melanoma and constitutional and environmental variables. The strongest risk factors were prolonged recreational sun exposure (odds ratio [OR] 5. 010, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 2. 110 - 11. 891), the presence of clinically atypical naevi (OR 4. 916, 95 % CI 2. 496 - 9. 995) and the presence of > 50 common melanocytic naevi (OR 4. 684, 95 % CI 2. 442 - 9. 231). In addition, occupational sun exposure (OR 2. 573, 95 % CI 1. 399 - 4. 732), light brown hair (OR 2. 336, 95 % CI 1. 328 - 4. 138), high density of solar <b>lentigos</b> and/or actinic keratoses (OR 1. 824, 95 % CI 1. 0 - 3. 510) and type II, fair skin (OR 1. 815, 95 % CI 1. 031 - 3. 193) and blue eyes (OR 1. 757, 95 % CI 1. 0 - 3. 477) were each significantly associated with cutaneous melanoma risk. The combination of individual strong risk factors was associated with up to a 46 -fold increase in the risk for cutaneous melanoma. Selected pigmentary traits, sun exposure and melanocytic naevi, individually and in combination, are important risk factors for cutaneous melanoma in an Italian population...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Lentigo</b> maligna (also {{known as}} [...] "lentiginous {{melanoma}} on sun-damaged skin") is a melanoma in situ {{that consists of}} malignant cells but does not show invasive growth. <b>Lentigo</b> maligna {{is not the same}} as <b>lentigo</b> maligna melanoma, and should be discussed separately. It typically progresses very slowly and can remain in a non-invasive form for years. The transition to true melanoma is marked by the appearance of a bumpy surface (itself a marker of vertical growth and invasion), at which point it is called <b>lentigo</b> maligna melanoma. It is normally found in the elderly (peak incidence in the 9th decade), on skin areas with high levels of sun exposure like the face and forearms. Some authors do not consider <b>lentigo</b> maligna to be a melanoma. It is commonly thought of as a melanoma precursor. Incidence of evolution to <b>lentigo</b> maligna melanoma is very low, about 2.2% to 5% in elderly patients.|$|E
