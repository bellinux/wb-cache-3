40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} an improved decision tree of multiclass SVM classifiers, {{with which we}} participate in the basic task and the cheap task of large-scale hierarchical text classification challenge. The structure of the decision tree is a simplified version of {{the hierarchy of the}} classes, and the optimal learning parameter of each node has been au-tomatically searched. For two tasks of the challenge, the time cost of our system on a normal person computer is reasonable, and its performance is competitive. We participate in large-scale hierarchical text classfication with an system of improved hierarchical SVMs. This paper first describes our system in Sec. 1, and then discusses the computational complexity in Sec. 2. After that it presents the accuracies, hardware settings and running time of our system in the tasks in Sec. 3. Finally it gives our conclusions and future works in Sec. 4. 1 Algorithmic Description The work flow of our system is that it first performs TFIDF feature indexing on the samples [1], then simplifies the hierarchy of classes, then searches for the optimal parameter of SVM on each node by the training set and the validation set, then trains a decision tree of SVMs, at <b>last</b> <b>uses</b> <b>it</b> to classify test samples. In the formal task (the large dataset), the training is performed on both the training set and the validation set, which is officially allowed. The rest of this section describes two key issues of simplifying hierarchies and using multiclass SVMs as base classifiers...|$|R
