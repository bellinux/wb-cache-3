50|$|The Orange Grove {{affair was}} a {{political}} scandal in Australia concerning the dealings of the New South Wales state Australian Labor Party government with multinational corporation The Westfield Group. It resulted from a court decision in 2004 to force {{the closure of the}} Orange Grove shopping centre after a zoning dispute, with the loss of approximately 200 jobs. Westfield, who owned a nearby shopping centre, had challenged the legitimacy of the Orange Grove centre, which was operating on <b>land</b> <b>not</b> <b>zoned</b> for this purpose.|$|E
40|$|I {{model the}} impact of {{mitigation}} banking accompanied by Safe Harbor provisions on a land-owner’s choices about supporting a population of an endangered species. The Safe Harbor provision is equivalent to a free call option on a population with market value, and mitigation banking can allow a landowner with an endangered species to arbitrage between land without and with permission to develop. A land-owner whose <b>land</b> is <b>not</b> <b>zoned</b> for development may therefore stand to beneÞt from the discovery of an endangered species on his land...|$|R
5000|$|Generally, {{existing}} {{development in}} a community is not affected by the new zoning laws because it is [...] "grandfathered" [...] or legally non-conforming as a nonconforming use, meaning the prior development is exempt from compliance. Consequently, zoning may only affect new {{development in a}} growing community. In addition, if undeveloped land is zoned to allow development, that land becomes relatively expensive, causing developers to seek <b>land</b> that is <b>not</b> <b>zoned</b> for development with the intention to seek rezoning of that land. Communities generally react by <b>not</b> <b>zoning</b> undeveloped <b>land</b> to allow development until a developer requests rezoning and presents a suitable plan. Development under this practice appears to be piecemeal and uncoordinated. Communities try to influence the timing of development by government expenditures for new streets, sewers, and utilities usually desired for modern developments. Contrary to federal recommendations discouraging it, the development of interstate freeways for purposes unrelated to planned community growth, creates an inexorable rush to develop the relatively cheap land near interchanges. Property tax suppression measures such as California Proposition 13 have led many communities desperate to capture sales tax revenue to disregard their comprehensive plans and rezone undeveloped land for retail establishments.|$|R

50|$|In 1997 and 1998, Victor Greig {{acted as}} York's {{representative}} in building and zoning matters as the community developed Tama-Re. He was cited by Putnam County Sheriff Howard Sills for building without a permit and for illegally operating a nightclub in a warehouse, which was <b>not</b> <b>zoned</b> for that use. Greig was fined $45,750 in April 1998 and appealed. His fine {{was reduced to}} $2,500, but the conviction upheld.|$|R

5000|$|The act only {{addresses}} the hazard of surface fault rupture {{and does not}} address other earthquake hazards. The Seismic Hazards Mapping Act, passed in 1990, addresses non-surface fault rupture earthquake hazards, including liquefaction and seismically induced landslides.The act only applies to faults which are [...] "sufficiently active" [...] and [...] "well defined"- for example the 1994 Northridge earthquake occurred on a blind thrust fault <b>not</b> <b>zoned</b> by the act {{because of a lack}} of surface evidence.|$|R
50|$|According to the 2000 U.S. Census, SoDo has a {{population}} of 2,602, with a median age of 41.2; 458 residences are owner-occupied and 536 are rented. (This probably slightly understates the population, because there are a certain number of artists living illegally in studio spaces that are <b>not</b> <b>zoned</b> residential, plus a resident homeless population.) The average annual household income is given as $42,208; the racial breakdown is 41% White, 28% Asian, 14% Black, 9% Hispanic/Latino, 3% American Indian/Alaska Native, and 5% other.|$|R
2500|$|Like the piers to it south, its {{historic}} uses were superseded by containerization, {{and it was}} remodeled to house shops and restaurants. Triad Development bought the pier in 1995, and in the late 1990s it was remodeled as a headquarters for Go2Net, which was merged into InfoSpace, and fared poorly in the 2000–2001 crash that followed the dot-com bubble. Immediately before that remodel, in 1998 [...] was filmed there. Because the Central Waterfront piers are <b>not</b> <b>zoned</b> residential, the building was officially a 24-hour-a-day film set for the shoot.|$|R
50|$|In the past, Fort Hamilton has {{consistently}} ranked {{as one of}} the most populous high schools and the population is still gradually increasing. In December 2007 Fort Hamilton had 4,539 students, but in February 2010 that number declined to 4,198 (cite). For the 2014-2015 school year the population has risen to 4,372. Now in order to be admitted if <b>not</b> <b>zoned</b> to Fort Hamilton HS, one must apply and be accepted to either the Honors Academy or The Performing Arts program (Instrumental and Vocal) and the newly introduced Joffrey Ballet Academy for dance.|$|R

50|$|The mall offered {{incentives}} such as free {{rent for}} a period to lure businesses back into the mall. Event planners were given {{the use of the}} mall corridors to hold events to draw in potential shoppers. However, no major corporations bit. Event planners hit snags, as Union City required permits and variances, as the mall was <b>not</b> <b>zoned</b> for assembly usage. Some events such as an En Vogue concert, the annual Union City Mayor's Race, and Race Against Cancer did draw numbers. However, few people actually went inside the mall.|$|R
50|$|The North Bellmore {{students}} {{go to the}} schools that they are zoned for. However, Bellmore students in the same grade all {{go to the same}} school, as each grade level is in one of the three schools and not all. All Bellmore and North Bellmore Students go to Grand Avenue along with a few North Merrick Students who attended Park Avenue Elementary School, and then they split and go to their zoned school in the Central High School District. However, students <b>not</b> <b>zoned</b> for Calhoun may go to that school if they have a special interest in the arts.|$|R
5000|$|Garden Villas Elementary School {{was located}} {{at the head of}} the town plan {{established}} by Edward Wilkinson. As of 1988 the school has a 1932 two-story entrance block that has neo-Georgian detail and a two-story addition built in 1950, made by Harvin C. Moore and Stayton Nunn. As of 1988 HISD had plans to demolish both original sections.Schools serving the neighborhood include Garden Villas Elementary School, Hartman Middle School, and Sterling High School. Ortiz Middle School is adjacent to Garden Villas (Ortiz is on the other side of Telephone Road), yet Garden Villas students are <b>not</b> <b>zoned</b> to Ortiz. [...] Mount Carmel Academy, a charter school, is in Garden Villas.|$|R
5000|$|The Serra Fault is a {{low angle}} imbricate fault that has thrust older Franciscan Assemblage rocks and soils of the Merced Formation over the younger Colma Formation. The Serra Fault was {{originally}} zoned as potentially active by the State of California [...] under the mandated special studies for surface fault rupture. 1980s studies concluded that evidence for active Holocene age faulting (displacement within past 11,000 years) along the Serra Fault is lacking. [...] The Serra Fault is, therefore, <b>not</b> <b>zoned</b> for Special Studies by the State of California and is classified as Quaternary in age: that is, fault displacement within the past two million years.|$|R
5000|$|Land Use Planning and Approvals Act 1993 [...] {{requires}} {{local government}} authorities to create planning schemes and zone land for uses. Areas of land were zoned for forestry {{use as a}} permitted use. Other areas of land where forestry occurred, but <b>not</b> <b>zoned</b> with forestry as a permitted used, required a development permit from the local government authority. These development permits do not provide any certainty that the land owner {{would be able to}} harvest the wood grown. Permits are usually issued for native forest harvest and regeneration, or to establish a plantation, but did not explicitly create the right to harvest at a latter date.|$|R

50|$|In 1916 the Oklahoma Board of Commissioners {{passed an}} {{ordinance}} forbidding black residents from {{moving into a}} house on a block occupied by at least 75% white residents. Dunjee funded the cases of several black residents who were attempting to integrate areas <b>not</b> <b>zoned</b> for blacks. William Floyd was a black shoemaker who purchased a home in a majority-white neighborhood. Floyd was jailed four times for attempting to occupy his newly purchased home. Dunjee bailed Floyd out each time and encouraged {{him to return to}} the home. In this period the US Supreme Court ruled in Buchanan v. Warley (1917) that racially discriminatory state and local ordinances for housing were unconstitutional. A judge in Oklahoma ruled the state law was unconstitutional on those grounds.|$|R

50|$|Another type of loft {{conversion}} is converting non-residential spaces (most commonly warehouses, docks, former factories {{or water}} towers) into habitable homes. This form of loft conversion has {{its origins in}} the US. This form of loft first became popular in the SoHo section of New York City during the 1960s. Artists created living spaces on the upper levels of obsolete industrial buildings, sometimes located {{in the heart of}} the city. In the pioneering period of lofts, most SoHo buildings were <b>not</b> <b>zoned</b> as residential and the lofts were being used illegally as living space. In 1971, New York City legalized the residential use of space in SoHo, and loft living became popular throughout the neighborhood. Loft living spread to other previously industrial Manhattan neighborhoods including TriBeCa, Chelsea and Greenwich Village.|$|R
