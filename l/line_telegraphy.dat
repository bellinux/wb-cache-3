Asquith a deputation from the Scottish Temperance Legislation Board, who were campaigning {{for a change in}} the law to prohibit the sale of alcoholic liquor. He also pressed for more underground <b>telegraphy</b> <b>lines</b> between England and Scotland to aid communication.|$|R
2500|$|NRK started {{planning}} television broadcasts in 1950. It {{selected the}} internationally recommended 625 lines. A commission led by [...] considered three transmission techniques: physical distribution of film, coaxial cables and microwave radio relay. Coaxial was tested {{with the construction}} of a line from Oslo which from completed to Gjøvik in 1953 and to Bergen in 1957. The military opened a relay between Eastern Norway and Bergen in 1954 with 24 telephone <b>lines.</b> However, the <b>Telegraphy</b> Administration initially remained skeptical to the technology.|$|R

Only the units already mentioned and called for the preventive measures received orders to advance. Since {{the beginning of the}} revolution, members of the Carbonária had disconnected the <b>telegraphy</b> <b>lines,</b> thus impeding communication with units outside Lisbon. In addition, the rebels had cut off the railway tracks, which meant that even if the troops follow the orders to advance, they would never arrive on time. Reinforcements from the Setúbal peninsula were also unlikely to arrive, since the Tagus was controlled by rebel ships.|$|R
50|$|A {{few months}} after graduation, Pestana {{accepted}} an invitation to move to Rio Grande do Sul {{in order to work}} as an engineer of the State commission responsible for the Porto Alegre-Uruguaiana railway connection. The job would acquaint him with the peculiar politics of Rio Grande do Sul within the newly founded Brazilian Republic, uniquely fashioned by the Comte-inspired dictatorship of Governor Júlio de Castilhos. Pestana would also witness the Riograndense civil war of 1893-1895, one of the bloodiest conflicts in Brazilian history. Castilhos appointed him Director for State waterways in 1897 and for <b>telegraphy</b> <b>lines</b> in 1898.|$|R

50|$|Born on 30 March 1885, Algernon Fuller {{was educated}} at Bedford School {{and at the}} Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. He {{received}} his first commission in the Royal Engineers in 1904. He served during the First World War and, in 1916, he invented the Fullerphone, which enabled telephony and telegraphy to be used simultaneously on the same <b>line,</b> rendering the <b>telegraphy</b> secret. It was used widely during the First World War and thereafter, and Fuller was appointed as Experimental Officer at the Signals Experimental Establishment, Woolwich, between 1916 and 1920. He was Deputy Director of Mechanisation at the War Office, between 1938 and 1940, Director of Engineer and Signals Equipments at the Ministry of Supply, between 1940 and 1941, and Deputy Director-General of the Ministry of Supply, in 1941.|$|R
50|$|The {{prospect}} {{of setting up}} a <b>telegraphy</b> <b>line</b> between Chitral and headquarters of neighbouring Gilgit was discussed in 1892, during the life of Aman ul-Mulk. Following the Chitral Expedition an experimental telegraph line was installed over the Lowari. In 1903, {{during the reign of}} Shuja ul-Mulk, Chitral and Gilgit were connected via telegraph. In {{the next year or so}} telegraph and telephone were set up across the breath of the state connecting all headquarters. Thus the telephone became an integral part of the state machinery in conducting the affairs of the state. It is said that Shuja spent his early evenings on the telephone relaying and relieving messages from distant administrative units of the state to keep himself abreast. To operate and repair the machinery, technicians were called in from India.|$|R

Don't you know that his jokes are always so big and simple that one has never thought of them? Can you think of anything more like Sunday than this, that he should put all his powerful enemies on the Supreme Council, and then take care {{that it was not}} supreme? I tell you he has bought every trust, he has captured every cable, he has control of every railway line--especially of that railway line!" [...] and he pointed a shaking finger towards the small wayside station. [...] "The whole movement was controlled by him; half the world was ready to rise for him. But there were just five people, perhaps, who would have resisted him... and the old devil put them on the Supreme Council, to waste their time in watching each other. Idiots that we are, he planned the whole of our idiocies! Sunday knew that the Professor would chase Syme through London, and that Syme would fight me in France. And he was combining great masses of capital, and seizing great <b>lines</b> of <b>telegraphy,</b> while we five idiots were running after each other like a lot of confounded babies playing blind man's buff." ...|$|R
2500|$|A {{siege of}} Khartoum by the Mahdist forces {{commanded}} by the Mahdi himself started on 18 March 1884. Initially, {{the siege of}} Khartoum was more in nature a blockade rather than a true siege as the Mahdi's forces lacked the strength to wage a proper siege, for example only cutting the <b>telegraphy</b> <b>lines</b> in April 1884. The British had decided to abandon the Sudan, {{but it was clear}} that Gordon had other plans, and the public increasingly called for a relief expedition. Gordon's last telegrams were clearly meant for the British public with one message addressed to Baring reading: [...] "You state your intention of not sending any relief force up here to Berber...I shall hold on here as long as I can, and if I can suppress the rebellion, I shall do so. If I cannot, I shall retire to the Equator and leave you with the indelible disgrace of abandoning the garrisons".|$|R
50|$|Utah's Mormon settlers—members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or LDS Church—had {{supplied}} labor, food, {{and transportation}} for the line, along with poles for about 1000 mi of its length. Church President Brigham Young served as contractor for supplying {{the materials and}} labor, bring $11,000 in gold to the LDS Church ($ in today's terms). Completion of the transcontinental line {{raised the question of}} constructing another line to connect the numerous Mormon settlements in the Utah Territory. In February 1861, Brigham Young expressed his desire for a local territorial <b>line,</b> and a <b>telegraphy</b> school was established in Salt Lake City. Yet construction on the line was not started until 1865, due mainly to complications caused by the American Civil War.On November 9, 1865 a letter was published by the Deseret News from LDS Church Headquarters to the various leaders in settlements up and down the territory. The letter included instructions that each settlement would be responsible for constructing the segment of the line near their community, and laid out steps that needed to be completed immediately. Money or other means were collected to purchase the wires, insulators, and other equipment, while poles—22 feet long, and as straight as possible—were to be cut and placed by the settlers. The co-operative efforts of the line's construction made it the first publicly constructed and owned telegraph line in the United States.|$|R
50|$|The first {{semaphore}} <b>telegraphy</b> <b>line</b> {{was established}} in 1794 between Paris and Lille. The French network extended over 5,000 km with 534 stations serving 29 towns. Installed in 1834, the line linking Avignon to Narbonne, via Valros, was functioning until 1853. The semaphore network was then replaced by electric telegraphy. The tours de Chappe (Chappe towers), every 12 km or so, were built on high points. Each station was equipped with a mechanism for transmission and two telescopes to receive a message and to control its onward transmission. The mechanism consisted of a vertical mast supporting a 4.60 m long movable arm, the regulateur. At {{either end of the}} latter was a secondary arm, 2 m long, the indicateurs. The mast extended down into the interior of the tower into a tight room, 3 m by 3 m, sheltering the stationnaire, the solitary worker glued to his telescopes. For speed, and confidentiality, messages were encoded using a table where each figure signified a word or phrase. To transmit a message, the regulateur was placed either horizontally or vertically. The indicateurs were articulated every 45o, with 7 positions for each. This gave a total of 98 combinations (7 X 7 X 2), of which six were reserved for the service - the only ones whose meanings were known to the stationnaire. The total repertoire of messages was, therefore, 92 pages of 92 lines, a total of 8,464. Signals were sent in groups of two: the first number for the number of the page, the second for the number of the line on that page.|$|R

If I cannot, I shall retire to the Equator and leave you with the indelible disgrace of abandoning the garrisons". Gladstone was opposed to hanging onto the Sudan, saying in a speech in the House of Commons that sending a relief force to Khartoum would be [...] "a war of conquest against a people struggling to be free. Yes, these are people struggling to be free and rightly struggling to be free". Khartoum was surrounded by the Ansar in March 1884, but was not cut off from the outside world for a considerable time afterwards. Gordon's armoured steamers continued to sail in and out of Khartoum with little difficulty {{for the first six months}} of the siege, and it was not until September 1884 that the armoured steamers first had trouble reaching the city. Gordon himself had a low opinion of his enemy, writing that the Ansar besieging him were [...] "some 500 determined men and some 2, 000 rag-tag Arabs". Nutting wrote that Gordon [...] "could have withdrawn at almost any moment between March and May" [...] if only he had been willing. The American historian James Perry wrote: [...] "But instead of following instructions, he stayed put, longing for martyrdom. It wasn't exactly fair to the Egyptian garrisons he had been sent to evacuate; they had no death wish". On 25 July 1884, the Cabinet over the objections of the Prime Minister voted to send a relief expedition to Khartoum. On 5 August 1884, the House of Commons voted to send the relief force with a budget of £300,000.|$|R
