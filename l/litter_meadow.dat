Background Concern {{about the}} decline of farmland fauna emerged in the late 1960 's (Carson, 1962) and has amplified until today (Chamberlain et al., 2000; Krebs et al., 1999; Robinson & Sutherland, 2002; Scherr & McNelly, 2007). As a response, most countries have implemented agri-environmental schemes (AES), in which farmers are financially supported to modify their farming practice to provide environmental benefits. Agri-environmental schemes mostly aim at protecting and restoring farmland biodiversity (Kleijn & Sutherland, 2003). They are voluntary programmes in which farmers usually receive direct payments for providing services that go beyond current good agricultural practices, such as management of semi-natural habitats. Currently, 25 % of European farmland is under some sort of agrienvironmental contract (Kleijn et al., 2001). Hay and <b>litter</b> <b>meadow</b> {{are among the most}} common type of surfaces integrated in European AES. The most important management action on these surfaces is mowing...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Species pool theory {{claims that}} {{diaspore}} and microsite availability limit species richness in plant communities. Wet <b>meadows</b> (Calthion) and <b>litter</b> <b>meadows</b> (Molinion, Caricion davallianae) {{belonging to the}} most species-rich meadows {{in the foothills of}} the Alps have suffered from a strong decrease since the 1970 s. Restoration efforts including nutrient impoverishment and rewetting management after drainage and fertilization did not result in the re-establishment of the former species richness although the abiotic filter would have been appropriate for the re-colonization of many locally extinct species. In our experiment at four sites in the largest fen of Southwest-Germany we tested if the restoration success was seed- and gap-limited. We applied sowing and hay spreading (hay seed) as treatments to make seeds available and harrowing to increase gap availability. Sowing seeds or hay seed of species of the former meadow types increased species richness immediately. The proportion of re-established species was higher when additional harrowing was applied. Species richness could be increased not only in vascular plants but also in bryophytes when hay spreading was applied. The strongest re-development towards the target communities (defined through the abiotic filter and the species richness before drainage and fertilization) took place on those sites where hay spreading and harrowing were applied. Sowing seeds and hay seed were traditional techniques to establish e. g. <b>litter</b> <b>meadows,</b> both techniques have been applied for centuries.

40|$|Questions: 1. To {{what extent}} does light {{availability}} differ among fen plant communities? 2. To what extent does light coincide with productivity and moisture gradients? 3. Does light {{act as an}} important environmental filter in natural and transformed riparian landscapes? Location: Current data from the Biebrza Valley, NE Poland; literature data from the Trebon area, Czech Republic and four sites in the western and southern Netherlands. Methods: Relative light intensity (RLI) was measured in vertical profiles, next to vegetation releves accompanied by measurements of above-ground biomass, summer groundwater level, N and P content in vegetation, pH and soil redox potential. Data derived from literature included profiles of RLI, biomass and vegetation records. Relationships between RLI and biomass and between species distribution, RLI and other variables were examined by regression analysis and CCA. Four traits were analysed: ability to spread clonally, seed weight, maximum height of adults and time of commencement of flowering. Results: RLI at ground level varied from 60 % in sedge-moss communities and <b>litter</b> <b>meadows.</b> RLI was largely determined by the standing crop and explained {{a large part of}} variation in species occurrence. The combinations of analysed functional traits were constrained by the communities' light profiles. Conclusion: Light availability is related more closely to site fertility than to hydrological regime. This confirms that hydrological regime and productivity should be analysed separately with regard to their effect on species distribution in wetlands. Limited light availability seems the major environmental control of the distribution of low growing and late flowering species...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} of landscape matrix on functional connectivity has been clearly established. Now methods {{to assess the}} effects of different land uses on species' movements are needed because current methods are often biased. The use of physiological parameters as indicators {{of the level of}} resistance to animal move- ment associated with different land uses (i. e., matrix resistance) could provide estimates of energetic costs and risks to animals migrating through the matrix. To assess whether corticosterone levels indicate matrix resistance, we conducted experiments on substrate choice and measured levels of corticosterone before and after exposure of toads (Bufo bufo) to 3 common substrates (ploughed soil, <b>meadow,</b> and forest <b>litter).</b> We expected matrix resistance and hormone levels to increase from forest litter (habitat of the toad) to meadows to ploughed soil. Adult toads had higher corticosterone levels on ploughed soil than on forest <b>litter</b> or <b>meadow</b> substrates. Hormone levels did not differ between forest <b>litter</b> and <b>meadow.</b> Toads avoided moving onto ploughed soil. Corticosterone levels in juvenile toads were not related to substrate type; however, hormone levels decreased as humidity increased. Juveniles, unlike adults, did not avoid moving over ploughed soil. The difference in responses between adult and juvenile toads may have been due to differences in experimental design (for juveniles, entire body used to measure corticosterone concentration; for adults, saliva alone); differences in the scale of sensory perception of the substrate (juveniles are much smaller than adults); or differences in cognitive processes between adult and juvenile toads. Adults probably had experience with different substrate types, whereas juveniles first emerging from the water probably did not. As a consequence, arable lands could act as ecological traps for juvenile toads...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the present-day vegetation, stratigraphy and developmental {{history of the}} mire of Egelsee-Moor (Salzburg, Austria; 45 ° 45 ′N, 13 ° 8. 5 ′E, 700 m a. s. l., 15 ha in area) since the early Late Glacial {{on the basis of}} 4 transects with 14 trial borings across the peatland. We present a vegetation map of the mire, a longitudinal section through the peat body based on six cores showing the peat types, overview macrofossil diagrams of six cores showing the local mire development and two pollen diagrams covering the Late Glacial and Holocene. The chronology of the diagrams depends on biostratigraphic dating for the Late Glacial and early Holocene and radiocarbon dating for the remaining Holocene. The northern part of the mire originated through terrestrialisation of nutrient-rich, mostly inundated fen and the southern part through paludification of wet soils. The very small lake of today was a reservoir until recently for providing water-power for timber rafting (‘Holztrift’). The mire vegetation today is a complex of forested parts (mainly planted Pinus sylvestris and Thuja occidentalis, but also spontaneous Picea abies, Betula pubescens and Frangula alnus), reed-lands (Phragmites) and <b>litter</b> <b>meadows</b> (Molinietum, Schoenetum, etc.). The central part has hummock-hollow complexes with regionally rare species of transitional mires (Drosera anglica, D. intermedia, Lycopodiella inundata, Scorpidium scorpioides, Sphagnum platyphyllum, S. subnitens). The results indicate that some of the mid-Holocene sediments may have been removed by the timber-rafting practices, and that water extraction from the hydrological catchment since 1967 has resulted in a partial shift of transitional mire to ombrotrophic bog. The latter potentially endangers the regionally rare species and was used as an argument to stop further water extraction...|$|R

40|$|The {{spectrum}} and occurrence of entomopathogenic fungi in <b>litter</b> beech forest. <b>meadow</b> soil and arable soil were evaluated using an "insect bait method". Soil and litter samples taken in autumn and spring from each stand were baited with G. mellonella larvae at 22 °C. Six species of entomopathogenic fungi infected these larvae. In the litter Beauveria bassiana was the dominant species. Besides B. bassiana, 23 % of G. mellonella larvae were infected by Paecilomyces farinosus in autumn. In the forest soil the dominant entomopathogenic fungus was not found. In this stand {{the number of}} infected larvae was the lowest. Metarhizium anisopliae was the dominant species in the meadow soil in both sampling periods. In the soil taken from a rye field P. fumosoroseus and B. bassiana infected G. mellonella larvae almost to the same degree. It was established that B. bassiana and M. anisopliae infected more G. mellonella larvae in spring than in autumn. In the case of P. farinosus and P. fumosoroseus an opposite tendency was observed...|$|R
5000|$|Optimal meadow vole habitat {{consists}} of moist, dense grassland with {{substantial amounts of}} plant litter. Habitat selection is largely influenced by relative ground cover of grasses and forbs; soil temperature, moisture, sodium, potassium, and pH levels; humidity; and interspecific competition. Meadow voles are most commonly associated with sites having high soil moisture. [...] They are often restricted to the wetter microsites when they occur in sympatry with prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) or montane voles. [...] In an Iowa prairie restoration project, meadow voles experienced an initial population increase during the initial stage of vegetation succession (old field dominated by foxtail grass (Setaria spp.), red clover (Trifolium pratense), annual ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia), alfalfa (Medicago sativa), and thistles Cirsium spp.). However, populations reached their peak abundance during the perennial grass stage of succession from old field to tallgrass prairie. Meadow vole habitat devoid of tree cover and grasses dominated the herb layer. [...] with low tolerance for habitat variation (i. e., a species that is intolerant of variations in habitat, is restricted to few habitats, and/or uses habitats less evenly than tolerant species). In most areas, meadow voles clearly prefer habitat with dense vegetation. In tallgrass prairie at Pipestone National Monument, they were positively associated with dense vegetation and litter. [...] The variables important to meadow vole habitat in Virginia include vegetative cover reaching a height of 8 to 16 inches (20-41 cm) and presence of <b>litter.</b> [...] <b>Meadow</b> voles appeared to be randomly distributed within a grassland habitat in southern Quebec.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{short-term}} grazing by reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) on birch (Betula pubescens), grasses, herbs and plant <b>litter</b> in coastal <b>meadows</b> in spring were investigated in grazed and control plots in 1996 and 1997. The meadow contained 29 different plant species, {{all but one}} of which (Deschampsia caespitosa) were intensively grazed by reindeer. Young birch eaten by reindeer did not increase in mean height (9 cm), while birch protected from grazing grew from 9 to 22 cm (P&lt; 0. 05) during the two years of the experiment. The ratio of grasses to herbs was higher (P&lt; 0. 05) in the grazed plots than in the control plots, and the relative abundace of grasses increased during the summer in both years. The abundance of Rumex asetosa and Alchemilla subcrenata decreased (P&lt; 0. 05) in response to grazing. From spring 1996, plant litter increased (P&lt; 0. 05) on the control plots until the investigation came to an end in spring 1998, unlike grazed vegetation. Reindeer affects the coastal meadows in northern Norway in spring by browsing on birch and grazing on herbs and grass which in the long term might influence the cultural landscape in favour of the growth of grass species...|$|R
40|$|Litter, as afterlife of plants, {{plays an}} {{important}} role in driving belowground decomposition processes. Here we tested effects of litter species identity and diversity on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics during litter decomposition in N-limited alpine meadow soil from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. We incubated <b>litters</b> of four <b>meadow</b> species, a sedge ("S", Kobresia humilis), a grass ("G", Elymus nutans), a herb ("H", Saussurea superba), and a legume ("L", Oxytropis falcata), in monoculture and in mixture with meadow soil. CO 2 release was measured 21 times during the incubation, and soil available N and microbial biomass C and N were measured before and after the experiment. The organic C decay rate did not differ much among soils amended with monocultures or mixtures of litter, except in the H, S, L, and S+H treatments, which had much higher decay rates. Potential decomposable C pools were lowest in the control, highest in the L treatment, and intermediate in the S treatment. Mineralized N was completely immobilized by soil microbes in all treatments except the control, S+L, and S+G+L treatments. Litter mixtures had both additive and non-additive effects on CO 2 -C emission (mainly antagonistic effects), net N mineralization (mainly synergistic), and microbial biomass C and N (both). Overall, these parameters were not significantly correlated with litter species richness. Similarly, microbial C or N was not significantly correlated with litter N content or C/N. However, cumulative CO 2 -C emission and net N mineralization were positively correlated with litter N content and negatively correlated with litter C/N. Litter N content and C/N rather than litter species richness drove the release of CO 2 -C and net available N in this ecosystem. The antagonistic effects of litter mixtures contributed to a modest release of CO 2 -C, but their synergistic effects enhanced net available N. We suggest that in alpine meadow communities, balancing species with high and low N contents will benefit soil carbon sequestration and plant competition for available N with soil microbes...|$|R
