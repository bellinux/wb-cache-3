60|$|Naturally enough, I {{thought of}} Don Quixote. Recollecting how the knight and Sancho had watched for auguries {{when they took}} the road to Toboso, I began, between jest and earnest, to feel a similar anxiety. It was gratified, and by a more poetical {{phenomenon}} than the braying of the dappled ass or the neigh of Rosinante. The sun, then just above the horizon, shone faintly through the fog, and formed a species of rainbow in the west, bestriding my intended road like a gigantic portal. I had never known before that a bow could be generated between the sunshine and the morning mist. It had no brilliancy, no perceptible hues, but was a mere unpainted framework, as white and ghostlike as the <b>lunar</b> <b>rainbow,</b> which is deemed ominous of evil. But, with a light heart, to which all omens were propitious, I advanced beneath the misty archway of futurity.|$|E

"On leaving Vauxhall," [...] {{says his}} lordship, [...] "we drank {{a bottle of}} Madeira, as a health to the friends from whom we parted, and crunched a few {{biscuits}} to support nature during the hours before lunch. In two hours we arrived at Canterbury, enveloped in clouds: lunch, bottled porter: at Dover, carried several miles in a tide of air, bitter cold, cherry-brandy; crossed over the Channel safely, and thought with pity of the poor people who were sickening in the steamboats below: more bottled porter: over Calais, dinner, roast-beef of Old England; near Dunkirk,--night falling, <b>lunar</b> <b>rainbow,</b> brandy-and-water; night confoundedly thick; supper, nightcap of rum-punch, and so to bed. The sun broke beautifully through the morning mist, as we boiled the kettle and took our breakfast over Cologne. In {{a few more hours}} we concluded this memorable voyage, and landed safely at Weilburg, in good time for dinner." ...|$|E

60|$|I nodded, {{knowing full}} well the {{spectacle}} of those lava leagues of weather coast, truly iron-bound so far as landing-places or anchorages were concerned, great forbidding cliff-walls thousands of feet in height, their summits wreathed in cloud and rain squall, their knees hammered by the trade-wind billows into spouting, spuming white, the air, from sea to rain-cloud, spanned by a myriad leaping waterfalls, provocative, in day or night, of countless sun and <b>lunar</b> <b>rainbows.</b> Valleys, so called, but fissures rather, slit the cyclopean walls here and there, and led away into a lofty and madly vertical back country, most of it inaccessible {{to the foot of}} man and trod only by the wild goat.|$|R
25|$|Another text, Health Benefits of the Bedchamber, {{indicates}} that certain times were better for intercourse than others. A person had {{to avoid having}} intercourse on quarter or full moons and on days when there were great winds, rain, fog, cold or heat, thunder, lightning, darkness over heaven and earth, solar and <b>lunar</b> eclipses, <b>rainbows</b> and earthquakes. Having intercourse at these times would harm a man's spirit and would cause women to become ill. Children conceived at these times would be mad, stupid, perverse or foolish; mute, deaf, crippled or blind; unfilial and violent.|$|R

5000|$|In the 1978 Russian novel (and film) <b>Lunar</b> <b>Rainbow</b> (Лунная радуга), {{written by}} S.I. Pavlov (Сергей Павлов), astronauts on Oberon become {{infected}} {{with a strange}} disease that gives them supernatural powers, but which ultimately {{turns out to be}} intelligent alien microorganisms from another planetary system. [...] The sequel [...] "Soft Mirrors" [...] (1983) features other Uranian moons as well.|$|E
50|$|The rainbow {{effect is}} also {{commonly}} seen near waterfalls or fountains. In addition, the {{effect can be}} artificially created by dispersing water droplets into the air during a sunny day. Rarely, a moonbow, <b>lunar</b> <b>rainbow</b> or nighttime rainbow, {{can be seen on}} strongly moonlit nights. As human visual perception for colour is poor in low light, moonbows are often perceived to be white.|$|E
50|$|A moonbow (also {{known as}} a <b>lunar</b> <b>rainbow</b> or white rainbow), is a rainbow {{produced}} by moonlight rather than sunlight. Other than the difference in light source, its formation {{is exactly the same}} as for a solar rainbow: It is caused by the refraction of light in many water droplets, such as a rain shower or a waterfall, and is always positioned in the opposite part of the sky from the moon relative to the observer.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the college}} is in Williamsburg, it is 18 mi away Cumberland Falls State Resort Park in the Daniel Boone National Forest. The park {{is the home}} of Cumberland Falls, {{sometimes}} called the Little Niagara, the Niagara of the South or the Great Falls and is the only venue in the Western Hemisphere where a moonbow or <b>lunar</b> <b>rainbow</b> is regularly visible on a clear night with a full moon.

50|$|Like most {{atmospheric}} optical phenomena, rainbows can {{be caused}} by light from the Sun, but also from the Moon. In case of the latter, the rainbow is referred to as a <b>lunar</b> <b>rainbow</b> or moonbow. They are much dimmer and rarer than solar rainbows, requiring the Moon to be near-full {{in order for them to}} be seen. For the same reason, moonbows are often perceived as white and may be thought of as monochrome. The full spectrum is present, however, but the human eye is not normally sensitive enough to see the colours. Long exposure photographs will sometimes show the colour in this type of rainbow.|$|E
5000|$|Williamsburg {{is located}} 18 mi away Cumberland Falls State Resort Park within the Daniel Boone National Forest. The park {{is the home}} of Cumberland Falls, {{sometimes}} called the Little Niagara, the Niagara of the South or the Great Falls and is the only venue in the Western Hemisphere where a moonbow or <b>lunar</b> <b>rainbow</b> is regularly visible on a clear night with a full moon. On average the falls, which flow over a resistant sandstone bed, are 68 feet (21 m) high and 125 feet (38 m) wide, with an average water flow of [...] per second (100 m³/s).Trails winding downstream from the park {{on either side of the}} river lead to the smaller Angel Falls and Dog Slaughter Falls. Angel Falls is located 1.5 mi from the park on the McCreary County side and Dog Slaughter Falls is located 3.5 mi from the park on the Whitley County side. The Below the Falls section of the river includes a five-mile (8 km) long class 2-3 run that is ideal for families and beginner stage white water rafters and kayakers.|$|E

Eponyms for this release meteor The terms for the omics community in our envoEmpo. owl subset This release features {{a wide range of}} new classes and improved axiomatisation across ENVO; however, it is primarily driven by requests from the Earth Microbiome Project to axiomatise and integrate the project's EMPO vocabulary into ENVO and other ontologies. Several lake-releated classes are being created to support the AquaDiva project and foundational semantics for extending atmospheric semantics have been developed. The continuation of work with CESAB and the generation of this synthesis centre's subset In addition, more upper-level classes from BFO have been imported to begin the restructuring of ENVO's branches for improved axiomatisation, interoperation with other OBO resources, and clarity. Users should prepare for the environmental feature branch to be markedly restructured (most individual PURLs will not be affected, only their positioning and axioms). :warning: Dead Simple Design Patterns were used to generate classes not mentioned in this note. Work is underway to integrate reporting into future release notes.
