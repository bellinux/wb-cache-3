40|$|A {{shortcoming}} of the <b>laminated</b> <b>bending</b> {{process is}} that the products may become distorted after moulding and during use. Annually, significant financial losses have incurred in the furniture and interior design industries {{as a result of}} distorted products. In this study, we have examined the influence of deviation of fibre orientation of individual veneers on distortion of a moulded shell to find ways to improve shape stability of laminated veneer products. Ninety cross-laminated shells, consisting of 7 veneers of Birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) with a total thickness of 3. 6 mm, were studied. The in-plane dimensions of the veneer were 400 x 660 mm. All the veneers were straight-grained, but to simulate deviation in fibre orientation some of the individual veneers were oriented 7 degrees relative to the main orientation of the other veneers in the laminate. Distortion was determined directly after moulding and after storage in a changing relative humidity. The results show the well-known fact that deviation of fibre orientation of the veneers in the laminate influences the shape stability of the product. The results from this study, however, also show how the placement of the abnormal veneers in the laminated veneer products influences the degree of distortions. From this basic knowledge some improvements for production of laminated veneer products were suggested. Godkänd; 2013; 20130910 (ysko...|$|E
40|$|To ensure {{success in}} the {{production}} of laminated veneer products, it is necessary to acquire a sound basic understanding of the behaviour of the wood, and to understand the inherent reactions of wood to adhesive, heat, moisture, strain and stress. This can ensure an efficient wood utilization and promote the development of new processes and products that take advantage of the visco-elastic nature of wood. A shortcoming of the <b>laminated</b> <b>bending</b> process is that the products may become distorted after moulding and during use. In this study, we have examined how the performance of laminated veneer products can be improved through the implementation of basic knowledge of wood in the design and production process. The results show that the material and process parameters and storage in a changing relative humidity have a clear impact on distortion. Fibre orientation of the veneers in the moulded assembly was the most critical parameter to control. Fibre deviations mainly resulted in twist of the product. A moisture content in one veneer deviating from that {{of the rest of the}} veneers in the assembly before moulding resulted in distortion of the laminated veneer products both after moulding and during use. To decrease the negative effect of fibre orientation and moisture content on shape stability, the veneer should be straight-grained and well-conditioned to a moisture level adapted to the use of the final product. Special care should also be taken to orientate the veneers during assembly before moulding. Godkänd; 2014; 20131112 (ysko); Konferensartikel i tidskrif...|$|E

40|$|Steady state creep of {{a hybrid}} metal-composite <b>laminated</b> <b>bending</b> beams of {{irregular}} patterns is considered. Beams consist of walls and load-bearing layers, attached {{at the top}} and bottom (shelves). The shelves are reinforced with fibers in the longitudinal direction, and the walls are reinforced either longitudinally or cross in the plane. Under the hypotheses of the Timoshenko theory the boundary value problem is formulated for the calculation of the considered beams, which allows taking into account the weakened resistance of the walls of the transverse shifts. The simple iteration method based on the idea of the secant modulus method is applied for linearization of the problem. The mechanical behavior of reinforced and unreinforced double seat beams and cantilevers in conditions of steady creep under the action of uniformly distributed transverse load is investigated. Cross sections of beams are I-shaped. It is shown that for homogeneous I-beams, the classical Bernoulli theory does not guarantee the calculated results in compliance within 20 % accuracy, which is considered to be acceptable if the width of the shelf is comparable with the height of cross sections of beams. In the cases of metal-composite beams, the classical theory becomes generally unacceptable, because it lowers by several orders of magnitude the compliance of such structures in conditions of steady creep. It is demonstrated that the rate of shear strain, actively developing in their walls, must be considered. The consideration of these strain rates {{within the framework of the}} Timoshenko theory led to the discovery of new mechanisms of deformation of laminated beams which the classical theory does not find. It is shown that the change in mechanism of deformation can occur by increasing the density of reinforcement of shelves or walls...|$|E
40|$|<b>Laminated</b> <b>bending</b> of veneers {{mean that}} dried, thin veneers or thin wood sheets are glued {{together}} {{under influence of}} pressure and eventually increased temperature. At {{the same time the}} product is given its desired shape, most often curved. This thermo hydro mechanical process offers several benefits. For example thick bends of small radiuses of any species of wood may be formed and poor quality wood containing knots, splits and other defects may be utilised. Laminated bends can usually be set more readily and made to conform better to the shape of the form than similar bends of solid wood. Further no softening treatment is generally required before the pieces are bent. However, there are also disadvantages e. g. more technical skill and better equipment are usually required than for solid wood bending. The presence of glue may be somewhat detrimental to the machines used for the final cleaning up of the bent pieces. Further the glue lines which are usually visible on the sides may be an aesthetical unappreciated effect [1],[2]. The quality of the laminated bended veneer products are obtained as an interaction between the process, the veneers and the glue [3]. In industries designing and producing these products it is of interest to obtain better understanding of how processing- and material parameters affect the product quality. With an improved understanding of the material and processing parameters {{it may be possible to}} increase the efficiency of wood utilisation and promote the development of new processes and products that manipulate the viscoelastic nature of wood. In particular the possibilities to obtain narrower radius of curvature and better possibilities of bending in more than one plane would be advantageous. This study has focused on the moisture content (MC) and the grain angle orientation in the veneers. These two specific aspects were assumed to have a great influence on spring-back and distortions of the laminated bended veneer products. Spring-back and distortions were therefore studied in separate tests where MC and the grain angle orientation was varied separately in manufactured laminated bended wood products. After manufacturing the products were exposed to variations in humidity and temperature whereupon the spring-back and distortions were measuredThree tests were performed. For the first and the second test a seat shell was selected as test product, figure 1 a. To the third test another product was selected, figure 1 b. This product was a small bookshelf. The company producing this shelf had experienced large problems considering distortions of this product. Further the product was very simple in shape with only one bend and therefore suitable for measurements. In the first test the influence of MC of the veneers was investigated. In the second and third test the influence of grain angle of the veneers was studied. For the study veneers of birch and beech were selected in the production. For the first and third study only birch veneers were used. The veneers were initially conditioned to equilibrium moisture contents (EMC) according to setups in different test groups. For the first study a test group was also built up from veneers taken directly out of production to study the industrial conditions. The seat shells in this test group contained veneers conditioned to EMC 4 %, except for the surface veneers that had been stored in the production hall. The humidity and temperature conditions in this room corresponded to MC 7 %. The manufacturing of the products were performed in industrial conditions. In the tests the products were built up from a number of veneers and the studied factors were varied between the veneers in a controlled manner. The results from the first test showed that the MC of the veneers influenced the spring-back and the distortions. A large moisture gradient between veneers and especially unsymmetrical placements of these in the construction were especially critical. The results from the second and third tests showed that grain angle deviation has large effect on the distortions of the products. Even a small grain angle deviation as in study two (5 °) resulted in large problems with distortions. The study also showed that when crossing two or more veneers with deviating grain angles there were cases when these faults interacted and multiplied the distortions. In production grain angle deviations can be a result of inaccurate placement of the veneers during pressing, incorrect cutting of the veneers, inherent from the growth of the tree or a combination of these factors. Deviations of the grain angle were, however, shown to have only small effects on spring-back. Upprättat; 2011; 20130911 (ysko...|$|E
40|$|In {{the elastic}} {{property}} characterization of composite laminates with liquid-coupled ultrasound, the stiffnesses {{that are most}} easily and accurately measured in conventional single-sided reflection geometries are those of least interest to structural design engineers.

(Further background on this topic can be found in recent reviews [7], [8].) This portion of the stiffness matrix is, however, of relatively little interest to most designers of composite structure.

Significant improvement in Mode I and II interlaminar toughness have been observed previously. In this work, several substructural in-plane strength tests relevant to aerostructures were undertaken: bolt/tension-bearing, open hole compression, and L-shape <b>laminate</b> <b>bending.</b> Improvements are observed for the nanostitched samples: critical bearing strength by 30 %, open-hole compression ultimate strength by 10 %, and L-shape laminate energy (via increased deflection) of 40 %. The mechanism of reinforcement is not compliant interlayer creation, but rather is a fiberstitching mechanism, as no increase in interlayer thickness occurs with the nanostitches. Unlike traditional (large-fiber/tow/pin) stitching or z-pinning techniques that damage inplane fibers and reduce laminate in-plane strengths, the nano-scale CNT-based ‘stitches’ improve in-plane strength, demonstrating the potential of such an architecture for aerospace structural applications. The quality of VACNT transfer to the prepreg laminates has not been optimized and therefore the noted enhancement to strength may be considered conservative. Ongoing work has been undertaken to both improve VACNT transfer and expand the data set. [URL] Institute of Technology (Nano-Engineered Composite aerospace STructures (NECST) Consortium...|$|R

The laminate is intended for a nautical application and the manufacturing technique is vacuum infusion. In a first part of the work, four impact velocities (1. 566 m/s, 2. 215 m/s, 3. 132 m/s and 3. 836 m/s) were considered, and a minimum of four specimens for any given velocity were subjected to forty repeated impacts or up to perforation. The impact response was evaluated in terms of damage progression by visual observation of the impacted specimens, evolution of the peak force and of the bending stiffness with the number of impacts and by calculating the damage degree (ratio between the absorbed energy and the impact energy). In a second part of the work, additional single impact tests were performed at 4. 429 m/s and 6. 264 m/s to investigate the laminate strain-rate sensitivity. Repeated impact tests pointed out that the delamination area grows very rapidly in the first few impacts to then level off, following closely the behaviour of the bending stiffness against the number of impacts. The value of the peak force increases in the first few impacts due to compaction and strain-hardening of the resin with a related decrease of the damage degree.

The element is used to analyze cross-ply and angle-ply <b>laminated</b> shells for <b>bending...</b>|$|R
