5000|$|There {{were two}} {{fundamental}} ideas {{built into the}} legislation. One was {{that there should be}} an overall authority, responsible for the main rivers in each of the catchment areas, who would work closely with Drainage Authorities, who would be responsible for the internal drainage of smaller areas within a catchment. The other was that the funding for the drainage work should be levied over a much wider area than had previously been the case. Since the Statute of Sewers of 1531, it had only been possible to collect drainage rates from people whose land benefitted directly from the drainage works, or whose land was saved from damage by them. The new Act swept this provision aside. The new Catchment Boards could now <b>levy</b> <b>rates</b> on the county councils and county borough councils throughout the entire catchment, not just on the low-lying parts of it, and could also <b>levy</b> <b>rates</b> on the internal drainage boards within their area. However, the 1930s were a time of economic uncertainty, and it was not always possible to <b>levy</b> <b>rates</b> at a level which would pay for drainage improvements. Thus the Somerset Catchment Board were able to improve regular maintenance of the main rivers in the Somerset Levels, but would have needed to raise between £5 and £6 per acre to fund improvements. In a time of agricultural depression and falling prices, such rates were unrealistic. Internal drainage boards raised their funding by a levy on the landowners and occupiers of those who lived within their district.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} China’s {{experience with}} the pollution levy, an emissions charge system which covers 300, 000 factories. Operation of the system has been well-documented since the mid- 1980 ’s, affording {{a unique opportunity to}} assess the implementation and impact of incentive-based regulation in a developing country. Although a uniform levy is established by China’s National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA), strictness of enforcement varies greatly across provinces. In addition, provinces can legally augment (but not undercut) the national rate with NEPA’s permission. The result is wide dispersion in the effective levy, or rate at which excess emissions are actually charged by provincial regulators. Using panel data for twenty-nine provinces during 1987 - 1993, we investigate the sources of variation in the effective levy with a model of ‘equilibrium pollution. ’ In this model, effective provincial levy rates and industrial emissions intensities are jointly determined at the intersection of environmental demand (ED) and supply (ES) functions. The ED function, which reflects differential abatement costs, relates industrial emissions intensity to the price of pollution and structural characteristics such as sector, scale and ownership. The ES function relates the provincial <b>levy</b> <b>rate</b> to two sets of variables which reflect differences in economi...|$|E
40|$|Although the Levy (stable-Paretian) {{distribution}} of stock returns was first observed by Mandelbrot 35 years ago, {{an explanation for}} this phenomenon {{has not yet been}} found. Several extensive studies have recently shown that short-term rates of return on stock indices and on single stocks are distributed according to the truncated Levy distribution. An apparently unrelated but well-documented fact is that wealth is distributed according to the Pareto-law distribution at high wealth levels. In this paper we suggest that the Levy {{distribution of}} rates of return originates from the Pareto-law wealth distribution among investors. We present a model which assumes i) a Pareto distribution of wealth and ii) that the effect an investor has on the price of a stock is proportional (in a ctochastic sense) to the investor’s wealth. This model generates a truncated Levy distribution of stock returns. This result is robust to many variations of the basic model. The model leads to the prediction that the parameter Al of the <b>Levy</b> <b>rate</b> of return distribution should be equal to the Pareto constant Aw of the Pareto wealth distribution. Empirical evidence from the U. S., the U. K. and France reveals a striking agreement between these a-priori unrelated parameters (U. S. : Al= 1. 39, Aw= 1. 35; U. K.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the intentions of Jakarta citizens with respect to the electronic road pricing (ERP) reform proposed by the city government. Utilizing data from a stated preference survey conducted in 2013, we construct six variables representing latent psychological motivations (appropriateness of ERP adoption; recognition that ERP can mitigate congestion and improve the environment; car dependency (CDC); awareness of the problems of cars in society; inhibition of freedom movement caused by ERP; and doubts about the ability of ERP to mitigate congestion and environment problems). A multiple-indicators multiple-causes (MIMIC) model is developed to investigate the effects of respondents’ socio-demographics (causes) on the latent constructs in order to gain better understanding of the relationship between respondents’ intentions and the observed individual’s responses (indicators) obtained from the stated preference survey. The MIMIC model offers a good account of whether and how socio-demographic attributes and individual indicators predict the latent variables of psychological motivation constructs. Then, we further verify the influences of the latent variables, combining them with <b>levy</b> <b>rate</b> patterns and daily mobility attributes to investigate significant determining factors for social acceptance of the ERP proposal. A latent variable representations based on the generalized ordered response model are employed in our investigations to allow more flexibility in parameter estimation across outcomes. The results confirm that there is a strong correlation between latent psychological motivations and daily mobility attributes and the level of social acceptance for the ERP proposal. This empirical investigation demonstrates that the latent variables play more substantial role in determining scheme’s acceptance. Moreover, elasticity measures show that latent attributes are more sensitive compared to levies and daily mobility attributes. Therefore, in order to gain the acceptance of the majority of road users, a gradual introduction of ERP may be needed to allow users to gain understanding of the scheme, thereby gaining a more acceptable response. The findings from this work should provide insight for the Jakarta government in designing a more effective and acceptable policy aiming at promoting the adoption of ERP in Jakarta...|$|E
