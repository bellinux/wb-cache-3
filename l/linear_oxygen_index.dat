40|$|International audienceThe oxygen {{concentration}} in the oxidizer stream (O- 2 + N- 2) of laminar coflow ethylene diffusion flames is varied from 17 % to 35 % in order to study its influence on the flame height, the soot formation/oxidation processes, the smoke point characteristics, and the vertical distributions of radiative flux {{at a distance of}} 6. 85 cm from the flame axis. Measured values for all the investigated parameters are compared with the predictions provided by a numerical model based on a two-equation semiempirical acetylene-based soot model and on the statistical narrow-band correlated-k model to compute thermal radiation. Predictions are in overall reasonable agreement with the experiments for <b>oxygen</b> <b>indices</b> in the range 19 - 35 %, whereas all the investigated parameters are significantly underestimated for an <b>oxygen</b> <b>index</b> of 17 %. Measured flame heights based on CH* emission below, at, or slightly above the smoke point, as well as predicted stoichiometric flame heights, are found to be proportional to xi = (V) over dot(f) [D-infinity In(1 + 1 /S) ](- 1) (T-infinity/T-ad) (0. 67), where (V) over dot(f), D-infinity, S, and T-ad are the volumetric flow rate of ethylene, the diffusion coefficient at ambient temperature, the stoichiometric molecular air-to-fuel ratio, and the adiabatic flame temperature. Soot formation processes are found to increase with the <b>oxygen</b> <b>index,</b> leading to higher values of the maximum soot volume fraction and the peak integrated soot volume fraction. In addition, the latter is reached at a nondimensional height (normalized by xi of approximately 0. 05, regardless of the <b>oxygen</b> <b>index</b> within the investigated range. Two regimes are evidenced: The first regime, occurring for <b>oxygen</b> <b>indices</b> lower than 25 %, is dominated by soot oxidation and is characterized by an enhancement in both the maximum soot volume fraction and the fuel flow rate at the smoke point with the <b>oxygen</b> <b>index.</b> The second regime, occurring for <b>oxygen</b> <b>indices</b> higher than 25 %, is dominated by soot formation; the rate of increase in the maximum soot volume fraction with the {{oxygen concentration}} is lower than in the first regime, whereas the fuel flow rate at the smoke point decreases. Finally, the peak of radiative flux increases with the <b>oxygen</b> <b>index,</b> but its rate of increase is also found to be considerably reduced for <b>oxygen</b> <b>indices</b> greater than 25 %.

30|$|The <b>oxygen</b> <b>index</b> {{test was}} {{conducted}} according to JIS K 7201 - 2 [16] using an <b>oxygen</b> <b>index</b> flammability tester (ON- 1, Suga test instruments Co., Ltd., Japan). This test measures the minimum concentration of <b>oxygen</b> (i.e., <b>oxygen</b> <b>index,</b> or limiting <b>oxygen</b> index: OI) in a flowing mixture of oxygen and nitrogen {{that is required}} to maintain flaming combustion of specimen. The specimen is ignited in the glass holder with the mixed flow of oxygen and nitrogen so the entire top tip of them is burning like a candle, and if the specimen burns for at least 3  min after the igniter is removed, or if the specimen burns down 50  mm, the oxygen concentration is judged above the <b>oxygen</b> <b>index</b> (OI). Instead, if the specimen stops flaming before those criteria, the oxygen concentration is below the OI. The procedure is repeated with upper and lower oxygen concentrations by 0.5  % until the lowest concentration of oxygen that will satisfy the criteria is determined.

Experimental results showed that adding {{a small amount of}} montmorillonite did not significantly increase the <b>oxygen</b> <b>index</b> of the asphalt but reduced the heat release rate during asphalt combustion. TGA tests had indicated that the montmorillonite (MMT and OMMT) could suppress the release of flammable volatiles and form more asphaltenes, which hence postponed the burnout time of asphalt. Furthermore, the combination of montmorillonite (MMT and OMMT) and ATH had yielded a synergistic effect, which had further reduced the heat release rate and also increased the <b>oxygen</b> <b>index</b> of asphalt. In particular, after further addition of OMMT, the barrier layer showed less crack, leading to a significant decrease in the heat release rate as compared to the adding of ATH alone...|$|R

The nanoparticle’s influence on different flame-retarding systems and possible synergisms in pyrolysis, reaction to small flame, fire behavior and mechanical properties were determined. TRGO {{has a positive}} effect on the yield stress, which is decreased by both flame-retardants and acts as a synergist with regard to Young’s modulus.

In the intumescent system, even small concentrations of TRGO change the viscosity of the pyrolysing melt crucially.
