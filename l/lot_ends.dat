5000|$|The story {{continues}} further {{after the}} destruction of the twin cities, with Lot leaving Zoar (where he had fled for refuge) with his two daughters to live in a cave. Fearing that all the men were dead, the daughters decided that in order to 'preserve the seed of their father' and procreate, they must have sexual intercourse with him; they decide to get him into a drunken stupor so as to be able to 'lie with him' and obtain his seed. [...] And so they each sleep with their father (one each on successive nights), having intoxicated him to a point wherein he could 'perceive not', and thus get impregnated by him. The Bible then continues [...] "And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day. And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben-ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day". The Biblical story of <b>Lot</b> <b>ends</b> here.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{inquires}} into Sunset's {{activity as}} a home magazine in the 1930 s and 1940 s. In viewing this period, this study draws from Sunset's entire history: from its inception in 1898 as a travel brochure for Southern Pacific Railroad, through a period as a literary magazine, through the late 1940 s when it was already recognized as a leading western home magazine. In the 50 th Anniversary issue, the editors reflected on the magazine's accomplishments and concluded that Sunset had been a "constructive and helpful influence {{in the development of}} Western homes and Western home life. " This thesis investigates the extent of Sunset's interaction within this development. Three separate enterprises that reveal the magazine's attempt to define domesticity for the 'westerner' will be outlined in this thesis. First, spanning Sunset's first fifty years, a construction of a concept called Western Living is revealed by following the development of the magazine's departments and subtitles. Second, focusing on a period that begins with the Great Depression and ends with the postwar migration to the suburbs, Sunset's involvement in a search for the appropriate 'western' home unfolds through a study of a series of articles. This endeavor deemed the Ranch Style house as the 'western' house, and with that, the magazine's Western Living construct was completed. Finally, a study of Sunset's exploration of the 'backyard' and the relationship between the house and the constrained and ubiquitous <b>lot</b> <b>ends</b> this investigation. The author of this thesis presents the first comprehensive study of Sunset's mode of operation {{as a home}} magazine. It is the intent that this inquiry will initiate a discussion regarding the role of the popular home magazine as an operative variant of architectural discourse. by Robert Alexander Gonzalez.

50|$|In 1833, {{the town}} of Cumming was formed from two 40 acre land lots that had been issued {{as part of a}} Georgia State Land Lottery in 1832.

The boundaries of the two <b>lots</b> <b>ended</b> at what is now Tolbert Street on the west side, Eastern Circle on the east side, Resthaven Street on the south side, and School Street on the north side.
