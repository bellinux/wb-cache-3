40|$|Metal {{additive}} manufacturing (AM) is increasingly {{used to create}} complex 3 D components at near net shape. However, the surface finish (SF) of the metal AM part is uneven, with surface roughness being variable over the facets of the design. Standard post-processing methods such as grinding and <b>linishing</b> often meet with major challenges in finishing parts of complex shape. This paper reports on research that demonstrated that mass finishing (MF) processes are able to deliver high-quality surface finishes (Ra and Sa) on AM-generated parts of a relatively complex geometry (both internal features and external facets) under select conditions. Four processes were studied in this work: stream finishing, high-energy (HE) centrifuge, drag finishing and disc finishing. Optimisation of the drag finishing process was then studied using a structured design of experiments (DOE). The effects {{of a range of}} finishing parameters were evaluated and optimal parameters and conditions were determined. The study established that the proposed method can be successfully applied in drag finishing to optimise the surface roughness in an industrial application and that it is an economical way of obtaining the maximum amount of information {{in a short period of}} time with a small number of tests. The study has also provided an important step in helping understand the requirements of MF to deliver AM-generated parts to a target quality finish and cycle time...|$|E
50|$|<b>Linish</b> is an {{engineering}} term {{that refers to}} the process of using grinding or belt sanding techniques to improve the flatness of a surface. The flatness may be two-dimensional, i.e. with the view of achieving a flat plate, or one-dimensional, e.g. with the view of achieving a perfectly cylindrical shape. The machine that does this may be called a linisher or a <b>linish</b> grinder. The technique may also be used, with finer grades of grindstone or sanding belt, to polish a surface.|$|R
5000|$|The Anglo-Saxon {{settlers}} of neighbouring Wonersh - {{the name}} means a crooked field - and any Celts not displaced by them {{may have been}} the people who developed the <b>Linish,</b> Bramley. This name means a flax-stubble field and in 1843, when the Tithe Assessment map was drawn, it covered the area now occupied by the Library, Blunden Court and Old Rectory Close. Flax was used to make linen but before spinning and weaving the stems were [...] "retted"; soaking in running water, a procedure which could have used the stream which also powered the mills.|$|R
