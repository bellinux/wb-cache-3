25|$|MacReady takes {{charge and}} orders Fuchs to {{continue}} Blair's work, but Fuchs disappears; MacReady, Windows, and Nauls find his burnt corpse outside. Windows returns {{to warn the}} others while MacReady and Nauls investigate MacReady's shack, noticing that the <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> even though MacReady states he turned them off earlier. On the way back, Nauls cuts MacReady loose from the tow line, assuming {{that he has been}} assimilated when he finds a torn shirt with MacReady's name on it when they were at his shack. As the team debate MacReady's fate, he breaks in and threatens to destroy the station with a bundle of dynamite if they attack him. Norris appears to suffer a heart attack after he and Nauls unsuccessfully attack MacReady from behind.|$|E
500|$|To escape their {{reputation}} for being overly serious and self-righteous, U2 decided to alter their image by being more facetious. Bono said, [...] "All through the Eighties we tried to be ourselves and failed when the <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> <b>on.</b> Which is what set us up for Zoo TV. We decided {{to have some fun}} being other people, or at least other versions of ourselves." [...] The Edge said, [...] "We were quite thrilled at the prospect of smashing U2 and starting all over again." [...] The group viewed humour as the appropriate response to their negative perception and that although their message would not change, they needed to change how they delivered it to their audience.|$|E
2500|$|Two other {{aircraft}} {{which were}} asked to monitor the Beechcraft intercepted it over the Northern Territory, north-west of Alice Springs. The pilots reported that it was now in a steady descent, and both aircraft followed it as its airspeed increased. [...] "Although its external <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> <b>on,</b> nothing could be seen inside the cabin" [...] the accident report stated. [...] "The crews of the chase aircraft attempted to contact the pilot of the Beechcraft by radio {{but they did not}} receive a response." [...] At 1510, the aircraft turned left through 90 degrees as it descended through [...] About 65km south-east of Burketown, Queensland, it hit the ground and broke up. The pilot and seven passengers died.|$|E

50|$|Photoresistors can {{be placed}} in streetlights to control when the <b>light</b> <b>is</b> <b>on.</b> Ambient <b>light</b> falling on the {{photoresistor}} causes the streetlight to turn off.

60|$|On and on {{slipped and}} slid the big touring-car, bumping over a road {{which seemed to}} grow worse as they progressed. All of the <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> full, and they were needed, for the road turned and twisted in such a fashion that but little could be seen ahead. In some places the highway seemed extra narrow, this being caused by the heavy trees and bushes lining both sides. At one point the water had caused quite a washout, and into this and out again they bumped with such {{violence}} that all the girls shrieked in alarm.|$|E

60|$|The {{systematic}} arrangement of wide convenient spaces, the quantities of business-like soldiers everywhere, the occasional neat piles of material, the ubiquitous mono-rail lines, and the towering ship-like hulls about him, reminded {{him a little}} of impressions he had got as a boy {{on a visit to}} Woolwich Dockyard. The whole camp reflected the colossal power of modern science that had created it. A peculiar strangeness was produced by the lowness of the electric light, which lay upon the ground, casting all shadows upwards and making a grotesque shadow figure of himself and his bearers on the airship sides, fusing all three of them into a monstrous animal with attenuated legs and an immense fan-like humped body. The <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> the ground because as far as possible all poles and standards had been dispensed with to prevent complications when the airships rose.|$|E
60|$|When Turan the panthan regained {{consciousness}} {{it was to}} the realization of a sharp pain in one of his forearms. The effects of the gas departed as rapidly as they had overcome him so that as he opened his eyes he was in full possession of all his faculties. The <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> again and in their glow there was revealed to the man the figure of a giant Martian rat crouching upon the table and gnawing upon his arm. Snatching his arm away he reached for his short-sword, while the rat, growling, sought to seize his arm again. It was then that Turan discovered that his weapons had been removed--short-sword, long-sword, dagger, and pistol. The rat charged him then and striking the creature away with his hand the man rose and backed off, searching for something with which to strike a harder blow. Again the rat charged and as Turan stepped quickly back to avoid the menacing jaws, something seemed to jerk suddenly upon his right ankle, and as he drew his left foot back to regain his equilibrium his heel caught upon a taut chain and he fell heavily backward to the floor just as the rat leaped upon his breast and sought his throat.|$|E
50|$|The updated cars {{received}} a facelift {{which included a}} new grille, new headlights, and a new front bumper, fenders and hood and redesigned taillights. The coupe and sedans models also {{received a}} slight redesign {{to the bottom of}} the rear bumper. On the pre-facelift sedans, the stop <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> top of the reverse and turn lights; for the facelift version, the reverse and turn <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> top of the stop lights. For the coupe and hatchback the layouts remained as before; however, the rear turn signal lenses became clear/white instead of amber to match the reverse lights (the turn light bulbs themselves now were amber).|$|E

50|$|The 1970 {{taillights}} {{went all}} the way across the back of the car, with the backup light in the middle. In 1971, the backup <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> the left and right instead of the middle. The taillight array also changed for 1972 onwards, with the Challenger now having four individual rectangular lamps.|$|E
5000|$|The {{electric}} clocks {{on board}} (wired into the vessel's generator) had stopped at 10:25 and the switches for the cabin lighting and navigation <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> <b>on,</b> implying that whatever had occurred happened at night.

50|$|The XK140's walnut {{dashboard}} {{was replaced}} by one trimmed in leather. On the early drophead coupés, the aluminium centre dash panel, which was discontinued after June 1958, had an X pattern engraving similar to the early 3.8 E-Type. Thinner doors gave more interior space. On the front parking lights, which were located atop the wings (fenders), a little red light reminded the driver the <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> <b>on.</b>|$|E

Captain Wu Xinlu {{stated that}} as he {{observed}} {{the lights on the}} final approach course to Runway 36L, he saw neither the runway approach lights on the downwind leg nor the circling guidance lights during the circling approach were on. According to the record of the automatic aeronautical light switching system, and the testimony from the Gimhae Tower duty chief, the runway, approach lights and circling guidance <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> {{at the time of the}} accident.|$|E
5000|$|Deborah Bradley, Lisa's mother, {{said that}} Lisa's father, Jeremy Irwin, {{discovered}} her missing around 4:00 a.m. on Tuesday, October 4. According to Deborah, Lisa {{had been in}} her bed when she checked on her at 6:40 p.m. Monday night, but when Jeremy came home from his late night job on Tuesday, he discovered [...] "many of the home's <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> <b>on,</b> a window was open and {{the front door was}} unlocked". Later, the family told police that several cellphones were also missing.|$|E
5000|$|The {{second example}} {{can be read}} [...] "If both switch A and switch B are closed, then the <b>light</b> <b>is</b> <b>on.</b> Therefore, it <b>is</b> either true that if switch A <b>is</b> closed, the <b>light</b> <b>is</b> <b>on,</b> or that if switch B <b>is</b> closed, the <b>light</b> <b>is</b> on." [...] Here, the most likely natural-language {{interpretation}} of the [...] "if ... then ..." [...] statements would be [...] "whenever switch A <b>is</b> closed, the <b>light</b> <b>is</b> on", and [...] "whenever switch B <b>is</b> closed, the <b>light</b> <b>is</b> on". Again, under this interpretation both clauses of the conclusion may be false (for instance in a series circuit, with a light that only comes on when both switches are closed).|$|R

5000|$|On November 16, 2012, Patera {{was interviewed}} on KFAN radio based out of Minneapolis, MN. In {{describing}} the incident, {{he stated that}} he went to the McDonald's around midnight to get a burger, but found it closed. The <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> because they were shooting a commercial, so not only Patera but another customer (who he described as a young adult) had arrived, thinking that they were open for business. The young adult threw a rock through the window, but Patera was blamed. Saito was never there.|$|E
50|$|The Bruins' Stanley Cup finals {{appearances}} in 1988 and 1990 were both disrupted by power outages. On May 24, 1988, a power transformer in the North End blew up during Game 4 of the Finals between the Bruins and the Edmonton Oilers: the contest was ruled a 3-3 tie. Two years later, on May 15, 1990, {{the lights went}} out during an overtime finals game between the same two teams. However, the <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> an automatic timer and could be turned back on this time with the game ending with a 3-2 triple overtime win for the visiting Oilers.|$|E
5000|$|Video footage {{that emerged}} in the hours after the {{incident}} showed that officers had fired before Abu Al-Qia’an accelerated, and that, contrary to police assertions, the car’s <b>lights</b> <b>were</b> <b>on.</b> Subsequently, a police autopsy indicated that a bullet had hit Abu Al-Qia’an in the right knee, smashing it, which may have caused the car to accelerate. A month later, Erdan spoke of the [...] "regrettable incident" [...] in which [...] "both a citizen and a police officer were killed". In March, Israeli Minister of Agriculture Uri Ariel publicly apologized for the [...] "grievous mistakes that were made".|$|E
