40|$|The {{rehydration}} kinetics {{of various}} dehydrated {{fruits and vegetables}} (apple, potato, carrot, banana, pepper, garlic, mushroom, onion, <b>leek,</b> <b>pea,</b> corn, pumpkin, and tomato) were examined during rehydration at different temperatures. Dehydrated products were produced in an air dryer at 70 degreesC and 10 % air humidity, and subsequently they were rehydrated in a bath of water tempered at 40, 60 and 80 degreesC. A first order kinetic model was used, in which the rate constant and the equilibrium moisture content are functions of the process variable (water temperature). The parameters of the model considered {{were found to be}} greatly affected by the water temperature during rehydration. In particular the temperature increment increases the rate of rehydration and the equilibrium moisture content of the rehydrated products. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|As {{with most}} {{peoples in the}} north of Europe in Late Antiquity, the Picts were farmers living in small communities. Cattle and horses were an obvious sign of wealth and prestige, sheep and pigs were kept in large numbers, and place names suggest that {{transhumance}} was common. Animals were small by later standards, although horses from Britain were imported into Ireland as breed-stock to enlarge native horses. From Irish sources it appears that the élite engaged in competitive cattle-breeding for size, and this may have been the case in Pictland also. Carvings show hunting with dogs, and also, unlike in Ireland, with falcons. Cereal crops included wheat, barley, oats and rye. Vegetables included kale, cabbage, onions and <b>leeks,</b> <b>peas</b> and beans and turnips, and some types no longer common, such as skirret. Plants such as wild garlic, nettles and watercress may have been gathered in the wild. The pastoral economy meant that hides and leather were readily available. Wool was the main source of fibres for clothing, and flax was also common, although it is not clear if they grew it for fibres, for oil, or as a foodstuff. Fish, shellfish, seals, and whales were exploited along coasts and rivers. The importance of domesticated animals suggests that meat and milk products were {{a major part of the}} diet of ordinary people, while the élite would have eaten a diet rich in meat from farming and hunting.|$|R
50|$|Vegetable and {{glutinous rice}} {{planting}} {{are the main}} plantation in the township. Its milled long-grain glutinous rice accounts for 27% of the total production in Taiwan. Other produces are broccoli, <b>leeks,</b> spring onions, <b>peas,</b> cucumbers, bitter gourds, squashes and water chestnuts. Its livestock industry is also quite developed, in {{which most of the}} livestock are pigs and chickens, with additional cattle, sheep, deer and rabbits.|$|R
50|$|Circa 1940 {{electricity}} was reestablished at the farm. It {{was used}} until the utility company power {{was brought to}} the farm in the 1940s after the war. During 1943, 1944, and 1945, Henry and Arthur Studebaker grew vegetables at the farm for sale to local residents. They had a 2 acre garden in the eastern portion of the field south of the orchard and north of the current visitor center parking lot. They grew vegetables to sell door to door in Dune Acres. They grew asparagus, lima beans, yellow and green snap beans, beets, broccoli, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, celery (white), kale, leaf lettuce, endive, cantaloupe, watermelons, okra, green onions, <b>leeks,</b> parsnips, <b>peas,</b> green and red peppers, red, white, and sweet potatoes, radishes, rhubarb, spinach, red rhubarb chard and white Swiss chard, Jerusalem and butternut squash, red and yellow tomatoes, turnips, rutabagas, kohl robi, cicely, sweet corn (yellow bantam and country gentleman), horseradish, dill, sage, chives, and parsley.|$|R

50|$|The poor {{consumed}} a diet {{largely of}} bread, cheese, milk, and beer, with small portions of meat, fish and vegetables, and occasionally some fruit. Potatoes were just {{arriving at the}} end of the period, and became increasingly important. The typical poor farmer sold his best products on the market, keeping the cheap food for the family. Stale bread could be used to make bread puddings, and bread crumbs served to thicken soups, stews, and sauces. At a somewhat higher social level families ate an enormous variety of meats, especially beef, mutton, veal, lamb, and pork, as well as chickens, and ducks. The holiday goose was a special treat. Many rural folk and some townspeople tended a small garden which produced vegetables such as asparagus, cucumbers, spinach, lettuce, beans, cabbage, carrots, <b>leeks,</b> and <b>peas,</b> as well as medicinal and flavoring herbs. Some grew their own apricots, grapes, berries, apples, pears, plums, currants, and cherries. Families without a garden could trade with their neighbors to obtain vegetables and fruits at low cost.|$|R
50|$|Fresh {{produce is}} readily {{available}} and thus used extensively, and the trend (urged by long-term government health initiatives) is towards low-salt, low-fat healthy cookery incorporating lean meat and lightly cooked, colourful, steamed or stir-fried vegetables. With most of the Australian population residing in coastal areas, fish and seafood is popular. In the temperate regions of Australia vegetables are traditionally eaten seasonally, especially in regional areas, although in urban areas there is large scale importation of fresh produce sourced {{from around the world}} by supermarkets and wholesalers for grocery stores, to meet demands for year-round availability. During Spring: Artichoke, Asparagus, Bean shoots, Beetroot, Broccoli, Cabbage, Cauliflower, Cucumber, <b>Leek,</b> Lettuce, Mushrooms, <b>Peas,</b> Rhubarb, and Spinach. During Summer: Capsicum, Cucumber, Eggplant, Squash, Tomato, and Zucchini.|$|R

The use of apples dipped in honey, symbolizing a sweet year, is a late medieval Ashkenazi addition, though it is now almost universally accepted. Typically, round challah bread is served, to symbolize the cycle of the year. From ancient to quite modern age, lamb head or fish head were served. Nowadays, [...] gefilte fish and Lekach are commonly served by Ashkenazic Jews on this holiday. On the second night, new fruits are served to warrant inclusion of the shehecheyanu blessing.|$|R

40|$|Thrips (Thysanoptera) {{and their}} predators were {{investigated}} from 2005 – 2007 {{on a wide}} range of vegetables grown mostly in the winter period in Çukurova region of Turkey. A total of 2989 adult thrips and 406 thrips larvae were extracted from the vegetables. The adults belonged to 14 thrips species of which Melanthrips spp. were the most dominant species. The dominance of the commonly found pests Thrips tabaci and Frankliniella occidentalis differed greatly. F. occidentalis was the predominant thrips infesting broad bean, lettuce and parsley, while T. tabaci was more abundant on <b>leek,</b> onion and <b>pea.</b> The most thrips were collected from flowers or heads of vegetables in early spring. Numbers of predatory insects dwelling on the sampled vegetables were lower in comparison to total numbers of thrips obtained in the years 2006 and 2007. Of the predators, the hemipteran generalists Orius laevigatus and O. niger were the most prevalent and high numbers of them were recorded often on flowers of broad bean in winter. Further investigations should be planned to understand clearly the predatory habit of Melanthrips...|$|R

The more prosperous enjoyed a wide variety of food and drink, including exotic new drinks such as tea, coffee, and chocolate. French and Italian chefs appeared in the country houses and palaces bringing new standards of food preparation and taste. For example, the English developed a taste for acidic foods—such as oranges for the upper class—and started to use vinegar heavily. The gentry paid increasing attention to their gardens, with new fruits, vegetables and herbs; pasta, pastries, and dried mustard balls first appeared on the table. The apricot was a special treat at fancy banquets. Roast beef remained a staple for those who could afford it. The rest ate a great deal of bread and fish. Every class had a taste for beer and rum.|$|R
40|$|A rapidly {{increasing}} human population {{has resulted in}} the expansion of urban areas and an associated increase in the demand for food. Consequently, urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA), using waste water as a source for irrigation, is increasingly common around the world, particularly in developing countries. Although UPA plays a crucial role in supplying food to urban populations, the quality of that food may be affected by accumulation of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) in the soil and the food chain. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess potentially toxic element (PTE) contamination in soils and vegetables grown in the Kurdistan region of Iraq. Specific objectives included (i) to measure the total concentrations, mobility and bioavailability of PTEs using isotopic dilution approaches (E- and L-values) and single- and sequential-extraction procedures (ii) to compare these different metrics to determine the best assay for soils in Kurdistan and (iii) to investigate the potential human health risks from consumption of contaminated vegetables by estimating dietary intake and hazard quotients (HQs). Overall, the concentration of PTEs were noticeably higher in waste disposal areas and progressively lower in urban, peri-urban and rural areas, with the exception of Ni concentrations which were high at all study sites, reflecting the geological background of the region. However, the total metal concentration does not represent the ‘bioavailable’ fraction of an element - chemical extractions such as DTPA, sequential extractions and measurements of isotopically-exchangeable metal may better represent bioavailable PTEs. DTPA-extractable and isotopically-exchangeable metals (E-value) were typically low for Ni (2. 89, 0. 629 mg kg- 1), Cu (4. 76, 1. 98 mg kg- 1), Zn (12. 9, 9. 92 mg kg- 1), Cd (0. 144, 0. 066 mg kg- 1) and Pb (5. 03, 2. 13 mg kg- 1), but the metals were more labile in soils in waste areas compared to urban, peri-urban and remote areas. Sequential extraction suggested that most PTEs were in the residual fraction with the exception of Se, Cd and Pb which were in the organic matter, carbonate and Fe/Mn oxide fractions, respectively. PTE concentrations in the edible parts of vegetables collected from the study sites varied between vegetable types and site. Higher total concentrations of PTEs were measured in vegetables from the waste areas with decreasing concentrations in urban, semi-urban and rural areas. Concentrations of Ni and Cu exceeded recommended UK and WHO/EU limits (0. 5 mg kg- 1 Fw) in almost all vegetables except for tomato, okra and cucumber for Ni, while limits for As were exceeded in fruit vegetables from waste areas and leafy vegetables in waste, urban and peri-urban areas. Concentrations of Cd were above recommended limits in all vegetables except for cowpea and cucumber at all sites. The concentration of Pb exceeded the limits in okra, cow <b>pea,</b> <b>leek,</b> celery and chard in waste, urban and peri-urban areas. An experiment growing vegetables in pots under controlled conditions was established to evaluate the ability of plants to accumulate PTEs by estimating the isotopically-exchangeable metal pool in plants (L-values). Results gave similar L-values for different vegetable types ranging from 7. 70 mg kg- 1 in chard to 11. 0 mg kg- 1 in radish leaf for Ni, 44. 2 mg kg- 1 in lettuce to 51. 8 mg kg- 1 in celery for Zn and 0. 0912 mg kg- 1 in lettuce to 0. 0992 mg kg- 1 in chard for Cd. The L- values of trace elements in plant roots were higher than those obtained for the shoots in the vegetables. A comparison between DTPA, E- and L-values was made and the results demonstrated that L-values were higher. Risks to human health were assessed using hazard quotients (HQ) assuming intakes of 0. 187 kg FW d- 1 for adults and 0. 118 kg FW d- 1 for children with body weights of 70 and 14. 2 kg, respectively. Vegetable consumption showed no risks for adults while HQs ≥ 1 were observed for Ni, As and Cd for children. Although HQs for the vegetables suggest elevated risk for children these are likely to be lower when realistic dietary consumption levels are considered. Thus, more accurate estimates of daily intake of vegetables are recommended for future studies...|$|R
