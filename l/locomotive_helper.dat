50|$|Past Gallitzin, the {{railroad}} {{passes through the}} small town of Cresson, where all of the Pittsburgh Line's tracks come back together. Here is also where a <b>locomotive</b> <b>helper</b> base is located, as well as interchange(s) with the RJ Corman Railroad. Also located in Cresson is the Station Inn, a bed and breakfast run exclusively for railroad enthusiasts, which features a long sheltered porch showing a close and clear view of the Pittsburgh Line tracks.|$|E

50|$|The town of Skykomish {{was founded}} as a {{division}} {{point on the}} railroad. The railyard was used by <b>helper</b> <b>locomotives</b> on the grade up to Stevens Pass.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Helper</b> <b>locomotives</b> {{at the end}} of {{the train}} are rarely used in the {{countries}} of the former Soviet Union. The load of the freight per train is not as heavy as on American railways.|$|R
50|$|Beverly's {{early success}} {{depended}} partially on steep grades on the railroad, which meant <b>helper</b> <b>locomotives</b> {{were required to}} drive the trains. Colorful brochures were printed and distributed back east by companies touting Beverly's long growing season and sheltered location.|$|R
50|$|From {{a railway}} {{signalling}} point of view, the 925 m-long Schwarzkopftunnel lies within Heigenbrücken railway station. This peculiarity {{stems from a}} pushing operation, still undertaken today, between Laufach and Heigenbrücken. Heavy goods trains {{come to a stop}} at Laufach station, where a <b>helper</b> <b>locomotive</b> joins the train’s tail end to help the train’s main locomotive get the train up the Spessart Ramp, which reaches a steepness of 1:47 (some 21‰). The tunnel itself is built with no gradients to speak of. Just before the tunnel portal, the <b>helper</b> <b>locomotive</b> leaves the goods train, which has now covered the steepest gradient and continues on its way southeastwards. So that the <b>helper</b> <b>locomotive</b> does not need to go through the tunnel and into the passenger transport complex (which would lead to disruption of normal operations), the tracks at the Aschaffenburg (that is to say, far) end of the tunnel are so arranged as to allow it to cross over to the other track and travel back to Laufach. The points needed for this also belong to the Heigenbrücken signal box, meaning that Heigenbrücken station stretches right through the tunnel.|$|R
50|$|The two {{critical}} factors in this runaway and subsequent derailment were (1) the incorrect train tonnage {{provided to the}} crew, and (2) the lack of fully operative dynamic brakes on {{all but two of}} the locomotives between the head-end and <b>helper</b> <b>locomotive</b> consists.|$|R
5000|$|BHP Billiton {{iron ore}} train has {{typically}} 268 cars and a train weight of 43,000 tonnes carrying 24,200 tonnes of iron ore, 2.8 km long, two SD70ACe locomotives {{at the head}} of the train and two remote controlled SD70ACe <b>locomotives</b> as mid-train <b>helpers</b> ...|$|R
50|$|The {{division}} {{point at}} Caliente {{served as a}} maintenance facility and was a base for <b>helper</b> <b>locomotives.</b> In the 1950s, as diesel locomotives replaced steam, the railroad no longer needed to use the Caliente site. Maintenance of the locomotives was moved to Las Vegas in 1948.|$|R
25|$|March 1956: General Motors' Aerotrain makes {{a series}} of {{experimental}} runs as a San Diegan consist. Thoughts of placing it in permanent service are quickly abandoned as the entire trainset has to be turned {{at each end of}} the line, and requires <b>helper</b> <b>locomotives</b> on the Sorrento Grade.|$|R
50|$|Soo #700 {{occasionally}} sees freight service, sometimes pulling empty coal hoppers stored {{during the}} winter. Often it pulls short excursions but occasionally travels the full {{distance of the}} North Shore Scenic Railroad. Once in a while from 2007-2013 it was a <b>helper</b> <b>locomotive</b> for Soo Line 2719 on steam excursions.|$|R
50|$|A major {{improvement}} was {{the opening of}} the 15,343-meter (9.534 mi) Severomuysky Tunnel on December 5, 2003. It is up to 1.5 kilometres (nearly 1 mile) deep. Construction took 27 years to complete. Prior to this, the corresponding route segment was 54 km long, with heavy slopes necessitating the use of auxiliary (<b>helper)</b> <b>locomotives.</b>|$|R
50|$|In March 1956 the Aerotrain made {{experimental}} {{runs for}} the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway in California as a San Diegan between Los Angeles and San Diego. Its use ended because the trainset had to be turned after each trip and it needed <b>helper</b> <b>locomotives</b> on the Sorrento Grade north of San Diego.|$|R
50|$|In September 2010, {{three of}} the {{withdrawn}} Class E31 locomotives (E32 to E34) were transferred to the Ōigawa Railway to replace the ageing E10 and ED500 locomotives used there. Initially they were used only for depot shunting duties, but from 2017 they underwent overhaul in preparation for use as <b>helper</b> <b>locomotives</b> on steam-hauled trains from fiscal 2018.|$|R
5000|$|The UP Big Boys were an {{expansion}} of the 4-6-6-4 [...] "Challenger" [...] type articulated locomotive. Although their wheels were an inch (25 mm) smaller than those of the Challengers, they were still able to sustain high speeds. Adding four driving wheels increased the pulling power of the locomotive and reduced the need for <b>helper</b> <b>locomotives</b> over steep grades.|$|R
50|$|Engineer Holland {{remained}} {{in his seat}} at the control stand in unit SP 8278 {{at the head of}} the train, and suffered several cracked ribs and a punctured lung. However, he was able to crawl out of his wrecked locomotive and was helped down by eyewitnesses on the scene. Engineer Hill and Brakeman Waterbury, who were in the <b>helper</b> <b>locomotives,</b> received minor injuries.|$|R
5000|$|Echo was {{significant}} to the Union Pacific Railroad. The town {{served as a}} coaling and watering station for trains entering Echo Canyon. From Echo, <b>helper</b> <b>locomotives</b> were added, when needed, to push trains up the steep grade to Wahsatch. A large coaling tower and many other railroad infrastructures existed {{in and around the}} town. Echo saw the most action during World War II.|$|R
5000|$|Usui Pass on the Shinetsu Line - The {{maximum grade}} of 66.7‰ (1 in 15) necessitated {{the use of}} <b>helper</b> <b>locomotives</b> on all trains, {{including}} EMUs, both uphill and downhill (for added braking ability). A pair of JNR Class EF63 electric locomotives were coupled at the downhill side of every train. This segment was closed upon {{the opening of the}} Nagano Shinkansen in 1997.|$|R
50|$|Since {{it was not}} {{possible}} to remotely control a steam <b>locomotive,</b> each <b>helper</b> had to have a full crew on board. Careful coordination was required between engine crews to assure that all locomotives were operated in a consistent manner. Standard whistle signals were employed to tell the helper crew when to apply power, drift or brake. A misunderstanding of signals by a pusher locomotive crew could result in a major wreck if the lead locomotive applied brakes while the bank engine was still applying power. The usual result was that the train would experience a violent run-in (an abrupt bunching of train slack), resulting in the derailment of part or all of the train.|$|R
25|$|One {{practice}} not {{encouraged by}} management was disconnecting <b>helper</b> <b>locomotives</b> on the fly. The engineer of the helper would back {{off on the}} throttle to unload the coupler, and the fireman would pull the pin to separate the two engines. The helper would then sprint ahead to the siding, throw the switch, pull off the line, and reset the switch, preferably all before the train arrived at the turnout.|$|R
500|$|The first {{locomotive}} on the line, a Baldwin 4-4-0 named [...] "Warren County No. 1", {{was bought}} in 1877 by the Miami Valley Railway. In all, the CL and predecessors had nine narrow gauge locomotives, bought from four different manufacturers. Two were disposed {{of in the}} 1880s, and, of the seven remaining into the 1890s, six provided main line service and one {{was used as a}} switching and <b>helper</b> <b>locomotive.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The Reuben Wells is a <b>helper</b> <b>locomotive</b> {{that was}} built in 1868. It was {{designed}} to push train cars up the 5.89% incline of Madison Hill in Madison, Indiana, the steepest segment of standard-gauge main-track in the United States. [...] Weighing 55 ST, {{it was the most}} powerful locomotive in the world at the time. It is 35 ft long. The train is named after its designer, engineer Reuben Wells.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{locomotive}} on the line, a Baldwin 4-4-0 named [...] "Warren County No. 1", {{was bought}} in 1877 by the Miami Valley Railway.

50|$|Even {{with the}} tunnel, {{some of the}} CPR's largest <b>locomotives</b> and long <b>helper</b> districts (pushers) were used to get trains {{up and over the}} pass. The Selkirk steam locomotive, one of the biggest, was named after the {{mountain}} range penetrated by this pass. In 1988, the Canadian Pacific Railway opened the 14.7 km Mount Macdonald Tunnel under the Pass to increase capacity (operating one tunnel in each direction) and to decrease the grades on the approach from the east.|$|R
5000|$|Adding {{locomotives}} in {{the middle}} of the train has the distinct advantage of applying the helper power to only part of the train, thus limiting the maximum drawbar pull applied to the first car of the train to a safe level. The narrow gauge portions of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad, in particular, used [...] "swing helpers", which meant the <b>helper</b> <b>locomotives</b> were placed mid-train at a point where they were pushing and pulling an approximately equal amount of tonnage, said location being referred to as the train's [...] "swing point". This was also done to balance out the [...] "slack" [...] in the train between the <b>locomotives,</b> the swing <b>helpers,</b> and the end train helpers just in front of the caboose. However, this arrangement requires splitting the train in order to add or remove the helper engine(s), which can be a time-consuming maneuver. However, on some American railroads it was necessary to an extent because operating rules required end of train helpers to be added at the end of the train, but in front of the caboose. This was done for the safety of the train crew riding inside the caboose.|$|R

50|$|It was {{the former}} {{interchange}} between the DL&W and the WB&E railroads near present Mill Creek Road and featured a mechanical switch tower {{to control the}} switching of tracks. There were connections to a roundhouse used for <b>helper</b> <b>locomotives.</b> In 1942, the switching towers at West Henryville and Analomink were replaced by electric interlockings, remotely controlled from the Gravel Place tower. The equipment at Gravel Place was moved to another tower (in East Stroudsburg) in 1950; thereafter Gravel Place was unmanned.|$|R
2500|$|In mountainous regions, it {{is common}} to interpose <b>helper</b> <b>locomotives</b> {{in the middle of the}} train, both to provide the extra power needed to ascend a grade and to limit the amount of stress applied to the draft gear of the car coupled to the {{head-end}} power. [...] The helper units in such distributed power configurations are controlled from the lead unit's cab through coded radio signals. [...] Although this is technically not an MU configuration, the behaviour is the same as with physically interconnected units.|$|R
50|$|In 1953 and 1957, {{attempts}} were made to market the low-grade iron ore stockpiled at the Vulcan Mine. However, higher horse power, second generation diesel-electric locomotives of the 1960s resulted in the further decline in Union Pacific personnel needed at Kelso. This technological change eliminated the need for <b>helper</b> <b>locomotives</b> entirely in 1959. Coupled with the closing of the station agency and cessation of passenger train service to Kelso on August 14, 1964, this development spelled the end of the depot’s principal function {{with the exception of the}} Lunch Room which remained serving until 1985.|$|R
5000|$|In the UK, {{an engine}} that was {{temporarily}} {{attached to the}} front of a train to assist with the ascent of an incline was called a pilot locomotive. This differentiated it from the train engine(s) which was provided to power the train to its destination. A train with one or more <b>helper</b> <b>locomotives</b> attached to the front may be referred to as a [...] "double header", [...] "triple header", etc., depending on the number of helpers/bankers. These terms gradually fell out of general usage as diesel locomotives replaced steam power.|$|R
5000|$|The station began {{service on}} December 1, 1888, as the {{terminal}} of the Japanese Government Railways between [...] (near the Sea of Japan coast) and Karuizawa. The line was extended from Karuizawa to [...] through the Usui Pass on April 1, 1893, completing the trunk line between [...] (connecting to a Nippon Railway line to Ueno Station in Tokyo) and Naoetsu, which was later named the Shinetsu Main Line. At Karuizawa, all trains were coupled with or separated from <b>helper</b> <b>locomotives</b> that were required for all trains {{to go through}} the Usui Pass section.|$|R
2500|$|In December 1937, {{locomotive}} #3461 set a {{world record}} for the longest single run by a steam locomotive by completing the [...] from Los Angeles, California to Chicago without maintenance other than five refuelling stops en route, hauling Train #8, the Fast Mail Express. [...] An average speed of [...] was attained, including stops; maximum speed during the run was [...] During steeply graded portions of the run it was, of course, assisted by <b>helper</b> <b>locomotives.</b> [...] Such long distance runs were a goal of railway operating departments, enabling a reduction in locomotive numbers and through increased locomotive utilization, reduce overall costs.|$|R
