A Latin square of side n with a transversal similarly defines a finite geometry on 3 n+ 1 points, with three <b>lines</b> of <b>size</b> n, n 2 −n <b>lines</b> of <b>size</b> 3, and n concurrent <b>lines</b> of <b>size</b> 4. A collection of k mutually orthogonal Latin squares defines a geometry on kn points, with k <b>lines</b> of <b>size</b> n and n 2 <b>lines</b> of <b>size</b> k. Extending the work of Bruen and Colbourn [A. A. Bruen, C. J. Colbourn, Transversal designs in classical planes and spaces, J. Combin. Theory Ser.

40|$|AbstractA π-space is a planar space all {{of whose}} planes are {{isomorphic}} {{to a given}} linear space π. The only known nontrivial finite π-spaces in which all lines have the same size are the finite projective and affine spaces, the Hall spaces on 3 n points and the Steiner systems S(3,|π|,v). Only one family of finite π-spaces with <b>lines</b> of different <b>sizes</b> is known at present: these spaces consist of 2 k points lying on two dispoint lines of k points and their planes are degenerate projective planes. Rather restrictive relations on the parameters of such spaces are given, which are particularly strong if {{there are more than}} two <b>line</b> <b>sizes.</b> We prove that the number of points of any finite nontrivial π-space having at least two <b>line</b> <b>sizes</b> is uniquely determined by some of the parameters of π. A table of possible parameters of planes having only two <b>line</b> <b>sizes</b> and containing at most 40 points is also provided. The smallest value of |π| is 7 and corresponds to two planes; one of them is ruled out, the problem is open for the other one...|$|R

25|$|Each rod {{is sized}} {{to the fish}} being sought, the wind and water {{conditions}} and also to a particular weight of line: larger and heavier <b>line</b> <b>sizes</b> will cast heavier, larger flies. Fly rods come {{in a wide variety}} of <b>line</b> <b>sizes,</b> from size #000 to #0 rods for the smallest freshwater trout and pan fish up to and including #16 rods for large saltwater game fish. Fly rods tend to have a single, large-diameter line guide (called a stripping guide), with a number of smaller looped guides (aka snake guides) spaced along the rod to help control the movement of the relatively thick fly line. To prevent interference with casting movements, most fly rods usually have little or no butt section (handle) extending below the fishing reel. However, the Spey rod, a fly rod with an elongated rear handle, is often used for fishing either large rivers for salmon and Steelhead or saltwater surf casting, using a two-handed casting technique.|$|R
