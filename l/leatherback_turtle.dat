5|$|Logging, {{along with}} {{cultivation}} practices has devastated tree cover, causing severe environmental degradation in the country. Over 80percent of Sarawak's rainforest has been cleared. Floods in East Malaysia have been worsened {{by the loss}} of trees, and over 60percent of the Peninsular's forest have been cleared. With current rates of deforestation, the forests are predicted to be extinct by 2020. Deforestation is a major problem for animals, fungi and plants, as the forest is cut to make room for plantations. Most remaining forest is found inside national parks. Habitat destruction has proved a threat for marine life. Illegal fishing is another major threat, with fishing methods such as dynamite fishing and poisoning depleting marine ecosystems. <b>Leatherback</b> <b>turtle</b> numbers have dropped 98percent since the 1950s. Hunting has also been an issue for some animals, with overconsumption and the use of animal parts for profit endangering many animals, from marine life to tigers. Marine life is also detrimentally affected by uncontrolled tourism.|$|E
40|$|International audienceCadmium, {{copper and}} zinc have been {{analysed}} in some {{tissues and organs}} of Loggerhead, Kemp's Ridley (only muscle for this species) and <b>Leatherback</b> <b>turtles</b> stranded along the Atlantic coasts of France. The pancreas analysed only in <b>Leatherback</b> <b>turtles</b> exhibited the highest metal concentrations, which is very surprising for an organ which does not {{play a role in}} the detoxification processes. The distribution of these elements in kidney, liver and muscle were quite similar to that found in marine mammals or seabirds.

The main source of cadmium for marine turtles is probably the food. The <b>Leatherback</b> <b>turtles</b> are known to feed mainly on jellyfish in this area.

40|$|International audienceDespite {{decades of}} {{conservation}} {{efforts on the}} nesting beaches, the critical status of <b>leatherback</b> <b>turtles</b> shows that their survival predominantly depends on our ability to reduce at-sea mortality. Although areas where leatherbacks meet fisheries have been identified during the long distance movements between two consecutive nesting seasons, hotspots of lethal interactions are still poorly defined within the nesting season, when individuals concentrate close to land. Here we report movements of satellite-tracked gravid <b>leatherback</b> <b>turtles</b> during the nesting season in Western Central Africa, South America and Caribbean Sea, accounting for about 70 % of the world population. We show that during, {{and at the end}} of, the nesting season <b>leatherback</b> <b>turtles</b> have the propensity to remain over the continental shelf, yet sometimes perform extended movements and may even nest in neighbouring countries. Leatherbacks exploit coastal commercial fishing grounds and face substantial accidental capture by regional coastal fisheries (e. g. at least 10 % in French Guiana). This emphasises the need for regional conservation strategies to be developed at the ocean scale, both at sea and on land, to ensure the survival of the last <b>leatherback</b> <b>turtles...</b>|$|R

We investigated the thermoregulatory capabilities of free‐ranging leatherbacks and, specifically, {{the effect that}} changes in diving patterns and ambient temperatures have on leatherback body temperatures (TB). Data loggers were used to record subcarapace and gastrointestinal tract temperatures (TSC and TGT, respectively), TW, swim speed, dive depth, and dive times of female <b>leatherback</b> <b>turtles</b> during internesting intervals {{off the coast of}} Guanacaste, Costa Rica. Mean TSC (28. 7 °– 29. 0 °C) was significantly higher than mean TW (25. 0 °– 27. 5 °C). There was a significant positive relationship between TSC and TW and a significant negative correlation between TSC and dive depth and TGT and dive depth. Rapid fluctuations in TGT occurred during the first several days of the internesting interval, which suggests that turtles were ingesting prey or water during this time. Turtles spent 79 %– 91 % of the time at sea swimming at speeds greater than 0. 2 m s− 1, and the average swim speed was m s− 1.
