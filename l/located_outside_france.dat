5000|$|Across {{continental}} Europe, but in France especially, booksellers {{and publishers}} had to negotiate censorship laws of varying strictness. The Encyclopédie, for example, narrowly escaped seizure {{and had to}} be saved by Malesherbes, {{the man in charge of}} the French censure. Indeed, many publishing companies were conveniently <b>located</b> <b>outside</b> <b>France</b> so as to avoid overzealous French censors. They would smuggle their merchandise across the border, where it would then be transported to clandestine booksellers or small-time peddlers. The records of clandestine booksellers may give a better representation of what literate Frenchmen might have truly read, since their clandestine nature provided a less restrictive product choice. In one case, political books were the most popular category, primarily libels and pamphlets. Readers were more interested in sensationalist stories about criminals and political corruption than they were in political theory itself. The second most popular category, [...] "general works" [...] (those books [...] "that did not have a dominant motif and that contained something to offend almost everyone in authority") demonstrated a high demand for generally low-brow subversive literature. However, these works never became part of literary canon, and are largely forgotten today as a result.|$|E
