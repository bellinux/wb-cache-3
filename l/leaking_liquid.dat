2500|$|On 28 July—the {{day before}} the accident—Forrestal was resupplied with {{ordnance}} from the ammunition ship USS Diamond Head. The load included sixteen 1000-lb AN/M65A1 [...] "fat boy" [...] bombs (so nicknamed because of their short, rotund shape), which Diamond Head had picked up from the Naval Base Subic Bay and were intended for the next day's second bombing sortie. Some of the batch of AN-M65A1s Forrestal received {{were more than a}} decade old, having spent a portion of that exposed to the heat and humidity of Okinawa or Guam, eventually being improperly stored in open-air Quonset huts at a disused ammunition dump on the periphery of Subic Bay Naval Base. Unlike the thick-cased Mark 83 bombs filled with Composition H6, the AN/M65A1 bombs were thin-skinned and filled with Composition B, an older explosive with greater shock and heat sensitivity. Composition B also had the dangerous tendency to become more powerful (up to 50% by weight) and more sensitive if it was old or improperly stored. Forrestal's ordnance handlers had never even seen an AN/M65A1 before, and to their shock, the bombs delivered from Diamond Head were in terrible condition; coated with [...] "decades of accumulated rust and grime" [...] and still in their original packing crates (now moldy and rotten); some were stamped with production dates as early as 1953. Most dangerous of all, several bombs were seen to be <b>leaking</b> <b>liquid</b> paraffin phlegmatizing agent from their seams, an unmistakable sign that the bomb's explosive filler had degenerated with excessive age, and exposure to heat and moisture.|$|E

50|$|On September 24, the Atlas was {{prepared}} for a planned 12-minute PFRT (Pre-Flight Readiness Test). The satellite {{was not on the}} launch vehicle, the third stage was a dummy, and the second stage was unfueled. After 2.5 seconds of engine operation, a fire erupted in the Atlas's thrust section. Fed by <b>leaking</b> <b>liquid</b> oxygen, it proved impossible to put out with pad extinguishers and soon a huge inferno was raging on LC-12. Thirty-seven seconds after the fire began, the Atlas toppled over in a massive fireball, the biggest explosion seen at Cape Canaveral up to that point. The pad was severely damaged, with both umbilical towers totally destroyed, the concrete launch stand caved in, and the service tower knocked over. It would take months of repairs to get it back online. The final explosion was believed {{to be the result of}} loss of tank pressure. Engine shutdown caused the propellant valves to snap shut, causing overpressurization of the propellant tanks. Ground operators in the blockhouse flipped manual override switches to lower RP-1 pressure and increase LOX pressure, but the missile did not respond, possibly due to fire-induced damage to the control wiring on the pad. The pneumatic control system automatically threw open the LOX boil-off valve to vent tank pressure, which apparently continued until the tanks lost support pressure to the point where their structural integrity failed. At around 35 seconds, the intermediate bulkhead collapsed, causing the LOX to fall into the RP-1 tank and mix. The propellants turned into a gel that detonated with the force of 20,000 pounds (9070 kg) of TNT and resulted in an extremely powerful explosion that caused extensive pad damage.|$|E

40|$|On December 15, 1997, {{a load of}} {{low-level}} {{radioactive waste}} bound for the Nevada Test Site, from the Fernald Environmental Management Project (FEMP) in Ohio, was discovered leaking while traveling Interstate 40 {{near the city of}} Kingman, Arizona.

The waste packages were prepared for transport and returned to FEMP. As a result of this incident, many evaluations of the Department’s transportation and low-level waste programs were conducted and several actions were taken by the Department in the interim. Among the evaluations were a Type B Accident Investigation, the formation of a Container Working Group to review the programs and provide recommendations to the Department for improvements, reevaluation of the low-level waste programs at each site, evaluation of the effects of the high-liquid-content waste on the disposal site, and reevaluation of the wast...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Measurement of {{mechanical}} properties of a thin large crystallized material such as TFT-LCD panel is challenging with traditional material testing equipments. Since TFT-LCDs are constructed with combination of brittle glass panels, polymer sheets, and liquid crystal, their properties {{are not only}} anisotropic but also usually non-linear. Accurate measurement of the properties often requires very expensive facilities. Especially when {{the size of the}} test sample is as large as 40 -inch or wider, direct measurement cost of even elastic modulus is prohibitive. On the other hand, machining of the large TFT-LCD to make a smaller size specimen that could be fit into a material tester is not possible due to <b>leaking</b> <b>liquid</b> crystal. A new method for the measurement of elastic modulus of large TFT-LCD panel is presented in this article. The suggested method provides a simple, economic, and user-friendly way for measuring the elastic modulus of large panels with considerable level of accuracy. The measured elastic modulus is verified by the combination of part level modal test and analysis, and impact test and analysis at the assembled digital TV level...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{leak before break}} (LBB) {{concept is}} widely used in {{designing}} pipe lines in nuclear power plants. According to the concept, the amount of <b>leaking</b> <b>liquid</b> from a pipe should be more than the minimum detectable leak rate of a leak detection system before catastrophic failure occurs. Therefore, accurate estimation of the leak rate is important to evaluate {{the validity of the}} LBB concept in pipe line design. In this paper, a program was developed to estimate the leak rate through circumferential cracks in pipes in nuclear power plants using the Henry–Fauske flow model and modified Henry–Fauske flow model. By using the developed program, the leak rate was calculated for a circumferential crack in a sample pipe, and the effect of the flow model on the leak rate was examined. Treating the crack morphology parameters as random variables, the statistical behavior of the leak rate was also examined. As a result, {{it was found that the}} crack morphology parameters have a strong effect on the leak rate and the statistical behavior of the leak rate can be simulated using normally distributed crack morphology parameters...|$|E

40|$|Twelve {{patients}} with anal incontinence due to neurologic disease {{or failure of}} previous incontinence surgery underwent implantation of an artificial anal sphincter. The system used was a modification of the AMS 800 artificial urinary sphincter. In two patients, infection necessitated removal of the system, and in four patients, eight revisional procedures had to be performed because of mechanical failure. After various modifications of the system, especially reinforcement of the closing mechanism of the cuff, only one case of mechanical failure has occurred. Erosion through the anal canal did not occur. Among 10 {{patients with}} the system in function for more than 6 months, the result was considered excellent in 5, with only occasional leakage of flatus, good in 3, who occasionally <b>leaked</b> <b>liquid</b> feces and flatus, and acceptable in 2, in whom the cuff obstructed defecation.

40|$|A {{method that}} can be {{implemented}} with relatively simple electronic circuitry provides a capability for detecting leakage of an electrically conductive liquid from an electrically nonconductive underground pipe. Alternatively or in addition, the method {{can be applied to}} locate the pipe, {{whether or not there is}} a leak. Although the method is subject to limitations (some of which are described below), it is still attractive as an additional option for detecting leaks and locating pipes without need for extensive digging. The method is based on capacitive coupling of an alternating electrical signal from the liquid to a portable electronic unit that resembles a metal detector. A signal voltage is applied to the liquid at some convenient point along the pipe: for example, the signal could be coupled into the liquid via an aboveground metal pipe fitting, the interior surface of which is in contact with the liquid. The signal is conducted through the liquid in the pipe; in the case of diffusive <b>leak</b> of <b>liquid</b> into the surrounding ground, the signal is conducted through the leak, into the portion of the adjacent ground that has become soaked with the <b>liquid.</b> (A drip <b>leak</b> cannot be detected by this method because there is no conductive path between the liquid inside and the liquid outside the pipe.) The portable unit includes an electrically conductive plate connected to the input terminal of an amplifier. When the plate is brought near the pipe or the <b>leaked</b> <b>liquid,</b> a small portion of the signal power is coupled capacitively from the liquid to the plate. The user scans the plate near the ground surface to find the locus of maximum signal strength. The leak can be identified as a relatively wide area, contiguous with the location of the pipe, over which the signal is detectable...|$|R
50|$|After {{releasing}} {{even more}} contaminated {{water into the}} surrounding environment this spring, the Talvivaara Mining Company recently announced that mining operations restarted on Monday 13 May 2013.

Certainly the company is eager {{to recover from the}} serious financial losses that came with the accidental leak that began last year, and an earlier restart should help to restore the bottom line for this troubled fiscal year. According to the company, the resumption of ore production will improve overall water levels and site water management. Apparently this improvement will come through dissolving the contaminated waste water with more clean water. Additional waste water was leaked this spring to relieve stress {{on the walls of the}} leaky holding pond that was repaired last winter, to make room for the larger volumes of diluted waste water that is expected from the new waste management plan. There was no public mention of creating larger or additional holding ponds at this point, nor the possibility of simply cutting back on production.|$|R

30|$|Another risk {{associated}} with NPPs is that of contamination of the sort caused by the unmonitored and unplanned release of liquids. Commercial NPPs release radioactive materials into the environment, in either or both liquid or gaseous form, on a routine basis. There have been incidents of unplanned and unmonitored <b>leaks</b> of <b>liquids</b> that occurred at the Braidwood, Indian Point, Byron, and Dresden NPPs. The Liquid Radioactive Release Lessons Learned Task Force (LLTF) has been tasked with identifying the causes of such leaks (Richards et al. 2011). Their findings included the following: (1) the construction of plant components did not meet existing safety standards; (2) the components that caused or contributed to said leaks {{were not required to}} be monitored, nor were they subject to routine maintenance activities according to NRC regulations; (3) some components {{associated with}} subterranean leaks or with spent-fuel pools were not readily accessible or physically visible; (4) <b>liquid</b> <b>leaks</b> can enter undetected into groundwater; (5) the contamination of groundwater may go undetected because it is not required to be monitored according to existing NRC regulations; and (6) the contaminated groundwater could flow offsite undetected. The communities that host NPPs therefore, are at perpetual risk due to the presence of their local NPP.|$|R

The current study is an extension of the previous work reported by Peurrung et al. (1996).

The fourth and final objective of the current study was to predict the gas release behavior for a range of typical tank conditions and actual tank geometry. In these models, the authors seek to include all the pertinent salt-well pumping operational parameters and a realistic range of physical properties of the SST wastes.
