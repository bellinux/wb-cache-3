25|$|From the {{principle}} of relativity alone without assuming the constancy {{of the speed of}} light (i.e. using the isotropy of space and the symmetry implied by {{the principle}} of special relativity) one can show that the spacetime transformations between inertial frames are either Euclidean, Galilean, or Lorentzian.

500|$|In the 1970s, in {{collaboration}} with Ekkart Rudolph, Ehlers addressed the problem of rigid bodies in general relativity. Rigid bodies are a fundamental concept in classical physics. However, the fact that by definition their different parts move simultaneously is incompatible with the relativistic concept {{of the speed of}} light as a <b>limiting</b> <b>speed</b> for the propagation of signals and other influences. While, as early as 1909, Max Born had given a definition of rigidity that was compatible with relativistic physics, his definition depends on assumptions that are not satisfied in a general space-time, and are thus overly restrictive. Ehlers and Rudolph generalized Born's definition to a more readily applicable definition they called [...] "pseudo-rigidity", which represents a more satisfactory approximation to the rigidity of classical physics.|$|E
500|$|When viewing Rule 184 as {{a traffic}} model, {{it is natural}} to {{consider}} the average speed of the vehicles. When the density of traffic is less than 50%, this average speed is simply one unit of distance per unit of time: after the system stabilizes, no car ever slows. However, when the density is a number ρ greater than 1/2, the average speed of traffic is [...] Thus, the system exhibits a second-order kinetic phase transition at [...] When Rule 184 is interpreted as a traffic model, and started from a random configuration whose density is at this critical value , then the average speed approaches its stationary limit as the square root {{of the number of}} steps. Instead, for random configurations whose density is not at the critical value, the approach to the <b>limiting</b> <b>speed</b> is exponential.|$|E

5000|$|An {{alternative}} single {{instrument is}} the [...] "maximum allowable airspeed indicator." [...] It has a movable pointer that indicates the maximum operating limit (Vmo or Mmo). The movable pointer moves with altitude and temperature {{so that it}} always indicates the maximum allowable speed of the aircraft. The pointer is usually red-and-white striped, and thus known as a [...] "barber pole".

5000|$|The sail is tuned by {{adjusting}} the downhaul and the outhaul tension. Generally, a sail is trimmed more (flatter shape) for stronger winds. More downhaul tension loosens {{the upper part of}} the leech, allowing the top of the sail to twist and [...] "spill" [...] wind during gusts, shifting the center of effort (strictly, the center of pressure) down. Releasing downhaul tension shifts the center of effort up. More outhaul lowers the camber/draft, making the sail flatter and easier to control, but less powerful; less outhaul results in more draft, providing more low-end power, but usually <b>limiting</b> <b>speed</b> by increasing aerodynamic resistance.|$|E
5000|$|The first FFARs were {{developed}} by the U.S. Navy and introduced in June 1943. They had a 3.5-inch diameter and a non-explosive warhead, since they were used as an aircraft-launched ASW (Anti-Submarine Warfare) rocket and worked by puncturing the hull. It was accurate enough for use against surface ships and land targets, but these missions required an explosive warhead. A 5-inch anti-aircraft shell {{was attached to the}} 3.5-inch rocket motor, creating the 5-Inch FFAR, which entered service in December 1943. Performance was limited because of the increased weight, <b>limiting</b> <b>speed</b> to 780 km/h (485 mph). [...] The High Velocity Aircraft Rocket, or HVAR, was developed to fix this flaw.|$|E
