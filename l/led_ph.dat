40|$|The {{potential}} of the future for both science and design lies in a multidisciplinary approach. Disciplines are merging, boundaries are melting and “many […] technologies are not significant when looked at in isolation, but become of critical importance when coupled with other technologies. ” Introduction This paper offers a condensed case study of a cross-disciplinary practice <b>led</b> <b>Ph.</b> D. research “Skin Stories :: Charting and Mapping the Skin” which dealt with issues across the fields of design, art, textiles technology, electronics, biology, material science and psychology {{in an attempt to}} bridge the gap between aesthetics and technology. The artistic investigation examines skin as a naturally intelligent material on the premise that it can serve both as model and metaphor for creating innovative textile membranes, which look, behave or feel like a skin. Attention is focussed on the living skin “technology”, meaning its complex working mechanisms, and how these have been translated into a textiles vocabulary following the principles of biomimetic design. The paper examines a range of smart textile concepts for both the body and its various environments developed during this research project at the London College of Fashion, University of the Arts London (2000 - 2004). The paper also addresses the current textile practice and research of the author which deals with issues surrounding human sensory perceptions (touch, smell, vision, hearing) and how our sensory experiences could be enhanced using smart design concepts. It has been proven that the environment has a huge impact on peoples’ behaviour, relationships, their physical and psychological wellbeing. The author is particularly interested in the emerging scientific notion - called “sensism” - of how “subtle multisensory cues drive our perceptions, behaviour, decisions and performance. ” For example, visual images and olfactory messages influence peoples’ minds in subliminal, emotional, subconscious ways and this can be successfully used in new polysensual and therapeutic design concepts that support peoples‘ wellbeing and interactions. Addressing this context the practice led inquiry reflects on current developments within materials research and technologies by considering their possible applications within design and arts to create new sensory environments that respond to peoples‘ needs and improve the quality of our lives. Identification is made of areas of applications where responsive, active and interactive textiles systems, adapted from the biological skin workings, could prove to be of some value. Albeit the preoccupation with the technological and biomedical aspects the author also was constantly interested in the poetic and social context of the epidermis, as from a designer‘s point of view it was important to capture the multi-layered nature of the skin...|$|E

NaOH solution was added to (CH 3 COOH) 2 Zn. 2 H 2 O solution by titration until colloids with different pH were obtained, then precipitates of nano ZnO were formed. From the precipitation profile, it can be observed that increasing <b>pH</b> <b>led</b> to shortened precipitation time, which also means increasing particle size. It was also further confirmed that particle size at pH 7 and pH 12 was 1. 3 nm and 73. 8 nm, respectively.

As a part of this thesis, large-scale survey of 730 respondents was collected. The survey was tailored for the needs of a value-based selling research group <b>led</b> by <b>Ph.</b> D. Harri Terho. The research group used convenience sampling to select the salespeople of 25 medium- and large-scale companies in Finland which currently either practice value-based selling or consider developing these activities.

Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) {{are the most}} commonly found PFC compounds, and thus their fate and transport play key roles in PFC distribution in the natural environment. The kinetic behavior of PFOS or PFOA on boehmite consists of a fast adsorption process followed by a slow adsorption process which {{may be attributed to}} the slow transport of PFOS or PFOA into the boehmite pore surface. The adsorption isotherms estimated the maximum adsorption capacities of PFOS and PFOA on boehmite as 0. 877 μg/m 2 and 0. 633 μg/m 2, with the difference primarily due to their different functional groups. The increase of solution <b>pH</b> <b>led</b> to a moderate decrease of PFOS and PFOA adsorption, owing to the increase of ligand exchange reactions and the decrease of electrostatic interactions.

Compared to the adsorption capacity on γ-alumina, the abundant hydroxyl groups on boehmite surfaces resulted in the 2 - 3 times higher adsorption of PFOS and PFOA. Increasing solution <b>pH</b> <b>led</b> to a moderate decrease in PFOS and PFOA adsorption, owing {{to an increase in}} ligand exchange reactions and the decrease of electrostatic interactions. The presence of NaCl and CaCl 2 in solution demonstrated negative effects for PFOS and PFOA adsorption on boehmite surfaces, with potential mechanisms being electrical double layer compression, competitive adsorption of chloride, and the Ca 2 + bridging effect between perfluorochemicals. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Twenty-three stream sites {{representing}} {{a range of}} forested, agricultural, and urban land uses were sampled in the South Platte River Basin of Colorado from July through September 2002 to characterize water quality during drought conditions. With a few exceptions, dissolved ammonia, Kjeldahl nitrogen, total phosphorus, and dissolved orthophosphate concentrations were similar to seasonal historical levels in all land use areas during the drought. At some agricultural sites, decreased dilution of irrigation return flow {{may have contributed to}} higher concentrations of some nutrient species, increased primary productivity, and higher dissolved oxygen concentrations. At some urban sites, decreased dilution of base flow and wastewater treatment plant effluent may have contributed to higher dissolved nitrite-plus-nitrate concentrations, increased primary productivity, and higher dissolved oxygen concentrations. Total pesticide concentrations in urban and agricultural areas were not consistently higher or lower during the drought. At most forested sites, decreased dilution of ground water-derived calcium bicarbonate type base flow likely <b>led</b> to elevated <b>pH</b> and specific-conductance values. Water temperatures at many of the forested sites also were higher, contributing to lower dissolved oxygen concentrations during the drought...|$|R
40|$|The {{antimicrobial}} {{properties of}} tulathromycin were investigated for M.  haemolytica and P.  multocida. Three in vitro indices of antimicrobial activity, {{minimum inhibitory concentration}} (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and time-kill curves, were established for six isolates of each organism. Each index was measured in two growth media: Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB) and calf serum. It was shown that MICs and MBCs were markedly lower in serum than in MHB. MHB:serum ratios for MIC were 47 : 1 (M.  haemolytica) and 53 : 1 (P.  multocida). For both serum and MHB, adjustment of <b>pH</b> <b>led</b> to greater potency at alkaline compared to acid pH. Tulathromycin MIC was influenced by size of inoculum count, being 4. 0 - to 7. 7 -fold greater for high compared to low initial counts. It was concluded that {{for the purpose of}} determining dosages for therapeutic use, pharmacodynamic data for tulathromycin should be derived in biological fluids such as serum. It is hypothesized that in vitro measurement of MIC in broth, conducted according to internationally recommended standards, may be misleading as a basis for estimating the in vivo potency of tulathromycin...|$|R
40|$|The {{persistent}} {{nature of}} perfluorochemicals (PFCs) has attracted global concern in recent years. Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) {{are the most}} commonly found PFC compounds, and thus their fate and transport play key roles in PFC distribution in the natural environment. The kinetic behavior of PFOS or PFOA on boehmite consists of a fast adsorption process followed by a slow adsorption process which {{may be attributed to}} the slow transport of PFOS or PFOA into the boehmite pore surface. The adsorption isotherms estimated the maximum adsorption capacities of PFOS and PFOA on boehmite as 0. 877 μg/m 2 and 0. 633 μg/m 2, with the difference primarily due to their different functional groups. The increase of solution <b>pH</b> <b>led</b> to a moderate decrease of PFOS and PFOA adsorption, owing to the increase of ligand exchange reactions and the decrease of electrostatic interactions. The presence of NaCl in solution demonstrated negative effects for PFOS and PFOA adsorption on boehmite surfaces, with potential mechanisms being electrical double layer compression, competitive adsorption of chloride. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
