Acoustic engineers might work in acoustic consultancy, specializing in particular fields, such as architectural acoustics, environmental noise or vibration control. In other industries, acoustic engineers might: design automobile sound systems; investigate human response to sounds, such as urban soundscapes and domestic appliances; develop audio signal processing software for mixing desks, and design <b>loudspeakers</b> <b>and</b> <b>microphones</b> for mobile phones.

50|$|Electro-acoustic {{devices such}} as <b>loudspeakers</b> <b>and</b> <b>microphones</b> present special {{problems}} for analysis, as they must receive or transmit signals through air. In these cases, the DUT in the model shown above must be replaced with the complete electro-mechanical system, e.g., a power amplifier to drive a loudspeaker, a loudspeaker, a measurement microphone and microphone pre-amplifier. The actual device under test can be measured only when the other devices in this system are fully characterized, so that the contributions from these devices may be subtracted from the response. Many modern audio analyzers contain measurement sequences that automate this procedure, and the focus of recent developments has been on quasi-anechoic measurements. These techniques allow loudspeakers to be characterised in a non-ideal (noisy) environment, {{without the need for}} an anechoic chamber, which makes them ideally suited for use in high volume production line manufacturing. Most quasi-anechoic measurements are based around an impulse response created from a sine wave whose frequency is swept on a logarithmic scale, with a window function applied to remove any acoustic reflections. The log swept sine method increases signal-to-noise ratio and also allows measurement of individual distortion harmonics up to the Nyquist frequency, something which previously impossible with older analysis techniques such as MLS (Maximum Length Sequence).|$|E

30|$|In this context, {{acoustic}} echo cancellation (AEC) provides {{one of the}} best solutions to the control of {{acoustic echo}}es generated by hands-free audio terminals. The basic issue in AEC is then to estimate the impulse response between the <b>loudspeaker</b> <b>and</b> the <b>microphone</b> of the device. The most reliable solution to this problem is the use of an adaptive filter that generates at its output a replica of the echo, which is further subtracted from the microphone signal [1 – 9]. In other words, the adaptive filter has to model an unknown system (i.e., the acoustic echo path between the <b>loudspeaker</b> <b>and</b> the <b>microphone),</b> like in a “system identification” problem [10 – 12].|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} years (until approx. 1985) {{the use of the}} STI was largely limited to a {{relatively}} small international community of speech researchers. The introduction of the RASTI ("Room Acoustics STI") made the STI method available to a larger population of engineers and consultants, especially when Bruel & Kjaer introduced their RASTI measuring device (which was based on the earlier RASTI system developed by Steeneken and Houtgast at TNO). RASTI was designed to be much faster than the original ("full") STI, taking less than 30 seconds instead of 15 minutes for a measuring point. However, RASTI was only intended (as the name says) for pure room acoustics, not electro-acoustics. Application of RASTI to transmission chains featuring electro-acoustic components (such as <b>loudspeakers</b> <b>and</b> <b>microphones)</b> became fairly common, and led to complaints about inaccurate results. The use of RASTI was even specified by some application standards (such as CAA specification 15 for aircraft cabin PA systems) for applications featuring electro-acoustics, simply {{because it was the only}} feasible method at the time. The inadequacies of RASTI were sometimes simply accepted for lack of a better alternative. TNO did produce and sell instruments for measuring full STI and various other STI derivatives, but these devices were relatively expensive, large and heavy.|$|E
