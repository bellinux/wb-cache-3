From tomographic images, we show that several factors affect the wetting and filling of catalytic baskets. The complex hybrid structure of catalytic packings influences the liquid distribution inside the elements. The liquid preferentially fills the external catalytic baskets because they receive the liquid not only from the packing element situated above but also from the wall wipers. Moreover, liquid hold-up inside a catalytic basket section depends significantly on the vertical position in the packing element and on the position of the packing in the column packed bed. The counter-current gas flow speeds up the process of liquid filling of the baskets, also for low liquid loads.

We found that the change in the resonant frequency of in-liquid QCM consisted of two parts: besides the frequency changes due to the mass and viscous load (which could be equivalent to motional inductance), the second part of frequency change was caused by the increase of motional resistance. The theoretical calculation and simulation proved that the increases of QCM motional resistance may indeed cause the decreases of resonant frequency, and revealed that the existence of static capacitance was the root cause of this frequency change. The second part of frequency change (due to the increases of motional resistance) was difficult to measure accurately, and may cause great error for in-liquid QCM applications. A technical method to reduce the interference caused by this effect is presented.

30|$|Two-phase (gas–liquid) flow in {{vertical}} pipes {{has been}} one of the interests of industrial applications such as power plants, nuclear reactors, boilers, gas well exploration and so on. One of the problems usually encountered in the gas well exploration industries is liquid loading: a condition where the gas velocity is not high enough to carry all the liquid generated in the gas wells. During normal operation, flow in the gas wells shows characteristics of annular flow regime. However, as the gas wells mature, the gas velocities reduce (below a critical value) and gradually lead to the onset of <b>liquid</b> <b>loading</b> (film reversal). At this point, flow in the gas well presents features of churn flow. Thus, during the film reversal point, the liquid film tends to increase in thickness and part of it starts to flow downwards. This paper first summarizes the available mechanistic and numerical models related to <b>liquid</b> <b>loading</b> and then reviews the application of CFD techniques to <b>liquid</b> <b>loading</b> modeling in vertical pipes. Most of the methodologies discussed here focus on annular and churn flow due to the limited information on the application of CFD techniques to <b>liquid</b> <b>loading</b> modeling and the onset of film reversal occurs during the transition from annular flow to churn flow which can lead to <b>liquid</b> <b>loading</b> as observed experimentally by many researchers.

Dynamic monitoring data of the Samandepe Gasfield in Turkmenistan shows that liquid loading can be found extensively in gas wells.

With their origins taken into consideration, liquid loads in gas wells were classified into three types: formation water, condensed liquid, and external liquid. By using the hydrostatic pressure gradient method and through PLT monitoring, properties of liquid loads in the Samandepe Gasfield were determined. In addition, formation mechanisms related to liquid loading in gas wells were obtained through analyses of critical fluid-carrying capacities and by using gas-reservoir production data. The following findings were obtained. Liquid loading was commonly found in this gas well with majority of reservoir formations in lower well intervals flooded. However, the formation mechanisms for these liquid loads {{are different from those}} of other gasfields. Due to long-term shut-down of gas wells, killing fluids precipitated and pores in lower reservoir formations were plugged. As a result, natural gas had no access to boreholes, killing fluids were impossibly carried out of the borehole. Instead, the killing fluid was detained at the bottomhole to generate <b>liquid</b> <b>load</b> and eliminate the possibility of formation water coning. Moreover, since the gasfield was dominated by block reservoirs with favorable physical properties and connectivity, impacts of <b>liquid</b> <b>load</b> on gasfield development were insignificant.

Meso-scale simulations of structured packings are often limited in the literature to dry pressure drop analyses whereas mass transfer characteristics and gas–liquid interface tracking are usually investigated at micro-scale. This work aims at testing further capabilities of meso-scale modeling by implementing the interface tracking instead of analyzing only the dry pressure drop performance with single-phase simulations. By doing so, {{it is possible to}} present also the hydrodynamics (i. e. liquid hold-up and interfacial area) for a small set of representative elementary units (REUs). The interest in interface tracking using commercial geometries lies on the fact that liquid hold-up and interfacial area have implications of capital importance on the overall performance of the absorber, hence the importance of developing a model to predict them accurately. The results show how the relationship, reported in the literature, between the <b>liquid</b> <b>load</b> and both the liquid hold-up and the interfacial area is reproduced by the present CFD methodology. Also, a more realistic visualization is accomplished with images of the inner irregularities of the flow (i. e. liquid maldistribution, formation of droplets and rivulets, etc.), which lie far from the prevailing assumption of the formation of a perfectly developed liquid film over the packing. Moreover, the effect of operating parameters such as the <b>liquid</b> <b>load,</b> liquid viscosity and liquid–solid contact angle on the amount of interfacial area available for mass transfer is also discussed.

40|$|Liquid {{column that}} accumulates in the {{wellbore}} {{leading to the}} reduction or completely preventing the production of gas well is called <b>liquid</b> <b>loading.</b> This is one phenomenon that is essential because in other to optimize the recovery of hydrocarbon from the gas reservoir and {{to prevent the occurrence}} of <b>liquid</b> <b>loading,</b> pressure differential as a function of flow rate across the valves must not be neglected. Several options have been employed in well completions to predict <b>liquid</b> <b>loading</b> and how it can be mitigated but the results have shown varying degrees of discrepancies and hence cannot be easily used because of the challenges involved in predicting the bottomhole pressure in a multiphase flow. In the last decades, different techniques and correlations have been offered by many authors for determination of critical <b>liquid</b> <b>loading</b> rate.

None of the previously described models considered pressure drop along the functional node. It is therefore, evidently effective when compared analytically with Turner, Guo and Fadairo models. The result shows that the flow rate during the transient stage is faster than that of Fadairo and it became stable at a certain time during production. It was also observed that the minimum energy required to lift liquid out of the wellbore is higher than that at the initial production stage.

The basic principle of LSS preparation is conversion of the drug in liquid state into a free-flowing, compressible, dry powder through its absorption into suitable excipients – porous carriers (aluminometasilicates, microcrystalline cellulose), subsequently coated with material having high absorption capacity (silicon dioxide commonly known as colloidal silica). LSS exhibit advantages such as lower production costs compared to soft capsules; simple processing and providing enhanced drug release. The main benefit is higher bioavailability of the liquid drug, caused by a large surface area available for absorption. The article tries to clarify specific aspects connected with the formulation of LSS: properties of excipients (surface area, absorption capacity), variables related to the processing (solubility, <b>liquid</b> <b>load</b> factor) and dosage form evaluatio...|$|E

30|$|Two main {{approaches}} were {{proposed by}} Turner et al. (1969) {{to predict the}} onset of <b>liquid</b> <b>loading</b> in gas wells. First, a model using liquid film movement on the pipe wall and second, a model from the entrained droplets flowing in the gas core. He concluded that estimation of the critical gas velocity {{should be based on}} the droplet model only. Due to this, most analyses on <b>liquid</b> <b>loading</b> were made by modifying his droplet model as in Coleman et al. (1991), Nosseir et al. (2000), Li et al. (2016) and Tan et al. (2013). Nevertheless, after conducting series of experiments, Westende (2008) suggested that the idea of the liquid film instability should be used to characterize <b>liquid</b> <b>loading.</b> This approach (<b>liquid</b> film instability) has been experimentally studied by Zabaras et al. (1986), Belt (2007) and Guner (2012).|$|R
