Though it moves in straight lines on a regular schedule, urban road traffic is a textbook chaotic system, in which seemingly minor causes can have colossal knock-on effects on gridlock. Annoyingly, many {{of them seem to}} cluster in September. In Washington, D.

The reason, city planners believe, is that in August, commuters drive at rush hour according to their own schedules, a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>early</b> one day, a bit late the next. But in September, those with children to drop at school suddenly have a firm time to leave, causing cars to cluster, creating the inevitable traffic jams.

We’ve recently seen several “best books of the year” lists, but not many of their selections have links to China — reflecting the fact that 2009 was something of an off-year in the China-related publishing field (especially compared to the deluge of releases during the Olympic year of 2008). Of the “ 100 Notable Books of 2009 ”chosen by the New York Times, only Hannah Pakula’s biography of Madame Chiang Kai-shek made the cut; Mathieu Borysevicz’s Learning From Hangzhou was featured in the NYT “Art and Architecture” holiday gift guide. Over at The Economist, Poorly Made in China by Paul Midler was picked as a best book of the year. 2. On the whole, though, China is a big story — more accurately, it’s the big story, according to calculations of the “Top News Stories of the Decade,” discussed at theWall Street Journal’s “China Real Time Report”: The results weren’t even close. GLM says the “Rise of China” (it searched the phrase itself and related word groupings) had a score 400 % that of the No. 2 Internet story – the Iraq War. China also beat out the 9 / 11 terrorist attacks, the election of Barack Obama, the global recession, and even the death of Michael Jackson (No. 5).

I have always read James as a fellow traveler of Edmund Husserl, and placed both {{in a line of}} thought that might share Franz Brentano and Wilhelm Dilthey as forebears.

40|$|The {{role of the}} {{auxiliary}} scalar field phi of BD theory in baryon number asymmetry is discussed in this paper. We consider a derivative coupling of this gravitational scalar field to the baryon current J(B) (mu) or the current of the baryon number minus lepton number J(B-L) (mu), based {{on a series of}} works of R.

However, the Einstein equation tells us that (R) over circle = 0 in the radiation-dominated epoch of the standard FRW cosmology. In this paper we reconsider the feasibility of having gravitational baryongenesis with such a form of interaction in radiation-filled BD cosmology. We show that (R) over circle does not vanish in this case and the required baryon number asymmetry can also be achieved...|$|E

40|$|Effects of {{nutritional}} factors, plant growth regulators, and physical factors on {{the conversion of}} isolated embryos into plantlets of Pinus radiata were investigated. Results showed that nutritional factors were critical to the conversion of isolated embryos into plantlets of P. radiata. The optimum medium strength was half strength of the medium consisting of modified Quoirin and Le Poivre (LP) salts (von Arnold and Eriksson 1981) and Schenk and Hildebrandt (1972) (SH) vitamins. Sucrose (3 %) as well as glucose (2 - 3 %) and fructose (2 - 5 %) could serve as carbon sources for the conversion of isolated embryos into plantlets of P. radiata. In general, a few significant benefits were found {{with the addition of}} organic nitrogen sources tested on the performance of isolated zygotic embryos into plantlets of P. radiata. Nearly all plant growth regulators tested were not beneficial for the conversion of isolated zygotic embryos into plantlets of P. radiata, and some of them had negative effect. Only GA₃ (gibberellic acid at 0. 58 μM) seemed to stimulate embryos to germinate a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>earlier</b> in comparison with the control. Submerging the cotyledons of the isolated embryo into the agar-gelled medium showed better growth in comparison with the control. Embryos cultured in liquid medium grew better but the germination percentage was apparently lower compared with 0. 8 % agar-gelled medium. liquid medium with sponge support could increase the percentage of germinated isolated embryos but the embryo growth was not comparable to the liquid medium only. The addition of PEG (polyethylene glycol) 6000 to the liquid medium seemed to increase the germination percentage and had no negative effect on the growth of isolated embryo. Light could influence embryo growth in different ways. For root growth, 16 -hour photoperiod appeared to be the best, but for cotyledon development continuous light condition seemed to be the best. In continuous darkness, the hypocotyl appeared to elongate more, but the cotyledon and root did not grow well. Isolated embryos cultured on the optimum medium (LPSH 2) grew well. The resulting plantlets (i. e. emblings) appeared normal, but were smaller than seedlings. Studies on biochemical changes during germination and early embling or seedling growth showed that the patterns of changes in total protein, soluble sugar, and starch content were generally different between emblings and seedlings. However, on fresh weight basis, total protein concentrations and their SDS-PAGE profiles showed that there was little difference between emblings and seedlings. Results of this study should be helpful as a basic reference for the artificial seed technology development starting from germination and plant conversion of P. Radiate somatic embryo with an artificial megagametophyte...|$|E

Olivier Peslier took over the ride when make believe was one of eighteen colt to contest the Poule d'Essai des Poulains over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. He was made the 5/1 second favourite behind the Aidan O'Brien-trained Highland Reel with the Prix de Fontainebleau runner-up Karar next in the betting. Few of the others were given any serious chance, but the more fancied outsiders included Muhaarar from England and the Fabre stable's second runner New Bay. Peslier sent the colt into the lead from the start and set a steady pace before accelerating clear of the field 400 metres from the finish. He never looked in any danger of defeat and won by three lengths from New Bay with Mr Owen and Karar in third and fourth.
