The author examines various alternative explanations of the personal distribution of income to answer the question how the distribution objective can be attained and what effect certain measures of distribution policy have on growth...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show that the {{progressive}} income tax in Australia has achieved some equity in terms of income redistribution by personal income taxation. There are many redistributional aspects associated with the actions and policies of governments. For example, public education is primarily a redistribution of income from the wealthy to the poor, from small families to large ones and from older to younger generations. Debate also centres on whether the redistribution should be in terms of public goods, cash benefits or progressive income taxes. This study aims to refute the argument that has been expressed that the progressive income tax system has failed to achieve any equity through redistribution of income. Data examined in this study show that annual <b>levelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>incomes</b> has occurred through taxation especially in the last decade. It is not the {{purpose of this}} paper to argue whether the primary (or pre-tax) income redistribution is more equitable in 1979 - 80 than in 1950 - 51. Rather comment is made on what can be established in terms of the incidence or redistributive impact of income tax, i. e. whether the secondary (or post-tax) income is more equitable than the primary in each year considered. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{observe that}} {{countries}} at low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> invest at lower rates than those at higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>income.</b> This paper explains this fact {{as a consequence}} of Engel's law, i. e. that there is an inverse relation between expenditure and its proportion spent on food. It introduces non-homothetic preferences based on Engel's law in a simple Solow model. These preferences imply rates of net investment that increase with the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> as we approach the steady state. Increasing investment rates imply a positive correlation between growth rates and the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>income,</b> at low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>income,</b> rather than an inverse relation, as the usual Solow model implies. The existence of a positive correlation between income growth rates and income levels, at low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> in the presence of this type of preference, has already been shown in a previous paper for a closed economy. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to show that this positive correlation persists when we introduce trade into the model. Engel's Law, Growth, Investment Rates,...|$|R

5000|$|Four {{years after}} the {{publishing}} of the original article, Harry Markowitz, {{a former student of}} Friedman's, argued that some of the implications of the Friedman-Savage utility function were paradoxical. Specifically, its implication that those at the highest <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> would never take risks. His solution was to relate the curvature of an individual's utility function to increases in wealth. This involved determining an individual's [...] "normal" [...] <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>income,</b> controlling for utility gains from [...] "recreational investments" [...] (The psychological utility gained by the act of gambling), and measuring deviations from the initial <b>level</b> <b>of</b> utility at the [...] "normal" [...] <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>income.</b>|$|R
40|$|How {{a person}} assesses the {{wellbeing}} derived from income is often determined {{as much by}} its contrast with a reference point as by the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> itself. In this paper, I use a household survey from Mexico to examine how subjective poverty assessments not only depend on the absolute <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>income,</b> but on how it compares to three reference points: the <b>income</b> <b>of</b> a reference group, the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> that the individual aspired to have accomplished by the current stage of her life, and the income she had 3 years ago. I find that subjective poverty assessments evidence reference-dependence in the income domain relative to reference groups and aspirations, but not with respect to previous <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>income.</b> Further, {{the results indicate that}} 'keeping up with the Joneses'' behaviour is a feature only of the upper-middle class, and that the inability to exceed income aspirations increases the probability of subjective poverty regardless of the individual's position in the income distribution...|$|R
