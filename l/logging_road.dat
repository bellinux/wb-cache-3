5|$|The {{critical}} {{decision for}} the Saigon government was made two days later at Cam Ranh Bay during a meeting between Thiệu and General Phu. Thiệu decided that Pleiku and Kon Tum were to be abandoned and that the forces defending them would be redeployed to retake demographically more important Ban Mê Thuột. Phu informed the president that the only route possible for the redeployment, given PAVN blocking actions, was little-used Interprovincial Route 7B, a neglected, narrow, rough-surfaced track (actually a <b>logging</b> <b>road)</b> with several downed bridges along its course.|$|E

25|$|In 2011, a Maine Forest Service {{employee}} {{found an}} ejection seat from the aircraft near an overgrown <b>logging</b> <b>road</b> while hunting. In May 2012 {{he returned to}} the site to take photos and record identification numbers to confirm it came from the ill-fated B-52. A recovery team retrieved the mostly intact ejection seat. Researchers claim that it is most likely the pilot's seat and remarkably similar to the seat at the snowmobile clubhouse in Greenville. It is the third seat recovered from the crash and preserved for public viewing. The other is in a Bangor museum.|$|E
25|$|For nearly 25years, {{the company}} cut virgin cedar and fir {{on the old}} Tryon {{homestead}} to use in its foundry in Lake Oswego. More logging occurred from 1912 until 1961, and in 1969 Multnomah County bought {{part of the old}} property to use as a park. More land was added and a state park was created in 1970, later changed to Tryon Creek State Natural Area. Tryon Creek, which flows through Tryon Creek State Natural Area and the former Tryon property to join the Willamette River near Lake Oswego, was named for Tryon. The Oregon Iron Company's <b>logging</b> <b>road</b> later became Old Iron Mountain Trail in the state natural area.|$|E
25|$|According to the IUCN, {{the species}} is {{declared}} vulnerable overall. The main conservation threat to the junaluska salamanders is human disturbances, such as <b>logging,</b> <b>road</b> construction, and development in urban areas. These disturbances affect the water quality and therefore affect the small populations of this rare species. The disruption of the breeding sites of the junaluska can interrupt the breeding time between fall and early spring that could be detrimental to the larval population. North Carolina and Tennessee have different listings for this species in respect to the conservation concerns for the species. In North Carolina, E. junaluska {{is said to be}} state threatened and a federal species of special concern. In Tennessee, {{the species is}} listed as imperiled and deemed in need of management. Conservation efforts are important for this species, since it is endemic to the United States, particularly in North Carolina and Tennessee. Also, it is important to conserve them since the population is said to be less than 1,000 individuals overall.|$|E

25|$|The {{trail is}} located in Hope, New York, 5 {{and a half miles}} South of Wells, NY. It is a 1.8 mile trail, {{including}} 3 waterfalls each ranging between 10 and 30 feet tall. The trail was originally a major <b>logging</b> <b>road</b> that ran to Devorse creek, but the road was abandoned and later the first 2 miles of it began seeing use as a hiking trail. Part of the old road runs along a steep gorge, where loggers had to build a flying trestle to allow horses to pull logs from nearby camps. Groff mountain has a large population of eastern hemlock and red spruce. Historically, these attracted tanners from nearby towns. Because of the dense forestation, the area is largely shaded, and so often maintains snow throughout the winter. The trail sees use from hikers during the spring and summer, and snowshoers in winter. There is a small parking area for the trail at the end of River road.|$|E

500|$|In 1850, Socrates Hotchkiss Tryon, Sr., {{a pioneer}} settler of European descent, {{established}} a donation land claim {{at the south}} end of Tryon Creek canyon. Five years later, he died, leaving the land to his wife, Frances. The land then passed to other relatives, including Socrates Tryon, Jr., who sold the [...] in 1874 to the Oregon Iron Company. For nearly 25years, the company cut virgin cedar and fir to use in its foundry in Lake Oswego. Its <b>logging</b> <b>road</b> later became Old Iron Mountain Trail in the Tryon Creek State Natural Area. In 1900, fire in the upper canyon left charred snags still visible along the natural area's Center and Big Fir trails.|$|E
500|$|The roadway {{turns back}} to the shore and two overlooks next to the lake. Overlook9 is next to the bluff on Lake Michigan, [...] above the water, and overlook10 is for views of the Sleeping Bear Dune. From overlook9, {{visitors}} can see Platte Bay some [...] to the south on a clear day. These two locations are considered especially hazardous because of the heights involved. In 2002, the Detroit Free Press noted that a half-dozen visitors have to be rescued by paramedics at these two overlooks after falls. The community of Glen Arbor has a special off-road vehicle to effect rescues {{from the base of the}} cliffs. The penultimate stop along the drive is the North Bar Overlook and Picnic Area, which provides vistas of North Bar Lake. After this stop, the drive descends into maple and pine forests before coming back to the starting point. This area follows an old <b>logging</b> <b>road</b> under the forest canopy. The drive has been called [...] "the best way to see Lake Michigan from top of the dune elevations", and [...] "one of the nation's most fascinating landscapes".|$|E

2500|$|The Mattole River's mainstem is [...] {{in length}} and has more than 74 tributaries.

The coho salmon is a federally listed threatened species (Southern Oregon/Northern California populations) that use the Mattole River [...] and its tributary, Mill Creek. Increased sediment and lack of tree cover reduced {{the quality and quantity}} of fish habitat by increasing summer water temperatures.

2500|$|When he {{returned}} to the camp he and Patterson aborted their plan to remain looking for more evidence and departed for home, fearing the rain would wash out their exit. After attempting to go out along [...] "the low road"—Bluff Creek Road—and finding it blocked by a mudslide, they went instead up the steep Onion Mountain Road, off whose shoulder their truck slipped; extracting it required the (unauthorized) borrowing of a nearby front-end loader. The drive home from their campsite covered about 580 miles, the initial 28.8 miles on a low-speed <b>logging</b> <b>road,</b> and then about 110 miles on twisty Route 96. Driving a truck with three horses, and allowing for occasional stops, it would have taken 13 hours to get home Saturday evening, at an average speed of 45mph; it would have taken 14.5 hours at a 40mph average speed.|$|E
