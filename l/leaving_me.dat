500|$|Mimi bought {{volumes of}} short stories for Lennon, and her husband taught Lennon to read {{at the age of}} five by reading aloud the {{headlines}} of the Liverpool Echo. Every summer, from the age of nine until he was fifteen, she sent Lennon alone on a ten-hour bus journey to visit his Aunt Mater and cousin Stanley Parkes at their home near Loch Meadie in Durness, Scotland. Mimi also took her charge to a garden party in Calderstones Park every year, where a Salvation Army band played. She remembered Lennon pulling her by the hand to get there, saying, [...] "Hurry up Mimi – we’re going to be late". Strawberry Field, in Beaconsfield Road, was the name of a Salvation Army house that Lennon would later immortalise in the Beatles' song, [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever".

The bugs were described as disruptive to gameplay and [...] "downright infuriating", and one reviewer encountered a [...] "showstopper bug" [...] in the initial retail version that prevented him from playing the game past a certain point. The bugs were said to negatively affect NPC AI, camera operation, and pathfinding. One review stated [...] "The launch–to–load time is fairly long so be prepared to wonder if the game has crashed or is loading." [...] Obsidian was quick to release fixes for several bugs, but later reviews still described the glitches as a serious problem. 1UP.com's review, written two weeks after the game's release, stated [...] "But the sad truth is that NWN2 shipped in a pretty messy state, and even after a couple patches (as of this writing), the biggest problems remain." ...|$|E

500|$|Still {{during the}} race, the {{stewards}} handed Nico Hülkenberg a three-place grid penalty {{for the following}} race in Japan for causing the collision with Felipe Massa on lap 14. Hülkenberg was [...] "frustrated" [...] with the decision, saying: [...] "The accident with Felipe was very unlucky and I don't understand why I've been given a penalty before there has even been the chance to discuss the incident in the stewards' room [...] In my view it was my corner and I'm surprised Felipe backed out of it much too late, locking up just before he hit me." [...] Massa had a different view about the incident, stating: [...] "I was braking for the corner and he turned his car in on mine, <b>leaving</b> <b>me</b> with nowhere to go, so we hit." [...] Force India decided not to appeal the decision. Williams's Head of Vehicle Performance Rob Smedley lamented the slow pit stop of his team that preceded the incident, saying that Massa should have exited the pit lane safely ahead of Hülkenberg. While initial reactions in the United Kingdom agreed with the stewards' decision, German tabloid Bild called the penalty a [...] "joke". Hülkenberg later accepted {{that he was at}} fault and apologised to Massa via text message. Concerning the accident between Button and Maldonado, no further action was taken by the stewards. Jenson Button however followed up on his [...] "mental"-remark during the race, by stating that he felt Maldonado's driving was [...] "very strange" [...] and that he [...] "won't ever change". Maldonado answered by saying: [...] "No driver's happy if there's a car {{in front of them and}} they want to get past, especially if it damages their car trying to overtake [...] We both got damage to our cars; he was behind me trying to get past, I was defending my position.
