500|$|Though {{critics have}} pointed out the song's {{similarities}} {{to some of the}} hits by the Police, Mars told MTV News that he did not intend to write anything mimicking by the Sting-fronted band. Instead, it came to him out of the blue, one night during his studio sessions prior to recording the Unorthodox Jukebox album. [...] "I don't think it initially tried to sound <b>like</b> <b>anybody</b> else, but I picked up the guitar and just started playing ," [...] Mars explained. [...] "That's how it normally works; I'll pick up a guitar and I'll start humming a melody, and I started singing that, and I was up there in Sting-ville, in that register, so that's what you get...". John Marx, a partner in the music division at William Morris Endeavor (WME), who was responsible for managing the Moonshine Jungle Tour said [...] "it's the type of song that really motivates people to purchase a ticket. It has that live element to it; it was a very active track".|$|E
500|$|A {{report about}} the concert at issue {{released}} on May 26, 2010 by topzine.cz stated that [...] "one {{of the things that}} was unexpected was the behavior of the singer Randall Blythe, who on a few occasions struck some fans in a relatively brutal way off the stage." [...] The article also contains pictures, one of them showing Blythe holding a fan down on the ground. Meanwhile, another report released two days after the concert by metalopolis.net alleged that [...] "Randy in a totally uncompromising way took down an impertinent fan, who has climbed the podium several times. The front-man clearly showed that it is his territory, he struck the intruder down, punched him a couple of times and sent him through the air off the podium, without even stopping singing (!)" [...] On May 28, 2010, the report by marastmusic.com stated that [...] "some broken head was a testimony to the fact that the band does not <b>like</b> <b>anybody</b> on the stage", [...] while abysszine.com stated that [...] "the only negative thing about the concert was, to say it mildly, disputable approach of the band towards the stage-divers ... when somebody tried to climb the stage, he was brutally swept down." ...|$|E
500|$|Orr feuded with Toronto rookie defenceman Pat Quinn that season. In a late season game, Orr {{attempted}} {{to knock the}} puck loose from Maple Leafs goaltender Bruce Gamble and Quinn cross-checked Orr to the ice. Orr kicked Quinn and Quinn kicked Orr. On-ice officials broke it up, but the feud continued into the 1969 playoffs. The Bruins {{finished second in the}} NHL's East Division and drew the Maple Leafs in the first round. In the first game, in Boston, Quinn caught Orr with his head down during a rush, and caught him with an open-ice hit, knocking Orr unconscious. Quinn, assessed five minutes for elbowing, was attacked in the penalty box by a fan and Quinn swung at the fan with his stick, breaking the glass. When Quinn returned, the Boston fans showered garbage onto the ice. Orr was carried out on a stretcher to the dressing room where he revived after the concussion. According to a Boston police officer at the scene, [...] "The fans here don't <b>like</b> <b>anybody</b> to touch Orr. He's their Frank Merriwell and Jack Armstrong rolled into one. To my thinking, it looked like a clean check." [...] The game degenerated into a brawl after the score reached 10–0 for the Bruins. The Bruins went on to sweep the Maple Leafs before losing in six games to the Montreal Canadiens in the second round. Orr returned for the third game against Toronto, getting two assists as the Bruins won their first games in Toronto since 1965.|$|E

500|$|Hochuli's {{presence}} {{on the football field}} has created a cult following. His rise in popularity {{is believed to have been}} started by Phil Simms, a former NFL quarterback and current color commentator for the NFL on CBS, who made reference to the size of Hochuli's arms during a telecast. [...] On the Internet, websites that sell Hochuli merchandise as well as blogs with his namesake exist. He is often affectionately referred to as [...] "Hochules", a portmanteau of his last name and [...] "Hercules", in homage to his large biceps. While he is aware of his celebrity status, Hochuli does not understand it. He said in a USA Today interview, [...] "I get a kick out of the notoriety, because I'm just a referee. I'm not the players. The players are the game. They're what this is all about. I get notoriety because I explain things, and I get notoriety because I have a decent physique, which is funny because I'm a shrimp, a peewee compared to those players. Neither one of those things has anything to do with whether I'm a good referee." [...] His recognition extends to the streets, in airports, and in the courtroom. He has been approached by notable athletes such as former National Basketball Association (NBA) player Charles Barkley at the airport. [...] "It never ceases to amaze me," [...] Hochuli told the Arizona Daily Star. [...] "The number of people that will just come up to me and recognize me." [...] He appreciates the attention, saying, [...] "I enjoy the fact that there are people who like me as a referee. I hear from a lot of people and I enjoy that. <b>Like</b> <b>anybody,</b> I like praise. Probably because of my personality, I thrive on that more than other people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Williams went on {{to claim}} he has [...] "always {{respected}} {{the office of the}} president ... Working-class people are hurting – and it doesn't seem <b>like</b> <b>anybody</b> cares. When both sides are high-fiving it on the ninth hole when everybody else is without a job – it makes a whole lot of us angry. Something has to change. The policies have to change." [...] ESPN later announced they were [...] "extremely disappointed" [...] in Williams' comments, and pulled his opening from that night's broadcast.|$|E
2500|$|VanderWaal again {{performed}} [...] "I Don't Know My Name" [...] for the September 14 finale episode, then {{introduced a}} performance by Stevie Nicks, who compared her style with VanderWaal's and said, [...] "e {{like to be a}} little different... and not <b>like</b> <b>anybody</b> else. She's got it. Whatever happens, Grace is going to the top." [...] At the end of the broadcast, VanderWaal was announced as the season 11 winner. She was the second female winner and second child act winner in the show's history.|$|E

Alas, my bubbles, my bubbles! ...|$|R
6000|$|A slight color {{mounted to}} Rosey's face. [...] "No," [...] she said, hastily, [...] "not that."

[...] "Father," [...] she began, [...] "when mother died, would YOU have <b>liked</b> <b>anybody</b> to take her trunks and paw around her things and wear them?" ...|$|R

2500|$|After {{the release}} of It Matters to Me, Hill took a three-year break from {{recording}} to give herself a rest from four years of touring and to begin a family with McGraw. During her break, she joined forces with her husband for their first duet, [...] "It's Your Love". The song stayed at number one for six weeks, and won awards from both the Academy of Country Music and the Country Music Association. Hill has remarked that sometimes when they perform the song together, [...] "it [...] feel <b>like</b> <b>anybody</b> else was really watching." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stewart's [...] "Rod the Mod" [...] image gained wider {{visibility}} in November 1965, {{when he was}} {{the subject}} of a 30-minute Rediffusion, London television documentary titled [...] "An Easter with Rod" [...] that portrayed the Mod scene. His parallel solo career attempts continued on EMI's Columbia label with the November 1965 release of [...] "The Day Will Come", a more heavily arranged pop attempt, and the April 1966 release of his take on Sam Cooke's [...] "Shake", with the Brian Auger Trinity. Both failed commercially and neither gained positive notices. Stewart had spent the better part of two years listening mostly to Cooke; he later said, [...] "I didn't sound <b>like</b> <b>anybody</b> at all ... but I knew I sounded a bit like Sam Cooke, so I listened to Sam Cooke." [...] This recording solidified that singer's position as Stewart's idol and most enduring influence; he called it a [...] "crossing of the water." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lukács {{restricted}} {{the application of}} the idea to capitalists only, claiming that Marx had considered capitalists as [...] "mere character masks" [...] – meaning that capitalists, as the personifications ("agents") of capital, did not do anything [...] "without making a business out of it", given that their activity consisted of the correct management and calculation of the objective effects of economic laws. Marx himself never simply equated capitalists with their character masks; they were human beings entangled in a certain life predicament, <b>like</b> <b>anybody</b> else. Capitalists became the [...] "personification" [...] of their capital, because they had money which was permanently invested somewhere, and which necessarily had to obtain a certain yield. At most one could say that capitalists had more to hide, and that some had personal qualities enabling them to succeed in their function, while others lacked the personal prerequisites. According to Lukács, the character masks of the bourgeoisie express a [...] "necessary false consciousness" [...] about the class consciousness of the proletariat.|$|E

6000|$|And now he {{had come}} home, driving a tin-wagon. Mattie smiled to think of it. She bore Jed no ill will for his failure. She {{felt sorry for him}} and {{inclined}} to think that fate had used him hardly--fate and Selena together. Mattie had never had another beau. People thought she was engaged to Jed Crane until her time for beaus went by. Mattie did not mind; she had never <b>liked</b> <b>anybody</b> so well as Jed. To be sure, she had not thought of him for years. It was strange he should come back like this--"romantic," [...] as he said himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "At {{any rate}} mamma can't come downstairs, {{and you must}} excuse her. What a very nice woman Mrs. Dobbs Broughton is." [...] Johnny {{acknowledged}} that Mrs. Dobbs Broughton was charming. [...] "And Mr. Broughton is so good-natured!" [...] Johnny again assented. [...] "I like him of all things," [...] said Miss Demolines. [...] "So do I," [...] said Johnny;--"I never <b>liked</b> <b>anybody</b> so much in my life. I suppose one is bound to say that kind of thing." [...] "Oh, you ill-natured man," [...] said Miss Demolines. [...] "I suppose you think that poor Mr. Broughton is a little--just a little,--you know what I mean." ...|$|R
2500|$|Anderson {{soon became}} notorious for causing controversy, {{such as his}} infamous quote that resurfaced in {{interviews}} and articles in the following years, that he was [...] "a bisexual man who never had a homosexual experience". In February 1993, Suede went from highly touted indie band to major chart contenders with their third single, [...] "Animal Nitrate", which went into the UK top ten. The single earned them a last-minute invitation to play at that year's Brit Awards ceremony. Impressed by the band's charged sexuality, Suede's first sequence of singles and first album shocked audiences and critics alike. Suede's sexual lyrics made them a rallying point for the alienated, {{one of the few}} British bands since the Smiths who united as much as they divided. Comparisons were being made with David Bowie, though Suede sounded nothing quite <b>like</b> <b>anybody</b> else around at the time, and soon they fell upon what critics quickly deemed was a new movement. Anderson recalls, [...] "I had always been fascinated by suburbia, and I liked to throw these twisted references to small-town British life into songs. This was before we had that horrible term Britpop." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s Van Vliet {{established}} an {{association with the}} Michael Werner Gallery. Eric Feldman stated later {{in an interview that}} at that time Michael Werner told Van Vliet he needed to stop playing music if he wanted to be respected as a painter, warning him that otherwise he would only be considered a [...] "...musician who paints". In doing so, it was said that he had effectively [...] "succeeded in leaving his past behind". Gordon Veneklasen, one of the gallery's directors in 1995 described Van Vliet as an [...] "incredible painter" [...] whose work [...] "doesn't really look <b>like</b> <b>anybody</b> else's work but his own". Van Vliet {{has been described as a}} modernist, a primitivist, an abstract expressionist, and, [...] "in a sense" [...] an outsider artist. Morgan Falconer of Artforum concurs, mentioning both a [...] "neo-primitivist aesthetic" [...] and further stating that his work is influenced by the CoBrA painters. The resemblance to the CoBrA painters is also recognized by art critic Roberto Ohrt, while others have compared his paintings to the work of Jackson Pollock, Franz Kline, Antonin Artaud, Francis Bacon, Vincent van Gogh and Mark Rothko.|$|E
2500|$|Feeling {{that the}} songs {{played on the}} radio at that time were [...] "homogenized", Madonna pursued the musical {{direction}} of MDNA {{with the idea that}} it should not sound <b>like</b> <b>anybody</b> else's music. The music composed could be divided into two categories. She described the songs crafted with Orbit as [...] "introspective" [...] while the work with Solveig as [...] "more ironic and funny and upbeat. There's a really up aspect to it and a really fun aspect to it". A pop and EDM record, MDNA opens with the track [...] "Girl Gone Wild", which contains influences of four on the floor and a similar sound to songs from Madonna's tenth studio album, Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005). Its introduction included elements of [...] "Act of Contrition" [...] from Like a Prayer (1989), with the chorus talking about [...] "a girl gone wild" [...] with [...] "burning desire". The next song, [...] "Gang Bang", is an electronic dance song, with a dubstep breakdown and industrial beats. The sinister lyrics talk about a woman who takes revenge on her lover, shooting him in his head.|$|E
6000|$|And afterwards, from Spider, and Pat, and Clam, and Johnny Heinhold, and others, {{came the}} tips that Old Scratch liked me and {{had nothing but}} good words for the fine lad I was. Which was the more remarkable, because {{he was known as}} a savage, cantankerous old cuss who never <b>liked</b> <b>anybody.</b> (His very nickname, [...] "Scratch," [...] arose from a Berserker trick of his, in fighting, of tearing off his opponent's face.) And that I had won his friendship, all thanks were due to John Barleycorn. I have given the {{incident}} merely {{as an example of the}} multitudinous lures and draws and services by which John Barleycorn wins his followers.|$|R

2500|$|At 19:20, Cameron and Ouimet made an {{extremely}} difficult emergency landing at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, located in Boone County, Kentucky, across the Ohio River from Cincinnati, Ohio. During the evacuation, the overwing aircraft doors were opened, causing {{an influx of}} air that fuelled the fire. Ouimet escaped through the co-pilot's emergency window shortly after the plane landed, but Cameron, who had expended {{a great deal of}} physical energy while trying to keep the plane under control, was unable to move due to exhaustion. Firefighters doused Cameron in firefighting foam through Ouimet's window, shocking him back to consciousness; Cameron was then able to open the pilot's emergency escape window and drop to the ground, where he was dragged to safety by Ouimet. Cameron was the last person to make it out of the plane alive. Less than 90 seconds after touchdown, the interior of the plane flashed over and ignited, killing 23 of the 41 passengers. The passengers trapped inside the plane died from smoke inhalation and burns from the flash fire. Dianne Fadley, a survivor, said that [...] "it was almost <b>like</b> <b>anybody</b> who got out had nothing wrong"; of the eighteen surviving passengers, three received serious injuries, thirteen received minor injuries, and two were uninjured, while none of the five crew members sustained any injuries. [...] "You made it and you were completely fine," [...] Fadley concluded, [...] "or you didn't make it." ...|$|E

She kept him boiling for three or four days, but she did not eat him because her teeth were just <b>like</b> <b>anybody's</b> teeth--no weaker, perhaps, but {{certainly}} no stronger nor sharper. So she fed him to a threshing machine of her acquaintance, which managed to masticate some of the more modern portions, but was hopelessly wrecked upon the neck. From that time the poor beldame had lived under the ban of a great curse. Hens took after her as naturally as after the soaring beetle; geese pursued {{her as if she were}} a fleeting tadpole; ducks, turkeys, and guinea fowl camped upon her trail with tireless pertinacity.|$|R
