It failed to sell, and Charles Morice was unable to raise public money to acquire it for the nation. Gauguin had thought his only likely interested patron would be Gustave Fayet, who did eventually buy it for 1,500 francs, but in 1905, after Gauguin's death.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the squad that performed so well {{in the second half}} of the club's 2008–09 campaign were retained, with very little transfer activity in comparison to previous seasons under Westley. Steve Morison, the club's top goalscorer for the past three seasons, moved to Millwall for a fee of £130,000, while both John Martin and Calum Willock were released by Westley in late May 2009. Midfielder Gary Mills was the <b>last</b> <b>departure</b> of the close season; rejecting a contract and instead opting to join fellow Conference Premier rivals Mansfield Town. Five players joined the club during the close season. Charlie Griffin was the first signing of the season, joining Stevenage from Salisbury City on a free transfer. Yemi Odubade, Chris Beardsley, and Joel Byrom signed for the club shortly after; the latter commanding a transfer fee of £15,000. Westley had previously managed Beardsley at Rushden & Diamonds and Kettering Town. The last signing of pre-season was Stacy Long; who joined the club on a free transfer from Ebbsfleet United. No players departed the club during the season, with Tim Sills the only addition – signing for an undisclosed fee from Torquay United in January 2010.|$|E

It has several important stops, such as Madeleine, the 6th arrondissement of Paris, Porte de Versailles and two national railway stations, Gare Montparnasse and Gare Saint-Lazare. The service runs {{every day of the}} week, starting at 05:30; the <b>last</b> <b>departure</b> is at 00:39, or on Fridays and Saturdays, one hour later. The line uses MF 67 series trains, the network's standard since the early 1970s; they make a complete journey in 36 minutes.|$|E
25|$|When the NHL lockout {{ended in}} 2005, many players were lost to NHL teams {{and to other}} teams in Europe: Campbell, Väänänen, Selänne, Metropolit, Pasi Häkkinen, Valtteri Filppula and Tomi Mäki. The <b>last</b> <b>departure</b> {{occurred}} just one day before regular season play started, when goaltender Tim Thomas signed with the Boston Bruins. Jokerit tried to replace the loss of Thomas with goalkeeper Karl Goehring but Goehring was released soon and replaced by ex-NHL'er Steve Passmore. Passmore was paired mid-season with HIFK's Tom Askey {{but none of the}} three was able to fill the empty spot of Tim Thomas. Jokerit also had players like Eric Beaudoin and Justin Mapletoft but neither of them made a positive impact during the season. The spree of departures, combined with rookie coach Waltteri Immonen's coaching debut, led Jokerit to an abysmal early season, with a win-loss-tie record of 5–11–4 after 20 games. Immonen, a long-time Jokerit player but a rookie head coach, was moved from the job in November and Curt Lindström was hired to salvage the team. Mr. Lindström could not change the course of the team {{and for the first time}} in 16 years, Jokerit did not qualify for the playoffs.|$|E
500|$|Admission to the gardens, {{which were}} open until 9pm during the summer, was by {{subscription}} ticket priced at 10shillings {{for a family}} and 5shillings for an individual, beyond the means of most workers. Concerts of [...] "genteel music" [...] were staged, and there was dancing to various bands on a large open-air wooden platform. Initially, the only public transport to Belle Vue was by horse-drawn omnibus from what is now Piccadilly, in central Manchester, but the <b>last</b> <b>departure</b> time of 6:00pm coincided {{with the end of}} most workers' shifts. The first railway station was opened near Belle Vue in 1842, allowing workers easier access to the gardens and their attractions, and by 1848 complaints began to appear in the press that [...] "roughs" [...] in coarse attire were embarrassing middle-class ladies on the dancing platform by attempting to dance with them. There were also complaints about working-class men dancing together, and increasing resentment from working-class patrons about Belle Vue's [...] "forbidding dress requirements, its restricted opening hours, [...] its unwelcoming admission price". In the words of historian David Mayer, Jennison was facing a crisis: [...] "either keep Belle Vue Gardens an exclusive, class-specific, genteel preserve for the gentry and the middle class– who would arrive and depart in their own carriages through the Hyde Road gate– or open the gardens to a popular crowd who would arrive by train at the Stockport Road (Longsight) gate". For a time, Jennison sent carriages to the railway station to collect the first-class passengers, but he also abandoned the idea of subscription tickets, settling instead on a general admission price of 4d, rising to 6d in 1851.|$|E

No longer, fond {{of the sun and}} breeze as a beautiful bird, was Venetia seen, as heretofore, glancing in the garden, or bounding over the lawns; too often might she be found reclining on the couch, {{in spite of all the}} temptations of the spring; while her temper, once so singularly sweet that it seemed there was not in the world a word that could ruffle it, and which required so keenly and responded so quickly to sympathy, became reserved, if not absolutely sullen, or at times even captious and fretful.|$|E
