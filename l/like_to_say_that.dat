25|$|Her {{secret is}} in her ability to {{transfer}} to the musical plane {{the suffering of the}} character she plays, the nostalgic longing for lost happiness, the anxious fluctuation between hope and despair, between pride and supplication, between irony and generosity, which in the end dissolve into a superhuman inner pain. The most diverse and opposite of sentiments, cruel deceptions, ambitious desires, burning tenderness, grievous sacrifices, all the torments of the heart, acquire in her singing that mysterious truth, I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>that</b> psychological sonority, which is the primary attraction of opera.|$|E
25|$|Though Brazilians of {{at least}} partial African {{heritage}} make up {{a large percentage of}} the population, few blacks have been elected as politicians. The city of Salvador, Bahia, for instance, is 80% people of color, but voters have not elected a mayor of color. Journalists <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> US cities with black majorities, such as Detroit and New Orleans, have not elected white mayors since after the civil rights movement, when the Voting Rights Act of 1965 protected the franchise for minorities, and blacks in the South regained the power to vote for the first time since the turn of the 20th century. New Orleans elected its first black mayor in the 1970s. New Orleans elected a white mayor after the widescale disruption and damage of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.|$|E
500|$|As Jim recaps the Dundies for the camera, Pam {{stares at}} Jim with dazed fascination and then falls off her stool, and Dwight springs to her rescue, {{thinking}} Pam {{is having a}} seizure. [...] He then tries {{to take off his}} dress shirt and tie, but a Chili's employee stops him. [...] After the party is over, Pam runs to the camera and screams [...] "I would just <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> this was the best Dundies ever! Whoo!". In the parking lot, Pam admits to Jim that it was she who wrote the graffiti. She begins to ask Jim a question, but stops when she notices the camera. A Chili's employee then talks to the camera and says that Pam apparently was sneaking drinks off of others' tables, which is against the restaurant's rules. [...] He then tells the audience that he Xeroxed her driver's license and she is never welcome at Chili's again. Jim helps Pam into Angela Martin's (Angela Kinsey) car and smiles as they leave.|$|E

50|$|Another of his {{personality}} traits is tenacity. Even though he can at times be lazy, and <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> his favorite place to be is in a hammock, once he has committed to accomplishing something he goes for it 100 percent, sometimes resorting to extreme measures to reach his goal.|$|R
500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. De Ferran stated that: [...] "I think first of all, I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> we're still running under {{a little bit of}} a cloud with all of the things that happened in the U.S. last week and what happened to (Alex) Zanardi is still in all of our minds." [...] He said that he was [...] "glad" [...] to have taken part in the race and that the victory was special for him because his wife is from England. De Ferran earned US$100,000 (£68,600) for the victory. Bräck said that he had no complaint over the last-lap loss and that it was a [...] "tough" [...] and [...] "exciting" [...] race. He said the remaining four races of the season were [...] "crucial" [...] and that the [...] "very close" [...] battle for the championship was not over. He stated that he was looking forward to those events and hoped they would play into his favour. Castroneves congratulated de Ferran on securing the victory,saying that it was [...] "a quick and busy day" [...] for the people who were involved in the event. He was glad that the race was able to be held, and hoped to achieve a good result at the next race of the season.|$|E
500|$|Quantico was {{designed}} with over a half-dozen core characters, {{in addition to}} Alex Parrish, for pacing reasons. It was intended to have a flashback narrative, shifting between [...] "the present day with Parrish navigating her way through a class of FBI New Agent Trainees to the near future as the truth and repercussions of the attack emerge". Safran also used flashforwards to spread out the series' plot points. He said in a 2015 interview that although the series is [...] "intricately plotted", it {{does not intend to}} overwhelm the viewer, saying: [...] "It is tightly structured and moves quickly between two, sometimes three, time periods, but we made sure that it's not so complicated that it just feels like too much. I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{we have a lot of}} tributaries, but they all lead to one ocean". The series' diverse cast has helped its writers create a variety of storylines and plot points. According to a Variety article on Safran and Quantico, [...] "The show delves below the surface into those disparate backgrounds to explore how each character’s personal stories influence their motivations for joining the FBI and in their perspective on the search for truth in the terrorism investigation. That offers a wealth of engaging material for writers to mine". Safran modeled Quantico on Buffy the Vampire Slayer in structure, with self-contained story arcs from season to season. Its producers said that each season would have a specific storyline, with Alex the series' focal point surrounded by a new cast.|$|E
2500|$|With protesters {{gathering}} daily {{outside her}} Lima apartment building, lighting candles and demanding that she either be deported from Peru, or reimprisoned, Berenson {{sent a letter}} to President Alan Garcia admitting her [...] "criminal responsibility for terrorist collaboration" [...] and further writing [...] "I would also <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I very much regret the harm I have caused Peruvian society, and I ask forgiveness from people who have been affected by my actions or words."

60|$|Clorinda {{stopped short}} suddenly. She had just remembered {{that she would}} not have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> last {{sentence}} <b>to</b> Aunt Emmy. Therefore, there was something wrong about it. Clorinda had long ago learned that there was sure to be something wrong in anything that could not be said to Aunt Emmy.

2500|$|André St-Pierre is the {{director}} of the episodes. He is best known as the co-director of the Télé-Québec show Les Francs-Tireurs and La Job was his first fiction. Script adaptation was given to Ian Lauzon and Jean-Philippe Granger was made screenwriter. Like the American Office, improv veterans were called to fill the shoes of some of the original actors. The role of the David Brent boss was entrusted to Antoine Vézina, a performer of the reputed Ligue nationale d'improvisation (LNI), a Quebec-born concept of improvisational theatre and international improv team competition (Quebec, France, Belgium, Switzerland and Italy). Sophie Cadieux, who holds the role corresponding to Dawn Tinsley, has also taken part in the LNI. Paul Ahmarani, playing La Jobs Gareth Keenan, is a great fan of the British series. About the black humor of the show, he comments: [...] "Personally, when I began watching that show, after five minutes, I knew that I had before my eyes something unique, that would literally shatter all that we had seen before". On his character, he sums up that [...] "I'm someone that is very much of a coward, so I like to take refuge in military fantasies of virility... I really <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I spent three years in the army... I'm a bit of a loser, very right-wing, very militarist".
