500|$|Reviewing {{the first}} Steve Jackson Games editions of Ogre (after the {{designer}} had {{moved away from}} Metagaming), Tony Watson called Ogre [...] "a legend {{in the ranks of}} SF gamedom, and deservedly so... as well as being a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> play, it's an interesting extrapolation on high-tech armoured warfare". It was noted that the rules had remained essentially the same in the new edition, and the most significant changes being to the physical design—with larger (still black and white) counters, and full colour maps by Denis Loubet. [...] Watson also welcomed the retention of the original artwork alongside new pieces—"no one draws a GEV or Ogre like Mr. Chung".|$|E

He's <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> {{play because}} he has a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> character traits that your average New Zealander doesn't, which leads to a few people thinking he's a bit suspicious.

500|$|Chris Colgan, {{writing for}} PopMatters, found the album {{to have the}} longest and most {{intricate}} solos yet, and he, too, mentioned the increased trading off between Antti's and Sneck's solos. He thought it important that Kalmah had [...] "not fallen prey to the tendency of introducing American metal elements or becoming more mainstream with their sound. Their music now is as unique {{as it was in}} their early years, if not more so". Marko Säynekoski of Soundi described the performances as [...] "controlled", [...] "burly", and [...] "performed effortlessly". Stalker's Kathleen Gransalke admitted that she was unfamiliar with Kalmah's previous work, but she was nevertheless impressed with its technicality, double-guitar melodies, fast solos, and the combining of genres. She called the album [...] "a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> listen to".|$|E
500|$|SFX Magazine Jordan Farley {{gave the}} episode 3 {{and a half}} out of 5 stars, saying the {{direction}} [...] "never quite [...] the right balance between absurdist humour and sinister nightmare" [...] and the camera was [...] "a little flat" [...] with a strange angle. He was displeased with the discovery that {{it had all been}} a hallucination and stated that Rory's death and other instances of horror [...] "never shock in the way you might expect". However, he praised Smith for being [...] "on blindingly good form" [...] while portraying the Doctor's quirkier traits, considered that Gillan and Darvill were [...] "fast becoming the most likeable companion couple in Doctor Who history", and said Jones was [...] "a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> watch" [...] despite not seeming to be completely the Doctor's dark side.|$|E

You'll be doing the same before you're here a week. If you don't, we'll all be surprised mightily. And if you don't, most likely you'll hurt Dick's feelings. He's come to expect it as a matter of course. And when a fond, proud husband gets a habit like that, it must hurt terribly to see his wife not appreciated." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Kim Manners, who was extremely pleased with the final result. He explained, [...] "it was a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> shoot that show. It was the first show that the Gunmen carried and I had a real good time shepherding Tommy, Dean, and Bruce, 'cause [...] they were nervous, they had the whole hour to carry." [...] One scene with which Manners was extremely pleased was the shot wherein Susanne Modeski breaks into the Lone Gunmen's hotel room and the Gunmen cower in fear in a corner. Manners {{was inspired by the}} 1939 film adaption of The Wizard of Oz, most specifically the image of [...] " [...] the Scarecrow, and the Tinman, and the Lion [...] shaking behind Dorothy." [...] Manners later noted that the sequence [...] "really worked out well".|$|E
500|$|Of her {{gameplay}} mechanics, Inquisitr {{expressed the}} opinion that her [...] "quick and evasive ways make her an annoyance to deal with".

Mike Minotti of VentureBeat opined that: [...] "Tracer [...] a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> play. Her whole teleporting/rewinding mechanics [...] so unique and fast-paced.

During the production of Thirty Seconds to Mars first studio album, he played almost exclusively electronic drums and drew influence from bands such as Pink Floyd, The Cure, Led Zeppelin, and The Who, which he considers [...] "mostly big conceptional bands; bands that had depth; bands that were dynamic." [...] Bob Ezrin, producer of the album, felt that Leto is [...] "one of the most inventive drummers I've worked with. He isn't satisfied with simply adding a beat; his drum parts {{are an integral part of}} the orchestration of the record.

500|$|American {{pop singer}} Britney Spears guest {{starred in the}} episode as herself. According to Scully, she was {{seventeen}} to eighteen {{years old when she}} recorded her lines, and [...] "She was a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> work with. She was a fan of the show, and she was willing to do all the lines. It was all the people around her that were crazy, the management and all that.

And suddenly, all these guys come rushing in [...] 'She can't say songbird.' [...] what's wrong with songbird? And they were somehow convinced that it was some sort of slam or an insult." [...] The staff members were therefore forced to change her opening line to [...] "I'm teen sensation Britney Spears." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite the praise, some reviewers {{criticized the}} game for its {{confusing}} level layouts and felt they have not held up very well over the years. Christian Donlan of Eurogamer stated that Perfect Dark is [...] "not afraid to throw dead ends at you seemingly {{for the hell of}} it, or repeat textures so much in its huge maps that you can get a little dizzy." [...] GameSpot's Tom Mc Shea noted that the campaign was [...] "oddly paced", and that [...] "locked doors, unused rooms, and dead ends... can be disheartening to stumble around in a circle until you finally happen upon the correct door you just couldn't locate."

5000|$|... "Jungle" [...] {{is a song}} {{written by}} Jeff Lynne which first {{appeared}} as an album track from the 1977 album Out of the Blue. According to the band members' opinions, recording Jungle was a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> owing <b>to</b> {{the various types of}} sound effects, the upbeat tune, and the jungle animal noises provided by Lynne, Bev Bevan, and Kelly Groucutt. Like most songs from the LP, the song starts with a fade in sequence by Tandy then continues in a different tune.|$|R

[...] According to the review by Rob Steele of The Games Machine, the Atari ST version was entertaining and very enjoyable, even if [...] "wholeheartedly sexist". Jason Simmons from Amiga Action opined that the 1991 remake's [...] "advanced graphics and new control system have improved the game by a huge degree", but [...] "without a hard drive it is slow and almost a chore to play" [...] and those who played the original [...] "will probably find the new edition {{a waste of time}} and little more than an exercise in pretty pictures."

500|$|... "The Convict" [...] was {{the first}} Office episode to be {{directed}} by Jeffrey Blitz, who later won an Emmy Award for the fifth season episode [...] "Stress Relief".

Actress Kate Flannery found the episode [...] "a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> shoot," [...] and observed that on the occasions Gervais was present, [...] "it {{seems to me like}} he is looking at all of us with a sense of, 'I can't believe that this exists because of me.' That is just my interpretation, but he seems so humble, and kind of reverent." [...] One scene was meant to take place outdoors under cold temperatures, so the parking lot set was laden with fake snow and slush. Also present on set were two sets of twin babies, as the character of Hannah Smotridge-Barr brings her son to the office.|$|E
500|$|Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave The Flash episode a score 7.5 out of 10.

He felt the [...] crossover [...] "had a fairly rocky start" [...] and wondered whether Arrows characters were actually necessary to the storyline. Even so, Scheden said, [...] "there was a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> be had in seeing both teams cross paths and grapple with an increasingly strange world of heroes and villains" [...] and {{was looking forward to}} a focused conclusion. The A.V. Clubs Scott Von Doviak awarded the episode an [...] "A", saying: [...] ""Legends Of Today” is a sterling example of how to do this crossover thing right." [...] He noted that the episode wove ongoing storylines [...] "into an expansive DC Universe adventure" [...] calling it [...] "the most purely enjoyable outing of the season so far".|$|E
