5|$|As he {{nears the}} cabin, the {{imaginary}} Barry appears and tells Alan {{that he will}} have to reject all the illusions before he can face off against the insane version of Alan, including the apparition of Barry. Alan is ready to accept that, forcing Alan to fight Taken illusions of Dr. Hartman, Barry, and the Andersons, defeating them all before he is able to reenter the cabin. His crazed side is in a paranoid state on the cabin floor, and when Alan touches him, the two are made whole again. Alan realizes that he cannot <b>let</b> <b>himself</b> fall into a delusional state again for fear of never being able to escape, and returns to the typewriter to start a new story—"Return".|$|E
5|$|By April 1945, the Allied advance into Germany {{threatened}} Hinton's POW camp. The Germans evacuated {{the camp}} but Hinton, feigning sickness, remained behind. Once the guards had left, {{he was able}} to find keys to the gates and <b>let</b> <b>himself</b> out. He soon made contact with soldiers of the United States 6th Armoured Division. Dressed in civilian clothes, he was initially treated with suspicion but soon convinced the Americans of his identity. He borrowed an American uniform and went forward to the frontline with the 44th Infantry Division and assisted in the capture of three villages and rounding up of German POWs. Senior American officers soon found out about Hinton's presence with their troops and sent him to England, where he arrived on 12 April 1945.|$|E
5|$|After scoring 43 in {{the first}} innings, the second Test in Lahore came down to a run-chase for Australia, with Harvey and Norm O'Neill {{seemingly}} on schedule to win before time ran out. However, the Pakistani fielders began to waste time {{in an attempt to}} foil an Australian victory. They swapped the cover and midwicket fielders very slowly whenever the left and rightt-handed combination of Harvey and O'Neill took a single and changed the batsman on strike. To counter this, Harvey deliberately backed away from a straight ball and <b>let</b> <b>himself</b> be bowled, throwing his wicket away for 37. This allowed Benaud to come in and bat with O'Neill so that the two rightt-handed batsmen would give the Pakistanis no opportunity to waste time by switching the field. Australia won the match with minutes to spare. Harvey scored 54 and 13 not out in the drawn third Test at Karachi. Australia took the series 2–0, but would not win another Test in Pakistan until 1998. Harvey ended the series with 273 runs at 54.60.|$|E

25|$|After {{his return}} to Brazil, Fernando Henrique engaged with the burgeoning {{democratic}} opposition to the régime both as an intellectual and as a political activist. He became Senator from São Paulo for the former Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB) in 1982, substituting as a suplent the newly-elected governort of São Paulo, Franco Montoro. In 1985, he ran unsuccessfully for mayor of São Paulo against former President Jânio Quadros. Ahead in the polls, he <b>let</b> <b>himself</b> be photographed in the mayor's chair before the elections. Some attribute his loss to this episode.|$|E

As soon as he had recovered from his wounds, he <b>let</b> <b>himself</b> be baptised. He then stopped raiding Christian cities, and lived in England and Ireland. In 995, he used an opportunity to return to Norway. When he arrived, the Haakon Jarl was facing a revolt. Olaf Tryggvason persuaded the rebels to accept him as their king, and Jarl Haakon was murdered by his own slave, while he was hiding from the rebels in a pig sty.|$|E

25|$|Even {{as a young}} boy, Ryelandt had a mind of his own. Much as he revered his “best piano teacher,” Franz Devos (of the Ghent Conservatory) {{who gave}} him private lessons, he wrote that Devos “did not pay enough {{attention}} to technique, which left me unsatisfied.” While he {{learned a lot from}} Tinel, whose technical mastery he greatly admired, he also <b>let</b> <b>himself</b> be influenced by Wagner, whom Tinel detested, and by French composers such as Franck, Fauré and Debussy, whereas Tinel was primarily German-oriented. But Ryelandt never belonged to any school or fashion; in fact, he despised fashion.|$|E
25|$|Manfred Gnädinger (Boehringen, Germany 1936 – Camelle, Spain, 28 December 2002) a.k.a. Man or O Alemán was a German hermit and {{sculptor}} {{who lived}} in the village of Camelle, on the Costa da Morte, in Galicia (Spain). He lived a very simple and natural life, building sculptures on the beach where he lived and tending to his small garden. In November 2002, when the oil spill of the Prestige destroyed his sculptures and the ecosystem of the area he lived in, it is thought that Man <b>let</b> <b>himself</b> die of melancholy and sadness, thus becoming a symbol of the destruction unleashed by the oil spill.|$|E
25|$|In the Swiss Cup final that season, Basel's opponents were Lausanne-Sports. In {{the former}} Wankdorf Stadium on 15 May 1967, Helmut Hauser scored the decisive goal via a penalty. The game {{went down in}} {{football}} history due to the sit-down strike that followed this goal. After 88 minutes of play, with the score at 1–1, referee Karl Göppel awarded Basel a controversial penalty: André Grobéty had pushed Hauser gently {{in the back and}} he <b>let</b> <b>himself</b> drop theatrically. Subsequent to Basel taking the lead, Lausanne players refused to resume the game, sitting down demonstratively on the pitch. The referee was forced to abandon the match and Basel were awarded the cup with a 3–0 default victory.|$|E

25|$|Because of his {{position}} as {{the heir to the}} throne after his elder brother Gustav, he was early targeted as a useful tool for the opposition to his brother: already in the 1760s, the Caps (party) tried to use him against his brother the crown prince through his then love interest countess Brita Horn, daughter of the Cap's politician Adam Horn. This was in the critical period following the December Crisis (1768). Gustav, however, was always careful to prevent Charles from being used by the opposition, which came to its first test during the 1768 crisis, when Charles, ultimately, did not <b>let</b> <b>himself</b> be used by the Caps party. In 1770, he made a journey through Germany and France alone.|$|E
25|$|In 995 Olaf Tryggvason became King Olaf I of Norway. Olaf had raided various European {{cities and}} fought in several wars. In 986 however, he (supposedly) met a Christian seer on the Isles of Scilly. As the seer foretold, Olaf was {{attacked}} {{by a group of}} mutineers upon returning to his ships. As soon as he had recovered from his wounds, he <b>let</b> <b>himself</b> be baptized. He then stopped raiding Christian cities and lived in England and Ireland. In 995 he used an opportunity to return to Norway. When he arrived, Haakon Jarl was already facing a revolt, and Olaf Tryggvason could convince the rebels to accept him as their king. Haakon Jarl was later betrayed and killed by his own slave, while he was hiding from the rebels in a pig sty.|$|E
25|$|The {{motivation}} for this violent rejection {{of his earlier}} self {{is the subject of}} considerable speculation. From the time of his arrival in Paris, Modigliani consciously crafted a charade persona for himself and cultivated his reputation as a hopeless drunk and voracious drug user. His escalating intake of drugs and alcohol may have been a means by which Modigliani masked his tuberculosis from his acquaintances, few of whom knew of his condition. Tuberculosis—the leading cause of death in France by 1900—was highly communicable, there was no cure, and those who had it were feared, ostracized, and pitied. Modigliani thrived on camaraderie and would not <b>let</b> <b>himself</b> be isolated as an invalid; he used drink and drugs as palliatives to ease his physical pain, helping him to maintain a façade of vitality and allowing him to continue to create his art.|$|E

25|$|The Childermass, after a {{traditional}} {{name for the}} Feast of the Holy Innocents, is the opening novel of Wyndham Lewis's trilogy The Human Age. In the novel The Fall (La Chute) by Albert Camus, the incident is argued by the main character to be the reason why Jesus chose to <b>let</b> <b>himself</b> be crucified—as he escaped the punishment intended for him while many others died, he felt responsible and died in guilt. A similar interpretation is given in José Saramago's controversial The Gospel According to Jesus Christ, but there attributed to Joseph, Jesus' stepfather, rather than to Jesus himself. As depicted by Saramago, Joseph knew of Herod's intention to massacre the children of Bethlehem, but failed to warn the townspeople and chose only to save his own child. Guilt-ridden ever after, Joseph finally expiates his sin by letting himself be crucified (an event not narrated in the New Testament).|$|E
25|$|New Zealand {{got plenty}} of {{practice}} in their last ODI of the group stage, but were found lacking after resting their best bowlers, Shane Bond and Daniel Vettori. Nehra and Pathan, India's opening bowlers, were taken for runs early on as they sought for wickets but the openers Fleming and Astle escaped, adding 44 in the first 10 overs before Fleming <b>let</b> <b>himself</b> loose {{with a couple of}} aerial shots on the off side to take ten off an over from Pathan. Agarkar, who had come on for Nehra earlier, then had Astle caught behind for 11, but Vincent and Fleming continued to punish the bowling, {{and by the end of}} 15 overs they were 81 for 1 – Nehra having conceded 35 in five overs. However, once again Agarkar was responsible for a breakthrough, running out Fleming with a good throw after having picked up the ball in his follow-through.|$|E
25|$|Thus when Sverre came to Norway {{he found}} the {{prospects}} for a successful uprising to be small. Distraught, he travelled east and came to Östergötland in Sweden just before Christmas. There he met with the local ruler, Birger Brosa, who was married to Sigurd Munn’s sister, Brigit Haraldsdotter. Sverre revealed to Birger Brosa his claim to the throne, but Birger was at first unwilling to give any aid. He was already supporting another group, the Birkebeiners — the Birchlegs. This group had risen in 1174 under the leadership of Øystein Møyla who claimed to be the son of King Øystein Haraldsson. They had received the name Birkebeiners because their poverty led some of them to wind the bark of the birch about their legs, instead of wearing shoes. But in January 1177, the Birkebeiners met a crushing defeat at the Battle of Re and Øystein fell. Sverre met with the remnants in Värmland. After some initial doubts, Sverre <b>let</b> <b>himself</b> be persuaded to become the Birkebeiners’ next leader.|$|E

25|$|Mounted on his horse, Luna then charged {{into the}} {{battlefield}} leading his main force in a counterattack. As they advanced, the American forces began firing upon them. Amidst the fire, Luna's horse was hit {{and he fell}} to the ground. As he recovered, Luna {{realized that he had}} been shot in the stomach. Seeing the Americans coming towards him and deciding that he must not <b>let</b> <b>himself</b> be captured, he attempted to kill himself with his revolver. He was saved, though, by the actions of a Filipino colonel named Alejandro Avecilla who, having seen Luna fall, rode towards the general to save him. Despite being heavily wounded in one of his legs and an arm, with his remaining strength Avecilla carried Luna away from battle to the Filipino rear. Upon reaching safety, Luna realized that his wound was not very deep as most of the impact of the bullet had been taken by a silk belt full of gold coins that his parents had given him, which he had been wearing. As he left the field to have his wounds tended, Luna turned over the command to General Venacio Concepción, the Filipino commander of the nearby town of Angeles.|$|E
