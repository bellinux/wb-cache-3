5|$|For {{the first}} six episodes, the show had five corners, or parts, which started with opening {{greetings}} from the hosts {{and went on to}} thoughts and impressions that <b>listeners</b> had about the show. This moved on to an informal talk between the hosts, followed by a section where entries previously submitted by <b>listeners</b> concerning their enthusiasm for Key were read by the hosts. The fourth corner concerned answering questions that had been submitted by <b>listeners,</b> and the final corner had Orito playing the flute; <b>listeners</b> could submit suggestions for songs he was to play. Two more corners were added starting with the seventh broadcast. The first corner added concerns scary stories that the hosts can tell themselves, or read from submissions by <b>listeners,</b> and was added partly because Hinoue enjoys such stories. The second corner added deals with submissions by <b>listeners</b> describing a new fictional character, and Hinoue takes these submissions and forms a new fictional character out of combining elements from multiple submissions together. During the broadcasts, tracks from the soundtracks released under Key Sounds Label play in the background.|$|E

Fifty-two per cent of the <b>listeners</b> thought Ruth should go to Sam. The Archers website had received 1.2 million page impressions due to the storyline in 2006. In February 2007, {{a writer for the}} Daily Record reported almost 200,000 <b>listeners</b> had deserted The Archers due to controversial storylines, such as Ruth and Sam's affair. The writer said figures for the last three months of 2006, when the Ruth and Sam storyline peaked, revealed 4.44 million <b>listeners</b> tuned in, which was down 169,000 on the previous quarter.

40|$|I {{tested the}} effects of the <b>listener</b> {{emersion}} protocol on rate of learning across academic instruction and the emergence of Naming. In two experiments, using a delayed multiple probe design, I first tested {{the effects of}} the <b>listener</b> protocol and then tested for the emergence of the <b>listener</b> and speaker components for Naming. In Experiment I, the participants were three preschoolers with developmental delays who had a limited repertoire of <b>listener</b> skills and had difficulty meeting their instructional objectives. None of them emitted a selection or <b>listener</b> response following mastery of match-to-sample responses for visual stimuli while hearing the word for the stimuli they matched during the <b>listener</b> half of Naming probes. Prior to the onset of the <b>listener</b> emersion training, participants' academic curricula were suspended and they were immersed in learning instructional sets of <b>listener</b> responses. The instructional procedure required the participants to respond only to the auditory properties (speech sound combination) of speech presented to them face-to-face, as well as to voices recorded on tape. This was done until the participants acquired both accuracy and rate of responding criteria for all the sets of the <b>listener</b> emersion protocol. Results from this experiment showed that mastery of the <b>listener</b> emersion protocol accelerated participants' rate of learning (decreased their learn units-to-criteria) to meet instructional objectives. The <b>listener</b> half of Naming emerged for two out of the three participants. In Experiment II, the <b>listener</b> emersion protocol was used to test for the emergence of the speaker and the <b>listener</b> component of Naming for four preschoolers who had more vocal verbal behavior and faster rates of learning than the first group of participants. An additional novel set (two- dimensional stimuli) was used to test for the emergence of Naming. Results from Experiment II showed that the <b>listener</b> emersion protocol was effective in increasing the rate of learning for all participants. In addition, the <b>listener</b> and speaker halves of Naming emerged for two of the four participants...|$|R

Another way to look at relational autoclitics is that they describe the relation between verbal operants, and modify the <b>listener's</b> behavior in that way. For example, in the statement [...] "the book is black" [...] the is tells the <b>listener</b> there is a relation between book and black, is specifies what is black.|$|R
