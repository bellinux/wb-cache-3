50|$|The {{other common}} lever/grip size {{is used for}} {{mountain}} and city handlebars, including flat bars, riser bars, some porteur bars, etc. On these bars the <b>lever</b> and <b>grip</b> areas have a 22.2 mm diameter. Hence, thumb shift <b>levers,</b> <b>grip</b> type shifters, MTB brake levers and Rapidfire type shifters will only fit on this smaller diameter - none could fit on a road or cyclocross bar.|$|R
25|$|A list of {{approved}} {{manufacturers and}} retailers offering antimicrobial copper {{products to the}} regulated U.S. market is also available. These firms have completed all legal requirements to sell antimicrobial copper products {{in accordance with the}} U.S. E.P.A registrations. Products offered by the approved companies include sinks, computer keyboards, faucets, IV poles, tables, stretcher rails, railings, hampers, decorative and architectural hardware (<b>levers,</b> <b>grips,</b> knobs, pulls, towel bars, grab bars, kick plates, bath accessories, outlet covers, light switch covers), laboratory incubators, cabinet hardware, decorative tile, and free weights.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to the stem clamp area, the shifter and/or brake <b>lever</b> and <b>grip</b> area on a bar can have several different diameters. For traditional road and mountain handlebars, these diameters are standard and so there has historically been little confusion except when mixing road and mountain components. However, in recent years there have been cross-over bar types that do not fall into one category or the other, and which can conceivably use either type of shifter, brake <b>lever</b> or <b>grip</b> (an example is the upright style bar). For this reason, certain handlebars are now available in multiple sizes related to the shifter or brake lever clamp diameter.|$|R
25|$|The {{driver of}} a cable car {{is known as}} the gripman or grip operator. This is a highly skilled job, {{requiring}} the gripman to smoothly operate the <b>grip</b> <b>lever</b> to <b>grip</b> and release the cable, release the grip at certain points to coast the vehicle over crossing cables or places where the cable does not follow the tracks, and to anticipate well in advance possible collisions with other traffic that may not understand the limitations of a cable car. Being a gripman requires great upper body strength needed for the grip and brakes, as well as good hand–eye coordination and balance.|$|R

5000|$|The Panasonic Lumix G X Vario PZ 14-42mm is a {{zoom lens}} in the Micro Four Thirds system. It is a [...] "standard zoom"- ranging from {{moderately}} wide to moderately tele. An unusual feature {{is that the}} lens collapses to pancake size. To do so, focus-by-wire and power zoom are manually controlled by two thumb <b>levers,</b> not <b>grip</b> rings. There is no hardware switch for O.I.S, instead being controlled via the camera body. Panasonic's [...] "HD" [...] branding indicates focus and zoom motors are quiet, for videography. The optics contain Panasonic's [...] "nano surface coating".|$|R
50|$|The cars brakes {{themselves}} were insufficient to stop and/or hold {{the car in}} the event of a cable break. Each of the two cars were provided with a wheel brake that acted on all four wheels, and two grip brakes (one for each end) that acted on the central cable conduit slot. However, they were actuated manually (the wheel brake by a <b>lever,</b> the <b>grip</b> brake by a handwheel and chain in a manner similar to conventional tramcar brakes). The latter was too slow to apply {{in the event of a}} car runaway, and the former was found to be insufficient to hold the car when the rails were slippery.|$|R
50|$|The {{cable cars}} of San Francisco are fitted with {{mechanical}} track brakes, {{controlled by a}} large braking lever next to the <b>grip</b> <b>lever.</b> Pulling back on this lever forces replaceable pine wood blocks against the rails; as a result, a cable car descending a steep hill emits an odor of smoldering wood. These track brakes are routinely used many times while traversing a cable car route.|$|R
5000|$|However door knobs can be {{difficult}} for the young and elderly to operate. For this reason, door handles in most American commercial and industrial buildings and in many households use a lever-operated handle, rather than a knob, as the lever does not require a tight <b>grip.</b> <b>Levers</b> are also beneficial on doors with narrow stile widths where the reduced backset leaves insufficient space to comfortably turn a door knob.|$|R
50|$|Power {{signalling}} {{arrived in}} 1910 in Sydney Yard, with the commissioning of (Sydney) Station Box. This installation was electro-pneumatic and controlled from a miniature lever frame {{supplied by the}} McKenzie, Holland & Westinghouse Power Signal Co. of Worcester, England. Although the lines were not continuously track-circuited and absolute block telegraph remained between signalboxes, there was some control of signals by track circuit and treadle. Upon its replacement by a 432 <b>lever</b> pistol <b>grip</b> power frame in the new Sydney Station West signalbox in the late 1920s, the original miniature lever frame was divided into smaller sections for reuse at other locations. The disused 'Station Box' remained in position for decades after its retirement, but has now been demolished, along with its successor.|$|R
5000|$|The Porsche Design Edition 1 is a Cayman S model {{designed}} by Porsche Design, commemorating the 35th anniversary of Porsche Design. The all black car has {{a black leather}} interior on the seats, dashboard, and door trim, as well as black Alcantara steering wheel, gear <b>lever,</b> handbrake <b>grip,</b> and headliner. The DE1 also is fitted standard with the Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM), 19-inch 911 (997) Turbo wheels with 235/35 ZR 19 front and 265/35 ZR 19 rear tires, Porsche Design script on the instrument dials, stainless steel entry plate engraved with [...] "Porsche Design Edition 1", all-red rear taillights, custom vinyl exterior black-on-black graphics, and a numbered plaque on the glovebox cover. As with all PASM-equipped cars, the body is lowered by 10 mm. Standard equipment includes a briefcase containing the Flat Six Chronograph, a pocket knife, a pair of sunglasses, a pen, and a key ring - all in black, even the knife blade.|$|R
50|$|A {{strength}} tester {{machine is}} a type of amusement personality tester machine, which upon receiving credit rates the subject's strength, accordingly how strong the person presses <b>levers,</b> squeezes a <b>grip</b> or punches a punching bag. In the past, strength testers could mainly be found in penny arcades and amusement parks, but they are now also common in pub-style locations as well as video arcades, bowling alleys, family entertainment centers and disco venues. Modern strength testing machines have become redemption games and use LCDs for a video feedback, while some such as Sega's K.O. Punch (1981) use a video game display for feedback.|$|R
5000|$|The true {{emergency}} brake on a cable car {{is known as}} a [...] "slot blade," [...] a steel wedge that can be forced into the slot-rail between the running rails by a strong spring. If a runaway car is moving fast enough that the slot blade is necessary, the friction has been known to weld the blade to the slot rail, disabling the transit line until the obstruction can be extracted with a cutting torch. The slot blade is controlled by the large red <b>lever</b> near the <b>grip,</b> and is not used except for emergency stops.|$|R
50|$|The {{range is}} a new {{generation}} of fire extinguisher designed in response to customer demand. Incorporating innovative features, this is the most user-friendly design of fire extinguishers released this century. With a new quick release mechanism and an ergonomically redesigned handle, <b>lever</b> and hose <b>grip,</b> the Chubb range is easier to use and many models offer improved fire ratings.In terms of the safety release mechanism, the traditional ‘pin’ that prevents the extinguisher from being discharged accidentally has been replaced with an Easy-Pull Clip with arrows to show a clear direction of ‘pull’ in order to activate the extinguisher. The photoluminescent version ensures the clip is visible even if the lights fail. When the clip is pulled, the word ‘USED’ then appears.|$|R
50|$|German {{development}} resumed in {{the late}} 1930s. In an effort to provide infantry with a man-portable lightweight anti-tank rifle, Dipl.-Ing. (certified engineer) B. Brauer at Gustloff Werke in Suhl designed the Panzerbüchse 38 (PzB 38). It was a manually loaded single-shot weapon with a recoiling barrel. When fired, the barrel recoiled about 9 cm, which opened the breech and ejected the spent cartridge casing. The breech block was then arrested in the rear position, remaining opened for the gunner to manually insert a new cartridge. The gunner then released the cocked breech with a <b>lever</b> at the <b>grip.</b> The breech and barrel would then move forward again and the trigger was cocked in preparation to fire. This rather complicated mechanism was reportedly prone to jamming as the system got dirty in field use.|$|R
50|$|Foot pedals can be raised, {{relocated}} (for instance swapped {{to be used}} by {{the opposite}} leg) or replaced with hand-controlled devices. The common form of hand controls consists of a push-pull handle mounted below and projecting {{to the side of the}} steering wheel housing. The bar connects by levers to the accelerator and brake pedals, and is typically pivoted so that pushing applies the accelerator while pulling applies the brake. As there is no facility to work a clutch pedal, hand controls must generally be used in cars with automatic transmissions. With one hand continuously engaged working the hand controls, the steering wheel will generally also be fitted with a steering knob to allow one-handed use. More complex fittings may also connect into the electronic circuitry of the vehicle to place indicator and other switches in easy reach of the driver without requiring them to release the hand controls or steering knob. A guard plate may be fitted to prevent inadvertent contact between the driver's feet and the pedals. Extension <b>levers</b> or adapted <b>grips</b> may also be fitted to the parking brake to allow it to be applied by a driver with limited hand or arm strength.|$|R
