5|$|The lip {{position}} and pressure, shaping of the vocal tract, choice of reed and mouthpiece, amount of air pressure created, and evenness of the airflow account {{for most of}} the clarinetist's ability to control the tone of a clarinet. A highly skilled clarinetist will provide the ideal lip and air pressure for each frequency (note) being produced. They will have an embouchure which places an even pressure across the reed by carefully controlling their lip muscles. The airflow will also be carefully controlled by using the strong stomach muscles (as opposed to the weaker and erratic chest muscles) and they will use the diaphragm to oppose the stomach muscles to achieve a tone softer than a forte rather than weakening the stomach muscle tension to <b>lower</b> <b>air</b> pressure. Their vocal tract will be shaped to resonate at frequencies associated with the tone being produced.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{atmospheric}} convection—the ordinary {{process of}} lower, warm air rising—inversions leave cooler air suspended below warm air, preventing the <b>lower</b> <b>air</b> from rising and trapping airborne pollutants that would ordinarily disperse in the atmosphere. Such weather events are common, {{but they are}} usually followed by a strong cold front that brings an influx of clean air and disperses pollutants before they {{have enough time to}} become highly concentrated; in this case, a cold front approaching west through southern Canada was delayed. When explained in less formal terms, the process of an inversion causing a smog event has been compared to a lid that holds in pollutants or a balloon that fills with pollutants. In general, smog events occur not because of a sudden increase in a region's output of pollution, but rather because weather conditions like stagnant air prevent the dispersal of pollutants that were already present.|$|E

25|$|There {{three main}} types of climate. The first is {{temperate}} and humid, with rains {{in the summer}} and an average annual temperature of between 12 and 18C. There is little rain in the winter but the annual average is about 850mm. This climate prevails at altitudes over 2,000 masl. There is a semi hot and dry climate in areas with average annual temperatures between 18 and 22C with rains {{in the summer and}} little rain in winter. Average annual precipitation is about 500mm. Areas with a semi hot and humid climates have similar rainfall patters but with an average rainfall of just under 1000mm. Summers here are hot and humid. Like {{in the rest of the}} Sierra Gorda, the coldest temperatures occur between December and January, with high temperatures in April and May. In the highest elevations, many of which are in Pinal de Amoles, frosts, freezes and even snow are not uncommon.

500|$|The two {{air sports}} {{that are most}} closely related to gliding are hang gliding and paragliding. Although all three sports rely on rising air, there are {{significant}} differences which are listed in detail in [...] The main difference is that both hang gliders and paragliders are simpler, less sophisticated and cheaper aircraft that use the pilot's feet as the undercarriage. All paragliders and most hang gliders have no protective structure around the pilot. However, the dividing line between basic gliders and sophisticated hang-gliders is becoming less distinct. For example, hang gliders typically use fabric wings, shaped over a framework, but hang gliders with rigid wings and three-axis controls are also available. The <b>lower</b> <b>air</b> speeds and lower glide ratios of typical hang gliders means that shorter cross-country distances are flown than in modern gliders. Paragliders are more basic craft. They are also foot-launched, but their wings usually have no frames and their shape is created by the flow and pressure of air. The airspeeds and glide ratios of paragliders are generally lower still than the typical hang gliders, and so their cross-country flights are even shorter. Radio-controlled gliding uses scale-models of gliders mainly for ridge soaring; however thermic aeromodelling craft are also used.|$|E
500|$|The {{equatorial}} region near the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), or monsoon trough, is the wettest {{portion of the}} world's continents. Annually, the rain belt within the tropics marches northward by August, then moves back southward into the Southern Hemisphere by February and March. Within Asia, rainfall is favored across its southern portion from India east and northeast across the Philippines and southern China into Japan due to the monsoon advecting moisture primarily from the Indian Ocean into the region. The monsoon trough can reach {{as far north as}} the 40th parallel in East Asia during August before moving southward thereafter. Its poleward progression is accelerated by the onset of the summer monsoon which is characterized by the development of <b>lower</b> <b>air</b> pressure (a thermal low) over the warmest part of Asia. Similar, but weaker, monsoon circulations are present over North America and Australia. During the summer, the Southwest monsoon combined with Gulf of California and Gulf of Mexico moisture moving around the subtropical ridge in the Atlantic Ocean bring the promise of afternoon and evening thunderstorms to the southern tier of the United States as well as the Great Plains. The eastern half of the contiguous United States east of the 98th meridian, the mountains of the Pacific Northwest, and the Sierra Nevada range are the wetter portions of the nation, with average rainfall exceeding [...] per year.

500|$|The {{building}} {{will have a}} total of 59 elevators, five {{of which will be}} double-deck elevators, as well as 12escalators. It will also have the highest observation deck in the world, to which high speed elevators will travel at up to 10 metres (33feet) per second (slightly over [...] ) in both directions. The elevators cannot go faster because the change in air pressure at such a rapid speed could cause nausea; at , the air pressure is over 10 kPa (1.5 psi) lower than at ground level (a 10% reduction in air pressure). They must also be efficient so the cables are not unbearably heavy. Jeddah Tower will have three sky lobbies where elevator transfers can be made, and no elevator will go from the bottom to the highest occupied floor. No official floor count has been given; however, Smith stated in a television interview that it will be about 50 floors more than the Burj Khalifa, which has 163occupied floors, leading to the inference that Jeddah Tower will have over 200floors. The tower will also feature a large, roughly [...] diameter outdoor balcony, known as the sky terrace, {{on one side of the}} building for private use by the penthouse floor at level 157; it is not the observation deck. It was originally intended to be a helipad, but it was revealed to be an unsuitable landing environment by helicopter pilots. The building's large notches will also serve as shaded terraces for other areas of the tower and the exterior of the {{building will}} use low-conductivity glass to save on cooling costs by reducing thermal loads. In addition, the <b>lower</b> <b>air</b> density, exacerbated by the thin desert atmosphere, will cause the outdoor air temperature towards the top of the tower to be lower than the ground level air, which will provide natural cooling. There is also significantly more air flow (wind) at heights, which is very strong at one kilometre and had a large impact on the structural design of the tower. The Burj Khalifa actually takes in the cooler, cleaner air from the top floors and uses it to air condition the building. Jeddah Tower will be oriented such that no façade directly faces the sun; it will also use the condensate water from the air conditioning system for irrigation and other purposes throughout the building.|$|E

One {{of the most dramatic}} improvements achievable from area-wide comprehensive tree canopy conservation and planting is reducing the negative effects of urban heat islands (the rise in temperatures due to an increased number of buildings and impermeable surface areas retaining heat). Strategic placement of trees around homes, buildings, streets, and parking lots, increases shade and evapotranspiration, thereby <b>lowering</b> summertime <b>air</b> temperatures and surface temperatures of asphalt, concrete, and other impervious areas. <b>Lowering</b> <b>air</b> summertime temperatures helps reduce ground-level ozone in several ways: Slow the temperature-dependent reaction that forms ground-level ozone; Reduce evaporative emissions, primarily VOCs (precursors to ground-level ozone) from sources such as vehicles; and Reduce the amount of electricity generated for cooling, thereby reducing air pollutant emissions including ground-level ozone precursors, from power plants. In addition, through up-take and contact removal, trees remove ground-level ozone, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, and other ozone precursors from the air. Other air quality benefits from trees include removal of carbon monoxide and fine particulate matter less than 10 microns.
