5|$|To date, {{the most}} {{successful}} commercial application of lipid bilayers has been the use of liposomes for drug delivery, especially for cancer treatment. (Note- the term “liposome” is in essence synonymous with “vesicle” except that vesicle is a general term for the structure whereas <b>liposome</b> refers to only artificial not natural vesicles) The basic idea of liposomal drug delivery is that the drug is encapsulated in solution inside the <b>liposome</b> then injected into the patient. These drug-loaded liposomes travel through the system until they bind at the target site and rupture, releasing the drug. In theory, liposomes should make an ideal drug delivery system since they can isolate nearly any hydrophilic drug, can be grafted with molecules to target specific tissues and can be relatively non-toxic since the body possesses biochemical pathways for degrading lipids.|$|E
5|$|The first {{generation}} of drug delivery liposomes had a simple lipid composition and suffered from several limitations. Circulation in the bloodstream was extremely limited due to both renal clearing and phagocytosis. Refinement of the lipid composition to tune fluidity, surface charge density, and surface hydration resulted in vesicles that adsorb fewer proteins from serum and thus are less readily recognized by the immune system. The most significant advance in this area was the grafting of polyethylene glycol (PEG) onto the <b>liposome</b> surface to produce “stealth” vesicles, which circulate over long times without immune or renal clearing.|$|E
5|$|The first stealth liposomes were passively {{targeted}} at tumor tissues. Because tumors induce rapid and uncontrolled angiogenesis they are especially “leaky” and allow liposomes {{to exit the}} bloodstream {{at a much higher}} rate than normal tissue would. More recently work has been undertaken to graft antibodies or other molecular markers onto the <b>liposome</b> surface in the hope of actively binding them to a specific cell or tissue type. Some examples of this approach are already in clinical trials.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo obtain {{cationic}} <b>liposomes</b> {{of which}} affinity to negatively charged membranes {{can be controlled}} by temperature, cationic <b>liposomes</b> consisting of 3 β-[N-(N′,N′-dimethylaminoethane) carbamoyl]cholesterol and dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine were modified with poly(N-acryloylpyrrolidine), which is a thermosensitive polymer exhibiting a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) at ca. 52 °C. The unmodified cationic <b>liposomes</b> did not change its zeta potential between 20 – 60 °C. The polymer-modified cationic <b>liposomes</b> revealed much lower zeta potential values below the LCST of the polymer than the unmodified cationic <b>liposomes.</b> However, their zeta potential increased significantly above this temperature. The unmodified cationic <b>liposomes</b> formed aggregates and fused intensively with anionic <b>liposomes</b> consisting of egg yolk phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidic acid {{in the region of}} 20 – 60 °C, due to the electrostatic interaction. In contrast, aggregation and fusion of the polymer-modified cationic <b>liposomes</b> with the anionic <b>liposomes</b> were strongly suppressed below the LCST. However, these interactions were enhanced remarkably above the LCST. In addition, the polymer-modified cationic <b>liposomes</b> did not cause leakage of calcein from the anionic <b>liposomes</b> below the LCST, but promoted the leakage above this temperature as the unmodified cationic <b>liposomes</b> did. Temperature-induced conformational change of the polymer chains from a hydrated coil to a dehydrated globule might affect the affinity of the polymer-modified cationic <b>liposomes</b> to the anionic <b>liposomes...</b>|$|R

5|$|A non-pegylated {{liposomal}} doxorubicin, called Myocet, {{is approved}} in Europe and Canada {{for treatment of}} metastatic breast cancer in combination with cyclophosphamide, but has not {{been approved by the}} FDA for use in the United States. Unlike Doxil, the Myocet <b>liposome</b> does not have a polyethylene glycol coating, and therefore does not result in the same rate of hand-foot syndrome. The minimization of this side effect may allow for one-for-one (1:1) substitution with doxorubicin in the same treatment regimen, thereby improving safety with no loss of efficacy. Like Doxil, the liposomal encapsulation of the doxorubicin limits the cardiotoxicity. In theory, by limiting the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin through liposomal encapsulation, it can be used safely in concurrent combination with other cardiotoxic chemotherapy drugs, such as trastuzumab. There is an FDA black box warning that trastuzumab cannot be used in concurrent combination with doxorubicin, only in sequential combination. Though concurrent combination of trastuzumab and doxorubicin in clinical studies found superior tumor response, the combination resulted in unacceptable cardiotoxicity, including risk of cardiac failure manifesting as congestive heart failure (CHF). Published phase II study results have shown that Myocet, trastuzumab, and paclitaxel can safely be used concurrently without the cardiac risk, as measured by reduction in LVEF function, while still achieving superior tumor response. This finding is the basis for the ongoing phase III trial for FDA approval.|$|E
25|$|Two {{theories}} dominate – that in vivo uptake of DNA occurs non-specifically, in {{a method}} similar to phago- or pinocytosis, or through specific receptors. These might include a 30kDa surface receptor, or macrophage scavenger receptors. The 30kDa surface receptor binds specifically to 4500-bp DNA fragments (which are then internalised) and is found on professional APCs and T-cells. Macrophage scavenger receptors bind {{to a variety}} of macromolecules, including polyribonucleotides and are thus candidates for DNA uptake. Receptor-mediated DNA uptake could be facilitated by the presence of polyguanylate sequences. Gene gun delivery systems, cationic <b>liposome</b> packaging, and other delivery methods bypass this entry method, but understanding it may be useful in reducing costs (e.g. by reducing the requirement for cytofectins), which could be important in animal husbandry.|$|E
25|$|For use in {{pharmaceutical}} products, extrusion through nano-porous, polymeric filters {{is being}} used to produce suspensions of lipid vesicles liposomes or transfersomes with a particular size of a narrow size distribution. The anti-cancer drug Doxorubicin in <b>liposome</b> delivery system is formulated by extrusion, for example. Hot melt extrusion is also utilized in pharmaceutical solid oral dose processing to enable delivery of drugs with poor solubility and bioavailability. Hot melt extrusion has been shown to molecularly disperse poorly soluble drugs in a polymer carrier increasing dissolution rates and bioavailability. The process involves the application of heat, pressure and agitation to mix materials together and ‘extrude’ them through a die. Twin-screw high shear extruders blend materials and simultaneously break up particles. The resulting particle can be blended with compression aids and compressed into tablets or filled into unit dose capsules.|$|E

To evaluate the stability in the presence of serum and the in vivo behavior of such <b>liposomes</b> as well as those aspects of neutral and negatively charged <b>liposomes,</b> we investigated liposomal agglutinability in the presence of serum, serum protein binding to these <b>liposomes,</b> and real-time liposomal trafficking by a non-invasive method using positron emission tomography (PET). <b>Liposomes</b> composed of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, cholesterol without or with charged lipid were prepared in the presence of mannitol, and the turbidity change in the presence of serum was determined. Turbidity increase was not observed for so-called long-circulating <b>liposomes,</b> i. e., <b>liposomes</b> modified with glucuronic acid or with poly(ethylene glycol), or for negatively charged <b>liposomes</b> containing dicetyl phosphate (DCP), phosphatidylglycerol, or phosphatidylserine. On the contrary, a significant turbidity increase was observed when positively charged <b>liposomes</b> modified with stearylamine, stearyltrimethylammmonium chloride or 1, 2 -dimyristyloxypropyl- 3 -dimethylhydroxyethyl bromide (DMRIE), which is known as a component of <b>liposomes</b> for gene transfer, were used.

Positively charged <b>liposomes</b> containing DMRIE showed high accumulation in the liver compared with neutral and negatively charged <b>liposomes.</b> Since DMRIE-liposomes tended to aggregate in the presence of serum, and to be associated with serum protein, these characters may lead to the high uptake of DMRIE-liposomes by the liver...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the physical properties and in vivo circulation of chitosan (CH) -coated <b>liposomes</b> of mitoxantrone (MTO).

The uptake of PAA-conjugated <b>liposomes</b> was also inhibited by dextran sulfate and maleylated-bovine serum albumin (maleyl-BSA), which are also known to bind to scavenger receptors. Poly(C) and BSA, which are not ligands for the scavenger receptor, competed poorly with the uptake of PAA-conjugated <b>liposomes.</b> Enhanced uptake of PAA-conjugated <b>liposomes</b> by CHO cells with low scavenger receptor expression was not observed. Unexpectedly, LDL, which is not a ligand for scavenger receptor, also partially inhibited the uptake of PAA-conjugated <b>liposomes.</b> The interaction of PAA-conjugated <b>liposomes</b> with macrophages is complex, and the endocytosis of PAA-conjugated <b>liposomes</b> most likely involves multiple receptors and/or pathways.
