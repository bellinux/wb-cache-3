25|$|The {{services}} of a midwife were not inexpensive; this fact that suggests poorer women who could not afford the {{services of}} a professional midwife often had to make do with female relatives. Many wealthier families had their own midwives. However, the vast majority of women in the Greco-Roman world very likely received their maternity care from hired midwives. They may have been highly trained or possessed only a rudimentary knowledge of obstetrics. Also, many families had a choice of whether or not they wanted to employ a midwife who practiced the traditional folk medicine or the newer methods of professional parturition. <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of other factors in antiquity, quality gynecological care often depended heavily on the socioeconomic status of the patient.|$|E

500|$|The Violin Concerto was Elgar's last popular triumph. The {{following}} year he presented his Second Symphony in London, but was disappointed at its reception.

[...] Elgar asked Reed, [...] "What is the matter with them, Billy? They sit there <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of stuffed pigs." [...] The work was, by normal standards, a success, with twenty-seven performances within three years of its premiere, but it did not achieve the international furore of the First Symphony.|$|E

[...] Davies elaborated on this further in an interview with The Independent's Peter Chapman, saying that the seduction and abandonment of a schoolgirl in the novel needed dramatising.

The writer noted that the series was [...] "more overtly sexual" [...] than previous adaptations of Austen's works and added, [...] "The novel is as much about sex and money as social conventions."
