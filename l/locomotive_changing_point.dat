Originally steam, later diesel locomotives brought trains, particularly coal from the Nottinghamshire coalfield to the down sidings, where the motive power was changed to electric traction for the run over Woodhead to Mottram yard where it was changed again for steam (later diesel) to continue its journey. The returning empty traffic was changed over in the up sidings.|$|R
40|$|It {{is often}} {{desirable}} {{to find the}} underlying trends in time series data. This is a wellknown signal processing problem that has many applications {{in areas such as}} financial dataanalysis, climatology, biological and medical sciences etc. Mean filtering finds a piece-wiseconstant trend in the data while trend filtering finds a piece-wise linear trend. When thesignal is noisy, the main difficulty is finding the <b>changing</b> <b>points</b> in the data. These are thepoints where the mean or the trend changes. We focus on a quadratic cost function with apenalty term on the number of <b>changing</b> <b>points.</b> We use the ` 1 norm for the penalty termas it leads to a sparse solution. This is attractive because the problem is convex in theunknown parameters and well known optimization algorithms exist for this problem. Weinvestigate the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm and twofast taut string methods in terms of computational speed and performance. A well knownproblem is the occurrence of false <b>changing</b> <b>point</b> detection. We incorporate a techniqueto remove these false <b>changing</b> <b>points</b> to the fast mean filtering algorithm resulting in anefficient method with fewer false detections. We also propose an extension of the fast meanfiltering technique to the trend filtering problem. This is an approximate solution that workswell for signals with low noise levels...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the problem of the speakerbased segmentation, which is the first {{necessary}} step for several indexing tasks. It consists in recognizing from their voice the sequence of people engaged in a conversation. In our context, we make no assumptions about prior knowledge of the speaker characteristics (no speaker model, no speech model, no training phase). However, we assume that people do not speak simultaneously. Our segmentation technique takes advantages of two different types of segmentation algorithms. It is organized in two passes: first, the most likely speaker <b>changing</b> <b>points</b> are detected and then, they are validated or discarded. Our algorithm is efficient to detect speaker <b>changing</b> <b>points</b> even close to one another and is thus suited for segmenting conversations containing segments of any length. 1.

40|$|A lithium-Ion {{battery is}} a typical {{degradation}} product, and its performance will deteriorate over time. In its degradation process, regeneration phenomena have been frequently encountered, which affect both the degradation state and rate. In this paper, we focus on how to build the degradation model and estimate the lifetime. Toward this end, we first propose a multi-phase stochastic degradation model with random jumps based on the Wiener process, where the multi-phase model and random jumps at the <b>changing</b> <b>point</b> are {{used to describe the}} variation of degradation rate and state caused by regeneration phenomena accordingly. Owing to the complex structure and random variables, the traditional Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is not suitable for the proposed model. In this case, we treat these random variables as latent parameters, and then develop an approach for model identification based on expectation conditional maximum (ECM) algorithm. Moreover, depending on the proposed model, how to estimate the lifetime with fixed <b>changing</b> <b>point</b> is presented via the time-space transformation technique, and the approximate analytical solution is derived. Finally, a numerical simulation and a practical case are provided for illustration...|$|R
