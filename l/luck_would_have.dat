5|$|As {{microwave}} systems entered service, {{along with}} updated versions of aircraft carrying them, the problem arose {{of what to}} do with those aircraft carrying Mk. IV that were otherwise serviceable. One possibility, suggested as early as 1942, was homing in on the Luftwaffe's own radar sets. The basic operational frequencies of the Luftwaffes counterpart to the Mk. IV, the FuG 202 Lichtenstein BC radar, had been discovered in December 1942. On 3 April 1943 the Air Interception Committee ordered the TRE to begin considering the homing concept under the codename Serrate. As <b>luck</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> it, this proved to be perfect timing. In the late afternoon of 9 May 1943, a crew from IV/NJG.3 defected to the UK by flying their fully equipped Ju 88R-1 night fighter, D5+EV, to RAF Dyce in Scotland, giving the TRE their first direct look at the Lichtenstein.|$|E
5|$|Ramsay's request {{arrived at}} RAF Kenley. Two {{experienced}} pilots, Group Captain Francis Victor Beamish (10 victories) and Wing Commander Finlay Boyd (14 victories), were sent on patrol to investigate. Flying over the channel in Spitfires, {{they ran into}} large numbers of Bf 109s protecting a large fleet of warships and dived away. Holding radio silence they kept their discovery until they landed. They sighted the ships at 10:42 and landed at 11:09. It was another 16 minutes before Bomber Command was alerted and Ramsay {{did not know of}} the situation until 11:30. Soon afterwards, at around 12:16 GMT, the first naval actions began between escorting Schnellboots and British Motor Torpedo Boats (MTBs) and the British were alerted. Galland ordered all low flying to cease and allowed Max Ibel and his team aboard Scharnhorst to break radio silence. Ibel then began directing Fw 190 and Bf 109s toward RAF units heading to the area. As <b>luck</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> it, as the first outnumbered British units entered the airspace over the ships, the German vessels were now at their closest point to German airfields. It allowed the Luftwaffe to offer maximum protection.|$|E

25|$|Cook's {{status as}} one of the South's most famous photographers was due in part to his visit to Fort Sumter on Feb. 8, 1861, which {{resulted}} in the first mass marketing of cartes-de-visite, a photograph of the fort's commander, Maj. Robert Anderson. A successful portrait business that survived the war, and the systematic documentation of Union shelling of Charleston and in particular, Fort Sumter added to Cook's fame. Then, on September 8, 1863 he and business partner James Osborn photographed the inside of Fort Sumter, and as <b>luck</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> it, also captured the developing naval action in the harbor, Federal ironclads firing on Fort Moultrie.|$|E

Many of the cardinals, wishing to temporise and conceal their real intentions, had voted for the man they considered least likely to have any supporters.

5000|$|In {{the short}} story, Dravot and {{co-conspirator}} Peachey Carnehan {{are members of}} the Third Degree of Freemasonry. Travelling to Kafiristan (in modern Afghanistan) with the intention of becoming kings, the two make a very convenient discovery: the natives are in possession of the secrets of both the First and Second Degrees of Freemasonry, but not those of the Third Degree. Dravot puts on his Master Mason's apron, whereupon the natives recognise the Third Degree symbol as their own sacred symbol concealed on the bottom of a stone. As <b>luck</b> <b>would</b> (again) <b>have</b> it, the stone on which the symbol is engraved is the very stone upon which Dravot is then sitting. Dravot immediately declares himself [...] "Grand Master of All Kafiristan" [...] and also Co-King of Kafiristan along with Peachey. The conspiracy is eventually discovered, and results in the death of Dravot. Peachey is crucified between two trees, and survives for a day. The natives see this, and let him go. He later returns, finds the narrator, and tells him the story of what has happened.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The New Media Juke-Box is an {{experiment}} {{carried out at}} the University of Lugano {{in collaboration with the}} RTSI – Radio and Television of Italian-speaking Switzerland. The goal of the project was the integration and exploitation of archive media artefact into a new learning context. After a review of a general model of educational multimedia, a case study is presented, along with lessons learnt, general conclusions and some critical remarks. Introduction: Artefacts and Tradition Remembering our past, comparing events that happened years or decades ago, recalling a particular perspective of our contemporary history and connecting events one with the other – that is what we do when we go to museums, to libraries, to cinema retrospectives or when we look for books or other cultural and media artefacts that connect present and past.

In spite of a financial respite, the winter of 1857 was a difficult one for Whistler. [...] His poor health, made worse by excessive smoking and drinking, laid him low.|$|E

40|$|The leading {{discourse}} about luck egalitarianism has been {{informed by the}} distinction between equality of welfare and equality of resources. This paper attempts to illuminate its significance {{by focusing on the}} status of individual preferences (in particular, preferences which are particularly costly to satisfy) as regards egalitarian distribution. It then considers another distinction: that between “persons” and “circumstances” to see how it correlates with the central moral intuition which triggers the egalitarian approach, namely that social inequalities should be allowed to reflect the choices people make {{in the course of their}} lives. I argue that if we consistently maintain the centrality of choice for the whole theory, and construct the technical concept of “resources” accordingly, we may well realize that the gap between “equality of welfare” and “equality of resources” is not as wide as many theorists of <b>luck</b> egalitarianism <b>would</b> <b>have</b> us believe. Finally, I address head-on the crucial issue lying in the background of this whole discussion: is the aspiration to eliminate systemically the impact of bad luck egalitarian?

2500|$|Georgescu {{had taken}} {{a leave of absence}} from the Bucharest Philharmonic and settled in Paris, {{nominally}} to rest from his strenuous exertions of the immediately preceding years, although he nonetheless conducted concerts there with the Concerts Colonne orchestra. [...] When he went to the train station to pay his respects to Queen Maria of Romania, who was passing through the city en route to the United States, she insisted that he should go there as well, even though he had no engagements and no reputation there through which to obtain any. [...] As <b>luck</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> it, however, in New York he took up lodgings in close proximity to and made the acquaintance of Arthur Judson, manager of the New York Philharmonic and representative of, among others, Arturo Toscanini, who then shared the New York Philharmonic podium with Mengelberg. [...] Thus, when issues of health compelled Toscanini to cancel his remaining appearances beginning in late 1926, Judson immediately thought of Georgescu as a potential replacement, albeit an unknown quantity. [...] After obtaining reassurance from Richard Strauss, Judson recommended Georgescu for the position, and in December 1926 Georgescu made his US debut with the New York Philharmonic, scoring a critical success in music of Smetana, Schubert, and Richard Strauss. [...] He would continue to conduct the orchestra for some months thereafter. [...] Moreover, as in Romania, Georgescu offered his services in the cause of opera during his American sojourn. [...] On January 20, 1927, he conducted a single performance of La bohème with the Washington National Opera, a struggling semi-professional company active in the US capital from 1919 to 1936 and {{not to be confused with}} the present company of the same name. [...] Probably recruited at short notice because of Jacques Samossoud's abrupt departure from the company over a contract dispute, Georgescu received favorable notice in The Washington Post, which likened his style of conducting to that of Leopold Stokowski. [...] Later, making his return to Europe, Georgescu traveled on the same ship as Toscanini, and the two former cellists developed a friendship.|$|E
