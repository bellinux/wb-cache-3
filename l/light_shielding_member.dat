40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{is described}} {{for measuring the}} effectiveness of stray <b>light</b> suppression <b>light</b> <b>shields</b> and baffle arrangements used in optical space experiments and large space telescopes. The <b>light</b> <b>shield</b> and baffle arrangement and a telescope model are contained in a vacuum chamber. A source of short, high-powered light energy illuminates portions of the <b>light</b> <b>shield</b> and baffle arrangement and reflects a portion of same to a photomultiplier tube by virtue of multipath scattering. The resulting signal is transferred to time-channel electronics timed by the firing of the high energy light source allowing time discrimination of the signal thereby enabling the light scattered and suppressed by the model to be distinguished from the walls and holders around the apparatus...|$|R

40|$|A {{method for}} an active light noise filter is {{proposed}} by using two identical light receivers. They {{work as a}} differential electrometer by a common mode connection. Therefore, only an output of a laser light incident upon one receiver can be obtained as a signal. It was found from the experiment that the light noise was reduced to about 0. 6 % in the usual light room and further the {{signal to noise ratio}} was improved up to 30 times at least as compared to a usual <b>light</b> <b>shielding</b> method. The method can then be effectively used under a well-lighted room such as a factory without noise <b>light</b> <b>shielding</b> cover...|$|R

40|$|Summary of Research {{that was}} part of the grant: NASA NAG 5 - 13405 : Magnetic Characterization of Micro Shutters for James Web Space Telescope (JWST) Period: May 1 2003 -October 31 2005 The above funding {{resulted}} in following major achievements related to microshutter system for JWST. 1. The original rectangular pattern of magnetic material was changed into magnetic striped pattern to prevent unnecessary twisting during the actuation. The Original geometry favored magnetic remanence vector being oriented along the longer side of the shutter and thus resulting torque caused out of plane twist. Stripe pattern minimizes the out of plane motion and thus prolongs the life-time of microshutter device. 2. We built a new magnetic system (magnetic rotisserie) allowing an accelerated life test of microshutters at various temperatures. This system identified that shutter are capable to withstand as many as several millions of actuating cycles. Our system also identified fabrication related features, like bowing with temperature, collisions with the frame due to misalignment, delaminating of the <b>light</b> <b>shields</b> due to uncontrolled voltage release and poorly fabricated <b>light</b> <b>shields...</b>|$|R
