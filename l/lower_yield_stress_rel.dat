40|$|International audienceA {{physically}} based {{model for}} bake-hardening (BH) steels is developed suitable {{to predict the}} BH {{as well as the}} macroscopic behavior of strain-aged steels in tensile tests, such as the <b>lower</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> and the <b>yield</b> point elongation or Lüders strain. A description of the strain aging kinetics is given by considering two aging steps: Cottrell atmospheres formation and precipitation of coherent carbides. The modeling includes the effect of solute carbon content, aging time, temperature, and prestrain. Then, a numerical approach of Lüders phenomenon using finite element (FE) method codes is conducted. The strain aging model is eventually coupled with the previous numerical study thanks to a local mechanical behavior that schematically describes the local dislocation behavior. Simulations of tensile tests are performed and agree well with experiments carried out on aluminum-killed (AlK) and ULC BH steels, in terms of <b>lower</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> and <b>yield</b> point elongation. Effects of aging treatment, grain size, and strain rate on the macroscopic behavior are particularly enlightened...|$|R

The variation of this curve with change in strain rate, and the progressive deformation of the steel are also studied. An impact testing machine was used, straining being carried out {{as a series of}} dynamic loadings, and the stress was measured by means of electrical resistance strain gauges attached directly to the specimens. Comparison is effected between dynamic and static stress-strain curves, the existence of a “dynamic upper <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> ” and a “dynamic <b>lower</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> ” being shown, together with a difference in the rate of strain hardening for the two straining conditions. Non-uniform yielding of the metal is shown to be more pronounced for dynamic straining and, like static yielding, to {{be an integral part of}} the <b>lower</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> phenomenon. The manner in which all these factors are aEected by normalizing the steel is shown. A special form of deformation of the steel peculiar to rapid straining is indicated.

40|$|In {{the simple}} plastic theory {{commonly}} used for mild steel {{it is assumed}} that after yielding has occurred in either tension or compression, straining can continue indefinitely at constant stress. Such au assumption has been found satisfactory for low carbon steels having a plastic range corresponding to eight to ten times the strain a t yield, but for steels of greater strength th is range is often considerably shorter, and it becomes necessary {{to take into account the}} strain-hardening range beyond. To obtain experimental data, four steels were selected, varying in carbon content from 0. 28 to 0. 89 per cent, and having widely different stress-strain relations. For each steel a number of simply supported beams of square section were subjected to a symmetrical two-point loading; tension specimens were prepared from the unyielded ends of these beams and tested in a spring-loaded autographic testing machine to determine upper and <b>lower</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stresses.</b> In addition, two tension specimens from each steel were tested in a lever type of machine, and the strt%ss-strain relations through the plastic range and the initial stages of the strain-hardening range were obtained with the aid of a “Gerard ” extensometer.

Three grades of anhydrous lactose {{were used in the}} study: “as is” manufacturer grade and 2 particle size fractions obtained by screening of the 60 M lactose. Particle growth behavior of the 3 lactose grades was evaluated in a high shear mixer. Compactibility and porosity of the resulting granules were also evaluated. A uniaxial compression test on moist agglomerates of the 3 lactose grades was performed in an attempt to explain the mechanism of particle size effect observed in the high shear mixer. Particle growth of anhydrous lactose in the high shear mixer was inversely related to the particle size of the starting material. In addition, granulation manufactured using the grade with the smallest particle size was more porous and demonstrated enhanced compactibility compared with the other grades. Compacts with similar porosity and low liquid saturation demonstrated brittle behavior and their breakage strength was inversely related to lactose particle size in the uniaxial compression test, suggesting that material with smaller particle size may exhibit more pronounced nucleation behavior during wet granulation. On the other hand, compacts prepared at higher liquid saturation and similar compression force exhibited more plastic behavior and showed <b>lower</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> for the grade with smallest particle size. The <b>lower</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> of compacts prepared with this grade may indicate a higher coalescence tendency for its granules during wet granulation...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of an experimental investigation of the initiation of brittle fracture and the nature of discontinuous yielding in small plastic enclaves in an annealed mild steel. Upper and <b>lower</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> data have been obtained from unnotched specimens and nominal fracture stress data have been obtained from specimens of two scale factors and two grain sizes over a range of nominal stress rates from 10 ^ 2 to 10 ^ 7 lb/in. ^ 2 sec at - 111 °F and - 200 °F. The size and shape of plastic enclaves near the notches were revealed by an etch technique. A stress analysis utilizing slip-line field theory in the plastic region has been developed for the notched specimen geometry employed in this investigation. The <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> of the material in the plastic enclaves near the notch root has been correlated with the <b>lower</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> measured on unnotched specimens through a consideration of the plastic boundary velocity under dynamic loading. A maximum tensile stress of about 122, 000 lb/in. ^ 2 at the instant of fracture initiation was calculated with the aid of the stress analysis for the large scale specimens of ASTM grain size 8 1 / 4. The plastic strain state adjacent to a plastic-elastic interface has been shown to cause the maximum shear stress to have a larger value on the elastic than the plastic side of the interface. This characteristic of dis continuous yielding is instrumental in causing the plastic boundaries to be nearly parallel to the slip-line field where the plastic strain is of the order of the Lüder's strain. ...|$|R

A worksheet containing a basic cement slurry recipe was used as basis for comparison against the slurries containing lost circulation material.

Clad material however, offer new challenges in the fracture assessment methodology due to inhomogeneous material, where the backing steel usually is low alloy carbon steel of 415 or 450 MPa <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> and the clad layer basically has a significantly <b>lower</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stress.</b> In addition, the weld metal mechanical properties may only be partly overmatching compared to the base material. For operational conditions where the local material utilization exceeds the elastic limit, commonly used assessment methods based on analytical fracture models such as BS 7910 might be inadequate for clad pipelines, and more detailed finite element modeling must be performed. This paper addresses the relevant load scenarios for a clad steel pipeline installed by S-lay. A dedicated finite element program, LINKpipe has been used for the analyses to verify the acceptance criteria for defects in the girth welds. Input data for the analyses are taken from the detailed pipeline design calculations and material testing of the actual welding procedures of girth welds...|$|R
