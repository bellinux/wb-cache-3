A common reason for a cartridge failing to load into a drive is the misplacement of the <b>leader</b> <b>pin</b> as a result of the cartridge having been dropped. The plastic slot where the pin is normally held is deformed by the drop and the <b>leader</b> <b>pin</b> is no longer in the position that the drive expects it to be.|$|R

Outstanding Volunteer is awarded for Outstanding service as Girl Scout {{volunteer}} (other than a leader). Outstanding Leader is awarded for Outstanding service as Girl Scout <b>leader.</b> Appreciation <b>Pin</b> is awarded for exceptional performance beyond {{expectations for the}} position. The Honor Pin recognizes an adult member who has delivered exceptional service beyond expectations to two or more geographic areas, service units or program delivery audiences {{in a way that}} furthers the council's goals. Thanks Badge recognizes outstanding service for two or more [...] "service units". Different GS councils use different terminology for regions within their council. Thanks Badge II is awarded where the recipient has received the Thanks Badge and the recipient’s service continues to merit further recognition. At least one nomination, two endorsements, and a review of the forms is required for each of these awards.|$|R
40|$|The “feminization of religion” {{during the}} nineteenth century has {{received}} {{a great deal of attention}} by historians of religion over the past two decades, but less work has been done to examine the Church's response to this feminization. This article seeks to make a contribution to the historiography on gender and religion by examining the German Jünglingsvereine, or religious youth groups, at the end of the nineteenth century. Analyzing the practical and theoretical writings of the founders of these groups, as well as group newsletters and internal publications, this article suggests that the Church responded to the feminization of religion by creating young men's clubs into which an older generation of Church leaders instilled its morals and beliefs. These groups, in their program of religious edification, continued education, and carefully fostered atmosphere of sociability, advanced a religiously defined notion of masculinity aimed at producing upright, strong, continent, and patriotic members of German society. Church <b>leaders</b> <b>pinned</b> their hopes for cultural relevance on German teenagers using patriotic and gendered discourse. An examination of this discourse offers a glimpse at the dynamics of masculinity, religion, and youth in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Germany...|$|R

[...] In May 2012, he voted for H.R. 4310, which increased defense spending by $8 billion, including spending for the War in Afghanistan and for weapon systems. In 2012, Ryan explained his support for defense spending sequestration in the hope that this would open common ground with the Democrats on deficit reduction. His comments led defense industry <b>leaders</b> to <b>pin</b> their final hopes on the chance that Congress would at least allow the Pentagon to direct the coming cuts.|$|R

40|$|BackgroundIn Sweden, as elsewhere, the {{development}} of evidence-based practice (EBP) in social work has been debated {{for over a decade}} now. One of the issues concerns the top-down strategy used by the Swedish government to enhance the knowledge about interventions in social work practice. Critiques argue {{that this is not a}} feasible way forward; instead the social work profession needs to take over the <b>leader</b> <b>pin.</b> This of course calls for structures that enable social work practitioners and researchers to engage in practice-based research in order to solve current and urgent issues. Academic primary- -care centers have been established as a possible way forward in implementing an evidence-based medicine in Swedish healthcare. Clinical research is one of the basic tasks in those centers, involving much of the personal. Here, we will reflect upon the possibilities for a similar approach within the social services. This presentation aims to present research about the conditions for new pathways between Swedish social work practice and research and to critically review the idea of academic social services offices. The following questions will be addressed:(i) What characterizes an academic social services office?(ii) What are the opinions of management in charge?(iii) What are the recommendations from research? MethodsA survey was launched twice (2005 and 2015) to the leading association of administrative leaders in the social services in Sweden. Among other things they were asked about their opinions of EBP and of clinical research in social work, also if they were in the need of staff with a PhD-education. Furthermore, a review of relevant literature and expert consultations is being undertaken focusing on significant mechanisms when it comes to establishing structures in order to support {{the development}} of academic social services offices and practice-based research. ResultsResults from the survey show that leaders are more positive towards EBP today than ten years ago. However they are not keen on hiring staff educated in research and especially management in smaller organizations express severe difficulties to hire staff with appropriate skills and to further develop the competence to do research within their workplace. This calls for collaborations with other organizations as well as with researchers from universities and R & D-units. Results from reviews and expert-interviews will be added. ConclusionsAdministrative leaders support the idea of a knowledge-based social work and to use interventions whose effects are demonstrated by evaluations. However they lack strategies, competence and role-models to create a research-based organization. This paper-presentation contributes to the building of bridges between practice and research through presenting analysis of the views of management as well as innovative ways of research-production within the social services...|$|R
40|$|The pinning/leader control {{problems}} {{provide the}} design of the <b>leader</b> or <b>pinning</b> controller in order to guide a complex network to a desired trajectory or target (synchronization or consensus). Let a time invariant complex network, the design includes the tuning of pinning gain and number of nodes to pin. Usually lower is the number of pinned nodes larger is the pinning gain required to assess network synchronization (consensus). On the other side, realistic application scenario of complex networks is characterized by switching topologies, time varying node coupling strength and link weight that make hard to solve the pinning/leader control problem. Additionally, the system dynamics at nodes can be heterogeneous. In this paper we derive robust stabilization conditions of time varying heterogeneous complex networks with jointly connected topologies when coupling strength and link weight interactions are affected by time varying uncertainties. By employing Lyapunov stability theory and Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) technique, we formulate stabilizability conditions to design a pinning/leader control gain to guarantee the asymptotic network synchronization to the pinner trajectory. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown by several design examples applied to a paradigmatic well known complex network composed of heterogeneous Chua’s circuits. The proposed LMIs are low computationally demanding and can be easily solved by the MATLAB toolbox, also for large scale complex networks...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{mission of}} the Teaching Leader Series is to {{strengthen}} teaching, learning and assessment skills by providing opportunities and support for faculty to achieve educational excellence, promote interdisciplinary collaboration and encourage instructional innovation. Background: The Series {{is based on the}} assumption that an inclusive strategy would help ensure sustainability and that unique learning experiences occur when two or more professions together learned with, from, and about each other’s teaching practice. Since the Series began in 2008 over 20 different topics have been presented including Adult Learning, Curriculum Development, Narrative Medicine, and Teaching with Simulation and Standardized Patients. Description of Intervention or Program: We recognize individuals who have made the Series a part of their educational process and their development as teaching <b>leaders</b> with a <b>pin.</b> In order to receive a pin, participants must attend at least 6 workshops, prepare a report describing how they have applied information from the workshop and must agree to participate in a best practice focus group. Our goal is to have these individuals team teach a workshop with a current presenter who serves as their mentor. Results: The Series demographics are 50 % nurses, 25 % physicians, and 25 % other educators. At the conclusion of each workshop, participants are asked to complete a self-retrospective evaluation. During AY 2011 92 % of participants agreed that they would be able to apply what they learned to their job. Pin recipients (physician, pharmacists, nurse) have presented Teaching at the Bedside and Small Group Teaching with a PhD medical educator mentor. Relevance to interprofessional education or practice: Healthcare is practiced in teams and the Series models the importance and effectiveness of interprofessional learning and teaching. Not only are the participants from different disciplines, we also pair presenters from different disciplines. Learning Objectives: Upon completion of this session the participants will be able to Identify the effectiveness of providing interprofessional faculty development. Identify how interprofessional faculty development facilitates collaboration of clinical educators across traditional boundaries. Identify strategies used to integrate interprofessional education into faculty development...|$|R

Instead, Althorp’s Act (the 1833 Factory Act) was passed, Althorp commenting that if adult millworkers {{wanted to}} limit their hours of work they should do it themselves. Fielden joined with others to form a National Regeneration Society which intended to accumulate enough adherent millworkers to insist to mill-owners that adults as well as children should work {{no more than an}} eight-hour day [...] This led to a split with those factory reform <b>leaders</b> still <b>pinning</b> their hopes in securing a ten-hour act by legislation. A plan to coordinate presentation of demands to millowners in spring 1834 came to nothing. It amounted to formation of a national trade union; this was difficult at the best of times (which 1834, the year of the conviction of the Tolpuddle Martyrs, was not) and the union was broken up by pre-emptive action by employers [...] In 1835 he suggested that the government should set minimum piece-rates for hand-loom work. [...] In response to hand-loom weavers doubting his sincerity and proposing instead other measures including a tax on power looms, Fielden concurred with the desirability of many of the other measures, but held that the best tax on machinery was to limit the hours it could be worked. In 1836 he opposed Poulet Thomson’s Bill, speaking against it in Parliament and producing a pamphlet The Curse of the Factory System ("A Short Account of the Origin of Factory Cruelties; of the Attempts to Protect the Children by Law; of Their Present Sufferings; Our Duty Towards Them; Injustice of Mr Thomson's Bill; the Folly of the Political Economists; a Warning Against Sending the Children of the South into the Factories of the North") whose object he summarised as [...] "to show that the workpeople have been and are cruelly treated; that they have not idly asked for protection, but that humanity and justice require it; that we shall do ourselves no harm by granting it to them; but always avowing, that I would cast manufactures to the winds, rather than see the workpeople enslaved, maimed, vitiated, and broken in constitution and in heart, as these pages will but too amply prove they now are."He spoke of his own experience as a factory child forty years previous, and showed why the work was as (or more) onerous for children in the 1830s as he had found it in the 1790s: As I have been personally and from an early age engaged in the operations connected with factory labour; that is to say, for about 40 years, a short account of my own experience may not be useless in this place, as it is this experience which teaches me to scoff at the representations of those who speak of the labour of factories as [...] " [...] very light," [...] and [...] "so easy, as to require no muscular exertion." [...] I well remember being set to work in my father's mill when I was little more than ten years old; my associates, too, in the labour and in recreation are fresh in my memory. Only a few of them are now alive; some dying very young, others living to become men and women; but many of those who lived have died off before they had attained the age of fifty years, having the appearance of being much older, a premature appearance of age which I verily believe was caused {{by the nature of the}} employment in which they had been brought up. For several years after I began to work in the mill, the hours of labour at our works did not exceed ten in the day, winter and summer, and even with the labour of those hours, I shall never forget the fatigue I often felt before the day ended, and the anxiety of us all to be relieved from the unvarying and irksome toil we had gone through before we could obtain relief by such play and amusements as we resorted to when liberated from our work. I allude to this fact, because it is not uncommon for persons to infer, that, because the children who work in factories are seen to play like other children when they have time to do so, the labour is, therefore, light, and does not fatigue them. The reverse of this conclusion I know to be the truth. I know the effect which ten hours' labour had upon myself; I who had the attention of parents better able than those of my companions to allow me extraordinary occasional indulgence. And he knows very little of human nature who does not know, that, to a child, diversion is so essential, that it will undergo, even exhaustion in its amusements. I protest, therefore, against the reasoning, that, because a child is not brought so low in spirit as to be incapable of enjoying the diversions of a child, it is not worked to the utmost that its feeble frame and constitution will bear.I well know, too, from my own experience, that the labour now undergone in the factories is much greater than it used to be, owing to the greater attention and activity required by the greatly-increased speed which is given to the machinery that the children have to attend to, when we compare it with what it was 30 to 40 years ago; and, therefore, I fully concur with the government commissioners, that a restriction to ten hours per day, is not a sufficient protection to children.The work at which I was employed in my boyhood, while it was limited to ten hours a day, was similar to the work that children have to do in the woollen mills of Yorkshire at the present time, with this difference, that wool is the manufacture in the Yorkshire mills to which I allude, and the manufacture that I was employed in was cotton, the mode of manufacturing which has been altogether changed since that period by the improvements made in machinery. These are facts which I mention, because the labour of the child in the woollen now, is what its labour in the cotton was then, the work being done on what are called [...] "billies" [...] and [...] "jennies"; and I mention them, too, because the woollen manufacturers would have it believed that the work of children in woollen mills is still lighter than that in the cotton factories, and that children, much younger than those whose labour is now limited to eight hours a day, may without injury to their health, be worked 69 hours per week. Indeed, it is on this, that the Yorkshire mill-owners have petitioned the House of Commons to allow them to work children of eight years of age as many as 72 hours in the week, or 12 hours in the day ! The 'curse of the factory system' was not that the system existed, but that it had been left unregulated. Consequently, improvements in machinery allowed no improvement in hours and conditions for the workforce; instead there was a race to the bottom: Most of the masters are obliged to admit the excessive hours of labour imposed on children, and the ministers have done it in the most solemn manner; but they cannot interfere with the labour, the [...] "free labour" [...] of the adult, because that is against sound principle! According to their own showing, it is a choice of evils; bur, contrary to reason, contrary to all acknowledged principle and to universal practice, they would choose the greater: they would overwork the child, though nature forbids it, rather than shorten the labour of the adult, who is also overworked. In short, their [...] "principle", their true and scarcely disguised [...] "principle [...] " [...] is the principle of pelf against nature.Here, then, is the [...] "curse" [...] of our factory system: as improvements in machinery have gone on, the [...] "avarice of masters" [...] has prompted many to exact more labour from their hands than they were fitted by nature to perform, and those who have wished for the hours of labour to be less for all ages than the legislature would even yet sanction, have had no alternative but to conform more or less to the prevailing practice, or abandon the trade altogether ...|$|R
