40|$|We {{present the}} first {{experimental}} {{data about the}} response of partially (PD) and fully (FD) depleted MOSFETs manufactured in a O. l mum SOI CMOS technology to heavy ion irradiation. After exposure {{to just a few}} iodine ions, several different phenomena were present. Some effects were found in all the devices we tested with good reproducibility and depended on the ion fluence; others were present from time to time, likely depending on the exact location of the ion strike and/or on the presence of pre-existing defects. Among the first category were an increase in the gate leakage current for both PD and FD devices and a reduction in the linear kink effect which is featured only by PD samples. Concerning the sporadic effects, shifts in the threshold voltage of the main and <b>lateral</b> <b>parasitic</b> <b>transistors</b> and reductions in maximum transconductance were found in few devices after irradiation. We related all these phenomena to the creation of defects in the gate oxide and/or charge build-up in the lateral isolation/LDD spacers...|$|R

40|$|Electron-beam {{analysis}} of the turn-on speed of grounded-gate nMOS ESD protection transistors during Charge-Device-Model (CDM) stress pulses In a highly automated IC production environment, the most relevant ESD hazards are represented by the fast discharge to ground of the charge accumulated on the devices through the manufacturing equipments. This ESD event is described by the Charge Device Model (CDM) and is characterized by very durations and rise-times, in the ns and sub-ns range. The availability of experimental techniques capable of characterizing the response of protection circuits submitted to CDM ESD pulses is of crucial importance to improve IC hardness. This paper shows that an electron beam testing system with 150 ps resolution can provide a detailed information on the dynamic behaviour of grounded gate nMOS transistors submitted to fast, CDM-like tests.

A 600 keV boron implanation was used to substitute a conventional 80 keV implant followed by a 1100 degree, 105 min drive-in step. The well implantation was done at three different doses (5 x 10 high 12 cmhighminus 2, 1 x 10 high 13 cmhighminus 2 and 5 x 10 high 13 cmhighminus 2). To meet requierements of a given CMOS process {{with respect to the}} surface concentration, an additional 140 keV boron implanation was performed for the retrogade well structures. The resulting concentration profiles were measured by SIMS. In order to characterize the structure electrically, the current gain of the <b>parasitic</b> bipolar <b>transistors</b> and the current voltage characteristics of the parasitic thyristor were measured for both well types.

40|$|The current {{trend for}} space {{application}} systems is towards fully integrated systems-on-a-chip. To facilitate this drive, high-voltage transistors must reside {{on the same}} substrate as low-voltage transistors. These systems must also be radiation tolerant, particularly for space missions such as the Europa Lander and Titan Explorer. SOI CMOS technology offers high levels of radiation hardness. As a result, a high-voltage lateral MOSFET has been developed in a partially-depleted (PD) SOI technology.

5000|$|It {{can be seen}} {{in figure}} 1 that the source {{metallization}} connects both the N+ and P+ implantations, although the operating principle of the MOSFET only requires the source to be connected to the N+ zone. However, if it were, this would result in a floating P zone between the N-doped source and drain, which is equivalent to a NPN transistor with a non-connected base. Under certain conditions (under high drain current, when the on-state drain to source voltage is in the order of some volts), this <b>parasitic</b> NPN <b>transistor</b> would be triggered, making the MOSFET uncontrollable. The connection of the P implantation to the source metallization shorts the base of the <b>parasitic</b> <b>transistor</b> to its emitter (the source of the MOSFET) and thus prevents spurious latching.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We {{characterize}} the TID resilience and annealing response of high-density SRAMs, fabricated in 90 nm commercial processes. Results demonstrate intrinsic SRAM hardness at 300 krad(Si), but also reveal several {{orders of magnitude}} increase in leakage current at 1 Mrad(Si) of exposure, with recorded critical functionality failures. However, the technology is shown to be very responsive to temperature treatments as all chips recover to pre-rad leakage levels after 5 hours at 150 o C with fully regained functionality. Finally, consecutive exposure/anneal cycles reveal a drastic improvement in TID resilience as SRAMs that did undergo at least one postrad anneal stayed fully functional up to the strategic TID level of 2 Mrad(Si) once re-exposed. The gained resilience is attributed to negative interface trapped charge build-up along the STI walls: it progressively turns OFF the channel of <b>parasitic</b> <b>transistors</b> responsible for TID-induced leakage paths creation.

The <b>parasitic</b> edge <b>transistors</b> in both oxide trench isolated SEG N-MOSFETs and ELO-SOI N-MOSFETs were eliminated. ^ A unique and simple method is demonstrated for characterizing the electrical impact of a single stacking fault on Fully Depleted Thin-Film SOI MOSFETs. SOI islands are created using the SEG/ELO technology. The stacking faults are observed using a optical Nomarski microscope. Both P and N-MOSFETs, {{with the presence of}} a single stacking fault entirely in the channel region, are measured. The influence of a stacking fault on device I-V characteristics is determined and compared to that of nearby identical devices without stacking faults. It is found that the threshold voltage increased and saturation current decreased. MOSFETs with a stacking fault only in the drain edge under the gate are found to have high subthreshold leakages under high drain voltage bias.
