Experimental results showed that all adhesives had greater Vickers hardness values, Young's moduli and tensile strengths at CT. The performance of CCNT/epoxy adhesive at CT was outstanding due to the enhancement of mechanical interlocking effect between CCNTs and epoxy at low temperature. This effect led to a greater Vickers hardness value, Young's modulus and <b>lap</b> joint <b>shear</b> strength of this adhesive at CT when compared with MWNT/epoxy type. The result from finite element analysis (FEA) also proved that the contraction of matrix at CT induced additional clamping force {{onto the surface of}} nanotubes.

All of the three welding configurations have been used to provide metallurgical bonds between both similar and dissimilar metal pairs. The welded materials include copper alloy, aluminium alloy, and steels. The plates are centimeter or more thick and often centimeter in extent. The critical welding process parameters were instrumentally investigated by Rogowski Coil and Photon Doppler Velocimetry.

In addition, the mechanical strength of different material combinations joined by micro clinching with cutting was measured in single <b>lap</b> <b>shearing</b> tests. According to the achieved results, this novel technique is more suitable for material combinations where the upper foil is thicker than lower foil. With the increase of laser energy, the interlock increased while the minimum thickness of upper foil decreased gradually.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the fatigue {{performance}} of tensile steel/CFRP (Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer) double <b>shear</b> <b>lap</b> joints is discussed. Joints were realized with two steel plates and two CFRP strips bonded using epoxy adhesive. Fatigue tests {{were performed on}} 16 specimens under constant stress range loading cycles. Two stress ratios (R = 0. 1 and R = 0. 4) were considered to investigate their influence on the fatigue lifetime. Debonding was observed to occur at stress concentration zones and propagate along the CFRP/adhesive interfaces. The stiffness degradation of the steel joint due to progressive debonding of the adhesive represents an index for the subsequent and progressive global failure. S–N curves are defined and compared to the fatigue resistance of welded detail categories of the Eurocode 3. The tests showed that the stress ratio, R, has a marginal influence on the fatigue lifetime of the steel/CFRP double <b>shear</b> <b>lap</b> joints.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the tool dimensions and of the welding parameters on the fracture and <b>lap</b> <b>shear</b> properties of friction stir spot welds is investigated. Interrupted <b>lap</b> <b>shear</b> tests allow to follow the mechanisms leading to weld fracture. A triangular cavity opens at the hook during <b>lap</b> <b>shear</b> testing. The distance between this triangular cavity and the hole left by the pin is the main parameter controlling the type of fracture.

Fracture initiating at the triangular cavity and following the thermomechanically affected zone, i. e., by the pullout of the weld nugget, is preferred. This fracture type leads to significant plastic deformation and generally favors a large ultimate force during <b>lap</b> <b>shear</b> testing.

Due to the advantages over other joining techniques, self-piercing riveting (SPR) is a main joining technique for aluminium structures. In this paper, the effect of setting velocity/force on the joint quality and performance was studied.

However, the prediction of the energy-dissipation characteristics of such joints remains a challenging problem. A cubic relationship between energy dissipated and load magnitude is often assumed in classical joint dynamics, but experiments generally fail to support this assertion. In {{nearly all of the}} joint models examined previously, Coulomb friction and uniform pressure in the joint were assumed. Realizing that the Coulomb model may not adequately represent the actual dynamic friction in the slip region of the joint interface and that the actual interfacial pressure is likely nonuniformly distributed, we utilize a distributed-parameter joint model to investigate the constitutive relation and energy dissipation associated with a <b>shear</b> <b>lap</b> joint under longitudinal loading. Two nonuniform pressure distributions in a one-dimensional structure are considered. In both, under the Coulomb friction law, the energy dissipation resulting from microslip can be expressed as a power series starting from the third order of the magnitude of loading.

The distributed-parameter joint model presented herein can be represented by a parallel-series Iwan model.
