50|$|Open <b>Location</b> <b>Codes</b> {{are a way}} of {{encoding}} location into a {{form that}} is easier to use than providing coordinates in the usual form of latitude and longitude. They {{are designed to be}} used like street addresses, and may be especially useful in places where there is no formal system to identify buildings, such a street names, number, and post codes.|$|E
50|$|On systems where Morse {{code was}} in use {{it was common}} to assign control {{locations}} short identification codes to aid in efficient communication, although wherever signalling control locations are more numerous than mileposts, sequence numbers and codes {{are more likely to}} be employed. Entire rail systems or political areas may adopt a common naming convention. In Central Europe, for example, signalling control points were all issued regionally unique <b>location</b> <b>codes</b> based roughly on the point's location and function, while the American state of Texas sequentially numbered all interlockings for regulatory purposes.|$|E
50|$|Worldwide Geographic <b>Location</b> <b>Codes</b> (GLCs) {{list the}} number and letter codes federal {{agencies}} should use in designating geographic locations anywhere in the United States or abroad in computer programs. Use of standard codes facilitates the interchange of machine-readable data from agency to agency within the federal community and between federal offices {{and state and local}} groups. These codes are also used by some companies as a coding standard as well, especially those that must deal with federal, state and local governments for such things as taxes. The GLCs are administered by the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA).|$|E

50|$|All fares are on AVB {{although}} advance purchase tickets can't be sold as generally these require seat reservations. Only weekly {{season tickets}} can be sold. Monthly and annual prices can be looked up {{by going to}} the season enquiry menu. All types of Railcard discounts, local council discount schemes and other concessions are loaded on to an AVB. Plusbus tickets and rover tickets can also be sold along with certain ferry and bus through ticketing. AVB can handle both CRS station short codes and National <b>Location</b> <b>Codes</b> (NLCs); but if the user does not know either code, typing in the station name will bring the fares up.|$|E
50|$|An RDS-TMC {{receiver}} is {{a special}} FM radio tuner that can decode TMC data. Satellite TMC receivers use a dedicated data channel that is broadcast as part of much larger broadcast digital audio channels. TMC data is decoded by matching event and <b>location</b> <b>codes</b> against look-up tables of phrases and locations. The results can be translated into audio or visually displayed on a Sat nav device. The look-up tables must be implemented in a service-specific database mapped to geographic routes and intersections. As with the navigation systems themselves, periodic upgrades are needed as the road system changes. This provides opportunities for vendors to generate revenue.|$|E
50|$|Open <b>Location</b> <b>Codes</b> {{are derived}} from {{latitude}} and longitude coordinates, so they already exist everywhere. They are similar in length to a telephone number -- 849VCWC8+R9, for example -- but can often be shortened to only four or six digits when combined with a locality (CWC8+R9, Mountain View). Locations {{close to each other}} have similar codes. They can be encoded or decoded offline, and the character set was chosen to avoid spelling words in more than 30 different languages. Similar looking characters are not used to reduce confusion and errors. The Open Location Code is not case-sensitive, and can therefore be easily exchanged over the phone.|$|E
50|$|Each traffic {{incident}} is binary-encoded and sent as a TMC message. Each message {{consists of an}} event <b>code,</b> <b>location</b> <b>code,</b> expected incident duration, affected extent and other details.|$|R

50|$|According to Census 2011 {{information}} the <b>location</b> <b>code</b> or village code of Ganjigatte village is 605625. It {{has a population}} of about 1245 persons living in around 250 households.|$|R
5000|$|After {{consultation}} with ECMT, a combined approach was developed called the ALERT C Protocol that aimed {{to combine the}} best features of each approach. ALERT A and C replaced the CARMINAT message categories cause, effect and advice by a single 11-bit basic message code. This permits up to 2048 basic message phrases to be broadcast. The new ALERT protocols significantly increased the efficiency of message coding, shortening the basic message content from 18 to 11 bits. In conjunction with the revised <b>location</b> <b>codes,</b> which saved 17 of the 33 bits previously assigned, this allowed {{the great majority of}} traffic messages to be broadcast using a single TMC data sequence. In 1991, ECMT recommended moving forward with further testing of the protocols. [...] The work continued with a larger consortium including Volvo and Ford in the European Commission's DRIVE II project ATT-ALERT.|$|E
50|$|A major {{question}} {{addressed in}} the Alert A scheme was {{the total number of}} traffic event locations to be coded. Initial estimates suggested that, in Europe, a maximum of 65,000 significant junctions might be needed for the Federal Republic of Germany. An efficient coding system would require only 16 bits to code these, simply by numbering each intersection from 1 to 65535. Calculations for France, Britain and elsewhere suggested that around 30,000 to 40,000 locations should be enough for most European national or U.S. statewide systems. A standard 16-bit location code was, therefore, adopted for inter-urban networks. The Madrid proposal of 1987, by comparison, had required 33 bits to code problem location, with separate fields for road number, road class, area of the country, etc. These 33 bits gave a theoretical total of 8.5 billion <b>location</b> <b>codes,</b> most of which could never be used.|$|E
30|$|For {{comparison}} purposes, {{all cases}} of primary small cell lung cancer (SCLC) were identified {{during the same}} study period. These cases were identified using <b>location</b> <b>codes</b> C 340 -C 343 and C 348 respectively. SCLC patients were further classified as having localized, regional, and distant disease based on SEER summary stage.|$|E

40|$|An {{alphanumeric}} {{interior and}} exterior <b>location</b> <b>coding</b> system for elements of the Space Station is presented as an aid in identifying specific locations aboard the Station and possibly in locating specific items of loose equipment stowed in these locations. Past experience with long-duration missions has demonstrated the difficulty of tracking loose equipment aboard spacecraft. Inasmuch as over 50, 000 items of loose equipment must be accounted for aboard Space Station Freedom {{there is a high}} potential for continuing difficulties in this area. It is shown that the alphanumeric <b>location</b> <b>coding</b> system described is simple, logical, and easy to use...|$|R
