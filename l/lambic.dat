5|$|<b>Lambic,</b> a beer of Belgium, is {{naturally}} fermented using wild yeasts, rather than cultivated. Many {{of these are}} not strains of brewer's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and may have significant differences in aroma and sourness. Yeast varieties such as Brettanomyces bruxellensis and Brettanomyces lambicus are common in lambics. In addition, other organisms such as Lactobacillus bacteria produce acids which contribute to the sourness.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lambic</b> {{is a type}} of beer brewed in the Pajottenland {{region of}} Belgium {{southwest}} of Brussels and in Brussels itself at the Cantillon Brewery. <b>Lambic</b> beers include gueuze and kriek <b>lambic.</b> <b>Lambic</b> differs from most other beers in that it is fermented through exposure to wild yeasts and bacteria native to the Zenne valley, as opposed to exposure to carefully cultivated strains of brewer's yeast. This process gives the beer its distinctive flavour: dry, , and cidery, usually with a sour aftertaste.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lambic</b> {{with the}} {{addition}} of raspberry (framboise), peach (pêche), blackcurrant (cassis), grape (druif), or strawberry (aardbei), as either whole fruit or syrup. Other, rarer fruit <b>lambic</b> flavorings include apple (pomme), banana (banane), pineapple (ananas), apricot (abricot), plum (prune), cloudberry (plaquebière), lemon (citron), and blueberry (myrtille). Fruit lambics are usually bottled with secondary fermentation. Although fruit lambics are among the most famous Belgian fruit beers, the use of names such as kriek, framboise or frambozen, cassis, etc. does not necessarily imply that the beer is made from <b>lambic.</b> The fruit beers produced by the Liefmans Brewery, for example, use an oud bruin, rather than a <b>lambic</b> as a base.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lambics,</b> beers {{originating}} in Belgium, though copied by brewers {{in other parts}} of the world, may be fermented with cherries to make kriek, or fermented with raspberries to make framboise. There are <b>lambics</b> and oud bruins which have fruit or fruit syrup added after fermentation as a flavouring; these may be termed fruit <b>lambics</b> or fruit beers.|$|R
50|$|Belgian beer {{is usually}} {{packaged}} in 330 ml bottles in four or six packs, or in 750 ml bottles {{similar to those}} used for Champagne. Some beers, usually <b>lambics</b> and fruit <b>lambics</b> are also bottled in 375 ml servings.|$|R
25|$|A {{mixture of}} young (one-year-old) and old (two- and three-year-old) <b>lambics</b> {{that have been}} bottled. Because the young <b>lambics</b> are not yet fully fermented, it {{undergoes}} secondary fermentation in the bottle and produces carbon dioxide. A gueuze {{will be given a}} year to carbonate in the bottle, but can be kept for 10–20 years.|$|R
25|$|<b>Lambic</b> {{production}} is generally sanctioned and promoted by HORAL.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the regular selection of Belgian beer, the famous <b>lambic</b> style of beer is predominately brewed in and around Brussels, and the yeasts {{have their origin in}} the Senne valley. Kriek, a cherry <b>lambic,</b> enjoys outstanding popularity, as it does in the rest of Belgium. Kriek is available in almost every bar or restaurant.|$|E
25|$|The word <b>lambic</b> is {{probably}} derived from Lembeek, a municipality near Halle, Belgium.|$|E
50|$|Lactic acid is a {{component}} {{in the production of}} sour beers, including <b>Lambics</b> and Berliner Weisses.|$|R
50|$|Lindemans Brewery (Brouwerij Lindemans) is a Belgian family brewery {{based in}} Vlezenbeek, {{a small town}} in the Flemish Brabant {{southwest}} of Brussels. It produces <b>lambics.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{dominant}} {{types of}} yeast {{used to make}} beer are the top-fermenting Saccharomyces cerevisiae and bottom-fermenting Saccharomyces pastorianus. Brettanomyces ferments <b>lambics,</b> and Torulaspora delbrueckii ferments Bavarian weissbier.|$|R
25|$|Closer to Gambrinus' home, Cantillon Brewery of Brussels brews {{a highly}} rated framboise <b>lambic</b> called Rosé de Gambrinus.|$|E

25|$|After the {{fermentation}} process starts, the <b>lambic</b> is siphoned into old port wine or sherry barrels (of chestnut or oak) from Portugal or Spain. Some brewers prefer used wine barrels. The <b>lambic</b> {{is left to}} ferment and mature for one or several years. It forms a velo de flor of yeast that gives some protection from oxidation, {{in a similar way}} to vin jaune and sherry; the barrels are not topped up.|$|E
50|$|Sour beer is beer {{which has}} an {{intentionally}} acidic, tart or sour taste. The most common sour beer styles are Belgian: <b>lambics,</b> gueuze and Flanders red ale.|$|R
50|$|Neuhaus, an {{international}} exporter of fine Belgian chocolate, {{is based in}} Sint-Pieters-Leeuw, as well as Lindemans Brewery, a brewery that produces <b>lambics,</b> a distinctly Belgian type of beer.|$|R
5000|$|Since gueuze {{is made by}} {{blending}} <b>lambics,</b> {{it tastes}} different from traditional ale and lager style beers. Because aged hops are used to produce these <b>lambics,</b> the beer has little to none of the traditional hop flavor and aroma {{that can be found}} in most other styles of beer. Furthermore, the wild yeasts that are specific to lambic-style beers give gueuze a dry, cider-like, musty, sour, acetic acid, lactic acid taste. Many describe the taste as sour and [...] "barnyard-like". Because of its carbonation, gueuze is sometimes called [...] "Brussels Champagne".|$|R

25|$|<b>Lambic</b> refermented in the {{presence}} of sour cherries (usually the morello variety) and with secondary fermentation in the bottle results in kriek. Traditional versions of kriek are dry and sour, just as traditional gueuze.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{non-traditional}} fruit beers {{derived from}} <b>lambic</b> that were commercialized {{in the last}} decades {{are considered to be}} low quality products by many beer enthusiasts. These products are typically artificially sweetened, artificially carbonated, sterilized, and based on syrups instead of whole fruit.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the role}} of yeast in {{fermentation}} was understood, fermentation involved wild or airborne yeasts. A few styles such as <b>lambics</b> rely on this method today, but most modern fermentation adds pure yeast cultures.|$|R
50|$|Lactobacilli, {{especially}} L. casei and L. brevis, {{are some}} of the most common beer spoilage organisms. They are, however, essential to the production of sour beers such as Belgian <b>lambics</b> and American wild ales, giving the beer a distinct tart flavor.|$|R
50|$|Beers are {{sometimes}} aged in barrels {{to achieve a}} variety of effects in the final product. Sour beers such as <b>lambics</b> are fully fermented in wood (usually oak) barrels {{similar to those used}} to ferment wine, usually including microflora other than Saccharomyces cerevisiae.|$|R
25|$|Unblended <b>lambic</b> is a cloudy, uncarbonated, bracingly sour {{beverage}} that {{is rarely}} available on tap. Draught releases are {{generally regarded as}} either jonge (young) or oude (old), depending on age and discretion of the brewer. Bottled offerings from Cantillon and De Cam can be found outside Belgium.|$|E
25|$|Serving as {{the centre}} of {{administration}} for Belgium and Europe, Brussels' economy is largely service-oriented. It is dominated by regional and world headquarters of multinationals, by European institutions, by various local and federal administrations, and by related services companies, though {{it does have a}} number of notable craft industries, such as the Cantillon Brewery, a <b>lambic</b> brewery, founded in 1900.|$|E
25|$|The sugar was {{originally}} added shortly before serving, and therefore did not add carbonation or alcohol to the beverage, as the sugar {{did not have}} the time to ferment. Modern faro beer is still characterized by the use of brown sugar and <b>lambic,</b> but is not always a light beer. The use of meertsbier has disappeared, and modern faro is not viewed as cheap or light. Today, faro is bottled, sweetened, and pasteurized to prevent refermentation in the bottle. Examples are produced by Cantillon, Boon, Lindemans or Mort Subite.|$|E
50|$|A vessel {{similar to}} a {{champagne}} flute is the preferred serving vessel for Belgian <b>lambics</b> and fruit beers. The narrow shape helps maintain carbonation, while providing a strong aromatic front. Flute glasses display the lively carbonation, sparkling color, and soft lacing of this distinct style.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the limited}} {{availability}} of sour cherries from Schaerbeek, the traditional ingredient for kriek, Lindemans Kriek is made using unsweetened cherry juice which is added to a mixture of <b>lambics</b> of different ages. The resulting beer is described as less sour and more fruity. It contains 4.0% ABV.|$|R
50|$|Vlezenbeek is a {{small town}} of 3,324 in the Flemish Brabant {{southwest}} of Brussels, Belgium. It is part of the municipality Sint-Pieters-Leeuw. It is the home of Neuhaus, an international exporter of fine Belgian chocolate, as well as Lindemans Brewery, a brewery that produces <b>lambics,</b> a distinctly Belgian type of beer.|$|R
25|$|<b>Lambic</b> {{is usually}} a blend {{of at least two}} {{different}} beers; many producers are blenders who buy beer from other brewers and blend them together to create the desired result. A gueuze may have occupied space in several different cellars over six years or more. While those outside Belgium are likely to find bottled gueuze and fruited versions, a wider variety of styles is available to local drinkers. Beers are often blended again or sweetened with sugar or flavoured syrups before drinking as some can be extremely tart.|$|E
25|$|In some sectors brewers are {{reluctant}} to embrace new technology for fear of losing the traditional characteristics of their beer. For example, Marston's Brewery in Burton on Trent still uses open wooden Burton Union sets for fermentation {{in order to maintain}} the quality and flavour of its beers, while Belgium's <b>lambic</b> brewers go so far as to expose their brews to outside air in order to pick up the natural wild yeasts which ferment the wort. Traditional brewing techniques protect the beer from oxidation by maintaining a carbon dioxide blanket over the wort as it ferments into beer.|$|E
25|$|The beer is {{generally}} brewed from a grist containing approximately 60–70% barley malt and 30–40% unmalted wheat. The wort is cooled overnight in a shallow, flat metal pan called a coolship {{where it is}} left exposed to the open air so microorganisms may inoculate the wort. While this cooling method of open air exposure is a critical feature of the style, the key yeasts and bacteria that perform the fermentation reside within the breweries' timber fermenting vessels. Over eighty microorganisms {{have been identified in}} <b>lambic</b> beer, the most significant being Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces pastorianus and Brettanomyces bruxellensis. The process {{is generally}} only possible between October and May as in the summer months there are too many unfavourable organisms in the air that could spoil the beer.|$|E
50|$|While most {{commonly}} used for sparkling wines, flutes are also used for certain beers, especially fruit beers and Belgian <b>lambics</b> and gueuzes. The flute shows off the beer's color, and helps gather the aroma for the nose. The champagne flute is distinguished from the pilsner glass, which lacks a stem.|$|R
50|$|Yeast is the {{microorganism}} that {{is responsible}} for fermentation in beer. Yeast metabolises the sugars extracted from grains, which produces alcohol and carbon dioxide, and thereby turns wort into beer. In addition to fermenting the beer, yeast influences the character and flavour.The dominant types of yeast used to make beer are Saccharomyces cerevisiae, known as ale yeast, and Saccharomyces pastorianus, known as lager yeast; Brettanomyces ferments <b>lambics,</b> and Torulaspora delbrueckii ferments Bavarian weissbier. Before the role of yeast in fermentation was understood, fermentation involved wild or airborne yeasts, and a few styles such as <b>lambics</b> still use this method today. Emil Christian Hansen, a Danish biochemist employed by the Carlsberg Laboratory, developed pure yeast cultures which were introduced into the Carlsberg brewery in 1883, and pure yeast strains are now the main fermenting source used worldwide.|$|R
25|$|Modern breweries now brew {{many types}} of beer, ranging from ancient styles such as the spontaneously-fermented <b>lambics</b> of Belgium; the lagers, dark beers, wheat beers and more of Germany; the UK's stouts, milds, pale ales, bitters, golden ale and new modern American creations such as chili beer, cream ale, and double India pale ales.|$|R
