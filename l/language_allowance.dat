50|$|France 2 {{opened an}} online {{submission}} form on 13 September 2016 {{that called for}} submissions from artists and songwriters for the internal selection of the French Eurovision Song Contest 2017 entry. The submission period remained open until 30 November 2016. Francophone performers between 16 and 50 {{years of age and}} of any nationality were eligible for consideration, while songs were required to contain at least 80% French language lyrics with a free <b>language</b> <b>allowance</b> for the remaining lyrics. Songwriters and artists could either apply individually or together; artists that applied individually might have been matched with a song or a song that had been submitted without an attached artist. Between 30 November 2016 and 10 March 2017, the artistic committee of France Télévisions reviewed the received submissions and selected an artist and song to represent France in Kiev. At the end of the submission period, it was revealed that around 300 songs had been received.|$|E
40|$|A brief {{introduction}} to acronyms is given and motivation for extracting {{them in a}} digital library environment is discussed. A technique for extracting acronyms is given with {{an analysis of the}} results. The technique is found to have a low number of false negatives and a high number of false positives. Introduction Digital library research seeks to build tools to enable access of content, while making as few as possible assumptions about the content, since assumptions limit the range of applicability of the tools. Generally, the broader the assumptions the more widely applicable the tools. For example, keyword based indexing [5] is based on communications theory and applies to all natural human textual <b>languages</b> (<b>allowances</b> for differences in character sets and similar localisation issues not withstanding). The algorithm described in this paper makes much stronger assumptions about the content. It assumes textual content that contains acronyms, an assumption which is known to hold for [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Argument of {{some kind}} {{is central to the}} process of {{achieving}} a rational result. Contested validity claims are thematised and attempts are then made to vindicate or criticise them in a systematic and rigorous way. This may seem to favour verbal <b>language,</b> but <b>allowance</b> is also given for 'practical discourses' in which claims to normative rightness are made thematic and pragmatically tested. Non-verbal forms of cultural expression could often fall into this category.|$|R
40|$|A {{new project}} is {{underway}} to improve mathematical learning by Indigenous students in Western Australia's east Kimberley region. Six schools are taking part, all based in self-governing Indigenous communities. The project uses a learning model {{that was developed}} by Stanford University for use with disadvantaged low-performing students in the USA adapted to the Australian Indigenous context. It combines high-quality, challenging mathematics content, group work, use of the students' home <b>language</b> and <b>allowance</b> for different learning styles.

40|$|Academic {{treatments}} of distributive justice normally adopt a static approach centred on resource allocation among {{a set of}} individual agents. The resulting models, expressed in mathematical <b>language,</b> make no <b>allowance</b> for culture, as they never engage with the society’s way of life or the moulding of individuals within society. This paper compares the static approach to distributive justice with a cultural one, arguing that a case for redistribution should rest upon its cultural effects in assisting well-being and social cohesion. Unless we recognise culture, we can have little understanding of why inequalities matter, where they come from, and how they might be reduced. Redistribution may be motivated by universal value judgements taken from external sources, but it also entails internal cultural changes that refashion social relations through cumulative causation. In practical terms, it has to penetrate beyond reallocating resource endowments to bring revised attitudes in a society less tolerant of unequal outcomes. Egalitarian reforms will flourish only if they generate and reflect an egalitarian culture...|$|R
