5|$|On May 10, {{the twin}} villages of Gahar and Gadafa in Wadi Hirran, where Prince Mohamed bin Mohsin was in command, were gas bombed, {{killing at least}} seventy-five. The Red Cross was alerted and on June 2, it issued a {{statement}} in Geneva expressing concern. The Institute of Forensic Medicine at the University of Berne made a statement, based on a Red Cross report, that the gas was {{likely to have been}} halogenous derivatives – phosgene, mustard gas, <b>lewisite,</b> chlorine or cyanogen bromide. The gas attacks stopped for three weeks after the Six-Day War of June, but resumed on July, against all parts of royalist Yemen. Casualty estimates vary, and an assumption, considered conservative, is that the mustard and phosgene-filled aerial bombs caused approximately 1,500 fatalities and 1,500 injuries.|$|E
25|$|Phenyldichloroarsine {{is one of}} four organic arsenicals, {{the other}} three are <b>lewisite</b> (L), methyldichloroarsine (MD), and ethyldichloroarsine (ED). PD is {{considered}} an analog of <b>lewisite.</b> At its freezing point, -20°C, PD becomes a microcrystalline solid mass. The compound has a C-metalloid bond between the phenyl group and the arsenic and two covalent bonds between the arsenic and the chlorine.|$|E
25|$|In World War I, the U.S. {{had its own}} {{chemical}} weapons program, which produced its own chemical munitions, including phosgene and mustard gas. The U.S. only created about 4% of the total {{chemical weapons}} produced for that war and just over 1% of the era's most effective weapon, mustard gas. (U.S. troops suffered less than 6% of gas casualties.) Although the U.S. had begun a large-scale production of <b>Lewisite,</b> for use in an offensive planned for early 1919, <b>Lewisite</b> was not deployed during World War I. The United States also created a special unit, the 1st Gas Regiment, which used phosgene in attacks after being deployed to France.|$|E
50|$|Senators DeWitt Clinton (Southern D.), Joshua H. Brett (Middle D.) and John Tayler (Eastern D.) were re-elected. Robert Williams (Middle D.), Isaac Kellogg, John McLean, Charles Selden (all three Eastern D.); and Assemblyman Alexander Rea (Western D.) {{were also}} elected to full {{terms in the}} Senate. William Floyd (Western D.) was elected to fill the vacancy. Brett and Williams were <b>Lewisites,</b> the other seven were Clintonians.|$|R
50|$|The State {{election}} was held from April 29 to May 1, 1806. Senators James Burt (Middle D.) and Jacob Snell (Eastern D.) were re-elected. Jonathan Ward (Southern D.), Elisha Barlow (Middle D.), John Ballard, Salmon Buell, Jacob Gebhard and Nathan Smith (all four Western D.) were also {{elected to the}} Senate. Assemblyman Benjamin Coe (Southern D.) was elected to fill the vacancy. Burt, Barlow and Snell were <b>Lewisites,</b> the other six were Clintonians.|$|R
5000|$|He {{served as}} {{governor}} of New York from 1804 to 1807, defeating Vice President Aaron Burr {{in the race to}} succeed future vice president George Clinton as governor. In the New York gubernatorial election, 1804, he was largely responsible for splitting the Jeffersonian Republican Party in New York into [...] "Lewisites" [...] (allies of Lewis) and the [...] "Clintonians" [...] (allies of New York Mayor DeWitt Clinton) with his combination of <b>Lewisites</b> (labeled [...] "Quids" [...] by the Clintonians) and Federalists.|$|R
25|$|Each of the CAIS held {{between one}} and five {{different}} chemical agents. The agents used in CAIS were phosgene, adamsite, <b>lewisite,</b> cyanogen chloride, chloroacetophenone, sarin, nitrogen mustard, sulfur mustard and chloropicrin. In addition, triphosgene, a phosgene simulant, and ethyl malonate, a tabun simulant were also used. Sarin was the only nerve agent used in CAIS.|$|E
25|$|According to historians Yoshiaki Yoshimi and Kentaro Awaya, {{during the}} Second Sino-Japanese War, gas weapons, such as tear gas, were used only {{sporadically}} in 1937, but in early 1938 the Imperial Japanese Army began full-scale use of phosgene, chlorine, <b>Lewisite</b> and nausea gas (red), and from mid-1939, mustard gas (yellow) was used against both Kuomintang and Communist Chinese troops.|$|E
25|$|After World War I, the United States built a {{stockpile}} of 20,000 tonnes of weaponized <b>lewisite</b> (ClCH=CHAsCl2), a vesicant (blister agent) and lung irritant. The stockpile was neutralized with bleach and {{dumped into the}} Gulf of Mexico in the 1950s. During the Vietnam War, the United States used Agent Blue, a mixture of sodium cacodylate and its acid form, {{as one of the}} rainbow herbicides to deprive North Vietnamese soldiers of foliage cover and rice.|$|E
50|$|At {{this time}} the major {{political}} controversy was the Embargo Act of 1807 which {{was supported by the}} Democratic-Republicans, but opposed by the Federalists. Most of the <b>Lewisites</b> eventually supported the Embargo, but assailed DeWitt Clinton in the press because he had originally opposed it. The Embargo was very unpopular and led to a revival of the Federalist Party which had been reduced to a small minority (without any member in the Senate from 1806 to 1808), but at the State election in April 1809 would already win a majority of the Assembly seats.|$|R
5000|$|The {{incumbent}} U.S. Senator John Smith ran {{for re-election}} {{as the candidate}} of the Democratic-Republican Party. At this time the Democratic-Republican Party was split in two factions: the [...] "Lewisites" [...] (allies of Governor Morgan Lewis), and the [...] "Clintonians" [...] (allies of Mayor of New York DeWitt Clinton). The Federalist Party which had only small minorities {{in both houses of}} the State Legislature was allied in State politics with the <b>Lewisites,</b> the smaller faction, thus forming a bloc large enough to outvote the Clintonians. Nevertheless, for the election of a U.S. Senator both Democratic-Republican factions united supporting Smith.|$|R
5000|$|In 1805, the 28th Legislature had {{chartered}} the Merchant's Bank of New York {{which had}} been founded by Federalists in competition to the Democratic-Republican Bank of the Manhattan Company. The Democratic-Republican majority of the 27th Legislature had not only refused to grant a charter, but actually ordered the Merchant's Bank to shut down by May 1805. During the next session, the bank bribed enough legislators to have the charter approved, although the Democratic-Republican leaders advocated strongly against it. Gov. Morgan Lewis spoke {{out in favor of}} granting the charter what was resented by the party leaders DeWitt Clinton and Ambrose Spencer, and soon led to the split of the party into [...] "Lewisites" [...] and [...] "Clintonians". The 30th Legislature had a Lewisite-Federalist majority and elected a Council of Appointment which removed most Clintonian office-holders. The <b>Lewisites</b> and the Federalists nominated Gov. Morgan Lewis for re-election and Thomas Storm as his running mate. The Clintonians nominated Supreme Court Justice Daniel D. Tompkins for governor, and the incumbent Lt. Gov. John Broome for re-election.|$|R
25|$|Although {{all major}} combatants stockpiled {{chemical}} weapons during the Second World War, the only reports of {{its use in}} the conflict were the Japanese use of relatively small amounts of mustard gas and <b>lewisite</b> in China, and very rare occurrences in Europe (for example some sulfur mustard bombs were dropped on Warsaw on 3 September 1939, which Germany acknowledged in 1942 but indicated had been accidental). Mustard gas was the agent of choice, with the British stockpiling 40,719 tons, the Soviets 77,400 tons, the Americans over 87,000 tons and the Germans 27,597 tons. The destruction of an American cargo ship containing mustard gas led to many casualties in Bari, Italy, in December 1943.|$|E
25|$|When the United States {{entered the}} war, {{it was already}} mobilizing {{resources}} from academic, industry and military sectors {{for research and development}} into poison gas. A Subcommittee on Noxious Gases was created by the National Research Committee, a major research center was established at Camp American University, and the 1st Gas Regiment was recruited. The 1st Gas Regiment eventually served in France, where it used phosgene gas in a number of attacks. The Artillery used Mustard gas with significant effect during the Meuse Argonne Offensive on at least three occasions. The United States began large-scale production of an improved vesicant gas known as <b>Lewisite,</b> for use in an offensive planned for early 1919. By the time of the armistice on 11 November, a plant near Willoughby, Ohio was producing 10 tons per day of the substance, for a total of about 150 tons. It is uncertain what effect this new chemical would have had on the battlefield, however, as it degrades in moist conditions.|$|E
500|$|Following the United States {{declaration}} of war on Germany, Conant was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the [...] U.S. Army Sanitary Corps on September 22, 1917. He went to the Camp American University, where {{he worked on the}} development of poison gases. Initially, his work concentrated on mustard gas, but in May 1918 Conant took charge of a unit concerned with the development of <b>lewisite.</b> He was promoted to major on July 20, 1918. A pilot plant was built, and then a full-scale production plant in Cleveland, but the war ended before <b>lewisite</b> could be used in battle.|$|E
2500|$|At {{various times}} between September 1939 and April 1945, many {{experiments}} were conducted at Sachsenhausen, Natzweiler, and other camps {{to investigate the}} most effective treatment of wounds caused by mustard gas. Test subjects were deliberately exposed [...] to mustard gas and other vesicants (e.g. <b>Lewisite)</b> which inflicted severe chemical burns. The victims' wounds were then tested {{to find the most}} effective treatment for the mustard gas burns.|$|E
2500|$|The agency also {{announced}} {{the renovation of}} underground emergency shelters. Gas masks are effective against some chemical agents, but not against blister agents such as mustard gas, <b>Lewisite,</b> and Phosgene oxime, which North Korea {{is thought to have}} in its stockpiles. In October 2013, South Korea and the United States [...] "agreed to build a joint surveillance system to detect biochemical agents along the demilitarized zone" [...] and to share information.|$|E
2500|$|A large {{variety of}} organoarsenic {{compounds}} are known. Several were developed as chemical warfare agents during World War I, including vesicants such as <b>lewisite</b> and vomiting agents such as adamsite. Cacodylic acid, {{which is of}} historic and practical interest, arises from the methylation of arsenic trioxide, a reaction that has no analogy in phosphorus chemistry. Indeed, cacodyl was the first organometallic compound known, and was named from the Greek κακωδἰα [...] "stink" [...] for its offensive odor; like all arsenic compounds, it is very poisonous.|$|E
5000|$|Operation Geranium {{occurred}} from 15 [...] - [...] 20 December 1948 {{and involved}} the dumping of approximately 3,150 tons of stockpiled <b>lewisite</b> into the Atlantic Ocean. [...] "Geranium" [...] was so called because <b>lewisite</b> has an odor reminiscent of geraniums. The materials dumped {{consisted of two}} types of bulk container, 60 were of the M14 variety, and another 3,700 bulk containers were dumped as well. The <b>lewisite</b> was shipped to Charleston from the Gulf Chemical Warfare Depot. The <b>lewisite</b> was then loaded aboard a World War II merchant ship, the SS Joshua Alexander. The <b>lewisite</b> was then dumped, at sea, 300 {{miles off the coast}} of Florida.|$|E
50|$|From one acute exposure, {{someone who}} has inhaled <b>lewisite</b> can develop chronic {{respiratory}} disease; eye exposure to <b>lewisite</b> can cause permanent visual impairment or blindness.|$|E
50|$|Those {{exposed to}} <b>lewisite</b> can develop {{refractory}} hypotension (low blood pressure) known as <b>Lewisite</b> shock, {{as well as}} some features of arsenic toxicity. <b>Lewisite</b> causes physical damage to capillaries, which then become leaky, meaning that there is not enough blood volume to maintain blood pressure, a condition called hypovolemia. When the blood pressure is low, the kidneys may not receive enough oxygen and can be damaged.|$|E
50|$|Sea dumping {{was used}} by the U.S. Army to dispose of World War II <b>lewisite</b> stocks prior to Geranium. One such dumping {{operation}} was reported on by The New York Times in 1946, 10,000 tons of <b>lewisite</b> was dumped about 160 miles off the Charleston, South Carolina coast. Before Operation Geranium, however, <b>lewisite</b> dumping was mostly accomplished by simply dropping loose munitions overboard. In this operation, the Army loaded the merchant hulk with the <b>lewisite</b> containers, sailed the vessel out to sea and then scuttled the ship with the muntions aboard. Most of the 20,000 tons of <b>lewisite</b> produced during World War II by the U.S. was disposed of by dumping at sea. This method of operation and disposal was not used again for some time, though the Army did employ it again.|$|E
50|$|It is {{possible}} that <b>Lewisite</b> may be a carcinogen since arsenic is categorized as a respiratory carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, though {{it has not been}} confirmed that <b>lewisite</b> is a carcinogen.|$|E
50|$|Producing or {{stockpiling}} <b>lewisite</b> {{was banned}} by the Chemical Weapons Convention. When the convention entered force in 1997, the parties declared world-wide stockpiles of 6,747 tonnes of <b>lewisite.</b> As of December 2015, 98% of these stockpiles had been destroyed.|$|E
5000|$|HL - A {{blend of}} {{distilled}} mustard (HD) and <b>Lewisite</b> (L), originally {{intended for use}} in winter conditions due to its lower freezing point compared to the pure substances. The <b>Lewisite</b> component of HL {{was used as a}} form of antifreeze.|$|E
50|$|British anti-lewisite, {{also called}} dimercaprol, is the {{antidote}} for <b>lewisite.</b> It can be injected to prevent systemic toxicity, {{but will not}} prevent injury to the skin, eyes, or mucous membranes. Chemically, dimercaprol binds to the arsenic in <b>lewisite.</b> It is contraindicated in those with peanut allergies.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lewisite</b> {{was first}} {{synthesised}} in 1904 by Julius Arthur Nieuwland during studies for his PhD. Within his doctoral thesis he described a reaction between acetylene and arsenic trichloride, {{which led to}} the formation of <b>lewisite.</b> Exposure to the resulting compound made Nieuwland so ill he was hospitalized for a number of days.|$|E
5000|$|After World War I, the US became {{interested}} in <b>lewisite</b> {{because it was not}} flammable. It had the military symbol of [...] "M1" [...] up into World War II, when it was changed to [...] "L". Field trials with <b>lewisite</b> during World War II demonstrated that casualty concentrations were not achievable under high humidity due to its rate of hydrolysis and its characteristic odor and lacrymation forced troops to don masks and avoid contaminated areas. The United States produced about 20,000 tons of <b>lewisite,</b> keeping it on hand primarily as an antifreeze for mustard gas or to penetrate protective clothing in special situations.|$|E
50|$|It's {{also used}} as a {{antidote}} to the chemical weapon <b>Lewisite.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Lewisite</b> is {{a suicide}} {{inhibitor}} of the E3 component of pyruvate dehydrogenase. As an efficient method to produce ATP, pyruvate dehydrogenase {{is involved in}} the conversion of pyruvate to Acetyl-CoA. The latter subsequently enters the TCA cycle. Peripheral nervous system pathology usually arises from <b>Lewisite</b> exposure as the nervous system essentially relies on glucose as its only catabolic fuel.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lewisite</b> (L) is an organoarsenic compound. It {{was once}} {{manufactured}} in the U.S., Japan, and Germany {{for use as a}} chemical weapon, acting as a vesicant (blister agent) and lung irritant. Although colorless and odorless, impure samples of <b>lewisite</b> are a yellow, brown, violet-black, green, or amber oily liquid with a distinctive odor that has been described as similar to geraniums.|$|E
