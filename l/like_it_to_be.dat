Scott cast Hauer without having met him, based solely on Hauer's performances in Paul Verhoeven's movies Scott had seen (Katie Tippel, Soldier of Orange and Turkish Delight). Hauer's portrayal of Batty was regarded by Philip K. Dick as, [...] "the perfect Batty—cold, Aryan, flawless". Of the many films Hauer has made, Blade Runner is his favorite. As he explained in a live chat in 2001, [...] "Blade Runner needs no explanation. It just [...] All of the best. There is nothing <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> <b>To</b> <b>be</b> part of a real masterpiece which changed the world's thinking. It's awesome."

30|$|So the {{creative}} imagination of bhāvana {{is used in}} conjunction with meditative practices prescribed by earlier yogic traditions and complements them. With bhāvana one appropriates into one’s sense of self a kind of feeling-being state that imagines what <b>it’s</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> free of bondage. In some sense this recalls Nagel’s “what <b>it’s</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a bat”, but in this case, rather than bat or wasp, one uses this embodied imagination to tap into what <b>it’s</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a liberated puruṣa, someone free of karma. This feeling into “what <b>it’s</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> x” also entails that this imaginative practice, carries a capacity to mold and transform the body, first the subtle body and then following on this, the physical body. In this respect this is more than mere empathy, feeling what <b>it’s</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> another, bat or person. It entails also an embodied habitus, a whole identity as being in the world which bhāvana addresses and attempts to transform and direct. Just as Nagel’s formulation entails an assumed embodiment, so also does bhāvana, and bhāvana in this case proposes the possibility of transforming this embodiment.|$|R

It was revealed {{at the end of the}} season, that he had played with a small tear in his meniscus, which resulted in post-season surgery. He missed one match for the season after he was suspended for striking [...] captain, Phil Davis, in round 11. The decision by the match review panel was criticised by the Herald Sun chief of football writer, Mark Robinson, where he labelled the decision [...] "a joke", and the backlash forced match review panel member, Nathan Burke to publicly defend the decision. Geelong returned to the final series in 2016, making it to the preliminary final and losing to Sydney by thirty-seven points at the MCG. He finished with twenty-three matches for the season, kicking fifty-five goals and he was Geelong's leading goalkicker for the fifth consecutive season.|$|E

[...] The successful performance earned Hendrix his first interview, published in Record Mirror with the headline: [...] "Mr. Phenomenon".

2500|$|Gilman {{argued that}} women's {{contributions}} to civilization, throughout history, have been halted {{because of an}} androcentric culture. She believed that womankind was the underdeveloped half of humanity, and improvement was necessary to prevent {{the deterioration of the}} human race. Gilman believed economic independence {{is the only thing that}} could really bring freedom for women, and make them equal to men. In 1898 she published Women and Economics, a theoretical treatise which argued, among other things, that women are subjugated by men, that motherhood should not preclude a woman from working outside the home, and that housekeeping, cooking, and child care, would be professionalized. [...] "The ideal woman," [...] Gilman wrote, [...] "was not only assigned a social role that locked her into her home, but she was also expected to <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> cheerful and gay, smiling and good-humored." [...] When the sexual-economic relationship ceases to exist, life on the domestic front would certainly improve, as frustration in relationships often stems from the lack of social contact that the domestic wife has with the outside world.|$|E

The song feels like it was written during the Salem Witch Trials, and it sarcastically takes the religious right wing slang of how all women were treated.
