25|$|What we call {{religious}} {{experiences can}} differ greatly. Some reports exist of supernatural happenings {{that it would}} be difficult to explain from a rational, scientific point of view. On the other hand, there also exist the sort of testimonies that simply seem to convey a feeling of peace or oneness – something which most of us, religious or not, may possibly relate to. In categorizing religious experiences it is perhaps helpful to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> as explicable through one of two theories: the Objectivist thesis or the Subjectivist thesis.|$|E

I <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> as being treated like lab rats that are test vehicles for the doctors. The doctors, the management, the officials, they're the ones that have corrupted riders.

500|$|Dylan {{composed}} {{this song}} {{in the form of}} a 12-bar blues. In the sleeve notes of Freewheelin, Dylan explained to Nat Hentoff: [...] "What made the real blues singers so great is that they were able to state all the problems they had; but at the same time, they were standing outside of them and could <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them.</b> And in that way, they had them beat." [...] Into this song, Dylan injected one explicit mention of an absence that was troubling him: the sojourn of Suze Rotolo in Perugia: [...] "My baby took my heart from me/ She packed it all up in a suitcase/ Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1888 Francis {{developed}} diphtheria {{and died}} on 11 September. Overwhelmed with grief, Pankhurst commissioned two {{portraits of the}} dead boy {{but was unable to}} <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> and hid them in a bedroom cupboard. The family concluded that a faulty drainage system at the back of their house had caused their son's illness. Pankhurst blamed the poor conditions of the neighbourhood, and the family moved to a more affluent middle class district at Russell Square. She was soon pregnant once more and declared that the child was [...] "Frank coming again." [...] She gave birth to a son on 7 July 1889 and named him Henry Francis in honour of his deceased brother.|$|E

The Tech defense featured two highly regarded cornerbacks, Jimmy Williams and Eric Green, who finished the regular season with 50tackles and 31tackles, respectively. Williams also had fourinterceptions (the most on the team), including one returned for a touchdown, and was named first-team All-ACC. Green, meanwhile, had one interception. Auburn wide receiver Courtney Taylor praised the two players highly in an interview before the game, saying, [...] "Those cornerbacks are amazing to me every time I <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them.</b> I think, 'God, those guys are very athletic.'

500|$|Bellerophon {{anchored}} off Brixham on {{the morning}} of 24 July, and there Maitland received orders from Admiral Lord Keith to [...] "prevent every person whatever from coming on board the ship you command, except the officers and men who compose her crew." [...] Despite turning away the shore boats which approached the anchored warship bringing fresh bread and fruit to sell, word eventually leaked out that Napoleon was aboard the ship. The news created a sensation, and large numbers of boats filled with sightseers soon surrounded the ship. Occasionally Napoleon would come out to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> but despite entreaties from some people to be allowed on board, Maitland refused to allow any contact between ship and shore. On 26 July Bellerophon received orders to proceed to Plymouth harbour where Lord Keith was anchored aboard his flagship [...] Napoleon remained on board Bellerophon and the ship was kept isolated from the throngs of curious sightseers by two guardships, [...] and , anchored close at hand.|$|E

Asked to specify which expenditures he would eliminate, Bevin said, [...] "I'm {{not going to give you}} specifics at this point in time.

500|$|Garrett {{initially}} wrote [...] "Soldier" [...] {{in a taxi}} while {{going to}} the studio where the band worked on Destiny Fulfilled; he sang the hook to the members afterwards and they liked it. Garrett further revealed about his collaboration with the group, [...] "I loved how Destiny's Child evolved and became this really incredible pop group but I wanted to introduce them to the hood {{from the perspective of}} having the world <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> in a different way... What was great about that was they all liked guys from the streets. Each verse was a representation of the guy they were actually into." [...] During an interview with MTV News, Rowland said that with [...] "Soldier" [...] each member wanted to talk about their preference for a man during their solo verses, the place where he lives and his physical appearance.

500|$|Most of {{the lyrics}} in Foo Fighters are {{nonsensical}} lines written by Grohl in the 20 minutes before recording began. As the frontman, Grohl explained, [...] "I had seven days to record fifteen songs. I was just concentrating on everything being as together as possible, having everything be tight and in sync. There wasn't too much time spent {{sitting in a chair}} thinking." [...] Grohl would add that the gibberish was deliberate, given that, [...] "there was too much to say," [...] following Cobain's death and, [...] "a lot of emphasis placed on the meaning of the first Foo Fighters album." [...] Grohl still considered that [...] "the things you write down spur of the moment are most revealing. Now I <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> and some of them seem to actually have meaning", and revealed that a few songs have lyrics inspired by [...] "personal experiences of {{the last four or five}} years", with the standout being [...] "Big Me", an [...] "out-and-out love song" [...] to Grohl's then-wife Jennifer Youngblood that he described as his favorite track on the album. Contrasting with the aggressive and rebellious themes of Nirvana, Grohl had positive and cheery tunes such as [...] "This Is a Call", defined as [...] "a 'hello' and a 'thank you'" [...] to everyone that had played a key role in Grohl's life; the playful [...] "For All the Cows"; and [...] "Wattershed", with a title referencing Mike Watt and lyrics that described Grohl's [...] "love of hardcore and old school punk rock".|$|E
500|$|A proclamation: In {{the markets}} {{of the city}} the profits from {{commerce}} are monopolized by itinerant loiterers, while the little people from the rural villages {{are not allowed to}} sell their wares. There is not a single necessity of our clothing or food that is not the product of the fields of these old rustics. The men plow and the women weave. Their toil is extremely wearisome, yet what they gain from it is negligible, while manifold interest returns to these lazy idlers. This sort, in tens and hundreds, come together to form gangs. When the villagers come to sell things in the market place, before the goods have even left their hands, this crowd of idlers arrives and attacks them, assaulting them as a group. These idlers call this [...] "the boxing of the community family." [...] They are not at all afraid to act outrageously. I have myself seen that it is like this. Have they not given thought to the foodstuffs they require and the clothing they wear? Is it produced by these people of the marketplaces? Or is it produced by the rural farmers? When they recognize that these goods are produced by the farming people or the rural villages, how can they <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> in anger? How can they bully and insult them? Now, Pan Fifty-two and Li Seven are both fishmongers, but Pan lives in the city and fishmongering is his source of livelihood. Li Seven is a farmer, who does fishmongering between busy times. Pan Fifty-two {{at the end of the}} year has his profit, without having had the labor of raising the fish, but simply earning it from the selling of the fish. He hated Li and fought with him at the fish market. His lack of humanity is extreme! Li Seven is a village rustic. How could he fight with the itinerant armed loiterers who hang around the marketplace? Although no injuries resulted from the fight, we still must mete out some slight punishments. Pan Fifty-two is to be beaten fifteen blows with the heavy rod. In addition, Li Seven, although he is a village farmer, was still verbally abusive while the two men were stubbornly arguing. He clearly is not a man of simple and pure character. He must have done something to provoke this dispute. Li Seven is to be given a suspended sentence of a beating of ten blows, to be carried out if hereafter there are further violations.|$|E
