I was married when I was twenty-four. I got married to lay my hands on the first ten thousand dollars I needed. My wife left me fifteen years ago. You may have read of her. She was a storekeeper's daughter then. She has a flat in Paris now, a country house in England, a villa at Monte Carlo and another at Florence. She lives her life, I <b>live</b> <b>mine.</b> She's the only woman I'd ever spoken a civil word to until I met Elizabeth Dalstan, or since." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "One Life" [...] is an uptempo electro-dance pop song, {{that runs}} {{a length of}} three minutes and 38 seconds. It was written by Nasri Atweh, Hakim Bell, Adam Messinger, Akene [...] "The Champ" [...] Dunkley, and all four group members, {{featuring}} main production by Bell and Dunkley. Atweh and Messinger of The Messengers share a co-production credit on the song. Set in a common time signature of 105 beats per minute, the song follows in the inspirational dance-pop theme of Welcome to the Dance. It is constructed in a verse-pre-chorus-chorus form, with Nadja Benaissa and Sandy Mölling sharing lead vocals. A rapped break before the third chorus, performed by Jessica Wahls, serves as a bridge, involving slight auto-tune effects. The lyrics of [...] "One Life" [...] feature the band members remembering the positive things in life following some tribulation, singing [...] "I only got one life, one life / Tonight I'm gonna <b>live</b> <b>mine,</b> <b>live</b> <b>mine</b> / I'm gonna have a good time, good time / I wanna be free." ...|$|E
50|$|After {{organizing}} the new battalion, training in engineering skills started. The battalion {{average age of}} the enlisted men was 22 years. Then men had {{two and a half months}} of basic training behind. Training included: M1 carbine Rifle marksmanship, mines, minefields, Demining fixed dry gullies bridge construct, floating Pontoon bridge construct, road repair-making, Military engineering vehicles-DUKW use, and other field combat problems. Training include Live fire exercise and <b>live</b> <b>mine</b> exercises, to make the men battle ready. Colonel George S. Patton was in charge of training the new 2nd Armored division.|$|E

Following the decisive Battle of Leyte Gulf, Harris took on board survivors of the gallant fight off Samar between heavy Japanese forces and light U.S. carriers and destroyers. She departed 28 October, arriving Guam 3 days later, and returned to Leyte Gulf with reinforcements. Harris then sailed for Guadalcanal and Bougainville for additional troops and spent December 1944 in landing exercises in Huan Gulf.|$|E
50|$|Back on patrol, {{the platoon}} is {{attacked}} by heavy Vietcong (VC) forces and Parker is hit by mortar fire. Knight calls up his Medic to save Parker, but Parker's wounds are mortal and he dies in Knight's arms. McNamara then arrives with his squad {{and the group}} repels the enemy who retreats towards Sergeant Roach, who carries a shotgun and is considered the platoon's toughest soldier. Roach then kills the remaining VC easily. A week later, Major Flynn gives Knight 3 new replacements including a rebellious Private named Don Pike. Knight finds Pike's demeanor disruptive and sends him to Sergeant Roach's mine sweeping detail. Roach then has Pike hold his trigger finger on a <b>live</b> <b>mine</b> while Roach takes a break to urinate. Later, Knight finds Private Bacera getting high in his barracks when {{he was supposed to}} be leaving on patrol. Knight confronts Bacera and dumps out the drugs he found and personally leads the patrol the next day, keeping a close eye on Bacera. Even so, Bacera sneaks a hit when recusing himself to urinate. Knight finds Bacera expired with a needle still in his arm, having suddenly overdosed, causing Knight to be angry with himself.|$|E
5000|$|The film is {{over nine}} minutes long and depicts a SWAT team driving up to a {{building}} and staging a raid, {{during which they}} ignore a man sitting in a room smoking a crack pipe, beat a couple engaged in coitus, and then force a young red-haired man violently into a detainee transport vehicle. Other red-heads are rounded up. Some of the SWAT team members wear American flags on their uniforms. During the video, a mural is seen depicting armed red-headed men and the slogan [...] "Our day will come", the historic motto of the Irish Republican Army (Tiocfaidh ár lá). Keffiya-wearing red-haired young people throw rocks and glass bottles at the armored vehicles transporting the detainees, in an apparent reference to the iconic images of the Second Palestinian [...] "Intifada". The detainees are then driven out to the desert, treated brutally, and forced to run across a live minefield. During the course of events, a young red-headed boy is shot through the head, and another is blown to pieces after stepping on a <b>live</b> <b>mine</b> while the soldiers continue to chase, beat, and shoot the captives. The [...] "Born Free" [...] film includes graphic violence and language, as well as nudity. Ian Hamrick, the 12-year-old red-haired actor whose character is {{shot in the head}} in the film, described the video as [...] "showing violence to end violence." [...] He felt a potency in the video absent from far more graphic video game media such as Call of Duty or Grand Theft Auto. Giving more details on his role in an interview to the Los Angeles Times, Hamrick said M.I.A. complimented his work on set, stating [...] "She wanted to make sure I was OK, that I knew what was happening and why she killed character.

40|$|The Schedule Optimisation Tool (SOT) is a {{software}} that identifies the sequence (schedule) of mine {{development and the}} ore production activities that maximise the Net Present Value (NPV). A case study exercise in a <b>live</b> <b>mine</b> planning process found that SOT added over a hundred million dollars of value to the orebody. SOT has been enhanced to allow automated generation and evaluation of mine design parameters. The first enhancement allows the automated evaluation of schedules over a range of operational resource constraints. Heuristics {{can be used to}} seed the starting point of the search; for example, by prioritising production from specific stopes based on their mineral grades. The second enhancement allows a user‐specified ranking to be applied as a seeding heuristic. A third enhancement allows automated application of sequencing rules for primary and secondary stopes. SOT provides substantial assistance to the mine planner, allowing for strategic decisions based on a thorough evaluation of mine design parameters...|$|E

The steps taken to integrate the PLC into three main sections covering the PLC being bench tested to full installation on site, this structure also follows the timeline of the project, first reporting on work completed at the office then moves into a software/hardware test at the warehouse and finally full installation on site. Note, this report does not detail the code utilised for {{the inner workings of the}} <b>live</b> <b>mine</b> site as it is against company policy and intellectual property laws, however it will go in-depth into the communications between the system owner, control engineer and technicians, the procedure taken to get the PLC up to a standard for site installation where all parties write off on the final product and the steps done to troubleshoot and communicate any problems found in any of the stages throughout this project...|$|E

50|$|In {{contrast}} {{two hundred}} years earlier St Helens was far more scarred and pitted by shallow mining operations, often quickly abandoned, left to flood and prone to collapse. The primitive mining techniques, and limited ability to pump out water meant many pits had short lifespans.
