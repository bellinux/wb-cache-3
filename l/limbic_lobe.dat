40|$|Aims: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} diabetes mellitus (DM) on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) patterns in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Methods: We investigated the initial rCBF of 71 AD patients (36 without DM and 35 with DM) and the final rCBF of 23 AD patients (12 without DM and 11 with DM) after an average of 32 months. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) data were analyzed by statistical brain imaging. Results: The initial SPECT showed that AD patients without DM had lower rCBF in the left and right inferior temporal gyri than AD patients with DM. A follow-up SPECT demonstrated that rCBF decreased in more widespread regions, including the parietal, temporal, frontal, and <b>limbic</b> <b>lobes,</b> in AD patients without than with DM.

Spindle activity was recorded in 18 healthy volunteers during daytime napping. Because of lack of sleep or excessive artifacts, data from 13 subjects were analyzed off-line. Spindles were visually scored, marked, and bandpass filtered (slow 10 - 12 Hz or fast 12 - 14 Hz). EEG was segmented on the marker, and segments separately averaged. LORETA projected cortical sources on the MNI brain. Maximal intra- and inter-individual intensities were compared using the Wilcoxon test (P<. 05) and cortical sources distribution compared using a χ 2 test. Two to three slow spindles generators were consistently identified in frontal lobes, with additional sources in parietal and <b>limbic</b> <b>lobes</b> in half cases. Fast spindles had multiple temporo-parietal sources, with an inconstant frontal source. Inter-individual (P = 0. 44), and intra-individual (P = 0. 09 slow and P = 0. 10 fast spindles) source intensities were comparable.

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) {{is a complex}} neurodevelopmental condition that occurs within the first 3 years of life, which is marked by social skills and com-munication deficits along with stereotyped repetitive behavior. Although great efforts {{have been made to}} clarify the underlying neuroanatomical abnormalities and brain-behavior relationships in adolescents and adults with ASD, literature is still limited in information about the neurobi-ology of ASD in the early age of life. Brain images of 50 toddlers with ASD and 28 age, gender, and developmental quotient matched toddlers with developmental delay (DD) (control group) between ages 2 and 3 years were captured using combined magnetic resonance-based structural imaging and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Structural magnetic resonance imaging was applied to assess overall gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volumes, and regional alterations were assessed by voxel-based mor-phometry. DTI was used to investigate the white matter tract integrity. Compared with DD, significant increases were observed in ASD, primarily in global GM and WM volumes and in right superior temporal gyrus regional GM and WM volumes. Higher fractional anisotropy value was also observed in the corpus callosum, posterior cingulate cortex, and <b>limbic</b> <b>lobes</b> of ASD. The converging findings of structural and white matter abnormalities in ASD suggest that alterations in neural-anatomy of different brain regions may be involved in behavioral and cognitive defi-cits associated with ASD, especially in an early age of 2 – 3 years old toddlers...|$|R

He presented with memory problems, personality changes, and disorientation. His family history of dementia was probably negative, since no family member with dementia was found or mentioned. Mild cortical atrophy was observed upon magnetic resonance imaging analyses of his brain, and the single-photon emission computed tomography analysis revealed hypoperfusion in the frontal, temporal, and <b>limbic</b> <b>lobes.</b> The patient was tested for mutations in APP, PSEN 1, PSEN 2, PGRN, MAPT, and PRNP genes.

Herein, we present the first case report of PSEN 2 R 62 C mutation in Asia. PolyPhen- 2 and SIFT software analyses predicted this mutation as “possibly damaging”, suggesting its potential involvement with AD. In silico protein structural prediction analyses of PSEN 2 R 62 and C 62 revealed two divergent structures, suggesting that large perturbations of R 62 C mutation might cause dysfunctions of PSEN 2, which may alter the normal amyloid production.

To this end, an auditory 3 -stimulus oddball paradigm {{was used to}} identify P 3 a and P 3 b components, elicited by rare-distractor and rare-target tones, respectively. Event-related potentials (ERP) were recorded from 31 Sz patients and 38 healthy controls. The P 3 a and P 3 b brain-source generators were identified by time-averaging of low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) current density images. In contrast with the commonly used fixed window of interest (WOI), we proposed to apply an adaptive WOI, which takes into account subjects’ P 300 latency variability. Our results showed different P 3 a and P 3 b source activation patterns in both groups. P 3 b sources included frontal, parietal and <b>limbic</b> <b>lobes,</b> whereas P 3 a response generators were localized over bilateral frontal and superior temporal regions. These areas have been related to the discrimination of auditory stimulus and to the inhibition (P 3 a) or the initiation (P 3 b) of motor response in a cognitive task. In addition, differences in source localization between Sz and control groups were observed. Sz patients showed lower P 3 b source activity in bilateral frontal structures and the cingulate. P 3 a generators were less widespread for Sz patients than for controls in right superior, medial and middle frontal gyrus. Our findings suggest that target and distractor processing involves distinct attentional subsystems, both being altered in Sz.

Clinical studies have reported DBS-induced adverse effects on cognitive functions, mood, emotion and behavior. STN DBS seems {{to interfere with the}} limbic functions of the basal ganglia, but the limbic effects of STN DBS are controversial. We measured prospectively resting regional cerebral metabolism (rCMb) with 18 -fluorodeoxyglucose and PET, and resting regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) with HMPAO and SPECT in six patients with Parkinson's disease. We compared PET and SPECT 1 month before and 3 months after STN DBS. On cerebral MRI, 13 regions of interest (ROI) were manually delineated slice by slice in frontal and <b>limbic</b> <b>lobes.</b> We obtained mean rCBF and rCMb values for each ROI and the whole brain. We normalized rCBF and rCMB values to ones for the whole brain volume, which we compared before and following STN DBS. No significant difference emerged in the SPECT analysis. PET analysis revealed a significant decrease in rCMb following STN DBS in the superior frontal gyri and left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (p < 0. 05). A non-significant decrease in rCMb in the left anterior cingulate gyrus appeared following STN DBS (p = 0. 075). Our prospective SPECT and PET study revealed significantly decreased glucose metabolism of the two superior frontal gyri without any attendant perfusion changes following STN DBS. These results suggest that STN DBS may change medial prefrontal function and therefore the integration of limbic information, either by disrupting emotional processes within the STN, or by hampering the normal function of a limbic circuit...|$|R

Cognitive scientists have discovered highly specific and detailed knowledge of musical structure even in individuals without extensive musical training. Brain imaging has proved valuable for investigating the neural basis {{of a variety of}} cognitive functions, including how the brain processes music. These developments converge on page 2167 of this issue with the research article by Janata et al. (1). They report that abstract patterns of Western tonal musical structure are mirrored in patterns of brain activity in human subjects. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, Janata and colleagues analyzed the brain activity of eight musically experienced listeners as they performed two musical perception tasks requiring them to detect a deviance in timbre (a note played by a flute instead of a clarinet) and notes that violated local tonality. The investigators found that the auditory cortex {{as well as a number}} of other brain areas were activated in their subjects as they undertook the musical perception tasks. The most consistent activation was along the superior temporal gyrus of both hemispheres. Additional regions that were activated included the temporal, parietal, frontal, and <b>limbic</b> <b>lobes</b> as well as the thalamus and cerebellum, indicating that the processing of music is extremely complicated. Recent research in neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, and functional brain imaging has investigated the location and properties of auditory cortical fields (2).
