25|$|Having sold several {{first team}} players, Watford used the <b>loan</b> <b>system</b> to sign young players from Premier League clubs, {{offering}} them early experience of competitive football. First to arrive was Tom Cleverley, who scored on his debut and was eventually voted Watford F.C. Player of the Season. Other players acquired {{in this manner}} included his Manchester United teammate Craig Cathcart, and Arsenal midfielder Henri Lansbury. Watford's other significant loan acquisition was former player Heiðar Helguson. The Iceland international made an instant impact on his return to Vicarage Road, scoring two goals as a substitute in a 3–3 draw against Leicester City.|$|E
25|$|By {{the summer}} of 1940, the {{victories}} of Nazi Germany against Poland, Denmark, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands and France brought urgency to the government discreetly preparing for possible United States involvement in World War II. Of principal concern were issues surrounding war financing. Many of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's advisers favored a system of tax increases and enforced savings program as advocated by British economist John Maynard Keynes. In theory, this would permit increased spending while decreasing the risk of inflation. Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, Jr. however preferred a voluntary <b>loan</b> <b>system</b> and began planning a national defense bond program {{in the fall of}} 1940. The intent was to unite the attractiveness of the baby bonds that had been implemented in the interwar period with the patriotic element of the Liberty Bonds from the First World War.|$|E
25|$|The {{companies}} were obligated {{to repay the}} loans to the government, and the money would then be lent out to another group of businesses. This process has continued to this day {{in the guise of}} the state owned KfW bank, (Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau, meaning Reconstruction Credit Institute). The Special Fund, then supervised by the Federal Economics Ministry, was worth over DM 10 billion in 1971. In 1997 it was worth DM 23 billion. Through the revolving <b>loan</b> <b>system,</b> the Fund had by the end of 1995 made low-interest loans to German citizens amounting to around DM 140 billion. The other 40% of the counterpart funds were used to pay down the debt, stabilize the currency, or invest in non-industrial projects. France made the most extensive use of counterpart funds, using them to reduce the budget deficit. In France, and most other countries, the counterpart fund money was absorbed into general government revenues, and not recycled as in Germany.|$|E

25|$|In July 1986 the State Council {{announced}} that the stipend system for university and college students would be replaced with a new scholarship and <b>loan</b> <b>system.</b> The new system, to be tested in selected institutions during the 1986-87 academic year, was designed to help students who could not cover their own living expenses but who studied hard, obeyed state laws, and observed discipline codes. Students eligible for financial aid were {{to apply to the}} schools and the China Industrial and Commercial Bank for low-interest loans. Three categories of students eligible for aid were established: top students encouraged to attain all-around excellence; students specializing in education, agriculture, forestry, sports, and marine navigation; and students willing to work in poor, remote, and border regions or under harsh conditions, such as in mining and engineering. In addition, free tuition and board were to be offered at military school, and the graduates were required to join the army {{for at least five years}} in relevant positions. For those who worked in an approved rural position after graduation, student's loans would be paid off by his or her employer, such as a school, in a lump sum. And the money was to be repaid to the employer by the student through five years of payroll deductions.|$|E
25|$|Under the Fiscal Year 2010 budget resolution, {{the text}} of the {{reconciliation}} bill submitted to the Budget Committee had to have been reported by the relevant Committees by October 15, 2009. Therefore, the Democrats combined {{the text of}} America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 as reported out of the Ways and Means Committee, and as it was reported out of the Education and Labor Committee, and {{the text of the}} Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act as reported out of the Education and Labor Committee. This version was never meant to be passed; it was only created so that the reconciliation bill would comply with the Budget resolution. The bill was automatically amended to the version that was meant to be passed per the special rule that was reported out of the Rules Committee. The Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act was added to the Reconciliation Act as only one reconciliation bill can be passed each budget year, and it also faced a tough road through the Senate due to Republican filibuster and opposition from several centrist Democratic Senators. The move was also thought to give President Obama two key victories in overhauling the health care and student <b>loan</b> <b>system.</b> It also eventually became clear that the budget savings caused by the student loan bill would become essential to the overall reconciliation bill by reducing the deficit enough for the overall bill to qualify for the reconciliation process.|$|E
25|$|In 2010 {{one of the}} {{previous}} season's top scorers Barry Conlon was loaned out to Chesterfield before signing permanently shortly afterwards. Puzzled supporters questioned Woods and chairman John Fenty over the decision which was later revealed to be because the player {{was considered to be}} a disruptive influence and wasn't turning up for training. Woods began to clear out the ranks, with Danny Boshell, Danny North, Jamie Clarke, Barry Conlon and Grant Normington all being released. Whilst Chris Jones was loaned out only months after being signed. Woods began to make some fresh signings, notably Lee Peacock, Tommy Wright and former loanee Dean Sinclair joined the club. Woods would also heavily use the <b>loan</b> <b>system</b> in a bid to change the club's fortunes. On 6 March 2010 Grimsby ended a club record 25 game winless streak by beating promotion chasing Shrewsbury Town at Blundell Park, 3–0. The 25 game streak had last seen Grimsby win in the league with a 2–0 away victory at Torquay United on 19 September 2009. During this time the Mariners had drawn 15 games and lost 10. The game would also come as the first career victory for Neil Woods. The Mariners went on to win four and draw one of their last six games to give them a chance of league survival going into the last game of the season. However, they were defeated 3–0 by Burton Albion, and thus were relegated from the Football League {{for the first time in}} nearly 100 years.|$|E

60|$|We, however, {{remarked that}} there are other {{circumstances}} in which loans are not chargeable with these pernicious consequences: namely, first, when what is borrowed is foreign capital, the overflowings of the general accumulation of the world; or, secondly, when it is capital which either would not have been saved at all, unless this mode of investment had been open to it, or, after being saved, would have been wasted in unproductive enterprises, or sent to seek employment in foreign countries. When the progress of accumulation has reduced profits either to the ultimate or to the practical minimum—to the rate less than which would either put a stop to the increase of capital, or send the whole of the new accumulations abroad—government may annually intercept these new accumulations, without trenching on the employment or wages of the laboring-classes in the country itself, or perhaps in any other country. To this extent, therefore, the <b>loan</b> <b>system</b> may be carried, without being liable to the utter and peremptory condemnation which is due to it when it overpasses this limit. What is wanted is an index to determine whether, in any given series of years, as during the last great war, for example, the limit has been exceeded or not.|$|E
