25|$|The {{desirability}} of hiring directors over 60 is fairly diminished in this marketplace. At the same time, I hadn't had a good-sized hit {{in quite a}} while. And, frankly, I went {{through a couple of}} experiences that <b>left</b> <b>me</b> pretty disgusted with it all, and I was thinking the time had passed. I was just sitting at home reading magazines and looking out the window — a couple of projects I had had just fallen apart — when I got a call from Sly, who had sent me a script.|$|E
25|$|Even {{as a young}} boy, Ryelandt had a mind of his own. Much as he revered his “best piano teacher,” Franz Devos (of the Ghent Conservatory) {{who gave}} him private lessons, he wrote that Devos “did not pay enough {{attention}} to technique, which <b>left</b> <b>me</b> unsatisfied.” While he {{learned a lot from}} Tinel, whose technical mastery he greatly admired, he also let himself be influenced by Wagner, whom Tinel detested, and by French composers such as Franck, Fauré and Debussy, whereas Tinel was primarily German-oriented. But Ryelandt never belonged to any school or fashion; in fact, he despised fashion.|$|E
25|$|A failed two-year {{relationship}} with Australian model Helena Vestergaard, {{who was only}} 19 when they began dating in 2012 (he was 50), served as {{a major influence on}} his songwriting for the band's 2016 album, The Getaway which often has Kiedis questioning their relationship and the age difference between the two. “Lyrically, I’m embarrassed to say, but a two-year relationship that completely fell apart like a nuclear bomb just <b>left</b> <b>me</b> feeling pretty raw and available to the emotional universe for writing. So even though the relationship {{was a bit of a}} disaster, I feel that in some way I did get something out of it, which was about half the songs on this record,” Kiedis said.|$|E

25|$|So I {{wrote this}} song that I loved and I {{sent it to}} them and he and Joel, I remember, <b>left</b> <b>me</b> a great message saying, I hate you, you bastard, I love this song. We're gonna have to do it. We're gonna have to re-build the Wiltern Theater, which they had taken down, it was {{a million dollars to}} re-do the ending... and I felt all his hostility for Universal. A guy named Sean Daniels, who was head of production, one day said to me, well there is hostility because we {{understand}} you waited about eight months to come up with that final song and you never did it. I said, where'd you hear that? I did it in two days. He said, Jimmy Iovine. So I went to Jimmy Iovine and I said all that to his, yeah it's true, I know. I blamed you but you can't be upset with me. I'm not like a writer. I've gotta make my way with these people. I had to have a scapegoat.|$|E

500|$|... "The Darkness" [...] had {{the desired}} effect; Lineberger wrote that [...] "I {{was taken aback}} by the dark tone and {{emotional}} range generated by this episode. Highlander is a fantasy series, yet I cared about the characters as though I know them... Vandernoot gave Tessa such vitality and charm that her death <b>left</b> <b>me</b> reeling."

500|$|A {{reviewer}} from Boxxet {{commented that}} [...] "when I checked the schedule {{and saw the}} title of this episode was 'Peter's Two Dads', I was a little torn.

500|$|John Buck, an English athlete, {{said this}} about his reason for {{attending}} the games: [...] "I {{had been in}} Perth {{during the war years}} serving as an engine room artificer on H.M. submarine Thule and had the misfortune to pick up one of those endearing Australian bugs which <b>left</b> <b>me</b> in a rather poor state [...] of health (e.g. a paraplegic)". He {{wanted to go back to}} Perth to see the Stitt family who looked after him in Perth.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{problems}} during production, the album remained Wright's favourite: [...] "It's an album I {{can listen to}} for pleasure, and there aren't many Floyd albums that I can." [...] Gilmour shares this view: [...] "I for {{one would have to}} say that it is my favourite album, the Wish You Were Here album. [...] The end result of all that, whatever it was, definitely has <b>left</b> <b>me</b> an album I can live with very very happily. [...] I like it very much." ...|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the album}} was written by Rivers Cuomo. Exceptions are [...] "My Name Is Jonas", which was co-written with Jason Cropper and Patrick Wilson, and [...] "Surf Wax America" [...] and [...] "The World Has Turned and <b>Left</b> <b>Me</b> Here", which were {{composed}} and written by Cuomo and Wilson.

500|$|David Denby of New York {{magazine}} {{felt that}} the film would not make sense to viewers who had not previously read the book. Denby wrote that the film was too dark and lacked humor, concluding that [...] "The lurid, meaningless violence of this movie <b>left</b> <b>me</b> exhausted and sickened by the end." [...] Michael Barrier, an animation historian, described The Lord of The Rings as one of two films that demonstrated [...] "that Bakshi was utterly lacking in the artistic self-discipline that might have permitted him to outgrow his limitations." ...|$|E
500|$|During one of Art's visits, {{he finds}} that a friend of Mala's has sent the couple one of the {{underground}} comix magazines Art contributed to. [...] Mala had tried to hide it, but Vladek finds and reads it. [...] In [...] "Prisoner on the Hell Planet", Art is traumatized by his mother's suicide three months after his release from the mental hospital, {{and in the end}} depicts himself behind bars saying, [...] "You murdered me, Mommy, and <b>left</b> <b>me</b> here to take the rap!" [...] Though it brings back painful memories, Vladek admits that dealing with the issue in such a way was for the best.|$|E
500|$|Many {{songs from}} the album are {{inspired}} by Cuomo's past personal experiences. [...] "My Name is Jonas", deals with Cuomo's brother Leaves who had been seriously injured {{in a car accident}} while a student at Oberlin College and was having problem with his insurance. Jason Cropper earned co-writing credit for coming up with the intro to the song. Both [...] "No One Else" [...] and [...] "The World Has Turned and <b>Left</b> <b>Me</b> Here" [...] are lyrically connected, with Cuomo describing the narrator of [...] "No One Else" [...] as [...] "the jealous-obsessive asshole in me freaking out on my girlfriend" [...] and claiming that [...] "'The World has Turned and <b>Left</b> <b>Me</b> Here' is the same asshole wondering why she's gone." [...] The second single from the Blue Album was [...] "Buddy Holly", whose music video was also directed by Spike Jonze. It portrayed the band performing at the original Arnold's Drive-In diner from the popular 1970s television show, Happy Days. The video combined contemporary footage of the band with clips from the show. Happy Days cast member Al Molinaro made a cameo appearance in the video. The video was met with great popularity and heavy rotation on MTV. The music video was also featured as an extra in the Microsoft Windows 95 Upgrade CD, along with Edie Brickell's [...] "Good Times" [...] music video and the movie trailer for Rob Roy. The video won four awards at the 1995 MTV Video Music Awards, including prizes for Breakthrough Video and Best Alternative Video.|$|E
