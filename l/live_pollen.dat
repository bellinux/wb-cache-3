40|$|Initial {{investigations}} have revealed {{the existence of}} 9 species from this genus in the Ardebil province of Iran. Plants of this genus have a rather vast spread in the province {{and the lack of}} prior investigations with regard to the longevity of their pollen grains has prompted this study. In this research, initially, the plant species were identified and their growth areas in the Province were determined. Subsequently, the longevity of pollen grains from each species was determined with the use of Tetrazolium Bromide solution. The number of live and dead pollen grains in a count of 500 were determined at one hour intervals. The grain count was continued until the percentage of live grains was dropped to a zero value. With regard to each species, the type of correlation between the percentage of pollen grain longevity and time was determined. Using the calculated equations, it was hence possible to predict, with a minimum error, pollen grain longevity for different time intervals. The results of this research has revealed that the highest <b>live</b> <b>pollen</b> percentage and longevity belongs to Papaver oriental L. var. parviflora Bush. (99. 96 % and 70 h) and the lowest value belong to Papaver gaubae Cullen and Rech. f. (zero percent and zero h). In addition it was revealed that a close relationship exist between the environmental factors and the longevity of pollen grains. This type of relationship also exists among populations within each species. In other words, pollen grain longevity in various populations is variously under the effect of environmental factors in each species...|$|E

50|$|Pollen feeding is {{correlated}} with higher overall fitness. Individuals that feed on <b>pollen</b> <b>live</b> longer {{than those that}} feed only on nectar or sugar water. Females carry more pollen than males since nutrients such as amino acids from pollen are needed for egg production. Oogenesis is greatly affected by pollen intake. When pollen is absent in the diet, oviposition rates decrease and lifetime fecundity, {{or the number of}} eggs produced, drops significantly.|$|R
50|$|The imago <b>lives</b> on <b>pollen.</b> The larvae are {{exclusively}} parasitic, mainly {{living in}} the nests of solitary wild bees. The female lays between 2000 and 10000 eggs, {{but most of these}} fail to reach maturity either for lack of food or through predation. In contrast with the adult, the larvae are only about 3mm long, and their development proceeds through hypermetamorphosis. The various larval stages are therefore of different forms. Unlike the larvae of beetles of the genus Meloe, the first stage larva does not cling on to a potential host, but has to actively seek a host out. Once the larva has consumed the egg and stored nectar and pollen from a bee's nest, they leave it. They then moult again, and emerge with their back legs formed. From this stage they pupate, and emerge from the chrysalis as adults. If a larva accidentally selects a honey bee as host, it dies in the hive.|$|R
40|$|Impact of Permethrin-Insecticide Application on Insect Pest (Thosea sp.) and Insect Pollinators (Elaeidobius kamerunicus) in Oil Palm Agroecosystem.   Insecticide {{efficacy}} {{studies are}} usually determined {{from the target}} insect (pest) data {{without regard to the}} effect of that treatment on the non-target insects (such as pollinators). This study examined  the effect of  permethrin  (one of widely used insecticides for agriculture)   on   defoliating insect pest (nettle caterpillar, Thosea sp.) and  insect pollinator (weevil, Elaeidobius kamerunicus) which <b>lives</b> on <b>pollen</b> of  male oil palm flowers.   A complete block design was used in which each of  four blocks consisted of 5 treatments (4 concentrations of permethrin; 50;  100; 200; and 250 ppm and control).   The results clearly demonstrated  that the application of  permethrin reduced significantly the number of  nettle caterpillar  throughout all sprayed plants (up to 100 % 14 d after treatments).   A significant difference in mean population of the caterpillar were detected between plots sprayed with permethrin (0. 05; 0. 25; 0. 53; and 2. 00 larvae/leaves at  concentrations of  250; 200; 100; and 50 ppm respectively) and control plant  (5. 2 larvae/leaves) 3 d after treatments. This  insecticide effects  persisted for at least  14 d after treatments.   On the other hand,  permethrin application in oil palm agroecosystem had adverse effects on main pollinator (E. kamerunicus).   The number of weevil pollinators on sprayed plants (12. 5; 59. 3; 77. 5; and 209. 5 weevil/male flower at  concentrations of 50; 100; 200; and 250 ppm respectively) were significantly fewer compared to the control plants (976. 0   weevil/male flower).   The results indicate that, despite high efficacy of permethrin in reducing number of insect pests  of oil palm (Thosea sp.), its application also cause a severe impact on  important insect pollinators  (E. kamerunicus) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of the predatory mites, Neoseiulus womersleyi (Schicha) and Euseius ovalis (Evans), feeding on four tetranychid mites (Tetranychus urticae, Tetranychus kanzawai, Oligonychus mangiferus, Panonychus cirri), maize pollen or Chinese loofah pollen was studied at 25 C. Immature stages of N. womersleyi feeding on T. urticae and T. kanzawai had shorter developmental duration (4. 71 and 5. 02 days for females, 4. 77 and 5. 19 days for males, respectively) than those feeding on other food sources. Immature stages of E. ovalis females feeding on O. mangiferus and T urticae developed in 4. 99 and 5. 13 days, respectively, the shortest developmental duration measured. Immature stages of E. avails males feeding on O. mangiferus and T urticae developed in 5. 12 and 5. 37 days, respectively. The longevity of N. womersleyi males (13. 31 to 14. 51 days) and females (17. 67 to 21. 81 days) feeding on T. urticae, T. kanzawai or maize pollen was longer than the longevity of N. womersleyi feeding on O. mangiferus, P. citri or loofah pollen.

40|$|Production {{of maize}} hybrid seed is {{hindered}} by relatively poor production by the male line pollen; short <b>live</b> of the <b>pollen</b> which was ascribed to desiccation and dehydration sensitive and flowering asynchrony {{between male and}} female lines. The aims of this study were to enhance production and viability of male line pollen and also to determine the suitable storage condition for maintaining pollen viability in order to be used for production of hybrid seed. The research consisted of two experiments. The first experiment was arranged in split plot randomized block design with NPK dosages as main plot (0, 300, 600, 900 kg ha- 1) and application of boron as sub-plot (0, 1. 5, 3, 4. 5, 6 kg ha- 1), replicated three times. The second experiment used randomized block design with two factors, i. e. storage temperature (- 196 oC and - 20 oC) and storage period (0, 1, 2, 3, 4 weeks). The result showed that NPK 900 kg ha- 1 increased the number of spike per tassel from 9. 3 to 10. 7. Application of NPK 600 kg ha- 1 or boron 1. 5 kg ha- 1 improved pollen viability. Combination of NPK 900 kg ha- 1 and boron 6 kg ha- 1 resulted in the highest pollen viability of 95. 3 %. Pollen after being stored for four weeks either in - 196 ºC or - 20 ºC was possible to be used for seed production with 20 % seed set...|$|R

Exploring the {{language}} of sculpture Laura White uses a range of materials from everyday objects to constructed matter. She is interested in our relationship and negotiation with the ‘stuff’ of the world, from the readymade to the handmade, image to objects, the representational to the abstract, playing with value, profile, association and meaning of individual and collections of objects. These objects/arrangements occupy a fluid space, on one hand demanding critical discourse, {{and on the other}} its own ambiguous, intuitive logic. For this exhibition at Pollen, Laura extends her ongoing fascination and investigation into objects she comes across, from those found in bricolage and craft shops to the objects in and on the periphery of our living and working spaces, such as an arrangement of objects in a shop window or ornaments clustered on a mantelpiece. Thinking about the pile of objects we acquire, borrow and give away during our lives, Laura is interested in ideas and questions around their relational placement and display, where an object can be just as much a decoration, ornament or centerpiece as it is an artwork in a gallery. Objects she makes from everyday and ready available materials, such as tinfoil, clay and expanding foam appear on one hand familiar, and yet equally strange and unfamiliar like prototypes or hybrids. We are encouraged to question our own taste and the value given to these objects, pointing us back out into the world where the strangeness is not so much in the gallery but the objects we come across everyday in our <b>lives.</b> Since 1991, <b>Pollen</b> has been welcoming artists of all nationalities, enabling them to realize a specific project or else to pursue personal research.

40|$|Eight Bombus terrestris (L.) colonies were {{reared in}} {{laboratory}} observation hives in 1986 and foraged in cages. Pollen and sugar consumption were correlated {{and could be}} estimated from larval area and number of <b>live</b> workers. <b>Pollen</b> consumption peaked within two weeks of maximum larval area in 6 - 8 week old colonies and coincided with peak worker emergence. Sugar consumption peaked {{with the emergence of}} males and queens two weeks later. The optimum period for maximum pollination efficiency for a colony would be from one week prior to peak larval area to two weeks after. There was a positive correlation between the total productivity of a colony ('Productivity Index', a biomass estimate from the number and size of empty cocoons) and the maxima of live worker numbers, larval area and rate of food consumption, and the total food consumption and biomass (but not sex ratio) of reproductives produced. Colonies with higher consumption made greater investment in reproductives, but larger colonies did not invest proportionally more into reproduction than smaller colonies. Larger colonies grew faster with more workers emerging per unit time than smaller colonies. Food consumption and development of indoor colonies was compared with ten colonies maintained in the same observation hives but free foraging outdoors on flowering crops in 1987. Maximum weekly pollen consumption was 12. 6 times less in free foraging colonies and sugar energy consumption was 43 times lower with no queens produced in colonies foraging outdoors. The pollen consumption/cm 2 at maximum larval area was 14 times lower in free foraging than indoor colonies so consumption (rate and total) for free foraging colonies could not be predicted from maximum larval area using indoor consumption data. The order of B. terrestris nectar gatherers' and queens' crop preference over the whole season was: borage, Borago officinalis > fodder radish, Raphanus sativus > swede, Brassica napus > broccoli, Brassica oleracea. Flower preference was not correlated with flower density or production. B. terrestris males and honey bees preferred borage with broccoli as second choice. Honey bees were on average seven times more abundant on crops than B. terrestris workers and with a similar tongue length honey bees provided the greatest competition for food. On calm, warm days honey bee numbers on borage exceeded 2 /m 2, nectar and pollen became depleted and B. terrestris switched to nectar gathering on fodder radish. The long corolla tube of fodder radish excluded nectar collection by honey bees with a short tongue, whereas B. terrestris workers bit holes in the corolla base and 'robbed' nectar. Honey bees and B. terrestris males removed nectar from previously perforated fodder radish flowers. Borage secreted nectar throughout the season and had the most pollen and nectar per flower. Fodder radish had the highest flower density and pollen and nectar standing crop, producing nectar later in the season as weather improved. B. terrestris being less sensitive to poor weather, foraged for nectar and pollen each day before and after the peak in honey bee numbers. B. terrestris workers collected pollen on borage by vibrational pollen harvesting ('buzz' pollination) from poricidal-like anthers. On crucifers, incidental dusting of pollen while nectar collecting occurred. Early in the season borage pollen was collected throughout the day, but later in the season with increasing honey bees on borage B. terrestris pollen gatherers collected borage pollen early in the day and crucifer pollen {{during the rest of the}} day. Sugar concentration of nectar returning in foragers was highly correlated with sugar concentration of the most preferred crop at that time. With higher temperature and decreased rainfall, more pollen and nectar became available, more pollen and nectar gatherers and honey bees foraged on the crops and workers returned to colonies with more food. The high density of honey bees on borage did not reduce the food intake returning to B. terrestris colonies...|$|R
40|$|Background In {{the past}} half-century, the {{prevalence}} of asthma among children and adolescents has risen and asthma has become an important public health challenge in Sweden {{as well as in}} many other countries, necessitating further studies on this complex disease and its risk factor pattern. The studies included in this thesis aimed to investigate the clinical expression of childhood asthma over time, to describe the determinants of new-onset and remission of asthma, and to evaluate possible environmental risk factors in northern Sweden. Methods As the result of a repeated questionnaire survey among primary school children aged 7 - 8 years in three municipalities in the north of Sweden, two pediatric cohorts were formed, one in 1996 (n= 3430) and one in 2006 (n= 2585). The cohort created in 1996 was followed annually until the age of 19 years. Skin prick testing was performed on children in both cohorts. Lung function and bronchial hyperreactivity testing were carried out in children with asthma in the first cohort. The study participation and retention rates were very high in both cohorts. Among children in the second cohort living in Luleå, the home addresses were assigned to coordinates in a geographical information system (GIS) to evaluate the impact on respiratory health of living near roads with much traffic, which was measured as the number of vehicles daily. We used a validated reported diagnosis of asthma and International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questions were incorporated into the questionnaire. A cross-sectional study of children of the same age ten years apart, longitudinal studies on asthma incidence and remission as well as a cross-sectional study on vehicle traffic were performed. Results While children aged 7 - 8 years in 2006 more often had a physician-diagnosed asthma compared to children of the same age in 1996 (7. 4 % vs 5. 7 %, p< 0. 001), they had less asthma symptoms, especially severe symptoms. In parallel, a more beneficial environment and a more intense treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) were observed. The explanation for this change in clinical expression probably includes also an increased awareness and diagnosing of asthma. From age 12 years to age 19 years, the cumulative incidence of physician-diagnosed asthma was 7. 2 % and of current wheeze 22. 0 %. The risk of new-onset asthma in adolescence was increased among girls, sensitized and those with heredity for asthma. Smoking and home dampness increased the risk for incident wheeze. The risk for both incident asthma and wheeze was inversely related to number of siblings. Among children with current asthma at age 7 - 8 years, 21 % were in remission, 38 % had periodic asthma and 41 % had persistent asthma at a follow-up at age 19 years. Subjects in remission and with periodic asthma had significantly less airway obstruction and showed less bronchial hyperreactivity compared to subjects with persistent asthma. The probability of asthma remission from childhood to early adulthood was significantly increased by absence of allergic sensitization, male gender and a low asthma severity scoring at age 7 - 8 years. Sensitization to furred animals was more important as a determinant of both incidence and remission than sensitization to <b>pollen.</b> <b>Living</b> close to roads with high traffic flows, especially with heavy vehicles, was associated with an increased risk for current wheeze. Stratified analyses showed that the effect of traffic on asthma and wheeze was restricted to non-sensitized subjects. Conclusion Asthma onset in adolescence was more common among girls and remission was more common among boys. Children sensitized to furred animals and children with a more severe asthma were risk groups for persistence of asthma. Environmental factors such as smoking and dampness were associated to onset of asthma symptoms during adolescence, and vehicle traffic was associated with asthma symptoms among children also in a small city with relatively low traffic flows. Preventive measures like smoking reduction programs, improvement of damp housing conditions and separation of areas where many children live from heavily trafficked roads could prove to be beneficial.
