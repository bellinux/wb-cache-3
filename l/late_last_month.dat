If the numbers go up then they prove {{the effectiveness of this}} or that innovation. If they go down then teachers aren’t making the effort or are accepting excuses for poor performance. And if one set of test results doesn’t provide the evidence you want, just search for another. The stakes are always high where tests like these are involved, and also at stake are the reputations of education-reformer politicians. Nowhere is this more obvious than in New York, where optimistic and ever-improving results in the state’s own tests have been increasingly been contradicted by national test results for the same students.

On September 5, Abdul Wahab Al-Fowzan, the Kuwaiti health minister-in-exile, stated {{at a press}} conference in Taif, Saudi Arabia [...] "that Iraqi soldiers had seized virtually all of the country's hospitals and medical institutions after their invasion" [...] and that [...] "soldiers evicted patients and systematically looted the hospitals of high-tech equipment, ambulances, drugs and plasma" [...] which resulted in the death of 22 premature babies.The Washington Post described the origin of the Kuwaiti baby story as follows:The Kuwaiti baby story originated with a letter from a senior Kuwaiti public health official that was smuggled out of the country by a European diplomat <b>late</b> <b>last</b> <b>month,</b> according to Hudah Bahar, an architect who received the letter here in London. It was supplemented by information gathered from fleeing Kuwaitis and other sources by Fawzia Sayegh, a Kuwaiti pediatrician living here.The letter claimed that Iraqi soldiers ordered patients evicted from several hospitals and closed down critical units for treating cancer patients, dialysis patients and those suffering from diabetes. Bahar and Sayegh said the Iraqis hauled sophisticated equipment such as dialysis machines back to Baghdad, part of the haul of cash, gold, cars and jewelry that is said by Arab banking sources to exceed $2 billion. Among the equipment taken were the 22 infant incubator units, they said.The Washington Post also noted that it was unable to verify the accusations as Iraq did not permit access to the area and had quarantined diplomats.|$|E

The re-sponse to {{herpes simplex virus}} was characterized by a vigorous compartmentalized immune response. The intrathecal response comprised three different phases: an acute stage (first week of illness), characterized by elevated CSF levels of interleukin (IL) - 6 and interferon-v; an early convalescence stage (weeks 2 - 6 after onset of disease), associated with peaking levels of tumor necrosis factor-a and late markers of the specificT cell-mediated immune response, soluble IL- 2 receptor, and soluble CD 8 antigen (sCD 8); and finally, a <b>late</b> convalescence stage, <b>lasting</b> <b>months</b> to years and associated with persistently increased levels of sCD 8 in particular.
