Data collected from the OECD for Austria has shown that since 1956 total employment did grow until 1994 and since then remained relatively steady. Employment in industry and construction, however, has declined steadily as service sector employment has steadily increased. Data also shows that even as employment in industry and construction has decreased, industry productivity has continued to grow. Austrian unemployment has steadily increased since 1983 due to deindustrialisation.

The rationale is that with the carbon tax revenue coming into government coffers, it could be directly spent by the government rather than distributed to the population via cheques, and that other kinds of taxation, such as labour taxation, could be decreased correspondingly. It is argued that this would {{have a positive effect on}} GDP since there would be a greater incentive for firms to increase employment, and that it would also positively affect social equity, since <b>labour</b> <b>taxes</b> are regressive by nature.|$|E
50|$|In 1722, the Imperial Count of Hillesheim {{bought a}} one-fourth {{share of the}} lordship over Reipoltskirchen from the Counts of Löwenhaupt. This deed was {{overturned}} by the Reichskammergericht, although the actual reversal of the deed {{did not take place}} until 1754. The Count of Hillesheim, though, evidently did not give up his ambition to have a share of the Reipoltskirchen lordship, for in 1730, he bought a one-half share of the lordship from the holdings of the Counts of Manderscheid. The Hillesheims held this share until the French Revolution. The ecclesiastical arrangements were altered by the Count of Hillesheim. A Catholic parish was established in Reipoltskirchen, and made subject to the Archbishopric of Mainz. Protestant-Lutheran parishes were set up in Finkenbach, Rathskirchen and Rudolphskirchen (today an outlying centre of Rathskirchen). On 11 October 1748, Count Willhelm von Hillesheim died in Reipoltskirchen. After his death, an extensive overhaul of the lordship arrangements was negotiated between Löwenhaupt and Hillesheim. This agreement was approved by the Emperor on 21 March 1754. In 1761, there arose disputes with the Duchy of Palatinate-Zweibrücken over tithes, compulsory <b>labour,</b> <b>taxes</b> and Wildfangrecht (a system under which a feudal lord could incorporate any “stray” person in his domain into the ranks of his subjects if he or she could not demonstrate allegiance to another lord). Although the Reichskammergericht in Wetzlar ruled in Reipoltskirchen’s favour in the case of its grievance, the great Duchy kept on doing with the dwarf state of Reipoltskirchen whatever it deemed ﬁt. On 28 November 1763, the Löwenhaupts sold their share in Reipoltskirchen to Imperial Count Philipp Andreas Ellrodt (or Andreas Philipp von Ellrath, later Ellroth, b. 1707; d. 1 January 1767), a high ofﬁcial in Bayreuth (where Count Nils was likewise in state service), for 140,000 Gulden. Kasimir received 60,000 Gulden of this total while his brother Nils drew a yearly income of 3,000 Gulden from the other 80,000 Gulden. The deed was even prefaced with an exact description of the Lordship of Reipoltskirchen, which said in part: Die Reichsherrschaft Reipoltskirchen steht mit dem hochgräﬂichen Haus von Hillesheim in gleicher Gemeinschaft, liegt zwischen den hochfürstlich - zweibrückischen und kurfürstlich - pfälzischen Ländern und hat ihr eigenes, meistensteils in einem Reich fortgehendes Territorium. (“The Imperial Lordship of Reipoltskirchen stands with the high comital House of Hillesheim in the same community, lies between the high princely land of Zweibrücken and the Electoral-Palatine land and has its own, mostly continuous territory.”). At the same time, Nils von Löwenhaupt’s daughter, Wilhelmine, wed the buyer Andreas Philipp von Ellrath’s son, who was also a state minister in Bayreuth, but he died not long afterwards, in 1765. Wilhelmine then married a Dr. Johannes Nikolaus von Mader, thereby losing her ownership rights to Reipoltskirchen. By that time, though, the elder Ellrath had run into ﬁnancial trouble anyway, and in 1770, he sold his share in the Lordship of Reipoltskirchen for 76,000 Gulden to the County Palatine of Zweibrücken, then ruled by Duke Christian IV. This sale was, however, overturned by a ruling at the Hofgericht - a high lordly court - in Vienna after the Countess of Hillesheim (d. 1773) raised objections. So, Ellrath got this share back after the Countess’s death, in 1776, prompting him to put it straight back on the market and seek a new buyer.|$|E

30|$|There is a {{well-established}} {{literature on the}} relationship between changes in government wage expenditures, competitiveness and external positions. Lane and Perotti (1998) show that a rise in government wage consumption reduces traded sector output via a rise in private sector wages, which would lead to a deterioration in the current account, if there exist adjustment costs that prevent consumption and investment of traded goods from falling rapidly. 2 Lane and Perotti (2003) find further evidence that higher government wage spending impacts on the supply side by raising the real product wage, thereby depressing profitability. 3 To the extent that a rise in public compensations is financed with resources drawn from the private sector that may take the form of increased <b>labour</b> <b>taxes,</b> the literature on the impact of <b>labour</b> <b>taxes</b> on private sector costs is equally relevant. So, for example, Alesina and Perotti (1997) look specifically at the effects of changes in <b>labour</b> <b>taxes</b> on unit labour costs and find that in a bargaining model higher <b>labour</b> <b>taxes</b> increase unit labour costs, unless wage negotiations are conducted by a monopoly union that is large enough to internalise the consequences of higher output prices on real consumption and employment.|$|E
40|$|Using a {{stochastic}} growth model {{subject to}} shocks to productivity, government expenditure and tastes we derive analytical expressions for optimal labour and capital tax rates. We find <b>labour</b> <b>taxes</b> {{are driven by}} two factors: (a) a component reflecting Ramsey efficiency considerations and (b) a component reflecting the financing needs of the government which varies with the excess burden of taxation. In the case of complete markets, when the government can issue fully contingent debt, the government insures against variations in the excess burden of taxation and so taxes change purely for efficiency reasons. Assuming logarithmic utility, both the serial correlation and variance of taxes {{are directly related to}} those of employment. As a result, optimal <b>labour</b> <b>taxes</b> can show frequent and predictable changes; can display a strong cyclical pattern and may be more or less volatile than government expenditure. Assuming a balanced growth path is however sufficient to rule out <b>labour</b> <b>taxes</b> following a martingale process. When the government can only issue risk free non-contingent debt then both Ramsey considerations and variations in the excess burden of taxation lead to changes in taxes and so increase tax volatility. The variations in the excess burden introduce a martingale component to <b>labour</b> <b>taxes.</b> The relative importance of this martingale component is positively related to uncertainty concerning government expenditure while the importance of the Ramsey component depends positively on the excess burden of taxation...|$|E

The reforms were developed {{with the goal of}} overcoming negative effects on the labour market caused by the deep economic crisis in 2008 - 2010 as well as of coping with an increase in <b>labour</b> <b>tax</b> burdens during consolidation. In 2008 - 2010, Latvia was seriously affected by the global economic crisis and during these years real gross domestic product (GDP) declined by 21 percent. Labour market conditions became worse rapidly and at the beginning of 2010, the unemployment rate reached 21. 5 per cent of the economically active population. For the period of 2011 - 2016, the reforms provide for a reduction in the rates of personal income tax (PIT) and social security contributions (SSC) as well as for an increase in PIT allowances. Taking into account the changes made in <b>labour</b> <b>tax</b> laws, we employed forecasts of average wages and applied the Eurostat methodology to calculate the tax wedge for different groups of employees depending on income level and on the number of their dependants. The results show that the impact of the reform varies greatly and it is more beneficial for employees with dependants and for low-wage earners.
