40|$|Abstract Background Coping {{with the}} {{stresses}} of chronic disease is considered as {{a key factor in}} the perceived impairment of health related quality of life (HRQL). Little is known though about these associations in chronic kidney disease (CKD). The present study aimed to investigate the relationship of defensive coping and HRQL among patients in different CKD stages, after adjusting for psychological distress, sociodemographic and disease-related variables. Methods The sample consisted of 98 CKD patients, attending a university nephrology department. Seventy-nine (79) pre-dialysis patients of disease stages 3 to 4 and 19 dialysis patients were included. HRQL was assessed by the 36 -item Short-Form health survey (SF- 36), defensive coping by the Rationality/Emotional Defensiveness (R/ED) scale of the Lifestyle Defense Mechanism Inventory (LDMI) and psychological distress by the depression and anxiety scales of the revised Hopkins Symptom CheckList (SCL- 90 -R). Regression analyses were carried out to examine the association between SF- 36 dimensions and defensive coping style. Results Patients on dialysis had worse scores on SF- 36 scales measuring physical aspects of HRQL. In the fully adjusted analysis, a higher defensive coping score was significantly associated with a lower score on the mental component summary (MCS) scale of the SF- 36 (worse mental health). In contrast, a higher defensive score showed a small positive association with the physical component summary (PCS) scale of the SF- 36 (better health), but this was marginally significant. Conclusions The results provided evidence that emotional defensiveness as a coping style tends to differentially affect the mental and the physical component of HRQL in CKD. Clinicians {{should be aware of the}} effects of <b>long-term</b> <b>denial</b> and could examine the possibility of screening for defensive coping and depression in recently diagnosed CKD patients with the aim to improve both physical and mental health. </p...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} extent and the {{significance}} of the psychologic mechanism of denial in coronary heart disease. This problem is known to be frequent, but its significance remains controversial. DATA SOURCES: From the bibliographies of recent publications, the author traced 21 empirical studies on denial in coronary heart disease published during the last 25 years. STUDY SELECTION: For a chronologic and historical approach all the studies were retained. The oldest had a qualitative and descriptive approach; the most recent used a scale of measurement. DATA EXTRACTION: This review examines the clinical data found in the publications and does not critically analyse the measurement tools. RESULTS: The results show that the ambiguity of the question arises from three aspects that have to be clarified: (1) {{there is a difference between}} the short-term effect and the <b>long-term</b> effect of <b>denial</b> in coronary heart disease; (2) part of the contradictory results could be linked to the scale of measure; and (3) the concept of denial is a notion that is used in an equivocal way that is not clarified even by the precision of the scale of measurement. CONCLUSIONS: Persistence of denial would have negative effects in the long term. The scale of Hackett and Cassem is useful in measuring denial in the acute stage but not in the rehabilitation stage. The very notion of denial is used ambiguously in several of the studies examined...|$|R
40|$|Aim.   This {{paper is}} a report of a study of how people’s {{experiences}} of transient ischaemic attack affect their perception of their health and their uptake of health maintenance measures. Background.   Transient ischaemic attack is a well-recognized warning sign of subsequent stroke, but early diagnosis and management of risk factors can substantially reduce this risk. Even though the physical effects of a transient ischaemic attack are transient, it is known to negatively affect quality of life. However, no qualitative studies have explored the impact of transient ischaemic attack on people’s everyday lives. Methods.   Sixteen participants were recruited from a vascular surgery clinic in a district general hospital in North West England. All had a recent transient ischaemic attack. A qualitative grounded theory study using detailed interviews (n = 21) was conducted. Findings.   Participants experienced conflict between acknowledgement of the transient ischaemic attack as a significant illness episode with implications for their <b>long-term</b> health, and <b>denial</b> of its seriousness. Although they often ignored the initial signs, participants also experienced fear due to increased awareness of their risk of stroke. Often, they {{believed that they were}} having a permanent stroke. Many participants were prompted to seek medical advice by a family member or acquaintance. Having a transient ischaemic attack negatively changed their perception of their health and their quality of life, but some also viewed it as a positive event that had warned of their stroke risk and enabled them to take up health maintenance measures. Conclusions.   Having a transient ischaemic attack permanently changes people’s quality of life and their perception of their health, despite the transience of the symptoms. The ability of people to make positive health changes after a transient ischaemic attack to some extent ameliorates the negative effects of being aware of their heightened stroke risk. Their appreciation of their quality of life may also be enhanced. The transience of the symptoms and lack of knowledge of transient ischaemic attacks lead to delays in seeking medical advice...|$|R
