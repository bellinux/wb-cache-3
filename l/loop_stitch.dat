5000|$|Chain stitch is {{a sewing}} and {{embroidery}} technique {{in which a}} series of <b>looped</b> <b>stitches</b> form a chain-like pattern. Chain stitch is an ancient craft - examples of surviving Chinese chain stitch embroidery worked in silk thread have been dated to the Warring States period (5th - 3rd century BC). Handmade chain stitch embroidery does not require that the needle pass through more than one layer of fabric. For this reason the stitch is an effective surface embellishment near seams on finished fabric.

In the {{simplest}} of the <b>looped</b> <b>stitches,</b> the chain stitch, the needle comes up from the back of the fabric and then the needle goes back into the same hole it came out of, pulling the loop of thread almost completely through to the back; but before the loop disappears, the needle come back up (a certain distance from the beginning stitch -the distance deciding the length of the stitch), passes through the loop and prevents it from being pulled completely to the back of the fabric.

The chain is either turned and worked in rows, or joined {{to the beginning of}} the row with a slip stitch and worked in rounds. Rounds can also be created by working many stitches into a single <b>loop.</b> <b>Stitches</b> are made by pulling one or more loops through each loop of the chain.

[...] From her work in Chicago, which featured architectural elements, to her work in the Pacific Northwest, with its imagery of land, sea and sky, her work is ethereal and technically adept. In reviewing a 2009 exhibition of Smith's work, Carla Seaquist wrote: [...] In essence a seeker, Barbara's artistic purpose is to retrieve those lost things - meaning, mattering, beauty, wit, a sense of the sacred... Barbara has been faithful to her inner landscapes. It's why her work resonates so deeply: she shows us profound things the modern world has forgotten but desperately needs. Since 1975, her work has been featured in over 25 solo exhibitions in the US, UK, New Zealand and Japan. She's participated in dozens of invitational group exhibitions including the Bellevue Art Museum Fiber Biennial, Korea Quilt Festival and the Beijing Art Salon. In a review of a 1989 group exhibition on Long Island, The New York Times called Smith's work [...] "off beat and personal."... her work cannot be pigeonholed into any category. The artist sprays uncolored dyes on cotton or silk fabrics. The dyes stain, flow together and mix, but the hues do not become visible until the fabric has been exposed to light. Off Beat and Personal. To add texture, Ms. Smith machine-stitches large areas. Again her approach is off beat and personal. By loosening the bobbin tension and tightening the needle tension the stitching results in a series of loops. Most seamstresses would moan and rip out the threads if this were to happen to their seams, but here the <b>looped</b> <b>stitching</b> is repeated back and forth across an area, until it resembles the glistening pile of a nylon rug.

40|$|Contemporary {{knitting}} {{over the}} past decade has experienced a recent resurgence in cultural interest and technical exploration. This research project aims to identify, through personal practice, the implications of knitting as undefined, removed from the boundaries of product. It is the dissolving of the lines between design, art and craft and exploring the domestically machine knitted textile via the use of materials and the inherent qualities of the fabric which are the driving factors of this research. It is through this exploration that my personal and creative process is diversified. The traditional connotations of knitting are historical, social and cultural, in particular hand knitting. Childhood memories of mothers and grandmothers knitting out of necessity, for clothing, often evoke feelings of safety, warmth and comfort. This familiarity of the <b>looped</b> <b>stitches</b> and understanding of the knit as garment binds knitting to fashion. Industrial knitting process, as scale of stitch is reduced, begins to remove this familiarity and creates an anonymity of structure and process, for example jersey knits used for t-shirts. This instant recognition for knitting as clothing is part of the design process where-by knitted fabrics work in unison with product. It is this boundary that has defined my professional practice designing for knitwear. This research involves a more experimental and fluid approach to producing the textile, considering the qualities and potential of the structure as something to celebrate in its own form. Designers such as Issey Miyake, Hussein Chalayan and the artist Rosmarie Trockel have been influential in taking fashion concepts into the gallery, often knitted. This movement of making conceptual and political statements, {{especially in the case of}} the industrially knitted pieces by Trockel, was a step to question the traditional and feminist perceptions of knitting and using the process as a material to create art. While these exhibitions explored the knitted textile in the form of fashion garment, the importance of diversifying the knitted cloth and displaying conceptual pieces is a major influence on this research. Also the more recent exhibition &# 039;Radical Lace and Subversive Knitting&# 039;, (Museum of Arts &amp; Design New York 2007), has allowed for a reinvigorated forum for constructed textiles to be viewed as object, new product or purely as spatial explorations of structure. The impact of these ideas has allowed for the consideration of the textile being stripped back further and to remove the instant connot ation of product application. Exploration of materials, knitted structures and the manipulation of fabric without the constraints of identified product is the impetus of this project. The evolution of the outcomes is instrumental to the reactions of fibres, stitch and interplays of positive and negative space, while suggestions of product are accidental and created by the knitted form as it is removed from the machine. A personal interest in exploiting the knitted structures potential to possess transparency and opacity, become sculptural and changeable by hand have influenced the choices of material and stitch combination. This experimentation has informed my personal practice and the involved process of making...|$|R
25|$|One of {{the more}} obvious {{differences}} is that crochet uses one hook while much knitting uses two needles. In most crochet, the artisan usually has only one live stitch on the hook (with the exception being Tunisian crochet), while a knitter keeps an entire row of stitches active simultaneously. Dropped stitches, which can unravel a fabric, rarely interfere with crochet work, due to a second structural difference between knitting and crochet. In knitting, each stitch {{is supported by the}} corresponding stitch in the row above and it supports the corresponding stitch in the row below, whereas crochet stitches are only supported by and support the stitches on either side of it. If a stitch in a finished crocheted item breaks, the stitches above and below remain intact, and because of the complex <b>looping</b> of each <b>stitch,</b> the stitches on either side are unlikely to come loose unless heavily stressed.|$|R
40|$|Aortic interleaflet {{triangle}} reshaping (AITR) is {{a surgical}} approach to aortic valve incontinence that involves placing three stitches at {{half of the}} interleaflet triangles height. In this work, {{the relationship between the}} actual stitch height and valve functioning, and the safety margin that the surgeon can rely on in applying the stitches were systematically investigated in vitro. AITR surgery was applied to six swine aortic roots placing the stitches empirically at 50 %, 60 % and 75 % of the triangle heights. Then the actual stitch heights were measured and the hydrodynamic performances were evaluated with a pulsatile hydrodynamic mock <b>loop.</b> Actual <b>stitch</b> heights were 45 �� 2 % 61 �� 4 % and 79 �� 6 %.

At 75 %, all the hydrodynamic parameters of systolic valve functioning worsened significantly. Summarizing, the AITR technique, when performed in a conservative manner did not induce significant alterations in the hydrodynamics of the aortic root in vitro, while more aggressive configurations did. The absence of a statistically significant difference between the 50 % and 60 % configurations suggests that there is a reasonably limited risk of inducing valve stenosis in the post-op scenario due to stitch misplacement...|$|R

We describe a novel high-strength, low-tension repair for the interrupted closure of skin, cartilage, and muscle, the double <b>loop</b> mattress <b>stitch,</b> {{and compare it}} experimentally with other interrupted closure methods. The performance of the double loop mattress technique in porcine cartilage and skeletal muscle is compared with the simple, mattress, and loop mattress interrupted sutures in both a novel porcine loading chamber and mechanical model. Wound apposition is assessed by electron microscopy. The performance of the double loop mattress in vivo was confirmed using a series of 805 pediatric laparotomies/laparoscopies. The double loop mattress suture is 3. 5 times stronger than the loop mattress in muscle and 1. 6 times stronger in cartilage (p[*]≤[*] 0. 001). Additionally, the double loop mattress reduces tissue tension by 66 % compared with just 53 % for the loop mattress (p[*]≤[*] 0. 001). Wound gapping is equal, and wound eversion appears significantly improved (p[*]≤[*] 0. 001) compared with the loop mattress in vitro. In vivo, the double loop mattress performs {{as well as the}} loop mattress and significantly better than the mattress stitch in assessments of wound eversion and dehiscence. There were no episodes of stitch extrusion in our series of patients. The mechanical advantage of its intrinsic pulley arrangement gives the double loop mattress its favorable properties. Wound dehiscence is reduced because this stitch type is stronger and exerts less tension on the tissue than the mattress stitch. We advocate the use of this novel stitch wherever a high-strength, low-tension repair is required.

40|$|Abstract — The Physico-Mechanical {{properties}} of knitted fabric {{can be changed}} due to use of various count of yarn, type of yarn (ring, rotor, and compact), quality of yarn, <b>Loop</b> length / <b>Stitch</b> length, structural geometry, fibrecomposition of yarn etc. This study focused on the various Loop length effect of grey interlock knit structure. With an increase in Loop length, the dimensional properties like CPI, WPI, GSM, thickness & tightness factor will be decreased; while comfort properties like air permeability & water absorbency will be increased. Again shrinkage & spirality will be decreased with increased Loop length at grey stage. Other properties such as bursting strength, abrasion resistance & pilling resistance improved with increased Loop length. Though all the tests for fabric properties were carried out for grey stage, there properties can considerably vary after further finishing of the fabrics. As finishing is mandatory for fabric production, so now-a-days, these kinds of tests are carried out after finishing stage & proper controlling is done according desired quality.

5000|$|A {{stitching}} awl {{is a tool}} {{with which}} holes can be punctured {{in a variety of}} materials, or existing holes can be enlarged. It is also used for sewing heavy materials, such as leather or canvas. It is a thin, tapered metal shaft, coming to a sharp point, either straight or slightly bent. These shafts are often in the form of interchangeable needles. They usually have an eye piercing at the pointed end to aid in drawing thread through holes for the purpose of manual lockstitch sewing, in which case it is also called a sewing awl. Stitching awls are frequently used by shoe repairers and other leatherworkers. Sewing awls are used to make lock stitches. The needle, with the thread in the eye is pushed through the material. The thread is then pulled through the eye to extend it. As the needle is pushed through the material, the extra thread from the first stitch is then threaded through the <b>loops</b> of successive <b>stitches</b> creating a lock stitch. The action is likened to that of a [...] "miniature sewing machine". Styles may vary, as they are adapted to specific trades, such as making shoes or saddles. They are also used in the printing trades to aid in setting movable type and in bookbinding.|$|R
