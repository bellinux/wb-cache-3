2500|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determined}} that the probable cause of the accident was [...] "the captain’s inability to control the airplane {{in an attempt to}} recover from an asymmetric power condition at <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> <b>following</b> his intentional use of the beta mode of propeller operation to descend and slow the airplane rapidly on final approach for landing. Factors that contributed to the accident were an unstabilized visual approach, the presence of a departing DC-9 on the runway, the desire to make a short field landing, and the higher-than-normal flight idle fuel flow settings of both engines. The lack of fire-blocking material in passenger seat cushions contributed to the severity of the injuries." ...|$|E

40|$|As circuit testing {{days are}} {{expensive}} and limited by regulations, racing teams {{are more and}} more dependent on simulation tools. Van Amersfoort Racing built their own racing simulator to train drivers in an fully controlled environment. This environment is based on commercially available simulation software rFactor. However, no research on the accuracy of the physics of this software is available. Since level of fidelity of race simulators is important for the perception of racing drivers, force feedback steering forces are analyzed. Information of the real Formula 3 car is used to upgrade the vehicle model used in rFactor and to develop a Multibody Dynamic vehicle model of the same car. Steering metrics are used to make qualitative comparisons between steering force measurement in the real car, the simulator and the Multibody Dynamic model. It is shown that the baseline simulator vehicle model is less sensitive to steering input compared to the real car. Furthermore the simulator driver theoretically senses higher steering torques for a given lateral acceleration discarding electric power limitations of the force feedback motor. As a desire to improve simulator fidelity, a Pacejka tyre model of the Hankook Formula 3 tyre is converted to an rFactor model together with an improved suspension model using the exact suspension geometry as provided by car manufacturer Dallara. Simultaneously, the Multibody Dynamic vehicle model is constructed from these submodels, which purely focusses on lateral dynamics. In order to use the lateral based Multibody Dynamic model as a tool for simulation and assessment, its response is tested given the same input as the real Formula 3 car experienced during a particular test. Three cases are considered: weaving on a straight, a <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> corner and a high speed corner. Longitudinal load transfer is inherent in <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> corners, which, due to its limitation in the Multibody Dynamic model, leaves the model adjustments inconclusive. Furthermore, tyre relaxation {{plays an important role in}} <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> corners <b>following</b> each other up in a short period of time, which affect <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> steering metrics. The Multibody Dynamic model showed close correlation of steering metrics with real car measurements for the high speed corner. The updated rFactor model improved steering torque feedback despite higher required steering angles. Flight Performance & PropulsionAerospace Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|The active {{regions of}} chicken {{erythrocyte}} nuclei were labeled using the standard DNase I directed nick translation reaction. These nuclei were {{then used to}} study the characteristics and, in particular, the nuclease sensitivity of active genes. Although DNase I specifically attacks active genes, micrococcal nuclease solubilizes these regions to about the same degree as the total DNA. On the other hand micrococcal nuclease does selectively cut the internucleosomal regions of active genes resulting in the appearance of mononucleosomal fraction which is enriched in active gene DNA. A {{small percentage of the}} active chromatin is also released from the nucleus by <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> centrifugation <b>following</b> micrococcal nuclease treatment. The factors which make active genes sensitive to DNase I were shown to reside on individual nucleosomes from these regions. This was established by showing that isolated active mononucleosomes were preferentially sensitive to DNase I digestion. Although the high mobility group proteins are essential for the maintenance of DNase I sensitivity in active regions, these proteins are not necessary for the formation of the conformation which makes these genes preferentially accessible to micrococcal nuclease. The techniques employed in this paper enable one to study the chromatin structure of the entire population of actively expressed genes. Previous studies have elucidated the structure of a few special highly prevalent genes such as ovalbumin and hemoglobin. The results of this paper show that this special conformation is a general feature of all active genes irregardless of the extent of expression...|$|R

30|$|It {{should be}} {{mentioned}} that the SuperDARN radar needs ionospheric irregularities to receive echoes, which {{are considered to be}} generated mainly by gradient-drift instability (e.g., Keskinen and Ossakow 1983), growing in intensity if the electric field and plasma density are strong enough and properly oriented. In fact, there is a weak relationship between the SuperDARN echo power and Doppler velocity (Fukumoto et al. 1999; Fukumoto et al. 2000). We therefore examined whether the <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> limit of SAPS is also the <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> limit of SuperDARN observations by checking the echo power around the above limit. The result is that the echo power is mostly 3 to 25  dB, well above the noise level (0  dB) around the <b>lowest</b> <b>speed</b> limit of SAPS (250 to 300  m/s) (not shown in the figure). Therefore, we can say that the <b>lowest</b> <b>speed</b> limit of SAPS is not the <b>lowest</b> <b>speed</b> limit of SuperDARN observation.|$|R
