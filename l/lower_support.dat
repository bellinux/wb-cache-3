25|$|The {{support for}} Catalan {{nationalism}} ranges from {{a demand for}} further autonomy and the federalisation of Spain to the desire for independence {{from the rest of}} Spain, expressed by Catalan independentists. The first survey following the Constitutional Court ruling that cut back elements of the 2006 Statute of Autonomy, published by La Vanguardia on 18 July 2010, found that 46% of the voters would support independence in a referendum. In February of the same year, a poll by the Open University of Catalonia gave {{more or less the same}} results. Other polls have shown <b>lower</b> <b>support</b> for independence, ranging from 40 to 49%. Other polls shows more variable results, according with the Spanish CIS, as of December 2016, 47% of Catalans rejected independence and 45% supported it. Although it is established in the whole of the territory, support for independence is significantly higher in the hinterland and the northeast, away from the more populated coastal areas such as Barcelona.|$|E

50|$|Some {{games in}} the genre involve {{enacting}} policies and budget decisions to sway voters. One such game is Democracy, published in 2005 by Positech Games. In Democracy, players make decisions during each turn regarding which policies to support. As turns progress, the player views how their favourability rating changes amongst certain types of voters. Candidates make promises before each election, and failure to follow through can result in <b>lower</b> <b>support</b> during the player's re-election campaign. Another is Commander in Chief, produced by Eversim, boasting an array of choices for domestic policy and decisions. Another such game is Tropico.|$|E

They combined liberalism and conservatism, supported nationalization of infrastructure and opposed class conflict. While mostly in opposition during the 1930s, they embraced economic liberalism, but accepted the welfare state {{after the war and}} participated in governments supportive of state intervention and protectionism.
