5|$|At the 22nd {{hurricane}} {{committee in}} 2000 {{it was decided}} that tropical cyclones that moved from the Atlantic to the Eastern Pacific basin and vice versa would no longer be renamed. Ahead of the 2000–01 season it was decided to start using male names, as well as female names for tropical cyclones developing in the South-West Indian Ocean. RSMC La Reunion subsequently proposed to the fifteenth session of the RA I Tropical Cyclone Committee for the South-West Indian Ocean during September 2001, that the basin adopt a single circular <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>names.</b> Along with the RA V Tropical Cyclone Committee, RSMC La Reunion also proposed to the session that a tropical cyclone have only one name during its lifetime. However, both of these proposals were rejected in favour of continuing an annual <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>names</b> and to rename systems when they moved across 90°E into the South-West Indian Ocean. During the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season the naming of subtropical cyclones restarted, with names assigned to systems from the main <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>names</b> drawn up for that year.|$|E

5|$|A {{memorial}} at St Magnus' Cathedral {{in nearby}} Kirkwall displays a plaque dedicated {{to those who}} lost their lives, beneath which a book of remembrance lists their names. This <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>names</b> was not released by the Government until 40 years after the sinking. Each week a page {{of the book is}} turned. The ship's bell was recovered in the 1970s and, after being restored, was added to the memorial in St Magnus'. A number of bodies, including some that could not be identified, were interred at the naval cemetery in Lyness.|$|E
5|$|In the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning (chapter 38), the enthroned {{figure of}} High {{explains}} that Odin gives {{all of the}} food on his table to his wolves Geri and Freki and that Odin requires no food, for wine is to him both meat and drink. High then quotes the above-mentioned stanza from the poem Grímnismál in support.

5|$|The name Joan was {{retired in}} 1989 and {{replaced}} by Joyce on the list for the 1994 season. The name will never again {{be used for a}} North Atlantic hurricane. Because the impact of the Miriam portion of the tropical cyclone was minimal, the name Miriam was not retired in the Pacific and is still on the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>names</b> for that basin, and was most recently used in the 2012 season.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial was}} {{postponed}} until January 17 because Jackalow's counsel was not {{served with the}} <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>names</b> of the jurors until the morning of January 15, and federal law required that the panel be served two full days before trial. The government planned to call 34 witnesses, and to pay each $500 for their time. Jackalow moved to compel the attendance of Dr. Theodore R. Vanck, Robert J. Dalton, and Professor George Hammell Cook of Rutgers College. Voorhees and Wilson represented Jackalow, and the prosecution was conducted by U.S. Attorney Cannon and Andrew Dutcher.|$|E
5|$|As {{the crisis}} eased, New Jersey was {{released}} {{to continue her}} interrupted voyage. She anchored at Long Beach 5 May 1969, her first visit to her home port in eight months. Through the summer months, New Jerseys crew toiled to make her ready for another deployment, and deficiencies discovered on the gun line were remedied. According to official reports, though, reasons of economy were to dictate otherwise: on 22 August 1969 the United States Secretary of Defense released a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>names</b> of ships to be inactivated; {{at the top of}} the list was New Jersey. Five days later, Captain Snyder was relieved of command by Captain Robert C. Peniston.|$|E

5|$|Despite the relaxed atmosphere, {{relations}} between Bligh and his men, and particularly between Bligh and Christian, continued to deteriorate. Christian was routinely humiliated by the captain—often {{in front of}} the crew and the native Tahitians—for real or imagined slackness, while severe punishments were handed out to men whose carelessness had led to the loss or theft of equipment. Floggings, rarely administered during the outward voyage, now became a common occurrence; as a consequence, three men deserted the ship. They were quickly recaptured, and a search of their belongings revealed a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>names</b> which included those of Christian and Heywood. Bligh confronted the pair and accused them of complicity in the desertion plot, which they strenuously denied; without further corroboration Bligh could not act against them.|$|E
5|$|In Stockholm, Sweden, {{journalist}} Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), {{co-owner of}} Millennium magazine, {{has lost a}} libel case brought against him by businessman Hans-Erik Wennerström (Ulf Friberg). Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), a brilliant but troubled investigator and hacker, compiles an extensive background check on Blomkvist for business magnate Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), who has a special task for him. In exchange for the promise of damning information about Wennerström, Blomkvist agrees to investigate the disappearance and assumed murder of Henrik's grandniece, Harriet, 40 years ago. After moving to the Vanger family's compound, Blomkvist uncovers a notebook containing a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>names</b> and numbers {{that no one has}} been able to decipher.|$|E

Five RIRA members were also convicted in connection with the 2001 bombing campaign in England, and received sentences varying from 16 years to 22 years imprisonment. In October 2002, McKevitt and other RIRA members imprisoned in Portlaoise Prison issued a statement calling for the organisation to stand down. After a two-month trial, McKevitt was sentenced to twenty years imprisonment in August 2003 after being convicted of directing terrorism.|$|E

5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Joni {{impacted}} {{the island}} nations of Tuvalu and Fiji, while it also threatened the Fijian dependency of Rotuma and the French territory of Wallis and Futuna. The {{majority of the}} Tuvaluan islands suffered minor damage from Joni, while in Fiji the system caused a moderate to severe amount of damage. Due {{to the impact of}} this system, the name Joni was subsequently retired, from the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>names</b> for the region by the World Meteorological Organization. This would normally mean that the name would not be used again in the region, however, the name remained on the list and was used during the 2008–09 season.|$|E
5|$|The Town and County War Memorial {{does not}} contain a list of casualties. The local branch of the Royal British Legion {{launched}} a campaign for a memorial dedicated to the town and containing a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>names.</b> A garden of remembrance was built in Abington Square, {{the location of the}} original temporary cenotaph, and unveiled by Major General Sir John Brown in 1937; the names of the fallen were inscribed on the garden walls. The memorial to Edgar Mobbs—a professional rugby player from Northampton who was killed in the First World War in 1917—was moved into the garden.|$|E
5|$|The <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>names</b> {{consists}} of entries from 17 Southeast and East Asian {{nations and the}} United States who have territories directly affected by typhoons. The submitted names are arranged into five lists, and each list is cycled with each year. Unlike tropical cyclones {{in other parts of}} the world, typhoons are not named after people. Instead, they generally refer to animals, flowers, astrological signs, and a few personal names. However, PAGASA retains its own naming list, which does consist of human names. Therefore, a typhoon can possibly have two names. Storms that cross the date line from the central Pacific retain their original name, but the designation of hurricane becomes typhoon. In Japan, people use the numerical designation of typhoons according to the sequence of their occurrence in the calendar year.|$|E

5|$|Within the Eastern Pacific basin the <b>naming</b> <b>of</b> {{tropical}} cyclones {{started in}} 1960, with four sets <b>of</b> female <b>names</b> initially {{designed to be}} used consecutively before being repeated. In 1965 after two <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> <b>names</b> had been used, {{it was decided to}} return to the top <b>of</b> the second <b>list</b> and to start recycling the sets <b>of</b> <b>names</b> on an annual basis. In 1977 after protests by various women's rights groups, NOAA made the decision to relinquish control over the name selection by allowing a regional committee of the WMO to select new sets <b>of</b> <b>names.</b> The WMO selected six <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> <b>names</b> which contained male names and rotated every six years. They also decided that the new <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> hurricane <b>name</b> would start to be used in 1978 which was a year earlier than the Atlantic. Since 1978 the same <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> <b>names</b> have been used, with <b>names</b> <b>of</b> significant tropical cyclones removed from the lists and replaced with new names.|$|R
5|$|The {{memorial}} is {{not without}} its critics. Alana Vincent has argued that constituent parts of the monument are in conflict, and as a result the message conveyed by the monument is not unified. Visually, Vincent argues there is a dichotomy between the triumphant pose of the figures {{at the top of the}} pylons and the mourning posture of those figures at the base. Textually, she argues the inscription text celebrating the victory at the Battle of Vimy Ridge strikes a very different tone to the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>names</b> of the missing at the base of the monument.|$|E
5|$|After {{the passage}} of Tehcir Law on 29 May 1915, Armenians left at the two holding centers were {{deported}} to Ottoman Syria. Most of the arrested were transferred from Central Prison over Saray Burnu by steamer No. 67 of the Şirket company to the Haydarpaşa train station. After waiting for ten hours, they were sent by special train {{in the direction of}} Ankara the next day. The entire convoy consisted of 220 Armenians. An Armenian train conductor got a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>names</b> of the deportees. It was handed over to the Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople, Zaven Der Yeghiayan, who immediately tried in vain to save as many deportees as possible. The only foreign ambassador to help him in his efforts was US ambassador Henry Morgenthau. After a train journey of 20 hours, the deportees got off in Sincanköy (near Ankara) Tuesday noon. At the station Ibrahim, the director of the Central Prison of Constantinople, did the triage. The deportees were divided into two groups.|$|E
5|$|The names Adolph and Israel were {{subsequently}} retired for political considerations, after a tiff brewed {{over the use}} of their names {{at the start of the}} 2001 season. The name Kenna was retired in 2003 after it became one of the most intense Pacific hurricanes ever recorded. The name Alma was retired in 2009 after it had become the first Eastern Pacific tropical cyclone on record to make landfall along the Pacific Coast of Central America. The name Manuel was retired in 2014, after it became the first Eastern Pacific tropical cyclone on record to make landfall in mainland Mexico, redevelop over water, and become a hurricane. At the 2015 hurricane committee meeting the name Odile was retired from the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>names</b> after it became the first major hurricane to affect Baja California in 25 years. The name Isis was also pre-emptively retired from the lists of names for 2016, as it was deemed inappropriate to be used because of the Islamic extremist rebel group.|$|E
