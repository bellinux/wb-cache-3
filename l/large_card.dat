60|$|He {{drew out}} slowly from an upper {{waistcoat}} pocket a scarlet card-case, and as slowly produced a very <b>large</b> <b>card.</b> Even {{in the instant}} of its production, they fancied it was of a queer shape, unlike the cards of ordinary gentlemen. But it was there only for an instant; for as it passed from his fingers to Arthur's, one or another slipped his hold. The strident, tearing gale in that garden carried away the stranger's card to join the wild waste paper of the universe; and that great western wind shook the whole house and passed.|$|E

[...] "Give salaam," [...] said the civilian, and there entered in haste a slender youth, clad in a closely fitting coat of grey homespun, tight trousers, patent-leather shoes, and a small black velvet cap. His thin cheek twitched, and his eyes wandered restlessly, for {{the young man was}} evidently nervous and uncomfortable, though striving to assume a free and easy air.|$|E

I had noticed him at luncheon, and Ah Lin, the Chinese boy, told me he had come from the Paumotus on the boat that had that day arrived. Tiare introduced me to him, and he handed me his card, a <b>large</b> <b>card</b> on which was printed <i Rene Brunot>, and underneath, <i Capitaine au Long Cours.> We were sitting on a little verandah outside the kitchen, and Tiare was cutting out a dress that she was making for one of the girls about the house.

5000|$|Decline: 1890s. As {{snapshot}} {{and personal}} photography became commonplace among the public, {{the popularity of}} the cabinet card and cabinet card specific albums waned. Unmounted paper prints and the scrapbook albums started replacing them. A variety of other <b>large</b> <b>card</b> styles of various names and dimensions came about for professional portraits in the 1880s and 1890s. After 1900, card photographs generally had a much larger area surrounding the print quite often with an embossed frame around the image on heavy, gray card stock.|$|E

5000|$|The {{interviewees}} {{discuss a}} variety of aspects about the U.S. prostitution trade itself such as their individual physical selling-points, attitudes held toward customers, and sexual turn-ons/offs. Self-identity and sexual orientation come up, with several of the men being [...] "gay for pay". Personal life challenges such as substance abuse and periods of homelessness are talked about as well. Several were molested as children; some men mention feelings of depression and segregation, such as one interviewee describing using drugs [...] "to {{deal with the fact}} that" [...] he's [...] "using intimacy as a commodity”. However, others protest the characterization as hurting or being made dirty.

5000|$|The most splendid First-Class {{accommodation}} on {{both the}} Titanic and the Olympic were the four parlor suites on B and C Decks, just off of the Grand Staircase. The two on B-Deck were advertised at [...] "Deluxe" [...] Parlor Suites, or Promenade Suites, because they each contained a 50 ft. (15.24 M.) private promenade deck. The promenade deck connected to the First-Class gangway entrances immediately forward, enabling the copious amounts of luggage usually carried by the Titanic's richest passengers to be loaded directly into their suites. The Parlor Suites each comprised two large bedrooms, two walk-in wardrobes, a private bathroom, lavatory, and a spacious sitting room. The sitting rooms were lavish rooms that allowed for receiving small parties of guests. Each featured a faux fireplace, <b>large</b> <b>card</b> table, plush sofas and chairs, sideboards, and writing desks.|$|E

Occasionally, particularly if the apparatus has been described with more ridiculous lavishness (with terms such as [...] "multiplex", [...] "digitally enhanced", etc.), Humph has added another joke based on its actually being a big card by saying it has been [...] "so generously funded by our hosts".|$|E

This IA makes use of a CPF2 style module.|$|R
5000|$|From the Francis book jacket: [...] David Stern says: [...] "When I {{joined the}} Army in 1943, I had been {{publishing}} {{a couple of}} newspapers. I told this to the classification interviewer, who dutifully recorded my civilian background on a <b>large</b> <b>card.</b> They say the Army always finds the job to fit the man. I was assigned as assistant on a garbage truck."Circumstances led me, via Officer Candidate School, to Hawaii, where I was assigned as Co-Officer-in-Charge of an Army newspaper called MIDPACIFICAN. One night I was sitting looking at a blank, unpainted wall. To pass the time I wrote four pages of dialogue between a second lieutenant and an Army mule. I {{had no intention of}} writing more. But that little runt of a mule kept bothering me. With memories of OCS fresh in my mind I thought I might rid myself of the creature by shipping him off to become a second lieutenant. Francis outwitted me. He refused to go". [...] Under the nom de plume of Peter Stirling, Stern wrote several short stories for Esquire about a nameless, brand-new U. S. Army 2nd lieutenant fighting the Japanese in the jungles of Burma. Following the war, he connected three of the stories, [...] "I Meet Francis", [...] "Francis and the Golden", and [...] "Francis Unmasked" [...] into the 1946 novel Francis.|$|E

40|$|China {{has one of}} {{the lowest}} levels of per capita milk {{consumption}} in the world, averaging just 5. 6 kilograms (kg) per year in 2003. Consumption varies greatly by region, income level, and household location (rural or urban). Throughout the mid- 1980 s and early 1990 s, milk consumption in urban China was stagnant, at about 4. 8 kg per person, and rural consumption hovered at just 0. 6 kg per person. While rural per capita consumption of dairy products grew weakly in the late 1990 s, urban consumption of fresh dairy products has grown an average of 25 percent annually since 1997, reaching 15. 7 kg per person in 2002. Household purchases of fluid milk, yogurt, milk powder, and ice cream are growing rapidly, and away-from-home consumption of cheese has risen with the tide of investment by western-style restaurant chains. The spectacular expansion of China’s urban market for dairy products is driven by a combination of technology adoption, changes in retail supply chains, consumer trends, income growth, and government policies. This article summarizes findings on Chinese urban dairy markets emanating from a <b>large</b> <b>CARD</b> research project that analyzes Asian dairy markets...|$|E
