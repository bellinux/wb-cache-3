40|$|An {{increase}} in trunk diseases (due to esca, Agrobacterium, rugose wood <b>virus,</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>roll</b> <b>viruses,</b> phytoplasma etc.) leading to young vines {{death is a}} very serious worry in vineyards in Hungary, as it is in other countries. In response to a demand expressed by grapevine growers, a method was tested for the direct treatment of pathogens in wood tissue. An experiment based on trunk injection was carried out in an esca infected vineyard. The various fungicides (propiconazole, difenoconazole, thiabendazole; propiconazole+ thiabendazole) were injected into the trunk before the beginning of the xylem sap flow at high pressure. As a result the number of symptomatic plants was decreased, and the vigour of the plants was not impaired by the fungicide ingredients.

2500|$|The {{leaves of}} Pinot Noir are {{generally}} smaller {{than those of}} Cabernet Sauvignon or Syrah. The Pinot vine is typically less vigorous than either of these varieties. The grape cluster is small and conico-cylindrical; shaped like a pine cone. Some viticultural historians believe this shape similarity may {{have given rise to}} the name. In the vineyard Pinot Noir is sensitive to wind and frost, cropping levels (it must be low yielding for production of quality wines), soil types and pruning techniques. In the winery it is sensitive to fermentation methods, yeast strains and is highly reflective of its terroir with different regions sometimes producing very different wines. Its thin skin makes it susceptible to bunch rot and similar fungal diseases. The vines themselves are susceptible to powdery mildew, especially in Burgundy infection by <b>leaf</b> <b>roll</b> and fanleaf <b>viruses</b> causes significant vine health problems. These complications have given the grape a reputation for being difficult to grow: Jancis Robinson calls Pinot a [...] "minx of a vine" [...] and André Tchelistcheff declared that [...] "God made Cabernet Sauvignon whereas the devil made Pinot Noir." [...] It is much less tolerant of harsh vineyard conditions than the likes of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Merlot or Grenache.|$|R
40|$|A mutant {{of tobacco}} mosaic virus, TMV-mutant 2 - 8, was {{isolated}} by selecting serially small local lesions on Nicotiana glutinosa leaves inoculated with the ordinary strain of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV-OM) {{that had been}} treated with nitrous acid.

The infectivity of the virus was lowered up to 14 per cent of TMV-OM after 32 days, when each virus was kept in the laboratory at room temperature. The virus was more resistant to UV irradiation than TMV-OM. The concentration of the virus in N. tabacum cv. Xanthi leaves was always {{lower than that of}} TMV-OM 24 - 72 hrs after inoculation.

40|$|Abstract We {{examined}} {{the potential of}} a common her-bivore to indirectly influence other diverse community members by providing habitat. Larvae of the leafroller Anacampsis niveopulvella commonly construct shelters by rolling leaves of cottonwood trees. These <b>leaf</b> <b>rolls</b> are later colonized by other arthropods. We first docu-mented 4 times greater species richness and 7 times greater abundance on cottonwood shoots that contained a <b>rolled</b> <b>leaf</b> compared to adjacent shoots without <b>leaf</b> <b>rolls.</b> Second, with both removal and addition experi-ments, we showed that <b>leaf</b> <b>rolls</b> are responsible for these differences in arthropod assemblages. <b>Leaf</b> <b>roll</b> removal caused a 5 -fold decline in richness and a 7 -fold decline in abundance; <b>leaf</b> <b>roll</b> addition resulted in a 2. 5 -fold in-crease in richness and a 6 -fold increase in abundance. Third, to determine whether rolled leaves are colonized for food or for shelter, we compared colonization of nat-ural and artificial <b>leaf</b> <b>rolls.</b> Both richness and abundance were approximately 2 -fold greater in artificial <b>leaf</b> <b>rolls,</b> indicating that <b>leaf</b> <b>rolls</b> are colonized primarily for shel-ter. Fourth, in a natural hybrid zone we found that leaf-roller densities were 2 -fold greater on backcross hybrids than on F 1 hybrids. These differences are likely associat-ed with genetically-based differences in leaf morphology and/or leaf chemistry. Ultimately, plant genotype affects positive indirect interactions that {{have the potential to}} af-fect community structure. This study and others demon-strate that shelter builders (i. e., leafrollers and gall for-mers) enhance biodiversity, while free-feeders are more likely to negatively affect biodiversity...|$|R

40|$|In 2012 and 2013, was {{studied the}} occurrence, biology and {{harmfulness}} of Byctiscus betulae (L.) (Rhynchitidae) on forest woody {{plants in the}} Brno region. <b>Leaf</b> <b>rolls</b> were found on 13 species (and 10 genera) of woody plants. Most frequently, they occurred on Fagus sylvatica, Tilia spp. (namely on T. cordata), Salix caprea and Populus tremula. The beetles hibernate in ground pupal chambers and appear on woody plants {{in the last decade}} of April. After hibernation, females live on average seven (males five) weeks, and damage on average 40 (males 25) cm 2 of leaves. The females create <b>leaf</b> <b>rolls</b> on annual shoots they have gnawed, exceptionally (in 2 %) on leaves with damaged petioles. In the rolls on F. sylvatica, they roll on average 5. 6 leaves whose total average area is 49. 5 cm 2 and lay on average 5. 1 eggs. In the rolls on Tilia spp., they roll on average 3. 3 leaves whose total area is 63. 2 cm 2 and lay on average 4. 9 eggs. In the rolls on S. caprea, they roll on average 3. 3 leaves whose total area is 38. 3 cm 2 and lay on average 3. 5 eggs. The maximum number of laid eggs (on average 8. 0) was observed in the <b>leaf</b> <b>rolls</b> on Vitis vinifera.

50|$|PLRV infects {{members of}} the Solanaceae family. The most {{economically}} important host is the Potato, Solanum tuberosum spp. In potato, symptoms of primary infection, infection in the growing season, occurs in the youngest leaves. Leaf margins become necrotic, turning brown and purplish and curl inwards towards {{the center of the}} leaf. Secondary infection, which starts from infected potato culls, produces more severe symptoms. Leaf rolling is more apparent and the entire leaf can become chlorotic and sometimes also has a purple discoloration. Necrosis of the phloem tissue particularly in the haulm is observed after onset of symptoms. Plants infected with PLRV experience stunted growth and produce smaller tubers. Infected tubers retain normal shape but experience necrosis of the vascular tissue. Necrosis of the tuber may not be apparent at harvest and can develop in storage. This usually appears as small brown spots scattered throughout the tissue.Net necrosis of potato is the result of infection by potato <b>leaf</b> <b>roll</b> <b>virus</b> (PLRV). This symptom is caused by the selective death and damage to cells in the vascular tissues of the tuber. The fact that only specific cells within the tuber are affected by this problem while others remain normal causes the characteristic net symptom. Infection by the virus may directly cause the damage to and death of the vascular tissues or the presence of the virus may make these sensitive tissues more susceptible to damage from other stresses. There is a strong resemblance between PLRV net necrosis and another tuber defect known as stem end discoloration (SED). Unlike PLRV, SED is believed to be a physiological disorder.|$|E

At lower altitudes, in lowland and hilly regions, where table potato production is widely distributed, more than 50 % of healthy plants become infected with potato virus Y during one growing season.

On the primary shoots of oaks (with relatively large leaves), the females rolled below‑average sized leaves. On the secondary shoots (with relatively small leaves), they rolled leaves of average to above‑average size. The female gnaws a deep mine into the main vein (in a third of its length) from the adaxial side first.
