40|$|Robustness of {{aircraft}} schedules {{is essential for}} an airline to improve on-time performance and accomplish high levels of consumer satisfaction. This paper addresses the question how airlines adjust their schedule robustness when market structure changes. To answer this question, the paper first recreates each flight’s ground buffer time using historical flight schedules and uses it as a measure for schedule robustness. Examining the relationship between ground buffers and market structure shows that there exists service quality competition in the airline market. Empirical estimations reveal that carriers adopt more robust flight schedules when airport concentration at the origin airport decreases, or when route competition increases. However, such an effect is slightly reduced for hub originating flights, as competitors trade off robust schedules for shorter <b>layover</b> <b>times</b> at the hubs when competition heats up...|$|R

40|$|Transit {{agencies}} have traditionally used manual data to measure performance and plan service, but many transit agencies now fulfill these tasks by using automated data collection systems (ADCS), including Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL), Automatic Passenger Counters (APC), and Automated Fare Collection (AFC) systems. ADCS enable service planners {{to make more}} informed decisions due to the larger, more ubiquitous, and timelier sets of performance data. This thesis evaluates current MBTA bus service in Somerville and Medford using several types of ADCS-based performance indicators. Route profiles are developed for each route {{in the study area}} and demand is analyzed for each route and its segments. Archived AVL running times are analyzed and recommendations are produced to improve reliability by adjusting the current scheduled running times where appropriate. This thesis evaluates several service planning scenarios using GIRO Inc. 's NetPlan software package, which is a sketch service planning and timetabling tool linked to its HASTUS automated scheduling system. The outputs of the ridership and running time analyses are used as inputs into bus service scenario planning process. The service change scenarios include implementing even, clock-face headways, utilizing interlining, improving the scheduled running <b>times</b> and <b>layover</b> <b>times,</b> modifying frequencies based on demand, synchronizing routes that serve the same route segments, and incorporating selected changes in routing. The number of buses required to serve each timetable scenario is the primary output of interest. This thesis finds that automated sketch service planning tools, such as NetPlan, can improve the efficiency of timetables by performing thousands of iterations that would otherwise be impractical. In the resource-constrained AM peak, timetabling inefficiencies in the existing schedule were reduced to improve reliability, increase frequencies, and modify routings. The peak period service frequency changes resulted in an expected net passenger wait time and scheduled delay savings of 165 hours. For the most comprehensive timetabling scenarios, interlining was found in 72 percent of the optimized vehicle blocks indicating that transit agencies can create timetables that use highly reliable cycle times and equitable headways based on current route ridership and cost considerations. by Matthew Thomas Shireman.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} the first {{analysis of the}} trade-off between convenient flight connections and airport congestion. A continuous spatial model illustrates this trade-off in a framework where a small gap between flight operating times raises congestion while also shortening a connecting passenger 2 ̆ 019 s <b>layover</b> <b>time.</b> When the passenger 2 ̆ 019 s cost per unit of <b>layover</b> <b>time</b> rises, the monopoly airline chooses to narrow the gap between its flights, yielding shorter layovers but more congestion. A discrete spatial model, where flights congest one another only if they operate in the same discrete period, makes this layover-cost effect discontinuous: the monopoly carrier concentrates (deconcentrates) its flights when this cost is high (low) relative to the costs of congestion. When fringe carriers are present, however, the hub carrier always concentrates its flights, either partially or fully. But {{the presence of a}} second hub carrier leads to an equilibrium mirroring the monopoly outcome: the carriers concentrate their flights in different periods when the layover cost is high and deconcentrate them otherwise. The paper also presents a welfare analysis, showing that movement from the equilibrium to the social optimum typically requires greater carrier separation...|$|E
30|$|However, {{as shown}} by [255], the total travel time between two {{successive}} stops, in both cases, increases. Indeed, eco-driving policies {{are based on the}} adoption of speed profiles which are far from those at maximum performance and thus provide a longer travel time. This means that they are feasible only if there is an extra time availability on a given line service. This time is generally known as reserve time. In order to clarify this concept, it is worth analysing the different time rates concerning the timetable design phase. As stated above, this task involves the computation of running times between two stops, dwell times at stations for the boarding/alighting process, buffer times and layover times. Buffer times are generally set up during the design phase in order to address possible delays or, simply, eventual fluctuations which can occur during the service, given the stochasticity of the phenomenon being examined. Suffice it to think, for instance, that inevitably every train driver drives in his/her own way, but even the same train driver might drive in two different ways on two different days. Obviously, the lower the level of automation, the higher the relevance of the stochastic nature of the factors involved. The <b>layover</b> <b>time</b> is the time spent by the convoy at the terminus. The minimum <b>layover</b> <b>time</b> is represented by the inversion time and possibly by the time required for possible shunting. Moreover, there could be an additional time interval between when the convoy is physically ready to undertake the run in the opposite direction and when it can actually depart according to the timetable indications. However, in certain cases, the term <b>layover</b> <b>time</b> indicates only this further time rate, while the inversion time is computed in the cycle time. For the sake of completeness, also synchronisation times, for making transfer options available for passengers, can be taken into account. Hence, the above-mentioned extra time availability could involve running time reserve, dwell time reserve, buffer time, and time exceeding the <b>layover</b> <b>time</b> at the terminus, if any. These times are properly scheduled during the timetable design phase by increasing the minimum times required for the service. For example, as for travel time, the International Union of Railways (UIC) suggested increasing the minimum travel time by 3 – 8 %. Obviously, the possibility of exploiting these extra times, for implementing such energy-saving strategies, is subject to the preservation of timetable stability and service quality. Therefore, the identification of an analytical framework for reliably quantifying the timetable rates involved in implementing energy-saving strategies, as well as defining optimisation models taking into account the trade-off between eco-driving profiles and passenger needs, proves fundamental [262]. Moreover, in a rail context, ES strategies are commonly implemented between two successive stops, while in a metro context the most suitable approach consists in examining the whole outward and return trip, {{given the fact that the}} service is frequency based, which means that the parameter to be respected is the headway between two successive convoys, rather than a timetable, generally unknown to users. Therefore, in the case of metro systems, the energy-saving strategies are generally implemented by considering arrival and departure times at the terminus, rather than at each station [255].|$|E
40|$|The DLR Institute of Aerospace Medicine {{evaluated}} pilots’ sleep {{pattern on}} long-haul flights. Several field studies revealed a shortened sleep duration, {{which was one}} part, caused by crossing time zones and the consequent jet-lag the other by short and unfavorable <b>layover</b> <b>times.</b> Similar field {{studies were carried out}} on helicopter pilots occupied in air ambulance services. They showed significantly shorter sleep durations during the days of work than in leisure time. However short sleep duration can influence the alertness and performance of the air crew and thus lead to a risk for flight safety. There is therefore a need for an adaption to the requirements of the crew, with the aim of preventing sleep disorders and the resulting loss of performance. The present study examined to what extent a shortened sleep duration for several days has an impact on the performance. Under laboratory conditions trial participants experienced four consecutive days of partial sleep deprivation (sleep duration of 5 h) as a parameter influencing the performance compared with the effect of hypoxia and alcohol as stressors. The measurement of performance was carried out with computerized testing, as the AGARD-STRES-Battery (AGARD Standardized Tests for Research with Environmental Stressors Battery) published by a NATO committee. As results the unstable tracking (UTT) and the simple reaction task (SRT) proved to be particularly sensitive in contrast to grammatical reasoning (GRT) and the memory search (MST) tasks. For different stressors the task, which is the strongest indicator of the effect on performance, could be determined. Compared to the base line performance under normal conditions the effect of oxygen deficiency (11. 5 % O 2) was 41 % in UTT and 9 % in the SRT, alcohol (0. 7 ‰) contributed to a decline of 29 % in UTT and 17 % in the SRT, and three nights of sleep deprivation lead to a loss of 21 % in UTT and 9 % in the SRT. As a simple rule it can be stated that three days of sleep deprivation, or hypoxia 12 % O 2 induced a performance reduction similar 0. 5 ‰ alcohol.

40|$|How flight crews {{organize}} their sleep during layovers on long-haul trips is documented. Additionally, environmental and physiological constraints on sleep are examined. In the trips studied, duty periods averaging 10. 3 hr alternated with layovers averaging 24. 8 hr, which typically included two subject-defined sleep episodes. The circadian system {{had a greater}} influence on the timing and duration of first-sleeps than second-sleeps. There was also a preference for sleeping during the local night. The time of falling asleep for second-sleeps was related primarily {{to the amount of}} sleep already obtained in the layover, and their duration depended on the amount of time remaining in the layover.

Sleep was recorded using a self-report sleep diary and wrist activity monitor; subjective fatigue level was measured using the Samn-Perelli Fatigue Checklist; and sustained attention was assessed using the psychomotor vigilance task for a personal digital assistant (PalmPVT). Mixed-model regression analyses were used to determine the effects of layover length (short, long) on the amount of sleep that pilots obtained during the trip, and on the pilots' subjective fatigue levels and capacity to sustain attention. There was no main effect of layover length on ground-based sleep or in-flight sleep, but pilots who had a short layover at the midpoint of their trip had higher subjective fatigue levels and poorer sustained attention than pilots who had a long layover. The results of this study indicate that a short layover during a long-haul trip does not substantially disrupt pilots' sleep, but it may result in elevated levels of fatigue during and after the trip. If short layovers are used, pilots should have a minimum of 4 d off to recover prior to their next long-haul trip...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with routing and scheduling patrol assets to provide coverage of a pre-defined set of patrol regions. Two patrol routing and scheduling problems are studied: the Patrol Boat Scheduling Problem with Complete Coverage (PBSPCC) and the Maximum Covering and Patrol Routing Problem (MCPRP). The PBSPCC utilizes a patrol boat fleet to provide complete coverage {{of a set of}} maritime patrol regions, ensuring that {{there is at least one}} boat on station in each patrol region at any given time. This requirement is complicated by the fact that the boats cannot maintain patrol duties indefinitely. Before a maximum operational time has expired, a boat must return to port for a mandatory resource replenishment break, which may be required for crew <b>layover</b> <b>time</b> or refuelling. The PBSPCC is addressed by considering the operational performance of the patrol boats, the network topology, and the duration of a resource replenishment break. An additional aspect to the problem is to find the minimum number of patrol boats which can meet the complete coverage requirement indefinitely. The MCPRP {{is concerned with}} routing a fleet of patrol cars to provide maximum coverage of a set of accident hotspots on a road network, where each hotspot is given by a geographical location and a time window. The patrol cars maintain active duty over a pre-defined shift, with each car beginning and ending its shift at a depot. The objective is to maximize the aggregate presence of the patrol cars within the time windows, without double-counting of the patrol effort. This problem has received recent attention in the literature with the application of linear and integer programming models. We present new modelling and algorithmic approaches to address the aforementioned patrol coverage problems. The approaches are underpinned by specially tailored network design principles, Dantzig-Wolfe column generation, branch-and-price heuristics and various problem reduction techniques. We introduce a number of benchmark test instances for both the PBSPCC and MCPRP on which various column generation acceleration strategies are compared and analysed. The results for the PBSPCC indicate that our techniques can exploit certain problem structures to achieve optimal and good quality cyclic schedules in reasonable timeframes. For the MCPRP, the results show that a branch-and-price approach can be used to solve large-scale problem instances that cannot be handled by extant techniques...|$|E
