2500|$|A weed is a plant {{considered}} undesirable in {{a particular}} situation, [...] "a plant in the wrong place". Examples commonly are plants unwanted in human-controlled settings, such as farm fields, gardens, lawns, and parks. Taxonomically, the term [...] "weed" [...] has no botanical significance, because a plant that is a weed in one context is not a weed when growing {{in a situation where}} it is in fact wanted, and where one species of plant is a valuable crop plant, another species in the same genus might be a serious weed, such as a wild bramble growing among cultivated <b>loganberries.</b> Many plants that people widely regard as weeds also are intentionally grown in gardens and other cultivated settings, in which case they are sometimes called beneficial weeds. The term weed also is applied to any plant that grows or reproduces aggressively, or is invasive outside its native habitat. More broadly [...] "weed" [...] occasionally is applied pejoratively to species outside the plant kingdom, species that can survive in diverse environments and reproduce quickly; in this sense it has even been applied to humans.|$|E
2500|$|Only {{about one}} quarter of the land is under {{cultivation}} – mainly in cereals. Barley, wheat and potatoes are grown in eastern parts of Scotland such as Aberdeenshire, Moray, Highland, Fife and the Scottish Borders. The Tayside and Angus area is a centre of production of soft fruits such as strawberries, raspberries and <b>loganberries,</b> owing to the mild climate. [...] Sheep raising is important in the less arable mountainous regions, such as the northwest of Scotland which are used for rough grazing, due to its geographical isolation, poor climate and acidic soils. Parts of the east of Scotland (areas such as Aberdeenshire, Fife and Angus) are major centres of cereal production and general cropping. In such areas, the land is generally flatter, coastal, and the climate less harsh, and more suited to cultivation. The south-west of Scotland – principally Ayrshire and Dumfries and Galloway – is a centre of dairying. Agriculture, especially cropping in Scotland, is highly mechanised and generally efficient. Farms tend to cover larger areas than their European counterparts. Hill farming is also prominent in the Southern Uplands in the south of Scotland, resulting in the production of wool, lamb and mutton. Cattle-Rearing particularly in the east and south of Scotland results in the production of large amounts of beef. Farming in Scotland was affected by BSE and the European ban on the importation of British beef from 1996. Dairy and Cattle farmers in south-west Scotland were affected by the 2001 UK Foot and Mouth outbreak, which resulted in the destruction of much of their livestock as part of the biosecurity effort to control the spread of the disease.|$|E

The Youngberry was introduced commercially in 1926 and quickly came to rival <b>Loganberries.</b> The Youngberry had excellent qualities, such as taste and high yields, and it soon replaced the Loganberry of California.|$|E
50|$|Loganberry {{plants are}} sturdy and more disease- and {{frost-resistant}} {{than many other}} berries. However, they are not very popular with commercial growers due to several problems which increase labor costs, since the plants tend to be thorny and the berries are often hidden by the leaves. Additionally, berries of varying maturity may grow on a single plant, {{making it difficult to}} completely harvest each plant. <b>Loganberries</b> are therefore more commonly grown in household gardens.|$|E

5000|$|Due to {{its high}} vitamin C content, the {{loganberry}} {{was used by}} the British navy {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century as a source of vitamin C to prevent sailors from getting scurvy, in much the same way as the British did with limes during the late 18th century (hence the American term for the British, [...] "limey").

5000|$|Logan was {{unsatisfied}} {{with the}} existing varieties of blackberries and tried crossing two varieties of blackberries to produce a superior cultivar. He happened to plant them next to plants of an old variety of red raspberry, 'Red Antwerp', all of which flowered and fruited together. The two blackberry cultivars involved in these experiments were probably 'Aughinbaugh' and 'Texas Early' (a cultivar of Rubus velox), which {{were two of the}} three varieties that Logan had planted in his yard that year. Logan then gathered and planted the seed from his cross-bred plants. His 50 seedlings produced plants similar to the blackberry parent 'Aughinbaugh', but larger and more vigorous. One was the Loganberry; the others included the 'Mammoth' blackberry. Since Logan's time, crosses between the cultivars of raspberry and blackberry have confirmed the <b>Loganberry's</b> parentage, with an earlier theory that the <b>Loganberry</b> originated as a red-fruiting form of the common Californian blackberry Rubus ursinus now disproved. [...] Progeny from Logan's original plant was introduced to Europe in 1897. A prickle-free mutation of the <b>Loganberry,</b> the 'American Thornless', was developed in 1933.|$|R
