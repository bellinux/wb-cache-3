The scenes at the house were shot separately; those occurring in 1998 were shot first and those occurring in the past were shot after the crew had spent a week renovating the house. Hasiholan <b>later</b> <b>recalled</b> that Soeriaatmadja was a controlling director who told the actors exactly what he wanted in a clear manner.
