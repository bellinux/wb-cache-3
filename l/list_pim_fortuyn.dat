2500|$|Wilhelmus Simon Petrus Fortuijn, {{known as}} <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn</b> ( [...] ; 19 February 1948– 6 May 2002), was a Dutch politician, civil servant, sociologist, author and {{professor}} who formed his own party, <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn</b> <b>List</b> (Lijst <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn</b> or LPF) in 2002.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn</b> <b>List</b> (Lijst <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn,</b> LPF) was {{a right-wing}} populist {{political}} {{party in the}} Netherlands. The eponymous founder of the party was <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn,</b> a charismatic former university professor and political columnist who initially had planned to contest the 2002 general election {{as leader of the}} Livable Netherlands (LN) party. He was however dismissed as party leader in February 2002 due to controversial remarks he made in a newspaper interview on immigration-related issues, and instead founded LPF a few days later. After gaining support in opinion polls, Fortuyn was assassinated on 6 May 2002, nine days before the election. The party held onto its support, and {{went on to become the}} second-largest party in the election.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to look at how the <b>List</b> <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn</b> (LPF) became the second largest party in the Dutch lower house, if for only a short time, by {{identifying}} six primary causes: pre-September 11, 2001 malaise; the aftermath of September 11; the local elections in Rotterdam in March 2002; the personality of Pim Fortuyn; the failings of the major parties; and Fortuyn's assassination. I will also look at how the coalition collapsed and why the LPF was routed in the recent parliamentary elections on January 23, 2003. I conclude by examining the possible future of rightist populism in the Netherlands. I begin with a brief history of the LPF...|$|E

The Netherlands {{was for a long}} time considered a deviant or negative case, as no radical right-wing populist party had obtained more than three percent of the vote. In Holland radical right-wing populist parties failed despite that the political and economic situation during the 1990 s were characterized by some of the factors usually depicted as crucial for the emergence of radical right-wing populist parties elsewhere. However, the immigration issue did not become a salient, politicised issue until 2002 —when Pim Fortuyn emphasized it in his election campaign, and when other political actors felt forced to take it up as well...|$|E

Only the smaller orthodox-Calvinist parties, some smaller left-wing parties, and, more recently, the <b>List</b> <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn</b> (LPF) have opposed these treaties in parliament.

40|$|A BSTRACT Large {{differences}} exist between socio-cultural specialists and technocrats {{in the extent}} they voted for the <b>List</b> <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn</b> (LPF), showing us that support for the party was aligned by social class. Distinguishing between the two specialist types provided the opportunity to test Kitschelt’s hypothesis {{on the importance of}} communicative experiences and capabilities in the labour market and the importance of cultural and economic ethnic threats. Cultural ethnic threat explains social class differences in LPF voting better than economic ethnic threat, though we cannot claim that the latter is of no relevance. We show this using the Dutch sample of the European Social Survey (n = 2, 260). Moreover, we show that sociopolitical attitudes that affect voting for the LPF do so to a much smaller extent among lowereducated people and non-socio-cultural specialists. The interactions between socio-political attitudes and education and social class are significant. ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{provides}} an explanatory {{framework for the}} electoral performance of populist parties, using the Netherlands as a case study. The Netherlands is an ideal case, as several populist parties have entered the political scene in recent years with varying levels of electoral success. The most notable cases are the <b>List</b> <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn</b> and Geert Wilders' Freedom Party. Whereas the former party did not sustain, Geert Wilders has, so far, managed to remain an important force in Dutch politics. The article argues that the performance of populist parties is dependent {{on a combination of}} causal conditions: the availability of the electorate, the responsiveness of established parties and the supply of credible populist challengers. As will be argued, especially this latter factor is vital to the (long-term) performance of populist parties. Further research should, therefore, not refrain from taking the agency of populist parties themselves into account...|$|E
40|$|A {{commonly}} heard {{explanation of}} the results of the May 2002 parliamentary election is that the vote changes occurred because of a shift to the right within the electorate. Previously published results are summarized here to show that this hypothesis must be rejected. Instead, a second hypothesis is formulated which explains the vote shifts in terms of the new calculations that voters were forced to make when a new, credible party entered the electoral marketplace. The analysis here presents empirical support for this hypothesis by demonstrating that voters were aware of the positions taken by the <b>List</b> <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn</b> (LPF), especially on those issues that Pim Fortuyn had placed at the forefront of the political agenda. Voters clearly saw the LPF as a party of the right on these issues. The positions that are perceived to have been taken by the electorate in the eyes of the voter are as important as the positions taken by the voters themselves in understanding the May 2002 results...|$|E

50|$|Livable Rotterdam (Leefbaar Rotterdam) {{is a local}} {{political}} party in the municipality of Rotterdam in the Netherlands, which was founded by Ronald Sørensen in 2001.

40|$|The electoral {{success of}} Jean-Marie Le Pen in France and (the late) Pim Formyn in the Netherlands has sparked {{immediate}} speculation that ‘the right' {{is coming back}} into vogue in Europe. Such speculation assumes that the right-left dichotomy is important to understanding the success of groups like the Front National or the <b>List</b> <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn.</b> We disagree. Using examples from across Europe, we argue that these groups are more characteristically populist than right-wing; that their stance {{on the structure of}} political participation is more important to their success than the position they take on distributive concerns; and that programmatic inconsistency is less critical than performance contradiction to their survival in power. Our argument is only slightly at odds with the existing literature, but even this slight change of emphasis- from policy or distributive outcomes to political or participatory process- can offer substantial analytic rewards. By focusing attention on the process elements in populist political programs we can not only anticipate the fare of those movements, but also shed light on the larger political systems within which they operate...|$|E
40|$|The <b>List</b> <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn</b> (LPF) {{is a key}} {{example of}} a family of new right-wing parties that, {{according}} to many observers, have had a strong effect on European party systems. This article studies the effect of the entry of the LPF into the Dutch Parliament on the parliamentary party system. The article looks at two aspects of the party system: first, did the LPF affect the issue agenda of the legislature? And second, has the LPF been able to create a new significant line of conflict in the legislature, as Kriesi and Frey and Pellikaan et al observed for the electoral arena? Or, as Van der Brug and Bale have proposed, is the Dutch party system after Fortuyn essentially one-dimensional? The study looks at new, behavioral, data from the Dutch legislature: parliamentary voting behavior and the sponsorship of motions, to answer these questions. It employs Poole's Open Classification method to understand the patterns underlying voting behavior. Acta Politico (2011) 46, 400 - 424. doi: 10. 1057 /ap. 2011. 1...|$|E

The 2002 elections were marked by large losses for the liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy and the social democratic Labour Party. Both parties replaced their leaders shortly after the election. The <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn</b> <b>List</b> and the Christian Democratic Appeal made significant gains.

40|$|The 2002 {{parliamentary}} {{election in the}} Netherlands will always {{be associated with the}} name of Pim Fortuyn. His murder only nine days before the election was the first political assassination in the Netherlands in more than 300 years. The sudden success of the new party he had founded, coupled with the major losses for the Labour and Liberal parties, made this an historic election. This article attempts to understand the motivations of the voters at this election, in particular the voters of the <b>List</b> <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn</b> (LPF). It is first shown that the conventional wisdom, which assumes voting based on religion and social class, and voting along ideological issue lines, has lost its ability to explain voter behaviour in the Netherlands. An explanation based on retrospective economic voting is also rejected. The success of the LPF is accounted for by the popularity of Fortuyn and his appeal among those who had cynical attitudes towards government or who were dissatisfied with the performance of the incumbent government. The popularity of Fortuyn is shown to have been related to political issues, in particular those relating to asylum seekers and the integration of foreigners in the country...|$|E
40|$|Scholarly {{accounts}} of the dramatic breakthrough of the <b>List</b> <b>Pim</b> <b>Fortuyn</b> (LPF) in the 2002 Dutch parliamentary election have emphasized two structural factors behind the success of that party. It has first been argued that the LPF brought a distinct issue profile to the electoral arena, which made it attractive for voters with similar policy views. The second hypothesis, that feelings of discontent with politics also fuelled support for the LPF, remains contested because of the possible endogeneity bias of cynicism attitudes. We re-examine these questions using survey data from the 1998 to 2002 panel of the Dutch Parliamentary Election Study. Our approach’s novelty is to link respondents’ 2002 vote choice to their issue priorities and cynical attitudes as measured in the 1998 wave of the panel. The findings suggest that policy preferences and, to a lesser extent, attitudes of political discontent both contributed to the LPF vote, thus providing support for both interpretations {{of the rise of}} this party. These results are consistent with most existing works on non-established party voting which show that new salient political issues and a lack of confidence towards government and politics are fertile ground for these party movements...|$|E
