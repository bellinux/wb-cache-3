40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{iterative}} algorithm that computes the camera path of long image sequences. It consists in applying successive bundle adjustment phases on di erent {{segments of the}} image sequence. The local models thus obtained are merged together into a common reference frame. The procedure is then repeated on a new grouping of the cameras, until the reconstruction error has reached a given error tolerance. The main objective is to ensure the scalability of the reconstruction and the good convergence of the bundle adjustment process by imposing a limit {{on the number of}} views for which the structure and motion parameters have to be simultaneously optimized. Error accumulation is also prevented by exploiting the presence of <b>loopbacks</b> and intersections in the camera path. We show results obtained over di erent camera paths, in particular a spiral path and snake-like path...|$|R
40|$|A {{model of}} social work {{grounded}} in {{the integration of the}} social sciences is presented. In social work with children this is exemplified by the importance of difficult childhood temperament and the goodness of fit between parenting practices in the evolution of conduct disorders. A professional model in which the social worker is an equal status member of a cooperative team of professionals engaged in treatment and research is stressed. The basis for this model {{of social work}} is that of the person-in-environment in which <b>loopbacks</b> from the child’s environment reinforce or diminish the evolution of conduct disorder in the process of spiralling down or spiralling up. This process is illustrated by two extensive case histories. In one the spiralling down process has been checked through intensive social work inputs. Nevertheless, in a longitudinal study it is shown that without such interventions difficult temperament observed at age 3 has significant links to conduct disorders, and movement into care or institutional life at age 17. Severe conduct disorders which lead to permanent school exclusion are likely to be expensive...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a novel algorithm to iteratively compute camera paths of long image sequences. Scale Invariant Features are first {{extracted from the}} ordered set of images. These images are then matched pair-wise sequentially and correspondences are computed. An initial geometric path is found after by applying a bundle adjustment algorithm on these correspondences. Distances between cameras are computed from this initial estimation. The iteration process starts by grouping nearby cameras and then bundle adjusting the groups, and ends by merging the groups. This process is repeated until the reprojection errors fall into the preset tolerance. The key point in this algorithm is {{to take advantage of}} <b>loopbacks</b> in the image sequences. We have obtained excellent results for two camera paths, namely the spiral path and the snake like path. Our algorithm achieves both precise and stable results. ii Acknowledgments Firstly, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Dr. Robert Laganière for being a great supervisor and mentor during my graduate studies.

50|$|Loop-back (LB): Loop-back {{messages}} {{otherwise known}} as MAC ping are Unicast frames that a MEP transmits, they are similar in concept to an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Echo (Ping) messages, sending <b>Loopback</b> to successive MIPs can determine {{the location of a}} fault. Sending a high volume of <b>Loopback</b> Messages can test bandwidth, reliability, or jitter of a service, which is similar to flood ping.

50|$|Another {{technique}} called the generalized <b>loopback</b> technique can be included under ring-based approaches.
