40|$|Problems of data {{classification}} {{can be studied}} {{in the framework of}} regularization theory as ill-posed problems. In this framework, <b>loss</b> functions {{play an important role in}} the application of regularization theory to classification. In this paper, we review some important convex <b>loss</b> functions, including hinge <b>loss,</b> square <b>loss,</b> modified square <b>loss,</b> exponential <b>loss,</b> logistic regression <b>loss,</b> as well as some non-convex <b>loss</b> functions, such as sigmoid <b>loss,</b> φ-loss, ramp <b>loss,</b> normalized sigmoid <b>loss,</b> and the <b>loss</b> function of 2 layer neural network. Based on the analysis of these <b>loss</b> functions, we propose a new differentiable nonconvex <b>loss</b> function, called smoothed 0 - 1 <b>loss</b> function, which is a natural approximation of the 0 - 1 <b>loss</b> function. To compare the performance of different <b>loss</b> functions, we propose two binary classification algorithms for binary classification, one for convex <b>loss</b> functions, the other for non-convex <b>loss</b> functions. A set of experiments are launched on several binary data sets from the UCI repository.

5|$|<b>Losses</b> for 12 July are {{difficult}} to establish for either combatant. Tank <b>losses</b> attributed to the German side vary, {{in part due to}} the Wehrmacht's methodology for counting and reporting equipment <b>losses.</b> Only equipment that could not be repaired or that had to be abandoned were counted as <b>losses,</b> but damaged equipment that could be recovered and repaired were simply listed as such.

5|$|<b>Losses</b> had {{remained}} stable since the 1990s at 17–20% per year attributable {{to a variety}} of factors, such as mites, diseases, and management stress. The first report of CCD was in mid-November 2006 by a Pennsylvania beekeeper overwintering in Florida. By February 2007, large commercial migratory beekeepers wintering in California, Florida, Oklahoma, and Texas had reported heavy <b>losses</b> associated with CCD. Their reports of <b>losses</b> varied widely, ranging from 30% to 90% of their bee colonies; in some cases, beekeepers reported <b>losses</b> of nearly all of their colonies with surviving colonies so weakened that they might {{no longer be able to}} pollinate or produce honey.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new surrogate <b>loss</b> function called orbit <b>loss</b> in the structured prediction framework, which has good theoretical and practical advantages. While the orbit <b>loss</b> is not convex, it has a simple analytical gradient and a simple perceptron-like learning rule. We analyze the new <b>loss</b> theoretically and state a PAC-Bayesian generalization bound. We also prove that the new <b>loss</b> is consistent in the strong sense; namely, the risk achieved by {{the set of the}} trained parameters approaches the infimum risk achievable by any linear decoder over the given features. Methods that are aimed at risk minimization, such as the structured ramp <b>loss,</b> the structured probit <b>loss</b> and the direct <b>loss</b> minimization require at least two inference operations per training iteration. In this sense, the orbit <b>loss</b> is more efficient as it requires only one inference operation per training iteration, while yields similar performance. We conclude the paper with an empirical comparison of the proposed <b>loss</b> function to the structured hinge <b>loss,</b> the structured ramp <b>loss,</b> the structured probit <b>loss</b> and the direct <b>loss</b> minimization method on several benchmark datasets and tasks...|$|R
40|$|In many applications, the {{training}} data, from which {{one needs to}} learn a classifier, is corrupted with label noise. Many standard algorithms such as SVM perform poorly in presence of label noise. In this paper we investigate the robustness of risk minimization to label noise. We prove a sufficient condition on a <b>loss</b> function for the risk minimization under that <b>loss</b> to be tolerant to uniform label noise. We show that the $ 0 - 1 $ <b>loss,</b> sigmoid <b>loss,</b> ramp <b>loss</b> and probit <b>loss</b> satisfy this condition though none of the standard convex <b>loss</b> functions satisfy it. We also prove that, by choosing a sufficiently large value of a parameter in the <b>loss</b> function, the sigmoid <b>loss,</b> ramp <b>loss</b> and probit <b>loss</b> can be made tolerant to non-uniform label noise also if we can assume the classes to be separable under noise-free data distribution. Through extensive empirical studies, we show that risk minimization under the $ 0 - 1 $ <b>loss,</b> the sigmoid <b>loss</b> and the ramp <b>loss</b> has much better robustness to label noise {{when compared to the}} SVM algorithm...|$|R
40|$|The Multidimensional <b>Loss</b> Scale: Initial Development and Psychometric Evaluation The Multidimensional <b>Loss</b> Scale (MLS) {{represents}} the first instrument {{designed specifically to}} measure <b>loss</b> in refugee populations. Researchers developed initial items of the Multidimensional <b>Loss</b> Scale to assess Experience of <b>Loss</b> Events and <b>Loss</b> Distress in a culturally sensitive manner across multiple domains (social, material, intra-personal and cultural). A sample of 70 recently settled Burmese adult refugees completed a battery of questionnaires, including new scale items.

Principal Axis Factoring supported a five-factor model: <b>Loss</b> of Symbolic Self, <b>Loss</b> of Interdependence, <b>Loss</b> of Home, Interpersonal <b>Loss,</b> and <b>Loss</b> of Intrapersonal Integrity. Chronbach’s Alphas indicated satisfactory internal consistency for Experience of <b>Loss</b> Events (. 85) and <b>Loss</b> Distress (. 92).
