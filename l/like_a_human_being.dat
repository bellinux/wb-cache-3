5000|$|I {{thought that}} playing Chitti the robot {{would be very}} difficult. He is a machine. His {{movements}} should not be <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>being's.</b> We had to draw a line. If I deviated even slightly, Shankar would point it out and say I was <b>being</b> too <b>human.</b> After four to five days of shooting, we found a rhythm. — Rajinikanth, on his experience of playing the character of Chitti.|$|R

25|$|Poor old Keeper, Emily's {{faithful}} {{friend and}} worshipper, {{seemed to understand}} her <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>being.</b> One evening, when the four friends were sitting closely round {{the fire in the}} sitting-room, Keeper forced himself in between Charlotte and Emily and mounted himself on Emily’s lap; finding the space too limited for his comfort he pressed himself forward on to the guest’s knees, making himself quite comfortable. Emily’s heart was won by the unresisting endurance of the visitor, little guessing that she herself, being in close contact, was the inspiring cause of submission to Keeper’s preference. Sometimes Emily would delight in showing off Keeper—make him frantic in action, and roar with the voice of a lion. It was a terrifying exhibition within the walls of an ordinary sitting-room. Keeper was a solemn mourner at Emily’s funeral and never recovered his cheerfulness.|$|E
500|$|Many {{philosophers}} consider {{experience to}} be the essence of consciousness, and believe that experience can only fully be known from the inside, subjectively. [...] But if consciousness is subjective and not visible from the outside, why do {{the vast majority of}} people believe that other people are conscious, but rocks and trees are not? [...] This is called the problem of other minds. [...] It is particularly acute for people who believe in the possibility of philosophical zombies, that is, people who think it is possible in principle to have an entity that is physically indistinguishable from a human being and behaves <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>being</b> in every way but nevertheless lacks consciousness. Related issues have also been studied extensively by Greg Littmann of the University of Illinois. and Colin Allen a professor at Indiana University regarding the literature and research studying artificial intelligence in androids.|$|E
500|$|Dykstra {{said the}} biggest {{difficulty}} of creating Spider-Man was {{that as the}} character was masked, it immediately {{lost a lot of}} characterization. Without the context of eyes or mouth, a lot of body language had to be put in so that there would be emotional content. Raimi wanted to convey the essence of Spider-Man as being, [...] "the transition that occurs between him being a young man going through puberty and being a superhero." [...] Dykstra said his crew of animators had never reached such a level of sophistication to give subtle hints of still making Spider-Man feel <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>being.</b> When two studio executives were shown shots of the computer generated character, they believed it was actually Maguire performing stunts. In addition, Dykstra's crew had to composite areas of New York City and replaced every car in shots with digital models. Raimi did not want it to feel entirely like animation, so none of the shots were 100% computer generated.|$|E

50|$|Black Tom (Black Tom Cassidy): Black Tom's {{original}} mutation {{allowed him}} to look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> normal <b>human</b> <b>being</b> with <b>an</b> ability to channel concussive blasts from wood. However, in Chuck Austen's Dominant Species storyline, Black Tom suffered a secondary mutation that left him as a half-plant creature with a lost sense of humanity.|$|R
500|$|Lee {{found that}} in {{contrast}} to Chinese cinema, he had to dissuade many of the actors from using a [...] "very stagy, very English tradition. Instead of just being observed <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>being</b> and getting sympathy, {{they feel they have}} to do things, they have to carry the movie." [...] Grant in particular often had to be restrained from giving an [...] "over-the-top" [...] performance; Lee later recalled that the actor is [...] "a show stealer. You can't stop that. I let him do, I have to say, less 'star' stuff, the Hugh Grant thing... and not [...] the movie serve him, which is probably what he's used to now." [...] For the scene in which Elinor learns Edward is unmarried, Thompson found inspiration from her reaction to her father's death. Grant had been unaware that Thompson would cry through most of his speech, and the actress attempted to reassure him, [...] "'There's no other way, and I promise you it'll work, and it will be funny as well as being touching.' And he said, 'Oh, all right,' and he was very good about it". Lee had one demand for the scene, that Thompson avoid the temptation to turn her head towards the camera.|$|E
2500|$|The Turing test {{does not}} {{directly}} test whether the computer behaves intelligently. It tests only whether the computer behaves <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>being.</b> Since human behaviour and intelligent behaviour are {{not exactly the same}} thing, the test can fail to accurately measure intelligence in two ways: ...|$|E
2500|$|Dennett's reply {{from natural}} selection:Suppose that, by some mutation, {{a human being}} is born {{that does not have}} Searle's [...] "causal properties" [...] but {{nevertheless}} acts exactly <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>being.</b> (This sort of animal is called a [...] "zombie" [...] in thought experiments in the philosophy of mind). This new animal would reproduce just as any other human and eventually there would be more of these zombies. Natural selection would favor the zombies, since their design is (we could suppose) a bit simpler. Eventually the humans would die out. So therefore, if Searle is right, it is most likely that human beings (as we see them today) are actually [...] "zombies", who nevertheless insist they are conscious. It is impossible to know whether we are all zombies or not. Even if we are all zombies, we would still believe that we are not.|$|E
50|$|As time passes, the undead creatures become {{increasingly}} sensitive to sunlight, and {{even begin to}} suffer damage from it.

40|$|By {{establishing}} {{a link between}} Homer's, Hesiod's and Empedocles' similar textual expressions, we are allotted to assert that the fourth line of Empedocles' fragment 115 (FVS 31) is authentic. We must read the first words of this line so: This emendation of Empedocles' text implies that the guilty god (or man or Blessed) whom Empedocles' fragment mentions, is not urged by an (positive or negative) outside element, nor is deceived by a god or a man, acts quite willingly and like the Hatred to which he adheres, and behaves <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>human</b> <b>being.</b> However he differs from the disloyal man; for, once punished and cleansed, he is allotted {{to go back to}} the society of the Gods or the Blessed, whereas the disloyal man becomes blind or dies, as the myth of the Sicilian Palici testifies. Empedocles refers to this myth when he is speaking over the goddess Nestis. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
60|$|Let us, then, {{look at this}} matter, {{along with}} some {{interesting}} items contingent. Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their gills, the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times is combined with the element in which they swim; hence, a herring or a cod might live a century, and never once raise its head above the surface. But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him regular lungs, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>being's,</b> the whale can only live by inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere. Wherefore the necessity for his periodical visits to the upper world. But he cannot in any degree breathe through his mouth, for, in his ordinary attitude, the Sperm Whale's mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the surface; and what is still more, his windpipe has no connexion with his mouth. No, he breathes through his spiracle alone; and this is {{on the top of}} his head.|$|R

It is shown that a person’s depressive symptoms {{are similar to those}} of cities. The city identity necessary to resist depression can be searched for both historically and geographically. The historical aspect consists of local myths and legends about the city and the citizens. The geographical aspect of identity comprises features of the terrain, climate, flora and fauna of the region where the city is located. </p...|$|R
