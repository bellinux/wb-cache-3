40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{findings from}} field performance testing of five thermal distribution systems in four light commercial buildings. The systems studied {{are located in}} Sacramento and Pleasanton, California, and are connected to typical rooftop packaged units serving small office spaces. All of the buildings are single-story office-buildings with floor areas less than 1, 000 m 2. The field study included distribution system characterization of the five duct systems, and short-term refrigerant-side monitoring {{on two of the}} packaged units. The air leakage results are presented in terms of specific effective leakage areas (ELAs), the ASHRAE-defined duct <b>leakage</b> <b>classes,</b> <b>leakage</b> flowrate (from flow subtraction or derived from ELA and operating pressures), and air leakage ratios (i. e., fractional loss of fan flow). Comparisons are made with results from previous studies on light commercial buildings. The specific ELAs ranged from 0. 8 to 5. 3 cm 2 per m 2 of floor area served, and the <b>leakage</b> <b>classes</b> ranged from 232 to 414, making these duct systems much leakier than the “unsealed ductwork ” classification by ASHRAE. The air leakage ratios were approximately 10 % of fan-supplied airflow on average, which was considerably lower than previous studies. Conduction energy losses calculated by temperature measurements in the duct systems were found to be significant, ranging from 9 % to 24 % of capacity. Refrigerant-side monitoring of temperature and pressure were used to calculate equipment efficiencies. The results show that there were considerable energy losses by air leakage and conduction through ducts, and that the losses varied from system to system. Frequent on-off cooling cycling was common with the systems we tested and additional losses were also found due to improper system control. These diagnostic results suggest that efficiency improvement in thermal distribution could be achieved via better system control, design and sizing, and by duct sealing...|$|R

Thirty maxillary anterior primary teeth, clinically sound and naturally exfoliated, were used. In group 1 (n = 10), two thin layers of a copal varnish (Cavitine) were applied. In group 2 (n = 10), Scotchbond Multi-Purpose Plus, a dual adhesive system, was used according to manufacturer instructions. In group 3 (n = 10), One-Step adhesive system in combination with a low-viscosity resin (Resinomer) were used according to manufacturer instructions. All samples were restored with a high-copper dental amalgam alloy (GS 80, SDI). After restoration, the samples were stored in normal saline at 37 degrees C for 72 h. The specimens were polished, thermocycled (500 cycles, 5 degrees and 55 degrees C, 30 -s dwell time) and impermeabilized with fingernail polish to within 1. 0 mm of the restoration margins. The teeth were then placed in 0. 5 % methylene blue for 4 h. Finally, the samples were sectioned and evaluated for marginal leakage.

40|$|A {{layer of}} an {{unfilled}} adhesive resin placed between the tooth and composite restoration {{has been shown}} to absorb some of the stress generated in the composite during polymerization and to reduce interfacial leakage. The objectives of this study were to measure the change in polymerization contraction stress of bonded composite as the thickness of the resin adhesive was systematically varied, and to correlate the effects of the adhesive thickness and reduced stress on marginal <b>leakage</b> in <b>class</b> V cavities. The maximum contraction force of composite (Herculite XRV) was measured in a tensilometer as the thickness of the adhesive bonding agent (Scotchbond MP) was varied from 20 to 300 pLm. Composite was placed in Class V cavities prepared on the labial surfaces of bovine teeth to which different thicknesses of adhesive had been applied by layering, and a marginal leakage test was performed by means of staining with silver nitrate. Contraction stress decreased significantly as the adhesive thickness was increased. This result was supported by a theoretical examination of the data. In class V cavities, additional adhesive layering in the marginal area reduced the overall degree of microleakage. The contraction stress generated during the placement of a composite restoration contributes significantly to early marginal leakage, and this stress was significantly absorbed and relieved by the application of an increasing thickness of low-stiffness adhesive...|$|R

Cavities were prepared with burs in high speed in facial and lingual surfaces of 25 human third molars. The specimens were divided into 5 groups of 10 preparations each: G 1 (air abrasion and Scotchbond Multi Purpose), G 2 (phosphoric acid and Scotchbond MP), G 3 (Clearfil SE Bond self-etching system), G 4 (air abrasion, phosphoric acid and Scotchbond MP) G 5 (air abrasion and Clearfil SE Bond). All groups were restored with Z 100 composite resin. The teeth were subjected to thermal cycling and immerged in 50 % silver nitrate solution. After sectioning, the specimens were analyzed with a stereomicroscope for assessment of microleakage according to the degree of dye penetration. The Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn Multiple Comparison test were performed in order to evaluate the differences among the experimental groups. Air abrasion groups demonstrated the greatest leakage. Scotchbond MP with phosphoric acid produced the least leakage, with greater leakage in gingival margins than occlusal margins in all experimental groups.

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} “in vitro” {{the degree}} of marginal <b>leakage</b> in <b>class</b> V cavities irradiated with Nd:YAG laser onto enamel and dentin pretreated with bonding system (Single Bond, 3 M ESPE)  without light-curing. Material & Methods: Class V cavities were performed and standardized in 60 bovine incisors. After the acid etching, the teeth {{were divided into}} three groups: G 1 – Application of bonding system, irradiation with Nd:YAG laser at 140 mJ/pulse without light-curing. G 2 – Application of bonding system, irradiation with Nd:YAG laser at 200 mJ/pulse without light-curing. Group C - Application of bonding system and light-curing. Next, resin composite restorations were executed and thermocycled at alternated baths from 2 to 50 ºC (± 2 ºC), totalizing 500 cycles. To assess the microleakage, the teeth were submersed into 50 % silver nitrate solution for 24 h, cut at 1 mm of thickness and analyzed through stereoscopy. The following leakage criterion scores were employed: 0 – none leakage; 1 – gingival or incisal wall; 2 – axial wall towards the pulp. Results : It was observed a high leakage frequency with score 1 among the experimental conditions. There was a higher predominance of score 2 leakage for control group at cementum. Concerning to enamel and cementum, Group C was similar to G 1. By comparing control group with G 2, and G 1 with G 2, it was verified statistically significant differences. Conclusion: The laser energy provided a reduction of the marginal leakage at enamel and dentin/ cementum; however, the energy density increase resulted in smaller marginal leakage at enamel and dentin/cementum.

40|$|Introduction: Today a new {{restorative}} resin called “Class V cervical restorative resin” with itsspecific surface sealer “Seal-n-Shine” {{has been}} introduced to use for reducing of micro leakage inclass V restorations. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the influence of surface sealer or self-etchprimer on micro <b>leakage</b> around <b>class</b> V cavities filled with “Class V cervical restorative resin”. •Methods and Materials: In this in vitro experimental study, wedge shaped cavities were prepared onfacial surface of 40 intact premolars, using No. 56 carbide bur. The occlusal margin was prepared inenamel and the cervical margin was in cement. The teeth then were divided into 4 groups of 10. Fourgroups of materials were used, one for each group of the teeth: class V restorative resin; class Vrestorative resin and its specific sealer; self – etch primer of Clearfil SE Bond and Class V restorativeresin; and self – etch primer of Clearfil SE Bond, class V restorative resin and surface sealer ofClearfil SE Bond. Then all the samples were thermo cycled (1500 cycle, 5 - 55). Afterwards they wereplaced in 50 % silver nitrate solution and developing solution, respectively. Finally they were sectionedlongitudinally and were evaluated by stereo-microscope at × 28 magnifications. The data wasanalyzed using Kruskall-Wallis and Man-Whitney tests. •Results: There were no significant differences in micro leakage of enamel margins between the fourgroups. But, considering the dentinal margins, the differences were significant between groups 1, 2; 1, 3; and 1, 4. The differences between the other two paired groups were insignificant. •Conclusion: For decrease of micro leakage, the usage of class V cervical restorative resin per se is noteffective, and it is better to apply its specific sealer (Seal-n-Shine) on the surface of restoration, or aself-etch dentin bonding agent under it. •Key words: Micro leakage, Rebounding, Surface sealant, Self-etch primer, Class V restorations...|$|R
40|$|Aim: This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} filler existence in self-etch adhesive resin on the marginal <b>leakage</b> of a <b>class</b> V restoration. Materials and Methods: Class V cavities were prepared and restored with a resin composite on the buccal surfaces of 48 premolars lined with unfilled or filled adhesives (n = 24). After thermo cycling, teeth in each group were divided to two subgroups (n = 12), specimens of the first subgroup were incubated for 24 h in distilled water at 37 °C, and for the second group three months in the same condition. Specimens were placed in 50 % silver nitrate for 24 h at 37 °C, and then were cut buccolingually 1 mm thick. Dye penetration was measured using a stereomicroscope and scaled from 0 to 5 in a blind method. SEM images were made to evaluate the dentin-adhesive interfaces. Collected {{data were analyzed using}} the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U-tests at a significant level of P< 0. 05. Results: There {{was no significant difference between}} microleakage of filled and unfilled adhesive at 24 h and 3 months (P< 0. 05). There was a significant difference in cervical microleakage between 24 h and 3 months, which was independ on filler load of the adhesive (P< 0. 001). In contrast, there was no significant difference in occlusal microleakage between 24 h and 3 months and the cervical microleakage was significantly higher than occlusal microleakage after 3 months. SEM images reveald that unfilled adhesive infiltrate slightly better than filled adhesive. Conclusion: The application of filler particles in a self etch adhesive system had no influence on marginal leakage at both the enamel and dentin margins. While the unfilled adhesive infiltrate better than the filled adhesive, its long term performance is not promising...|$|R

A large scale test rig is used to conduct an experimental investigation into the leakage resistance properties and flow characteristics of labyrinth seals. A novel test facility with multiple cavities that provides 2 D, planar flow at a scale enlargement of 100 : I is utilized. This facility uses water as the working fluid and allows real-time visual observation of experiments via large acrylic windows. Externally adjustable seal elements, also made of acrylic glass, allow each element to be moved to the desired radial and axial position. Two distinct flow visualization techniques are employed to assist in the identification of flow patterns which are beneficial to seal <b>leakage</b> resistance. Three <b>classes</b> of labyrinth seals are tested. Within each class, seals are tested over a range of Reynolds numbers, step heights, and axial offset positions (where applicable) for a fixed annular clearance. A permanent flow visualization record for each experiment is kept and analyzed in both real-time and slow motion. Statistical information is derived from the flow visualization record, and the time-mean flow field is mapped. When sudden changes in the leakage resistance properties of a seal occur, the flow visualization record is consulted to see what changes in the time-mean flow field have occurred. Furthermore, the statistical data provides information on the unsteadiness and oscillations in the instantaneous flow field. The experimental results imply that by using a combination of axial offset distance and step height, seal performance can be greatly improved. Inspection of the time-mean flow visualization images indicates that certain combinations result in greater serpentining. Seals that exhibit a moderate amount of serpentining generally had greater leakage resistance. Furthermore, it was found that larger step heights tend to amplify the effect that the axial offset has on serpentining. Conversely, however, it was observed that decreasing the clearance diminished the effect that axial offset has on leakage resistance. The statistical information obtained from the flow visualization seemed to have some correlation to the leakage resistance of a seal, however, the lack of a more comprehensive data set limits the conclusions that can be inferred...|$|R

A cut in the center of the restoration in the vestibular lingual direction to determine the degree of microleakage in the occlusal and gingival margins of each specimen was performed. The statistical methods Kruskal-Wallis, non-parametric, and the Wilcoxon's Paired Signed Rank Test were used at 5 % significance level. The methodology used to evaluate the marginal leakage made it possible to conclude that: all groups presented similar micro leakage results for the occlusal and gingival margins and were not statistically different between them; when the degrees of micro leakage were compared between the occlusal and gingival margins it was observed that groups II and Ill did not present significant statistical difference, while groups I, IV, V and VI presented significant statistical differences; when the occlusal margin was compared to the gingival, a smaller gingival marginal leakage was observedO objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar o selamento marginal de restaurações com cimento de ionômero de vidro resina modificado ap 6 s aplicação do laser Nd:YAG sabre o primer, fotopolimerizado ou não, e nas margens da restauração empregando-se o teste de microinfiltração.
