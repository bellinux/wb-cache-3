The main aim is for all office based applications to provide functionality to meet the specifications described here (whether <b>licensed</b> <b>software,</b> open source or unlicensed freeware) and thus many application providers could supply the educational institution ICT market.".|$|E

2500|$|Boxee {{source code}} is {{otherwise}} in majority {{based on the}} XBMC (now Kodi) media center project's source code which Boxee uses as its software framework, and the Boxee developers contribute changes to that part back upstream to the XBMC project. So Boxee is partially open source and those parts are distributed under the GNU General Public License, however Boxee's social networking layer library, [...] "libboxee" [...] is closed source as it deals with proprietary methods of communication with Boxee's online back-end server which handles the user account information and social network communications between the users in the Boxee userbase, {{it is not clear}} if this way of using closed source libraries with a GPL <b>licensed</b> <b>software</b> passes the GPL linking exception or not.|$|E
2500|$|In August 1999, Unisys {{changed the}} details of their {{licensing}} practice, announcing the option for owners of certain non-commercial and private websites to obtain licenses on payment of a one-time license fee of $5000 or $7500. Such licenses were not required for website owners or other GIF users who had used <b>licensed</b> <b>software</b> to generate GIFs. Nevertheless, Unisys was subjected to thousands of online attacks and abusive emails from users believing {{that they were going to}} be charged $5000 or sued for using GIFs on their websites. Despite giving free licenses to hundreds of non-profit organizations, schools and governments, Unisys was completely unable to generate any good publicity and continued to be condemned by individuals and organizations such as the League for Programming Freedom who started the [...] "Burn All GIFs" [...] campaign in 1999.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{interesting}} {{aspect is}} how Boxee manages to play Adobe Flash content from {{sites such as}} YouTube and Hulu, and display HTML5 or Silverlight content from such web-based services such as HBO Go and Netflix. Boxee seems to be shipping with a closed source, binary-only, program called [...] "bxflplayer", which seems to load Adobe Flash Player and Microsoft Silverlight proprietary plugins. This program communicates with the main Boxee process via shared memory and it renders the video onto screen. By using this approach, {{it is possible for}} Boxee not only to play Flash Video and Silverlight content that is protected by DRM (Digital Rights Management) but also allows for the user to control the player using a remote control and other input devices that are more suitable to laid back watching. Same as with the above-mentioned [...] "libboxee", it is not clear if this way of using [...] "bxflplayer" [...] as closed source libraries with a GPL <b>licensed</b> <b>software</b> passes as GPL linking exception or not.|$|E
