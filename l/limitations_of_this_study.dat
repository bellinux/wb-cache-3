5000|$|Perceived {{trustworthiness}} {{is interpreted}} by the individual from looking at a face, and this decreases when someone is lying. Such observations are [...] "too subtle to be explicitly processed by observers, but does affect implicit cognitive and affective processes." [...] These results, {{in a study by}} Heussen, Binkofski, and Jolij, were obtained through a study with an N400 paradigm including two conditions within the experiment: truthful faces and lying faces. Faces flashed for 100ms and then the participants rated them. However, the <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> would be that it only had 15 participants and the mean age was 24.|$|E
5000|$|RESULTS: Findings {{included}} higher {{utilization of}} “wraparound services” (e.g., case management, in-home supports, and nontraditional services) for the demonstration group, higher {{costs for the}} demonstration group (primarily due to this group remaining in treatment longer), and no consistent {{differences between the groups}} on outcome measures (e.g., behavior, functioning, caregiver strain, perceived social support, family environment). <b>Limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> include the short time span (6 months) and whether the demonstration project truly followed the wraparound process. Authors stated the “wrap” condition had access to informal services and flexible funding, but authors did not assess “wrapness” and stated that, “there {{is no evidence that the}} content or the quality of the services were different for the Wraparound children.” (p. 151) ...|$|E
50|$|In her {{follow-up}} {{with families}} ten years later, Lareau {{admits that the}} ideal study would have involved on-going participant observation, {{but that was not}} feasible given the resources and time investment of the families that would have required. Instead, she conducted two hour recorded interviews with each of the twelve children, and had separate interviews with each of the mothers, fathers and siblings that agreed to be interviewed. Some declined.In response to the second edition of the book, critics continue to comment on the <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> given its small sample size, while applying broad theoretical conclusions to North American society. Lareau briefly addresses race factors having an influence on outcomes for youth, but claims the class factors play a more significant role.|$|E
30|$|A <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> is {{the small}} size of the patients.|$|R
30|$|The biggest <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> is {{that each}} tooth was not {{assessed}} individually.|$|R
30|$|A <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> {{was that}} cone-beam {{computed}} tomography {{was not used}} to examine discision and piezocision cuts. Although cone-beam computed tomography is a reliable method in three-dimensional imaging, we did not prefer it to not give the patients extra radiation doses. Another <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> was that disc saw may damage alveolar soft tissues, so the operator must consider it.|$|R
50|$|Messner et al. studied {{ankyloglossia}} {{and infant}} feeding. Thirty-six infants with ankyloglossia {{were compared to}} a control group without ankyloglossia. The two groups were followed for six months to assess possible breastfeeding difficulties; defined as nipple pain lasting more than six weeks, or infant difficulty latching onto or staying onto the mother’s breast. Twenty-five percent of mothers of infants with ankyloglossia reported breastfeeding difficulty compared with only 3% of the mothers in the control group. The study concluded that ankyloglossia can adversely affect breastfeeding in certain infants. Infants with ankyologlossia do not, however, have such big difficulties when feeding from a bottle. <b>Limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> include {{the small sample size}} {{and the fact that the}} quality of the mother’s breastfeeding was not assessed.|$|E
50|$|Wallace and Clark {{also studied}} {{breastfeeding}} difficulties in infants with ankyloglossia. They followed 10 infants with ankyloglossia who underwent surgical tongue tie division. Eight {{of the ten}} mothers experienced poor infant latching onto the breast, 6/10 experienced sore nipples and 5/10 experienced continual feeding cycles; 3/10 mothers were exclusively breastfeeding. Following a tongue-tie division, 4/10 mothers noted immediate improvements in breastfeeding, 3/10 mothers did not notice any improvements and 6/10 mothers continued breastfeeding {{for at least four}} months after the surgery. The study concluded that tongue-tie division may be a possible benefit for infants experiencing breastfeeding difficulties due to ankyloglossia and further investigation is warranted. The <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> include the small sample size and {{the fact that there was}} not a control group. In addition, the conclusions were based on subjective parent report as opposed to objective measures.|$|E
50|$|Opinion varies {{regarding}} how frequently ankyloglossia truly causes problems. Some professionals {{believe it is}} rarely symptomatic, whereas others believe it {{is associated with a}} variety of problems. The disagreement among professionals was documented in a study by Messner and Lalakea (2000). The authors sent a survey to a total of 1598 otolaryngologists, pediatricians, speech-language pathologists and lactation consultants with questions to ascertain their beliefs on ankyloglossia. 797 of the surveys were fully completed and used in the study. It was found that 69% of lactation consultants, but only a minority of pediatricians answered that ankyloglossia is frequently associated with feeding difficulties; 60% of otolaryngologists and 50% of speech pathologists answered that ankyloglossia is sometimes associated with speech difficulties compared to only 23% of pediatricians; 67% of otolaryngologists compared with 21% of pediatricians answered that ankyloglossia is sometimes associated with social and mechanical difficulties. <b>Limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> include a reduced sample size due to unreturned or incomplete surveys.|$|E
30|$|The exact {{duration}} of breastfeeding {{and frequency of}} NNS habits were not reported, which is another <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study.</b>|$|R
30|$|The main <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> is the {{retrospective}} design. Furthermore, record {{analysis was performed}} in a single hospital reviewing only clinical charts.|$|R
30|$|The major <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> is {{the fact}} that there are many {{determinants}} and confounding variables in problem gambling, other than casino proximity.|$|R
5000|$|This is {{an example}} of one of the studies {{conducted}} by Winn in which he evaluated the difference of learning in a computer-based environment as opposed to learning through direct experience. In this study, two groups of college students learned oceanography. One group learned using a computer simulation of the ocean which included a three-dimensional (3D) model, and the other group learned by spending a day in a research vessel and used oceanographic tools. In his discussion of this study Winn makes reference to Kolb’s experiential learning theory because it highlights the significance of direct experience with the environment, as well as the need for abstract concepts in order to learn and apply knowledge. According to Winn, the proper use of metaphors in simulations may allow students to learn abstract concepts better than they would in real experiences. This study took place in Seattle and was focused on the oceanography of the Puget Sound estuary system within Washington. There were 25 students in each group and both groups received a total of three lessons. Two of the lessons were taught by the same professors and covered the same material. For the third lesson the groups were separated to their different settings. One of the <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> was that the students taking the “Virtual Puget Sound” (VPS) experience could only control some independent variables but not others, like for example they could not change the salinity of the water. The results of the study showed “no difference in overall learning between students who used the VPS simulation and those who studied the same material in the field”. [...] However, the study found that students with less experience in water learned more from direct experience, while the simulated ocean experience helped students transfer the knowledge they obtained while working in the computer, to the material presented in class.|$|E
30|$|This study {{provided}} {{valuable insights}} in attitudes of Dutch teachers towards diversity. There are however some <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study.</b> We {{look more closely}} to three <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> because we feel they {{should be taken into}} account in further research.|$|E
30|$|The <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> {{were the}} {{retrospective}} {{nature and the}} absence of a control group.|$|E

30|$|A <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> is {{the absence}} of data on neural growth factor expression. Further {{research}} is needed about the relation and influence of the identified destructive and adaptive nerve changes on fracture healing.|$|R
30|$|Within the <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> results {{suggested}} that screw loosening increases with increasing abutment angulations and collar lengths after dynamic cyclic loading.|$|E
30|$|The major <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> are {{the small}} sample size, the lack of inter- and {{intraobserver}} data, {{and the absence of}} patients treated with tendon autografts.|$|E
30|$|The <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> include factors {{relating}} to the retrospective nature of this study. Preoperative functional outcome scores were not measured, {{and there was no}} control group.|$|E
30|$|A <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> is the {{somewhat}} arbitrary threshold for mastery. As the true learning state {{of a student}} {{is not possible to}} determine we are confined to indirect methods such as asking questions.|$|R
30|$|Within the <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> it was {{possible}} to conclude that etching lithium disilicate CAD/CAM ceramics, following by ultrasonic cleaning in distilled water and application of a silane, is important to enhance the adhesion resistance.|$|R
30|$|The <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> is the {{relatively}} small number of patients included, and it is a hospital-based single center study, a larger multicenter study covering the whole governorate or even a community-based study is recommended.|$|R

30|$|Despite the <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> (low {{number of}} patients, {{possible}} presence of radioactive urine in the bladder and urethra, resolution limitation), {{it was possible}} to make some considerations.|$|E
30|$|<b>Limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> include {{imprecision}} in measurements due {{to point}} selection subjectivity, lack of meniscus in {{determination of the}} orientation of the articular surface, and latent registration error.|$|E
30|$|The main <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> {{is that we}} {{were not}} able to {{generate}} substantial interaction between participants and development team representatives. Thereby, some of the conclusions may be limited to social design feedback without such interaction.|$|R
30|$|The main <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> was {{the lack}} of {{validated}} quality of life questionnaires as none are available in the Arabic language. Additionally, this was a single-centre study, and the sample size was not sufficient to assess complications.|$|R
30|$|The <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> {{is that it}} was a {{case series}} and, due to lack of {{treatment}} randomisation, the findings may be biased and overoptimistic [15]. Randomised controlled trials are therefore needed to evaluate the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>this</b> procedure for superficial dyspareunia.|$|R
