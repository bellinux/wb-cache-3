5|$|Marge and Homer argue {{later that}} night. Homer tells Marge {{that even though}} getting the {{trampoline}} was a mistake at <b>least</b> <b>he</b> is willing to try new things, while she is boring and nags too much. Marge disagrees, but discovers that Bart and Lisa agree with Homer's assessment. She becomes annoyed and stays the night at Patty and Selma's house. While there, she is introduced to an infomercial featuring self-help guru Brad Goodman, who supposedly can help her with her chronic nagging. After Marge and Homer watch a Brad Goodman video, Marge is more tolerant {{and the two of}} them get along better. Observing how out of control Bart is, they take the family to see Brad Goodman's live lecture in the hopes that it will change him. Bart interrupts the lecture, and Brad Goodman encourages the town to follow Bart's spontaneous attitude. Soon, the whole town begins to act like Bart, which means Bart's rebellious ways are no longer unique, putting him in a slump.|$|E
25|$|He {{appears as}} Archdeacon of Lothian in {{documents}} from 1386, an extremely prestigious position (or claim at <b>least)</b> <b>he</b> {{appears to have}} lost by 1390, when the position is securely held by another. Other honours held before the episcopate, excluding Mortlach, include the church of Liston (by November 1391), previously held by Gilbert de Greenlaw, {{and the office of}} sub-dean of Brechin.|$|E
25|$|His brief {{experience}} of the first-class game {{was something of a}} disaster: Yorkshire, who would go on to the County Championship title, crushed their opponents by an innings and 220 runs inside two days, while Bunting himself made 1 and 0 with his four overs of leg-spin disappearing for 38 runs. At <b>least</b> <b>he</b> took a catch, to dismiss George Macaulay.|$|E
5000|$|Indeed, Councillor, I am well {{pleased with}} Blädner, but with Seifert not at all; but at <b>least</b> <b>he's</b> better than Blädner.|$|R

25|$|Haslewood {{played in}} three matches for Cambridge University that have later been {{judged to be}} {{first-class}} games: one {{in each of the}} 1833, 1834 and 1835 seasons. He batted in the lower order and in the 1835 match at <b>least</b> <b>he</b> bowled, because he is recorded as taking wickets in that game; scorecards for his other matches are incomplete, so {{it is not possible to}} determine his exact role, nor whether he batted or bowled right- or left-handed.|$|E
25|$|Hall {{was a man}} of {{independent}} means and seems to have been careless of fame; at <b>least</b> <b>he</b> took no trouble to communicate his invention to the world. At a trial in Westminster Hall about the patent rights granted to John Dollond (Watkin v. Dollond), Hall was admitted to be the first inventor of the achromatic telescope. However, it was ruled by Lord Mansfield that it was not the original inventor who ought to profit from such invention, but the one who brought it forth for the benefit of mankind.|$|E
25|$|During {{the last}} years of the monarchy Chicharro seemed {{politically}} disoriented. Though in the press plebiscite he was voted one of three best possible representatives of Castellon province in , he was not appointed its member. He remained active in Catholic groupings like Acción social, giving lectures and contributing as organizer and manager. As friend of Lamamié he maintained links with his Acción Castellana, set up in 1930, and was drawn closer to another of his organizations, Federación Católico-Agraria Salmantina. He remained in the circle of Francesc Cambó, leader of the Catalan conservative Lliga Regionalista. Last but not <b>least,</b> <b>he</b> retained his Carlist contacts with the former mellistas, now headed by the new leader, Victor Pradera.|$|E
50|$|Colin — The Baskervilles' talking house, {{like all}} houses in Underworld, {{instead of giving}} shelter to his family, he is {{secretly}} trying to bump them off; but at <b>least</b> <b>he's</b> polite about it.|$|R

5000|$|Ball's [...] "Thinkin' Problem" [...] was parodied by Cledus T. Judd. Ball then {{appears in}} Judd's Shania Twain parody [...] "If Shania Was Mine", {{standing}} behind the cameras and saying, [...] "At <b>least</b> <b>he's</b> not picking on me this time." ...|$|R
25|$|In the 1940s {{there were}} a spate of film dealing with various aspects of heavenly administration: Here Comes Mr. Jordan (1941), Heaven Can Wait (1943), A Matter of Life and Death (1946) and It’s a Wonderful Life (1946). Beckett {{may or may not}} have seen any of these; at the very <b>least</b> <b>he</b> would have likely read about them. Significantly the opening camera shot of It’s a Wonderful Life dissolves slowly upward into the star-filled, dark night sky where two {{pulsating}} galaxies of light come into view. Two heavenly angels are conversing together in the film's otherworldly opening. In Rough for Theatre II, Bertrand and Morvan take time out to specifically discuss the starry night sky.|$|E
25|$|In {{this village}} {{we found a}} negro man, who {{informed}} us that {{he first came to}} this country with Lewis & Clark – with whom he also returned to the State of Missouri, and in a few years returned again with a Mr. Mackinney, a trader on the Missouri river, and has remained here ever since - which is about ten or twelve years. He has acquired a correct knowledge of their manner of living, and speaks their language fluently. He has rose (sic?) to be quite a considerable character, or chief, in their village; at <b>least</b> <b>he</b> assumes all the dignities of a chief, for he has four wives, with whom he lives alternately.|$|E
25|$|Wang Wei {{never lived}} to see the empire return to peace, as the An-Shi {{disturbances}} and their aftermath continued beyond his lifetime. However, at <b>least</b> <b>he</b> could enjoy a relative return to stability compared to the initial years of the rebellion, especially {{when he had the}} opportunity to spend time in the relative seclusion of his Lantian estate, which allowed him both a poetic and a Buddhist retreat, as well as a place to spend time with his friends and with nature, painting and writing. But, finally, his writing came to an end, and in the seventh month of 759, or in 761, Wang Wei requested writing implements, wrote several letters to his brother and to his friends, and then died. He was then buried at his Lantian estate.|$|E

5000|$|Commenting on the horse's later career, Barron said in 2004 [...] "It was a {{thorn in}} my side for a bit after he went, and I didn't enjoy seeing him run, but time is a great healer, and now he's with Paul Dixon and at <b>least</b> <b>he's</b> got a good home" ...|$|R
25|$|Career {{records for}} batting average are usually {{subject to a}} minimum {{qualification}} of 20 innings played or completed, in order to exclude batsmen who have not played enough games for their skill to be reliably assessed. Under this qualification, the highest Test batting average belongs to Australia's Sir Donald Bradman, with 99.94. Given that a career batting average over 50 is exceptional, and that only four other players have averages over 60, this is an outstanding statistic. The fact that Bradman's average is so far above {{that of any other}} cricketer has led several statisticians to argue that, statistically at <b>least,</b> <b>he</b> was the greatest sportsman in any sport. As at 21 October 2016, Adam Voges of Australia has recorded an average of 72.75 from 27 innings played, but only 20 innings completed.|$|E
25|$|Of his cathedral restorations, {{inspired}} as {{they were}} by the mistaken idea that a medieval church ought to be homogeneous in style and unencumbered by screens, monuments, and other obtrusive relics of the past, {{it can only be}} said that the Chapters who employed him were no more enlightened than their architect, and that at Westminster Abbey at <b>least</b> <b>he</b> accomplished an urgent work of repair in an unexceptionable manner. His activities at Salisbury, Durham, Hereford, and Lichfield were bitterly criticized by John Carter in his Pursuits of Architectural Innovation, and it was due in large measure to Carter's persistent denunciation that, in 1796, Wyatt failed to secure election as a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. In the following year, however, he was permitted to add F.S.A. to his name by a majority of one hundred and twenty-three votes.|$|E
25|$|Philip II {{spent much}} of his youth as a hostage at Thebes, where he studied under the renowned general Epaminondas, whose reforms formed the basis of Philip's later tactics. The {{equipment}} of the Macedonian phalangite {{is believed to have been}} influenced by the 'peltast' developed by the Athenian general Iphicrates. The Iphicratean peltast was not a skirmisher but a form of light hoplite, characterised by using a longer spear and smaller shield. However, the introduction of the sarissa pike in conjunction with a smaller shield seem to have been innovations devised by Philip himself, or at the very <b>least</b> <b>he</b> produced the definitive synthesis of earlier developments. Diodorus claimed that Philip was inspired to make changes in the organisation of his Macedonian infantry from reading a passage in the writings of Homer describing a close-packed formation.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never thought}} of that till now," [...] he said. [...] "We always got along because I {{understood}} him. I managed him. The man hasn't changed in the <b>least.</b> <b>He's</b> always what he is. But there's a difference. I noticed that first over in Lost Canon. And Joan, I believe it's because Gulden saw you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He gets a good drop of real water now and again, and I don't pity {{him in the}} <b>least.</b> <b>He's</b> clever of course, and {{has made}} his own way, but I've always a feeling {{that he has no}} {{business}} where he is.

25|$|In 1992 Hick {{finally made}} a Test half-century, 51 against Pakistan, {{but as with}} the West Indian series he was dropped {{before the end of}} the summer. This time at <b>least</b> <b>he</b> scored heavily for Worcestershire, {{averaging}} nearly seventy for his county. This domestic form, together with his ability against spin bowling, secured Hick a place on the 1992–93 tour of India, and in a generally disastrous tour for England (they lost two Tests by an innings and the other by eight wickets) he was one of the very few bright spots; indeed, he topped both batting and bowling averages for his country, as well as scoring 249 runs in the six ODIs. The personal highlight for Hick was his long-awaited maiden Test hundred: 178 in the third Test at Bombay; he added another 47 in the second innings. He then scored 68 and 26 in the one-off Test against Sri Lanka which immediately followed. For his achievements in the subcontinent, he was named one of Indian Crickets five Cricketers of the Year in 1993.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the late}} 1960s and 1970s, three left arm spinners {{dominated}} the Indian domestic cricket scene. Along with Doshi there were, Padmakar Shivalkar from Bombay, & Rajinder Goel of Haryana & Delhi. Goel still holds {{the record for}} the highest number of wickets in the Ranji Trophy (640 at 17.14). Shivlakar holds the record for his team Mumbai. Years after years, they destroyed strong batting line ups in Indian cricket with the guile of their spin, only to be overlooked by the national selectors. The only reason was the presence of B.S. Bedi. With a world class left arm spinner readily available, the selectors were reluctant to give the others much chance. Thus, Shivalker and Goel had to content themselves with a few unofficial test matches against Sri Lanka. Goel was specially unlucky, {{in the sense that he}} was originally selected to make his official Test Debut against WI at Delhi, in 1974–78. But a last minute change saw off spinner Venkat replacing him. Doshi, in that sense, can be considered to be the luckiest; at <b>least</b> <b>he</b> got the chance to represent India in full internationals. Nevertheless, he too lost the best years of his playing career waiting for his chance to come.|$|E
500|$|Frank Lovece of Film Journal International, one of few {{mainstream}} {{critics to}} {{have read the}} comic-book miniseries, said that the film compared poorly with the source material. Noting that the hero in the comic goes even further, [...] "breaking the fourth wall and positioning himself so that he's 'prison-raping' and taunting the reader for having liked the series", Lovece found that, [...] "hile Millar may have contempt for his readers—and, by extension, the medium in which he works—at <b>least</b> <b>he</b> has his own vision, and gets it across with style and wit"; qualities that, in Lovece's opinion, the movie lacked.|$|E

500|$|Santa Barbara Independent {{journalist}} Brian Tanguay {{wrote in}} his book review that Taibbi was [...] "the spiritual heir of legendary presidential campaign scribes" [...] including Hunter S. Thompson and Timothy Crouse. Tanguay said of Taibbi's writing style, [...] "Taibbi is incisive and often incredibly funny as he recounts the foibles of candidates and the long, enervating presidential primary process." [...] He observed, [...] "A veteran of four presidential campaigns, Taibbi knows how the game works. Or at <b>least</b> <b>he</b> knew until Trump came." [...] Tanguay's review concluded, [...] "Insane Clown President is a valuable work {{about one of the}} most bizarre electoral outcomes in American history." ...|$|E

The next day, Jim jokes about their [...] "first date", and Pam, in an unexpectedly blunt tone, tells him it was not a date. Surprised and obviously disappointed, Jim makes an unwise comment that at <b>least</b> <b>he</b> didn't leave her at a high school hockey game, in reference to Pam's earlier revelation of what Roy had done on her worst date ever. Pam is clearly upset and gets up to go send some faxes, leaving it awkward between her and Jim, who tries unsuccessfully to apologize.|$|E
