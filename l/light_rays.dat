If the deflection of <b>light</b> <b>rays</b> by optical elements is small, the action of a lens or reflective element on a given light ray can be expressed as multiplication of a two-component vector with a two-by-two matrix called ray transfer matrix: the vector's components are the light ray's slope and its distance from the optical axis, while the matrix encodes {{the properties of the}} optical element. Actually, {{there are two kinds of}} matrices, viz. a refraction matrix describing the refraction at a lens surface, and a translation matrix, describing the translation of the plane of reference to the next refracting surface, where another refraction matrix applies.|$|E

40|$|The {{deflection}} of <b>light</b> <b>ray</b> as {{it passes}} around a gravitational mass can be calculated by different methods. Such calculations are generally done by using the null geodesics under both strong field and weak field approximation. However, several authors have studied the gravitational deflection of <b>light</b> <b>ray</b> using material medium approach. For a static, non-rotating spherical mass, one can determine the deflection in Schwarzschild field, by expressing the line element in an isotropic form and calculating the refractive index to determine the trajectory of the <b>light</b> <b>ray.</b> In this paper, we draw {{our attention to the}} refractive index of <b>light</b> <b>ray</b> in Kerr field using the material medium approach. The frame dragging effects in Kerr field was considered to calculate the velocity of <b>light</b> <b>ray</b> and finally the refractive index in Kerr field geometry was determined.

5|$|So-called superluminal {{motion is}} seen in certain astronomical objects, such as the {{relativistic}} jets of radio galaxies and quasars. However, these jets are not moving at speeds {{in excess of the}} speed of light: the apparent superluminal motion is a projection effect caused by objects moving near the speed of light and approaching Earth at a small angle to the line of sight: since the light which was emitted when the jet was farther away took longer to reach the Earth, the time between two successive observations corresponds to a longer time between the instants at which the <b>light</b> <b>rays</b> were emitted.|$|E

Al-Haytham proposed in his Book of Optics that vision occurs by way of <b>light</b> <b>rays</b> forming a cone with its vertex {{at the center of the}} eye. He suggested that light was reflected from different surfaces in different directions, thus causing objects to look different. He argued further that the mathematics of reflection and refraction needed to be consistent with the anatomy of the eye.|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{efficient}} technique to render single scattering in large scenes with reflective and refractive objects and homogeneous participating media. Efficiency is obtained by evaluating the final radiance along a viewing ray {{directly from the}} <b>lighting</b> <b>rays</b> passing near to it, and by rapidly identifying such <b>lighting</b> <b>rays</b> in the scene. To facilitate the search for nearby <b>lighting</b> <b>rays,</b> we convert <b>lighting</b> <b>rays</b> and viewing rays into 6 D points and planes according to their Plücker coordinates and coefficients, respectively. In this 6 D line space, the problem of closest lines search becomes one of closest points to a plane query, which we significantly accelerate using a spatial hierarchy of the 6 D points. This approach to <b>lighting</b> <b>ray</b> gathering supports complex light paths with multiple reflections and refractions, and avoids {{the use of a}} volume representation, which is expensive for large-scale scenes. This method also utilizes far fewer <b>lighting</b> <b>rays</b> than the number of photons needed in traditional volumetric photon mapping, and does not discretize viewing rays into numerous steps for ray marching. With this approach, results similar to volumetric photon mapping are obtained efficiently in terms of both storage and computation...|$|R
5|$|In the 1960s, Ehlers {{collaborated with}} Felix Pirani and Alfred Schild on a constructive-axiomatic {{approach}} to general relativity: {{a way of}} deriving the theory from a minimal set of elementary objects {{and a set of}} axioms specifying these objects' properties. The basic ingredients of their approach are primitive concepts such as event, light ray, particle and freely falling particle. At the outset, spacetime is a mere set of events, without any further structure. They postulated the basic properties of light and freely falling particles as axioms, and with their help constructed the differential topology, conformal structure and, finally, the metric structure of spacetime, that is: the notion of when two events are close to each other, the role of <b>light</b> <b>rays</b> in linking up events, and a notion of distance between events. Key steps of the construction correspond to idealized measurements, such the standard range finding used in radar. The final step derived Einstein's equations from the weakest possible set of additional axioms. The result is a formulation that clearly identifies the assumptions underlying general relativity.|$|E

25|$|For {{the past}} years, {{researchers}} {{have been trying to}} reduce the price of solar cells while maximizing efficiency. Thin-film solar cell is a cost-effective second generation solar cell with much reduced thickness at the expense of light absorption efficiency. Efforts to maximize light absorption efficiency with reduced thickness have been made. Surface texturing is one of techniques used to reduce optical losses to maximize light absorbed. Currently, surface texturing techniques on silicon photovoltaics are drawing much attention. Surface texturing could be done in multiple ways. Etching single crystalline silicon substrate can produce randomly distributed square based pyramids on the surface using anisotropic etchants. Recent studies show that c-Si wafers could be etched down to form nano-scale inverted pyramids. Multicrystalline silicon solar cells, due to poorer crystallographic quality, are less effective than single crystal solar cells, but mc-Si solar cells are still being used widely due to less manufacturing difficulties. It is reported that multicrystalline solar cells can be surface-textured to yield solar energy conversion efficiency comparable to that of monocrystalline silicon cells, through isotropic etching or photolithography techniques. Incident <b>light</b> <b>rays</b> onto a textured surface do not reflect back out to the air as opposed to rays onto a flat surface. Rather some <b>light</b> <b>rays</b> are bounced back onto the other surface again due to the geometry of the surface. This process significantly improves light to electricity conversion efficiency, due to increased light absorption. This texture effect as well as the interaction with other interfaces in the PV module is a challenging optical simulation task. A particularly efficient method for modeling and optimization is the OPTOS formalism. In 2012, researchers at MIT reported that c-Si films textured with nanoscale inverted pyramids could achieve light absorption comparable to 30 times thicker planar c-Si. In combination with anti-reflective coating, surface texturing technique can effectively trap <b>light</b> <b>rays</b> within a thin film silicon solar cell. Consequently, required thickness for solar cells decreases with the increased absorption of <b>light</b> <b>rays.</b>|$|E
