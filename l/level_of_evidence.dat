25|$|The Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), {{the federal}} agency {{responsible}} for funding health research, recommended in 2010 against funding a pan-Canadian trial of liberation therapy {{because there was a}} lack of evidence on the safety or efficacy of the procedure. It suggested a scientific expert working group made up of the principal investigators for the seven MS Society-sponsored studies. The health minister accepted the CIHR recommendation and said that Canada was not going to fund clinical trials. The expert panel was created by the end of 2010 together between the CIHR and the MS Society of Canada. It has been proposed that the creation of this expert panel was partly directed to cope with the high levels of social pressure the CCSVI theory had raised and at the same time try to maintain a scientific perspective in the funding and investigation of CCSVI. The main task of the panel was to monitor the results of the ongoing studies in the relationship between CCSVI and MS and recommend the funding of a clinical trial in case that there was evidence of a true relationship between the two. In 2011, the Canadian federal government announced that they would fund clinical trials of the procedure to widen the veins since CIHR considered that evidence of venous abnormalities in MS was enough for small treatment trials. It has been proposed that the recommendation to fund phase I and II trials instead of a big study was a compromise between the high levels of social and political pressure and the low <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> on the theory.|$|E

60|$|While {{psychological}} science, in this example, {{seems to}} treat matters of evidence rather laxly, psychical conjecture, {{on the other}} hand, leaves much unexplained. Thus Mr. Myers puts forward a theory which is, in origin, due to St. Augustine. The saint had observed that {{any one of us}} may be seen in a dream by another person, while our intelligence is absolutely unconscious of any communication. Apply this to ghosts in haunted houses. We may be affected by a hallucination of the presence of a dead man or woman, but he, or she (granting their continued existence after death), may know nothing of the matter. In the same way, there are stories of people who have consciously tried to make others, at a distance, think of them. The subjects of these experiments have, it is said, had a hallucination of the presence of the experimenter. But he is unaware of his success, and has no control over the actions of what old writers, and some new theosophists, call his 'astral body'. Suppose, then, that something conscious endures after death. Suppose that some one thinks he sees the dead. It does not follow that the surviving consciousness (ex hypothesi) of the dead person who seems to be seen, is aware that he is 'manifesting' himself. As Mr. Myers puts it, 'ghosts must therefore, as a rule, represent--not conscious or central currents of intelligence--but mere automatic projections from consciousnesses which have their centres elsewhere,' [Greek]: as Homer makes Achilles say, 'there is no heart in them.' {156} All this is not inconceivable. But all this does not explain the facts, namely, the noises, often very loud, and the movements of objects, and the lights which are the common or infrequent accompaniments of apparitions in haunted houses. Now we have (always on much the same <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence)</b> accounts of similar noises, and movements of untouched objects, occurring where living persons of peculiar constitution are present, or in haunted houses. These things we discuss in an essay on 'The Logic of Table-turning'. By parity of reasoning, or at least by an obvious analogy, we are led to infer that more than 'an automatic projection from the consciousness' of a dead man is present where he is not only seen, but heard, making noises, and perhaps moving objects. If this be admitted then psychical conjecture is pushed back on something very like the old theory of haunted houses, namely, that a ghost, or spiritual entity, is present and active there.|$|E

40|$|This {{systematic}} review {{focused on the}} common conventional physiotherapy interventions used with children with cerebral palsy (CP), aged 4 to 18 years, and critically appraised the recent <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> each of these interventions using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine <b>Levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>Evidence.</b> The search strategy yielded 34 articles after inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. The investigated physiotherapy interventions included strength and functional training, weight-supported treadmill training (WBSTT), and neurodevelopmental treatment (NDT). A category of treatment dosage was also included. Strength training was the most studied intervention with significant improvements found in the strength of selected muscle groups using dynamometry, with fewer studies showing significant improvement in function. Functional training showed improvements in gross motor function, endurance, and temperospatial measures, such as gait speed and stride length. Nonsignificant trends of improvement on the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) and gait velocity were found for WBSTT by a few studies with low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> (case series). <b>Of</b> three studies that evaluated NDT, one high-level evidence study, i. e., randomized controlled trial (RCT) found significant improvements on the GMFM.
