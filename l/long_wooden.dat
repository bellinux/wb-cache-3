5|$|Built between 1117 and 1508, Peterborough Cathedral is {{remarkable}} as the least altered of the Norman cathedrals with only its famous Early English west front, with its later porch and the Perpendicular rebuilding {{of the eastern}} ambulatory by John Wastell being in different styles. J.L. Cartwright wrote of the west front that it is “as magnificent an entrance to a sacred building as could well be imagined.” The <b>long</b> <b>wooden</b> roof of the nave is original and has retained its painting from 1220.|$|E
5|$|In a contest, a row {{of small}} cages, each housing a single male finch, is lined up {{approximately}} six feet apart along a street. The close proximity of the cages increases the number of calls, as the birds sing for mates and to establish territory. A timekeeper begins and ends the contest with a red flag. Every time a bird sings a correct terminating flourish to their callmost often transcribed as susk-e-wieta tally mark in chalk is made on a <b>long</b> <b>wooden</b> stick. The bird singing its song the most times during one hour wins the contest. Champion finches regularly sing hundreds of calls in contests.|$|E
5|$|Traction trebuchet: The {{earliest}} type of trebuchet catapult was the traction trebuchet, developed {{first in}} China by the 5th or 4th century BC, {{the beginning of}} the Warring States period (403–221 BC); to operate the trebuchet, a team of men pulled on ropes attached to the butt of the shorter segment of a <b>long</b> <b>wooden</b> beam separated by a rotating axle fixed to a base framework, allowing the longer segment of the beam to lunge forward and use its sling to hurl a missile; by the 9th century a hybrid of the traction and counterweight trebuchet, employing manpower and a pivoting weight, was used in the Middle East, Mediterranean Basin, and Northern Europe; by the 12th century, the full-fledged counterweight trebuchet was developed under the Ayyubid dynasty of Islamic Syria and Egypt (described by Mardi bin Ali al-Tarsusi) and used in the Third Crusade; by the 13th century, the counterweight trebuchet found its way into Song Dynasty (960–1279) China via the Mongol invaders under Kublai Khan (r. 1260–1294) who used it in the Siege of Xiangyang (1267–1273).|$|E

The dhumpa is traditional played with sticks to produce a rhythmic beat, a technique that continues {{to be used by}} modern tribal musicians.|$|E
25|$|The {{buildings}} at Taos originally had few windows and no standard doorways. Instead, access to rooms was through square {{holes in the}} roof that the people reached by climbing <b>long,</b> <b>wooden</b> ladders. Cedar logs (or vigas) supported roofs that had layers of branches, grass, mud, and plaster covering them. The architecture and the building materials were well suited for {{the rigors of the}} environment and the needs {{of the people in the}} Taos Valley.|$|E

The pantry, accessed from an arched doorway, has a monolithic stone table and a spring from the old cistern. The kitchen, with sink and stone table, is surmounted by a <b>long</b> <b>wooden</b> shelf with chimney, while a long wine cellar is created from a space consisting of six arches.|$|E

25|$|Peat {{is still}} cut as a fuel {{in many areas}} of Lewis. Peat is usually cut in late spring with a tool called a tairsgeir (that is, a peat iron, peat spade, peat knife or tosg; {{sometimes}} toirsgian) which has a <b>long</b> <b>wooden</b> handle with an angled blade on one end. The peat bank is first cleared of heather turfs. The peat, now exposed, is cut using the tairsgeir and the peats thrown out on the bank to dry. A good peat cutter can cut 1000 peats in a day.|$|E
25|$|Cato {{described}} {{the process of}} pressing as taking place in a special room that included an elevated concrete platform containing a shallow basin with raised curbs. The basin was shaped with gentle slopes {{that led to a}} runoff point. Horizontally across the basin were <b>long,</b> <b>wooden</b> beams whose front parts were attached by rope to a windlass. The crushed grapes were placed between the beams, with pressure applied by winding down the windlass. The pressed juice ran down between the beams and collected in the basin. As the construction and use of a wine press was labor-intensive and expensive, its use was generally restricted to large estates, with smaller wineries relying on treading alone to obtain grape juice.|$|E
25|$|Usually {{the chair}} was {{fastened}} to a <b>long</b> <b>wooden</b> beam fixed as a seesaw {{on the edge of}} a pond or river. Sometimes, however, the ducking-stool was not a fixture but was mounted on a pair of wooden wheels so that it could be wheeled through the streets, and at the river-edge was hung by a chain from the end of a beam. In sentencing a woman the magistrates ordered the number of duckings she should have. Yet another type of ducking-stool was called a tumbrel. It was a chair on two wheels with two long shafts fixed to the axles. This was pushed into the pond and then the shafts released, thus tipping the chair up backwards. Sometimes the punishment proved fatal and the victim died.|$|E

25|$|The weapons {{used are}} also in debate. As {{mentioned}} above, some claim Gonnosuke was using a long staff (bo) reinforced with metal rings. Other versions claim he used an exceptionally <b>long</b> <b>wooden</b> sword which was above {{the average length of}} a Japanese sword over four shaku 1 long, (roughly 121cm or 48 inches), instead of the normal length bokuto of around 2.45 Shaku (roughly 74cm or 29 inches). Musashi's weapon of choice is also debated. One version say he was armed with only a half-finished bokuto, which Musashi was actually still carving as the duel began, and used it to overwhelm Gonnosuke without ever using the X-shaped block, instead hitting him lightly on the forehead as to demonstrate his superior stance in battle and emphasizing proper distance to an opponent, or Maai.|$|E
25|$|County Wexford saw the {{heaviest}} fighting of 1798 rebellion was fought, with significant battles at Enniscorthy and New Ross and numerous 1798 memorials are {{scattered throughout the}} county. The famous ballad Boolavogue was written in remembrance of the Wexford Rising. Numerous 1798 memorials are scattered throughout the county. The French Revolution was a big influence {{on many of the}} rebels who took part and many were also United Irishmen. A common weapon used by the Wexford rebels was the pike, made by local blacksmiths – one modification usually included was a hook, used primarily to cut a horse's reins. The iron or steel spearhead was attached to a <b>long</b> <b>wooden</b> shaft – made of ash. Blacksmiths were especially targeted as suspected United Irishmen prior to the rebellion and type of torture known as pitchcapping was widely employed by British troops in Wexford to obtain information.|$|E
25|$|In {{the month}} between 19 July and 20 August, Mermaid {{captured}} ten vessels, five {{of which she}} burnt or scuttled. Four were the French settee Bien Venue, which had been sailing from Fréjus to Marseilles with deals (<b>long</b> <b>wooden</b> planks), the French settee San Antonio, which was sailing from Oneglia to La Silva with a cargo of snuff, the French settee Saint Pierre, which was sailing from Bandol to Marseilles with firewood, and an unnamed Spanish settee carrying barilla. Mermaid ran one French settee, which was carrying wheat, ashore and scuttled her too. The three vessels Mermaid kept were the Spanish sloop Saint Juan Baptiste, which was sailing from Cette to Genoa with wine, an unnamed Spanish settee carrying barilla, the French settee Sainte Barbe, which was sailing from Marseilles with wheat, the French ketch Notre dame de la Providence, which was sailing from Marseilles to Genoa with wine and flour, and the Genoese settee Conception, which was sailing from Bandol to Genoa with wine.|$|E

25|$|After being flayed, {{the skin}} is soaked in water for about a day. This removes blood and grime from the skin and prepares it for a {{dehairing}} liquor. The dehairing liquor was originally made of rotted, or fermented, vegetable matter, like beer or other liquors, but by the Middle Ages an unhairing bath included lime. Today, the lime solution is occasionally sharpened {{by the use of}} sodium sulfide. The liquor bath would have been in wooden or stone vats and the hides stirred with a <b>long</b> <b>wooden</b> pole to avoid human contact with the alkaline solution. Sometimes the skins would stay in the unhairing bath for eight or more days depending how concentrated and how warm the solution was kept—unhairing could take up to twice as long in winter. The vat was stirred {{two or three times a}} day to ensure the solution's deep and uniform penetration. Replacing the lime water bath also sped the process up. However, if the skins were soaked in the liquor too long, they would be weakened and not able to stand the stretching required for parchment.|$|E
25|$|The 83 × 67cm (33 × 26 in) {{painting}} shows a half-length {{portrait of}} the painter Édouard Manet. In this self-portrait as painter he depicted himself as a stylish Boulevardier {{in front of a}} dark background. The depicted wears a black top hat and a brown jacket, under which is a white shirt, of which only the collar can be seen. The neckline of the suit jacket covers a black silk tie which is affixed by a tie pin. In the right, only vaguely depicted hand he holds a <b>long</b> <b>wooden</b> brush with red paint on the tip; the left hand holds a painting palette with about three more brushes. No further accessories are shown. The figure is lit from the left by which the shadows beneath the left arm and the right half of the face are created. His pose is slightly turned to the right, so that the right half of the body is darker than the forward, left half. The painter's gaze is directed forwards at the viewer.|$|E
500|$|Raimi {{developed}} {{a sense of}} mise en scène, coming up with ideas for scenes at a fast rate. He had drawn several crude illustrations to help him break down the flow of scenes. The crew was surprised when Raimi began using dutch angles during shots to build atmosphere during scenes. To accommodate Raimi's style of direction, several elaborate, low-budget rigs had to be built, since the crew could not afford a camera dolly. One involved the [...] "vas-o-cam", which relied on a mounted camera that was slid down <b>long</b> <b>wooden</b> platforms {{to create a more}} fluid sense of motion.|$|E

500|$|The {{houses of}} the nobles were {{constructed}} according to these same cultural norms, with several additions. [...] They were distinguishable from the outside by their walls made of upright wooden planks and the <b>long</b> <b>wooden</b> horns (tandrotrano) formed by the crossing of the roof beams {{at each end of}} the roof peak. [...] The length of the tandrotrano was indicative of rank: the longer the length, the higher the status of the noble family that lived within. The interior of the building was also somewhat modified, often featuring three central pillars rather than one and occasionally a wooden platform bed raised high off the ground.|$|E
500|$|Several of the church's pews {{date from}} 1857 {{and remain in}} use. The pews, quite simple in form, have a [...] "minimalist appearance". Each pew {{consists}} of a <b>long</b> <b>wooden</b> plank {{that serves as the}} seat, with a thin rail supported by three spindles as the backrest. The pews are supported by three arched supports joined to the seat by a mortise and tenon joint and reinforced with nails. The newer pews exhibit identical design elements but are constructed with modern nails and timber. Though most of the pews are arranged against the church's west elevation with a center aisle, two are along the north elevation and four are along the south elevation. The pulpit is situated at the east elevation. There is an upright piano in the northeastern corner of the church.|$|E
500|$|The {{shows at}} the club were choreographed by Larry Steele for many years, {{along with those of}} the nearby Paradise Club, and often {{featured}} [...] "comedians dressed like clowns, plantation hands, and frumpy old ladies [...] dirty jokes to start things off". A full chorus line called the Sepia Revue featured 12 showgirls dressed in [...] "black high heels, skimpy, sequined dresses, long boas and feathered headgear" [...] dancing with more and more abandon as the [...] "red hot" [...] house band backed them up. Another chorus line called Beige Beauties also performed artistic dance numbers. There was no applause at the club. Guests found <b>long</b> <b>wooden</b> sticks with wooden balls at the end called [...] "table knockers" [...] at their tables. [...] Patrons were to hit the table with their knockers to indicate their appreciation of performances.|$|E
