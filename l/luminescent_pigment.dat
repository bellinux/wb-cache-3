40|$|The {{evolution}} of clay soil porosity is currently demonstrated via the shrinkage curves {{in a large}} water content domain spreading from a shrinkage limit to a liquidity limit. In fact, the parallel between in situ profiles and the shrinkage curves in such a large water content range is difficult to obtain {{because of the lack}} of earth pressure in the laboratory tests and in situ limited water contents. The vertical distribution of porosity throughout a clay-rich marsh soil profile was studied in a grassland field with samples taken from the soil surface characterized by water contents near their shrinkage limit down to 2. 00 m deep saturated sediments over their liquidity limit. The depth of the plasticity limit isolates a soil in a solid state characterized by a vertical prism-like structure from a plastic to pseudo-liquid state in depth. The porosity was calculated from the measurements of the density of intact samples by double weighing and image analysis of 100 cm 2 polished sections. The initial structure of clay soil was maintained by impregnation based on water–acetone–resin exchange. An ultraviolet photo <b>luminescent</b> <b>pigment</b> added to the resin allowed the capture of images from which shrinkage cracks and microporosity of the clay matrix were easily separated. The distribution of porosity between the shrinkage crack mesoporosity and the clay matrix microporosity was evaluated after the mathematical decomposition of the grey level curves characteristic of each level. Vertical {{evolution of}} the porosity distribution from the soil surface in a solid state to the plastic and pseudo-liquid sediment in depth was presented on the shrinkage curve of the clay material. The measurements point out how the clay matrix microporosity and mesoporosity of shrinkage cracks are complementary and the role of the scale effect on the shrinkage curve. The analysis of images captured on an optical microscope under polarized and analyzed light and the SEM observation of freeze-dried samples demonstrated the isotropic arrangement of the clay particles in typical “honey-comb” architecture in the in situ plastic-to-liquid saturated domain. Eventually the distribution of porosity through the profile results from the evolution of the initial “honey-comb” microstructure of the sediment induced by the desiccation phenomenon. It is governed by the depth of plasticity limit of the clay material and by the depth of the water table...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- This {{paper is}} based on a {{printing}} industry research project nearing completion [1]. While <b>luminescent</b> <b>pigments</b> have been used for many years, provision of fast response quality control systems have been challenging, primarily due to large and expensive components that are integral to spectroscopy instrumentation. Characteristics of the light sources and detectors used together with application of three levels of detection systems are described...|$|R
30|$|In {{the study}} of Hellenistic sculpture, either {{large-scale}} marble or small-scale terracotta, both these photo-induced luminescence imaging techniques find equivalence, as the mapping of its defining pigments; Egyptian blue (using VIL) and rose organic pigments, such as madder lake (using UVL), are of equal importance to the visualization of the whole [20]. However, current conventional methodologies for the digital mapping of these two <b>luminescent</b> <b>pigments</b> rely on the separate application of these two techniques, as each requires a different illumination source and acquisition set-up [13, 21].|$|R

30|$|The above {{approach}} {{is useful in}} that it allows visualization of the hue {{but also of the}} intensity of the luminescence, which in certain cases, may be distinctive of the red lake [29]. To optimise the results of such an approach, albeit limited, the use of a series of commercial luminescent standards to allow colour and luminance calibration could be considered. 7 However, although a systematic investigation assessing the performance of the photo-induced luminescence images, in cross-validation with corresponding spectral data [24], has demonstrated that the {{approach is}} sufficiently sensitive and reliable for the detection and mapping of <b>luminescent</b> <b>pigments</b> directly on works of art, at present the direct characterisation of the natural source of the lake pigments based exclusively on imaging data, even when accurately calibrated, remains tenuous at best. This is particularly the case when considering that a pigment may be made up of a combination of colorants from different biological sources, as discussed earlier.|$|R
30|$|Efforts {{have also}} been made to mirror the {{accessibility}} of the acquisition set-up by offering practical post-processing tools based on established methodologies for the correction of luminescence images and open-source image processing software. The result {{is a set of}} alternative/complementary approaches towards the visualisation and evaluation of luminescence in VIL/VIVL images, which allow these to be interpreted meaningfully and with an immediacy which circumvents the need for specialist knowledge. It is important to highlight that, in the case studies presented, the observations made from such an appraisal of these images have additionally been verified analytically, confirming not only the identities of both pigments investigated at the locations indicated by the luminescence images but, in some cases, also providing evidence for regions where these pigments co-exist as mixtures. The visualisations created, particularly those that overlay the monochrome images, are therefore more than just pigment maps but also evidence of the techniques used to create the polychrome finishes of the objects investigated. Although these methods are apposite par excellence to the study of Hellenistic sculpture, their wider applicability as a significant user-friendly contribution to the study of <b>luminescent</b> <b>pigments</b> is evident.|$|R
40|$|Host¿guest {{composites}} with photonic antenna {{properties are}} described. The material consists of cylindrical zeolite L crystals the channels {{of which are}} filled with chains of joined but electronically non-interacting dye molecules. Light shining on a crystal is first absorbed and the energy is then transported by the dye molecules inside the tubes to the desired part. Data on crystals in the size range of 30 nm up to 3000 nm are reported. The synthesis principle we are using {{is based on the}} fact that molecules can diffuse into individual channels. This means that given the appropriate conditions, they can also leave the zeolite by the same way. In some cases, however, it is desirable to block their way out, for stability reasons. This is done by adding a closure molecule. The general approach to connect the antenna function to its surroundings is to add stopcock molecules which generally consist of a head, a spacer and a label. They can either trap excitation energy on the external surface or inject excitation energy into the dye-loaded crystal. The stopcock molecules act as bridges between the dye molecules inside the channels and the outside world. Functionalisation of the closure and the stopcock molecules is an option for tuning e. g. wettability, refractive index, and chemical reactivity. The wide-ranging tunability of the dye¿zeolite L composites makes them useful for many applications. We discuss demonstration experiments which show the process of energy transfer and energy migration as educational tools, applications as high quality and non-toxic pigments, use as strongly <b>luminescent</b> <b>pigments</b> applicable as colour-changing media for LEDs, options for realising nanoscaled laser materials, and finally the challenge for realising solid state solar cells based on sensitisation of a thin semiconductor layer by energy transfer, the reversal of which can also lead to a new generation of LED...|$|R
40|$|Ara Lucidus was {{presented}} in London {{for the first time}} after its debut at the 56 th Venice Biennale (2014). It is an enticing and complex visual work that incorporates hand-blown Murano glass, innovative computer programming and Khoo’s ongoing research into bioluminescence, to create an atmospheric world of changing light and glowing sources. As you entered the Chapel you experienced the changing projections and are immediately transported into Dante’s world. Ara Lucidus is a site-specific installation created by Iyvone Khoo. The work was initiated in response to the theme Gotika for the 2015 edition of Glasstress, a Collateral event of the Venice Biennale between the Palazzo Franchetti and the Island of Murano. Medieval Gothic minds were ruled by many fears; fear of God, of nature and of the unknown. Fireflies were believed to be souls, and their light was seen as a mysterious, magical and supernatural phenomenon. The installation occupies a juncture where science, art and the spiritual meet. Inspired by a common thread in bioluminescence, the work synthesizes the past with the present. Taking references from Dante’s Divine Comedy the idea crystallized into a dynamic contemporary ‘light altar’ using lasers, LEDs, ultraviolet light and video projection alongside wooden, plastic and hand-blown glass elements. Set in darkness, a throne sits on a wooden raft, with monstrous roots that cling onto a prayer pew. On the throne is a screen and within it is an inverted glowing skull, embedded with <b>luminescent</b> <b>pigments</b> that symbolize 'Cold Hell' and Dante's ascension to Purgatory. Growing out of the screen is a glowing glass heart that sprouts from a tree. This relates to Dante's lost love, Beatrice and his quest for Illumination amongst the 'Dark Woods'. By tracing the origin of the scientific term ‘Luciferin’ (the light-emitting molecule in bioluminescent organisms) the artist’s research has led to the miraculous ‘Liquor Lucidus’, a shining liquid allegedly prepared from flying glow-worms by the German monk Albertus Magnus (1193 - 1280) and undoubtedly the first recorded bioluminescent potion...|$|R
30|$|Photo-induced {{luminescence}} imaging techniques, such as UV-induced visible luminescence (UVL) and {{the more}} recently developed technique of visible-induced infrared luminescence (VIL), have been invaluable {{for the study of}} ancient polychromy, allowing the detection and mapping of luminescent materials, such as varnishes, consolidants, organic binders, and crucially, traces of pigments, organic and inorganic, that are often not visible to the naked eye. In the context of works from the Hellenistic period onwards, the detection of two pigments, Egyptian blue and rose madder lake, has been particularly pivotal in advancing the field. Current conventional methodologies for the digital mapping of these two <b>luminescent</b> <b>pigments</b> rely on the separate application of two techniques (VIL and UVL), each requiring a different illumination source and acquisition set-up. In this study, a novel approach is proposed, combining the use of visible-induced infrared luminescence and visible-induced visible luminescence to locate these two pigments. As the source of illumination in both cases is the same system of LEDs, the set-up has the advantage of requiring only minor filter changes between luminescence modes. The increased portability and safety compared to the use of methodologies that employ UV radiation represent notable advantages of this integrated system. The interchangeability between highly selective excitation sources, also significantly simplifies the experimental set-up and the need to adjust the object or equipment between acquisitions, ensuring better reproducibility of the data acquired and facilitating any post-processing procedures. This results in a user-friendly methodology for both experts and non-specialists alike. Three Hellenistic period terracottas; two from Canosa di Puglia, Italy (270 – 200 BC) and one from Myrina, Turkey (c. 100 BC), all characterised by large well-preserved areas of decoration in Egyptian blue and red lake, were studied in order to trial the approach. Comparisons were made with the more standard techniques of VIL and UVL, and it was shown that the combined method proposed efficiently detects and maps both of these pigments with analogous results to those obtained by more established methodologies. The observations made from the multispectral images acquired were verified by analysis of small samples of the pigments, using FTIR and Raman spectroscopy and HPLC-DAD analysis.|$|R
40|$|In conservation, science {{semiconductors}} {{occur as}} the constituent {{matter of the}} so-called semiconductor pigments, produced following the Industrial Revolution and extensively used by modern painters. With recent research highlighting the occurrence of various degradation phenomena in semiconductor paints, {{it is clear that}} their detection by conventional optical fluorescence imaging and microscopy is limited by the complexity of historical painting materials. Here, we illustrate and prove the capabilities of time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) microscopy, equipped with both spectral and lifetime sensitivity at timescales ranging from nanoseconds to hundreds of microseconds, for the analysis of cross-sections of paint layers made of <b>luminescent</b> semiconductor <b>pigments.</b> The method is sensitive to heterogeneities within micro-samples and provides valuable information for the interpretation {{of the nature of the}} emissions in samples. A case study is presented on micro samples from a painting by Henri Matisse and serves to demonstrate how TRPL can be used to identify the semiconductor pigments zinc white and cadmium yellow, and to inform future investigations of the degradation of a cadmium yellow paint...|$|R
40|$|While the photophysical {{properties}} of ZnO nanostructures {{have been widely}} explored, less {{research has focused on}} the bulk material present in artist pigments. This study is based on the analysis of historical pastels, representative of artist materials available {{at the turn of the}} twentieth century, and of the pure powder pigment as the control sample. The study of the intensity of the photoluminescence emission as a function of the fluence and of the nanosecond and microsecond emission decay kinetic properties allows the elucidation of the emission mechanisms in control ZnO and historical samples containing ZnO. Data suggest that in historical samples the near-band-edge free-exciton photoluminescence emission, typically occurring in the pure semiconductor, is influenced by the interaction of the pigment with surrounding organic binding material. Conversely, crystal defects, typically expected in historical samples following the imperfect synthesis process available at the beginning of the twentieth century, introduce minor modifications to the photoluminescence emission. The study further suggests that zinc carboxylates, detected in all historical samples and known to introduce characteristic groups on the surface of ZnO, could be responsible for changes in emission mechanisms. Research demonstrates how photoluminescence decay kinetics and the study of the dependence of the emission intensity on the fluence are powerful methods for elucidating the nature of the mechanism processes in <b>luminescent</b> semiconductor <b>pigments...</b>|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that oil {{paintings}} containing zinc white are subject to rapid degradation. This {{is caused by the}} interaction between the active groups of binder and the metal ions of the pigment, which gives rise to the formation of new zinc complexes (metal soaps). Ongoing studies on zinc white paints have been limited to the chemical mechanisms that lead to the formation of zinc complexes. On the contrary, little is known of the photo-physical changes induced in the zinc oxide crystal structure following this interaction. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy has been applied to follow modifications in the <b>luminescent</b> zinc white <b>pigment</b> when mixed with binder. Significant changes in trap state photoluminescence emissions have been detected: the enhancement of a blue emission combined with a change of the decay kinetic of the well-known green emission. Complementary data from molecular analysis of paints using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirms the formation of zinc carboxylates and corroborates the mechanism for zinc complexes formation. We support the hypothesis that zinc ions migrate into binder creating novel vacancies, affecting the photoluminescence intensity and lifetime properties of zinc oxide. Here, we further demonstrate the advantages of a time-resolved photoluminescence approach for studying defects in semiconductor pigments...|$|R
30|$|The {{acquisition}} {{window of}} the Lee No. 21 filter (540 – 700  nm) is smaller in wavelength range but also lower in transmittance than the typical acquisition window for UVL images (420 – 700  nm, for {{the combination of the}} Schott KV 418 cut-on and IDAS-UIBAR bandpass filters used in this study). This means that although the reflected light from the excitation source is largely excluded (as can be observed from the 99 % tile of the Spectralon® reference scale in these images) and the contrast between the luminescence recorded and the reflected light is comparable to that observed in the UVL image, certain emission wavelengths (in the green/yellow range) are also significantly cut-off. Therefore, while the VIVL images captured using the No. 21 filter are efficient in mapping the distribution of the <b>luminescent</b> red lake <b>pigments,</b> the limited transmittance in the 540 – 700  nm window introduces a constraint for using this method to probe the relationship between luminescence properties and molecular composition of the lake pigment, where the differences in the emitted luminescence could be used for differentiating between red lakes from different biological sources. This would be particularly limiting where the emission characteristics present only slight differences, as is the case for madder vs. cochineal or kermes lake pigments [38], or in cases where the pigment is made up of a combination of colorants from different biological sources, as found for one of the sample of purple pigment (C 3, Fig.  3) analysed in this study. The use of an adequate filter of wider and higher transmittance would increase the potential applicability of the method for screening (or making a preliminary distinction of) red lakes. Unfortunately, although the Lee No. 16 filter, has a (slightly) larger acquisition window (approx. 475 – 700  nm) and higher transmittance, in this case, the higher transparency partly overlaps with the Blue LED emission spectrum and allows too much of the reflected light through from the illumination source (as is apparent from the 99 % tile of the Spectralon® reference scale in these images). As a result, the uncorrected images appear very blue and the contrast between the emitted and reflected radiation is decreased. The effects of ambient stray light may be somewhat remedied by the choice of more efficient filters or by the application of stray light correction as part of the post-processing of the images. However, given that the range of possible acquisition windows for both UVL and VIVL images, may vary widely according to the particular properties of the experimental set-up chosen, the issue of colour calibration based on agreed standards is vital, in order to obtain set-up-independent, comparable results, which could reliably be used to distinguish luminescence emitted from different materials based on colour information. To address these issues, the application of post-processing techniques for the removal of stray light and colour calibration is invaluable.|$|R
