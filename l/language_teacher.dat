40|$|AbstractFor {{assessment}} {{to have an}} impact on student achievement, teachers need to see assessment as an integral part of the instructional process rather than as an evaluation device to determine students’ grades. The present study aimed at exploring how <b>language</b> <b>teachers</b> conceive <b>language</b> assessment and whether these conceptions differ according to teaching experience. Accordingly, prospective <b>language</b> <b>teachers</b> and <b>language</b> <b>teachers</b> with different years of teaching experience were asked to describe, language assessment’ using a metaphor.

25|$|Pimsleur {{language}} learning system {{is based on}} the research of and model programs developed by American <b>language</b> <b>teacher</b> Paul Pimsleur. It involves recorded 30-minute lessons to be done daily, with each lesson typically featuring a dialog, revision, and new material. Students are asked to translate phrases into the target language, and occasionally to respond in the target language to lines spoken in the target language. The instruction starts in the student's language but gradually changes to the target language. Several all-audio programs now exist to teach various languages using the Pimsleur Method. The syllabus is the same in all languages.|$|E

The syllabus is ordered around the easiest and most useful features of the language, and as such is different for each language.|$|E
