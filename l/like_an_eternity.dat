Joan Rivers, whom I adored and met on The Tonight Show during my reign, was particularly relentless. Just when I figured she'd exhausted every possible Vanessa Williams joke, she'd have a whole new slew of them." [...] Williams would also later tell of one audition that she had during the late 1980s for a theatrical role. She was denied the role, however, because [...] "the wife of lyricist Ira Gershwin decreed: 'Over my dead body will that whore be in my show.'

60|$|She {{crouched}} {{over until}} she became still. A moment of stillness seemed {{to cover her}} <b>like</b> sleep: <b>an</b> <b>eternity</b> of sleep in that one second.

60|$|As she sat there, {{she thought}} over her whole little life, all full of one thought, one purpose, one love, one prayer, for this being so strangely {{given to her}} out of that silent sea, which lay so <b>like</b> <b>a</b> still <b>eternity</b> around her,--and she {{revolved}} again what meant the vision of her childhood.

60|$|It was one {{of those}} wonderfully clear {{moonlight}} evenings, when the ocean, like a great reflecting mirror, seems to double the brightness of the sky,--and its vast expanse lay all around them in its stillness, <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>eternity</b> of waveless peace. Mara remembered that time in her girlhood when she had followed Moses into the woods on just such a night,--how she had sat there under the shadows of the trees, and looked over to Harpswell and noticed the white houses and the meeting-house, all so bright and clear in the moonlight, and then off again {{on the other side of}} the island where silent ships were coming and going in the mysterious stillness. They were talking together now with that outflowing fullness which comes when the seal of some great reserve has just been broken,--going back over their lives from day to day, bringing up incidents of childhood, and turning them gleefully like two children.|$|E
60|$|The deep {{stillness of}} the autumn {{afternoon}} presently became almost oppressive to her. There was the far-off, sweet low murmur of a placid sea rolling in upon {{the base of the}} cliffs, the constant chirping of ground insects, and the occasional scurrying of a rabbit through the undergrowth. Once a great lean rat stole up from the ditch, and--horrible--ran across his body; but at the sound of her startled movement it paused, sat for a moment quite still, with its wide-open black eyes blinking at her, and then to her inexpressible relief scampered away. She was used to the country, with its intense unbroken silence, but she had never felt it so hard to bear as on that afternoon. Time became purely relative to her. As a matter of fact, she knew afterwards that she could not have been alone more than five minutes. It was <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>eternity.</b> She listened in vain for any human sound, even for the far-off sweep of the scythe in the bracken, or the call of the laborer to his horses. The tension of those moments was horrible.|$|E
60|$|Then {{suddenly}} a sound caught their ears, which caused each man {{to start and}} {{to look at his}} nearest companion with set inquiring eyes; it was the sound of a woman's skirt swishing against the stone-work of the floor.

The different types of fragments (anecdotes, maxims, aphorisms, bio-moments, short essays [...] .) that constitute Cioran's work and that mark its variations, appear to result from sloughing (multiple passages and displacement), so that the one who "sloughes" is never the same but does not fundamentally change.

As suggested in First Principles (§ 136 in the edition of 1862, and § 182 in subsequent editions), there must, after there have been effected all those minor dissolutions which follow evolutions, remain to be effected the dissolutions of the great bodies in and on which the minor evolutions and dissolutions have taken place; and it was argued that such dissolutions will be, at some time or other, effected by those immense transformations of molar motion into molecular motion, consequent on collisions: the argument being based on the statement of Sir John Herschel, that in clusters of stars collisions must inevitably occur. It may, however, be objected that though such a result may be reasonably looked for in closely aggregated assemblages of stars, {{it is difficult to}} conceive of its taking place throughout our Sidereal System at large, the members of which, and their intervals, may be roughly figured as pins-heads 50 miles apart.
