The differential heat of dilution data obtained were correlated with simple polynomial equations for the three working fluids {{as a function of}} the solution concentration and temperature. The results showed that the differential heat of dilution of the non-conventional working fluid mixtures is lower than that of water/LiBr at typical operating temperature and concentration of interest in absorption cooling cycles employing these working fluid mixtures.

40|$|Lithium {{has been}} {{reported}} to increase radioactive iodine (RaI) doses in benign thyroid disease and in differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC). It is not known whether lithium influences the outcome of RaI therapy in DTC. We therefore studied the clinical effects of RaI without and with lithium carbonate in patients with proven metastatic DTC. Controversy also exists on the mechanism by which lithium increases RaI dose in DTC. We performed an in vitro study specifically aimed at examining the effects of lithium on the sodium iodide symporter (NIS). In a clinical study, 12 patients were selected with metastases of DTC who had received previous RaI therapy without lithium (control) that had not influenced tumour progression, despite RaI accumulation in metastases. The patients received 1200 mg lithium carbonate/day followed by 6000 MBq RaI. Outcome parameters were RaI uptake, serum thyroglobulin (Tg) levels and radiological dimensions of metastases compared between RaI with lithium and control. In an in vitro study, iodide uptake was studied in the benign rat thyroid cell line FRTL- 5, in the polarized non-thyroid MDCK cell line, stably transfected with human sodium iodide symporter (hNIS) to study the effects of lithium on NIS in a non-thyroid background, and the human follicular thyroid carcinoma cell line FTC 133 -hNIS to study lithium effects in a background of DTC. Lithium chloride (LiCl) was added in concentrations up to 2 mM for 0 - 48 h. Both steady-state iodide uptake (30 min) and initial rate (2 min) were studied using a specific activity of 100 mCi/mmol I, the latter experiment to determine lithium effects on substrate dependency. Iodide efflux studies were performed as well. Despite an increased uptake of RaI in seven patients, no beneficial effect of RaI with lithium was observed on the clinical course as assessed by serum Tg measurements and radiographically. In the in vitro studies, no effects of LiCl on iodide uptake or efflux were observed. The addition of lithium to RaI did not have any beneficial effects on the clinical course in 12 patients with metastatic DTC. No beneficial effects of <b>lithium</b> on <b>iodide</b> uptake were observed in vitro. Therefore, the clinical value of lithium in DTC remains subject to debat...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{report on}} the {{development}} of novel neutron scintillators fabricated in microcolumnar formats using the physical vapour deposition (PVD) method. Such structures mitigate the conventional trade-off between spatial resolution and detection efficiency by channelling the scintillation light towards the detector while minimizing lateral spread in the film. Consequently, high resolution and high contrast neutron images can be acquired in a time efficient manner. In this paper, we discuss methods and characterization for scintillator films made from three distinct compositions, Thallium (Tl) or Europium (Eu) doped Lithium CesiumIodide (Li 3 Cs 2 I 5 :Tl,Eu, referred to as LCI), Tl or Eudoped <b>Lithium</b> Sodium <b>Iodide</b> (LixNa 1 -xI:Tl,Eu, referred to as LNI), and Cerium (Ce) -doped Gadolinium Iodide (GdI 3 :Ce, referred to as GDI). LCI and LNI scintillators are derived from the well-known CsI and NaI scintillators by the incorporation of 6 Li into their lattice. Based on our measurements reported here, LCI/LNI scintillators have shown to exhibit bright emissions, fast, sub-microsecond decay, and an ability to effectively discriminate between neutron and gamma interactions using pulse shape (PSD) and/or pulse height (PHD) discrimination. LCI has a density of 4. 5 g/cm 3, a measured peak emission wavelength of 460 nm (doped with Eu), and a light yield of ∼ 50, 000 photons/thermal neutron. LNI has a density of 3. 6 g/cm 3, an emission peak measured at 420 nm, and a light yield of ∼ 100, 000 photons/thermal neutron. The recently discovered GDI exhibits excellent scintillation properties including a bright emission of up to 5, 000 photons/thermal neutron interaction, 550 nm green emission, a rise time of ∼ 0. 5 ns and a primary decay time of ∼ 38 ns (Glodo et al., 2006). Its high thermal neutron cross-section of ∼ 255 kb makes it an attractive candidate for neutron detection and imaging. Although it has high density of 5. 2 gm/cm 3 and effective atomic number of 57, its gamma sensitivity can be minimized by lowering the film thickness and its neutron sensitivity can be maximized through the use of enriched Gd. The fabrication of micro-structured films of these materials using an evaporation technique permits the cost-effective volume synthesis of high-quality neutron scintillators over large areas (20 cm x 20 cm) in short time. In addition, the vapour deposition permits stoichiometry and dopant control not possible using conventional crystal growth...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTechnetium- 99 (Tc) and iodine- 129 (I) are two {{long-lived}} {{fission products}} of high volatility, which makes their study in glass structure challenging. Both technetium and iodine have broad ranging multivalent chemistry and complex reactivity dependent on redox conditions; technetium and iodine redox may vary from Tc 0 to Tc 7 + and from I- to I 7 +. Relatively {{few studies have}} been done on their speciation in glass, in part because of their low retention at the temperatures required for glass melting. To better understand the redox and structural behavior of Tc and I in various nuclear waste glasses, a series of technetium- and iodine-containing borosilicate glasses of varied chemistry were prepared at scales ranging from a few grams to hundreds of kilograms. Technetium was included in both high-level and low-level nuclear waste glass formulations under a variety of redox conditions at concentrations ranging from 0. 003 wt% to 0. 06 wt%. Non-radioactive iodine glass samples were prepared in crucible melts using excess amounts of sodium or potassium iodide salts or ammonium iodate that resulted in concentrations ranging from 0. 04 to 1. 27 wt% iodine. These samples were also compared to glasses prepared in pilot-scale experiments in which the overall retentions reached 48 % and 34 % for technetium and iodine, respectively. Tc and I speciation in the resulting glasses were determined by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). While technetium was found as Tc 0, Tc 4 +, and Tc 7 +, only I- was identified in these glasses. Previous studies of Tc local environment information inferred from K-edge XAS and Raman spectroscopy identified pertechnetate tetrahedra surrounded by network-modifying cations in oxidized glasses and octahedral TcO 6 units in glasses prepared under reducing conditions.
