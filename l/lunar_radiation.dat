The first of these reached an altitude of only around 100000 km, serendipitously gathering data that established the presence of the Van Allen radiation belts before reentering Earth's atmosphere. The second passed by the Moon at a distance of more than 60000 km, twice as far as planned and too far away to trigger either of the on-board scientific instruments, yet still becoming the first U.S. spacecraft to reach a solar orbit.|$|E
5000|$|Pioneer 4 was an American spin-stabilized {{unmanned}} spacecraft launched {{as part of}} the Pioneer program on a lunar flyby trajectory and into a heliocentric orbit making it the first probe of the United States to escape from the Earth's gravity.

It passed within 58,983 km of the Moon's surface. However, Pioneer 4 did not come close enough to trigger its photoelectric sensor. The spacecraft was still in solar orbit as of 1969.

The micrometeorite detector and sun scanner were mounted on the sphere. The difference between the payload of Pioneer P-30 and the earlier Pioneer P-3 was the replacement of the TV facsimile system on P-3 with a scintillation spectrometer to study the Earth's (and possible <b>lunar)</b> <b>radiation</b> belts, mounted on the instrument platform, and a plasma probe mounted on the sphere to measure energy and momentum distribution of protons above a few kilovolts to study the radiation effect of solar flares.

50|$|The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) is {{the first}} mission of the LPRP program. Management of LRO was {{assigned}} to Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in 2004. LRO launched on an Atlas V 401 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on June 18, 2009 at 5:32 p.m. EDT (2132 GMT). The planned lift off for 5:12 p.m. EDT (2112 GMT) was slightly delayed by 20 minutes due to thunderstorms.

The LRO will provide a 3-D map of the Moon's surface to allow astronauts to return to the Moon by 2020. On board the LRO are seven instruments, the Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of Radiation (CRaTER), Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment (DLRE), Lyman-Alpha Mapping Project (LAMP), Lunar Exploration Neutron Detector (LEND), Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA), Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC), and Miniature Radio Frequency radar (Mini-RF).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of Radiation (CRaTER) {{instrument}} {{on board}} of LRO character-izes the global <b>lunar</b> <b>radiation</b> environment and its biological impacts by measuring cosmic ray (CR) radiation. A compact and highly precise Micro-dosimeter {{is mounted on}} the CRaTER. It measures dose rates below one micro-rad/sec in <b>lunar</b> <b>radiation</b> environment. Ground level enhancement (GLE) is sudden and short increase of CR intensity measured on the Earth’s ground neutron monitors. Using the CRaTER data, we identified the CR events which have the similar profile of GLE on Earth’s. The GLE event is {{generally considered to be}} caused by the accelerated particles associated with the solar flare and the coronal mass ejections. We use the data of CR in-tensity and dose rates observed by the CRaTER instrument. We select the associated solar events from the solar flare list and solar proton event list from NOAA Space Environment Services Center (SESC). We also use CR data observed by ACE, solar proton flux data observed by GOES. We find seven GLE-like CR events since June 2009. In order to examine the origins and the characteristics of the GLE-like CR events in <b>lunar</b> <b>radiation</b> envi-ronment, we compare time variation profile of CRaTER with those of ACE/CRIS, ACE/SIS, and GOES/SEM. To prove the GLE-like events of the CRaTER data as the real signals, we also check the time variation profile of Micro-dosimeter measurement for a coincidence. We confirm the similarity in profiles of CRaTER and Micro-dosimeter. The intensity variation rate of GLE-like CR events in the Micro-dosimeter is approximately ten times larger than that of GLE-like CR events. We verify that most of GLE-like events are associated with the energetic solar cosmic rays...|$|E

The first two of these challenges are reviewed with more in-depth information. The dangers of dust relate to the particle deposition in the lungs. The dangers of radiation are related to the permissible exposure limit (PEL) and the Risk of Exposure Induced Death (REID), a statistical approach pegged to a single radiation effect: Death from cancer directly attributable to the exposure.

40|$|The Moon {{produces}} radiation which background-limits {{scientific experiments}} there. Early analyses of these backgrounds have either {{failed to take}} into consideration the effect of charm in particle physics (because they pre-dated its discovery), or have used branching ratios which are no longer strictly valid (due to new accelerator data). We are presently investigating an analytical program for deriving muon and neutrino spectra generated by the Moon, converting an existing CERN computer program known as GEANT which does the same for the Earth. In so doing, this will (1) determine an accurate prompt neutrino spectrum produced by the lunar surface; (2) determine the lunar subsurface particle flux; (3) determine the consequence of charm production physics upon the <b>lunar</b> background <b>radiation</b> environment; and (4) provide an analytical tool for the NASA astrophysics community with which to begin an assessment of the Moon as a scientific laboratory versus its particle radiation environment.

Although most of the particle fluence of importance consists of high energy protons from solar particle events (SPEs) and galactic cosmic rays (GCRs), the galactic cosmic ray spectrum also includes a significant component composed of high energy, heavy charged particles with high LET values. These particles are capable of fragmenting themselves and target materials, which causes large energy depositions capable of causing significant biological risk to lunar explorers.
