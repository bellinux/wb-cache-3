5|$|Attachment {{disorders}} tend {{to occur}} in a definable set of contexts such as within some types of institutions, {{in the presence of}} repeated changes of primary caregiver or of extremely neglectful identifiable primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs, but not all children raised in these conditions develop an attachment disorder. Studies undertaken on children from Eastern European orphanages from the mid-1990s showed significantly higher levels of both forms of RAD and of insecure patterns of attachment in the institutionalized children, regardless of how long they had been there. It would appear that children in institutions <b>like</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> unable to form selective attachments to their caregivers. The difference between the institutionalized children and the control group had lessened in the follow-up study three years later, although the institutionalized children continued to show significantly higher levels of indiscriminate friendliness. However, even among children raised in the most deprived institutional conditions the majority did not show symptoms of this disorder.|$|E
5|$|Family {{relationships}} {{are a common}} type of connection between gods. Deities often form male and female pairs, reflecting the importance of procreation in Egyptian religious thought. Families of three deities, with a father, mother, and child, represent {{the creation of new}} life and the succession of the father by the child, a pattern that connects divine families with royal succession. Osiris, Isis, and Horus formed the quintessential family of this type. The pattern they set grew more widespread over time, so that many deities in local cult centers, like Ptah, Sekhmet, and their child Nefertum at Memphis and Amun, Mut, and Khonsu at Thebes, were assembled into family triads. Genealogical connections <b>like</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> changeable, in keeping with the multiple perspectives in Egyptian belief. Hathor, as a fertility goddess, could act as mother to any child god, including the child form of the sun god, although in other circumstances she was the sun god's daughter.|$|E

25|$|Profiles <b>like</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> {{found for}} almost all {{proteins}} listed in Wikipedia. They are generated by {{organizations such as the}} Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation and the European Bioinformatics Institute. Additional information can be found by searching their databases (for an example of the GLUT4 transporter pictured here, see citation). These profiles indicate the level of DNA expression (and hence RNA produced) of a certain protein in a certain tissue, and are color-coded accordingly in the images located in the Protein Box {{on the right side of}} each Wikipedia page.|$|E
25|$|The growing {{importance}} of EcM fungi {{in the field}} of conservation is evidenced by the creation of the Northwest Forest Plan, which offers guidelines to maintain habitats and endangered species. This includes creating databases for endangered fungi and developing strategies to manage and protect them. Another example in a similar vein is the creation of the European Council for the Conservation of Fungi, which works with education about, and the documentation of, endangered fungi on the continent. Organizations and groups <b>like</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> valuable in disseminating knowledge concerning conservation practices for scientists and the public. They also help compile solutions for fields like forest management that act to preemptively halt EcM declines.|$|E
25|$|In Africa, {{since the}} {{beginning}} of the 1990s, the development of middle-class suburbs boomed. Due to the industrialization of many African countries, particularly in cities such as Cairo, Johannesburg and Lagos, the middle class has grown. In an illustrative case of South Africa, RDP housing has been built. In much of Soweto, many houses are American in appearance, but are smaller, and often consist of a kitchen and living room, two or three bedrooms, and a bathroom. However, there are more affluent neighborhoods, more comparable to American suburbs, particularly east of the FNB Stadium. In Cape Town there is a distinct European style which is due to the European influence during the mid-1600s when the Dutch conquered the area. Houses <b>like</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> called Cape Dutch Houses and can be found in the affluent suburbs of Constantia and Bishopscourt.|$|E

Examples of 7-letter pairs in the English language are [...] and nowhere, and Chechen and [...] Other examples of words <b>like</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> shown in the table. The pair gnat and tang is an interesting example which are both ROT13 reciprocals and (taken together) a palindrome.|$|E
500|$|Scientists are {{investigating}} various avenues {{for treatment of}} spinal cord injury. Therapeutic research is focused on two main areas: neuroprotection and neuroregeneration. The former seeks to prevent the harm that occurs from secondary injury in the minutes to weeks following the insult, and the latter aims to reconnect the broken circuits in the spinal cord to allow function to return. [...] Neuroprotective drugs target secondary injury effects including inflammation, damage by free radicals, excitotoxicity (neuronal damage by excessive glutamate signaling), and apoptosis (cell suicide). Several potentially neuroprotective agents that target pathways <b>like</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> under investigation in human clinical trials.|$|E
500|$|Among {{the critics}} of McCarthy's {{approach}} were his colleagues across the country at MIT. Marvin Minsky, Seymour Papert and Roger Schank were trying to solve problems like [...] "story understanding" [...] and [...] "object recognition" [...] that required a machine to think like a person. In order to use ordinary concepts like [...] "chair" [...] or [...] "restaurant" [...] {{they had to make}} all the same illogical assumptions that people normally made. Unfortunately, imprecise concepts <b>like</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> hard to represent in logic. Gerald Sussman observed that [...] "using precise language to describe essentially imprecise concepts doesn't make them any more precise." [...] Schank described their [...] "anti-logic" [...] approaches as [...] "scruffy", as opposed to the [...] "neat" [...] paradigms used by McCarthy, Kowalski, Feigenbaum, Newell and Simon.|$|E

500|$|A {{peculiarity}} of {{the work}} is its inclusion {{of a large number of}} purportedly authentic documents such as extracts from Senate proceedings and letters written by imperial personages. In all it contains around 150 alleged documents, including 68 letters, 60 speeches and proposals to the people or the senate, and 20 senatorial decrees and acclamations. Records <b>like</b> <b>these</b> <b>are</b> quite distinct from the rhetorical speeches often inserted by ancient historians – it was accepted practice for the writer to invent these himself – and on the few occasions when historians (such as Sallust in his work on Catiline or Suetonius in his Twelve Caesars) include such documents, they have generally been regarded as genuine; [...] but almost all those found in the Historia Augusta have been rejected as fabrications, partly on stylistic grounds, partly because they refer to military titles or points of administrative organisation which are otherwise unrecorded until long after the purported date, or for other suspicious content.|$|E

2500|$|Ulf (Kveldulf) had Hallbjorn Halftroll as his {{maternal}} uncle, and {{was known}} for his surpassing size and strength.
