30|$|In {{order to}} improve {{communication}} in a long-distance HSR scenario, <b>leaky</b> <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> (LCX)-based radio communication system [20] was introduced to provide better bandwidth and efficient frequency reuse. The need for repeaters to compensate for transmission losses, high maintenance cost and large deployment cost limits the acceptance of LCX system for high-speed train-ground information transmission. Radio-over-fiber (RoF)-based system [21, 22] with remote antennal units (RAU) deployed along railway lines to transmit data wirelessly to the onboard unit is another promising technology for HSR communication. Support for higher bandwidth, cost-effectiveness, reduced power consumption due to linear radiated antenna, and reduced HO are the major features of RoF technology [23, 24].|$|E

This paper deals with the application of LCXs for indoor localization in a public transport test scenario, run by the Fraunhofer Institute for Transportation and Infrastructure Systems IVI Dresden. In this scenario different systems were tested in a real-vehicle environment and compared to each other. In addition those results are contrasted with a synthetic indoor-test carried out in a corridor of the University of Applied Sciences Dresden, in the following referred to as "academic" scenario.

40|$|A {{review of}} automation, {{robotics}} and communications technology has established {{the need for}} the development of a communications infrastructure capable of supporting future underground hard rock mine automation systems. A series of underground experiments were undertaken at Copper Cliff North Mine to evaluate the design criteria and performance of several communications infrastructures. The work successfully demonstrated the capability of real-time operation of voice, data and stationary video communication as well as surface-to-underground tele-operation of a load-haul-dump machine. This was achieved with a communications system consisting of a broadband bus linked to <b>leaky</b> feeder <b>coaxial</b> <b>cables</b> by means of distributed antenna translators. The success of the trials permitted a strategy for mine automation to be devised. The economic benefits of mine automation were estimated by means of economic models developed for the mine. Projected benefits, evaluated in terms of mining cost reduction, throughput time and quality improvement, were concluded to be significant. As a result of the analysis, future research and development is concluded to be best targeted at improving ore grade, optimizing process productivity and maximizing machine utilization...|$|R
40|$|In this study, tunnels radio {{coverage}} utilizing <b>leaky</b> <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> has been described. This cable can be deployed {{as a base}} station antenna for indoor wireless system such as tunnels. The older type of leaky cables is called coupled mode, while latest type is called radiation mode. These two modes can be distinguished by their radiation pattern, method of radiation (i. e., wave or energy) and class of slot on outer conductor. To obtain the field radiation patterns, we use two models; diffuse and deterministic models. Then a modified ray tracing algorithm has been used and simulated to predict {{radio coverage}} in tunnels by leaky cable deployment. Simulations show that leaky cables achieve better RF coverage than distributed antennas in term of received signal level versus frequency for various lengths and cross section of tunnels...|$|E
40|$|The new {{radiation}} {{model for}} the electric field scattering of single <b>leaky</b> <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> (LCX) being a transmitting antenna in the rectangular blind zone at 1. 8 [*]GHz is reported. The effect of varying the receiving antenna distance from the LCX on the fluctuation of radiated field using Ray-Tracing Method is examined. The line of sight and reflected paths between the LCX and receiving antenna for both horizontal and vertical polarizations are considered. Furthermore, it is inferred that the selection of appropriate period of slots and distance of the receiver reduce the fluctuations of electric field. The theory and procedures used in this paper can be extrapolated in different slot patterns of the LCX and zones which have many valuable applications for mobile communication in underground mines, tunnels, and railways...|$|E
40|$|Pyramidal neurons of the neocortex {{display a}} wide range of {{synchronous}} EEG rhythms, which arise from electric activity along the apical dendrites of neocortical pyramidal neurons. Here we present a theoretical description of oscillation frequency profiles along apical dendrites which exhibit resonance frequencies in the range of 10 to 100 Hz. The apical dendrite is modeled as a <b>leaky</b> <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> coated with a dielectric, in which a series of compartments act as coupled electric circuits that gradually narrow the resonance profile. The tuning of the peak frequency is assumed to be controlled by the average amplitude of voltage-gated outward currents, which in turn are regulated by the subthreshold noise in the thousands of synaptic spines that are continuously bombarded by local circuits. The results of simulations confirmed the ability of the model both to tune the peak frequency in the 10 - 100 Hz range and to gradually narrow the resonance profile. Considerable additional narrowing of the resonance profile is provided by repeated looping through the apical dendrite via the corticothalamocortical circuit, which reduced the width of each resonance curve (at half-maximum) to approximately 1 Hz. Synaptic noise in the neural circuit is discussed in relation to the ways it can influence the narrowing process...|$|E
40|$|Positioning {{technologies}} are becoming ubiquitous {{and are being}} used more and more frequently for supporting a large variety of applica- tions. For outdoor applications, global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs), such as the global positioning system (GPS), {{are the most common}} and popular choice because of their wide coverage. GPS is also augmented with network-based systems that exploit existing wireless and mobile networks for providing positioning functions where GPS is not available or to save energy in battery-powered devices. Indoors, GNSSs are not a viable solution, but many applications require very accurate, fast, and exible positioning, tracking, and navigation functions. These and other requirements have stim- ulated research activities, in both industry and academia, where a variety of fundamental principles, techniques, and sensors are being integrated to provide positioning functions to many applications. The large majority of positioning technologies is for indoor environments, and most of the existing commercial products have been developed for use in of ce buildings, airports, shopping malls, factory plants, and similar spaces. There are, however, other spaces where positioning, tracking, and navigation systems {{play a central role in}} safety and in rescue operations, as well as in supporting speci c activities or for scienti c research activities in other elds. Among those spaces are underground tunnels, mines, and even underwater wells and caves. This chapter describes the research efforts over the past few years that have been put into the development of positioning systems for underground tun- nels, with particular emphasis in the case of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research), where localiza- tion aims at enabling more automatic and unmanned radiation surveys. Examples of positioning and localization systems that have been devel- oped in the past few years for underground facilities are presented in the fol- lowing section, together with a brief characterization of those spaces’ special conditions and the requirements of some of the most common applications. Section 5. 2 provides a short overview of some of the most representative research efforts that are currently being carried out by many research teams around the world. In addition, some of the fundamental principles and tech- niques are identi ed, such as the use of <b>leaky</b> <b>coaxial</b> <b>cables,</b> as used at the LHC. In Section 5. 3, we introduce the speci c environment of the LHC and de ne the positioning requirements for the envisaged application. This is followed by a detailed description of our approach and the results that have been achieved so far. Some last comments and remarks are presented in a nal section...|$|R

40|$|In {{our daily}} life, {{inadvertent}} scratching {{may increase the}} severity of skin diseases (such as atopic dermatitis, etc.). However, people rarely pay attention to this matter, so the known measurement behavior of the movement is also very little. Nevertheless, the behavior and frequency of scratching represent the degree of itching, and the analysis of scratching frequency is helpful to the doctor's clinical dosage. In this paper, a novel system is proposed to monitor the scratching motion of a sleeping human body at night. The core device of the system are just a <b>Leaky</b> <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> (LCX) and a router. Commonly, LCX {{is used in the}} blind field or semi blind field in wireless communication. The new idea is that the leaky cable is placed on the bed, then the state information of physical layer of wireless communication channels is acquired to identify the scratching motion and other small body movements in the human sleep process. The results show that {{it can be used to}} detect the movement and its duration. Channel state information (CSI) packet is collected by card installed in the computer based on the 802. 11 n protocol.

40|$|Coaxial cable {{structures}} {{form the}} subject of substantial theoretical and experimental investigations either directly related, or which can be extrapolated, to the communications needs and environments of U. S. coal mines. Communication systems based on "guided" waves, of which "leaky" coaxial cables are one implementation, are attractive candidates for providing a range of communication functions primarily along haulage ways, and possible also within sections up to the working face. (However, there are still strong reservations as to whether a practical coaxial cable sys tem could provide sufficient communications coverage within a section.) In this Part, we present the results of some theoretical calculations {{of the performance of}} <b>leaky</b> <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> communication systems. We also analyze the applicability of the theoretical and experimental results obtained by other researchers to the needs of U. S. coal mines. In particular, this investigation has been focused on the utility of relatively low cost, conventional, flexible, coaxial cable at frequencies covering the LF through HF bands and extending into {{the lower part of the}} VHF band, as opposed to relatively high cost, special semi-rigid, coaxial cable* at frequencies in the VHF and UHF bands. There are three major design alternatives for coaxial cable communication systems considered in this chapter: 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Base station feeding a coaxial cable with high surface transfer impedance (holes in outer conductor, e. g., braid construction). 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Base station feeding a coaxial cable with repeaters (U.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a {{theoretical}} model for indoor propagation {{in a straight}} corridor with adjacent rooms is developed and evaluated. One objective is to assess the effect of different conductivities and permittivities in the walls between rooms have on the power levels, in both the corridor and the rooms. Furthermore, {{a model of a}} leaky cable is proposed for which the corresponding propagation characteristics are evaluated and compared to that of a dipole antenna to assess if a leaky cable is a viable alternative for radio coverage in an indoor environment. In order to evaluate the model, a wideband measurement campaign has been conducted at 2. 44 GHz with a 40 meter long <b>leaky</b> <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> and two vertically polarized dipole antennas. The proposed model is based on the waveguide model in 2 D, the mode matching method and cascade coupling of scattering matrices. A section of a corridor is modeled as waveguides with different cross section where one waveguide contains a dielectric medium which models the wall between two rooms. Mode matching is used to determine how the waveguide modes are coupled at the boundaries between the waveguides and the result is collected in a scattering matrix. Multiple corridor sections are then connected together, by cascade coupling the corresponding scattering matrices of each section, into a long corridor with adjacent rooms. Point sources are used to excite the waveguides as an approximation of dipole transmitting antennas. Moreover, the radiating slots in the leaky cable are modeled by multiple point sources that are phase and amplitude shifted in order to achieve the same radiation direction and longitudinal loss as the leaky cable. Finally, the inverse discreet Fourier transform is applied to the wideband electromagnetic field distribution {{in order to determine the}} propagation characteristics in the time domain. The results from the model are in good quantitative agreement with the measurement data, and it is shown that a leaky cable give a more even radio coverage in an office corridor compared to a dipole antenna, especially when the internal walls are highly reflective. Moreover, it is shown that the direct path is dominating for transmission between rooms with transparent walls, like plasterboard, while the main propagation path for highly reflective walls is along the corridor...|$|E
