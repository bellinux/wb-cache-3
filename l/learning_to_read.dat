5|$|Besides {{population}} statistics, Villani {{also offered}} statistics on education. He wrote that {{boys and girls}} <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> numbered 8,000 to 10,000 each year. There were 1,000 to 1,200 children learning to use the abacus and algorism for mathematics. In the four large, prestigious schools of Florence, there were always 550 to 600 students in attendance to learn proper grammar and scholastic logic.|$|E
5|$|In {{his early}} years, Alexander {{was raised by}} a nurse, Lanike, sister of Alexander's future general Cleitus the Black. Later in his childhood, Alexander was tutored by the strict Leonidas, a {{relative}} of his mother, and by Lysimachus of Acarnania. Alexander {{was raised in the}} manner of noble Macedonian youths, <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>read,</b> play the lyre, ride, fight, and hunt.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Patton had {{difficulty}} <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> and write, but eventually overcame this and {{was known in}} his adult life to be an avid reader. He was tutored from home {{until the age of}} eleven, when he was enrolled in Stephen Clark's School for Boys, a private school in Pasadena, for six years. Patton was described as an intelligent boy and was widely read on classical military history, particularly the exploits of Hannibal, Scipio Africanus, Julius Caesar, Joan of Arc, and Napoleon Bonaparte, {{as well as those of}} family friend John Singleton Mosby, who frequently stopped by the Patton family home when George S. Patton was a child. He was also a devoted horseback rider.|$|E
25|$|Some parents {{teach their}} {{children}} <b>to</b> <b>read</b> as babies.

50|$|In 1979, Amos' long-time {{friend and}} {{publicist}} John Rosica {{introduced him to}} Literacy Volunteers of America. Since that time, Amos has advocated literacy and helped thousands of adults <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> In 1987, he also hosted a television series designed to teach others how <b>to</b> <b>read,</b> entitled <b>Learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>Read,</b> produced by Kentucky Educational Television and WXYZ-TV.|$|R
5|$|In Bengkalis, Wahid and Turumun farmed pineapples and coconuts. Wahid {{also taught}} Quran reading, which {{provided}} supplementary {{income for the}} Muslim family. As his father taught at their home, Soeman began <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the Quran at a young age. Meanwhile, from the traders who visited Wahid, he also heard stories of the crimes committed in major cities such as Singapore. In 1913 Soeman enrolled at a local Malay school, where his teachers reinforced the importance of reading. Soeman took this lesson to heart, reading numerous books by European and Malay authors from the school library before he graduated in 1918.|$|E
5|$|The {{consequence}} of this complex orthographic history is that <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> can be challenging in English. It can take longer for school pupils to become independently fluent readers of English than of many other languages, including Italian, Spanish, or German. Nonetheless, there is an advantage for learners of English reading in learning the specific sound-symbol regularities {{that occur in the}} standard English spellings of commonly used words. Such instruction greatly reduces the risk of children experiencing reading difficulties in English. Making primary school teachers more aware of the primacy of morpheme representation in English may help learners learn more efficiently to read and write English.|$|E
5|$|Bembo's italic is {{not based}} {{directly}} {{on the work of}} Griffo, but on the work of calligrapher and handwriting teacher Giovanni Antonio Tagliente (sometimes written Giovannantonio). He published a writing manual, The True Art of Excellent Writing, in Venice in 1524, after the time of Manutius and Griffo, with engravings and some text set in an italic typeface presumably based on his calligraphy. (Tagliente did not only publish on handwriting, but also self-help guides on <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>read,</b> arithmetic, embroidery and a book of model love letters.) It too was imitated in France, with imitations appearing from 1528 onwards. Another influential italic type created around this time was that of Ludovico Vicentino degli Arrighi, also a calligrapher who became involved in printing. His almost upright italic design was also imitated in France and would also become influential to twentieth-century font designs.|$|E
