40|$|Leakage {{power is}} a growing concern in current and future {{microprocessors}}. Functional units of microprocessors are responsible for a major fraction of this power. Therefore, reducing functional unit leakage has received much attention in the recent years. Power gating {{is one of the most}} widely used techniques to minimize leakage energy. Power gating turns off the functional units during the idle periods to reduce the leakage. Therefore, the amount of leakage energy savings is directly proportional to the idle time duration. This paper focuses on increasing the idle interval for the higher SIMD lanes. The applications are profiled dynamically, in a HW/SW co-designed environment, to find the higher SIMD <b>lanes</b> <b>usage</b> pattern. If the higher lanes need to be turned-on for small time periods, the corresponding portion of the code is devectorized to keep the higher lanes off.

40|$|AbstractHigh Occupancy Toll (HOT) lane {{systems have}} been {{proposed}} {{as one of the}} most applicable countermeasures against freeway congestion. Under HOT lane operational scheme, a Single Occupancy Vehicle (SOV) can pay to access HOT lanes in exchange of travel time saving or enhanced trip reliability when excess HOT lane capacity is available. Compared with regular freeway facilities, HOT lane systems demonstrate unique characteristics in facility capacity, driver behavior, travel pattern, demand modeling, and trip reliability. This study aims at conducting a comprehensive performance analysis on two representative HOT lane systems of State Route 167 in Washington and I- 394 MnPass in Minnesota based on the field data collected from traffic sensors and transponder toll tags. Performance measurements are proposed to quantify the quality of service for HOT lane operations. Three critical issues are addressed in this study: 1) the speed-flow relationships in HOT lane systems, 2) quantified system-wide travel time savings and travel time reliability achieved, 3) SOVs tolling incentives. Based on the empirical analysis and evaluation results for the SR 167 and I- 394 MnPass HOT lane systems, operational problems and challenges are also identified. Although the HOT lane system preserves favorable travel reliability, under-utilized HOT lane capacities were observed. The existing tolling strategies may be modified for better SOV allocation for HOT <b>lane</b> <b>usages</b> and further optimize the overall HOT system operations. The research findings greatly advance our understanding on HOT lane system operation mechanisms and are complementary to the freeway facility performance analysis provided by Highway Capacity Manual 2000...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{question}} {{of the number of}} toll lanes to open on the Accra ‚Äì Tema motorway and indeed on various tolling facilities in Ghana to effectively handle arriving traffic and the long queues they generate has been of interest for a while now. Until now this question has, at best been addressed only on ad-hoc basis without any prior scientific analysis. Model prediction of the behaviour of toll lanes under traffic loading is only possible if the performance characteristics of the lane types are known. Traffic flow through the toll lane types of both plazas on the Accra ‚ÄìTema motorway in Ghana was videotaped at peak hours and analyzed to ascertain their performance characteristics. The manual lanes performed with a capacity of 5. 9 veh/min while the E ‚Äì zone lane‚Äôs capacity was established as 8. 6 veh/min. The mean inter-vehicle time per vehicle for the manual lanes was 10 seconds when considering peak 15 min capacity periods with a mean service time and headway of 5 seconds per vehicle respectively, standard deviation of service times within the peak 15 min capacity periods was 3 seconds. The 85 th percentile delay of vehicles in the manual lanes at the Accra toll plaza consistently gave a level of service of F while that at the Tema plaza was found to be at best D. Level of service of the E-zone lanes at both plazas was A due to low patronage. Proportion of toll <b>lane</b> type <b>usage</b> on the motorway was ascertained as 97 % manual lane and 3 % E ‚Äì zone lane. The findings of this research allows for the application of queuing models in decision making in respect of the number of manual and E ‚Äì zone lanes to open...|$|R
40|$|High-Occupancy toll (HOT) lanes allow lower-occupant {{vehicles}} (LOVs) {{to use a}} HOV lane for a fee, {{while maintaining}} free travel to qualifying HOVs. HOT lanes are gaining interest throughout {{the country as a}} strategy for meeting multiple performance objectives in congested urban freeway corridors. Currently there are ten fully operational HOT lanes around the country in seven different states and this research examined the nine of them (excluding I- 35 W). Even with only a handful of operational HOT lane projects, there is great diversity in terms of HOT lane design and operations. With HOT lane implementation there are many issues, including: toll rates, vehicle occupancy requirement, number of access points, and safety. This research examined (i) the different factors which lead {{to the development of the}} HOT lanes in their respective corridors (ii) the objectives of the HOT lanes (iii) changes made in the corridor due to HOT lane implementation (iv) the different impacts of the HOT lanes and (v) the extent to which the objectives of the HOT lanes were achieved. Using three pairs of HOT lanes with similar design and operational characteristics, comparisons were made to examine the impacts of the similar HOT lanes in two different corridors. With the strict registration requirement for HOV 3 + on the I- 95 Express Lanes there were indications that some carpoolers broke up in to lower occupancy vehicles. Tolled access for HOV 2 s on I- 95 as well as the SR 91 Express Lanes resulted in lower usage of the Express Lanes by the HOV 2 s (fewer than 30 percent of the total corridor HOV 2 s) as compared to a conventional HOV lane (60 percent) where HOV 2 access is free. The effect of availability of transit on the HOT lanes can also be seen from SR 91 as compared to I- 95. On SR 91, the Express bus does not use the Express Lanes and there was almost no change in its ridership after the Express Lanes were implemented. However, on I- 95, the Express bus uses the Express Lanes and travel time of buses decreased by 17 minutes due to Express Lanes implementation. The Express bus ridership also increased by 30 percent. On the SR 167 and I- 25 HOT lanes, the exogenous factors like gas prices and economic recession seemed to influence the usage of the HOT lanes. In both the HOT <b>Lanes,</b> carpool <b>usage</b> was positively correlated to the gasoline prices. On I- 25, the increasing unemployment rate coincided with the decreasing toll paying travelers. On SR 167 there were also indications of mode shifts among the transit, carpool and toll paying SOVs due to fluctuating gas prices. With declining gas prices, the transit and carpool usage went down while toll paying users increased. An inverse relationship between the convenience of access points and the safety perceived by the HOT lane users was found. For example, I- 15 Express Lanes in Salt Lake City reduced the access points from unrestricted with the previous HOV lanes to limited with the Express Lanes. As a result, more predictable merging led to an increase in the perceived safety of the Express lanes as well as the speed of the corridor. On the other hand, some carpoolers mentioned not using the Express Lanes anymore because of access inconvenience. The access inconvenience was also mentioned by previous carpoolers in HOV lanes on I- 95 as one of the reasons for not using the Express Lanes. These findings underscore the importance of outreach programs during the planning process of the HOT lanes to minimize the confusion among the previous users of the HOV lanes and spreading awareness among them regarding the increased safety benefits...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, high occupancy/toll (HOT) lanes {{have gained}} {{increasing}} {{recognition as a}} potential method of managing traffic congestion. HOT lanes combine pricing and vehicle occupancy restrictions to optimize the demand for high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes. Besides having all the advantages of traditional HOV lanes, HOT lanes can also generate revenue to help finance various operation and maintenance programs. At present there are four fairly well established HOT lane projects in the United States: two in Houston, Texas, and one each in San Diego, and Riverside County, California. After 6 years in operation, Houston's HOT lanes receive comparatively lower patronage than the two California projects. An understanding of why people choose to use HOT lanes will be vital to improving the performance of existing HOT facilities and will also shed light on policy decisions regarding future HOT lane investments. This study examined {{the relative importance of}} different parameters which could be expected to influence the demand for HOT lanes using standard statistical and discrete choice modeling techniques on survey data from Houston's HOT lane users. The study showed that, controlling for other variables, trip length, the driver's perception of travel time savings offered by the HOT lanes, frequency of travel in the freeway corridor, trip purpose, and {{the amount of time spent}} on carpool formation were good predictors of HOT <b>lane</b> <b>usage.</b> Socioeconomic characteristics such as age and level of education were also good indicators of the frequency of HOT <b>lane</b> <b>usage</b> whereas household size, occupation, and hourly wage rate were not.
