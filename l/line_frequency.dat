25|$|The {{simplest}} {{way to control}} the harmonic current {{is to use a}} filter that passes current only at <b>line</b> <b>frequency</b> (50 or 60Hz). The filter consists of capacitors or inductors, and makes a non-linear device look more like a linear load. An example of passive PFC is a valley-fill circuit.|$|E
25|$|Most lines {{operate with}} trains running at {{intervals}} of every 5 minutes during peak hours, {{but due to}} lines overlapping, a suitable train for a journey can be as frequent as every 2 minutes. Outside of peak times lines operate trains at frequencies of every 10 minutes; however, around the start of operations and after midnight the <b>line</b> <b>frequency</b> decreases to every 20 minutes or more on most lines. Again with line overlap this means that a suitable train will arrive (often much) more frequently.|$|E

25|$|Currents induced {{into this}} winding provide the rotor {{magnetic}} field. The {{shape of the}} rotor bars determines the speed-torque characteristics. At low speeds, the current induced in the squirrel cage is nearly at <b>line</b> <b>frequency</b> and tends {{to be in the}} outer parts of the rotor cage. As the motor accelerates, the slip frequency becomes lower, and more current is in the interior of the winding. By shaping the bars to change the resistance of the winding portions in the interior and outer parts of the cage, effectively a variable resistance is inserted in the rotor circuit. However, the majority of such motors have uniform bars.|$|E
25|$|The semi-resonant start circuit {{was invented}} by Thorn Lighting for use with T12 {{fluorescent}} tubes. This method uses a double wound transformer and a capacitor. With no arc current, the transformer and capacitor resonate at <b>line</b> <b>frequency</b> and generate about twice the supply voltage across the tube, and a small electrode heating current. This tube voltage is too low to strike the arc with cold electrodes, but as the electrodes heat up to thermionic emission temperature, the tube striking voltage falls below that of the ringing voltage, and the arc strikes. As the electrodes heat, the lamp slowly, over three to five seconds, reaches full brightness. As the arc current increases and tube voltage drops, the circuit provides current limiting.|$|E

A cycloconverter operates as a three-phase current source via three anti-parallel-connected SCR-bridges in six-pulse configuration, each cycloconverter phase acting selectively to convert fixed <b>line</b> <b>frequency</b> AC voltage to an alternating voltage at a variable load frequency. MC drives are IGBT-based.|$|E

2500|$|Static {{spark gap}} - This {{is the most}} common type, which was {{described}} in detail in the previous section. It is used in most entertainment coils.

The high output frequency of an electronic ballast refreshes the phosphors in a fluorescent lamp so rapidly that there is no perceptible flicker. The flicker index, used for measuring perceptible light modulation, has a range from 0.00 to 1.00, with 0 indicating the lowest possibility of flickering and 1 indicating the highest. Lamps operated on magnetic ballasts have a flicker index between 0.04–0.07 while digital ballasts have a flicker index of below 0.01.|$|E
2500|$|Rotary {{spark gap}} - These use a spark gap {{consisting}} of electrodes around {{the periphery of}} a wheel rotated at high speed by a motor, which create sparks when they pass by a stationary electrode. Tesla used this type on his big coils, and they are used today on large entertainment coils. The rapid separation speed of the electrodes quenches the spark quickly, allowing [...] "first notch" [...] quenching, making possible higher voltages. The wheel is usually driven by a synchronous motor, so the sparks are synchronized with the AC <b>line</b> <b>frequency,</b> the spark occurring {{at the same point}} on the AC waveform on each cycle, so the primary pulses are repeatable.|$|E
2500|$|Fluorescent lamps using a {{magnetic}} power <b>line</b> <b>frequency</b> ballast {{do not give}} out a steady light; instead, they flicker at twice the supply frequency. This results in fluctuations not only with light output but color temperature as well, which may pose problems for photography {{and people who are}} sensitive to the flicker. Even among persons not sensitive to light flicker, a stroboscopic effect can be noticed, where something spinning at just the right speed may appear stationary if illuminated solely by a single fluorescent lamp. This effect is eliminated by paired lamps operating on a lead-lag ballast. Unlike a true strobe lamp, the light level drops in appreciable time and so substantial [...] "blurring" [...] of the moving part would be evident.|$|E

2500|$|The {{effect can}} be {{significant}} when switching large currents very quickly. A certain amount of [...] "reverse recovery time" [...] tr (on the order of tens of nanoseconds to a few microseconds) {{may be required to}} remove the reverse recovery charge Qr from the diode. During this recovery time, the diode can actually conduct in the reverse direction. This might give rise to a large constant current in the reverse direction for a short time while the diode is reverse biased. The magnitude of such a reverse current is determined by the operating circuit (i.e., the series resistance) and the diode is said to be in the storage-phase. [...] In certain real-world cases {{it is important to consider}} the losses that are incurred by this non-ideal diode effect. However, when the slew rate of the current is not so severe (e.g. <b>Line</b> <b>frequency)</b> the {{effect can be}} safely ignored. For most applications, the effect is also negligible for Schottky diodes.|$|E

This connection can also be genlocked to an external video signal. The system was bundled with an RF adapter to provide output on televisions with a coaxial RF input, while monochrome composite video is available via an RCA connector (also coaxial). There is also a Zorro II bus expansion on the left side (behind a plastic cover). Peripherals such as a hard disk drive can be added via the expansion slot and are configured automatically by the Amiga's AutoConfig standard, so that multiple devices do not conflict with each other. Up to [...] of “fast RAM" [...] can be added using the side expansion slot.|$|E
5000|$|The 59.94 rate {{is derived}} from the {{following}} calculations. Designers chose to make the chrominance subcarrier frequency an n + 0.5 multiple of the <b>line</b> <b>frequency</b> to minimize interference between the luminance signal and the chrominance signal. (Another way this is often stated is that the color subcarrier frequency is an odd multiple of half the <b>line</b> <b>frequency.)</b> They then chose to make the audio subcarrier frequency an integer multiple of the <b>line</b> <b>frequency</b> to minimize visible (intermodulation) interference between the audio signal and the chrominance signal. The original black-and-white standard, with its 15,750 Hz <b>line</b> <b>frequency</b> and 4.5 MHz audio subcarrier, does not meet these requirements, so designers had either to raise the audio subcarrier frequency or lower the <b>line</b> <b>frequency.</b> Raising the audio subcarrier frequency would prevent existing (black and white) receivers from properly tuning in the audio signal. Lowering the <b>line</b> <b>frequency</b> is comparatively innocuous, because the horizontal and vertical synchronization information in the NTSC signal allows a receiver to tolerate a substantial amount of variation in the <b>line</b> <b>frequency.</b> So the engineers chose the <b>line</b> <b>frequency</b> to be changed for the color standard. In the black-and-white standard, the ratio of audio subcarrier frequency to <b>line</b> <b>frequency</b> is [...] 285.71. In the color standard, this becomes rounded to the integer 286, which means the color standard's line rate is [...] &asymp; 15,734 Hz. Maintaining the same number of scan lines per field (and frame), the lower line rate must yield a lower field rate. Dividing [...] lines by 262.5 lines per field gives approximately 59.94 fields per second.|$|E
