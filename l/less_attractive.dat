5|$|Monday, 16 August 1819, {{was a hot}} summer's day, with a {{cloudless}} blue sky. The fine weather {{almost certainly}} increased {{the size of the}} crowd significantly; marching from the outer townships in the cold and rain would have been a much <b>less</b> <b>attractive</b> prospect.|$|E
5|$|The {{cohabitation}} {{lifestyle is}} becoming more popular in today's generation. It is more convenient for couples not to get married {{because it can be}} cheaper and simpler. As divorce rates rise in society, the desire to get married is <b>less</b> <b>attractive</b> for couples uncertain of their long-term plans.|$|E
5|$|Shorter and quicker {{routes to}} the top of Helvellyn, though with <b>less</b> <b>attractive</b> scenery, begin from several points along the A591 road along {{the west side of the}} mountain. Two of these may be {{combined}} to create a circular walk. Incorporating the south ridge in the route can restore much of the scenic interest.|$|E
5000|$|Resting on the {{principle}} of mate value again, is the prediction that men will devote more resources to mate retention when their partner is perceived to be physically attractive, than when their partner is perceived to be <b>less</b> physically <b>attractive.</b> Females who are physically attractive have a higher mate value than those who are <b>less</b> physically <b>attractive.</b>|$|R

5|$|With Irvine, Nomura {{tried to}} strike a balance between not overshadowing Squall and not {{becoming}} too unattractive. He gave Irvine a handsome appearance, but a casual personality, hoping that this would make him <b>less</b> <b>attractive</b> than Squall. Keeping with this idea, Nomura gave him goggles; however, this idea was abandoned in favor of an American cowboy-like appearance to set him apart from other goggle-wearing characters in the Final Fantasy series.|$|E
5|$|By the 1920s, {{the number}} of {{municipalities}} in Bergen County had reached 70, where it still stands. After the 1920s, the legislature did not create many new municipalities, but local officials used zoning to affect land use, making annexation <b>less</b> <b>attractive.</b> Because of boroughitis, the township {{as a form of}} government all but disappeared from Bergen County. One that remains is South Hackensack, the remnants of Lodi Township that no seceding borough wanted. Its three pieces are separated from each other by several miles.|$|E
5|$|SCI {{can lead}} to {{significant}} insecurities, which have repercussions for sexuality and self-image. SCI often affects body image, either due to the host {{of changes in the}} body that affect appearance (e.g. unused muscles in the legs become atrophied), or due to changes in self-perception not directly from physical changes. People frequently find themselves <b>less</b> <b>attractive</b> and expect others not to be attracted to them after SCI. These insecurities cause fear of rejection and deter people from initiating contact or sexual activity or engaging in sex. Feelings of undesirability or worthlessness even lead some to suggest to their partners that they find someone able bodied.|$|E
5000|$|The {{scores of}} those {{physically}} attractive {{are higher than}} <b>less</b> physically <b>attractive</b> people on measures of affect and mood.|$|R

5|$|Selfe's {{contempt}} for the liberal arts tradition and the priority he accorded practical skill have certain implications which cannot be commended. These reflected and augmented... one of the <b>less</b> <b>attractive</b> features of the Australian ethos– indifference to higher learning and advanced attainments, an indifference shading into contempt and suspicion... Selfe may have lost a battle but before long, the liberal arts tradition faced still greater defeats. To these, Selfe certainly contributed, and what must be recognised {{is that in the}} vehemence of the struggle, and in the lauding of efficiency over culture, much that was valuable in the liberal arts tradition was lost.|$|E
5|$|Some {{residents}} of Glenwood Springs have argued instead that CDOT should instead build a bypass that avoids downtown completely, {{as it did}} in Basalt. They contend that a replacement bridge would add even more traffic to Grand and make downtown <b>less</b> <b>attractive</b> to those who would like to shop there rather than just pass through on the way to destinations up the valley. The bypass, they claim, is more in keeping with the wishes of residents and would cost less. They have lobbied Glenwood Springs' city council to be more active in pressuring CDOT to reconsider the bypass.|$|E
5|$|Leeman Bennett, {{the former}} {{head coach of the}} Atlanta Falcons and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, served as {{chairman}} of the selection committee, which had the task of picking the best teams from those made available by the selection criteria set by the two conferences. The committee would have approximately onemonth to select the twoteams that would attract the most people to the game and generate the largest possible television audience. This fact helped eliminate ACC runner-up Georgia Tech from the selection process, as the Yellow Jackets had already played Georgia earlier in the season, thus making a potential Georgia-Georgia Tech showdown <b>less</b> <b>attractive.</b> In addition, that matchup, while attractive to football fans in the Atlanta area (the site of the Chick-fil-A Bowl and home to Georgia Tech), would have less appeal to television viewers outside the Georgia area. Supervising the selection committee was the Chick-fil-A Bowl Executive Committee, which consisted of representatives from various Atlanta businesses and the Chick-fil-A corporation.|$|E
5000|$|In the book, Steerpike is {{described}} as being <b>less</b> physically <b>attractive,</b> with close-set red eyes and greasy hair, which {{he does not have}} in the series.|$|R

5|$|Scotland {{have played}} five full {{international}} matches at Easter Road. These have been friendly matches against <b>less</b> <b>attractive</b> opposition where {{a relatively small}} crowd was expected, and it has therefore been unnecessary to play the match at Hampden Park. The Scotland under-21 team has also sometimes played matches at Easter Road, such as when Scotland played Iceland in the 2011 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship qualification play-offs. The most recent full international played at the stadium was a friendly match between Scotland and Qatar in June 2015. One full international was played at Easter Road that did not involve Scotland, a friendly match between South Korea and Ghana that was played {{in advance of the}} 2006 World Cup.|$|E
5|$|The Liberian open registry, {{founded in}} 1948, was {{the brainchild of}} Edward Stettinius, who had been Franklin D. Roosevelt's Secretary of State during World War II. Stettinius created a {{corporate}} structure that included The Liberia Corporation, a joint-venture with the government of Liberia. The corporation was structured so that one-fourth of its revenue would go to the Liberian government, another 10% went to fund social programs in Liberia, and the remainder returned to Stettinius' corporation. The Liberian registry was created at a time when Panama's registry was becoming <b>less</b> <b>attractive</b> for several reasons including its unpopularity with the U.S. labor movement and European shipping concerns, political unrest in Panama, and increases in its fees and regulations.|$|E
5|$|The line {{operated}} successfully and settlements of people {{attracted to the}} area {{by the prospect of}} employment in the mines grew around the Brendon ridge. However changes in the availability of imported ore made the mines a <b>less</b> <b>attractive</b> proposition and by 1883 the mines were closed and mineral traffic on the railway ceased. In 1879 the railway announced that the wages of all staff would be reduced. The passenger service continued until 7 November 1898; a brief resumption took place from 1907 (but not west of Brendon Hill) until final closure to passengers in 1910. The 1895 Bradshaw Railway Guide shows two return trips every day, at 09:15 and 15:10 from Watchet, calling at Washford, Roadwater and Comberow, taking 30 minutes; return trains were at 10:45 and 16:15, also taking 30 minutes.|$|E
50|$|Initially all the Bass, Mitchells and Butler's (BMB) and Charrington's hotels were {{transferred}} into the Crest Hotels portfolio and by 1970 new, purpose-built hotels were under construction. As new properties opened, a programme of disposals of the older, <b>less</b> economically <b>attractive</b> hotels was initiated.|$|R
50|$|However, {{research}} {{also notes that}} physical attractiveness is the key detail when analyzing consumer behavior. If a celebrity is <b>less</b> than <b>attractive</b> according to society's standards, the advertising campaign may potentially be less effective. Still, advertisements starring celebrities are generally effective due to their popularity and presence in media.|$|R
25|$|Thus, - {{according}} to Zaehner - while {{the direction that}} the Sassanids took was not altogether {{at odds with the}} spirit of the Gathas, the extreme dualism that accompanied a divinity that was remote and inaccessible made the faith <b>less</b> than <b>attractive.</b> Zurvanism was then truly heretical only {{in the sense that it}} weakened the appeal of Zoroastrianism.|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} version was only moderately successful, {{although it is}} remembered for the first publication of Sturgeon's Law. The publisher, Joseph Ferman (father of Edward Ferman), declared that he wanted well-told stories of action and adventure; the resulting fiction contained more sex and violence than was usual for the science fiction (sf) genre in the late 1950s, and sf historian Mike Ashley {{has suggested that the}} magazine was ahead of its time. It succumbed to poor sales within less than two years. The second US version was no more successful, with <b>less</b> <b>attractive</b> cover art and {{little in the way of}} notable fiction, though it did publish Vonda McIntyre's first story. By the end of 1970, Venture had ceased publication permanently.|$|E
5|$|Three {{publishers}} praised The Well {{but turned}} it down. Hall's agent then sent the manuscript to Jonathan Cape who, though cautious about publishing a controversial book, saw {{the potential for}} a commercial success. Cape tested the waters with a small print run of 1500 copies, priced at 15 shillings– about twice the cost of an average novel– to make it <b>less</b> <b>attractive</b> to sensation-seekers. Publication, originally scheduled for late 1928, was brought forward when he discovered that another novel with a lesbian theme, Compton Mackenzie's Extraordinary Women, was to be published in September. Though the two books proved to have little in common, Hall and Cape saw Extraordinary Women as a competitor and wanted to beat it to market. The Well appeared on 27 July, in a black cover with a plain jacket. Cape sent review copies only to newspapers and magazines he thought would handle the subject matter non-sensationally.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the balance}} of {{payments}} sums to zero, a current account surplus indicates a deficit in the asset accounts and vice versa. A current account surplus or deficit indicates {{the extent to which}} a country is relying on foreign capital to finance its consumption and investments, and whether it is living beyond its means. For example, assuming a capital account balance of zero (thus no asset transfers available for financing), a current account deficit of £1 billion implies a financial account surplus (or net asset exports) of £1 billion. A net exporter of financial assets is known as a borrower, exchanging future payments for current consumption. Further, a net export of financial assets indicates growth in a country's debt. From this perspective, {{the balance of}} payments links a nation's income to its spending by indicating the degree to which current account imbalances are financed with domestic or foreign financial capital, which illuminates how a nation's wealth is shaped over time. A healthy balance of payments position is important for economic growth. If countries experiencing a growth in demand have trouble sustaining a healthy balance of payments, demand can slow, leading to: unused or excess supply, discouraged foreign investment, and <b>less</b> <b>attractive</b> exports which can further reinforce a negative cycle that intensifies payments imbalances.|$|E
50|$|These girls show very {{different}} behaviors {{according to the}} education they received or provided themselves: the two eldest daughters, Jane and Elizabeth, show irreproachable conduct and are appreciated by their father, while Mary, <b>less</b> physically <b>attractive,</b> displays intellectual and musical pretensions, and the two youngest are both left almost abandoned to run wild under the sloppy, careless supervision of their ineffectual mother.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Site M" [...] {{power plant}} would have burned high-sulfur Illinois coal. Due {{to the passage}} of the federal Clean Air Act, the use of Illinois coal for {{electrical}} power purposes became <b>less</b> economically <b>attractive</b> to Commonwealth Edison in the 1980s and 1990s. After holding the land in 1974-1993, the utility agreed to sell it to the state of Illinois.|$|R
50|$|Due to how {{widespread}} and extremely common {{they are in}} the wild, water snakes are often found in the exotic pet trade, throughout the United States, though they are rarely captive bred. Their relative physical unattractiveness, compared to other available pet snake species, and their poor disposition make them <b>less</b> than <b>attractive</b> pets. They are easy to care for though, and do quite well in captivity.|$|R
5|$|For {{those who}} are single when injured or who become single, SCI causes {{difficulties}} and insecurities with respect to one's ability to meet new partners and start relationships. In some settings, beauty standards cause people to view disabled bodies as <b>less</b> <b>attractive,</b> limiting the options for sexual and romantic partners {{of people with disabilities}} like SCI. Furthermore, physical disabilities are stigmatized, causing people to avoid contact with disabled people, particularly those with highly visible conditions like SCI. The stigma may cause people with SCI to experience self-consciousness and embarrassment in public. They can increase their social success by using impression management techniques to change how they are perceived and create a more positive image of themselves in others' eyes. Physical limitations create difficulties; with lowered independence comes reduced social interaction and fewer opportunities to find partners. Difficulties with mobility and the lack of disabled accessibility of social spaces (e.g. lack of wheelchair ramps) create a further barrier to social activity and limit the ability to meet partners. Isolation and its associated risk of depression can be limited by participating in physical activities, social gatherings, clubs, and online chat and dating.|$|E
5|$|The four tenders {{resulting}} from the study were submitted during October and November 1986. Although the IKL/HDW design was rated highest during the initial inspection, the evaluation team found that the German proposal was <b>less</b> <b>attractive</b> than previously thought. Although IKL/HDW claimed that their boat could meet the RAN's performance requirements, the evaluators concluded from the information provided that doing so would require the deactivation of all non-essential and some essential systems. Conversely, Kockums' proposal conceded {{that they did not}} meet the requirements, although evaluators found that the figures failed by only narrow margins, and believed that these were conservative. The evaluation team recalculated the capability statistics for both submarines to a common baseline, portraying the predicted Australian operating conditions, which generally saw Kockums' figures revised upwards, and those from IKL/HDW downwards. This resulted in growing support for the Type471 bid, and outcries from the IKL and HDW groups, who questioned the validity of the recalculations and if the Australian evaluators had the experience to do this correctly.|$|E
25|$|The {{strong point}} of the theory rests with her name: it does not rely on someone {{changing}} their name in some awkward fashion to {{assume the role of}} Neferneferuaten. She is a <b>less</b> <b>attractive</b> candidate now that the Year 16 graffito for Queen Nefertiti has been verified.|$|E
40|$|Paying sitting {{allowances}} {{will make}} {{the position of a}} legislator <b>less</b> financially <b>attractive</b> to those who see politics only as a means of personal enrichment and not service to the public. Furthermore, by paying only sitting allowances, only those with genuine interest in serving the nation such as retired judges, civil servants, professors and other retired professionals will be attracted into the legislative house”...|$|R
50|$|The {{government}} sued Westinghouse {{for alleged}} overpricing and bribery but was ultimately rejected by a United States court. Debt repayment {{on the plant}} became the country's biggest single obligation. While successive governments have looked at several proposals to convert the plant into an oil, coal, or gas-fired power station, these options have all been deemed <b>less</b> economically <b>attractive</b> {{in the long term}} than simply constructing new power stations.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, {{she meets}} Hans, an auto {{mechanic}} who, also image-conscious and aspiring to be trendy, {{is living in}} relative poverty and is considered <b>less</b> physically <b>attractive</b> than Lord. Although initially mesmerized by the glamour of West Berlin and Lord, she {{falls in love with}} Hans, deciding that looks and image are not important. She eventually returns home to her parents along with Hans, who finds a job in the Eastern side of the city.|$|R
