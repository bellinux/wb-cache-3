The development of intraoperative guidance systems for identifying all sites {{of disease and}} improving the likelihood of complete surgical resection {{is an area of}} active ongoing research, as this can lead to a decrease in the need of subsequent additional surgical procedures. We develop a wearable goggle navigation system for dual-mode optical and ultrasound imaging of suspicious lesions. The system consists of a <b>light</b> <b>source</b> <b>module,</b> a monochromatic CCD camera, an ultrasound system, a Google Glass, and a host computer. It is tested in tissue-simulating phantoms and an ex vivo human breast tissue model. Our experiments demonstrate that the surgical navigation system provides useful guidance for localization and core needle biopsy of simulated tumor within the tissue-simulating phantom, as well as a core needle biopsy and subsequent excision of Indocyanine Green (ICG) -fluorescing sentinel lymph nodes. Our experiments support the contention that this wearable goggle navigation system can be potentially very useful and fully integrated by the surgeon for optimizing many aspects of oncologic surgery. Further engineering optimization and additional in vivo clinical validation work is necessary before such a surgical navigation system can be fully realized in the everyday clinical setting...|$|E

Portable VIS/NIR instruments are particularly versatile and suitable for field use to monitor the ripening process or quality parameters. The aim of this work is to develop and evaluate a new simplified optoelectronic system for potential measurements on fruit and vegetables directly in the field. The development, characterization and validation of an operative prototype is discussed. LED technology was chosen for the design, and spectral acquisition at four specific wavelengths (630, 690, 750 and 850 nm) was proposed. Nevertheless, attention was given to the modularity and versatility of the system. Indeed, the possibility to change the <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> <b>module</b> with other wavelengths allows one to adapt the use of the same device for different foreseeable applications and objectives, e. g., ripeness evaluation, detection of particular diseases and disorders, chemical and physical property prediction, shelf life analysis, as well as for different natures of products (berry, leaf or liquid).

Our final system can perform iris recognition with 66 frames per second on a smart glasses platform with 100 % accuracy.

Since the effect by directional <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> and ambient <b>light</b> is eliminated by differencing, the key advantage of considering the difference sphere is that it enables us to estimate near point <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> including their radiance, which {{has been difficult to}} achieve in previ-ous efforts where only distant directional <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> were assumed.
