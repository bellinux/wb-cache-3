2500|$|Botulinum {{inhibits}} {{the release}} within {{the nervous system}} of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter, responsible for communication between motor neurons and muscle cells. [...] All forms of botulism <b>lead</b> to <b>paralysis</b> that typically starts with {{the muscles of the}} face and then spreads towards the limbs. In severe forms, botulism <b>leads</b> to <b>paralysis</b> of the breathing muscles and causes respiratory failure. In light of this life-threatening complication, all suspected cases of botulism are treated as medical emergencies, and public health officials are usually involved to identify the source and take steps to prevent further cases from occurring.|$|R

40|$|Echoviruses {{have been}} implicated in {{multiple}} human disease syndromes, including aseptic meningitis, paralysis, and heart disease, but no animal model is available for studying the pathogenesis of infection. Production of human integrin very late antigen 2, a receptor for echovirus type 1, in transgenic mice conferred susceptibility to viral infection. Intracerebral inoculation of newborn transgenic mice with echovirus <b>leads</b> to <b>paralysis</b> and wasting. No disease was observed in infected nontransgenic mice. In paralyzed mice significant damage was observed in the outer layers of the cerebrum, and numerous condensed neuronal nuclei were present. In contrast, intracerebral inoculation of adolescent (3 - to 4 -week-old) transgenic mice with echovirus type 1 did not <b>lead</b> to <b>paralysis</b> but an acute wasting phenotype and myocarditis. These findings establish human very late antigen 2 transgenic mice {{as a model for}} echovirus pathogenesis...|$|R
25|$|Fear is {{affected}} by cultural and historical context. For example, in the early 20th century, many Americans feared polio, a disease that can <b>lead</b> to <b>paralysis.</b> There are consistent cross-cultural differences in how people respond to fear. Display rules affect how likely people are to show the facial expression of fear and other emotions.|$|R
50|$|In a C. elegans {{behavioral}} assay, {{analyzing the}} time course of paralysis provides {{information about the}} neuromuscular junction. Levamisole acts as an acetylcholine receptor agonist, which leads to muscle contraction. Continuing activation <b>leads</b> to <b>paralysis.</b> The time course of paralysis provides information about the acetylcholine receptors on the muscle. For example, mutants with fewer acetylcholine receptors may paralyze slower than wild type.|$|R

50|$|Of {{surgical}} importance are two {{branches of}} the facial nerve that also pass through the middle ear space. These are the horizontal portion {{of the facial nerve}} and the chorda tympani. Damage to the horizontal branch during ear surgery can <b>lead</b> to <b>paralysis</b> of the face (same side of the face as the ear). The chorda tympani is the branch of the facial nerve that carries taste from the ipsilateral half (same side) of the tongue.|$|R
50|$|Paralysis occurs {{often in}} bearded dragons {{when they are}} fed food that is too big for them. Bearded dragons will try to eat worms or crickets that are too big for them, but this can be {{extremely}} harmful. Food should not be bigger than the space between their eyes. If a dragon eats food that is too big for them, there will be pressure put on their spinal cord during digestion. This pressure can <b>lead</b> to <b>paralysis</b> or death.|$|R

5000|$|... • SKELETAL - Symptoms of lymphangiomatosis in the {{skeletal}} system {{are the same}} as those of Gorham’s disease. Frequently asymptomatic, skeletal lymphangiomatosis may be discovered incidentally or when a pathological fracture occurs. Patients may experience pain of varying severity in areas around the effected bone. When the disease occurs in the bones of the spine, neurological symptoms such as numbness and tingling may occur due to spinal nerve compression. Progression of disease in the spine may <b>lead</b> to <b>paralysis.</b> Lymphangiomatosis in conjunction with Chiari I malformation also has been reported.|$|R
30|$|Is there a {{dark side}} to Big Data? Haakonsson, citing his own {{experience}} in executive roles, suggests that it can <b>lead</b> to decision <b>paralysis,</b> or at least decision delay. Slower decision making occurs because leaders are overwhelmed. And the allure of data encourages them to wait while more information is obtained.|$|R
40|$|Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) is an adult-onset {{neurodegenerative disease}} {{characterized by the}} selective death of upper and lower motor neurons which ultimately <b>leads</b> to <b>paralysis</b> and ultimately death. Pathological changes in ALS are closely associated with pronounced and progressive changes in mitochondrial morphology, bioenergetics and calcium homeostasis. Converging evidence suggests that impaired mitochondrial function could be pivotal in the rapid neurodegeneration of this condition. In this review, we provide an update of recent advances in understanding mitochondrial biology in the pathogenesis of ALS and highlight the therapeutic value of pharmacologically targeting mitochondrial biology to slow disease progression.

50|$|Gambierol {{has a high}} {{affinity}} for especially K1.1-1.5 channels and the K3.1 channel. K1.1-1.5 channels are responsible for repolarization of the membrane potential. The K1.3 channel however, has additional functions by regulating the Ca2+ signaling for T cells. If they are blocked, the T cells {{at the site of}} inflammation paralyse and are not reactivated. K3.1 channels are responsible for the high frequency firing of action potentials. If the K channels are closed, the depolarized membrane cannot repolarize to its resting state, causing a permanent action potential. This <b>leads</b> to <b>paralysis</b> of, for example, the respiratory system and therefore suffocation of the organism.|$|R

50|$|Many Rhipicephalus are of economic, medical, and {{veterinary}} importance {{because they}} are vectors of pathogens. They transmit the pathogens that cause the animal and human diseases East Coast fever, anaplasmosis, babesiosis, rickettsiosis, Boutonneuse fever, Lyme disease, Q fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, and they inject a neurotoxin in their bite that <b>leads</b> to tick-caused <b>paralysis.</b>|$|R
50|$|Politically, a {{constitutional}} crisis can <b>lead</b> to administrative <b>paralysis</b> and eventual {{collapse of the}} government, the loss of political legitimacy, or to civil war.

40|$|Injury to {{mammalian}} motor nerves can <b>lead</b> to <b>paralysis,</b> {{but relatively}} successful regeneration may occur when conditions are favorable. Elucidation of the mechanism upholding successful regeneration is of theoretical and clinical interest. In this study, {{the hypothesis that}} insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) can stimulate motor nerve regeneration was tested. When IGF-II was infused continuously near a site of crush on the sciatic nerve, the distance of motor axon regeneration was increased significantly in rats. In contrast, spontaneous regeneration was inhibited when an anti-IGF-II antiserum was infused through a "window" in the epineurium. Thus, infused IGF-II can increase, and endogenous IGFs can support, the regeneration of motor axons in lesioned nerves...|$|R
5|$|Approximately 19 {{percent of}} all paralytic polio cases have both bulbar and spinal symptoms; this subtype is called {{respiratory}} or bulbospinal polio. Here, the virus affects {{the upper part of}} the cervical spinal cord (cervical vertebrae C3 through C5), and paralysis of the diaphragm occurs. The critical nerves affected are the phrenic nerve (which drives the diaphragm to inflate the lungs) and those that drive the muscles needed for swallowing. By destroying these nerves, this form of polio affects breathing, making it difficult or impossible for the patient to breathe without the support of a ventilator. It can <b>lead</b> to <b>paralysis</b> of the arms and legs and may also affect swallowing and heart functions.|$|R
30|$|SREs can be {{debilitating}} {{and patients}} frequently experience {{a reduction in}} quality of life, with significant decreases in physical and functional well-being (Weinfurt et al. 2004). SREs are associated with considerable morbidity, the worst being spinal cord compression, which can <b>lead</b> to <b>paralysis,</b> and pathologic fractures, which may result in disability or the need for surgery, {{with the potential for}} additional perioperative morbidity (Coleman 2006; Katzer et al. 2002). As might be expected, SREs often result in considerable pain, which further impairs patient mobility and reduces quality of life (Katzer et al. 2002; DePuy et al. 2007; Costa et al. 2008). SREs are also associated with an increased risk of death (Norgaard et al. 2010; Saad et al. 2007).|$|R
50|$|Foodborne {{botulism}} {{results from}} contaminated foodstuffs in which C. botulinum spores {{have been allowed}} to germinate and produce botulism toxin, and this typically occurs in canned non-acidic food substances. C. botulinum prefers low oxygen environments, and can therefore grow in canned foods. Botulism is a rare but serious paralytic illness, leading to paralysis that typically starts with the muscles of the face and then spreads towards the limbs. In severe forms, it <b>leads</b> to <b>paralysis</b> of the breathing muscles and causes respiratory failure. In view of this life-threatening complication, all suspected cases of botulism are treated as medical emergencies, and public health officials are usually involved to prevent further cases from the same source.|$|R

40|$|Poliovirus (PV) is {{the causal}} agent of paralytic poliomyelitis, an acute {{disease of the}} central nervous system (CNS) {{resulting}} in flaccid paralysis. The development of new animal and cell models has allowed the key steps of the pathogenesis of poliomyelitis to be investigated at the molecular level. In particular, {{it has been shown that}} PV-induced apoptosis is an important component of the tissue injury in the CNS of infected mice, which <b>leads</b> to <b>paralysis.</b> In this review the molecular biology of PV and the pathogenesis of poliomyelitis are briefly described, and then several models of PV-induced apoptosis are considered; the role of the cellular receptor of PV, CD 155, in the modulation of apoptosis is also addressed...|$|R
50|$|The {{voltage-gated}} {{sodium channel}} {{is essential for}} normal neuronal functioning. It exists as integral membrane proteins interspersed along the axon of a neuron and possessing four domains that span the cell membrane. Opening of the voltage-gated sodium channel occurs {{when there is a}} change in voltage or some ligand binds in the right way. It is of foremost importance for these sodium channels to function properly, as they are essential for the propagation of an action potential. Without this ability, the nerve cell becomes unable to transmit signals and the region of the body that it innervates is cut off from the nervous system. This may <b>lead</b> to <b>paralysis</b> of the affected region, {{as in the case of}} saxitoxin.|$|R
