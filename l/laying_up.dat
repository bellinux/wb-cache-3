25|$|There {{were about}} 4,000 Central Alaskan Yupik and Siberian Yupik living in several villages {{on the island}} in the mid-19th century. They subsisted by hunting walrus and whale and by fishing. A famine in 1878–1880 caused many to starve and many others to leave, decimating the island's population.

25|$|The first {{building}} on {{this site was}} a Roman bath, followed by a sixth-century (the dating was based on precise coin finds in stratigraphic excavation) hall church with an apse <b>laying</b> <b>up</b> against the Aqueduct of Valens. Later – possibly {{in the seventh century}} – a much larger church was built to the south of the first church. A third church, which reused the sanctuary and the apse (later destroyed by the Ottomans) of the second one, can be dated {{to the end of the}} twelfth century, during the late Comnenian period. It may date to between 1197 and 1204, since Constantine Stilbes alluded to its destruction in a fire in 1197. The church was surrounded by monastery buildings, which disappeared totally during the Ottoman period. After the Latin conquest of Constantinople, the building was used by the Crusaders as a Roman Catholic church, and partly officiated by Franciscan clergy.|$|E

25|$|Critical historians treated this legend as an idle tale {{and denied}} the historicity of King Gundaphorus until modern {{archeology}} established {{him as an}} important figure in North India {{in the latter half}} of the 1st century. Many coins of his reign have turned up in Afghanistan, the Punjab, and the Indus Valley. Remains of some of his buildings, influenced by Greek architecture, indicate that he was a great builder. According to the legend, Thomas was a skilled carpenter and was bidden to build a palace for the king. However, the Apostle decided to teach the king a lesson by devoting the royal grant to acts of charity and thereby <b>laying</b> <b>up</b> treasure for the heavenly abode. Although little is known of the immediate growth of the church, Bar-Daisan (154–223) reports that in his time there were Christian tribes in North India which claimed to have been converted by Thomas and to have books and relics to prove it. But at least by the year of the establishment of the Second Persian Empire (226), there were bishops of the Church of the East in northwest India, Afghanistan and Baluchistan, with laymen and clergy alike engaging in missionary activity.|$|E

500|$|The {{courtship}} {{behavior of}} the zebra shark consists of the male following the female and biting vigorously at her pectoral fins and tail, with periods in which he holds onto her pectoral fin and both sharks lie still on the bottom. On occasion this leads to mating, in which the male curls his body around the female and inserts one of his claspers into her cloaca. Copulation lasts for two to five minutes. The zebra shark is oviparous, with females laying large egg capsules measuring [...] long, [...] wide, and [...] thick. The egg case is dark brown to purple in color, and has hair-like fibers along the sides that secure it to the substrate. The adhesive fibers emerge first from the female's vent; the female circles vertical structures such as reef outcroppings to entangle the fibers, so as to anchor the eggs. Females have been documented <b>laying</b> <b>up</b> to 46 eggs over a 112-day period. Eggs are deposited in batches of around four. Reproductive seasonality in the wild is unknown.|$|E

500|$|By this time, {{the navy}} was {{experiencing}} shortages of manpower {{and the ship}} was laid up on 1 September {{to be used as}} an accommodation ship while President Steyn was finishing up her modernisation. President Pretorius was formally decommissioned on 11 May 1971, but languished in reserve for some time before actual work began. The ship did not recommission until 12 July 1977 in marked contrast to the time required to modernise her sisters. She conveyed the remains of the Xhosa Chief Maqoma from Robben Island to Ciskei in August 1978. Almost three years later, in May 1981, President Pretorius and President Kruger participated in the 20th anniversary of the republic's founding and exercised with a squadron from the Republic of China (Taiwan). Shortly afterwards, the two sisters made a [...] cruise along the East African coast. After the accidental sinking of President Kruger in 1982 and the earlier <b>laying</b> <b>up</b> of President Steyn, President Pretorius was the last of the sisters remaining active. She was refitted during the early 1980s to lay mines and to operate assault boats. The ship exercised with another Taiwanese squadron in mid-1985 before she was decommissioned on 26 July due to manpower shortages and lack of funds. Plans to reactivate and modernise President Pretorius were made later in the 1980s, but shortages of money prevented them from being realized. The ship was sold for scrap on 9 December 1992 and subsequently broken up.|$|E

2500|$|The Carbon Dragon is {{predominantly}} a conventional wood and doped aircraft fabric glider, making judicious use of carbon fiber in the wing spar caps, control rods, flaperons and the elliptical tail boom to save weight. The control tubes are constructed by <b>laying</b> <b>up</b> the carbon fiber on aluminium tubing and then, when the carbon has cured, dissolving the aluminium with swimming pool acid. The cockpit is totally enclosed {{and the original}} design called for a cockpit width of [...] at the hips and [...] at the shoulder, although some have been modified to accommodate pilots of larger dimensions. The main aircraft structure consists of dual triangular torque boxes {{on each side of}} the fuselage. The wing employs a Culver SD airfoil that was designed by Irv Culver for the project and full-span flaperons of 30% chord. The flaperons can deploy from −5° to +15° as flaps and −4° to +16° as ailerons, with a 4:1 differential. The flaperons are driven by two, vertically mounted pushrods enclosed within the fuselage and connected to the side stick. The wing ribs forward of the spar are fabricated from [...] 5-ply mahogany and aft of the spar from [...] square spruce. The landing gear is a fixed monowheel, mounted on the hinged cockpit bottom door, that opens to allow the pilot to lift the aircraft for foot-launching. The aircraft was designed so that if the pilot falls while foot-launching his body will be in the rear fuselage cavity and not pinned under the aircraft. The ultimate structural load limit is +/-7.5 g, with a +/-5.0 g operational load limit.|$|E
2500|$|On October 1813, {{the ambitious}} Francis Edward Rawdon-Hastings, the Earl of Moira, assumed {{the office of}} the Governor-General, and his first act was to re-examine the border dispute between Nepal and British East India Company. These {{disputes}} arose because there was no fixed boundary separating the Nepalese and the British. A struggle with the former was unpromising as the British were ignorant of the country or its resources and, despite their technological superiority, it was a received persuasion that the nature of the mountainous tract, which they would have to penetrate, would be as baffling to them as it had been to all the efforts of many successive Mahomedan sovereigns. A border commission imposed on Nepal by the Governor-General failed to solve the problem. The Nepalese Commissioners had remarked to the British the futility of debating about a few square miles of territory since there never could be real peace between the two States, until the British should yield to the Nepalese all the British provinces north of the Ganges, making that river the boundary between the two, [...] "as heaven had evidently designed it to be." [...] In the mean time, the British found that the Nepalese were preparing for war; that they had for some time been <b>laying</b> <b>up</b> large stores of saltpetre; purchasing and fabricating arms, and organizing and disciplining their troops under some European deserters in this service, after the model of the companies of East India's sepoy battalions. The conviction that the Nepalese raids into the flatland's of the Terai, a much prized strip of fertile ground separating the Nepalese hill country from India, increased tensions – the British felt their power in the region and their tenuous lines of communication between Calcutta and the northwest were under threat. Since there was no clear border, confrontation between the two powers was [...] "necessary and unavoidable". Britain formally declared war with the Nepal on 1 Nov 1814.|$|E
