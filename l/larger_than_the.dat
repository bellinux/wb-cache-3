25|$|For example, in the {{one-line}} notation 312548976, 5 is <b>the</b> first element <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> 3, so <b>the</b> first cycle must be (312).

Finally, 9 is <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> all <b>the</b> remaining elements to its right, so the last cycle is (976).|$|R

5|$|A. n. nisosimilis was {{described}} by Samuel Tickell in 1833. It breeds from central and eastern Siberia east to Kamchatka and Japan, and south to northern China.

It is very similar to, but slightly <b>larger</b> <b>than,</b> <b>the</b> nominate subspecies.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} flows {{with normal}} velocities equal to powers strictly <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> one of <b>the</b> Gauss curvature. Under such flows closed strictly convex surfaces converge to points. In {{his work on}} the square of the norm of the second fundamental form, Schnürer proposes criteria for selecting quantities that are suitable for proving convergence to a round point. Such monotone quantities exist for many normal velocities, including the Gauss curvature, some powers <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> one of <b>the</b> mean curvature, and some powers <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> one of <b>the</b> norm of the second fundamental form. In this paper, we show that no such quantity exists for any powers <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> one of <b>the</b> Gauss curvature. Comment: 31 page...|$|R

5|$|As is {{characteristic}} of Sigmodontinae, Transandinomys talamancae has a complex penis, with the distal (far) end of the baculum (penis bone) ending in a structure consisting of three digits. As in most oryzomyines, the central digit is <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> two at the sides.

5|$|As is {{characteristic}} of apeomyines, Apeomyoides was a large eomyid with high-crowned cheekteeth and a large gap between the incisors and cheekteeth. Furthermore, the cheekteeth—premolars and molars—approach a bilophodont pattern, with two distinct lobes. Other features distinguish Apeomyoides from other apeomyines, including the rectangular shape of the cheekteeth. The fourth lower premolar (p4) is <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> molars behind it and has two roots, while the lower molars have three.|$|E
