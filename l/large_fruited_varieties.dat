40|$|T ree {{fruit growing}} {{requires}} pollinationknowledge. Sweet cherry culture ismaking a modest comeback on some New York fruit farms, but many pollina-tion questions exist. This resurgence is {{largely due to}} availability of new rootstocks and some new, <b>larger</b> <b>fruited</b> <b>varieties.</b> These have become available right at the time that diversification of New York tree fruit farm businesses is becoming more of a recognized necessity. The goal of this ar-ticle is to teach some important lessons about planning for adequate cherry polli-nation. The cherry seed that is inside of the cherry pit results from fertilization of the ovary by a compatible pollen grain and the subsequent development of the seed and its bony endocarp (covering) that we call the pit/stone. The developing seeds also stimulate the tree to retain the developing flower parts. Unfertilized flowers drop off. So do some fertilized flowers if they lack vital resources. One thing is certain, with...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to study the stress tolerance and regeneration capability of transgenic pepper plants carrying a sod gene, encoding a tomato chloroplast-localized Cu/Zn SOD protein. The expression of the sod gene was confirmed by enzymatic staining following polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), revealing a &# 8216;novel&# 8217; band, which could represent a heterodimeric enzyme. Transgenic T 1 and T 2 progeny plants were exposed to different oxidative stresses including Methyl viologen (MV) and drought and found to have an increased resistance to oxidative damage. Furthermore, the SOD carrying transgenic pepper plants showed increased levels of regeneration efficiency compared to the wild type pepper plants. Pepper is a recalcitrant species {{in terms of its}} in vitro regeneration ability but it could be extremely useful for the development of pharmaceuticals. This approach enables the extent use of pepper for genetic transformation and the production of high valuable products in plants particularly the <b>large</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>varieties...</b>|$|R

40|$|This work {{is focused}} on the {{evaluation}} of productivity and growth and phenological phases in the planting of Cornelian cherry. The evaluation was conducted on the experimental plot ŠZP Žabčice. Refraction measurement and level of vitamin C were done in the laboratory of the Institute of Plant Breeding and Propagation. Obtained values were statistically processed and evaluated and were sorted into tables and graphs and subsequently discussed in the text of the thesis. Photographs were taken during observation. These values allow selection of the most suitable type of variety for cultivation and subsequent processing. Findings also allow selecting the <b>variety</b> with the <b>largest</b> <b>fruit,</b> <b>variety</b> with highest crop yields, <b>varieties</b> of <b>fruits</b> richest in vitamin C or variety with the largest bush growth. Jolico variety yields the <b>largest</b> single <b>fruit</b> while Vyšegorodský <b>variety</b> offers highest yield of crop. Highest content of vitamin C is found in Fruchtal variety. Vydubecký variety is suitable for a rapid wood growth. Cornelian cherry is a versatile plant that can find its application in landscaping either for its heavy and hard wood or for its fruit which tastes well and is nutritionally interesting. Plant's resistance to diseases and pests is also significant. Cornelian cherry is not yet very common as a fruit in our country, however; this can change not only due to better awareness but also due to new plant varieties...|$|R

50|$|Fresh fruit {{are usually}} unpalatable, {{but they can}} be {{debittered}} and made into compote, jelly, jam, a tangy syrup, a tart chutney, or juice, as well as wine and liqueur, or used for tea or to make flour. Fruit are served as a side dish to lamb or game. Debittering can be accomplished by freezing, cooking, or drying, which degrades the parasorbic acid. The fruit are red colored in August but usually only harvested in October after the first frost by cutting the corymbs. The robust qualities of S. aucuparia make it a source for fruit in harsh mountain climate and Maria Theresa of the Habsburg Monarchy recommended the planting of the species in 1779.An edible variety, named Sorbus aucuparia var. dulcis Kraetzl, or var. edulis Dieck, or var. moravica Dippel, was first discovered in 1810 near Ostružná in the Hrubý Jeseník mountain range of Northern Moravia and became widespread in Germany and Austria the early 20th century. Its leaves are larger and pointed, only the front part of the leaflets is serrated, and they have darker bark, larger buds and <b>larger</b> <b>fruit.</b> Similar non-bitter <b>varieties</b> found in Southern Russia were first introduced in Central Europe in 1900 as 'Rossica' and 'Rossica Major', which has <b>large</b> <b>fruit</b> up to 1.5 cm in diameter.|$|R
40|$|Kigelia pinnata (Bignoniaceae), colloquially {{called the}} Sausage Tree, or Worsboom, {{on account of}} its <b>large</b> <b>fruits,</b> has a <b>variety</b> of {{medicinal}} uses throughout Africa where it grows as an endemic species in many areas. Chemical examination {{has resulted in the}} isolation of iridoids and naphthoquinoids as important secondary metabolites but flavonoids and lignans have also been isolated. Investigation into the biological activity of K. pinnata has focussed on its antibacterial activity and its cytotoxic effects against cancer cell lines. These are related to the traditional uses of bark and fruit extracts for treating diseases caused by micro-organisms and as a remedy for skin cancer. The iridoids and naphthoquinones have been shown to display antibacterial activity and also the ability to inhibit the growth of yeasts. Considerable in vitro cytotoxicity has been demonstrated by extracts of the fruits and barks and the iridoid-related compound norviburtinal and the naphthoquinone isopinnatal {{have been shown to be}} two of the compounds responsible. Although little ethnopharmacological evidence exists, the naphthoquinones are active against several protozoal species associated with disease. The compounds also show cytotoxicity against mammalian cell lines. More research is needed to investigate further the reputed effects on the skin of extracts of this plant...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. To {{determine}} morphological and morphometric {{features of}} vegetative and generative organs of Persica species and varieties under {{the conditions of}} the Forest-Steppe zone of Ukraine for further use in breeding. Methods. Biological (morphological analysis) and statistical (processing of morphometric parameters) ones. Results. It was found that except ternate multiple buds, in peach hybrid ‘Suputnyk’collateral buds were prevalent which was not common to other tested varieties and species. Buds of each species and variety have a certain number of scales. The most scales were observed in ‘Suputnyk’. Pubescence of abaxial side of the leaf in P. davіdiana and ‘Suputnyk’ plants was not revealed. Species of P. vulgaris (‘Pecherskyi’, ‘Antotsianovyi’, ‘Poleskyi’) was characterized by increase in size of leaf blades, flowers and fruits. The distinctive features of P. davidiana and ‘Suputnyk’ are that stamens were accumulated in their flowers while in P. vulgaris they are branched. Raphe of a P. vulgaris stone protrudes above the edges of the bordering creases and consists of a number of narrow plates. Conclusions. For the breeding purposes, plants have an advantage for some basic criteria: the most flower buds that is common to interspecies hybrid ‘Suputnyk’; increase in photosynthetic productivity of the leaf apparatus to be typical for the <b>variety</b> ‘Pecherskyi’; <b>large</b> <b>fruits</b> that ‘Pecherskyi’ <b>variety</b> is noted for; intense red color of fruits that is inherent feature of ‘Antocianovyi’ variety...|$|R
