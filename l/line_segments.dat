5|$|Paterson's worms are {{a family}} of {{cellular}} automata devised in 1971 by Mike Paterson and John Horton Conway to model the behaviour and feeding patterns of certain prehistoric worms. In the model, a worm moves between points on a triangular grid along <b>line</b> <b>segments,</b> representing food. Its turnings {{are determined by the}} configuration of eaten and uneaten <b>line</b> <b>segments</b> adjacent to {{the point at which the}} worm currently is. Despite being governed by simple rules the behaviour of the worms can be extremely complex, and the ultimate fate of one variant is still unknown.|$|E
5|$|A {{solution}} to the minimax path problem between the two opposite corners of a grid graph {{can be used to}} find the weak Fréchet distance between two polygonal chains. Here, each grid graph vertex represents a pair of <b>line</b> <b>segments,</b> one from each chain, and the weight of an edge represents the Fréchet distance needed to pass from one pair of segments to another.|$|E

5000|$|In geometry, a <b>line</b> <b>segment</b> {{is a part}} of a {{line that}} is bounded by two {{distinct}} end points, and contains every point on the line between its endpoints. A closed <b>line</b> <b>segment</b> includes both endpoints, while an open <b>line</b> <b>segment</b> excludes both endpoints; a half-open <b>line</b> <b>segment</b> includes exactly one of the endpoints.|$|R
5000|$|Perpendicularity easily {{extends to}} {{segments}} and rays. For example, a <b>line</b> <b>segment</b> [...] is perpendicular to a <b>line</b> <b>segment</b> [...] if, when each is extended {{in both directions}} to form an infinite line, these two resulting lines are perpendicular in the sense above. In symbols, [...] means <b>line</b> <b>segment</b> AB is perpendicular to <b>line</b> <b>segment</b> CD.|$|R
5|$|In another drawing style, the {{circular}} layout, the vertices of a graph {{are placed on}} a circle and the edges are drawn either inside or outside the circle. Again, a placement of the edges within the circle (for instance as straight <b>line</b> <b>segments)</b> corresponds to a one-page book drawing, while a placement {{both inside and outside}} the circle corresponds to a two-page book drawing.|$|E
5|$|The Euclidean {{algorithm}} {{is one of}} the oldest algorithms in common use. It appears in Euclid's Elements (c. 300 BC), specifically in Book 7 (Propositions 1–2) and Book 10 (Propositions 2–3). In Book 7, the {{algorithm is}} formulated for integers, whereas in Book 10, it is formulated for lengths of <b>line</b> <b>segments.</b> (In modern usage, one would say it was formulated there for real numbers. But lengths, areas, and volumes, represented as real numbers in modern usage, are not measured in the same units and there is no natural unit of length, area, or volume; the concept of real numbers was unknown at that time.) The latter algorithm is geometrical. The GCD of two lengths a and b corresponds to the greatest length g that measures a and b evenly; in other words, the lengths a and b are both integer multiples of the length g.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} a dual {{tessellation}} can also be applied to partitions of the plane into finitely many regions. It {{is closely related to}} but not quite the same as planar graph duality in this case. For instance, the Voronoi diagram of a finite set of point sites is a partition of the plane into polygons within which one site is closer than any other. The sites on the convex hull of the input give rise to unbounded Voronoi polygons, two of whose sides are infinite rays rather than finite <b>line</b> <b>segments.</b> The dual of this diagram is the Delaunay triangulation of the input, a planar graph that connects two sites by an edge whenever there exists a circle that contains those two sites and no other sites. The edges of the convex hull of the input are also edges of the Delaunay triangulation, but they correspond to rays rather than <b>line</b> <b>segments</b> of the Voronoi diagram. This duality between Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations can be turned into a duality between finite graphs in either of two ways: by adding an artificial vertex at infinity to the Voronoi diagram, to serve as the other endpoint for all of its rays, or by treating the bounded part of the Voronoi diagram as the weak dual of the Delaunay triangulation. Although the Voronoi diagram and Delaunay triangulation are dual, their embedding in the plane may have additional crossings beyond the crossings of dual pairs of edges. Each vertex of the Delaunay triangle is positioned within its corresponding face of the Voronoi diagram. Each vertex of the Voronoi diagram is positioned at the circumcenter of the corresponding triangle of the Delaunay triangulation, but this point may lie outside its triangle.|$|E

40|$|New {{modifications}} of the Cohen-Sutherland algorithm for the <b>line</b> and <b>line</b> <b>segment</b> clipping in E 2 are presented.

The proposed algorithms are convenient for <b>line</b> or <b>line</b> <b>segment</b> clipping by the rectangle. Theoretical considerations and experimental results are also presented. The CS algorithm based on coding of the end-points of the given <b>line</b> <b>segment</b> is a very well known algorithm. It is simple and robust.

25|$|Euler {{discussed}} a generalization of Euclidean geometry called affine geometry, which retains the fifth postulate unmodified while weakening postulates {{three and four}} {{in a way that}} eliminates the notions of angle (whence right triangles become meaningless) and of equality of length of <b>line</b> <b>segments</b> in general (whence circles become meaningless) while retaining the notions of parallelism as an equivalence relation between lines, and equality of length of parallel <b>line</b> <b>segments</b> (so <b>line</b> <b>segments</b> continue to have a midpoint).|$|E

It is not hard to see that a pointed pseudotriangulation is a pseudotriangulation of its convex hull: all convex hull edges may be added while preserving the angle-spanning property, and all interior faces must be pseudotriangles else a bitangent line segment could be added between two vertices of the face.|$|E
