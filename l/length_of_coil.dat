50|$|One of the {{strengths}} of spiral coil binding is that the supplies are available {{in a variety of}} lengths. Most users purchase spiral coils in twelve inch lengths. This spine is inserted onto an eleven-inch document and the excess <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>coil</b> is cut and crimped {{at each end of the}} book. However, the forming process for creating spiral coil binding elements allows them to be created in virtually any length. Many binderies and print shops choose to purchase coils in 36-inch lengths in order to have the flexibility to bind custom document sizes and to reduce waste. For binding documents shorter than eleven inches it is also possible to purchase shorter lengths of spiral coil in order to save time and money.|$|E
50|$|A micro {{controller}} or stepper motor controller {{can be used}} to activate the drive transistors in the right order, and this ease of operation makes unipolar motors popular with hobbyists; they are probably the cheapest way to get precise angular movements.(For the experimenter, the windings can be identified by touching the terminal wires together in PM motors. If the terminals of a coil are connected, the shaft becomes harder to turn. One way to distinguish the center tap (common wire) from a coil-end wire is by measuring the resistance. Resistance between common wire and coil-end wire is always half of the resistance between coil-end wires. This is because there is twice the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>coil</b> between the ends and only half from center (common wire) to the end. A quick way to determine if the stepper motor is working is to short circuit every two pairs and try turning the shaft. Whenever a higher than normal resistance is felt, it indicates that the circuit to the particular winding is closed and that the phase is working.|$|E

Materials and methods : The study consisted of 60 samples of open and closed coil springs (30 each).

Results : Mean values, standard deviation and t-value were calculated. Statistically significant difference were obtained in between the groups (p < 0. 05), (p < 0. 001).

Based on this, a novel spectrophotometric method with flow injection analysis has been established to determine ammonia nitrogen in water. Experimental parameters related to the flow injection method and the reaction were optimized throughout the experiments based on univariate experimental design. The <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>coil</b> is optimized as 1. 6  m for storing up standard or sample solution. The optimal value is 8. 20  mL/min for loading flow rate of coloring solution. The OPA concentration, sulfite concentration and reaction pH are chosen as 1. 06  g/L, 0. 050  g/L and 10. 80, respectively. The reaction temperature and stop flow time affects the performances of the method. The linearity range and detection limit of the proposed method are 0. 100 – 0. 700  mmol/L and 0. 007  mmol/L at the reaction temperature of 55  °C and stop flow time of 340  s, respectively.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work is to study the influence of curvature on local boiling heat transfer coefficient and two-phase pressure drop in helically coiled tubes with water as the working medium. In helically coiled tubes, the geometric parameters like pipe diameter and coil diameter vary the curvature and hence secondary flow which affects the heat transfer distribution and pressure drop. The present work investigates the characteristics of flow boiling in helically coiled tubes. Very less information {{is available on the}} influence of curvature on flow boiling system. The local wall temperature is measured not only in the axial direction (along the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>coil)</b> but also in the circumferential direction using thermal imaging technique. Experiments are performed with six helically coiled test sections made of SS 304 tubes having inner diameters varying from 6 to 10 mm. The coil diameter to the tube diameter ratio ranges from 14 to 58 and coil pitch is 50 mm. The effect of geometric and operating parameters like tube diameter, coil diameter, heat flux and mass flux on local boiling heat transfer coefficient and two-phase pressure drop is analysed. In the subcooled region and in a low quality region, boiling heat transfer coefficient in helical coils is much higher (12 %- 100 %) than in straight tubes. However, in a high quality region, the boiling heat transfer coefficient in helical coils is same as in straight tubes. A correlation is suggested for two-phase pressure drop in helical coils.

40|$|High {{performance}} gradient and shim coils {{are highly}} interested for high-field {{magnetic resonance imaging}} and spectroscopy to correct for large B 0 inhomogeneities created by the magnetic susceptibility differences between tissues, bone, and air. In chapter two, complete sets of high-performance gradient and shim coils are designed using two different methods: the minimum inductance and the minimum power target field methods. A quantitative comparison of shim performance in terms of merit of inductance, ML, and merit of resistance, MR, is made for shim coils designed using the minimum inductance and the minimum power design algorithms. The coils designed using the target field method are not controlled over the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>coil.</b> In order to produce realistic coils for use in human or small-animal studies, direct control over the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>coils</b> is necessary. Therefore in chapter three, an extended Fourier series method for the design <b>of</b> shim <b>coils</b> with predetermined length is presented. This simple method {{is based on a}} truncated Fourier series expansion of the current density to allow for explicit control over the coil length. This method is mathematically simple, easy to implement and computationally fast. Also a quantitative comparison of figures of merit for inductance and resistance is made as a function <b>of</b> shim <b>coil</b> <b>length.</b> <b>Coils</b> <b>of</b> 40 cm diameter are designed with <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> 50 cm, 60 cm, 80 cm, and 100 cm.
