30|$|In {{computer}} vision, head pose estimation can {{be defined}} as the ability to deduce head orientation relatively to a view of camera and it can refer to different interpretations [14]. At coarse level, a head is identified by a few discrete poses, but it might be estimated by a continuous angular measurement according to multiple degrees of freedom. The discrete representation is adapted to the applications requiring the knowledge of limited number of pose classes instead of the whole possible pose angles corresponding to the continuous representation. Even if muscular rotation of head influences its orientation, it is often ignored and human head is considered as an incorporeal rigid object. This hypothesis allows to represent head pose using only three degrees of freedom which are pitch, yaw, and roll. Pitch corresponds to up and down motion around the X axis, yaw refers to <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>right</b> <b>direction</b> around the Y axis, and roll represents tilting the head towards <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>right</b> <b>direction</b> around the Z axis (see Fig. 1). Another hypothesis to be considered when building head pose estimator is the pose similarity assumption, which means that different people at the same pose look more similar than the same person at different poses. In literature [14 – 16], three requirements are established to define an efficient head pose estimator.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Fast {{and stable}} {{detection}} of humans in natural scenes is a challenging task {{due to the}} varying appearance of the target and diverse background. Under these circumstances a higher-level analysis, e. g. action classification, becomes even more difficult, as it {{is dependent on the}} quality of the preceding steps in the processing pipeline. In this paper we address this issue on both levels: low-level detection, and high-level classification. Detecting human figures is formulated as a problem of finding maxima of the distribution generated in the Haar cascade's response space. To find these maxima, we employ an augmented Mean Shift algorithm which assigns each hypothesis a confidence measure related to the distance of the classifier's response from the decision boundary. This confidence is incorporated in the Mean Shift formula to direct the search towards the more reliable hypotheses, which ensures a more accurate detection. On top of the detection framework we have developed a Hidden Markov Model action classifier. It is based on a discrete set of key poses obtained via clustering and utilises a simple motion feature representation. Our approach is exemplified by gait recognition. The model has been trained to recognise four different types, separately in the <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>right</b> <b>direction,</b> using the video sequences obtained with a stationary DV camcorder. Good performance on the unseen sequences has been observed which validates our approach and suggests it could be adopted for more general action recognition.

Twenty seven piglets were divided into control, Salmonella enteritidis (SE) infection, and Escherichia coli (EC) infection group, and their movements were monitored for five days using wireless sensor nodes on their backs. Data generated showed the 3 -axis movement of piglets (X-axis: <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>right</b> <b>direction,</b> Y-axis: anteroposterior direction, and Z-axis: up and down direction) at five different time periods. Piglets in both infected groups had lower weight gain and feed intake, as well as higher feed conversion ratios than the control group (p< 0. 05). Infection with SE and EC resulted in reduced body temperature of the piglets at day 2, 4, and 5 (p< 0. 05). The early morning X-axis movement did not differ between groups; however, the Y-axis movement was higher in the EC group (day 1 and 2), and the Z-axis movement was higher in the EC (day 1) and SE group (day 4) during different experimental periods (p< 0. 05). The morning X and Y-axis movement did not differ between treatment groups. However, the Z-axis movement was higher in both infected groups at day 1 and lower at day 4 compared to the control (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Movement {{of motor}} {{proteins}} along cytoskeletal filaments is fundamental for various cellular processes ranging from muscle contraction over cell division and flagellar movement to intracellular transport. Not surprisingly, the impairment of motility {{was shown to}} cause severe diseases. For example, a link between impaired intracellular transport and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s, has been established. There, the movement of kinesin- 1, a neuronal motor protein transporting vesicles along microtubules toward the axonal terminal, {{is thought to be}} strongly affected by roadblocks leading to malfunction and death of the nerve cell. Detailed information on how the motility of kinesin- 1 deteriorates in the presence of roadblocks and whether the motor has a mechanism to circumvent such obstructions is scarce. In this thesis, kinesin- 1 motility was studied in vitro in the presence of rigor kinesin- 1 mutants, which served as permanent roadblocks, under controlled single-molecule conditions. The 25 nm wide microtubule track, consisting of 13 individual protofilaments, resembles a multi-lane environment for transport by processive kinesin- 1 motors. The existence of multiple traffic-lanes, allows kinesin- 1 to utilize different paths for cargo transport and potentially also for the circumvention of roadblocks. However, direct observation of motor encounters with roadblocks has been intricate in the past, mainly due to limitations in both, spatial and temporal resolution. These limitations, intrinsic to fluorescent probes commonly utilized to report on the motor positions, originate from a low rate of photon generation (low brightness) and a limited photostability (short observation time). Thus, studying kinesin- 1 encounters with microtubule-associated roadblocks requires alternative labels, which explicitly avoid the shortcomings of fluorescence and consequently allow for a higher localization precision. Promising candidates for replacing fluorescent dyes are gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), which offer an enormous scattering cross-section due to plasmon resonance in the visible part of the optical spectrum. Problematic, however, is their incorporation into conventionally used (fluorescence) microscopes, because illumination and scattered light have the same wavelength and cannot be separated spectrally. Therefore, an approach based on total internal reflection (TIR) utilizing a novel parabolically shaped quartz prism for illumination was developed within this thesis. This approach provided homogenous and spatially invariant illumination profiles in combination with a convenient control over a wide range of illumination angles. Moreover, single-molecule fluorescence as well as single-particle scattering were detectable with high signal-to-noise ratios. Importantly, AuNPs with a diameter of 40 nm provided sub-nanometer localization accuracies within millisecond integration times and reliably reported on the characteristic 8 nm stepping of individual kinesin- 1 motors moving along microtubules. These results highlight the potential of AuNPs to replace fluorescent probes in future single-molecule experiments. The newly developed parabolic prism-type TIR microscope is expected to strongly facilitate such approaches in the future. To study how the motility of kinesin- 1 is affected by permanent roadblocks on the microtubule lattice, first, conventional objective-type TIRF microscopy was applied to GFP-labeled motors. An increasing density of roadblocks caused the mean velocity, run length, and dwell time to decrease exponentially. This is explained by (i) the kinesin- 1 motors showing extended pausing phases when confronted with a roadblock and (ii) the roadblocks causing a reduction in the free path of the motors. Furthermore, kinesin- 1 was found to be highly sensitive to the crowdedness of microtubules as a roadblock decoration as low as 1 % sufficed to significantly reduce the landing rate. To study events, where kinesin- 1 molecules continued their runs after having paused in front of a roadblock, AuNPs were loaded onto the tails of the motors. When observing the kinesin- 1 motors with nanometer-precision, it was interestingly found that about 60 % of the runs continued by movements to the side, with the <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>right</b> <b>direction</b> being equally likely. This finding suggests that kinesin- 1 is able to reach to a neighboring protofilament in order to ensure ongoing transportation. In the absence of roadblocks, individual kinesin- 1 motors stepped sideward with a much lower, but non-vanishing probability (0. 2 % per step). These findings suggest that processive motor proteins may possess an intrinsic side stepping mechanism, potentially optimized by evolution for their specific intracellular tasks...|$|E
40|$|The central {{question}} of this thesis is how {{and to what}} extent the representation of ambient heat transfer in the calculation models contributes to observed deviations between modelled and measured flow parameters in natural gas transmission. The focus is on the heat transfer occurring with buried pipelines. The research approach was a combination of model studies with a large experimental component. The first 12 km of an export gas pipeline was instrumented and used for the experimental investigation of heat transfer behaviour and result verification. This pipeline section contains both onshore and offshore sections. A high accuracy model was made. Real data of the gas flow instrumentation present on the pipeline define the fluid conditions at the model boundaries. At an onshore location, the pipeline and surrounding soil was instrumented. Measurements included pipe wall and soil temperatures, soil humidity and meteorological quantities. A one-dimensional flow model was used to model the gas flow inside the pipe. This model is coupled to three different external heat transfer models of the ambient domain (pipe wall layers and soil) for comparison. These heat transfer models are 1 D steady state, 1 D radial unsteady and 2 D unsteady description of pipe wall layer and soil. Both conduction and convection heat transfer in the soil layers were investigated. The effect of transient boundary conditions on heat transfer rates and flow parameter calculations were quantified. The developed models were used to analyse and understand the experimental data, to study the effect of different external heat transfer models, the relevant importance of different heat transfer modes, and the boundary condition assumptions on the pipe flow calculations. The thesis addresses the following research objectives: - The spatial and temporal formulation of the heat transfer problem: how does the choice of external heat transfer model influence the calculation accuracy of the flow parameters during transient flow? To what degree do the different models capture the physics around the pipeline - Sensitivities for governing parameters: how do key governing ambient parameters like air/seawater temperature, and the thermal properties of the soil affect the calculation accuracy of the flow parameters? - The effect of ground water convection and ambient boundary conditions on calculating the flow parameters The model verification, carried out over an extended period, and the sensitivity studies show that including the heat storage term in the ambient model has the biggest impact on the accuracy of the calculated gas temperatures. The accuracy of gas pressures is much less sensitive for the choice of heat transfer model. A large improvement in the calculation accuracy of gas temperatures is obtained when using an unsteady heat conduction model representing the pipe and soil in radial coordinates. This confirm findings from earlier published work that using such a so called 1 D radial unsteady model of the pipe wall and soil, i. e. including the time dependent heat storage term in the governing heat conduction equation, leads to a major improvement of the calculation of gas temperatures during transient flow. This model was compared to the 2 D unsteady model, based on coupling a FLUENT model to the flow model. The heat transfer response obtained with the 1 D radial unsteady model was found very similar to the geometrically more accurate 2 D unsteady model during transient flow conditions. The 1 D radial unsteady model does lead to a gas temperature error in response to the annual periodic ambient temperature. This error was found to be small for a typical export gas pipeline, but can be significant for other configurations. The error introduced by the definition of the ambient soil surface boundary condition was also found to be small compared to the choice of heat transfer model. The results show that the gas temperature is sensitive to the values of soil thermal conductivity, inner film coefficient and seawater temperature during transient flow. The soil surface boundary conditions have a smaller influence. The sensitivity for the governing parameters of the heat transfer model is strongly dependent on the flow conditions; the resulting deviations in gas temperature are larger during transient flow conditions resulting in large gas temperature fluctuations. The results also show that the effect of natural convection upon the heat transfer is small for the studied case but that at higher intrinsic permeability of the soil, the role of natural convection will play a significant role. The role of forced convection was found to have a negligible effect. Soil thermal properties were determined using different methods. The resulting values for thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity are in agreement with each other to within the measurement accuracy. The measurements in the soil surrounding the pipe show that the thermal properties are mostly constant in time. Some temporal variations were found, but these were not found to make a significant difference on the resulting calculated heat transfer rates and gas temperatures. The experimental results show that the temporal development of soil temperature profiles around the pipe is asymmetrical when comparing the <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>right</b> <b>direction.</b> The soil temperatures under the pipe close to the pipe wall were found to be lower than those above the pipe wall, which is opposite of the expectation with a heat conduction model. Both the use of forced and natural convection heat transfer in the model could not explain this difference, but the asymmetry was found not to affect the heat transfer rates significantly within the accuracy of the measurements and calculations. Comparison to experimental results during a longer time period, showed that using a 1 D radial unsteady model leads to good overall agreement in gas temperature, pressure and pipe wall heat transfer. However, incidental, significant, gas temperature and pressure deviations still occur in connection with transient flow conditions. A 1 D radial unsteady heat conduction model with constant thermal properties, using air temperature as soil surface boundary condition, will for most practical purposes satisfactorily approximate the more complex physics of the heat and mass transfer in the soil in response to the gas temperature fluctuations and the ambient parameters...|$|E

Previous work by Bresnan and colleagues adopted a statistical modeling approach to investigate the probabilistic trends in English dative alternation. In this paper, we report a similar study on Mandarin Chinese. We further developed Bresnan et al. ’s models to suit the complexity of the Chinese data. Our models effectively explain away {{a large proportion of the}} variation in the data, and unveil some interesting probabilistic features of Chinese grammar. Among other things, we show that Chinese dative {{variation is}} sensitive to heavy NP shift in both <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>right</b> <b>directions...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} asymmetric (nonreciprocal) wave transmission {{through a}} layered nonlinear, non mirror-symmetric system {{described by the}} one-dimensional Discrete Nonlinear Schrödinger equation with spatially varying coefficients embedded in an otherwise linear lattice. Focusing on the simplest case of two nonlinear sites (the dimer), we compute exact scattering solutions such that waves with the same frequency and incident amplitude impinging from <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>right</b> <b>directions</b> have different transmission coefficients. The stability of some particular solutions is addressed. We show that oscillatory instability {{may lead to the}} formation of stable extended states coexisting with a nonlinear defect mode oscillating at a different frequency. Numerical simulations of wave packet scattering are presented. Gaussian wave packets with the same amplitude arriving from opposite directions on the dimer are indeed transmitted very differently. Moreover, asymmetric transmission is sensitively dependent on the input parameters, akin to the case of chaotic scattering.

40|$|Abstract. Models {{for visual}} motion {{perception}} exist since {{some time in}} neurophysiology as well as computer vision. In this paper, we present a comparison between a behavioral study performed with macaque mon-keys and the output of a computational model. The tasks include the discrimination between <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>right</b> walking <b>directions</b> <b>and</b> forward vs. backward walking. The goal is to measure generalization performance over different walking and running speeds. We show in which cases the results match, and discuss and interpret differences. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate direction judgment in a curved corridor. Each participant walked through the curved corridor. A direction was presented to participants at the entrance, and {{they were asked to}} point this direction at two points within the corridor. The present study proposed two hypotheses : (a) participants underestimate the change of their traveling direction while walking; (b) participants use four-direction reference axes (front, back, <b>left,</b> <b>and</b> <b>right)</b> for <b>direction</b> judgment. Both hypotheses were supported, and it was suggested that participants estimated the change of their traveling direction to be approximately 90...|$|R
