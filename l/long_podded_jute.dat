40|$|Cat’s claw creeper vine, Dolichandra unguis-cati (L.) Lohmann (syn. Macfadyena unguis-cati (L.) Gentry) (Bignoniaceae), {{is a major}} {{environmental}} weed in Australia. Two distinct forms of this weed (‘long’ and ‘short’ pod), with differences in leaf morphology and fruit size, occur in Australia. The <b>long</b> <b>pod</b> form has only been reported in less than fifteen localities {{in the whole of}} south-east Queensland, while the short pod form is widely distributed in Queensland and New South Wales. This study sought to compare growth traits such as specific leaf area, relative growth rate, stem length, shoot/root ratio, tuber biomass and branching architecture between these forms. These traits were monitored under glasshouse conditions over a period of 18 months. Short pod exhibited higher values of relative growth rates, stem length, number of tubers and specific leaf area than <b>long</b> <b>pod,</b> but only after 10 months of plant growth. Prior to this, <b>long</b> and short <b>pod</b> did not differ significantly. Higher values for these traits have been described as characteristics of successful colonizers. Results from this study could partly explain why the short pod form is more widely distributed in Australia while <b>long</b> <b>pod</b> is confined to a few localities...|$|R

40|$|Cat’s claw creeper vine, Dolichandra unguis-cati (L.) Lohmann (syn. Macfadyena unguis-cati (L.) Gentry), {{is a major}} {{environmental}} weed in Australia. Two forms of the weed with distinctive leaf morphology and reproductive traits, including varying fruit size, occur in Queensland, Australia. The <b>long</b> <b>pod</b> form occurs in a few localities in Queensland, while the short pod form is widely distributed in Queensland and northern part of New South Wales. This investigation aimed to evaluate germination behavior and occurrence of polyembryony (production of multiple seedlings from a single seed) in the two forms of the weed. Seeds were germinated in growth chambers set to 10 / 20 °C, 15 / 25 °C, 20 / 30 °C, 30 / 45 °C and 25 °C, representing ambient temperature conditions of the region. Germination and polyembryony were monitored {{over a period of}} 12 weeks. For all the treatments in this study, seeds from short pod plants exhibited significantly higher germination rates and higher occurrence of polyembryony than those from <b>long</b> <b>pod</b> plants. Seeds from <b>long</b> <b>pod</b> plants did not germinate at the lowest temperature of 10 / 20 °C; in contrast, those of the short pod form germinated under this condition, albeit at a lower rate (reaching a maximum 45 % germination at week 12). Results from this study could explain why the short pod form of D. unguis-cati is the more widely distributed plants in Australia, while the <b>long</b> <b>pod</b> is confined to a few localities. The results have implication in predicting future range of both forms of the invasive D. unguis-cati, as well as inform management decisions for control of the weed...|$|R

5|$|The flame tree {{does not}} rely on fire but shoots its seeds through the air when {{the two sides of}} its <b>long</b> <b>pods</b> crack apart explosively on drying. The {{miniature}} cone-like catkins of alder trees produce seeds that contain small droplets of oil that help disperse the seeds on the surface of water. Mangroves often grow in water and some species have propagules, which are buoyant fruits with seeds that start germinating before becoming detached from the parent tree. These float on the water and may become lodged on emerging mudbanks and successfully take root.|$|R
50|$|C. viminale is a {{leafless}} {{succulent plant}} with cylindrical, green photosynthetic stems. The plant may grow as a shrub or a scandent vine. The stems produce copious amounts of milky exudate when broken. This exudate is caustic {{in nature and}} can cause burns if it contacts human skin. The plant produces small white flowers in clusters. Flowers are followed by <b>long</b> <b>pods</b> which produce numerous seeds with silky plumes that aid in wind dispersal. The environmental range of the species is very broad, extending from rainforest margins and monsoon forests to arid deserts.|$|R
50|$|Despite its name, {{the honey}} locust {{is not a}} {{significant}} honey plant.

50|$|Locust bean gum is a {{galactomannan}} vegetable gum {{extracted from}} {{the seeds of the}} carob tree, mostly found in the Mediterranean region. The <b>long</b> <b>pods</b> that grow on the tree are used to make this gum. The pods are kibbled to separate the seed from the pulp. The seeds have their skins removed by an acid treatment. The deskinned seed is then split and gently milled. This causes the brittle germ to break up while not affecting the more robust endosperm. The two are separated by sieving. The separated endosperm can then be milled by a roller operation to produce the final locust bean gum powder.|$|R
50|$|The plant's stems are 15 - 50 cm high {{while the}} leaves carry 5 to 9 {{leaflets}} with petioles being 4 - 15 cm long. The leaflets themselves are elliptic and are 1.5 - 5 cm long. Flowers have 3 - 10 cm long racemes {{which have a}} two-lipped calyx. The upper lip of it is 4 - 6 mm long while the lower one is 5 - 7 mm. L. kuschei have 10 - 13 mm long corollas which are either blue or purple in colour. The fruits have 2 - 3 cm <b>long</b> <b>pods</b> which carry seeds that are 4 - 6 cm long.|$|R
50|$|Products of {{the tree}} are well known in many areas as foods. The <b>long</b> <b>pod</b> is eaten as a {{vegetable}}. It {{can be added to}} salad and chutney. In Thai cuisine this vegetable is known as nitta sprout, and it is added to curry. The hard, black seeds are eaten fresh, or they can be dried and stored. The seeds have a strong sulphur smell, which is due to the presence of thioproline. Some find this smell and similar taste so appealing that they consider the seeds a delicacy. In some areas, the seeds of the related tree species Parkia speciosa are much more popular, and tree bean will be consumed as a second choice.|$|R
