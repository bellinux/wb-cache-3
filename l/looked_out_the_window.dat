25|$|When David {{heard that}} God had blessed Obed-Edom {{because of the}} Ark, David brought the Ark to Jerusalem with joy. When those who bore the Ark had gone six paces, they sacrificed an ox and a fatling. The Israelites brought up the Ark with {{shouting}} {{and the sound of}} the horn, and David danced with all his might girded with a linen ephod. As the Ark came into the city, Michal the daughter of Saul <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and saw David leaping and dancing, and she despised him in her heart.|$|E
25|$|On 25 December, North Korea {{proposed}} to hold {{talks on the}} matter. Talks were finally held in late January 1970. Sixty-six days after the incident, North Korea released 39 of the passengers on 14 February through the Joint Security Area at Panmunjom, but kept the aircraft, crew, and remaining passengers. The statements provided by the released passengers refuted North Korea's claims that the hijacking was led by the pilots; instead, they pinned the blame {{on one of the}} passengers. One man claimed to have <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> of the aircraft despite instructions from the North Korean guards, and saw the hijacker being driven away in a black sedan. Another passenger was reported to have become mentally deranged {{as a result of his}} captivity, and lost the ability to speak.|$|E

500|$|After Beyoncé {{finished}} her {{concert at the}} Trent FM Arena in Nottingham, England on November 20, 2009, she announced to the crowd that a new album would be released the next year. I Am... World Tour features performances from Beyoncé's tour. She explained {{that the idea of}} filming her worldwide performances came when she realized that she was feeling lonely, stating [...] "there was one moment I was in China and I was in this huge suite and I <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and there were just thousands of people walking and I couldn't believe my life... I guess I was a bit lonely and I wanted to talk to someone so I opened up my computer and I just talked." [...] Additionally, Beyoncé revealed that the DVD will show more of her intimate side. The album's track listing was confirmed on November 12, 2010. Both Jay-Z and Kanye West make guest appearances on the DVD. In November 2010, there was a sweepstakes to win tickets to an exclusive screening of the DVD.|$|E
500|$|On Wednesday, March 3, 1993, in Rancho Viejo, Texas, an {{affluent}} community {{just north of}} Brownsville, Fischer woke up early {{to get ready for}} school. Just before 7:00a.m., he went to the garage and reversed his mother's car into the circular driveway at his home at 3 Cortez Avenue. He then walked toward {{the corner of the house}} and grabbed a garden hose to spray water on the car's windows, which were covered in dust. As he sprayed the car, someone came from behind and shot him twice at point-blank range with what would later be identified as a [...]38 Super pistol. One of the shots penetrated his chest and the others his brain. Fischer's mother <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> to see what had happened, thinking the noise came from one of the house's palm tree branches falling on the roof, or that the car had backfired. She did not see the car, and thought that perhaps her son had gone to a convenience store to pick up something, but Fischer's brother Eric told her he could see the car parked on the driveway.|$|E
500|$|A.G. Gaston, who {{was appalled}} {{at the idea of}} using children, {{was on the phone with}} white {{attorney}} David Vann trying to negotiate a resolution to the crisis. [...] When Gaston <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and saw the children being hit with high-pressure water, he said, [...] "Lawyer Vann, I can't talk to you now or ever. My people are out there fighting for their lives and my freedom. I have to go help them", and hung up the phone. Black parents and adults who were observing cheered the marching students, but when the hoses were turned on, bystanders began to throw rocks and bottles at the police. [...] To disperse them, Connor ordered police to use German shepherd dogs to keep them in line. James Bevel wove in and out of the crowds warning them, [...] "If any cops get hurt, we're going to lose this fight." [...] At 3p.m., the protest was over. [...] During a kind of truce, protesters went home. Police removed the barricades and re-opened the streets to traffic. That evening King told worried parents in a crowd of a thousand, [...] "Don't worry about your children who are in jail. The eyes of the world are on Birmingham. We're going on in spite of dogs and fire hoses. We've gone too far to turn back." ...|$|E

2500|$|By 1971, Knievel {{realized}} that the U.S. government would never allow him to jump the Grand Canyon. To keep his fans interested, Knievel considered several other stunts that might match the publicity {{that would have been}} generated by jumping the canyon. Ideas included jumping across the Mississippi River, jumping from one skyscraper to another in New York City, and jumping over 13 cars inside the Houston Astrodome. While flying back to Butte from a performance tour, Knievel <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and saw the Snake River Canyon. After finding a location just east of Twin Falls, Idaho, that was wide enough, deep enough, and on private property, Knievel leased [...] for $35,000 to stage his jump. He set the date for Labor Day (September 4), 1972.|$|E
2500|$|General Murray survived two plane crashes in his lifetime. The {{first was}} before the {{ejection}} seat and took place when he was instructing a student {{that was one of}} The Tuskeegee Airmen. They were flying in a single-engine, two-seater trainer with a slide-back canopy over Florida. An oil hose broke and they lost engine power. Murray was able {{to take control of the}} plane and land it in a swampy field, causing severe damage to the engine and belly of the plane. They were not injured. The second plane crash was when General Murray was an executive for an aerospace company and was aboard the company's business jet as a passenger. The plane began its descent for landing on a very cold winter day in Michigan. General Murray, concerned about an ice buildup, <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> over the wing and noticed large sheets of ice on the wings. He quickly notified the pilots, but it was too late. General Murray then observed the ice breaking off of the wings and being sucked into the jet engine intakes. The engines shut down, and the plane had to make an emergency landing on a partially iced-over lake. Upon the plane crashing, it immediately burst into flames. General Murray quickly opened the door and ushered out the pilots and the other executives he was traveling with. The water was now covered in aircraft fuel. The fuel ignited, leaving General Murray no escape. His only option was to dive into the flames that were on top of the water. He suffered burns that were, fortunately, not serious. He said that swimming in the icy waters was the worst of it! ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} German {{title is}} [...] "". The story {{is also known}} as [...] "The <b>Window</b> on <b>the</b> Street" [...] The story is a two sentence long passage written by Kafka. The Narrator of this passage omnisciently takes perspective of life through a window overlooking our character's street. The character is a man who lives a life of solitude, but occasionally wants to have human interaction, and by <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and seeing <b>the</b> people on the street, he fulfills his desire to have human interaction. In the second sentence of the passage, the Narrator discusses the times when the man does not want to <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> but <b>the</b> desire (“the horses”) then overwhelms him and in <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> he attains <b>the</b> happiness he desired. The imagery of “horses ... draging ... him into the train or their wagons ... towards the harmony of man” show the break of our solitude character's life being ripped through <b>the</b> <b>window</b> he will never cross.|$|R

Then there was some more {{shooting}} outside, and I <b>looked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> again. Ham Gossett, the town marshal, had a posse in the houses and stores across the street, {{and was trying to}} bag a Trimble or two through the windows.|$|E

All day the noise and the fog continued, and then at sunset the one ceased and the other cleared away.
