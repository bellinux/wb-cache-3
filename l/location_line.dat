40|$|This paper {{develops}} a two-dimensional spatial framework {{to explore the}} firms' optimal locations and optimal attributes of basic products under linear transportation costs, in which firms have the technique of flexible manufacturing and engage in spatially discriminatory pricing. We can observe {{in the real world}} that the technique of flexible manufacturing has been widely adopted by most major manufacturing industries. As indicated by Eaton and Schmitt (1994), the key feature of flexible manufacturing is economies of scope, which can be represented by the production of an array of differentiated products extended by a basic product using the same manufacturing process. The production of the basic product incurs a sunk cost of product development, whose feature can be described by a point on Hotelling's attribute line. This basic product can be modified to produce extended variant products by incurring additional costs. The additional cost of producing an extended variant product is denoted by a per-unit modification cost that is proportional to the distance of the attribute line between the attribute addresses of the basic product and the extended variant product. The game in question is a three-stage game. Firms simultaneously select their equilibrium locations in the first stage. Then, they simultaneously choose the optimal attributes of the basic products in the second stage. Finally, firms engage in spatially discriminatory pricing in the third stage. The main findings of the paper are as follows. First of all, we show that the two firms will agglomerate {{at the center of the}} <b>location</b> <b>line</b> and the optimal attributes of the two basic products will be located at the first and third quartiles of the attribute line, respectively, when the ratio of the marginal modification rate to the transport rate is high. Secondly, the two firms will locate separately on the <b>location</b> <b>line</b> and the optimal attributes of the two basic products will remain at the first and third quartiles when this ratio is moderate. Moreover, the two firms will locate at the first and third quartiles of the <b>location</b> <b>line,</b> respectively, and the optimal attributes of the basic products will agglomerate at the center of the attribute line when this ratio is low...|$|E

40|$|A program slice is {{a subset}} of a program. • Program slicing enables programmers to view subsets of a program by {{filtering}} out code that is not relevant to the computation of interest. • E. g., if a program computes many things, including the average {{of a set of}} numbers, slicing can be used to isolate the code that computes the average. Dependable Software Systems (Slicing) Why is Program Slicing Useful? • Program slices are more manageable for testing and debugging. • When testing, debugging, or understanding a program, most of the code in the program is irrelevant to what you are interested in. • Program slicing provides a convenient way of filtering out “irrelevant ” code. • Program slices can be computed automatically by statically analyzing the data and control flow of the program.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{attention}} on the phenomenal appearance of objects was investigated in the domains of color (hue), <b>location,</b> <b>line</b> orientation, and spatial frequency. Observers indicated {{the appearance of a}} briefly presented above-threshold stimulus by selecting a matching stimulus along a sensory continuum (e. g., color). Attention was manipulated with a dual task that involved letter identification. Attention had little effect in changing the way objects appeared in terms of observers ' mean response. However, in each stimulus domain, attention reduced the variability of responses. It is argued that attention should be viewed in terms of reducing uncertainty. Kurt Koffka (1935) suggested that the main question in the study of visual perception is, "Why do things look as they do? " Before answering the question of why the world appears as it does, one needs a description of how the world appears. In the study of visual attention, researchers are at a considerable disadvantage because they have little knowledge of how attention affects the appearance of objects. In the research reported here, we addressed this deficit by examining how attention would affect the appearance of objects. Does attention make objects appear more intense, brighter, longer, or more clear than they would otherwise appear? How does attention affect the perceived color, location, or orientation of objects? Nineteenth-century sensory physiologists and psychologists were concerned with the phenomenology of attention...|$|E
30|$|The ERTMS was {{introduced}} {{as a standard}} in order to replace and harmonize national railway control and signalling systems, which vary greatly {{from country to country}} [25]. There are three ETCS levels. Level 1 represents track to train communication, provided by Eurobalises located along tracks that interface with the existing signalling system and line side signals. Level 2 is an enhancement of Level 1 with movement authority from Radio Block Centre (RBC) through interlocking to on-board ECTS via GSM-R link, which enables the elimination of trackside signals. Level 2 covers track-to-train communication and vice versa. On this level, RBC calculates the correct movement authority, giving authorization to proceed (or not), with balises used to transmit static messages such as <b>location,</b> <b>line</b> profile, and speed limit. Further, Level 3 improves the ability of Level 2 so that train detection by the trackside is no longer required. At this level, the RBC uses GSM-R for transmission between track and train. Compared with Level 1 and 2 which are based on a fixed block signalling system, Level 3 allows a moving block signalling system; this means that as the train travels, the track receives the train location and train integrity from the train. Levels 1 and 2 are already widely applied in Europe, while Level 3 is currently under development [11, 110]. The ERTMS has been adopted in countries such as South Korea, Taiwan, Turkey, Algeria, Argentina, and New Zealand.|$|E

VIX {{can be thought of}} as a weighted average of implied volatilities for put/call options across a series of strikes. Volatility Skew/Smile phenomenon result from volatility expected discrepancies between various exercise prices. We adopt the trading time, but not the expiration time, as time axis in IVS construction, this is helpful to observe relative daily variations between VIX and volatility skew. On this volatility contour plane, we observe characteristics of "VIX location line" (i. e. zero value relative with daily VIX index) in various VIX levels, and find out its flow path is independent of VIX level, but relate to underlying index variation. We then define DLTvix as Black-Scholes Delta deviation between ATM and VIX <b>location</b> <b>line</b> projection component along Delta moneyness axis. We state that DLTvix can be considered as option participators'expectation on underlying index return over the next 30 calendar days. For the put (call) option, DLTvix is negative (positive); and the lower (higher) value of DLTvix, represents the less (more) expected return. We calculate DLTvix and RT 30 (index return over the next 30 calendar days) from 2006 / 12 / 01 to 2010 / 02 / 28, a total of 802 trading days. These results computed by OLS regression model show that, DLTvix have statistically significant predictive power on RT 30.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{in more detail}} a project applying VR as a planning tool for the redevelopment of landscape. The aim {{of the project was}} to visualize redevelopment projects of two sites of the company Wismut GmbH, a former mining company. Applying VR technology, both the actual and the planning state of the landscape can be visualized interactively. The visualization of the planning state includes also the several processes (e. g., leveling and deposit) which will be carried out through the redevelopment. With the VR Geo system the engineers of Wismut were able to plan these two redevelopment projects in a powerful manner. They visualized the various planning states and discussed them with decision-maker. Furthermore the results were presented to people who are living in this area. They got a first impression of how their region will look in future. This report describes not just another VR application. It describes the realization of a project which provides the customer with a sy stem to generate, to change, and to present a landscape in different states. In fact the most difficult problem was to generate, i. e. to model, the landscape based upon the different kind of original data: hard copies of 2 D maps, a lot of textual information, color photos and some digital data (3 D point and line data of the dumps, grey scale aerial photo of the landscape). All the remaining has been modeled during the project: topology of the landscapes, streets, trees, bushes, buildings, dumps, railway tracks, fences, pits, churches, a <b>location</b> <b>line</b> for the trucks to level one dump, etc. The next difficulty was the different kind of user requirements. The system should be integrated into the daily work to support the engineers in planning redevelopment projects. Furthermore the redevelopment projects should be presented using a high end and a low end VR environment: high end VR workstation, VR interaction devices, stereo large screen projection, low end graphics workstation. Third, th e system should be able to produce on demand videos and color images based on the requirements of the customer. And fourth, the system should be open for future extensions. To sum up the VR Geo system enables the engineers of Wismut to visualize redevelopment projects in a scalable manner: snapshots of the planned landscape as color images, videos of a flight through the landscape, interim results for discussion on a low end workstation, and a highly immersive presentation using a high end VIZ system. All alternatives have been applied during the project described within this paper...|$|E
