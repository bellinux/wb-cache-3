While Verne Lundquist replaced Summerall on games with <b>lead</b> <b>analyst</b> John Madden, Buck (who was at the time the network's lead Major League Baseball announcer) filled in for Lundquist, teaming with Dan Fouts to call two games (both of which coincidentally featured the Cardinals, who had moved from St. Louis to Arizona by that time).|$|E

2500|$|After {{two years}} of calling {{baseball}} telecasts for CBS, Jack Buck was dismissed in December 1991. According to the radio veteran Buck, he {{had a hard time}} adjusting to the demands of a more constricting television production. CBS felt that Buck should have done more to make himself appear to be a set-up man for <b>lead</b> <b>analyst</b> Tim McCarver. Jack Buck's son Joe tried to rationalize his father's on-air problems by saying [...] "My dad was brought up in the golden age of radio, I think he had his hands tied somewhat, being accustomed to the freedom of radio. I'm more used to acquiescing to what the producer wants to do, what the director wants to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{two years}} of calling {{baseball}} telecasts (including the Saturday afternoon Game of the Week, All-Star Game, National League Championship Series, and World Series), Buck was dismissed by CBS. The official reasoning behind Buck's ouster was that he simply had poor chemistry with <b>lead</b> <b>analyst</b> Tim McCarver. Buck was soon replaced by Boston Red Sox announcer Sean McDonough. Buck later noted that [...] "CBS never got that baseball play-by-play draws word-pictures. All they knew was that football stars analysts. So they said, 'Let McCarver run the show ... In television, all {{they want you to}} do is shut up. I'm not very good at shutting up." [...] Buck was criticized by some for his alleged habit of predicting plays on air.|$|E
2500|$|... 1997 was {{the last}} time Marv Albert would call the NBA Finals for NBC during the decade, as an {{embarrassing}} sex scandal forced NBC to fire Albert {{before the start of the}} 1997–1998 season. To replace Albert, NBC tapped studio host Bob Costas for play-by-play. Matt Guokas did not return to his post as main color commentator, and was replaced by NBA legend Isiah Thomas; Costas was replaced on the pre-game show by Hannah Storm. Midway through the season, Costas and Thomas were joined by recently fired Detroit Pistons coach Doug Collins. Collins served to take some weight off Thomas, who was considered by some to be uncomfortable in the role of <b>lead</b> <b>analyst.</b> Thomas, in particular, was singled out for his soft voice and often stammered analysis.|$|E

2500|$|On 3 October 2006, it was {{announced}} that Faldo had signed a contract with CBS to replace Lanny Wadkins as the network's lead golf analyst. Faldo said, [...] "I view this as a fabulous opportunity for me, which may come once every 10 years. But it will seriously curtail my playing career. My playing days aren't completely over but my priority now is given to CBS." [...] Faldo's decision meant he missed the 2007 Masters, an event he had won three times. In 2007 he also became the <b>lead</b> <b>analyst</b> for Golf Channel's coverage on the PGA Tour. [...] Faldo has garnered less positive support since he began working on his own. [...] He and Azinger did have a pair of reunion telecasts, one for each of the analysts' employers. Faldo joined Azinger and Tirico on ABC for the 2007 Open Championship. [...] Meanwhile, Azinger joined Faldo and Brian Hammons on Golf Channel for the 2009 Presidents Cup.|$|E
2500|$|Ritter {{was born}} into a {{military}} family in 1961 in Gainesville, Florida. He graduated from Kaiserslautern American High School in 1979, and later from Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, with a Bachelor of Arts {{in the history of the}} Soviet Union and departmental honors. In 1980 he served in the U.S. Army as a private. Then in May 1984 he was commissioned as an intelligence officer in the United States Marine Corps. He served in this capacity for about 12 years. He served as the <b>lead</b> <b>analyst</b> for the Marine Corps Rapid Deployment Force concerning the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the Iran–Iraq War. Ritter's academic work focused on the Basmachi resistance movement in Soviet Central Asia during the 1920s and 1930s, and on the Basmachi commanders Fazail Maksum and Ibrahim Bek. During Desert Storm, he served as a ballistic missile advisor to General Norman Schwarzkopf. Ritter later worked as a security and military consultant for the Fox News network. [...] Ritter also had [...] "a long relationship [...] of an official nature" [...] with the UK's foreign intelligence spy agency MI6 according to an interview he gave to Democracy Now! in 2003.|$|E
2500|$|In 1994, Jim Kaat was the <b>lead</b> <b>analyst</b> on Baseball Tonight for ESPN's {{coverage}} of Major League Baseball. In 1995, {{he was nominated}} for a New York Emmy Award for [...] "On Camera Achievement." [...] Also in , Kaat called the American League playoffs with Brent Musburger for ABC/The Baseball Network including the Yankees–Seattle Mariners Division Series. He served his second stint as an announcer for Yankees games on the MSG Network/YES Network (–), where his straight-shooting style was much in the mode of former Yankees broadcasters Tony Kubek and Bill White. Towards the end of his second stint with the Yankees, his workload decreased. In 2006, he only broadcast 65 games. Despite his decreased work load, Kaat won another Emmy for on-air achievement in 2006. In an on-air broadcast on September 10, [...] with booth partner Ken Singleton, Kaat acknowledged his plan to end his broadcasting career. His final appearance in the booth was to be a Yankee–Red Sox game on September 15, 2006 (Kaat was also set to throw out the first pitch). However, the game was postponed due to rain. Kaat later announced {{that he was going to}} record a special farewell message to the fans, but would not return for any additional broadcasts. However, the following day, Kaat did announce one full inning of the first game of Saturday September 16's doubleheader on Fox along with Tim McCarver and Josh Lewin. During that Fox telecast he was able to say goodbye to the Yankee fans, an opportunity that the previous night's rainout had deprived him of doing on the YES Network. In , Kaat joined the recently launched MLB Network as a color commentator for their Thursday Night Baseball series. Kaat also writes a weekly on-line blog for the Yankees (YES) Network, Kaat's Korner, and contributes video blogs and interviews regularly with national and international media outlets. One of the reasons he got back into regular broadcasting was because after his wife died, Tim McCarver and Elizabeth Schumacher, his friend and business manager, urged him to get back into the game. He also called Pool D in Puerto Rico for the 2009 World Baseball Classic games for an international feed.|$|E
