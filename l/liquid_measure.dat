Public response included resistance, apathy, and sometimes ridicule. The underlying {{reasons for this}} response include a relative uniformity of weights and measures (though, notably, US <b>liquid</b> <b>measure</b> differed by about 20% from British Imperial measure, which was adopted throughout the British Empire in 1824) inherited from the United Kingdom in 1776, a homogeneous economy {{and the influence of}} business groups and populists in Congress caused the country to look at the short-term costs associated with the change-over, particularly those that would be borne by the consumer rather than long-term benefits of efficiency and international trade. The Metrication Board was disbanded under President Ronald Reagan's direction in 1982.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a <b>liquid</b> <b>measuring</b> instrumentation using the popular tetrapolar electrode configuration. The system consists of four-electrode ring shape using Cromium metal plate and a small measurement. The developed instrument is calibrated with the help of prepared saline solution prepared in lab. A liquid of known parameter is placed inside the measurement cell and current is injected through excitation electrode with certain frequency and voltage drop is measured across electrode potential terminals. From this voltages and cell constant value, the conductivity, resistivity and impedance of the <b>measured</b> <b>liquid</b> could be determined with acceptable accuracy with more than 96 % compared to the standard measurement.
