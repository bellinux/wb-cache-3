30|$|Although innate immune {{responses}} {{provide one}} <b>of</b> the first <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>defense</b> <b>against</b> viral infection (Schneider et al., 2014), uncontrolled immune activation could {{be harmful to}} the host (Yap and Lai, 2010); the IFN signaling needs to be tightly controlled.

For example, several components in the RLR pathway are IFN responsive, such as RIG-I, IRF 3 and IRF 7 (Schneider et al., 2014; Schoggins et al., 2011). The induction of these proteins in turn reinforces IFN production. The expression of some TRIM proteins, such as TRIM 13 and TRIM 25, is up-regulated by type I IFNs (Rajsbaum et al., 2008).

40|$|AbstractInnate cell-autonomous {{antiviral}} {{responses are}} essential first <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>defense</b> <b>against</b> {{central nervous system}} infections but may also contribute to neuropathogenesis. We investigated the relationships between innate immunity and neuronal differentiation using an in vitro culture system with human cell lines to analyze cellular responses to the neurotropic alphavirus western equine encephalitis virus. Human neuronal cells displayed a maturation-dependent reduction in virus-induced cytopathology that was independent of autocrine interferon α or β activity. In addition, maturation was associated with enhanced responsiveness to exogenous stimuli, such that differentiated neurons required five- to ten-fold less type I interferon to suppress viral replication or virus-induced cytopathology compared to immature cells, although this enhanced responsiveness extended to only a subset of unique type I interferons. These results demonstrate that maturation-dependent changes in human neuronal cells may be key determinants in the innate immune response to infections with neurotropic alphaviruses...|$|R
