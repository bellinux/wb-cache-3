5|$|A {{monument}} to Ion Heliade Rădulescu, sculpted by the Italian artist Ettore Ferrari, {{stands in front}} of the University building in central Bucharest. In addition to naming a <b>lecture</b> <b>room</b> after him, the Romanian Academy has instituted the Ion Heliade Rădulescu Award—in 1880, it was awarded to Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, for his Cuvinte den bătrâni, and worth 5,000 gold lei. Ten years after, the prize was the center of a scandal, involving on one side the dramatist Ion Luca Caragiale and, on the other, the cultural establishment formed around members of the National Liberal Party, including Hasdeu and Dimitrie Sturdza. The latter disapproved of Caragiale's anti-Liberal stance and his association with Junimea, as well as to his anti-nationalism, dislike of didacticism, and alleged cosmopolitanism. They thus refused to grant him the prize.|$|E
5|$|In early 1971, Deacon was {{introduced}} to Taylor and May by a friend at a disco who told him {{that they were in}} a band that had just lost its bassist. A couple of days later he auditioned in a <b>lecture</b> <b>room</b> at Imperial College London and became the last member of Queen to join. Since the band's last bassist drew attention away from Mercury, Deacon was selected for his musical talent, his quiet demeanour and his electrical skills. A persistent legend claims Deacon was the seventh bassist auditioned, but more recent sources show Queen's bassists were, in order: Mike Grose, Barry Mitchell, Doug Bogie and Deacon. Deacon played his first show with Queen at the College of Estate Management in Kensington in June.|$|E
5|$|Outside the <b>lecture</b> <b>room</b> {{before the}} {{students}} arrived, according to testimony Starling and others gave in court, Starling cut the dog open again {{to inspect the}} results of the previous surgery, which took about 45 minutes, after which he clamped the wound with forceps and handed the dog over to Bayliss. Bayliss cut a new opening in the dog's neck to expose the lingual nerves of the salivary glands, to which he attached electrodes. The aim was to stimulate the nerves with electricity to demonstrate that salivary pressure was independent of blood pressure. The dog was then carried to the lecture theatre, stretched on his back on an operating board, with his legs tied to the board, his head clamped and his mouth muzzled.|$|E

25|$|The {{university}} was temporarily {{based in the}} city. A lecture theatre and the university's first Junior Common Room were based in Centenary Church, a former Congregational church beside the old factory premises of Waring & Gillow, which were used to accommodate the new students. Many new students were housed in Morecambe. The Grand Theatre was leased as a main <b>lecture</b> <b>room</b> and 112 and 114 in the St Leonard's Gate area became teaching and recreational rooms. The library occupied the old workshops of Shrigley and Hunt on Castle Hill.|$|E
25|$|Rev. Meredith also spearheaded {{building}} a <b>Lecture</b> <b>Room</b> for Sunday school classes (finished 1872, {{and the host}} of the diocesan council the following year). The parish's women also conducted many fundraising dinners and other drives to balance the parish books, as well as led efforts to establish a Confederate cemetery (the Stonewall Cemetery section at Mt. Hebron). Also another former Confederate chaplain, Rev. James Avirrett (the son-in-law of vestryman Philip Williams) began a girls' school, Dunbar Seminary, in Winchester, which he ran from 1864 until accepting a transfer to the Diocese of Maryland in 1870.|$|E

25|$|The Frick Auditorium is {{a lecture}} hall in room 324 of the Cathedral of Learning. Originally {{conceptualized}} as the Fine Arts <b>Lecture</b> <b>Room</b> intended {{to complement the}} Fine Arts Department then located on the seventh floor, the room was completed in 1939 and features stone mullions, chambranle, and other trim as well as wooden lecture seating and a coffered ceiling. A centerpiece element {{in the room is}} a Nicholas Lochoff reproduction of The Resurrection by Piero della Francesca that was purchased for the lecture hall by Helen Clay Frick. Frick would later donate a large collection of Lochoff reproductions to the university which are on display in the Nicholas Lochoff Cloisture in the university's Frick Fine Arts Building.|$|E
25|$|Professor Jan Pieter Minckeleers lit his <b>lecture</b> <b>room</b> at the University of Louvain in 1783 and Lord Dundonald lit {{his house}} at Culross, Scotland, in 1787, the gas being carried in sealed vessels {{from the local}} tar works. In France, Philippe le Bon {{patented}} a gas fire in 1799 and demonstrated street lighting in 1801. Other demonstrations followed in France and in the United States, but, it is generally recognized that the first commercial gas works was built by the London and Westminster Gas Light and Coke Company in Great Peter Street in 1812 laying wooden pipes to illuminate Westminster Bridge with gas lights on New Year's Eve in 1813. In 1816, Rembrandt Peale and four others established the Gas Light Company of Baltimore, the first manufactured gas company in America. In 1821, natural gas was being used commercially in Fredonia, New York. The first German gas works was built in Hannover in 1825 and by 1870 there were 340 gas works in Germany making town gas from coal, wood, peat and other materials.|$|E
25|$|Robert Quigley King came to {{a largely}} undeveloped Springfield at age nine in 1840, with his sister, Mary Elizabeth, age three and his brother, David Jr. age one. He {{attended}} the early Springfield schools. He later recalled hunting for squirrels in a woods that later became the train station (now demolished) {{and what would be}} close to the location of the present Clark County Library. His father died when he was eighteen. Nonetheless, his mother was able to send him and, as they arrived at college age, his brothers to Wittenberg College. At one time, she had them all in college at the same time—and Almena could afford that. When Robert Quigley King first started at Wittenberg, it held classes in the <b>lecture</b> <b>room</b> of the First Lutheran Church. However, while he was a student, Wittenberg moved to what is now the western part of its present-day campus. He was in the first class to graduate from Wittenberg. The history of early Springfield mentions how much he liked to hunt, especially in the woods that later became today's Snyder Park, which would have been just down Buck Creek from his childhood home at the King Homestead.|$|E

500|$|They {{attended}} 100 {{lectures and}} demonstrations at King's and University College, including 50 experiments on live animals, of which 20 were what Mason called [...] "full-scale vivisection". They kept a diary, calling it Eye-Witnesses and later The Shambles of Science: Extracts from the Diary of Two Students of Physiology (shambles was {{a name for}} a slaughterhouse). The women were present when the brown dog was vivisected, and wrote a chapter about it entitled [...] "Fun", referring to the laughter they said they heard in the <b>lecture</b> <b>room</b> during the procedure.|$|E
500|$|The first floor, partly {{covered by}} a paved plaza above, housed the reactor, laboratory, crystal spectrometer, a {{counting}} room with a nuclear densometer, classrooms, restrooms and offices. The second floor contained the control room and an observatory and <b>lecture</b> <b>room</b> overlooking the reactor, and was open to the outside plaza on three sides. The reactor {{was placed on the}} lower side of the building, downhill of the plaza, to allow the ground to absorb accidental radiation leaks. The roof rested on a series of perpendicular beams that also supported the weight of a 3-ton ( [...] kg) crane used to lift the reactor shield.|$|E
500|$|The {{chapters}} {{are written}} {{so that they}} could be read as lectures. Though several reviewers referred to them as essays, Gopnik made the distinction between an essay, which is written to be read silently, and a lecture, which is meant to be spoken and keeps some of the rhythm of speech. Gopnik purposefully tried [...] "to keep them as conversational as possible [...] they lack the polish of his New Yorker essays". The lectures' conversational tone, with both common and arcane references, was meant to appeal to a [...] "middlebrow" [...] audience; they were designed to be [...] "profound and significant" [...] but not academic. The reviewer in The Observer described the writing as [...] "designed to maintain a constant flame of curiosity in a <b>lecture</b> <b>room</b> shut against the cold".|$|E
