40|$|This report, {{which is}} a {{continuation}} of the "Preliminary report on free flight testing" (report no. NACA-TR- 70), presents a detailed theoretical analysis of statical stability with free and <b>locked</b> <b>controls</b> and also the results of many free flight test on several types of airplanes. In developing the theory of stability with <b>locked</b> <b>controls</b> an expression for pitching moment is derived in simple terms by considering the total moment as the sum of the moments due to wings and tail surface. This expression, when differentiated with respect to angle of incidence, enables an analysis to be made of the factors contributing to the pitching moment. The effects of slipstream and down wash are also considered and it is concluded that the C. G. Location has but slight effect or stability, and that stability is much improved by increasing the efficiency of the tail surfaces, which may be done by using an "inverted" tail plane. The results of free flight tests with <b>locked</b> <b>controls</b> are discussed at length and it is shown that the agreement between the experimental results and theory is very satisfactory. The theory of stability with free controls is not amendable to the simple mathematical treatment used in the case of <b>locked</b> <b>controls,</b> but a clear statement of the conditions enables several conclusions to be drawn, one of which is that the fixed tail surfaces should be much larger than the movable surfaces...|$|R

50|$|The simulation/ACM {{connection}} protocol provides {{services for}} managing the connection between a simulation and its ACM and a method of information exchange between a simulation and its ACM. Two services control distribution of simulation protocol messages: events and dispatches. Event messages are time-stamped and delivered in a temporally-consistent order. Dispatch messages are delivered as soon as possible, without regard for simulation time. Additional protocol messages provide connection state, filter registration, attribute <b>lock</b> <b>control,</b> confederation save control, object resource control, and time control services.|$|E
50|$|The lock is {{typically}} engaged via a small {{switch on the}} edge of the door that is only accessible when the door is open. Some cars implement the child <b>lock</b> <b>control</b> as a rotary mechanism which can only be operated with a key. This design ensures the child lock remains in its intended state, it is invaluable for older children or adults that may tamper with the lock when the door is open. Once the door is closed, control of these two mechanical type child locks is completely inaccessible to the passenger. In some newer models the child lock can be activated electronically from the driver position via a Door control unit, (Volvo V40 owners manual).|$|E

50|$|The {{advent of}} fleet cards {{can be traced}} back to the 1960s and 70s when key stops/key locks and stand alone card locks were used by {{independent}} marketers and filling station owners. A Key Stop or Key Lock fuel control system was a system where a group of commercial fleets could access a fuel pump with a unique key that tracked solely their gallons through that pump. This technology is obsolete and no longer available commercially. A card <b>lock</b> <b>control</b> system uses a punch card or magnetic stripe card to uniquely identify a fuel buyer on a private server. This was done to avoid a credit card interchange fee which raised the cost of fuel considerably. The first commercial fuel cards resembled a credit card with a name and a company logo on them. When a customer entered a fueling station, the cashier would take down the customer’s name and company information to authenticate ownership of the card. This process was time consuming and was vulnerable to fraudulent transactions. With the advent of computers and computer software in the 1980s, the development of the fleet card industry quickly expanded. The invention of the magnetic stripe and magnetic card reader allowed petroleum marketers to control fuel pump transactions, leading to today’s wide range of fleet card security features and state of the art reporting systems to track all fleet expenses. These “intelligent” systems make fleet management convenient and secure, as fleet card owners are able to track fleet fuel use with increased accuracy, receiving reports in real time on the fueling habits. Business owners are able to limit employee fueling by time-of-day and day-of-week.|$|E

In addition to such advantages, high stabilization {{is also important}} for application of the gyrotrons to spectroscopy. Up to the present, we have succeeded in phase <b>lock</b> <b>control</b> in a short tome for high stabilization of frequency.

40|$|Abstract—Many shared-memory {{parallel}} systems use lockbased synchronization {{mechanisms to}} provide mutual exclusion or reader-writer access to memory locations. Software locks are inefficient either in memory usage, lock transfer time, or both. Proposed hardware locking mechanisms are either too specific (for example, requiring static assignment of threads to cores and vice-versa), support {{a limited number}} of concurrent locks, require tag values to be associated with every memory location, rely on the low latencies of single-chip multicore designs or are slow in adversarial cases such as suspended threads in a lock queue. Additionally, few proposals cover reader-writer locks and their associated fairness issues. In this paper we introduce the <b>Lock</b> <b>Control</b> Unit (LCU) which is an acceleration mechanism collocated with each core to explicitly handle fast reader-writer locking. By associating a unique thread-id to each lock request we decouple the hardware lock from the requestor core. This provides correct and efficient execution in the presence of thread migration. By making the LCU logic autonomous from the core, it seamlessly handles thread preemption. Our design offers richer semantics than previous proposals, such as trylock support while providing direct core-to-core transfers. We evaluate our proposal with microbenchmarks, a finegrain Software Transactional Memory system and programs from the Parsec and Splash parallel benchmark suites. The lock transfer time decreases in up to 30 % when compared to previous hardware proposals. Transactional Memory systems limited by reader-locking congestion boost up to 3 × while still preserving graceful fairness and starvation freedom properties. Finally, commonly used applications achieve speedups up to a 7 % when compared to software models. Keywords-reader-writer locks; fairness; <b>Lock</b> <b>Control</b> Unit; I...|$|E
40|$|Physical keys {{made from}} metal or woods {{have been used}} for centuries to operate locks. The {{routines}} for operating a lock did not change significantly by the time. Keys have been carried, stored, lost, searched, lent, and copied. The main intent of locking is making sure that the belongings are kept safe. Hence, security has always been main consideration. Although mechanical <b>Lock</b> Access <b>Control</b> Systems are easy and cost effective to implement, they are insecure and expensive to maintain. Traditional Digital <b>Lock</b> Access <b>Control</b> systems may decrease the problems of mechanical <b>lock</b> access <b>control</b> systems. However, they are still vulnerable to attacks and the costs are usually high. Smart <b>Lock</b> Access <b>Control</b> Systems decrease the security risks and costs caused by fetching, storing, and carrying the physical keys. They also enable distribution of access rights and monitoring activities online. Smart lock solutions are cost effective to implement since they use existing wireless Internet structure (such as home WiFi) and electric locks. A typical Smart <b>Lock</b> Access <b>Control</b> System includes three components: a lock controller which is a microcontroller for operating the electric lock, cloud servers for granting access to the users and monitor activities, and finally a mobile phone which is used as a gateway between the cloud servers and lock controller. This thesis work designs and implements an Android Library for smart phones which will be included in mobile applications to communicate with the lock controller and cloud servers of the system...|$|R
