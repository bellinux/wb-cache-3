40|$|To {{estimate}} the durability {{and reliability of}} a structural component its design <b>loading</b> <b>spectrum</b> must be defined. This spectrum is obtained by combining the <b>loading</b> <b>spectra</b> that correspond to all possible operating conditions.

In this paper, we present a new approach that makes itpossible to empirically model the relationship between the factors of the operating conditions and the corresponding <b>loading</b> <b>spectra.</b> This approach is based on a localised basis function neural network, and we have applied it on simulated and measured load states.

40|$|The {{durability}} {{and reliability of}} a structural component are usually estimated {{on the basis of}} its design <b>loading</b> <b>spectrum,</b> which is a combination of the <b>loading</b> <b>spectra</b> that correspond to various operating conditions. However, if some of the <b>loading</b> <b>spectra</b> that should be used to build the design <b>loading</b> <b>spectrum</b> were not measured, because of cost and time limitations, they must be determined in another way. In order to predict the missing <b>loading</b> <b>spectra</b> a relationship between the operating conditions and the corresponding <b>loading</b> <b>spectra</b> must be known. We showed previously that it is possible to estimate this relationship using a localised basis function neural network. However, with the localised basis function neural network only discrete <b>loading</b> <b>spectra</b> can be predicted and an extrapolation outside the domain of the known operating conditions is impossible. To avoid these problems we have developed a new approach for predicting the <b>loading</b> <b>spectra.</b> It is based on a combined multilayer perceptron neural network. This new approach enables the prediction of smoothed <b>loading</b> <b>spectra</b> and does not impose any restrictions on their extrapolation. In this paper we present the theoretical background to this new approach and then apply it to examples of simulated and measured load states...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} perform a fatigue-life {{analysis}} of structures {{the parameters of the}} structure <b>loading</b> <b>spectra</b> must be assessed. If the load time series are counted using a two-parametric rainflow counting method, the structure <b>loading</b> <b>spectrum</b> provides a probability for the occurrence of a load-cycle with certain amplitude and mean values. It is beneficial for the prediction of the fatigue life to describe the <b>loading</b> <b>spectrum</b> by a continuous function. We have previously discovered that mixtures of Gaussian probability density functions can be used to model the <b>loading</b> <b>spectra.</b> The main problems of this approach that have not been satisfactorily resolved before are related to the estimation of the number of components in the applied mixture models, and to the modelling of the load-cycle distributions with relatively fat tails. In this article, we describe a method for estimating the parameters of mixture models, which allows automatic determination of the number of components in a mixture model. The presented method is applied for modelling simulated and measured <b>loading</b> <b>spectra</b> using mixtures of the multivariate Gaussian or t probability density functions.

40|$|An {{important}} issue in researching the smart rotor concept is the <b>load</b> <b>spectrum</b> under investigation. In {{order to obtain}} a representative <b>load</b> <b>spectrum</b> in experiments on a small rotor, blades are designed of which the dynamic behaviour is scaled {{with respect to the}} rated rotational frequency. The blade design is also analyzed for stiffness, laminate strength and skin wrinkling because the design is fairly critical. The blade dynamics are analyzed using modal analysis. Subsequently a series of blades is fabricated. The stiffness and dynamic results of the model are verified in experiments. Macro Fiber Composites (MFC) sensors are selected as the main strain sensor on which feedback control is based. The placement of the sensors is determined by performing a harmonic analysis. The blades are mounted to a small turbine in the Delft University of Technology’s Open Jet Facility (OJF) wind tunnel. The resonance peak associated with the first flapping mode lies exactly on the target 24 Hz. Controllers are designed based on a measured state space model.

These data are used to construct a Goodman diagram that is suitable for analyzing wind turbine blades. This result is compared to the Goodman diagram derived from the European fatigue data base FACT [DeSmet and Bach, 1994].
