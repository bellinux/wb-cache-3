However, the <b>law</b> <b>governing</b> <b>enforcement</b> and remedies is now subject to the Enforcement Directive (2004 / 48) with an account of profits falling under Article 13.

40|$|<b>Law</b> <b>governing</b> <b>enforcement</b> of ADR {{agreement}} not {{governed by}} the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) has been uncertain, and often aimless. This Article therefore calls for clarification of this law, through development of a modern contractual approach for enforcing these non-FAA ADR procedures. Although courts may look to the FAA {{as a resource for}} evaluating and developing an enforcement approach, they also should employ modern contract and remedy tools that are more adaptive than the Act 2 ̆ 7 s summary enforcement because it allow courts to consider contextual, relational, and equitable factors when determining application of specific enforcement remedies. This allows courts to apply these tools to foster contract compliance and cooperative relations, but to protect individuals from coerced participation in ADR that will cause undue financial or emotional hardship, or otherwise defeat the very purposes of ADR...|$|E

50|$|The second {{consideration}} is how <b>laws</b> <b>governing</b> contract <b>enforcement,</b> enticement, emigrant agents, vagrancy, convict leasing, and debt peonage function to immobilize labor and restrict competition {{in a system}} where agriculture was the dominant consumer of labor. The South was overwhelmingly based on agricultural production through the postbellum years, only seeing substantial increases in industrial manufacturing starting in the 1930s; and, {{for those who did}} not own farmland, the dominant forms of employment were: farm laborer, sharecropper, share-renter, and fixed renter. Throughout this period there were some large landholders that used a set wage for farm laborers; however, the general lack of banks in the South made this arrangement problematic (Parker 1980:1024-1025).|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} several decades, states have used {{international}} asset freezes with increasing frequency as a mechanism for promoting human rights abroad. Yet the international <b>law</b> <b>governing</b> this mechanism, which I refer to as ‘humanitarian financial intervention’, remains fragmented. This article offers the first systematic legal analysis of humanitarian financial intervention. It identifies six humanitarian purposes that states may pursue through asset freezes: preserving foreign assets from misappropriation, incapacitating foreign states or foreign nationals, coercing foreign states or foreign nationals to forsake abusive practices, compensating victims, ameliorating humanitarian crises through humanitarian aid or postconflict reconstruction, and punishing human rights violators. Whether intervening states may pursue these objectives in any given context depends upon the interplay between several international legal regimes, including international investment law, collective-security agreements such as the UN Charter, the customary law of countermeasures, the law of armed conflict, and customary <b>law</b> <b>governing</b> the <b>enforcement</b> of judicial decisions. By disentangling the various international legal regimes that govern humanitarian financial intervention, this article furnishes a preliminary road map for evaluating the legality of past, present, and future financial interventions – including asset freezes directed against the Qaddafi regime during the 2011 Libyan Revolution...|$|R
50|$|The void for vagueness {{doctrine}} is a constitutional rule. This rule requires that criminal laws are so written that they explicitly and definitely state what conduct is punishable. The void for vagueness doctrine thus serves two purposes. First: All persons receive a fair notice {{of what is}} punishable and what is not. Second: The vagueness doctrine helps prevent arbitrary enforcement of the laws and arbitrary prosecutions. There is however no limit to the conduct that can be criminalized, when the legislature does not set minimum guidelines to <b>govern</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{both the}} European Union (EU) and the United States (US), the <b>law</b> <b>governing</b> the <b>enforcement</b> of foreign {{judgments}} is evolving, but in different directions. EU law, {{especially after the}} elimination of exequatur by the 2012 ’Recast’ of the Brussels I Regulation, increasingly facilitates enforcement in member states of judgments of other member states’ courts, reflecting growing faith in a multilateral private international law approach to foreign judgments. In US law, on the other hand, increasingly widespread adoption of state legislation based on the 2005 Uniform ForeignCountry Money Judgments Recognition Act (2005 Act), which adds new case-specific grounds for refusing enforcement, suggests growing scepticism. In this essay, I explore possible reasons for these diverging trends. I begin with the most obvious explanation: the Brussels framework governs the effect of internal EU member state judgments within the EU, whereas the 2005 Act governs the effect of external foreign country judgments within the US. One would expect more mutual trust – and thus more faith in foreign judgment enforcement – internally than externally. But I argue that this mutual trust explanation is only partially satisfactory. I therefore sketch out two other possible explanations. One is that the different trends in EU and US law {{are a result of}} an emphasis on ’governance values’ in EU law and an emphasis on ’rights values’ in US law. Another explanation – and perhaps the most fundamental one – is that these trends are ultimately traceable to politics...|$|R
40|$|According to {{the article}} 56 of the Romanian Criminal Code, “life imprisonment” {{is defined as the}} {{deprivation}} of liberty for an unlimited period of time and is executed according to the <b>Law</b> that <b>governs</b> the <b>enforcement</b> of punishments In the event that the national legislation allows for a re-examination of the life imprisonment sentence of a convict to a jail time or to allow for a parole, we believe that the requirements of the European Convention of Human Rights are fulfilled. (case Trabelsi vs. Belgium, Decision from 4 th of September 2014). With respect to the enforcement of the life imprisonment sentence, in a few European countries there are particular previsions by the Law (Croatia, Norway, Slovenia), but in Portugal it’s banned by the Constitution; in Belgium, the life imprisonment sentence is defined as a sanction {{for the rest of the}} life, while in Cyprus there is no option for parole since the Law doesn’t allow it, but it can be affected only by presidential pardon...|$|R
50|$|Cold Blue Steel (Texas Review Press, 2013) is a {{collection}} of poems reflecting on law enforcement thirteen years after How to Undress a Cop. She “employs frank language in sharp lyrics charged with weary passion”, says Diego Báez in Booklist. According to reviewer Jeffrey C. Alfier in Rattle: “Cortez’s lines were formed in the cauldron of an American Realist tradition: hard truths told with sharp fidelity by a large city beat cop.” This book, according to reviewer Paul David Adkins says: “Ms. Cortez explores {{what it means to be}} female in the traditionally man’s world of <b>law</b> <b>enforcement,</b> <b>governed</b> by violence, cynicism, and despair.” One of the poems in this book won an honorable mention in Rattle’s annual contest in 2011, and the book placed finalist in the 2014 Writers League of Texas Poetry Awards and the 2015 PEN Southwest Book Award in Poetry.|$|R
5000|$|The {{only issue}} arose {{with respect to}} the first element, and the meaning of the {{undefined}} term [...] "unauthorized access". Wu noted the government's concession that its only basis for claiming that Drew had intentionally accessed Myspace's computers without authorization was the creation of the false [...] "Josh Evans" [...] alias in violation of the MySpace Terms of Service. Wu reasoned that, if a conscious violation of the Terms of Service was not sufficient to satisfy the first element, Drew's motion for acquittal would have to be granted for that reason alone. Wu found that an intentional breach of the Myspace Terms of Service could possibly satisfy the definition of an unauthorized access or access exceeding authorization, but that rooting a CFAA misdemeanor violation in an individual's conscious violation of a website's Terms of Service would render the statute void for vagueness because there were insufficient guidelines to <b>govern</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> as well as a lack of actual notice to the public.|$|R
40|$|The {{enforceability}} {{of mandatory}} arbitration policies contained in employment contracts between employees and their direct employers {{remains an open}} question, even after the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s 1991 decision in Gilmer v. Interstate Johnson Lane Corp. While Gilmer gave effect to a mandatory arbitration clause in a contract between a securities broker and his licensing exchange, the Court noted that the contract at issue was not an ordinary employment contract between employer and employee. The Court declined to decide whether arbitration agreements in ordinary employment contracts are per se enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act or whether these provisions are exempt from the Act and therefore subject to closer judicial scrutiny. Sharona Hoffman argues that arbitration provisions in ordinary employment contracts are {{beyond the scope of}} the Federal Arbitration Act, a conclusion consistent with the approach of the majority of courts of appeal which have considered this issue. To demonstrate the continuing development of the <b>law</b> <b>governing</b> the <b>enforcement</b> of mandatory arbitration policies, the author details a recent case in which the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission challenged and successfully enjoined enforcement of a mandatory arbitration policy. The arbitration policy was vulnerable to attack because its provisions so clearly favored the employer and because pre-existing employees were forced to choose between keeping their jobs or prospectively agreeing to arbitrate nearly all disputes {{under the terms of the}} employer 2 ̆ 7 s arbitration policy. Hoffman concludes that while voluntary alternative dispute resolution schemes are enforceable, mandatory arbitration policies unilaterally imposed by employers upon employees may be voidable under both statutory law and the common law of contracts...|$|R
40|$|In 1993, {{residents}} of the Lago Agrio region of the Ecuadorian Amazon sued Texaco, Inc. alleging extensive environmental damage and personal injuries caused by Texaco’s oil extraction operations there. The U. S. District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissed the suit on forum non conveniens grounds {{in favor of the}} courts of Ecuador, and the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed in 2002. Meanwhile, Chevron Corp. had acquired Texaco in 2001. After the forum non conveniens dismissal, the Lago Agrio plaintiffs sued Chevron in an Ecuadorian court, which entered a $ 17. 2 billion judgment against Chevron. Since then, the parties have been engaged in an extensive litigation and public relations battle over the enforcement of the judgment, a battle that has reached beyond the United States and Ecuador to countries including Argentina, Brazil and Canada. Although the Chevron-Ecuador case raises many interesting legal issues, this Essay sounds a note of caution about the lessons of the case for transnational litigation. On the one hand, as Part One argues, the case usefully highlights two important transnational litigation trends: the growing multipolarity of transnational litigation and the increasing interaction between the transnational litigation system and other international legal sub-systems. On the other hand, as Part Two argues, the lessons of the Chevron-Ecuador case for law reform are, and should be, limited. Judges, scholars and policymakers may understandably feel pressure to push the law in a particular direction in order to address perceived imperatives that are specific to the Chevron-Ecuador case. But this would risk bypassing the careful evidence-based deliberation needed for sound law reform. The Essay illustrates this risk using examples from the <b>law</b> <b>governing</b> the <b>enforcement</b> of foreign country judgments. The overarching argument is this: Judges, policymakers and scholars should use caution to avoid unduly “Chevronizing” the law of transnational litigation...|$|R
2500|$|One of {{the major}} reasons put forth for the {{consolidation}} {{of the city was}} the county's inability to <b>govern.</b> <b>Law</b> <b>enforcement</b> found it difficult to enforce the peace. A person could break the law in Philadelphia City and quickly cross the border and escape punishment. Districts outside Philadelphia could not control their criminal elements {{and at the same time}} refused to let Philadelphia get involved. An example of how poorly law enforcement agencies worked together was in May, 1844 when an anti-Catholic riot erupted in Kensington. The sheriff was the only police officer available in Kensington at the time and when Philadelphia's militia was called they hesitated because they hadn't been reimbursed for past calls. By the time the militia arrived, the riot was out of control. Attempts to improve the issue included an 1845 law that required several of the surrounding districts to maintain adequate law enforcement and an 1850 act that gave Philadelphia law enforcement the authority to police seven surrounding districts. As a result, the act also achieved one of its intended roles: Expand and strengthen the jurisdiction of the Philadelphia Police Department ...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 75 - 83). Social Media {{has changed}} how society communicates {{and how it}} views itself. With the world making the massive shift to the sharing of information via online social networks, clandestine groups are exploiting these platforms for their own purposes. There is strong evidence that groups such as Islamic terrorists, white supremacy organizations, and Mexican drug cartels are utilizing these online media sites for communication, recruitment, propaganda, cybercrime, and intelligence gathering. Although law enforcement and intelligence officials have partially recognized the utility of social media in investigations and intelligence gathering, they face tremendous hurdles that prevent more effective application of many social media tools. Among these hurdles, which are giving these groups an enormous advantage are: (1) lack of coordination among agencies, (2) low public trust and cooperation with law enforcement and the intelligence community by many portions of the public, (3) decreased budgets preventing government entities from developing new solutions, (4) rules and policies {{against the use of}} social media in government agencies, (5) and unfamiliarity with the functionality and nuances (including jargon and foreign languages) in social media by traditional law enforcement and intelligence community. Nevertheless, there are solutions that may alleviate many of these problems, but only if these solutions are pursued and allowed by the protocols and laws that control law enforcement and intelligence groups. Overall, free to low cost tools can play an extremely large role in assisting law enforcement and the intelligence community. While social media should become a greater part of many law enforcement investigations and intelligence gathering, government officials must respect and protect citizens' rights and abide by the laws. However they must also be aware that the "bad guys" are using social media in ways that are beyond the law and very much to the disadvantage of law enforcement and other legitimate parts of government and society. Because of the speed of innovation and technology advancement, <b>laws</b> that <b>govern</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> and the intelligence community are rapidly becoming ineffective as tools to protect citizens of this country against the schemes of criminal organizations including in arenas of fraud, theft, human trafficking, and dozens of other aspects of the criminal world, Congress and the courts must consider updating current laws to apply to newer technologies in ways that law enforcement and the courts can appropriately prosecute criminals nationally and internationally. Law enforcement and intelligence groups will absolutely have to make changes in what they are doing as the enormity of the changes in social media have fundamentally changed the world...|$|R
