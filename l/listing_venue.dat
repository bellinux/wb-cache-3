40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether a}} Canadian-listed firm seeking to cross-list in the U. S. needs to consider liquidity differences when making a choice among the main U. S. venues (AMEX, NYSE or NASDAQ). After controlling for firm characteristics, {{we find that}} trade costs for Canadian shares cross-listed in the U. S. do {{not depend on the}} U. S. cross-listing venue. This suggests that the choice of U. S. <b>listing</b> <b>venue</b> may be better motivated by the desire to minimize listing fees or to increase investor recognition and visibility.

40|$|Using a {{cross section}} of {{effectively}} the entire universe of overseas listings across world markets, we examine the market preferences of firms listing their stock abroad. We find that geographic, economic, cultural, and industrial proximity play the dominant role in the choice of overseas <b>listing</b> <b>venue.</b> Contrary to the notion that firms maximize international portfolio diversification gains in listing abroad, cross-listing activity is more common across markets for which diversification gains are relatively low. Our findings imply that the same proximity constraints that are believed to lead to "home bias" in investment portfolio decisions also exert a profound influence on financing decisions.

40|$|The Chinese {{share market}} as an {{emerging}} and fast-growing <b>listing</b> <b>venue</b> {{has experienced a}} significant development since 2000. Prior studies on this market overwhelmingly concentrate on IPO-pricing-related and post-IPO performance-based propositions with lagging data. Adopting the updated data within {{the last couple of}} years, this paper comprehensively explores and accounts for some striking features of the Chinese stock market, and unfolds some new causes contributing to these characteristics. Some new findings are revealed. 1) Two new factors may lead to the extreme under pricing in China’s market, which are the unseasoned investor sand their high demands of IPO shares. 2) The foreign-currency trading platform is not effective and efficient to attract the overseas investors. 3) The imbalanced industry structure of the listed firms is very significant, the Chinese share market is dominated by the manufacturing firms. 4) The Growth Enterprise Market of China is essential to address the long-standing financing difficulties for the Chinese Small and Medium-sized Enterprises...|$|E

40|$|Microstructure {{effects of}} tender offer {{acquisitions}} on targets and acquirers differentiated by <b>listing</b> <b>venue</b> and payment method are examined. Trading activity increases more for targets than for acquirers upon offer announcement. Investors {{are more likely}} to sell targets upon announcement using direct market orders against ask limit orders for cash payment offers. While target liquidity improves as spread costs fall and quoted depths increase, acquirer liquidity falls continuously to successful offer completion. Due to increased trading differences, temporary trade costs fall more for targets than for acquirers. Permanent trade costs decline over the tender offer cycle for both parties, and especially for targets for cash tender offers and for acquirers for shares tender offers. The probability of informed trading declines (remains constant) for targets (acquirers) because increased trading intensity is greater (the same) for uninformed versus informed traders. As expected, abnormal returns and changes in own-firm permanent return volatility are negatively (but weakly) and positively (and strongly) related, respectively, to changes in information asymmetry upon announcement.

40|$|Listing {{requirements}} are different across various stock markets. The Growth Enterprise Market of China (GEMC) —an emerging <b>listing</b> <b>venue</b> launched in 2009 —has strict entry {{requirements for the}} four IPO factors: the firm’s fundraising amount, its net profit, potential growth rate, and net assets. Using a modified probit model based on previous studies, this study aims to {{examine the impact of}} these financial determinants on the IPO probability in the Chinese stock market. Using a sample of the initial 243 IPOs in the market over the 2009 – 2011 period, this study develops a regression model to investigate the relationships between these factors and suggests that the firm’s net profit and its growth rate substantively determine the IPO volume (fundraising amount). In addition, this study adopts probit models to test the influence of the four factors on IPO likelihood, and shows that: 1) the fundraising amount, {{as one of the most}} significant IPO determinants, is positively associated with IPO probability on the new listing market; 2) the net profit, as a fundamental IPO determinant, is positively associated with IPO probability, but also with other indicators, which demonstrates the fact that the GEMC is a profit-preferring listing venue; 3) the net assets determine IPO probability but not IPO volume on the market...|$|E
