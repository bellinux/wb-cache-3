The catch from traps baited with the pheromone of a single species was compared with the catch from traps baited with pheromones for several species. The catch in the multispecies traps was significantly reduced in comparison with the single species traps for Dendrolimus pini, L. monacha and N. sertifer. Neodiprion sertifer was most likely inhibited by the Diprion pini pheromone. A follow-up study of Dendrolimus pini and L. monacha showed no pheromonal interference between them. Further studies are needed to evaluate the feasibility of multispecies monitoring. However, for practical applications a slight decrease in catch, due to pheromonal interference, could probably be tolerated as long as the catch reflects total population density...|$|R
5000|$|As a timber, both Swietenia macrophylla and Swietenia mahogoni {{are both}} grown in {{plantations}} in several Asian {{countries such as}} Fiji, Indonesia, India, and Bangladesh and this plantation mahogany timber is {{the main source of}} the world's current supply of [...] "genuine mahogany", due to cultivation and trade of it in its native locations being restricted by the Convention On International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna CITES since the late 1990s. Trade in Swietenia grown and harvested in these non-native locations is not restricted. Species of this genus are only occasionally plantation-grown in Central America, in spite of the good growing conditions and high price of the wood, due to the ubiquitous presence of the mahogany <b>shoot</b> borer <b>moth</b> (also known as the cedar tip moth), Hypsipyla grandella, which damages the form of the tree by killing the terminal shoot, causing excessive branching. Control requires extensive and frequent spraying with pesticides, rendering the genus relatively uneconomic wherever the shoot borer is present.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1969 Major {{objectives}} of the study involved development of a laboratory procedure to obtain mating, determining characteristics of female sex attraction, and determination {{of the effects of}} temperature and humidity on mating and fecundity. The second of two methods devised to obtain mating, "the vertical airflow technique," was convenient to employ and most efficient in producing mated females. This method resulted in 73 percent of the females mating within 48 hours. Mating was triggered by decreased illumination, and slow airflow directed from females toward males greatly facilitated sexual activity. Females varied in attractant potency, with some apparently incapable of attracting any males to sticky traps and others capturing high numbers. The source of pheromone production was a gland on the dorsum of the abdominal tip between the penultimate and terminal segments. Males could be attracted over distances up to 100 yards to sex attractant baits, and responded best to traps located in host pines as compared to traps in the open or in nonhost foliage. Mating efficiency decreased for both sexes after they were 4. 5 days old. Females older than 2. 5 days at the time of mating oviposited fewer eggs than females fertilized at a younger age. Average fecundity for females less than 2. 5 days old when mated was 126 eggs. Males were capable of multiple matings, whereas females normally mated only once. Males copulated with an average of 2. 24 females, although a small percentage never mated and others paired up to 5 and 6 times. Matings were observed at temperatures ranging from 54 to 92 ° F. Within the range of 65 to 85 ° F. {{there were no significant differences}} in mating efficiency. Fecundity was also unaffected within these limits with an accompanying high humidity. At 92 ° F., fecundity decreased and there was total egg mortality despite a high humidity. Fecundity decreased proportionately to decreasing air moisture (high evaporation rates) at temperatures of 85 ° F. or below. These detrimental influences of high evaporation rates and temperature could limit the geographic distribution of the European pine <b>shoot</b> <b>moth,</b> since most western pine regions are noted for hot, dry summer weather...|$|R
50|$|It is {{a medium-size}} to large {{deciduous}} coniferous tree reaching 20-50 m tall, with a trunk up to 1 m diameter. The crown is conic when young, becoming broad with age; the main branches are level to upswept, {{with the side}} branches often pendulous. The shoots are dimorphic, with growth divided into long shoots (typically 10-50 cm long) and bearing several buds, and short shoots only 1-2 mm long with only a single bud. It has bimorphic needles, with needles on new growth borne singly and arranged in a spiral around the branch and needles on older wood borne in clusters of 15-40 needles on short spurs. It is most easily distinguished from the closely related European <b>larch</b> by the <b>shoots</b> being downy (hairless in European larch). The leaves are needle-like, light green, 2-5 cm long, and turn bright yellow before they fall in the autumn, leaving the pale yellow-buff shoots bare until the next spring.|$|R
40|$|The {{pea moth}} (Cydia nigricana, Lep. Tortricidae) has {{developed}} {{to a serious}} pest {{in various parts of}} Germany, particularly in organic vegetable peas and protein seed peas. The prospects of mating disruption (MD-control) utilizing synthetic C. nigricana sex- pheromone were investigated in field trials in 2004 - 2006. Objectives were to gather basic technical data concerning the dispenser material, field dosage and evaporation rates under field conditions in commercial pea stands, re-spectively. Pheromone-treated and untreated fields of at least 2 ha were compared pairwise concerning the percentage of infested pea pods at green picking stage, age structure of larvae and final infestation rates in harvested material. In addition in 2005 and 2006 cages were placed in the centre of pheromone-treated and untreated fields. Cellulose dispensers (600 ha- 1) loaded with a total of 200 g E 8, E 10 -dodekadien- 1 -yl- acetat ha- 1) were hung manually on pea main <b>shoots</b> before <b>moth</b> flight activity com-menced, monitored with Tripheron®-monitoring delta traps.
