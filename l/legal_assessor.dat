2500|$|Francesco Possenti {{was born}} on March 1, 1838, in Assisi Italy, the {{eleventh}} of thirteen children born to his mother, Agnes, and his father, Sante. The family were then resident {{in the town of}} Assisi where Sante worked for the local government. Possenti was baptised on the day of his birth in the same font in which Saint Francis of Assisi had been baptised. Shortly after Francis' birth Sante Possenti was transferred to a post at Montalta and thence to Spoleto where, in 1841, he was appointed <b>legal</b> <b>assessor.</b> In Spoleto the family was struck with a number of bereavements: [...] the deaths of a baby girl, Rosa, in December 1841; of seven-year-old Adele in January 1842; and of Francis’ mother, Agnes, in 1842.|$|E
2500|$|Little {{is known}} about Arellano's public {{activity}} in the 1940s; holding no official posts he remained an important figure in Navarrese political realm, especially that his promoter Rodezno {{was at that time}} vice-president of [...] Apart from his engagement in private businesses, Arellano was <b>legal</b> <b>assessor</b> of the Navarrese self-government, got involved in work on setting up Institución Principe de Viana and remained busy assembling compilation of traditional local regulations, commissioned by the Diputación. In the mid-1940s he was involved in promotion of fuerista establishments, climaxing in congress of regionalist lawyers in Montserrat. Though outside intransigent Carlism headed by don Javier, he remained one of key figures in the wider Traditionalist realm. Along Rodezno he formed the faction advocating that don Juan, son of the deposed Alfonso XIII, is considered a legitimate Carlist heir. Among other so-called Juanistas Arellano visited him in the Estoril residence in 1946. He co-drafted Bases de Estoril, a document signed by don Juan; though very much embracing Traditionalist principles, it fell short of declaring him the legitimate Carlist pretender.|$|E
60|$|In his {{profession}} he distinguished himself {{in one or}} two causes of local celebrity. An innovating citizen had been ordered by the authorities to remove a lightning-conductor from his house within three days, as being a mischievous practical paradox, as well as a danger and an annoyance to his neighbours. Robespierre pleaded the innovator's case on appeal, and won it. He defended a poor woman who had been wrongfully accused by a monk belonging to the powerful corporation of a great neighbouring abbey. The young advocate did not even shrink from manfully arguing a case against the august Bishop of Arras himself. His independence did him no harm. The Bishop afterwards appointed him to the post of judge or <b>legal</b> <b>assessor</b> in the episcopal court. This tribunal was a remnant of what had once been the sovereign authority and jurisdiction of the Bishops of Arras. That a court with the power of life and death should thus exist by the side of a proper corporation of civil magistrates, is an illustration of the inextricable labyrinth of the French law and its administration {{on the eve of the}} Revolution. Robespierre did not hold his office long. Every one has heard the striking story, how the young judge, whose name was within half a dozen years to take a place in the popular mind of France and of Europe with the bloodiest monsters of myth or history, resigned his post in a fit of remorse after condemning a murderer to be executed. 'He is a criminal, no doubt,' Robespierre kept groaning in reply to the consolations of his sister, for women are more positive creatures than men: 'a criminal, no doubt; but to put a man to death!' Many a man thus begins the great voyage with queasy sensibilities, and ends it a cannibal.|$|E

2500|$|Augustine of Hippo {{estimated}} {{his personal}} income as being 20 {{times that of}} his father, a minor civil servant; and Augustine {{was by no means}} the wealthiest bishop in North Africa. [...] But in accepting from Constantine the status of civil magistrates, bishops were now also committed to substantial expenditure to maintain their new style and status; and also to fulfil the associated duties, for instance in employing qualified <b>legal</b> <b>assessors</b> to support them when sitting as civil judges.|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} legal {{pluralism}} and {{the multiplicity of}} ways of "doing justice" have {{caught the attention of}} numerous anthropologists and lawyers. Beyond discussions of law, we’d like to expose a situation of legal pluralism at the local level and describe how different forms of justice can interact. It will therefore address pluralism not as a concept, but as a practice. In this contribution, we discuss the case of legal pluralism in the province of Hualgayoc in the Andean region of Cajamarca, in Peru. There, the “peasant patrols”, watchdog organizations of vigilance, justice and local politics, are recognized by the State and work with the police and <b>legal</b> <b>assessors</b> for the resolution of problems in rural areas. This article is based on field research that shows the emergence of forms of mixed local justice that may permit the development of comparative analysis...|$|R

In the wake of that ruling, this article analyses a 2002 Italian case of murder with aggravating circumstances involving a mother, AMF, and her three-year-old son. Conflict between generations is a dramatic event that has been consistently repeated since time immemorial. Within this conflict, family feelings offer a molecular view of the relevant phenomena. In the case under review, the process followed by <b>legal</b> <b>assessors</b> and experts in profiling {{the personality of the}} convicted person will receive particular attention, as will the importance of certain standards of conduct and treatment that must be guaranteed to individuals, including those convicted of horrible crimes in today’s society. A commitment must be made to value and affirm the dignity of feelings and affective relationships, which are necessary to restore meaning to one’s own social affiliation in an attempt to reconcile the motivations of the heart with the love of reason...|$|R

After working for a year under Theodosius I, Tatianus left his place to retire for {{the next eight years}} in Lycia; {{it is not clear whether}} it was due to the pressure of imperial favourites, brought by the new Emperor from the West.|$|R

50|$|Originally he {{was known}} as Theodore ("gift of God"), not an {{exclusively}} Christian name. He was introduced to the Christian religion at the age of fourteen, {{after the death of his}} father. He had a brother Athenodorus, and on the advice of one of their tutors, the young men were eager to study at the Berytus in Beirut, then one of the four or five famous schools in the Hellenic world. At this time, their brother-in-law was appointed <b>assessor</b> (<b>legal</b> counsel) to the Roman Governor of Palestine; the youths had therefore an occasion to act as an escort to their sister as far as Caesarea in Palestine. On arrival in that town they learned that the celebrated scholar Origen, head of the Catechetical School of Alexandria, resided there. Curiosity led them to hear and converse with the master. Soon both youths forgot all about Beirut and Roman law, and gave themselves up to the great Christian teacher, who gradually won them over to Christianity.|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} {{the large amount of}} {{information}} about the events occurred on 15 th February 2012 off the coast of Southern India the fragmented and unverifiable data coming from various sources make very difficult to carry out technical surveys having legal validity. It is obvious that both the expert of each party and the assessor need to have access to all documents and exhibits. In the Italian judicial system and <b>legal</b> proceedings both <b>assessors</b> and experts of the claimant and of the defendant take part in the technical survey process because the technical survey can have probative force and tend to prove a matter at issue. In the case of the jailed Italian marines issue, the unilateral decision of the Indian authorities not to allow the Italian forensic experts (the experts of the defendant) {{to take part in the}} technical survey process preventing them in this way from carrying out the technical survey together with the Indian experts (the experts of the claimant) violates the principles of a fair process. The Italian forensic experts were allowed to be just “observers ” of the survey and were excluded from decision-making. Against this background, I think that it is useful to carry out a technical analysis of the events based on the available information reported in the press, being aware that some elements may have been misrepresented and misreported in the available sources. In {{spite of the}} mentioned shortcoming, the method I used for the analysis is valid. This means that if one day you have access to verifiable evidences and exhibits coming from reliable sources other than those I took into consideration, it will be possible to replace the ones I used with the more reliable ones and repeat the analysis and the survey without changing the methodological structure of my analysis. Each technical survey follows a reliable method of inquiry and analysis. In the following we will do so with the purpose of analysing the nature of the facts and where they happened...|$|R
