50|$|In marketing, {{customer}} lifetime value (CLV or often CLTV), lifetime {{customer value}} (LCV), or <b>life-time</b> <b>value</b> (LTV) is a prediction {{of the net}} profit attributed to the entire future relationship with a customer. The prediction model can have varying levels of sophistication and accuracy, ranging from a crude heuristic {{to the use of}} complex predictive analytics techniques. Customer lifetime value can also be defined as the dollar value of a customer relationship, based on the present value of the projected future cash flows from the customer relationship. Customer lifetime value is an important concept in that it encourages firms to shift their focus from quarterly profits to the long-term health of their customer relationships. Customer lifetime value is an important number because it represents an upper limit on spending to acquire new customers. For this reason it is an important element in calculating payback of advertising spent in marketing mix modeling.|$|E

Main part of the thesis focuses on model design of customer value quantification. Before the model was designed, three researches were performed. Two quantitative researches were focused on understanding of actual situation {{in the area of}} public relation management in the Czech Republic. This quantitative research provided information used in the model's design. Based on the research input model parameters were set. The proposed method of their processing was designed by using fuzzy logic. The final model provides customer valuation and their division into groups. Moreover, modifications that reflect needed practice are discussed within the model design. The proposed model is applied to real data {{at the end of the}} thesis...|$|E

40|$|Using a large {{panel of}} Finnish males, we study how the {{recession}} of the early 1990 s hit different worker groups and affected inequality in the labour market. Despite large employment losses the cross-section dispersion of earnings is found be almost constant, while differences in layoff and hiring rates between groups have been changing over the early 1990 s. To bring these divergent patterns together, we analyse the evolution of inequality in the cross-section distributions of <b>life-time</b> employment <b>values</b> derived from a search model. We show that the recession caused welfare losses in all worker groups and increased inequality. Compared to the figures reported for the U. S., the average levels of inequality based on life-time welfare measures {{are found to be}} very close to each others in both countries, even though wage inequality is much lower in Finland.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new DEVS/HLA environment. It {{is based on}} DEVS concepts allowing hierarchical modular modeling and fast event-driven simulations combined with HLA specification to interconnect distributed DEVS models. For this purpose, we develop a different DEVS mapping with the HLA specification regarding those proposed by Zeigler. This new mapping doesn't transfer the information of coupling relations from RTI level to federate level and doesn't broadcast messages globally between federates. Therefore, this mapping permits a more accurate use of the RTI. The steps of the proposed DEVS/HLA integration {{are those of the}} HLA FEDEP. In particular, we address a new solution to HLA Time Management requirement and we focus on the computation of HLA lookahead using DEVS models current state and a depth-first search algorithm. Using this algorithm on specific DEVS models, with explicit phases and constant life-time function associated with, we compute a HLA Lookahead value greater or equal to minimum of <b>life-time</b> function <b>values</b> of local DEVS coupled models. Furthermore, our local simulation structure is “flatten” to reduce the exchange of messages between components with regard to the structure of classical DEVS simulators. Finally, the proposed environment can integrate DEVS simulators and heterogeneous HLA-compliant programs to compose global simulations...|$|R

Focus groups with Irish third level students, and interviews with key personnel involved in the blood donation process were conducted. Altruism is still the biggest reason why third level students donate blood and should continue to be the basis of the advertising message aimed at this segment. Non-donor participants were unaware of the whole area of blood and were not aware of its uses or the process of donation. The advertisements that they found effective, were the rational-based fear advertisements that challenged their excuses and their complacency and urged them to donate.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} numerical techniques {{developed to}} determine the wellbore configuration that will optimize the <b>life-time</b> <b>value</b> of a property. The production history of a reservoir can be predicted by integrating a reservoir model, a well-bore flow model, a choke model, and a separator model. Changes in any production parameter, including the gas-lift configuration, will cause changes in the predicted production history. The numerical methods can find the combination of production parameters that optimizes the net present value of the flowstream. The control parameters sampled in this work include tubing diameter, separator pressures, depth of gas injection, and volume of gas injected. Each of these parameters can be variable with time. The influence of these parameters upon the net present value {{is complicated by the}} feed-back nature of the gas-injection loop.

40|$|Genetic {{parameters}} {{were estimated}} using 3, 313 half-sib records from 62 sires and. 1720 daughter-dam pairs. The data used were obtained {{over the period}} 1957 to 1972. The estimates of heritability by paternal half-sib and daughter-dam regression analysis were respectively:- weaning weight (0. 20 and 0. 16); hogget body weight (0. 27 and 0. 44); fleece weight (0. 32 and 0. 30); quality number (0. 26 and O. 31); fibre diameter (0. 54 and 0. 47); staple length (0. 49 and 0. 35); character (0. 23 and 0. 23). An estimate of 0. 03 was obtained for lambs weaned/ewe lambing (Lw/EL) by the daughter-dam regression analysis from 665 daughter-dam pairs. Estimates of genetic correlations were in the following ranges;- Medium negative (- 0. 4 to - 0. 6) Low negative (- 02. to - 0. 4) Low positive (0. 2 to 0. 4) Medium positive (0. 4 to 0. 6) High positive (0. 6 and over) Hogget body weight with character. Quality number with staple length. Weaning weight with quality number, fibre diameter and character. Quality number with fleece weight and fibre diameter. Hogget body weight with weaning weight and quality number. Staple length with character. Fleece weight with fibre diameter and character. Fleece weight with staple length. Phenotypic and environmental correlations were also estimated. Phenotypic correlations generally agreed with the genetic correlations. Important exceptions were hogget body weight with fleece weight, staple length and fibre diameter. Among the environmental factors studied, age of dam and rearing rank effects for the wool traits were generally small. These effects had a marked influence on weaning weight and hogget body weight. At weaning, singles were 4. 2 kg heavier than twins, while at 14 months, this difference {{had been reduced to}} 2. 1 kg. When comparing a two-year-old and mature age of dam effects, a 1. 44 kg difference at weaning in favour of the mature age of dam reared animals, was reduced to a 1. 11 kg difference at 14 months. The estimated parameters and environmental effects were discussed with reference to their implications in selection programmes. Relationships between hogget traits and the ewes lifetime production (four consecutive years) were analysed. Records from 458 sheep were used. Correlation coefficients indicated that hogget fleece weight, quality number, fibre diameter and staple length were good indicators of lifetime ewe performance for these traits. The results indicated that a poor relation exists between hogget body weight and number of lambs weaned by the ewe over four lambings. A regression analysis of hogget traits on <b>life-time</b> economic <b>value</b> of the ewe indicated that fleece weight and hogget body weight were the most important variables influencing <b>life-time</b> economic <b>value.</b> Implications of the results were discussed with reference to selection and culling programmes at the hogget age in ram breeding and non-ram breeding flocks...|$|R
40|$|The {{costs for}} stroke {{management}} and reduced health related {{quality of life}} (QoL) can extend throughout life as mental and physical disabilities are common. The aim of this thesis was to quantify this stroke-related burden with data from Riks-Stroke (RS), the Swedish stroke register. Costs for hospital and primary care, secondary drug prevention, home and residential care services, and production losses were estimated for first-ever stroke patients registered in the RS. The present value lifetime costs were estimated from the expected survival and discounted by 3 %. Quality of life was estimated with the EQ- 5 D instrument on a subset of patients at 3 months after the index event and mapped to patient-reported outcome measures in the RS. Standard descriptive and analytic (multivariate regressions) statistical methods were used. The <b>life-time</b> societal present <b>value</b> cost per patient in 2009 was approximately € 69, 000 whereof home and residential care due to stroke was 59 % and indirect costs for productivity losses accounted for 21 % (year 2009 prices). Women had higher costs than men in all age groups. Treatment at stroke units had a low incremental cost per life-year gained compared to patients who were not treated at such facilities. The estimated disutility from stroke was greatest for women and the oldest, and compared to 1997 the cost per patient increased after a revised assumption. Hospitalisation costs were stable while long-term costs for ADL support increased {{in part due to}} a changed age structure. Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF; 24 %) had € 367 higher inpatient costs compared to non-AF stroke patients € 8, 914 (P< 0. 01; year 2001 prices). As the index case fatality was higher among AF patients, the cost difference was higher for patients surviving the first 28 days. A multivariate regression showed that AF, diabetes, stroke severity, and death during the 3 -year follow-up period were independent cost drivers. Three regression techniques (OLS, Tobit, CLAD) were chosen for mapping EQ- 5 D utilities to patient-reported outcome measures in the RS. The mean utility was overestimated with all models and had lower variance than the original data. In conclusion, total societal lifetime cost for 22, 000 first-ever stroke patients in 2009 amounted to € 1. 5 billion (whereof production losses were € 314 million). About 56, 600 QALYs were lost due to premature death and disability. Including a preference-based QoL instrument in the RS would allow cost-utility analyses, {{but it is important to}} control for confounders in comparator arms to avoid bias...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{determinants}} of season of birth of the ﬁrst child, for White non-Hispanic married women aged 25 - 45 in the US, using birth certiﬁcate and Census data. The prevalence of good season (quarters 2 and 3) is signiﬁcantly related to mother’s age, education, and smoking status during pregnancy, {{as well as to}} receiving WIC food during pregnancy and to pre-pregnancy body mass index. Moreover, those who did not use assisted reproductive technology (ART) present a higher prevalence of good season births. The frequency of good season is also higher and more strongly related to mother’s age in states where cold weather is more severe, and varies with mother’s occupation, exhibiting a particularly strong positive association with work-ing in “education, training, and library”. Remarkably, this relationship between good season and weather disappears for mothers in “education, training, and library” oc-cupations, revealing that season of birth is a matter of choice and preferences, not simply a biological mechanism. We estimate the compensating wage diﬀerential for mothers who work in jobs other than “education, training, and library”, which allows us to provide an upper-bound to the <b>life-time</b> <b>value</b> of good season of birth of about USD 1, 000, 000. Finally, we present evidence that good season of birth is positively related to health at birth conditional on several maternal characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Service {{provider}} switching {{phenomenon and}} customer retention strategies have recently gained increasing {{importance in the}} field of relationship marketing due to globalization and maturity in many service industries. The objective of this thesis is to provide customer relationship managers understanding and gauges for increasing customer <b>life-time</b> <b>value</b> (CLV) through customer retention strategies. To improve CLV and thereby revenues and profits firms should first identify the value of their customers and then execute targeted marketing activities aiming at either: 1) managing the duration of the relationships, or 2) influencing customers' purchase behaviors. This thesis provides answers primarily to the first avenue by building understanding on the determinants that differentiate service customers' group membership between 'switchers' and 'stayers' and by examining the strength and relative directional impact of the identified antecedent risk-factors on the customers' propensity to terminate maintenance service contracts. The literature review of this thesis creates links between the areas of relationship marketing, customer retention and switching behavior, and covers the switching phenomena from switching process, switching antecedent and customer heterogeneity point-of-views. Based on the literature a novel conceptual framework is created supplementing elements of the Customer Asset Management of Services (CUSAMS) model with theoretical underpinnings from the Switching Path Analysis Technique (SPAT) and Push, Pull, Mooring (PPM) framework. The examination of the relationships based on the conceptual framework was done by the means of quantitative research methods using logistic regression analysis. As a result a dynamic model of service contract renewal for an individual firm, at the contract level, is developed. The decision to renew a service contract is modeled as a function of customers' overall relationship perceptions and loyalty intent, customers' behavioral characteristics, customers' relationship value perceptions as well as prior loyalty behaviors. The findings of this thesis suggest that customer relationship managers and marketers should pay special attention to customer Net Promoter Scores, representing satisfaction and commitment, as well as customers' cross-buying behaviors in other non-focal services. Furthermore, prior switching behavior and commitment to equipment brand in also maintenance services were partially supported by the study as differentiators between switching-prone and non-switching prone customers. Finally, no significant relationship between critical incidents and price level (customer value perceptions) on propensity to switch service providers were found. The study is conducted as a commission for a Nordic multinational company that offers both manufactured industrial products and related maintenance services...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} some of the most common beliefs about customer-perceived quality are wrong. For example, 1) it is not {{necessary}} to exceed customer expectations to increase preference, 2) receiving an expected level of bad service does not reduce preference, 3) rational customers may rationally choose an option with lower expected quality, even if all non-quality attributes are equal, and 4) paying more attention to loyal, experienced customers can sometimes be counter-productive. These surprising findings make sense in retrospect, once customer expectations are viewed as distributions, rather than simple point expectations. That is, each customer has a probability density function that describes the relative likelihood that a particular quality outcome will be experienced. Customers form these expectation distributions based on their cumulative experience with the good or service. A customer's cumulative expectation distribution may be conceptualized as being a predictive density for the next transaction. When combined with a diminishing returns (i. e., concave) utility function, this Bayesian theoretical framework results in predictions of: (a) how consumers will behave over time, and (b) how their perceptions and evaluations will change. In managerial terms, we conclude that customers consider not only expected quality, but also risk. This may help explain why current measures of customer satisfaction (which is highly related to expected quality) only partially predict future behavior. We find that most of the predictions of our theoretical model are borne out by empirical evidence from two experiments. Thus, we conclude that our approach provides a useful simplification of reality that successfully predicts many aspects of the dynamics of consumer response to quality. These findings are relevant to both academics and managers. Academics in the area of customer satisfaction and service quality need to be aware that it may be insufficient to measure only the point expectation, as has always been the standard practice. Instead it may be necessary to measure the uncertainty that the customer has with respect to the level of service that will be received. Due to questionnaire length constraints, it may not be practical for managers to include uncertainty questions on customer satisfaction surveys. Nevertheless it is possible to build a proxy for uncertainty by measuring the extent of experience with the service/good, and this proxy can be used to partially control for uncertainty effects. The findings of the study were obtained using 1) an analytical model of customer expectation updating, based on a set of assumptions that are well-supported in the academic literature, and 2) two behavioral experiments using human subjects: a cross-sectional experiment, and a longitudinal experiment. Both the analytical model and the behavioral experiments were designed to investigate the effects that of expectations might have, and especially the effects that might deviate from the predictions that would arise from a traditional point expectation model. The behavioral experiments largely confirmed the predictions of the analytical model. As it turned out, the analytical model correctly (in most cases) predicted behavioral effects that contradict some of the best-accepted “truisms” of customer satisfaction. It is now clear that a more sophisticated view of customer expectations is required—one that considers not only the point expectation but also the likelihood across the entire distribution of possible outcomes. This distinction is not “just academic,” because it results in predictable behavior that deviates significantly from that which was traditionally expected based on simpler models.
