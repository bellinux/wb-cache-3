5|$|There is {{considerable}} migration between the Nordic countries, but {{owing to the}} similarity between the cultures and languages (with the exception of Finnish), expatriates generally assimilate quickly and do not stand out as a group.

5|$|Mongolian is the {{official}} national language of Mongolia, where it is spoken (but not written) by nearly 3.6 million people (2014 estimate), and {{the official}} provincial language (both spoken and written forms) of Inner Mongolia, China, where {{there are at least}} 4.1 million ethnic Mongols. Across the whole of China, the language is spoken by roughly half of the country's 5.8 million ethnic Mongols (2005 estimate) However, the exact number of Mongolian speakers in China is unknown, as there is no data available on the <b>language</b> <b>proficiency</b> of that country's citizens. The use of Mongolian in Inner Mongolia, has witnessed periods of decline and revival over the last few hundred years. The language experienced a decline during the late Qing period, a revival between 1947 and 1965, a second decline between 1966 and 1976, a second revival between 1977 and 1992, and a third decline between 1995 and 2012. However, in spite of the decline of the Mongolian language in some of Inner Mongolia's urban areas and educational spheres, the ethnic identity of the urbanized Chinese-speaking Mongols is most likely going to survive due to the presence of urban ethnic communities. The multilingual situation in Inner Mongolia does not appear to obstruct efforts by ethnic Mongols to preserve their language. Although an unknown number of Mongols in China, such as the Tumets, may have completely or partially lost the ability to speak their language, they are still registered as ethnic Mongols and continue to identify themselves as ethnic Mongols. The children of inter-ethnic Mongol-Chinese marriages also claim to be and are registered as ethnic Mongols.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} role of family-induced {{linguistic}} input as a predictor for <b>proficiencies</b> in written <b>language</b> production of multilingual children aged 11. Our study considers their <b>proficiencies</b> in majority <b>language</b> (German) {{as well as in}} their family languages. Given that in most cases systematic educational support is warranted for majority language only, we assume marginal effects of familial linguistic input on the child's performance in majority language but substantial effects on family <b>language</b> <b>proficiencies.</b> We differentiate between quantitative and qualitative input aspects and include additional social and educational variables that are supposed to interfere with the relation between linguistic input and <b>language</b> <b>proficiencies.</b> The study is based on cross-sectional data collected in a pilot study, including Russian-German, Turkish-German and Vietnamese-German children in northern Germany. We computed nested OLS-regression models to examine the hypothesized relations. Results indicate that effects of familial quantitative input in German decrease when controlled for duration of contact with the majority language and for type of school the children attend. We discuss these factors mainly as indicators for external linguistic input. On the other hand we find support for the hypothesis that the quality of familial input in the family language has significant effect on the child's writing <b>proficiencies</b> in this <b>language.</b> We find no evidence that structural factors of the social background play an independent role in the examined relations...|$|R
40|$|This {{longitudinal}} {{investigation on}} Dutch children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI) aimed at determining the predictive value of statistically uncorrelated <b>language</b> <b>proficiencies</b> on later reading and spelling skills in Dutch. Language abilities, tested with an extensive test battery {{at the onset}} of formal reading instruction, were represented by four statistically uncorrelated factors: lexical-semantic abilities, auditory perception, verbal-sequential processing, and speech production. All factors contributed significantly to the prediction of word reading and spelling development seven months later. Verbal-sequential processing was the strongest predictor for both word decoding and spelling. Furthermore, autoregression effects of word decoding and spelling were strong and verbal-sequential processing had predictive value on word spelling nineteen months later when pre-existing spelling abilities were accounted for. Children with SLI and normal literacy skills performed better on most of the language and language-related measures than children with SLI and poor literacy skills. Learning outcomes: As a result of this activity, readers will describe four language domains that are related to later literacy skills in children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI). As a result of this activity, readers will recognize the predictive value of each of these language domains and the important role of verbal-sequential processing in learning to decode and writing words for children with SLI. As a result of this activity, readers will recall the differences in <b>language</b> <b>proficiencies</b> between children with SLI who develop normal literacy skills and those who encounter literacy problems...|$|R

The primary aim of {{this study}} was to analyze Spanglish adaptations and sentential Code-Switching occurrences in problem-solving tasks employed by Spanish-English bilinguals at SDSU. In order to achieve this objective two integral steps were paramount: first, to investigate participants' self-reported <b>language</b> experiences and <b>proficiency</b> using the LEAP-Q. Second was to explore the incidences of code-switching, language shift (LS), and Spanglish manipulations in two problem-solving tasks (PST). To achieve these objectives, SDSU undergraduate students were invited through a recruitment announcement to take the LEAP-Q. Participants self assessed their <b>language</b> <b>proficiencies,</b> preferences, and experiences. Then, participants were paired up for two 15 -minute problem-solving tasks, one in English and one in Spanish. The PSTs were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed for incidences of CS, LS, and Spanglish adaptations. Language preferences and experiences reported on the LEAP-Q were then used to analyze the languages participants used to solve the PSTs. The results showed an equal number of sentential switches and language shifts employed, however, inter-sentential CS occurred significantly much more than intrasentential.
