For example, at certain points in time, some people may prefer to have cash on hand and have low requirements for trading environments influenced by their culture or family’s low-income status. Therefore, consumers will {{be more sensitive to}} the price and quantity of commodities and pay little attention to the trading environment. At this time, retail formats with a simple <b>layout,</b> complete <b>categories</b> and long distance will exist. Similarly, when at a certain point in time, people may prefer the elegance and comfort of an instant trading environment and hate the long distance influenced by different cultures, then retail formats within short distances with attractive layouts will develop.|$|R

40|$|Guillotine-based {{page layout}} {{is a method}} for {{document}} lay-out commonly used by newspapers and magazines, where each region of the page either contains a single article, or is recursively split either vertically or horizontally. Suprisingly {{there appears to be}} little research into algorithms for auto-matic guillotine-based document layout. In this paper we give efficient algorithms to find optimal solutions to guillo-tine layout problems of two forms. Fixed-cut layout is where the structure of the guillotining is given and we only have to determine the best configuration for each individual ar-ticle to give the optimal total configuration. Free layout is where we also have to search for the optimal structure. We give bottom-up and top-down dynamic programming algo-rithms to solve these problems, and propose a novel interac-tion model for documents on electronic media. Experiments show that our algorithms are effective for realistic <b>layout</b> problems. <b>Categories</b> and Subject Descriptor...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{algorithms}} for multidimensional scaling, or MDS, aim for scalable {{performance as}} the number of points to lay out increases. However, they either assume that the distance function is cheap to compute, and perform poorly when the distance function is costly, or they leave the precise number of distances to compute as a manual tuning parameter. We present Glint, an MDS algorithm framework that addresses both of these shortcomings. Glint is designed to automatically minimize the total number of distances computed by progressively computing a more and more densely sampled approximation of the distance matrix. We present instantiations of the Glint framework on three different classes of MDS algorithms: force-directed, analytic, and gradient-based. We validate the framework through computational benchmarks on several real-world datasets, and demonstrate substantial performance benefits without sacrificing <b>layout</b> quality. <b>Categories</b> and Subject Descriptors (according to ACM CCS) : I. 3. 3 [Human-centered Computing]: Visualization— Visualization systems and tool...|$|R

40|$|Soft skills, {{especially}} communication skills, {{are important}} skills which each graduate must possess. Accordingly, several courses and approaches {{have been carried}} out in universities to train students in communication skills. The skills are normally evaluated by course lecturers. However, assessments by a third party from outside the university are valuable so that the students’ ahievements may be weighed against external evaluators’ point of views. In the Department of Electrical, Electronic and Systems Engineering (DEESE), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM), communication skills assessment by external lecturers and industry representatives are performed on Hari Poster JKEES, where students present their final year project poster. There are two categories of evaluation, namely project and communication skills. The project evaluation covers content, result and impact, while communication skills evaluation covers poster layout and design, and delivery. This study only analyse the students’ communication skills achievement. The participants of this study consists of 109 final year students from two batches, of which 51 students are from year 2014 and the other 58 students from year 2015. The results show that for the year 2014 students, the mean mark given by external lecturers in <b>layout</b> and design <b>category</b> is 6. 7, while the mean mark from industry evaluators is 6. 5.

The need to examine the "problem sensation", which was defined and verified in this study, resulted from {{the implementation of the}} special education law in Israel (1998). The study examines the effect a training process has over the development of the special education teacher's leadership skills, if it includes: a place where the teacher is heard, empowerment processes towards realizing a sense of personal capability, a reflective discourse, knowledge and skills acquisition, and developing beliefs and positions regarding the leadership of an interdisciplinary team.;The study's findings were documented using three case studies, each based on the conclusions of the previous one, all interlinked by a <b>category</b> <b>layout</b> formed in the Pre-Test phase. The <b>category</b> <b>layout</b> formed the basis for all the content analysis of the participants' discourse, and pointed to the existence of a "problem sensation" regarding the change process/style they experienced.;In all three-research cycles, the majority of the discourse regarded the role perception as influenced by coping with the need to lead a team and lead change in a team. A direct connection was found between the intensity of the sense of capability to lead a team, and the level of coping with conflicts while performing the role. There was a noticeable difference in the change process style the two groups underwent. The power of the team was accentuated and there was an awareness to the knowledge and skills acquired.;The study's conclusions show: (1) the direct connection between the special education teacher's sense of personal capability and her leadership behaviour, (2) a demand for reassessing the special education teachers' training program regarding management and leadership roles, (3) a need for a formal assistant training program, which would be a formal team for their employment...|$|R

The global features combined with local features form a <b>layout</b> for each <b>category</b> of bananas. Figure  6 shows {{that in the first}} convolutional layer, the global features including shape of the banana are extracted. Then, in the two following convolutional layers, other features including color and texture are extracted hierarchically. Unlike the manually extracted features used in [35 – 38], these features are automatically extracted by our proposed CNN architecture. As illustrated in Fig.  6, the global and local features of banana image are automatically extracted by our proposed CNN architecture. The map between the input banana image and the output classification result could be obtained through the extracted features.|$|R

40|$|There is {{no direct}} {{statutory}} planning enforcement mechanism for land without {{a history of}} Interim Development Permission Area Plans or Development Permission Area Plans in Hong Kong. Indirect enforcement of planning conditions is largely conducted by the Buildings Department upon building approval and by the Lands Department if the conditions are incorporated into the lease. The extent to which planning conditions are incorporated into leases is largely unknown, impacting {{the effect of this}} indirect contractual enforcement. The extent and probabilities of the incorporation of planning conditions in Comprehensive Development Area zones into leases are investigated. A total of 339 planning conditions on thirty-eight sites were identified but some were excluded from the study, leaving 188 for analysis. These conditions were categorised into eight types and tested with a probit model. It was found that three categories of planning conditions (access improvement, footbridges, lay-bys, and public vehicle parks; social facilities such as open space, day nursery, or kindergarten; water supply, draining, sewage) had the highest percentages of incorporation into leases, while the percentage for a fourth <b>category</b> (<b>layout,</b> landscape, car park plan) was not very high but still significantly higher than the other four categories. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} support drivers in forming the right {{expectations}} on the road, road categories are being made recognisable and predictable in the Netherlands. The present study investigated which of the selected road layouts can make rural road categories most recognisable for road users, especially in transitions from one road category to another. A second objective was to study whether explicit information could contribute to a better recognisability of transitions. The experiment was performed {{with a series of}} photographs showing sections of two road categories with an intersection in between. The road <b>layout</b> of road <b>categories</b> varied in markings and separation of driving direction (within-subjects factor). Informed and non-informed participants (between-subjects factor) had to indicate their expectations regarding speed limit and access restriction of each road section, before and after a transition. The results show that for transitions between distributor and through roads, the physicality of separation of driving direction is a better distinctive characteristic than the currently used edge marking. The green centre marking on through roads also enhances recognisability, but only with additional information. As far as transitions between distributor and access roads are concerned, the results demonstrate that this type of transitions is better recognised when no markings on access roads are present. Physical separation of driving directions on distributor roads also improves recognisability, although this layout is associated with higher speed limits. Providing explicit information has in general a positive effect on the reconisability of transitions. Implications are discussed in the light of potential safety effects.

40|$|Scene {{perception}} {{is a fundamental}} aspect of vision. Humans are capable of analyzing behaviorally-relevant scene properties such as spatial <b>layouts</b> or scene <b>categories</b> very quickly, even from low resolution versions of scenes. Although humans perform these tasks effortlessly, they are very challenging for machines. Developing methods that well capture {{the properties of the}} representation used by the visual system will be useful for building computational models that are more consistent with perception. While it is common to use hand-engineered features that extract information from predefined dimensions, they require careful tuning of parameters and do not generalize well to other tasks or larger datasets. This thesis is driven by the hypothesis that the perceptual representations are adapted to the statistical properties of natural visual scenes. For developing statistical features for global-scale structures (low spatial frequency information that encompasses entire scenes), I propose to train hierarchical probabilistic models on whole scene images. I first investigate statistical clusters of scene images by training a mixture model under the assumption that each image can be decoded by sparse and independent coefficients. Each cluster discovered by the unsupervised classifier is consistent with the high-level semantic categories (such as indoor, outdoor-natural and outdoor-manmade) as well as perceptual layout properties (mean depth, openness and perspective). To address the limitation of mixture models in their assumptions of a discrete number of underlying clusters, I further investigate a continuous representation for the distributions of whole scenes. The model parameters optimized for natural visual scenes reveal a compact representation that encodes their global-scale structures. I develop a probabilistic similarity measure based on the model and demonstrate its consistency with the perceptual similarities. Lastly, to learn the representations that better encode the manifold structures in general high-dimensional image space, I develop the image normalization process to find a set of canonical images that anchors the probabilistic distributions around the real data manifolds. The canonical images are employed as the centers of the conditional multivariate Gaussian distributions. This approach allows to learn more detailed structures of the local manifolds resulting in improved representation of the high level properties of scene images...|$|R
