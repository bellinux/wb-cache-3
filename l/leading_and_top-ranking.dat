Eddie handed passports to: Luis Polo y Barnabé, the Spanish ambassador, forcing his departure from the United States when war was declared on Spain in 1888; Lord Sackville-West, the British envoy sent home by President Cleveland; and to the Austrian Charge d' Affaire when the United States entered the First World War.|$|R

The comparison of the dominant conceptualizations of MCS reveals that MCS is perceived as a set of controls which managers have at their disposal to steer the organization towards the predetermined goals.

50|$|P. annularis {{has been}} found to exhibit slight {{variations}} in its colony cycle from year to year based on environmental conditions, in part due to the ability of females to switch castes. Typically, the largest <b>and</b> <b>top-ranking</b> female founds a nest and lays the largest percentage of eggs, while subordinates forage. After workers emerge from the eggs, many of the subordinate foundresses disappear; the nest usually loses its original queen before more eggs can be laid {{at the end of the}} season. A worker with fully developed ovaries takes over the nest and becomes a gyne. Earlier queen death corresponds to an earlier arrest in rearing brood, which may be due to a decrease in relatedness between the new queen and the nascent females, or due to internal conflict on the nest. Additionally, if resources decrease, such as during a drought, brood rearing ends sooner than in more prosperous years, and females choose to become gynes as opposed to workers. Many of these variations can be rationalized via relatedness.|$|R

The taps began sometime near the beginning of August 2004 and were removed in March 2005 without discovering the identity of the perpetrators. The intruders installed a rootkit targeting Ericsson's AXE telephone exchange. According to IEEE Spectrum, this was [...] "the first time a rootkit has been observed on a special-purpose system, in this case an Ericsson telephone switch." [...] The rootkit was designed to patch the memory of the exchange while it was running, enable wiretapping while disabling audit logs, patch the commands that list active processes and active data blocks, and modify the data block checksum verification command. A [...] "backdoor" [...] allowed an operator with sysadmin status to deactivate the exchange's transaction log, alarms and access commands related to the surveillance capability. The rootkit was discovered after the intruders installed a faulty update, which caused SMS texts to be undelivered, leading to an automated failure report being generated. Ericsson engineers were called in to investigate the fault and discovered the hidden data blocks containing the list of phone numbers being monitored, along with the rootkit and illicit monitoring software.|$|R
40|$|Background: Studies have {{indicated}} that sharing of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) data and subsequent feedback from the health care provider (HCP) can help achieve glycemic goals such as a reduction in glycated hemoglobin. Electronic SMBG data management and sharing tools for the PC and smartphones may help in reducing the effort to manage SMBG data. Methods: We reviewed software <b>and</b> <b>top-ranking</b> applications (Apps) for the iPhone platform to document the variety of useful features. Additionally, {{in an attempt to}} assess metrics such as task analysis and user friendliness of diabetes Apps, we observed and surveyed patients with diabetes as they recorded and relayed sample SMBG results to their hypothetical HCP using three Apps. Results: Observation and survey demonstrated that the WaveSense Diabetes Manager allowed the participants to complete preselected SMBG data entry and relay tasks faster than other Apps. The survey revealed patient behavior patterns that would be useful in future App development. Conclusion: Being able to record, analyze, seamlessly share, and obtain feedback on the SMBG data using an iPhone/iTouch App might potentially benefit patients. Trends in SMBG data management and the possibility of having interoperability of blood glucose monitors and smartphones may open up new avenues of diabetes management for the technologically savvy patient.
