50|$|Steam engines used many {{separate}} <b>oil</b> <b>boxes,</b> dotted {{around the}} engine. Each one was filled before starting and often refilled during running. Where access was difficult, usually because the <b>oil</b> <b>box</b> {{was on a}} moving component, the <b>oil</b> <b>box</b> had to {{be large enough to}} contain enough oil for a long working shift. To control the flow rate of oil from the reservoir to the bearing, the oil would flow through an oil wick by capillary action, rather than downwards under gravity.|$|R
5000|$|On steamships {{that ran}} their engines {{for days at}} a time, some crew members would be [...] "oilers" [...] whose primary duty was to {{continuously}} monitor and maintain <b>oil</b> <b>boxes.</b>|$|R

500|$|The {{tank was}} {{powered by a}} T-26 [...] flat row 4-cylinder {{air-cooled}} petrol engine, which was a complete Soviet copy of the Armstrong Siddeley engine used in the Vickers 6-Ton. The engine was located in the rear part of the hull. Early Soviet-made tank engines were of bad quality but they became better beginning in 1934. The T-26 (Armstrong Siddeley) engine {{did not have an}} over-speed limiter, which often resulted in overheating and engine valve breakage, especially in summer. A fuel tank for [...] and an <b>oil</b> <b>box</b> for [...] were placed alongside the engine. The engine required top-grade petrol; the use of second-rate petrol could cause damage to the valve units because of engine detonation. From mid-1932, a more capacious fuel tank (290 L instead of 182 L) and a simplified <b>oil</b> <b>box</b> were introduced. An engine cooling fan was mounted over the engine in a special shroud. From early 1932, the exhaust silencer was affixed by three clamps instead of two.|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinders}} {{were arranged}} outside the plate frames and the 6 in diameter trick-ported piston valves, designed for inside admission, were actuated by Walschaerts valve gear. Each engine unit {{was equipped with}} an independent Wakefield mechanical <b>lubricator</b> to supply <b>oil</b> to the valves and pistons.|$|R

50|$|Most Mamod engines lack <b>lubricators</b> {{to store}} <b>oil</b> and feed {{it to the}} moving parts such as the piston and bearings. The very early pre-war engines such as the SE3/4 {{and some of the}} marine engines (including the Meteor boat) were the only ones to have them. Instead, oil is applied {{manually}} to the necessary parts before each run.|$|R
50|$|George Cosmovici (1857 - 1920) was a Romanian {{mechanical}} engineer and inventor who between 1901 - 1920 {{was director of}} the service and traction workshop at Căile Ferate Române. He was the initiator of the European research on the dimensions of outbreaks and apparatus for burning heavy fuel oils. He built a model of original spray of fuel oil, used in locomotive outbreaks. In 1906 he invented the <b>oiling</b> <b>box</b> that continues to oil the railcar wheels, invention that was adapted to the Romanian Railways and rail network to other countries in Europe.|$|R

5000|$|The {{engine was}} very much based on the Rover 16's but the bore had been {{increased}} 2mm. There {{were a number of}} minor improvements. The water inlet pipe was now {{to the other side of}} the engine to provide better access to the valves and tappets. The <b>oil</b> <b>box</b> (reservoir) was now at the left rear of the engine so a catcher for oil thrown up by the flywheel is no longer necessary. Lubrication pipes had been mounted lower. There was a new partition between sump and clutch housing so oil was not thrown to the clutch. Rover's engine braking system was fitted, it has the ability to close the engine's valves.|$|R
5000|$|Shiell was {{a member}} of the Ó Siadhail family of Kingdom of Uí Failghe, who were {{prominent}} County Offaly and County Laois in the late medieval/early modern era. Shiell {{was a member}} of the Franciscan order, and became the guardian of the Franciscan friary at Killeigh, County Offaly, in 1693. In 1698, eight individuals signed a document acknowledging that they had received chalices, pyxes, cups, an <b>oil</b> <b>box,</b> ciborium, a bell and vestments of the friary for safekeeping. Michael Shiell was one of the eight signatories, as was one William Shiell, who received at least three of the items. Krasnodebska-D'Aughton states that [...] "both were probably members of the Ó Siadhail family, who had long associations with the Franciscans in the midlands." ...|$|R
50|$|Waste oil is {{used oil}} {{containing}} not only breakdown products but also impurities from use. Some examples of waste oil are used oils such as hydraulic oil, transmission oil, brake fluids, motor oil, crankcase <b>oil,</b> gear <b>box</b> <b>oil</b> and synthetic oil. Many {{of the same}} problems associated with natural petroleum exist with waste oil. When waste oil from vehicles drips out engines over streets and roads, the oil travels into the water table bringing with it such toxins as benzene. This poisons both soil and drinking water. Runoff from storms carries waste oil into rivers and oceans, poisoning them as well.|$|R

5000|$|The {{story begins}} when Mr Otis and family move into Canterville Chase, despite {{warnings}} from Lord Canterville {{that the house}} is haunted. Mr Otis says that he will take the furniture {{as well as the}} ghost at valuation. The Otis family includes Mr and Mrs Otis, their eldest son Washington, their daughter Virginia and the Otis twins. The other characters include the Canterville Ghost, the Duke of Cheshire (who wants to marry Virginia), Mrs Umney (the housekeeper), and Rev. Augustus Dampier. At first, none of the Otis family believe in ghosts, but shortly after they move in, none of them can deny the presence of Sir Simon de Canterville [...] The family hears clanking chains, they witness reappearing bloodstains [...] "on the floor just by the fireplace", which are removed every time they appear in various forms. But, humorously, none of these scare the Otis family in the least. In fact, upon hearing the clanking noises in the hallway, Mr Otis promptly gets out of bed and pragmatically offers the ghost Tammany Rising Sun <b>Lubricator</b> to <b>oil</b> his chains.|$|R
50|$|Lubrication of {{the first}} {{high-speed}} engines, such as the Ideal (an open-crank horizontal engine), were lubricated by a development of the oil cup systems previously widespread on medium-speed stationary engines. Oil cups and multi-point <b>lubricators</b> could <b>oil</b> shaft bearings well enough and a single sight-glass could be observed by even the most careless engine driver or oiler. The difficulty was that on high-speed engines, oilers {{could no longer be}} mounted on moving parts, such as the crosshead or connecting rod. Any oil reservoir here would be churned around by the movement and such a necessarily small reserve might also be inadequate incapacity for an engine doing so much work in a small space. More care was thus given to the thoroughness of oiling, and moving parts such as the crankpin were fed by drillings through the crankshaft from oil supplies that were rotating but not moving, such as the main bearings. Centrifugal force was also used to distribute the oil. It was usual that high-speed engines would have only one or two lubricators, so that engine tending was a simpler task and less prone to breakdowns from simple carelessness and running a lubricator dry.|$|R

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  1, {{the water and}} oil are {{initially}} arranged {{on the top of}} the silicon dioxide substrate and the oil cube is surrounded by three water cubes with different sizes. The oil cube has a dimension of 5 [*]×[*] 15 [*]×[*] 5  nm 3 and is located at the central part of the substrate. The dimensions of the left- and right-side water cubes are the same as that of the oil cube, while that of the top-side water cube is 15 [*]×[*] 15 [*]×[*] 5  nm 3. The number of water and decane molecules is determined by the sizes of the cubes and the water and oil densities under the condition of 300  K and 1  bar. The densities of water and oil are 1.000 and 0.725  g/cm 3, respectively; accordingly, the number of water and decane molecules is 58, 319 and 1150, respectively. The arrangement of molecules is implemented in the Material Studio software; originally, they are randomly distributed in the special boxes. Then, a calculation of energy minimization is conducted to optimize the molecular geometry. As the simulation reaches to an equilibrium state, the <b>oil</b> <b>box</b> evolves into a cylindrical droplet, while the three water boxes can merge together forming a continuous phase surrounding the oil droplet.|$|R

[...] Section 12-4.5 A (9) of the 2014 NASCAR rule book. On the Tuesday following the race, NASCAR announced that the No. 11 team of Joe Gibbs Racing - the car of Denny Hamlin, who had finished the race in third place - had been penalized for a rules infraction in post-race inspection. This infraction was levied as a P5 penalty - the second-highest level - outlined in Section 12-4.5 A (9) of the 2014 NASCAR rule book. Per the subsequent Section 12-4.5 B of the regulations, any P5 penalty resulted in a 50-point penalty for both the driver and team owner, a fine of between $75,000 and $125,000 as well as race suspension and probation periods for team members {{in relation to the}} infraction. As the infraction was detected during a post-race inspection, a further 25 championship points were deducted as well as a further fine of $50,000.|$|R

We describe here a study {{of members of the}} MADS box gene family in oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.), a representative of the family Arecaceae and order Arecales, a key group of monocotyledons which has been unreported in previous phylogenetic reconstructions of the different recognized clades of MADS box genes. In this study, 13 <b>oil</b> palm MADS <b>box</b> genes were identified and characterized.

Genes belonging to each of these groups {{play a critical role in}} the determination of flower structure as defined by the ABCDE model. The in planta expression profiles of the <b>oil</b> palm MADS <b>box</b> genes were studied by RT-PCR and phylogenetic sequence diversity within individual subfamilies was investigated by comparing their deduced protein sequences with those of other angiosperms. Most of the oil palm sequences studied were observed to group with distinct supported clades within their subfamily.

5000|$|... 1995 {{model year}} engines had three {{features}} that set {{them apart from}} later engines. The positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) system utilized a plastic <b>oil</b> separator <b>box</b> that was vented directly to the block itself; the breather hose and PCV valve hoses attached to the box, and connected to the induction system. Later engines featured a PCV system that was molded to the cylinder head valve cover. The second feature was internal in nature - the crankshaft main bearings were keyed into the bedplate on the right rear of each transverse web. Later model years featured keys machined on the right front of each web. These considerations are important when considering a rebuild or replacement of this engine. The third feature would be a slightly bigger camshaft that was changed on 1996 and up SOHC vehicles due to a rough idle when the air conditioning was on. This 1995 model year cam is now being sold by dealers as a power upgrade for 1996 and up SOHC engines, {{but it can also}} easily be found at salvage yards for a low price.|$|R
