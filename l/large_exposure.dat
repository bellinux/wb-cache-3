25|$|MMR is {{most useful}} at {{detecting}} tuberculosis {{infection in the}} asymptomatic phase, {{and it should be}} combined with tuberculin skin tests and clinical questioning in order to be more effective. The sharp increase in tuberculosis in all countries with <b>large</b> <b>exposure</b> to HIV is probably mandating a return of MMR as a screening tool focusing on high-risk populations, such as homosexuals and intravenous drug users. New advances in digital radiography, coupled with much lower x-ray dosages may herald better MMR technologies.|$|E

The surface area of the digestive tract is estimated to be about 32 square meters, or about half a badminton court. With such a <b>large</b> <b>exposure</b> (more than three times larger than the exposed surface of the skin), these immune components function to prevent pathogens from entering the blood and lymph circulatory systems. Fundamental components of this protection are provided by the intestinal mucosal barrier which is composed of physical, biochemical, and immune elements elaborated by the intestinal mucosa. Microorganisms also are kept at bay by an extensive immune system comprising the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{evidence of}} banks using accounting discretion to overstate {{the value of}} distressed assets. In particular, we show {{that the stock market}} applies far greater discounts to a bank’s real estate loans and mortgage-backed securities than are implicit in the book values of these assets, especially following the onset of the U. S. mortgage crisis. This suggests that bank balance sheets overvalue real estate related assets during economic slowdowns. Estimated discounts are smaller for distressed banks, as these banks derive relatively large benefits from the financial safety net to offset asset impairment. We also find that bank share prices, especially for banks with <b>large</b> <b>exposures</b> to mortgage-backed securities, react favorably to recent changes in accounting rules that relax fair value accounting. Banks with <b>large</b> <b>exposures</b> to mortgage-backed securities are also found to provision less for bad loans. Finally, we find that banks, and especially distressed banks, use discretion in the classification of mortgage-backed securities so as to inflate the book value of these securities. Our results provide several pieces of compelling evidence that banks’ balance sheets offer a distorted view of the financial health of the banks, especially for banks with <b>large</b> <b>exposures</b> to real estate loans and mortgage-backed securities, and suggest that recent changes that relax fair value accounting may further distort this picture. ...|$|R
