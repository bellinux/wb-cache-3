In the period 1991 - 2006, Slovenia introduced “Programmes of Integrated Rural Development and Village Renewal” and “Development Programmes for Rural Areas”, which were quite similar to the LEADER initiative in theEuropean Union. From the 2007 - 2013 programming period, the <b>LEADER</b> <b>approach</b> has been mainstreamed within the overall EU {{rural development}} policy. This means that LEADER is included in national and regional rural development programmes supported by the EU,alongside a range of other rural development axes.

Major attention is paid to the <b>LEADER</b> <b>approach,</b> with the objective of evaluating the implementation of the principles in the activities of actors associated with Czech LAGs. Techniques of content analysis and interviews with selected representatives, mainly with managers of LAGs, were used for sociological empirical research. The results analyse concrete clashes between the hierarchic structure and the principle of network co-operation, which is starting to develop successfully at state-wide and international levels. Next, the results point out the failures in the implementation of the <b>LEADER</b> <b>approach</b> in the Czech Republic which have been overcome (linked with the principles of recourse from locality, decentralised management and financing, partnership) and, on the contrary, those which are still ongoing (linked with principles of integration of sectors, innovativeness).
