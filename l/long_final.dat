With this he took 4/45 in the first innings, described vividly by Margaret Hughes [...] "Harvey received a beast of a ball from Tyson which spat {{up at him and}} splashed off his bat to Cowdrey".

2500|$|The MCC {{continued}} {{south to}} play Victoria in Adelaide. Hutton won the toss {{and decided to}} bat with Trevor Bailey as his opening partner. This made sense in that [...] "Barnacle Bailey" [...] was a negative stonewaller and unlikely to give his wicket away, but it robbed the lower order of its sheet-anchor. In 1958-59 Ashes series {{he would be the}} regular opener and was blamed for paralysing the England batting with his slow scoring, though this was hardly his fault. On this occasion he made 60 and put on 97 with Hutton (41) before both were removed by the veteran all-rounder Sam Loxton (2/54). Nobody bettered his analysis though three others took 2 wickets, but Len Maddocks took three catches and ran out Colin Cowdrey for 79. Tom Graveney made 48 as the MCC were out for 312 on the rain affected second day. Taking advice from his old coach Alf Gover, who was in Australia as a journalist covering the series, Tyson stopped using his laborious 38 yard run up and returned to the [...] "short" [...] 18 yard run up he had used for Knypersley in the Staffordshire League with ten short then ten <b>long</b> <b>final</b> strides. Tyson took 6/68 in three over bursts when Victoria replied with 277, five of them clean bowled. It would have been 8/68, but Johnny Wardle dropped John Chambers (42) because he was singing a Bing Crosby song and Sam Loxton feathered a thin edge to Godfrey Evans, but was given not out. Neil Harvey had failed in every game against the tourists so far, except in the Test, and was playing and missing constantly on his way to 59. A construction worker on the ground shouted [...] "Typhoon! Bowl 'im down a piano! P'rhaps 'e can play that!". The Hutton-Bailey partnership added only 26, but Peter May made a sterling 105 not out and added 120 with Colin Cowdrey (54) and the innings was declared on 236/5 after the third day was lost. Just as important the Victoria and Australia captain Ian Johnson pulled a muscle while fielding and missed the Second Test as a result. Loxton took 2/67 and Maddocks and took two more catches to strengthen his claims for the Australian gloves. Victoria batted out the game for 88/3, but Colin McDonald retired hurt on before scoring a run due to an undisclosed ailment.|$|E
2500|$|In League, University and Army cricket Tyson {{had used}} a 'short' run up of 18 or 20 yards {{consisting}} of ten short steps and ten <b>long</b> <b>final</b> strides to the wicket. When he moved to first class cricket this increased to 38 yards, starting near the sightscreen and over 200 feet from the wicket-keeper, who was often reduced to an athletic long stop. With a final leap to the wicket he released the ball with a high arm action and a heave of his shoulders, 'the ferocity of his delivery' was described as 'every muscle is in use, the right foot takes the strain, the right arm is straight ready for delivery and the left leg kicks out menacingly'. Australian newspapers had accused Tyson of dragging his right foot over the popping crease on the 1954–55 tour and an English newspaper responded; [...] "Will Tyson be [...] "sacrificed" [...] to avoid any risk of giving the Australians a chance to scream that Tyson persistently bowls no-balls by foot-drag over the crease?" [...] with pictures of his bowling action. In the match between the Victoria and the M.C.C he was photographed dragging his foot 18 inches past the crease, but Pat Crawford of New South Wales was photographed with his foot 36 inches over the crease. The caption reading [...] "Oh Tyson. You are an Angel compared to Pat!" [...] An enterprising Sydney newspaper paid Harold Larwood {{to give his name}} to an article declaring [...] "Replay Tests – Tyson Not Fair". Unlike the great swing [...] bowler Fred Trueman he 'bowled straight and...never intentionally bowled an out-swinger. Instead Tyson relied on his tremendous pace to take most of his wickets, batsmen were often caught in mid-stroke by the speed of the ball coming onto the bat, or were too nervous to play fluently. On a green or crumbling wicket providing movement he could simply blast his way through the batting, and produced bounce and pace even off the placid Northamptonshire wickets. Tyson believed that a bouncer should 'pin the batsman against the sightscreen' and frequently used them to intimidate batsmen, even tailenders His ungainly action and quest for raw speed took a toll on even his strong body and he suffered from a series of injuries which brought a premature end to his career. In 1994 he had operations to his right arm and knees and a further operation on his knees in 2001 rendered him practically immobile for a short time. As he put it himself [...] "to bowl fast is to revel in the glad animal action, to thrill in physical power and to enjoy a sneaking feeling of superiority over the mortals who play the game". However, he was no simple bowler, but thought hard how to dismiss and deceive batsman. John Arlott wrote [...] "This was intelligence, rhythm and strength merged into the violent craft of fast bowling" [...] and [...] "He is intelligent beyond the usual run of fast bowlers: he is the type of cricketer whom improves rapidly through thinking about the game".|$|E
