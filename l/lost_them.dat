Leicester are joint equal with Manchester City for having won the most English second tier titles (7). The club has reached four FA Cup finals, yet <b>lost</b> <b>them</b> all.

5|$|The {{fore and}} hind wings {{are similar in}} shape, being long and narrow, with {{numerous}} cross-veins, and somewhat resembling those of primitive insects such as mayflies. A few genera, however, have reduced wings, or have <b>lost</b> <b>them</b> altogether. The abdomen is cylindrical with eleven segments, {{the first of which}} is fused to the metathorax. The cerci consist of one or two segments. The abdomen typically curves upwards in the male, superficially resembling the tail of a scorpion, the tip containing an enlarged structure called the genital bulb.|$|E

Reporting to the Army for World War II service, he suited up for the Cornwall Flyers of the Quebec Senior Hockey League (QSHL) for three seasons (the team was renamed Cornwall Army in 1942). He was traded to the Washington Lions of the American Hockey League in 1941, but did not report.|$|E

They held the titles for three months, having {{successful}} titles defenses against the teams of Mysterio and Guerrero and Hardcore Holly and Charlie Haas, before dropping them to the new Legion of Doom (LOD) at The Great American Bash in July 2005. They recaptured the titles in a four-way match defeating The Mexicools, William Regal and Paul Burchill, and LOD, but <b>lost</b> <b>them</b> to Mysterio and Batista days before the Armageddon pay-per-view in December.

5|$|Pugliese {{then joined}} the Buffalo, New York-based National Wrestling Federation (NWF). Once again, he found success teaming with Dominic DeNucci. The pair competed {{in a tournament}} for the vacant NWF World Tag Team Championship in January 1972; they {{made it to the}} final round but lost to the team of Mitsu Arakawa and Yoshino Sato. Pugliese and DeNucci {{continued}} to challenge for the title, and they defeated Arakawa and Sato in March to win the belts. They dropped the belts to Don and Johnny Fargo in May but regained them in a rematch the same month. Later that month, however, the Fargos regained the belts. Pugliese and DeNucci were unable to regain them, but Pugliese teamed up with Luis Martinez to win the title in December. Records are unclear as to whom they won the belts from and how they <b>lost</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|Late in 1991, Paul E. Dangerously {{formed the}} faction The Dangerous Alliance. Eaton {{joined the group}} when he {{assisted}} Rick Rude, whom Dangerously had (kayfabe) brought into WCW, in defeating Sting for the United States Championship. In joining the group, Eaton became allies with Rude, Larry Zbyszko, and his two former rivals for the World Television Championship in Arn Anderson and Steve Austin. Shortly after the group was formed, Anderson and Eaton became its tag team specialists. This seemed to make sense, as both men had been successful tag team wrestlers in their careers; Anderson himself had been a two-time world champion teaming with Tully Blanchard in the Four Horsemen and had also won the belts with Zbyszko earlier in the year. Eaton and Anderson quickly won the WCW World Tag Team Championship by defeating Ricky Steamboat and Dustin Rhodes, the team to whom Anderson and Zbyszko lost the belts, for the championship and {{held on to the}} belts for five months before they <b>lost</b> <b>them</b> to the Steiner Brothers.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{practical}} function of striping {{has not been}} determined for zebras in general, it is unclear why the quagga lacked stripes on its hind parts. A cryptic function for protection from predators (stripes obscure the individual zebra in a herd) and biting flies (which are less attracted to striped objects), as well as various social functions, have been proposed for zebras in general. Differences in hind quarter stripes may have aided species recognition during stampedes of mixed herds, so that members of one subspecies or species would follow its own kind. It has also been evidence that the zebras developed striping patterns as thermoregulation to cool themselves down, and that the quagga <b>lost</b> <b>them</b> due to living in a cooler climate, although one problem with {{this is that the}} mountain zebra lives in similar environments and has a bold striping pattern. A 2014 study strongly supported the biting-fly hypothesis, and the quagga appears to have lived in areas with lesser amounts of fly activity compared to other zebras.|$|E
5|$|Wrestling in Tennessee in 1977, LeDuc {{teamed with}} Bob Armstrong {{to win the}} NWA Southeast Tag Team Championship in September. They were put over Bob Orton, Jr. and Mr. Knoxville for the belts but <b>lost</b> <b>them</b> in a rematch. While in Tennessee, LeDuc gained notoriety from a worked feud with Jerry Lawler. Wrestling as a heel, he faced Jerry Lawler, who was a {{favorite}} in the state, in many matches throughout the year. LeDuc was placed with a new partner, Jean Louie, to win the NWA Mid-America Southern Tag Team Championship in May. They faced Lawler and Jimmy Valiant on May 22 to defend the belts, but the match was declared a no contest and the title was vacated. Lawler and Valiant won the belts in a rematch the following week, but LeDuc and Louie regained them the following month. In September, LeDuc and Louie dropped the belts once again, this time to Lawler and the Mongolian Stomper.|$|E
