40|$|When using Built-In Self Test (BIST) {{for testing}} VLSI circuits, {{a major concern}} is the {{generation}} of proper test patterns that detect the faults of interest. Usually a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) is used to generate test patterns. We first analyze the probability that an arbitrary pseudo-random test sequence of short length detects all faults. The term short is relative to the probability of detecting the fault with the fewest test patterns. We then show how to guide the search for an initial state (seed) for a LFSR with a given primitive feedback polynomial {{so that all the}} faults of interest are detected by a minimum length test sequence. Our algorithm is based on finding the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> patterns in the sequence generated by this LFSR. This is accomplished using the theory of discrete logarithms. We then select the shortest subsequence that includes test patterns for all the faults of interest, hence resulting in 100 % fault coverage...|$|E

40|$|Seven {{years of}} multi-environment yield trials of navy bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) grown in Queensland were examined. As is common with plant {{breeding}} evaluation trials, test entries and locations varied between years. Grain yield data were analysed {{for each year}} using cluster and ordination analyses (pattern analyses). These methods facilitate descriptions of genotype performance across environments and the discrimination among genotypes provided by the environments. The observed trends for genotypic yield performance across environments were partly consistent with agronomic and disease reactions at specific environments and also partly explainable by breeding and selection history. In some cases, similarities in discrimination among environments were related to geographic proximity, in others management practices, and in others similarities occurred between geographically widely separated environments which differed in management practices. One location was identified as having atypical line discrimination. The analysis indicated {{that the number of}} test locations was below requirements for adequate representation of line x environment interaction. The pattern analyses methods used were an effective aid in describing the patterns in data for each year and illustrated the variations in adaptive patterns from year to year. The study has implications for assessing the number and <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> sites for plant breeding multi-environment trials, and for the understanding of genetic traits contributing to line x environment interactions...|$|E
40|$|Background: When {{a second}} sound follows a long first sound, its {{location}} {{appears to be}} perceived away from the first one (the localization/lateralization aftereffect). This aftereffect has often been considered to reflect an efficient neural coding of sound locations in the auditory system. To understand determinants of the localization aftereffect, the current study examined whether it is induced by an interaural temporal difference (ITD) in the amplitude envelope of high frequency transposed tones (over 2 kHz), which is known {{to function as a}} sound localization cue. Methodology/Principal Findings: In Experiment 1, participants were required to adjust the position of a pointer to the perceived <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> stimuli before and after adaptation. Test and adapter stimuli were amplitude modulated (AM) sounds presented at high frequencies and their positional differences were manipulated solely by the envelope ITD. Results showed that the adapter’s ITD systematically affected the perceived position of test sounds to the directions expected from the localization/lateralization aftereffect when the adapter was presented at 6600 ms ITD; a corresponding significant effect was not observed for a 0 ms ITD adapter. In Experiment 2, the observed adapter effect was confirmed using a forced-choice task. It was also found that adaptation to the AM sounds at high frequencies did not significantly change the perceived position of pure-tone test stimuli in the low frequency region (128 and 256 Hz). Conclusions/Significance: The findings in the current study indicate that ITD in the envelope at high frequencies induce...|$|E
40|$|Current study “Conditioning between visual {{stimulus}} and caffeine-induced arousal state” explores {{the effect of}} a visual shape as a conditioned stimulus associated to the drug induced state on sensory thresholds. It was found that presenting the above-threshold shape conditioned to caffeine had no effect on sensory thresholds as measured by perception of a weak test stimulus. It was concluded that designing a conditioned association between caffeine state and seeing a simple geometric shape is either impossible or considerably complicated, so that four 20 -minute sessions do not suffice. It is possible that using some other type of cognitive task (e. g. attention or working memory tasks under some perceptual conditions) this kind of association may develop. This would require thorough research, in which the experimental task’s efficiency-promoting processes would be more sensitive to the effect of caffeine. It is also possible that 200 mg of caffeine is not a sufficient dose for prompting a noticeable effect on sensory thresholds. A surprising result was recorded when the effect of the conditioning-stimulus was considered – for some reason circle shaped stimulus facilitated the detection of near-threshold stimuli compared to the square shaped stimulus. This is an intriguing result which requires additional experimentation to verify whether this is an effect of the shape or the effect of the perceptual attributes associated with the shape (e. g., diameter, number of elementary features in the shape, average distance of the form’s boundary line from the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> stimulus etc) ...|$|E

40|$|Waves {{spawned by}} the nozzle in the NASA Ames 60 MW Interaction Heating Facility arc jet were {{experimentally}} observed in pressure surveys {{at the exit}} of the nozzle. The waves have been seen in past CFD simulations, but were away from the region where models were tested (for the existing nozzles). However, a recent test series with a new nozzle extension (229 mm exit diameter) revealed that these waves intersect the centerline of the jet {{in a region where}} it is desirable to put test articles, and that the waves may be contributing to non-uniform recession behavior seen in Teflon (trademark) sublimation test articles tested in this new nozzle. It is reasonable to assume the ablation recession of thermal protection models will also be nonuniform due to exposure to these waves. This work shows that ablation response is sensitive to the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> samples in the free jet relative to the location of the wave interaction, and that the issues with these waves can be avoided by choosing an optimum position for a test article in the free jet. This work describes the experimental observations along with the CFD simulations that have identified the waves emanating from the nozzle, as well as the instrumentation used to detect them. The work describes a recommended solution, derived by CFD analysis, which if implemented, should significantly reduce these flow disturbance and pressure anomalies in future nozzles...|$|E
40|$|The {{atmospheric}} delay due to vertical stratification, {{the so-called}} stratified atmospheric delay, {{has a great}} impact on both interferometric and absolute range measurements. In our current researches [1][2][3], centimeter-range accuracy has been proven based on Corner Reflector (CR) based measurements by applying atmospheric delay correction using the Zenith Path Delay (ZPD) corrections derived from nearby Global Positioning System (GPS) stations. For a global usage, an effective method has been introduced to estimate the stratified delay based on global 4 -dimensional Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) products: the direct integration method [4][5]. Two products, ERA-Interim and operational data, provided by European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) are used to integrate the stratified delay. In order to access the integration accuracy, a validation approach is investigated based on ZPD derived from six permanent GPS stations located in different meteorological conditions. Range accuracy at centimeter level is demonstrated using both ECMWF products. Further experiments have been carried out {{in order to determine the}} best interpolation method by analyzing the temporal and spatial correlation of atmospheric delay using both ECMWF and GPS ZPD. Finally, the integrated atmospheric delays in slant direction (Slant Path Delay, SPD) have been applied instead of the GPS ZPD for CR experiments at three different test sites with more than 200 TerraSAR-X High Resolution SpotLight (HRSL) images. The delay accuracy is around 1 - 3 cm depending on the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> site due to the local water vapor variation and the acquisition time/date...|$|E
40|$|Bibliography: pages 169 - 178. Two {{independent}} {{investigations into}} aspects of marine fouling {{were conducted in}} Simonsbay and Table Bay during 1979 to 1981. The development of macrofouling communities on six test materials was examined at 10 m and 20 m depths in Simonsbay for periods ranging from one month to one year. Community development was similar on inert non-reactive materials, aluminium, stainless steel, fibre glass and polyvinylchloride, but was reduced on non-wettable silicon rubber and corrodible mild steel. Macrofouling was characterized by seasonal succession with minimum colonization rates during winter, when adverse weather and low temperature conditions prevailed. The nature of fouling differed with depth. At 10 m depth, mussel and barnacle-dominated communities developed rapidly, while at 20 m depth, ascidian and barnacle-dominated communities developed more slowly. The role of primary film formation in the colonization of substrata by invertebrates was investigated in short-term studies conducted in Simonsbay and Table Bay. Surface-bound antibiotics, streptomycin and penicillin, were used to inhibit bacterial proliferation, while a herbicide, diuron, was employed to prevent diatom growth. The colonization by invertebrates was monitored on these surfaces and compared to surfaces where primary film development was normal, or where it was advanced by pre-culturing in laboratory seawater. It was found that invertebrates attached soon after panel exposure and that differences {{in the degree of}} primary film development were of little consequence to their settlement. The apparent discrepancy of these observations with previous findings is discussed, with special reference to the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> sites in relation to mature communities...|$|E

40|$|Tijekom lipnja 2011. nastavljena su istraživanja na rimskoj vili smještenoj u uvali Soline otoka Sv. Klement zapadno od grada Hvara (otoka Hvara). Tri sonde istražene su do živca, a kao sastavni dio interdisciplinarnog pristupa istraživanju ove rimske vile izvršena je i arhitektonska analiza novotkrivene arhitekture, analiza statike i stanja vidljivih zidova, te geološki pregled terena. During June of 2011 the {{investigations}} of the Roman villa located in Soline Bay {{on the island of}} St. Clement (Sv. Klement near Hvar) continued in its fifth season. Researchers from four institutions (Hvar Heritage Museum, Institute of Archaeology, University of St. Thomas, Institute of Archaeology at the University of Graz) collaborated on the project, with a number of student and volunteer participants. As part of the interdisciplinary research three probes (4, 5 and 6) were excavated, an architectural analysis of the uncovered structures was conducted and the condition of the standing architecture was analyzed. In addition, a geologist surveyed the site and analyzed mortar from the walls and floors. The <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> probes was based on the data obtained by the magnetometric survey in 2010. The objective was to document and clarify spatial and stratigraphic relationship between different periods of construction in three targeted areas. Probe 4 was an expansion of Probe 2 from 2010, where 17 stratigraphic units were documented. The expected north continuation of wall B was found only in its foundation of late antique construction. There was a segment of a thick floor made of Roman waterproof mortar abutting the wall foundation. An 18 cm-long section of a lead pipe was found inserted in the wall under that floor. The probe was obviously located within a room of the late antique phase of the villa. The expected wall of an earlier phase was not found, only the bedrock. Probe 5 was an expansion of Probe 3 from 2010, located east of the long wall B, where seven stratigraphic units were recorded above the bedrock, but no walls were found. Probe 6 was set up to the west of wall B, where the magnetometry indicated a north-south wall parallel with that wall (c. 12. 5 m apart) and several rooms lined up along that wall. We attempted to uncover one of those rooms. Fourteen stratigraphic units were documented. Probe 6 was the only trench that confirmed the results of the 2010 magnetometry, with the finding of an E-W wall and partial interior of a room. The eastern half of the probe yielded a floor made of chipped stone in lime mortar of an undetermined, perhaps late-antique date. The soil fill below was the first closed deposit found at the site. It contained small pottery fragments dating from the late Hellenistic period and some sherds of Gnathia ware. The western part of the probe was outside the room. Further excavation in this area must continue the next season in order to uncover the entire room and to clarify its function and any phases of construction and transformation. Pottery fragments, mostly small and poorly preserved, predominated among the finds from this season. They could be dated between the late Hellenistic period and Late Antiquity, with a few later fragments. We documented 23 special finds of pottery, metal and glass...|$|E
40|$|Osteoarthritis (OA) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{musculoskeletal}} diseases, mainly affecting people over the age of 60. This disease has multiple symptoms which include wear and loss of articular cartilage and debilitating pain. Its initiation and progression is not well understood and, at the moment, there is no cure. It is important that efforts are made to understand OA because as global life expectancy increases, diseases which affect the ageing population will become more predominant. However, before it is possible to understand what happens to cartilage in the diseased state, the interaction of cartilage structure, mechanical properties and external stimuli in healthy cartilage must be characterised first. The knee joint is commonly affected by OA. Knee OA is often unicompartmental (UKOA), occurring in either the medial or lateral compartment alone. The location of the lesions in UKOA has been observed to be very repeatable among patients. We believe that this could be explained by variations in cartilage properties over articular surfaces coupled with loading patterns. The distribution of material properties, glycosaminoglycans(GAG) concentration and cartilage thickness in healthy cartilage on six porcine tibial plateaux were examined. Approximately 1000 measurements were taken of in-situ mechanical properties of articular cartilage-on-bone through indentation using a novel mechanical testing machine on whole specimens. The Whole Articular Surface Indentation Machine (WASIM) possesses 5 degrees of freedom (DOF) and allows the interchange of several probes such as an indenter (hemisphercal with 1. 35 mm radius), high resolution laser and ultrasound (US). The three dimensional geometry of articular surfaces were obtained by laser scanning. Routines were developed to analyse this topography, automatically calculate the surface normals and then rotate the specimen relative to the indenter; normal indentation was performed at every test point (displacement controlled, 10 percent per second (pps) strain rate). GAG concentrations in cartilage plugs (4 mm) were obtained using DMMB and an imaging method which combined a cationic contrast agent with fluoroscopy. Mechanical properties (elasticity modulus) were found to vary between 1 and 40 MPa depending on the spatial location of the test points on the articular surface. The differences in elasticity moduli between regions on the tibial plateaux correspond to the position of the meniscus and load-bearing areas. Central areas on each tibial compartment were found to have the highest stiffness, while peripheral areas, as well as areas uncovered by the meniscus were found to have a lower stiffness. Concentrations of GAG were found to be between 1 and 20 Î¼ g/mg depending on the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> points. Overall, results showed heterogeneous distribution of elastic modulus, GAG concentration and cartilage thickness in terms of their spatial location over the tibial plateaux. Repeatable patterns were observed between all of the six tested specimens. These patterns were correlated to the position of the menisci, which lead to grouping parameters in regions. Region analysis showed inverse correlations (r) between GAG concentration and elastic modulus (- 0. 1 < r <- 0. 6), and direct correlation between GAG concentration and cartilage thickness (0. 1 < r < 0. 6) across specimens. Finally, an analysis of the gradient changes in the mechanical properties over the tibial plateaux showed that steep gradients (i. e. relatively large changes in stiffness) occurred in locations that are associated with UKOA lesion locations in human joints. This work provides insight into the variation, distribution and correlation of mechanical properties, GAG concentration and cartilage thickness in healthy cartilage. Additionally, a testing device which can automatically scan and rotate uneven surfaces to allow normal indentation was introduced. This machine has the potential to measure mechanical properties and biological composition at the same test points in whole specimens, and therefore create distribution maps of different parameters. Further work needs to be carried out on healthy human articular cartilage to assess whether similar patterns are found. Also, implementation of these methods can be used to assess deterioration at different stages of disease. </p...|$|E
