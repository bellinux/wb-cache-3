5|$|The <b>logic</b> <b>board,</b> {{the central}} circuit {{board of the}} computer, {{was based on the}} Macintosh SE design. Its size, however, was reduced using surface mount {{technology}} to 9×5inches (23×13cm), half the size of the SE board. This redesign, and the absence of expansion slots, kept manufacturing costs low. This lack of expansion abilities, along with the small screen size and Macintosh's popularity in the burgeoning field of desktop publishing led to such oddities as video displays that connected through the SCSI port by users seeking to connect a larger full- or dual-page display to their Mac. The Classic design was used once more in 1991 for the Classic II, which succeeded the Classic and replaced the Macintosh SE/30.|$|E
5|$|When the {{computer}} was not in use, contents of the memory were preserved {{as long as the}} main lead-acid battery remained charged. The PowerBook100 Power Manager was an integrated circuit, usually placed on the <b>logic</b> <b>board</b> of a PowerBook, and was responsible for the power management of {{the computer}}. Identical to that of the Macintosh Portable, it controlled the display's backlight, hard drive spin-down, sleep and wake, battery charging, trackball control, and input/output (I/O). The 100 did add a new feature: 3.5V batteries backed up permanent and expansion random access memory (RAM) when the PowerBook100's battery was being replaced or when the 100 was otherwise temporarily removed from all power sources. This made it a perfect candidate for use with Apple's RAM disk to help increase battery life by accessing the hard disk less frequently, since the 100 was the only PowerBook that maintained the contents of RAM on shutdown in order to reduce startup time.|$|E

25|$|The {{address bus}} of the PowerPC 603 can {{theoretically}} access memory up to 64 MB. However, the operating system's maximum addressable memory size is 37 MB. Furthermore, {{because of the}} ASIC design of the Pippin hardware, the maximum RAM size that can be added is 32 MB. Officially, Bandai produced memory upgrade modules of 2, 4, 8 and 16 MB. The memory chips are soldered onto {{a printed circuit board}} which is placed in a plastic housing, making installation into a Pippin system simple for the end user. Japanese hackers produced an aftermarket 16 MB module, but because the module was much larger than the memory module compartment on the Pippin, installation required removing the <b>logic</b> <b>board</b> from the chassis, and then mounting the large memory module in-between the <b>logic</b> <b>board</b> and chassis.|$|E
25|$|In early 1994, Bandai {{approached}} Apple {{with the}} gaming console idea. The original design {{was based on}} a Macintosh Classic II 16MHz Motorola 68030 running Macintosh system software. Apple's involvement would be to define the initial <b>logic</b> <b>board</b> design, and Bandai would provide the casing and packaging. This was considered the fastest delivery solution to market at a very reasonable return on investment for both Apple and Bandai.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the Mac Mini G4, the Intel-based Mac Mini uses a dual-channel {{architecture}} for memory. The original Intel-based Mac Mini uses 667MHz DDR2 SDRAM, while models {{starting with}} the early 2009 revision use 1066MHz DDR3 SDRAM. From the 2011 revision onwards, the Mac Mini supports up to 16GB of memory. While all versions of the Mac Mini {{up to and including}} the 2012 revision supports user upgradeable memory after purchase, the current model does not, because the memory is soldered to the <b>logic</b> <b>board.</b> Since the integrated graphics processor does not have its own dedicated memory, the system shares some of the main system memory with it.|$|E
50|$|The Macintosh LC 580 {{was sold}} in 1995 and 1996. Like its {{immediate}} predecessor, the LC 575, it used the Motorola 68LC040 processor at 33 MHz. However, instead of using the same sized, SCSI only, <b>logic</b> <b>boards</b> based on the LC 475/Quadra 605 like the 575 series was, the 580s use the larger <b>logic</b> <b>boards</b> of the Performa 630 series. This meant a few changes, most of them leading to lower prices, but also lower performance: Most notably, the hard drives of the 580 were IDE drives instead of SCSI drives. Also, the video RAM was no longer mounted on a SIMM, but used 1 MB of the 4 MB of main RAM soldered to the motherboard. Lastly, the Trinitron display of the 575 was replaced with a cheaper shadow mask screen, causing a slight change in the plastic case surrounding the CRT. One benefit of this change was the ability to accommodate the same video capture and TV tuner cards designed for the Performa 630. This allowed LC 580 users to watch and record video, essentially performing the function of a television {{as well as a}} computer.|$|R

The prototype was mounted in a full size show-ready slot machine cabinet. The first production units went on trial in the Las Vegas Hilton Hotel. After some [...] "cheat-proofing" [...] modifications, the video slot machine {{was approved by the}} Nevada State Gaming Commission and eventually found popularity in the Las Vegas Strip and downtown casinos.

25|$|The Macintosh's minimal memory became apparent, even {{compared}} with other personal computers in 1984, {{and could not be}} expanded easily. It also lacked a hard disk drive or the means to easily attach one. Many small companies sprang up to address the memory issue. Suggestions revolved around either upgrading the memory to 512 KB or removing the computer's 16 memory chips and replacing them with larger-capacity chips, a tedious and difficult operation. In October 1984, Apple introduced the Macintosh 512K, with quadruple the memory of the original, at a price of US$3,195. It also offered an upgrade for 128k Macs that involved replacing the <b>logic</b> <b>board.</b>|$|E
25|$|When the <b>logic</b> <b>board</b> of a {{hard disk}} fails, the drive can often be {{restored}} to functioning order and the data recovered by replacing the circuit board with one of an identical hard disk. In the case of read-write head faults, they can be replaced using specialized tools in a dust-free environment. If the disk platters are undamaged, they can be transferred into an identical enclosure and the data can be copied or cloned onto a new drive. In the event of disk-platter failures, disassembly and imaging of the disk platters may be required. For logical damage to file systems, a variety of tools, including fsck on UNIX-like systems and CHKDSK on Windows, {{can be used for}} data recovery. Recovery from logical damage can require file carving.|$|E
25|$|By early 1985 much Macintosh {{software}} required 512K of memory. Apple sold {{an official}} memory upgrade for the Macintosh 128K, {{which included a}} motherboard replacement effectively making it a Macintosh 512K, {{for the price of}} US $995. Additionally, Apple offered an 800KB floppy disk drive kit, including updated 128K ROMs. Finally, a Mac 128K could be upgraded to a Macintosh Plus by swapping the <b>logic</b> <b>board</b> as well as the case back (to accommodate the slightly different port configuration) and optionally adding the Macintosh Plus extended keyboard. Any of the kits could be purchased alone or together at any time, for a partial or full upgrade for the Macintosh 128K. All upgrades were required to be performed by professional Apple technicians, who reportedly refused to work on any Macintosh upgraded to 512K without Apple's official upgrade, which at US$700 was much more expensive than about $300 for third-party versions.|$|E

5000|$|The Power Macintosh 5200 LC was {{introduced}} in April 1995 with a PowerPC 603 CPU at 75 MHz as a PowerPC-based replacement of the Macintosh LC 500 series. Later models switched to the PowerPC 603e CPU and used model numbers above 5260, but kept the same motherboard design. Unlike previous education models, which prepended the model number with [...] "LC", the 5200 series uses the Power Macintosh designation of Apple's main workstation line {{of the time and}} appends the LC {{to the end of the}} model name. All models in the 5xxx series featured an integrated 15-inch (12.8" [...] viewable) monitor. The 5200 series is closely related to the 6200 series, which features the same <b>logic</b> <b>boards</b> in desktop cases without integrated monitors. This means that it also shares the 6200's massive and confusing number of model designations.|$|R
5000|$|Logic {{circuits}} {{tend to do}} sudden switching (an ideal {{logic circuit}} would switch from low voltage to high voltage instantaneously, with no middle voltage ever observable). So <b>logic</b> circuit <b>boards</b> often have a decoupling capacitor close to each logic IC connected from each power supply connection to a nearby ground. These capacitors decouple every IC from every other IC in terms of supply voltage dips.|$|R
25|$|Apple {{encouraged}} hardware {{developers to}} produce PCI compatible peripherals {{that could be}} added to the Pippin. The only official method of producing add-ons for the Pippin was by developing PCI-compatible devices, and then placed in a docking station cabinet. A proprietary riser card interface (referred to by Apple as an X-PCI slot) is located on the bottom of a Pippin system, and is used by docking stations. A docking station for a Pippin can contain a variety of hardware, such as SCSI or floppy disk drive controllers, video interfaces, codecs, or network interfaces such as Ethernet. The <b>logic</b> <b>board</b> passes PCI signals through the X-PCI docking interface, and then to the docking station. Docking stations within the Pippin line do not provide pass-through support, thereby limiting a Pippin system to use only one docking station at one time. For example, a docking station for a floppy disk drive would need to be removed in order to attach a docking station for the magneto optical drive. Katz Media produced a generic docking station, containing a PCI slot, allowing a user to install PCI cards. No PCI-based peripherals were ever developed specifically for the Pippin.|$|E
500|$|Touchscreen control {{components}} on iPhone 6 logic boards have insufficient support, including {{a lack of}} underfill—which strengthens and stabilizes integrated circuits, {{and a lack of}} rigid metal shielding on the <b>logic</b> <b>board</b> unlike previous iPhone models; the touchscreen controller is instead shielded by a flexible [...] "sticker". Normal use of the device can cause the <b>logic</b> <b>board</b> to flex internally, which strains the touchscreen IC connectors and leads to a degradation or outright loss of touchscreen functionality.

Thus, efficient trigger on muons in data taking and understanding its performance are crucial to perform these physics studies. At LHC high rejection power against large backgrounds, while maintaining high efficiency for rare signal events, is required for online selection at the trigger level.
