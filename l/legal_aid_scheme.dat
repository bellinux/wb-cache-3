40|$|<b>Legal</b> <b>aid</b> {{programs}} {{have been set up}} in some Chinese areas since the early 1990 s {{to make it possible for}} poor people to get access to lawyers and representation. <b>Legal</b> <b>aid</b> involves very recent developments and evolution in the Chinese legal system that are of great importance to the understanding of Chinese society in transition. In the process of making transition to a market economy, the PRC has experienced a tremendous increase in lawsuits and hence the need for prefessional services. With their rapid increase in numbers, the PRC legal professionals are playing a getting-more-active role in the Chinese society. By offering free legal services to the poor, they try to project a positive social image in the PRC. <b>Legal</b> <b>aid</b> also represents the PRC authority's effort to attain social stability and expand human rights. <b>Legal</b> <b>aid</b> proposals reflect the authority's consideration of the role that law and lawyers might play in maintaining social stability and burnishing its human rights record. Besides exploring the dynamics of the PRC <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> practices, the thesis surveys the <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> programs in Hunan Province and five cities, namely Beijing, Guangzhou, Qingdao, Shanghai and Wuhan, and discusses major challenges to the PRC legal profession and government authorities when implementing <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> <b>schemes.</b> Based on survey results, the author prosposes a <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> framework. It is concluded that the legal profession will project a positive social image and thus form an increasingly influential group in the PRC by getting involved in <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> services to the poor people, and <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> <b>schemes</b> will cover a variety of cases that affect the quotidian rights of ordinary people, and their implications for human rights should in no way be underplayed...|$|R

50|$|Prior to the mid-20th century, {{literature}} on <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> emphasised collective enforcement of economic, {{social and cultural}} rights. As classic welfare states {{were built in the}} 1940s and following World War II, an underlying principle was that citizens had collective responsibility for economic, social and cultural rights; and the state assumed responsibility for those unable to provide for themselves through illness and unemployment. The enforcement of economic, social and cultural rights was to be collective, through policies rather than individual legal action. Laws were enacted to support welfare provisions, though these were regarded as laws for planners, not lawyers. <b>Legal</b> <b>aid</b> <b>schemes</b> were established, as it was assumed that the state had a responsibility to assist those engaged in legal disputes, but they initially focused primarily on family law and divorce.|$|R

40|$|This paper explores a linked set {{of contradictions}} – {{some of which}} verge on paradox – about <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> (defined for this purpose as ‘legal {{assistance}} funded by the state for indigent suspects and defendants’). These are: • The right to <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> is a ‘hybrid’ right {{in the sense that}} it imposes a positive obligation of funding on the state, akin to an economic right, although it is an integral part of the civil and political right to a fair trial. • <b>Legal</b> <b>aid,</b> now enshrined in the major comprehensive human rights treaties, actually originated as the result of a variety of causes, by no means all of which reflected any notion of human rights. • For one particular group of countries (those post-socialist states which have achieved independence in the aftermath of the break up of the Soviet Union), human rights have been a conscious driver of change. However, for almost all of these countries, the immediate driver for reform was the prospect of future accession to joining the European Union rather than the mechanisms of the Council of Europe that oversee the structure of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). • The European Union provides an example for an organisation into which a major attempt has been made to integrate human rights into its constitution and this has both made it a powerful enforcer of rights in relation to countries on its eastern border but is now attracting the resistance a group of countries led by Ireland and the United Kingdom on its western border – both of which have actually have relatively well established <b>legal</b> <b>aid</b> <b>schemes...</b>|$|R
