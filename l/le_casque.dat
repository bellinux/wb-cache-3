25|$|The Fourth Army {{plan was}} to capture Bois de la Grille, Leopoldshöhe Trench {{and all of the}} south face of the Moronvilliers hills, push the Germans back from Le Golfe and {{encircle}} Aubérive from the flanks. Vaudesincourt was then to be captured and the right flank was to link with the centre, which was to take Côte 181 and Mont Sans Nom. If Le Téton had not been captured, the troops in the French centre, were to drive the Germans from Bois de Côte 144 and attack the hill from the east. East of the Suippes, on the right flank of the XVII Corps, four and a half battalions were to attack Aubérive and the trenches beyond, up to those at the western fringe of Bois des Abatis. West of the Suippes to the south of Aubérive, the Moroccan Division, a regiment of the Foreign Legion and the 185th Territorial Brigade were to take Aubérive, the German blockhouses at Vaudesincourt, Le Golfe and Mont Sans Nom. On the right flank of the XVII Corps, one division was to capture <b>Le</b> <b>Casque,</b> its wood and Le Téton; on the left flank the divisional objectives were the summits of Mont Haut, Mont Perthois and the trenches linking Mont Haut to <b>Le</b> <b>Casque.</b> The VIII Corps (General Hely d'Oissel), was to capture Mont Cornillot and Mont Blond, Flensburg Trench and the next one behind, which connected the defences of the summits, Mont Blond, Mont Cornillot, Bois de la Grille and Leopoldshöhe Trench.|$|E
25|$|The {{capture of}} the German defences {{on the edge of}} the Châlons Plain above Aubérive, was {{necessary}} for an advance around Beine and an attack from the east of the Nogent l'Abbesse massif. Success would allow the Fourth Army to advance towards the Suippes, between St. Martin l'Heureux and Warmeriville to the north-west, outflank the Nogent l'Abbesse hills from the north. The railway from Bazancourt to Warmeriville, Somme-Py and Apremont, the main German supply line south of the Aisne, would be cut. New railways had been built by the Germans but cutting the line would make it difficult for the Germans to supply the forces east of the Suippes and west of the upper Aisne. Should Mont Cornillet, Mont Blond, Mont Haut, Mont Perthois, <b>Le</b> <b>Casque,</b> Le Téton and Mont Sans Nom be captured, the German defences from the Suippes to the Argonne would be outflanked from the west. The German positions on the hills overlooked the Plain of Châlons, giving an uninterrupted view of French movements between Reims and the Argonne. A successful French offensive would deprive the Germans of observation and block the route to the Plain of Châlons.|$|E

25|$|The first German line in {{the south}} of this {{defensive}} zone, comprised several parallel trenches connected by communication trenches, with numerous dug-outs, concrete blockhouses and pill-boxes. A second line higher up the ridge, was joined to the first by the Leopoldshöhe Trench, a fortified approach from the north of Bois de la Grille to the Thuizy–Nauroy road. The Leopoldshöhe Trench was continued to the east, below the summits of Mont Cornillet, Mont Blond, Mont Haut and Mont Perthois, by Erfurt Trench. South of <b>Le</b> <b>Casque</b> and Le Téton, it became graben du Bois du Chien, Landtag Trench and then Landsturm Trench, to the positions on the east slope of the hills. The trench ran below and Côte 181 and Mont Sans Nom. Behind the German second line, the hilltops had been wired for all-round defence, connected by communication trenches. The crests of the hills had been fortified on the south and north sides; on the northern slope of Mont Cornillet and the north-east side of Mont Perthois, were the defensive tunnels. The tunnel entrances were invisible to air observation and a French advance across the top of Mont Cornillet could be attacked from behind from them. Every move by the French, was under observation from the German positions but the ridge from Mont Cornillet to Le Téton and the woods to the west and east, hid German movements from ground observation and could only be detected by French aviators, who were frequently grounded by bad weather in the winter and spring of 1916–1917.|$|E
25|$|German {{possession}} of Mont Perthois and Mont Sans Nom meant that a French attack on <b>Le</b> <b>Casque</b> and Le Téton could be engaged by crossfire. The hills {{on the edge}} of the Châlons plain could be outflanked from west to east, only after the German defences on either side of the Thuizy–Nauroy road and between Mont Sans Nom and the Suippes had been captured. The main German defensive position was in the ruins of Bois de la Grille to the south-west of Mont Cornillet and west of the Thuizy–Nauroy road. An attack from the east on the hills was blocked by the entrenchments from Mont Sans Nom to the Suippes, which ran south-east around Aubérive-sur-Suippes on the left bank of the river. North of Aubérive on the left bank was the fortified village of Vaudesincourt on the St. Martin-l'Heureux road. The Germans had dug several lines of trenches from north to south, on the west and east slopes of the hills, the trenches on the west running north and west of Nauroy. In front of Nauroy was another trench, which linked the defences on top of Mont Cornillet. Near the Suippes, a network of trenches followed the ridge above the river to St. Martin-l'Heureux. Higher up the slope, another trench led to Grand Bois de la Côte 179 and protected Le Téton from an attack from the north-east. An advance down the right bank of the Suippes, towards Dontrien and St. Martin-l'Heureux and the Bazancourt to Somme-Py and Apremont railway, was obstructed by a trench system east of Aubérive and Bois de la Côte 152.|$|E

Thus a realistic simulation of {{the environment of the}} driver of an engine car running at idle is possible. After measurements on six cars, three paired comparison tests have been conducted:- in the first one, the test person is only exposed to noise;- in the second one, he/she is also exposed to vibrations measured in the cars, but he/she is always asked to evaluate only sounds;- in the third one, he/she is then asked to evaluate the overall annoyance of the situations while being exposed to all stimuli. The comparison between the results of the first two tests proves that vibrations have an influence on sound perception in a small but significant way. In the third test, the jury can be separated in two groups of people using different criteria: for the first one, the overall annoyance is only related to the vibratory stimuli, whereas in the second one, noise stimuli are also important for the evaluation. 1 Acta Acustica united with Acustica 90 (3004), 987 - 993 Résumé: un banc d'essai a été réalisé pour permettre de placer un sujet dans des conditions représentant celles rencontrées dans un habitacle de voiture fonctionnant au ralenti.
