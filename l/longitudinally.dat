5|$|Line of wing folding – Some species, {{including}} Vespidae, the forewing are <b>longitudinally</b> folded {{along the}} 'line of wing folding' at rest.|$|E
5|$|Within a coral head, the genetically {{identical}} polyps reproduce asexually, {{either by}} budding (gemmation) or by dividing, whether <b>longitudinally</b> or transversely.|$|E
5|$|Another kind of {{piezoelectric}} transducer has the piezoelectric material sandwiched in <b>longitudinally,</b> usually into the resonator itself. This kind {{is good for}} torsional vibration modes and is called a torsional transducer.|$|E
5|$|As {{with most}} large cars of its time, the Tagora was a rear-wheel drive vehicle, with a <b>longitudinally</b> mounted engine. There were three engine choices, mated to four- and {{five-speed}} manual transmissions or an optional three-speed automatic {{in the case}} of the four-cylinder engines.|$|E
5|$|Motions of a bike can {{be roughly}} grouped into those {{out of the}} central plane of symmetry: lateral; {{and those in the}} central plane of symmetry: {{longitudinal}} or vertical. Lateral motions include balancing, leaning, steering, and turning. Motions in the central plane of symmetry include rolling forward, of course, but also stoppies, wheelies, brake diving, and most suspension activation. Motions in these two groups are linearly decoupled, that is they do not interact with each other to the first order. An uncontrolled bike is laterally unstable when stationary and can be laterally self-stable when moving under the right conditions or when controlled by a rider. Conversely, a bike is <b>longitudinally</b> stable when stationary and can be <b>longitudinally</b> unstable when undergoing sufficient acceleration or deceleration.|$|E
5|$|The central adrenomedullary vein, in the adrenal medulla, is {{an unusual}} type of blood vessel. Its {{structure}} {{is different from the}} other veins in that the smooth muscle in its tunica media (the middle layer of the vessel) is arranged in conspicuous, <b>longitudinally</b> oriented bundles.|$|E
5|$|After flowering, {{the curved}} {{leathery}} to woody follicles develop. Hanging downwards on wooden stalks, these are roughly oblong in shape, and measure around 5cm (2in) long. They split <b>longitudinally</b> {{to release the}} winged seeds, which are ripe around March. There are around 16seeds, which are arranged in two rows. Wooden structures known as lamellae separate the seeds {{from each other and}} the follicle walls.|$|E
5|$|Offered with an inline-4 {{engine and}} bucket seats the Pinto's {{mechanical}} design was conventional, with unibody construction, a <b>longitudinally</b> mounted engine in front driving {{the rear wheels}} through either a manual or automatic transmission and live axle rear end. Suspension was by unequal-length control arms with front coil springs; the live rear axle was suspended on leaf springs. The {{rack and pinion steering}} had optional power assist, as did the brakes.|$|E
5|$|Prior to opening, {{the flower}} buds are enveloped and {{protected}} {{in a thin}} dry papery or membranous (scarious) spathe. The spathe consists of a singular bract that is ribbed, and which remains wrapped {{around the base of}} the open flower. As the bud grows, the spathe splits <b>longitudinally.</b> Bracteoles are small or absent.|$|E
5|$|Tremella mesenterica {{may also}} be {{confused}} {{with members of the}} Dacrymycetaceae family, like Dacrymyces chrysospermus (formerly D.palmatus), due to their superficial resemblance. Microscopic examination shows that the Dacrymycetaceae have Y-shaped basidia with two spores, unlike the <b>longitudinally</b> split basidia characteristic of Tremella; additionally, D.chrysospermus is smaller, has a whitish attachment point to its substrate, and grows on conifer wood.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosaurid skulls {{had many}} unique characteristics, {{including}} fused parietal bones with a prominent sagittal crest, which ran <b>longitudinally</b> along the sagittal suture and separated the two supratemporal fenestrae on the skull roof. Behind these fenestrae, tyrannosaurids had a characteristically tall nuchal crest, which also {{arose from the}} parietals but ran along a transverse plane rather than <b>longitudinally.</b> The nuchal crest was especially well-developed in Tyrannosaurus, Tarbosaurus and Alioramus. Albertosaurus, Daspletosaurus and Gorgosaurus had tall crests {{in front of the}} eyes on the lacrimal bones, while Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus had extremely thickened postorbital bones forming crescent-shaped crests behind the eyes. Alioramus had a row of six bony crests on top of its snout, arising from the nasal bones; lower crests have been reported on some specimens of Daspletosaurus and Tarbosaurus, as well as the more basal tyrannosauroid Appalachiosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Wynnea {{americana}} {{is distinguished}} from other {{species in the}} genus Wynnea by the pustules (small bumps) on the outer surface, and microscopically by the large asymmetrical <b>longitudinally</b> ribbed spores with a sharply pointed tip. The spores are made in structures called asci, which have thickened rings at one end that are capped by a hinged structure known as the operculum—a lid that is opened when spores are {{to be released from}} the ascus.|$|E
5|$|A {{long period}} of uplift and erosion was {{concurrent}} with and followed the above events, creating a major unconformity. Sediments worn off the Death Valley region were shed both east and west and carried by wind and water; the eastern sediments ended up in Colorado and are now famous for their dinosaur fossils. No Jurassic to Eocene sedimentary formations exist in the area except for some possibly Jurassic-age volcanic rock around Butte Valley. Large parts of previously deposited formations were removed; probably by streams that washed the sediment into the Cretaceous Seaway that <b>longitudinally</b> divided North America to the east.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>longitudinally</b> stable when stationary, bikes {{often have}} a high enough center of mass and a short enough {{wheelbase}} to lift a wheel off the ground under sufficient acceleration or deceleration. When braking, depending on {{the location of the}} combined center of mass of the bike and rider with respect {{to the point where the}} front wheel contacts the ground, bikes can either skid the front wheel or flip the bike and rider over the front wheel. A similar situation is possible while accelerating, but with respect to the rear wheel.|$|E
5|$|Divergence and convergence: In {{the human}} cerebellum, {{information}} from 200 million mossy fiber inputs is expanded to 40 billion granule cells, whose parallel fiber outputs then converge onto 15 million Purkinje cells. Because {{of the way}} that they are lined up <b>longitudinally,</b> the 1000 or so Purkinje cells belonging to a microzone may receive input from as many as 100 million parallel fibers, and focus their own output down to a group of less than 50 deep nuclear cells. Thus, the cerebellar network receives a modest number of inputs, processes them very extensively through its rigorously structured internal network, and sends out the results via a very limited number of output cells.|$|E
5|$|Hydnellum peckiis cells (the hyphae) {{also present}} various {{characters}} useful for its characterization. The hyphae {{that form the}} cap are hyaline (translucent), smooth, thin-walled, and 3–4µm thick. They collapse when dry, but may be readily revived with a weak (2%) solution of potassium hydroxide. Those in the cap form an intricate tangle with a tendency to run <b>longitudinally.</b> They are divided into cellular compartments (septa) and have clamp connections—short branches connecting one cell to the previous cell to allow passage of the products of nuclear division. The basidia, the spore-bearing cells in the hymenium, are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 35–40 by 4.7–6µm.|$|E
5|$|In June 1938, the Soviet Reaction-Engine Scientific Research Institute (RNII) in Moscow was {{authorized}} by the Main Artillery Directorate (GAU) to develop a multiple rocket launcher for the RS-132 aircraft rocket (RS for , 'rocket-powered shell'). I. Gvay led a design team in Chelyabinsk, Russia, which built several prototype launchers firing the modified 132mm M-132 rockets over the sides of ZiS-5 trucks. These proved unstable, and V.N. Galkovskiy proposed mounting the launch rails <b>longitudinally.</b> In August 1939, {{the result was the}} BM-13 (BM stands for Боевая Mашина (translit. Boyevaya Mashina), 'combat vehicle' for M-13 rockets).|$|E
5|$|Species of Crepidotus {{having a}} similar shape can be {{distinguished}} by their brown spore print, compared with the white spore print of P.stipticus. Schizophyllum commune has a densely hairy white to grayish cap and <b>longitudinally</b> split gill-folds on the underside. The ruddy panus mushroom (Panus rudis) is larger, has a reddish-brown cap that fades to pinkish-tan, and shows lilac tinges when young, fresh, and moist. Some Paxillus species may have a similar appearance, but they have yellow-brown spore prints.|$|E
5|$|Staffa {{lies about}} 10kilometres (6mi) west of Mull, and 9km {{northeast}} of Iona. It is <b>longitudinally</b> oriented north-south, {{and is a}} kilometre long by about half a kilometre wide. The circumference is about 3.8km in extent. In the northeast the isle shelves to a shore, but otherwise the coast is rugged and much indented; numerous caves have been carved out by rain, streams and sea. There is enough grass to feed a few cattle, and the island has a spring.|$|E
5|$|The {{island of}} Lismore lies in Loch Linnhe, north east of Mull, in the Argyll and Bute council area. It is 15 km long and about 2 km wide, and {{oriented}} from SW to NE, roughly {{parallel to the}} Great Glen Fault. To the east is an arm of Loch Linnhe known as the Lynn of Lorn. Composed almost entirely of Dalradian limestone with interbedded black slate, Lismore has fertile soil and an abundance of trees and shrubs including ash and sycamore. The topography consists of sheltered furrows of land between raised areas that run <b>longitudinally</b> up the island's spine.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaflets}} of {{the plant}} are obovate-oblong, somewhat wedge-shaped, equal-sided, and of a silky texture. The mid-rib is usually folded <b>longitudinally,</b> and they are characterized by parallel transverse veins. The fruits (legumes) are typically one to two inches long (2.5 to 5.1cm) and contain six or seven brownish seeds. The plant displays purple flowers during season; they are described as their most attractive {{in the month of}} January. It typically grows to 45 – 50cm in height, and can grow on mountains with an altitude of over 3000ft. (914 m). Both diploid (22 chromosomes) and tetraploid (44 chromosomes) cytotypes have been reported.|$|E
5|$|The six-boat {{group that}} {{included}} UB-43 and UB-47 was ordered in July 1915, and both boats {{had been laid}} down in early September. This group was selected by the German Admiralstab for deployment to the Mediterranean, but, unlike the smaller UB I boats, they could not as easily be transported overland by rail. Weser prepared the boats for rail shipment by cutting the boat sections <b>longitudinally,</b> and sent all the materials, along with German shipyard workers, to Pola, where the boats were reassembled. UB-43 was launched in early April 1916, while UB-47 followed in June.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} one of the most widely {{distributed}} salamanders in North America, second only to the tiger salamander. Its altitudinal range runs from sea level up to , spanning a wide variety of vegetational zones. The range includes isolated endemic populations in Monterey Bay and Santa Cruz, California. The distribution reconnects in northeastern Sierra Nevada running continuously along the Pacific Coast to Juneau, Alaska, with populations dotted along the Taku and Stikine River valleys. From the Pacific coast, the range extends <b>longitudinally</b> to the eastern foothills of the Rocky Mountains in Montana and Alberta.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoans exhibit {{great powers}} of regeneration; lost parts swiftly regrow {{and the sea}} anemone Aiptasia pallida can be vivisected in the {{laboratory}} {{and then returned to}} the aquarium where it will heal. They are capable of a variety of asexual means of reproduction including fragmentation, longitudinal and transverse fission and budding. Sea anemones for example can crawl across a surface leaving behind them detached pieces of the pedal disc which develop into new clonal individuals. Anthopleura species divide <b>longitudinally,</b> pulling themselves apart, resulting in groups of individuals with identical colouring and patterning. Transverse fission is less common, but occurs in Anthopleura stellula and Gonactinia prolifera, with a rudimentary band of tentacles appearing on the column before the sea anemone tears itself apart. Zoanthids are capable of budding off new individuals.|$|E
5|$|Sea anemones {{have great}} powers of {{regeneration}} and can reproduce asexually, by budding, fragmentation, or by longitudinal or transverse binary fission. Some {{species such as}} certain Anthopleura divide <b>longitudinally,</b> pulling themselves apart, resulting in groups of individuals with identical colouring and markings. Transverse fission is less common, but occurs in Anthopleura stellula and Gonactinia prolifera, with a rudimentary band of tentacles appearing halfway up the column before it splits horizontally. Some species can also reproduce by pedal laceration. In this process, a ring of material may break off from the pedal disc {{at the base of}} the column which then fragments, the pieces regenerating into new clonal individuals. Alternatively, fragments detach separately as the animal creeps across a surface. In Metridium dianthus, fragmentation rates were higher in individuals living among live mussels than among dead shells, and all the new individuals had tentacles within three weeks.|$|E
5|$|The {{sandstone}} formations {{from which}} Silver Reef gets its name were formed when tectonic stresses forced long, <b>longitudinally</b> aligned sections of Navajo Sandstone to buckle and {{stand on their}} sides, giving them the appearance of ocean reefs. Over {{long periods of time}} silver ore, sediments, and vegetation were carried in water runoff from the Chinle Formation to the White, Buckeye, and East reefs. The ore settled as deposits and the vegetation became petrified. The Silver Reef Mining District's geologic resources consist mainly of silver deposits, with smaller deposits of copper, gold, lead, and uranium oxide. Iron oxide deposits in the soil rocks cause a red coloration, and dinosaur tracks from the early Jurassic period have been found in the area.|$|E
5|$|The upper incisors are orthodont (with their {{cutting edge}} {{perpendicular}} to the plane formed by the molars) and have yellow to light orange enamel. On the lower incisor, the enamel contains series of fine ridges. The toothrows are longer than in eastern voalavo. As in Eliurus, the molars are incipiently hypsodont (high-crowned) and the individual cusps have lost their identities, having merged into transverse laminae that are not connected <b>longitudinally.</b> There are three laminae on each first and second molar, two on the third lower molar, and the laminae cannot be differentiated on the third upper molar. Although {{the first and second}} molars are similar to each other in size, the third (upper and lower) molars are conspicuously smaller. There are three roots below each upper and two below each lower molar.|$|E
5|$|This is {{the manner}} in which they are made; two (parallel) walls of very thick wooden (planking) are raised, and across the space between them are placed very thick planks (the bulkheads) secured <b>longitudinally</b> and {{transversely}} by means of large nails, each three ells in length. When these walls have thus been built, the lower deck is fitted in, and the ship is launched before the upper works are finished. The pieces of wood, and those parts of the hull, near the water(-line) serve for the crew to wash and to accomplish their natural necessities. On the sides of these pieces of wood also the oars are found; they are as big as masts, and are worked by 10 or 15 men (each), who row standing up.|$|E
5|$|When {{collected}} in deposit, such {{as with a}} spore print, the spores appear white. Viewed with a microscope, the spores are broadly elliptical or roughly spherical, smooth, thin-walled, and have dimensions of 6.5–9.5 by 5.5 by 8.5µm. Spores are amyloid (meaning they take up iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent) The basidia (spore-bearing cells {{on the edges of}} gills) are four-spored and measure 30–50 by 4–11µm. The bases of the basidia have clamp connections—short branches connecting one cell to the previous cell to allow passage of the products of nuclear division. The cap cuticle comprises a layer of densely interwoven, sightly gelatinized, filamentous hyphae that are 3–8µm in diameter. The stem tissue is made of sparse, thin, <b>longitudinally</b> oriented hyphae measuring 294 by 39µm.|$|E
5|$|Fruit : A capsule that {{is usually}} loculicidal (splitting along the locules) as in the Lilioideae, but {{occasionally}} septicidal (splitting between them, along the separating septa) in the Calachortoideae and wind dispersed, although the Medeoleae form berries (baccate). The seeds may be flat, oblong, angular, , ellipsoid or globose (spherical), or compressed with a well developed epidermis. The exterior may be smooth or roughened, with a wing or raphe (ridge), aril or one to two tails, rarely hairy, but may be dull or shiny {{and the lack of}} a black integument distinguishes them from related taxa such as Allioideae that were previously included in this family, and striate (parallel <b>longitudinally</b> ridged) in the Steptopoideae. The hilum (scar) is generally inconspicuous. The bitegmic (separate testa and tegmen) seed coat itself may be thin, suberose (like cork), or crustaceous (hard or brittle). The endosperm is abundant, cartilaginous (fleshy) or horny and contains oils and aleurone but not starch (non-farinaceous). Its cells are polyploid (triploid or pentaploid, depending on the embryo sac type). The embryo is small (usually less than one quarter of seed volume), axile (radially sectioned), linear (longer than broad) or rarely rudimentary (tiny relative to endosperm) depending on placentation type, and straight, bent, curved or curled at the upper end.|$|E
5|$|Nervous {{tissue is}} {{composed}} of many nerve cells known as neurons which transmit information. In some slow-moving radially symmetrical marine animals such as ctenophores and cnidarians (including sea anemones and jellyfish), the nerves form a nerve net, but in most animals they are organized <b>longitudinally</b> into bundles. In simple animals, receptor neurons in the body wall cause a local reaction to a stimulus. In more complex animals, specialized receptor cells such as chemoreceptors and photoreceptors are found in groups and send messages along neural networks {{to other parts of}} the organism. Neurons can be connected together in ganglia. In higher animals, specialized receptors are the basis of sense organs and there is a central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and a peripheral nervous system. The latter consists of sensory nerves that transmit information from sense organs and motor nerves that influence target organs. The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system which conveys sensation and controls voluntary muscle, and the autonomic nervous system which involuntarily controls smooth muscle, certain glands and internal organs, including the stomach.|$|E
5|$|The spores are , smooth, colorless, {{distinctly}} amyloid (absorbing iodine stain from Melzer's reagent), thin-walled, {{and measure}} 11.5–14 by 6–8µm. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are 17–28 by 6–8µm, club-shaped, and four-spored. The basidioles (immature or aborted basidia) are club-shaped. The cheilocystidia (cystidia {{found on the}} gills edges) are 32–39 by 5–12µm, abundant, spindle-shaped to roughly club-shaped, often apically broadly rounded, smooth, colorless, and thin-walled. They form a sterile gill edge. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill faces) are absent in this species. The hymenophoral tissue (tissue of the hymenium-bearing structure) is made of thin-walled hyphae that are 7–15µm wide, cylindrical, smooth, colorless, and dextrinoid (staining reddish to reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent). The cap cuticle is made of parallel, bent-over hyphae that are 2–5µm wide, cylindrical, and densely covered with warty or finger-like thin-walled diverticulae that are colorless or contain cytoplasmic brownish pigment. The layer of hyphae underlying the cap cuticle are parallel, colorless or with cytoplasmic brownish pigment, dextrinoid, and have short and inflated cells measuring up to 30µm wide. The stem cuticle is made of parallel, bent-over hyphae that are 3–5µm wide, and cylindrical. These hyphae are covered with scattered, thin-walled warty or finger-like diverticulae that can be either colorless, or contain brownish pigment in the cytoplasm. The flesh of the stem is made of <b>longitudinally</b> running, cylindrical hyphae that are 5–17µm wide, smooth, colorless, and dextrinoid. Clamp connections are absent in all tissues of this species.|$|E
5|$|The spores are broadly , smooth, colorless, amyloid (staining bluish to blue-black when {{treated with}} Melzer's reagent), {{thin-walled}}, and measure 8–9 by 5–6µm. The basidia are 40–60 by 10–12µm, club-shaped, and four-spored. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are abundant, club-shaped, and measure 30–45 by 10–17µm. Their tips {{are covered with}} one or more, knob-like short excrescences that are colorless and thin-walled. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are absent. The hymenophoral tissue (tissue of the hymenium-bearing structure) is made of thin-walled hyphae that are 12–21µm wide, cylindrical (but often somewhat inflated), smooth, and contain cytoplasmic brownish pigment. These hyphae are dextrinoid, meaning that they stain reddish to reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent. The cap cuticle is made of parallel, bent-over hyphae that are 2–7µm wide, and cylindrical. These hyphae are smooth, or can be covered with scattered, warty or finger-like thin-walled diverticulae that are colorless or pale brownish, and dextrinoid. The layer of hyphae underlying the cap cuticle is parallel, cylindrical, hyaline or brownish, and dextrinoid; it has short and inflated cells that are up to 48µm wide. The stem cuticle is made of parallel, bent-over hyphae that are 3–8µm wide, and similar to the hyphae of the cap cuticle. The caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) are 45–88 by 5–8µm, cylindrical, diverticulate, colorless or brownish, and thin-walled. The flesh of the stem is composed of <b>longitudinally</b> running, cylindrical hyphae that are 8–25µm wide, smooth, colorless, and dextrinoid. Clamp connections {{are present in the}} cap cuticle, the stem cuticle, the gill flesh, and at the basal septa of the basidia.|$|E

25|$|The {{superstructure}} of {{a conduit}} or scaffold {{is important for}} simulating in vivo conditions for nerve tissue formation. The extracellular matrix, which is mainly responsible for directing tissue growth and formation, has a complex superstructure created by many interwoven fibrous molecules. Ways of forming artificial superstructure {{include the use of}} thermo-responsive hydrogels, <b>longitudinally</b> oriented channels, <b>longitudinally</b> oriented fibers, stretch-grown axons, and nanofibrous scaffolds.|$|E
