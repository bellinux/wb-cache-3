5|$|Although {{the closure}} of the tramway allowed {{planning}} to go ahead for a railway, the planning for the replacement railway line suffered various delays in the 1930s due to funding issues: the line's construction competed with a proposal to electrify the Illawarra Line to Waterfall, and there were disputes over {{the point at which the}} line would connect to the main line. Two early proposals to join the <b>line</b> <b>at</b> Como and north of Sutherland Station were rejected. Despite the delays, Parliament finally gave approval to the line on 2 March 1936, and a route with five new stations was surveyed that would connect with the main <b>line</b> <b>at</b> the southern side of Sutherland station. The new line was opened on 16 December 1939.|$|E

5|$|Construction of the Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway {{began in}} 1845. The line was opened in October 1849, with {{services}} from Manchester London Road via Sale to Altrincham. In 1931 it {{became one of}} Great Britain's first electrified railway lines, with a 1,500V DC overhead <b>line.</b> <b>At</b> {{the same time a}} new Altrincham station was opened on the same <b>line,</b> <b>at</b> Navigation Road, serving housing developments in the area. By 1937, 130train services ran daily between Manchester and Altrincham. The line was renovated in the early 1990s to form part of the Manchester Metrolink light rail system. Broadheath railway station served the northern part of Altrincham between 1853 and 1962, on the line from Manchester, via Lymm to Warrington.|$|E

5|$|During the German {{occupation}} of Norway {{as part of}} the Second World War, the Wehrmacht wanted a railway route past Trondheim which was guarded against sabotage. They decided {{that the best way to}} do this was to build a tunnel under the neighborhood of Tyholt. However, construction of the tunnel took much longer than expected, so instead Wehrmach started laying railway tracks in the streets in Trondheim. They planned that the railway would branch from the Dovre <b>Line</b> <b>at</b> Skansen Station and then follow Sandgata and Olav Tryggvasons gate, cross Nidelva on Bakke Bridge and then run up Innherredsveien before reaching the Meråker <b>Line</b> <b>at</b> Lademoen Station. However, by German capitulation on 8 May 1945, construction of the railway had only reached Søndre gate.|$|E

5|$|In 1935, the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) {{announced}} a proposal, which {{became known as}} the Northern Heights project, to take over the LNER lines from Finsbury Park to Edgware, High Barnet and Alexandra Palace, and link them to both the Northern <b>line</b> <b>at</b> East Finchley and to the Northern City <b>line</b> <b>at</b> Finsbury Park. The construction of the first phase of this project involved extending tube train services from the Northern line's existing terminus at Archway station (then also called Highgate), through a new section of paired tunnels under Highgate station to emerge south of East Finchley station, where track connections to the LNER line were made.|$|E
