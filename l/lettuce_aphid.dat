40|$|Several small plot {{studies were}} {{conducted}} {{during the spring of}} 1999 to examine the population growth, distribution and control of the <b>lettuce</b> <b>aphid</b> on romaine. The <b>lettuce</b> <b>aphid</b> population developed to greater numbers more quickly and spread among plants more rapidly when compared with other aphids species under late spring growing conditions. Most of the lettuce aphids sampled were found on the hearts of the plants rather than the frame and wrapper leaves. Our preliminary efficacy studies suggest that foliar sprays, when timed properly and with proper coverage, can provide adequate control of the <b>lettuce</b> <b>aphid</b> for up to 14 days. Furthermore, significant suppression of apterous <b>lettuce</b> <b>aphid</b> populations was observed in plots where pyrethoid treatment were sprayed for thrips control.

40|$|Studies {{to examine}} <b>lettuce</b> <b>aphid</b> {{population}} growth on Admire and Platinum treated plants {{were conducted on}} head lettuce at the Yuma Agricultural Center. By artificially infesting plants on several lettuce plantings during the spring, the influence of insecticide residual and temperature were measured. Results of five field trials suggest that both Admire and Platinum can have a significant influence on <b>lettuce</b> <b>aphid</b> population growth. Depending on timing of infestation and insecticide residual, significant suppression of population growth can result from the application of these compounds. Infestations initiated at 28 d following Admire application initially resulted in minimal population growth, but later allowed aphids to reproduce at high numbers. In both cases, Admire provided about 90 % control of the <b>lettuce</b> <b>aphid</b> population.

40|$|Organic lettuce {{growers in}} California {{typically}} use insectary strips of alyssum (Lobularia maritima (L.) Desv.) to attract hoverflies (Syrphidae) that provide biological control of aphids. A two year study with transplanted organic romaine lettuce in Salinas, California investigated agronomic aspects of lettuce monoculture and lettuce-alyssum strip intercropping on beds in replacement intercropping treatments where alyssum transplants replaced 2 to 8 % of the lettuce transplants, and in additive intercropping treatments where alyssum transplants {{were added to}} the standard lettuce density without displacing lettuce transplants. Alyssum and lettuce dry matter (DM) were determined at lettuce maturity. Alyssum transplants produced less shoot DM in the additive than in the replacement intercropping treatments. The number of open inflorescences of alyssum increased with alyssum DM, and among treatments ranged from 2 to 15 inflorescences per lettuce head. Compared with monoculture lettuce, lettuce heads on intercropped beds were slightly smaller and had lower nitrogen concentrations in the both additive treatments and in some replacement treatments. This research provides the first information on a novel additive intercropping approach to provide alyssum floral resources for biological control of <b>lettuce</b> <b>aphids,</b> and suggests that this approach may be a more land-efficient particularly for producing smaller lettuce heads for romaine hearts or for markets with less strict size requirements. Additional {{research is needed to determine}} if the increased competition between alyssum and lettuce in additive intercropping would reduce lettuce yields for wholesale markets with larger head size requirements.

It was found on its primary host, Ribes spp. (e. g. currants and gooseberries), and moved to its secondary hosts (e. g. lettuce and weeds) in late spring, having survived the winter in sexual and asexual forms. Up to 73 lettuce aphids per flower head were found on flower buds and flowers of some widely distributed weeds in New Zealand, including Crepis spp., Hieracium spp., Cichorium intybus and Lactuca virosa, during summer and autumn 2003.

50|$|Some {{plants can}} {{tolerate}} {{the presence of}} large numbers of insects without being severely affected.

40|$|Small plot {{studies were}} {{conducted}} from 1999 - 2001 {{to examine the}} population abundance {{and control of the}} <b>lettuce</b> <b>aphid</b> on winter and spring head lettuce crops. In each year, Seven, 0. 25 acre planting of head lettuce were established beginning in Sep-Oct with final harvest occurring in April. Replicated plots within several planting were treated with an Admire treatment at planting, a side dress application of Platinum post-planting or allowed to remain untreated. Lettuce aphids were first detected in our experimental area in December in PD 3 in 2001, but in 2002 first occurred in lettuce almost 2 months later (Feb 21). Similarly, <b>lettuce</b> <b>aphid</b> abundance was much greater in 2001 than in 2002, probably a result of temperature difference. Temperature had an important influence upon <b>lettuce</b> <b>aphid</b> development based on our field observations. Population appeared to increase in early March when the average daily temperature was about 65 E F. We observed a sharp decline in population abundance in April where daytime highs exceeded 90 E F. Insecticide treatments also influenced seasonal abundance. Under heavy aphid pressure in 2001, lettuce treated with Admire in the early planting dates appeared to prevent lettuce aphids from significantly infesting lettuce heads at harvest. However, lettuce aphids in the last 3 planting dates were able to colonize plants and infest a larger proportion of heads at levels not considered commercially acceptable.

40|$|Several small-plot {{field studies}} were {{conducted}} at the University of Arizona, Yuma Agricultural Center in the spring 2001 growing season to evaluate various neonicotinoids and azadirachtin products against <b>lettuce</b> <b>aphid,</b> Nasonovia ribisnigri, in lettuce. Further, these products were compared as soil-applied treatments, foliar sprays and application through sub-surface irrigation. The results of these trials provide useful information for understanding how to effectively use the new chemistries available for aphid management in lettuce. First, Platinum performed best as a post-planting application through a side-dress application or through the drip. The foliar neonicotinoids, Assail and Actara were active against lettuce aphids, but were most effective when populations densities were lower. Comparatively, the conventional chemistries (MSR, Orthene/Provado, Provado/Endosulfan) provided consistent control when used aggressively. The azadirachtin products were significantly less effective against LA in head lettuce due largely to their inability to contact the insects, but on formulation (AzaDirect) showed better efficacy when applied through drip irrigation or sprayed repeatedly in romaine lettuce...|$|E

Admire applied 7. 6 cm sub-seed furrow provided longer and more consistent protection from green peach aphid than treatments applied to the soil surface, as a side-dress, or 15. 2 cm sub-seed furrow. Surface band applications of Admire provided inconsistent control probably because of inadequate hydrological incorporation into the soil. In small plot trials, effective control of aphids by Admire applied 7. 6 cm sub seed furrow resulted in greater than 90. 0 % marketable heads while the untreated plots contained 20. 0 % marketable heads.

40|$|Lettuce {{necrotic}} leaf curl virus (LNLCV) {{was described}} as the first non-tomato-infecting member of the genus Torradovirus. Until today, the virus was found only in The Netherlands in two different areas in open field crops of lettuce. In 2015, LNLCV was accepted by the ICTV as a new member of the genus Torradovirus. The tomato-infecting (TI) torradoviruses Tomato torrado virus (ToTV), Tomato marchitez virus (ToMarV) and Tomato chocolàte virus (ToChV) are transmitted by at least three whitefly species in a semi-persistent and stylet-borne manner. As LNLCV was transmitted in open fields in The Netherlands, where whiteflies are present only in low incidence, transmission studies were set up to identify the natural vector of LNLCV. Whitefly species which survive Dutch open field conditions during summer, as well as <b>lettuce</b> colonizing <b>aphid</b> species, were tested {{for their ability to}} transmit LNLCV. Lengths of acquisition and inoculation periods were chosen in accordance with the conditions for TI torradoviruses. Transmission experiments involving whiteflies were never successful. Transmission with aphids was only successful in case of the lettuce-currant aphid, Nasonovia ribisnigri. Localization of LNLCV virions in N. ribisnigri with a nested RT-PCR indicated the stylets as possible retention sites.

40|$|Lettuce {{cultures}} {{are prone to}} aphid infestations, but consumer tolerance for <b>aphids</b> in fresh <b>lettuce</b> is close to zero. To avoid losses of harvest due to <b>aphids,</b> <b>lettuce</b> plants are routinely sprayed with pesticides, which is costly and leads {{to high levels of}} pesticide residues in <b>lettuce.</b> Typically, early <b>aphid</b> infestation of <b>lettuce</b> cultures is not uniform, but shows a heterogeneous distribution. An early identification of aphid-infested lettuce plants prior to widespread infestation of whole fields would allow for selective spraying which reduces the use of pesticides. Although aphids have been shown to trigger physiological adjustments in plants, optical detection methods for aphid-infested lettuce plants have yet to be developed. For other crop plants, aphid infestation has been shown to change the optical properties of leaves and canopies. Spectral reflectance measurements of wheat and soybean revealed an increased reflectance in the visible spectrum, but decreased reflectance in the near-infrared (NIR) due to changed chlorophyll content and structural characteristics of leaves. We will compare different non-invasive detection techniques to determine suitable indicators for the biotic stress response of lettuce plants. As a first possible method, spectral reflectance measurements will be explored, followed by chlorophyll fluorescence measurements and thermal imaging. We will use image-based approaches in the laboratory as well as point measurements of field-grown plants with different infestation intensities to identify suitable indicators for the biotic stress response of plants to aphid infestation. Ideally, we can determine specific spectral signatures that are characteristic for aphid-infested plants. Our results will be used in the interdisciplinary project “Optimization of lettuce cultivation by high precision detection and selective pesticide treatment of aphid-infested plants” to select suitable sensors for the detection of aphid-infested plants, which can be mounted on a tractor and combined with a custom designed spraying installation for small-scale application of pesticides. We propose, that the early detection of aphid infestation and selective spraying of infested plants contribute to a reduced use of pesticides. On the long term, the developed setup will contribute to reduce the costs and environmental impact of pesticide treatments in lettuce cultivation...|$|R

The rearing plant affected feeding behaviour and performance of the aphids. Temporary reduction and long-term loss of virulence were found. The total duration of phloem intake was shorter after being reared on susceptible lettuce and tested on resistant lettuce. In addition, one population had a lower survival on resistant lettuce after being reared on susceptible lettuce. There were also indications of fitness costs of the virulence in both populations...|$|E

40|$|Australia is {{an island}} nation and a primary {{producer}} of agricultural and horticultural products. There is a large diversity of plant biosecurity threats which could adversely impact on Australia's production and exports. Surveillance has traditionally been used to monitor pests and optimise production. Increasingly surveillance is being used for early detection of exotic incursions, demonstration of eradication of incursions and pest freedom from exotic or endemic pests. These newer uses of surveillance utilise general and specific surveillance: surveillance data is maintained in electronic databases. Specific surveillance is a targeted surveillance search used by industry or state regulators for a specific pest to support pest freedom or other trade standards. The plant biosecurity surveillance cycle shows the flow of surveillance operations. In this paper, this cycle is demonstrated by case studies including pre border and the northern Australian at-border surveillance for the Australian-Asian interface. Within Australia, the multiple plant pest surveillance program was established in most capital cities where there are high flows of population and produce.

40|$|The RGC 2 {{gene cluster}} in lettuce (Lactuca sativa) {{is one of}} the largest known {{families}} of genes encoding nucleotide binding site¿leucine-rich repeat (NBS¿LRR) proteins. One of its members, RGC 2 B, encodes Dm 3 which determines resistance to downy mildew caused by the oomycete Bremia lactucae carrying the cognate avirulence gene, Avr 3. We developed an efficient strategy for analysis of this large family of low expressed genes using post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS). We transformed lettuce cv. Diana (carrying Dm 3) using chimeric gene constructs designed to simultaneously silence RGC 2 B and the GUS reporter gene via the production of interfering hairpin RNA (ihpRNA). Transient assays of GUS expression in leaves accurately predicted silencing of both genes and were subsequently used to assay silencing in transgenic T 1 plants and their offspring. Levels of mRNA were reduced not only for RGC 2 B but also for all seven diverse RGC 2 family members tested. We then used the same strategy to show that the resistance specificity encoded by the genetically defined Dm 18 locus in lettuce cv. Mariska is the result of two resistance specificities, only one of which was silenced by ihpRNA derived from RGC 2 B. Analysis of progeny from crosses between transgenic, silenced tester stocks and lettuce accessions carrying other resistance genes previously mapped to the RGC 2 locus indicated that two additional resistance specificities to B. lactucae, Dm 14 and Dm 16, as well as resistance to <b>lettuce</b> root <b>aphid</b> (Pemphigus bursarius L.), Ra, are encoded by RGC 2 family member...|$|R

A 2 -year experiment was carried out in northeastern Spain (Navarra) to evaluate the impact of a UV-blocking film (AD-IR AV) on the population density of insect pests and the spread of insect-transmitted virus diseases associated with head lettuce [Lactuca sativa (L.) ]. Results showed that the UV-absorbing plastic film did not loose its ability to filter UV radiation after three lettuce crop cycles (14 months). The UV-absorbing plastic film was effective in reducing the abundance and in delaying the colonization of <b>lettuce</b> by <b>aphids</b> [Macrosiphum euphorbiae (Thomas) and Acyrthosiphum lactucae (Passerini) ]. A significant increase in the percentage of marketable plants was achieved under UV-absorbing films due to a {{reduction in the number of}} plants infested by aphids and by insect-transmitted virus diseases (mainly potyviruses). Also the UV-absorbing plastic films were effective in reducing the population density of Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) and the spread of tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) as well as the population density of the lepidopteran pest, Autographa gamma (L.), a common pest of lettuce in Spain.

40|$|Practical problem: Lettuce {{cultures}} are routinely pesticide-treated to avoid widespread infestation with aphids {{which are not}} tolerated by consumers. An automated identification of infestation events would allow for selective spraying which reduces the costs for pesticide treatments and levels of pesticide residues. Project objectives: We aim to identify suitable sensors and algorithms for the remote detection of aphid-infested lettuce plants and to develop an improved spraying device for small-scale application of pesticides. Both techniques will be combined in a tractor-borne setup for the selective spraying of aphid-infested lettuce plants. Expected results: We expect that the biotic stress response of <b>lettuce</b> plants to <b>aphid</b> infestation leads to altered spectral reflectance signatures of the lettuce leaves. Suitable sensors and algorithms will be selected to remotely detect aphid-infested plants. Furthermore, we will develop a custom designed spraying installation for individual plants by combination of high-precision valves and jets for small-scale application of pesticides.

40|$|Aphids, {{through their}} close {{association}} with plants, cause systemic release of semiochemicals. These may have {{negative effects on}} subsequent aphid colonisation and can also have positive roles with insects that are antagonistic to aphid development, for example parasitoids. One of the semiochemicals involved in host selection by aphids is methyl salicylate. and since this compound was shown to have a role as a plant stress signal, the hypothesis that aphids might facilitate identification of new plant signals was examined. Confirmation was obtained during an investigation of avoidance of unsuitable hosts by the <b>lettuce</b> <b>aphid,</b> Nasonovia ribis-nigri.

Aerial interactions between intact barley plants from different cultivars, which may be differentially releasing stress associated signals, can also influence acceptability to aphids.

40|$|Aphids are {{dependent}} on the phloem sap of plants as their only source of nutrients. Host-plant resistance in lettuce, Lactuca sativa L.

The resistance {{is located in the}} phloem; however, the exact mechanism of resistance is unknown. In this study, we investigated whether the resistance factor (or factors) is synthesized in the root or in the shoot. The feeding behavior and performance of avirulent N. ribisnigri were studied on grafts of resistant and susceptible lettuce. In addition, the persistence of resistance in excised lettuce tissue was measured, by studying the feeding behavior and performance of N. ribisnigri on detached leaves and leaf disks of resistant lettuce. It appears that the resistance factor encoded by the Nr gene is produced in the shoots: aphid feeding was reduced on resistant shoots grafted on susceptible roots, whereas aphids were able to feed on grafts of susceptible shoots on resistant roots. Partial loss of resistance was observed after detachment of leaves and excision of leaf disks from resistant plants. Aphids fed longer on excised resistant plant tissue compared with intact resistant plants; however, compared with excised plant tissue of the susceptible cultivar, the time spent on feeding was shorter, indicating resistance was not completely lost. Our findings caution against the use of excised leaf material for aphid resistance bioassays. </p...|$|E
40|$|Aphid saliva can {{suppress}} the blocking of sieve elements, a reaction that plants employ to inhibit aphid feeding, but aphid saliva can also elicit plant defence responses. Such plant responses might affect interactions between different aphid species and intraspecifically, e. g. among different biotypes. The objectives {{of our study}} were to investigate if feeding behaviour and performance of two biotypes of the <b>lettuce</b> <b>aphid</b> Nasonovia ribisnigri are affected by (1) feeding by the other biotype and (2) feeding by the green peach aphid Myzus persicae or the potato aphid Macrosiphum euphorbiae. Additionally the effect of feeding in a group was studied. All experiments were performed on both a resistant and an isogenic susceptible lettuce cultivar. Feeding or probing by conspecific or heterospecific aphids had different effects on Nasonovia ribisnigri biotypes. Aphids were only slightly affected by feeding or probing of the same biotype on both susceptible and resistant lettuce. N. ribisnigri virulent biotype Nr: 1 suppressed the resistance against Nr: 0 in the resistant cultivar. In contrast, defence was induced by Nr: 1 against Nr: 0 in susceptible lettuce. Co-infestation by M. euphorbiae and M. persicae had minor effects on Nr: 0. Defence against Nr: 1 was induced on both susceptible lettuce and resistant lettuce by Nr: 0 and M. euphorbiae. Additionally, M. persicae induced defence in resistant lettuce against Nr: 1. Effectors in the saliva of Nr: 1 aphids are likely responsible for the defence suppression in lettuce.

40|$|The {{resistance}} of <b>lettuce</b> to the <b>aphid</b> Nasonovia ribisnigri {{is based on}} a single, dominant gene, the Nr-gene. On the resistant plant aphids died within a few days, without any honeydew production. Transfer-experiments with a short stay on a resistant plant followed by a relocation to a susceptible plant showed that no weight increase occurred on the resistant plant, but weight gain immediately resumed on a susceptible plant (Chapter 2). So no intoxication seemed to occur on the resistant plant. Behavioral observations of (tethered) aphids using Electrical Penetration Graphs (EPG) (Chapter 3) and comparison with free living aphids (Chapter 4) showed that on the resistant plant the aphid's stylets did penetrate to the phloem sieve elements. On the resistant plants hardly any E 2 pattern (phloem sap ingestion) occurred and the aphid finally died of malnutrition, or left the plant (Chapter 4). It was concluded that the resistance {{is based on a}} factor in the phloem. This can be either a chemical factor like a feeding deterrent or a mechanical factor which obstructs ingestion. Experiments concentrated on chemical differences in the phloem sap of resistant and susceptible (isogenic apart from the resistance gene) lettuce lines. Amputation of aphid stylets (stylectomy) during feeding can yield small but pure phloem sap samples. However, on the resistant and susceptible isogenic lines no phloem sap samples could be collected because outflow from the stylet stump stopped after a few seconds. Larger phloem sap samples were obtained by EDTA chelation and honeydew collection (Chapter 5). Chemical analysis of the composition of the phloem sap samples showed no differences in sugars, amino acids, proteins and UV absorbing compounds (Chapter 6). Exhaustive analysis of phloem sap compounds was not feasible, {{not only because of the}} number of possible compounds, but also because the sample size and quantity was limited. In a bioassay aphids were offered a choice between EDTA collected phloem sap samples of resistant and susceptible plants, added to a complete artificial diet (chapter 7). Aphids showed a clear aversion to the extract of the resistant plant. This suggests that the resistance is based on the presence of feeding deterrents in the phloem sap of the resistant plant. Hopefully, these substances can be isolated and identified with the help of the bioassay...|$|R
40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the extent to}} which pest management systems can exploit semiochemicals (defined below) in ways acceptable to organic farming, and determines where the science base needs to be expanded to accommodate specific problems arising in an increasing organic farming sector. It considers whether current knowledge of semiochemical release from particular crop plants, herbs and wild plant species could be investigated further in relation to organic farming practice and identifies how strategies of multiple cropping, that exploit known semiochemical interactions, could be applied to key pest problems in organic production. Where such exploitation is not feasible, other strategies using semiochemicals including traps, extracts of natural products and nature-identical synthetic products are considered. Finally, general and specific directions in which research and development could facilitate greater penetration of the use of semiochemicals in crop protection for organic farming are identified. Semiochemicals are natural products that, by acting as signals, regulate interactions between organisms e. g. plants and insects. Once the semiochemical interactions between a pest and its host plant have been elucidated they can be exploited to regulate the pest population, providing an alternative control strategy to conventional toxicants. The choice of approach by which the semiochemicals are deployed relates to three options, i. e. from a natural plant source, from an extract or as a nature identical synthetic product. However, even where the most natural situations of mixed cropping are used, the scientific basis of the interaction must be established for robustness and sustainability of the approach. A complete understanding of the process allows a risk assessment to be made of any problems that might ensue when exploiting natural systems in different configurations from those encountered naturally. A major approach to using semiochemical based pest control is to exploit ways of repelling pests from crop plants and attracting them towards trap plantations. Deploying semiochemicals generated naturally by plants is consistent with organic farming practice, where a range of mixed cropping techniques are employed already, which ‘unconsciously’ utilise semiochemical effects. Thus, the acceptance and use of systems exploiting aspects of semiochemical deployment demonstrate an emerging role in organic farming practices. However, as emphasised before, a comprehensive knowledge of the semiochemical interactions that underpin these techniques is vital {{if they are to be}} exploited fully. Other pest control approaches compatible with organic farming, such as encouragement of beneficial species and the use of reflective surfaces in mulches, may not involve semiochemical effects, but could be exploited more beneficially by integration with semiochemical practices. Semiochemicals generated naturally by plants can be used to influence beneficial organisms as well as invertebrate pests. For example, plant defence chemicals, induced by pest or pathogen infestation, can affect the behaviour of pests and their natural enemies. Semiochemicals can be employed to maximise the impact of parasitic organisms that attack pest populations, for example in the management of refugia for maintaining and increasing populations of these beneficial organisms. In addition, the approach can be applied against other organisms antagonistic to agriculture besides invertebrate pests, for example in weed control, where signals interfering with weed germination can be exploited. Extracts of natural products provide semiochemicals in a form that is familiar and acceptable to organic farming practice, where plant extracts are already used as toxicants or as semiochemical antifeedants and repellents. However, often the scientific basis for use of these materials is limited, and therefore, exploitation is also limited and can be unreliable. By understanding the composition and the mechanism of activity of semiochemicals, natural product extracts can be improved by selection of the best sources of natural materials and appropriate processes of extraction and formulation. Many natural products, particularly pheromones (semiochemicals acting between members of the same species), can be synthesised as nature-identical and the synthetic forms are often indistinguishable from the natural form. Synthesis can be expensive, but where possible, starting materials should be obtained from natural renewable resources. Nature-identical synthetic pheromones are used widely in parts of the world, either deployed in traps for monitoring, mass trapping and lure and kill strategies or for direct pest control approaches such as mating disruption. In addition, manipulation of beneficial species with pheromones is being investigated and synthetic food-related attractants and oviposition attractants have also been developed for pests where pheromones are not available. Already some nature-identical synthetic semiochemicals have been accepted as compatible with organic farming practice. The registration of many sex and aggregation pheromones has been possible because they are nature-identical and are deployed away from the crop or on crop areas that are not consumed. In most cases, semiochemicals, deployed alone, are not sufficiently robust to control pest populations directly. They are most effective when incorporated into strategies, such as the ‘push-pull’ strategy, that are integrated with other forms of pest control, e. g. pathogens, parasitoids and predators, mechanical barriers and resistant plant varieties. The integration of semiochemical approaches with other methods of pest population reduction will help prevent the development of pest resistance to the overall strategy. Since the integrated strategy comprises a number of components that affect different aspects of pest behaviour and development each component can be relatively ineffective when compared to conventional pesticides. However, this has the advantage of not selecting efficiently for resistance to any component of the strategy and thus contributes to the sustainability of the approach. Recommendations 1) 	Develop a priority list of specific and general problems in organic production to be targeted by semiochemical methodologies in addition to known problems such as in carrot and <b>lettuce</b> production, <b>aphids</b> on a range of vegetable crops and for fruit pests. 2) 	Develop semiochemical based control methods suitable for 1) and for the targets already known. 3) 	Provide scientific input, where lacking, for 1 and 2. 4) 	Encourage greater diversification in organic cropping systems, including agroforestry, so as to exploit current knowledge of semiochemical based control and to pave the way for new interventions as the science develops. 5) 	Consider semiochemical attributes of non-crop plant inputs including mulches, weeds and multifunctional beneficial plants and the roles that they might play in organic systems. 6) 	Initiate organic plant breeding programmes, specifically to exploit natural semiochemical release where understood, for crop and companion plants. ...|$|R
40|$|Aphid species {{feeding on}} lettuce occupy {{distinct}} feeding sites: the <b>lettuce</b> <b>aphid</b> Nasonovia ribisnigri prefers {{to feed on}} heart leaves, whereas the potato aphid Macrosiphum euphorbiae feeds only on outer leaves. The aphid parasitoid Aphelinus abdominalis, known {{to be able to}} regulate M. euphorbiae on many crops, has recently been indicated as a promising biocontrol candidate also for use against N. ribisnigri, a major pest of lettuce. This study therefore examined A. abdominalis parasitization preference between N. ribisnigri and M. euphorbiae and its ability to parasitize aphids feeding on different parts of lettuce plants. In addition, life history traits of A. abdominalis on these aphid species were investigated. In no-choice laboratory experiments on leaf discs and 24 h exposure, A. abdominalis successfully parasitized 54 % and 60 % of the offered N. ribisnigri and M. euphorbiae, respectively, with no significant difference. In the corresponding choice experiment, however, A. abdominalis had a tendency for a significantly higher preference for M. euphorbiae (38 %) compared to N. ribisnigri (30 %). Growth chamber experiments on whole plants demonstrated that A. abdominalis was able to parasitize aphids, regardless of their feeding locations on lettuce plants. However, aphid feeding behavior had a significant effect on the parasitization rate. A. abdominalis parasitized significantly higher percentages of M. euphorbiae or N. ribisnigri when aphids were exposed separately to parasitoids on whole lettuce plants as compared with N. ribisnigri exposed only on heart leaf. A significant preference of A. abdominalis for M. euphorbiae compared to N. ribisnigri was also observed in the growth chamber choice experiment. A high percentage of adult emergence (> 84 %) and female-biased sex ratio (> 83 %) were found irrespective of the aphid species...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{consensus}} {{that the development of}} successful Integrated Pest Management strategies requires a detailed understanding of pest biology. In the case of the currant <b>lettuce</b> <b>aphid</b> (Nasonovia ribisnigri), an economically important pest aphid of lettuce, sources of such information are limited. This study considers key aspects of N. ribisnigri biology which influence its control. In particular, it makes comparisons between biotypes which succumb to (wild-type) or overcome (resistance-breaking), the host plant resistance (Nr-gene) in commercial lettuce cultivars. Experiments on the effects of temperature and photoperiod on the development of N. ribisnigri showed no differences between wild-type and resistance-breaking biotypes. At low temperatures (5, 10 and 15 ºC), wild-type biotypes developed to adulthood on resistant cultivars, indicating that the Nr-gene is temperature sensitive. A linear regression between development rate and temperature estimated a lower developmental threshold of around 4. 7 ºC. Nasonovia ribisnigri usually overwinters as a diapausing egg but overwintering nymphs/adults have been observed. In the laboratory eggs were obtained at 12 ºC 13 L: 11 D. Sequential sampling of eggs from the field suggested that diapause ended between late January and early February. Post-diapause development was estimated to take < 50 day-degrees using a LDT of 4. 7 °C. Nasonovia ribisnigri survived the winter as nymphs/adults on Veronica arvensis in the Midlands. Other weed species were suitable hosts in the labratory: Chichorium intybus, Crepis capillaris, Lapsana communis, Hieracium aurantiacum, Hieracium pilosella, Veronica spicata and Veronica officinalis. Field trials, using sequentially planted plots of lettuce, and applying 'exclusion' and pesticidal treatments indicated that natural enemies and emigration regulate aphid populations in the summer and contribute to the mid-summer crash. A large-scale screen of 96 cultivars and wild relatives of lettuce identified new sources of resistance against wild-type and resistance-breaking biotypes. Results from this study can be used to inform further development of an Integrated Pest Management strategy for this pest...|$|E
40|$|Aphids {{are serious}} pests of crop plant species, and host plant {{resistance}} {{is often the}} most effective and environmentally friendly control strategy to control these pests. One of these aphid pests is the black currant - <b>lettuce</b> <b>aphid,</b> Nasonovia ribisnigri (Mosely), an economically important pest of cultivated lettuce, Lactuca sativa L. Host plant resistance has been used since 1982 to control this aphid species and is mediated by the Nr-gene, originating from wild lettuce Lactuca virosa L. However, this resistance is not effective anymore, since N. ribisnigri aphids virulent to the Nr-resistance have been reported since 2007. The aim of this thesis was to unravel the mechanism of resistance mediated by the Nr-gene against N. ribisnigri, by behavioural studies on the aphids on both resistant and susceptible lettuce, to allow lettuce breeders to accelerate their resistance breeding programmes. Although the exact mechanism of Nr-mediated resistance remains unknown, the data in this thesis provide insight into this mechanism. The active site of the Nr-mediated resistance is mainly located in the phloem and some resistance might be encountered by the aphids along the pathway to the phloem. The inability of the avirulent aphids to feed from the resistant plant could be caused by the failure of aphids to suppress the wound response of the sieve element. The resistance factor(s) are only produced in the shoot, because grafts with resistant shoots and susceptible roots were resistant, whereas grafts with susceptible shoots and resistant roots remained susceptible. An intact vascular system is needed for full resistance, because both detached leaves and leaf disks of resistant lettuce plants were less resistant. Variation in virulence was observed among populations of different geographical origin. Aphids from a highly virulent population performed equally well on both resistant and susceptible lettuce plants, whereas semi-virulent aphids performed better on susceptible lettuce plants. Both short-term and long-term virulence loss were observed for virulent aphid populations differing in virulence level, which indicates this virulence is associated with fitness costs. A possible mechanism underlying virulence in N. ribisnigri to the Nr-resistance is the presence of an effector protein in the salivary secretion of the aphids suppressing resistance. Virulent aphids seemed to actively suppress the resistance in lettuce against the avirulent aphids. The original donor or the Nr-resistance, L. virosa accession IVT 280, was tested as possible source of new resistance against the virulent biotypes of N. ribisnigri and was foundfully resistant against virulent aphids, and can be exploited as a source of resistance in breeding for new resistance in cultivated lettuce...|$|E
