The {{book is a}} {{collection}} of the business management lessons <b>learned</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> course of Schmidt and Rosenberg's time leading Google. In his book, Eric Schmidt argues that successful companies in the technology-driven internet age, should attract smart and creative employees and then create an environment where they can thrive. He argues that the traditional business rules that make a company successful have changed. The book states that companies should maximize freedom and speed, and decision-making should not lie {{in the hands of the}} few. It also emphasizes that individuals and small teams can have a massive impact on innovation.|$|E

Based on the {{main purpose of}} this study and the concerns, the key research inquiries are: 1) What are the major research categories identified by the online workers for online <b>learning</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> next ten years?; 2) What are the major research priorities identified by the online workers for online <b>learning</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> next ten years?; and 3) What are the major research needs identified by the online workers for online <b>learning</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> next ten years? This is a mixed study that utilizes both quantitative and qualitative data to provide detailed information to the researcher for the data collection. The Delphi Study was used to represent a constructive communication device among a group of experts. A total of 72 participants (24 female and 48 male) were selected and all of them completed all three rounds of the study. These experts identified top categories, priorities and needs for online learning. The author hopes that this study can find diverse resources, multicultural experiences, and egalitarian opportunities that open our minds and broaden our perspectives for online learning...|$|R

500|$|Rather Ripped is {{generally}} {{considered one of the}} band's most accessible albums, featuring an abundance of concise and catchy melodies. Moore described it as [...] "a super song record" [...] that contains [...] "rockers and ballads". In addition, seven of the album's 12 tracks have a duration of less than four minutes, a feature that is uncommon in previous Sonic Youth releases. The album generally favors guitar textures over feedback or noise, which typically characterized the band's earlier works. Dave Heaton of PopMatters remarked that the guitars on Rather Ripped are joined together to form a vibrant and mysterious sound, stating that [...] "it often feels like Sonic Youth are taking all the instrumental tricks they've <b>learned</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> years and putting them in the service of building a lasting landscape of guitar sounds, one that reverberates with the sounds of the past but also feels eternally youthful".|$|E

6000|$|It is {{possible}} that an education entirely urban {{is not the best}} conceivable preparation for descriptive articles upon the country. On the other hand, your professional nature-lover is sometimes a little over-familiar with his subject. He knows the names of all the things, and he does not spare you. Besides, he is subtle. The prominent features are too familiar to him, and he goes into details. What respectable townsman, for instance, knows what [...] "scabiosa" [...] is? It sounds very unpleasant. Then the professional nature-lover assumes that you know trees. No Englishman can tell any tree from any other tree, except a very palpable oak or poplar. So that we may at least, as an experiment, allow a good Londoner to take his unsophisticated eyes out into the sweet country for once, and try his skill at nature-loving, though his botany has been <b>learned</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> counter of flower-shops, and his zoology on Saturday afternoons when they have the band in the Gardens. He makes his way, then, over by Epsom Downs towards Sutton, trying to assimilate his mood to the proper flavour of appreciation as he goes, and with a little notebook {{in the palm of his}} hand to assist an ill-trained memory.

60|$|Why need I be afraid? Say rather {{how dare}} I {{be ashamed of}} the Teutonic theosophist, Jacob Behmen? Many, indeed, and gross were his delusions; and such as furnish {{frequent}} and ample occasion for {{the triumph of the}} <b>learned</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> poor ignorant shoemaker, who had dared think for himself. But while we remember that these delusions were such, as might be anticipated from his utter want of all intellectual discipline, and from his ignorance of rational psychology, let it not be forgotten that the latter defect he had in common with the most learned theologians of his age. Neither with books, nor with book- learned men was he conversant. A meek and shy quietest, his intellectual powers were never stimulated into feverous energy by crowds of proselytes, or by the ambition of proselyting. Jacob Behmen was an enthusiast, in the strictest sense, as not merely distinguished, but as contra-distinguished, from a fanatic. While I in part translate the following observations from a contemporary writer of the Continent, let me be permitted to premise, that I might have transcribed the substance from memoranda of my own, which were written many years before his pamphlet was given to the world; and that I prefer another's words to my own, partly as a tribute due to priority of publication; but still more from the pleasure of sympathy in a case where coincidence only was possible.|$|E

40|$|The recent next {{generation}} science {{standards in the}} United States have emphasized learning about complex systems as a core feature of science <b>learning.</b> <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> past 15 years, a number of educational tools and theories have been investigated to help students learn about complex systems; but surprisingly, {{little research has been}} devoted to identifying the supports that teachers need to teach about complex systems in the classroom. In this paper, we aim to address this gap in the literature. We describe a 2 -year professional development study in which we gathered data on teachers’ abilities and perceptions regarding the delivery of computer-supported complex systems curricula. We present results across the 2 years of the project and demonstrate the need for particular instructional supports to improve implementation efforts, including providing differentiated opportunities to build expertise and addressing teacher beliefs about whether computational-model construction belongs in the science classroom. Results from students’ classroom experiences and <b>learning</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> 2 years are offered to further illustrate the impact of these instructional supports.
