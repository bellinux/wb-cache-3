50|$|The blunt-nosed <b>leopard</b> <b>lizard</b> is endangered. It is {{no longer}} present {{throughout}} most of its former range as the habitat has been significantly altered by farming, urban development, overgrazing, oil wells, mining, reservoirs, and off-road vehicle use.

5000|$|The long-nosed <b>leopard</b> <b>lizard</b> (Gambelia wislizenii [...] ) is {{a species}} of {{relatively}} large North American lizard ranging from 3+1/4 to 5+3/4 in snout-vent length (SVL). It has a large head, long nose, and a long round tail that can be longer than its body. It {{is closely related to}} the blunt-nosed <b>leopard</b> <b>lizard</b> (Gambelia sila), which closely resembles the long-nosed <b>leopard</b> <b>lizard</b> in body proportions, but has a conspicuously blunt snout. The species G. wislizenii, once considered part of the genus Crotaphytus, is under moderate pressure because of habitat destruction but is categorized as [...] "least concern".|$|E

50|$|Species in {{the genus}} Gambelia superficially {{resemble}} those of the genus Crotaphytus. However, one difference between the genera Gambelia and Crotaphytus is that <b>leopard</b> <b>lizards</b> have fracture planes in their tails, allowing the tails to break off when grasped by predators.|$|R
50|$|Collared lizards are diurnal and {{primarily}} carnivorous, {{feeding on}} invertebrates {{and other small}} prey, even other lizards. They {{spend most of their}} time perched on rocks, basking in the sun, but are generally quick to flee if approached. C. reticulatus spends its life on the ground much like the closely related <b>leopard</b> <b>lizards.</b> When threatened, it will take refuge in rodent burrows and under brush.|$|R
40|$|Extreme {{weather events}} can provide unique {{opportunities}} for testing models that predict {{the effect of}} climate change. Droughts of increasing severity have been predicted under numerous models, thus contemporary droughts may allow us to test these models prior to {{the onset of the}} more extreme effects predicted with a changing climate. In the third year of an ongoing severe drought, surveys failed to detect neonate endangered blunt-nosed <b>leopard</b> <b>lizards</b> in a subset of previously surveyed populations where we expected to see them. By conducting surveys at a large number of sites across the range of the species over a short time span, we were able to establish a strong positive correlation between winter precipitation and the presence of neonate <b>leopard</b> <b>lizards</b> over geographic space. Our results are consistent with those of numerous longitudinal studies and are in accordance with predictive climate change models. We suggest that scientists can take immediate advantage of droughts while they are still in progress to test patterns of occurrence in other drought-sensitive species and thus provide for more robust models of climate change effects on biodiversity...|$|R

50|$|Gambelia sila, {{also known}} as the blunt-nosed <b>leopard</b> <b>lizard,</b> is listed as a federal {{endangered}} species and is listed by the State of California as an endangered species and fully protected species. This species is thought to have declined as a result of habitat destruction and habitat fragmentation caused by development and habitat modification. This lizard used to be found in all of the San Joaquin Valley and the adjacent foothills of southern California. The Blunt-nosed <b>leopard</b> <b>lizard</b> now only occupies a few, scattered, undeveloped plots of land {{on the floor of the}} San Joaquin Valley and in the foothills of the Coast Range. San Joaquin Valley is a desert experiencing an ecological shift due to invasive species of non-native annual grasses most likely spread by grazing cows. The blunt-nosed <b>leopard</b> <b>lizard</b> along with other small terrestrial vertebrates are declining due to the ecological changes of the San Joaquin Valley as it is hypothesized that the invasive plants are altering vegetative structure. Although cattle may have originally been a factor in the establishment of these invasive species of plants, it was discovered by David Germano et al. that continued grazing, in order to keep the spread of the grasses limited, allowed for an increase in population size of not only the blunt-nosed <b>leopard</b> <b>lizard,</b> but other suffering species of the Valley as well.|$|E
50|$|The <b>leopard</b> fringe-fingered <b>lizard</b> (Acanthodactylus pardalis) is {{a species}} of lizard in the family Lacertidae. This species is endemic to North Africa.|$|R
50|$|The natural {{habitats}} of the <b>leopard</b> fringe-fingered <b>lizard</b> are subtropical or tropical dry shrubland, subtropical or tropical dry lowland grassland, and intertidal flats.|$|R
50|$|The {{breeding}} season is initiated in April and lasts into or through June. Male and female pairs are commonly seen together and often occupying the same burrow systems. In June and July, 2-6 eggs averaging 15.6 by 25.8 mm are laid. Environmental conditions {{may influence the}} number of clutches females produce each year, but they usually lay only one. After about a two-month incubation period, the young hatch. They range in size at birth from 42 to 48 mm. Some young blunt-nosed <b>leopard</b> <b>lizards</b> may grow to double their hatching size prior to their first winter. During the {{breeding season}}, females are recognized by the bright red-orange markings {{on the sides of}} the head and body and the undersides of the thighs and tail. Males may also develop a color of salmon to bright rusty-red over the entire undersides of the body and limbs. This new coloring may continue indefinitely in males. Male and female blunt-nosed <b>leopard</b> <b>lizards</b> exhibit several different physical behaviors. The simple headbob is a single, vertical motion of only the head whereas the pushup involves an up and down movement of the forelimbs and a headbob. Rocking and fighting displays are restricted to males. Rocking involves rotating the head and shoulders in a forward, circular motion. When one male encounters another, it exhibits a threat-challenge display. It consists of inflating the body, extending the hind limbs, and arching the back and performing pushups in rapid succession. Two fighting males will align side by side while facing in opposite directions. Each will then attempt to bite the other as they lash their tails and jump toward each other. Females exhibit a rejection posture when a male attempts copulation. With back arched, body inflated, limbs extended, and mouth open, she always faces the male or moves to orient herself laterally to the male.|$|R

Population monitoring activities were conducted for San Joaquin kit foxes, giant kangaroo rats, blunt-nosed <b>leopard</b> <b>lizards,</b> and Hoover`s wooly-star. Kit fox abundance and distribution was assessed by live-trapping over a 329 -km{sup 2 } area. Kit fox reproduction and mortality were assessed by radiocollaring and monitoring 22 adults and two pups. Reproductive success and litter size were determined through live-trapping and den observations. Rates and sources of kit fox mortality were assessed by recovering dead radiocollared kit foxes and conducting necropsies to determine cause of death. Abundance of coyotes and bobcats, which compete with kit foxes, was determined by conducting scent station surveys.

Lizard distribution, relative abundance, and diversity were determined from bi-monthly, live-capture censuses on 3 different vegetational stands. Stands, characterized by different shrub species and substrates (Budsage-Desert Pavement, Greasewood- Hard Pan, Sagebrush-Sand), were sampled monthly with random line transects for ground cover, shrub height cover, and shrub spacing. The indices to density of Sceloporus graciosus were significantly greater on the Sagebrush-Sand stand {{than on the}} other 2, and this species was significantly correlated (R²= 0. 60) with shrub heights of 61 - 75 and 91 - 105 cm.
