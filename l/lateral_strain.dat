The sensor chip is composed of three pairs of piezoresistive beams arranged in parallel and embedded in an elastomer; this sensor is able to measure the vertical and <b>lateral</b> <b>strains</b> of the elastomer. The coefficient of static friction is estimated from the ratio of the fractional resistance changes corresponding to the sensing elements of vertical and <b>lateral</b> <b>strains</b> when the sensor is in contact with an object surface. We applied a normal force on the sensor surface through objects with coefficients of static friction ranging from 0. 2 to 1. 1.

Furthermore, the relationship between these responses changed according to the coefficients of static friction.

Decorrelation of sequentially acquired ultrasound signals resulting from the deformation imposes a limitation on the precision (elastographic signal-to-noise ratio; SNRe) of estimating these deformations; this is presented as the <b>lateral</b> shear <b>strain</b> filter. In this paper, we explore the effect of a 2 -D-window-based strain estimation approach on the <b>lateral</b> shear <b>strain</b> filter and propose an extension of the 1 -D theoretical <b>lateral</b> shear <b>strain</b> filter to 2 -D. We compared the performance of the 2 -D approach in simulated ultrasound data and a tissue-mimicking phantom with that of the 2 -D <b>lateral</b> shear <b>strain</b> filter. In simulations, the 2 -D-window-based approach shows an effect in the axial direction similar to the 2 -D prediction.

40|$|Micromolding in {{capillaries}} {{has been}} used to fabricate alumina stripes on smooth (Ra = 0. 5 nm) and rough substrates (Ra = 900 nm). Different lateral (10 - 500 μm) and vertical stripe dimensions (8 - 27 μm) were used to study the influence of substrate roughness (smooth and rough sapphire) and substrate material (platinum coated and plain sapphire) on sintering behavior. Alumina stripes experience edge delamination during sintering on a rigid substrate independent of substrate roughness. However, enhanced substrate roughness reduced delamination length by half and lowered <b>lateral</b> <b>strains</b> by up to 0. 10. Grooves in the rough substrate were found to be responsible for this feature as they act as crack propagation barriers and generate local density minima. Accompanying discrete element simulations revealed a localized triaxial stress state at the grooves of a sinusoidal-shaped substrate interface as the main cause of the density minima. Platinum interlayers also resulted in reduced delamination by 40 % in some stripe geometries while density was enhanced by 4 % and <b>lateral</b> <b>strains</b> doubled in some geometries.

Therefore, predicting the <b>lateral</b> <b>strain</b> relationship with axial strain becomes an important issue. Measuring lateral strains in experiments is difficult and only few report experimental lateral strains. Among the existing analytical formulations, two recent models are compared with available test results in this paper with shortcomings highlighted. A new analytical model is proposed here for <b>lateral</b> <b>strain</b> axial strain relationship {{and is based on}} the supposition that the concrete behaves linear elastic {{in the early stages of}} loading and then nonlinear hardening up to the peak stress and then volumetric expansion. The proposal for the <b>lateral</b> <b>strain</b> axial strain relationship after the peak stress is mainly based on the hypothesis that the plastic <b>lateral</b> <b>strain</b> varies linearly with the plastic axial strain and it is shown that this is related to the lateral confinement level...|$|E
40|$|The {{confining}} stress in FRP (fiber reinforced polymer) confined concrete {{is dependent on}} the <b>lateral</b> <b>strain</b> of the concrete but the <b>lateral</b> <b>strain</b> of the concrete {{is dependent on the}} {{confining stress}}. Hence, the confining stress and <b>lateral</b> <b>strain</b> are inter-related and have to be evaluated at the same time. However, up to now, such evaluation has remained a difficult task. Consequently, the variation of the confining stress during loading and the effectiveness of the FRP confinement at various stages of loading are still not fully understood. Herein, a theoretical model for evaluating the <b>lateral</b> <b>strain,</b> confining stress and axial stress in FRP confined concrete is developed. The theoretical model is first applied to analyze the FRP confined concrete specimens tested by others to verify its accuracy and then used to perform a parametric study on the effects of confining stiffness.

40|$|The {{stress-strain}} behaviour of granular soils under monotonic and {{cyclic loading}} conditions and small <b>lateral</b> <b>strains</b> was studied in this work. A simple cubic triaxial apparatus (SCTA), originally developed at Leeds University for monotonic stress-strain studies of sand under controlled and small <b>lateral</b> <b>strains,</b> {{was used in}} this investigation. The three principal stresses and strains can be independentLy controlled and measured in this apparatus. The SCTA was modified and further developed to allow cyclic stress-strain studies of granular soils-to be performed. To increase the stress-strain data available on granular soils similar tests to those previously carried out on the medium sand, were performed on fine and coarse sands under monotonic loading conditions. The samples tested were cubic of 150 mm side length and prepared with ranges of initial porosities in a dry condition. To study the cyclic stress-strain behaviour of sand at small strains, a series of new tests on similar cubic samples of the medium sand were performed under cyclic loading conditions. Cyclic loads with different frequencies, amplitudes and number of cycles were applied and the samples were prepared dry at the loosest and densest conditions. Values of the coefficients of active pressure, earth pressure at rest, constrained secant modulus, Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio for the fine, medium and coarse sands were obtained and compared for different conditions. The relationships between vertical and lateral stresses are found and the volume change behaviour of sands in different conditions are studied.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of prestressed and precast members made of {{high strength}} concrete is {{strongly influenced by}} the increase in bond strength of the pretensioning tendons. In this paper the investigation results of the bond properties of prestressing steel in the transmission zone of prestress, {{in the area of}} cracks and in the anchorage zone are presented. In order to investigate the behaviour of prestressed and precast members made of HSC a series of pull-out tests, tests for the introduction of prestressing forces as well as tests on axially tensioned test-specimens and on different partially prestressed beams were carried out. The investigations resulted in considerably higher bonding forces in HSC containing silica fume, which are additionally influenced by <b>lateral</b> <b>strains</b> depending on the stress when tendons are released. This leads to a considerable reduction of the transmission length by transfer of prestress. Despite this, the required concrete coverage of tendons is no more than is necessary for normal strength concrete. The increase in bond strength results in an effective control of cracking by using smooth strands. In this way a design draft was developed in order to control crack width of partially prestressed members by strands only. The anchorage of pretensioned tendons at ultimate limit state is guaranteed, when the anchorage zone is free of cracks. Taking into account the influence of <b>lateral</b> <b>strains</b> in the anchorage zone with cracks, a bilinear bond strength characteristic of tendons should be used for design. The development of design codes for transfer of prestress, for control of cracking and for the anchorage zone of pretensioned tendons leads to a more cost-effective design for partially prestressed and precast high strength concrete girders...|$|R
