5|$|Lothian Buses have {{operated}} city tours using white liveried coaches. Later, Leyland Atlanteans {{were employed in}} this same livery, with blinds for City Tour. These wore {{an updated version of}} the white livery with blue detailing after a short period. An Edinburgh Classic Tour was set up in 1989 using open top Leyland Atlanteans, and later Leyland Olympians, which competed with Guide Friday. This was as a result of Guide Friday introducing competition on the city centre to Airport route. The buses wore a blue and white livery, each carrying a name e.g.Scottish Star, Lothian Star and Highland Star. Lothian Buses also operated open top tours in Oxford (in conjunction with <b>local</b> <b>operator</b> Tappins) and Cambridge under the Classic Tour identity.|$|E

Instead, it operates with the general axiomatic parameters, such as the scaling dimensions of the <b>local</b> <b>operators</b> and their operator product expansion coefficients. A key axiom is that the product of <b>local</b> <b>operators</b> must be expressible as a sum over <b>local</b> <b>operators</b> (thus turning the product into an algebra); the sum must have a non-zero radius of convergence.|$|R

Relative to the church interior, the stained-glass window is displayed at a much lower brightness than a linear mapping between scene radiance and pixel intensity would produce.

25|$|On 17 August an {{additional}} motorbus service was commenced from Clinton Street to Sneinton Dale. The decision to operate followed an application by a <b>local</b> <b>operator</b> {{to run a}} similar service. A 30-minute headway was operated at off-peak periods, increased to 15 minutes at peak periods. In September, an alternative service to Beeston was instituted via University Boulevard. In view of the operation of motorbuses along Hucknall Lane and to Beeston, powers in respect of tramway operation along these routes were allowed to lapse.|$|E
25|$|Madaba Micro Private Sector Participation. In the Madaba Governorate, a {{different}} model of private sector participation (PSP), called Micro PSP, {{has been carried}} out starting in 2006. The Micro PSP involved outsourcing customer service operations to Engicon, a <b>local</b> <b>operator</b> hired on a three-year performance-based contract. Aims of the project were to improve water and wastewater revenue, to increase the billing rate and to develop the customer management organisation, thereby improving efficiency. To achieve this, Engicon trained staff, surveyed and mapped all subscribers and regulated routes to meter readers (to eliminate reader monopoly). The Micro-PSP with Engicon had a variety of positive effects for the Madaba Water Administration: As a result of the cooperation, the Madaba Water Administration could start issuing its own bills instead of having to rely on WAJ structures. The accuracy of meter reading improved and net billed water increased by 75%. Net collections increased from 0.9 million in 2005 to 1.9 million in 2008. The levels of non-revenue water (NRW) initially dropped from an average of 45% to 34%, but in 2009 they were back at 40% due to an increase in water pumping pressure. Advantages of the Micro-PSP model include the fact that WAJ maintained asset ownership and that all revenue collected went to WAJ, so that investment costs could be fully recovered within 13 months of operation. The performance-based contract set strong incentives for the private operator to deliver concrete results.|$|E
40|$|In 1960, J. Peetre {{proved the}} {{finiteness}} {{of the order}} of linear <b>local</b> <b>operators.</b> Later on, J.

The statement we prove, adapting Slovák's original ideas, deals with <b>local</b> <b>operators</b> defined between the sheaves of smooth sections of fibre bundles, and thus covers many of the applications of Slovák's theorem.

40|$|We seek {{progress}} {{in the study of}} subtoposes of the effective topos. First we treat Van Oosten's result that <b>local</b> <b>operators</b> on the effective topos are internally NNO-indexed joins of what we shall call 'basic' <b>local</b> <b>operators.</b> Our main innovation is the notion of a tree-like structure called 'sight', which provides a tangible representation of <b>local</b> <b>operators</b> on the effective topos. This leads in particular to the establishment of an infinity of new basic subtoposes of the effective topos. Various comparisons (inequalities and non-inequalities) in between these new examples and known examples such as Turing degrees are made. Sights also provide a realizability-like semantics for the first-order arithmetic of subtoposes of the effective topos. The text begins with an overview of relevant tripos theory and some topos-theoretic constructions of <b>local</b> <b>operators...</b>|$|R

40|$|We study {{correlation}} {{functions of}} Wilson loops and <b>local</b> <b>operators</b> in a subsector of N= 4 SYM which preserves two supercharges. Localization arguments allow {{to map the}} problem to a calculation in bosonic two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory.

We focus on the correlation function of a Wilson loop and two <b>local</b> <b>operators,</b> and solve the corresponding three-matrix model exactly in the planar limit. We compare the strong coupling behavior to string theory in AdS_ 5 xS^ 5, finding precise agreement.

40|$|Starting {{from the}} finite volume form factors of <b>local</b> <b>operators,</b> we show how and under which {{hypothesis}} the $c= 1 $ free boson conformal field theory in two-dimensions emerges {{as an effective}} theory governing the large-distance regime of multi-point correlation functions in a large class of one dimensional massless quantum Hamiltonians. In our approach, in the large-distance critical regime, the <b>local</b> <b>operators</b> of the initial model are represented by well suited vertex operators associated to the free boson model. This provides an effective field theoretic description of the large distance behaviour of correlation functions in 1 D quantum critical models. We develop this description starting from the first principles and directly at the microscopic level, namely {{in terms of the}} properties of the finite volume matrix elements of <b>local</b> <b>operators.</b> Comment: 38 page...|$|R
