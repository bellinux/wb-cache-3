Looking down, he sees the foot prints of the blue dragon around him, indicating that after the explosion, the dragon carried him to safety and flew away.|$|E

The last three rooms connected to an 8.9m x 1m <b>long</b> <b>corridor</b> which reached the bathrooms. Each living room had three windows, the kitchens have two windows, and the dormitories, storeroom, and engineer's quarters had one window each.|$|E

The passenger cabins were set by day with a sofa which converted to two beds, one above the other, at night. The crew's quarters were located inside the hull and were reached by a catwalk. The galley was equipped with a single electric oven with two compartments and hot plates on top for cooking. One luxury that was not provided on the Graf Zeppelin was heating.|$|E

500|$|The {{hotel and}} setting has been {{compared}} to Stanley Kubrick's film The Shining, using similar composition such as <b>long</b> <b>corridor</b> shots and odd angles. Critics also observed that the episode drew inspiration from George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, particularly in the concept of rooms (or, in Orwell's case, Room 101) containing each person's deepest fear. Joe also quotes the old English nursery rhyme [...] "Oranges and Lemons", singing [...] "Here comes a candle to light you to bed, here comes a chopper to chop off your head!".|$|E
500|$|Construction for the Har Mar Mall {{began in}} 1961, when Harold J.

Slawik and his wife Marie – Har Mar {{is a combination of}} the two names. It was built upon 50 acres of land near a busy intersection in Roseville, Minnesota. Minnesota-native Willard Thorson, who designed Apache Plaza in nearby St. Anthony, designed the mall, while Robert W. Fendler served as the mall's architect. According to Thorson, the mall consists of [...] "a <b>long</b> <b>corridor,</b> which zigzags at a series of angles... that make Har Mar truly unique"; it features [...] "massively wide" [...] hallways and [...] "arched ceilings with large windows" [...] to allow natural light to enter the corridors.|$|E

After descending the stairs into the lower section and passing through the steel door, there was a <b>long</b> <b>corridor</b> {{with a series of}} rooms on each side. On the right side were a series of rooms which included generator/ventilation rooms and the telephone switchboard. On the left side was Eva Braun's bedroom/sitting room (also known as Hitler's private guest room), an ante-chamber (also known as Hitler's sitting room), which led into Hitler's study/office. On the wall hung a large portrait of Frederick the Great, [...] one of Hitler's heroes. A door led into Hitler's modestly furnished bedroom. Next to it was the conference/map room (also known as the briefing/situation room) which had a door that led out into the waiting room/ante-room.|$|E
500|$|Storm's {{first name}} for a group was [...] "Dracula & the Werewolves", but he then settled on [...] "Al Caldwell's Texans". Still known as Alan Caldwell, Storm opened the Morgue Skiffle Club in the cellar of a large Victorian house, [...] "Balgownie", at 25 Oakhill Park, Broadgreen, on 13 March 1958. The cellar {{consisted}} of two rooms, painted black and connected by a <b>long</b> <b>corridor,</b> with skeletons painted {{on the walls and}} one blue light. Groups played on Tuesdays and Thursdays for up to 100 people (above the age of 15) starting at 7:30pm, including Storm's group (later called [...] "The Raving Texans") and the Quarrymen (who later became [...] "the Beatles"). After complaints about the noise, the police closed down the club on 1 April 1958, but Storm reopened it on 22 April 1958. It was in the Morgue Skiffle Club that George Harrison auditioned for the Quarrymen, playing [...] "Guitar Boogie Shuffle" [...] by Bert Weedon, before being admitted {{as a member of the}} band. Harrison later asked Storm if he could join his group, but Storm's mother refused to allow it, as she thought Harrison was too young.|$|E
500|$|Although {{there was}} {{necessarily}} a hotel restaurant from {{the inception of}} the Ritz, the current hotel restaurant, L'Espadon (The Swordfish) was established in 1956 by Charles Ritz. He was a keen fishing enthusiast so named the restaurant after a fish. The restaurant is inspired by the legendary first chef of the hotel, Auguste Escoffier, serving [...] "traditional French culinary style with contemporary overtones". The cuisine is by the award-winning chef Michel Roth, the ninth head chef of the hotel; the restaurant was awarded a second star by the 2009 edition of the influential Michelin Red Guide. The head chef was formerly Guy Legay, cited as one of Paris's greatest chefs, who had served from at least 1986 to beyond 1999. In 1999, Esquire magazine wrote, [...] "the dining room, L'Espadon, down the <b>long</b> <b>corridor</b> of mirrors and display cases, has a glittering Regency formality that seems to swirl around you, and it's easy enough to imagine Hemingway sitting down with Dietrich to a dish of chef Guy Legay's buttery scrambled eggs..." [...] The restaurant decor is described as [...] "opulent with trompe l’oeil ceilings, swagged drapes, and views into the garden." [...] The courtyard garden is rich in greenery and contains several statues and a fountain. The hotel hires five or so florists to provide fresh flowers.|$|E

25|$|Joseph Younger’s {{plan for}} the {{interior}} called for <b>long</b> <b>corridors</b> running through each floor. Hartman-Cox consulted with Robert M. Swedroe Architects and Planners of Miami, Florida, who are experts in apartment floor plans. They proposed replacing the <b>long</b> <b>corridors</b> with two widely spaced elevators, which in some cases open directly into the apartments. Eliminating the corridors saved space, increased privacy, and allowed for much larger apartments, {{some of which are}} unusual “pass-through” apartments. They have windows on both the front and the back of the building. Only the corridor on the ground floor connects to the 1931 building. The layout of the apartments is traditional, with enclosed kitchens and formal dining rooms. The largest, with two bedrooms, two baths, and a den, is 2300 square feet.|$|R

2500|$|The {{convention}} center {{also received a}} complete renovation. A [...] <b>long</b> <b>corridor</b> was created {{on the east side}} of the facility to connect the Great Hall with the meeting rooms. At the center of the corridor were the escalators and stairs which connected with the reception pavilion above. At the south end of the corridor, a new carpeted pre-function space was created to support the meeting rooms. The corridor was decorated with horizontal bands of stone in beige, grey, and soft rose; reddish light sconces; and wood grills that mimic the X-like pattern found on the exterior of other buildings on the Cleveland Mall. The corridor floor was now terrazzo, and contained repetitive images of the CCVB logo.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{noticeable}} and praiseworthy ... is a semicircular roof to the upper saloon, which gives an air of spaciousness, elegance and comfort that is as novel as it is cheering. This arched roof extends nearly {{the entire length of}} the boat, and the prospect through the <b>long</b> <b>corridor</b> is enchantingly beautiful; the arched roof sits so gracefully on its supports, and its ribs are so light, that it seems self-sustained, like the blue arch above our heads. It is painted with exquisite taste a pure white, for any attempt at ornamentation would mar its graceful and beautiful proportions; and gilding and gingerbread work are used with a sparing and chastened hand in all parts of this splendid vessel.|$|E
2500|$|In 1993, {{planning}} began for a larger, more {{technologically advanced}} museum {{to replace the}} old one.

The museum combines the personal stories of 90 Holocaust victims and survivors, and presents approximately 2,500 personal items including artwork and letters donated by survivors and others.
