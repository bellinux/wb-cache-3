25|$|<b>Lemon</b> <b>basil</b> has {{a strong}} lemony smell and flavor very {{different}} from those of other varieties because it contains a chemical called citral. It is widely used in Indonesia, where it is called kemangi and served raw, together with raw cabbage, green beans, and cucumber as an accompaniment to fried fish or duck. Its flowers, when broken up, are a zesty salad condiment.|$|E

Bihun or thin rice vermicelli is most commonly used noodle instead of thick rice noodle, and some recipe might add slices of ketupat or lontong rice cake.

500|$|Due to {{the island}} {{location}} {{and the fact that}} the Cook Islands produce a significant array of fruits and vegetables, natural local produce, especially coconut, features in many of the dishes of the islands as does fresh seafood. While most food is imported from New Zealand, there are several Growers' Associations, such as Mangaian, Ngatangiia, Penrhyn, Puaikura, and Rakahanga, which contribute produce for local cuisine. Typical local cuisine includes arrowroot, clams, octopus, and taro, and seasonings such as fresh ginger, lime, <b>lemon,</b> <b>basil,</b> garlic and coconut. Rukau is a dish of taro leaves cooked with coconut sauce and onion. [...] A meal of octopus is known locally as Eke, and suckling pig is known as Puaka. Ika mata is a dish of raw fish marinated with lemon or lime and served with coconut cream, while Pai Ika and Keke Ika are also local fish fare. Poke is a dessert which can be made in one of two ways, either with banana and coconut milk or with pawpaw. Soursop, oranges and mangos are popular as juices. Coconut water, local beer (Cooks Lager), and coffee are popular beverages among the Cook Islanders.|$|E

40|$|Zeaxanthin is a {{carotenoid}} {{produced by}} plants {{and has been}} associated with protection of the photosynthetic machinery under light stress and, together with lutein, in protection of the central retina of the eye. Zeaxanthin levels in blood plasma have been negatively correlated to the development of AMD (age-related macular degeneration) (Gale et al, 2003). Under normal conditions, plants have a low content of zeaxanthin. The aim {{of this study was to}} increase the zeaxanthin content in green vegetables by post harvest treatments. Efficient conditions for activation of the endogenous enzyme system generating zeaxanthin was established and included incubation at low pH (2. 5 - 5. 5), with the membrane permeable acetic acid/acetate buffer at room temperature or above for 30 min or more. Typically more than 20 -fold increase in zeaxanthin content was obtained for spinach, corn salad, parsley, <b>basil,</b> <b>lemon</b> balm and peas. For spinach up to 4 mg/ 100 g fresh weight of leaves were obtained. In consequence less amount of vegetables would be needed in the diet to provide the same amount of zeaxanthin for the eye.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the allelopathic potential of essential oils extracted from fresh leaves of lemon grass (Cymbopogon citratus), wild basil (Ocimum gratissimum L.) and sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) with regard to their major constituents (citral, eugenol and cineol, respectively) in different application forms (direct contact and the effect of volatile constituents) on the germination and vigor of lettuce seeds (cultivar Regina SF 3500).

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of plant essential oils (EOs) against foodborne pathogens and key spoilage bacteria pertinent to ready-to-eat vegetables and to screen the selected EOs for sensory acceptability. The EOs <b>basil,</b> caraway, fennel, <b>lemon</b> balm, marjoram, nutmeg, oregano, parsley, rosemary, sage, and thyme were evaluated. The bacteria evaluated were Listeria spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus spp., Bacillus cereus, Salmonella, Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas spp. Quantitative antimicrobial analyses were performed using an absorbance-based microplate assay. Efficacy was compared using MIC, the half maximum inhibitory concentration, and the increase in lag phase. Generally, gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive to EOs than were gram-negative bacteria, and Listeria monocytogenes strains were among the most sensitive. Of the spoilage organisms, Pseudomonas spp. were the most resistant. Oregano and thyme EOs had the highest activity against all the tested bacteria. Marjoram and basil EOs had selectively high activity against B. cereus, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. coli, and Salmonella, and lemon balm and sage EOs had adequate activity against L. monocytogenes and S. aureus. Within bacterial species, EO efficacy was dependent on strain and in some cases the origin of the strain. On a carrot model product, <b>basil,</b> <b>lemon</b> balm, marjoram, oregano, and thyme EOs were deemed organoleptically acceptable, but only oregano and marjoram EOs were deemed acceptable for lettuce.

Marine phospholipids are very susceptible to lipid oxidation, due to the high amount of n- 3 PUFAs, which cause loss of sensory and nutritional value in foods.

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the antioxidant activity in 12 selected herbs using three different antioxidant capacity assays: Folin-Ciocalteu (FC), 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 - 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2, 2 '-azino-bis(3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulphonic acid) (ABTS). Based on the results of these assays, antioxidant capacity of the most prominent antioxidants from the assays was determined in a liposome model system with marine phospholipids, where the rate of oxygen uptake was used to measure rate of lipid oxidation. Propyl gallate, a representative of a synthetic food antioxidant, was used as a reference due to its known high antioxidant capacity. This study also showed inhibitory effects of propyl gallate on iron catalyzed oxidation of marine phospholipids in liposomes. Antioxidant activity of the 5 selected herbs was measured by means of inhibition percentage of oxygen uptake in the liposome (phospholipid dispersion in buffer). With respect to the obtained results, Sage, Rosemary and Dill exhibited antioxidative effects, while <b>Lemon</b> balm and <b>basil</b> were found to be prooxidants at the tested concentrations. The comparison of the results obtained by the assays and by the study of the antioxidant effects in the liposome model system with catalyzed oxidation indicates that the AOC of the compounds could be dependent on the oxidation system and the applied prooxidants. </p...|$|R
