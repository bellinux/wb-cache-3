There exists some sort of communication between a fungus garden and workers of the <b>leaf-cutting</b> <b>ant</b> Atta sexdens rubropilosa.

40|$|<b>Leaf-cutting</b> <b>ants</b> {{cultivate}} the fungus Leucoagaricus gongylophorus, {{which serves as}} a major food source. This symbiosis is threatened by microbial pathogens that can severely infect L. gongylophorus. Microbial symbionts of <b>leaf-cutting</b> <b>ants,</b> mainly Pseudonocardia and Streptomyces, support the ants in defending their fungus gardens against infections by supplying antimicrobial and antifungal compounds. The ecological role of microorganisms in the nests of <b>leaf-cutting</b> <b>ants</b> can only be addressed in detail if their secondary metabolites are known. Here, we use an approach for the rapid identification of established bioactive compounds from microorganisms in ecological contexts by combining phylogenetic data, database searches, and liquid chromatography electrospray ionisation high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-HR-MS) screening. Antimycins A 1 –A 4, valinomycins, and actinomycins were identified in this manner from Streptomyces symbionts of <b>leaf-cutting</b> <b>ants.</b> Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) imaging revealed the distribution of valinomycin directly on the integument of Acromyrmex echinatior workers. Valinomycins and actinomycins were also directly identified in samples from the waste of A. echinatior and A. niger <b>leaf-cutting</b> <b>ants,</b> suggesting that the compounds exert their antimicrobial and antifungal potential in the nests of <b>leaf-cutting</b> <b>ants.</b> Strong synergistic effects of the secondary meta-bolites produced by ant-associated Streptomyces were observed in the agar diffusion assay against Escovopsis weberi. Actinomycins strongly inhibit soil bacteria as well as other Streptomyces and Pseudonocardia symbionts. The antifungal antimycins are not only active against pathogenic fungi but also the garden fungus L. gongylophorus itself. In conclusion, secondary metabolites of microbial symbionts of <b>leaf-cutting</b> <b>ants</b> contribute to shaping the microbial communities within the nests of <b>leaf-cutting</b> <b>ants...</b>|$|R

50|$|Eucalyptus {{plantations}} {{provide a}} unique management challenge {{since they are}} commonly grown out of their native range and also in monocultures of clones. Large homogeneous areas of one species of tree are more susceptible of pest attacks. This is due to an abundant and predictable amount of food for the pest, and an absence of their natural enemies. There are less predator species in monocultures because the plants they need to forage, rest and lay eggs on are not there. This combination is why monoculture environments favor certain species and amplify their numbers to pest levels. The biggest pest concern with eucalyptus plantations in Brazil are leaf-cutting ants and Lepidopteran (moth and butterfly) defoliators. Leaf-cutting ants contribute the most amount of damage to these plantations. The insecticide methyl bromide is needed to fight leaf-cutting ants, with application done within a month of planting. Periodic applications {{during the rest of}} the rotation may be necessary. Monitoring <b>leaf-cutting</b> <b>ant</b> activity is crucial in eucalyptus plantations. Keeping a vegetative understory can also lower <b>leaf-cutting</b> <b>ant</b> numbers. Lepidoptera larva can be controlled with Bt application. Using a tractor is a more efficient than aerially applying Bt since the canopy is so closed and the Bt needs to reach the ground where the larva are. Traps are used to monitor larva levels to help better manage for them.|$|E

50|$|Foundresses of the <b>leaf-cutting</b> <b>ant</b> Acromyrmex octospinosus forage for leaves as garden {{substrate}} (semi-claustral foundation). The fungal pellet and substrate {{usually are}} attached to rootlets, which are used as a platform for the garden. This arrangement keeps the garden suspended away from the earthen chamber of the underground nest during early colony growth, and it serves to minimize contact between the garden and contaminants. A. octospinosus foundresses produce from 3 to 7 workers in 2.7 months after founding the nest, but workers do not forage for substrate at this time. Incipient nests died or were abandoned at a monthly rate of about 50%. The ants routinely clean their legs before manipulating the garden substrate. The foundresses use their fore-legs to rub {{the surface of the}} metapleural gland, and they then use typical grooming behaviors to pass the forelegs through the mouthparts, after which the ant then licks the garden substrate. Similarly, ants apparently use their mouths to transfer fecal droplets to their legs. These grooming behaviors are prophylactic behaviors that may help the foundress maintain a hygienic garden.|$|E

40|$|The {{degradation}} of live plant biomass in fungus gardens of leaf-cutting ants is poorly characterised but fundamental {{for understanding the}} mutual advantages and efficiency of this obligate nutritional symbiosis. Controversies {{about the extent to}} which the garden-symbiont Leucocoprinus gongylophorus degrades cellulose have hampered our understanding of the selection forces that induced large scale herbivory and of the ensuing ecological footprint of these ants. Here we use a recently established technique, based on polysaccharide microarrays probed with antibodies and carbohydrate binding modules, to map the occurrence of cell wall polymers in consecutive sections of the fungus garden of the <b>leaf-cutting</b> <b>ant</b> Acromyrmex echinatior.

We evaluated how the high nutrient availability generated by <b>leaf-cutting</b> <b>ant</b> nests in a Patagonian desert steppe may spread along the trophic chain, affecting the phenotype of two thistle species, the abundance of a specialist aphid and {{the composition of the}} associated assemblage of tending ants. Plants of the thistle species Carduus nutans and Onopordum acanthium growing in piles of waste material generated by <b>leaf-cutting</b> <b>ant</b> nests (i. e., refuse dumps) had more leaves, inflorescences and higher foliar nitrogen content than those in non-nest soils. Overall, plants in refuse dumps showed higher abundance of aphids than plants in non-nest soils, and aphid colonies were of greater size on O. acanthium plants than on C. nutans plants. However, only C. nutans plants showed an increase in aphid abundance when growing on refuse dumps. This resulted in a similar aphid load in both thistle species when growing on refuse dumps. Accordingly, only C. nutans showed {{an increase in the number}} of ant species attending aphids when growing on refuse dumps. The increase of soil fertility generated by <b>leaf-cutting</b> <b>ant</b> nests can affect aphid abundance and their tending ant assemblage through its effect on plant size and quality.

We used a chronosequence of nest sites on Barro, Colorado Island, Panama, to assess the influence of <b>leaf-cutting</b> <b>ants</b> (Atta colombica) on nutrient availability in a neotropical rainforest. Twelve nest sites were sampled, including active nests, recently abandoned nests (1 year). Waste material discarded by the ants down-slope from the nests contained large concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in both total and soluble forms, but decomposed within {{one year after the}} nests were abandoned. Despite this, soil under the waste material contained high concentrations of nitrate and ammonium that persisted after the disappearance of the waste, although soluble phosphate returned to background concentrations within one year of nest abandonment. Fine roots were more abundant in soil under waste than control soils up to one year after nest abandonment, but were not significantly different for older sites. In contrast to the waste dumps, soil above the underground nest chambers consistently contained lower nutrient concentrations than control soils, although this was not statistically significant.
