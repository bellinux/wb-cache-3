500|$|Critics {{were divided}} about Rick Grimes' return to Atlanta, {{as well as}} his stand off with Guillermo and his gang. Scott Meslow of The Atlantic {{compared}} Grimes to Mad Men Don Draper, and questioned his character development: [...] "So far, every decision Rick has made has been both within his code and consequence-free," [...] he said. Pierce opined: [...] "Dramatically, this whole sequence plays out pretty hokily.

The sound of The Band is so antiquated <b>like</b> <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Gold Rush and Dylan fits in because he's this storyteller with an ancient heart. At the time everything he did was so scrutinized, yet somehow he liberated himself from all that and enjoyed making music again. You hear an unselfconscious quality on this record which you don't ever hear again." [...] "He mocks his own inertia and impotence", writes critic Mike Marqusee, [...] "but with a much gentler touch than in Blonde on Blonde.

[...] By the end of Hoffman's career, San Jose Mercury News and ESPN.com wrote that the song should be honored by the Baseball Hall of Fame.

Mojo praised the song's musicianship, saying it was [...] "graced by swaggering performances" [...] and that the Edge's [...] "languid guitar solo" [...] was reminiscent of David Gilmour. Q echoed these sentiments, commending Bono's soulful singing and the Edge's solo. The reviewer christened the song as [...] "this album's 'One' or 'With or Without You', with added bonus points". The Washington Post called the song one of the record's highlights and enjoyed the track's gospel qualities. The reviewer wrote, [...] "The vocal harmonies on the choruses sound <b>like</b> <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a church in some distant, dystopian world; the woozy, slightly detuned piano adds to that impression..." [...] Hot Press gave the song a favourable review, calling it a [...] "sweeping" [...] track and suggesting it [...] "conjure the same spiritual vibe as Marvin Gaye's 'Abraham, Martin & John'". Time gave No Line on the Horizon a negative review, but praised [...] "Moment of Surrender" [...] for its [...] "heartbreaking melody" [...] and Bono's [...] "Oh-oh-oh" [...] vocals that reminded the critic {{of the end of}} [...] "With or Without You". Bono and Daniel Lanois both cited the song as their favourite track on the album, and Brian Eno thought the band should have chosen it as the album's first single.

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} a mixed response from television critics. IGN contributor Robert Canning said [...] "Flu Shot" [...] {{had a number of}} aspects that he enjoyed, but [...] "as a whole" [...] the episode was not completely satisfying, and reasoned that this episode fell below 30 Rock standards. He said that he personally did not buy the idea of Liz taking a tropical vacation, [...] "hat's just not the Liz I know. But even ignoring this, the bits involved, especially the flashes to Liz on the beach, weren't all that inspired." [...] Canning also was critical of Jack and Elisa's story as he felt it was weak. Overall, he rated the episode a 7.6 out of 10. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad wrote, [...] "Is it just me or was this one of the more lacking episodes of 30 Rock? It's not that it was terrible... but this one just seemed to meander. It wasn't as funny as other episodes... and that whole crew-as-zombies-with-the-flu stuff was a little bit too surreal, even for this show." [...] Further in his review, Sassone wrote that the Tracy and Jenna subplot started funny, but ended [...] "in a lame, predictable manner." [...] Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger, also disliked [...] "Flu Shot", opining that it was a disappointment. Sepinwall further added that the Jack and Elisa story [...] "felt <b>like</b> <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a bad '80s sitcom – and not even the 30 Rock take on a bad '80s sitcom episode." [...] Sepinwall, however, wrote that the episode did have a good moment with Kenneth suggesting to Tracy that he and Jenna get soup for the sick crew themselves, and with Tracy replying [...] "With what? My arms?".|$|E

This aspect is <b>like</b> <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Lovecraft, although it is not exploited as well as it could have been." [...] Producer-director Bert I. Gordon said he did not care whether reviews were bad; what mattered was whether people went to see the film: [...] "The movie audience these days consists almost entirely of teenagers. Either they're naïve and go to get scared, or they're sophisticated and enjoy scoffing at the pictures. There isn't much a teenager can scoff at these days, you know."

2500|$|In July, Feige {{discussed}} specific {{moments in}} the film, including an homage to The Amazing Spider-Man issue 33 where Parker is trapped underneath rubble, something Feige [...] "wanted {{to see in a}} movie for a long, long time". Daley said that they added the scene to the script because of how much Feige wanted it, and explained, [...] "We have [...] starting the scene with such self-doubt and helplessness, in a way that you really see the kid. You feel for him. He's screaming for help, because he doesn't think he can do it, and then ... he kind of realizes that that's been his biggest problem." [...] Feige compared the film's final scene, where Parker accidentally reveals that he is Spider-Man to his Aunt May, to the ending of Iron Man when Stark reveals that he is Iron Man to the world, saying, [...] "what does that mean for the next movie? I don't know, but it will force us to do something unique." [...] Goldstein added that it [...] "diminishes what is often the most trivial part of superhero worlds, which is finding your secret. It takes the emphasis off that [...] lets her become part of what's really his life". Feige also talked about the film's revelation that the Vulture is the father of Parker's love interest, saying, [...] "If that didn't work, the movie didn't work. We worked backwards and forwards from that moment. It was like two movies—it was the movie up until then and the movie after that moment. Because it had to surprise you, but it had to be true, also.

Watts said the revelation scene and the following interactions between the Vulture and Parker were, [...] "more than anything else, [...] I was looking forward to, and I got {{to have a lot of}} fun shooting that stuff." [...] Goldstein said the scene after the reveal, where Vulture realizes that Parker is Spider-Man while driving him to the school dance, was the moment he was most proud of in the film, and Daley said that scene's effect on audiences was the dramatic equivalent of an audience laughing at a joke they had written. He added that the writers were [...] "giddy when we first came up with , because it's taking the obvious tension of meeting the father of the girl that you have a crush on, and multiplying it by 1,000, when you also realize he's the guy you've been trying to stop the whole time." ...|$|E

5000|$|MTV's Charlie Norwood {{has also}} praised the single stating: [...] "Joey Badass is {{definitely}} riding some '90s nostalgia vibes on his latest track, [...] "Unorthodox," [...] with a classic hip-hop beat produced by {{none other than}} golden era icon DJ Premier. It {{was only a matter of}} time until the Brooklyn-bred '90s hip-hop revivalist (and MTV 2013 Artist To Watch) would hook up with hip-hop's Brooklyn godfather, and the beat is an instant classic, similar to DJ Premier's own (former) group, Gang Starr. With some obscure record samples chopped up with drum machine patterns and his signature scratches, Joey spits a super-lyrical flow, running through an endless string of multi-syllabic punch lines that would even make New York greats like Big Pun take notice. Chicago Reader positively reviewed the song saying: [...] " [...] With Premier's typically frosty production and Badass' impressively grimy vocals, [...] "Unorthodox" [...] sounds <b>like</b> <b>something</b> straight <b>out</b> <b>of</b> 1990, which is all the more remarkable when you consider that that was five years before the rapper was born." ...|$|R
