5000|$|<b>Lithol</b> <b>Rubine</b> BK is {{a reddish}} {{synthetic}} azo dye. It has {{the appearance of}} a red powder and magenta when printed. It is slightly soluble in hot water, insoluble in cold water, and insoluble in ethanol. When dissolved in dimethylformamide, its absorption maximum lies at about 442 nm. It is usually supplied as a calcium salt. [...] It is prepared by azo coupling with 3-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid.It is used to dye plastics, paints, printing inks, and for textile printing. It is normally used as a standard magenta in the three and four color printing processes.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the same}} year, two British chemists, Chambers Nicolson and George Maule, {{working at the}} {{laboratory}} of the paint manufacturer George Simpson, located in Walworth, south of London, made another aniline dye with a similar red-purple color, which they began to manufacture in 1860 under the name [...] "roseine". In 1860 they changed {{the name of the}} color to [...] "magenta", in honor of the Battle of Magenta fought between the French and Austrians at Magenta, Lombardy the year before, and the new color became a commercial success.Starting in 1935 the family of quinacridone dyes was developed. These have colors ranging from red to violet, so nowadays a quinacridone dye is often used for magenta. Various tones of magenta—light, bright, brilliant, vivid, rich, or deep—may be formulated by adding varying amounts of white to quinacridone artist's paints.Another dye used for magenta is <b>Lithol</b> <b>Rubine</b> BK. One of its uses is as a food coloring.|$|E

For direct current (DC) mode, with the current at a constant potential, and measurements with suitable experimental parameters, a linear concentration from 0. 125 to 1. 80 [*]μg/mL was found. The detection limit of our method was approximately 2. 0 [*]ng/mL. An antimony-modified silver detector was used to demonstrate that LRB is electrochemically reduced in acidic media and to analyze commercial cosmetics to determine their LRB content. Findings using HPLC-ECD and HPLC with an ultraviolet detector were comparable...|$|E
