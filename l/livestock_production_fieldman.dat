Since, livestock grazing practices in Saudi Arabia has changed from the traditional pastoral system to a more sophisticated, business oriented practice, it was essential to study <b>livestock</b> <b>production</b> cost function on rangelands to determine the optimum herd size. The study is based on survey research of <b>livestock</b> <b>production</b> on rangelands (sheep, goats and camels) in Rumah area. 	The cubic functional form for the total cost function is applied on two classes of grazers (only sheep and goats, and sheep, goats and camels) to determine the optimum economical hard size of <b>livestock</b> <b>production.</b> The relation between <b>livestock</b> <b>production</b> and the herd size is also considered. Results indicated that herds constituted of sheep, goats and camels are smaller than those of only sheep and goats for the same <b>livestock</b> <b>production</b> level.

40|$|Global {{demand for}} {{livestock}} products {{is expected to}} double by 2050, mainly due to improvement in the worldwide standard of living. Meanwhile, climate change {{is a threat to}} <b>livestock</b> <b>production</b> because of the impact on quality of feed crop and forage, water availability, animal and milk <b>production,</b> <b>livestock</b> diseases, animal reproduction, and biodiversity. This study reviews the global impacts of climate change on <b>livestock</b> <b>production,</b> the contribution of <b>livestock</b> <b>production</b> to climate change, and specific climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies in the <b>livestock</b> sector. <b>Livestock</b> <b>production</b> will be limited by climate variability as animal water consumption is expected to increase by a factor of three, demand for agricultural lands increase due to need for 70 % growth in production, and food security concern since about one-third of the global cereal harvest is used for livestock feed. Meanwhile, the livestock sector contributes 14. 5 % of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, driving further climate change. Consequently, the livestock sector will be a key player in the mitigation of GHG emissions and improving global food security. Therefore, in the transition to sustainable <b>livestock</b> <b>production,</b> there is a need for: a) assessments related to the use of adaptation and mitigation measures tailored to the location and <b>livestock</b> <b>production</b> system in use, and b) policies that support and facilitate the implementation of climate change adaptation and mitigation measures...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates how {{land tenure}} reform has {{affected}} <b>livestock</b> <b>production</b> in the pastoral areas of China. County-level data for Inner Mongolia between 1985 and 2008 {{are used in}} a fixed effects model to disentangle the effects of land tenure reform on <b>livestock</b> <b>production</b> from factors related to market forces, grassland condition, technological development and environmental heterogeneity. The {{results show that the}} implementation of the land tenure reform slowed down the increase in <b>livestock</b> <b>production,</b> although it did not completely stop this increase. It therefore appears that land reform is in itself unable to offset the impact of other factors that accelerate the increase in <b>livestock</b> <b>production.</b> Moreover, the constraining effect of the land tenure reform on the increase in <b>livestock</b> <b>production</b> decreases over time, and ultimately disappears. Finally, the constraining effect of the land tenure reform was shown to be stronger on the increase of the livestock population than on that of meat output. This indicates that the land tenure reform has helped to improve livestock productivity. </p...|$|R

The authors conclude that, whilst the available data are limited and the implementation of the EC regulation is relatively recent, there is little evidence to suggest that organic livestock management causes major threats to {{animal health and welfare}} in comparison with conventional systems. There are, however, some well-identified areas, like parasite control and balanced ration formulation, where efforts are needed to find solutions that meet with organic standard requirements and guarantee high levels of health and welfare. It is suggested that, whilst organic standards offer an implicit framework for animal health and welfare management, there is a need to solve apparent conflicts between the organic farming objectives in regard to environment, public health, farmer income and animal health and welfare. The key challenges for the future of organic <b>livestock</b> <b>production</b> in Europe are related to the feasibility of implementing improved husbandry inputs and the development of evidence-based decision support systems for health and feeding management.

30|$|There {{is little}} doubt that some of the {{contributors}} to the two volumes are already well known by their readers. The authors have made an important attempt to review a vast literature on global <b>livestock</b> <b>production</b> systems. In my view this attempt by the authors to provide global perspectives of shifting <b>livestock</b> <b>production</b> has benefitted many agencies (as is shown by the list of supporting institutions). The global and regional attention given to <b>livestock</b> sector <b>production</b> is therefore a welcome development. In volume 1 (which consists of 20 Chapters), the focus is on developed and developing countries. Global <b>livestock</b> <b>production</b> is consumer driven, as the demand for food (particularly {{on the part of the}} growing urban populations) increases. By highlighting the different geographical dimensions of the production and the transfer of livestock-based production, the book aims to show linkages between the formal and informal market food chains. The emphasis is on environmental impacts. <b>Livestock</b> <b>production</b> and its impacts on the immediate environment is influenced by multiple drivers. The book identifies these drivers as population growth, shifts in technology and rising demand for human food and animal feed. All of these are responsible for a move from agriculture to <b>livestock</b> <b>production.</b> However, these developments have not been felt equally across the developed and developing countries and between low and high population density countries. Greater demands for higher calorific intake in such regions as South-East Asia and East Asia, which also have a higher consumption index, show them to be the main shifters when it comes to <b>livestock</b> <b>production.</b> In sub-Saharan Africa, with a negative consumptive calorific index, demand is lower. The book in Volume 1 outlines the different systems of <b>livestock</b> <b>production.</b> The gradients of <b>livestock</b> <b>production</b> vary according to whether the system is extensive, mixed or intensive. Extensive systems, such as those practiced in the dry tropics, have low stocking rates and low quality feed from natural pastures. Extensive systems however require large grazing areas. The book shows that where the extensive systems break down because of land-use competition, the <b>livestock</b> <b>production</b> system shifts to smaller-scale mixed systems, such as those found in agro-pastoral systems. These systems are practiced in the developing countries, while in the developed countries, with their greater demand for food, <b>livestock</b> <b>production</b> tends to be intensive. In the intensive system, the economy of scale is more preferred to meet the increasing demands for livestock products than small scale units of production. These specialized systems rely on concentrate feed, and call for greater investment in technology and energy use.|$|R

40|$|Informed {{livestock}} sector {{policy development}} and priority setting is {{heavily dependent on}} {{a good understanding of}} <b>livestock</b> <b>production</b> systems. In a collaborative effort between the Food and Agriculture Organization and the International Livestock Research Institute, stock has been taken of where we have come from in agricultural systems classification and mapping; {{the current state of the}} art; and the directions in which research and data collection efforts need to take in the future. The book also addresses issues relating to the intensity and scale of production, moving from what is done to how it is done. The intensification of production is an area of particular importance, for it is in the intensive systems that changes are occurring most rapidly and where most information is needed on the implications that intensification of production may have for livelihoods, poverty alleviation, animal diseases, public health and environmental outcomes. A series of case studies is provided, linking <b>livestock</b> <b>production</b> systems to rural livelihoods and poverty and examples of the application of <b>livestock</b> <b>production</b> system maps are drawn from <b>livestock</b> <b>production,</b> now and in the future; livestock's impact on the global environment; animal and public health; and livestock and livelihoods.

40|$|<b>Livestock</b> <b>production</b> {{is one of}} {{the largest}} and fastest growing {{agricultural}} subsectors in the world, contributing almost 40 % of agricultural GDP. The present global trend of livestock intensification affects water demand, resulting in local alterations of hydrological features. This study quantifies water requirements for <b>livestock</b> <b>production</b> and links them to local changes in water-related ecosystem services (WRES). It examines the present situation in Uruguayan beef production as it undergoes an intensification process by analyzing three systems: traditional extensive production, mixed systems and intensive production. Mixed production systems are most water-effective in terms of water requirement. However, extensive production has the least negative long-term effects on the studied WRESs: soil productivity, erosion control and grass, crop and <b>livestock</b> <b>production.</b> Intensive systems contribute the largest negative impacts on soil productivity due to management practices, e. g. continuous cropping and fertilizer application (which is also costly). However, intensification also increases short-term positive effects on crop and <b>livestock</b> <b>production.</b> Mixed systems offer opportunities to increase <b>livestock</b> <b>production,</b> water use efficiency and mitigate soil degradation. However, a threshold value to avoid an undesirable regime shift in soil productivity remains to be determined. This framework developed herein, maps and quantifies local ecosystem effects associated with <b>livestock</b> <b>production</b> from a water perspective. It required simplifications and thus needs further improvements to be of practical use as a tool for best management practices of <b>livestock</b> <b>production.</b> Such tools can assist decision-makers in Uruguay on how to manage multiple ecosystem services in an agricultural landscape and enhance the provision of desired ES without degrading other key ecosystem processes, goods and services.
