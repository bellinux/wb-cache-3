5|$|Surgical {{sterilization}} {{is available}} in the form of tubal <b>ligation</b> for women and vasectomy for men. There are no significant long-term side effects, and tubal <b>ligation</b> decreases the risk of ovarian cancer. Short term complications are twenty times less likely from a vasectomy than a tubal <b>ligation.</b> After a vasectomy, there may be swelling and pain of the scrotum which usually resolves in a week or two. With tubal <b>ligation,</b> complications occur in 1 to 2 percent of procedures with serious complications usually due to the anesthesia. Neither method offers protection from sexually transmitted infections.|$|E
5|$|Birth control {{methods include}} barrier methods, {{hormonal}} birth control, intrauterine devices (IUDs), sterilization, and behavioral methods. They are used before or during sex while emergency contraceptives are effective {{for up to}} a few days after sex. Effectiveness is generally expressed as the percentage of women who become pregnant using a given method during the first year, and sometimes as a lifetime failure rate among methods with high effectiveness, such as tubal <b>ligation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Celsus (25 BC– AD 14) {{described}} <b>ligation</b> and excision procedures, {{and discussed}} the possible complications. Galen advocated severing {{the connection of}} the arteries to veins, claiming it reduced both pain {{and the spread of}} gangrene. The Susruta Samhita (4th–5th century AD) is similar to the words of Hippocrates, but emphasizes wound cleanliness. In the 13th century, European surgeons such as Lanfranc of Milan, Guy de Chauliac, Henri de Mondeville, and John of Ardene made great progress and development of the surgical techniques.|$|E

A total of 46 <b>ligations</b> were performed. The additional treatment required was hysterectomy to control haemorrhage. Intra-and post-operative complications were noted. A comparative review of the effectiveness of IAL in different situations is done and alternative modalities of treatment are considered...|$|R
5|$|In 1979, Bruce Cunningham and {{his colleagues}} {{discovered}} the first instance of a circularly permuted protein in nature. After determining the peptide sequence of the lectin protein favin, they noticed its similarity to a known protein– concanavalin A– except that the ends were circularly permuted. Later work confirmed the circular permutation between the pair and showed that concanavalin A is permuted post-translationally through cleavage and an unusual protein <b>ligation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Short {{proteins}} {{can also}} be synthesized chemically by a family of methods known as peptide synthesis, which rely on organic synthesis techniques such as chemical <b>ligation</b> to produce peptides in high yield. Chemical synthesis allows for the introduction of non-natural amino acids into polypeptide chains, such as attachment of fluorescent probes to amino acid side chains. These methods are useful in laboratory biochemistry and cell biology, though generally not for commercial applications. Chemical synthesis is inefficient for polypeptides longer than about 300 amino acids, and the synthesized proteins may not readily assume their native tertiary structure. Most chemical synthesis methods proceed from C-terminus to N-terminus, opposite the biological reaction.|$|E
5|$|This {{decision}} {{may cause}} regret in some men and women. Of women aged over 30 who have undergone tubal <b>ligation,</b> about 5% regret their decision, {{as compared with}} 20% of women aged under 30. By contrast, less than 5% of men are likely to regret sterilization. Men more likely to regret sterilization are younger, have young or no children, or have an unstable marriage. In a survey of biological parents, 9% stated {{they would not have}} had children if they were able to do it over again.|$|E

5|$|Deoxyribozymes, {{also called}} DNAzymes or {{catalytic}} DNA, are first discovered in 1994. They are mostly single stranded DNA sequences isolated {{from a large}} pool of random DNA sequences through a combinatorial approach called in vitro selection or systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). DNAzymes catalyze variety of chemical reactions including RNA-DNA cleavage, RNA-DNA <b>ligation,</b> amino acids phosphorylation-dephosphorylation, carbon-carbon bond formation, and etc. DNAzymes can enhance catalytic rate of chemical reactions up to 100,000,000,000-fold over the uncatalyzed reaction. The most extensively studied class of DNAzymes is RNA-cleaving types which {{have been used to}} detect different metal ions and designing therapeutic agents. Several metal-specific DNAzymes have been reported including the GR-5 DNAzyme (lead-specific), the CA1-3 DNAzymes (copper-specific), the 39E DNAzyme (uranyl-specific) and the NaA43 DNAzyme (sodium-specific). The NaA43 DNAzyme, which is reported to be more than 10,000-fold selective for sodium over other metal ions, was used to make a real-time sodium sensor in living cells.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} after the fire One Meridian Plaza {{stood in the middle}} of Philadelphia vacant. The fate of the {{building}} was up in the air as the building's owners and the insurance company prepared for <b>ligation</b> on how to proceed with repairs, who would control those repairs, and at what cost. E/R Partners were proposing deconstructing the building down to the 19th floor and rebuilding from there. Aetna Corporation, the fire insurer, claimed that girders above the 19th level could be repaired and used cutting $115 million in repair costs from the owner's $250 million estimate. Aetna also proposed taking over the reconstruction. E/R Partners spent $50 million securing One Meridian Plaza and spent up to $500,000 a month on security guards, utilities and inspections by engineers as the building stood empty.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Kumar, et al., first {{described}} a sequence tag {{corresponding to the}} NEDD9 3′ untranslated region based on the cloning {{of a group of}} genes predominantly expressed in the brain of embryonic, but not adult mice, a group of genes designated neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated. In 1996, two groups independently described the complete sequence of the NEDD9 gene, and provided initial functional analysis of NEDD9 protein. Law et al. overexpressed a human cDNA library in S. cerevisiae, and screened for genes that simultaneously affected cell cycle and cell polarity controls, inducing a filamentous yeast budding phenotype, and thus identified the HEF1 protein (Human Enhancer of Filamentation 1). This study identified HEF1/NEDD9 as an interactive partner for focal adhesion kinase (FAK), connecting it to integrin signaling. Separately, Minegishi et al. cloned the gene encoding a protein hyperphosphorylated following <b>ligation</b> of β1-integrins in T cells and hypothesized {{to play a role in}} the process of T cell costimulation, designating this gene Cas-L (Crk-associated substrate-related protein, Lymphocyte type).|$|E

40|$|Bacterial {{artificial}} chromosome (BAC) libraries play {{a pivotal}} role in genomics studies. A crucial step in BAC library construction is the transformation of Escherichia coli by electroporation. Absolute efficiency (cfu/microgram DNA) is affected by a number of factors including the topological form and treatment of DNA samples. Here we report a simple new protocol using tRNA assisted precipitation that increased transformation efficiency by 70 -fold for BAC <b>ligations</b> and up to 400 -fold for plasmid <b>ligations.</b> The mechanism may involve altering or stabilizing the topographical form of the DNA molecules...|$|R
50|$|Common {{emergency}} cases include child delivery, traumatic injuries, pelvic bleeding, intestinal obstruction, and peritonitis. Some of the surgeries performed include thyroidectomies, tonsillectomies, vagotomies, pyloroplasties, chronic osteomyelitis amputations, hysterectomies, tubal <b>ligations,</b> C-sections {{as well as}} eye surgeries.|$|R
5|$|The most {{effective}} methods {{of birth control}} are sterilization by means of vasectomy in males and tubal <b>ligation</b> in females, intrauterine devices (IUDs), and implantable birth control. This {{is followed by a}} number of hormone-based methods including oral pills, patches, vaginal rings, and injections. Less effective methods include physical barriers such as condoms, diaphragms and birth control sponges and fertility awareness methods. The least effective methods are spermicides and withdrawal by the male before ejaculation. Sterilization, while highly effective, is not usually reversible; all other methods are reversible, most immediately upon stopping them. Safe sex practices, such as with the use of male or female condoms, can also help prevent sexually transmitted infections. Other methods of birth control do not protect against sexually transmitted diseases. Emergency birth control can prevent pregnancy if taken within the 72 to 120 hours after unprotected sex. Some argue not having sex as a form of birth control, but abstinence-only sex education may increase teenage pregnancies if offered without birth control education, due to non-compliance.|$|E
5|$|The {{thrust of}} Stern's defense is that Della Guardia and Molto have framed Rusty {{in order to}} cover up the bribery case. During the {{cross-examination}} of the coroner, it is revealed that Carolyn underwent a tubal <b>ligation,</b> thus having no reason to use the spermicidal contraceptive which was found on her. Stern asserts that the only explanation for this discrepancy is that the fluid sample was not actually taken from Carolyn's body. Based on the disappearance of the beer glass, the lack of motive {{and the fact that the}} fluid sample was rendered meaningless, Judge Lyttle dismisses the charges. Rusty confronts Stern for bringing up the bribery file in the case. Stern swears him to secrecy, revealing that Lyttle had a brief sexual encounter with Carolyn. Stern also confesses that he and Raymond knew that Lyttle was taking bribes, and although Lyttle had offered his resignation, Raymond felt that he was a brilliant judge and deserved another chance. Lipranzer meets with Rusty and reveals the missing beer glass, explaining that he never returned it to evidence when the investigation was turned over to Della Guardia and Molto. Rusty throws it into a river.|$|E
25|$|Surgery {{may be used}} if medical {{management}} fails or in case of cervical lacerations or tear or uterine rupture. Methods used {{may include}} uterine artery <b>ligation,</b> ovarian artery <b>ligation,</b> internal iliac artery <b>ligation,</b> selective arterial embolization, B-lynch suture, and hysterectomy. Bleeding caused by traumatic causes should be management by surgical repair. When there is bleeding due to uterine rupture a repair can be performed {{but most of the}} time a hysterectomy is needed.|$|E

25|$|These were {{achieved}} by allowing adaptor <b>ligation</b> {{to be carried}} out at 16℃ for 16 hours to increase adaptor <b>ligation</b> efficiency and recovery. The most important adaptation is during enzymatic and clean-up steps; they are performed with-bead, in order to minimize tube transfer steps which increases recovery.|$|E
25|$|Adapter <b>ligation</b> {{efficiency}} {{is very important}} in a successful duplex sequencing. Extra amount of libraries or adapters can affect the DNA:adapter balance and therefore result in inefficient <b>ligation</b> and excess amount of primer dimers, respectively.

5000|$|Sterilization {{procedures}} are {{generally considered to}} have low risk of side effects, though some persons and organizations disagree. [...] Female sterilization is a more significant operation than vasectomy, and has greater risks; in industrialized nations, mortality is 4 per 100,000 tubal <b>ligations,</b> versus 0.1 per 100,000 vasectomies.|$|R
5000|$|The {{majority}} of the physicians performing the sterilizations decided that sterilization was the best alternative for these women. They claimed it would improve their financial situation and {{improve the quality of}} life for the children that they already had. Additionally, with fewer people applying for Medicaid and welfare, the federal government could decrease spending on welfare programs. The physicians were also paid more for performing hysterectomies and tubal <b>ligations</b> than for prescribing other forms of birth control. The influx of surgical procedures was seen as a way for new physicians to train and resident physicians to practice. When a student in 1971 asked why hysterectomies were favored over tubal <b>ligations,</b> Dr. James Ryan responded that [...] "it's more of a challenge...and it's good experience for the junior resident".|$|R

25|$|Tubal <b>ligation</b> can {{predispose}} to ectopic pregnancy. Reversal of tubal sterilization (Tubal reversal) {{carries a}} risk for ectopic pregnancy. This is higher if more destructive methods of tubal <b>ligation</b> (tubal cautery, partial {{removal of the}} tubes) have been used than less destructive methods (tubal clipping). A history of a tubal pregnancy {{increases the risk of}} future occurrences to about 10%. This risk is not reduced by removing the affected tube, even if the other tube appears normal. The best method for diagnosing this is to do an early ultrasound.|$|E
25|$|Tubal <b>ligation</b> is {{protective}} because carcinogens {{are unable}} to reach the ovary and fimbriae via the vagina, uterus, and Fallopian tubes. Tubal <b>ligation</b> is also protective in women with the BRCA1 mutation, but not the BRCA2 mutation. Hysterectomy reduces the risk, and removal of both Fallopian tubes and ovaries (bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) dramatically {{reduces the risk of}} not only ovarian cancer, but breast cancer as well. This is still a topic of research, as the link between hysterectomy and lower ovarian cancer risk is controversial. The reasons that hysterectomy may be protective have not been elucidated as of 2015.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} {{the need for}} human biologists {{to take into account}} the far-reaching influences of biomedicine in the study of reproductive aging. Data were drawn from western Massachusetts and Puebla, Mexico, to illustrate the effects of hysterectomy rates, tubal <b>ligations</b> and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on studies of age and symptom experience at menopause. First, in examining age at natural menopause in relation to level of education, a country-specific, non-random pattern of participant exclusion due to hysterectomies was encountered. Second, in examining symptom frequency in relation to late childbearing, sample sizes were very small in part due to a high frequency of tubal <b>ligations</b> (43 %) in Puebla, Mexico. Third, hot flash frequency during the two weeks prior to interview was, unexpectedly, not lower among women who used HRT. Human biologists who study the biological process of reproductive aging must also attend to the cultural influences of biomedicine...|$|R
