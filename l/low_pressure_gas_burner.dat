50|$|There are {{numerous}} experiments worldwide attempting {{to detect the}} energy deposition {{that is expected to}} occur when a WIMP directly collides with an atom of ordinary matter. Ultra sensitive experiments are required to detect the low energy and extremely rare interaction that is predicted to occur between a WIMP and the nucleus of an atom in a target material. The DRIFT detectors vary from the majority of WIMP detectors in their use of a <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>gas</b> as a target material. The <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>gas</b> means that an interaction within the detector causes an ionisation track of measurable length compared to the point like interactions seen in detectors with solid or liquid target materials. Such ionisation tracks can be reconstructed in three dimensions to determine not only the type of particle that caused it, but from which direction the particle came. This directional sensitivity has the potential to prove the existence of WIMPs by their distinct directional signature.|$|R

The Directional Recoil Identification From Tracks (DRIFT) collaboration {{is attempting to}} utilize the predicted directionality of the WIMP signal. DRIFT uses a carbon disulfide target, that allows WIMP recoils to travel several millimetres, leaving a track of charged particles. This charged track is drifted to an MWPC readout plane that allows it to be reconstructed in three dimensions and determine the origin direction. DMTPC is a similar experiment with CF4 gas.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} radical {{production}} in atmospheric pressure water containing plasmas is discussed. As OH {{is often an}} important radical in these discharges the paper focuses on OH production. Besides nanosecond pulsed coronas and diffusive glow discharges, several other atmospheric pressure plasmas which are of interest nowadays have a typical electron temperature in the range 1 – 2 eV and an ionization degree of 10 - 5 – 10 - 4. These properties are {{quite different from the}} typical plasma properties known from <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>gas</b> discharges. In the plasma physics literature OH production is primarily ascribed to be due to electron, metastable induced or thermal dissociation of water, processes which are dominant in (<b>low</b> <b>pressure)</b> <b>gas</b> discharges and in combustion and hot flames. It is shown in this paper that for several atmospheric pressure plasmas also dissociative recombination can be an effective method of OH radical production. Several examples are presented in detail. This paper provides a basic framework for OH production in atmospheric pressure plasmas and shows that accurate knowledge of ne, Te, Tg, the dominant ionic species, radical and neutral species are indispensable to obtain a complete view on the chemical kinetics in these challenging complex atmospheric pressure plasmas. A few relevant plasma diagnostics together with their limitations are also briefly discussed in this context...|$|R

40|$|In many {{examples}} {{of the use of}} mid-infrared quantum cascade (QC) lasers for gas detection or process monitoring, an assumption is made that their use is an obvious extension of tuneable diode laser spectroscopy. We wish to show that making such an assumption is not necessarily justified when the frequency sweep rate is rapid, as is down-chirped QC laser infrared radiation. This is demonstrated via a series of experiments designed to investigate the physics of the interaction of chirped infrared laser radiation with <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>gases.</b> The unusual signals, which characterise the rapid passage of the down-chirped radiation through a <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>gas,</b> are due to two main effects, the laser sweep rate, and the long path length of the refocusing cells used. The sweep rate of the laser frequency may be faster than the inter-molecular collision frequency, allowing the build up of a strong molecular alignment within the gas. The long optical path lengths in the refocusing absorption cells, used to facilitate sensitive detection of trace gases, allow the build up of a large macroscopic polarisation within the gas cell. We give examples of this behaviour in molecules with large transition dipole moments, ammonia and nitrous oxide, and with a very small one (OCO) -O- 18 -C- 12 -O- 16. We also outline the use of Maxwell-Bloch calculations to investigate the origins of this behaviour, and hence to define operating conditions where the concentration of trace molecules may be determined...|$|R
