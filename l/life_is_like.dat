5|$|Glee club {{director}} Will Schuester {{is informed}} that the school budget will not cover a handicap-accessible bus to transport the glee club to sectionals, which means that Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) will have to travel separately {{from the rest of}} the club. Will encourages the other club members to support Artie, not only by holding a bake sale to raise funds for a handicap bus, but also by spending time in wheelchairs to experience what <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> for him. Meanwhile, Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) is struggling to cover the medical expenses of her pregnancy, and threatens to break up with Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) if he cannot pay her ultrasound bill. Puck (Mark Salling) fights with Finn, whom he feels is not doing enough to support Quinn. By including cannabis in the cupcakes, Puck ensures the bake sale is a success and offers Quinn the money raised. She apologizes for previously calling him a loser, but refuses to accept the money, and is relieved when Finn is able to find a job.|$|E

The urban version [...] "attacks" [...] with a modern and aggressive beat; the bachata version is slower, with Luny Tunes' tropical rhythms. In the lyrics, Ivy Queen declares to a rival: [...] "The guy you're dating is mine, {{and you know}} it, but here's the detail: He's worthless in bed. That's why I'm here to congratulate you for setting me free, I have to confess". The reggaeton rhymes tell a story of revenge and lovesickness. Angie Romero of Latina Magazine describes the song as a [...] "powerful and pulsating break-up anthem." ...|$|E

500|$|Madlax is {{set against}} the {{backdrop}} of Gazth-Sonikan war and the first episodes contrast the tranquil Nafrece with the war-torn Gazth-Sonika; later, the story moves completely to the combat zone, focusing on the central characters, such as Limelda Jorg, and their suffering. In an interview, the director Mashimo stated that [...] "he story is about portraying inner struggles of people, while showing what <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> in this place of madness and this other place of peace". Accordingly, the series' title is a portmanteau of two English words, [...] "" [...] and [...] "", mirroring the authors' intention to portray the two extremes of human being.|$|E
500|$|Blitz {{believed}} that Hal's stuttering was {{a metaphor for}} his lack of mastery of life and love: [...] "He can't control this thing {{that ought to be}} so simple... And so much of his <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> that." [...] Journalist Mark Baumer highlighted the juxtaposition of Hal with the fast-talking debaters, who are at opposite ends of the spectrum with their speech but are both struggling with communication and expression. Blitz said that [...] "Even when [...] can speak incredibly fast and are packing their sentences with tons of SAT words, they still don't know exactly what they're talking about. There is still a question about whether their content of what they're talking about matches up with what they're feeling or trying to express. Whether it's the kid who's talking a million miles an hour, but saying nothing or the kid who isn't able to get out any word at all they're both at the mercy of not knowing how to express what's inside them." ...|$|E
500|$|A survey {{conducted}} by Minnesota's Department for Families and Children's Services shows that men consider child care {{to be far more}} important than a paycheck. Of 600 dads surveyed, a majority said their most important role was to [...] "show love and affection" [...] to kids. [...] "Safety and protection" [...] came next, followed by [...] "moral guidance," [...] "taking time to play," [...] and [...] "teaching and encouraging." [...] "Financial care" [...] finished last. [...] Many men are now becoming more involved in their children's lives, and because of that many men now {{have a better understanding of}} what <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> for their child growing up in modern society. [...] Because fathers are immersed in their children's lives, many of the stereotypically [...] "manly" [...] attitudes and activities historically prescribed for children may be circumscribed due to a more gender-neutral parenting approach that focuses on promoting independence and emotional well being. This allows children, especially male children, to grow up with a greater capacity for empathy and less rigidity in attitudes pertaining to gender roles than would perhaps be the case in more traditionally-structured households.|$|E

Mr. Burns takes notice of the party's success and decides to promote Homer to [...] "Account Man" [...] for the Springfield Nuclear Plant. Robert Marlow, a {{seasoned}} account veteran, takes Homer under his wing and shows Homer what the high <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> in the corner office. The job changes Homer into a sad individual, who drinks {{in the dark and}} complains about the meaninglessness of his job. When Homer's long hours at the office become the norm and Homer becomes distant from his family, a family vacation with Marge and the children help him realize that family always comes before work. Meanwhile, Lisa introduces Bart to a new literary world which sparks his interest in reading classic novels. In the beginning, Bart struggles with reading and suggests that he should just get a job where he does not have to read. Lisa insists and Bart eventually learns to read properly. When the bullies watches him reading a classic novel at school, they force him to read Little Women to them.|$|E
500|$|Reviews for The Boys from Baghdad High were {{generally}} favourable. The Huffington Post said that giving the video cameras {{to the students}} was an excellent idea because the depiction of their school-life versus the increasing danger was captured [...] "with neutral equality [...] that the film is able to capture the interiority of its subjects more acutely than a straight-forward examination of violence would". Thomas Sutcliffe of The Independent said, [...] "its storyline was governed not by a tick-list of stock narrative dilemmas and secrets but the cruel uncertainties that occupation and insurgency have brought to Baghdad." [...] Time Out New York gave the film five out of five stars, and PopMatters rated it 8 out of 10. The Washington Posts Paul Farhi said, [...] "HBO has carved a niche as the TV home {{of some of the}} most compelling programs about the Iraq war ... Baghdad High does no harm to HBO's burgeoning war cred." [...] Variety, The Christian Science Monitor, LA Weekly, and the Los Angeles Times also praised the film. At the Question-and-Answer session following a screening at the Tribeca Film Festival, one audience member, a new recruit to the United States Marine Corps, told Ali, who had also attended, [...] "I finally know what <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> behind those walls and what you guys are like, and it's been really, really fantastic." ...|$|E

2500|$|George Mills Harper {{suggests}} that the impetus for Blake's creation of [...] "Ah! Sun-flower" [...] came from his reading of Thomas Taylor's introduction to and translation of The Hymns of Orpheus (1792). Through the words of Plotinus, everything in the universe participates in the [...] "first good", symbolized by the Sun. Blake said that [...] "every natural effect has a spiritual cause": the Sunflower's apparent following of {{the movement of the}} Sun is not just a natural effect, but is also the result of divine nature attracting the souls of plants and, as with the Youth and Virgin, human beings. For Taylor and Blake (who may have known Taylor as well as read him), material <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> a prison: the Sunflower and the humans, who are literally and figuratively rooted to and buried within the materialistic earth, wish to escape to divine eternity.|$|E
2500|$|The Wildhearts next {{planned a}} double album, but East West vetoed this plan during the {{recording}} sessions. Instead the band released {{a collection of}} six of the more eclectic tracks on a fan club-only release entitled Fishing For Luckies in early 1995. This EP, which would be re-released in 1996 with more studio outtakes as Fishing for More Luckies, included the notable track [...] "Geordie In Wonderland". Ginger offered this track to Kevin Keegan and Newcastle United F.C. as a potential team anthem, but was graciously turned down. The track was performed on Top of the Pops with Wolfsbane's Jeff Hateley, painted in Toon Army colours, on mandolin. Other noteworthy tracks included [...] "If <b>Life</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Like</b> A Lovebank, I Want An Overdraft", also released as a single, and the 11:24 epic [...] "Sky Babies." [...] Despite frequent fan requests, this track was rarely performed live, reputedly because of Danny McCormack's inability to remember his bass parts throughout the entire song. In 2003-2004 the band began to play [...] "Sky Babies" [...] at nearly every show with new bassist Jon Poole.|$|E
2500|$|Baron, who {{describes}} bottling as a [...] "traumatic time for wine", has said, [...] "To me, wine {{has always been}} more than something to drink. My family’s love and appreciation of good food, the time I’ve spent in France and the many mentors I've had along the way have led me to {{an appreciation of the}} role wine plays in daily life as well as history and culture. To me, creating wine is one of the ways people preserve civilization." [...] Baron has also said, [...] "Even after years of experience, every vintage feels like a childbirth-if we remembered how much it hurt, we might never do it again. And wines are much like our children. Their personality is there from day one, and we can track it through, know its essence even if its behavior at any particular moment is off. You get a feel from all of this of where the fruit has been and where it’s going. You have to remember this when you think about judging wines. They're alive and changing moment to moment; they have good days and bad; they show well in a particular glass or with particular food. Judging a wine at any particular moment in its <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> giving a kid a letter grade based on his behavior in the supermarket." ...|$|E
