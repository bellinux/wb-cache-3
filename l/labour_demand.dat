Spending on relief work and public works was also significantly increased to alleviate unemployment, while the Local Government Board regulations governing the type of work provided by distress committees and local authorities, together with the eligibility of applicants for relief, were both relaxed. In 1909, the construction of back-to-back houses was finally forbidden. For those in Ireland, the Labourers (Ireland) Act of 1906 empowered Rural Councils to acquire land for labourers’ cottages and plots, while the Town Tenants Act extended “the principle of compensation for improvements at the termination of a lease to the urban tenant.” ...|$|E
2500|$|When Magomero was acquired, it was uncultivated {{and largely}} unoccupied. The first estate crop tried at Magomero was Arabica coffee in 1895, but after poor crops and a {{collapse}} in world coffee prices in 1903, this was abandoned. [...] When Alexander Livingstone Bruce {{came to live}} in Nyasaland, the main estate crop was cotton. In 1908, 1,000 acres of a hardy variety of Upland cotton called Nyasaland Upland was planted at Magomero; this was increased to 5,000 acres by 1914. Cotton required intensive labour throughout its five- or six-month growing season, {{and to ensure that}} sufficient workers were available, estate owners exploited the obligations of a labour tenancy system called thangata. This meant the work done by African tenants on European-owned estates in lieu of rent. Alexander Livingstone Bruce was said to have pioneered the thangata system, and once Magomero started to grow cotton, Bruce, who lived in Nyasaland and had control of the estate operations, instructed his manager to exploit thangata rigorously. When cotton growing started, the Bruce estates increased the <b>labour</b> <b>demand</b> to four or five months a year, mainly in the growing season, leaving tenants little time to grow their food.|$|E
40|$|Although {{research}} suggests {{the important role}} of gender in emotional labour, its effect on the relationship between emotional <b>labour</b> <b>demands</b> and wages has not been examined explicitly. The current study investigates this relationship by testing hypotheses derived from theories of vocational choice and labour market supply and demand. Hypotheses are tested using a unique within-person, between-jobs longitudinal dataset with information on two jobs for each worker in a national sample of U. S. workers (N= 5, 488). After controlling for relevant variables related to wages, results suggest men incur wage penalties of approximately 6 % when moving to occupations with higher emotional <b>labour</b> <b>demands.</b> Women do not experience statistically significant wage effects from moving to an occupation with higher emotional <b>labour</b> <b>demands.</b> These findings are discussed and interpreted based on the theoretical frameworks...|$|R

2500|$|Livingstone {{turned to}} cotton from 1903: growing [...] Egyptian cotton was {{unsuccessful}} {{as it was}} more suitable for hotter areas, but from 1906, he developed a hardier variety of Upland cotton called Nyasaland Upland, and in 1908 planted 1,000 acres at Magomero with it; this was increased to 5,000 acres by 1914. Cotton required intensive labour over a long growing period, and Livingstone ensured that 3,000 to 5,000 workers were available throughout its five or six month growing season by exploiting the obligations of the labour tenancy system called thangata. This word originally meant help, such as one neighbour might give another, but it came to mean the work that a tenant on a European-owned estate had to undertake in lieu of rent. Tenants were also required to undertake additional work {{on account of the}} Hut tax which the owner paid on behalf of tenants. Other men worked for wages: they were often unpaid, underpaid or given tobacco instead of cash, and violently coerced by the owners. Although William Jervis Livingstone pioneered the thangata system at Magomero from 1906, once Alexander Livingstone Bruce came to live in Nyasaland in 1908 and control of the estate operations, he instructed Livingstone, his manager, to exploit thangata rigorously to maximise the amount of cotton grown. The A L Bruce Estates increased the <b>labour</b> <b>demand</b> to four or five months a year, mainly in the rainy season, which was also the main growing season for both cotton and food crops, leaving tenants little time to grow their food. Single women tenants and widows were now also required to work.|$|E
60|$|The post used to {{come into}} Nuncombe Putney at about eight in the morning, carried thither by a wooden-legged man who rode a donkey. There is a general {{understanding}} that the wooden-legged men in country parishes should be employed as postmen, owing to the great steadiness of demeanour which a wooden leg is generally found to produce. It may be that such men are slower in their operations than would be biped postmen; but as all private employers of <b>labour</b> <b>demand</b> labourers with two legs, it is well that the lame and halt should find a refuge in the less exacting service of the government. The one-legged man who rode his donkey into Nuncombe Putney would reach his post-office not above half an hour after his proper time; {{but he was very}} slow in stumping round the village, and seldom reached the Clock House much before ten. On a certain morning two or three days after the conversation just recorded it was past ten when he brought two letters to the door, one for Mrs. Trevelyan, and one for Mrs. Stanbury. The ladies had finished their breakfast, and were seated together at an open window. As was usual, the letters were given into Priscilla's hands, and the newspaper which accompanied them into those of Mrs. Trevelyan, its undoubted owner. When her letter was handed to her, she looked at the address closely and then walked away with it into her own room.|$|E
6000|$|Such {{conditions}} gradually {{brought about}} a profound discontent, a grouping of classes. Among the comparatively prosperous there was set up a social competition in luxury that was the bane of large and small communities. Skilled labour banded itself into unions, employers organized to oppose them, {{and the result was}} a class conflict never contemplated by the founders of the Republic, repugnant to democracy which by its very nature depends for its existence on the elimination of classes. In addition to this, owing to the unprecedented immigration of ignorant Europeans to supply the <b>labour</b> <b>demand,</b> we acquired a sinister proletariat of unskilled economic slaves. Before the war labour discovered its strength; since the war began, especially in the allied nations with quasi-democratic institutions, it is aware of its power to exert a leverage capable of paralyzing industry for a period sufficient to destroy the chances of victory. The probability of the occurrence of such a calamity depends wholly on whether or not the workman can be convinced that it is his war, for he will not exert himself to perpetuate a social order in which he has lost faith, even though he now obtains a considerable increase in wages. Agreements entered into with the government by union leaders will not hold him if at any time he fails to be satisfied that the present world conflict will not result in a greater social justice. This fact has been demonstrated by {{what is known as the}} [...] "shop steward" [...] movement in England, where the workers repudiated the leaders' agreements and everywhere organized local strikes. And in America, the unskilled workers are largely outside of the unions.|$|E

30|$|In this category, {{the sex of}} the {{household}} head was significant only in Kenya and in the pooled sample. Having more years of education was significantly and negatively associated with adoption of MTM in the Kenyan sample. Farmers who had paid employment were less likely to have adopted MTM (coefficient negative for all samples and significant for the Ethiopian sample). Similarly, those who had non-farm self-employment were less likely to have MTM on their plots (Kenyan sample) but more likely in the Tanzanian sample. The negative correlation with access to non-farm income may suggest higher opportunity costs for these households, thereby limiting {{the extent to which they}} will commit to working on their own farms and suggesting perhaps that MTM may impose non-trivial <b>labour</b> <b>demands</b> (hence, the high opportunity cost implied here) unless on-farm productivity gains and incomes can offset these apparently higher <b>labour</b> <b>demands</b> from MTM.|$|R

30|$|Furthermore, pastoralists shared {{concerns}} about the difficulty of passing on herding knowledge and expertise to their children. Many herders who both resided on private ranches full time and kept livestock {{at home in the}} group ranches described situations where they had been unable to advise their families where and when to graze livestock during recent droughts. They felt that they were unable to impart decades of experience in the region to their children or other members of their household now taking on the responsibilities of herding. Others who recognized this or whose households could not meet <b>labour</b> <b>demands</b> sold most or all of their livestock, instead relying entirely on income from professional herding. Due to increased <b>labour</b> <b>demands</b> in two spaces, families in Laikipia often had to choose between employment in private ranches or continuing to keep livestock in the group ranches. These transitions are increasingly common for pastoralists migrating for wage work in East Africa (McCabe et al. 2014).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{combines}} labour {{history and}} labour geography through {{an analysis of}} the making of <b>labour</b> <b>demands</b> in Glasgow during the early twentieth century. The paper asserts how revisiting histories such as Red Clydeside reveals complexities within labour movements and links to more recent debates within labour geography. Archival research provides a relational account of the place-based politics of Glasgow that emerged during the forty hours movement in 1919. This allows the paper to juxtapose the broader international linkages forged by Scottish workers alongside racialised hostilities within the city. In particular, the paper compares and contrasts the progressive internationalism of the strike newspaper with the Broomielaw race riot between local and foreign sailors during the same month as the strike. This comparison also raises the longer-term trajectories of labour grievances to foreground the ambivalent and contested nature of <b>labour</b> <b>demands,</b> identities and histories. In particular, the paper pays close attention to contrasting practices of labour internationalism emerging from the relevant archives. This historical approach makes a broader contribution to debates within labour geography by engaging with the complexities and tensions of <b>labour</b> organising and <b>demand</b> making...|$|R
