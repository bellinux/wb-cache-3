Also, since SIPs work as framing, insulation, and exterior sheathing, and can come precut {{from the factory}} for the specific job, the exterior building envelope can be built quite quickly.

The environmental performance of SIPs, moreover, is very good due to their exceptional thermal insulation. They also offer a resistance to damp and cold problems like compression shrinkage and cold bridging that cannot be matched by timber and more traditional building materials.|$|E
50|$|Another design {{technique}} to prevent failures is called physics of failure. This technique relies on understanding the physical static and dynamic failure mechanisms. It accounts for variation in <b>load,</b> <b>strength,</b> and stress {{that lead to}} failure {{with a high level}} of detail, made possible with the use of modern finite element method (FEM) software programs that can handle complex geometries and mechanisms such as creep, stress relaxation, fatigue, and probabilistic design (Monte Carlo simulations/DOE). The material or component can be re-designed to reduce the probability of failure and to make it more robust against such variations. Another common design technique is component derating: i.e. selecting components whose specifications significantly exceed the expected stress levels, such as using heavier gauge electrical wire than might normally be specified for the expected electric current.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Factors {{affecting}} {{the shape of}} failure rate curve are analyzed, and four elements including <b>load,</b> <b>strength,</b> degradation and lifetime index (namely, the number of load application and time) are proposed for calculating the failure rate of components. Taking the number of load application and time as the life index, respectively, the failure rate models of components consisting of four elements is developed, which can embody the effect of parameters of <b>load,</b> <b>strength,</b> degradation and life. Then, the rules that the reliability and failure rate changes as life index are studied. The result shows that the failure rate curves are partially or whole bathtub-shaped. For different parameters of <b>load,</b> <b>strength</b> and strength degradation, the curves of reliability and failure rate of components changing with time present different shapes. The models derived in this paper can calculate the failure rate of components {{as long as the}} parameters of <b>load,</b> <b>strength</b> and degradation and life index are known...|$|E

40|$|The {{advantages}} {{and limitations of}} point load test have been extensively discussed in literature. Although, the point <b>load</b> <b>strength</b> can {{be representative of the}} uniaxial strength of isotropic rocks, it can be misleading in the case of anisotropic rocks due to the presence of foliation or bedding planes. The foliated nature of most metamorphic rocks suggests a directional variation in their point <b>load</b> <b>strength.</b> The paper describes results from tests performed on anisotropic rocks, according to the suggested method by ISRM but also using alternative loading directions in the diametral test. The strength anisotropy index Ia(50) was determined for these rocks and has been compared to the degree of strength anisotropy as measured in specimens tested under uniaxial compression. Finally, a new anisotropy index is proposed and suggestions are made in using point load test for the classification of rock strength anisotropy. © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} tensile stress {{distribution}} within a solid circular cylinder of diameter D and length IL subjected to double diametral indenture or diametral point <b>load</b> <b>strength</b> test (PLST). The contact problem between the indentors and the cylinder is solved analytically, and exact solution for stress distribution is obtained {{through the use}} of displacement functions and double Fourier expansion in 6 - and zcoordinates. Numerical results show that the tensile stress {{at the center of the}} cylinders, in general, decreases with Poisson's ratio v and increases with 2 L/D for 2 L/D 1. This prediction agrees exactly with the shape effect observed experimentally for the PLST for marbles, granite, and tuff found in Hong Kong and with previous published results for other rocks. The magnitude of tensile stress at the center is about three times the prediction obtained by using Wijk's formula, but seems more comparable with experimental results.

Although it is widely known, {{the reliability of the}} result is still doubtable for some reason as well as due to an engineer’s ignorant, which insist on using conventional method rather than new advanced method causing the lack of usage in geophysical method for testing. This study aims to produce a correlation between P-wave velocity value and point <b>load</b> <b>strength</b> index value for shale. Both field and laboratory tests were carried out. In order to obtain the P-wave value, seismic refraction method was conducted as a field test at Precint 4, Putrajaya, Malaysia to achieve the Pwave velocity value of the shale bed. Ten samples of shale were collected from the field and laboratory tests were conducted. The tests are divided into three sections, namely non-destructive laboratory test, physical properties test and mechanical properties test. Ultrasonic Velocity Test via PUNDIT test was conducted as non-destructive laboratory test to acknowledge the P-wave velocity value in laboratory. Both field and laboratory P-wave velocity value were then compared and the result delivers are reliable due to it is within the range. For physical properties test, the rock density and porosity were acknowledged. Meanwhile, Point Load Test was conducted as mechanical properties. Correlation for both Pwave velocity value and point <b>load</b> <b>strength</b> value were achieved via producing an empirical relationship as the end result. Prediction of uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) value was made via converting the point <b>load</b> <b>strength</b> value to UCS value using a correlation.
