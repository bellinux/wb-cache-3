50|$|In aeronautics, a spoiler (sometimes {{called a}} lift spoiler or <b>lift</b> <b>dumper)</b> is a device {{intended}} to intentionally reduce the lift component of an airfoil {{in a controlled}} way. Most often, spoilers are plates on the top surface of a wing that can be extended upward into the airflow to spoil it. By so doing, the spoiler creates a controlled stall over {{the portion of the}} wing behind it, greatly reducing the lift of that wing section. Spoilers differ from airbrakes in that airbrakes are designed to increase drag without affecting lift, while spoilers reduce lift as well as increasing drag.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lift</b> <b>dumpers</b> {{are almost}} always {{deployed}} automatically on touch down. The flight deck control has three positions: off, automatic ('armed'), and manual (rarely used). On landing approach 'automatic' is selected and, {{at the moment of}} touchdown, <b>lift</b> <b>dumpers</b> are deployed in a fraction of a second, with flight control spoilers also being raised automatically as additional <b>lift</b> <b>dumpers.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Lift</b> <b>dumpers</b> are {{a special}} type of spoiler {{extending}} along {{much of the}} wing's length and designed to dump as much lift as possible on landing. <b>Lift</b> <b>dumpers</b> have only two positions, deployed and retracted. <b>Lift</b> <b>dumpers</b> have three main functions: putting most {{of the weight of}} the aircraft on the wheels for maximum braking effect, increasing form drag, and preventing aircraft 'bounce' on landing.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{accidents}} {{have been caused}} either by inadvertently deploying <b>lift</b> <b>dumpers</b> on landing approach, or forgetting to set them to 'automatic'.|$|R
50|$|Virtually {{all modern}} jet {{aircraft}} are fitted with <b>lift</b> <b>dumpers.</b> The British Aerospace 146 is fitted with particularly wide span spoilers to generate additional drag and make reverse thrust unnecessary.|$|R
50|$|Loftleiðir Icelandic Airlines Flight 509 - Deployment of <b>lift</b> <b>dumpers</b> while {{attempting}} to arm them 40 feet above the runway caused this accident at John F Kennedy International Airport on 23 June 1973.|$|R
50|$|Airbus {{aircraft}} with fly-by-wire control utilise wide-span spoilers for descent control, spoilerons, gust alleviation, and <b>lift</b> <b>dumpers.</b> Especially on landing approach, {{the full}} width of spoilers {{can be seen}} controlling the aircraft's descent rate and bank.|$|R
50|$|One jet {{airliner}} {{not fitted}} with lift spoilers was the Douglas DC-8 which used reverse thrust in flight {{on the two}} inboard engines to control descent speed (however the aircraft was fitted with <b>lift</b> <b>dumpers).</b> The Lockheed Tristar was fitted with a system called Direct Lift Control using the spoilers on landing approach to control descent.|$|R
50|$|The Il-62 is a {{conventional}} all-metal low-wing monoplane of riveted sectional semi-monocoque construction to fail-safe design principles (a structure {{designed so that}} failure of one major member does not cause immediate failure of the whole). Its service life was initially set at 30,000 flight hours and subject to extensions and curtailments according {{to the quality of}} service procedures, inspection and manufacturer's bulletins. The aircraft features pressurised cabin and freight holds (with fuselage dimensions of 3.8 m width x 4.1 m height), duplex all-mechanical flight controls, though with twin electric motors for tailplane incidence control; hydraulic nosewheel steering, landing gear and tail strut actuation, and wheel brakes. The Il-62M has spoilers and <b>lift</b> <b>dumpers</b> which extend automatically upon landing and are hydraulically operated. Control surfaces include a variable-incidence tailplane with dynamically and weight-compensated elevators with trim tabs, triple-section tabbed ailerons (outermost for low speed and innermost for high speed) which are interlinked with a torsion bar, spoilerons (Il-62M), spoilers and <b>lift</b> <b>dumpers,</b> and pneumatically actuated thrust reversers on the two outboard engines (the reversers are flight-rated on the Il-62M).|$|R
50|$|Except {{for flight}} training, {{airplane}} testing, and aerobatics, a stall is usually an undesirable event. Spoilers (sometimes called <b>lift</b> <b>dumpers),</b> however, are devices that are intentionally deployed {{to create a}} carefully controlled flow separation over part of an aircraft's wing to reduce the lift it generates, increase the drag, and allow the aircraft to descend more rapidly without gaining speed. Spoilers are also deployed asymmetrically (one wing only) to enhance roll control. Spoilers {{can also be used}} on aborted take-offs and after main wheel contact on landing to increase the aircraft's weight on its wheels for better braking action.|$|R
50|$|Dautel is a German company, {{headquartered}} in Leingarten, manufacturing hydraulic tail <b>lifts</b> and <b>dumpers</b> for trucks. It {{is one of}} the several German companies returning production back to Germany, due to quality concerns.|$|R
25|$|Cantilever three-spar {{structure}} of modified trapezoid planform. Centre section integral with fuselage. Inboard sections, outboard sections and detachable leading and trailing edges. High-lift devices comprise full-span six-segment {{leading edge slats}} (contiguous at engine pylons) at up to 17.5% of chord (drooping to 35°), two-segment fixed-vane double-slotted trailing edge flaps occupying some 75% of the span (deploying to 40°) and five-segment spoilers (outboards used as spoilerons at high speeds, inboards used as <b>lift</b> <b>dumpers</b> on the ground). Two-segment outboard ailerons for low speed roll control. Boundary layer fences over pylons. Engines suspended from the wing on pylons act as anti-flutter weights. Trim range is 16–33% of mean aerodynamic chord.|$|R
50|$|BIOMAN is a Greek machine manufacturer, {{based in}} Koropi, near Athens. It {{was founded in}} 1967 by two {{mechanical}} engineers and has focused on design and construction {{of a wide variety}} of lifting devices/material handling equipment (hydraulic and electric, platforms, <b>lifts,</b> forklifts, <b>dumpers</b> etc.). Its early products included the Tiger family of vehicles, consisting of light and heavy dumpers and forklifts (no longer produced).|$|R
40|$|This senior project {{discusses}} the design, construction, {{and evaluation of}} a portable RPC (Reusable Plastic Container) dumper. This RPC dumper is one piece of a citrus processing system to package citrus. Bee Sweet currently utilizes man power in order to dump its RPCs whereas this design will decrease the amount of man power needed to dump RPCs during high workloads. The goal of this project was to design, construct, and test a custom fabricated RPC dumper that will decrease {{the number of people}} needed to dump RPCs and also the amount of damage on the oranges when being dumped from the RPC by hand. The finished RPC dumper functions well, it dumps 4 RPCs per minute and is portable in that it can be moved by both pallet jack and fork <b>lift.</b> The RPC <b>dumper</b> also functions well in that it reduces the velocity change that the fruit sees by 80 % and also decreases the impact duration by 38 %...|$|R
