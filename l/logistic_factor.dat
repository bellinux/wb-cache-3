Based on identifiable data, it focuses on the analysis of chosen factors from logistics. The thesis makes full use of available information. Golem Company has been chosen {{for the analysis of}} a transportation system. It is a company with a well-built hinterland and specializes primarily in transportation of goods using road freight service. The solved factor is the analysis of variants for foreign trips. It describes the way drivers are used to their full capacity, possible saving of time, the AETR contract.

40|$|A {{significant}} <b>logistic</b> <b>factor</b> as to {{the successful}} clinical application of the autologous tissue engineering concept is efficient transportation: the donor cells need to be delivered to tissue processing facilities which in most cases requires air transportation. This {{study was designed to}} evaluate how human chondrocytes react to X-ray exposure. Primary cell cultures were established, cultured, incubated and exposed to different doses and time periods of radiation. Subsequently, quantitative cell proliferation assays were done and qualitative evaluation of cellular protein production were performed. Our results show that after irradiation of chondrocytes with different doses, no significant differences in terms of cellular viability occurred compared with the control group. These results were obtained when chondrocytes were exposed to luggage transillumination doses as well as exposure to clinically used radiation doses. Any damage affecting cell growth or quality was not observed in our study. However, information about damage of cellular DNA remains incomplete...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} of the {{influences}} affecting general practitioners' decisions {{whether or not to}} prescribe, 69 principals and five trainees in general practice were asked about the factors that made these decisions difficult for them and the circumstances in which the decision caused them to feel uncomfortable. Discomfort was reported most frequently in prescribing for respiratory disease, psychiatric conditions and skin problems, though the range of problems mentioned was wide. The range of drugs for which the decision of whether or not to prescribe was difficult was also wide but psychotropic drugs, antibiotics, drugs acting on the cardiovascular system and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were most often mentioned. Patient factors said to be important included age, ethnicity, social class and education, the doctor's prior knowledge of the patient, the doctor's feeling towards the patient, communication problems, and the doctor's desire to try to preserve the doctor-patient relationship. Doctor specific factors included concerns about drugs, factors relating to doctors' role perception and expectations of themselves, uncertainty, peer influences, <b>logistic</b> <b>factors,</b> and the experience of medical or therapeutic misadventures. The results of this study support earlier work on the influence of social factors on prescribing decisions and show that this influence affects the entire range of clinical problems. The results also reveal the importance of <b>logistic</b> <b>factors.</b> The overriding concern of doctors to preserve the doctor-patient relationship and the range of attitudes, perceptions and experiences of doctors that have a bearing on the decision to prescribe begin to explain the apparent irrationality of some general practitioner prescribing.

40|$|Background and objectives. There {{is now a}} {{wide variety}} of methods {{available}} to general practitioners who want to engage in quality assessment, quality assurance, or quality improvement activities in their practices. These methods require some kind of performance review, or at least the collection of some performance-related data. As in traditional research, the choice of methods depends on what research questions one wants to address. This paper elaborates on some key concepts related to the choice of methods, making a distinction between whether any method actually covers performance (what a doctor does in daily practice) or competence (what a doctor is capable of doing) as well as a distinction between whether a method is direct (patient-doctor contact is observable) or is indirect. Methods. An overview frame will be presented of the methods most commonly used for data collection within quality assessment. These methods are discussed on their validity, reliability, feasibility and acceptability. Direct methods aimed at recording performance are assumed to hold the highest validity, but practical, economic and <b>logistic</b> <b>factors</b> may favour less ambitious methods for audit or quality improvement activities.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Successful {{cervical}} cancer screening in the United States-Affiliated Pacific Islands (USAPI) {{is limited by}} geographic, political, economic, and <b>logistic</b> <b>factors.</b> An expert panel convened to examine screening {{in each of the}} 6 island jurisdictions and to explore options beyond cytology-based screening. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-one representatives of American Congress of Obstetrics and Gynecology, American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology, government agencies, the World Health Organization, Pan American Health Organization, health representatives of the 6 Pacific island jurisdictions, Puerto Rico, and several academic institutions met in a 2 -day meeting to explore options to improve access and coverage of {{cervical cancer}} screening in the USAPI. RESULTS: Cytology-based screening is less widely accessed and less successful in the USAPI than in the United States in general. Barriers include geographic isolation, cultural factors, and lack of resources. Cytology-based screening requires multiple visits to complete the process from screening to treatment. Screen-and-treat regimens based on visual inspection with acetic acid or human papillomavirus requiring 1 or 2 visits have the potential to improve cervical cancer prevention in the USAPI. CONCLUSIONS: The standard US algorithm of cytology screening followed by colposcopy and treatment is less effective in geographically and culturally isolated regions such as the USAPI.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors {{describe}} {{their experience with}} left ventricular assist-device (LVAD) recipients undergoing noncardiac surgery and delineate surgical, anesthetic, and <b>logistic</b> <b>factors</b> important in the successful intraoperative management of these patients. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Left ventricular assist-devices {{have become part of}} the armamentarium in the treatment of end-stage heart failure. As the numbers of patients chronically supported with long-term implantable devices grows, general surgical problems that are commonly seen in other hospitalized patients are becoming manifest. Of particular interest is the intraoperative management of patients undergoing elective noncardiac surgical procedures. METHODS: The anesthesia records and clinical charts were reviewed for eight ventricular assist-device recipients undergoing general surgical procedures between August 1, 1990 and August 31, 1994. RESULTS: A total of 12 procedures were performed in 6 men and 2 women averaging 52. 7 years of age. Mean time elapsed from device implantation to operation was 68 +/- 35 days. Conventional inhalational and intravenous anesthetic techniques were well tolerated in these patients undergoing diverse surgical procedures. No perioperative mortality was observed. Five of eight patients went on to successful cardiac transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Hemodynamic recovery after LVAD insertion has defined a new group of patients who develop noncardiac surgical problems often seen in other critically ill patients. Recognition of the unique potential problems that the LVAD recipient may encounter in the perioperative period [...] in particular patient positioning, device limitations, and fluid and inotropic management [...] will ensure an optimal surgical outcome for LVAD recipients undergoing noncardiac surgery...|$|R

40|$|During air-attack {{operations}}, i. e., air-to-air and land-air {{operations in}} battles, maintaining {{a high level}} of availability of weapon systems (aircraft and weapons) becomes important {{from the point of view}} of winning the battle. Availability may depend on severity of combat operations, attrition factors (battle damage failures and reliability related failures), and logistic delays in weapons deployment and in the repair process. In this paper, a simulation model is developed for availability of weapon systems considering air-to-air and land-air combat operations, multiple failures causing aircraft failure and logistic delays in weapons deployment, and in the repair process. The availability of aircraft and the availability of weapons are separately derived from simulation and the product of them is denoted as combined availability for analysis. The results are analyzed in terms of fluctuations in availability on specified days of battle such as 1, 7, 14, and 21 days from the graphical output. The simulation procedure employs discrete event simulation technique using Monte Carlo methods. The time to failure distribution and the time to repair distribution for the major subsystems of the aircraft and helicopters is considered to be Weibull and exponential respectively. The logistic delay time distribution for weapons replenishment and for <b>logistic</b> <b>factors,</b> spares, crew, and equipment, is considered to be lognormal. Assuming a certain range of values for air-attack missions and for the number of sorties to be generated and a set of reliability and maintainability parameters for the considered major subsystems of the aircraft, the simulation for availability is analyzed.

In {{the first part of the}} paper, the factors affecting the positioning of the CODP (internal and external to the company) and their characteristics are identified. Based on extensive literature research, these factors are then mapped to manufacturing concepts, such as make-to-stock, assemble-to-order, and make-to-order. The factors that lead to moving the CODP are also identified and used as the foundation for the development of an iterative procedural method with four stages. In stage 1, the as-is state and current goals are captured and suitable CODPs are identified for the above-mentioned <b>logistic</b> <b>factors.</b> In stage 2, the products are combined into groups to reduce the complexity of the analysis and a procedure for accomplishing this is proposed. The number of suitable CODPs is reduced in stage 3 and the factors that influence the positioning of CODPs are taken into consideration. In stage 4, a financial and qualitative evaluation is performed on the various CODPs...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} was to test {{the psychometric properties of}} an Italian version of the Severity of Dependence Scale, a five-item measure designed to assess the compulsive dimension of drug dependence. 635 smokers enrolled in a tobacco dependence treatment program served as the participants. The Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence was used as a comparative measure. Dimensionality of the Severity of Dependence Scale and the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence was assessed by factor analysis. Prediction of smoking at one year was evaluated by <b>logistic</b> regression. <b>Factor</b> analysis yielded a two-factor solution; however, the second factor explained very little variance. Factor 1 had a Cronbach's alpha of. 66 (overall Scale coefficient =. 44). The total Severity of Dependence Score predicted smoking at one year (OR = 1. 10) ...|$|R
