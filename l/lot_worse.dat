25|$|In {{the next}} 2009–10 season, he again had to {{battle with a}} couple of injuries. But during the season he was still able to play another 28 games for Feyenoord, where he scored a total of 12 goals, and thereby {{qualified}} to become the top scorer of Feyenoord. With his good performance on the field, he helped Feyenoord to achieve a fourth place in the Eredivisie, and qualify the club to play the final in the Dutch cup. The final was played as a double match, and clearly lost with a total score of 6–1 to Ajax, but Tomasson left a mark of his name in the history books, by scoring the one and only goal for Feyenoord. During the World Championships 2010, he was unfortunately hit by another serious injury, that spoiled his first half of the 2010–11 season for Feyenoord. According to the medical staff at Feyenoord, the injury was a <b>lot</b> <b>worse</b> than original thought. When they tried to get him ready for a game at 15 August, the injury had not entirely healed; and after a too hard training session, it therefore reappeared at its previous strength. Based upon further examination of the injury, the coach now feared that Tomasson only would be ready to play his first game of the season in January 2011.|$|E

[...] Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film two out of four stars, saying [...] "With its predecessor having made a whopping $540 million globally, it's no wonder that Universal saw fit to order a sequel. But it's not enough just to trot out legions of minions and cobble together a plot. Audiences deserve more imagination and inventiveness than this wan recycling." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a 'C' grade, saying [...] "By the end, every child in the audience will want his or her own monster-minion toy.

60|$|And all {{the time}} the dog ran with him, at his heels. When he fell down a second time, it curled its tail over its forefeet and {{sat in front of}} him facing him curiously eager and intent. The warmth and {{security}} of the animal angered him, and he cursed it till it flattened down its ears appeasingly. This time the shivering came more quickly upon the man. He was losing in his battle with the frost. It was creeping into his body from all sides. The thought of it drove him on, but he ran no more than a hundred feet, when he staggered and pitched headlong. It was his last panic. When he had recovered his breath and control, he sat up and entertained in his mind the conception of meeting death with dignity. However, the conception did not come to him in such terms. His idea of it was that he had been making a fool of himself, running around like a chicken with its head cut off—such was the simile that occurred to him. Well, he was bound to freeze anyway, and he might as well take it decently. With this new-found peace of mind came the first glimmerings of drowsiness. A good idea, he thought, to sleep off to death. It was like taking an anæsthetic. Freezing was not so bad as people thought. There were <b>lots</b> <b>worse</b> ways to die.|$|R

2500|$|The {{end of the}} war and {{emancipation}} brought both jubilation and anxiety, many {{not knowing}} how to restructure their lives. At emancipation some slaveowners reacted by evicting all former slaves from their properties, others negotiated work contracts or sharecropping arrangements. Since few of these agreements were legally contracted, and the newly freed slaves had little access to the legal system, they were often victimized. Former Kanawha County slave Lizzie Grant explained- [...] "Slavery had not ended, no we just went from slaves to peons...They did free them in one sense of the word, but put them in a whole <b>lot</b> <b>worse</b> shape as they turned them loose to make their own way with nothing to make it with...e mostly had to stay with our [...] if we got anything...e were forced to stay on as servants, yes, if we expected to live...hey still made us do just like they wanted to after the war." ...|$|E

Very few of them are educated and officers are scarce. Kudumbi women do not wear a blouse but wrap the sari, sarong wise about them. In 1936, an association of young Kudumbis was established in Cochin and later in Travancore. In 1951, the two associations merged into one. Yet they have not achieved their rightful place in society.

40|$|Post-modernity {{would seem}} to bode ill for {{immigrant}} communities in the European Union. Prominent theories of postmodern society, when analyzed in respect {{to the status of}} immigrants, pit several strikes against them. Taking as a given that the EU deserves the label "postmodern society," this essay discusses three such theories and draws out the implications of each for immigrants, particularly in Germany. The findings are anything but merry. If the theories prove true, immigrants should expect little or no improvement in their <b>lot</b> and, <b>worse,</b> deterioration. This said, I refuse to conclude the essay on a note of pure pessimism. Although I dismiss the likely success of planned, deliberate resistance to worsening conditions for immigrants, I point to unplanned spontaneous resistance which can be successful if not predictable...|$|R
40|$|If {{property}} rights are not assigned over individual goods such as parking spaces, com-petition for them can eat {{up the entire}} surplus. We find that when drivers are homo-geneous, there is a discontinuity in social welfare between “enough ” and “not enough. ” Building slightly too small a parking <b>lot</b> is <b>worse</b> than building much too small a park-ing lot, since both have zero net benefit and larger lots cost more to build. More generally, the welfare losses from undercapacity and overcapacity are asymmetric, and parking lots should be “overbuilt. ” That is, the optimal parking lot size can be well in excess of mean demand. Uncertainty over the number of drivers, which is detrimental in the first-best, actually increases social welfare if the parking lot size is too small...|$|R
