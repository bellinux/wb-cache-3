25|$|Maintenance of {{adequate}} tire inflation {{is the most}} frequent and troublesome concern for cyclists and many means and methods are employed to preserve pneumatic integrity. Thicker tires, thicker tubes, tire liners (of a number of rather impenetrable devices installed between the tire and tube), <b>liquid</b> <b>sealing</b> <b>compounds</b> squeezed into the tube, and automotive-style patch kits are all used to reliably contain the typical tire pressures of 40 to 60 {{pounds per square inch}} that are required for bicycle operation. Thin, light bicycle tires are particularly vulnerable to penetration and subsequent deflation caused by goat's heads and other burs, colloquially known as stickers. Inflation of bicycle tires to pressures higher than typical for automotive use requires special pumps. The complexity of bicycle tire maintenance and repair may cause many to not consider the bicycle for transport or leisure.|$|R

Accurate prediction {{of the flow}} field is fundamental in producing robust and efficient designs. To validate {{the capabilities of the}} computational fluid dynamics FLUENT for incompressible fluid seal flow, comparisons of velocity parameters are made to the published experimental results and other CFD code for a circumferential grooved <b>liquid</b> <b>seal.</b> This work employs a pressure-based CFD code FLUENT to calculate the flow field in the seal, using four different turbulence models respectively.

40|$|<b>Liquid</b> <b>sealing</b> is an {{effective}} method to convert a fiber-optic refractometer into a simple and highly sensitive temperature sensor. A refractometer based on the thin-core fiber modal interferometer is sealed in a capillary tube filled with Cargille oil.

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of a cooperation project, ceramic components of alumina, Al 2 O 3, were sealed in a gastight manner for chemical applications using a <b>sealing</b> <b>compound</b> based on ceramic raw materials. The sealing is adapted to the Al 2 O 3 ceramic with respect to expansion coefficient and wettability and it is inert, mechanically stable, chemically resistant and above all gastight at application temperatures of approx. 1000 degreesC. This was achieved with high reproducibility by a composition in the SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 - CaO-K 2 O quaternary system. The ceramic <b>sealing</b> <b>compound</b> is selectively crystallized by adequate temperature control and shows then the required high temperature resistance. The strengths achieved are sufficient for the planned application as a sealing material for a ceramic microreactor. The temperature cycling resistance and the thermal shock resistance are also adapted to Al 2 O 3. Additional tests of commercial glass sealants were carried out to evaluate the results obtained.
