40|$|A multi-disciplinary {{study of}} {{sediment}} core {{records from the}} Mingulay Reef Complex, a cold-water coral reefs system off western Scotland, highlights the potential of cold-water corals from which detailed centennial-scale palaeo-environmental reconstructions can be derived. This study provides a new insight on the mechanisms controlling <b>Lophelia</b> <b>pertusa</b> <b>reef</b> build-up, shifts in biodiversity, the physical/chemical/biological processes and the sedimentary regime. A detailed record of Mingulay Complex growth history shows unprecedented high average accumulation rates of 3 – 4 mm a- 1. Marine radiocarbon reconstruction derived from paired 14 C and U-series dated fossil corals revealed substantial abrupt oceanic shifts during the Holocene that have repetitively affected cold-water coral growth, eventually causing local disappearance. These periods of reduced accumulation rates are synchronous with other coral structures from the NE Atlantic illustrating basin wide events. Finally, trace/minor element ratios reproducibility within coral skeleton was investigated to test if palaeo-environmental reconstructions could be made from cold-water corals...|$|E
40|$|Deep-water {{coral reefs}} are {{seafloor}} environments with diverse biological communities surrounded by cold permanent darkness. Sources {{of energy and}} carbon for the nourishment of these reefs are presently unclear. We investigated {{one aspect of the}} food web using DNA stable-isotope probing (DNA-SIP). Sediment from beneath a <b>Lophelia</b> <b>pertusa</b> <b>reef</b> off the coast of Norway was incubated until assimilation of 5 µmol 13 CH 4 g- 1 wet weight occurred. Extracted DNA was separated into ‘light’ and ‘heavy’ fractions for analysis of labelling. Bacterial community fingerprinting of PCR-amplified 16 S rRNA gene fragments revealed two predominant 13 C-specific bands. Sequencing of these bands indicated that carbon from 13 CH 4 had been assimilated by a Methylomicrobium and an uncultivated member of the Gammaproteobacteria. Cloning and sequencing of 16 S rRNA genes from the heavy DNA, in addition to genes encoding particulate methane monooxygenase and methanol dehydrogenase, all linked Methylomicrobium with methane metabolism. Putative cross-feeders were affiliated with Methylophaga (Gammaproteobacteria), Hyphomicrobium (Alphaproteobacteria) and previously unrecognized methylotrophs of the Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Deferribacteres and Bacteroidetes.

40|$|The Tautra sill is one {{of three}} sill {{dividing}} Norway s third largest fjord, the Trondheimsfjord. Knowledge of cold-water corals in the fjord has been known for centuries and has been a popular object of interest in regards to research. As anthropogenic impact on the oceans world-wide is increasing, an urgent need to gain knowledge about the many habitats is a necessity. The three-dimensional reef structures formed by the cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa are considered a biodiversity hotspot and important for many commercial fish stocks. By combining non-invasive technology in the form of video and multibeam echo sounder, mounted on a remotely operated vehicle, to map the seabed and the cold-water corals in the Trondheimsfjord, new biological information was gathered. Two surveys were performed, at the Tautra sill and at Hoøyskjæret in the Beitstadfjord. The surveys aimed to gain knowledge about the <b>Lophelia</b> <b>pertusa</b> <b>reef</b> as a habitat and to map cold-water coral occurrence in relation to topography and biodiversity. To illustrate how biodiversity may change along a 1 km long transect, a spatial resolution of 2 m was analysed for megafauna taxa diversity. High correlations between sponge occurrences and Lopehlia pertusa were found, as well as higher biodiversity located around the reefs. The combination of the two non-invasive mapping techniques was used to further suggest areas of interest for future inspection and management...|$|E

40|$|The {{metazoan}} meiofauna {{associated with}} <b>Lophelia</b> <b>pertusa</b> <b>reef</b> degradation zones in the Belgica mound province (Porcupine Seabight, North-East Atlantic) was {{studied in the}} framework of the Atlantic Coral Ecosystem Study (ACES; EC Fifth Framework Research Program). Attention was focused on the influence of and differences between different microhabitat types: dead coral fragments, glass sponge skeletons and the underlying sediment. This study demonstrates the importance of dead Lophelia pertusa framework and associated substrates for meiofauna along the European continental margins. The presence of these large biogenic structures on the sea floor of the continental margin (1) enables more taxa to be present and (2) particularly favors harpacticoid copepods, naupliar larvae and polychaetes. The meio-epifaunal community on these substrates significantly differs from the meio-infaunal community in the underlying sediment. This is mainly due to a much lower dominance of nematodes and a higher relative abundance of most other taxa, especially harpacticoids, naupliar larvae and polychaetes, in the latter habitat. This situation is comparable to that of epiphytic assemblages. Dominance of nematodes is low. The meio-infaunal assemblage in the underlying sediment is characterized by low densities. There are clear indications that cold-water coral degradation zones are biologically very diverse, in terms of species richness as well as equitability. Of all microhabitat types, coral fragments support the most diverse communities, whereas the underlying sediment is the least diverse...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge of {{the spatial}} {{distribution}} of species and habitats is crucial for effective management of marine resources. Data to support informed decision-making in the deep sea are often sparse or absent, as offshore sampling surveys are expensive, time-consuming, have limited coverage and are spatially biased. Habitat suitability models (HSMs) {{make use of the}} limited data available and are being applied increasingly to create continuous coverage maps of the potential distribution of species or habitats. Such maps have value as decision support tools for future survey planning, design of marine protected area networks and ultimately the implementation of marine spatial planning. In the deep sea, the quality of these maps is sub-optimal because of 1) the frequent lack of high-resolution ecologically relevant environmental variables, 2) species distribution data arising from opportunistic, spatially biased sampling, and 3) a lack of reliable species absence data. Therefore, this thesis has as its primary objective the development of repeatable and robust methods for deep-sea benthic HSM that take into account these issues. Based on the case study of predicting suitable habitat for the cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa (Linnaeus 1758) in the north-east Atlantic, this thesis extends existing benthic HSM methodologies by 1) maximising the resolution and information content of environmental variables, 2) optimising the reliability of presence-only modelling methods, 3) investigating the predictive power of high-resolution environmental variables derived from 3 D hydrodynamic models, 4) assessing the use of quantitative species occurrence proportion data for calibrating models, and 5) exploring the applicability of mixed models to account for spatially grouped transect data. The key outcome is the first reliable high-resolution HSM for <b>Lophelia</b> <b>pertusa</b> <b>reef</b> habitat as a tool for ecosystem-based management in Irish waters. The implications of HSMs for conservation, marine spatial planning and an understanding of ecosystem functioning and processes are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Internationally {{there is}} {{political}} momentum to establish networks of marine protected areas {{for the conservation}} of threatened species and habitats. Practical implementation of such networks requires an understanding of the distribution of these species and habitats. Predictive modelling provides a method by which continuous distribution maps can be produced from limited sample data. This method is particularly useful in the deep sea where a number of biological communities have been identified as vulnerable ‘habitats’, including <b>Lophelia</b> <b>pertusa</b> <b>reefs.</b> Recent modelling efforts have focused on predicting the distribution of this species. However the species is widely distributed where as reef habitat is not. This study uses Maxent predictive modelling to investigate whether the distribution of the species acts as a suitable proxy for the reef habitat.

40|$|The {{present data}} set {{was used as}} a {{training}} set for a Habitat Suitability Model. It contains occurrence (presence-only) of living <b>Lophelia</b> <b>pertusa</b> <b>reefs</b> in the Irish continental margin, which were assembled from databases, cruise reports and publications. A total of 4423 records were inspected and quality assessed to ensure that they (1) represented confirmed living L. <b>pertusa</b> <b>reefs</b> (so excluding 2900 records of dead and isolated coral colony records); (2) were derived from sampling equipment that allows for accurate (< 200 m) geo-referencing (so excluding 620 records derived mainly from trawling and dredging activities); and (3) were not duplicated. A total of 245 occurrences were retained for the analysis. Coral observations are highly clustered in regions targeted by research expeditions, which might lead to falsely inflated model evaluation measures (Veloz, 2009). Therefore, we coarsened the distribution data by deleting all but one record within grid cells of 0. 02 ° resolution (Davies & Guinotte 2011). The remaining 53 points were subject to a spatial cross-validation process: a random presence point was chosen, grouped with its 12 closest neighbour presence points based on Euclidean distance and withheld from model training. This process was repeated for all records, resulting in 53 replicates of spatially non-overlapping sets of test (n= 13) and training (n= 40) data.

40|$|Predictive habitat {{modelling}} {{is a tool}} {{which provides}} a means to assess the current and potential distribution of organisms by utilising environmental data, combined with the known presence of the species. It is therefore important that the resolution of environmental data used reflects the scale most relevant in determining the species distribution. This investigation assesses whether environmental data at a resolution of 750 m, 200 m or 30 m is best for modelling {{the distribution of the}} cold-water coral <b>Lophelia</b> <b>pertusa</b> (L. 1758) in north east Atlantic waters. Each of the three models was created using MaxEnt, utilising bathymetrical derived environmental data along with data on the known presence of <b>Lophelia</b> <b>pertusa</b> <b>reefs.</b> This allowed for a comparison between the three resolutions of model performance, the most important environmental parameters in the model formation, and the spatial output of the three models. The 30 m model used all three resolutions of environmental layer, allowing for a direct comparison of the contribution of the different resolution of layers to the model formation. The investigation found the lowest resolution model had a lower model performance, and a much larger area of predicted presence than the two higher resolution models. The 30 m and 200 m models displayed no significant difference in model performance or spatial output. This is due to the 30 m model relying on the 200 m layers in its calculation, with analysis of the contributing environmental layers showing that the 30 m environmental layers contributed very little to the model gain. This shows that an increase in terrain detail does not always make for a better fitting model, but that a resolution which displays the scale of environmental data most important in determining an organism’s distribution is more important...|$|R

In this study drilling was carried out in the Morvin drill field in proximity to a number of small <b>Lophelia</b> <b>pertusa</b> coral <b>reefs</b> (closest reefs 100 m upstream and 350 m downstream of point of waste drill material release). In a novel monitoring study, ROV video surveys of 9 reefs were conducted prior, during, immediately after and > 1 year after drilling operations. Behavior of coral polyps inhabiting reefs exposed to differing concentrations of drill cuttings and drilling fluids (waste drilling material) were compared. Levels of expected exposure to these waste materials were determined for each reef by modelling drill cutting transport following release, using accurate in-situ hydrodynamic data collected during the drilling period and drill cutting discharge data as parameters of a dispersal model. The presence / absence of associate reef species (Acesta excavata, Paragorgia arborea and Primnoa resedaeformis) were also determined from each survey video. There {{were no significant differences in}} <b>Lophelia</b> <b>pertusa</b> polyp behavior in corals modelled to have been exposed to pulses of > 25 ppm drill cutting material and those modelled to be exposed to negligible concentrations of material.

At the family level, the harpacticoid fauna in the Porcupine Seabight did not seem to differ markedly from other deep-sea areas, with essentially the same abundant families. However, the presence of typically epifaunal taxa indicates that the hard substrates of the coral degradation zone provide an exceptional habitat. Further, harpacticoid composition and diversity of sediment and coral fragments were compared with similar substrates in a tropical reef lagoon (Zanzibar, Tanzania).

Three species of Mediterranean cold water corals (<b>Lophelia</b> <b>pertusa,</b> Madrepora oculata and Desmophyllum sp) were exposed to ocean acidification conditions. Four separate pCO 2 levels were represented: 412 ± 73 ppm, 497 ± 117 ppm, 665 ± 100 ppm, and 866 ± 191 ppm. Coral response was measured using several methods of assessing growth: buoyant weight, colour (area) projection, new polyp development, and skeletal density. Response to ocean acidification was shown to be species specific with <b>Lophelia</b> <b>pertusa</b> being generally more affected (a reduction of over 40 % buoyant weight per day on higher pCO 2 compared to lowest pCO 2) than Madrepora oculata. Growth rate was not clearly influenced by ocean acidification in Desmophyllum sp.
