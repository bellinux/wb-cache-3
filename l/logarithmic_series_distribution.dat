40|$|The {{study of}} {{runs in a}} {{sequence}} of independent Bernoulli trials which is of great interest in Statistics and its applications, has led {{in recent years to}} the theory of distributions of order k. In the present work, proceeding the study of distributions of order k, we introduced and studied new univariate and multivariate distributions of order k, which generalize to distributions of order k, the known family of generalized distributions {{and at the same time}} extend several already known distributions of order k to generalized distributions, with the isertion of additional parameters. From the study of trials with two possible outcomes (success-failure), where the number of success runs of length k is required to be at least multiple of the total number of failures, by means of a first passage approach and by counting multi-dimensional lattice paths, we introduced and studied the generalized negative binomial distribution of order k, type I. This distribution includes five new distributions of the same order and type (Haight, Takacs, binomial-delta, negative binomial-delta, negative binomial-negative binomial) and asymptotically reduces to new Borel-Tanner, generalized Poisson and generalized <b>logarithmic</b> <b>series</b> <b>distributions</b> of the same order and type. By the same sampling scheme using additional replacement, we also derived and studied the generalized Polya distribution of order k, type I, which includes as special cases forteen univariate distributions of the same order. Relevant, multiparameter and of different type, distributions of order k, as well as their multivariate analogues, have also obtained and studied. Moments, limiting cases, properties of all the above distributions have also been considered and graphs are given. More over, we applied the above-mentioned models to observed data from Medicine, Biology-Genetics and Public Health, in order to illustrate that they fit properly.

In this paper {{we show that}} this model is a key model linking three models discussed in Takemura (1997), i. e., Poisson-gamma model (Bethlehem et al.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{estimating}} the individual probabilities of a discrete distribution is considered. The true {{distribution of the}} independent observations {{is a mixture of}} a family of power <b>series</b> <b>distributions.</b> First, we ensure identifiability of the mixing distribution assuming mild conditions. Next, the mixing distribution is estimated by non-parametric maximum likelihood and an estimator for individual probabilities is obtained from the corresponding marginal mixture density. We establish asymptotic normality for the estimator of individual probabilities by showing that, under certain conditions, the difference between this estimator and the empirical proportions is asymptotically negligible. Our framework includes Poisson, negative binomial and <b>logarithmic</b> <b>series</b> as well as binomial mixture models. Simulations highlight the benefit in achieving normality when using the proposed marginal mixture density approach instead of the empirical one, especially for small sample sizes and/or when interest is in the tail areas. A real data example is given to illustrate the use of the methodology. Copyright 2005 Board of the Foundation of the Scandinavian Journal of Statistics [...] ...|$|R
