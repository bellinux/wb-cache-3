500|$|Sue's {{parents were}} {{mentioned}} and their occupations as Nazi hunters {{revealed in the}} season one episode [...] "The Power of Madonna". According to Lynch, Sue's mother left her two daughters to pursue her career, and returns home retired after the last Nazi has been captured. On working with Burnett, Lynch said, [...] "I'm a <b>little</b> <b>nervous,</b> but I can't wait to get in scenes with her... It's like playing tennis with a master." [...] The origin behind Sue's antagonistic personality was explored in this episode; plans {{at the time were}} for Burnett to reappear on the series in a future episode. This is Burnett's and Lynch's second time working together, the first being the 2009 comedy film Post Grad.|$|E
500|$|On {{the quality}} of 3-D in film, Burke told Los Angeles Times, [...] "I think it's good, actually. I {{think people are going}} to be really pleased. I know everyone's a <b>little</b> <b>nervous</b> and sceptical of 3-D these days, but the work has been done very, very well. We've done over 200 shots in 3-D and in the visual effects as well, because so much of it is CG, so the results are very, very good. I think everyone's going to be really {{impressed}} with it, actually." [...] Producer David Heyman spoke to SFX magazine about the 3-D conversion, saying that [...] "The way David Yates is approaching 3-D is he's trying to approach it from a character and story point of view. Trying to use the sense of isolation, of separation that sometimes 3-D gives you, to heighten that at appropriate moments. So we're approaching it in a storytelling way." ...|$|E

500|$|Kinsler was {{promoted}} two levels on June 12 to the Double-A Frisco RoughRiders. [...] "When I first got called up, {{there were a}} million things running through my head", he said. [...] "I was nervous, my hands were sweating. It was really exciting, but I didn't know what to expect. I was a <b>little</b> <b>nervous</b> that ... {{all of a sudden}} I wouldn't be able to hit." [...] In June he was named the Rangers' Minor League Player of the Month. Frisco manager Tim Ireland observed: I think he's succeeding because his swing is graceful and effortless. It's just a smooth swing, and he hits for power because he lets his swing work for him. Defensively, so far he's shown a real feel for shortstop. He's got good feet and soft hands, and he throws well enough.... He seems pretty legit to me. In July, the Rangers agreed to send Kinsler and prospect right-hander Erik Thompson to the Colorado Rockies for Larry Walker, but Walker vetoed the trade.|$|E
500|$|Jepsen's second studio {{album was}} {{initially}} {{planned to be}} released on February 14, 2012; however, she chose not to release it {{because she wanted to}} make sure she [...] "got the second CD right. I think I got a <b>little</b> <b>nervous</b> about the idea of the sophomore being a little less-than because it's so rushed. So I wanted to give myself the time to not feel that pressure." [...] She then worked with songwriter Josh Ramsay and producer Ryan Stewart on most of the album's tracks. Jepsen's songwriting process was inspired by her life and friends. After the recording sessions were completed, Curiosity was announced as a full-length album, with a digital release date confirmed for February 14, 2012. A few days before its official release, however, the label decided to change the format of the album, turning it into an extended play. The songs cut from the album [...] "Lost and Found", [...] "Alice In Wonderland", [...] "Dear Julian", [...] "Europe" [...] and [...] "Angels" [...] came to have their preview on iTunes Canada, before having changed album to EP.|$|E
500|$|When Mirkin {{took over}} as show runner, he listed actor James Woods {{as one of the}} people he would most like to guest star on the show. Michael Caine was {{originally}} supposed to be the actor in the episode who takes over Apu's job at the Kwik-E-Mart, but he rejected the role. The story was therefore rewritten so that Woods received Apu's job instead. Woods was one of animation director David Silverman's favorite guest stars. Mirkin said he provided one of the [...] "most fantastic" [...] performances ever on the show, and commented that he [...] "nailed" [...] all of his lines and was [...] "so funny, right {{at the top of his}} head". Mirkin said that when most guest stars come in to record their lines for the show, they are a <b>little</b> <b>nervous</b> because they have never done voice-over before. Mirkin noted, however, that Woods was a [...] "fearless guy" [...] and he was [...] "so excited to do it because he was a huge fan of the show". Silverman noted that in addition to his humorous ad-libbing, Woods's tendency to hesitate while speaking was [...] "great for animation", explaining that it made the character feel more realistic. [...] "Homer and Apu" [...] features the popular Simpsons song [...] "Who Needs The Kwik-E-Mart?", sung by Apu and the Simpson family. The song was written by all of the show's writers in the writer's room, and it was composed by Alf Clausen. The song later appeared on the soundtrack album Songs in the Key of Springfield, which was released on March 18, 1997, and compiled many musical numbers from the show.|$|E

500|$|After Sill let Bettis and Lind {{know that}} Madonna was singing the song, some time elapsed before {{either of them}} heard {{anything}} from Warner Bros. Records. In between, they {{went to one of}} the recording sessions and were not impressed with the process of recording the song. Bettis commented, [...] "We went to one of the sessions, and to be honest, that particular session did not go all that well. [...] Jon and I were depressed about the way the song had come out. We heard nothing else about it and we were a <b>little</b> <b>nervous</b> that the song was going to be dropped from the picture." [...] Bettis went to England to work on the 1985 fantasy film Legend with music producer Jerry Goldsmith. It was there he received a call from Lind, who informed Bettis that a new version of [...] "Crazy for You" [...] was recorded and was made ready for a single release. Bettis was surprised and went over to Lind's house, where he warmly received the new recorded version of the song. It had a different arrangement from the demo version, and the arrangement was done by composer Rob Mounsey who rearranged the original track and added the background vocals. Bettis said: [...] "We owe a big debt of gratitude to [...] He really made a hit record out of [...]" [...] Mounsey was introduced in the project by record producer John [...] "Jellybean" [...] Benitez who was producing [...] "Crazy for You". Benitez was previously associated with producing dance-pop themed songs {{and it was the first}} time that he produced a ballad. In Fred Bronson's The Billboard Book of Number 1 Hits, Benitez commented, ...|$|E
500|$|On {{choosing}} {{his lead}} single, Drake told Rap-Up, [...] "It’s gotta {{be a real}} great song. It’s gotta be something that I feel is timeless and is better than anything that I’ve ever done." [...] Drake exclusively revealed to Rap-Up on February 15, 2010 that [...] "Over" [...] would be the lead single from his debut album, Thank Me Later, and would be produced by Boi-1da, producer of his previous singles [...] "Best I Ever Had" [...] and [...] "Forever". Drake chose to premiere the song on his hometown Toronto's radio station Flow 93.5. In an interview session with the station, Drake said, [...] "I went with 'Over' as the first look because of {{the words in the}} hook," [...] he said. [...] "The hook being the most repetitive part. I got a lot of great songs on my album. I got songs for women who wanna feel special. I got songs for dudes — if you ever thought my music was too soft, this is one you will enjoy. I got a lot of variety on there, but the biggest thing was that opening line on the hook: 'I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year'." [...] He went on to explain that the record sums up where he is in his career right now, and called it a [...] "great first impression". Drake did a lot of work for the song and also the album in Jamaica, during which he called the [...] "calm before the storm", and called [...] "Over" [...] the storm. He said, [...] "It's the moment. I wanted to emerge at first from this album and just let people know 'This is how I'm coming out in the public eye. I'm ready for anything." [...] He then went to explain that after the album people will be like [...] "he's still human" [...] or [...] "he's still thinking the same way", and said he wanted people to [...] "understand I could have lost it. He said, [...] "'Over' could have been my entire album. Just 'cause that's what this industry and game will do to you if you lose yourself." [...] Drake later said that the song was a [...] "warm-up record". He went on to say, [...] "I love the song. I love the message in the song. It's funny, because 'Over' is the fourth song on the album and it's the turning point in the album. It's like, you get three songs of me sort of trying to paint the picture of what the last year has been like for me — trying to fill you in, almost let you into my world as much as I can. 'Over' is that moment where you're almost worried on the album. 'Is this kid about to ... ? What's happening? Is he changing?' I wanted that to come out first. I wanted people to be a <b>little</b> <b>nervous.</b> This whole journey could have changed me drastically. Fortunately I'm able to step out of my shoes and reflect on it and give you some great music. 'Over' is a great alter-ego moment. It's the dark side of things and I really wanted that to come out first." ...|$|E

[...] Cramer continued that he had previously idolized Jon Stewart: [...] "The reason why it's been so hard for me, the attacks, is that early on I patterned my show off of his, which {{is that you can}} do an entertainment business show.

2500|$|By 2008, it {{had emerged}} in the media that Ichiro was known within {{baseball}} for his tradition of exhorting the American League team with a profanity-laced pregame speech in the clubhouse prior to the MLB All-Star Game. Asked if the speech had had any effect on the AL's decade-long winning streak, Ichiro deadpanned, [...] "I’ve got to say over 90 percent." [...] Minnesota first baseman Justin Morneau describes the effect: [...] "If you’ve never seen it, it's definitely something pretty funny. It's hard to explain, the effect it has on everyone. It's such a tense environment. Everyone's a <b>little</b> <b>nervous</b> for the game, and then he comes out.

2500|$|To reunite {{the couple}} in {{dramatic}} fashion, the show had Myrtle urge Bianca to follow Lena {{to the airport and}} demand an explanation; on the April 23, 2003 episode, the two characters shared the first same-sex kiss in American soap opera history. [...] "It's that kind of old romantic airport scene in which the two lovers decide whether they can take the risk and take a chance on love -- only it's two women this time," [...] relayed Riegel. Riegel had never kissed a woman before. [...] "I was a <b>little</b> <b>nervous</b> because I wanted it to look natural and organic and real and true," [...] she said. [...] "I didn't want it to seem tentative." [...] Riegel and Olga Sosnovska discussed practicing the kiss. [...] "We thought about maybe trying it out in the dressing room first," [...] Riegel laughed. [...] "But then we just thought, 'We are professionals. This will be fine."

That was the biggest challenge to me; I was going in there knowing, 'This is the moment.' I kept having to make myself laugh and leave set and play with my friends in the hair and makeup room and just sort of try to view the day as though it was just an average taping day because the last thing those scenes needed from my character's perspective was that sense of gravity, that feeling of, 'This is so important.'
