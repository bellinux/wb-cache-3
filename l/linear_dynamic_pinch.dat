40|$|At {{this first}} {{opportunity}} for open scientific dis-cussions {{on this subject}} we look forward with eagerness to exchanging experiences with others and hearing of the courses taken towards the common goal in the various laboratories of the world. Early Development At this laboratory, the peculiarly intriguing {{nature of the problem}} and the admirable consequences of its solution have long been recognized. Lively discussions of such matters as plasma drift in a torus and its effect on achieving a laboratory thermonuclear reac-tion occurred between Fermi, Kerst, Landshoff, Teller, R. R. Wilson and the writer in 1946, and an unsuccessful search for neutrons from colliding Munroe jets of metal deuterides was made at about the same time, based on an earlier paper by Ulam and the writer. When the subject was reopened in 1951, the toroidal pinch (as proposed, with a superimposed Bz field, by the writer in 1948) was selected as the confinement geometry for initial study and it passed through the usual vicissitudes and modifications— instability, <b>linear</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>pinches</b> (Columbus), rf pinches, so called Bz and wall stabilized pinches; while parallel speculations and experimental forays were made into cusped geometries (Picket Fence), spinning plasmas, shocks in axial and convergent geometries and magnetic mirrors. Our ideas and plans have undergone profound changes during the last seven years and are in process of undergoing another. As little as half a year ago, the chief obstacle to the achievement of a thermonuclear reaction via the stabilized pinch appeared to be contamination of the plasma by foreign atoms sputtered or evaporated off the walls. Doubtless this particular obstacle is still there, but in the meantime a crevasse has opened at our feet, in the form of our new experimental observa-tions of high energy losses from the pinched plasma. If these turn out to be due to the newly predicted surface hydromagnetic instabilities, then we know how to overcome these and the outlook may be better than ever. If the losses turn out to be due to plasm...|$|R

40|$|For a {{cylindrical}} aluminum conductor, 0. 2 cm {{in diameter}} and loaded by a current pulse from an overdamped discharge with an initial current rate of 490 kA/Mys, <b>dynamic</b> <b>pinch</b> compression and temperature rise have been calculated. The numerical solution for the azimuthal distribution of the pinch pressure, obtained by applying Picard's method of successive iteration, consists of the superposition of a quasi-stationary and a transient term. In the very initial phase of pinching a steep, narrow pressure pulse is created {{below the surface of}} the wire which converges at the center, thereby broadening in width, growing in strength, and increasing in propagation velocity. Already in the early stage of current flow at about 0. 4 mys, well before reaching maximum current and pinch pressure, the quasi-stationary term becomes dominant. Then the conductor is compressed quite homogeneously with the exception of a narrow shell below the surface where maximum pressure gradients exist.

A <b>linear</b> <b>dynamic</b> model was derived through a linearization of another, proposed, nonlinear dynamic model. This proposed nonlinear dynamic model was a more detailed version of existing nonlinear dynamic models. A form of the proposed <b>linear</b> <b>dynamic</b> model was derived for the study-case robot and simulations were carried out to demonstrate its accuracy and validity. The results of these simulations indicate that the proposed study-case <b>linear</b> <b>dynamic</b> model provides good tracking of the corresponding nonlinear (true) dynamic model, over {{the entire range of}} operations. In order to allow the proposed linear model to provide an even better representation of the corresponding nonlinear dynamic model, the linearization error of the proposed linear model was modeled as a stochastic plant disturbance and included in this model.
