Moult ends in late May or early June. <b>Long-tailed</b> <b>Widows</b> have rounder wings than other weaver species, possibly because their larger size affects flight aerodynamics. In the winter rainfall region, Southern Red Bishops and Yellow Bishops E. capensis start breeding after the winter rains, from August–November, and moult starts in early December. Primary moult duration in Yellow Bishops is relatively long, at 3. 4 months. Yellow Bishops grow individual primary feathers {{at an average}} rate of 21. 3 days per feather, while the other species moult primaries more quickly: White-winged Widow 8. 1 days, Fan-tailed Widow 11. 3 days, and Red-collared Widow 14. 4 days. The number of primaries growing simultaneously is similar in the different species. The longer duration of primary moult of the Yellow Bishop {{may be related to}} food...|$|R
50|$|The female <b>widow</b> <b>bird</b> {{chooses to}} mate with the most {{attractive}} long-tailed male so that her progeny, if male, will themselves be attractive to females {{of the next generation}} - thereby fathering many offspring that carry the female's genes. Since the rate of change in preference is proportional to the average taste amongst females, and as females desire to secure the services of the most sexually attractive males, an additive effect is created that, if unchecked, can yield exponential increases in a given taste and in the corresponding desired sexual attribute.|$|R

[...] It's a strange courage You give me, ancient star: Shine {{alone in the}} sunrise toward which you lend no part! I Shine alone, shine nakedly, shine like bronze that {{reflects}} neither my face nor any inner part of my being, shine like fire, that mirrors nothing. II Lend no part to any humanity that suffuses you in its own light. Be not chimera of morning, Half-man, half-star. Be not an intelligence, Like a <b>widow's</b> <b>bird</b> Or an old horse. [...] The italicized first lines make up a poem, [...] "El Hombre", by Stevens' modernist contemporary William Carlos Williams. The poem {{was first published in}} Little Review 5 (1918).|$|R

50|$|The flag is {{rectangular}} with {{length and}} breadth in {{a ratio of}} 3:2 respectively. The red stands for past battles, the blue for peace and stability, and the yellow for the resources of Swaziland. The central focus of the flag is a Nguni shield and two spears, symbolizing protection from the country's enemies. Its colour is meant to show that white and black people live in peaceful coexistence in Swaziland. The flag has four horizontal stripes - two blue strips {{at the top and}} bottom while the center stripe is red. Two thin yellow strips border the red strip in the flag. On the red strip is an ox hide combat shield from the traditional Swazi Emasotsha Regiment, laid horizontally. The shield is reinforced by a staff from which hangs injobo tassels-bunches of feathers of the widowbird and the lourie. They also decorate the shield. These feathers are used only by the king. Above the staff are two assegais-local spears, a Swazi fighting stick and three royal Swazi ornamental tassels called tinjobo, which are made from <b>widow</b> <b>bird</b> and loury feathers.|$|R
25|$|In 1993, Middleton {{made the}} {{decision}} to release recordings of the telephone conversations Johnson made throughout his presidency. Although Johnson had stipulated that the recordings be sealed until 50 years after his death (the year 2023), Middleton consulted with the President's <b>widow,</b> Lady <b>Bird</b> Johnson, about releasing them sooner, and she said the decision was his to make. The conversations, most of which were recorded on a Dictaphone machine, cover a variety of issues, including foreign policy, the Vietnam War and peace negotiations, legislation, civil rights, the economy, politics, labor issues, appointments, and press relations. Consequently, 642 hours of secretly taped telephone conversations have been made available to the public, providing insight into Johnson's legislative skills and substantially elevating his standing among past presidents.|$|R

He did not have the {{resources}} to be Bird's patron, but he would lend Bird items from his art collection to study. In 1814 when Bird asked for help in gaining a royal commission, Cumberland introduced him to Charles Long, who then arranged with the Prince Regent for Bird to conduct royal portrait studies aboard the royal yacht. On Bird's death in 1819 Cumberland successfully petitioned the Royal Academy to provide a pension for <b>Bird's</b> <b>widow.</b>|$|R

40|$|In this radio broadcast, Dieter Oschadleus {{discusses}} weavers, from nest-building {{patterns to}} {{the different kinds of}} weavers (masked weaver, <b>widow</b> and bishop <b>birds,</b> and sparrow weavers, scaly-feathered finch, etc.) and their respective habitats. Weaver nest sites also attract a variety of predators (snakes, birds of prey) and obligate nesters such as the pygmy falcon who do not create their own nests, and thus weaver sites create their own ecologies through provision of shade and concentration of droppings. Citizen scientists can get involved by photographs of weaver sites which are then used to build up a database of weaver sites which provide demographic information very useful to avian zoologists.

40|$|An {{old joke}} circulates among animal {{behavior}} instructors. One can, the joke goes, divide {{the topics of}} animal behavior into four Fs: fighting, fleeing, feeding, and reproduction. This somewhat tired joke carries considerable truth. Animals behaving in nature surely must make decisions about conflicts, predator avoidance, feeding, and mating. Male crickets, for example, are notoriously combative. Studies have shown, however, that they escalate fights in some situations and retreat to fight another day in others (Beaugrand, 1997; Parker, 1974; Parker 2 ̆ 6 Rubenstein, 1981). Squirrels, like many small animals, respond to {{the presence or absence}} of protective cover; for example, they will carry large food items into the safety of the bushes to consume them but eat small items immediately (Lima, Valone, 2 ̆ 6 Caraco, 1985). Female <b>widow</b> <b>birds</b> prefer males with long tails, and evolutionary theorists have argued that tail length correlates with male quality (Andersson, 1982, 1994). So a female confronted with a short-tailed male faces a dilemma: mate now or keep looking. Notice that in all of these choice situations, time complicates the animal’s problem: Risk injury by fighting now or retreat to fight later; stay exposed to possible predation or invest time in moving to a safer place; settle for the short-tailed male or keep looking. Each of these situations, and indeed virtually any naturally occurring choice situation one can imagine, is an intertemporal choice problem. We define these as choice situations in which an animal’s alternatives vary in the time at which the animal realizes consequences and in the quality of those consequences once the animal secures them. Although intertemporal choice applies to many domains (and all four Fs), we need to focus on a specific situation to make scientific headway, and for virtually all behavioral ecologists interested in intertemporal choice that focal situation is foraging. We can observe animal foraging choices easily (e. g., animals eat more often than they reproduce), and we can manipulate the time and magnitude of foraging options much more easily than we can manipulate mate quality or predation risk. Moreover, we have a large base of theoretical and empirical results that help us frame the intertemporal choice problem in the context of animal foraging behavior. Foraging is not only a convenient topic but also a fundamentally important one; actively seeking food is a basic part of animal existence that deserves our attention. In the first part of this chapter, we focus on adaptive aspects of intertemporal choice in animal foraging behavior, and especially on the problem of impulsivity, which we see as a central problem in intertemporal choice. In the second part of this chapter, we take a broader perspective, including domains other than food and extending beyond impulsivity to a more encompassing view of intertemporal choice. Within this general view, we explore the adaptive nature of impulsivity...|$|R
50|$|Elliot {{released}} his debut EP Death of a <b>Widow,</b> through Yer <b>Bird</b> Records, in 2010. Playing in New York's Lower East Side, Elliot {{and his band}} made their way from the small bar scene to some of New York's more popular venues, including Mercury Lounge and Webster Hall. Director Paul Cantagallo ask Elliott to compose the music for his film, Benny the Bum, which won Best Local Film at the 2012 Philadelphia Independent Film Festival. Elliot began headlining Philadelphia venues such as North Star and World Cafe Live. He was introduced to Rihanna’s former manager, Christa Shaub, {{which led to a}} chance meeting with an influential Norwegian journalist. That meeting led to a tour of Norway, a television appearance on the Norwegian show Store Studio, and a deal with the label Indie Recordings. Shortly after, he was featured on the music subscription service Tidal Rising.|$|R
5000|$|The {{third of}} these {{additional}} segments - [...] "The Guilty Men" [...] - was based substantially {{on the book}} Blood, Money & Power: How L.B.J. Killed J.F.K by Barr McClellan. The book and the episode directly implicates former U. S. President Lyndon B. Johnson (LBJ) and its airing in 2003 created an outcry among Johnson's surviving associates, including Johnson's <b>widow,</b> Lady <b>Bird</b> Johnson, former LBJ aides Bill Moyers and Jack Valenti (longtime president of the Motion Picture Association of America), U.S. Presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald R. Ford who was the last-living (at {{the time of the}} outcry) Warren Commission member. These Johnson supporters lodged complaints of libel with the History Channel, and subsequently threatened legal action against Arts & Entertainment Company, owner of the History Channel. The History Channel responded by assembling a panel of three historians, Robert Dallek, Stanley Kutler, and Thomas Sugrue. On a program aired April 7, 2004, titled [...] "The Guilty Man: A Historical Review," [...] the panel agreed that the documentary was not credible and should not have aired. The History Channel issued a statement saying, in part, [...] "The History Channel recognizes that 'The Guilty Men' failed to offer viewers context and perspective, and fell short of the high standards that the network sets for itself. The History Channel apologized to its viewers and to Mrs. Johnson and her family for airing the show." [...] The channel said it would not show the episode again. Author Barr McClellan, on whose work the episode was largely based, complained that he had tried to cooperate with the reviewing historians to discuss his evidence with them, and had been ignored.|$|R
