40|$|Taking {{the course}} of {{clinical}} practice is important for students under training of the physical therapy and the occupational therapy. Because the hospital affiliated with Gunma University has no course for clinical practice of rehabilitation, students educated under rehabilitation in our college are obliged to take their training course both {{in public and private}} institutions. However, institutions with rehabilitaion are few in Gunma prefecture. Then, students must get the institutions outside the prefecture far from out college. In the cource of the clinical practice, <b>living</b> <b>expense</b> of students runs-up when their training course does outside the prefecture. The <b>living</b> <b>expense</b> is about twice (about 260, 000 Japanese yen) outside the prefecture than inside. Moreover, the students who could not settle their apartment in public survice outside the prefecture are obliged to pay far great expense. Students suffer from both their big <b>living</b> <b>expense</b> and quite a distant from our college at the clinical training in rehabilitaion. This prevents students from thier effective education progress on rehabilitaioin. The reasones as mentioned above, it will be said that the hospital affiliated with Gunma University should pay, as possible as, the effort to settle {{the course of}} clinical parctice for rehabilitaition...|$|R

There, he became friendly with the impresario Carl Rosa and the violinist Joseph Joachim. For his last year at Leipzig, his father scraped together the money for <b>living</b> <b>expenses,</b> and the conservatoire assisted by waiving its fees. Sullivan credited his Leipzig period with tremendous musical growth. His graduation piece, completed in 1861, was a set of incidental music to Shakespeare's The Tempest.

Majoring in mathematics, he joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity and maintained high marks, narrowly failing the selection criteria for Phi Beta Kappa Society. He was on the track and field and rifle teams, and also competed in the wrestling and football teams. He won the Indiana and Kentucky Amateur Athletic Union marathon in 1925. He waited tables, washed dishes and worked in a cement factory to help pay his expenses. Lack of funds compelled him to take a year off after his junior year to teach school, and his expenses were further strained when he contracted a severe case of pneumonia and incurred hospital bills. He opted to enroll in the Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) to offset his <b>living</b> <b>expenses,</b> and later recalled that this was the only reason he joined the military.
