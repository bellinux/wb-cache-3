Obayashi desired the special effects to look unrealistic, as if a child created them. For the scene in which Ai Matsubara's character vanishes under the blood, Obayashi had her suspended nude, pouring buckets of blue paint on her to create a blue-screen chroma key effect where the blue colored parts of her body would deteriorate on camera. The outcome of a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> effects would be unknown until the film was completed. Obayashi stated that sometimes the effects did not turn out how he originally envisioned them.|$|E

They also developed this innovative electronic network called Mercury which shared anti-piracy tactics with other task forces and operations. Since this was an informal system, it wasn’t weighed down with bureaucracy and could be spread amongst other coalitions and governmental organizations and could effectively help anyone that needed precise information in the area.|$|E
25|$|People {{started to}} feel that the police were taking sides with the city council and Faderhuset. Tensions boiled over when a {{demonstration}} on 24 September was attacked by the police. The reason for the police attack apparently was a bottle being thrown at a police van. The police responded with a full frontal baton-charge on the demonstration. This led to several hours of street fighting between police and demonstrators. During the street fighting, three hundred people were arrested, many of which had not been involved with the fighting. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> later claimed to have been brutally treated while in police custody.

500|$|Other symbols, images, and allusions that {{appeared}} throughout the series often emerged unexpectedly. Moore mentioned that [...] "he whole thing with Watchmen {{has just been}} loads of these little bits of synchronicity popping {{up all over the}} place". Gibbons noted an unintended theme was contrasting the mundane and the romantic, citing the separate sex scenes between Nite Owl and Silk Spectre on his couch and then high in the sky on Nite Owl's airship. In a book of the craters and boulders of Mars, Gibbons discovered a photograph of the Galle crater, which resembles a happy face, which they worked into an issue.

500|$|In an {{overview}} of the third season in Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Apocrypha" [...] was rated an A. The review noted that the episode offered [...] "some interesting progressions in the grand theme" [...] of the series, although it was also [...] "worth it just for the awesome missile site finale" [...] alone. Writing for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen also rated the episode an A. Handlen felt the episode was impressive in its general impression, but that the details were not necessarily important; he also added that the cyclical nature of the plot of most mythology episodes was not something he felt negatively about, noting that although the series' protagonists are often defeated, they [...] "can't be corrupted or dissuaded or undone". Co-writer Frank Spotnitz said of the episode [...] "I actually think you didn't learn a lot more about the conspiracy in these two episodes, but emotionally, I think they were really good episodes ... It is really easy to go through a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> action things with people dying and never addressing them. So I thought it was very interesting to do so".|$|E

500|$|After {{the release}} of The Avengers in May 2012, Tom Russo of Boston.com noted that aside from the {{occasional}} [...] "novelty" [...] such as Aliens vs. Predator (2004), {{the idea of a}} shared universe was virtually unheard of in Hollywood. Since that time, the shared universe model created by Marvel Studios has begun to be replicated by other film studios that held rights to other comic book characters. In April 2014, Tuna Amobi, a media analyst for Standard & Poor's Equity Research Services, stated that in the previous three to five years, Hollywood studios began planning [...] "megafranchises" [...] for years to come, opposed to working one blockbuster at a time. Amobi added, [...] "A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> superhero characters were just being left there to gather dust. Disney has proved that this [...] can be a gold mine." [...] However, with additional studios now [...] "playing the megafranchise game", Doug Creutz, media analyst for Cowen and Company, feels the allure will eventually die for audiences: [...] "If Marvel's going to make two or three films a year, and Warner Brothers is going to do at least a film every year, and Sony's going to do a film every year, and Fox [...] going to do a film every year, can everyone do well in that scenario?

500|$|Due to the secretive culture around masked wrestlers in Lucha libre Espantito's {{real name}} {{is not a matter}} of common knowledge, nor has it been {{revealed}} if he worked under a different ring name before he made his in-ring debut as Espantito. It has been confirmed that Espantito trained in his native Torreón, Coahuila under the tutelage of Edgardo Cisneros Díaz, better known as Espanto II and also received further training from Indio Chirikawa. In the early 1990s the Mini-Estrella concept was introduced in Mexico, featuring not just Midget professional wrestling but also wrestlers who were short in stature. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> new Mini-Estrellas used the same ring character as regular sized wrestlers such as Octagoncito being a smaller version of Octagón. Due to his short stature, , the future Espantito became a natural fit in the Mini-Estrellas division and was given permission by his trainer to start working as a smaller version of Los Espantos ("The Terriors") and became known as El Espantito, wearing the signature black mask with a white cross on it popularized by Espanto I, Espanto II and Espanto III as well as the same black-and-white ring gear of the originals. As Espantito he was one of the first competitors in the newly created Asistencia Asesoría y Administración's (AAA) Mini-Estrella division. Most of AAA's Mini-Estrella division consisted of luchadors that had followed AAA founder Antonio Peña from Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), where some of the Mini-Estrellas changed their name and mask due to the larger version of the character not jumping to AAA at the time. One example was Super Muñequito, who was working as [...] "Angelito Azteca" [...] in CMLL, but had to change his name as Ángel Azteca did not leavel CMLL. It has not been revealed if Espectrito also worked in the CMLL Mini-Estrella division at the time of the AAA Exodous.|$|E
