50|$|Coffin lock is a slang {{term for}} a blind panel {{connector}} (also called a butt-joint fastener) often used in scenic construction to join together stage decks or scenery in a butt joint. These are two part connectors (male and female) that draw together and lock. The two most common types are the cam and acceptor and more traditional hook and pin version. These devices generally use an hex key to operate the locking mechanism via a small diameter hole either through the face or rear of the panel. When locked, the considerable mechanical advantage offered by the cam or hook holds the panels tightly together. Coffin locks can be installed directly into a mortise cut into each panel for total concealment except for the <b>locking</b> <b>hole</b> or mounted {{to the rear of}} the panels. Many small theatres use stock platforms with coffin locks built into the frames.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Internal fixators with angular {{stability}} {{have been}} developed to provide high stability without compression of the plate on to the bone. Angular and axial stability of a plate-screw construct can be achieved using a conically threaded screw head undersurface and a corresponding conically threaded plate hole. Furthermore, the insertion angle of the screw must correspond precisely to the axis of the screw hole. This is not always achieved in clinical practice and may result in screw loosening. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the relationship between the stability of the locked screw-plate on the insertion angle of the screw. Methods: Locking screws were inserted in an isolated (Point Contact Fixator, PC-Fix) or combined (Locking Compression Plate, LCP 4. 5) <b>locking</b> <b>hole</b> with the use of an aiming device. The optimal insertion angle for these plates is perpendicular to the plate surface. The screws were inserted with an axis deviation of 0 [degrees] (optimal condition), 5 [degrees], and 10 [degrees] respective to the optimal angle (variance +/- 1 [degrees]). The samples were tested under shear or axial (push out) loading conditions until failure occurred. An Instron materials testing machine was used. Results: Locking screws inserted in the isolated <b>locking</b> <b>hole</b> (PC-Fix) showed a significant decrease of failure load if inserted at 5 [degrees] and 10 [degrees] angle. Using an optimal insertion angle (0 [degrees]), failure load was 1480 +/- 390 N, with 5 [degrees] axis deviation 780 +/- 160 N, P = 0. 0001, and with 10 [degrees] axis deviation 550 +/- 110 N, P = 0. 0001.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundDuring {{the last}} decades, {{intramedullary}} nailing {{has become the}} standard treatment for diaphyseal fractures of long bones. Numerous innovative techniques and devices have been proposed to simplify distal locking. Each has its own limitations and, as a result, the fluoroscopy-dependent “free-hand technique” remains the most popular method. However, radiation exposure to the patient and operating room staff remains a concern. MethodsBefore {{the development of a}} new radiation-independent, nail-mounted targeting system, we mathematically analyzed the aiming accuracy that such a system has to achieve. The correctness of this mathematical model was evaluated using a mechanical testing apparatus. FindingsWe found a quite large targeting range for the unimpeded passage of the drill bit through the <b>locking</b> <b>hole</b> of a given nail. Important degrees of nail bending can thereby be compensated. As predicted by the mathematical formula, a 4 -mm drill bit passed the distal <b>locking</b> <b>hole</b> of a 320 / 11 mm femoral nail up to a deflection of ± 13 mm in the coronal plane. InterpretationThis mathematical model can be considered to be an additional tool for the development of new targeting devices. Combining our mathematical model with data previously published, not only torsional deformation along the longitudinal axis of the nail but also bending in the coronal plane can approximately be neglected. Hence, the three-dimensional aiming process can be simplified to the determination of the interlocking hole of the nail in the sagittal plane provided that the insertion-induced nail deformation in vivo stays in the range of that observed in vitro.

The distal locking bolts were inserted using a free hand technique; a Kirschner wire was positioned at the <b>locking</b> <b>hole</b> of the nail with X-ray assistance and drilled over with a cannulated drill before insertion of the distal locking screw.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Axial {{dynamization}} of fractures {{can promote}} healing, and overly stiff fixation can suppress healing. A novel technology, termed active plating, provides controlled axial dynamization by the elastic suspension of <b>locking</b> <b>holes</b> within the plate. This prospective, controlled animal study evaluated {{the effect of}} active plates on fracture-healing in an established ovine osteotomy model. We hypothesized that symmetric axial dynamization with active plates stimulates circumferential callus and delivers faster and stronger healing relative to standard locking plates. METHODS: Twelve sheep {{were randomly assigned to}} receive a standard locking plate or an active locking plate for stabilization of a 3 -mm tibial osteotomy gap. The only difference between plates was that <b>locking</b> <b>holes</b> of active plates were elastically suspended, allowing up to 1. 5 mm of axial motion at the fracture. Fracture-healing was analyzed weekly on radiographs. After sacrifice at nine weeks postoperatively, callus volume and distribution were assessed by computed tomography. Finally, to determine their strength, healed tibiae and contralateral tibiae were tested in torsion until failure. RESULTS: At each follow-up, the active locking plate group had more callus (p < 0. 001) than the standard locking plate group. At postoperative week 6, all active locking plate group specimens had bridging callus at the three visible cortices. In standard locking plate group specimens, only 50...|$|R

30|$|Nail {{impingement}} {{against the}} anterior femoral cortex during nail insertion, or anterior cortex penetration, {{has been described}} in the literature as a worrying complication. We describe a previously unreported surgical failure due to a compromised dynamic distal locking caused by distal jamming of the nail. An 80 -year-old male suffered a closed right intertrochanteric femoral fracture. Due {{to the presence of}} a long medial fragment, a 240  mm long titanium trochanteric nail was chosen to stabilize the fracture. Dynamic distal locking was performed by placing the distal screw at the inferior rim of the elliptical <b>locking</b> <b>hole</b> to allow compression of the fracture site during weight-bearing. Six-month X-ray follow-up revealed a broken nail and nonunion of the fracture due to failed dynamization of the distal locking screw. The nail was removed and replaced by a total arthroplasty. Due to the femoral anterior bow of the shaft, anterior cortical impingement of the distal tip of a nail may result in the failure of the nail to slide within the diaphyseal canal when using a medium-length nail preventing compression of the fracture. Dynamic distal locking can be ineffective if the ability of the distal nail to slide within the diaphyseal canal is hindered. This type of scenario can represent an opportunity for anterior nail impingement. Distal jamming of the nail can thus compromise dynamic compression at the fracture site during loading, thus inducing nonunion of the fracture, and leading to breakage of the osteosynthesis device. For these reasons, caution is recommended when using medium-length trochanteric nails for unstable trochanteric fractures.|$|E
40|$|Zur Diagnostik von Rupturen der Rotatorenmanschette wird häufig die im Vergleich zur Sonografie deutlich kostenintensivere Magnetresonanztomografie durchgeführt. Ein Grund hierfür ist, dass es zum Teil schwierig ist, standardisierte statische Sonografie-Bilder zu gewinnen, was die reproduzierbare, untersucherunabhängige diagnostische Information verringert. Ziel des ersten Teils der Arbeit war es einerseits, zu analysieren, ob mit der 3 D-Sonografie diese Probleme verringert werden könnten und andererseits die Sensitivität mit dem 2 D-Ultraschall zur Diagnostik von Komplett- und Partialrupturen zu vergleichen. Bei der Untersuchung von 114 Patienten konnten mit dem 3 D-Ultraschall Rupturen der Rotatorenmanschette gut dargestellt werden. Der Vergleich zwischen 2 D- und 3 D-Ultraschall ergab keinen statistisch signifikanten Unterschied zwischen beiden Verfahren für die Diagnostik von Komplett- und Partialrupturen. Ein Vorteil war die Möglichkeit der untersucherunabhängigen simultanen Auswertung von drei standardisierten Schnittebenen zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt. Bei der Verwendung biodegradierbarer Anker zur Fixierung von Weichteilen können ossäre Reaktionen auftreten. Ziel war es, die frühen Reaktionen des umgebenden Gewebes auf einen Poly-(L-co-D/L-Lactid) 70 / 30 Anker im Vergleich zu einem Titananker im Schafsknochen zu analysieren. Innerhalb von 20 Wochen nach Implantation zeigte sich keinerlei Verlust von Knochensubstanz im Bereich des distalen Schafsfemur bei Ankern aus Titan oder aus Polylactid. Vielmehr zeigte sich eine ausgeprägte Neuformation von spongiösem Knochen in die Implantathohlräume vor allem für das biodegradierbare Material. Daher sollten neben materialbedingten Ursachen auch biomechanische Ursachen wie zyklische Belastungen für mögliche Osteolysen in Betracht gezogen werden. Die arthroskopische subacromiale Dekompression (ASD) ist ein häufig durchgeführtes Verfahren zur Therapie von Subachromialsyndromen. Es sollten die eigenen Ergebnisse seit 1993 unter Berücksichtigung von Nebendiagnosen sowie die Möglichkeit, verschiedene Scores und VAS auch telefonisch erheben zu können, analysiert werden. Die Untersuchung von 422 Schultern zwischen 1, 5 und 9, 5 Jahren (durchschnittlich 4, 8 Jahre) nach der Operation zeigte, dass die ASD mit überwiegend guten und sehr guten subjektiven und objektiven Resultaten (ca. 75 %) ein zuverlässiges {{operatives}} Verfahren ist. Im Gegensatz zu einem laufenden Rentenverfahren hatten Rupturen der Rotatorenmanschette zum Zeitpunkt der Operation keinen negativen Einfluss auf das Operationsergebnis. Bei Nichtbeachtung der Pathologie des superioren Labrums und bei Rezidivoperation kam es zu einem erhöhten Anteil an Therapieversagern. Die telefonische Erhebung verschiedener Schulter-Scores (ausgenommen Constant-Score) und der VAS lieferte valide Resultate, die eine klinische Untersuchung entbehrlich machen und insbesondere bei Langzeitstudien eine wesentlich höhere Nachuntersuchungsrate ermöglichen. Das Konzept der winkelstabilen Osteosynthese ermöglicht eine weichteilschonende, minimal-invasive Frakturstabilisierung. Um eine sichere Verankerung von winkelstabilen Schrauben zu erreichen, ist eine korrekte Positionierung der Schraube in der Platte erforderlich. In biomechanischen Testungen konnte gezeigt werden, dass bei einer geringen Abweichung des Insertionswinkels winkelstabiler Schrauben von bis zu 5 ° vom optimalen Winkel immer noch eine hohe Stabilität der Schrauben-/Plattenverbindung gewährleistet war. Ab einem Winkel von über 5 ° kam es zu einer signifikanten Abnahme der Festigkeit dieser Verbindung. Um eine optimale Festigkeit der Verbindung Schraube/Platte zu erreichen und das Risiko der Schraubenlockerung zu minimieren, ist die konsequente Benutzung eines Zielgerätes zu empfehlen. Die klinische Nachuntersuchung von 53 Patienten mit winkelstabiler Osteosynthese bei proximaler Humerusfraktur zeigte eine mit der Literatur vergleichbare Komplikationsrate bei verringertem sekundären Dislokationsrisiko. Es zeigte sich aber auch die Problematik dieser Fakturen mit langer Nachbehandlungsdauer und dem Risiko einer Humeruskopfnekrose im Verlauf. Winkelstabile Implantate ermöglichten eine sichere Stabilisierung von proximalen Humerusfrakturen, konnten jedoch eine insuffiziente Anwendung - wie eine fehlerhafte Verankerung der Kopfverriegelungsschrauben - nicht kompensieren. Erhöht war das Risiko einer Schraubenperforation durch die Sinterung des Kopfes auf das rigide Implantat. Goal of {{the study}} was evaluation of advantages and limitations of shoulder diagnosis and different techniques of minimal invasive shoulder surgery. MRI has become the standard for diagnosis of rotator cuff lesions, since {{it can be difficult to}} obtain standardized ultrasound images. Goal {{of the study}} was analysis of sensitivity of 3 D- in comparison to 2 D-ultrasound. Examination of 114 patients showed excellent visualization of rotor cuff defects with 3 D-ultrasound. Comparison to 2 D-ultrasound showed no statistical significant difference between both methods for diagnosis of full- and partial thickness defects of the rotator cuff. Advantage of 3 D-ultrasound was the possibility of simultaneous visualization of three standardized planes. For the reattachment of ligaments and tendons biodegradable implants are increasingly used today. However, with the use of biodegradable implants early and late osteolysis has been reported. Goal of this study was to analyze the early osseous integration of a newly designed suture anchor in comparison to a titanium implant. The implants made of Poly-(L-co-D/L-lactide) 70 / 30 or titanium were inserted into the cancellous bone of the distal femoral condyle in four sheep. The animals were followed radiographically over a period of 20 weeks in which no final implant degradation was anticipated. After sacrifice new bone formation was quantitatively and local tissue response qualitatively analyzed from microradiographs and histological sections were examined. New bone formation was seen around both implant materials within 20 weeks. Inside the recess of the polylactide suture anchor there was significantly higher bony ingrowth (p = 0. 026) as compared to the titanium implant. Histologically non of the materials did show any inflammatory reaction. These data indicate that early osteolysis around Poly-(L-co-D/L-lactide) 70 / 30 suture anchors in cancellous bone may not be attributable to the material properties but rather to other reasons such as the mechanical situation at the implant-bone interface. Arthroscopic subacromial decompression (ASD) has become a well established procedure to treat chronic subacromial impingement syndrome. Goal {{of the study was}} to retrospectively evaluate the outcome and to evaluate the validity of data collection by telephone interview. The examination of 422 patients average 4. 8 years after peration showed in 75 % goog and excellent results. The average Constant score (raw score) improved from 46 to 80 Pts. Patients who had a second ASD had good results in only 25 %. Patients with running workers compensation application showed no satisfying outcome. Lesions of the rotator cuff were shown to have no significant influence on the outcome in comparison to patients with intact rotator cuff. Additionally, it was shown that the assessment of various shoulder scores (except Constant Score) by telephone interview is possible. Internal fixators with angular stability have been developed in order to provide high stability without compression of the plate on to the bone. The insertion angle of the screw must correspond precisely to the axis of the screw hole. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between the stability of the locked screw-plate on the insertion angle of the screw. Locking screws were inserted in a isolated or combined <b>locking</b> <b>hole</b> with the use of an aiming device. The screws were inserted with an axis deviation of 0 °(optimal condition), 5 ° and 10 °. The samples were tested under shear or axial (push out) loading conditions until failure occurred. Locking screws inserted in the isolated <b>locking</b> <b>hole</b> (PC-Fix) showed a significant decrease of failure load if inserted at 5 ° and 10 ° angle. Screws inserted in the combined <b>locking</b> <b>hole</b> (LCP) also showed a significant decrease of push-out force of 77 % with 10 ° axis deviation. A locking head screw exhibits a high stability with a moderate axis deviation in the angle of insertion of up to 5 °. However there is a significant decrease in stability with increasing axis deviation (> 5 °). A aiming device is recommended to provide an optimal fixation with angular stability. Clinical Examination of 53 patients with angular stable osteosynthesis of proximal humeral fractures showed a rate of complications, which can be compared with literature with lower risk of secondary dislocation. Implants with angular stability allow stable fixation of proximal humeral fractures however the risk of screw perforation is higher...|$|E

This {{was a special}} plate prepared {{for use by the}} author with 4.5 -mm <b>locking</b> <b>holes</b> at one end and a cluster of 3.5 -mm <b>locking</b> <b>holes</b> at the other end (distal).The outcome was excellent in their series; however, this approach also involves modification of existing designs and their bulk production for universal use. Zhiquan et al. [11] treated 13 distal third humeral shaft fractures with minimally invasive percutaneous osteosynthesis (MIPO). Fractures were reduced by closed means and fixed with a long narrow 4.5 -mm dynamic compression plate introduced through two small incisions away from the fracture site. The plate was fixed on the anterior aspect of the humerus under fluoroscopy guidance. The radial nerve was not exposed during this procedure. They reported that the fractures united with a mean healing time of 16.2  weeks, a little longer than the reported time of 9 – 12  weeks in posterior open plating of the humerus. Disadvantages of this approach are that the radial nerve is not visualized directly during the exposure and, biomechanically, the posterior surface of the humerus is considered better for plate application especially of distal-third fractures. Schatzker and Tile listed four reasons for plating the distal humerus posteriorly—the posterior surface of the distal humerus provides a flat surface suitable for plating; placement of the most distal screws from a posterior approach allows direct visualization and avoids the antecubital fossa; posterior placement allows for the plate to extend distally permitting additional screw placement; and the posterior approach provides the option of double plating [12]. Livani et al. [6] obtained good results following minimally invasive percutaneous DCP fixation of distal humerus fractures in six patients with radial nerve palsy. We chose an LCP due to the presence of significant comminution in many of our patients. The open surgical approach that we used required more soft tissue stripping which made stable fixation mandatory. Since the majority of our patients had no radial palsy pre-operatively, nerve exploration and protection required an open approach.|$|R

These could be traced to a track in the adjacent tibia created by removal of an intramedullary nail and locking screws. This too contained dense bone graft material. The graft had migrated from the <b>locking</b> screw <b>holes</b> in the proximal tibia which had been filled approximately 2 months previously...|$|R

5000|$|In theory, {{the motor}} failure {{on the plane}} could not present a problem because the locking lever {{would not be able}} to close. However, during the {{investigation}} a McDonnell Douglas test rig demonstrated that the entire locking pin operating system was too weak, allowing the handle to be forced closed even with the pins out of the <b>locking</b> <b>holes.</b> This occurred on Flight 96, when the handler forced the handle closed with his knee. In spite of the vent not closing completely, neither the handler nor the engineer considered this to be serious. Although the vent door remained partially open, it closed enough to cause it to [...] "blow shut", and thereby allow pressurization of the cargo hold. Although the handle did not seat the pins entirely, the small amount of motion it managed to cause was enough to press on the warning indicator switch, deactivating the cockpit warning light. It was only the combination of all of these failures that allowed the accident to happen. Yet all of these indicators had a single common point of failure: the mechanical weakness of the locking system that allowed the handle to be moved.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{effectiveness}} of a novel radiation-independent aiming device for distal locking of intramedullary nails in a human cadaver model. METHODS: A new targeting system was used in 25 intact human cadaver femora for the distal locking procedure after insertion of an intramedullary nail. The number of successful screw placements and the time needed for this locking procedure were recorded. The accuracy of the aiming process was evaluated by computed tomography. RESULTS: The duration of the distal locking process was 8. 0 ± 1. 8 minutes (mean ± SD; range, 4 - 11 minutes). None of the screw placements required fluoroscopic guidance. Computed tomography revealed high accuracy of the locking process. The incidence angle (α) of the locking screws through the distal <b>locking</b> <b>holes</b> of the nail was 86. 8 ° ± 5. 0 ° (mean ± SD; range, 80 °- 96 °). Targeting failed in 1 static locking screw because of a material defect in the drilling sleeve. CONCLUSIONS: This cadaver study indicated that an aiming arm-based targeting device is highly reliable and accurate. The promising results suggest that it will help to decrease radiation exposure compared with the traditional "free-hand technique. ...|$|R
40|$|In solid, the {{crystalline}} structure can endow electron an internal {{degree of freedom}} known as valley, which characterizes the degenerate energy minima in momentum space. The recent success in optical pumping of valley polarization in 2 D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has greatly promoted the concept of valley-based informatics and electronics. However, between the demonstrated valley polarization of transient electron-hole pair excitations and practical valleytronic operations, there exist obvious gaps to fill, among which is the valley pump of long-lived charge carriers. Here we discover that the quested valley pump of electrons or holes can be realized simply by scattering at the ubiquitous nonmagnetic disorders, not relying on any specific material property. The mechanism {{is rooted in the}} nature of valley as a momentum space index: the intervalley backscattering in general has valley contrasted rate due to the distinct momentum transfers, causing a net transfer of population from one valley to another. As examples, we numerically demonstrate the sizable valley pump effects driven by charge current in nanoribbons of monolayer TMDs, where the spin-orbit scattering by non-magnetic disorders also realizes spin pump for the spin-valley <b>locked</b> <b>holes.</b> Our finding points to an unexpected new opportunity towards valley-spintronics, turning disorders from a deleterious factor to a resource of valley and spin polarization.
