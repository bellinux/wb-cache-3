5|$|<b>Learning</b> <b>for</b> Life is {{a school}} and work-site based program that is a {{subsidiary}} of the BSA. It utilizes programs designed for schools and community-based organizations that are designed to prepare youth for the complexities of contemporary society and to enhance their self-confidence, motivation, and self-esteem.

5|$|In 1917, Providence College {{was founded}} as an all-male school {{through the efforts}} of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence and the Dominican Province of St. Joseph.

5|$|The White Stag {{program is}} {{currently}} offered by two related non-profit groups in Northern and Central California. In northern California, the non-profit White Stag Association sponsors three Venturing crews, a <b>Learning</b> <b>for</b> Life group, and a Boy Scout troop that plan and produce the summer camp program in Northern California, {{in the past}} at Camp John Mensinger, Camp Wolfeboro, and since 2014 at Camp Robert L.

5|$|The {{traditional}} Scouting {{divisions are}} Cub Scouting for boys ages 7 to 11 years, Boy Scouting for boys ages 11 to 18 and Venturing {{for young men}} and women ages 14 (or 13 and having completed the 8th grade) through 21. <b>Learning</b> <b>for</b> Life is a non-traditional subsidiary that provides in-school and career education. Starting in 2018, girls will be allowed to join Cub Scout dens, and in 2019, programs for older girls will allow for a path to earn the rank of Eagle Scout.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the BSA's <b>Learning</b> <b>for</b> Life, {{membership}} in the traditional BSA programs has been more restricted and controversial. Until recently, girls {{were not allowed to}} join Cub Scouting or Boy Scouting, but could join Venturing and Sea Scouting; women can be adult volunteers in all programs. On October 11, 2017, the BSA announced that girls would be allowed to become Cub Scouts, starting in 2018, and that in 2019, a separate program for older girls will be available, enabling girls to earn the rank of Eagle Scout.|$|E

5|$|At the age {{of eight}} the younger Reginald began {{attending}} the local grammar school at Whitchurch, where he remained for five years. In 1796 {{he was sent to}} Bristow's, a small private school in Neasden a few miles north of Central London. This establishment provided intensive <b>learning</b> <b>for</b> around a dozen boys, preparing them for eventual entry to Oxford or Cambridge universities. At Bristow's Reginald met John Thornton, who became a lifelong friend. The pair shared a lively interest in church history and beliefs; a lengthy letter, written by Heber to Thornton, is described by Heber's biographer Arthur Montefiore as being worthy of a learned theologian. In October 1800 Heber entered Brasenose College, Oxford; Thornton's decision to go to Cambridge was a matter for Heber's considerable regret.|$|E
5|$|In central California, the {{non-profit}} White Stag Leadership Development Academy sponsors a <b>Learning</b> <b>for</b> Life group, a Venturing crew, and a Boy Scout troop in the Silicon Valley Monterey Bay Council and the Alameda Council. These youth plan {{and put on}} a program each summer in Central California. In 2009 they offered for the first time two camps, one at Camp Tamarancho in Marin County in Northern California, and the second at Camp Lindblad in the Santa Cruz Mountains. They have continued to offer two weeks of summer camp and in 2012 based the program at a site in the Santa Lucia Range near Arroyo Seco. Youth staff participants are registered as members of the Boy Scouts or Venturing programs in the Silicon Valley Monterey Bay Council and the Alameda Council.|$|E
5|$|Kanaka Dasa (whose {{birth name}} was Thimmappa Nayaka, 1509–1609) of Kaginele (in modern Haveri district) was an ascetic and spiritual seeker, who {{according}} to historical accounts {{came from a}} family of Kuruba (shepherds) or beda (hunters). Under the patronage of the Vijayanagara king, he authored such important writings as Mohanatarangini ("River of Delight", 1550), written in dedication to King Krishnadevaraya, which narrates the story of Krishna in sangatya metre. His other famous writings are Narasimhastava, a work dealing with glory of God Narasimha, Nalacharita, the story of Nala, which is noted for its narration, and Hari Bhaktisara, a spontaneous writing on devotion in shatpadi metre. The latter writing, which is on niti (morals), bhakti (devotion) and vairagya (renunciation), continues to be a popular standard book of <b>learning</b> <b>for</b> children. A unique allegorical poem titled Ramadhanya Charitre ("Story of Rama's Chosen Grain") which exalts ragi over rice was authored by Kanaka Dasa. In this poem, a quarrel arises between ragi, the food grain of the poor, and rice, that of the rich, as to which is superior. Rama decides that ragi is superior because it does not rot when preserved. This is one of the earliest poetic expressions of class struggle in the Kannada language. In addition to these classics, about 240 songs written by Kanaka Dasa are available.|$|E

You have to love {{learning}} {{and the best way}} to get training is by doing.” He acknowledges the reality that when starting out you will likely need to do everything for yourself or with a small team. Does this preclude the help of outsiders? No, but inevitably even the strongest of allies will not be able to shoulder much of the load that falls on the founder and his/her venture team. Perhaps there is some luck in building a team around you with the requisite skills.|$|R
