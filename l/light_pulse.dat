5|$|In general relativity, no {{material}} body {{can catch up}} with or overtake a <b>light</b> <b>pulse.</b> No influence from an event A can reach any other location X before light sent out at A to X. In consequence, an exploration of all light worldlines (null geodesics) yields key information about the spacetime's causal structure. This structure can be displayed using Penrose–Carter diagrams in which infinitely large regions of space and infinite time intervals are shrunk ("compactified") so as to fit onto a finite map, while light still travels along diagonals as in standard spacetime diagrams.|$|E
5|$|Nowadays, using {{oscilloscopes}} {{with time}} resolutions {{of less than}} one nanosecond, {{the speed of light}} can be directly measured by timing the delay of a <b>light</b> <b>pulse</b> from a laser or an LED reflected from a mirror.

40|$|A {{classical}} logic gate connecting {{input and output}} <b>light</b> <b>pulses</b> is demonstrated. The gate operation is based on three steps: First, two incoming <b>light</b> <b>pulses</b> are stored in a Bose-Einstein condensate, second, atomic four-wave mixing generates a new matter wave, and third, the <b>light</b> <b>pulses</b> are retrieved. In {{the presence of the}} new matter wave, the retrieval generates a new optical wave. The latter will only be generated if both input <b>light</b> <b>pulses</b> are applied, thus realizing an AND gate.

5|$|Using global geometry, some spacetimes can {{be shown}} to contain {{boundaries}} called horizons, which demarcate one region {{from the rest of}} spacetime. The best-known examples are black holes: if mass is compressed into a sufficiently compact region of space (as specified in the hoop conjecture, the relevant length scale is the Schwarzschild radius), no light from inside can escape to the outside. Since no object can overtake a <b>light</b> <b>pulse,</b> all interior matter is imprisoned as well. Passage from the exterior to the interior is still possible, showing that the boundary, the black hole's horizon, is not a physical barrier.|$|E

40|$|It is {{an object}} of the present {{invention}} to provide a compact and low-cost system for generating ultra short high energy laser <b>light</b> <b>pulses</b> that does not use the known CPA scheme. The proposed approach is based on spectral filtering of laser <b>light</b> <b>pulses</b> of a mode locked laser source. The used mode locked laser source can be of any kind as long as its filtered residual pulse bandwidth supports pulse durations longer than 20 ps and up to 1 ns. After filtering the laser <b>light</b> <b>pulses</b> are directly amplified in an amplification element consisting {{of one or more}} amplification stages. At the same time or just after amplification the <b>light</b> <b>pulses</b> are spectrally broadened through a spectral broadening element, for example a fiber of suitably chosen core diameter and length to achieve a spectral bandwidth that is wide enough to support sub 10 ps pulses. Finally, the spectrally broadened laser <b>light</b> <b>pulses</b> are compressed by a compact dispersive element consisting of one or more Bragg gratings or a grating pair...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that a {{dielectric}} medium can be used to manipulate properties of <b>light</b> <b>pulses.</b> However, optical absorption limits the extent of possible control: this is especially important for weak <b>light</b> <b>pulses.</b> Absorption in an opaque medium can be eliminated via quantum mechanical interference, an effect known as electromagnetically induced transparency. Theoretical and experimental work has demonstrated that this phenomenon can be used to slow down <b>light</b> <b>pulses</b> dramatically, or even bring them to a complete halt.

25|$|If D is {{less than}} zero, the medium {{is said to have}} {{positive}} dispersion or normal dispersion. If D is greater than zero, the medium has negative dispersion. If a <b>light</b> <b>pulse</b> is propagated through a normally dispersive medium, the result is the higher frequency components slow down more than the lower frequency components. The pulse therefore becomes positively chirped, or up-chirped, increasing in frequency with time. This causes the spectrum coming out of a prism to appear with red light the least refracted and blue/violet light the most refracted. Conversely, if a pulse travels through an anomalously (negatively) dispersive medium, high frequency components travel faster than the lower ones, and the pulse becomes negatively chirped, or down-chirped, decreasing in frequency with time.|$|E

2500|$|Hau and her {{associates}} at Harvard University [...] "have demonstrated exquisite {{control over}} light and matter in several experiments, but her experiment with 2 condensates {{is one of}} the most compelling". In 2006 they successfully transferred a qubit from light to a matter wave and back into light, again using Bose–Einstein condensates. Details of the experiment are discussed in the February 8, 2007 publication of the journal Nature. The experiment relies on the way that, according to quantum mechanics, atoms may behave as waves as well as particles. This enables atoms to do some counterintuitive things, such as passing through two openings at once. Within a Bose–Einstein condensate a <b>light</b> <b>pulse</b> is compressed by a factor of 50million, without losing any of the information stored within it. In this Bose–Einstein condensate, information encoded in a <b>light</b> <b>pulse</b> can be transferred to the atom waves. Because all the atoms move coherently, the information does not dissolve into random noise. The light drives some of the cloud's roughly 1.8million sodium atoms to enter into [...] "quantum superposition" [...] states, with a lower-energy component that stays put and a higher-energy component that travels between the two clouds. A second 'control' laser then writes the shape of the pulse into the atom waves. When this control beam is turned off and the <b>light</b> <b>pulse</b> disappears, the 'matter copy' remains. Prior to this, researchers could not readily control optical information during its journey, except to amplify the signal to avoid fading. This experiment by Hau and her colleagues marked the first successful manipulation of coherent optical information. The new study is [...] "a beautiful demonstration", says Irina Novikova, a physicist at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, VA. Before this result, she says, light storage was measured in milliseconds. [...] "Here it's fractional seconds. It's a really dramatic time." ...|$|E

We observed a single-photon interference between temporally-separated two modes {{for both the}} converted and the unconverted <b>light</b> <b>pulses</b> at various values of the conversion efficiency. We observed interference visibilities greater than 0. 88 without suppressing the background noises for any value of the conversion efficiency the wavelength converter achieves.
