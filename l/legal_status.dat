5|$|Croatia {{was first}} {{subdivided}} into {{counties in the}} Middle Ages. Counties were first introduced in Croatia during the House of Trpimirović's rule. The exact number and borders of these early counties are difficult to determine accurately; they were considered to encompass areas subordinated to a single centre of local authority, but the possessions of significant nobles had a <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> separate from local authority.|$|E

5|$|Since April 1976, {{the policy}} has been that Lebanese {{citizens}} born in Jerusalem have their birthplace identified only by the city's name, with no national designation, due to the unresolved <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> of Jerusalem.

As of 2015, the counties are subdivided into 128 cities and 428 (mostly rural) municipalities.|$|E
5|$|Women {{have tended}} to be {{overlooked}} in Byzantine studies as Byzantine society left few records about them. Women were disadvantaged in some aspects of their <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> and in their access to education, and limited in their freedom of movement. The life of a Byzantine Greek woman could be divided into three phases: girlhood, motherhood, and widowhood.|$|E
5|$|After relegation from Scotland's top flight, East Stirlingshire was {{controversially}} {{merged with}} Clydebank Juniors in 1964. The new club was renamed East Stirlingshire Clydebank– often E.S. Clydebank for short– and relocated to Kilbowie Park in Clydebank against fans' wishes. However, the merge lasted only one season, with East Stirlingshire shareholders winning several court cases {{against it and}} thus the club reverted to its original <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> and moved back to Falkirk. During the single season as E.S. Clydebank, the club set a record attendance at Kilbowie Park when 14,900 spectators attended a Scottish Cup first round replay against Hibernian in February 1965.|$|E

5|$|Approximately 4,500 {{same-sex}} couples married in Spain {{during the first}} year of the law. Shortly after the law was passed, questions arose about the <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> of marriage to non-Spaniards whose country did not permit same-sex marriage. A ruling from the Justice Ministry stated that the country's same-sex marriage law allows a Spanish citizen to marry a non-Spaniard regardless of whether that person's homeland recognizes the partnership. At least one partner must be a Spanish citizen in order to marry, although two non-Spaniards may marry if they both have legal residence in Spain.|$|E
5|$|Augusta Raurica and Aventicum {{were also}} the civitates, or capitals, of the non-Roman tribes of the Rauraci and Helvetii, respectively. In that capacity, the magistrates of Aventicum, as duoviri coloniae Helvetiorum, also governed the entire Helvetic population, which had the <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> of incolae (inhabitants) {{invested}} with the Latin Right. The rights of the Roman coloni, or colonists, were represented by a special authority, the curatores colonorum Aventicensum ("Heads of the colonists of Aventicum"). Moreover, the Roman citizens of the entire territory established the cives Romani conventus Helvetici ("Association of Roman citizens in Helvetia").|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> as {{citizens}} {{and the degree to}} which they could become emancipated, women could own property, enter contracts, and engage in business, including shipping, manufacturing, and lending money. Inscriptions throughout the Empire honour women as benefactors in funding public works, an indication they could acquire and dispose of considerable fortunes; for instance, the Arch of the Sergii was funded by Salvia Postuma, a female member of the family honoured, and the largest building in the forum at Pompeii was funded by Eumachia, a priestess of Venus.|$|E
50|$|With {{the support}} of other Britons, these activists demanded that Blacks be freed from slavery.

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{considerable}} growth in legal research on the social economy over the last twenty years. The {{purpose of this article}} is to present some of the most important aspects of this work, referring to the key areas of research covered and future trends. We have grouped the subjects being researched according to their contribution towards establishing the <b>legal</b> <b>statuses</b> of businesses in the social economy, work on social economy enterprises within the constitutional framework, commentaries on the laws that regulate the different <b>legal</b> <b>statuses</b> of businesses in the social economy, establishing the responsibilities of the State and Autonomous Regions, studying the nature, purposes and characteristic features of social economy enterprises, and the key issues to be considered with regard to the legal system that governs them. Having analysed works published on such matters, we have outlined some possible ways of further developing the research that has been studied. An extensive bibliography is also included.

5|$|Canada is home {{to about}} 52,000–60,000 wolves, whose <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> varies {{according}} to province and territory. First Nations residents may hunt wolves without restriction, and some provinces require licenses for residents to hunt wolves while others do not. In Alberta, wolves on private land may be baited and hunted by the landowner without requiring a license, and in some areas, wolf hunting bounty programs exist. Large-scale wolf population control through poisoning, trapping and aerial hunting is also presently conducted by government-mandated programs {{in order to support}} populations of endangered prey species such as woodland caribou.|$|E
5|$|During 1895, Robert S. Hatcher, {{the reading}} clerk of the Indiana Senate, was {{directed}} to ascertain the <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> of {{the design of the}} state seal. After a thorough review, Hatcher found that the laws that authorized the seal did not explicitly state what its design should be. He recommended that a bill be passed to standardize the seal. Senator McCord submitted legislation for that purpose, but no action was taken on it.|$|E
5|$|In August 2007, a U.S. {{federal judge}} {{approved}} the French government's request to extradite Noriega to France after his release. Noriega appealed his extradition because he claimed France would not honor his <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> {{as a prisoner}} of war.

5|$|In the 19th {{century the}} French word kilo, a {{shortening}} of kilogramme, was imported into the English language {{where it has}} been used to mean both kilogram and kilometre. While kilo is acceptable in many generalist texts, for example The Economist, its use is typically considered inappropriate in certain applications including scientific, technical and legal writing, where authors should adhere strictly to SI nomenclature. When the United States Congress gave the metric system <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> in 1866, it permitted {{the use of the word}} kilo as an alternative to the word kilogram, but in 1990 revoked the status of the word kilo.|$|E
5|$|Many {{courts have}} {{declined}} to assess the religious status of Scientology, finding that the question was irrelevant to deciding the case at hand. The Federal Administrative Court for example ruled in 1997 that the question whether or not Scientology was a religion was irrelevant, and that its <b>legal</b> <b>status</b> should be judged by its business activities. The German government does not consider the Church of Scientology to be a religious or worldview community and asserts that Scientology is a profit-making enterprise, rather than a religion.|$|E
5|$|Overall, anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that temazepam {{may be the most}} psychologically habit-forming (addictive) benzodiazepine. Temazepam abuse reached epidemic proportions {{in some parts of the}} world, in particular, in Europe and Australia, and is a major drug of abuse in many Southeast Asian countries. This led authorities of various countries to place temazepam under a more restrictive <b>legal</b> <b>status.</b> Some countries, such as Sweden, banned the drug outright. Temazepam also has certain pharmacokinetic properties of absorption, distribution, elimination, and clearance that make it more apt to abuse compared to many other benzodiazepines.|$|E

Compared to married female brewsters, non-married brewsters brewed ale less frequently and with less consistency over time. They also earned less than a married woman operating in a married household or in business with her husband.|$|R
30|$|The {{straightforward}} {{confirmation of}} the territorial confinement hypothesis is the first important result (see Fig.  3, col. A). The results unambiguously show that Senegalese migrants with a fully irregular status are {{significantly less likely to}} make short returns to the homeland.

As expected, migrants are at the mercy of state immigration-control mechanisms for their ability to make trips back to the homeland.|$|R
