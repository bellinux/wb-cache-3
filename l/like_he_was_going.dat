5|$|Blacklock, still unnamed, had {{his first}} race as a three-year-old in the St. Leger Stakes at Doncaster on Monday 22 September. He did not arrive at Doncaster until the Saturday before, and after reports that he was amiss his odds had {{lengthened}} {{to as much as}} 10/1 in the betting. After arriving, he had a gallop in the afternoon and soon shortened in the betting. After another of the pre-race favourites, Stainborough, was withdrawn due to illness Blacklock was sent off as the short-priced favourite at about evens. Blacklock appeared <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to win easily and Jackson eased him up in the final furlong (200 metres) of the race. However, Ebor and Restless began to quickly close down his lead. By the time Jackson realised, Blacklock could not accelerate quick enough and Ebor came out on top, beating Blacklock by a neck. Restless finished in third place and was the only other runner that could be placed by the judge. Blacklock had a crack in one of his hind heels, which was thought to have affected him in the race.|$|E
25|$|After Liu Bei {{had retreated}} to Baidicheng, Xu Sheng, Pan Zhang, Song Qian and other Wu generals {{suggested}} to attack Baidicheng and capture Liu Bei. When Sun Quan asked Lu Xun for his opinion, Lu, along with Zhu Ran and Luo Tong, {{said that when}} Cao Pi amassed his forces and seemed <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to help Wu attack Shu, he was actually harbouring sinister intentions, so they should be cautious, abandon their pursuit of Liu Bei, and return to Wu. Not long later, Cao Pi led the Wei armies to invade Wu from three directions.|$|E
500|$|... "We {{were under}} the impression– he looked <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> down, but we didn't hear any {{mechanical}} difficulty. We couldn't figure out why an American Airlines plane would be so low in downtown Manhattan. We sort of expected him to veer off {{and go into the}} Hudson. But he just rose a little bit, his altitude, leveled off, and he was headed straight for the Trade Center. So just before he got to the Trade Center, it seemed as though he gained power. We were just watching this airplane on target for the World Trade Center. All of a sudden, boom! He disappears into the Trade Center." ...|$|E
50|$|No {{stranger}} to the local music scene, he has acted as a sound assistance at many of the local clubs where he has also performed. He can also often be seen wandering downtown Iowa City in the pedestrian mall, library, bookstores and other places where he introduces himself in his shy manner; even while often flamboyantly dressed <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to a Black Sabbath show at a renaissance festival.|$|R

6000|$|... 'But where's Miss Phoebe?' asked Sir John, who had sat {{half an hour}} {{waiting in}} vain for her to appear; and when he heard, he {{declared}} his intention of calling on her. And where <b>was</b> Mervyn himself? <b>He</b> <b>was</b> at the office, whither Robert offered to conduct the Baronet, and where Mervyn heard more of his proposal than he had bargained for; though, perhaps, not more than <b>he</b> <b>liked.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to an evening party at the Bannermans', and seeing Sir John's inclination to see Phoebe, proposed to call for him and take him there.|$|R
500|$|The next match pitted Bam Bam Bigelow, Bastion Booger and The Headshrinkers (accompanied by Luna Vachon and Afa) {{against a}} team calling {{themselves}} the Four Doinks. After Bigelow's team was introduced, Doink the Clown's theme song began to play, but immediately {{switched to the}} theme of The Bushwhackers and Howard Finkel introduced the pair as Luke Doink and Butch Doink as they came down wearing clown wigs, with Luke riding a scooter and Butch pulling a wagon. As the fans waited to see who would be the other two Doinks, the intro to Doink's theme played again and the two Doinks were joined by Mabel Doink and Mo Doink with their rapping manager Oscar Doink; as they came to the ring they were referred to by Bobby Heenan as [...] "Doinks on a Mission". Headshrinker Samu was eliminated first after he bit several of the balloons being carried by his opponents. He was purposely offered one more balloon by the Doinks, which he willfully bit into. Samu was stunned to find out that the balloon was full of water, which caused him to stumble back in surprise and Luke rolled him up and pinned him. Later, Booger has a chance to pin Luke after he hit the Trip to the Batcave on him. However, Booger got off of Luke and went to the corner where Headshrinker Fatu offered him a banana. As Booger was looking to perform the move again, his teammates dragged him away and Booger landed on his knees. Luke and Butch performed their trademark battering ram on Booger. Mabel then executed a leg drop on Booger and pinned him. Down four wrestlers to two, Bigelow's team appeared to be making a comeback when Fatu began taking down his opponents with the carcass of a turkey that Afa had been eating from the entire match. He then performed a top rope splash onto Mo. Fatu got distracted, however, and examined a banana peel with curiosity. Butch entered the ring with a bucket and faked out Fatu by making <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to toss the contents of the bucket onto him. This resulted in Fatu slipping on the banana peel, and Butch pinned him to eliminate him from the match. Left by himself, Bigelow began brutally atracking three of the Doinks and seemed to get the upper hand when Mabel entered the ring and Bigelow was unable to do much to him. Meanwhile, Butch dumped a bucket of confetti all over Luna, which caused Bigelow to become momentarily distracted and Mabel and Mo sandwiched him in the corner. Bigelow fell, Mabel performed a splash on him, and the referee counted the pin as the other three Doinks piled on. After the match, the real Doink the Clown appeared on the video screen to taunt Bigelow.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} Jannetty's 1996 departure, Michaels became a born-again Christian in real life. This helped the two to patch up their above mentioned off-screen differences {{once and for all}} when Michaels shared his faith and aided Jannetty in becoming a Christian. On the SmackDown! shown on March 10, 2005 (taped two days earlier) Kurt Angle announced that as part of his preparation for his WrestleMania 21 match against Michaels he would face Michaels old partner Jannetty on the following SmackDown. The following Monday (March 14, 2005) Jannetty made a surprise appearance on WWE Raw and, for one night, The Rockers reunited to take on La Résistance (Sylvain Grenier and Rob Conway). Jannetty got the win with the [...] "Rocker Dropper" [...] after Michaels hit ”Sweet Chin Music” on Grenier. Three days later on SmackDown Angle had promised to make Jannetty ”tap out”, just <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to make Michaels tap out at WrestleMania 21. On the night Angle made good on his promise and forced Jannetty to submit to his ankle lock submission hold, but only after a nearly twenty-minute match and an impressive showing for Jannetty which saw him nearly pin the Olympic champion. After two good showings on Raw and SmackDown to convince WWE that he was still a very talented performer, they signed him to a contract. Due to a domestic incident, Jannetty was arrested and thus unable to meet the commitments of his WWE contract, which led to him being released from his contract by July 6, 2005.|$|E

Sarah angers him by pushing him into a table, injuring him. Lee pushes her, looking <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to rape her and then Gail's son David kicks open the door and saves her from him. Sarah then goes into hospital leaving her newborn baby Harry with Gail's daughter in-law, Kylie.|$|R

However, Ned never {{made it into the}} show so the creator kept the idea until he developed Pushing Daisies.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't care two straws about Deronda, or {{any other}} {{conceited}} hanger-on. You may talk to {{him as much as}} you <b>like.</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> not <b>going</b> to take my place. You are my wife. And you will either fill your place properly--to the world and to me--or you will go to the devil." ...|$|R
6000|$|He stopped then, {{and studied}} a minute--laying for an [...] "effect"--I knowed it {{perfectly}} well. Then {{he turned off}} <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to leave the platform, and says, kind of lazy and indifferent: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure," [...] he answered. [...] "Griffiths lay at Savo last night, {{taking on}} pigs and yams and filling his water-tanks. Looked <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{for a long}} cruise, but he said no. Why? Did {{you want to see}} him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Grinder had {{a terrible}} row {{with more than a}} dozen of the boys, who sided with what you had done.

60|$|Now {{then for}} a wonder as they came out.

5000|$|Bland {{recorded}} [...] "I Pity the Fool" [...] {{during the}} second session for his album Two Steps from the Blues. [...] Overseeing the November 12, 1960, session in Chicago was band leader and arranger Joe Scott. [...] He used a six-piece horn section with twin trumpets. [...] Wayne Bennett's contrasting lead guitar along with the horn arrangement are key elements of the song. [...] Music writer Chris O'Leary describes Bland's vocal: Bland opened with dismissive coolness, taking his time on the descending title phrase... {{but this is just}} bluster: when the song moved to its bridge, Bland howled. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> still entwined with her and the shame of it is killing him. [...] Blues historian David Evans calls Bland, [...] "the picture of utter humiliation in this frightening outburst, sounding <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to do harm to himself or someone else. This is powerful soul blues at its emotional best." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the time}} {{leading up to}} his arrest, Le Roux is {{described}} as a megalomaniac whose appetite exceeded his caution on one hand, while on the other hand taking care of crucial details, such as fathering a child in Brazil in order to avoid extradition. DEA agents have stated that on the wiretaps, Le Roux gave the impression that “he felt <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not <b>going</b> to get away forever.” ...|$|R
6000|$|After we {{got around}} the hill, I found a trail, {{and we went}} much faster. Charley didn't have any more signs of fits, and began {{laughing}} and talking about gold mines. The trouble was with little Albert. He was {{almost as big as}} me. You see, all the time I'd been calling him little Albert, he'd been growing up. He was so heavy I couldn't keep up with Joe and Charley. I was all out of breath. So I told them they'd have to take turns in carrying him, which they said they wouldn't. Then I said I'd leave them and they'd get lost, and the mountain lions and bears would eat them. Charley looked <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to have a fit right there, and Joe said, [...] "Give him to me." [...] And after that we carried him in turn.|$|E

50|$|Several {{women in}} the show head for the runway, {{including}} the director who forbids Crazy Loop to enter. With no one around, Crazy Loop tries on a suit {{and a pair of}} sunglasses, walks to the runway and dances in front of the {{women in the}} show. The bored audience then wakes up and stare at him. The director is angry at Crazy Loop and glares at him, even trying to get a woman to kick Crazy Loop out of the show (which goes unsuccessfully). A VIP comes and watches Crazy Loop. At first it appears <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to give a thumbs down, causing the director to panic; however, the VIP ends up giving the thumbs up. The fashion show turns crazy (like Crazy Loop), and all the people in the show (including the director) try on crazy outfits (one involving the pizza Crazy Loop delivered). The audience eats the pizza the director earlier rejected. The director then offers Crazy Loop a popcorn basket, and Crazy Loop throws it in the air. With pizza being eaten, popcorn in the air, and guests happy and content, the fashion show is featured on the cover of magazines as a huge success.|$|R
60|$|Evelyn found {{something}} pathetic in his answer.

His enjoyment was essentially natural; her friends' {{enthusiasm for the}} amusements Mrs. Willans got up was artificial and forced. They had too much, and her father not enough.|$|R

50|$|A {{few months}} later, Walt learns that Skyler {{works as a}} taxi {{dispatcher}} and is using her maiden name; no court date has been set. Skyler and her children have {{moved out of the}} house, which is now abandoned. After Walt is sighted in Albuquerque, Marie calls her sister to warn her. But Walt is already at the home and has a long talk with Skyler, who is still angry at him but did not disclose <b>he</b> <b>was</b> there to Marie and makes no moves to contact law enforcement. Skyler figures out that Walt plans a suicide mission against the people who killed Hank and lets him imply this without stating it, and when she thinks Walt <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to give her his remaining drug money (which he actually forced the Schwartzes to launder for him) she tells him she and Flynn made it clear they don't want it. When Walt seems <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to use her and their kids as an excuse one more time for his actions, Skyler gets angry, but she is left stunned and silent when Walt admits that he entered the drug business for himself rather than his family, and then he gives her a lottery ticket with the coordinates of the makeshift grave in which Hank is buried to use as leverage for striking a deal with the prosecutors. Skyler then allows Walt to see Holly one last time before he leaves forever.|$|R
5000|$|Soon after, Zorx, Klax and Jennifer {{come into}} Mr. Krupp's office very badly {{disguised}} as humans and {{apply for the}} vacant cafeteria job. Not suspecting anything, Mr. Krupp hires the three. As punishment for their antics, {{despite the fact that}} he still doesn't have any proof and that they did not mean for such a large batch to be mixed, Mr. Krupp takes away George and Harold's cafeteria food privileges and forces them to eat their lunch in Mr. Krupp's office from then on. ( [...] It is unknown if Mr. Krupp checks their homework because he overhears them talking about not doing it.) The next day George and Harold enter Mr. Krupp's office to eat their packed lunches, unlike Mr. Krupp who had a banana as a healthy thing in his lunch, both boys had their own weird sandwiches with George's being a peanut butter and gummy worm sandwich and Harold's being a tuna salad with chocolate chips and miniature marshmallows sandwich they then trade half of each other's sandwiches so the two end up with a bit of both of their sandwiches. But they didn't stop there, next they were eating crisps in which they were dipping into whipped cream topped with chocolate sprinkles and for their pudding George mentions that they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to eat hard boiled eggs which they can dip into hot fudge and Skittles, the thought of this makes Mr. Krupp feel <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> sick and exits his office for some fresh air before witnessing the boy's pudding.|$|R
