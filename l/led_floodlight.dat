50|$|VfL Wolfsburg {{also became}} the first Bundesliga club to play in an LED-lit stadium when the Volkswagen Arena was {{equipped}} with a new <b>LED</b> <b>floodlight</b> system {{at the start of}} 2017. The old floodlighting of the Volkswagen Arena consists of more than 170 elements with lamps, each weighing about 35 kilos. They were all mounted under the roof and together produce about 1,500 lux. The 84 speakers in the stadium, which weigh 120 kilos each and are likewise mounted under the roof, produce a total of 600 watts. There are also two video walls covering an area of 53 square metres in the stadium. The pitch is covered in hybrid grass, which is natural grass that is reinforced with synthetic fibres, thus improving its weatherability. The Volkswagen Arena was the first Bundesliga stadium to introduce such a system. From the outset, the pitch has been heated so that matches can be played regardless of ice and snow.|$|E
40|$|Overheating of the {{high-power}} {{light emitting}} diode (LED) has a dramatic effect on the chip’s lifetime. Heat dissipation for high-power LED is becoming a major challenge for researchers and technicians. Compared with the air cooling method, the liquid cooling method has many advantages and high efficiency because of higher specific heat capacity, density, and thermal conductivity. Carbon nanotubes with remarkable thermal properties {{have been used as}} additives in liquids to increase the thermal conductivity. In this work, multiwalled carbon nanotubes nanofluid (MWCNTs nanofluid) was used to enhance heat dissipation for 450 [*]W <b>LED</b> <b>floodlight.</b> MWCNTs nanofluid was made by dispersing the OH functionalized MWCNTs in ethylene glycol/water solution. The concentration of MWCNTs in fluid was in the range between 0. 1 and 1. 3 gram/liter. The experimental results showed that the saturated temperature of 450 [*]W LED chip was 55 °C when using water/ethylene glycol solution in liquid cooling system. In the case of using MWCNTs nanofluid with 1. 2 gram/liter of MWCNTs’ concentration, the saturated temperature of LED chip was 50. 6 °C. The results have confirmed the advantages of the MWCNTs for heat dissipation systems for high-power <b>LED</b> <b>floodlight</b> and other high power electronic devices...|$|E
40|$|The {{indicators}} of power consumption of lighting devices based on LEDs are studied {{depending on the}} supplied voltage. For the lamp and floodlight with LEDs active and reactive power, current and power factor {{as a function of}} voltage (which value changed in the range 200 – 245 V) were experimentally determined. The analysis of experimental data demonstrated that due to the drivers in the specified voltage range the active power consumed by light devices remains practically unchanged. The reactive power of LED devices depends on the supplied voltage and is capacitive in its nature. In contrast with gas-discharge light sources the LED devices under study do not consume reactive power, but generate it. With the change of the supplied voltage from 200 to 245 V the value of the generated reactive power increases to 60 % for the floodlight and 50 % for the lamp. The <b>LED</b> <b>floodlight</b> has a low coefficient of active power. The current consumed by the floodlight has increased by 22 %, and by the lamp – by 13 %. The formulas for determining the maximum value of the length of the calculated section of single-phase group lines were developed, taking into account specific source data. LED light sources tend to feed by electric power by single-phase group lines. The number of lamps connected to single-phase lines is regulated by normative documents. Bearing this in mind as well as the small power of LED sources single-phase group lines are usually performed with conductors of the smallest possible cross section. The limit values of the length of the calculated section that correspond to a predetermined loss of voltage in line with ambient temperature from 15 to  60  °С were determined for them.  The calculations demonstrated that for group lines that feed the LEDs, the choice of conductor cross-sections in accordance with permissible voltage loss is not critical.  The determinant factor for the choice of the cross-section of the conductors of group electrical networks is the calculation of acceptable heat with respect to temperature of the environment. </p...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} propose a techno-economic {{comparative}} analysis between different lighting solutions, using, respectively, floodlight with metal halide lamps, luminaires with fluorescent lamps and <b>LED</b> <b>floodlights.</b> The comparison is aimed to identify general criteria {{for assessing the}} techno-economic sustainability {{of the use of}} LED lighting for indoor sports facilities, since this solution is very often proposed to achieve a reduction of the electrical power for lighting. From a technical standpoint, the analysis takes into particular consideration the aspects related to the satisfaction of lighting requirements, safety and energy efficiency. From an economic standpoint the investment, the operating and the maintenance costs are evaluated. To make comparisons on an economic basis, specific indicators are used. From the obtained results it is possible to highlight as the solution that uses the <b>LED</b> <b>floodlights</b> is characterized by highest energy efficiency. This solution requires a smaller number of luminaires and it has limited maintenance costs compared to the other solutions, but it has high investment costs, which involve reasonable payback times only when the sports facility is used intensively and for competitions of high level...|$|R
50|$|The {{first game}} under {{floodlights}} at Vicarage Road was played in 1953, when lights were installed {{on top of}} the Main Stand. These were replaced in 1960, with four pylons being built in the corners of the ground. Currently the floodlights are mounted {{on the top of the}} Vicarage Road and Rookery Stands. New <b>LED</b> <b>floodlights</b> have been added for the 2015/16 season including lights on the top of the Sir Elton John and Graham Taylor stands.|$|R

40|$|Tachistoscopic {{presentation}} of scenes has been valuable {{for studying the}} emerging properties of visual scene representations. The spatial aspects of this work have generally {{been focused on the}} conceptual locations (e. g., next to the refrigerator) and directional locations of objects in 2 -D arrays and/or images. Less is known about how the perceived egocentric distance of objects develops. Here we describe a novel system for presenting brief glimpses of a real-world environment, followed by a mask. The system includes projectors with mechanical shutters for projecting the fixation and masking images, a set of <b>LED</b> <b>floodlights</b> for illuminating the environment, and computer-controlled electronics to set the timing and initiate the process. Because a real environment is used, most visual distance and depth cues can be manipulated using traditional methods. The system is inexpensive, robust, and its components are readily available in the marketplace. This article describes the system and the timing characteristics of each component.
