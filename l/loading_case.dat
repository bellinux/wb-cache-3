40|$|This paper derives a closed-form {{solution}} for the stress distributions in an infinite plane loaded by a rivet of a different material under either plane stress or plane strain condition. A distinctive feature of the present analysis is that the rivet load is modelled by distributed body forces over {{the section of the}} rivet, in contrast to the commonly-used assumption of a concentrated load acting at the centre of the rivet. Two body force potentials are introduced to model the cases of conservative, uniform distributed force (<b>Loading</b> <b>Case</b> I) and non-conservative, non-uniform distributed force (<b>Loading</b> <b>Case</b> II), which is similar to those caused by shear force on a circular section. Our results show that the normal contact stress decreases with both the stiffness ratio ζ = μ 2 /μ 1 (μ 1 and μ 2 are the shear moduli for the plane and rivet, respectively) and the frictional coefficient μ between the plane and rivet; conversely, the shear contact stress increases with both μ and ζ. The normal contact stress for <b>Loading</b> <b>Case</b> I is larger than that for <b>Loading</b> <b>Case</b> II, while the opposite conclusion applies to the shear contact stress; their differences are more apparent for larger ζ. Larger values of ζ and μ result in higher maximum hoop stress and the corresponding location of maximum hoop stress deviates farther from the edge of contact zone; and the maximum hoop stress resulted from <b>Loading</b> <b>Case</b> II is larger than that induced by <b>Loading</b> <b>Case</b> I. The hoop stress at the rivet hole agrees well with experimental results by Coker and Filon [Coker, E. G. and Filon, L. N. G. (1931).

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the parametric study on fatigue failure using crack initiation method analysis. In order {{to investigate the}} fatigue failure of AISI/SAE 1045 steel by varying the microstrain parameters under different loading cases and predict the crack initiation life, compact tension specimen model is used for this project. The finite element linear static analysis is done by using MSC Patran 2010 and MSC Nastran 2007 to determine {{the result of the}} stress distribution on the model. The fatigue analysis is conducted by using ANSYS 13. 0 nCode Design Life to determine the microstrain value that initiates the dynamic and static failure under three loading cases; compression-compression, compression-tension and tension-tension. The obtained microstrain values are then used to obtain the fatigue damage, D which is then used to predict the crack initiation life of the material. Using Palmgren-Milner rule, the value of D will obtain the crack initiation life cycle of the material, Nf. Based on the result, it has found that the most critical <b>loading</b> <b>case</b> for the fatigue and static failure are the tension-tension. The crack initiation life of the material is at high cycle fatigue, and able to stand about 5 × 106 cycles without failure for every <b>loading</b> <b>case.</b> Meanwhile the static failure analysis has found that there is no crack initiation life, as it has failed at very low cycle in every <b>loading</b> <b>case...</b>|$|E
