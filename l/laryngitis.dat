5|$|It is Thanksgiving and Lisa assembles a {{decorative}} centerpiece for the dinner table. Meanwhile, Homer leaves {{to pick up}} Grampa from the retirement home once Patty and Selma arrive, bearing food (Swedish meatballs), and to Marge's consternation they insinuate that they find Marge's turkeys are dry and inedible. Their mother Jaqueline Bouvier arrives in a taxi, suffering from <b>laryngitis,</b> and tells Marge she never does anything right.|$|E
5|$|Dark Horse is {{the fifth}} studio album by English rock {{musician}} George Harrison, released on Apple Records in December 1974 as the follow-up to Living in the Material World. Although keenly anticipated on release, Dark Horse {{is associated with the}} controversial North American tour that Harrison staged with Indian classical musician Ravi Shankar in November and December that year. This was the first US tour {{by a member of the}} Beatles since 1966, and the public's nostalgia for the band, together with Harrison contracting <b>laryngitis</b> during rehearsals and choosing to feature Shankar so heavily in the program, resulted in scathing concert reviews from some influential music critics.|$|E
5|$|Medicinal {{properties}} {{have been}} ascribed to Phallus indusiatus {{from the time}} of the Chinese Tang Dynasty when it was described in pharmacopoeia. The fungus was used to treat many inflammatory, stomach, and neural diseases. Southern China's Miao people continue to use it traditionally for a number of afflictions, including injuries and pains, cough, dysentery, enteritis, leukemia, and feebleness, and it has been prescribed clinically as a treatment for <b>laryngitis,</b> leucorrhea, fever, and oliguria (low urine output), diarrhea, hypertension, cough, hyperlipidemia, and in anticancer therapy. Modern science has probed the biochemical basis of these putative medicinal benefits.|$|E
5|$|The film {{included}} several technical errors. Cut-out cardboard pieces {{were used to}} depict military aircraft during battle scenes in the film, and one film critic said viewers were almost {{able to identify the}} threads attached to the cardboard cut-outs. Footage of a digital watch was spliced into the film, though this technology would not be invented for twenty-five years after the film's time period. There were other problems. Jacqueline Bisset developed <b>laryngitis</b> during the film's production. A set-piece for the film included a re-created version of a lighthouse at Incheon, but this was obliterated by a typhoon. The death of David Janssen during production called for extensive reshoots.|$|E
5|$|Sajak and White have starred on the {{syndicated}} version continuously as host and hostess, respectively, since it began, except for very limited occasions. During {{two weeks in}} January 1991, Tricia Gist, the girlfriend and future wife of Griffin's son Tony, filled in for White {{when she and her}} new husband, restaurateur George San Pietro, were honeymooning. Gist returned for the week of episodes airing March 11 through 15, 1991, because White had a cold at the time of taping. On an episode in November 1996, when Sajak proved unable to host the bonus round segment because of <b>laryngitis,</b> he and White traded places for that segment. On the March 4, 1997 episode, Rosie O'Donnell co-hosted the third round with White after O'Donnell's name was used in a puzzle.|$|E
5|$|That night, as Sunnydale sleeps, white wisps float {{from each}} person's mouth to a belfry, where they {{settle in the}} box from Buffy's dream as ghoulish {{skeletal}} figures, with metal-toothed grins and impeccable black suits, look on. In the morning, Buffy and Willow discover {{they are unable to}} speak and become visibly distressed; they soon discover that everybody is unable to speak. The group gathers at Giles' where they see that the news is reporting that Sunnydale is suffering from an epidemic of <b>laryngitis.</b> Buffy and Riley, each concerned that chaos will ensue, find each other attempting to keep order on the streets. For the first time, Buffy sees Riley in his paramilitary role as an agent of The Initiative; he in turn is unaware that she is the Slayer. They exchange a look and then their first kiss, before parting to continue their efforts.|$|E
5|$|In September, Ferreira starred as Kaycee in the {{independent}} film The Green Inferno. In the early morning of September 14, she and her boyfriend, DIIV frontman Zachary Cole Smith, were arrested at a traffic stop in Saugerties, New York for drug possession. Ferreira, who was in possession of ecstasy tablets, was arrested on drug possession and resisting arrest; Smith was in possession of heroin. She bailed herself out. In October, Ferreira cancelled the final week of her tour with Vampire Weekend after sustaining a hemorrhage to her vocal cords, which she later added {{was caused by a}} vocal node that was repeatedly misdiagnosed as <b>laryngitis.</b> In November, Ferreira and Icona Pop were announced as the opening acts for Miley Cyrus' Bangerz Tour, which began on February 14, 2014. Later that month, she released her third extended play, Night Time, My Time: B-Sides Part 1. In December, Ferreira was announced as the spokeswoman for hair care brand Redken.|$|E
5|$|In early 1976, Brynner {{received}} {{an offer from}} impresarios Lee Gruber and Shelly Gross to star, in the role that he had created 25 years before, in a U.S. national tour and Broadway revival. The tour opened in Los Angeles on July 26, 1976, with Constance Towers reprising the role of Anna. On opening night, Brynner suffered so badly from <b>laryngitis</b> that he lip-synched, with his son Rock singing and speaking the role from the orchestra pit. The production traveled across the United States, selling out every city it appeared in and finally opening in New York at the Uris Theatre (today the Gershwin Theatre) on May 2, 1977. The production featured Martin Vidnovic as Lun Tha, and Susan Kikuchi danced the part of Eliza, recreating the role that her mother, Yuriko, had originated. Yuriko both directed the production and recreated the Robbins choreography. Sharaff again designed costumes, and Michael Kermoyan reprised {{the role of the}} Kralahome, while June Angela was Tuptim. The run lasted 696performances, almost two years, during which each of the stars took off three weeks, with Angela Lansbury replacing Towers and Kermoyan replacing Brynner. The production was nominated for the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Musical.|$|E

25|$|On June 21, 1927, Brătianu {{returned}} with his fifth and final cabinet. He died in Bucharest, from complications of <b>laryngitis,</b> {{and was replaced}} as Prime Minister by his brother Vintilă Brătianu until the calling of elections.|$|E
25|$|GERD {{has been}} linked to a variety of {{respiratory}} and laryngeal complaints such as <b>laryngitis,</b> chronic cough, pulmonary fibrosis, earache, and asthma, even when not clinically apparent. These atypical manifestations of GERD are commonly referred to as laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) or as extraesophageal reflux disease (EERD).|$|E
25|$|Kiki: A spunky, tomboyish {{girl who}} often {{makes fun of}} others. Many of her stories involve plots where the danger of {{carelessness}} or deceitfulness, {{as well as the}} danger of the past repeating itself. Also notable is {{that a large number of}} the characters in her stories are also of African descent, though the trend dies off later on in the series. One story she came up with had to be read by Gary due to her suffering from <b>laryngitis</b> at the time.|$|E
25|$|In folk medicine, tea {{has been}} brewed from the leaves {{which has been}} used to treat asthma, {{persistent}} coughing, <b>laryngitis,</b> mouth ulcers, and venereal disease.

The latex {{has been used to}}pically to treat calluses, ear ache, insect stings, ringworm, skin cancer, toothache, umbilical hernias, and warts. None of these uses has been scientifically verified as effective. In the West Indies, a few drops of the latex is added to milk and used as an emetic.|$|E
25|$|Funeral For a Friend {{closed the}} promotional jaunt for Hours in the Summer of 2006, {{with a series}} of UK shows rescheduled from February. Most of the {{original}} dates had been cancelled because Matt Davies had suffered from a bout of <b>laryngitis.</b> Several other shows were scheduled in the UK to complement these rescheduled dates, and the tour culminated in a slot below headliners Guns N' Roses at the Download Festival at Donington Park. The rest of 2006 was spent writing and recording the band's third album.|$|E
25|$|Born in Lakewood, Ohio, Bampton {{grew up in}} Buffalo, New York. She entered Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa {{where she}} {{initially}} began training as a soprano but was redirected by her voice teacher into the mezzo-soprano repertoire after a serious bout of <b>laryngitis.</b> Shortly after graduating with a bachelor's degree, Bampton made her professional opera debut as Siebel in Gounod's Faust at the Chautauqua Opera in 1929. Her performance was positively received and she was invited to perform at the Worcester Music Festival in Worcester, Massachusetts that summer.|$|E
25|$|In 1900, Cayce {{formed a}} {{business}} partnership {{with his father}} to sell Woodmen of the World Insurance; however, in March {{he was struck by}} severe <b>laryngitis</b> that resulted in a complete loss of speech. Unable to work, he lived at home with his parents for almost a year. He then decided to take up the trade of photography, an occupation that would exert less strain on his voice. He began an apprenticeship at the photography studio of W. R. Bowles in Hopkinsville, and eventually became quite talented in his trade.|$|E
25|$|A few {{shows were}} {{cancelled}} initially as vocalist Gary Lightbody's voice had worn out. He had been advised by his doctor {{to take a}} week's rest before the tour as he had developed <b>laryngitis</b> (polyps on vocal cords), but he preferred not to because of the pre-booked tour. Tests later showed that Lightbody's voice had not healed at all, {{he had lost his}} top range, and the band was forced to cancel all remaining shows. The initially cancelled shows were re-scheduled {{to the end of the}} tour. Lightbody credited the band's agent and managers for their quick work.|$|E
25|$|<b>Laryngitis</b> {{prevented}} Scully from calling Game 2 of the 1989 National League Championship Series {{between the}} San Francisco Giants and Chicago Cubs. Bob Costas, {{who was working}} the American League Championship Series between Oakland and Toronto with Tony Kubek for NBC, was flown from Toronto to Chicago to fill in that evening (an off day for the ALCS). The final Major League Baseball game that Scully called for NBC was Game 5 of the 1989 NLCS on October 9. There, the Giants led by first baseman Will Clark clinched their first National League pennant since 1962.|$|E
25|$|For 1993, CBS made a {{broadcast}} booth change by removing Dick Stockton from {{his role as}} secondary play-by-play announcer after three seasons, and replacing him with Greg Gumbel. As previously mentioned, also during the 1993 season, Andrea Joyce replaced Gumbel as studio host. Joyce would be joined at the anchor desk by Pat O'Brien. At the 1993 World Series, {{she became the first}} woman to co-host the network television coverage for a World Series. Sean McDonough filled in for O'Brien, who was suffering from <b>laryngitis,</b> as the pregame host for Game 6 of the 1993 National League Championship Series.|$|E
25|$|Vin Scully {{was unable}} to call Game 2 of the 1989 National League Championship Series (on Wednesday, October 4) because he was {{suffering}} from <b>laryngitis.</b> As a result, secondary play-by-play announcer Bob Costas filled in for him. Around the same time, Costas was assigned to call the American League Championship Series between Oakland and Toronto. Game 2 of the NLCS occurred on Thursday, October 5, which was an off day for the ALCS. NBC then decided to fly Costas from Toronto to Chicago to substitute for Scully on Thursday night. Afterwards, Costas flew back to Toronto, where he resumed work on the ALCS the next night.|$|E
25|$|Ahead of the tour, drummer Jonny Quinn {{broke his}} arm in a snowboarding {{accident}} in the French Alps. The band had to cancel several of their shows before on the tour, when bassist Paul Wilson injured his arm and shoulder, and when vocalist Gary Lightbody developed <b>laryngitis</b> and lost his voice. Not wanting to cancel shows, the band recruited longtime friend Graham Hopkins to replace Quinn. Hopkins got one rehearsal to learn his drum parts before the tour dates began. Quinn was expected to return for the Australian Tour, but however his injuries healed {{in time for the}} US tour which started late February 2007.|$|E

25|$|Watteau alarmed {{his friends}} by a {{carelessness}} {{about his future}} and financial security, as if foreseeing he would not live for long. In fact he had been sickly and physically fragile since childhood. In 1720, he travelled to London, England, to consult Dr. Richard Mead, {{one of the most}} fashionable physicians of his time and an admirer of Watteau's work. However, London's damp and smoky air offset any benefits of Dr. Mead's wholesome food and medicines. Watteau returned to France and spent his last few months on the estate of his patron, Abbé Haranger, where he died in 1721, perhaps from tuberculous <b>laryngitis,</b> at the age of 36. The Abbé said Watteau was semi-conscious and mute during his final days, clutching a paint brush and painting imaginary paintings in the air.|$|E
25|$|Johnny Olson, the {{announcer}} for many Goodson-Todman shows of the era, was the program's original announcer {{until his death}} in October 1985. Olson was replaced by Rod Roddy in February 1986, who remained with the program until shortly before his death in October 2003. Los Angeles meteorologist Rich Fields took over as {{the announcer}} in April 2004 and stayed on until the end of season 38 in August 2010. Following a change of direction and a search for an announcer with more experience in improvisational comedy, veteran TV host George Gray was confirmed as the show's current announcer on the April 18, 2011 episode. After Olson's and Roddy's deaths in 1985 and 2003, respectively and Fields' departure in 2010, a number of announcers auditioned before a permanent replacement was hired. In addition to Roddy, Gene Wood, Rich Jeffries, and Bob Hilton auditioned to replace Olson. Former Family Feud announcer Burton Richardson, Paul Boland, and former Supermarket Sweep announcer Randy West substituted for Roddy during his illnesses. In addition to West and Richardson, Daniel Rosen, Art Sanders, Roger Rose, Don Bishop and current Wheel of Fortune announcer Jim Thornton also auditioned for the role eventually filled by Fields. Richardson substituted for Fields while he recovered from <b>laryngitis</b> in December 2006. In addition to Gray, TV host JD Roberto, comedians Jeff B. Davis, Brad Sherwood, and David H. Lawrence XVII, and actor/comedian Steve White also auditioned for the role.|$|E
500|$|Already {{suffering}} from <b>laryngitis,</b> Harrison overtaxed his voice during the weeks of combined recording and rehearsals in Los Angeles, and his hoarse singing would doom his subsequent concerts {{in the eyes}} of many observers. Alone among the tracks on Dark Horse, however, [...] "It Is 'He'" [...] contains a lead vocal that is relatively clean and free of the effects of <b>laryngitis.</b>|$|E
500|$|Described {{by author}} Robert Rodriguez as [...] "a Tom Waits croak", Harrison's singing on [...] "Simply Shady" [...] was {{affected}} by <b>laryngitis,</b> {{like many of the}} tracks on Dark Horse. He contracted this affliction through a combination of overwork and drug and alcohol abuse. The vocal parts were overdubbed either at FPSHOT or at A Studios, Los Angeles, late in October 1974, during the rush to complete the album while simultaneously rehearsing for the North American tour.|$|E
500|$|Harrison's overcommittal of {{his time}} to Dark Horse acts Ravi Shankar and Splinter during 1974 {{resulted}} in him having to rush-record much of Dark Horse while preparing for the North American tour. Due to the pressure, Harrison developed <b>laryngitis</b> during rehearsals and damaged his voice. As well as placing further importance on the instrumentals in his setlist, which included [...] "Hari's on Tour (Express)" [...] and Scott's track [...] "Tom Cat", Harrison's depleted vocals marred the concerts for many observers.|$|E
500|$|Already {{exhausted}} through overwork {{before arriving}} in Los Angeles, Harrison lost his voice {{early on in}} the rehearsals and contracted <b>laryngitis,</b> the results of which were obvious on the finished songs, particularly [...] "Dark Horse". Harrison and his tour band recorded the album's title track live on a sound stage at A in late October, with Norm Kinney engineering the session. Lon and Derrek Van Eaton, who, like Preston, were a former Apple Records act now signed with A Records, overdubbed backing vocals soon afterwards.|$|E
500|$|Harrison's vocals on {{the track}} were marred by his {{contracting}} <b>laryngitis</b> {{towards the end of}} the sessions for Dark Horse – a result of his having overextended himself on business and musical commitments, as well as his punishing lifestyle. Partly due to Harrison's hoarse singing, [...] "Simply Shady" [...] has been viewed in an unfavourable light by many music critics and reviewers. Other commentators consider its confessional tone to be significant in Harrison's career, representing a departure from the spiritual certainties that typically defined his work following the Beatles.|$|E
500|$|Harrison's {{workload}} {{ensured that}} he was rushing to finish Dark Horse in October 1974 before beginning his North American tour with Shankar on 2 November. Described by Leng as [...] "growled", Harrison's rough-sounding singing on [...] "Ding Dong" [...] shows {{the effects of a}} long-standing throat problem. Due to a combination of overexertion and abuse, this condition worsened, leading to him contracting <b>laryngitis</b> as he simultaneously completed his vocals for the album in Los Angeles and rehearsed for the tour. The female backing singers on the track remain uncredited.|$|E
500|$|Harrison's {{voice had}} fully {{recovered}} {{from the effects of}} <b>laryngitis,</b> allowing him to reach falsetto and indulge in gospel-style scat singing. In author Alan Clayson's estimation, with Harrison adopting a new, [...] "close-miked" [...] soft vocal style, much of Extra Texture reflected [...] "the more feathery emanations from Philadelphia by the likes of The Stylistics and Jerry Butler". Leng considers that Harrison [...] "was clearly targeting the mainstream U.S. audience" [...] and adds: [...] "There were few spiritual lyrics and absolutely no references to Krishna, while his much-criticized vocals were stronger, but recorded at a low level, as if the goal was to create a Harrison soul album for lovers." ...|$|E
500|$|The band's {{headline}} {{performance at}} Kerrang XXV, a one-off gig at Brixton Academy in London on 28 January 2006, was filmed {{for their first}} DVD, [...] During June 2007, Tuck suffered from <b>laryngitis,</b> which let to an emergency tonsillectomy in July. Bullet for My Valentine were forced to cancel several shows, including supporting Metallica for three dates on their Sick of the Studio '07 tour on 29 June in Bilbao, 5 July in Vienna, and 8 July at the recently completed Wembley Stadium in London. Unable to speak, Tuck wrote {{that as soon as}} doctors cleared him he would be in the studio working on the band's next album.|$|E
500|$|Harrison played [...] "Dark Horse" [...] {{throughout}} {{both the}} 1974 tour and his 1991 Japanese tour with Eric Clapton. A live version appears on his 1992 album Live in Japan. Recordings also exist of Harrison performing the song during {{radio and television}} appearances in the 1970s, although none of these versions are available on official releases. For {{the first time since}} the debut CD releases of Dark Horse and The Best of George Harrison in the early 1990s, [...] "Dark Horse" [...] was remastered in 2014, along with its parent album, as part of Harrison's Apple Years reissues. The latter release includes an acoustic demo of the song, which Harrison recorded in 1974 before the onset of <b>laryngitis.</b>|$|E
500|$|Harrison taped {{an early}} version of the song with Ringo Starr in 1973, {{intending}} to finish this recording for the album. The officially released version was recorded during rehearsals for his 1974 concerts, at a time when Harrison's exhaustion through overwork contributed to him contracting <b>laryngitis</b> and losing his voice. Harrison's singing was similarly affected throughout the ensuing tour. A number of music critics rate [...] "Dark Horse" [...] as one of Harrison's finest post-Beatles compositions and believe that the single would have achieved greater success with a cleaner vocal performance. The recording reflects Harrison's embracing of the jazz-funk musical genre, and features contributions from musicians such as Tom Scott, Jim Horn, Billy Preston, Willie Weeks and Andy Newmark.|$|E
