50|$|It {{is found}} in southwestern Colombia and northwestern Ecuador. Until 2016, it was {{considered}} a subspecies of the <b>Lesser</b> <b>Elaenia.</b> Its natural habitats are dry savanna, subtropical or tropical dry shrubland, subtropical or tropical seasonally wet or flooded lowland grassland, and heavily degraded former forest.|$|E
50|$|The white-crested elaenia easily is {{recognizable}} as an elaenia by {{the combination of}} drab plumage (primarily dull green above, and whitish below); wings with conspicuous wing bars (pale tips to the greater and median wing coverts); slightly crested appearance, with a semi-concealed white center to the crown; and upright posture. small-billed elaenia, <b>lesser</b> <b>elaenia</b> and sierran elaenia cannot always be distinguished in the field. Length in this species is 13.5-15 cm (5.3-6 in) and weight is 12.5-24.3 grams, {{with an average of}} 16.3 grams.|$|E
40|$|Tyrant-flycatchers (Tyrannidae) are a taxonomically {{confusing}} bird group {{containing a}} large degree of cryptic diversity that has only recently begun to be unraveled {{through the application of}} acoustic and molecular methods. We investigated all three subspecies of the <b>Lesser</b> <b>Elaenia,</b> Elaenia chiriquensis Lawrence, across their range using sound recordings as well as nuclear and mitochondrial markers. We show that two of the three subspecies, the nominate race from southern Central America and the widespread South American subspecies E. c. albivertex Pelzeln, have undergone very low levels of vocal and molecular differentiation across their fragmented range. In contrast, the isolated taxon E. c. brachyptera Berlepsch, endemic to the western and also, as recently shown, eastern slopes of the northern Andes, is phylogenetically and vocally distinct from other Lesser Elaenias, indicating that it constitutes a separate biological species...|$|E
