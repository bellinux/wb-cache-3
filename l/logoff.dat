5|$|The {{ability to}} change the Exit Windows, Windows <b>Logoff</b> and Windows Logon sounds was hidden in Version 1607, {{although}} these features can be enabled {{by going to the}} Windows Registry and under the EventLabels folder and setting the value to 0.|$|E
5000|$|HTTP user <b>logoff</b> with POST, GET+POST, or GET (cookies); POST <b>logoff</b> with {{configurable}} posted string (post-forms); ...|$|E
5000|$|Faster start-up, (due to {{improved}} Prefetch functions) logon, <b>logoff,</b> hibernation and application launch sequences.|$|E
50|$|Overflowing GDI {{capacity}} {{can affect}} Windows itself, preventing new windows from opening, menus from displaying, and alert boxes from appearing. The situation {{can be difficult}} to clear and can potentially require a forced hard-reset of the system, since it prevents core system programs from functioning. In Windows 8 and 8.1, forced <b>logoffs</b> occur as a result of GDI capacity overflow instead of a hard reboot.|$|R
50|$|Windows 2000 {{introduced}} Windows Script Host 2.0 {{which included}} an expanded object model {{and support for}} logon and <b>logoff</b> scripts.|$|E
5000|$|F4 {{performed}} an immediate forced <b>logoff</b> {{of the user}} if struck, by accident or on purpose. This would be the equivalent on MS-DOS of pressing CTRL-ALT-DEL, which force-reboots the machine immediately.|$|E
50|$|Some {{programs}} {{installed on}} desktop computers do not properly release {{control of the}} User registry during <b>logoff,</b> and can result in corrupted profiles because the User registry copying never successfully completes. To deal with this, Microsoft created a utility known as the User Profile Hive Cleanup Service which will forcibly remap the file handles for these misbehaving programs so that the profile copying can finish successfully and the account <b>logoff</b> is successful. However, the hung program may remain on the local computer still holding the local cached copy of the User registry in a busy state, until the computer is rebooted.|$|E
5000|$|<b>LOGOFF</b> to end one's session. If {{someone was}} going to use the terminal, or they wanted to change accounts, they could also type <b>LOGOFF</b> BUT to issue an {{immediate}} request for a new login. Any printed output the user had generated during their session would be spooled to the line printer and printed at this time. The option 'TAPE' could be used, as in [...] "LOGOFF TAPE", [...] "LOGOFF BUT,TAPE" [...] or [...] "LOGOFF TAPE,BUT" [...] to indicate that pending printed output should be spooled to magnetic tape instead of being printed. A request would be sent to the system operator.|$|E
50|$|Deletion of {{profiles}} {{marked for}} deletion {{at the next}} <b>logoff</b> does not fail for locked profiles. For workgroup computers, Windows XP no longer deletes the profiles of users belonging to the Guests group.|$|E
50|$|Screen Pass is a Windows-based screen locking {{software}} for network administrators which provides them enforcement of password security and centrally control security options over idle workstations. Its advanced features include automatic <b>logoff,</b> auto shutdown, administrator override, and record of all workstation events.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to triggers that fire when data is modified, Oracle 10g supports triggers that fire when schema level objects (that is, tables) are modified and when user logon or <b>logoff</b> events occur. These trigger types {{are referred to}} as [...] "Schema-level triggers".|$|E
5000|$|New {{configurable}} sound {{events for}} Device Connect, Device Disconnect, Device Failed to Connect, Print Complete, New fax, Fax Error, System Notification, Windows Logon and Windows <b>Logoff.</b> Windows XP Service Pack 2 added sound events in Internet Explorer for Blocked pop-up {{window and the}} Information bar.|$|E
50|$|Redirecting My Documents and the Desktop in a {{mandatory}} profile will allow documents to be saved, but at <b>logoff,</b> any {{changes to the}} desktop appearance such as the desktop picture, Internet Explorer cookies, Favorites, and the Recent documents opened list are reverted to the original state.|$|E
50|$|System testing tests a {{completely}} integrated system {{to verify that}} the system meets its requirements. For example, a system test might involve testing a logon interface, then creating and editing an entry, plus sending or printing results, followed by summary processing or deletion (or archiving) of entries, then <b>logoff.</b>|$|E
50|$|If their {{credentials}} were correct, then if {{the system}} manager (the owner of account $TSOS) had posted a system message, it would display at this time. The user would be at command mode, and a standard / prompt would appear where they could type various commands. The user would finish their session by typing <b>LOGOFF</b> and pressing transmit on the Univac VDT or Control-C on an ascii terminal.|$|E
5000|$|The Application layer {{may provide}} the {{following}} services to the application processes: identification of the intended communication partners, establishment of the necessary authority to communicate, determination of availability and authentication of the partners, agreement on privacy mechanisms for the communication, agreement on responsibility for error recovery and procedures for ensuring data integrity, synchronization between cooperating application processes, identification of any constraints on syntax (e.g. character sets and data structures), determination of cost and acceptable quality of service, selection of the dialogue discipline, including required logon and <b>logoff</b> procedures.|$|E
50|$|The {{services}} {{layer is}} {{commonly referred to}} as System-of-Systems Common Operating Environment (SoSCOE). SoSCOE provides interoperability with existing systems, intra and inter platform networking (including e-mail and web services), data services and information assurance, and search capabilities. The Services Layer also contains administrative applications that provide capabilities including login service, startup, <b>logoff,</b> erase, alert/emergency restart and monitoring control. It enables straightforward integration of separate software packages, independent of their location, connectivity mechanism and the technology used to develop them. SoSCOE has three different variants: Micro Edition, Realtime Edition, Standard Edition. Multiple editions allow SoSCOE to meet performance, scalability, portability, and interoperability requirements of FCS platforms.|$|E
50|$|Windows XP reconciles {{local and}} roaming user {{profiles}} using {{a copy of}} the contents of the registry. The user is no longer made to wait as in Windows 2000 until the profile is unloaded. Windows XP saves locked registry hives with open keys after 60 seconds so that roaming profile changes can be saved back to the server. The problem left is that the computer cannot recover the memory the profile uses until it can be unloaded. To make sure the user profiles are completely reconciled correctly during <b>logoff,</b> Microsoft has released the User Profile Hive Cleanup service for Windows XP, which they later included in Windows Vista.|$|E
50|$|MTConnect is a {{protocol}} {{designed for the}} exchange of data between shop floor equipment and software applications used for monitoring and data analysis. MTConnect {{is referred to as}} a read-only standard, meaning that it only defines the extraction (reading) of data from control devices, not the writing of data to a control device. Freely available, open standards are used for all aspects of MTConnect. Data from shop floor devices is presented in XML format, and is retrieved from information providers, called Agents, using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) as the underlying transport protocol. MTConnect provides a RESTful interface, which means the interface is stateless. No session must be established to retrieve data from an MTConnect Agent, and no logon or <b>logoff</b> sequence is required (unless overlying security protocols are added which do). Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is recommended for discovery services.|$|E
50|$|Windows XP {{includes}} some {{changes to the}} behavior of Offline Files. The Offline Files Client-Side Cache can now be encrypted with Encrypting File System. Shared folders from DFS namespaces can be made available offline. Also, roaming user profiles can be synchronized with the server even if Offline Files has marked the server as unavailable. Windows XP Service Pack 2 (and KB811660) introduce additional functionality for Offline Files. By editing the Registry, users can suppress error messages for file types that Offline Files cannot cache and which are excluded from synchronization. Offline Files for a user that are not on his primary computer (determined by matching the current user's SID with the specified SID in the registry) can be set to purge at <b>logoff.</b> Administratively assigned offline files can also be prevented from being cached for non-primary users.|$|E
5000|$|Keyboard - Any of {{the first}} 256 key codes ("Usages") defined in the HID Usage Tables, Usage Page 7 can be {{reported}} by a keyboard using the boot protocol, but most systems only handle a subset of these keys. Most systems support all 104 keys on the IBM AT-101 layout, plus the three extra keys designed for Microsoft Windows 95 (the left and right Windows key, and the Menu key). Many systems also support additional keys on basic western European 105-, Korean 106-, Brazilian ABNT 107- and Japanese DOS/V 109-key layouts. Buttons, knobs and keys that are not reported on Usage Page 7 are not available. For example, a particular US keyboard's QWERTY keys will function but the Calculator and <b>Logoff</b> keys will {{not because they are}} defined on Usage Page 12 and cannot be reported in boot protocol.|$|E
5000|$|The {{redesigned}} Task Scheduler is now {{based on}} Management Console {{and can be}} used to automate management and configuration tasks. It already has a number of preconfigured system-level tasks scheduled to run at various times. In addition to time-based triggers, Task Scheduler also supports calendar and event-based triggers, such as starting a task when a particular event is logged to the event log, or even only when multiple events have occurred. Also, several tasks that are triggered by the same event can be configured to run either simultaneously or in a pre-determined chained sequence of a series of actions, instead of having to create multiple scheduled tasks. Tasks can also be configured to run based on system status such as being idle for a pre-configured amount of time, on startup, <b>logoff,</b> or only during or for a specified time. Tasks can be triggered by an XPath expression for filtering events from the Windows Event Log. Tasks can also be delayed for a specified time after the triggering event has occurred, or repeat until some other event occurs. Actions that need to be done if a task fails can also be configured. There are several actions defined across various categories of applications and components. Task Scheduler keeps a history log of all execution details of all the tasks. Other features of Task Scheduler include: ...|$|E
50|$|Task Scheduler 2.0 was {{introduced}} with Windows Vista and included in Windows Server 2008 as well. The redesigned Task Scheduler user interface is now based on Management Console. In addition to running tasks on scheduled times or specified intervals, Task Scheduler 2.0 also supports calendar and event-based triggers, such as starting a task when a particular event is logged {{to the event}} log, or when a combination of events has occurred. Also, several tasks that are triggered by the same event can be configured to run either simultaneously or in a pre-determined chained sequence {{of a series of}} actions, instead of having to create multiple scheduled tasks. Tasks can also be configured to run based on system status such as being idle for a pre-configured amount of time, on startup, <b>logoff,</b> or only during or for a specified time. XPath expressions can be used to filter events from the Windows Event Log. Tasks can also be delayed for a specified time after the triggering event has occurred, or repeat until some other event occurs. Actions that need to be done if a task fails can also be configured. The actions that can be taken in response to triggers, both event-based as well as time-based, not only include launching applications but also take a number of custom actions. Task Scheduler includes a number of actions built-in, spanning a number of applications; including send an e-mail, show a message box, or fire a COM handler when it is triggered. Custom actions can also be specified using the Task Scheduler API. Task Scheduler keeps a history log of all execution details of all the tasks.. Windows Vista uses Task Scheduler 2.0 to run various system-level tasks; consequently, the Task Scheduler service can no longer be disabled (except with a simple registry tweak).|$|E

40|$|An {{intelligent}} {{data terminal}} has been {{constructed by the}} use of amicrocomputor. The hardware consists of a phonecoupler and a microcomputer with a RS 232 C interfacing circuit, 32 KB RAM's, a CRT display, a key bord, an IBM 735 typewriter, and a CMT. The software consists of two separate programs written in machine codes: "TSS" and "EDIT". The former is the program for data transmission by TSS. Some intelligent functions are involved: storage of data, transmission of any character string of any length consisting of one or many rows into a hostcomputor by a simple KB operation, etc. The terminal has worked well in 300 bps, and will also work well in 1200 bps. The "EDIT" is a screen editor for generating and correcting a string of ASCII codes. It is used in preparing a text to be transmitted into the host, in edditing the result of TSS after <b>logoff,</b> or in preparing papers or letters...|$|E
40|$|The Material Control and Accountability (MC and A) Group has {{developed}} an electronic scan system to acknowledge issuance and returns of Tamper Indicating Device (TID) seals. Important MC and A features of the system are: 1. The system requires the issuer identification and the identification of applicators to be entered, thereby ensuring {{that at least two}} qualified issuers and applicators possess the seals. Also, Operations is prompted to ensure the Two Person Rule is met during issuance and application of the seals. 2. All input is date and time stamped to ease resolution of anomalies. 3. The system requires all information to be input before allowing the user to <b>logoff,</b> thereby eliminating the problem of incomplete information in the records. 4. The input is immediately available to FBL MC and A personnel outside the facility who then know to expect completed procedures and forms regarding these transactions. The paper will describe the application of these features in routine operations as well as the development effort and final configuration of the system...|$|E
40|$|Denial of Service (DoS) {{attack is}} a major problem {{prevalent}} in Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN). Many security techniques were introduced to prevent the DoS attacks in WLAN. However, there are still many weaknesses which provide interest and way for hackers to do such attacks. This research mainly deals with the two types of DoS attacks, namely EAPOL (Extensible Authentication Protocol over LAN) start and EAPOL <b>logoff</b> frame over Access Point (AP) and wireless client. The experimental test bed is taken and the solutions are simulated using NS- 2, a Linux based simulator, to analyze how far it prevents the DoS attacks in WLAN. The Central Manager (CM) along with Intruder Database (IDB) is proposed to defend the two different types of attacks targeted on Access Point and Client. The CM and IDB can be combined together and called as Integrated Central Manager (ICM). It acts as an Authenticated Server (AS) which manages the communication between the client and the Access Point. The proposed solution increases the throughput. When there is a chance of the failure of the ICM, maintaining a duplicate ICM is proposed which secure the client and Access Point from the attacks...|$|E
40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of {{publicly}} accessible databases has increased the difficulty in knowing about their existence, their contents {{and the way to}} access them. So it would be very useful to put the information about available databases online, having databases catalogued according to their contents. To support end users in retrieving such information, accessing the catalogue of database should be very powerful. On the other hand the maintenance of the information contained in the catalogue cannot be performed in a centralized site due to the natural distribution of information around the world. The standard OSI X. 500 is considered a suitable mean to maintain a distributed catalogue of online source of information. This paper proposes a new X. 500 object class, named "onlineDatabase" (subclass of the object class "onlineInforn 1 ationResource") to map any database information entry as well as a directory schema suitable to deploy the information on a world wide basis while leaving the maintenance of the information to its producer or as near as possible to him. The papers describes how, using the object class "documentSeries", a hierarchical subject index mapping the UNESCO thesaurus has been implemented. This Thesaurus is used by UNESCO to index (by arguments) and retrieve all documents and publications processed through the computerized Documentation System of the UNESCO libraries. Any database entry can be referred by more than one thesaurus entry. For any entry of the thesaurus it 2 ̆ 7 s possible to select any database dealing a specific argument. A prototype implementation of the system is presented. The prototype is composed by a X. 5 OO DSA, an end-user interface running on UNIX system, and a catalogue of databases presently available through the ASTRA service. The end-user interface is able to retrieve the entry of the database of interest by accessing the subjects subtree, or by directly selecting the database entry. Any database entry contains some information such as: the content, the logon and <b>logoff</b> procedures, the database producers, distributors and contact persons, the network access procedures, the source from which the database has been implemented, the cost-of-use, the database management system and where to find much more information...|$|E
