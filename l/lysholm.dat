Born {{into one of}} Trondheim's wealthiest mercantile families, he travelled to England where he developed a great admiration of English language and literature. Despite his commercial background he was more drawn towards the fields of politics, culture and art. He nevertheless administrated his father's family firm, acting as foreign correspondent with {{little interest in the}} everyday business. In England he befriended Lord Byron and came {{under the influence of the}} English national liberal movement. Prior to his death, he bequeathed his entire library and several artworks to the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters.|$|E

5000|$|The Rotary Screw CompressorAlthough {{the first}} {{commercial}} application of a fluid injected rotary screw compressor was accomplished by Swedish industrial manufacturer Atlas Copco in 1957, it was Sullair's Founding President, Don Hoode, that introduced the technology to the U.S. domestic market in 1966. And by 1969, Sullair had developed an entire line of portable and stationary asymmetric rotary screw air compressors. [...] Hoode purchased {{the use of the}} technology from Swedish firm Svenska Rotor Maskiner, whose retired chief engineer, Alf <b>Lysholm,</b> invented the twin-screw compressor in 1934 while developing gas turbines. The <b>Lysholm</b> design is also used in vehicles to force air induction into engine cylinders, supercharging both gas and diesel powered engines to boost engine performance. Today, rotary screw compressors are the most popular type of air compressor in operation worldwide. Sullair's leadership decision to stay exclusively with the rotary screw technology when others still relied on piston driven technology, proved to be a valuable decision for the company, and was significant in its growth within the industry.|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} in Oslo as a son of chief {{physician}} Jan Nicolai Thorstein Odegard and Bergljot <b>Lysholm</b> Bugge. He finished his secondary education at Oslo Cathedral School in 1958, and also graduated from Oslo Commerce School in 1963 and the Norwegian School of Economics in 1966.

50|$|As a young man, Jørgen {{studied in}} Berlin. Jørgen's father, Nicolay, {{established}} a soap factory on Fagerheim in Trondheim, {{together with his}} brother.

The factory delivered all kinds of liquor, such as punsj and aquavit. <b>Lysholm</b> was the first to produce Linie Aquavit, which became the company’s most popular brand and best selling product. Today, Linie Aquavit is still represented as in 1842.|$|E

There was even a one-off 785 cc version built by Cosworth employees Paul Squires and Phil Kidsley; fitted with a <b>Lysholm</b> supercharger it was installed in a Brabham BT28 Formula 3 chassis and competed in the British Hill Climb Championship as the Brabham-Lysholm.|$|E

5000|$|Among {{the most}} {{important}} brands are Løiten, <b>Lysholm</b> and Gilde from Norway, Aalborg from Denmark and O.P. Anderson from Sweden.

While members of all three nations can be found to claim that [...] "their" [...] style of aquavit is the best as a matter of national pride, Norwegian akevitt tend to have, if not the most distinctive character, then at least the most overpowering flavour and deepest colour due to the aging process.|$|E

Only the SL55 has more power due to a larger throttle body.The supercharged 5.4 L V8 engine was mated to the Speedshift 5-speed automatic transmission, which has a torque capacity of 796 lbft Nm, as the newer 7G-Tronic introduced in 2003 is limited to 542 lbft Nm, not enough to handle the torque from the supercharged V8.|$|E

Mercedes has claimed that a more restrictive exhaust system was responsible for cutting output on the E55 AMG, however some enthusiasts have managed to bump up horsepower to 505 on the E55 by incorporating some parts from the SL55.|$|E

5000|$|On March 24, 1878 Heinrich Krigar of Germany {{obtained}} patent #4121, patenting {{the first}} ever screw-type compressor. Later that same year on August 16 he obtained patent #7116 after modifying and improving his original designs. His designs show a two-lobe rotor assembly with each rotor having the same shape as the other. Although the design resembled the Roots style compressor, the [...] "screws" [...] were clearly shown with 180 degrees of twist along their length. Unfortunately, the technology of the time was not sufficient to produce such a unit, and Heinrich made no further progress with the screw compressor. Nearly half a century later, in 1935, Alf <b>Lysholm,</b> who was working for Ljungstroms Angturbin AB (later known as Svenska Rotor Maskiner AB or SRM in 1951), patented a design with five female and four male rotors. He also patented the method for machining the compressor rotors.|$|E
50|$|The same author {{reported}} first clinical {{results with}} the AMIC technique in 2010. A total of 27 patients who underwent AMIC surgery between 2003 and 2005 {{were included in}} this prospective investigation. The follow-up period was between 24 and 62 months {{with a mean of}} 37 months. The mean age of the patients was 39 years (range 16 - 50 years). The mean defect size was 4.2 cm2 (range 1.3 - 8.8 cm2). Three patients had to be excluded from the study. 20 of the 23 patients questioned answered that they were highly satisfied with the results after surgery and stated overall improvement of knee function. The outcome scores applied (<b>Lysholm,</b> ICRS, Meyer, Tegner, Cincinnati) showed significant increase up to 24 months with a slight decrease from three years post surgery. Patients with lesions larger 8 cm2 had greatly reduced scores. Gille et al. concluded that treatment of chondral knee lesions with the AMIC technique is effective and safe in appropriately selected cases.|$|E
