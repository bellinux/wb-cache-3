[...] Director David Yates said Snape is a character with gravitas, authority and power. Snape typically displays a very calm and collected demeanour, rarely at a <b>loss</b> <b>for</b> <b>words</b> or taken off guard. His temper, however, is sometimes short where Harry is concerned and positively flares when dealing with his erstwhile tormentor Sirius, or when accused of cowardice. His otherwise impassive and aloof attitude seems to stem from his belief that people who cannot control their emotions are weak.|$|E

BBC Music states: [...] "When listing great pop stars of the 2000s, it's more than likely that Ciara will be unfairly forgotten. It's just as exciting to hear the slow jams as the club tracks, thanks to the detailed and often strange sounding backing tracks. She uses her silky vocals on softer tracks such as the Ne-Yo produced [...] "I Don't Remember" [...] or the delicate [...] "Never Ever" [...] to great effect. Only [...] "Like a Surgeon" [...] with its somewhat bizarre sex/hospital metaphors may leave you at a <b>loss</b> <b>for</b> <b>words.</b> Overall it is a record that manages to make you dance as much as retreat to the bedroom, Fantasy Ride is an album which could take Ciara to the much deserved next level. Slant Magazine also gave the album a positive review ending the review by calling the album [...] "Ciara's smoothest ride ever".|$|E

[...] Aaron thinks it a wise idea, and leaves the vestments with Eleazar outside, but yet remains innocent {{of the nature of the}} circumstances. [...] Entering into the cave, Moses and Aaron see a bed, a set table, and candelabra and a ministering angel. [...] Aaron now inquires what message Moses has from God, and indicates that even if it be about his own death, that he will accept it gratefully. [...] Aaron having broached the subject, Moses now takes the opportunity to inform him that it is indeed the notice of Aaron's death which is the message God means for Moses to convey. [...] Not alarmed at the content of the message, Aaron is nevertheless perturbed that Moses did not tell him of his death in a more forthright manner. [...] However, Moses explains how Aaron's death will be more desirable than his own death, for Aaron is to be buried by his brother, and his honor was to be inherited by his children; dignities which will be denied to Moses himself. [...] (Aaron is appeased by this argument, being evidently oblivious to the pathos therein.) ...|$|E

40|$|Acoustic word embeddings [...] - fixed-dimensional vector {{representations}} of variable-length spoken word segments [...] - {{have begun to}} be considered for tasks such as speech recognition and query-by-example search. Such embeddings can be learned discriminatively so that they are similar for speech segments corresponding to the same word, while being dissimilar for segments corresponding to different words. Recent work has found that acoustic word embeddings can outperform dynamic time warping on query-by-example search and related word discrimination tasks. However, the space of embedding models and training approaches is still relatively unexplored. In this paper we present new discriminative embedding models based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We consider training losses that have been successful in prior work, in particular a cross entropy <b>loss</b> <b>for</b> <b>word</b> classification and a contrastive loss that explicitly aims to separate same-word and different-word pairs in a "Siamese network" training setting. We find that both classifier-based and Siamese RNN embeddings improve over previously reported results on a word discrimination task, with Siamese RNNs outperforming classification models. In addition, we present analyses of the learned embeddings and the effects of variables such as dimensionality and network structure. Comment: To appear at SLT 201...|$|R

You will ask what sort of audience it was. Principally Women, Augustus--and, as I hope to be saved, all the old harridans of the world of fashion whom Mother Oldershaw had enameled in her time, sitting boldly in the front places, with their cheeks ruddled with paint, in a state of devout enjoyment wonderful to see!
