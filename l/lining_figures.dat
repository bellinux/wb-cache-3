25|$|Most modern typefaces set numeric digits {{by default}} as <b>lining</b> <b>figures,</b> {{which are the}} height of upper-case letters. Non-lining figures, styled to match lower-case letters, are often common in fonts {{intended}} for body text, as they {{are thought to be}} less disruptive to the style of running text. They are also called lower-case numbers or text figures for the same reason.|$|E
25|$|The {{widespread}} Western Arabic numerals {{used with}} the Latin script, in the table below labelled European, descended from the West Arabic numerals developed in al-Andalus (Andalucía, Spain) and the Maghreb. Spanish scholars, because of the geographic proximity, trade, and constant warfare with the Muslim kingdoms of Southern Spain, saw a potential in the simplicity of Arabic numbers, and decided to adopt those symbols, and later other Europeans followed suit. There are two typographic styles for rendering European numerals, known as <b>lining</b> <b>figures</b> and text figures.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, Caslons {{became almost}} a genre, {{modified}} expanded with new styles such as bold, condensed, inline or with modifications such as shortened descenders to fit American common line, or <b>lining</b> <b>figures.</b> Many foundries cut (or, in many cases, pirated) their own versions. By the 1920s, American Type Founders offered a large range of styles, some numbered rather than named. (Bookman Old Style is {{a descendant of}} one of these American Caslon revivals. A series of modifications has given most modern Bookman digitisations a somewhat exaggerated appearance with extremely high x-height very unlike the original Caslon.) The hot metal typesetting companies Linotype, Monotype, Intertype and Ludlow, which sold machines that cast type under the control of a keyboard, brought out their own Caslon releases.|$|E

50|$|High-quality {{typesetting}} generally prefers text {{figures in}} body text: they integrate better with lowercase letters and small capitals, unlike runs of <b>lining</b> <b>figures.</b> <b>Lining</b> <b>figures</b> are {{called for in}} all-capitals settings (hence the alternative name titling figures), and may work better in tables and spreadsheets. During the period of transition from text figures to lining, a justification for the old system was that the height differences helped distinguish similar numbers, while a justification for <b>lining</b> <b>figures</b> {{was that they were}} clearer (being larger) and that on uses such as page numbers they looked better giving all page numbers the same height. Amusingly, as several later writers have noted, the printer Thomas Curson Hansard in his landmark textbook on printing Typographia describes the new fashion as 'preposterous', but the book was printed using <b>lining</b> <b>figures</b> and the modern typefaces he also criticised throughout.|$|E

50|$|<b>Lining</b> <b>figures</b> {{came out}} of the new middle-class {{phenomenon}} of shopkeepers’ hand-lettered signage. They were introduced to European typography in 1788, when Richard Austin cut a new font for type founder John Bell, which included three-quarter height <b>lining</b> <b>figures.</b> They were further developed by 19th-century type designers, and largely displaced text figures in some contexts, such as newspaper and advertising typography.|$|E

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to propose a model that outputs subjective contours from <b>line</b> <b>figures.</b> This model, for a local process, detects endpoints and generates potential fields that represent probability of an occluding contour’s existence. Each field is anisotropic and spreads perpendicularly to the <b>line</b> <b>figure.</b> Then, for a comprehensive process, the direction of potential fields are corrected to the degree their intersections are maximized in the image. Finally, it fixes subjective contours by tracking potential ridgelines and outputs a result image. The generated subjective contour is smoothly curved and the shape is appropriate compared to what we perceive...|$|R

30|$|For {{relatively}} large values of b (> 0.02), the model robustly exhibits periodic oscillations or quiescence. For example, if one fixes {{a value of}} b at 0.2 (dashed grey vertical <b>line</b> 1, <b>Figure</b> 2, left) then the increase of gK 1 leads {{to the birth of}} a limit cycle from the equilibrium state, when crossing the AH curve at gK 1 = 11.4 nS. Further increase of gK 1 does not lead to bifurcations of the limit cycle until gK 1 crosses the AH curve at gK 1 = 42 nS, when the limit cycle bifurcates to a stable hyperpolarized equilibrium state. Smaller values of b may result in a sequence of local and non-local bifurcations of periodic orbits. For example, if one fixes b at 0.01 and increases gK 1 (grey dashed vertical <b>line</b> 2, <b>Figure</b> 2, left) then a limit cycle born through the supercritical AH bifurcation at gK 1 = 27.7 nS bifurcates to a torus when gK 1 crosses the torus birth bifurcation curve (blue <b>line,</b> <b>Figure</b> 2, left) at gK 1 ≈ 29.2 nS. Further increase of gK 1 results in the destruction of the torus and a cascade of transitions to bursting oscillations (discussed below), until gK 1 reaches a period doubling bifurcation curve (red <b>line,</b> <b>Figure</b> 2, left) at gK 1 ≈ 35.6 nS. Crossing the period doubling curve results in a single-period limit cycle oscillation which bifurcates to the hyperpolarized equilibrium state at gK 1 = 42.2 nS.|$|R
